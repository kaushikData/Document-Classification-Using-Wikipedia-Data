[[Japa]] (or japam) means repeating or remembering a [[mantra]] (or mantram), and '''''ajapa-japa''''' (or '''''ajapajapam''''') means constant awareness of the [[mantra]], or of what it represents.&lt;ref name=eemh&gt;
[[Eknath Easwaran]] (1977/2008). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=En3YNwAACAAJ&amp;dq=mantram+handbook+easwaran Mantram handbook]'' (5th ed.). Tomales, CA: Nilgiri Press. {{ISBN|1-58638-028-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Swami Jnaneshvara Bharati, [http://www.swamij.com/mantra-japa-ajapa.htm Mantra Japa and Ajapa-Japa], accessed 9 Nov. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The letter A in front of the word japa means without (it should be understood, that ajapa means "no chanting", thus ajapa means to stop thinking about anything material, and japa means to think about Paramatma, God instead of thinking of maya).{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Thus, ajapa-japa is the practice of japa without the mental effort normally needed to repeat the mantra (effort is necessary for those who are not pure enough to dedicate themselves completely to God, and still have material desires, which is the cause of repeated reincarnation in samsara ocean). In other words, it has begun to come naturally, turning into a constant [[awareness]]. 

Says Swami Satchidananda: 

{{quote|"You can perform japa, repetition of a mantra or Sacred Word, in the midst of your day-to-day work. Then, when it becomes a habit, even when you are working intensely a portion of the mind will keep repeating the mantra always. That means you have locked one end of your chain to a holy place, while the rest of the chain remains still in the outside world."&lt;ref&gt;Sita Weiner, Swami Satchidananda, His Biography. 1970: Straight Arrow Books, World Publishing Company, NYC, New York, Lib. Congress # 70-141477&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While the word '[[japa]]' is [[Sanskrit]], and the practice described here associated with Hinduism, the same basic practice and result is also found in other faith traditions. Examples include the [[Jesus Prayer]] practice of [[Orthodox Christianity]],
&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous (1884/1991). ''The way of a pilgrim''. San Francisco: HarperSanFrancisco. {{ISBN|0-06-063017-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Allyne Smith, G. E. H.

Zikr or [[Dhikr]] (with alternate spellings depending on transliteration method) in Islamic contexts, particularly [[Sufi]] (6, 7), and several traditions within [[Catholic Christianity]] (8, 9).

==Procedure==
{{inappropriate person|section|date=May 2009}}
The practice of constant remembrance evolves in stages:

At first, the practitioner intentionally repeat the [[syllables]] of the mantra internally, as if you are talking to yourself in your mind. You allow the inner sound to come at whatever speed feels comfortable to the mind. Sometimes it is very slow, as if the mind were wading through a vat of honey. At other times it is very fast, as if flying through the sky without restraint.

With practice, the mantra japa is repeated automatically, like a song that you have heard many times, which just comes on its own. (Some practitioners consider this automatic repeating to be the meaning of Ajapa-Japa, though there is a subtler meaning, as described below.)

Gradually, you merely remember the mantra with attention drawn to it. It is more like noticing what is already happening, rather than causing it to happen. It is somewhat like the attention stance of listening rather than speaking, though you might not literally hear the sound.

In time, the feeling of the mantra is there, even when the sound or remembering of the syllables is not there. For example, sometimes people will say, "[[Om]], Shanti, Shanti, Shanti," where the word Shanti means peace or tranquility. During the remembering of the word there may be two things—the word and the feeling of peace or tranquility. When the syllables fade away, the feeling may still be there; this is remembrance of the feeling of the mantra.

As the practice evolves, there comes a pervasive awareness of the mantra, subtler than both the syllables and any surface level meaning or definition. This constant awareness is the meaning of Ajapa-Japa of the mantra.

'''Anticipation''' is an [[emotion]] involving [[pleasure]], [[wikt:excitement|excitement]], or [[anxiety]] in considering an [[Expectation (epistemic)|expected]] event.{{Attribution needed|date=December 2016}}
{{Emotion}}[[File:Anticipation.svg|thumb|Anticipation is the process of imaginative speculation about the future. The brain uses information about gravity, curvature, obstacles etc. to make a prediction.]]

==As a defence mechanism==
[[Robin Skynner]] considered anticipation as one of "the mature ways of dealing with real stress.... You reduce the stress of some difficult challenge by anticipating what it will be like and preparing for how you are going to deal with it".&lt;ref&gt;Robin Skynner/John Cleese, ''Life and how to survive it'' (London 1994) p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence that "the use of mature defenses (sublimation, anticipation) tended to increase with age".&lt;ref&gt;Hope R.Conte/Robert Plutchik, ''Ego Defenses'' (1995) p. 127&lt;/ref&gt;

==Desire==
"Anticipation is the central ingredient in sexual desire."&lt;ref&gt;Barry and Emily McCarthy, ''Rekindling Desire'' (2003) p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;{{Attribution needed|date=December 2016}} As "sex has a major cognitive component — the most important element for desire is positive anticipation".&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;{{Attribution needed|date=December 2016}} One name for pleasurable anticipation is excitement.{{Attribution needed|date=December 2016}}{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

More generally, anticipation is a central motivating force in everyday life — "the normal process of imaginative anticipation of, or speculation about, the future".&lt;ref&gt;Clon Campbell, ''The Romantic Ethic and the Spirit of Modern Consumerism'' (2005) p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; To enjoy one's life, "one needs a belief in Time as a promising medium to do things in; one needs to be able to suffer the pains and pleasures of anticipation and deferral".&lt;ref&gt;Adam Phillips, ''On Flirtation'' (London 1994) p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;{{Attribution needed|date=December 2016}}

==In music==
There is a number of theories explaining anticipation in music. Two prominent theories are the Neurological theories of Chase that attribute expectation building and anticipation both to inherent Neurological pitch evolution (Darwinian selection as pitch/rhythm/harmony communication response expectation) and the related skillful use of chord sequences (holding V7 until expectations are met with E, A, B7, or the well known Am/D7/G tease-satisfy sequence, with variations in the [[wheel of fifths]]). 

A second well-accepted theory is Huron's "ITPRA" 5 module theory of expectation, where previous imaginative tension hits the event onset/horizon, with prediction and reaction oscillating (alternating) in the response system, and resulting in appraisal feedback.&lt;ref&gt;Wayne Chase, "How Music Really Works" (Vancouver, 2006), {{ISBN|1-897311-55-9}}, pp. 434, 621&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Huron,"Sweet Anticipation, Music and the psychology of expectation" (Cambridge, 2006), {{ISBN|978-0-262-58278-0}}, p.17&lt;/ref&gt;

From a global perspective, even given thousands of varying scale types worldwide, there is a universal human sense of satisfaction in the return to that scale's tonic (for example, C, in the major scale, key, and tonic of C major).&lt;ref&gt;Michael Hewitt,"Musical Scales of the World" (London, 2013), {{ISBN|978-095-7547-001}}, p. 11 et. al&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of the broader topic of [[Music and emotion]], Juslin &amp; Västfjäll's BRECVEM model includes, as its seventh element, Musical expectation.&lt;ref&gt;Juslin, Liljeström, Västfjäll, &amp; Lundqvist. (2010). How does music evoke emotions? Exploring the underlying mechanisms. In P.N. Juslin &amp; J. Sloboda (Eds.), ''Handbook of Music and Emotion: Theory, Research, and Applications'' (pp. 605-642). Oxford: Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0199604968}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Technically, anticipation also refers specifically to a [[Nonchord tone#Anticipation|type of nonchord tone]].

''Note: this section refers to the process of generating the thought or feeling of anticipation in music. For titles of songs with the word Anticipation, see [[Anticipation (disambiguation)]].''

==In phenomenology==
For [[Phenomenological philosophy|phenomenological philosopher]] [[Edmund Husserl]], anticipation is an essential feature of human action. "In every action we know the goal in advance in the form of an anticipation that is 'empty', in the sense of vague...and [we] seek by our action to bring it step by step to concrete realization".&lt;ref&gt;E.

Anticipation can be shown in many ways; for example, some people seem to smile uncontrollably during this period, while others seem ill or sick. It is not uncommon for the brain to be so focused on an event, that the body is affected in such a way. [[glossophobia|Stage fright]] is a type of anticipation, stemming from the actor or actress hoping that they perform well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roadreadycases.com/resources/stage-fright.html|title=Understanding Stage Fright|website=www.roadreadycases.com|accessdate=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In pop culture ==
The musical ''[[The Rocky Horror Show]]'' and subsequent [[The Rocky Horror Picture Show|film]] use the phrase in a literal way, with Dr. Frank-N-Furter saying "I see you shiver with antici.......pation" (holding the breath between antici- and -pation for several seconds) during "[[Sweet Transvestite]]". Since the movie became a [[cult film]], it has become one of the most iconic and highly quoted lines.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

'''Assisted reproductive technology''' ('''ART''') are medical procedures used primarily to address [[infertility]]. It includes procedures such as [[in vitro fertilization]]. It may include [[intracytoplasmic sperm injection]] (ICSI), [[cryopreservation]] of gametes or embryos, and/or may involve the use of  [[fertility medication]]. When used to address infertility, it may also be referred to as '''fertility treatment.''' ART mainly belongs to the field of [[Reproductive endocrinology and infertility|reproductive endocrinology and infertility.]] Some forms of ART are also used with regard to fertile couples for genetic reasons ([[preimplantation genetic diagnosis]]). ART may also be used in [[surrogacy]] arrangements, although not all surrogacy arrangements involve ART.

==Procedures==

===General===
With ART, the process of [[sexual intercourse]] is bypassed and fertilization of the [[oocyte]]s occurs in the laboratory environment (i.e., [[in vitro fertilization]]).

In the US, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC)—which is required as a result of the 1992 ''Fertility Clinic Success Rate and Certification Act'' to publish the annual ART success rates at U.S. fertility clinics—defines ART to include "all fertility treatments in which both eggs and sperm are handled. In general, ART procedures involve surgically removing eggs from a woman's ovaries, combining them with sperm in the laboratory, and returning them to the woman's body or donating them to another woman."  According to CDC, "they do not include treatments in which only sperm are handled (i.e., intrauterine—or artificial—insemination) or procedures in which a woman takes medicine only to stimulate egg production without the intention of having eggs retrieved."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Assisted Reproductive Technology? {{!}} Reproductive Health  {{!}} CDC|url=https://www.cdc.gov/art/whatis.html|publisher=CDC|date=November 14, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171101183209/https://www.cdc.gov/art/whatis.html|archivedate=November 1, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, ART also excludes artificial insemination and includes only procedures where oocytes are handled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=European IVF-Monitoring Consortium (EIM) for the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology|last2=Calhaz-Jorge|first2=C., et al|last10=Wyns|title=Assisted reproductive technology in Europe, 2012: results generated from European registers by ESHRE.|journal=Human reproduction (Oxford, England)|date=August 2016|volume=31|issue=8|pages=1638–52|pmid=27496943|url=http://humrep.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2016/06/17/humrep.dew151.full|doi=10.1093/humrep/dew151}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sorenson|first1=Corinna|title=ART in the European Union|journal=Euro Observer Euro Observer|date=Autumn 2006|volume=8|issue=4|url=http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0019/80371/EuroObserver8_4.pdf?ua=1|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161129022850/http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0019/80371/EuroObserver8_4.pdf?ua=1|archivedate=2016-11-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WHO also defines ART this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zegers-Hochschild|first1=F, et al|last2=for the International Committee for Monitoring Assisted Reproductive Technology and the World Health Organization|title=International Committee for Monitoring Assisted Reproductive Technology (ICMART) and the World Health Organization (WHO) revised glossary of ART terminology, 2009.|journal=Fertility and Sterility|date=November 2009|volume=92|issue=5|pages=1520–4|pmid=19828144|url=http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/infertility/art_terminology2.pdf?ua=1|doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2009.09.009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161129024154/http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/infertility/art_terminology2.pdf?ua=1|archivedate=2016-11-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fertility medication===
Most fertility medications are agents that stimulate the development of follicles in the ovary. Examples are gonadotropins and gonadotropin releasing hormone.

===In vitro fertilization===
In vitro fertilization is the technique of letting [[fertilization]] of the male and female [[gametes]] (sperm and egg) occur outside the female body.

Techniques usually used in in vitro fertilization include:
* [[Transvaginal ovum retrieval]] (OVR) is the process whereby a small needle is inserted through the back of the vagina and guided via ultrasound into the ovarian follicles to collect the fluid that contains the eggs.
* [[Embryo transfer]] is the step in the process whereby one or several embryos are placed into the uterus of the female with the intent to establish a pregnancy.
Less commonly used techniques in in vitro fertilization are: 
* [[Assisted zona hatching]] (AZH) is performed shortly before the embryo is transferred to the uterus. A small opening is made in the outer layer surrounding the egg in order to help the embryo hatch out and aid in the implantation process of the growing embryo.
* [[Image:In_vitro_fertilization.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI)]][[Intracytoplasmic sperm injection]] (ICSI) is beneficial in the case of male factor infertility where sperm counts are very low or failed fertilization occurred with previous IVF attempt(s). The ICSI procedure involves a single sperm carefully injected into the center of an egg using a microneedle. With ICSI, only one sperm per egg is needed. Without ICSI, you need between 50,000 and 100,000.  This method is also sometimes employed when donor sperm is used.
* [[Autologous endometrial coculture]] is a possible treatment for patients who have failed previous IVF attempts or who have poor embryo quality. The patient's fertilized eggs are placed on top of a layer of cells from the patient's own uterine lining, creating a more natural environment for embryo development.
* In [[zygote intrafallopian transfer]] (ZIFT), egg cells are removed from the woman's ovaries and fertilized in the laboratory; the resulting zygote is then placed into the fallopian tube.
* [[Cytoplasmic transfer]] is the technique in which the contents of a fertile egg from a donor are injected into the infertile egg of the patient along with the sperm.
* [[Egg donor]]s are resources for women with no eggs due to surgery, chemotherapy, or genetic causes; or with poor egg quality, previously unsuccessful IVF cycles or [[advanced maternal age]]. In the egg donor process, eggs are retrieved from a donor's ovaries, fertilized in the laboratory with the sperm from the recipient's partner, and the resulting healthy embryos are returned to the recipient's uterus.
* [[Sperm donation]] may provide the source for the sperm used in IVF procedures where the male partner produces no sperm or has an inheritable disease, or where the woman being treated has no male partner.
* [[Preimplantation genetic diagnosis]] (PGD) involves the use of genetic screening mechanisms such as fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FISH) or comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) to help identify genetically abnormal embryos and improve healthy outcomes.
* [[Embryo splitting (disambiguation)|Embryo splitting]] can be used for twinning to increase the number of available embryos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Illmensee K, Levanduski M, Vidali A, Husami N, Goudas VT |title=Human embryo twinning with applications in reproductive medicine |journal=Fertil. Steril. |volume= 93|issue= 2|pages= 423–7|date=February 2009 |pmid=19217091 |doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2008.12.098 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre-implantation genetic diagnosis===
A [[pre-implantation genetic diagnosis]] procedure may be conducted on [[embryo]]s prior to [[Implantation (human embryo)|implantation]] (as a form of [[embryo profiling]]), and sometimes even of [[oocyte]]s prior to [[Fertilisation|fertilization]]. PGD is considered in a similar fashion to [[prenatal diagnosis]]. When used to screen for a specific [[genetic disease]], its main advantage is that it avoids selective [[abortion|pregnancy termination]] as the method makes it highly likely that the baby will be free of the disease under consideration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/612258/are-we-designing-inequality-into-our-genes/|title=Designer babies aren’t futuristic. They’re already here.|last=Hercher|first=Laura|date=2018-10-22|work=MIT Technology Review|access-date=2018-10-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; PGD thus is an adjunct to ART procedures, and requires [in vitro fertilization to obtain [[oocytes]] or [[embryo]]s for evaluation. Embryos are generally obtained through blastomere or blastocyst biopsy. The latter technique has proved to be less deleterious for the embryo, therefore it is advisable to perform the biopsy around day 5 or 6 of development.&lt;ref name=Sullivan-Pyke2018&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sullivan-Pyke |first1=C |last2=Dokras |first2=A |title=Preimplantation Genetic Screening and Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis. |journal=Obstetrics and gynecology clinics of North America |date=March 2018 |volume=45 |issue=1 |pages=113-125 |doi=10.1016/j.ogc.2017.10.009 |pmid=29428279}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Sex selection]] is the attempt to control the sex of offspring to achieve a desired sex. It can be accomplished in several ways, both pre- and post-implantation of an embryo, as well as at birth. Pre-implantation techniques include PGD, but also [[sperm sorting]].

===Others===
Other assisted reproduction techniques include:
* [[Mitochondrial replacement therapy]] (MRT, sometimes called mitochondrial donation) is the replacement of [[mitochondria]] in one or more cells to prevent or ameliorate disease. MRT originated as a special form of IVF in which some or all of the future baby's [[mitochondrial DNA]] comes from a third party. This technique is used in cases when mothers carry genes for [[mitochondrial diseases]]. The therapy is approved for use in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=NAS2016ethics&gt;{{cite book|last1=Committee on the Ethical and Social Policy Considerations of Novel Techniques for Prevention of Maternal Transmission of Mitochondrial DNA Diseases|last2=Board on Health Sciences Policy|last3=Institute of Medicine|editor1-last=Claiborne|editor1-first=Anne|editor2-last=English|editor2-first=Rebecca|editor3-last=Kahn|editor3-first=Jeffrey|title=Mitochondrial Replacement Techniques:  Ethical, Social, and Policy Considerations|date=2016|publisher=National Academies Press|isbn=978-0-309-38870-2|url=https://www.nap.edu/read/21871/chapter/1}} [http://nationalacademies.org/hmd/reports/2016/Mitochondrial-Replacement-Techniques Index page] with links to summaries including [http://www.nationalacademies.org/hmd/~/media/Files/Report%20Files/2016/Mitochondrial%20Replacement%20Techniques/mito%20ethics%20infographic_FINAL.pdf one page summary flyer].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=2015CreeRev&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cree|first1=L|last2=Loi|first2=P|title=Mitochondrial replacement: from basic research to assisted reproductive technology portfolio tool-technicalities and possible risks.|journal=Molecular Human Reproduction|date=January 2015|volume=21|issue=1|pages=3–10|pmid=25425606|doi=10.1093/molehr/gau082}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[gamete intrafallopian transfer]] (GIFT) a mixture of sperm and eggs is placed directly into a woman's fallopian tubes using laparoscopy following a transvaginal ovum retrieval.
* [[Reproductive surgery]], treating e.g. [[fallopian tube obstruction]] and [[vas deferens obstruction]], or reversing a [[vasectomy]] by a [[reverse vasectomy]]. In [[surgical sperm retrieval]] (SSR) the reproductive urologist obtains sperm from the vas deferens, epididymis or directly from the testis in a short outpatient procedure.
* By [[cryopreservation]], eggs, sperm and reproductive tissue can be preserved for later IVF.

==Risks==
The majority of IVF-conceived infants do not have [[congenital disorder|birth defect]]s.&lt;ref name="Van Voorhis 2007"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Van Voorhis BJ |year=2007 |title=Clinical practice. In vitro fertilization |journal=[[New England Journal of Medicine|N Engl J Med]] |volume=356 |issue=4 |pages=379–86 |pmid=17251534 |doi=10.1056/NEJMcp065743}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, some studies have suggested that assisted reproductive technology is associated with an increased risk of birth defects.&lt;ref name="Kurinczuk 2004"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kurinczuk JJ, Hansen M, Bower C |year=2004 |title=The risk of birth defects in children born after assisted reproductive technologies |journal=Current Opinion in Obstetrics and Gynecology |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=201–9 |pmid=15129049 |doi=10.1097/00001703-200406000-00002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hansen 2005"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hansen M, Bower C, Milne E, de Klerk N, Kurinczuk JJ |year=2005 |title=Assisted reproductive technologies and the risk of birth defects—a systematic review |journal=Hum Reprod |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=328–38 |pmid=15567881 |url=http://humrep.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/20/2/328.pdf |doi=10.1093/humrep/deh593}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Artificial reproductive technology is becoming more available. Early studies suggest that there could be an increased risk for medical complications with both the mother and baby. Some of these include low birth weight, placental insufficiency, chromosomal disorders, preterm deliveries, gestational diabetes, and pre-eclampsia(Aiken and Brockelsby).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1017/S096553951600005X|title=Fetal and Maternal Consequences of Pregnancies Conceived Using Art|journal=Fetal and Maternal Medicine Review|volume=25|issue=3–4|pages=281–294|year=2016|last1=Aiken|first1=Catherine E. M.|last2=Brockelsby|first2=Jeremy C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the largest U.S. study, which used data from a statewide registry of birth defects,&lt;ref name="Olson 2005"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Olson CK, Keppler-Noreuil KM, Romitti PA, Budelier WT, Ryan G, Sparks AE, Van Voorhis BJ |year=2005 |title=In vitro fertilization is associated with an increase in major birth defects |journal=Fertil Steril |volume=84 |issue=5 |pages=1308–15 |pmid=16275219 |doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2005.03.086}}&lt;/ref&gt;
6.2% of IVF-conceived children had major defects, as compared with 4.4% of naturally conceived children matched for [[maternal age effect|maternal age]] and other factors ([[odds ratio]], 1.3; 95% [[confidence interval]], 1.00 to 1.67).&lt;ref name="Van Voorhis 2007"/&gt; ART carries with it a risk for [[heterotopic pregnancy]] (simultaneous intrauterine and extrauterine pregnancy).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.obgmanagement.com/the-latest/feature-articles/article/what-you-should-know-about-heterotopic-pregnancy/56cf1776e64a3aecc3e2b9f225cbc001.html?tx_ttnews%5BsViewPointer%5D=1|title=What you should know about heterotopic pregnancy : OBG Management|last=MD|first=Daniel M. Avery, MD, Marion D. Reed, MD, William L. Lenahan,|website=www.obgmanagement.com|access-date=2016-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The main risks are:
* [[Genetic disorder]]s
* [[Low birth weight]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/007279.htm|title=In vitro fertilization (IVF): MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia|website=medlineplus.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In IVF and ICSI, a risk factor is the decreased expression of proteins in [[energy metabolism]]; [[Ferritin light chain]] and [[ATP5A1]].&lt;ref name=zhang&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zhang Y, Zhang YL, Feng C |title=Comparative proteomic analysis of human placenta derived from assisted reproductive technology |journal=Proteomics |volume= 8|issue= 20|pages= 4344–56|date=September 2008 |pmid=18792929 |doi=10.1002/pmic.200800294 |url=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Preterm birth]]. Low birth weight and preterm birth are strongly associated with many health problems, such as [[visual impairment]] and [[cerebral palsy]], and children born after IVF are roughly twice as likely to have cerebral palsy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med |year=2009 |volume=163 |issue=1 |pages=72–83 |title=Cerebral palsy, autism spectrum disorders, and developmental delay in children born after assisted conception: a systematic review and meta-analysis |vauthors=Hvidtjørn D, Schieve L, Schendel D, Jacobsson B, Sværke C, Thorsen P |pmid=19124707 |url=http://archpedi.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/163/1/72 |doi=10.1001/archpediatrics.2008.507 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928062747/http://archpedi.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/163/1/72 |archivedate=2011-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other risk factors are:
* [[Membrane damage]]{{Citation needed|reason=The reference Zhang'08 does not contain any direct data on membrane damage.|date=January 2014}}, which may be reflected by increased expression of the [[membrane fusion protein]]s [[NAPA (gene)|NAPA]] and [[Annexin A3]].&lt;ref name=zhang/&gt;
[[Sperm donation]] is an exception, with a birth defect rate of almost a fifth compared to the general population. It may be explained by that sperm banks accept only people with high sperm count.

Current data indicate little or no increased risk for [[postpartum depression]] among women who use ART.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1093/humupd/dmq025|title=Risk for postpartum depression associated with assisted reproductive technologies and multiple births: A systematic review|year=2010|last1=Ross|first1=L.

Usage of assisted reproductive technology including [[Ovulation induction|ovarian stimulation]] and [[in vitro fertilization]] have been associated with an increased overall risk of [[childhood cancer]] in the offspring, which may be caused by the same original disease or condition that caused the infertility or subfertility in the mother or father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=23562045|doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2013.03.017|title=Fertility treatment and childhood cancer risk: A systematic meta-analysis|year=2013|last1=Hargreave|first1=Marie|last2=Jensen|first2=Allan|last3=Toender|first3=Anita|last4=Andersen|first4=Klaus Kaae|last5=Kjaer|first5=Susanne Krüger|journal=Fertility and Sterility|volume=100|pages=150–61|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That said, In a landmark paper by Jacques Balayla et al. it was determined that infants born after ART have similar neurodevelopment than infants born after natural conception.&lt;ref&gt;Balayla, Jacques, Odile Sheehy, William D. Fraser, Jean R. Séguin, Jacquetta Trasler, Patricia Monnier, Andrea A. MacLeod, Marie-Noëlle Simard, Gina Muckle, and Anick Bérard.

==Usage==
Assisted reproductive technology procedures performed in the U.S. has more than doubled over the last 10 years, with 140,000 procedures in 2006,&lt;ref name=chicagoART&gt;[http://www.chicagotribune.com/features/arts/chi-0621-fertility-dramas-side1jun21,0,7805988.story chicagotribune.com Infertility by the numbers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090705084623/http://www.chicagotribune.com/features/arts/chi-0621-fertility-dramas-side1jun21,0,7805988.story |date=2009-07-05 }} Colleen Mastony. June 21, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in 55,000 births.&lt;ref name=chicagoART/&gt;

In [[Australia]], 3.1% of births are a result of ART.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,26117922-12377,00.html 'More IVF babies but less multiple births'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090924235447/http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,26117922-12377,00.html |date=2009-09-24 }} THE AUSTRALIAN. September 24, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In case of discontinuation of fertility treatment, the most common reasons have been estimated to be: postponement of treatment (39%), physical and psychological burden (19%, psychological burden 14%, physical burden 6.32%), relational and personal problems (17%, personal reasons 9%, relational problems 9%), treatment rejection (13%) and organizational (12%) and clinic (8%) problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1093/humupd/dms031|title=Why do patients discontinue fertility treatment?

==Society and culture==
===Ethics===
Some couples find it difficult to stop treatment despite very bad prognosis, resulting in futile therapies. This may give ART providers a difficult decision of whether to continue or refuse treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1 = Ethics Committee of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine | title = Fertility treatment when the prognosis is very poor or futile | journal = Fertility and Sterility | volume = 92 | issue = 4 | pages = 1194–7 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19726040 | doi = 10.1016/j.fertnstert.2009.07.979 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some assisted reproductive technologies can in fact be harmful to both the mother and child. Posing a psychological and a physical health risk, which may impact the ongoing use of these treatments. The adverse effects may cause for alarm, and they should be tightly regulated to ensure candidates are not only mentally, but physically prepared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1 = Noah, Lars  | title = Assisted Reproductive Technologies and the Pitfalls of Unregulated Biomedical Innovation | journal = Florida Law Review | volume = 55 | issue = 2 | pages = 604–609 | year = 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Costs===

====United States====
Many Americans do not have [[health insurance|insurance]] coverage for fertility investigations and treatments. Many states are starting to mandate coverage, and the rate of use is 278% higher in states with complete coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jain T, Harlow BL, Hornstein MD |title=Insurance coverage and outcomes of ''in vitro'' fertilization |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=347 |issue=9 |pages=661–6 |date=August 2002 |pmid=12200554 |doi=10.1056/NEJMsa013491}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are some health insurance companies that cover diagnosis of infertility but frequently once diagnosed will not cover any treatment costs.

2005 approximate treatment/diagnosis costs (United States, costs in US$):
* Initial workup: [[hysteroscopy]], [[hysterosalpingogram]], [[blood test]]s ~$2,000
* Sonohysterogram (SHG) ~ $600–$1,000
* Clomiphene citrate cycle ~ $200–$500
* IVF cycle ~ $10,000–$30,000
* Use of a [[surrogate mother]] to carry the child – dependent on arrangements
Another way to look at costs is to determine the expected cost of establishing a pregnancy. Thus if a clomiphene treatment has a chance to establish a pregnancy in 8% of cycles and costs $500, the expected cost is $6,000 to establish a pregnancy, compared to an IVF cycle (cycle fecundity 40%) with a corresponding expected cost of $30,000 ($12,000/.4).

For the community as a whole, the cost of IVF on average pays back by 700% by tax from future employment by the conceived human being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Connolly MP, Pollard MS, Hoorens S, Kaplan BR, Oskowitz SP, Silber SJ |title=Long-term economic benefits attributed to IVF-conceived children: a lifetime tax calculation |journal=Am J Manag Care |volume=14 |issue=9 |pages=598–604 |date=September 2008 |pmid=18778175 |url=http://www.ajmc.com/pubMed.php?pii=10709}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United Kingdom====
In the United Kingdom, all patients have the right to preliminary testing, provided free of charge by the [[National Health Service]]. However, treatment is not widely available on the NHS and there can be long waiting lists. Many patients therefore pay for immediate treatment within the NHS or seek help from private clinics.

In 2013, the [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]] published new guidelines about who should have access to IVF treatment on the NHS in England and Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IVF|url=http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/IVF/Pages/Introduction.aspx|publisher=NHS Choices|accessdate=19 April 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140420030919/http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/IVF/Pages/Introduction.aspx|archivedate=20 April 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The guidelines also say women aged between 40 and 42 should be offered one cycle of IVF on the NHS if all of the following additional criteria are also met: They have never had IVF treatment before, have no evidence of low ovarian reserve (this is when eggs in the ovary are low in number or low in quality) and have been informed of the additional implications of IVF and pregnancy at this age. However, if tests show IVF is the only treatment likely to help them get pregnant, women should be referred for IVF straight away.

This policy is often modified by local Clinical Commissioning Groups, in a fairly blatant breach of the [[NHS Constitution for England]] which provides that patients have the right to drugs and treatments that have been recommended by NICE for use in the NHS.  For example, the Cheshire, Merseyside and West Lancashire [[Clinical Commissioning Group]] insists on additional conditions:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Services &amp; how we can help|url=http://www.thehewittfertilitycentre.org.uk/funding-options/|publisher=Liverpool Women's NHS Foundation Trust|accessdate=19 April 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140624054259/http://thehewittfertilitycentre.org.uk/funding-options/|archivedate=2014-06-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The person undergoing treatment must have commenced treatment before her 40th birthday.
* The person undergoing treatment must have a BMI of between 19 and 29.
* Neither partner must have any living children, from either the current or previous relationships. This includes adopted as well as biological children.
* Sub-fertility must not be the direct result of a sterilisation procedure in either partner (this does not include conditions where sterilisation occurs as a result of another medical problem). Couples who have undertaken a reversal of their sterilisation procedure are not eligible for treatment.

====Canada====
{{see also|Assisted Human Reproduction Act}}
Some treatments are covered by OHIP (public health insurance) in Ontario and others are not. Those with bilaterally blocked fallopian tubes and under 40 have treatment is covered but are still required to pay lab fees (around $3,000–4,000).  Coverage varies in other provinces.  Most other patients are required to pay for treatments themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ivfcanada.com/services/fees/general_fee_schedule.cfm IVF Canada] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090808064341/http://www.ivfcanada.com/services/fees/general_fee_schedule.cfm |date=2009-08-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Israel ====
Israel's national health insurance, which is mandatory for all Israeli citizens, covers nearly all fertility treatments. IVF costs are fully subsidized up to the birth of two children for all Israeli women, including single women and lesbian couples. Embryo transfers for purposes of gestational surrogacy are also covered.&lt;ref&gt;Teman, Elly. 2010.

====Germany====
On 27 January 2009, the Federal Constitutional Court ruled that it is unconstitutional, that the health insurance companies have to bear only 50% of the cost for IVF.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.samenspender-info.de/zuschuesse-kuenstliche-befruchtung.html Zuschüsse der Krankenversicherung für eine künstliche Befruchtung ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130208072207/http://www.samenspender-info.de/zuschuesse-kuenstliche-befruchtung.html |date=2013-02-08 }} Retrieved 2. January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 March 2012, the Federal Council has approved a draft law of some federal states, which provides that the federal government provides a subsidy of 25% to the cost. Thus, the share of costs borne for the pair would drop to just 25%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insemination-erfolg.de/finanzierung-befruchtung.html Finanzierung künstlicher Befruchtung] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130219152136/http://www.insemination-erfolg.de/finanzierung-befruchtung.html |date=2013-02-19 }} Retrieved 2.

===Fictional representation===
Films and other fiction depicting emotional struggles of assisted reproductive technology have had an upswing in the latter part of the 2000s decade, although the techniques have been available for decades.&lt;ref name=chicagotribune&gt;[http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/art/chi-0621-fertility-dramasjun21,0,2997759.story chicagotribune.com --&gt; Heartache of infertility shared on stage, screen] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120703180716/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2009-06-21/news/0906190243_1_fertility-treatments-ovulation-artificial-insemination |date=2012-07-03 }} By Colleen Mastony, Tribune reporter. June 21, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet, the number of people that can relate to it by personal experience in one way or another is ever growing, and the variety of trials and struggles are huge.&lt;ref name=chicagotribune/&gt;

''For specific examples, refer to the fiction sections in individual subarticles, e.g. [[Surrogacy#Fictional representation|surrogacy]], [[Sperm donor#Fictional representation|sperm donation]] and [[fertility clinic]].''

In addition, [[reproduction and pregnancy in speculative fiction]] has been present for many decades.

==Research and speculative uses==
The idea of using future ART techniques, including direct human germline engineering technologies, to select and genetically modify embryos for the purpose of [[human enhancement]] has been referred to as '''designer babies''', '''reprogenetics''', and '''liberal eugenics''' and has been discussed since the introduction of [[biotechnology]] in the late 1970s.&lt;ref name="Gordon1999"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gordon JW |title=Genetic enhancement in humans |journal=Science |volume=283 |issue=5410 |pages=2023–4 |year=1999 |pmid=10206908 |doi=10.1126/science.283.5410.2023 |bibcode=1999Sci...283.2023G }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/embryo-screening-and-the-ethics-of-human-60561 Pray, L.

The term "liberal eugenics" was coined by bioethicist [[Nicholas Agar]].&lt;ref name="Agar 2004"&gt;{{cite book|author = [[Nicholas Agar|Agar, Nicholas]]|title = Liberal Eugenics: In Defence of Human Enhancement|year = 2004|isbn = 1-4051-2390-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last= |first= |date=2008 |title=Regulating Eugenics |url= http://harvardlawreview.org/2008/04/regulating-eugenics/ |journal=Harvard Law Review |access-date=May 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liberal eugenics is aimed at "improving" the genotypes of future generations through screening and genetic modification to eliminate "undesirable" traits.  The term "reprogenetics" was coined by [[Lee M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17355">A '''catch-22''' is a [[paradoxical]] situation from which an individual cannot escape because of contradictory rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Catch-22 | journal=Random House Dictionary | publisher=Random House | year=2012 | url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/catch-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OALD&gt;"[http://oald8.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/dictionary/catch-22 Catch 22]", ''Oxford Advanced Learners' Dictionary'', accessed 16 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined by [[Joseph Heller]], who used it in his 1961 novel ''[[Catch-22]]''.

An example is:
: "How am I supposed to gain experience [to find a good job] if I'm constantly turned down for not having any?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Jacquelyn|title=When an Employer Requires Experience and You Have None|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jacquelynsmith/2012/05/09/when-an-employer-requires-experience-and-you-have-none/#66ba99c22878|website=Forbes|accessdate=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Catch-22s often result from rules, regulations, or procedures that an individual is subject to, but has no control over, because to fight the rule is to accept it. Another example is a situation in which someone is in need of something that can only be had by not being in need of it (''e.g'', a bank will never issue someone a loan if they ''need'' the money). One connotation of the term is that the creators of the "catch-22" situation have created arbitrary rules in order to justify and conceal their own abuse of power.

== Origin and meaning ==

[[Joseph Heller]] coined the term in his 1961 novel ''[[Catch-22]]'', which describes absurd bureaucratic constraints on soldiers in [[World War II]]. The term is introduced by the character Doc Daneeka, an army psychiatrist who invokes "Catch-22" to explain why any pilot requesting mental evaluation for insanity—hoping to be found not sane enough to fly and thereby escape dangerous missions—demonstrates his own sanity in creating the request and thus cannot be declared insane. This phrase also means a dilemma or difficult circumstance from which there is no escape because of mutually conflicting or dependent conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beidler|first1=Philip D.|title=Scriptures for a Generation: What We Were Reading in the '60s|date=1995|isbn=978-0820317878|page=162|quote=It is Catch-22: Dr. Daneeka explains how anybody who is crazy has a right to ask to be removed from combat status but how anybody who asks is revealing a rational concern for his own safety that makes him not crazy;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|"You mean there's a catch?"

"Sure there's a catch," Doc Daneeka replied. "Catch-22. Anyone who wants to get out of combat duty isn't really crazy."

There was only one catch and that was Catch-22, which specified that a concern for one's own safety in the face of dangers that were real and immediate was the process of a rational mind. [[Orr (Catch-22)|Orr]] was crazy and could be grounded. All he had to do was ask; and as soon as he did, he would no longer be crazy and would have to fly more missions. Orr would be crazy to fly more missions and sane if he didn't, but if he was sane, he had to fly them. If he flew them, he was crazy and didn't have to; but if he didn't want to, he was sane and had to. [[John Yossarian|Yossarian]] was moved very deeply by the absolute simplicity of this clause of Catch-22 and let out a respectful whistle.|4 = }}

Different formulations of "Catch-22" appear throughout the novel. The term is applied to various loopholes and quirks of the military system, always with the implication that rules are inaccessible to and slanted against those lower in the hierarchy. In chapter 6, Yossarian (the pilot) is told that Catch-22 requires him to do anything his [[commanding officer]] tells him to do, regardless of whether these orders contradict orders from the officer's superiors.&lt;ref name=Henriksen&gt;Margot A. Henriksen, ''Dr. Strangelove's America: Society and Culture in the Atomic Age''; University of California Press, 1997; {{ISBN|0-520-08310-5}}; p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=KGrsQOIQgeYC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA250#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 250].&lt;/ref&gt;

In a final episode, Catch-22 is described to Yossarian by an old woman recounting an act of violence by soldiers:&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.answers.com/topic/joseph-heller Joseph Heller]", ''Gale Encyclopedia of Biography'', accessed via Answers.com, 16 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CombsNimmo /&gt;

{{quotation|"Catch-22 says they have a right to do anything we can't stop them from doing."

"What the hell are you talking about?" Yossarian shouted at her in bewildered, furious protest. "How did you know it was Catch-22? Who the hell told you it was Catch-22?"

"The soldiers with the hard white hats and clubs. The girls were crying. 'Did we do anything wrong?' they said. The men said no and pushed them away out the door with the ends of their clubs. 'Then why are you chasing us out?' the girls said. 'Catch 22,' the men said. All they kept saying was 'Catch-22, Catch-22.' What does it mean, Catch 22? What is Catch-22?"

"Didn't they show it to you?" Yossarian demanded, stamping about in anger and distress. "Didn't you even make them read it?"

"They don't have to show us Catch-22," the old woman answered. "The law says they don't have to."

"What law says they don't have to?"

"Catch-22."}}

According to literature professor Ian Gregson, the old woman's narrative defines "Catch-22" more directly as the "brutal operation of power", stripping away the "bogus sophistication" of the earlier scenarios.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Gregson, ''Character and Satire in Post War Fiction''; London: Continuum, 2006; {{ISBN|9781441130006}}; p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=e0qqaRTVt_sC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA38#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 38].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other appearances in the novel ===

Besides referring to an unsolvable logical [[dilemma]], Catch-22 is invoked to explain or justify the military bureaucracy. For example, in the first chapter, it requires Yossarian to sign his name to letters that he censors while he is confined to a hospital bed. One clause mentioned in chapter 10 closes a loophole in promotions, which one private had been exploiting to reattain the attractive rank of [[Private First Class]] after any promotion. Through [[courts-martial]] for going [[AWOL]], he would be busted in rank back to private, but Catch-22 limited the number of times he could do this before being sent to the stockade.

At another point in the book, a prostitute explains to Yossarian that she cannot marry him because he is crazy, and she will never marry a crazy man. She considers any man crazy who would marry a woman who is not a virgin. This closed logic loop clearly illustrated Catch-22 because by her logic, all men who refuse to marry her are sane and thus she would consider marriage; but as soon as a man agrees to marry her, he becomes crazy for wanting to marry a non-virgin, and is instantly rejected.

At one point, Captain Black attempts to press Milo into depriving [[Major Major Major Major|Major Major]] of food as a consequence of not signing a loyalty oath that Major Major was never given an opportunity to sign in the first place. Captain Black asks Milo, "You're not against Catch-22, are you?"

In chapter 40, Catch-22 forces Colonels Korn and Cathcart to promote Yossarian to Major and ground him rather than simply sending him home. They fear that if they do not, others will refuse to fly, just as Yossarian did.

=== Significance of the number 22 ===

{{main|Catch-22#Explanation of the novel's title|Catch-22}}
Heller originally wanted to call the phrase (and hence, the book) by other numbers, but he and his publishers eventually settled on 22. The number has no particular significance; it was chosen more or less for [[euphony]]. The title was originally ''Catch-18'', but Heller changed it after the popular ''[[Mila 18]]'' was published a short time beforehand.&lt;ref name="Aldridge1986" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Telegraph /&gt;

== Usage ==

The term "catch-22" has filtered into common usage in the English language.&lt;ref name=OALD /&gt; In a 1975 interview, Heller said the term would not translate well into other languages.&lt;ref name=Telegraph&gt;"[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3669372/A-classic-by-any-other-name.html A classic by any other name]", ''The Telegraph'', 18 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

James E. Combs and Dan D. Nimmo suggest that the idea of a "catch-22" has gained popular currency because so many people in modern society are exposed to frustrating bureaucratic logic. They write:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Everyone, then, who deals with organizations understands the bureaucratic logic of Catch-22. In high school or college, for example, students can participate in student government, a form of self-government and democracy that allows them to decide whatever they want, just so long as the principal or dean of students approves. This bogus democracy that can be overruled by arbitrary fiat is perhaps a citizen's first encounter with organizations that may profess 'open' and libertarian values, but in fact are closed and hierarchical systems. Catch-22 is an organizational assumption, an unwritten law of informal power that exempts the organization from responsibility and accountability, and puts the individual in the absurd position of being excepted for the convenience or unknown purposes of the organization.&lt;ref name=CombsNimmo&gt;James E. Combs &amp; Dan D. Nimmo, ''The Comedy of Democracy''; Westport, CT: Praeger (Greenwood Publishing Group), 1996; {{ISBN|0-275-94979-6}}; p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=VJw9OdBFgmgC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA152#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 152].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Along with George Orwell's "[[doublethink]]", "Catch-22" has become one of the best-recognized ways to describe the predicament of being trapped by contradictory rules.&lt;ref&gt;Richard King, "[http://thesmartset.com/article/article07181101.aspx 22 Going on 50: Half a century later, the world is full of Catch-22s]"; ''The Smart Set'', 20 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

A significant type of definition of [[alternative medicine]] has been termed a catch-22. In a 1998 editorial co-authored by [[Marcia Angell]], a former editor of the ''[[The New England Journal of Medicine|New England Journal of Medicine]]'', argued that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"It is time for the scientific community to stop giving alternative medicine a free ride. There cannot be two kinds of medicine – conventional and alternative. There is only medicine that has been adequately tested and medicine that has not, medicine that works and medicine that may or may not work. Once a treatment has been tested rigorously, it no longer matters whether it was considered alternative at the outset. If it is found to be reasonably safe and effective, it will be accepted. But assertions, speculation, and testimonials do not substitute for evidence. Alternative treatments should be subjected to scientific testing no less rigorous than that required for conventional treatments."&lt;ref name= Angell1998&gt;{{cite journal |title= Alternative medicine--The risks of untested and unregulated remedies |last1= Angell |first1= M. |last2= Kassirer |first2= J.P. |authorlink= Marcia Angell |journal= [[New England Journal of Medicine]] |volume= 339 |issue= 12 |pages= 839–41 |year= 1998 |pmid= 9738094 |doi= 10.1056/NEJM199809173391210 |ref= harv|displayauthors= 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This definition has been described by [[Robert L. Park]] as a logical catch-22 which ensures that any [[Portal:Complementary and alternative medicine|Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)]] method which is proven to work "would no longer be CAM, it would simply be medicine."&lt;ref name=Park_Catch-22&gt;[[Robert L. Park|Park, Robert L.]], [http://bobpark.physics.umd.edu/WN02/wn032902.html Alternative Medicine: The Clinton Commission's Catch-22.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Logic ==

The [[Archetype|archetypal]] ''catch-22'', as formulated by [[Joseph Heller|Heller]], involves the case of [[John Yossarian]], a [[United States Army Air Corps|U.S. Army Air Forces]] [[Bombardier (air force)|bombardier]], who wishes to be grounded from combat flight. This will only happen if he is evaluated by the squadron's [[flight surgeon]] and found "unfit to fly". "Unfit" would be any pilot who is willing to fly such dangerous missions, as one would have to be [[Insanity|mad]] to volunteer for possible death. However, to be evaluated, he must ''request'' the evaluation, an act that is considered sufficient proof for being declared sane. These conditions make it impossible to be declared "unfit".

The "Catch-22" is that "anyone who wants to get out of combat duty isn't really crazy".&lt;ref name="Heller1999" /&gt; Hence, pilots who request a mental fitness evaluation ''are'' sane, and therefore must fly in combat. At the same time, if an evaluation is not requested by the pilot, he will never receive one and thus can never be found insane, meaning he must also fly in combat.

Therefore, Catch-22 ensures that no pilot can ever be grounded for being insane even if he is.

A logical formulation of this situation is:
{{Aligned table |cols=4
 |col1style=width:3.0em;text-align:center; |col2style=padding-right:1.0em; |col3style=width:47.0em;line-height:1.35em;padding-right:1.5em;
 | 1. | &lt;math&gt;(E \rightarrow (I \land R))&lt;/math&gt;
      | For a person to be excused from flying (E) on the grounds of insanity, they must both be insane (I) and have requested an evaluation (R). | ([[premise]])
 | 2. | &lt;math&gt;(I \rightarrow \neg R)&lt;/math&gt;
      | An insane person (I) does not request an evaluation (¬R) because they do not realize they are insane. | (premise)
 | 3. | &lt;math&gt;(\neg I \lor \neg R)&lt;/math&gt;
      | Either a person is not insane (¬I) or does not request an evaluation (¬R). | {{nowrap|(2. and [[Material implication (rule of inference)|material implication]])}}
 | 4. | &lt;math&gt;(\neg (I \land R))&lt;/math&gt;
      | No person can be both insane (I) and request an evaluation (R). | (3. and [[De Morgan's laws]])
 | 5. | &lt;math&gt;(\neg E)&lt;/math&gt;
      | Therefore, no person can be excused from flying (¬E) because no person can be both insane and have requested an evaluation. | (4., 1. and ''[[modus tollens]]'')
}}

The philosopher [[Laurence Goldstein (philosopher)|Laurence Goldstein]] argues that the "airman's dilemma" is logically not even a condition that is true under no circumstances; it is a "vacuous biconditional" that is ultimately meaningless. Goldstein writes:&lt;ref&gt;Laurence Goldstein, "[http://philpapers.org/rec/GOLTBR The Barber, Russell's paradox, catch-22, God, contradiction and more: A defence of a Wittgensteinian conception of contradiction]"; in ''The law of non-contradiction: new philosophical essays'', ed. Graham Priest, Jc Beall &amp; Bradley Armour-Garb; Oxford University Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|The catch is this: what looks like a statement of the conditions under which an airman can be excused flying dangerous missions reduces not to the statement

:(i) 'An airman can be excused flying dangerous missions if and only if Cont' (where 'Cont' is a contradiction)  
 
(which could be a mean way of disguising an unpleasant truth), but to the worthlessly empty announcement 
 
:(ii) 'An airman can be excused flying dangerous missions if and only if it is not the case that an airman can be excused flying dangerous missions' 
 
If the catch were (i), that would not be so bad—an airman would at least be able to discover that under no circumstances could he avoid combat duty. But Catch-22 is worse—a welter of words that amounts to nothing; it is without content, it conveys no information at all.}}

'''Christian values''' historically refers to the [[value (personal and cultural)|values]] derived from the [[teachings of Jesus]] Christ and taught by [[Christians]] throughout the history of the religion. The term has various applications and meanings, and specific definitions can vary widely between [[Christian denominations|denominations]], geographical locations, and different schools of thought.

The terms "Christian values" and "family values" are often used as a euphemism for [[Familialism]] by the [[Christian right]].&lt;ref name="SimkinsRisch2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ronald Simkins|author2=Gail S. Risch|title=Religion and the Family|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2QASRyYixtEC|date=1 March 2008|publisher=Fordham Univ Press|isbn=978-1-881871-49-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EdgellDocka2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Edgell|first1=Penny|last2=Docka|first2=Danielle|title=Beyond the Nuclear Family?

==New Testament teaching==
The [[life of Jesus in the New Testament|biblical teachings of Jesus]] include:&lt;ref&gt;''The Holy Bible'', King James Version, Meridian, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Great Commandment#Love the Lord thy God|Love of God and Neighbors]]: "You shall love the Lord your God with all of your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might." (an excerpt from the [[Shema]] Deut.6:5), -Matthew 22:37  This is the first half of the statement, and the second half, given equal weight, is "love your neighbor as yourself" upon which hang all the Law and all the prophets. -[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+22%3A36-40 Matthew 22:36-40]
*[[Christian views on marriage|Fidelity in marriage]]: "Whom God has joined together let no man put asunder", derived from -Matthew 19:6
*[[Evangelical counsels|Renunciation of worldly goods]]: "Gather not your riches up upon this earth, for there your heart will be also", (Matthew 6:21)
*[[Christian pacifism|Renunciation of vengeance]]: "If a man strikes you on one cheek, [[turning the other cheek|turn the other cheek]]", (Luke 6:29)
*[[Christian views on sin|Forgiveness of sins]]: "Forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us", (Matthew 6:12)
*[[Unconditional love]]: "[[Matthew 5:44|Love your enemies]] and [[Lord's Prayer|pray]] for those who persecute you." (Luke 6:27-28)

Explicit directions in the New Testament text include:

* Jesus' enumeration of the intention of the 10 commandments, contained in the [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%205-7 sermon on the mount] is considered [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%205-7 a key component of Christian ethics and a fundamental recipe for Christian conduct for centuries.]  This large unified text was meant as a counter to the practices of the day that followed the letter of the law but denied the spirit of the law.
* One of the characteristic contrasts between Christianity and its Jewish roots occurs along the axis of "Law". The Christian holds that for un-redeemed mankind it is [[Total depravity|impossible to follow]] any holy law at all, and further holds that only regeneration makes it possible for an individual to start and persist not breaking at least some of the body of holy law.  Within this context falls the only letter from the totality of New Testament authorship to the totality of the Christian church on that topic.  It is also profoundly important to recognize that these are "placeholders" that refer to Old Testament texts which more completely elaborate what each means. Acts 15:24 enumerates the four things that Christianity requires abstinence from: 1) food sacrificed to idols, 2) blood, 3) meat of strangled animals, and 4) sexual immorality. These all were part of the practices included in the [[polytheism]] of Greek and Roman civilizations.

==Modern use in worldwide conservative or center-right politics==
In the 21st century United States, Australia, UK and other countries, the phrases "Christian values" and "[[family values]]" are used by [[Christian right]] and conservative parties to describe some or all of the following political stances:
*[[censorship]] of sexual content, especially in movies and on television.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory D. Black, ''Hollywood Censored'', p. 39. "Daniel Lord drafted a Hollywood censorship code. What emerged was a fascinating combination of conservative politics, Catholic theology, and pop psychology.", Cambridge University Press, 1994, {{ISBN|978-0521452991}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*the desirability of laws against induced [[abortion]]
*[[sexual abstinence]] outside [[marriage]] and [[abstinence-only sex education]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldcongress.nl/en/wcf-ii-geneva-declaration/,"Marriage between a man and a woman forms the sole moral context for natural sexual union. Whether through pornography, promiscuity, incest or homosexuality, deviations from these sexual norms cannot truly satisfy the human spirits."&lt;/ref&gt;
*the promotion of [[intelligent design]] to be taught in public schools and colleges as an alternative to evolution.&lt;ref&gt;"Political commentators have noted the rise of the religious right during the presidency of George W. Bush. Though Christianity and politics have often been intertwined in American culture, the Bush administration funded faith-based initiatives more profoundly than any previous president. Moreover, President Bush remarked that he supported the teaching of intelligent design alongside evolutionary theory in public schools." http://connection.ebscohost.com/science/intelligent-design/intelligent-design-movements-us&lt;/ref&gt;
*the desirability of laws against [[same-sex marriage]]
*support for laws against the acceptance of homosexuality into mainstream society&lt;ref&gt;"The Bible clearly condemns homosexuality as a sin and Christians who seriously follow God's Word must also condemn it as sin.", http://carm.org/write-about-homsexuality&lt;/ref&gt;
*the desirability of organized [[school prayer]] in public schools&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prayer InPublic School - A Brief History|url=http://www.allabouthistory.org/prayer-in-public-school.htm|publisher=AllAboutHistory.org|accessdate=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern use in worldwide liberal or center-left politics==
In the 21st century United States, Australia, UK and other countries, the phrases "Christian values" and "[[family values]]" are used by some liberal or social democratic political groups to describe some or all of the following political stances:
*support for a culture of empathy and [[compassion]], seen as central to Christianity among a diverse range of religions and worldviews; favoring individuals, families (of all compositions) and small communities' interests over the interests of large corporations and the powerful;
*protection of the [[natural environment|environment]] as the product of a deep reverence for God's creation;
*the undesirability of [[war]] other than as a last resort, and a respect for diplomacy (see [[Swords to ploughshares]]);
*embrace inclusion and acceptance of [[immigrants]] and [[refugees]]
*a [[living wage]] for all and the right of workers to form trade unions as keeping with the solidaristic nature of man. 
*a high, progressive income tax to promote greater income equality in keeping with Jesus' words in support of the [[poverty|poor]] and against excessive riches;
*promoting [[Render unto Caesar]] as an endorsement of secular governance [[separation of church and state]] (secular laws do not affect or no relations with religious freedom, such as [[same-sex marriage]], churches can reject holding weddings for same-sex couples) and religious tolerance, consistent with the concept of Christ's kingdom not being "of this world" and warnings against the hunger for potentially corrupting temporal power throughout the Bible.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13904">In [[projective geometry]], a '''collineation''' is a one-to-one and onto map (a [[bijection]]) from one [[projective space]] to another, or from a projective space to itself, such that the images of [[collinear]] points are themselves collinear. A collineation is thus an ''[[isomorphism]]'' between projective spaces, or an [[automorphism]] from a projective space to itself. Some authors restrict the definition of collineation to the case where it is an automorphism.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, {{harvnb|Beutelspacher|Rosenbaum|1998|loc=p.21}}, {{harvnb|Casse|2006|loc=p. 56}} and {{harvnb|Yale|2004|loc=p. 226}}&lt;/ref&gt; The set of all collineations of a space to itself form a [[group (mathematics)|group]], called the '''collineation group'''.

==Definition==
Simply, a collineation is a one-to-one map from one projective space to another, or from a projective space to itself, such that the images of collinear points are themselves collinear. One may formalize this using various ways of presenting a projective space. Also, the case of the projective line is special, and hence generally treated differently.

===Linear algebra===
For a projective space defined in terms of linear algebra (as the projectivization of a vector space), a collineation is a map between the projective spaces that is [[order-preserving]] with respect to inclusion of subspaces.

Formally, let ''V'' be a vector space over a field ''K'' and ''W'' a vector space over a field ''L''.  Consider the projective spaces ''PG''(''V'') and ''PG''(''W''), consisting of the [[vector line]]s of ''V'' and ''W''.  
Call ''D''(''V'') and ''D''(''W'') the set of subspaces of ''V'' and ''W'' respectively.  A collineation from ''PG''(''V'') to ''PG''(''W'') is a map α : ''D''(''V'') → ''D''(''W''), such that:
* α is a bijection.
* ''A'' ⊆ ''B'' ⇔ α(''A'') ⊆ α(''B'') for all ''A'', ''B'' in ''D''(''V'').&lt;ref&gt;Geometers still commonly use an exponential type notation for functions and this condition will often appear as ''A'' ⊆ ''B'' ⇔ ''A''&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt; ⊆ ''B''&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt; for all ''A'', ''B'' in ''D''(''V'').&lt;/ref&gt;

===Axiomatically===
Given a [[Projective space#Axioms for projective space|projective space defined axiomatically]] in terms of an [[incidence structure]] (a set of points ''P,'' lines ''L,'' and an [[incidence relation]] ''I'' specifying which points lie on which lines, satisfying certain axioms), a collineation between projective spaces thus defined then being a bijective function ''f'' between the sets of points and a bijective function ''g'' between the set of lines, preserving the incidence relation.&lt;ref&gt;"Preserving the incidence relation" means that if point {{math|''p''}} is on line {{math|''l''}} then {{math|''f''(''p'')}} is in {{math|''g''(''l'')}}; formally, if {{math|(''p'', ''l'') ∈ ''I''}} then {{math|(''f''(''p''), ''g''(''l'')) ∈ ''I''′}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Every projective space of dimension greater than or equal to three is isomorphic to the [[projectivization]] of a linear space over a [[division ring]], so in these dimensions this definition is no more general than the linear-algebraic one above, but in dimension two there are other projective planes, namely the [[non-Desarguesian plane]]s, and this definition permits one to define collineations in such projective planes.

For dimension one, the set of points lying on a single projective line defines a projective space, and the resulting notion of collineation is just any bijection of the set.

===Collineations of the projective line===
For a projective space of dimension one (a projective line; the projectivization of a vector space of dimension two), all points are collinear, so the collineation group is exactly the [[symmetric group]] of the points of the projective line. This is different from the behavior in higher dimensions, and thus one gives a more restrictive definition, specified so that the [[#Fundamental theorem of projective geometry|fundamental theorem of projective geometry]] holds.

In this definition, when ''V'' has dimension two, a collineation from ''PG''(''V'') to ''PG''(''W'') is a map {{nowrap|''α'' : ''D''(''V'') → ''D''(''W'')}}, such that:
* The [[zero object (algebra)|zero subspace]] of ''V'' is mapped to the zero subspace of ''W''.
* ''V'' is mapped to ''W''.
* There is a nonsingular [[semilinear map]] ''β'' from ''V'' to ''W'' such that, for all ''v'' in ''V'',
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha(\langle v\rangle)=\langle \beta(v)\rangle&lt;/math&gt;
This last requirement ensures that collineations are all semilinear maps.

==Types==
The main examples of collineations are  projective linear transformations (also known as [[homography|homographies]]) and [[#Automorphic collineations|automorphic collineations]]. For projective spaces coming from a linear space, the [[#Fundamental theorem of projective geometry|fundamental theorem of projective geometry]] states that all collineations are a combination of these, as described below.
&lt;!-- This illustrates the pitfall of not restricting the definition of collineation. Correlations are not automorphisms of the projective space.

A [[duality (projective geometry)|duality]] is a collineation from a projective space onto its dual space, taking points to hyperplanes (and vice versa) and preserving incidence. A [[correlation (projective geometry)|correlation]] is a duality from a projective space onto itself (this implies that the space is self-dual). A [[pole and polar|polarity]] is an [[involution (mathematics)|involutory]] correlation.
--&gt;

===Projective linear transformations===

Projective linear transformations (homographies) are collineations (planes in a vector space correspond to lines in the associated projective space, and linear transformations map planes to planes, so projective linear transformations map lines to lines), but in general not all collineations are projective linear transformations. PGL is in general a proper subgroup of the collineation group.

===Automorphic collineations===
An '''{{Visible anchor|automorphic collineation}}''' is a map that, in coordinates, is a [[field automorphism]] applied to the coordinates.

==Fundamental theorem of projective geometry==
{{see also|Homography#Fundamental theorem of projective geometry}}
If the geometric dimension of a [[Pappus's hexagon theorem|pappian]] projective space is at least 2, then every collineation is the product of a homography (a projective linear transformation) and an automorphic collineation. More precisely, the collineation group is the [[projective semilinear group]], which is the [[semidirect product]] of homographies by automorphic collineations.

In particular, the collineations of {{nowrap|PG(2, '''R''')}} are exactly the homographies, as '''R''' has no nontrivial automorphisms (that is, Gal('''R'''/'''Q''') is trivial).

Suppose ''φ'' is a nonsingular semilinear map from ''V'' to ''W'', with the dimension of ''V'' at least three.  Define {{nowrap|''α'' : ''D''(''V'') → ''D''(''W'')}} by saying that {{nowrap|1=''Z''&lt;sup&gt;''α''&lt;/sup&gt; = { ''φ''(''z'') {{!}} ''z'' ∈ ''Z'' }{{null}}}} for all ''Z'' in ''D''(''V''). As ''φ'' is semilinear, one easily checks that this map is properly defined, and further more, as ''φ'' is not singular, it is bijective.  It is obvious now that ''α'' is a collineation.  We say that ''α'' is induced by ''φ''.

The fundamental theorem of projective geometry states the converse:

Suppose ''V'' is a vector space over a field ''K'' with dimension at least three, ''W'' is a vector space over a field ''L'', and ''α'' is a collineation from PG(''V'') to PG(''W'').  This implies ''K'' and ''L'' are isomorphic fields, ''V'' and ''W'' have the same dimension, and there is a semilinear map ''φ'' such that ''φ'' induces ''α''.

For {{nowrap|''n'' ≥ 3}}, the collineation group is the [[projective semilinear group]], P&amp;Gamma;L – this is PGL, twisted by [[field automorphism]]s; formally, the [[semidirect product]] {{nowrap|P&amp;Gamma;L ≅ PGL ⋊ Gal(''K''/''k'')}}, where ''k'' is the [[prime field]] for ''K''.

===Linear structure===
Thus for ''K'' a prime field (&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_p&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt;), we have {{nowrap|1=PGL = P&amp;Gamma;L}}, but for ''K'' not a prime field (such as &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_{p^n}&lt;/math&gt; for {{nowrap|''n'' ≥ 2}} or &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;), the projective linear group is in general a proper subgroup of the collineation group, which can be thought of as "transformations preserving a projective ''semi''-linear structure". Correspondingly, the quotient group {{nowrap|P&amp;Gamma;L / PGL ≅ Gal(''K''/''k'')}} corresponds to "choices of linear structure", with the identity (base point) being the existing linear structure. Given a projective space without an identification as the projectivization of a linear space, there is no natural isomorphism between the collineation group and PΓL, and the choice of a linear structure (realization as projectivization of a linear space) corresponds to a choice of subgroup {{nowrap|PGL &lt; P&amp;Gamma;L}}, these choices forming a [[torsor]] over Gal(''K''/''k'').

==History==
The idea of a [[line (geometry)|line]] was abstracted to a [[ternary relation]] determined by [[collinearity]] (points lying on a single line).   According to [[Wilhelm Blaschke]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Felix Klein]] (1926, 1949) ''Vorlesungen über Höhere Geometrie'', edited by Blaschke, Seite 138&lt;/ref&gt; it was [[August Möbius]] that first abstracted this essence of geometrical transformation:
:What do our geometric transformations mean now? Möbius threw out and fielded this question already in his ''Barycentric Calculus'' (1827). There he spoke not of ''transformations'' but of ''permutations'' [Verwandtschaften], when he said two elements drawn from a domain were ''permuted'' when they were interchanged by an arbitrary equation. In our particular case, linear equations between homogeneous point coordinates, Möbius called a permutation [Verwandtschaft] of both point spaces in particular a ''collineation''. This signification would be changed later by [[Michel Chasles|Chasles]] to ''homography''. Möbius’ expression is immediately comprehended when we follow Möbius in calling points [[collinear]] when they lie on the same line. Möbius' designation can be expressed by saying, collinear points are mapped by a permutation to collinear points, or in plain speech, straight lines stay straight.
Contemporary mathematicians view geometry as an [[incidence structure]] with an [[automorphism group]] consisting of mappings of the underlying space that preserve [[incidence (geometry)|incidence]]. Such a mapping permutes the lines of the incidence structure, and the notion of collineation persists.

As mentioned by Blaschke and Klein, [[Michel Chasles]] preferred the term ''homography'' to ''collineation''. A distinction between the terms arose when the distinction was clarified between the [[real projective plane]] and the [[complex projective line]]. Since there are no non-trivial field automorphisms of the [[real number]] field, all the collineations are homographies in the real projective plane.,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Casse|2006|loc=p. 64, Corollary 4.29}}&lt;/ref&gt; however due to the field automorphism [[complex conjugation]], not all collineations of the complex projective line are homographies. In applications such as [[computer vision]] where the underlying field is the real number field, ''homography'' and ''collineation'' can be used interchangeably.

==Anti-homography==
The operation of taking the [[complex conjugate]] in the [[complex plane]] amounts to a [[reflection (mathematics)|reflection]] in the [[real line]].  With the notation ''z''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; for the conjugate of ''z'', an '''anti-homography''' is given by
:&lt;math&gt;f(z) = \frac {a z^* + b}{c z^* + d}.&lt;/math&gt;
Thus an anti-homography is the composition of conjugation with an [[homography]], and so is an example of a collineation which is not an homography. For example, geometrically, the mapping &lt;math&gt;f(z) = 1/z^*&lt;/math&gt; amounts to [[inversive geometry#Circle inversion|circle inversion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morley|Morley|1933|loc=p. 38}}&lt;/ref&gt; The transformations of [[inversive geometry]] of the plane are frequently described as the collection of all homographies and anti-homographies of the complex plane.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Blair|2000}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=sxHKpaAuclgC&amp;pg=PA43 p.&amp;nbsp;43]; {{harvnb|Schwerdtfeger|2012}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4XE2_AqxYVkC&amp;pg=PA42 p.&amp;nbsp;42].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Contextual integrity''' is a theory of privacy developed by professor [[Helen Nissenbaum]] and presented in her book ''Privacy In Context: Technology, Policy, and the Integrity of Social Life''.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Nissenbaum, Privacy in Context, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Contextual Integrity comprises four essential descriptive claims:

* Privacy is provided by appropriate flows of information.
* Appropriate information flows are those that conform with contextual information norms
* Contextual informational norms refer to five independent parameters: data subject, sender, recipient, information type, and transmission principle
* Conceptions of privacy are based on ethical concerns that evolve over time

Contextual Integrity can be seen as a reaction to theories that define privacy as control over information about oneself, as secrecy, or as regulation of personal information that is private, or sensitive.

This places contextual integrity at odds with privacy regulation based on [[Fair Information Practice Principles]]; it also does not line up with the 1990s [[Cypherpunk]] view that newly discovered [[cryptographic]] techniques would assure privacy in the digital age because preserving privacy is not a matter of stopping any data collection, or blocking all flows of information, minimizing data flow, or by stopping information leakage.

The fourth essential claim comprising Contextual Integrity gives privacy its ethical standing and allows for the evolution and alteration of informational norms, often due to novel sociotechnical systems.  It holds that practices and norms can be evaluated in terms of:
* Effects on the interests and preferences of affected parties 
* How well they sustain ethical and political (societal) principles and values
* How well they promote contextual functions, purposes, and values.

The most distinctive of these considerations is the third. As such, Contextual Integrity highlights the importance of privacy not only for individuals, but for society and respective social domains.

==Contextual Integrity’s Parameters==

The “contexts” of contextual integrity are social domains, intuitively, health, finance, marketplace, family, civil and political, etc. The five critical parameters that are singled out to describe data transfer operation are:

# The data subject
# The sender of the data
# The recipient of the data
# The information type
# The transmission principle.

Some illustrations of contextual informational norms in western societies, include:
* In a job interview, an interviewer is forbidden from asking a candidate’s religious affiliation
* A priest may not share congregants’ confession with anyone
* A U.S. citizen is obliged to reveal gross income to the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]], under conditions of confidentiality except as required by law
* One may not share a friend’s confidences with others, except, perhaps, with one’s spouse
* Parents should monitor their children’s academic performance

Examples of data subjects include patient, shopper, investor, or reader.  Examples of information senders include a bank, police, advertising network, or a friend. Examples of data recipients include a bank, the police, a friend. Examples of information types include the contents of an email message, the data subject’s demographic information, biographical information, medical information, and financial information. Examples of transmission principles include consent, coerced, stolen, buying, selling, confidentiality, stewardship, acting under the authority of a court with a warrant, and national security.

A key thesis is that assessing the privacy impact of information flows requires the values of all five parameters to be specified. Nissenbaum has found that access control rules not specifying the five parameters are incomplete and can lead to problematic ambiguities.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, K and Helen Nissenbaum. "What is private about ‘public’ records data?" ''Targeted Submission: Fall Law Reviews''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nissenbaum notes that the some kinds of language can lead one’s analysis astray. For example, when the passive voice is used to describe the movement of data, it allows the speaker to gloss over the fact that there is an active agent performing the data transfer. For example, the sentence “Alice had her identity stolen” allows the speaker to gloss over the fact that someone or something did the actual stealing of Alice’s identity. If we say that “Carol was able to find Bob’s bankruptcy records because they had been placed online”, we are implicitly ignoring the fact that someone or some organization did the actual collection of the bankruptcy records from a court and the placing of those records online.

==Example==
Consider the norm: “US residents are required by law to file tax returns with the US Internal Revenue Service containing information, such as, name, address, SSN, gross earnings, etc. under conditions of strict confidentiality.”


Data Subject: A US resident

Sender: The same US resident

Recipient: The US Internal Revenue Service

Information type: tax information

Transmission principle: the recipient will hold the information in strict confidentiality.


Given this norm, we can evaluate a hypothetical scenario and see if it violates the contextual integrity norm:

Hypothetical: “The US Internal Revenue Service agrees to supply Alice’s tax returns to the city newspaper as requested by a journalist at the paper.”

This hypothetical clearly violates contextual integrity because the providing the tax information to the local newspaper would violate the transmission principle under which the information was obtained.

==Technical Applications of Contextual Integrity==
In 2006 Barth, Datta, Mitchell and Nissenbaum presented a formal language that could be used to reason about the privacy rules in privacy law.  They analyzed the privacy provisions of the Grahm Leach Biley act and showed how to translate some of its principles into the formal language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barth|first1=Adam|last2=Datta|first2=Anupam|last3=Mitchell|first3=John|last4=Nissenbaum|first4=Helen|title=Privacy and Contextual Integrity: Framework and Applications|journal=Proceedings of the 2006 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy|date=2006|pages=184–198|doi=10.1109/SP.2006.32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[psychology]], '''desensitization''' is defined as the diminished [[Emotion|emotional]] responsiveness to a negative, aversive or positive stimulus after repeated exposure to it. It also occurs when an emotional response is repeatedly evoked in situations in which the action tendency that is associated with the emotion proves irrelevant or unnecessary. The process of desensitization was developed by [[psychologist]] [[Mary Cover Jones]], and is primarily used to assist individuals in unlearning [[Phobia|phobias]] and [[Anxiety|anxieties]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stolerman|first=Ian|title=Encyclopedia of Psychopharmacology|year=2010|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin Heidelberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;T.L. Brink (2008) Psychology: A Student Friendly Approach. "[http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/TLBrink_PSYCH06.pdf Unit 6: Learning]." pp. 101&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Wolpe]] (1958) developed a method of a hierarchal list of anxiety evoking stimuli in order of intensity, which allows individuals to undergo adaption.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|last=Coon|title=Psychology: A Journey|year=2008|publisher=Thomson Wadsworth Corporation|location=USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although medication is available for individuals suffering from anxiety, [[fear]] or phobias, [[empirical evidence]] supports desensitization with high rates of cure, particularly in clients suffering from depression or [[schizophrenia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nemeroff|first=C.B.|title=The Corsini Encyclopedia of Psychology and Behavioral Science|year=2001|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Steps ==
The hierarchical list is constructed between client and therapist in rank ordered series of steps from the least disturbing to the most disturbing fears or phobias. Secondly the client is taught techniques that produce deep relaxation. It is impossible to feel both anxiety and relaxation at the same time{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}, so easing the client into deep relaxation helps inhibit any feelings of anxiety. [[Systematic desensitization]] (a guided reduction in fear, anxiety or aversion) can then be achieved by gradually approaching the feared stimulus while maintaining relaxation. Desensitization works best when individuals are directly exposed to the stimuli and situations they fear so anxiety-evoking stimuli are paired with inhibitory responses. This is carried out either by clients performing in real life situations (known as vivo desensitization), or, if it is not practical to directly act out the steps of hierarchy, by clients observing models performing the feared behaviour (known as vicarious desensitization). Clients slowly move up the hierarchy, repeating performances if necessary, until the last item on the list is performed without fear or anxiety.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

{{Main|Sacking out}}
Animals can also be desensitized to their rational or irrational fears. A [[race horse]] who fears the [[starting gate]] can be desensitized to the fearful elements (the creak of the gate, the starting bell, the enclosed space) one at a time, in small doses or at a distance. Clay et al. (2009) conducted an experiment whereby he allocated rhesus macaques to either a desensitization group or a control group, finding that those in the desensitization group showed a significant reduction in both the rate and duration of fearful behavior. This supports the use of [[PRT training]].

Desensitization also refers to the potential for reduced responsiveness to actual violence [[Research_on_the_effects_of_violence_in_mass_media|caused by exposure to violence in the media]], although this topic is debated in the scientific literature on the topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Freedman|first=J.L.|title=Media Violence and its effect on aggression: assessing the scientific evidence|year=2003|publisher=University of Toronto Press Incorporated.|location=Canada|jstor=10.3138/j.ctt1287sxj}}&lt;/ref&gt; Desensitization may arise from different sources of media, including TV, video games and movies. Some scholars suggest that violence may prime thoughts of hostility, with the possibility of affecting the way we perceive others and interpret their actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Paludi|first=M.A.|title=The Psychology of Teen Violence and Victimization|year=2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO, LLC.|location=USA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gubler|first1=Joshua R.||last2=Kalmoe|first2=Nathan P.|last3=Wood|first3=David A.|title=Them's Fightin' Words: The Effects of Violent Rhetoric on Ethical Decision Making in Business|journal=Journal of Business Ethics|date=September 2015|volume=130|issue=3|pages=705|doi=10.1007/s10551-014-2256-y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gubler|first1=Joshua R.||last2=Herrick|first2=Skye H. |last3=Price|first3=Richard P.|last4=Wood|first4=David A.|title=Violence, Aggression, and Ethics: The Link Between Exposure to Human Violence and Unethical Behavior|journal=Journal of Business Ethics|date=October 2015|doi=10.1007/s10551-015-2926-4|volume=147|pages=25–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is hypothesized that initial exposure to violence in the media may produce a number of aversive responses such as increased heart rate, fear, discomfort, perspiration and disgust. However, prolonged and repeated exposure to violence in the media may reduce or habituate the initial psychological impact until violent images do not elicit these negative responses. Eventually the observer may become emotionally and [[Cognition|cognitively]] desensitized to media violence. In one experiment, participants who played violent video games showed lower heart rate and [[Electrodermal activity|galvanic skin response]] readings, which the authors interpreted as displaying a physiological desensitization to violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gentile|first=D.A.|title=Media Violence and children: a complete guide for parents and professionals|year=2003|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group Inc.|location=U.S.A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other studies have failed to replicate this finding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0068382|pmid=23844191|title=Failure to Demonstrate That Playing Violent Video Games Diminishes Prosocial Behavior|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=8|issue=7|pages=e68382|year=2013|last1=Tear|first1=Morgan J.|last2=Nielsen|first2=Mark|pmc=3700923}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1037/a0030119|title=Comfortably numb or just yet another movie?

'''Dosing''' generally applies to feeding [[chemical]]s or [[medicine]]s when used in small quantities.

For medicines the term ''[[dose (biochemistry)|dose]]'' is generally used. In the case of inanimate objects the word dosing is typical. The term '''dose titration''', referring to stepwise [[titration|adjustment]] of doses until a desired level of effect is reached, is common in [[medicine]].

==Engineering==
The word ''dosing'' is very commonly used by [[engineer]]s in thermal [[power stations]], in water treatment, in any industry where [[steam]] is being generated, and in [[building services]] for heating and cooling water treatment. Dosing procedures are also in vogue in [[textile]] and similar industries where chemical treatment is involved.

Commercial [[Swimming pool sanitation#Systems and disinfection methods|swimming pool]]s also require chemical dosing in order to control [[pH]] balance, [[chlorine]] level, and other such water quality criteria. Modern swimming pool plant will have bulk storage of chemicals held in separate '''dosing tanks''', and will have automated controls and '''dosing pumps''' to top up the various chemicals as required to control the water quality.

In a power station treatment chemicals are injected or fed to [[boiler]] and also to feed and make up water under [[pressure]], but in small dosages or rate of [[Injection (medicine)|injection]]. The feeding at all places is done by means of small capacity dosing [[pump]]s specially designed for the duty demanded.

In building services the water quality of various pumped fluid systems, including for heating, cooling, and condensate water, will be regularly checked and topped up with chemicals manually as required to suit the required water quality. Most commonly [[Corrosion inhibitor|inhibitor]]s will be added to protect the pipework and components against corrosion, or a [[biocide]] will be added to stop the growth of bacteria in lower temperature systems. The required chemicals will be added to the fluid system by use of a '''dosing pot'''; a multi-valved chamber in which the chemical can be added, and then introduced to the fluid system in a controlled manner.

In food industries, the dosing of ingredients is particularly important in order to ensure the quality of the recipe as well as its food safety where the consumers' health may be directly implicated. Dosing is done in wet processes with dosing pumps but even more importantly in dry processes, just prior to the packaging of the product. Dosing of dry materials is commonly done through Gain-in-Weight dosing or Loss-in-Weight dosing using equipments on load cells.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.powderprocess.net/Dosing.html Source on dosing principles for dry ingredients&lt;/ref&gt;

==Agriculture==
The feeding of chemicals in [[agriculture]] has also become common due to technology developments. However agricultural dosing is done by means of hand held pressure spray pumps.

===Aerial spraying===
Sometimes aerial spraying of chemicals by fixed quantities at intervals or dosing is also adopted for agricultural spraying or for atmospheric spraying for eliminating certain types of harmful [[insect]]s.

[[Sergei Eisenstein]] was briefly associated with the movement. 
== Eccentrism in theatre == 
In [[Russian language|Russian]], the word “eccentric” was used as a [[term of art]] for circus performers, referring to the tricks performed for the audience. In 1921 the young directors Grigory Kozintsev, Leonid Trauberg, Sergi Yutkevich, and Gregory Kryzhitsky formed the theatre workshop “factory of the eccentric actor” (Fabrika Ekstsentricheskogo Aktera, or FEKS), in [[Petrograd]]. It was one of a plethora of avant-garde artists groupings blossoming in this period which attempted to respond to the faster paces of modernity within the openings perceived after the 1917 revolution. FEKS in particular advocated “an illogical performance style modeled on the physicality of circus stunts,” as well as on the popularity of American cinema of the period, such as Charlie Chaplin.&lt;ref name="Nieland"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nieland|first1=Justus|title=Feeling Modern: The Eccentrisities of Public Life|date=2008|publisher=University of Illinois Press}} page 6.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The December 1921 manifesto of the eccentric theater “Ekstsentrism” pronounced: “1) for the actor—from emotion to the machine, from anguish to the trick. The technique—circus…. 2) for the director—a maximum of devices, a record number of inventions, a turbine of rhythms.  3) for the dramatist—a composer of tricks. 4) for the artist—decoration in jumps.”&lt;ref&gt;Grigory Kozintsev, Leonid Trauberg, Sergi Yutkevich, and Gregory Kryzhitsky, "Ekstsentrism," 1922, reprinted in {{cite book|editor1-last=Taylor|editor1-first=Richard|editor2-last=Christie|editor2-first=Ian|title=The Film Factory: Russian and Soviet Cinema in Documents 1896-1939|date=1988|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; In true Futurist fashion the manifesto demanded the abandonment of the old culture, and was handed out on the streets of St. Petersburg. 

In ''New Worlds, Russian Art and Society'', David Elliott states that “Eccentricism was a logical development from the alogical thought of the futurists. Artists introduced absurd elements or breaks in logic into their work in order to restructure and reorientate reality.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Elliot|first1=David|title=New Worlds, Russian Art and Society 1900-1937|date=1986|publisher=Rizzoli|page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1922 the main participants in FEKS expanded on the Eccentrist manifesto, and cited as parents of the movement, street language, circus posters, negro jazz bands, cinema, the music hall, the circus and boxing. Key to eccentrism in action was “synthesis of movements: acrobatic, gymnastic, balletic, constructivist-mechanical,” to give “the BASIC TEMPO of the epoch.”&lt;ref name ="TaylorandChristie"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Taylor|editor1-first=Richard|editor2-last=Christie|editor2-first=Ian|title=The Film Factory: Russian and Soviet Cinema in Documents 1896-1939|date=1988|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not till September 1922 that FEKS put on its first public performance, based loosely on Nikolai Gogol’s ''Wedlock'', but titled “Wedlock (Not from Gogol): A Stunt in Three Acts.”&lt;ref name ="SenekickandOstrovsky"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Senekick|editor1-first=Laurence|editor2-last=Ostrovsky|editor2-first=Sergei|title=The Soviet Theatre: A Documentary History|date=2014|publisher=Yale University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Playbill promised “Eccentrism presents: operetta, melodrama, farce, movies, circuses, variety, puppetry in a single performance!” According to contemporary reviews, the two main characters, scientists Albert and Einstein, “were played by circus eccentrics Serge and Taurek”, to “the utter delight of the audience.” “Eccentrism was the principle of organization of the entire spectacle,” with the actors joined by a dancer and a crowd of marchers.&lt;ref name="SenekickandOstrovsky" /&gt;

In “The Future of FEKS” of 1923, Sergy Radlov announced that, from this season, “FEKS will carry on work as an independent studio within the Petroproketkul’t” &lt;ref&gt;Sergy Radlov, “The Future of FEKS” ''Teatr'' 3 (1923), cited in Senekick and Ostrovsky (eds.), p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt; the Petrograd manifestation of the new Soviet Proletkult federation dedicated to revolutionary working class aesthetic production. It was in this form that the group produced the Cocteau-influenced "Foreign Trade on the Eiffel Tower" (1923). By then, the group included well-known theatrical figures such as, SG Martinson, FF Knorre, as well as the dancer and silent film actress Z. Tarkhovskaya. 

Despite the stated links with the circus, a sympathetic critic, Vladimir Nedobrovo, wrote in 1928 that “the Eccentrism of the FEKS is not the same as the eccentrism of the music hall” and is concerned with opening up stilted perception through “impeded form” and “alienation of the object” from its automatic state, a vision which owed something to Russian Formalist poetics.&lt;ref name="Taylor"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Taylor|first1=Richard|title=The Politics of the Soviet Cinema, 1917-1929|date=1979|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521088558}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yutkevich went further, and claimed its “aim was the final destruction of the bourgeois world.”&lt;ref name="Taylor" /&gt;

The young Sergi Eisenstein (then associated with the more mechanized aesthetic of Meyerhold’s acting workshop) was introduced to FEKS by Sergi Yutkevich in 1922. He was strongly under its influence when he produced his first major work for the theater, “The Montage of Attractions” (1923), and worked with Tretiakov on “The Wiseman,” shown in the Moscow Proletkult Theatre in 1923.&lt;ref name="Nieland" /&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Elliot|first1=David|title=New Worlds, Russian Art and Society 1900-1937|date=1986|publisher=Rizzoli|page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; While FEKS cited Chaplin’s cinema as an influence on their theater, and Eisenstein was influenced by FEKS theater in his later films, both took pains to distinguish the methods of fiction film from those of theater, unlike Meyerhold who moved to merge their styles. Viktor Shklovsky wrote of the impossible, unexpected, and “eccentric” effects in Eisenstein’s 1925 film, Strike.&lt;ref&gt;Shklovsky, Viktor, "Strike" (1922) in{{cite book|editor1-last=Christie|editor1-first=Ian|editor2-last=Gillett|editor2-first=John|title=Futurism / Formalism / FEKS: Eccentrism and Soviet Cinema, 1918-36|date=1978|publisher=British Film Institute|page=31-35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Eccentrism in film == 

Out of the FEKS theater, a new film-making group was being formed.&lt;ref name="TaylorandChristie" /&gt; They were concerned not just with “the selection of memorial moments” in the words of contemporary Russian Formalist critic Viktor Shklovsky, but “a new, non-automatic connection between them.” This paralleled Eisenstein’s ideas of a “montage of attraction.” The motivation behind this was summed up by Shklovsky in 1928: “Eccentrism is a struggle with the monotony of life, a rejection of its traditional conception and presentation.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=van den Oever|first1=Annie|title=Ostrannenie: On "strangeness" and the Moving Image|date=2010|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Eisenstein soon broke with eccentrism to theorize his notion of “the attraction” in theatre and film as including, but going beyond, the “stunt” and the “trick,” on their own, in favor of a structure based on the ideological reactions of the audience.&lt;ref&gt;Sergi Eisenstein, “The Montage of Attractions” in ''LEF'' no. 3, 1923, translated and reprinted in Taylor and Christie, p. 87-89.&lt;/ref&gt; Dziga Vertov was also to move beyond eccentrism in his work, declaring in his 1926 “The Factory of Facts” that cinema should be “Not a FEKS (the Leningrad Factory of the Eccentric Actor), nor Eisenstein’s ‘factory of attractions’” but “a factory of facts.”&lt;ref&gt;Dziga Vertov, 'The Factory of Facts' (1926), translated and reprinted in Taylor and Christie page 150-151.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Between 1924 and 1929 FEKS produced five films under the banner of eccentricism.&lt;ref name="Widdis"&gt;Widdis, Emma, “To Explore or Conquer?: On the Soviet Cultural Revolution,” in Evgeny Dobrenko and Eric Naiman (ed), ''The Landscape of Stalinism: The Art and Ideology of Soviet Space'', U Washington Press, 2003, p.222&lt;/ref&gt; At this point, the Soviet Cinema Week reported the FEKS collective as having twenty-five members, including Leonid Trauberg and Grigorii Kozintsev as co-directors, Hungarian communist Evgenii Enei as art director and the important addition of Andrei Moskvin as cinematographer/cameraman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Youngblood|first1=Denise J|title=Soviet Cinema in the Silent Era,|date=1991|publisher=U of Texas Press|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their films were famous for exaggerated body movements, comedic acting, and extrovert character psychology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beumers|first1=Birgit|title=A Companion to Russian Cinema|date=2016|publisher=Wiley Blackwell|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first FEKS film was the 1924 ''Pokhozhdeniya Oktyabriny'' (The Adventures of an Octoberite) an agitational spectacle featuring a farcical villain and a chase scene set in the cupula of Petrograd’s Saint Isaac’s Cathedral.&lt;ref name="Taylor" /&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pokhozhdeniya Oktyabriny|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0015240/|website=Internet Movie Database}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The film’s combination of comedic entertainment and propaganda received a positive reaction from audience and critics, but, “it marked the end of the FEKS passion for the bizarre as a self-sufficient artistic objective.”&lt;ref name="Cavendish"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cavendish|first1=Philip ,|title=The Men with the Movie Camera: The Poetics of Visual Style in Soviet Avant-Guard Cinema of the 1920s|date=2013|publisher=Berghahn Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In a following film, ''Chertovo kolesco'' (the Devil’s Wheel, 1926), a love scene unfolds on a switchback in front of a funfair.&lt;ref name="Taylor" /&gt; Kozintsev described their film as based on the idea that “everything must be active.”&lt;ref name="Widdis" /&gt; While the popular funfair background is enticing, and reflects the spirit of the FEKS manifesto, in the film the carnival is seen as a vacation from more serious Bolshevik pursuits of building a new world, and so can be seen as an ideological self-criticism of earlier FEKS fascinations.&lt;ref name="Widdis" /&gt;

The same could be said of the 1927 film S.V.D. where the “trickster” character served in the plot as a counter revolutionary bad character, questioning the solid identification of the FEKS aesthetic with the eccentric clown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Corrigan|first1=Maria|title=Eccentrism’s counter-rebel: the sign, the trickster and the end of FEKS|journal=Studies in Russian and Soviet Cinema|date=2017|volume=11|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In these films, technology was seen as on the side of a progressive [[modernism]], but by FEKS last film, the 1929 ''Novyi Vavilon'' (New Babylon) featuring the uprising and suppression of the [[Paris Commune]], impersonal machinery in the form of guns are on the side of oppression. In form, the sharp focus of ''Pokhozhdeniya Oktyabriny'' has given way to a diffuse cinematography using smoke, diffusion disks or Vaseline on the lens. The change in attitude towards the machine aesthetic parallels the degeneration of the Russian Revolution, and the film received an unfavorable critical reception.&lt;ref name="Taylor" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cavendish" /&gt;

== Eccentrism’s demise ==

In its development from the 1921 manifesto, Eccentrism was faced with many crossroads; the aesthetic traditions of popular theatrical entertainment and the new cinema; silent and sound film, and avant-garde experimentation and [[socialist realism]], all within the quickly changing ideas of the role of art in the 20s.&lt;ref&gt;Corrigan, Marina Natasha, (2015) “Soviet Eccentrism: A Can-Can on the Tightrope of Logic,” dissertation at University of California, Santa Barbara.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1928 film production was effectively subsumed under the control of the state, and the soviet government was increasingly under the bureaucratic control of Joseph Stalin. Eccentrism, as with many of the early Soviet Avant-Garde movements, was not to survive the move to the state-sponsored “Socialist Realism.” 
In the late 1940s and early 1950s, Grigory Kozintsev, a founding member of FEKS theatre who had moved to FEKS filmmaking, produced more conventional stagings of Shakespeare at the Pushkin Theater in Leningrad (formerly Petrograd). He later made movies of Don Quixote (1957) and Hamlet (1964).&lt;ref name="SenekickandOstrovsky" /&gt;

In [[economics]], an '''Edgeworth box''', named after [[Francis Ysidro Edgeworth]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last = Schotter |first = Andrew |year = 2008 |title = Microeconomics: A Modern Approach |publisher = [[Cengage Learning]] |isbn = 978-0-324-31584-4 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=oH--t0SX7nEC&amp;pg=PA524 |page = 524 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a way of representing various distributions of [[Resource (economics)|resources]]. Edgeworth made his presentation in his book ''Mathematical Psychics: An Essay on the Application of Mathematics to the Moral Sciences'', 1881.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author = Lluís Barbé |year = 2010 |title = Francis Ysidro Edgeworth: a portrait with family and friends |publisher = [[Edward Elgar Publishing]] |isbn = 978-1-84844-716-5 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=m93iASHrXnEC&amp;pg=PR12 |page = 12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Edgeworth's original two-axis depiction was developed into the now familiar box diagram by [[Vilfredo Pareto|Pareto]] in his 1906 book "Manual of Political Economy"&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/details/manualedieconomi00pareuoft&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.policonomics.com/edgeworth-box/&lt;/ref&gt; and was popularized in a later exposition by [[Arthur Lyon Bowley|Bowley]].
The modern version of the diagram is commonly referred to as the '''Edgeworth–Bowley box'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Humphrey |first1 = Thomas M. |title = Early History of the Box Diagram |journal = Economic Quarterly |url = https://www.richmondfed.org/~/media/richmondfedorg/publications/research/economic_quarterly/1996/winter/pdf/history.pdf |accessdate = 30 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Edgeworth box is used frequently in [[general equilibrium theory]]. It can aid in [[Representation (mathematics)|representing]] the [[competitive equilibrium]] of a simple system or a range of such outcomes that satisfy [[economic efficiency]]. It can also show the difficulty of moving to an efficient outcome in the presence of [[bilateral monopoly]].&lt;ref&gt;John Creedy, 2008. "Francis Ysidro (1845–1926)," ''[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]]'', 2nd Edition. [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_E000041&amp;edition=current&amp;q=edgeworth&amp;topicid=&amp;result_number=3 Abstract].&lt;/ref&gt; In the latter case, it serves as a precursor to the [[bargaining problem]] of [[game theory]] that allows a unique numerical solution.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Forbes Nash, Jr.|John F. Nash, Jr.]], 1950. "The Bargaining Problem," ''Econometrica'', 18(2),  pp. [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1907266 155-162].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roberto Serrano, 2008. "bargaining," ''[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]]'', 2nd Edition. [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_B000073&amp;edition=current&amp;q=bargaining&amp;topicid=&amp;result_number=1 Abstract].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example==
Imagine two people (Octavio and Abby) with a fixed amount of resources between the two of them &amp;mdash; say, 10 liters of water and 20 hamburgers.  If Abby takes 4 liters of water and 5 hamburgers, then Octavio is left with 6 liters of water and 15 hamburgers.  The Edgeworth box is a rectangular diagram with Octavio's [[Origin (mathematics)|origin]] on one corner (represented by the O) and Abby's origin on the opposite corner (represented by the A).  The width of the box is the total amount of one good, and the height is the total amount of the other good.  Thus, every possible division of the goods between the two people can be represented as a point in the box.

[[Indifference curve]]s (derived from each consumer's [[utility function]]) can be drawn in the box for both Abby and Octavio. The points on each person's indifference curve represent equally liked combinations of quantities of the two goods for that person. Hence Abby is indifferent between one combination of goods and another on any one of her indifference curves, and the same is true for Octavio. For example, Abby might value 1 liter of water and 13 hamburgers the same as 5 liters of water and 4 hamburgers, or 3 liters and 10 hamburgers. There are an infinite number of such curves that could be drawn among the combinations of goods for each consumer (Octavio or Abby).

With Octavio's origin (the point representing zero of each good) at the lower left corner of the Edgeworth box and with Abby's origin at the upper right corner, typically Octavio's indifference curves would be convex to his origin and Abby's would be convex to her origin.

When an indifference curve for Abby crosses one of the indifference curves for Octavio at more than one point (so the two curves are not tangent to each other), a space in the shape of a lens is created by the crossing of the two curves; any point in the interior of this lens represents an allocation of the two goods between the two people such that both people would be better off, since the point is on an indifference curve farther from both of their respective origins, and thus, each individual achieves a higher utility.

==Pareto set==

[[File:Contract-curve-on-edgeworth-box.svg|thumb|400px|right|Blue Pareto set (efficient locus) showing points of tangency of [[indifference curve]]s in an Edgeworth box]]

Wherever one of these curves for Abby happens to be [[tangent]] to a curve of Octavio's, a combination of the two goods is identified that yields both consumers a level of utility that could not be improved for one person by a reallocation without decreasing the utility of the other person. Such a combination of goods is said to be [[Pareto optimal]]. The set of tangential points of contact between pairs of indifference curves, if all traced out, will form a trace connecting Octavio's origin (O) to Abby's (A). This curve connecting points O and A, which will not in general be a straight line, is called the [[Pareto set]] or the efficient locus, since each point on the curve is Pareto optimal.

The vocabulary used to describe different objects which are part of the Edgeworth box diverges.  The entire Pareto set is sometimes called the [[contract curve]], while [[Andreu Mas-Colell|Mas-Colell]], Winston, and Green (1995) restrict the definition of the contract curve to only those points on the Pareto set which make both Abby and Octavio at least as well off as they are at their initial endowment.  Other authors who have a more [[game theory|game theoretical]] bent, such as Martin Osborne and [[Ariel Rubinstein]] (1994), use the term [[core (economics)|core]] for the section of the Pareto set which is at least as good for each consumer as the initial endowment.

In order to calculate the Pareto set, the slope of the indifference curves for both consumers must be calculated at each point.  That slope is the negative of the [[marginal rate of substitution]], so since the Pareto set is the set of points where both indifference curves are tangent, it is also the set of points where each consumer's marginal rate of substitution is equal to that of the other person.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3395">The '''end-of-the-day betting effect''' is a [[cognitive bias]] reflected in the tendency for bettors to take gambles with higher risk and higher reward at the end of their betting session to try to make up for losses. William McGlothlin (1956) and Mukhtar Ali (1977) first discovered this effect after observing the shift in betting patterns at horserace tracks. Mcglothlin and Ali noticed that people are significantly more likely to prefer longshots to conservative bets on the last race of the day. They found that the movement towards longshots, and away from favorites, is so pronounced that some studies show that conservatively betting on the favorite to show (to finish first, second, or third) in the last race is a profitable bet despite the track’s take.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ali|first=Mukhtar M.|year=1977|title=Probability and utility estimates for racetrack bettors|journal=Journal of Political Economy|volume=85|number=4|pages=803–815|doi=10.1086/260600}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McGlothlin|first=William H.|year=1956|title=Stability of choices among uncertain alternatives|journal=American Journal of Psychology|volume=69|number=4|pages=604–615|doi=10.2307/1419083}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Explanation==
[[Expected utility hypothesis]] cannot explain the shift in risk preferences across the day if bettors integrate their wealth because the last race of the day is not fundamentally different from the first. [[Prospect theory]] can explain the shift by assuming people open a mental account at the beginning of the day, close it at the end, and hate closing an account in the red.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kahneman|first=Daniel|last2=Tversky|first2=Amos|title=Choices, Values, and Frames. New York|publisher=Russell Sage Foundation|year=2000|page=296|isbn=978-0-521-62749-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The end-of-the-day betting effect is consistent with the [[risk aversion]]/[[risk seeking]] behaviors associated with prospect theory, which state that people are more likely to be risk averse in the case of gains and risk seeking in the case of losses. Prospect theory claims that people begin with zero daily profit as a reference point and gamble in the domain of losses to break even. Because the racetrack takes a hefty bite out of each dollar, most people are down money when the last races near. Anything below this target is regarded as a loss and triggers risk-seeking behavior in an attempt to break even. Diminishing sensitivity to successive losses means that the cost of the last bet is relatively trivial compared to what has already been spent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hardman|first=David|title=Judgment and Decision Making. Malden, MA|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2009|page=70|isbn=978-1-4051-2398-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Betters refrain from making bets that would not recoup their losses if successful.

==Example==
John and Bob go to the casino to play [[roulette]]. After two hours of playing their wives tell them that they must leave after one more spin. John is up $200. Bob is down $320. The end-of-the-day betting effect says that John is more likely to make a low risk bet, such as betting on red or black (1:1 odds), while Bob is more likely to make a bet that can recoup his losses if he is successful, such as betting $10 on 3 single numbers (35:1 odds each).

[[File:enso.jpg|thumb|262px|''Ensō'' (c. 2000) by [[Kanjuro Shibata XX]]. Some artists draw ''ensō'' with an opening in the circle, while others close the circle.]]

In [[Zen]],  {{nihongo|'''''ensō'''''|[[wiktionary:円|円]][[wiktionary:相|相]]|, "circle"}} is a circle that is hand-drawn in one or two uninhibited brushstrokes to express a moment when the mind is free to let the body create.

==Description ==

The ''ensō'' symbolizes absolute [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]], strength, elegance, the universe, and ''[[Mu (negative)|mu]]'' (the void). It is characterised by a [[minimalism]] born of [[Japanese aesthetics]].

Drawing ''ensō'' is a disciplined-creative practice of Japanese ink painting—{{Nihongo|''[[sumi-e]]''|[[wiktionary:墨絵|墨絵]]|"ink painting"}}. The [[Japanese calligraphy#Tools|tools]] and mechanics of drawing the ''ensō'' are the same as those used in traditional [[Japanese calligraphy]]: One uses a {{nihongo|brush|筆|fude}} to apply ink to ''[[washi]]'' (a thin Japanese paper).

The circle may be open or closed. In the former case, the circle is incomplete, allowing for movement and development as well as the perfection of all things. Zen practitioners relate the idea to [[wabi-sabi]], the beauty of imperfection. When the circle is closed, it represents perfection, akin to Plato's perfect form ([[Plato]]), the reason why the circle was used for centuries in the construction of cosmological models, see [[Ptolemy]].

Usually, a person draws the ''ensō'' in one fluid, expressive stroke.  When drawn according to the {{Nihongo|''sōsho''|[[Wiktionary:草書|草書]]}} style of Japanese calligraphy, the brushstroke is especially swift. Once the ''ensō'' is drawn, one does not change it. It evidences the character of its creator and the context of its creation in a brief, continuous period of time. Drawing ''ensō'' is a [[spiritual practice]] that one might perform as often as once per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Seo |first=Audrey Yoshiko |date=2007 |title=Ensō: Zen Circles of Enlightenment |location=[[Boston]] |publisher=[[Weatherhill]] |isbn=9780834805750 |oclc=71329980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This spiritual practice of drawing ''ensō'' or writing Japanese calligraphy for self-realization is called {{Nihongo|''hitsuzendō''|筆禅道|"way of the brush"}}. ''Ensō'' exemplifies the various dimensions of the Japanese ''[[wabi-sabi]]'' perspective and aesthetic: ''Fukinsei'' (asymmetry, irregularity), ''kanso'' (simplicity),  ''koko'' (basic; weathered), ''shizen'' (without pretense; natural), ''yugen'' (subtly profound grace), ''datsuzoku'' (freedom), and ''seijaku'' (tranquility).

In 1995, [[Lucent Technologies]] hired the San Francisco office of [[Landor Associates]], a transnational brand consultancy, to design their brand image.&lt;ref name="aiga"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aiga.org/content.cfm/the-lucent-logo-legacy-long-live-the-big-red-donut |title=The Lucent Logo Legacy: Long Live the Big Red Donut |last=Bowie |first=James |date=9 May 2006 |website=[[American Institute of Graphic Arts]] |publisher= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011015559/http://www.aiga.org/content.cfm/the-lucent-logo-legacy-long-live-the-big-red-donut |archivedate=11 October 2007 |accessdate=25 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the design of the logo, Landor colored an image of an ensō red. The designer intended the brushstroke to imply human creativity, and the red to convey urgency.&lt;ref name="cnnmoney"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1997/03/17/223308/ |title=Elucidating Lucent's "Million-dollar Coffee Stain" |last=McGowan |first=John |date=17 March 1997 |website=[[CNNMoney.com]] |publisher=[[Time Warner]] |accessdate=27 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203045222/http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1997/03/17/223308/ |archivedate=3 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They named it the "Innovation Ring". "Our name and symbol represent the new entrepreneurial spirit and vision of our company" reads a [[public relations]] statement from Lucent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/1999/08/10/lucent_logo_captures_company/ |title=Lucent logo captures company in 'single masterful brush stroke' |last=Magee |first=Mike |date=10 August 1999 |website=[[The Register]] |accessdate=27 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In North America, the logo was widely misunderstood.&lt;ref name="aiga"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cnnmoney"/&gt; After years of staying-power and familiarity, the logo became more accepted by industry people in the West (including Lucent's own employees), although it was still not well understood. Nonetheless, soon other logo designers began to be influenced by the work.&lt;ref name="cnnmoney"/&gt; Lucent stopped using the logo after merging with [[Alcatel-Lucent#Alcatel|Alcatel]] of France to form [[Alcatel-Lucent]].

A variation of the symbol was also used as a logo by [[Obaku Ltd.]]. They continue to use an ensō shape as a wristwatch brand.

Thinking, an international design and consulting house centred in London, uses an ensō&lt;ref&gt;thinking.partners&lt;/ref&gt; meaning "Expression" as one of their four icons, along with icons for science, pattern and vision.

Philosopher Joseph Campbell's book, [[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]], bears this symbol on its cover representing creativity and uninhibited freedom of expression within art/literature.

The book [[The Lean Startup]] uses an enso on the cover. One of the concepts in the approach includes a [[learning cycle]] 'Build - Measure - Learn".

The design of [[Apple Campus 2]], [[Apple Inc.]]'s ring-shaped corporate headquarters, might also have been inspired by the ensō.&lt;ref name="Architect's Newspaper"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.archpaper.com/wordpress/archives/29794 |title=Zen-otaph: Steve Jobs and the Meaning Behind Apple's New Campus |last=Daly |first=Sean |date=29 December 2011 |website=A/N Blog |accessdate=5 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140512235306/http://blog.archpaper.com/wordpress/archives/29794 |archivedate=12 May 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mindbody_Inc.|MINDBODY]] prominently features an ensō in its company logo.

'''Exploratory thought''' is an academic term used in the field of [[psychology]] to describe [[reasoning]] that neutrally considers multiple points of view and tries to anticipate all possible objections to, or flaws in, a particular position, with the goal of seeking truth. The opposite of exploratory thought is [[confirmatory thought]], which is reasoning designed to construct justification supporting a specific point of view.

Both terms were coined by social psychologist [[Jennifer Lerner]] and psychology professor [[Philip Tetlock]] in the 2002 book Emerging Perspectives in Judgment and Decision Making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schneider|first=ed. by Sandra L.|title=Emerging perspectives on judgment and decision research|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge Univ. Press|location=Cambridge [u.a.]|isbn=052152718X|pages=438-9|url=https://www.amazon.com/Emerging-Perspectives-Judgment-Decision-Cambridge/dp/052152718X|author2=Shanteau, James}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors argue that most people, most of the time, make decisions based on gut feelings and poor logic, and reason through issues primarily to provide justification, to themselves and to others, of what they already believe.

Lerner and Tetlock say that when people expect to need to justify their position to external parties, and they already know those parties' views, they will tend to adopt a similar position to theirs, and then engage in confirmatory thought with the goal of bolstering their own credibility rather than reaching a good conclusion. However, if the external parties are overly aggressive or critical, people will disengage from thought altogether, and simply assert their personal opinions without justification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schneider|first=ed. by Sandra L.|title=Emerging perspectives on judgment and decision research|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge Univ.

[[Image:Fabaxo1.jpg|thumb|300px|Fab Tree Hab, a "Local Biota Living Graft Structure"&lt;ref name="TerreformOne" /&gt;]]

The '''Fab Tree Hab''' is a hypothetical ecological home design developed at [[MIT]] by [[Mitchell Joachim]], Javier Arbona and Lara Greden. With the idea of easing the burden Humanity places on the environment with conventional housing by growing "living, breathing" [[tree house|tree homes]].&lt;ref name=CanadaFab&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/story.html?id=6a9be8a7-f32e-4ca6-8446-a23a28dd4594|title=Grow your own home: 'Fab tree hab'|publisher=|accessdate=2015-11-06|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160115053717/http://www.canada.com/story.html?id=6a9be8a7-f32e-4ca6-8446-a23a28dd4594|archivedate=2016-01-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It would be built by allowing native trees to grow over a computer-designed ([[CNC]]) removable [[plywood]] [[scaffold]]. Once the plants are interconnected and stable,&lt;ref name="TerreformOne"&gt;{{Cite web |author=Mitchell Joachim |title=Terreform One |url=http://www.archinode.com/bienal.html |accessdate=2015-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; the plywood would be removed and reused. MIT is experimenting with [[trees]] that grow quickly and develop an interwoven root structure that's soft enough to "train" over the scaffold, but then hardens into a more durable structure. The inside walls would be conventional [[clay]] and [[plaster]].

An old methodology new to buildings is introduced in this design - [[pleaching]]. Pleaching is a method of weaving together tree branches to form living [[arch]]ways, [[latticework|lattice]]s, or screens.&lt;ref name=Technologyreview&gt;{{Cite web|author = Tracy Staedter |title=Architects design a living home|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/read_article.aspx?id=17102|accessdate=2015-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;; the technique is also named "[[Tree shaping#Aeroponic culture|Aeroponic culture]]". The load-bearing part of the structure uses trees that self-graft or inosculate such as [[Live oak|Live Oak]], [[Elm]] and [[Dogwood]]. The lattice frame for the walls and roof are created with the branches of the trees. Vines create a dense protective layer woven along the exterior, interspersed with soil pockets and growing plants.&lt;ref name=TerreformOne/&gt;

The Fab Tree Hab is an experiment that would develop over time.  Extra operating costs required over the life-time of the home include pest management with organic pesticides and maintenance of the [[living machine]]'s water treatment system.  Technical demonstration and innovation is still needed for certain components, primarily the bioplastic windows that accept growth of the structure and the management of flows across the wall section to assure that the interior remains dry and animal-free.  All in all, the elapsed time to reach livability is greater than the traditional sense, but so should be the health and longevity of the home and family.  Above all, building this home could be achieved at a minimal price. Depending on the surrounding climate the house is to be grown in, the team expect it will take a minimum of five years to complete its structure.&lt;ref name=CanadaFab/&gt;&lt;ref name=TerreformOne/&gt; Realization of these homes will begin as an experiment, and it is envisioned that thereafter, the concept of renewal will take on a new architectural form - one of inter-dependency between nature and people.

As of May 2007 Mitchell Joachim stated that there is a "50 per cent" organic project in California, combining natural elements and traditional construction.&lt;ref name=CanadaFab/&gt;

==Trees==
Main trees suggested to be used are [[elm]]s and [[oak]]s. The teams hopes the homes can be grown using mainly native trees.&lt;ref name=TerreformOne/&gt;

Where [[metaphysics]] tries to explain what is the universe and what it is like, '''feminist metaphysics''' questions how metaphysical answers have supported [[sexism]].&lt;ref name="sep"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Feminist Metaphysics | encyclopedia=[[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] | last1=Haslanger|first1=Sally|last2=Sveinsdóttir|first2=Ásta Kristjana | editor1-last=Zalta|editor1-first=Edward N. | year=2011 | edition=Winter 2011|oclc=224325075|issn=1095-5054}}&lt;/ref&gt; Are ideas we have about fundamental subjects like: the self, mind and body, nature, essence, and identity formed with gendered bias? For instance, feminist metaphysics would ask if [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|Cartesian dualism]]&amp;mdash;the concept of humans having minds separate from our bodies&amp;mdash;privileges men or [[masculinity]].&lt;ref name="sep" /&gt;

== Social construction ==
The famous quote “One is not born, but rather becomes, a woman,” coined by [[Simone de Beauvoir]], can be considered feminist metaphysical critique.{{cn|date=January 2018}} De Beauvoir does not deny that some people are born with female body parts, but that those body parts need not imply how one is socially situated. Yet for many societies being in possession of those body parts prescribes social roles, norms, and activities, and the differences are said to be necessary, because they are natural.&lt;ref name=SecondSex-1949&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Second Sex|last = de Beauvoir|first = Simone|publisher = Vintage Books|year = 1949|isbn =978-1-473-52191-9  |location = New York|pages = Chapter 1|oclc=896850610|title-link = The Second Sex}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since de Beauvoir many feminists have presented the view that social hierarchies are perpetuated by the fallacy that they are metaphysically "natural". In fact, the power that comes from naturalising myths about universal categories, has made feminists wary of accepting that any category at all is "natural". And subsequently a response is that any such supposedly "natural" category, should not be a basis for how we organize ourselves socially.&lt;ref name=AfterIdentity-2008&gt;{{Cite book|title = After Identity: Rethinking Race, Sex, and Gender|last = Warnke|first = Georgia|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2008|isbn =978-0-521-88281-1 |location = Cambridge, UK  &amp; New York |pages = |oclc=165408056}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Critique of social construction ===
If being a woman is not due to "situation", like biology, de Beauvoir claims that it is due to "instrumentality" of women's freedom.{{huh|date=January 2018|reason=gobbledygook}} Critic [[Judith Butler]] finds this problematic because de Beauvoir's reasoning, now plots "situation" against "instrumentality", plays into Cartesian [[body-freedom dualism]].&lt;ref name=GenderTrouble-1990&gt;{{Cite book|title = Gender Trouble|last = Butler|first = Judith|publisher = Routledge|year = 1990|isbn = 978-0-415-90042-3|location = New York |pages = 12|oclc=19630577|title-link = Gender Trouble}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{huh|date=January 2018|reason=gobbledygook}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6018">'''Fractional anisotropy (FA)''' is a [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] value between zero and one that describes the degree of [[anisotropy]] of a [[diffusion]] process. A value of zero means that diffusion is isotropic, i.e. it is unrestricted (or equally restricted) in all directions. A value of one means that diffusion occurs only along one axis and is fully restricted along all other directions. FA is a measure often used in [[diffusion imaging]] where it is thought to reflect [[fiber density]], [[axon]]al diameter, and [[myelination]] in [[white matter]]. The FA is an extension of the concept of [[Eccentricity (mathematics)|eccentricity of conic sections]] in 3 dimensions, normalized to the unit range.

== Definition ==

A Diffusion Ellipsoid is completely represented by the Diffusion Tensor, D. FA is calculated from the [[eigenvalue]]s (&lt;math&gt;\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \lambda_3&lt;/math&gt;) of the diffusion [[tensor]].&lt;ref name="Basser1996" /&gt; The eigenvectors &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; give the directions in which the ellipsoid has major axes, and the corresponding eigenvalues  &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; give the magnitude of the peak in that direction.

[[File:DTschematic.jpg|thumb|right| Diffusion Tensor Schematic]]

: &lt;math&gt;\text{FA} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{2}} \frac{\sqrt{(\lambda_1 - \hat{\lambda})^2 + (\lambda_2 - \hat{\lambda})^2 + (\lambda_3 - \hat{\lambda})^2}}{\sqrt{\lambda_1^2 + \lambda_2^2 + \lambda_3^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;\hat{\lambda} = (\lambda_1 + \lambda_2 + \lambda_3)/3&lt;/math&gt; being the mean value of the eigenvalues.

An equivalent formula for FA is

: &lt;math&gt;\text{FA} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} \frac{\sqrt{(\lambda_1 - \lambda_2)^2 + (\lambda_2 - \lambda_3)^2 + (\lambda_3 - \lambda_1)^2}}{\sqrt{\lambda_1^2 + \lambda_2^2 + \lambda_3^2}},&lt;/math&gt;

which is further equivalent to:&lt;ref name="ozarslan2005" /&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\text{FA} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \left(3-\frac{1}{\text{trace}(\text{R}^2)}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

where R is the "normalized" diffusion tensor:

: &lt;math&gt;\text{R} = \frac{\text{D}}{\text{trace}(\text{D})}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that if all the eigenvalues are equal, which happens for isotropic (spherical) diffusion, as in free water, the FA is {{math|0}}.   The FA can reach a maximum value of {{math|1}} (this rarely happens in real data), in which case D has only one nonzero eigenvalue and the ellipsoid reduces to a line in the direction of that eigenvector. This means that the diffusion is confined to that direction alone.

== Details ==

This can be visualized with an ellipsoid, which is defined by the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of D. The FA of a sphere is ''0'' since the diffusion is isotropic, and there is equal probability of diffusion in all directions. The eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the Diffusion Tensor give a complete representation of the diffusion process. FA quantifies the pointedness of the ellipsoid, but does not give information about which direction it is pointing to.

Note that the FA of most liquids, including water, is {{math|0}} unless the diffusion process is being constrained by structures such as network of fibers.  The measured FA may depend on the effective length scale of the diffusion measurement.  If the diffusion process is not constrained on the scale being measured (the constraints are too far apart) or the constraints switch direction on a smaller scale than the measured one, then the measured FA will be attenuated.  For example, the brain can be thought of as a fluid permeated by many fibers (nerve axons).  However, in most parts the fibers go in all directions, and thus although they constrain the diffusion the FA is {{math|0}}. In some regions, such as the [[corpus callosum]] the fibers are aligned over a large enough scale (on the order of a mm) for their directions to mostly agree within the resolution element of a [[magnetic resonance image]], and it is these regions that stand out in an FA image.  [[Liquid crystals]] can also exhibit anisotropic diffusion because the needle or plate-like shapes of their molecules affect how they slide over one another.  When the FA is 0 the tensor nature of D is often ignored, and it is called the diffusion constant.

&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Ellipsoid2722.jpg| FA value of 0.9209, the DT matrix is diagonal([27 2 2])
File:Ellipsoid888.jpg| FA value of 0, the DT matrix is diagonal([8 8 8])
File:Ellipsoid eigenvalues14142.jpg|FA value of 0.6030, the DT matrix is diagonal([14 14 2])
&lt;/gallery&gt;

A drawback of the Diffusion Tensor model is that it can account only for [[Gaussian]] diffusion processes, which has been found to be inadequate in accurately representing the true diffusion process in the human brain. Due to this, higher order models using spherical harmonics and Orientation Distribution Functions (ODF) have been used to define newer and richer estimates of the anisotropy, called Generalized Fractional Anisotropy. GFA computations use samples of the ODF to evaluate the anisotropy in diffusion. They can also be easily calculated by using the Spherical Harmonic coefficients of the ODF model.&lt;ref name="Cohen2008" /&gt;

'''''How to Start a Revolution''''' is a [[BAFTA]] Award-winning British [[documentary film]] about [[Nobel Peace Prize]] nominee and political theorist [[Gene Sharp]], described as the world's foremost scholar on [[nonviolent revolution]]. The 2011 film describes Sharp's ideas, and their influence on popular uprisings around the world. Screened in cinemas and television in more than 22 countries it became popular among the [[Occupy Wall Street Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/your-democracy/2013/01/gene-sharp-machiavelli-non-violence ''New Statesman'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
Directed by British journalist [[Ruaridh Arrow]] the film follows the use of Gene Sharp's work across revolutionary groups throughout the world.  There is particular focus on Sharp's key text ''[[From Dictatorship to Democracy]]''&lt;ref&gt;Gene Sharp (2010), [http://www.aeinstein.org/organizations/org/FDTD.pdf ''From Dictatorship to Democracy'' (full text online)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060209144939/http://www.aeinstein.org/organizations/org/FDTD.pdf |date=9 February 2006 }} (4th ed.). East Boston, NA: [[Albert Einstein Institution]]. {{ISBN|978-1-880813-09-6}}, {{ISBN|1-880813-09-2}}, {{OCLC|706499601}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has been translated by democracy activists into more than 30 languages and used in revolutions from Serbia and Ukraine to Egypt and Syria. The film describes how Sharp's 198 methods of nonviolent action have inspired and informed uprisings across the globe.

==Cast==
A primary character of the film is [[Gene Sharp]], founder of the [[Albert Einstein Institution]], and a 2009 and 2012 nominee for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;Oslo Newsroom (27 February 2012).

==Background and production==
Scottish journalist [[Ruaridh Arrow]], who wrote, directed, and co-produced the film, explained that he first learned about Gene Sharp's work as a student, and then heard that Sharp's booklets were turning up on the sites of many revolutions. But Sharp himself remained largely unknown. In explaining his motivation to make the film, Arrow stated that
{{Quote|Here was this old man [Gene Sharp] sitting in a crumpled house in Boston and that is where revolutionaries go for advice. It was one of the world's great little secrets. It was a little bit of magic and I had to make a film about it.&lt;ref name=brown12&gt;{{cite news|first=Annie |last=Brown |title=Scot's battle to make film on little-known guru of uprisings around world |newspaper=[[Daily Record (Scotland)]] |date=March 24, 2012 |url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/editors-choice/2012/03/24/scot-s-battle-to-make-film-on-little-known-guru-of-uprisings-around-world-86908-23800123/}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The film was privately funded by Ruaridh Arrow and additional funding was raised through the US crowdfunding site [[Kickstarter]].&lt;ref name=brown12/&gt; The film raised $57,342 in just under 4 weeks&lt;ref name=brown12/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Page at Kickstarter for [http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/172444007/how-to-start-a-revolution-a-new-documentary-film How to Start a Revolution]&lt;/ref&gt; making it the most successful British crowdfunded film currently completed.  Several high-profile figures are credited by the producers with supporting the crowdfunding project, including director [[Richard Linklater]] and actress [[Miriam Margolyes]].&lt;ref&gt;Film website, [http://howtostartarevolutionfilm.com/index.php/credits/thankyou "Special Thanks"] (from howtostartarevolutionfilm.com) (accessed 2 May 2012))&lt;/ref&gt;  Completion funding was donated by US art collector James Otis who sold the largest collection of [[Gandhi]] possessions including Gandhi's iconic glasses and sandals in 2009. Otis stated that he was selling the items to help fund nonviolent struggle projects and is described as the Executive Producer of the film.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Sarlin (1 May 2009).

==Touch Documentary==
In 2012 ''How to Start a Revolution'' was among the first "[[Touch Documentaries]]" to be released using the Apple iPad platform.  The film was integrated into the platform along with four of Gene Sharp's books in several languages, including ''From Dictatorship to Democracy'', and several of Sharp's lectures. The app is supplemented by analysis and satellite mapping which is offered up to the viewer while watching the film.&lt;ref name="internationalpeaceandconflict.org"&gt;http://www.internationalpeaceandconflict.org/forum/topics/pcdn-review-of-the-how-to-start-a-revolution-ipad-app?xg_source=activity#.USUXybR2tUQ&lt;/ref&gt;  A "Revolution Monitor" is also included which fuses Google Earth maps with Twitter displaying tweets and YouTube links from revolutionary groups and individuals when countries of interest are touched by the viewer.&lt;ref&gt;http://howtostartarevolutionfilm.com/index.php/ipad&lt;/ref&gt;
A review by The Peace &amp; Collaborative Network described the app as "simply a must-have among peace studies scholars, those actively working to start or reorganize revolutions, or anyone who is interested in the logistics, history, and outcomes of nonviolent revolutions" &lt;ref name="internationalpeaceandconflict.org"/&gt;
The ''How to Start a Revolution'' [[touch documentary]] was shortlisted for the International Best Digital Media award in the One World Media Awards 2013 &lt;ref&gt;http://oneworldmedia.org.uk/awards/shortlist&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Human sexual activity''', '''human sexual practice''' or '''human sexual behaviour''' is the manner in which humans experience and express their [[Human sexuality|sexuality]]. People engage in a variety of sexual acts, ranging from activities done alone (e.g., [[masturbation]]) to acts with another person (e.g., [[sexual intercourse]], [[non-penetrative sex]], [[oral sex]], etc.) in varying patterns of frequency, for a wide variety of reasons. Sexual activity usually results in [[sexual arousal]] and physiological changes in the aroused person, some of which are pronounced while others are more subtle. Sexual activity may also include conduct and activities which are intended to arouse the sexual interest of another or enhance the [[sex life]] of another, such as strategies to find or attract partners ([[courtship]] and [[Display (zoology)|display]] behaviour), or personal interactions between individuals (for instance, [[foreplay]] or [[BDSM]]). Sexual activity may follow sexual arousal.

Human sexual activity has sociological, cognitive, [[Emotional intimacy|emotional]], [[Physical intimacy|behavioural]] and biological aspects; these include [[Human bonding|personal bonding]], sharing emotions and the [[physiology]] of the [[reproductive system]], [[sex drive]], sexual intercourse and sexual behaviour in all its forms.

In some cultures, sexual activity is considered acceptable only within marriage, while [[Premarital sex|premarital]] and [[extramarital sex]] are taboo. Some sexual activities are illegal either universally or in some countries or subnational jurisdictions, while some are considered contrary to the [[Norm (social)|norm]]s of certain societies or cultures. Two examples that are criminal offences in most&lt;!--virtually all?--&gt; [[jurisdiction]]s are [[sexual assault]] and sexual activity with a person below the local [[age of consent]].

==Types==
[[File:1925 Wegener Les Delassements dEros 09 anagoria.JPG|thumb|right|230px|[[Gerda Wegener]]'s 1925 artwork "Les delassements d'Eros" ("The recreations of Eros"), which depicts sexual activity by two women]]
Sexual activity can be classified in a number of ways: acts which involve one person (also called [[autoeroticism]]) such as [[masturbation]], or two or more people such as [[Sexual intercourse|vaginal sex]], [[anal sex]], [[oral sex]] or [[mutual masturbation]]. If there are more than two participants in the sex act, it may be referred to as [[group sex]]. Autoerotic sexual activity can involve use of [[dildo]]s, [[Vibrator (sex toy)|vibrator]]s, [[anal beads]], and other [[sex toy]]s, though these devices can also be used with a partner.

Sexual activity can be classified into the [[gender]] and [[sexual orientation]] of the participants, as well as by the relationship of the participants. For example, the relationships can be ones of marriage, [[intimate partner]]s, casual [[sex partners]] or [[anonymous sex|anonymous]]. Sexual activity can be regarded as [[conventional sex|conventional]] or as [[Kink (sexual)|alternative]], involving, for example, [[Sexual fetishism|fetishism]], [[paraphilia]], or [[BDSM]] activities.&lt;ref name="channel1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/health/microsites/0-9/4health/sex/sar_tips.html |title=Sex and Relationships |publisher=Channel 4 |accessdate=30 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504202257/http://www.channel4.com/health/microsites/0-9/4health/sex/sar_tips.html |archivedate=4 May 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="findarticles.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1608/is_1_18/ai_80957472 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120526192917/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1608/is_1_18/ai_80957472 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=26 May 2012 |title=Improve your orgasm: you may have thought your sexual pleasure was the one thing that couldn't get any better. Think again – Sexual Fitness – physiology &amp;#124; Men's Fitness |publisher=Findarticles.com |accessdate=30 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fetishism can take many forms ranging from the desire for certain body parts, for example large breasts, navels or foot worship. The object of desire can often be shoes, boots, lingerie, clothing, leather or rubber items. Some non-conventional autoerotic practices can be dangerous. These include [[erotic asphyxiation]] and [[self-bondage]]. The potential for injury or even death that exists while engaging in the partnered versions of these fetishes ([[Fainting game|choking]] and [[Bondage (sexual)|bondage]], respectively) becomes drastically increased in the autoerotic case due to the isolation and lack of assistance in the event of a problem.

Sexual activity can be consensual, which means that both or all participants agree to take part and are of the age that they can consent, or it may take place under force or duress, which is often called [[sexual assault]] or rape. In different cultures and countries, various sexual activities may be lawful or illegal in regards to the age, gender, marital status or other factors of the participants, or otherwise contrary to [[social norms]] or generally accepted [[sexual morals]].

==Mating strategies==
In [[evolutionary psychology]] and [[behavioral ecology]], human mating strategies are a set of behaviors used by individuals to attract, select, and retain [[Mating|mates]]. Mating strategies overlap with [[reproductive]] strategies, which encompass a broader set of behaviors involving the timing of reproduction and the trade-off between quantity and quality of offspring (see [[life history theory]]).

Relative to other animals, human mating strategies are unique in their relationship with cultural variables such as the institution of [[marriage]].&lt;ref&gt;Low, B. S. (2007). [https://books.google.com/books?id=8K7Hc09xcQAC&amp;pg=PA449#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Ecological%20and%20socio-cultural%20impacts%20on%20mating%20and%20marriage%22 Ecological and socio-cultural impacts on mating and marriage]. Oxford Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology, 449.&lt;/ref&gt; Humans may seek out individuals with the intention of forming a long-term [[intimate relationship]], marriage, [[casual relationship]], or [[friendship]]. The human desire for [[companionship]] is one of the strongest human drives. It is an innate feature of human nature, and may be related to the [[sex drive]]. The human mating process encompasses the social and cultural processes whereby one person may meet another to assess suitability, the [[courtship]] process and the process of forming an [[interpersonal relationship]]. Commonalities, however, can be found between humans and nonhuman animals in mating behavior (see [[animal sexual behavior]]).

==Stages of physiological arousal during sexual stimulation==
[[File:Kama sutra 24 detail.jpg|thumb|right|200px|This Indian [[Kama sutra]] illustration, which shows a woman on top of a man, depicts the male erection, which is one of the physiological responses to sexual arousal for men.]]
The [[Human sexual response cycle|physiological responses]] during [[sexual stimulation]] are fairly similar for both men and women and there are four phases.&lt;ref name="Schacter"&gt;{{cite book | authors=Daniel L. Schacter, Daniel T. Gilbert, Daniel M. Wegner| title =Psychology| publisher =[[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]]|year = 2010|pages=335–336|accessdate = 10 November 2012| isbn = 978-1429237192|url =https://books.google.com/?id=emAyzTNy1cUC&amp;pg=PA335&amp;q=Men%20and%20women%20may%20have%20different%20levels%20of%20sexual%20drive%2C%20but%20their%20physiological%20responses%20during%20sex%20are%20fairly%20similar.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* During the excitement phase, muscle tension and blood flow increase in and around the sexual organs, heart and respiration increase and blood pressure rises. Men and women experience a "[[sex flush]]" on the skin of the upper body and face. Typically, a woman's [[vagina]] becomes lubricated and her [[clitoris]] becomes swollen.&lt;ref name="Schacter"/&gt; A man's penis will become erect.
* During the plateau phase, heart rate and muscle tension increase further. A man's urinary bladder closes to prevent urine from mixing with [[semen]]. A woman's clitoris may withdraw slightly and there is more lubrication, outer swelling and muscles tighten and reduction of diameter.&lt;ref name="Schacter"/&gt;
* During the [[orgasm]] phase, breathing becomes extremely rapid and the pelvic muscles begin a series of rhythmic contractions. Both men and women experience quick cycles of muscle contraction of lower pelvic muscles and women often experience uterine and vaginal contractions; this experience can be described as intensely pleasurable, but roughly 15% of women never experience orgasm and half report having [[Fake orgasm|faked it]].&lt;ref name="Schacter"/&gt; A large genetic component is associated with how often women experience orgasm.&lt;ref name="Schacter"/&gt;
* During the resolution phase, muscles relax, blood pressure drops, and the body returns to its resting state.

==Psychological aspects==
Sexual activity can lower blood pressure and overall stress levels, regardless of age.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} It serves to release tension, elevate mood, and possibly create a profound sense of relaxation, especially in the postcoital period. From a biochemical perspective, sex causes the release of endorphins and increases levels of white blood cells that actually boost the immune system. A study published in the journal Biological Psychology described how men who had had sex the previous night responded better to stressful situations, it suggested that if a person is regularly sexual, they're regularly relaxed, and when the person is relaxed, they cope better with stressful situations. {{citation needed|date=June 2016}} A 2007 study published in the Archives of Sexual Behavior 36, (no. 3 (June 2007): 357–68) reported that sexual behavior with a partner on one day significantly predicted lower negative mood and stress, and higher positive mood, on the following day.

===Motivations===
{{anchor|Reasons_for_sexual_activity}}
{{Redirect|Pity sex|the American rock band|Pity Sex}}
People engage in sexual activity for any of a multitude of possible reasons. Although the primary evolutionary purpose of sexual activity is reproduction, research on college students suggested that people have sex for four general reasons: ''physical attraction'', as a ''means to an end'', to increase ''emotional connection'', and to ''alleviate insecurity''.&lt;ref&gt;Meston &amp; Buss, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most people engage in sexual activity because of pleasure they derive from the [[sexual arousal|arousal of their sexuality]], especially if they can achieve [[orgasm]]. Sexual arousal can also be experienced from [[foreplay]] and flirting, and from [[Fetishism|fetish]] or BDSM activities,&lt;ref name="channel1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1608/is_1_18/ai_80957472 | archive-url=https://archive.is/20120526192917/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1608/is_1_18/ai_80957472 | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2012-05-26 | title=Improve your orgasm: you may have thought your sexual pleasure was the one thing that couldn't get any better. Think again&amp;nbsp;— Sexual Fitness&amp;nbsp;— physiology | year=2002 | work=Men's Fitness}}&lt;/ref&gt; or other [[Eroticism|erotic activities]]. Most commonly, people engage in sexual activity because of the [[sexual desire]] generated by a person to whom they feel [[sexual attraction]]; but they may engage in sexual activity for the physical satisfaction they achieve in the absence of attraction for another, as in the case of [[Casual sex|casual or social sex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/casual%20sex|title=Casual sex - Define Casual sex at Dictionary.com|work=Dictionary.com|accessdate=25 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At times, a person may engage in a sexual activity solely for the sexual pleasure of their partner, such as because of an obligation they may have to the partner or because of love, sympathy or pity they may feel for the partner.

A person may engage in sexual activity for purely monetary considerations, or to obtain some advantage from either the partner or the activity. A man and woman may engage in sexual intercourse with the objective of [[Fertilisation|conception]]. Some people engage in hate sex, which occurs between two people who strongly dislike or annoy each other. It is related to the idea that opposition between two people can heighten [[sexual tension]], attraction and interest.&lt;ref name=Holbrook1972 &gt;{{Cite book | last=Holbrook | first=David | year=1972 | title=The masks of hate: the problem of false solutions in the culture of an acquisitive society | publisher=Pergamon Press | page=118 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rWYIAQAAIAAJ | isbn=978-0-08-015799-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been shown that sexual activity plays a large part in the interaction of social species. [[Joan Roughgarden]], in her book ''Diversity, Gender, and Sexuality in Nature and People,'' postulates that this applies equally to humans as it does to other social species. She explores the purpose of sexual activity and demonstrates that there are many functions facilitated by such activity including pair bonding, group bonding, dispute resolution and reproduction.&lt;ref name=Roughgarden2004 &gt;{{Cite book | last=Roughgarden | first=Joan | year=2004 | title= Diversity, Gender, and Sexuality in Nature and People| publisher=[[University of California Press]] | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dASsUFtN57sC | isbn=978-0-520-24073-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self-determination theory===
Research has found that people also engage in sexual activity for reasons associated with [[self-determination theory]]. The self-determination theory can be applied to a sexual relationship when the participants have positive feelings associated with the relationship. These participants do not feel guilty or coerced into the partnership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Knee C.R. |author2=Lonsbary C. |author3=Canevello A. |author4=Patrick H. | year = 2005 | title = Self-determination and conflict in romantic relationships | url = | journal = J Pers Soc Psychol | volume = 89 | issue = 6| pages = 997–1009 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.89.6.997 |pmid=16393030 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have proposed the model of self-determined sexual motivation.  The purpose of this model is to connect self-determination and sexual motivation.&lt;ref name="Brunell, A.B. 2013"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Brunell A.B. |author2=Webster G.D. | year = 2013 | title = Self-Determination and Sexual Experience in Dating Relationships | url = | journal = Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin | volume = 39 | issue = 7| pages = 970–987 | doi = 10.1177/0146167213485442 |pmid=23613122 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This model has helped to explain how people are sexually motivated when involved in self-determined dating relationships. This model also links the positive outcomes, (satisfying the need for autonomy, competence, and relatedness) gained from sexual motivations.&lt;ref name="Brunell, A.B. 2013"/&gt;

According to the completed research associated with this model, it was found that people of both sexes who engaged in sexual activity for self-determined motivation had more positive psychological well-being.&lt;ref name="Brunell, A.B. 2013"/&gt; While engaging in sexual activity for self-determined reasons, the participants also had a higher need for fulfillment.  When this need was satisfied, they felt better about themselves. This was correlated with greater closeness to their partner and higher overall satisfaction in their relationship.&lt;ref name="Brunell, A.B. 2013"/&gt; Though both sexes engaged in sexual activity for self-determined reasons, there were some differences found between males and females.  It was concluded that females had more motivation than males to engage in sexual activity for self-determined reasons.&lt;ref name="Brunell, A.B. 2013"/&gt; Females also had higher satisfaction and relationship quality than males did from the sexual activity.&lt;ref name="Brunell, A.B. 2013"/&gt; Overall, research concluded that psychological well-being, sexual motivation, and sexual satisfaction were all positively correlated when dating couples partook in sexual activity for self-determined reasons.&lt;ref name="Brunell, A.B. 2013"/&gt;

==Frequency==
{{globalize|section|date=June 2015}}
{{See also|Sexually active life expectancy}}
The frequency of sexual activity might range from zero ([[sexual abstinence]]) to 15 or 20 times a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=David Osbourne |url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/sexual-health/HQ01363 |title=Sexual health: An interview with a Mayo Clinic specialist |website=[[Mayo Clinic|MayoClinic.com]] |date=2 December 2004 |accessdate=24 December 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051206023204/http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/sexual-health/HQ01363 |archivedate=6 December 2005 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the average frequency of sexual intercourse for married couples is 2 to 3 times a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

According to the [[Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender, and Reproduction|Kinsey Institute]], the average frequency of sexual intercourse in the US for individuals who have partners is 112 times per year (age 18–29), 86 times per year (age 30–39), and 69 times per year (age 40–49).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/resources/FAQ.html#frequency | title = Frequently asked questions to the Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender, and Reproduction Kinsey Institute|accessdate = 6 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adolescents===
{{See also|Adolescent sexuality}}
The age at which adolescents tend to become sexually active varies considerably between different cultures and from time to time. (See [[Virginity#Prevalence of virginity|Prevalence of virginity]].) The first sexual act of a child or adolescent is sometimes referred to as the [[sexualization]] of the child, and may be considered as a milestone or a change of status, as the loss of [[virginity]] or innocence. Youth are legally free to have intercourse after they reach the [[age of consent]].

A 1999 survey of students indicated that approximately 40% of ninth graders across the United States report having had sexual intercourse. This figure rises with each grade. Males are more sexually active than females at each of the grade levels surveyed. Sexual activity of young adolescents differs in ethnicity as well. A higher percent of African American and Hispanic adolescents are sexually active than White adolescents.&lt;ref&gt;Meece, Judith L. Child and Adolescent Development for Educators. New York: McGraw Hill, 2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Research on sexual frequency has also been conducted solely on female adolescents who engage in sexual activity.  Female adolescents tended to engage in more sexual activity due to positive mood. In female teenagers, engaging in sexual activity was directly positively correlated with being older, greater sexual activity in the previous week or prior day, and more positive mood the previous day or the same day as the sexual activity occurred.&lt;ref name="Fortenberry D.J., Temkit M., Tu W., Graham C.A., Katz B. 2005 252–257"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Fortenberry D.J. |author2=Temkit M. |author3=Tu W. |author4=Graham C.A. |author5=Katz B. | year = 2005 | title = Daily Mood, Partner Support, Sexual Interest, and Sexual Activity Among Adolescent Women | url = http://bura.brunel.ac.uk/handle/2438/4803| journal = Health Psychology | volume = 24 | issue = 3| pages = 252–257 | doi = 10.1037/0278-6133.24.3.252 |pmid=15898860 |type=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; Decreased sexual activity was associated with prior or current day negative mood or menstruating.&lt;ref name="Fortenberry D.J., Temkit M., Tu W., Graham C.A., Katz B. 2005 252–257"/&gt;

Although opinions differ, others{{who|date=September 2016}} suggest that sexual activity is an essential part of humans, and that teenagers need to experience sex.  According to a research study, sexual experiences help teenagers understand pleasure and satisfaction.&lt;ref name="Vrangalova, Z. 2011"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vrangalova|first=Zhana|last2=Savin-Williams|first2=Ritch C.|date=1 August 2011|title=Adolescent sexuality and positive well-being: a group-norms approach|journal=Journal of Youth and Adolescence|volume=40|issue=8|pages=931–944|doi=10.1007/s10964-011-9629-7|issn=1573-6601|pmid=21274608}}&lt;/ref&gt; In relation to hedonic and eudaimonic well-being, it stated that teenagers can positively benefit from sexual activity. The cross-sectional study was conducted in 2008 and 2009 at a rural upstate New York community. Teenagers who had their first sexual experience at age 16 revealed a higher well-being than those who were sexually inexperienced or who were first sexually active at a later age of 17.&lt;ref name="Vrangalova, Z. 2011"/&gt; Furthermore, teenagers who had their first sexual experience at age 15 or younger, or who had many sexual partners were not negatively affected and did not have associated lower well-being.&lt;ref name="Vrangalova, Z. 2011"/&gt;

==Health and safety==
Sexual activity is an innately physiological function,&lt;ref&gt;Xiaojun Chen, Xuerui Tan, Qingying Zhang, [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.598.3719  " Cardiovascular effects of sexual activity"], ''Medknow Publications'', December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; but like other physical activity, it comes with risks. There are four main types of risks that may arise from sexual activity: [[Unintended pregnancy|unwanted pregnancy]], contracting a [[Sexually transmitted disease|sexually transmitted infection]] (STI/STD), physical injury, and psychological injury.

===Unwanted pregnancy===
{{main|Unintended pregnancy}}
Any sexual activity that involves the introduction of semen into a woman's vagina, such as during sexual intercourse, or even contact of semen with her vulva, may result in a pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nhs.uk/chq/Pages/975.aspx | title=Can I get pregnant if I have sex without penetration? | publisher=[[National Health Service]] | accessdate=11 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; To reduce the risk of unintended pregnancies, some people who engage in penile-vaginal sex may use [[birth control|contraception]], such as [[birth control pill]]s, a [[condom]], [[Diaphragm (contraceptive)|diaphragm]]s, [[spermicide]]s, [[hormonal contraception]] or sterilization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://contraception.about.com/od/contraceptionoverview/g/glossary.htm Dawn Stacey: Contraception. About.com.] Retrieved 11 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The effectiveness of the various contraceptive methods in avoiding pregnancy varies considerably.

===Sexually transmitted infections===
[[File:Préservatif enroulé.jpg|thumb|right|A rolled-up male [[condom]]]]
{{Main|Sexually transmitted infection}}
Sexual activity that involves skin-to-skin contact, exposure to an infected person's [[bodily fluid]]s or [[mucosal membrane]]s&lt;ref&gt;

Some STIs can also be contracted by using [[Drug injection|IV drug]] [[Hypodermic needle|needle]]s after their use by an infected person, as well as through childbirth or [[breastfeeding]].{{Medical citation needed|date=December 2017}}

===Aging===
{{See also|Sexuality in older age}}
Typically, older men and women maintaining interest in sexual interest and activity could be therapeutic; it is a way of expressing their love and care for one another. Factors such as biological and psychological factors, diseases, mental conditions, boredom with the relationship, and widowhood have been found to contribute with the common decrease in sexual interest and activity in old age. National sex surveys given in Finland in the 1990s revealed aging men had a higher incidence of sexual intercourse compared to aging women and that women were more likely to report a lack of sexual desire compared to men. Regression analysis, factors considered important to female sexual activity included: sexual desire, valuing sexuality, and a healthy partner, while high sexual self-esteem, good health, and active sexual history were important to male sexual activity. Both genders in the study agreed they needed good health, good sexual functioning, positive sexual self-esteem, and a sexually skilful partner to maintain sexual desire.&lt;ref&gt;Kontula, O., &amp; Haavio-Mannila, E. The Impact of Aging on Human Sexual Activity and Sexual Desire" ''Journal of Sex Research'' 46(10), 46–56.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Orientations and society==
{{main|Sexual orientation}}

===Heterosexuality===
{{Main|Heterosexuality}}
[[File:Bathhouse-Valerius Maximus.gif|thumb|[[Brothel]] scene in a public bath, ca. 1475]]
Heterosexuality is the romantic or sexual attraction to the opposite sex. Heterosexual sexual practices are subject to laws in many places. In some countries, mostly those where religion has a strong influence on [[social policy]], marriage laws serve the purpose of encouraging people to have sex only within marriage. [[Sodomy laws]] were seen as discouraging same-sex sexual practices, but may affect opposite-sex sexual practices. Laws also ban adults from committing [[sexual abuse]], committing sexual acts with anyone under an [[age of consent]], performing sexual activities in public, and engaging in sexual activities for money (prostitution). Though these laws cover both same-sex and opposite-sex sexual activities, they may differ in regard to punishment, and may be more frequently (or exclusively) enforced on those who engage in same-sex sexual activities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://criminal.findlaw.com/crimes/more-criminal-topics/sex-offenders/sex-offenses-overview.html Sex Offenders and Sex Offenses: Overview. From FindLaw.] Retrieved 13 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Different-sex sexual practices may be [[monogamy|monogamous]], serially monogamous, or [[Polyamory|polyamorous]], and, depending on the definition of sexual practice, [[abstinence|abstinent]] or [[Autosexuality|autoerotic]] (including [[masturbation]]). Additionally, different religious and political movements have tried to influence or control changes in sexual practices including courting and marriage, though in most countries changes occur at a slow rate.

===Homosexuality===
{{Main|Homosexuality}}
{{See also|Gay sexual practices|Lesbian sexual practices}} 
[[File:An ottoman miniature from the book Sawaqub al-Manaquib depicting Homosexuality.jpg|thumb|right|200px|An Ottoman miniature from the book ''Sawaqub al-Manaquib'' depicting homosexuality]]
Homosexuality is the romantic or sexual attraction to the same sex. People with a homosexual orientation can express their sexuality in a variety of ways, and may or may not express it in their behaviors.&lt;ref name=APAHelp&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apahelpcenter.org/articles/article.php?id=31 |title=Psychology Help Center |publisher=Apahelpcenter.org |accessdate=30 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928051520/http://www.apahelpcenter.org/articles/article.php?id=31 |archivedate=28 September 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research indicates that many gay men and lesbians want, and succeed in having, committed and durable relationships. For example, survey data indicate that between 40% and 60% of gay men and between 45% and 80% of lesbians are currently involved in a romantic relationship.&lt;ref name=WhatIsNature&gt;[http://www.apa.org/topics/lgbt/orientation.aspx#accordion1_content_11 What is the nature of same-sex relationships?] American Psychological Association, Retrieved 25 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible for a person whose sexual identity is mainly heterosexual to engage in sexual acts with people of the same sex. For example, mutual masturbation in the context of what may be considered normal heterosexual teen development. Gay and lesbian people who pretend to be heterosexual are often referred to as being [[closeted]] (hiding their sexuality in "the closet"). "Closet case" is a derogatory term used to refer to people who hide their sexuality. Making that orientation public can be called "[[coming out of the closet]]" in the case of voluntary disclosure or "[[outing]]" in the case of disclosure by others against the subject's wishes (or without their knowledge). Among some communities (called "men on the DL" or "[[Down-low (sexual slang)|down-low]]"), same-sex sexual behavior is sometimes viewed as solely for physical pleasure. [[Men who have sex with men]], as well as [[women who have sex with women]], or men on the "down-low" may engage in sex acts with members of the same sex while continuing sexual and romantic relationships with the opposite sex.

People who engage exclusively in same-sex sexual practices may not identify themselves as gay or lesbian. In sex-segregated environments, individuals may seek relationships with others of their own gender (known as [[situational homosexuality]]). In other cases, some people may experiment or explore their sexuality with same (or different) sex sexual activity before defining their [[sexual identity]]. Despite stereotypes and common misconceptions, there are no forms of sexual acts exclusive to same-sex sexual behavior that cannot also be found in opposite-sex sexual behavior, except those involving the meeting of the genitalia between same-sex partners&amp;nbsp;– [[tribadism]] (generally [[vulva]]-to-vulva rubbing, commonly known by its "scissoring" position) and [[frot]] (generally [[Human penis|penis]]-to-penis rubbing).

===Bisexuality and pansexuality===
{{Main|Bisexuality|Pansexuality}}

==Other social aspects==
===General attitudes===

[[Alex Comfort]] and others propose three potential social aspects of sexual intercourse in humans, which are not mutually exclusive: reproductive, relational, and recreational.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Joy of Sex]]'' A Gourmet Guide to Lovemaking (1972) by [[Alex Comfort]]. See also {{ISBN|1-4000-4614-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The development of [[Combined oral contraceptive pill|the contraceptive pill]] and other highly effective forms of [[contraception]] in the mid- and late 20th century has increased people's ability to segregate these three functions, which still overlap a great deal and in complex patterns. For example: A fertile couple may have intercourse while using contraception to experience sexual pleasure (recreational) and also as a means of emotional intimacy (relational), thus deepening their bonding, making their relationship more stable and more capable of sustaining children in the future (deferred reproductive). This same couple may emphasize different aspects of intercourse on different occasions, being playful during one episode of intercourse (recreational), experiencing deep emotional connection on another occasion (relational), and later, after discontinuing contraception, seeking to achieve pregnancy (reproductive, or more likely reproductive and relational).{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===Religious and ethical===
{{Main|Sexual morality|Religion and sexuality|Norm (sociology)}}
[[File:Khajuraho-Lakshmana Temple erotic detal1.JPG|thumb|Erotic sculptures found in a medieval [[Khajuraho|Hindu]] temple in India]]
Most world religions have sought to address the moral issues that arise from people's sexuality in society and in human interactions. Each major religion has developed [[moral code]]s covering issues of sexuality, morality, ethics etc. Though these moral codes do not address issues of sexuality directly, they seek to regulate the situations which can give rise to sexual interest and to influence people's sexual activities and practices. However, the effect of religious teaching has at times been limited. For example, though most religions disapprove of [[extramarital sex|extramarital sexual relations]], it has always been widely practiced. Nevertheless, these religious codes have always had a strong influence on peoples' attitudes to issues of modesty in dress, behavior, speech etc.

On the other hand, some people adopt the view that pleasure is its own justification for sexual activity. [[Hedonism]] is a school of thought which argues that pleasure is the only [[intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic good]].&lt;ref name="stanford"&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hedonism/ Hedonism], 20 April 2004 ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Human sexual activity, like many other kinds of activity engaged in by humans, is generally influenced by social rules that are culturally specific and vary widely. These social rules are referred to as [[Sexual ethics|sexual morality]] (what can and can not be done by society's rules) and sexual norms (what is and is not expected).

Sexual ethics, morals, and norms relate to issues including deception/honesty, legality, [[fidelity]] and consent. Some activities, known as [[Sex and the law|sex crimes]] in some locations, are illegal in some jurisdictions, including those conducted between (or among) consenting and competent adults (examples include [[sodomy law]] and adult-adult [[incest]]).

Some people who are in a relationship but want to hide polygamous activity (possibly of opposite sexual orientation) from their partner, may solicit consensual sexual activity with others through personal contacts, [[online chat room]]s, or, advertising in select media.

[[Swinging (sexual practice)|Swinging]], on the other hand, involves singles or partners in a [[committed relationship]] engaging in sexual activities with others as a [[recreational sex|recreational]] or social activity.&lt;ref name="case_for_swingers"&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt; The increasing popularity of swinging is regarded by some as arising from the upsurge in sexual activity during the [[sexual revolution]] of the 1960s. Swinging sexual activity can take place in a [[sex club]], also known as a swinger club (not to be confused with a [[strip club]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swingingheaven.co.uk/advice/swingers-clubs.html|title=Advice on Swingers' Clubs|publisher=Swinging Heaven|accessdate=5 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some people engage in various sexual activities as a business transaction. When this involves having sex with, or performing certain actual sexual acts for another person in exchange for money or something of value, it is called prostitution. Other aspects of the [[Sex industry|adult industry]] include [[phone sex]] operators, [[strip club]]s, and pornography.

===Gender roles and the expression of sexuality===
Social [[gender roles]] can influence sexual behavior as well as the reaction of individuals and communities to certain incidents; the [[World Health Organization]] states that, "Sexual violence is also more likely to occur where beliefs in male sexual entitlement are strong, where gender roles are more rigid, and in countries experiencing high rates of other types of violence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/world_report/en/summary_en.pdf |title=World report on violence and health – World Health Organization |format=PDF |date=27 August 2002 |author=T.G.V. |accessdate=25 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some societies, such as those where the concepts of [[family honor]] and female [[chastity]] are very strong, may practice violent control of female sexuality, through practices such as [[honor killings]] and [[female genital mutilation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs241/en/|title=WHO – Female genital mutilation|publisher=|accessdate=25 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/honourcrimes/|title=BBC – Ethics: Honour Crimes|publisher=|accessdate=25 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relation between [[gender equality]] and sexual expression is recognized, and promotion of equity between men and women is crucial for attaining [[sexual health|sexual]] and [[reproductive health]], as stated by the UN [[International Conference on Population and Development]] Program of Action:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/swp/1997/box9.htm |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20070817053022/http://www.unfpa.org/swp/1997/box9.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=17 August 2007 |title=Paragraph 7.34 of the ICPD Programme of Action |work=Sexuality and Gender Relations |accessdate=25 December 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:"Human sexuality and gender relations are closely interrelated and together affect the ability of men and women to achieve and maintain sexual health and manage their reproductive lives. Equal relationships between men and women in matters of sexual relations and reproduction, including full respect for the physical integrity of the human body, require mutual respect and willingness to accept responsibility for the consequences of sexual behaviour. Responsible sexual behaviour, sensitivity and equity in gender relations, particularly when instilled during the formative years, enhance and promote respectful and harmonious partnerships between men and women."

==BDSM ==

[[File:Bent forward strappado.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Strappado]] with rope and a spreader bar.]]
{{Main|BDSM}}
BDSM is a variety of [[Eroticism|erotic]] practices or [[Sexual roleplay|roleplaying]] involving [[bondage (BDSM)|bondage]], [[dominance and submission]], [[sadomasochism]], and other interpersonal dynamics. Given the wide range of practices, some of which may be engaged in by people who do not consider themselves as practicing BDSM, inclusion in the BDSM community or subculture is usually dependent on [[self-identification]] and shared experience. BDSM communities generally welcome anyone with a non-normative streak who identifies with the community; this may include [[cross-dresser]]s, extreme [[body modification]] enthusiasts, [[animal roleplay|animal players]], latex or [[rubber fetishism|rubber aficionados]], and others.

B/D, a form of BDSM, is bondage and discipline. Bondage includes the restraint of the body or mind.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Perks, problems, and the people who play: A qualitative exploration of dominant and submissive BDSM roles|journal = The Canadian Journal of Human Sexuality|date = 1 January 2015|volume = 24|issue = 1|doi = 10.3138/cjhs.2467|first = Ali|last = Hébert|first2 = Angela|last2 = Weaver|pages=49–62}}&lt;/ref&gt; D/S means "dominant and submissive." A dominant is someone who takes control of someone who wishes to give up control. A submissive is someone who gives up the control to a person who wishes to take control.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; S/M (sadism and masochism) means an individual who takes pleasure in the humiliation or pain of others. Masochism means an individual who takes pleasure from their own pain or humiliation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Unlike the usual "power neutral" relationships and play styles commonly followed by couples, activities and relationships within a BDSM context are often characterized by the participants' taking on complementary, but unequal roles; thus, the idea of [[informed consent]] of both the partners becomes essential. Participants who exert sexual dominance over their partners are known as dominants or [[Top (BDSM)|tops]], while participants who take the passive, receiving, or obedient role are known as submissives or [[bottom (BDSM)|bottoms]].

Individuals are also sometimes abbreviated when referred to in writing, so a dominant person may be referred to as a "dom" for a man or a woman.  Sometimes a woman may choose to use the female specific term "Domme".  Both terms are pronounced the same when spoken.  Individuals who can change between top/dominant and bottom/submissive roles—whether from relationship to relationship or within a given relationship—are known as ''switches''. The precise definition of roles and self-identification is a common subject of debate within the community.&lt;ref name="Terms"&gt;{{cite web|last=Grau|first=Johnson|url=http://www.leathernroses.com/generalbdsm/ssbbfaqdefines.htm|title=What do B&amp;D, S&amp;M, D&amp;S, "top", "bottom" mean|publisher=Leather Roses|date=1995|accessdate=27 January 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080111223259/http://www.leathernroses.com/generalbdsm/ssbbfaqdefines.htm| archivedate= 11 January 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Submissivepup.jpg|thumb]]
In a 2013 study, the researchers state that BDSM is a sexual act where they play role games, use restraint, use power exchange,
use suppression and pain is sometimes involved depending on individual(s).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Psychological Characteristics of BDSM Practitioners|journal = The Journal of Sexual Medicine|date = 1 January 2013|volume = 10|issue = 8|doi = 10.1111/jsm.12192|pmid = 23679066|first = Andreas A.J.|last = Wismeijer|first2 = Marcel A.L.M. van|last2 = Assen|pages=1943–1952}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study serves to challenge the widespread notion that BDSM could be in some way linked to [[psychopathology]]. According to the findings, one who participates in BDSM may have greater strength socially and mentally as well as greater independence than those who do not practice BDSM.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It suggests that people who participate in BDSM play have higher subjective well-being, and that this might be due to the fact that BDSM play requires extensive communication. Before any sexual act occurs, the partners must discuss their agreement of their relationship. They discuss how long the play will last, the intensity, their actions, what each participant needs or desires. The sexual acts are all recorded as consensual and pleasurable to both parties.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In a 2015 study, interviewed BDSM participants have mentioned that the activities have helped to create higher levels of connection, intimacy, trust and communication between partners.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The study suggests that dominants and submissives exchange control for each other's pleasure and to satisfy a need. The participants have remarked that they enjoy pleasing their partner in any way they can and many surveyed have felt that this is one of the best things about BDSM. It gives a submissive pleasure to do things in general for their dominant. Where a Dominant enjoys making their encounters all about the submissive. They enjoy doing things that makes their submissive happy. The findings indicate that the surveyed submissives and dominants found BDSM play more pleasurable and fun. The participants have also mentioned improvements in their personal growth, romantic relationships, sense of community and self, the dominant's confidence, and their coping with everyday things by giving them a psychological release.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Legal issues==
{{Main|Sex and the law}}
There are many laws and social customs which prohibit, or in some way affect sexual activities. These laws and customs vary from country to country, and have varied over time. They cover, for example, a prohibition to non-consensual sex, to sex outside marriage, to sexual activity in public, besides many others. Many of these restrictions are non-controversial, but some have been the subject of public debate.

Most societies consider it a serious crime to force someone to engage in sexual acts or to engage in sexual activity with someone who does not consent. This is called [[sexual assault]], and if sexual penetration occurs it is called rape, the most serious kind of sexual assault. The details of this distinction may vary among different legal jurisdictions. Also, what constitutes effective consent in sexual matters varies from culture to culture and is frequently debated. Laws regulating the minimum age at which a person can consent to have sex ([[age of consent]]) are frequently the subject of debate, as is [[adolescent sexual behavior]] in general. Some societies have forced marriage, where consent may not be required.

===Same-sex laws===
{{Main|LGBT rights by country or territory}}
Many locales have laws that limit or prohibit [[Same-sex relationship|same-sex sexual activity]].

===Sex outside marriage===
In the West, sex before marriage is not illegal{{Example needed|date=October 2018}}. There are social taboos and many religions condemn pre-marital sex.

Other studies have analyzed the changing attitudes about sex that American adolescents have outside marriage.  Adolescents were asked how they felt about oral and vaginal sex in relation to their health, social, and emotional well-being.  Overall, teenagers felt that oral sex was viewed as more socially positive amongst their demographic.&lt;ref name="Halpern-Feisher, B.L. 2005"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Halpern-Feisher B.L. |author2=Cornell J.L. |author3=Kropp R.Y. |author4=Tschann J.M. | year = 2005 | title = Oral Versus Vaginal Sex Among Adolescents: Perceptions, Attitudes, and Behaviour | url = | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 115 | issue = 4| pages = 845–851 | doi = 10.1542/peds.204-2108 |doi-broken-date=2018-10-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Results stated that teenagers believed that oral sex for dating and non-dating adolescents was less threatening to their overall values and beliefs than vaginal sex was.&lt;ref name="Halpern-Feisher, B.L. 2005"/&gt; When asked, teenagers who participated in the research viewed oral sex as more acceptable to their peers, and their personal values than vaginal sex.&lt;ref name="Halpern-Feisher, B.L. 2005"/&gt;

Some jurisdictions also make allowances for young people engaged in sexual acts with each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/canada-s-age-of-consent-raised-by-2-years-1.754941|title=Canada's age of consent raised by 2 years|publisher=CBC News|date=1 May 2008|accessdate=22 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Incestuous relationships===
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2018}}

Most jurisdictions prohibit sexual activity between certain close relatives. These laws vary to some extent; such acts are called [[incest]]uous.

===Sexual abuse===
{{Main|Sexual abuse|Rape|Sexual assault}}

Non-consensual sexual activity or subjecting an unwilling person to witnessing a sexual activity are forms of [[sexual abuse]], as well as (in many countries) certain non-consensual paraphilias such as [[frotteurism]], [[telephone scatophilia]] (indecent phonecalls), and non-consensual [[exhibitionism]] and [[voyeurism]] (known as "[[indecent exposure]]" and "[[Voyeurism|peeping tom]]" respectively).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Lawrence Greenfeld |url=http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/SOO.PDF |format=PDF |title=Sex Offenses and Offenders |publisher=U.S. Department of Justice |date=6 February 1997 |accessdate=25 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prostitution and survival sex===
{{main|Prostitution}}
People sometimes exchange sex for money or access to other resources. This practice, called prostitution, takes place under many varied circumstances. The person who receives payment for sexual services is called a prostitute and the person who receives such services is known by a multitude of terms, including (and most commonly) "john." Prostitution is one of the branches of the [[sex industry]]. The [[prostitution and the law|legal status of prostitution]] varies from [[Prostitution by country|country to country]], from being a punishable crime to a regulated profession. Estimates place the annual revenue generated from the global prostitution industry to be over $100&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.havocscope.com/activities/prostitution/| title= Prostitution Market Value| accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prostitution is sometimes referred to as "the world's oldest profession".&lt;ref&gt;The prostitution of women and girls – Page 5; Ronald B. Flowers – 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Prostitution may be a voluntary individual activity or facilitated or [[forced prostitution|forced]] by [[pimp]]s.

[[Survival sex]] is a form of prostitution engaged in by people in need, usually when [[homeless]] or otherwise disadvantaged people trade sex for food, a place to sleep, or other [[basic needs]], or for [[Recreational drug use|drugs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Flowers|first=R.

Sweigard borrowed the word ''ideokinesis'', composed by two Greek words: ideo (thought) and kinesis (movement), from Bonpensière, a piano teacher, who applied imagery to his methodology.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3919">'''Immanent critique''' is a method of discussing culture which aims to locate contradictions in society's rules and systems. This method is used in the study of cultural forms in philosophy and the social sciences and humanities. It may be contrasted with "transcendental" [[Immanuel Kant|Kantian]]  [[critical philosophy]]. Immanent critique further aims to contextualize not only the object of its investigation, but also the [[ideology|ideological]] basis of that object: both the object and the category to which it belongs are shown to be products of a historical process. Immanent critique has its roots in the dialectic of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] and the criticisms by [[Karl Marx]]. Today it is strongly associated with the [[critical theory|critical theorists]] such as [[Theodor Adorno]] as well as literary theorists such as [[Fredric Jameson]] who, in his seminal work [[The Political Unconscious]], explored the idea of an immanent analysis of texts to argue the primacy of political interpretation. [[Roy Bhaskar]] has advocated it as one of the key methodological elements of [[critical realism (philosophy of the social sciences)|critical realism]].&lt;ref&gt;Bhaskar, R. (2008) [1975], ''A Realist Theory of Science'' (Routledge 'With a new introduction' edition), Abingdon: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of immanent critique is the detection of societal contradictions which suggest possibilities for emancipatory social change. It considers ideas’ role in shaping society, with focus on future emancipatory change. An immanent critique of a value is a discussion of the principles (overt or implicit) the value proposes. It highlights the gaps between what something stands for and what is being done in actual terms. Immanent critique tries to find contradictions and indirectly provide alternatives, without constructing an entirely new theory.

Quoting Marx, Robert J. Antonio writes in the ''[[British Journal of Sociology]]'',
:"'Setting out from [[idealism]] ... I hit upon seeking the Idea in the real itself. If formerly the gods had dwelt above the world, they had now become its center.' Marx concluded that immanent principles were necessary weapons in the struggle for progressive social change, because they provide a basis for critique ''within'' historical reality. Later, this immanent grounding became the axis of his emancipatory critique of [[capitalism]]."&lt;ref&gt;"Immanent critique as the core of critical theory." ''British Journal of Sociology'' Vol. 32, No. 3, p. 333 (1981)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[David Harvey]], formerly of the [[University of Nevada, Reno]],

:"Critical theory at its most abstract and general level ... begins as a formal 'negativity.' As a dissenting motif, it selects some tradition, ideological premise, or institutionalized orthodoxy for analysis. As immanent critique, it then 'enters its object,' so to speak, '[[boring from within]].' Provisionally accepting the methodological presuppositions, substantive premises, and truth-claims of orthodoxy as its own, immanent critique tests the postulates of orthodoxy by the latter's own standards of proof and accuracy. Upon 'entering' the theory, orthodoxy's premises and assertions are registered and certain strategic contradictions located. These contradictions are then developed according to their own logic, and at some point in this process of internal expansion, the one-sided proclamations of orthodoxy collapse as material instances and their contradictions are allowed to develop 'naturally.'"&lt;ref&gt;''Sociological Perspectives: Vol 33, No. 1, "Critical Theory," p. 5 (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Inhibitory control''', also known as '''response inhibition''', is a [[cognitive process]]&amp;nbsp; and more specifically, an [[executive function]]&amp;nbsp;– that permits an individual to inhibit their [[impulse (psychology)|impulses]] and natural, habitual, or dominant behavioral responses to stimuli ({{aka}} '''prepotent responses'''&lt;!--term redirects here: bolded per MOS:BOLD--&gt;) in order to select a more appropriate behavior that is consistent with completing their goals.&lt;ref name="Cognitive and motivational effects"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ilieva IP, Hook CJ, Farah MJ | title = Prescription Stimulants' Effects on Healthy Inhibitory Control, Working Memory, and Episodic Memory: A Meta-analysis | journal = J Cogn Neurosci | volume = 27| issue = | pages = 1–21 | year = 2015 | pmid = 25591060 | doi = 10.1162/jocn_a_00776}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Executive functions" /&gt; [[Self-control]] is an important aspect of inhibitory control.&lt;ref name="Cognitive and motivational effects" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Executive functions"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Diamond A | title = Executive functions | journal = Annu Rev Psychol | volume = 64 | issue = | pages = 135–168 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23020641 | pmc = 4084861 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-psych-113011-143750 | quote = Core EFs are inhibition [response inhibition (self-control—resisting temptations and resisting acting impulsively) and interference control (selective attention and cognitive inhibition)], working memory, and cognitive flexibility (including creatively thinking “outside the box,” seeing anything from different perspectives, and quickly and flexibly adapting to changed circumstances).&amp;nbsp;... EFs and prefrontal cortex are the first to suffer, and suffer disproportionately, if something is not right in your life. They suffer first, and most, if you are stressed (Arnsten 1998, Liston et al. 2009, Oaten &amp; Cheng 2005), sad (Hirt et al. 2008, von Hecker &amp; Meiser 2005), lonely (Baumeister et al. 2002, Cacioppo &amp; Patrick 2008, Campbell et al. 2006, Tun et al. 2012), sleep deprived (Barnes et al. 2012, Huang et al. 2007), or not physically fit (Best 2010, Chaddock et al. 2011, Hillman et al. 2008). Any of these can cause you to appear to have a disorder of EFs, such as ADHD, when you do not. You can see the deleterious effects of stress, sadness, loneliness, and lack of physical health or fitness at the physiological and neuroanatomical level in prefrontal cortex and at the behavioral level in worse EFs (poorer reasoning and problem solving, forgetting things, and impaired ability to exercise discipline and self-control).&amp;nbsp;...&lt;br /&gt;EFs can be improved (Diamond &amp; Lee 2011, Klingberg 2010).&amp;nbsp;... At any age across the life cycle EFs can be improved, including in the elderly and in infants. There has been much work with excellent results on improving EFs in the elderly by improving physical fitness (Erickson &amp; Kramer 2009, Voss et al. 2011)&amp;nbsp;... Inhibitory control (one of the core EFs) involves being able to control one’s attention, behavior, thoughts, and/or emotions to override a strong internal predisposition or external lure, and instead do what’s more appropriate or needed. Without inhibitory control we would be at the mercy of impulses, old habits of thought or action (conditioned responses), and/or stimuli in the environment that pull us this way or that. Thus, inhibitory control makes it possible for us to change and for us to choose how we react and how we behave rather than being unthinking creatures of habit. It doesn’t make it easy. Indeed, we usually are creatures of habit and our behavior is under the control of environmental stimuli far more than we usually realize, but having the ability to exercise inhibitory control creates the possibility of change and choice.&amp;nbsp;... The subthalamic nucleus appears to play a critical role in preventing such impulsive or premature responding (Frank 2006).}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NHM-Cognitive Control"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Malenka RC, Nestler EJ, Hyman SE |veditors=Sydor A, Brown RY | title = Molecular Neuropharmacology: A Foundation for Clinical Neuroscience | year = 2009 | publisher = McGraw-Hill Medical | location = New York | isbn = 9780071481274 | pages = 313–321 | edition = 2nd | chapter = Chapter 13: Higher Cognitive Function and Behavioral Control | quote ={{bull}} Executive function, the cognitive control of behavior, depends on the prefrontal cortex, which is highly developed in higher primates and especially humans.&lt;br /&gt;{{bull}} Working memory is a short-term, capacity-limited cognitive buffer that stores information and permits its manipulation to guide decision-making and behavior.&amp;nbsp;...&lt;br /&gt; These diverse inputs and back projections to both cortical and subcortical structures put the prefrontal cortex in a position to exert what is often called “top-down” control or cognitive control of behavior.&amp;nbsp;... The prefrontal cortex receives inputs not only from other cortical regions, including association cortex, but also, via the thalamus, inputs from subcortical structures subserving emotion and motivation, such as the amygdala (Chapter 14) and ventral striatum (or nucleus accumbens; Chapter 15).&amp;nbsp;...&lt;br /&gt;In conditions in which prepotent responses tend to dominate behavior, such as in '''drug addiction''', where drug cues can elicit drug seeking (Chapter 15), or in '''attention deficit hyperactivity disorder''' ('''ADHD'''; described below), significant negative consequences can result.&amp;nbsp;... ADHD can be conceptualized as a disorder of executive function; specifically, ADHD is characterized by reduced ability to exert and maintain cognitive control of behavior. Compared with healthy individuals, those with ADHD have diminished ability to suppress inappropriate prepotent responses to stimuli (impaired response inhibition) and diminished ability to inhibit responses to irrelevant stimuli (impaired interference suppression).&amp;nbsp;... &lt;!--Inhibitory control brain structures--&gt;Functional neuroimaging in humans demonstrates activation of the prefrontal cortex and caudate nucleus (part of the striatum) in tasks that demand inhibitory control of behavior.&amp;nbsp;...

Data to date from studies of aging provide strong evidence of exercise-linked benefits related to task switching, selective attention, inhibition of prepotent responses, and working memory capacity; furthermore, cross-sectional fitness data suggest that working memory updating could potentially benefit as well. In young adults, working memory updating is the main executive function shown to benefit from regular exercise, but cross-sectional data further suggest that task-switching and post-error performance may also benefit. In children, working memory capacity has been shown to benefit, and cross-sectional data suggest potential benefits for selective attention and inhibitory control.&amp;nbsp;... Support for the idea that higher levels of aerobic activity may be associated with superior brain structure has been gained through cross-sectional studies in older adults and children (for a recent review, see Voss, Nagamatsu, et al., 2011).&amp;nbsp;... only those in the aerobic exercise group exhibited improved connectivity between the left and right prefrontal cortices, two areas that are crucial to the effective functioning of the fronto-executive network.&amp;nbsp;... &lt;!--Selective attention--&gt;Together, these studies provide evidence that regular aerobic exercise benefits control over responses during selective attention in older adults.&amp;nbsp;... &lt;!--Inhibitory control--&gt;aerobic fitness is a good predictor of performance on tasks that rely relatively heavily on inhibitory control over prepotent responses (e.g., Colcombe et al., 2004, Study 1; Prakash et al., 2011) and also that regular aerobic exercise ''improves'' performance on such tasks&amp;nbsp;... &lt;!--Working memory--&gt;Overall, the results from the span and Sternberg tasks suggest that regular exercise can also confer benefits for the volume of information that children and older adults can hold in mind at one time.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cognitive control of exercise"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Buckley J, Cohen JD, Kramer AF, McAuley E, Mullen SP | title = Cognitive control in the self-regulation of physical activity and sedentary behavior | journal = Front Hum Neurosci | volume = 8 | issue = | page = 747 | year = 2014 | pmid = 25324754 | pmc = 4179677 | doi = 10.3389/fnhum.2014.00747 | quote = Recent theory (e.g., Temporal Self-Regulation Theory; Hall and Fong, 2007, 2010, 2013) and evidence suggest that the relation between physical activity and cognitive control is reciprocal (Daly et al., 2013). Most research has focused on the beneficial effects of regular physical activity on executive functions-the set of neural processes that define cognitive control. Considerable evidence shows that regular physical activity is associated with enhanced cognitive functions, including attention, processing speed, task switching&lt;!--cognitive flexibility--&gt;, inhibition of prepotent responses&lt;!--inhibitory control--&gt; and declarative memory (for reviews see Colcombe and Kramer, 2003; Smith et al., 2010; Guiney and Machado, 2013; McAuley et al., 2013). Recent research demonstrates a dose-response relationship between fitness and spatial memory (Erickson et al., 2011)&amp;nbsp;... The effects of physical activity on cognitive control appear to be underpinned by a variety of brain processes including: increased hippocampal volume, increased gray matter density in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), upregulation of neurotrophins and greater microvascular density&amp;nbsp;... Together, this research suggests that an improvement in control processes, such as attention and inhibition or interference control, is associated with an improvement in self-regulation of physical activity.&amp;nbsp;... Increasingly, research shows that cognitive control abilities are malleable, and that cognitive training can produce positive cognitive outcomes and improvements in daily function (Willis et al., 2006; Hertzog et al., 2008) that can have long-lasting effects (Rebok et al., 2014). Approaches to cognitive training are numerous and varied; however, the relative superiority of different approaches with regard to training and transfer continue to be debated. }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, successfully suppressing the natural behavioral response to eat cake when one is craving it while dieting requires the use of inhibitory control.&lt;ref name="Executive functions" /&gt;

The [[prefrontal cortex]], [[caudate nucleus]], and [[subthalamic nucleus]] are known to regulate inhibitory control cognition.&lt;ref name="Executive functions" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NHM-Cognitive Control" /&gt; Inhibitory control is impaired in both [[addiction]] and [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]].&lt;ref name="Executive functions" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NHM-Cognitive Control" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19710631"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koob GF, Volkow ND | title = Neurocircuitry of addiction | journal = Neuropsychopharmacology | volume = 35 | issue = 1 | pages = 217–38 | year = 2010 | pmid = 19710631 | pmc = 2805560 | doi = 10.1038/npp.2009.110 | quote = Animal and human imaging studies have revealed&amp;nbsp;... a key role in the preoccupation/anticipation stage for a widely distributed network involving the orbitofrontal cortex-dorsal striatum, prefrontal cortex, basolateral amygdala, hippocampus, and insula involved in craving and the cingulate gyrus, dorsolateral prefrontal, and inferior frontal cortices in disrupted inhibitory control.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In healthy adults and ADHD individuals, inhibitory control improves over the short term with  low (therapeutic) doses of [[methylphenidate]] or [[amphetamine]].&lt;ref name="Cognitive and motivational effects" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Unambiguous PFC D1 A2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Spencer RC, Devilbiss DM, Berridge CW | title = The Cognition-Enhancing Effects of Psychostimulants Involve Direct Action in the Prefrontal Cortex | journal = Biol.

==Tests==
An '''inhibitory control test''' is a [[neuropsychological test]] that measures an individual's ability to override their natural, habitual, or dominant behavioral response to a stimulus in order to implement more adaptive {{nowrap|goal-oriented}} behaviors.&lt;ref name="Cognitive and motivational effects" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Executive functions" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NHM-Cognitive Control" /&gt;  Some of the neuropsychological tests that measure inhibitory control include the [[Stroop task]], [[go/no-go]] task, [[Simon task]], [[Flanker task]], [[antisaccade task]]s, [[delayed gratification|delay of gratification]] tasks, and stop-signal tasks.&lt;ref name="Executive functions" /&gt;

==Research==

Females tend to have a greater basal capacity to exert inhibitory control over undesired or habitual behaviors and respond differently to modulatory environmental contextual factors relative to males.&lt;ref name="Inhibitory control sex differences"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mansouri FA, Fehring DJ, Gaillard A, Jaberzadeh S, Parkington H | title = Sex dependency of inhibitory control functions | journal = Biol Sex Differ | volume = 7 | issue = | pages = 11 | year = 2016 | pmid = 26862388 | pmc = 4746892 | doi = 10.1186/s13293-016-0065-y | quote = Inhibition of irrelevant responses is an important aspect of cognitive control of a goal-directed behavior.

Jenkins &amp; Berthier (2014) conducted a study on working memory and inhibitory response in toddlers.&lt;ref name="Jenkins" /&gt; The toddlers that participated were between the ages of two and three years of age.&lt;ref name="Jenkins" /&gt; Thirty six children were recruited, twenty of them were males and sixteen were females; most of the children were closer to 3 years of age (34 months).&lt;ref name="Jenkins" /&gt; The way these subjects were recruited was via telephone calls and letters from birth state records that were found.&lt;ref name="Jenkins" /&gt; The purpose of this study was to determine which type of test helped increase memory retention in toddlers. There were four types of test, the door task, three boxes-stationary task, three boxes scrambled, and the three pegs task.&lt;ref name="Jenkins" /&gt; Three of these tests were working memory tasks and one was an inhibitory/cognitive control test. The first test that was given was the door task; in this task children were asked to sit in front of an item or electronic device that consisted of a pathway where balls could be rolled down into different slots. A barrier was included to mislead the child and test the memory of what slot the ball went into.&lt;ref name="Jenkins" /&gt; They were then instructed to search or point at where the hidden ball had landed. The second test was called three boxes stationary task. This test asked the participants to select a box of their choice that contained certain treats.&lt;ref name="Jenkins" /&gt; The child kept getting distracted as the researcher pulled away the boxes and brought them back to his/her attention to choose the right box where the treat was in; along with this test the child was provided with feedback.&lt;ref name="Jenkins" /&gt;  The third test was similar to the second test; the only difference was that the boxes were scrambled. The last test consisted of a three peg task, this measured inhibitory control, in this test children were asked to identify pegs. The results of this study found that the inhibitory control test was the most effective in allowing the child to remember things. The improvements were found due to an increase in attention and reaction time.&lt;ref name="Jenkins" /&gt; Most of these tasks involved analyzing a part of the brain called the [[prefrontal cortex]].&lt;ref name="Jenkins"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Jenkins I, Berthier N | year = 2014 | title = Working memory and inhibitory control in visually guided manual search in toddlers | url = | journal = Developmental Psychobiology | volume =  | issue = | page =  | doi = 10.1002/dev.21205 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Initiation''' is a concept in [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] that there are nine levels of spiritual development that beings who live on Earth can progress upward through.  Within these levels, there are four basic levels of spiritual development that human beings on Earth progress through as they [[Reincarnation|reincarnate]], although [[evil]] acts may cause bad [[karma]] which may cause one to temporarily regress.  It is believed that when [[soul]]s have advanced to the fourth level of initiation, they have reached [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]] and have no further need to reincarnate.  At the fifth level of initiation and beyond, souls  have the opportunity to become members of the [[Spiritual Hierarchy]].  This concept was developed by both [[C. W. Leadbeater]] and [[Alice A. Bailey]] beginning in the 1920s.
  
According to C.W. Leadbeater, ''Initiation'' is a process by which "we try to develop ourselves not that we may become great and wise, but that we may have the power and knowledge to work for humanity to the best effect."&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path'' Adyar, Madras, India: 1925 – Theosophical Publishing House Page 166&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Alice A. Bailey, ''Initiation'' is the "process of undergoing an [[Higher consciousness|expansion [toward higher levels] of consciousness]]"&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Alice A. ''Initiation, Human and Solar'' New York: 1922 – Lucis Publishing, page 12&lt;/ref&gt;  It is believed by Theosophists that all [[soul]]s that have reached the fourth level of initiation and evolved beyond the necessity to [[reincarnate]] that do not elect to become [[pratyeka buddha]]s and go directly into [[Spiritual Hierarchy#Cosmic beings governing Nirvana|Nirvana]] gradually evolve upward through all of these six higher levels of consciousness over thousands or millions of years, and later over billions or trillions of years, other higher levels yet beyond.    

The concept of ''Initiation'' is also recognized in the [[Ascended Master Teachings]], a group of [[religion]]s loosely based on Theosophy.  In the Ascended Master Teachings, it is referred to as ''[[Ascended Master Teachings#Ascension|Ascension]]''.  

The first six initiations were named by C.W. Leadbeater and Alice A. Bailey after the six most important events in the life of [[Jesus]].

According to Martin Euser, “Theosophy closes the gap between science and religion by positing reincarnation as a dynamic process [ unlike the concept of the [[eternal return]] ].  The first jewel concerns the doctrine of reincarnation or reimbodiment. It's all a dynamic process and it's the way nature works.”&lt;ref&gt;Euser, Martin ''Science and Spirituality in the New Millennium'' 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Initiation zero==
{{Theosophy}}
The vast majority of ordinary humanity lies on the probationary path (below the first initiation).

==First initiation ("birth" to the spiritual life)==
According to Alice A. Bailey, at the first initiation one gains full control of the [[physical body]].&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Alice A. ''Initiation, Human and Solar'' New York: 1922 – Lucis Publishing, page 82&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Benjamin Creme]], there are 800,000 people at this level of initiation.&lt;ref name="Creme, Benjamin Page 195"&gt;Creme, Benjamin ''Maitreya's Mission'' Amsterdam:1986 Share International Foundation Page 195&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Ascended Master Teachings, a soul that reaches this level is referred to as having attained their ''[[Ascended Master Teachings#The Individualized "I AM" Presence|Individualized "I AM" Presence]]'', the prerequisite for further spiritual advancement.

==Second initiation ("baptism")==
Alice A. Bailey states that at the second initiation, one gains full control of the [[astral body]].&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Alice A. ''Initiation, Human and Solar'' New York: 1922 – Lucis Publishing, page 85&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Benjamin Creme, there are 240,000 people at this level of initiation.&lt;ref name="Creme, Benjamin Page 195"/&gt;

==Third initiation ("the transfiguration")==
An individual who is at the level of the third initiation has acquired fully developed [[clairvoyance]] and [[clairaudience]].&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Alice A. ''Initiation, Human and Solar'' New York: 1922 – Lucis Publishing, page 87&lt;/ref&gt; According to Benjamin Creme, there are somewhere between 2,000 and 3,000 people at this level of initiation.&lt;ref name="Creme, Benjamin Page 195"/&gt;

==Fourth initiation ("the crucifixion")==
An individual reaching the fourth initiation is known as the perfected one, or an [[Arhat]] ([[Pali]]) or a [[Paramahamsa]] ([[Sanskrit]]).  

At this level, it is believed in Buddhism, one has the ability to remember all of one's [[past lives]], and one also has various minor [[siddhi]]s capable of affecting one's immediate environment.  

Symbolically the fourth initiation is denoted as the ''[[crucifixion]]'' initiation. An Arhat is supposed to be one who does not need to be incarnated again to develop spiritually.  According to Benjamin Creme, there are 450 people at this level of initiation.&lt;ref name="Creme, Benjamin Page 195"/&gt;

==="The seven choices before the perfect [hu]man"===
Having reached the threshold of the fifth initiation, a soul does not necessarily have to enter Earth's spiritual hierarchy proper as one of the "Masters of the Ancient Wisdom".  One has seven paths forward to higher levels that they can choose to go forward on, only one of which is to become a "Master of the Ancient Wisdom".  These seven choices, called in Theosophical literature "the seven choices before the perfect [hu]man" are:

:1.  "Remain with humanity as on official of the Hierarchy", i.e., become one of the [[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom]].
:2.  "Remain with humanity as a "[[Nirmanakaya]]", i.e., become a [[bodhisattva]].
:3.  "Join the [[Deva (New Age)|Devas]]".
:4.  "Join the [[Spiritual Hierarchy#Cosmic beings functioning within the Sun|Staff Corps of the Solar Logos]]", i.e., join the Masters living in etheric cities inside the Sun who supervise the activities of the [[Deva (New Age)|Solar Angels]] that direct the process of evolution of the life waves (process of reincarnation) of the beings on all the planets of the [[solar system]] (all of whom live except those on Earth live on the [[etheric plane]]s of their planets).
:5.  "Prepare the work of the [[Round (Theosophy)|next Chain]]", i.e. join that subsection of the ''Staff Corps of the Solar Logos'' who are the solar planners who plan the future development of planetary civilizations in this solar system.
:6.&amp;7. "Enter [[Spiritual Hierarchy#Cosmic beings governing Nirvana|Nirvana]]", i.e., become a [[Pratyekabuddha]].&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, E.L. ''The Web of the Universe'' London:1936 Theosophical Publishing House "The Seven Choices Before the Perfect Man" Page 97&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/weboftheuniverse032400mbp/weboftheuniverse032400mbp_djvu.txt "Web of the Universe" text on Internet:]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Text available at https://archive.org/stream/weboftheuniverse032400mbp/weboftheuniverse032400mbp_djvu.txt – Does not clarify points 6&amp;7. --&gt;

==Fifth initiation ("the resurrection")==
The fifth initiation, called the ''[[resurrection]]'', comprises the first rung of beings designated in Theosophy as [[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom]] and in the Ascended Master Teachings as [[Ascended master]]s.  

Siddhis at this level include the ability to [[Teleportation|teleport]] and [[Bilocation|bilocate]] moderate
distances and [[Levitation (paranormal)|levitate]] within a localized area. 

According to [[C. W. Leadbeater]], [[Alice Bailey]] and Benjamin Creme, there are a total of 43 beings at this level of initiation; this figure is arrived at because all three have stated there are a total of 60 Masters in all—subtracting from the 60 the 17 Masters at level six and above identified by C. W. Leadbeater, leaves a total of 43 Masters of the Ancient Wisdom at the fifth level of initiation. 

Of these 43 Masters, a total of 12 have been identified by name, one by C. W. Leadbeater, nine by Alice Bailey, and two by Benjamin Creme.  

C. W. Leadbeater named a Master called '''Master Jupiter''' who lives in [[India]] that is involved with overseeing the people, government, and development of India that is at this level.&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C. W. ''The Masters and the Path'' Adyar, Madras, India: 1925 – Theosophical Publishing House, page 33&lt;/ref&gt; 

Alice A. Bailey identified as Masters the '''Master P.''', who is said to help ''St. Germain'' bring about the [[Age of Aquarius]] in the Americas, and two different ''English Masters'' ('''English Master #1''' and '''English Master #2'''), one of which is said to have inspired the [[labor movement]].&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Alice A. ''The Externalisation of the Hierarchy'' New York:1957&amp;mdash;Lucis Press (Compilation of earlier [[revelation]]s by Alice A. Bailey) Master P. Page 682; See numerous references to "English Master" in Index&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to these three, she identified the three ''Lords of Liberation'' – ('''Lord of Liberation #1''', '''Lord of Liberation #2''', and '''Lord of Liberation #3''').  According to Alice A. Bailey, the three ''Lords of Liberation'' formulated the slogan ''[[Liberty, equality, brotherhood|Liberty, Equality, Fraternity]]''.  Finally, Alice A. Bailey also identified the three ''Lords of Karma'' ('''Lord of Karma #1''', '''Lord of Karma #2''', and '''Lord of Karma #3''').  These three beings are said to live in [[Shamballah]] and help ''Sanat Kumara'' decide where and when [[soul]]s are going to [[Reincarnation|incarnate]] in their next life.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Alice A. ''The Externalisation of the Hierarchy'' New York:1957&amp;mdash;Lucis Press (Compilation of earlier [[revelation]]s by Alice A. Bailey) "Lords of Liberation"&lt;/ref&gt; 

Benjamin Creme identified two previously unidentified Masters at this level in 2001—he stated that there is a '''Master in Moscow'''&lt;ref&gt;Creme, Benjamin ''The Great Approach: New Light and Life for Humanity'' Amsterdam:2001 Share International Foundation Page 179&lt;/ref&gt; and a '''Master in Tokyo''',&lt;ref&gt;Creme, Benjamin ''The Great Approach: New Light and Life for Humanity'' Amsterdam:2001 Share International Foundation Page 177&lt;/ref&gt; but did not give their personal names.    

Forty-three minus 12 equals 31 Masters of the Ancient Wisdom at this level that are still unidentified by name.

[[Guy Ballard]] and [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]] have identified, named, and received dictations from at least 200 new "[[Ascended Master]]s" at this level;&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press "Profiles of the Ascended Masters" – pages 13–394 More than 200 "Ascended Masters" are listed&lt;/ref&gt; however, these Masters are not recognized as Masters of the Ancient Wisdom by traditional Theosophists.  Ascended Masters named by Guy Ballard and Elizabeth Clare Prophet at this level include such Masters as '''[[Confucius]]''', '''[[Lord Ling]]''', '''[[Master Jesus#Twin flame|Lady Master Magda]]''', '''[[Athena|Pallas Athena]]''', '''[[Master Lanello|Lanello]]''',  '''[[Kwan Yin]]''', the '''Great Divine Director''', '''[[Padre Pio]]''',  '''[[Master Godfre|Godfre]]''' and his "twin flame" (celestial wife) '''[[Lady Master Lotus]]''', and many dozens more.

In the Ascended Master Teachings, the ''Master Jupiter'' is referred to as '''Chananda'''.&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press Chananda Pages 54–55&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Ascended Master Teachings, ''Sanat Kumara'' has a grandson named '''[[Sanat Kumara#Master Cha Ara|Master Cha Ara]]''' who is half mortal and who just recently became a Master, therefore meaning he is functioning at the fifth level.

==Sixth initiation ("the ascension" or "masterhood")==
The Chohans (Lords) of the [[Seven Rays]] – '''[[Morya (Theosophy)|Morya]]''' (1st Ray), Master '''[[Koot Hoomi]]''' (2nd Ray), '''[[Paul the Venetian]]''' (3rd Ray), '''[[Serapis Bey]]''' (4th Ray), '''[[Master Hilarion]]''' (5th Ray), '''[[Master Jesus]]''' (6th Ray), and the '''[[St. Germain (Theosophy)|Master Rakoczi]]''' (7th Ray) – are seven of the beings at the level of the sixth initiation, while their coordinator and [[communications director]] '''[[Djwal Khul]]''' is another, making a total of eight at this level.&lt;ref name="Leadbeater, C.W. Page 248"&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path''. Adyar, India: Theosophical Publishing House 1925 "Diagram 5 – The Spiritual Hierarchy" – facing page 248&lt;/ref&gt; 

All of these Masters are recognized by both traditional Theosophists and those adherent to the Ascended Master Teachings.  In the Ascended Master Teachings, ''Master Rakoczi'' is referred to as  '''[[St. Germain (Theosophy)|St. Germain]]'''.

Siddhis at this level include the ability to teleport, bilocate, or levitate to anyplace on Earth. 

According to the Ascended Master Teachings, on January 1, 1956, the Master Jesus advanced from the sixth to the seventh level of initiation and the '''[[Lady Master Nada]]''' (a ''lady'' Master recognized in the Ascended Master Teachings but not in Theosophy) advanced from the fifth level to the sixth level and replaced the Master Jesus as the chohan of the sixth ray.&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press Page 240&lt;/ref&gt;

==Seventh initiation ("bodhisattva" , "avatar", or "christhood")==
The seventh initiation is known as the initiation of the [[Bodhisattava]] (Buddhism) or the [[Avatar]] (Hinduism). The '''[[Maitreya (Theosophy)|Maitreya]]''' or ''World Teacher'' (known as [[Krishna]] by [[Hindus]], the [[Christ]] by [[Christian]]s, [[Maitreya]] by [[Buddhist]]s, [[Messiah]] by the [[Jew]]s, the Iman [[Mahdi]] by [[Muslims]], and the [[Peshotan]] by the [[Zoroastrian]]s) is at this level.  At this level also are said to be the '''[[Manu (Theosophy)|Chakshusha Manu]]''', the '''[[Manu (Theosophy)|Vaivasvatu Manu]]''' and the '''[[Maha Chohan]]''',&lt;ref name="Leadbeater, C.W. Page 248"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Alice A. ''Initiation, Human and Solar'' New York: 1922, Lucis Publishing Chart, page 49&lt;/ref&gt; thus making a total of four beings at this level.

In  the Ascended Master Teachings, the ''Chakshusha Manu'' is referred to as '''[[Manu (Theosophy)#Ascended master teachings|Lord Himalaya]]'''.

According to Benjamin Creme, a being at this level has the ability to teleport to anyplace in the [[solar system]].&lt;ref&gt;Creme, Benjamin ''Maitreya's Mission – Volume III'' Amsterdam: 1997 Share International Foundation, page 72&lt;/ref&gt; Creme admits, however, that unless one is in a hurry, it's simpler, easier, and uses less energy to just take a [[flying saucer]].  Creme has also stated that beings at this level have a level of [[invulnerability]] such that they would not be affected by a [[bullet]] fired at them, nor even by the detonation of a [[nuclear bomb]].  

In the Ascended Master Teachings, it is believed that on January 1, 1956, Maitreya advanced from the 7th level to the 8th level.  
==Eighth initiation ("buddhahood")==

Level eight is the level of the '''[[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]'''.&lt;ref name="Leadbeater, C.W. Page 248"/&gt;

At this level also, according to C.W. Leadbeater, are '''[[Pratyeka-Buddha|The Three Pratyeka Buddha]]s''' (the task of these three [[Buddhahood|Buddhas]] is to focus the Seven Rays from ''Sanat Kumara'' through ''Djwal Khul'' to the chohans of the Seven Rays).&lt;ref name="Leadbeater, C.W. Page 248"/&gt; Unlike Buddha, the three Pratyeka Buddhas do not interact with the human race except for fulfilling their function of focusing the seven rays.

Alice A. Bailey stated that communication among beings at this level is entirely by [[telepathy]].  According to Theosophist [[Alfred Percy Sinnett]], beings at this level can freely roam both in [[interplanetary space]] and in nearby [[interstellar space]] in full consciousness while physically remaining in their celestialized bodies and carrying on normal activities such as communicating with other beings.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alfred Percy Sinnett|Sinnett, A. P.]] ''Esoteric Buddhism'', London 1883&lt;/ref&gt;   In order for beings at this level to be able to do this, it would have been  necessary for them to have activated their transpersonal chakras.  Benjamin Creme and Elizabeth Clare Prophet have stated that beings at this level can teleport as far as the star [[Sirius]].  

This makes four beings at this level, according to traditional Theosophy.

In the Ascended Master Teachings, it is believed that on January 1, 1956, Buddha advanced from the 8th level to the 9th level, becoming co-equal with ''Sanat Kumara''.

The three Pratyeka Buddhas have not been mentioned so far in any of the Ascended Master Teachings. Elizabeth Clare Prophet described and quoted from Buddhist sources on the [[Five Dhyani Buddhas]] of mainstream [[Mahayana]] and [[Vajrayana Buddhism]]. They focus the five inner rays which together with the seven more external rays focused by the Chohans comprise the [[Ascended Master Teachings#The rays o ascension|twelve rays]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]] ''Vol. 37 No. 2 The Buddhas in Winter 2 Introduction to the Five Dhyani Buddhas and Their Mandala, p2'', January 9, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tsl.org/tag/dhyani-buddhas/ "The five Dhyani Buddhas" on TSL.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ninth initiation ("godhood")==
Level nine is the "Lord of the World": '''[[Sanat Kumara]]''' –  "The Eternal Youth" and "The Ancient of Days", the [[Nordic alien]] that is believed by Theosophists to be the "Lord of the World", i.e., the governing [[deity]] of Earth.&lt;ref name="Leadbeater, C.W. Page 248"/&gt;

C.W. Leadbeater discussed the abilities of beings at this level.  He stated that Sanat Kumara's "consciousness is of so extended a nature that it comprehends at once all the life on our globe.  In his hands are the powers of cyclic destruction, for he wields ''Fohat'' [i.e. beams composed of "[[Micro black hole|bubbles in space]]" used by Theosophical deities to materialize or dematerialize material objects&lt;ref&gt;Powell, A.E. ''The Solar System: A Complete Outline of the Theosophical Scheme of Evolution'' London:1930 The Theosophical Publishing House Page 19&lt;/ref&gt;] in its higher forms and can deal directly with cosmic forces outside our chain [i.e., outside our solar system]."&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path''. Adyar, India: Theosophical Publishing House 1925 Page 296&lt;/ref&gt; Thus according to Leadbeater powers of beings at this level include [[omniscience]] regarding the events occurring on a single inhabited planet, [[Materialization (paranormal)|materialization]] of large objects, and the ability to affect at a distance to some degree happenings in other nearby [[planetary system]]s.  

According to the Ascended Master Teachings, Sanat Kumara has a "twin flame" (celestial wife) named '''[[Sanat Kumara#Lady Master Venus|Lady Master Venus]]''' who he brought with him from Venus, as well as a daughter named '''[[Sanat Kumara#Lady Master Meta|Lady Master Meta]]''' born to them on Venus who they brought with them to Earth, both of them presumably also functioning at the ninth level of initiation.

==Tenth initiation ("planetary logos")==
The tenth initiation is considered to symbolize perfection and is used to describe the '''Planetary Logos''', also called the '''Spirit of the Earth''', and specifically denoted as the '''[[Spiritual Hierarchy#Cosmic being functioning within Earth|Planetary Logos of Earth]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;Powell, A.E. ''The Solar System: A Complete Outline of the Theosophical Scheme of Evolution'' London:1930 The Theosophical Publishing House Chapter XXVI – "The Building of the Earth" ''The Planetary Logos'', pages 162–163&lt;/ref&gt; In order to reach the status of a ''Planetary Logos'', this being would have had to have been a high level ''[[Deva (New Age)|Planetary Deva]]'' in some other solar system before it incarnated inside our planet at the time of the [[Creation myth|creation of the world]]. According to C. W. Leadbeater, the "Planetary Logos" is functioning at the tenth level of initiation and [[Sanat Kumara]], in continuous telepathic rapport with the Planetary Logos, functions as its spokes-deity.  Since the formulation in the early 1970s by [[James Lovelock]] of the [[Gaia theory|Gaia hypothesis]], many Theosophists and those adherent to the Ascended Master Teachings, adopting the [[Gaia philosophy]], nowadays simply refer to the "Planetary Logos of Earth" as '''[[New Age Gaian|Gaia]]''', the New Age version of what in many religions is called the [[Mother goddess#Earth Mother|Earth mother]]..

==Levels of initiation beyond the tenth level==
In the theosophical teachings of Alice Bailey, there is a powerful being living inside the sun serving the Solar Logos called the '''[[Spiritual Hierarchy#Cosmic beings functioning within the Sun|Avatar of Synthesis]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Alice A. ''The Externalisation of the Hierarchy'' New York:1957 Lucis Publishing Co. See "Avatar of Synthesis" in the Index&lt;/ref&gt; Its job is to transmit the [[Seven rays#Theosophy|seven rays]] from the heart of the sun through the ''seven spirits before the [solar] throne'' to all the life waves of the solar system.  According to Benjamin Creme, the ''Avatar of Synthesis'' is functioning at the ''17th level of initiation''.&lt;ref&gt;Creme, Benjamin ''Maitreya's Mission – Volume III'' Amsterdam:1997 Share Foundation Page 72&lt;/ref&gt; In the Ascended Master Teachings, this being is called '''Ray-O-Light'''.&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press Ray-O-Light Page 301&lt;/ref&gt; The only master above all these levels is the Christ.

The '''[[Spiritual Hierarchy#Cosmic beings functioning within the Sun|Solar Logos]]''' itself must be at least several levels beyond the 17th level.  The ''Solar Logos'', the [[Sun God]] in Theosophy, is personified as the cosmic beings '''[[Helios]]''' and his ''twin flame'' (celestial wife) '''[[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]]''', the "God and  Goddess of this [[solar system]]", in the Ascended Master Teachings.&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press Helios and Vesta Page 126&lt;/ref&gt;  

Perhaps several dozen or a couple of hundred of levels above the ''Solar Logos'' would be the '''[[Spiritual Hierarchy#Cosmic beings governing the Milky Way Galaxy from the galactic core|Galactic Logos]]'''.  In the Ascended Master Teachings, the ''Galactic Logos'' is personified as the cosmic being '''[[Spiritual Hierarchy#Cosmic beings governing the Milky Way Galaxy from the galactic core|Averran]]'''.

C.W. Leadbeater stated, "The ladder of being [i.e., of initiation] extends upward into clouds of light, into which few of us can yet penetrate, and when we ask those who stand higher than we and know infinitely more than we do, all they can say is that it extends beyond their sight also.  They know very many more steps of it than we do, but it goes still further, onwards and upward to unimaginable heights of glory, and no one knows its end."&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path''. Adyar, India: Theosophical Publishing House 1925 Page 207&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of levels of initiation ultimately would depend on the physical size of the [[Cosmos]], because enough souls would have to climb the ladder to ensoul all the [[star]]s with ''stellar logoi'' and all the [[galaxy|galaxies]] with ''galactic logoi'', plus provide staffing for their attendant cosmic bureaucracies of angels, archangels, etc., as souls beyond them on the scale of initiation move up the ladder.  If [[Alan Guth]]'s [[inflation theory]], which states that the actual size of the Cosmos is at least fifteen [[orders of magnitude]] larger than the [[observable universe]] (itself 93,000,000,000 [[light year]]s in diameter), is correct, then there could be several hundred or even thousands of levels of initiation necessary to staff the [[Large-scale structure of the cosmos|large scale structures of the cosmos]] before reaching the level of the '''[[Spiritual Hierarchy#Cosmic beings governing the Cosmos from the Great Central Sun|Cosmic Logos]]'''. In the Ascended Master Teachings, the ''Cosmic Logos'' is personified as the cosmic beings '''[[Spiritual Hierarchy#Cosmic beings governing the Cosmos from the Great Central Sun|Alpha and Omega]]'''. 

If the concept of the [[Multiverse]] is true, then other hierarchies exist in [[Multiverse (religion)|other Universes]].  It is believed in Theosopy that the concept of the Multiverse is true because Theosophists have stated that the '''[[Spiritual Hierarchy#God|Universal Logos]]''' has created many other cosmoses besides our own.

==Initiation in popular culture==
'''[[Music]]'''
* In 1975, [[Todd Rundgren]] released an album titled ''[[Initiation (Todd Rundgren album)|Initiation]]'' which has a song called "Initiation" on side one.  The title of the album is apparently based on the Theosophical concept of Initiation as taught by Alice Bailey and [[C. W. Leadbeater]].  The entire second side of the album is taken up by a song called "A Treatise on Cosmic Fire"; the three parts of the song are listed as: "I. The Internal Fire, or Fire by Friction; II. The Fire of Spirit, or Electric Fire; The Fire of Mind, or Solar Fire." The second parts of these three phrases are taken directly from Alice A. Bailey's book ''A Treatise on Cosmic Fire''.

'''''Is Google Making Us Stupid? What the Internet Is Doing to Our Brains''''' (alternatively '''''Is Google Making Us Stoopid?''''') is a magazine article by technology writer [[Nicholas G. Carr]], and is highly critical of the Internet's effect on [[cognition]]. It was published in the July/August 2008 edition of ''[[The Atlantic Monthly|The Atlantic]]'' magazine as a six-page cover story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pages and "pages" |author=Nicholas Carr |date=2008-06-12 |publisher=Rough Type |url=http://www.roughtype.com/archives/2008/06/pages_and_pages.php |accessdate=2008-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carr's main argument is that the Internet might have detrimental effects on cognition that diminish the capacity for concentration and contemplation. Despite the title, the article is not specifically targeted at [[Google]], but more at the cognitive impact of the [[Internet]] and [[World Wide Web]].&lt;ref name=Thompson/&gt;&lt;ref name=Johnson1/&gt; Carr expanded his argument in ''[[The Shallows: What the Internet Is Doing to Our Brains]]'', a book published by [[W. W. Norton]] in June 2010.

The essay was extensively discussed in the media and the [[blogosphere]], with reactions to Carr's argument being polarised. At the [[Encyclopædia Britannica|Britannica Blog]], a part of the discussion focused on the apparent bias in Carr's argument toward literary reading. In Carr's view, reading on the Internet is generally a shallower form in comparison with reading from printed books in which he believes a more intense and sustained form of reading is exercised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The internet shrinks your brain? What rubbish |author=David Aaronovitch |date=2008-08-13 |work=[[The Times]] |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/david_aaronovitch/article4517674.ece |accessdate=2008-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere in the media, the Internet's impact on memory retention was discussed; and, at the online scientific magazine ''[[Edge - the third culture|Edge]]'', several argued that it was ultimately the responsibility of individuals to monitor their Internet usage so that it does not impact their cognition.

While long-term psychological and neurological studies have yet to yield definitive results justifying Carr's argument, a few studies have provided glimpses into the changing cognitive habits of Internet users.&lt;ref name=Claburn/&gt; A [[UCLA]] study led some to wonder whether a breadth of brain activity—which was shown to occur while users performed Internet searches in the study's [[functional MRI]] scans—actually facilitated reading and cognition or possibly overburdened the mind; and what quality of thought could be determined by the additional presence of brain activity in regions known to control decision-making and complex reasoning skills.

==Background==
Prior to the publication of Carr's ''Atlantic'' essay, critics had long been concerned about the potential for electronic media to supplant literary reading.&lt;ref name=lit-debate&gt;{{cite news |title=Literacy Debate: Online, R U Really Reading? |author=Motoko Rich |date=2008-07-27 |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/27/books/27reading.html |accessdate=2008-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, American academic [[Sven Birkerts]] published a book titled ''The Gutenberg Elegies: The Fate of Reading in an Electronic Age'', consisting of a collection of essays that declaimed against the declining influence of [[literary culture]]—the tastes in literature that are favored by a social group—with a central premise among the essays asserting that alternative delivery formats for the book are inferior to the paper incarnation.&lt;ref name=fate-of-book/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sharratt&gt;{{cite news |title=Are There Books in Our Future |author=Bernard Sharratt |date=1994-12-18 |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE6DF1239F93BA25751C1A962958260 |accessdate=2008-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Naughton/&gt; Birkerts was spurred to write the book after his experience with a class he taught in the fall of 1992, where the students had little appreciation for the literature he had assigned them, stemming from, in his opinion, their inaptitude for the variety of skills involved in [[deep reading]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Birkerts|1994|pp=17–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=deepreading/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Can intelligent literature survive in the digital age? |author=John Walsh and Kate Burt |date=2008-09-14 |work=[[The Independent]] |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/features/books-special-can-intelligent-literature-survive-in-the-digital-age-926545.html |accessdate=2008-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In "Perseus Unbound", an essay from the book, Birkerts presented several reservations toward the application of interactive technologies to educational instruction, cautioning that the "long-term cognitive effects of these new processes of data absorption" were unknown and that they could yield "an expansion of the short-term memory banks and a correlative atrophying of long-term memory".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Birkerts|1994|pp=138–139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, developmental psychologist [[Maryanne Wolf]] took up the cause of defending reading and print culture in her book ''[[Proust and the Squid|Proust and the Squid: The Story and Science of the Reading Brain]]'', approaching the subject matter from a scientific angle in contrast to Birkerts' cultural-historical angle.&lt;ref name=Thompson/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sharratt/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=We were never meant to read |author=William Leith |date=2008-03-28 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2008/03/23/bowol123.xml |accessdate=2008-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wolf|2007|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few reviewers were critical of Wolf for only touching upon the Internet's potential impact on reading in her book;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Stumbling over books |author=Guy Dammann |date=2008-03-28 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2008/03/29/bowol129.xml |accessdate=2008-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Reading is hard work for the brain, as this book proves. |author=[[Michael Dirda]] |date=2007-09-02 |work=[[The Washington Post]] |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/30/AR2007083001664.html |accessdate=2008-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=We're on a scroll |author=Guy Dammann |date=2008-04-05 |work=[[The Guardian]] |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/apr/05/wereonascroll |accessdate=2008-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, in essays published concurrent with the book's release she elaborated upon her worries. In an essay in ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', Wolf expressed her grave concern that the development of knowledge in children who are heavy users of the Internet could produce mere "decoders of information who have neither the time nor the motivation to think beneath or beyond their googled universes", and cautioned that the web's "immediacy and volume of information should not be confused with true knowledge".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Learning to think in a digital world |author=[[Maryanne Wolf]] |date=2007-09-05 |url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2007/09/05/learning_to_think_in_a_digital_world/ |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |accessdate=2008-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an essay published by [[Powell's Books]], Wolf contended that some of the reading brain's strengths could be lost in future generations "if children are not taught first to read, and to think deeply about their reading, and only then to e-read".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Reading Worrier |author=[[Maryanne Wolf]] |year=2007 |publisher=[[Powell's Books]] |url=http://www.powells.com/essays/wolf.html |accessdate=2007-10-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Preferring to maintain an academic perspective, Wolf firmly asserted that her speculations have not yet been scientifically verified but deserved serious study.&lt;ref name=podcast1&gt;{{cite podcast |title=Does spending time online change the way we think?

==Synopsis==
At the start of the essay, Carr says that his recent difficulties with concentrating while reading books and long articles may be due to spending a lot of time on the Internet. He posits that regular Internet usage may have the effect of diminishing the capacity for concentration and contemplation. He prefaces his argument with a couple of anecdotes from bloggers on their changing reading habits, as well as the findings of a 2008 [[University College London]] study titled "Information Behaviour of the Researcher of the Future" which suggests the emergence of new types of reading. He cites Maryanne Wolf, an expert on reading, for her expertise on the role of media and technology in learning written languages. Carr raises the point that unlike 'speech, which is an [[Innatism|innate ability]]'{{fact|date=January 2018}} hardwired into the human brain, the ability to read has to be taught in order for the brain to rearrange its original parts for the task of interpreting symbols into words. He acknowledges that his argument does not yet have the backing of long-term neurological and psychological studies. Carr further draws on Wolf's work, particularly her 2007 book ''Proust and the Squid'', to relate his argument to the way in which neural circuits in the reading brain are specifically shaped by the demands particular to each written language, such as Chinese, Japanese, and alphabet-based scripts.&lt;ref name=CarrsNotes&gt;{{cite news |title='Is Google Making Us Stupid?': sources and notes |author=[[Nicholas G. Carr|Nicholas Carr]] |date=2008-08-07 |publisher=Rough Type |url=http://www.roughtype.com/archives/2008/08/is_google_makin.php |accessdate=2008-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wolf|2007|pp=60–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Carr purports that the neural circuitry shaped by regular Internet usage can also be expected to be different from that shaped by the reading of books and other page-based written material.

Carr begins his argument by reasoning how the capacity to concentrate may be weakened by regular Internet usage. He mentions a historical example involving [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s usage of a typewriter, a fairly new technology in the 1880s. According to German scholar [[Friedrich A. Kittler]], Nietzsche's prose style changed when he started using a typewriter, which he had adopted because of his developing difficulty with writing by hand due to failing eyesight. Carr proceeds to explain that scientific research in the field of [[neuroplasticity]] as of 2008 has demonstrated that the brain's neural circuitry can in fact be rewired. In the humanities, sociologist [[Daniel Bell]] coined the term "intellectual technologies" to describe those technologies that extend the brain's cognitive faculties, and Carr states that he believes that the human brain adopts the qualities of these intellectual technologies. In discussing the [[mechanical clock]], Carr deliberates upon the benefits and losses that are characteristic of new technologies. Then, Carr ventures that the cognitive impact of the Internet may be far more encompassing than any other previous intellectual technology because the Internet is gradually performing the services of most intellectual technologies, thus replacing them. Carr finally contends that the prevalent style of presentation for much of the Internet's content may significantly hinder the capacity to concentrate due to the many distractions that often surround the Internet's content, in the form of ads and obtrusive notifications. Additionally, he claims that these detrimental effects on concentration are compounded by traditional media because they are gradually adopting a style of presentation for their content that mimics the Internet, in order to remain competitive as consumer expectations change.

Carr also theorizes that the capacity to contemplate may diminish as computer algorithms unburden an Internet user's brain of much of the painstaking [[knowledge work]] — the manipulation of abstract information and knowledge — that was previously done manually. In comparing the Internet with [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]]'s management system for industrial efficiency, Carr makes the point that back then some workers complained that they felt they were becoming mere [[automaton]]s due to the systemic application of [[Taylorism]] — a theory of management that analyzes and synthesizes workflow processes, improving labor productivity. Carr selects Google as a prime example of a company in which computer engineers and software designers have applied Taylorism to the knowledge industry, delivering increasingly robust information that may have the effect of minimizing opportunities to ponder ambiguities. Additionally, he argues that the Internet's dominant business model is one that thrives as companies either collect information on users or deliver them advertisements, therefore companies capitalize on users who move from link to link rather than those who engage in sustained thought.

Finally, Carr places his [[skepticism]] in a historical context, reflecting upon how previous detractors of technological advances have fared. While often correct, Carr points out that skepticisms such as [[Socrates]]' concerns about written language and the 15th-century Venetian editor [[Hieronimo Squarciafico]]'s concerns about printed works failed to anticipate the benefits that these technologies might hold for human knowledge. As an afterthought, a 2005 essay by playwright [[Richard Foreman]] is excerpted for its lament of the waning of the "highly educated and articulate personality".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Pancake People, Or, 'The Gods Are Pounding My Head' |date=2005-08-03 |author=[[Richard Foreman]] |work=[[Edge - the third culture|Edge]] |url=http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/foreman05/foreman05_index.html |accessdate=2008-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carr's essay was widely discussed in the media both critically and in passing. While English technology writer [[Bill Thompson (technology writer)|Bill Thompson]] observed that Carr's argument had "succeeded in provoking a wide-ranging debate",&lt;ref name=Thompson&gt;{{cite news |title=Changing the way we think |author=[[Bill Thompson (technology writer)|Bill Thompson]] |date=2008-06-17 |work=[[BBC News]] |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/nolpda/ifs_news/hi/newsid_7459000/7459182.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Damon Darlin of ''The New York Times'' quipped that even though "[everyone] has been talking about [the] article in ''The Atlantic'' magazine", only "[s]ome subset of that group has actually read the 4,175-word article, by Nicholas Carr."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Technology Doesn’t Dumb Us Down.

Many critics discussed the merits of Carr's essay at great length in [[Internet forum|forums]] set up formally for this purpose at online hubs such as the Britannica Blog and publisher [[John Brockman (literary agent)|John Brockman's]] online scientific magazine ''[[Edge - the third culture|Edge]]'', where the roster of names quickly took on the semblance of a [[Who's Who]] of the day's Internet critics.&lt;ref name=Salon/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title='Is Google Making Us Stupid?'

Book critic Scott Esposito pointed out that [[Chinese character]]s are incorrectly described as [[ideogram]]s in Carr's essay, an error that he believed undermined the essay's argument.&lt;ref name=Esposito/&gt; The myth that Chinese script is ideographic had been effectively debunked in scholar [[John DeFrancis]]' 1984 book ''[[The Chinese Language: Fact and Fantasy]]'';&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Unger|2004|pp=2–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; DeFrancis classifies Chinese as a [[logosyllabic writing]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wolf|2007|pp=35–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carr acknowledged that there was a debate over the terminology of 'ideogram', but in a response to Esposito he explained that he had "decided to use the common term" and quoted ''[[Oxford American Dictionary|The Oxford American Dictionary]]'' to demonstrate that they likewise define Chinese characters as instances of ideograms.&lt;ref&gt;In a [http://www.conversationalreading.com/2008/06/is-google-makin.html#comment-119640252 comment from Nicholas Carr] on Book critic Scott Esposito's column concerning his criticism of Carr's usage of the term 'ideogram', Carr said: "As to '[[ideogram]],' I agree that there's debate on terminology, but in my article I decided to use the common term. The [[Oxford American Dictionary]] defines ideogram in this way: 'a written character symbolizing the idea of a thing without indicating the sounds used to say it, e.g., numerals and Chinese characters.'"&lt;/ref&gt;

Writer and activist [[Seth Finkelstein]] noted that predictably several critics would label Carr's argument as a [[Luddite]] one,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Nick Carr: 'Is Google Making Us Stupid?', and Man vs. Machine |author=Seth Finkelstein |date=2008-06-09 |publisher=Infothought |url=http://sethf.com/infothought/blog/archives/001349.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he was not to be disappointed when one critic later maintained that Carr's "contrarian stance [was] slowly forcing him into a caricature of Luddism".&lt;ref name=Shirky1/&gt; Then, journalist [[David Wolman]], in a ''Wired'' magazine piece, described as "moronic" the assumption that the web "hurts us more than it helps", a statement that was preceded by an overview of the many technologies that had been historically denounced; Wolman concluded that the solution was "better schools as well as a renewed commitment to reason and scientific rigor so that people can distinguish knowledge from garbage".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Critics Need a Reboot.

Several prominent scientists working in the field of [[neuroscience]] supported Carr's argument as scientifically plausible. James Olds, a professor of computational neuroscience, who directs the [[Krasnow Institute for Advanced Study]] at [[George Mason University]], was quoted in Carr's essay for his expertise, and upon the essay's publication Olds wrote a letter to the editor of ''The Atlantic'' in which he reiterated that the brain was "very plastic" — referring to the changes that occur in the organization of the brain as a result of experience. It was Olds' opinion that given the brain's plasticity it was "not such a long stretch to Carr's meme".&lt;ref name=Olds&gt;{{cite news |title=Not So Google Stoopid, Ctd. |author=Andrew Sullivan |date=2008-06-20 |publisher=The Daily Dish |url=http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2008/06/not-so-google-1.html |accessdate=2009-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the pioneers in neuroplasticity research, [[Michael Merzenich]], later added his own comment to the discussion, stating that he had given a talk at Google in 2008 in which he had asked the audience the same question that Carr asked in his essay. Merzenich believed that there was "absolutely no question that our brains are engaged less directly and more shallowly in the synthesis of information, when we use research strategies that are all about 'efficiency', 'secondary (and out-of-context) referencing', and 'once over, lightly'".&lt;ref name=Merzenich&gt;{{cite news |title=Going googly. |author=[[Michael Merzenich]] |date=2008-08-11 |agency=Posit Science Web site |publisher="On the Brain" blog |url=http://merzenich.positscience.com/?p=177 |accessdate=2008-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another neuroscientist, [[Gary Small]], director of UCLA's Memory &amp; Aging Research Center, wrote a letter to the editor of ''The Atlantic'' in which he stated that he believed that "brains are developing circuitry for online social networking and are adapting to a new multitasking technology culture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Letters to the Editor: Our Brains on Google |author=Gary Small  |date=October 2008 |work=The Atlantic |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200810/letters |accessdate=2008-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Testimonials and refutations===
In the [[Mass media|media]], there were many testimonials and refutations given by journalists for the first part of Carr's argument regarding the capacity for concentration; treatments of the second part of Carr's argument regarding the capacity for contemplation, were, however, far rarer.&lt;ref name=Compilation/&gt; Although columnist [[Andrew Sullivan]] noted that he had little leisure time at his disposal for contemplation compared with when he grew up,&lt;ref name=Sullivan&gt;{{cite news |title=Google is giving us pond-skater minds |author=[[Andrew Sullivan]] |date=2008-06-15 |work=[[The Times]] |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/andrew_sullivan/article4136782.ece |accessdate=2008-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; the anecdotes provided by journalists that indicated a deficiency in the capacity to contemplate were described only in the context of third parties, such as columnist [[Margaret Wente]]'s anecdote about how one consultant had found a growing tendency in her clients to provide ill-considered descriptions for their technical problems.&lt;ref name=Compilation/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wente&gt;{{cite news |title=How Google ate my brain |date=2008-06-17 |author=[[Margaret Wente]] |work=[[The Globe and Mail]] |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20080617.COWENT17/TPStory/National/columnists |accessdate=2008-07-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Columnist [[Leonard Pitts]] of ''[[The Miami Herald]]'' described his difficulty sitting down to read a book, in which he felt like he "was getting away with something, like when you slip out of the office to catch a matinee".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Reader finds satisfaction in a good read |author=[[Leonard Pitts|Leonard Pitts, Jr.]] |date=2008-06-15 |work=[[Miami Herald]] |url=http://sapper.blogspot.com/2008/06/google-me-stupid-me.html |accessdate=2009-02-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Technology evangelist [[Jon Udell]] admitted that, in his "retreats" from the Internet, he sometimes struggled to settle into "books, particularly fiction, and particularly in printed form".&lt;ref name=udell/&gt; He found portable long-form audio to be "transformative", however, because he can easily achieve "sustained attention", which makes him optimistic about the potential to "reactivate ancient traditions, like oral storytelling, and rediscover their powerful neural effects".&lt;ref name=Naughton&gt;{{cite news |title=I Google, therefore I am losing the ability to think |author=[[John Naughton]] |date=2008-06-22 |work=[[The Observer]] |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/jun/22/googlethemedia.internet |accessdate=2008-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=udell&gt;{{cite news |title=A quiet retreat from the busy information commons |author=[[Jon Udell]] |date=2008-06-10 |publisher=Strategies for Internet citizens |url=http://blog.jonudell.net/2008/06/10/a-quiet-retreat-from-the-busy-information-commons/ |accessdate=2008-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also writing in ''The Atlantic'', a year after Carr, the futurist [[Jamais Cascio]] argued that human cognition has always evolved to meet environmental challenges, and that those posed by the internet are no different. He described the 'skimming' referred to by Carr as a form of attention deficit caused by the immaturity of filter algorithms: "The trouble isn’t that we have too much information at our fingertips, but that our tools for managing it are still in their infancy... many of the technologies that Carr worries about were developed precisely to help us get some control over a flood of data and ideas. Google isn’t the problem; it’s the beginning of a solution."&lt;ref name="ref_GetSmarter"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2009/07/get-smarter/307548/ |title=Get Smarter |last=Cascio |first=Jamais |date=July 2009  |website= |publisher=The Atlantic Monthly |access-date=4 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cascio and Carr's articles have been discussed together in several places. [[Pew Research]] used them to form a tension-pair question survey that was distributed to noted academics. Most responded in detail; concurring with the proposition "Carr was wrong: Google does not make us stupid".&lt;ref name="ref_Pew2010"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2010/02/19/part-1-a-review-of-responses-to-a-tension-pair-about-whether-google-will-make-people-stupid/ |title=Future of the Internet IV.

However, he thought both arguments relied too much on determinism: Carr in thinking that an over-reliance on internet tools will inevitably cause the brain to atrophy, and Cascio in thinking that getting smarter is the necessary outcome of the evolutionary pressures he describes.&lt;ref name="Vaidhyanathan2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Siva Vaidhyanathan|title=The Googlization of Everything: (And Why We Should Worry)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LyH6f_qjLwEC&amp;pg=PA181|date=13 March 2012|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-95245-4|pages=181–  |access-date=27 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''From Gutenberg to Zuckerberg'' Naughton noted that, while many agreed Carr had hit on an important subject, his conclusions were not widely supported.&lt;ref name="ref_Naughton2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Naughton|title=From Gutenberg to Zuckerberg: What You Really Need to Know About the Internet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l0tCCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT26|date=22 December 2011|publisher=Quercus Publishing|isbn=978-0-85738-547-5|pages=26–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Firmly contesting Carr's argument, journalist [[John Battelle]] praised the virtues of the web: "[W]hen I am deep in search for knowledge on the web, jumping from link to link, reading deeply in one moment, skimming hundreds of links the next, when I am pulling back to formulate and reformulate queries and devouring new connections as quickly as Google and the Web can serve them up, when I am performing [[bricolage]] in real time over the course of hours, I am 'feeling' my brain light up, I and {{sic}} 'feeling' like I'm getting smarter".&lt;ref name=Thompson/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Google: Making Nick Carr Stupid, But It's Made This Guy Smarter |author=[[John Battelle]] |date=2008-06-10 |publisher=Searchblog |url=http://battellemedia.com/archives/004494.php |accessdate=2008-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Web journalist [[Scott Rosenberg (journalist)|Scott Rosenberg]] reported that his reading habits are the same as they were when he "was a teenager plowing [his] way through a shelf of Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Nick Carr’s new knock on the Web: does it change how we read? |author=[[Scott Rosenberg (journalist)|Scott Rosenberg]] |date=2008-06-11 |publisher=Wordyard |url=http://www.wordyard.com/2008/06/11/nick-carrs-new-knock-on-the-web-does-it-change-how-we-read/ |accessdate=2008-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In book critic Scott Esposito's view, "responsible adults" have always had to deal with distractions, and, in his own case, he claimed to remain "fully able to turn down the noise" and read deeply.&lt;ref name=Esposito&gt;{{cite news |title=Friday Column: Is Google Making Us Read Worse? |author=Scott Esposito |date=2008-06-20 |publisher=Conversational Reading |url=http://www.conversationalreading.com/2008/06/is-google-makin.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Compilation/&gt;

==Analysis==
In critiquing the rise of Internet-based computing, the philosophical question of whether or not a society can control technological progress was raised. At the online scientific magazine ''[[Edge - the third culture|Edge]]'', Wikipedia co-founder [[Larry Sanger]] argued that individual will was all that was necessary to maintain the cognitive capacity to read a book all the way through, and computer scientist and writer [[Jaron Lanier]] rebuked the idea that technological progress is an "autonomous process that will proceed in its chosen direction independently of us".&lt;ref name=Edge/&gt; Lanier echoed a view stated by American historian [[Lewis Mumford]] in his 1970 book ''[[The Myth of the Machine|The Pentagon of Power]]'', in which Mumford suggested that the technological advances that shape a society could be controlled if the full might of a society's free will were employed.&lt;ref name=CarrsNotes/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Carr|2008|pp=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lanier believed that technology was significantly hindered by the idea that "there is only one axis of choice" which is either pro- or anti- when it comes to technology adoption.&lt;ref name=Edge/&gt; Yet Carr had stated in ''The Big Switch'' that he believed an individual's personal choice toward a technology had little effect on technological progress.&lt;ref name=CarrsNotes/&gt;&lt;ref name=BigSwitch-2/&gt; According to Carr, the view expressed by Mumford about technological progress was incorrect because it regarded technology solely as advances in science and engineering rather than as an influence on the costs of production and consumption. Economics were a more significant consideration in Carr's opinion because in a competitive marketplace the most efficient methods of providing an important resource will prevail. As technological advances shape society, an individual might be able to resist the effects but his lifestyle will "always be lonely and in the end futile"; despite a few holdouts, technology will nevertheless shape economics which, in turn, will shape society.&lt;ref name=CarrsNotes/&gt;&lt;ref name=BigSwitch-2&gt;{{Harvnb|Carr|2008|pp=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===A focus on literary reading===
The selection of one particular quote in Carr's essay from pathologist Bruce Friedman, a member of the faculty of the [[University of Michigan Medical School]], who commented on a developing difficulty reading books and long essays and specifically the novel ''[[War and Peace]]'', was criticized for having a bias toward narrative literature. The quote failed to represent other types of literature, such as technical and scientific literature, which had, in contrast, become much more accessible and widely read with the advent of the Internet.&lt;ref name=coverstory/&gt;&lt;ref name=Shirky2/&gt; At the Britannica Blog, writer [[Clay Shirky]] pugnaciously observed that ''War and Peace'' was "too long, and not so interesting", further stating that "it would be hard to argue that the last ten years have seen a decrease in either the availability or comprehension of material on scientific or technical subjects".&lt;ref name=Shirky1&gt;{{cite news |title=Why Abundance is Good: A Reply to Nick Carr |author=[[Clay Shirky]] |date=2008-07-17 |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica|Britannica Blog]] |url=http://blogs.britannica.com/2008/07/why-abundance-is-good-a-reply-to-nick-carr/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shirky's comments on ''War and Peace'' were derided by several of his peers as verging on [[philistinism]].&lt;ref name=Carr1&gt;{{cite news |title=Why Skepticism is Good: My Reply to Clay Shirky |author=Nicholas Carr |date=2008-07-17 |publisher=Britannica Blog |url=http://blogs.britannica.com/2008/07/why-skepticism-is-good-my-reply-to-clay-shirky/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sanger1&gt;{{cite news |title=A Defense of Tolstoy &amp; the Individual Thinker: A Reply to Clay Shirky |author=[[Larry Sanger]] |date=2008-07-18 |publisher=Britannica Blog |url=http://blogs.britannica.com/2008/07/a-defense-of-tolstoy-the-individual-thinker-a-reply-to-clay-shirky/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sanger2&gt;{{cite news |title=The Internet and the Future of Civilization |author=Larry Sanger |date=2008-07-30 |publisher=Britannica Blog |url=http://blogs.britannica.com/2008/07/the-internet-and-the-future-of-civilization/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Shirky's defense, inventor [[W. Daniel Hillis]] asserted that, although books "were created to serve a purpose", that "same purpose can often be served by better means". While Hillis considered the book to be "a fine and admirable device", he imagined that [[clay tablet]]s and [[scroll|scrolls of papyrus]], in their time, "had charms of their own".&lt;ref name=Edge/&gt; ''Wired'' magazine editor [[Kevin Kelly (editor)|Kevin Kelly]] believed that the idea that "the book is the apex of human culture" should be resisted.&lt;ref name=fate-of-book&gt;{{cite news |title=The Fate of the Book (and a Question for Sven Birkerts) |author=[[Kevin Kelly (editor)|Kevin Kelly]] |date=2008-07-25 |publisher=Britannica Blog (originally posted at Kelly's blog The Technium)|url=http://blogs.britannica.com/2008/07/fate-of-the-book/}}&lt;/ref&gt; And Birkerts differentiated online reading from literary reading, stating that in the latter the reader is directed within themselves and enters "an environment that is nothing at all like the open-ended information zone that is cyberspace" in which he feels psychologically fragmented.&lt;ref name=Salon&gt;{{cite news |title=Are you losing your memory thanks to the Internet? |author=Evan Ratliff |date=2008-08-14 |publisher=Salon.com |url=http://www.salon.com/2008/08/14/memory_3/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Birkerts2&gt;{{cite news |title=Reading in the Open-ended Information Zone Called Cyberspace: My Reply to Kevin Kelly |author=[[Sven Birkerts]] |date=2008-07-25 |publisher=Britannica Blog |url=http://blogs.britannica.com/2008/07/reading-in-the-open-ended-information-zone-called-cyberspacemy-reply-to-kevin-kelly/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several critics theorized about the effects of the shift from [[scarcity]] to [[Abundance (economics)|abundance]] of written material in the media as a result of the technologies introduced by the Internet. This shift was examined for its potential to lead individuals to a superficial comprehension of many subjects rather than a deep comprehension of just a few subjects. According to Shirky, an individual's ability to concentrate had been facilitated by the "relatively empty environment" which had ceased to exist when the wide availability of the web proliferated new media. Although Shirky acknowledged that the unprecedented quantity of written material available on the web might occasion a sacrifice of the cultural importance of many works, he believed that the solution was "to help make the sacrifice worth it".&lt;ref name=Shirky1/&gt; In direct contrast, [[Sven Birkerts]] argued that "some deep comprehension of our inheritance [was] essential", and called for "some consensus vision among those shapers of what our society and culture might be shaped toward", warning against allowing the commercial marketplace to dictate the future standing of traditionally important cultural works.&lt;ref name=Birkerts1&gt;{{cite news |title=A Know-Nothing’s Defense of Serious Reading &amp; Culture: A Reply to Clay Shirky |author=[[Sven Birkerts]] |date=2008-07-18 |publisher=Britannica Blog |url=http://blogs.britannica.com/2008/07/a-know-nothings-defense-of-serious-culture-and-reading-a-reply-to-clay-shirky/}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Carr found solace in Shirky's conceit that "new forms of expression" might emerge to suit the Internet, he considered this conceit to be one of faith rather than reason.&lt;ref name=Carr1/&gt; In a later response, Shirky continued to expound upon his theme that "technologies that make writing abundant always require new social structures to accompany them", explaining that [[Printing press#Gutenberg.27s press|Gutenberg's printing press]] led to an abundance of cheap books which were met by "a host of inventions large and small", such as the separation of fiction from non-fiction, the recognition of talents, the listing of concepts by indexes, and the practice of noting editions.&lt;ref name=Shirky2&gt;{{cite news |title=Why Abundance Should Breed Optimism: A Second Reply to Nick Carr |author=[[Clay Shirky]] |date=2008-07-21 |publisher=Britannica Blog |url=http://blogs.britannica.com/2008/07/why-abundance-should-breed-optimism-a-second-reply-to-nick-carr/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impact of the web on memory retention===
As a result of the vast stores of information made accessible on the web, one hundred critics pointed to a decrease in the desire to recall certain types of information, indicating, they believed, a change in the process of recalling information, as well as the types of information that are recalled. According to Ben Worthen, a ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' business technology blogger, the growing importance placed on the ability to access information instead of the capacity to recall information straight from memory would, in the long term, change the type of job skills that companies who are hiring new employees would find valuable. Due to an increased reliance on the Internet, Worthen speculated that before long "the guy who remembers every fact about a topic may not be as valuable as the guy who knows how to find all of these facts and many others".&lt;ref name=Compilation&gt;Compiled (with help from Google) by Evan R.

Drawing parallels with [[transactive memory]] — a process whereby people remember things in relationships and groups — Ratliff mused that perhaps the web was "like a spouse who is around all the time, with a particular knack for factual memory of all varieties".&lt;ref name=Salon/&gt; Far from conclusive, these ruminations left the web's impact on memory retention an open question.&lt;ref name=Salon/&gt;

===Effect of technology on the brain's neural circuitry===

In the essay, Carr introduces the discussion of the scientific support for the idea that the brain's neural circuitry can be rewired with an example in which philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] is said to have been influenced by technology. According to German scholar [[Friedrich A. Kittler]] in his book ''Gramophone, Film, Typewriter'', Nietzsche's writing style became more aphoristic after he started using a typewriter. Nietzsche began using a [[Hansen Writing Ball|Malling-Hansen Writing Ball]] because of his failing eyesight which had disabled his ability to write by hand.&lt;ref name=CarrsNotes/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kittler|1999|pp=203, 206}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea that Nietzsche's writing style had changed for better or worse when he adopted the typewriter was disputed by several critics. Kevin Kelly and Scott Esposito each offered alternate explanations for the apparent changes.&lt;ref name=Edge/&gt;&lt;ref name=Esposito/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Will We Let Google Make Us Smarter? |author=[[Kevin Kelly (editor)|Kevin Kelly]] |date=2008-06-11 |publisher=The Technium |url=http://www.kk.org/thetechnium/archives/2008/06/will_we_let_goo.php |accessdate=2008-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Esposito believed that "the brain is so huge and amazing and enormously complex that it's far, far off base to think that a few years of Internet media or the acquisition of a typewriter can fundamentally rewire it."&lt;ref name=Esposito/&gt; In a response to Esposito's point, neuroscientist James Olds stated that recent brain research demonstrated that it was "pretty clear that the adult brain can re-wire on the fly". In ''The New York Times'' it was reported that several scientists believed that it was certainly plausible that the brain's neural circuitry may be shaped differently by regular Internet usage compared with the reading of printed works.&lt;ref name=lit-debate/&gt;

Although there was a consensus in the scientific community about how it was possible for the brain's neural circuitry to change through experience, the potential effect of web technologies on the brain's neural circuitry was unknown.&lt;ref name=Olds/&gt;&lt;ref name=Merzenich/&gt; On the topic of the Internet's effect on reading skills, Guinevere F. Eden, director of the Center for the Study of Learning at [[Georgetown University]], remarked that the question was whether or not the Internet changed the brain in a way that was beneficial to an individual.&lt;ref name=lit-debate/&gt; Carr believed that the effect of the Internet on cognition was detrimental, weakening the ability to concentrate and contemplate. Olds cited the potential benefits of computer software that specifically targets [[learning disabilities]], stating that among some neuroscientists there was a belief that neuroplasticity-based software was beneficial in improving [[language disorder|receptive language disorders]].&lt;ref name=Olds/&gt; Olds mentioned neuroscientist [[Michael Merzenich]], who had formed several companies with his peers in which neuroplasticity-based computer programs had been developed to improve the cognitive functioning of kids, adults and the elderly.&lt;ref name=Olds/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Doidge|2007|pp=45–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, Merzenich and his peers had started a company called Scientific Learning in which neuroplastic research had been used to develop a computer training program called ''[[Fast ForWord]]'' that offered seven brain exercises that improved language impairments and learning disabilities in children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Doidge|2007|pp=70–72}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feedback on ''Fast ForWord'' showed that these brain exercises even had benefits for autistic children, an unexpected spillover effect that Merzenich has attempted to harness by developing a modification of ''Fast ForWord'' specifically designed for autism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Doidge|2007|pp=74–83}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a subsequent company that Merzenich started called Posit Science, ''Fast ForWord''-like brain exercises and other techniques were developed with the aim of sharpening the brains of elderly people by retaining the plasticity of their brains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Doidge|2007|pp=84–91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===HAL in ''2001: A Space Odyssey''===
In [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s 1968 science fiction film ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', astronaut [[David Bowman (Space Odyssey)|David Bowman]] slowly disassembles the mind of an [[artificial intelligence]] named [[HAL 9000|HAL]] by sequentially unplugging its memory banks. Carr likened the emotions of despair expressed by HAL as its mind is disassembled to his own, at the time, cognitive difficulties in engaging with long texts.&lt;ref name=Thompson/&gt; He felt as if someone was "tinkering with [his] brain, remapping the neural circuitry, reprogramming the memory".&lt;ref name=coverstory/&gt; HAL had also been used as a metaphor for the "ultimate search engine" in a [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] interview with Google co-founder [[Sergey Brin]] as noted in Carr's book ''The Big Switch'', and also Brin's [[TED (conference)|TED]] talk. Brin was comparing Google's ambitions of building an artificial intelligence to HAL, while dismissing the possibility that a bug like the one that led HAL to murder the occupants of the fictional spacecraft ''[[Discovery One]]'' could occur in a Google-based artificial intelligence.&lt;ref name=CarrsNotes/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Carr|2008|p=213}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spencer Michaels, "[https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/business/july-dec02/google_11-29.html The Search Engine that Could]", [[The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer]], November 29, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Carr observed in his essay that throughout history technological advances have often necessitated new metaphors, such as the [[mechanical clock]] engendering the simile "like clockwork" and the age of the computer engendering the simile "like computers". Carr concluded his essay with an explanation as to why he believed HAL was an appropriate metaphor for his essay's argument. He observed that HAL showed genuine emotion as his mind was disassembled while, throughout the film, the humans onboard the space station appeared to be automatons, thinking and acting as if they were following the steps of an algorithm. Carr believed that the film's prophetic message was that as individuals increasingly rely on computers for an understanding of their world their intelligence may become more machinelike than human.&lt;ref name=Thompson/&gt;&lt;ref name=coverstory/&gt;

After the publication of Carr's essay, a developing view unfolded in the media as sociological and neurological studies surfaced that were relevant to determining the cognitive impact of regular Internet usage. Challenges to Carr's argument were made frequently. As the two most outspoken detractors of electronic media, Carr and Birkerts were both appealed to by [[Kevin Kelly (editor)|Kevin Kelly]] to each formulate a more precise definition of the faults they perceived regarding electronic media so that their beliefs could be scientifically verified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Time to Prove the Carr Thesis: Where’s the Science? |author=Kevin Kelly |date=2008-07-25 |publisher=Britannica Blog |url=http://blogs.britannica.com/2008/07/time-to-prove-the-carr-thesis-wheres-the-science/|accessdate=2008-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Carr firmly believed that his skepticism about the Internet's benefits to cognition was warranted,&lt;ref name=Carr1/&gt; he cautioned in both his essay and his book ''The Big Switch'' that long-term psychological and neurological studies were required to definitively ascertain how cognition develops under the influence of the Internet.&lt;ref name=Johnson1/&gt;&lt;ref name=coverstory/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Carr|2008|p=227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars at [[University College London]] conducted a study titled "Information Behaviour of the Researcher of the Future", the results of which suggested that students' research habits tended towards [[Skimming (reading)|skimming]] and scanning rather than in-depth reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017205523/http://www.ucl.ac.uk/infostudies/research/ciber/downloads/ggexecutive.pdf#page=31|title=Information Behaviour of the Researcher of the Future : A Ciber Briefing Paper|date=January 11, 2008|publisher=[[University College London]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017205523/http://www.ucl.ac.uk/infostudies/research/ciber/downloads/ggexecutive.pdf|archivedate=October 17, 2012|format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study provoked serious reflection among educators about the implications for educational instruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Rethinking research in the Google era: Educators ponder how the internet has changed students' reading habits |author=Meris Stansbury |date=2008-10-15 |work=eSchool News |url=http://www.eschoolnews.com/news/top-news/index.cfm?i=55598 |accessdate=2008-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2008, new insights into the effect of Internet usage on cognition were gleaned from the results, reported in a [[press release]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=UCLA study finds that searching the Internet increases brain function |author=Rachel Champeau |date=2008-10-14 |publisher=UCLA Newsroom |url=http://newsroom.ucla.edu/portal/ucla/ucla-study-finds-that-searching-64348.aspx |accessdate=2008-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; of a study conducted by [[UCLA]]'s Memory and Aging Research Center that had tested two groups of people between the ages of 55 and 76 years old; only one group of which were experienced web users. While they had read books or performed assigned search tasks their brain activity had been monitored with [[functional MRI]] scans, which revealed that both reading and web search utilize the same language, reading, memory, and visual regions of the brain; however, it was discovered that those searching the web stimulated additional decision-making and complex reasoning regions of the brain, with a two-fold increase in these regions in experienced web users compared with inexperienced web users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Internet search results: Increased brain activity |author=Mary Brophy Marcus |date=2008-10-15 |work=[[USA Today]] |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2008-10-14-ibrain-internet-reading_N.htm |accessdate=2008-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Study: Google does a brain good |author=Madison Park |date=2008-10-14 |work=[[CNN]] |url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/HEALTH/10/14/google.brain/index.html |accessdate=2008-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Reading This Will Change Your Brain |author=Jeneen Interlandi |date=2008-10-14 |work=[[Newsweek]] |url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/163924 |accessdate=2008-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Internet use 'good for the brain' |date=2008-10-14 |work=[[BBC News]] |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7667610.stm |accessdate=2008-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gary Small, the director of the UCLA center and lead investigator of the UCLA study, concurrently released the book ''iBrain: Surviving the Technological Alteration of the Modern Mind'', co-authored with Gigi Vorgan, with the press release.

'''Jewish emancipation''' was the external (and [[Jewish Enlightenment|internal]]) process in various nations in [[Europe]] of eliminating [[Disabilities (Jewish)|Jewish disabilities]], e.g. [[Jewish quota]]s, to which [[European Jew|Jewish people]] were then subject, and the recognition of Jews as entitled to equality and [[citizenship]] rights on a communal, not merely individual, basis.&lt;ref name=mjl&gt;{{cite news|author=Eli Barnavi|title=Jewish Emancipation in Western Europe |url=http://www.myjewishlearning.com/history/Modern_History/1700-1914/Emancipation_and_Enlightenment/In_the_West.shtml|accessdate=25 September 2013|newspaper=My Jewish Learning}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=January 2016}} It included efforts within the community to integrate into their societies as citizens. It occurred gradually between the late 18th century and the early 20th century. Jewish emancipation followed the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and the concurrent [[Haskalah|Jewish enlightenment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Shmuel Ettinger|title=Jewish Emancipation and Enlightenment|url=http://www.myjewishlearning.com/history/Modern_History/1700-1914/Emancipation_and_Enlightenment.shtml|accessdate=25 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various nations repealed or superseded previous discriminatory laws applied specifically against [[Jews]] where they resided. Before the [[Political emancipation|emancipation]], most Jews were [[Jewish ghettos in Europe|isolated]] in residential areas from the rest of the society; emancipation was a major goal of European Jews of that time, who worked within their communities to achieve [[Social integration|integration]] in the majority societies and broader education. Many became active politically and culturally within wider European [[civil society]] as Jews gained full citizenship. They emigrated to countries offering better social and economic opportunities, such as the [[Russian Empire]] and [[France]]. Some European Jews turned to [[Socialism]], others to Jewish nationalism: [[Zionism]].

==Background==
[[File:Royal decree proclaiming the emancipation of the Jews, France, 1791 - Musée d'art et d'histoire du Judaïsme.jpg|thumb|The 1791 law proclaiming the Emancipation of the Jews - [[Musée d'Art et d'Histoire du Judaïsme]]]]

Jews were subject to a wide range of restrictions throughout most of European history. Since the [[Fourth Council of the Lateran]] in 1215, Christian Europeans required Jews and Muslims to wear special clothing, such as the [[Judenhut]] and the [[yellow badge]] for Jews, to distinguish them from Christians. The practice of their religions was often restricted, and they had to swear special oaths (see [[Oath More Judaico]]). Jews were not allowed to vote, where vote existed, and some countries formally prohibited their entry, such as Norway, Sweden and [[History of the Jews in Spain|Spain]] after the expulsion in the late 15th century.

In contrast, in 1264, the Polish [[Bolesław the Pious|Prince Boleslaw the Pious]] issued the "[[Statute of Kalisz]]" – The General Charter of Jewish Liberties in Poland, an unprecedented document in medieval history of Europe that allows Jews personal freedom, legal autonomy and separate tribunal for criminal matters as well as safeguards against forced baptism and blood libel. The Charter was ratified again by subsequent Polish Kings: [[Casimir the Great]] of Poland in 1334, [[Casimir IV of Poland]] in 1453, and [[Sigismund I the Old]] of Poland in 1539. After massive expulsions of Jews from Western Europe (England, France, Germany, and Spain), they found a refuge in the lands of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. During the [[Jagiellon]] Era Poland became the home to Europe's largest Jewish population, as royal edicts warranting Jewish safety and religious freedom from the 13th century contrasted with bouts of persecution in Western Europe, especially following the [[Black Death]] of 1348–1349, blamed by some in the West on Jews themselves. Large parts of Poland suffered relatively little from the outbreak, while the Jewish immigration brought valuable manpower and skills to the rising state. The greatest increase in Jewish numbers occurred in the 18th century, when Jews came to make up 7% of the Polish population.

The rabbinate was the highest goal of many young Jewish men, and the study of the [[Torah]] (the first five books of the Bible) and the [[Talmud]] was the means to obtain the coveted position.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}

{{Jews and Judaism sidebar |History}}

Jewish involvement in gentile society began during the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. [[Haskalah]], the Jewish movement supporting the adoption of enlightenment values, advocated an expansion of Jewish rights within European society. Haskalah followers advocated "coming out of the [[ghetto]]", not just physically but also mentally and spiritually.

On September 28, 1791, [[French revolution|revolutionary France]] became the second country of the world, after Poland 500 years earlier, to emancipate its Jewish population. The 40,000 Jews living in France at the time were the first to confront the opportunities and challenges offered by emancipation. The civic equality which the French Jews attained became a model for other European Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Paula E. Hyman, ''The Jews of Modern France'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1998), pp. 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt; Newfound opportunities began to be provided to the Jewish people, and they slowly pushed toward equality in other parts of the world. In 1796 and 1834, the Netherlands granted the Jews equal rights with gentiles. Napoleon freed the Jews in areas he conquered in Europe outside France (see [[Napoleon and the Jews]]). Greece granted equal rights to Jews in 1830. But, it was not until the revolutions of the mid-19th century that [[Jewish political movement]]s would begin to persuade governments in Great Britain, Central and Eastern Europe to grant equal rights to Jews.&lt;ref name=jvl&gt;{{cite web |title=EMANCIPATION |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0006_0_05916.html |work=[[Jewish Virtual Library]] |access-date=25 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emancipation movements==
The early stages of Jewish emancipation movements were part of the general progressive efforts to achieve freedom and rights for minorities. While this was a movement, it was also a pursuit for equal rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Modern Judaism|last=Nicholas|first=de Lange|last2=Freud-Kandel|first2=Miri|last3=C. Dubin|first3=Lois|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=30–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the emancipation movement would be a long process.  The question of equal rights for Jews was tied to demands for constitutions and civil rights in various nations. Jewish statesmen and intellectuals, such as [[Heinrich Heine]], [[Johann Jacoby]], [[Gabriel Riesser]], [[Berr Isaac Berr]], and [[Lionel Nathan Rothschild]], worked with the general movement toward liberty and political freedom, rather than for Jews specifically.&lt;ref name=ohio.edu/&gt;

In 1781, the Prussian civil servant [[Christian Wilhelm von Dohm|Christian Wilhelm Dohm]] published the famous script ''Über die bürgerliche Emanzipation der Juden''. Dohm disproves the antisemitic stereotypes and pleads for equal rights for Jews. Till this day, it is called the ''Bible of Jewish emancipation''.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Stollberg-Rilinger: Europa im Jahrhundert der Aufklärung. Stuttgart: Reclam, 2006 (2nd edition), 268.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the face of persistent [[anti-Jewish]] incidents and [[Blood libel against Jews|blood libels]], such as the [[Damascus affair]] of 1840, and the failure of many states to emancipate the Jews, Jewish organizations formed to push for the emancipation and protection of their people. The [[Board of Deputies of British Jews]] under [[Moses Montefiore]], the [[Central Consistory]] in Paris, and the ''[[Alliance Israelite Universelle]]'' all began working to assure the freedom of Jews.

Jewish emancipation, implemented under Napoleonic rule in French occupied and annexed states, suffered a setback in many member states of the [[German Confederation]] following the decisions of the [[Congress of Vienna]]. In the final revision of the Congress on the rights of the Jews, the emissary of the [[Bremen (state)|Free Hanseatic City of Bremen]], [[Johann Smidt]] - unauthorised and unconsented to by the other parties - altered the text from "The confessors of Jewish faith are preserved the rights already conceded to them '''in''' the confederal states", by replacing a single word, which entailed serious consequences, into: "The confessors of Jewish faith are preserved the rights already conceded to them '''by''' the confederal states."&lt;ref&gt;In the German original: "Es werden den Bekennern des jüdischen Glaubens die denselben '''in''' ['''von''', respectively] den einzelnen Bundesstaaten bereits eingeräumten Rechte erhalten." Cf. [[Heinrich Graetz]], ''Geschichte der Juden von den ältesten Zeiten bis auf die Gegenwart'': 11 vols., Leipzig: Leiner, 1900, vol. 11: 'Geschichte der Juden vom Beginn der Mendelssohnschen Zeit (1750) bis in die neueste Zeit (1848)', p. 317. Emphasis not in the original. Reprint of the edition  revised by the author: Berlin: Arani, 1998, {{ISBN|3-7605-8673-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of German states used the altered text version as legal grounds to reverse the Napoleonic emancipation of Jewish citizens. The Prussian emissary [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] and the Austrian [[Klemens von Metternich]] promoted the preservation of Jewish emancipation, as maintained by their own countries, but were not successful in others.&lt;ref name="ohio.edu"&gt;Sharfman, Glenn R.,  [http://www.ohio.edu/chastain/ip/jewemanc.htm Jewish Emancipation], in [http://www.ohio.edu/chastain/contents.htm Encyclopedia of 1848 Revolutions]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Revolutions of 1848]], Jewish emancipation was granted by the Basic Rights of the [[Frankfurt Parliament]] (Paragraph 13), which said that civil rights were not to be conditional on religious faith. But only some German states introduced the Frankfurt parliamentary decision as state law, such as Hamburg; other states were reluctant. Important German states, such as [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] (1812), [[Kingdom of Württemberg|Württemberg]] (1828), [[Electorate of Hesse]] (1833), and [[Kingdom of Hanover|Hanover]] (1842), had already emancipated their Jews as citizens. By doing so, they hoped to educate the gentiles, and terminate laws which sought to oppress the Jews.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although the movement was mostly successful; some early emancipated Jewish communities continued to suffer persisting or new ''de facto'', though not legal, discrimination against those Jews trying to achieve careers in public service and education. Those few states that had refrained from Jewish emancipation were forced to do so by an act of the [[North German Federation]] on 3 July 1869, or when they acceded to the newly [[German Empire|united Germany]] in 1871. The emancipation of all Jewish Germans was reversed by [[Nazi Germany]] from 1933 through [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=jvl/&gt;

==Dates of emancipation==
In some countries, emancipation came with a single act. In others, limited rights were granted first in the hope of "changing" the Jews "for the better."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.friends-partners.org/partners/beyond-the-pale/eng_captions/21-5.html |title=THE DEVELOPMENT OF MODERN ANTI-SEMITISM: images pg.21 |publisher=Friends-partners.org |date= |accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences==

===The emancipation and the practice of Judaism===
{{editorial|date=September 2016}}The emancipation disrupted the relationship the Jews had with their religion, which could not govern any longer all the actions in their lives. Many considered a practice of Judaism more closely to the lifestyle of their non-Jewish fellow citizens. The emancipation in France, Italy, Germany, at least during the Empire, permitted many Jews to leave the ghettos and contribute, as a result of the [[Haskalah]], to the development of [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] during the 19th century. The emancipation contributed moreover to the assimilation of Jews and sometimes to their cultural disappearance when Jews merged through marriage in the surrounding society. It was not until Rabbi [[Samson Raphael Hirsch]] defined a modern vision of orthodox Judaism, enabling orthodox Jews to participate fully in a society.&lt;ref name=jvl/&gt;{{Failed verification|date=January 2016|reason=SR Hirsch's movement is not discussed in source}}{{ clarify | date = January 2016 | reason =sentence is a grammatical fragment, thought incomplete }} Ultimately, emancipation immersed the Jews into a new culture. In doing so, Jews were able to not only see themselves as members of a religious sect, but also as citizens within society. At the same time, however, some {{who|date=September 2016}} were concerned that leaders within the Jewish movement were seeking to position Judaism with an approach catered toward a new Western civilization.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Modern Judaism|last=C.

'''Kasaya''' is attachment to worldly objects and is an obstacle in the path leading to [[Nirvikalpa]] [[Samadhi]]: it is overcome through [[viveka]], discrimination.

==Meaning==

'''Kasaya''' or ''Kashāya'' ([[Sanskrit]]: कषाय) means, 'astringent', 'decay', 'smearing', 'juice', 'degeneracy', 'anointing',  'gum', 'resin', 'red-brown', 'stupidity', 'defect', 'fragrant'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sanskrit Dictionary|publisher=Spokensanskrit.de|url= http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&amp;beginning=0+&amp;tinput=%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%B7%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%AF&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also means 'attachment to worldly objects' or to 'the yellowish-red garments worn by monks'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Practical Sanskrit-English dictionary|author=Vaman Shivaram Apte|publisher=Digital Dictionaries of South Asia|url=http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/contextualize.pl?p.2.apte.250899}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

[[Sadananda (of Vedantasara)|Sadananda]] defines ''Kasaya'' as attachment to worldly objects, the failure of the mental state to rest on the Absolute, owing to the numbness brought on by impressions due to attachment even when there is no torpidity or distraction ([[Vedantasara (of Sadananda)|Vedantasara]])  (Sl.212).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vedantasara Ed.1931|author=Sadananda|publisher=Advaita Ashrama|page=120|url= http://www.estudantedavedanta.net/Vedantasara-Nikhilananda.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Vedanta]],  the word Kasaya denotes metaphorically a rigid state of mind hardened by one's own inclinations and passions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Chinese Culture|publisher=Chinese Cultural Research Institute|page=69|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=QF8bAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=Kasaya+Vedanta&amp;dq=Kasaya+Vedanta&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=nYsyU5fiG8j_rQfK-YHoCQ&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAjg8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jiva==

Rishi Gautama Nodha ([[Rig Veda]] I.58.3) describes the [[Jiva]] in the following words:-

:क्राणा रुद्रेभिर्वसुभिः पुरोहितो होता निषत्तो रयिषाळमर्त्यः|
:रथो न विक्ष्वृञ्जसान आयुषु वयानुषग्वार्या देव ऋण्वति ||

:"That is the Jiva (क्राणा – the spotless achiever of good deeds) who should be known as the one who moves about (निसत्तः) in the bodily form (होता) applying and enjoying all substances and thoughts (the gross and the fine) all the while attached to this earth or world (वसुभिः) guided and impelled by the [[Prana]]s (रुद्रेभिः) experiencing the varying stages of birth, growth, maturity etc., (आयुषु) and all attendant consequences (ॠञ्ज्सानः) with a view to enjoying the desired happiness and comfort though in reality by itself it is pure and undying. "

And, Rishi Kumaro Yamayana ([[Rig Veda]] X.135.6) in the following mantra explains

:यथाभवदनुदेयी ततो अग्रमजायत |
:पुरस्ताद् बुध्न आततः पश्चान्निरयणं कृतम् ||

that the Paramatman "universal Soul" is the primordial existence, remaining throughout creation, omnipresent, even as the Jivatman "individual Soul" dons a body and experiences bondage to "material objectives" and duality or (unknowing) of that omniprescence &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Illumination of Knowledge|author=Ravinder Kumar Soni|publisher=GBD Books|pages=285, 236|url=https://openlibrary.org/search?author_key=OL6886704A&amp;has_fulltext=false&amp;publisher_facet=GBD+Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the ''Jiva'', who by its actions, attracts to itself the ''[[pudgala]]s'' (the tendencies that keep an individual re-incarnating), which results in its bondage; all that one enjoys or suffers from are the products of karmas, good or bad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Bases of Indian Culture|author=Amiya Kumar Mazumdar|publisher=Ramakrishna Vedanta Math|page=324|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dZMtAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Kasaya+Vedanta&amp;dq=Kasaya+Vedanta&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=nYsyU5fiG8j_rQfK-YHoCQ&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAzg8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gaudapada’s exposition==

[[Gaudapada]] (Gaudapada Karika III.44-45) warns that the seeker after truth should not linger on the bliss of [[Savikalpa]] [[Samadhi]] because that enjoyment (''rasavada''), after ''Laya'', ''[[Vikṣepa|Vikshepa]]'' and ''Kasaya'', is the fourth kind of obstacle in the path to [[Nirvikalpa]] [[Samadhi]]; one should be unattached through "viveka", discrimination.  Attachment is a weakness of the mind as it is not easily disciplined  to withdraw from the enjoyment and related effects arising out of desire. He explains: as in dreams where the mind vibrates with dual aspects, so too in the waking state these aspects seem to be all that there is but when the state of"nirati", dissolution of the mind is achieved, duality is no longer perceived. The conduct of the mind in deep sleep (when it loses itself) is not like its conduct in the controlled state (when it does not lose itself), and

:ग्रहो न तत्र नोत्सर्गश्चिन्ता यत्र न विद्यते |
:आत्मसंस्थं तदा ज्ञानमजाति समतां गतम् ||

:"there may be no duality where all mental activity ceases: then, the jivatma attaining oneness with the knowable Brahman becomes established in the Self, unborn and poised in equality" (Gaudapada Karika III.38).

Torpidity or ''Laya'' (लय) is overwhelm of the senses and the mental state, falling asleep unable to maintain awareness of the Absolute; and distraction or ''Vikshepa'' (विक्षेप) is through failing to be able to rest the mental state on the Absolute, resting it on other things.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Eight Upanishads|publisher=Advaita Ashrama|pages=305–322|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==

[[Patanjali]] (Yoga Sutras II.2) – समाधि – भवनार्थः क्लेश – तनूकरनार्थश्च – assures that by cultivating the power of concentration the obstacles - which cause all suffering -  in the way of enlightenment -  can be removed. The obstacles he refers to are the negative effects of ignorance, egoism, attachment, aversion and the desire to cling to life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Patanjali Yoga Sutras|publisher=Sri Ramakrishna Math|pages=67–68|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; And, as regards the enjoyment of bliss attained coinciding the gain of non-conceptual knowledge   [[Adi Sankara|Sankara]] advocating  the understanding of the depth-meaning (lakshyatha) of the Mahavakya [[Tat Twam Asi]], states

'''Lean enterprise''' is a practice focused on value creation for the end customer with minimal waste and processes. The term has historically been associated with [[lean manufacturing]] and [[Six Sigma]] (or [[Lean Six Sigma]]) due to lean principles being popularized by [[Toyota]] in the automobile manufacturing industry and subsequently the electronics and internet software industries.

==Principles and variants==

Principles for lean enterprise derive from [[lean manufacturing]] and [[Six Sigma]] principles:

There are five principles, originating from lean manufacturing, outlined by James Womack and Daniel Jones&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maskell.com/lean_accounting/subpages/lean_manufacturing/lt_the_principles_of_lean_manufacturing.html Maskell - The Principles of Lean Manufacturing]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/Lean_Thinking.html?id=2eWHaAyiNrgC James Womack &amp; Daniel Jones - Lean Thinking: Banish Waste and Create Wealth In Your Corporation]&lt;/ref&gt;

* Value: Understand clearly what value the customer wants for the product or service.
* Value Stream: The entire flow of a product's or service's life cycle. In other words, from raw materials, production of the product or service, customer delivery, customer use, and final disposal.
* Flow: Keep the value stream moving. If it's not moving, it's creating waste and less value for the customer.
* Pull: Do not make anything until the customer orders it. 
* Perfection: Systematically and continuously remove root causes of poor quality from production processes.

There are key lean enterprise principles originating from [[Lean Six Sigma]] principles. These principles focus on eliminating 8 varieties of waste ([[Muda (Japanese term)|Muda]]) and form the acronym DOWNTIME:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://flevy.com/lean-management | title=Lean Management | publisher=Flevy | accessdate=20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Defects
* Overproduction
* Waiting
* Non-Utilized Talent
* Transportation
* Inventory
* Motion
* Extra-Processing

These 8 varieties of waste are derivative from the original 7 wastes as defined in the Toyota Production System. They are:
* Transportation
* Inventory
* Motion
* Waiting
* Overproduction
* Over-processing
* Defects

The 8th waste of non-utilized talent was not recognized until post-Americanization of the Toyota Production System.

The [[lean startup]] principles, developed from 2008 from [[lean manufacturing]], also now contribute to our understanding of lean enterprise:

* Eliminate wasteful practices
* Increase value producing practices
* Customer feedback during product development
* Build what customers want
* [[Performance indicator|KPI]]s
* Continuous deployment process

==History==

===Early 1900s: Ford, GM &amp; Toyota Systems===

[[Henry Ford]] developed a process called [[assembly line]] production. This is a manufacturing process in which parts are added as the assembly moves from work station to work station where parts are added in sequence until final assembly is produced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/moving-assembly-line-at-ford History.com - Moving Assembly Line at Ford]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alfred Sloan]] of [[General Motors]] further developed the concept of assembly line production by building a process called [[mass production]] that allowed scale and variety. This process enabled large amounts of standardized products to run through assembly lines while still being able to produce more variety and compete against Ford's single offering.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autolife.umd.umich.edu/Labor/L_Overview/L_Overview4.htm Stephen Meyer - The Degradation of Work Revisited: Workers and Technology in the American Auto Industry, 1900-2000]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kiichiro Toyoda]] studied the Ford production system and adapted the process in order to have smaller production quantities. He built a production system called [[Just-in-Time Manufacturing]] for [[Toyota]] along with [[Taichi Ohno]]. It's worth noting too that [[kaizen]], the process of continuous improvement, was developed in the 1950s by [[Eiji Toyoda]] along with the [[Toyota Production System]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sae.org/manufacturing/lean/column/leanjun01.htm | title=Lean Manufacturing and the Toyota Production System | publisher=SAE International | accessdate=20 May 2015 | author=Becker, Ronald M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s &amp; 1990s: Motorola===

New innovations in lean enterprise moved away from machine technology to electronic technology.

Another development was management techniques from [[Motorola]] commonly referred to as [[Six Sigma]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sixsigmainstitute.com/sixsigma/index_6sigma.shtml Six Sigma Institute - History of Six Sigma at Motorola]&lt;/ref&gt; This management technique was built off of mass production principles with more focus on minimizing variability. Applying Six Sigma principles led to reduced cycle time, reduced pollution, reduced costs, increased customer satisfaction, and increased profits.

===1990s &amp; 2000s: Internet companies===

New innovations in lean enterprise moved away from electronic manufacturing to internet and software technology. Before, during, and after the [[dot-com bubble]], internet and software enterprises originally did not place emphasis on lean enterprise principles for efficient usage and allocation of capital and labor due to accessible funds from [[venture capital]] and [[capital markets]]. The idea of "build it and they will come" became common practice as a result.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/dotcon/thinking/game.html KQED - Inside the dotcom IPO game]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[dot-com bubble]], inspired by the [[Agile Manifesto]], internet and software companies began operating under agile software development practices such as [[Extreme programming]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://agilemanifesto.org/history.html Kent Beck et al. -  History: The Agile Manifesto]&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the agile software movement, companies (especially startups) applied both lean enterprise and agile software principles together in order to develop new products or even new companies more efficiently and based on validated customer demand. Very early practices of lean enterprise and agile software principles was commonly referred to as [[lean startup]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inc.com/magazine/201110/eric-ries-usability-testing-product-development.html Inc. - Creating the Lean Startup]&lt;/ref&gt;

After 2010, more and more enterprises are adopting this new branch of lean enterprise ([[lean startup]]) since it provides principles and methodologies for non-internet enterprises to enter in new markets or offer goods and services in new form factors with less time, labor, and capital. For internet and software enterprises (by tradition), the [[Lean startup]] variant of lean enterprise enabled them to remain competitive with new technologies and services that are rapidly coming out to market without exclusively resorting to [[mergers and acquisitions]], and being able to retain internal innovation ecosystem competency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://grasshopperherder.com/lean-enterprise-innovation-ecosystems/ Tristan Kromer - Lean Enterprise &amp; Innovation Ecosystems]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.hbr.org/2014/04/how-ge-applies-lean-startup-practices/ Brad Power - How GE Applies Lean Startup Practices]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nordstrompeoplelab.com/how-intuit-is-applying-lean-startup-and-design-thinking-principles/ Bruce Upbin - How Intuit Is Applying Lean Startup And Design Thinking Principles]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Perpetual peace''' refers to a state of affairs where [[peace]] is permanently established over a certain area.{{fact|date=November 2017}}

The idea of perpetual peace was first suggested in the 18th century, when [[Charles-Irénée Castel de Saint-Pierre]] published his essay "Project for Perpetual Peace" anonymously while working as the negotiator for the [[Treaty of Utrecht]]. However, the idea did not become well known until the late 18th century. The term ''perpetual peace'' became acknowledged when German philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] published his 1795 essay "[[Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch]]".&lt;ref&gt;Pietrzyk, Mark E.,Ph.D. "The Idea of a Democratic Zone of Peace: Origins in the Enlightenment" &lt;{{cite web |url=http://www.internationalorder.org/idea.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130619045843/http://www.internationalorder.org/idea.html |archivedate=2013-06-19 |df= }}&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Perpetual peace has had significant influence upon modern politics. Perpetual peace has been the foundation for [[peace and conflict studies]], a relatively newly laid field which started in Europe around the 1950s and 1960s.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[[Peace and conflict studies]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Kantian view and its descendants==
The other modern plans for a perpetual peace descend from Kant's 1795 essay, "[[Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch]]" ("''[[:de:Zum ewigen Frieden|Zum ewigen Frieden. Ein philosophischer Entwurf]]''"). In this essay, Kant described his proposed peace program. Perpetual peace is arguably seen as the starting point of contemporary liberal thought.

"Perpetual Peace" is structured in two parts. The Preliminary Articles described the steps that should be taken immediately, or with all deliberate speed:
#"No secret treaty of peace shall be held valid in which there is tacitly reserved matter for a future war"
#"No independent states, large or small, shall come under the dominion of another state by inheritance, exchange, purchase, or donation"
#"[[Standing army|Standing armies]] shall in time be totally abolished"
#"[[National debts]] shall not be contracted with a view to the external friction of states"
#"No state shall by force interfere with the constitution or government of another state"
#"No state shall, during war, permit such acts of hostility which would make mutual confidence in the subsequent peace impossible: such are the employment of assassins (percussores), poisoners (venefici), breach of capitulation, and incitement to treason (perduellio) in the opposing state"

Three Definitive Articles would provide not merely a cessation of hostilities, but a foundation on which to build a peace:
#"The civil [[constitution]] of every state should be [[Republic|republican]]"
#"The law of nations shall be founded on a federation of free states"
#"The law of [[world citizenship]] shall be limited to conditions of universal [[hospitality]]"

Kant's essay in some ways resembles modern [[democratic peace theory]], though it also differs significantly from it. He speaks of [[Republicanism|republican]] (''Republikanisch'') states (rather than of [[Democracy|democratic]] ones), which he defines to have [[Representation (politics)|representative]] governments, in which the [[legislature]] is [[separation of powers|separated]] from the [[executive (government)|executive]]. He does not discuss [[universal suffrage]], which is vital to modern democracy and quite important to some modern theorists; his commentators dispute whether it is implied by his language. Most importantly, he does not regard [[republic]]an governments as sufficient by themselves to produce peace: freedom of travel, though not necessarily migration, (hospitality); and a league of nations are necessary to consciously enact his six-point program.

Unlike some modern theorists, Kant claims not that republics will be at peace only with each other, but are more pacific than other forms of government in general.

The general idea that popular and [[responsible government]]s would be more inclined to promote peace and commerce became one current in the stream of European thought and political practice. It was one element of the American policy of [[George Canning]] and the foreign policy of [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]]. It was also represented in the [[liberal internationalism]] of [[Woodrow Wilson]], [[George Creel]], and [[H.G. Wells]], although other planks in Kant's platform had even more influence.  In the next generation, Kant's program was represented by the [[Four Freedoms]] and the [[United Nations]].

Kant's essay is a three-legged stool (besides the preliminary disarmament). Various projects for perpetual peace have relied on one leg – either claiming that it is sufficient to produce peace, or that it will create the other two.

In 1909, [[Norman Angell]] relied only upon the second leg, arguing that modern commerce made war necessarily unprofitable, even for the technically victorious country, and therefore the possibility of successful war was ''[[The Great Illusion]]''. [[James Mill]] had described the [[British Empire]] as [[workfare|outdoor relief]] for the upper classes; [[Joseph Schumpeter]] argued that [[capitalism]] made modern [[Sovereign state|states]] inherently peaceful and opposed to conquest and [[imperialism]], which economically favored the old [[Aristocracy|aristocratic]] elites.

This theory has been well developed in recent years.  Mansfield and Pollins, writing in the Journal of Conflict Resolution, summarize a large body of empirical work which, for the most part, supports the thesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~johnston/GOV90ia/week%203/mansfield.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828175701/http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~johnston/GOV90ia/week%203/mansfield.pdf |archivedate=August 28, 2008 |title=The Study of Interdependence and Conflict |first1=Edward D |last1=Mansfield |first2=Brian M |last2=Pollins |journal=Journal of Conflict Resolution |volume=45 |number=6 |date=December 2001 |pages=834–859}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are various exceptions and qualifications which seem to limit the circumstances under which economic interdependence results in conflict reduction.  On the other hand, moving beyond economic interdependence to the issue of [[economic freedom]] within states, Erik Gartzke has found [[empirical evidence]] that economic freedom (as measured by the [[Fraser Institute Economic Freedom Index]]) is about fifty times more effective than democracy in reducing violent conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url=http://www.cato.org/pubs/efw/efw2005/efw2005-2.pdf |title=Economic Freedom of the World: 2005 Annual Report |chapter=2: Economic Freedom and Peace |first=Erik |last=Gartzke |publisher=The Cato Institute |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081016060114/http://www.cato.org/pubs/efw/efw2005/efw2005-2.pdf |archivedate=2008-10-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third leg is the old idea that a confederation of peaceable princes could produce a perpetual peace. Kant had distinguished his league from a universal state; [[Clarence Streit]] proposed, in ''Union Now'' (1938), a union of the democratic states modelled after the Constitution of the United States. He argued that trade and the peaceable ways of democracy would keep this Union perpetual, and counted on the combined power of the Union to deter the [[Axis Powers|Axis]] from war.

In "[[A Plan for an Universal and Perpetual Peace]]", part IV of ''[[Principles of International Law]]'' (1786–89), [[Jeremy Bentham]] proposed that disarmament, arbitration, and the renunciation of colonies would produce perpetual peace,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.laits.utexas.edu/poltheory/bentham/pil/pil.e04.html |title=A Plan for an Universal and Perpetual Peace |work=The Principles of International Law |first=Jeremy |last=Bentham}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus relying merely on Kant's preliminary articles and on none of the three main points; contrary to the modern theorists, he relied on public opinion, even against the [[absolute monarchy in Sweden]].

Since 2008, the Perpetual Peace Project—a partnership between the [[European Union National Institutes for Culture]] (EUNIC), the [[International Peace Institute]] (IPI), the [[United Nations University]], [[Slought Foundation]], and [[Syracuse University]]—is engaging Kant's essay in an ongoing philosophical and curatorial initiative that is conceptualized around ultimately "re-writing" Kant's 1795 treatise,&lt;ref&gt;"Gregg Lambert presents the Perpetual Peace Project" &lt;{{cite web |url=https://iah.unc.edu/events/calendar/2012/lecture-gregg-lambert-presents-the-perpetual-peace-project |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141017193441/https://iah.unc.edu/events/calendar/2012/lecture-gregg-lambert-presents-the-perpetual-peace-project |archivedate=2014-10-17 |df= }}&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a republication of the essay.&lt;ref&gt;Utrecht University 'Perpetual Peace Project' &lt;http://www.uu.nl/faculty/humanities/NL/centreforthehumanities/nieuws/Pages/20121122cfh-Perpetual-Peace-Project-2013.aspx&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Thinking through the ideas behind the project and its links to Kant, [[Gregg Lambert]], Aaron Levy, and Martin Rauchbauer rely on the secret article contained in the second supplement which "is detached from the main body of the public treatise that outlines the preliminary and definitive articles, and offered as a secret pact".&lt;ref&gt;Lambert, Gregg, Levy, Aaron, and Rauchbauer, Martin "The Idea of Perpetual Peace" &lt;http://perpetualpeaceproject.org/idea.php&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; They draw on the ironic tone of Kant's writing to argue that the treatise performs the idea that the conditions for peace are best considered silently. Secretly, that is, statesmen and politicians can take the idea of peace seriously, since it will never be associated with them. As such, the project brings together theorists and practitioners, such as diplomats, policy experts, philosophers, and artists, in order to revisit 21st century prospects for international peace through Kant's essay, in order to "change people's minds, get them to take the idea seriously, start to imagine what it would be like to live in a peaceful society".&lt;ref&gt;Syracuse University News, Sep 5, 2012, "Two Minutes With Gregg Lambert" &lt;http://asnews.syr.edu/newsevents_2012/releases/gregg_lambert_interview.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The Perpetual Peace Project finds its public form in symposia, exhibitions, lectures, as well as a feature film.&lt;ref&gt;Project website: &lt;http://perpetualpeaceproject.org/&gt;.

'''Pharmacological torture''' is the use of [[psychotropic]] or other [[drugs]] to punish or extract information from a person.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;"[http://www.uia.be/sites/uia.be/db/db/x.php?dbcode=pr&amp;go=e&amp;id=11546960 Pharmacological Torture"] World Problems Online.  Union of International Associations&lt;/ref&gt; The aim is to force compliance by causing distress, which could be in the form of pain, anxiety, psychological disturbance, immobilization, or disorientation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

One form of this [[torture]] involves forcibly injecting a person with [[addictive drug]]s in order to induce physical dependence. The drug is then withdrawn, and, once the person is in [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]], the interrogation is started. If the person complies with the torturer's demands, the drug is reintroduced, relieving the person's withdrawal symptoms.{{sfn|Rejali|2009|p=73}}

==Alleged use ==
{{Expand section|date=December 2014}}

===Brazil===
In Brazil, pharmacological torture involved the injection of alcohol into the tongue in the 1940s, the injection of ether into the scrotum in the 1960s, and drugs were used to cause strong contractions in the 1970s. Also, [[muscle relaxant]]s were used to minimize muscular rigidity and bone fractures caused by [[electric shock]] in the 1970s.{{sfn|Rejali|2009|p=309}}

===Romania===
In the 1960s, prisoners were reportedly given drugs to make them talk in their sleep.{{sfn|Rejali|2009|p=396}}

===South Africa===
In 2013, leaked video footage shot inside South Africa's [[Mangaung Prison]] showed a prisoner with no record of mental illness being forcibly injected, apparently with anti-psychotic drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-24694214 | title= 'Shocking' abuse claims at South Africa's Mangaung prison | date= 2013-10-28 | accessdate = 2015-12-01 |work= [[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Legal Resources Centre]], a non-governmental organization, is representing 13 clients who allege they were forcibly injected with the drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lrc.org.za/lrc-in-the-news/3657-tortured-mangaung-prisoners-seek-justice | title= Tortured Mangaung prisoners seek justice | date= 2015-11-27 | accessdate = 2015-12-01 |work= [[Legal Resources Centre]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soviet Union===
In the former [[Soviet Union]], drugs were allegedly used as a form of punishment. [[Haloperidol]], an [[antipsychotic]] medication, was a preferred agent. It was used to induce intense restlessness and [[Parkinson's]]-type symptoms.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{page needed|date=January 2015}} Another antipsychotic medication, chlorpromazine, was also used to induce grogginess, sedation, and (in high doses) [[vegetative state]]s. Other alleged uses of pharmacological torture included:
*Use of [[insulin shock therapy]] to render people [[coma]]tose.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{page needed|date=January 2015}}
*Administering [[Sulfazin]] to induce severe [[fever]]s.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{page needed|date=January 2015}}
*Use of [[sodium amobarbital]] with [[LSD]] to cause loss of inhibition.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{page needed|date=January 2015}}

===United States===

In the [[United States]], in a series of hearings in the fall and winter of 1977, Congressional committees drew forth disclosure of project [[MKULTRA]], which was most active between 1953 and 1966 and conducted experiments that included the [[CIA]] agents administering [[LSD]] and [[Truth Serum]] to soldiers, citizens, and foreign nationals without their knowledge or consent.  Activities of [[MKULTRA]] resulted in at least one death, that of [[Frank Olson]], an army scientist who was given LSD without his knowledge, and committed suicide as a result of his experience.&lt;ref&gt;John M.

In 1953 [[Harold Blauer]] died in a New York State psychiatric institute after doctors there administered [[3,4-Methylenedioxyamphetamine]] derivatives to him without his consent, as part of a 1950s secret program run by the US army that tested [[chemical warfare agents]] on US citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press in the Los Angeles Times.

{{orphan|date=May 2017}}
In the field of [[microbiome]] research, a group of [[species]] is said to show a '''phylosymbiotic''' signal if the degree of similarity between the species' microbiomes recapitulates to a significant extent their [[evolutionary history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=W. Brooks|first1=Andrew|title=Phylosymbiosis: Relationships and Functional Effects of Microbial Communities across Host Evolutionary History|journal=PLOS Biology|date=November 18, 2016|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.2000225.g004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In other words, a phylosymbiotic signal among a group of species is evident if their microbiome similarity [[dendrogram]] could significantly
recapitulate their hosts phylogenic tree. For the analysis of the phylosymbiotic signal to be reliable, environmental differences
that could shape the host microbiome should be either eliminated or accounted for.
One plausible mechanistic explanation for such phenomena could be, for example, a result of host immune genes that rapidly evolve in a continues [[arms race]] with members of its microbiome.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9252">In [[mathematics]], an [[algebraic structure]] &lt;math&gt;(R,T)&lt;/math&gt; consisting of a non-empty set &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;  and a ternary mapping &lt;math&gt;T \colon R^3 \to R \,&lt;/math&gt; may be called a '''ternary system'''.  A '''planar ternary ring''' (PTR) or '''ternary field'''  is special type of ternary system used by {{harvtxt|Hall|1943}} to construct [[projective plane]]s by means of coordinates. A planar ternary ring is not a [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]] in the traditional sense.

There is wide variation in the terminology.  Planar ternary rings or ternary fields as defined here have been called by other names in the literature, and the term "planar ternary ring" can mean a variant of the system defined here. The term "ternary ring" often means a planar ternary ring, but it can also simply mean a ternary system.

==Definition==

A '''planar ternary ring''' is a structure &lt;math&gt;(R,T)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is a set containing at least two distinct elements, called 0 and 1, and &lt;math&gt;T\colon R^3\to R \,&lt;/math&gt; is a mapping which satisfies these five axioms:
# &lt;math&gt;T(a,0,b)=T(0,a,b)=b,\quad \forall a,b \in R&lt;/math&gt;;
# &lt;math&gt;T(1,a,0)=T(a,1,0)=a,\quad \forall a \in R&lt;/math&gt;;
# &lt;math&gt;\forall a,b,c,d \in R, a\neq c&lt;/math&gt;, there is a unique &lt;math&gt;x\in R&lt;/math&gt; such that : &lt;math&gt;T(x,a,b)=T(x,c,d) \,&lt;/math&gt;;
# &lt;math&gt;\forall a,b,c \in R&lt;/math&gt;, there is a unique &lt;math&gt;x \in R&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;T(a,b,x)=c \,&lt;/math&gt;; and
# &lt;math&gt;\forall a,b,c,d \in R, a\neq c&lt;/math&gt;, the equations &lt;math&gt;T(a,x,y)=b,T(c,x,y)=d \,&lt;/math&gt; have a unique solution &lt;math&gt;(x,y)\in R^2&lt;/math&gt;.

When &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is finite, the third and fifth axioms are equivalent in the presence of the fourth.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hughes|Piper|1973|loc=p. 118, Theorem 5.4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No other pair (0', 1') in &lt;math&gt;R^2&lt;/math&gt; can be found such that &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; still satisfies the first two axioms.

==Binary operations==
===Addition===
Define &lt;math&gt;a\oplus b=T(a,1,b)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;In the literature there are two versions of this definition. This is the form used by {{harvtxt|Hall|1959|loc=p. 355}}, {{harvtxt|Albert|Sandler|1968|loc=p. 50}}, and {{harvtxt|Dembowski|1968|loc=p. 128}}, while &lt;math&gt;a \oplus b = T(1,a,b)&lt;/math&gt; is used by {{harvtxt|Hughes|Piper|1973|loc=p. 117}}, {{harvtxt|Pickert|1975|loc=p. 38}}, and {{harvtxt|Stevenson|1972|loc=p. 274}}. The difference comes from the alternative ways these authors coordinatize the plane.&lt;/ref&gt; The structure &lt;math&gt;(R,\oplus)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Loop (algebra)|loop]] with [[identity element]] 0.

===Multiplication===
Define &lt;math&gt;a\otimes b=T(a,b,0)&lt;/math&gt;. The set &lt;math&gt;R_{0} = R \setminus \{0\} \,&lt;/math&gt; is closed under this multiplication.  The structure &lt;math&gt;(R_{0},\otimes)&lt;/math&gt; is also a loop, with identity element 1.

===Linear PTR===
A planar ternary ring &lt;math&gt;(R,T)&lt;/math&gt; is said to be ''linear'' if &lt;math&gt;T(a,b,c)=(a\otimes b)\oplus c,\quad \forall a,b,c \in R&lt;/math&gt;.
For example, the planar ternary ring associated to a [[quasifield]] is (by construction) linear.{{cn|date=July 2013}}

==Connection with projective planes==
[[File:Projective_Plane_Coordinates.svg |thumb|400px|Coordinates of a projective plane to establish a planar ternary ring]]

Given a planar ternary ring &lt;math&gt;(R,T)&lt;/math&gt;, one can construct a [[projective plane]] with point set ''P'' and line set ''L'' as follows:&lt;ref&gt;R. H. Bruck, ''Recent Advances in the Foundations of Euclidean Plane Geometry'', (1955) Appendix I.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|1943|loc=p.247 Theorem 5.4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (Note that &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; is an extra symbol not in &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;.)

Let
* &lt;math&gt;P=\{(a,b)|a,b\in R\}\cup \{(a)|a \in R \}\cup \{(\infty)\}&lt;/math&gt;, and 
* &lt;math&gt;L=\{[a,b]|a,b \in R\}\cup\{[a]|a \in R \}\cup \{[\infty]\}&lt;/math&gt;.

Then define, &lt;math&gt;\forall a,b,c,d \in R&lt;/math&gt;, the [[incidence relation]] &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; in this way:
:&lt;math&gt;((a,b),[c,d])\in I \Longleftrightarrow T(a,c,d)=b&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;((a,b),[c])\in I \Longleftrightarrow a=c&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; ((a,b),[\infty])\notin I&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;((a), [c,d])\in I \Longleftrightarrow a=c&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;((a), [c])\notin I&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;((a),[\infty])\in I&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;((\infty),[c,d])\notin I&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;((\infty),[a])\in I&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;((\infty),[\infty])\in I&lt;/math&gt;

Every projective plane can be constructed in this way, starting with an appropriate planar ternary ring.  However, two nonisomorphic planar ternary rings can lead to the construction of isomorphic projective planes.

Conversely, given any projective plane π, by choosing four points, labelled ''o'', ''e'', ''u'', and ''v'', no three of which lie on the same line, coordinates can be introduced in π so that these special points are given the coordinates: ''o'' = (0,0), ''e'' = (1,1), ''v'' = (&lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;) and ''u'' = (0).&lt;ref&gt;This can be done in several ways. A short description of the method used by {{harvtxt|Hall|1943}} can be found in {{harvtxt|Dembowski|1968|loc=p. 127}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The ternary operation is now defined on the coordinate symbols (except &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;) by ''y'' = T(''x'',''a'',''b'') if and only if the point (''x'',''y'') lies on the line which joins (''a'') with (0,''b''). The axioms defining a projective plane are used to show that this gives a planar ternary ring. 

Linearity of the PTR is equivalent to a geometric condition holding in the associated projective plane.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dembowski|1968|loc=p. 129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related algebraic structures==
PTR's which satisfy additional algebraic conditions are given other names. These names are not uniformly applied in the literature. The following listing of names and properties is taken from {{harvtxt|Dembowski|1968|loc=p. 129}}.
 
A linear PTR whose additive loop is [[Associative property|associative]] (and thus a [[Group (mathematics)|group ]]), is called a '''cartesian group'''. In a cartesian group, the mappings

&lt;math&gt;x \longrightarrow -x \otimes a + x \otimes b &lt;/math&gt;, and
&lt;math&gt;x \longrightarrow a \otimes x - b \otimes x &lt;/math&gt;

must be permutations whenever &lt;math&gt;a \neq b&lt;/math&gt;. Since cartesian groups are groups under addition, we revert to using a simple "+" for the additive operation.

A [[quasifield]] is a cartesian group satisfying the right distributive law:
&lt;math&gt; (x+y) \otimes z = x \otimes z + y \otimes z &lt;/math&gt;.
Addition in any quasifield is [[Commutative property|commutative]].

A [[semifield]] is a quasifield which also satisfies the left distributive law:
&lt;math&gt; x \otimes (y + z) = x \otimes y + x \otimes z.&lt;/math&gt;

A '''planar [[Near-field (mathematics)|nearfield]]''' is a quasifield whose multiplicative loop is associative (and hence a group). Not all nearfields are planar nearfields.

[[File:Rebus escort card.jpg|thumb|A rebus-style "escort card" from around 1865, to be read as "May I see you home my dear?"]]
[[File:Arolsen Klebeband 18 041 3.JPG|thumb|A German rebus, circa 1620.]]

A '''rebus''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|iː|b|ə|s}}) is a [[puzzle]] device which combines the use of illustrated pictures with individual letters to depict words and/or phrases. For example: the word ‘been’ might be depicted by a "rebus" showing an illustrated bumblebee next to a plus sign (+) and the letter "n". It was a favorite form of [[Heraldry|heraldic]] expression used in the [[Middle Ages]] to denote surnames.

For example, in its basic form, three [[salmon]] (fish) are used to denote the surname "[[Salmon (surname)|Salmon]]". A more sophisticated example was the rebus of Bishop [[Walter Hart|Walter Lyhart]] (d.1472) of Norwich, consisting of a [[stag]] (or [[Deer|hart]]) lying down in a conventional representation of water.

The composition alludes to the name, profession or personal characteristics of the bearer, and speaks to the beholder ''Non verbis, sed rebus'', which Latin expression signifies "not by words but by things"&lt;ref&gt;Boutell, Charles, Heraldry Historical &amp; Popular, London, 1863, pp.117–120&lt;/ref&gt; (''res, rei'' (f), a thing, object, matter; ''rebus'' being ablative plural).&lt;ref&gt;Cassell's Latin Dictionary, ed. Marchant &amp; Charles&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rebuses within heraldry==
{{Further|Canting arms}}

Rebuses are used extensively as a form of heraldic expression as a hint to the name of the bearer; they are not synonymous with [[canting arms]]. A man might have a rebus as a personal identification device entirely separate from his armorials, canting or otherwise. For example, [[Richard Weston (treasurer)|Sir Richard Weston]] (d.1541) bore as arms: ''Ermine, on a chief azure five [[bezant]]s'', whilst his rebus, displayed many times in terracotta plaques on the walls of his mansion [[Sutton Place, Surrey]], was a "tun" or barrel, used to designate the last syllable of his surname.

An example of canting arms proper are those of the [[Congleton|Borough of Congleton]] in Cheshire consisting of a [[conger]] eel, a lion (in Latin, ''leo'') and a tun (barrel). This word sequence "conger-leo-tun" enunciates the town's name.
Similarly, the coat of arms of [[St. Ignatius Loyola]] contains wolves (in Spanish, ''lobo'') and a kettle (''olla''), said by some (probably incorrectly) to be a rebus for "Loyola". The arms of [[Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon]] feature [[bow (weapon)|bows]] and lions.

==Modern rebuses, word plays==
[[File:Top Secret Rebus Puzzle.png|thumb|A rebus puzzle representing [[top secret]]]]
A modern example of the rebus used as a form of [[word play]] is:
:H + [[File:Earcov.JPG|30px|Ear]]  = ''Hear'', or ''Here''.
By extension, it also uses the positioning of words or parts of words in relation to each other to convey a hidden meaning, for example:
:p walk ark'': walk in the park.

A rebus made up solely of letters (such as "CU" for "See you") is known as a [[gramogram]], grammagram, or letteral word. This concept is sometimes extended to include numbers (as in "Q8" for "[[Kuwait]]", or "8" for "ate").&lt;ref name="high"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cryptic crossword reference lists &gt; Gramograms|url=http://www.highlightpress.com.au/gramograms.html|publisher=Highlight Press|accessdate=31 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Rebuses are sometimes used in crossword puzzles, with multiple letters or a symbol fitting into a single square.&lt;ref name="nyt-solve"&gt;{{cite web|title=How to Solve The New York Times Crossword|publisher=New York Times|author=Deb Amlen|authorlink=Deb Amlen|accessdate=12 December 2017|url=https://www.nytimes.com/guides/crosswords/how-to-solve-a-crossword-puzzle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pictograms==

The term ''rebus'' also refers to the use of a [[pictogram]] to represent a syllabic sound. This adapts pictograms into [[Phonogram (linguistics)|phonograms]]. A precursor to the development of the alphabet, this process represents one of the most important developments of writing. Fully developed hieroglyphs read in rebus fashion were in use at Abydos in Egypt as early as 3400 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, Steven Roger, "A History of Writing", 2004, Reaktion Books, {{ISBN|1-86189-167-9}}, {{ISBN|978-1-86189-167-9}}, at page 36&lt;/ref&gt;

The writing of correspondence in rebus form became popular in the 18th century and continued into the 19th century. [[Lewis Carroll]] wrote the children he befriended picture-puzzle rebus letters, nonsense letters, and [[Mirror|looking-glass]] letters, which had to be held in front of a mirror to be read.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Lewis Carroll Centenary Article |work=Niles Daily Star |date=3 January 1998 |author=Dawn Comer |url=http://www.lewiscarroll.org/centenary/niles.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070513102004/http://www.lewiscarroll.org/centenary/niles.html |archive-date=13 May 2007 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rebus letters served either as a sort of [[code]] or simply as a [[pastime]].

==Rebus principle==
[[File:Ramesses II as child.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ramesses II]] as child: Hieroglyphs: ''Ra-mes-su''. ]]

In [[linguistics]], the '''rebus principle''' is the use of existing symbols, such as pictograms, purely for their sounds regardless of their meaning, to represent new words. Many ancient writing systems used the rebus principle to represent abstract words, which otherwise would be hard to represent with pictograms. An example that illustrates the Rebus principle is the representation of the sentence "I can see you" by using the pictographs of "eye—can—sea—ewe."

Some linguists believe that the Chinese developed their writing system according to the rebus principle,&lt;ref&gt;''The Languages of China''. S. Robert Ramsey. Princeton University Press, 1987, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; and Egyptian hieroglyphs sometimes used a similar system. A famous rebus statue of [[Ramses II]] uses three hieroglyphs to compose his name: [[Horus]] (as [[Ra]]), for ''Ra''; the child, ''mes''; and the sedge plant (stalk held in left hand), ''su''; the name Ra-mes-su is then formed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/50215544|title=The pharaohs|date=2002|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|others=Ziegler, Christiane.|isbn=9780500051191|location=London|oclc=50215544}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Freud]]&lt;ref&gt;Freud, S. (1900) ''[[The Interpretation of Dreams]]'' London: Hogarth Press&lt;/ref&gt; posited that the rebus was the basis for uncovering the latent content of the [[dream]].  He wrote, "A dream is a picture puzzle of this sort and our predecessors in the
field of dream interpretation have made the mistake of treating the rebus as a pictorial composition: and as such it has seemed to them
nonsensical and worthless."

==Use in game shows==
'''Canada'''
*1980s children's game show ''[[Kidstreet]]'' featured a rebus [[Kidstreet#Kidstreet Rebus|during the bonus round (or "final lap")]].

'''United Kingdom'''
*''[[Catchphrase (UK game show)|Catchphrase]]'' is a long-running game show which required contestants to decipher a rebus. The show began as a short-lived [[Catchphrase (U.S. game show)|American game show]] hosted by [[Art James]] before being seen in the United Kingdom from 1986 to 2004 and returning in 2013. There was also an [[Burgo's Catch Phrase|Australian version]] of the show hosted by [[John Burgess (host)|John Burgess]].
*In 1998, Granada TV produced ''[[Waffle (game show)|Waffle]]'', a single word rebus puzzle show that was hosted by Nick Weir, and included premium telephone line viewer participation.

'''United States'''
*Rebuses were central to the television game show ''[[Concentration (game show)|Concentration]].'' Contestants had to solve a rebus, usually partially concealed behind any of thirty "squares", to win a game.
*The [[HBO]] children's game series ''[[Crashbox]]'' features three rebus puzzles in the game segment "Ten Seconds."
*A short-lived ABC game show from 1965 known as ''The Rebus Game'' also involved contestants creating rebuses to communicate an answer.

'''India'''
*[[Dadagiri Unlimited]] is a game show, in which some rebus puzzles are used in the [[Dadagiri Unlimited#Overview|googly round]]. The show is broadcast by [[Zee Bangla]] and hosted by the famous Indian cricketer [[Sourav Ganguly#2008–present: International retirement and the Indian Premier League|Sourav Ganguly]].

==Historic examples==
[[File:Frederick-rebus.png|thumb|250px|A rebus sent to [[Voltaire]] by [[Frederick the Great]].]]
[[File:Owl-dom rebus.png|thumb|250px|Bishop [[Hugh Oldham|Oldham's]] owl-dom rebus as carved in the wall of his chantry in [[Exeter Cathedral]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Boutell |first=Charles |authorlink=Charles Boutell |title=Heraldry, Historical and Popular |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VcEYAAAAMAAJ |edition=2nd |year=1863 |publisher=Winsor and Newton |location=London |page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

* It is reported&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Danesi |first=Marcel |authorlink=Marcel Danesi |title=The Puzzle Instinct: The Meaning of Puzzles in Human Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=47PHOZBdCLYC |edition=1st |year=2002 |publisher=Indiana University Press |location=Indiana, USA |page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; that when [[Voltaire]] was the guest of [[Frederick the Great]] at [[Sanssouci Palace]], they exchanged puzzle notes. Frederick sent over a page with two picture blocks on it: two hands below the letter P, and then the number 100 below a picture of a handsaw, all followed by a question mark. Voltaire replied with: '''Ga!'''

:Both messages were rebuses in the French language: ''deux mains sous Pé à cent sous scie?'' "two hands under 'p' at [one] hundred under saw" = ''demain souper à Sanssouci?'' "supper tomorrow at Sanssouci?"); reply: ''Gé grand, A petit!'' "big 'G', small 'a'!" (= ''j'ai grand appétit!'' "I am very hungry!").

* The early 16th-century [[Bishop of Exeter]], [[Hugh Oldham]] adopted the owl as his personal device. It bore a scroll in its beak bearing the letters D.O.M., forming a rebus based on his surname, which would probably have been pronounced at the time as ''owl-dom''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.manchester2002-uk.com/celebs/philanthropy1.html |title=Manchester Celebrities – Philanthropy, Philosophy &amp; Religion – Bishop Hugh Oldham |publisher=ManchesterUK |accessdate=2011-01-03 |last=Moss |first=John |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116153116/http://manchester2002-uk.com/celebs/philanthropy1.html |archivedate=16 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The 19th-century French sculptor [[Jean-Pierre Dantan]] would place rebuses on the [[Socle (architecture)|socles]] of his caricature busts to identify the subject. For example, [[Victor Hugo]] was an axe (''hache'' in French, which sounds like the French pronunciation of "H") + UG + crossed bones (''os'', sounding like "O"). [[Hector Berlioz]] was represented by the letters BER low on the socle, with a bed (''lit'', for "li") comparatively high on the socle (to mean "''haut''", the French for high, pronounced with a silent "h" and "t" and so sounding like "O").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thearttribune.com/spip.php?page=docbig&amp;id_document=2120 The Art Tribune – ''Jean-Pierre Dantan (1800–1869), Louis-Hector Berlioz, 1833'']&lt;/ref&gt;
*Rebus Bibles such as ''[[A Curious Hieroglyphic Bible]]'' were popular in the late 18th century for teaching Bible-reading to children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://loc.gov/exhibits/treasures/tri014.html |title=A Curious Hieroglyphick Bible |work=American Treasures of the Library of Congress |publisher=Library of Congress |accessdate=January 31, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151009020545/http://loc.gov/exhibits/treasures/tri014.html |archivedate=9 October 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan, the rebus known as {{Nihongo||判じ物|hanjimono}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Hepburn|first=James Curtis|publisher=A.D.F. Randolph|year=1873|title=A Japanese-English and English-Japanese Dictionary |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v8M9AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA144}}&lt;/ref&gt; was immensely popular during the [[Edo period]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|editor-last=Morris|editor-first=Ivan|editor-link=Ivan Morris|last=Ihara|first=Saikaku|author-link=Ihara Saikaku|title=The Life of an Amorous Woman: And Other Writings|publisher=A.D.F.

Thomas |last3=Carpenter |first3=John T. |title=Kunisada's world |publisher=Japan Society, in collaboration with Ukiyo-e Society of America |year=1993 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PyM4AQAAIAAJ |isbn=978-0-913304-37-2}}, p.23&lt;/ref&gt;

Today the most often seen of these symbols is a picture of a sickle, a circle, and the letter {{Nihongo||ぬ|nu}}, read as {{Nihongo||鎌輪ぬ|kama-wa-nu|sickle circle ''nu''}}, interpreted as {{Nihongo||構わぬ|kamawanu}}, the old-fashioned form of {{Nihongo||構わない|kamawanai|don't worry, doesn't matter}}. This is known as the {{Nihongo||鎌輪奴文|kamawanu-mon|kamawanu sign}}, and dates to circa 1700,&lt;ref&gt;[http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160525003448/http://www.weblio.jp/content]&lt;/ref&gt; being used in kabuki since circa 1815.&lt;ref&gt;[https://kotobank.jp/word/] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130817053914/https://kotobank.jp/word/|date=17 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tabikaratabi.pro.tok2.com/cgi-bin/c-board.cgi?cmd=one;no=147;id=monnyoujitenn |title=旅から旅 文様事典 ＢＢＳ |publisher=Tabikaratabi.pro.tok2.com |date= |accessdate=2015-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kabuki]] actors would wear ''yukata'' and other clothing whose pictorial design, in rebus, represented their [[Yagō]] "guild names", and would distribute [[tenugui]] cloth with their rebused names as well. The practice was not restricted to the acting profession and was undertaken by townsfolk of various walks of life. There were also pictorial calendars called  {{Interlanguage link multi|egoyomi|ja|vertical-align=sup}} that represented the [[Japanese calendar]] in rebus so it could be "read" by the illiterate.

Today a number of abstract examples following certain conventions are occasionally used for names, primarily for corporate [[logo]]s or product logos and incorporating some characters of the name, as in a [[monogram]]; see [[Japanese rebus monogram]]. The most familiar example globally is the logo for [[Yamasa]] soy sauce, which is a ∧ with a サ under it. This is read as ''Yama,'' for {{Nihongo||山|yama|mountain}} (symbolized by the ∧) + {{Nihongo||サ|sa|katakana character for ''sa''}}.

==History==
Harvard evolutionary biologist [[Ernst Mayr]] (1961)&lt;ref name="Mayr1961"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mayr|first1=E|title=Cause and effect in biology|journal=Science|date=1961|volume=134|pages=1501-1506|bibcode=1961Sci...134.1501M|doi=10.1126/science.134.3489.1501}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that there are two fundamentally different types of causation in biology, [[Proximate and ultimate causation|‘ultimate’ and ‘proximate’]]. Ultimate causes (e.g. [[natural selection]]) were seen as (i) providing historical accounts for the existence of an organism’s features, and (ii) explaining the function or ‘goal-directedness’ of living beings. In contrast, proximate causes (e.g. [[physiology]]) were seen as explaining how biological systems work. According to Mayr, the evolutionary sciences study ultimate causes and the rest of biology studies proximate causes. In some of his works, Mayr considered these domains autonomous:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The clarification of the biochemical mechanism by which the genetic program is translated into the phenotype tells us absolutely nothing about the steps by which natural selection has built up the particular genetic program.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mayr, 1980&lt;ref name="Mayr1980"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mayr|first1=E|editor1-last=Mayr|editor1-first=E|editor2-last=Provine|editor2-first=WB|title=The Evolutionary Synthesis|date=1980|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, USA|pages=1-48|chapter=Some thoughts on the history of the evolutionary synthesis}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There has been widespread acceptance of the proximate-ultimate [[dichotomy]] within the evolutionary sciences. However, many biologists, psychologists and philosophers have taken issue with Mayr’s corollary that the [[Proximate and ultimate causation|proximate-ultimate distinction]] implies that development is irrelevant to evolution. For instance, evolutionary biologist Mary Jane West-Eberhard writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The proximate-ultimate distinction has given rise to a new confusion, namely, a belief that proximate causes of phenotypic variation have nothing to do with ultimate, evolutionary explanation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;West-Eberhard, 2003&lt;ref name="West-Eberhard2003" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Mayr’s position implied a unidirectional or linear conception of causation for both development and evolution: [[genotypes]] cause [[phenotypes]] (proximate causation), whilst through natural selection, changes in [[Environment (biophysical)|environments]] cause changes in [[organisms]] (ultimate causation). Reciprocal causation was proposed as an alternative to this linear characterization.&lt;ref name="Oyama2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Laland2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Laland2013b" /&gt; (see also &lt;ref name="West-Eberhard2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Waddington1957"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Waddington|first1=CH|title=The Strategy of the Genes|date=1957|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dewsbury1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dewsbury|first1=D|title=The proximate and the ultimate: past, present, and future|journal=Behav Process|date=1999|volume=46|pages=189-199}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thierry2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thierry|first1=B|title=Integrating proximate and ultimate causation: just one more go!|journal=Curr Sci|date=2005|volume=89|pages=1180-1183}}&lt;/ref&gt;) It emphasizes how causation cycles through biological systems recursively, allowing proximate causes to feed back and thereby feature in ultimate explanations. 

==Reciprocal causation in evolutionary biology==
Reciprocal causation features in several explanations within contemporary [[evolutionary biology]], including [[sexual selection]] theory, [[coevolution]], habitat selection, and [[frequency-dependent selection]]. In these examples, the source of selection on a trait coevolves with the trait itself, therefore causation is reciprocal and developmental processes potentially become relevant to evolutionary accounts. For instance, a [[Peafowl|peacock]]’s tail evolves through mating preferences in peahens, and those preferences coevolve with the male trait. The ‘ultimate explanation’ for the male trait is the prior existence of female preferences, proximately manifest in differential peahen [[mate choice]] decisions, whilst the ‘ultimate explanation’ for the peahens’ mating preferences is the prior existence of variation in the peacock’s tail associated with fitness. This example illustrates how reciprocal causation is not a rejection of the proximate-ultimate distinction itself, but instead a rejection of the implication that developmental processes should not feature in evolutionary explanations.

Reciprocal causation also applies in other domains of evolutionary biology. The [[extended evolutionary synthesis]] emphasizes how developmental events, including both the causal effects of environments on organisms (for instance, arising through developmental [[Phenotypic plasticity|plasticity]], or [[epigenetic inheritance]]) and the causal effects of organisms on environments (e.g. [[niche construction]]), can direct the course of evolution. Developmental plasticity, niche construction, extra-genetic forms of inheritance and developmental bias are recognized as playing evolutionary roles that cannot be reduced to [[natural selection]] of genetically encoded characters or strategies. Proximate causes are not autonomous from natural selection, but rather feed back to influence the rate and direction of [[adaptive evolution]]. This goes beyond the recognition that [[Ontogeny|ontogenetic processes]] can impose constraints on the action of selection, or that proximate and ultimate processes interact. Rather, developmental processes are also seen as a source of evolutionary novelty, initiators of evolutionary episodes, and co-directors of patterns of evolutionary change.&lt;ref name="Laland2015" /&gt;

==Contention==
Acceptance or rejection of Mayr’s proximate-ultimate distinction may lie at the centre of several major debates within contemporary biology, concerning [[Evolutionary developmental biology|evo devo (evolutionary developmental biology)]], [[niche construction]], [[cultural evolution]], human cooperation, and the [[Origin of language|evolution of language]]. According to some biologists and philosophers, these disputes share a common pattern. On one side are researchers who consider that interaction and feedback processes traditionally characterized as ‘proximate’ have explanatory value for ‘ultimate’ evolutionary questions.&lt;ref name="Oyama2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="West-Eberhard2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Laland2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Laland2013b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dewsbury1999" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Thierry2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Laland2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Laland|first1=KN|last2=Uller|first2=T|last3=Feldman|first3=MW|last4=Sterelny|first4=K|last5=Müller|first5=GB|last6=Moczek|first6=A|last7=Jablonka|first7=E|last8=Odling-Smee|first8=FJ|last9=Wray|first9=GA|last10=Hoekstra|first10=HE|last11=Futuyma|first11=DJ|last12=Lenski|first12=RE|last13=Mackay|first13=TFC|last14=Schluter|first14=D|last15=Strassmann|first15=JE|title=Does evolutionary theory need a rethink?|journal=Nature|date=2014|volume=514|pages=161-164|bibcode=2014Natur.514..161L|doi=10.1038/514161a}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their concern is that the proximate-ultimate distinction has discouraged consideration of the manner in which developmental processes can set the evolutionary agenda, for instance, by introducing innovations, channeling phenotypic variation, or initiating evolutionary episodes through modifying selection pressures. One the other side are researchers who largely adopt Mayr’s stance with a clean separation of proximate and ultimate causation. For the latter, a failure to respect Mayr’s dichotomy is considered a sign of confusing an evolutionary explanation with a mechanistic explanation.&lt;ref name="Dawkins2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dawkins|first1=R|title=Extended phenotype—but not too extended.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17206">{{short description|Using wastes as an input material to create valuable products as new outputs}}
'''Resource recovery''' is using [[waste]]s as an input material to create valuable products as new outputs. The aim is to reduce the amount of waste generated, therefore reducing the need for [[landfill]] space and also extracting maximum value from waste. Resource recovery delays the need to use [[raw material]]s in the manufacturing process. Materials found in [[municipal solid waste]] can be used to make new products. [[Plastic]], [[paper]], [[aluminium]], [[glass]] and [[metal]] are examples of where value can be found in waste.

Resource recovery goes further than just the [[Waste management|management of waste]]. [[life cycle analysis|Life-cycle analysis]] (LCA) can be used to compare the resource recovery potential of different treatment technologies. Improvements to administration, [[Source separation (recycling)|source separation]] and collection, [[reuse]] and [[recycling]] are important. For example, organic materials can be treated with [[anaerobic digestion]] and turned into energy, [[compost]] or [[fertilizer]].

Resource recovery can also be an aim in the context of [[sanitation]]. Here, the term refers to approaches to recover the resources that are contained in [[wastewater]] and [[human excreta]] (urine and feces). The term "toilet resources" has come into use recently.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.toiletboard.org/sanitation-economy|title="The Sanitation Economy"|last=|first=|date=26 March 2018|website=Toilet Board Coalition|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those resources include: nutrients ([[nitrogen]] and [[phosphorus]]), organic matter, energy and water. This concept is also referred to as [[ecological sanitation]]. Separation of waste flows can help make resource recovery simpler. Examples include keeping urine separate from feces (as in [[urine diversion]] toilets) and keeping [[greywater]] and [[Blackwater (waste)|blackwater]] separate in municipal wastewater systems.

== Materials used as a source ==

===Solid waste===
{{main|Recycling}}
[[Image:Steel recycling bales.jpg|thumb|right|Steel crushed and baled for [[recycling]]]]
Recycling is a resource recovery practice that refers to the collection and reuse of disposed materials such as empty beverage containers. The materials from which the items are made can be reprocessed into new products. Material for recycling may be collected separately from general waste using dedicated bins and collection vehicles, or sorted directly from mixed waste streams.

The most common consumer products recycled include [[aluminium]] such as beverage cans, [[copper]] such as wire, [[steel]] food and aerosol cans, old steel furnishings or equipment, [[HDPE|polyethylene]] and [[Recycling of PET Bottles|PET]] bottles, [[glass]] bottles and jars, [[paperboard]] [[cartons]], [[newspapers]], magazines and light paper, and [[corrugated fiberboard]] boxes.

[[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]], [[LDPE]], [[Polypropylene|PP]], and [[Polystyrene|PS]] (see [[resin identification code]]) are also recyclable. These items are usually composed of a single type of material, making them relatively easy to recycle into new products. The recycling of complex products (such as computers and electronic equipment) is more difficult, due to the additional dismantling and separation required.

The type of recycling material accepted varies by city and country. Each city and country have different recycling programs in place that can handle the various types of recyclable materials.

===Wastewater and excreta===
{{main|Reuse of excreta|Wastewater reuse|Ecological sanitation}}
Valuable resources can be recovered from [[wastewater]], [[sewage sludge]], [[Fecal sludge management|fecal sludge]] and [[Human waste|human excreta]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/publications/other-publication-types/books-monographs/iwmi-jointly-published/resource-recovery-from-waste/|title=Resource recovery from waste: business models for energy, nutrient and water reuse in low- and middle-income countries|last=Otoo|first=Miriam|last2=Drechsel|first2=Pay|publisher=Routledge - Earthscan|year=2018|isbn=|location=Oxon, UK|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include water, energy, and fertilizing nutrients [[nitrogen]], [[phosphorus]], [[potassium]], as well as micro-nutrients such as [[sulphur]] and [[organic matter]]. There is also increasing interest for recovering other raw materials from wastewater, such as [[bioplastic]]s and metals such as silver.&lt;ref&gt;Dutch Association of Regional Water Authorities. 2013. [https://www.uvw.nl/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/362awk-VisionBrochure-AWK_def.pdf Vision brochure: Wastewater management roadmap towards 2030].&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, wastewater systems were designed only to remove excreta and wastewater from urban areas. Water was used to flush away the waste, often discharging into nearby waterbodies. Since the 1970s, there has been increasing interest in treating the wastewater to protect the environment, and efforts focused primarily on cleaning the water at the end of the pipe.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Since around the year 2003, the concepts of [[ecological sanitation]] and [[sustainable sanitation]] have emerged with the focus on recovering resources from wastewater.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} As of 2016, the term "toilet resources" came into use, and encouraged more attention to the potential for resource recovery from toilets.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The following resources can be recovered: 
*Water: In many water-scarce areas there are increasing pressures to recover water from wastewater.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 2006, the [[World Health Organization]], in collaboration with the [[Food and Agriculture Organization|Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] (FAO) and the [[United Nations Environment Programme|United Nations Environment Program]] (UNEP), developed guidelines for safe use of wastewater.&lt;ref&gt;WHO (2006). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/1004 WHO Guidelines for the Safe Use of Wastewater, Excreta and Greywater - Volume IV: Excreta and greywater use in agriculture]. World Health Organization (WHO), Geneva, Switzerland&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, many national governments have their own regulations regarding the use of recovered water.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Singapore for example aims to recover enough water from its wastewater systems to meet the water needs of half the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dw.com/en/singapores-toilet-to-tap-concept/a-16904636|title=Singapore's 'toilet to tap' concept|last=|first=|date=2013-06-25|work=Deutsche Welle|access-date=2017-11-27|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They call this [[NEWater]]. Another related concept for wastewater reuse is [[sewer mining]].
*Energy: The production of [[biogas]] from [[Sewage sludge|wastewater sludge]] is now common practice at [[Wastewater treatment|wastewater treatment plants]]. In addition, a number for methods have been researched regarding use of wastewater sludge and excreta as fuel sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.eawag.ch/fileadmin/Domain1/Abteilungen/sandec/publikationen/EWM/Treatment_Objectives/Production_Pellets_and_Electricity_from_FS.pdf|title=Production of Pellets and Electricity from Faecal Sludge|last=|first=|date=2015|work=SANDEC NEWS|access-date=2017-11-27|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Fertilizing nutrients: Human excreta contains nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and other micronutrients that are needed for agricultural production. These can be recovered through [[Precipitation (chemistry)|chemical precipitation]] or stripping processes, or simply by use of the wastewater or [[sewage sludge]]. However, reuse of sewage sludge poses risks due to high concentrations of undesirable compounds, such as [[heavy metals]], [[environmental persistent pharmaceutical pollutant]]s and other chemicals.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Since the majority of fertilizing nutrients are found in excreta, it can be useful to separate the excreta fractions of wastewater (e.g. toilet waste) from the rest of the wastewater flows.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.se/books?id=juicry4LaRgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Source Separation and Decentralization for Wastewater Management|last=Larsen|first=Tove A.|last2=Udert|first2=Kai M.|last3=Lienert|first3=Judit|date=2013-02-01|publisher=IWA Publishing|isbn=9781843393481|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reduces the risk for undesirable compounds and reduces the volume that needs to be treated before applying recovered nutrients in agricultural production.

Other methods are also being developed for transforming wastewater into valuable products. Growing [[Hermetia illucens|Black Soldier Flies]] in excreta or organic waste can produce fly larvae as a protein feed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lalander|first=Cecilia|last2=Diener|first2=Stefan|last3=Magri|first3=Maria Elisa|last4=Zurbrügg|first4=Christian|last5=Lindström|first5=Anders|last6=Vinnerås|first6=Björn|title=Faecal sludge management with the larvae of the black soldier fly (Hermetia illucens) — From a hygiene aspect|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0048969713004555|journal=Science of the Total Environment|volume=458-460|pages=312–318|doi=10.1016/j.scitotenv.2013.04.033}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers are harvesting [[fatty acid]]s from wastewater to make bioplastics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wateronline.com/doc/revolutionary-tech-makes-plastic-from-wastewater-0001|title='Revolutionary' Tech Makes Plastic From Wastewater|last=|first=|date=2015-04-07|work=Water Online|access-date=2017-11-27|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organic matter===
{{main|Composting|Home composting|Anaerobic digestion|Microbial fuel cell}}
[[Image:Compost Heap.jpg|thumb|right|An active [[compost]] heap.]]
Disposed materials that are organic in nature, such as plant material, food scraps, and paper products, can be recycled using biological composting and digestion processes to [[decompose]] the organic matter. The resulting organic material is then recycled as [[mulch]] or [[compost]] for agricultural or landscaping purposes. In addition, waste gas from the process (such as [[methane]]) can be captured and used for generating electricity and heat (CHP/[[cogeneration]]) maximising efficiencies. The intention of biological processing is to control and accelerate the natural process of decomposition of organic matter.

There is a large variety of composting and digestion methods and technologies varying in complexity from simple home compost heaps, to small town scale batch digesters, industrial-scale enclosed-vessel digestion of mixed domestic waste (see [[mechanical biological treatment]]). Methods of biological decomposition are differentiated as being [[Aerobic decomposition|aerobic]] or [[Anaerobic digestion|anaerobic]] methods, though hybrids of the two methods also exist.

Anaerobic digestion of the organic fraction of [[municipal solid waste]] (MSW) has been found to be more environmentally effective, than landfill, incineration or [[pyrolysis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idosi.org/gjer/gjer3(3)09/4.pdf Life Cycle Environmental Assessment of Municipal Solid Waste to Energy Technologies]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurojournals.com/ejsr_34_3_11.pdf Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of Municipal Solid Waste Management in the State of Kuwait]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Life-cycle assessment|Life cycle analysis]] (LCA) was used to compare different technologies. The resulting biogas (methane) though must be used for cogeneration (electricity and heat preferably on or close to the site of production) and can be used with a little upgrading in gas combustion engines or turbines. With further upgrading to synthetic natural gas it can be injected into the natural gas network or further refined to [[hydrogen]] for use in stationary cogeneration fuel cells. Its use in fuel cells eliminates the pollution from products of combustion. There is a large variety of composting and digestion methods and technologies varying in complexity from simple home compost heaps, to small town scale batch digesters, industrial-scale, enclosed-vessel digestion of mixed domestic waste (see [[mechanical biological treatment]]). Methods of biological decomposition are differentiated as being [[Aerobic decomposition|aerobic]] or [[Anaerobic digestion|anaerobic]] methods, though hybrids of the two methods also exist.

==Recovery methods==
In many countries, source-separated [[curbside collection]] is one method of resource recovery.

=== Australia ===
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}
In Australia, every urban domestic household is provided with three bins: one for [[recycling]]; another for general waste; and another for garden materials, this bin is provided by the municipality if requested. To encourage recycling, municipalities provide large recycle bins, which are larger than general waste bins. Many American localities have [[dual-stream recycling]], with paper collected in bags or boxes and all other materials in a recycling bin. In either case, the recovered materials are trucked to a [[materials recovery facility]] for further processing.

Municipal, commercial and industrial, construction and demolition debris is dumped at landfills and some is recycled. Household disposal materials are segregated: recyclables sorted and made into new products, and unusable material is dumped in landfill areas. According to the [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]] (ABS), the recycling rate is high and is "increasing, with 99% of households reporting that they had recycled or reused within the past year (2003 survey), up from 85% in 1992". In 2002–03 "30% of materials from municipalities, 45% from commercial and industrial generators and 57% from construction and demolition debris" was recycled. Energy is produced is part of resource recovery as well: some [[landfill gas]] is captured for fuel or electricity generation, although this is considered the last resort, as the point of resource recovery is avoidance of landfill disposal altogether.

==Sustainability==
Resource recovery is a key component in a business' ability to maintaining [[ISO14001]] accreditation. Companies are encouraged to improve their environmental efficiencies each year. One way to do this is by changing a company from a system of managing wastes to a resource recovery system (such as recycling: glass, food waste, paper and cardboard, plastic bottles etc.)

[[Education]] and [[awareness]] in the area of  resource recovery is increasingly important from a global perspective of [[resource management]]. The [[Talloires Declaration]] is a declaration for [[sustainability]] concerned about the unprecedented scale and speed of environmental [[pollution]] and [[Chemical decomposition|degradation]], and the [[Resource depletion|depletion]] of [[natural resources]]. Local, regional, and global [[air]] pollution; accumulation and distribution of toxic wastes; destruction and depletion of forests, [[soil]], and [[water]]; depletion of the [[ozone layer]] and emission of "green house" gases threaten the survival of humans and thousands of other living species, the integrity of the earth and its [[biodiversity]], the security of nations, and the heritage of future generations. Several universities have implemented the Talloires Declaration by establishing [[environmental management]] and resource recovery programs. [[University]] and [[vocational]] education are promoted by various organizations, e.g., [[WAMITAB]] and [[Chartered Institution of Wastes Management]]. Many supermarkets encourage customers to use their [[reverse vending machines]] to deposit used purchased containers and receive a refund from the recycling fees. Brands that manufacture such machines include [[Tomra]] and [[Envipco]].

In 2010, CNBC aired the documentary ''[[Trash Inc: The Secret Life of Garbage]]'' about waste, what happens to it when it's "thrown away", and its impact on the world.&lt;ref name=lat&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-secret-garbage-20100929,0,2134032.story Television review: 'Trash Inc.'], [[Susan Carpenter]], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', 29 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extended producer responsibility===
[[Extended producer responsibility]] (EPR) is a  pricing strategy that promotes integrating all costs associated with a given product throughout its life cycle. Having the market price also reflect the "end-of-life disposal costs" encourages more accuracy in pricing. Extended producer responsibility is meant to impose accountability over the entire lifecycle of products, from production, to packaging, to transport and disposal or reuse. EPR requires firms that manufacture, import and/or sell products to be responsible for those products throughout the life and disposal or reuse of products.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="93507">The '''right to be forgotten''' is a concept that has been discussed and put into practice both in the [[European Union]] (EU) and, since 2006, in [[Argentina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/20/technology/internet/20google.html?_r=0|newspaper=New York Times|title=Google and Yahoo Win Appeal in Argentine Case|first=Vinod|last=Sreeharsha}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=El derecho al olvido en Internet se deberá aplicar también en la Capital Federal|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1736360-el-derecho-al-olvido-en-internet-se-debera-aplicar-tambien-en-la-capital-federal|website=lanacion.com.ar}}&lt;/ref&gt; The issue has arisen from desires of individuals to "determine the development of their life in an autonomous way, without being perpetually or periodically [[stigmatize]]d as a consequence of a specific action performed in the past."&lt;ref name="mantelero"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mantelero |first=Alessandro |title=The EU Proposal for a General Data Protection Regulation and the roots of the 'right to be forgotten' |journal=Computer Law &amp; Security Review |volume=29 |issue=3 |year=2013 |pages=229–235 |doi=10.1016/j.clsr.2013.03.010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|231}}

There has been controversy about the practicality of establishing a right to be forgotten to the status of an international [[human rights|human right]] in respect to access to information, due in part to the vagueness of current rulings attempting to implement such a right.&lt;ref name="fleischer"&gt;{{cite web|first=Peter |last=Fleischer |url=http://peterfleischer.blogspot.co.nz/2011/03/foggy-thinking-about-right-to-oblivion.html |title=Peter Fleischer: Privacy...?: Foggy thinking about the Right to Oblivion |publisher=Peterfleischer.blogspot.co.nz |date=2011-03-09 |accessdate=2014-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, there are concerns about its impact on the right to [[freedom of expression]], its interaction with the [[right to privacy]], and whether creating a right to be forgotten would decrease the quality of the [[Internet]] through [[censorship]] and a [[historical revisionism (negationism)|rewriting of history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Tessa |last=Mayes |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/libertycentral/2011/mar/18/forgotten-online-european-union-law-internet |title=We have no right to be forgotten online |publisher=theguardian.com |date=2014-05-21 |accessdate=2014-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those in favour of the right to be forgotten cite its necessity due to issues such as [[revenge porn]] sites appearing in [[search engine]] listings for a person's name, as well as instances of these results referencing petty crimes individuals may have committed many years ago. The central concern here being, these results can unduly play a prominent role in a person's online presence almost indefinitely if not removed.&lt;ref name=Arthur/&gt;

==Conception and proposal==
Europe's data protection legislation are intended to secure potentially damaging, private information about individuals. The notion of "the right to be forgotten" is derived from numerous preexisting European ideas. There is a longstanding belief in the United Kingdom, specifically under the [[Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974|Rehabilitation of Offenders Act]], that after a certain period of time, many criminal convictions are "spent", meaning that information regarding said person should not be regarded when obtaining insurance or seeking employment. Similarly, France values this right - le droit à l'oubli (the right to be forgotten).&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/may/14/explainer-right-to-be-forgotten-the-newest-cultural-shibboleth|title=Explaining the 'right to be forgotten' – the newest cultural shibboleth|author=Charles Arthur|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was officially recognized in French Law in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |year=2010 |title=Charte sur la publicité ciblée et la protection des internautes |trans-title=Code of Good Practice on Targeted Advertising and the Protection of Internet Users |publisher=Secrétariat d'Etat chargé de la Prospective et du Développement de l'économie numérique |url=http://www.huntonfiles.com/files/webupload/PrivacyLaw_Charte_publicite.pdf |format=PDF |language=FR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Views on the right to be forgotten differ greatly between America and EU countries. In America, transparency, the right of free speech according to the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], and the right to know have typically been favored over the obliteration of truthfully published information regarding individuals and corporations. The term "right to be forgotten" is a relatively new idea, though on May 13, 2014, the European Court of Justice legally solidified that the "right to be forgotten" is a human right when they ruled against Google in the ''[[Google v González|Costeja]]'' case.

In 1995, the [[European Union]] adopted the [[Data Protection Directive|European Data Protection Directive]] (Directive 95/46/EC) to regulate the processing of personal data.&lt;ref&gt;Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data. EU Directive 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; This is now considered a component of [[human rights law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mitrou |first=Lilian |first2=Maria |last2=Karyda |title=EU's Data Protection Reform and the right to be forgotten—A legal response to a technological challenge? |work=5th International Conference of Information Law and Ethics |year=2012 |pages=29–30 |ssrn=2165245 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new European Proposal for [[General Data Protection Regulation]] provides protection and exemption for companies listed as "media" companies, like newspapers and other journalistic work. However, Google purposely opted out of being classified as a "media" company and so is not protected. Judges in the European Union ruled that because the international corporation, Google, is a collector and processor of data it should be classified as a "data controller" under the meaning of the EU data protection directive. These "data controllers" are required under EU law to remove data that is "inadequate, irrelevant, or no longer relevant", making this directive of global importance.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

==Current legal frameworks==
The right to be forgotten "reflects the claim of an individual to have certain data deleted so that third persons can no longer trace them."&lt;ref name="weber"&gt;Weber, Rolf H. "The right to be forgotten." More than a Pandora's Box 2 (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|121}} It has been defined as "the right to silence on past events in life that are no longer occurring."&lt;ref&gt;Pino, G. (2000). "The right to personal identity in Italian private law: Constitutional interpretation and judge-made rights". In: M. Van Hoecke; F. Ost (eds.). The harmonization of private law in Europe (pp. 225-237). Oxford: Hart Publishing. p. 237.&lt;/ref&gt; The right to be forgotten leads to allowing individuals to have information, videos or photographs about themselves deleted from certain internet records so that they cannot be found by search engines.&lt;ref name="weber"/&gt;

The right to be forgotten is distinct from the [[right to privacy]], due to the distinction that the right to privacy constitutes information that is not publicly known, whereas the right to be forgotten involves removing information that was publicly known at a certain time and not allowing third parties to access the information.&lt;ref name="weber"/&gt;{{rp|122}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=L.

Limitations of application in a [[jurisdiction]] include the inability to require removal of information held by companies outside the jurisdiction. There is no global framework to allow individuals control over their online image. However, Professor Viktor Mayer-Schönberger, an expert from Oxford Internet Institute, University of Oxford, said that Google can not escape compliance with the law of France implementing the decision of the European Court of Justice in 2014 on the right to be forgotten. Mayer-Schönberger said nations, including the US, had long maintained that their local laws have "extra-territorial effects".&lt;ref&gt;(September 23, 2015)[http://en.yibada.com/articles/66331/20150922/expert-google-escape-french-law-right-forgotten.htm?exe=reporter Expert: Google Can Not Escape French Law on Right to Delist].

===European Union===
In Article 12 of the Directive 95/46/EC the EU gave a legal base to internet protection for individuals.&lt;ref name="mantelero"/&gt;{{rp|233}} In 2012 the [[European Commission]] disclosed a draft European Data Protection Regulation to supersede the directive, which includes specific protection in the right to be forgotten in Article 17.&lt;ref&gt;European Commission. Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the Protection of Individuals with Regard to the Processing of Personal Data and On the Free Movement of Such Data ([[General Data Protection Regulation]]). 2012/0011 (COD). Article 17. Right to be forgotten and To Erasure&lt;/ref&gt;

To exercise the right to be forgotten and request removal from a search engine, one must complete a form through the search engine's website. [[Google]]'s removal request process requires the applicant to identify their country of residence, personal information, a list of the URLs to be removed along with a short description of each one, and attachment of legal identification.&lt;ref&gt;https://support.google.com/legal/contact/lr_eudpa?product=websearch&lt;/ref&gt; The applicant receives an email from Google confirming the request but the request must be assessed before it is approved for removal. If the request is approved, searches using the individual's name will no longer result in the content appearing in search results. The content remains online and is not erased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://searchengineland.com/google-right-to-be-forgotten-form-192837|title=How Google's New "Right To Be Forgotten" Form Works: An Explainer|date=30 May 2014|work=Search Engine Land}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a request is filled, their removals team reviews the request, weighing "the individual's right to privacy against the public's right to know", deciding if the website is "inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant, or excessive in relation to the purposes for which they were processed".&lt;ref name=Brindle&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brindle|first1=Beth|title=How can Google forget you?|url=http://computer.howstuffworks.com/how-can-google-forget-you.htm|website=How Stuff Works|accessdate=22 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Google has formed an Advisory Council of various professors, lawyers, and government officials from around Europe to provide guidelines for these decisions.&lt;ref name="Powles and Chaparro"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Powles|first1=Julia|last2=Chaparro|first2=Enrique|title=How Google determined our right to be forgotten|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/feb/18/the-right-be-forgotten-google-search|accessdate=22 May 2015|publisher=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the review process is still a mystery to the general public. Guidelines set by EU regulators were not released until November 2014, but Google began to take action on this much sooner than that, which (according to one author) allowed them "to shape interpretation to [their] own ends".&lt;ref name="Powles and Chaparro" /&gt; In May 2015, eighty academics called for more transparency from Google, in an open letter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/may/14/dear-google-open-letter-from-80-academics-on-right-to-be-forgotten|title = Dear Google: open letter from 80 academics on 'right to be forgotten'|website = The Guardian|last = Kiss|first = Jemima}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The form asks people to select one of the twenty-eight countries that make up the European Union, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Search Removal Request Under Data Protection Law in Europe|url=https://support.google.com/legal/contact/lr_eudpa?product=websearch|website=Google|accessdate=22 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The form allows an individual or someone representing an individual to put in a request" for the removal of any URLs believed to be a violation of the individual's privacy.&lt;ref name= "Sullivan D"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sullivan|first1=Danny|title=How Google's New 'Right to be Forgotten' Form Works: An Explainer|url=http://searchengineland.com/google-right-to-be-forgotten-form-192837|accessdate=22 May 2015|publisher=Search Engine Land|date=30 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of who is submitting the form, some form of photo identification of the person the form is being submitted for must be presented. The purpose of this is to provide proof that the person for whom the request is being made does in fact approve.
 
The form allows people to submit the name they would like search results removed for. However, it only allows for the submission of one name, which some view as one of its flaws.&lt;ref name= "Sullivan D" /&gt; For example, if someone known as both "Lawrence Smith" and "Larry Smith" were to submit a form for the removal of search results for his name, he would only be allowed to indicate one of these names on the form.&lt;ref name= "Sullivan D" /&gt; Many people view it as inconvenient and believe it is a problem that Google should be able to easily fix.&lt;ref name= "Sullivan D" /&gt;

If Google refuses a request to delink material, Europeans can appeal to their local data protection agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jun/26/google-removing-right-to-be-forgotten-links|title = Google removing 'right to be forgotten' search links in Europe|website = The Guardian|last = Arthur|first = Charles}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of May 2015, the British Data Protection Agency had treated 184 such complaints, and overturned Google's decision in about a quarter of those.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/05/14/ico_google_clash_right_to_be_forgotten/|title = 'Right to be forgotten' festers as ICO and Google come to blows|website = The Register|last = Martin|first = Alexander J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; If Google objects to a Data Protection Agency decision, it can face legal action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/technology/internet/article4438460.ece|title = Google could face legal action over 'right to be forgotten' rejections|website = The Times|last = Dean|first = James}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2014, in the early stages of Google's effort to comply with the court ruling, legal experts questioned whether Google's widely publicised delistings of a number of news articles violated the UK and EU [[Data Protection Directive]], since in implementing the Directive, Google is required to weigh the damage to the person making the request against any public interest in the information being available.&lt;ref name="whydoit"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/07/04/google_peston_bbc_delisting_not_compliant_w_public_interest_law_says_expert/ |title=Google de-listing of BBC article 'broke UK and Euro public interest laws' - So WHY do it? |last1=Orlowski |first1=Andrew |date=4 July 2014 |website=www.theregister.co.uk |publisher=The Register |accessdate=4 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google indeed acknowledged that some of its search result removals, affecting articles that were of public interest, were incorrect, and reinstated the links a week later.&lt;ref name="Arthur"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jul/04/what-is-google-deleting-under-the-right-to-be-forgotten-and-why|last=Arthur|first=Charles|title=What is Google deleting under the 'right to be forgotten' - and why?

Google notifies websites that have URLs delinked, and the BBC and other news organizations have published lists of delinked articles. Complainants have been named in news commentary regarding those delinkings. In August 2015 the British Data Protection Agency issued an enforcement action requiring Google to delink some of these more recent articles from searches for a complainant's name, after Google refused to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/aug/20/google-ordered-to-remove-links-to-stories-about-right-to-be-forgotten-removals|title = Google ordered to remove links to 'right to be forgotten' removal stories|website = The Guardian|last = Gibbs|first = Samuel}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google complied with the request.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some academics have criticized news organizations and Google for their behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/01/bbc-wrong-right-to-be-forgotten|title = Why the BBC is wrong to republish 'right to be forgotten' links|website = The Guardian|last = Powles|first = Julia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://theconversation.com/privacy-watchdog-takes-first-step-against-those-undermining-right-to-be-forgotten-46495|title = Privacy watchdog takes first step against those undermining right to be forgotten|website = The Conversation|last = Boiten|first = Eerke}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of May 2014, Google has removed 1,390,838 URLs.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; From a gathering of which websites had the most amount of links removed, Facebook won with a total of 11,973 URLs removed. [[YouTube]] had 5,999 removed, [[Google Groups]] had 7,246 removed, and [[Twitter]] had 4,588 removed.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Though Facebook had the largest number of deleted URLs, there were other received requests that were not granted deletion. While Google does evaluate millions of URLs that have been requested to be removed, the ultimate decision must be made by a human "because the variables, including public interest claims, needs to be handled on a case-by-case basis".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, it is to be kept in mind that internet users can still find removed information somewhat easily, just not through European Google search engines.

In July 2015, Google accidentally revealed data on delinkings that "shows 95% of Google privacy requests are from citizens out to protect personal and private information – not criminals, politicians and public figures."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/14/google-accidentally-reveals-right-to-be-forgotten-requests|title = Google accidentally reveals data on 'right to be forgotten' requests|website = The Guardian|last = Tippmann|first = Sylvia|first2 = Julia|last2 = Powles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This data leak caused serious social consequences for Google as the public expressed their outrage and fear over the information that was recently made public. Though only 5% of requests were made by criminals, politicians, and public figures, the content removed was what sparked the most fear.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, one request for data removal was from a British doctor requesting to have 50 links removed on past botched medical procedures. Google agreed to remove three search results containing his personal information.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The public voiced their outrage stating that removing such information can be used for manipulation and could lead to innocent people making uninformed decisions. Google responded to the public outrage by saying that when removing content they consider both the right of the individual and public interest.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The European Union has been pushing for the delinkings requested by EU citizens to be implemented by Google not just in European versions of Google (as in google.co.uk, google.fr, etc.), but on google.com and other international subdomains. Regulators want delinkings to be implemented so that the law cannot be circumvented in any way. Google has refused the French Data Protection Agency's demand to apply the right internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/30/google-rejects-france-expand-right-to-be-forgotten-worldwide|title = Google says non to French demand to expand right to be forgotten worldwide|website = The Guardian|last = Hern|first = Alex}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due in part to their refusal to comply with the recommendation of the privacy regulating board Google has become the subject of a four-year-long antitrust investigation by the European Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/eu-wants-right-to-be-forgotten-applied-globally/|title=EU wants 'right to be forgotten' applied globally|publisher=CBS Interactive|work=CNET}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2015, the French Data Protection Agency dismissed Google's appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/sep/21/french-google-right-to-be-forgotten-appeal|title = French data regulator rejects Google's right-to-be-forgotten appeal|date = 21 September 2015|accessdate = 23 September 2015|website = The Guardian|last = Gibbs|first = Samuel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of September 2015, the most delinked site is ''www.facebook.com''. Three of Google's own sites, ''groups.google.com'', ''plus.google.com'' and ''www.youtube.com'' are among the ten most delinked sites.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.google.com/transparencyreport/removals/europeprivacy/?hl=en|title = Transparency Report.

In May 2014, the [[European Court of Justice]] ruled against [[Google]] in ''[[Google v González|Costeja]]'', a case brought by a Spanish man, Mario Costeja González, who requested the removal of a link to a digitized 1998 article in ''La Vanguardia'' newspaper about an auction for his foreclosed home, for a debt that he had subsequently paid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2014-05/15/google-vs-spain | title=What we can salvage from 'right to be forgotten' ruling | publisher=Wired.co.uk | date=15 May 2014 | accessdate=16 May 2014 | author=Julia Powles}}&lt;/ref&gt; He initially attempted to have the article removed by complaining to the [[Spanish Agency of data protection]], which rejected the claim on the grounds that it was lawful and accurate, but accepted a complaint against Google and asked Google to remove the results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Solon|first=Olivia|title=People have the right to be forgotten, rules EU court|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2014-05/13/right-to-be-forgotten-ruling|work=Wired.co.uk|publisher=Conde Nast Digital|accessdate=13 May 2014|date=13 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google sued in the [[Audiencia Nacional (Spain)|Spanish ''Audiencia Nacional'']] (National High Court) which referred a series of questions to the European Court of Justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |author=[[European Court of Justice]] |title=Judgment of the Court of Justice in Case C-131/12: An internet search engine operator is responsible for the processing that it carries out of personal data which appear on web pages published by third parties |url=http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/P_127116/ |location=Luxembourg |publisher= |agency= |date=13 May 2014 |accessdate=13 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court ruled in ''Costeja'' that search engines are responsible for the content they point to and thus, Google was required to comply with EU data privacy laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EU court backs 'right to be forgotten' in Google case|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-27388289|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=13 May 2014|date=13 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EU court rules Google must tweak search results in test of 'right to be forgotten'|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/eu-court-google-must-tweak-search-results-right-to-be-forgotten/|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=13 May 2014|date=13 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/14/technology/google-should-erase-web-links-to-some-personal-data-europes-highest-court-says.html |title=European Court Lets Users Erase Records on Web |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=13 May 2014|accessdate= 14 August 2014|author=David Streitfeld}}&lt;/ref&gt; On its first day of compliance only (May 30, 2014), Google received 12,000 requests to have personal details removed from its search engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Removal of Google personal information could become work intensive|url=http://www.europenews.net/index.php/sid/222490797/scat/88176adfdf246af5/ht/Removal-of-Google-personal-information-could-become-work-intensive|accessdate=2 June 2014|publisher=Europe News.Net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Virginia Simari, the judge in favor of De Cunha, stated that people have the right to control their image and avert others from "capturing, reproducing, broadcasting, or publishing one's image without permission."&lt;ref name="Carter"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://law.emory.edu/eilr/content/volume-27/issue-1/recent-developments/argentinas-right-to-be-forgotten.html|title=Argentina's Right to be Forgotten|last=Carter|first=Edward|date=|website=Emory International Law Review|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Simari used a treatise written by Julio César Rivera, a Buenos Aires lawyer, author, and law professor  "the right to control one's personal data includes the right to prevent others from using one's image."&lt;ref name="Carter"/&gt; Since the 1990s Argentina has also been a part of the habeas data movement in which they "adopted a constitutional provision that is part freedom-of-government-information law and part data privacy law."&lt;ref name="Carter"/&gt; However, their version is known as amparo. Article 43&lt;ref name="Carter"/&gt; explains the version:

"Any person shall file this action to obtain information on the data about himself and their purpose, registered in public records or databases, or in private ones intended to supply information; and in case of false data or discrimination, this action may be filed to request the suppression, rectification, confidentiality or updating of said data."&lt;ref name="Carter"/&gt;

Argentina's efforts to protect their people's right to be forgotten has been called 'the most complete' because individuals are able to correct, delete, or update information about themselves. Overall, their information is bound to remain confidential.

===United States===
Consideration of the right to be forgotten can be seen in US case law, specifically in ''Melvin v. Reid'', and in ''Sidis v. FR Publishing Corp.''&lt;ref&gt;Melvin v. Reid, 112 Cal.App. 285, 297 P. 91 (1931); Sidis v F-R Publishing Corporation 311 U.S. 711 61 S. Ct. 393 85 L. Ed. 462 1940 U.S.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Melvin v. Reid'' (1931), an ex-prostitute was charged with murder and then acquitted; she subsequently tried to assume a quiet and anonymous place in society. However, the 1925 film ''[[The Red Kimono]]'' revealed her history, and she successfully sued the producer.&lt;ref&gt;Melvin v. Reid, 112 Cal.App. 285, 297 P. 91 (1931)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=The Red {{sic|Kimono}}: The Saga of Gabriel Darley Melvin |last=Friedman |first=Lawrence Meir |title=Guarding Life's Dark Secrets: Legal and Social Controls over Reputation, Propriety, and Privacy |location= |publisher=Stanford University Press |edition= |year=2007 |pages=217–225 |isbn=978-0-8047-5739-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The court reasoned that "any person living a life of rectitude has that right to happiness which includes a freedom from unnecessary attacks on his character, social standing or reputation."&lt;ref&gt;Melvin v. Reid, 112 Cal.App. 285, 297 P. 91 (1931) at 852-853&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Sidis v. FR Publishing Corp.'' (1940), the plaintiff, [[William James Sidis]], was a former [[child prodigy]] who wished to spend his adult life quietly, without recognition; however, this was disrupted by an article in ''[[The New Yorker]]''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Sidis v F-R Publishing Corporation 311 U.S. 711 61 S. Ct. 393 85 L. Ed. 462 1940 U.S.&lt;/ref&gt; The court held here that there were limits to the right to control one's life and facts about oneself, and held that there is social value in published facts, and that a person cannot ignore their celebrity status merely because they want to.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

There is opposition to further recognition of the right to be forgotten in the United States as commentators argue that it will contravene the right to [[freedom of speech]] and freedom of expression, or will constitute [[censorship]], thus potentially breaching peoples' constitutionally protected right to freedom of expression in the [[United States Constitution]].&lt;ref name="theatlantic1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hendel |first=John |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/01/why-journalists-shouldnt-fear-europes-right-to-be-forgotten/251955/ |title=Why Journalists Shouldn't Fear Europe's 'Right to be Forgotten' |work=[[The Atlantic]] |date=2012-01-25 |accessdate=2014-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; These criticisms are consistent with the proposal that the only information that can be removed by user's request is content that they themselves uploaded.{{clarify|date=July 2017}}&lt;ref name="theatlantic1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="walker"&gt;Walker, Robert K.

In a June 2014 opinion piece in Forbes, columnist Joseph Steinberg noted that "many privacy protections that Americans believe that they enjoy – even some guaranteed by law – have, in fact, been eroded or even obliterated by technological advances." Steinberg, in explaining the need for legislation guaranteeing the "right to be forgotten", noted that existing laws that require adverse information to be removed from credit reports after a period of time, and that allow the sealing or expunging of criminals records, are effectively undermined by the ability of prospective lenders or employers to forever find the removed information in a matter of seconds by doing a web search.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/josephsteinberg/2014/06/02/your-privacy-is-now-at-risk-from-search-engines-even-if-the-law-says-otherwise/ |author=Joseph Steinberg |authorlink=Joseph Steinberg |title=Your Privacy Is Now At Risk From Search Engines -- Even If The Law Says Otherwise |publisher=Forbes |date=2014-06-02 |accessdate=2014-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 11, 2015, [[Intelligence Squared|Intelligence Squared US]], an organization that stages [[Debate#Oxford-style debating|Oxford-Style debates]], held an event centered on the question, "Should the U.S. adopt the 'Right to be Forgotten' online?" The side against the motion won with a 56% majority of the voting audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://intelligencesquaredus.org/debates/past-debates/item/1252-the-u-s-should-adopt-the-right-to-be-forgotten-online|title=The U.S. Should Adopt the 'Right to Be Forgotten' Online|work=intelligencesquaredus.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While opinions among experts are divided in the U.S., one survey indicated that 9 in 10 Americans want some form of the right to be forgotten.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.adweek.com/prnewser/hey-google-9-in-10-americans-want-the-right-to-be-forgotten/111218|title = Hey Google: 9 in 10 Americans Want the 'Right to Be Forgotten'|website = Adweek|last = Coffee|first = Patrick}}&lt;/ref&gt; The consumer rights organization [[Consumer Watchdog]] has filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission for Americans to obtain the right as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/consumer-watchdog-google-should-extend-right-be-forgotten-u-s-n388131|title = Consumer Watchdog: Google Should Extend 'Right To Be Forgotten' to U.S.|website = NBC News|last = Eng|first = James}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2017, [[State of New York|New York]] state senator [[Tony Avella]] and assemblyman [[David Weprin]] introduced a bill proposing that individuals be allowed to require search engines and online speakers to remove information that is "inaccurate", "irrelevant", "inadequate", or "excessive", that is "no longer material to current public debate or discourse" and is causing demonstrable harm to the subject.&lt;ref name="wp-nybill"&gt;{{cite web|title=N.Y. bill would require people to remove 'inaccurate,' 'irrelevant,' 'inadequate' or 'excessive' statements about others|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2017/03/15/n-y-bill-would-require-people-to-remove-inaccurate-irrelevant-inadequate-or-excessive-statements-about-others/|website=Washington Post|accessdate=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== India ===
In April 2016, the [[Delhi High Court]] began to examine the issue after a Delhi banker requested to have his personal details removed from search results following a marital dispute.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Delhi-banker-seeks-right-to-be-forgotten-online/articleshow/52060003.cms|title=Delhi banker seeks 'right to be forgotten' online - Times of India|website=The Times of India|access-date=2016-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, due to the dispute being settled, the banker's request is valid.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The High Court has asked for a reply from Google and other search engine companies by September 19, upon which the court will continue to investigate the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.catchnews.com/tech-news/what-is-the-right-to-be-forgotten-and-how-it-will-affect-you-1462532182.html|title=What is the Right to be Forgotten and how it could affect you?|website=CatchNews.com|access-date=2016-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017 the [[Karnataka High Court]] upheld the right to be forgotten, in a case involving a woman who originally went to court in order to get a marriage certificate annulled, claiming to have never been married to the man on the certificate.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.livelaw.in/first-indian-court-upholds-right-forgotten-read-order/|title=In A First An Indian Court Upholds The 'Right To Be Forgotten' [Read Order] {{!}} Live Law|date=2017-02-03|work=Live Law|access-date=2017-03-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the two parties came to an agreement, the woman's father wanted her name to be removed from search engines regarding criminal cases in the high court.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The Karnataka High Court approved the father's request, stating that she had a right to be forgotten. According to the court, its ruling would align with western countries' decisions, which typically approve of the right to be forgotten when dealing with cases "involving women in general and highly sensitive cases involving rape or affecting the modesty and reputation of the person concerned."&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  The woman in this specific case was worried that the search results would affect her standing with her husband, as well as her reputation in society.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

As of February 2017, the Delhi High Court is hearing a case involving a man requesting to have information regarding his mother and wife to be removed from a search engine.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.firstpost.com/india/right-to-be-forgotten-how-a-prudent-karnataka-hc-judgment-could-pave-the-way-for-privacy-laws-in-india-3270938.html|title=Right to be forgotten: How a prudent Karnataka HC judgment could pave the way for privacy laws in India|date=2017-02-07|work=Firstpost|access-date=2017-03-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The man believes that having his name linked to the search is hindering his employment options.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The Delhi High Court is still working on the case, along with the issue of whether or not a right to be forgotten should be a legal standard in India.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Currently, there is no legal standard for the right to be forgotten, but if implemented, this would mean that citizens no longer need to file a case in order to request for information from search engines to be removed.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; This case could have significant impacts on the right to be forgotten and search engines in India.

=== South Korea ===
In May 2016, [[Korea Communications Commission|South Korea's Korea Communications Commission]] (KCC) announced citizens will be able to request search engines and website administrators to restrict their own postings from being publicly accessible.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bna.com/south-korea-releases-n57982070847/|title=South Korea Releases Right to Be Forgotten Guidance|website=www.bna.com|access-date=2016-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The KCC released "[http://src.bna.com/eBy Guidelines on the Right to Request Access Restrictions on Personal Internet Postings]", which will take effect in June 2016, which will not apply to third party contents.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  To the extent that the right to be forgotten concerns a data subject's right to limit the searchability of third party postings about him/her, the Guideline does not constitute a right to be forgotten.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/economy/it/736858.html|title=방통위, '잊혀질 권리 가이드라인' 제정|date=2016-03-25|access-date=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, as to the right to withdraw one's own posting, critics have noted that people have been able to delete their own postings before the Guideline as long as they have retained their login credentials, and that people who have misplaced their login credentials were permitted to retrieve or receive new ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://byline.network/2016/04/1-94/|title=[심재석의 입장] 방통위의 이상한 '잊혀질 권리 가이드라인'|last=심재석|date=2016-04-01|website=BYLINE NETWORK|access-date=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The only services significantly affected by the Guideline are Wiki-type services where people's contributions make logical sense only in response to or in conjunction with one another's contributions and therefore the postings are made permanent part of the mass-created content, but KCC made sure that the Guideline applies to these services only when the posting identifies the authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2016/06/29/2016062902224.html|title='네이버 지식iN' 질문 글, 개인정보 남아 있을 때만 '잊혀질 권리' 적용|access-date=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The guidelines created by the KCC include that data subjects can remove content that includes the URL links, and any evidence consisting of personal information. The commission included different amendments to the guideline. This includes describing the Guidelines as a "minimum" and "preliminary"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bna.com/south-korea-releases-n57982070847/|title=South Korea Releases Right to Be Forgotten Guidance|last=Lim|first=James|date=|website=Bloomberg BNA|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; precaution regarding privacy rights in vague areas of existing laws. The guideline encompasses foreign Internet companies that provide translation services for South Korean consumers. In order to have a person's information "forgotten" he or she has to go through a three step process:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mondaq.com/x/561018/IT+internet/Korea+Communications+Commission+Releases+Guidelines+On+The+Right+To+Be+Forgotten|title=Korea Communications Commission Releases Guidelines On "The Right to Be Forgotten"|last=Yulchon LLC|first=|date=|website=Mondaq|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the issue posted with the URL, proof of ownership of the post, grounds for the request. There are restrictions on each step. When posting the URL, the web operator has the right to preserve the posting issue. The second being that if the post is relevant to public interest, web operators will process this request on the terms of relevance.

=== China ===
In May 2016, Chinese courts in Beijing determined citizens do not have the right to be forgotten when a judge ruled in favor of [[Baidu]] in a lawsuit over removing search results.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sixthtone.com/news/chinese-have-no-right-be-forgotten-court-rules|title=Chinese Have No Right to Be Forgotten, Court Rules|last=Tone|first=Sixth|date=2016-05-05|website=Sixth Tone|access-date=2016-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first of such cases to be heard in Chinese court.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In the suit, Ren Jiayu sued Chinese search engine Baidu over search results that associated him with a previous employer, Wuxi Taoshi Biotechnology.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Ren argued that by posting the search results, Baidu had infringed upon his right of name and right of reputation, both protected under Chinese law.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Because of these protections, Ren believed he had a right to be forgotten by removing these search results.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The court ruled against Ren, claiming his name is a collection of common characters and as a result the search results were derived from relevant words.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

China has one of the longest histories as an entire nation, being over 2000 years of feudal society; their civil laws and personal rights have not been altered through legislative efforts. Nowhere in the country's civil agreement does it discuss the concept of "privacy", more specifically internet privacy, and the growing issue that citizens, "have the right to be forgotten" on the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.victoria.ac.nz/law/research/publications/vuwlr/prev-issues/pdf/vol-36-2005/issue-3/jingchun.pdf|title=Protecting the Right to Privacy in China|last=Jingchun|first=Cao|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no data protection authority or a specific state agency set in place to monitor the protection of citizens personal data. In China today, data protection is aimed at simply the consumer, as an individual. In contrast to the EU's right to privacy, which the individual is considered a "data subject", with the right to be protected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/IDAN/2015/536472/IPOL_IDA%282015%29536472_EN.pdf|title=Policy Department Citizen's Right and Constitutional Affairs|last=Hert|first=Paul|last2=Papakonstantinou|first2=Vagelis|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese legislation remains neutral, with slow progression towards the support of the "right to be forgotten". The topic has been debated for more than 10 years now, and continues to be a challenge. Small provisions have been implemented related to personal data processing, however they do not amount to a comprehensive data protection regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/IDAN/2015/536472/IPOL_IDA%282015%29536472_EN.pdf|title=Policy Department Citizen's Right and Constitutional Affairs|last=Hert|first=Paul|last2=Papakonstantinou|first2=Vagelis|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no solid, common ground to be found on two fundamentally different systems: realistic, to Chinese laws that are already in place, and legalist, the steps it takes to change those laws, approaches that elicit a need for reification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/IDAN/2015/536472/IPOL_IDA%282015%29536472_EN.pdf|title=Policy Department Citizen's Right and Constitutional Affairs|last=Hert|first=Paul|last2=Papakonstantinou|first2=Vagelis|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Connection to international relations==
The regulatory differences in the protection of personal data between countries has real impact on international relations. The right to be forgotten, specifically, is a matter of EU-US relations when applied to cross-border data flow, as it raises questions about territorial sovereignty. The structure of the [[Westphalian sovereignty|Westphalian international system]] assumes that the reach of a country's jurisdiction is limited to its geographic territory.&lt;ref name="Stephen J. Kobrin 2004 pp 111-131"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kobrin | first1 = Stephen J. | year = 2004 | title = Safe harbours are hard to find: the trans-Atlantic data privacy dispute, territorial jurisdiction and global governance | url = | journal = Review of International Studies | volume = 30 | issue = | pages = 111–131 | doi = 10.1017/S0260210504005856 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, online interactions are independent of geographic location and present across multiple locations, rendering the traditional concept of territorial sovereignty moot.&lt;ref name="Stephen J. Kobrin 2004 pp 111-131"/&gt; Therefore, the EU and the United States are forced to confront their regulatory differences and negotiate on a set of regulations that apply to all foreign companies processing and handling data of European citizens and residents.&lt;ref name="Stephen J. Kobrin 2004 pp 111-131"/&gt;

The regulatory differences on the right to be forgotten along with numerous other data protection rights have shaped discussions and negotiations on trans-Atlantic data privacy regulations. A case in point is the EU and the United States' endeavors to develop the [[International Safe Harbor Privacy Principles|Safe Harbor]] agreement, a data transfer pact that enables the transfer of data between the EU and US companies in a manner consistent with the EU's data protection schemes.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;The Council: Common Position (EC) no. 95&lt;/ref&gt; Article 25 of the Data Protection Directive articulates that cross-border transfer of data can take place only if the "third country in question ensures an adequate level of protection," meaning that the country meets the EU's minimum standards of data protection.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; The standards include, among many provisions, a component that protects the right to "opt out" of further processing or transmission of personal data, under the assumption that data may not be further processed in ways inconsistent with the intent for which they were collected.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; 

Given the inconsistencies between the EU and the United States on numerous [[digital privacy]] regulations, including the right to be forgotten, Article 25 poses a threat to trans-Atlantic data flows. Therefore, the EU and the United States entered into negotiations to mediate the differences through the Safe Harbor agreement, which as a result of debate and discussion between the two parties, requires companies to provide individuals with the choice or opportunity to "opt out" and afford other protections.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

Under the pressures of the mass surveillance carried out by the US government on European citizens' data, the Safe Harbor agreement has been invalidated by the [[European_Court_of_Justice|European Union Court of Justice]] in its [[Max Schrems|''Schrems'' case.]] The Safe Harbor agreement has now been replaced by the [[EU-US_Privacy_Shield|Privacy Shield principles]].

The European Union is a highly influential group of states, and this movement towards the right to be forgotten in the EU is a step towards its global recognition as a right. To support this, in 2012 the Obama Administration released a "Privacy Bill of Rights" to protect consumers online, and while this is not quite the strength of the EU law, it is a step towards recognition of the right to be forgotten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/02/23/fact-sheet-plan-protect-privacy-internet-age-adopting-consumer-privacy-b |title=Fact Sheet: Plan to Protect Privacy in the Internet Age by Adopting a Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights &amp;#124; The White House |publisher=Whitehouse.gov |date=2012-02-23 |accessdate=2014-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Businesses that manage their client's online reputation have responded to the European Court ruling by excercising the right to be forgotten as a means to remove unfavourable information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://searchengineland.com/reputation-vip-online-management-firm-launches-site-assist-googles-forget-form-194998|title=The Inevitable Happened: First Company Provides "Right To Be Forgotten" Removal Service|date=2014-06-25|work=Search Engine Land|access-date=2017-03-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; One technique used by reputation consulting firms is to submit multiple requests for each link, written with different angles in an attempt to get links removed. Google for example does not limit the number of requests that can be submitted on the removal of a given link.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/09/technology/european-companies-see-opportunity-in-the-right-to-be-forgotten.html|title=European Companies See Opportunity in the 'Right to Be Forgotten'|last=Scott|first=Mark|date=2014-07-08|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-03-03|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Criticism==
{{outofdate|section|reason=the General Data Protection Regulation is no longer in draft|date=February 2018}}
Major criticisms stem from the idea that the right to be forgotten would restrict the right to freedom of speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=Eugene Volokh |last=Volokh |first=Eugene |title=Freedom of Speech, Information Privacy, and the Troubling Implications of a Right to Stop People from Speaking about You |year=2000 |journal=[[Stanford Law Review]] |volume=52 |issue=5 |pages=1049–1124 |doi=10.2307/1229510 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=Daniel J.

The draft General Data Protection Regulation was written broadly and this has caused concern.&lt;ref name="fleischer"/&gt; It has attracted criticism that its enactment would require data controlling companies to go to great lengths to identify third parties with the information and remove it.&lt;ref name="stanfordlawreview1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stanfordlawreview.org/online/privacy-paradox/right-to-be-forgotten |title=The Right to Be Forgotten |last=Rosen |first=Jeffrey |publisher=Stanford Law Review |volume=64 |issue=88 |date= February 13, 2012 |accessdate=2014-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposed regulation has also attracted criticism due to the fact that this could produce a censoring effect in that companies, such as Facebook or Google, will wish to not be fined under the act, and will therefore be likely to delete wholesale information rather than facing the fine, which could produce a "serious chilling effect."&lt;ref name=" stanfordlawreview1"/&gt; In addition to this, there are concerns about the requirement to take down information that others have posted about an individual; the definition of personal data in Article 4(2) includes "any information relating to" the individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52012PC0011 |title=Document 52012PC0011 — Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (General Data Protection Regulation) |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu |at=3.4.1.

Other criticism revolves around the principle of [[accountability]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zittrain|first1=Jonathan|title=The right to be forgotten ruling leaves nagging doubts|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/c5d17a80-0910-11e4-8d27-00144feab7de.html#axzz3gL6XFlzC|accessdate=19 July 2015|publisher=[[Financial Times]]|date=13 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were concerns that the proposed General Data Protection Regulation would result in [[Google]] and other Internet search engines not producing neutral search results, but rather producing biased and patchy results, and compromising the [[integrity]] of Internet-based information.&lt;ref name="stanfordlawreview1"/&gt; To balance out this criticism, the proposed General Data Protection Regulation included an exception "for the processing of personal data carried out solely for journalistic purposes or the purpose of artistic or literary expression in order to reconcile the right to the protection of personal data with the rules governing freedom of expression."&lt;ref name="europa1"/&gt; Article 80 upheld freedom of speech, and while not lessening obligations on data providers and social media sites, nevertheless due to the wide meaning of "journalistic purposes" allows more autonomy and reduces the amount of information that is necessary to be removed.&lt;ref name="mantelero"/&gt;{{rp|9}} When Google agreed to implement the ruling, European Commission Vice-President [[Viviane Reding]] said, "The Court also made clear that journalistic work must not be touched; it is to be protected."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://ec.europa.eu/justice/newsroom/data-protection/news/140602_en.htm | title='Right to be forgotten' and online search engines ruling | publisher=European Commission | date=2014-06-03 | accessdate=2014-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Google was criticized for taking down (under the Costeja precedent) a BBC News blog post about [[Stan O'Neal]] by economics editor [[Robert Peston]] (eventually, Peston reported that his blog post has remained findable in Google after all).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-28130581 | title=Why has Google cast me into oblivion? | work=BBC News | date=2 July 2014 | accessdate=2014-07-03 | author=Peston, Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.truthdig.com/eartotheground/item/the_right_to_be_forgotten_is_already_messing_up_journalism_20140702 | title=The 'Right to Be Forgotten' Is Already Messing Up Journalism | work=Truthdig | date=July 2, 2014 | accessdate=2014-07-03 | author=Scheer, Peter Z.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these criticisms and Google's action, the company's CEO, [[Larry Page]] worries that the ruling will be "used by other governments that aren't as forward and progressive as Europe to do bad things", though has since distanced himself from that position.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jul/24/google-hauled-in-by-europe-over-right-to-be-forgotten-reaction|title=Google hauled in by Europe over 'right to be forgotten' reaction|author=Samuel Gibbs|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, pianist [[Dejan Lazic]] cited the ''Right To Be Forgotten'' in trying to remove a negative review about his performance from ''[[The Washington Post]]''.

[[Index on Censorship]] claimed that the ''Costeja'' ruling "allows individuals to complain to search engines about information they do not like with no legal oversight.

Other criticisms involving the right to be forgotten revolves around the policies for data removal regarding minors. The U.S. has laws in place that protect the privacy of minors. The California Minor Eraser Law is a law that allows California residents under the age of 18 to request to have information removed that they posted on an online server. The law "applies to websites, social media sites, mobile apps and other online services"&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dataprotectionreport.com/2015/01/california-enacts-right-to-be-forgotten-for-minors/|title=California enacts "Right to be Forgotten" for Minors - Data Protection Report|date=2015-01-14|work=Data Protection Report|access-date=2017-05-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and follows "Europe's recognition of the 'right to be forgotten'".&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; This law was put into effect on January 1, 2015 and remains in existence today.

In the UK, the [[United Kingdom general election, 2017|2017]] [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] manifesto&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://diginomica.com/2017/05/15/election-2017-tories-offer-18s-right-forgotten-threaten-big-fines-social-media-firms/|title=UK Election 2017 - Tories offer under-18s the Right to be Forgotten, threaten big fines for social media firms|date=2017-05-15|website=diginomica|access-date=2017-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; included a pledge to allow social media platform users to remove outdated information that was posted when they were under the age of 18. "A Tory victory on the 8th of June will lead to those youthful indiscretions on Facebook and Twitter being open to erasure. But there are also plans to fine social media firms for not moving at the speed of political opportunism over extreme content."&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; The United Kingdom has not yet fully adopted the ruling of the [[European Court of Justice]] regarding the right to be forgotten and argued to keep it from going into EU law.{{fact|date=February 2018}} However, in the upcoming elections in the UK laws could be passed to allow minors to remove embarrassing posts or photos on social media that could come back to affect job applications or public image in later life.

[[Theresa May]], the Prime Minister of the UK, has been pushing to extend privacy rights for minors in allowing them to have a right to delete information. The intentions for this extension of privacy are based on the fact that social media sites store years of data that affect minors lives' much later after the information is posted.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-05-12/may-tells-facebook-to-offer-kids-right-to-delete-information|title=May Tells Facebook to Offer Kids the Right to Delete Information|date=2017-05-12|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2017-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; May gave her stance on privacy when she said, "'The Internet has brought a wealth of opportunity but also significant new risks which have evolved faster than society's response to them'".&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], which is headed by May, has pushed for policies that aggressively removes illegal material from the internet and fines firms that do not take action in removing said material.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

In 2015, [[Commission nationale de l'informatique et des libertés]] (CNIL), the data privacy watchdog of France trird to impose the right globally. CNIL asked [[Google]] to remove data from all versions available in any part of the world. Google and other entities argued that European data regulators should not be allowed to decide what Internet users around the world find when they use a search engine.&lt;ref&gt; [https://previewtech.net/right-to-be-forgotten-globally-google-cnil-france/ France tries to impose ‘Right to be Forgotten’ globally.

==Research==
[[File:Oblivion Framework Architecture new.png|thumb|right|Conceptual overview of Oblivion]]
Security researchers from CISPA, Saarland University&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://cispa.saarland|title = CISPA: The Center for IT-Security, Privacy, and Accountability}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the University of Auckland&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/en.html|title = The University of Auckland}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a framework, called Oblivion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |last=Simeonovski |first=Milivoj | last2=Bendun |first2=Fabian |last3=Asghar |first3=Muhammad Rizwan | last4=Backes |first4=Michael| last5=Marnau |first5=Ninja |last6=Druschel |first6=Peter | eprint=1506.06033 |title=Oblivion: Mitigating Privacy Leaks by Controlling the Discoverability of Online Information |date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; to support the automation of the right to be forgotten in a scalable, provable and privacy-preserving manner. Oblivion is a program that helps to "automate" the process of attempting to verify someone's personal information that could be found in a Google search result."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google gets many take-down requests at a high volume, so Oblivion is able to help with this problem. Researchers and authors behind Oblivion say that "it is essential to develop techniques that at least partly automate this process and are scalable to internet size."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Oblivion helps the humans that operate the forms at Google ensure that ill-intending users cannot "blacklist links to internet sources that do not affect them."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; For example, tests have proven that Oblivion handles requests at a rate of 278 per second.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The software allows Google, the government, and the user to work together to get content removed quickly and for just cause. In order to ensure that the program works quickly, is secure for its users and is impervious to fake take-down requests, Oblivion uses a three-part system.

In the first part, Oblivion requires a user to submit identification about themselves – not limited to "name, age, and nationality."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Oblivion then enables a user to automatically find and tag his or her disseminated personal information using natural language processing and image recognition techniques and file a request in a privacy-preserving manner. Oblivion will scan the article for attributes that match information that has been submitted by the user. Second, Oblivion provides indexing systems with an automated and provable eligibility mechanism, asserting that the author of a request is indeed affected by an online resource. The author of a request is then issued an "ownership token"&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; that confirms the articles they submitted for evaluation include sensitive personal information. The automated eligibility proof ensures censorship-resistance so that only legitimately affected individuals can request the removal of corresponding links from search results. In the third and last phase, this "ownership token" is submitted to Google, accompanied by the user's concerns as to what information should be deleted.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Google's staff is then allowed to decide for themselves if they want to delete this information or not - but thanks to Oblivion, they know that the information in question is valid.

Researchers with Oblivion, however, have noted that it comes with some limitations. The software is lacking a human element, therefore it cannot decide on its own "whether or not a piece of information is public interest and should therefore not be removed from Google search results."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Researchers have conducted comprehensive evaluations, showing that Oblivion is suitable for large-scale deployment once it is fine-tuned.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}

'''{{lang|de|Sehnsucht}}''' ({{IPA-de|ˈzeːnˌzʊxt}}) is a [[German language|German]] noun translated as "longing", "pining", "yearning", or "craving",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://dict.leo.org/german-english/sehnsucht |title=LEO Results for "sehnsucht"}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Some psychologists use the word {{lang|de|Sehnsucht}} to represent thoughts and feelings about all facets of life that are unfinished or imperfect, paired with a yearning for ideal alternative experiences.&lt;ref name="Reference 1"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kotter-Grühn |first=D. |last2=Wiest |first2=M. |last3=Zurek |first3=P. |last4=Scheibe |first4=S. |title=What is it we are longing for?

Psychologists have worked to capture the essence of {{lang|de|Sehnsucht}} by identifying its six core characteristics:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Scheibe |first=S. |last2=Freund |first2=A. M. |last3=Baltes |first3=P. B. |title=Toward a developmental psychology of Sehnsucht (life longings): The optimal (utopian) life |journal=Developmental Psychology |year=2007 |volume=43 |pages=778–795 |doi=10.1037/0012-1649.43.3.778 |pmid=17484587 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# utopian conceptions of ideal development;
# sense of incompleteness and imperfection of life;
# conjoint time focus on the past, present, and future;
# ambivalent (bittersweet) emotions;
# reflection and evaluation of one's life; and
# symbolic richness.

In a cross-cultural study conducted to determine whether the German concept of {{lang|de|Sehnsucht}} could be generalized to the United States, four samples of American and German participants “rated their 2 most important life longings and completed measures of subjective well-being and health.”&lt;ref name="Reference 2"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Scheibe |first=S. |last2=Blanchard-Fields |first2=F. |last3=Wiest |first3=M. |last4=Freund |first4=A. M. |title=Is longing only for Germans? A cross-cultural comparison of sehnsucht in Germany and the United States |journal=Developmental Psychology |year=2011 |doi=10.1037/a0021807 |volume=47 |pages=603–618 |pmid=21219068 }}&lt;/ref&gt; German and American participants did not differ in their ability to identify life longings or the intensity of their {{lang|de|Sehnsucht}}. However, German participants associated it more with unattainable, utopian states while Americans reported the concept as not as important to everyday life.

Some researchers posit that {{lang|de|Sehnsucht}} has a developmental function that involves life management. By imagining overarching and possibly unachievable goals, individuals may be able to create direction in their life by developing more tangible goals, or “stepping stones” that will aid them on their path toward their ideal self. "[{{lang|de|Sehnsucht}} has] important developmental functions, including giving directionality for life planning and helping to cope with loss and important, yet unattainable wishes by pursuing them in one's imagination."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Scheibe |first=S. |last2=Freund |first2=A. M. |title=Approaching Sehnsucht (life longings) from a life-span perspective: The role of personal utopias in development |journal=Research in Human Development |year=2008 |pages=121–133 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It can also operate as a self-regulatory mechanism.

However, in a study that attempted to discover whether {{lang|de|Sehnsucht}} played an active role in one’s ability to influence their own development, psychologists asked 81 participants to report “their most important personal goals and life longings, and [evaluate] these with respect to their cognitive, emotional, and action-related characteristics.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mayser |first=S. |last2=Scheibe |first2=S. |last3=Riediger |first3=M. |title=(Un)reachable? An empirical differentiation of goals and life longings |journal=European Psychologist |year=2008 |volume=13 |pages=126–140 |doi=10.1027/1016-9040.13.2.126 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Results showed that goals were perceived as more closely linked to everyday actions, and as such more controllable. {{lang|de|Sehnsucht}}, on the other hand, was reported as more related to the past and future, and therefore more emotionally and developmentally ambiguous.

Also, in a study conducted in 2009, 168 middle-aged childless women were asked to rate their wish for children according to intensity and attainability. If the women rated their wish as intense and long-standing, their wish was considered a life-longing. If they rated their wish as intense and attainable, it was simply a goal. “The pursuit of the wish for children as a life longing was positively related to well-being only when participants had high control over the experience of this life longing and when other self-regulation strategies (goal adjustment) failed.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kotter-Grühn |first=D. |last2=Scheibe |first2=S. |last3=Blanchard-Fields |first3=F. |last4=Baltes |first4=P. B. |title=Developmental emergence and functionality of Sehnsucht (life longings): The sample case of involuntary childlessness in middle-aged women |journal=Psychology and Aging |year=2009 |volume=24 |pages=634–644 |doi=10.1037/a0016359 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{refimprove|date=October 2011}}
The '''semantic gap''' characterizes the difference between two descriptions of an object by different linguistic representations, for instance languages or symbols. According to Hein, the semantic gap can be defined as "the difference in meaning between constructs formed within different representation systems".&lt;ref name="Hein"&gt;Hein, A.M., Identification and Bridging of Semantic Gaps in the Context of Multi-Domain Engineering, Abstracts of the 2010 Forum on Philosophy, Engineering &amp; Technology. Colorado. [http://philengtech.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/fPET2010-abstracts-5-1-2010.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[computer science]], the concept is relevant whenever ordinary human activities, observations, and tasks are transferred into a computational representation.&lt;ref name="IRdef"&gt;Smeulders AWM, Worring M, Santini S, Gupta A, Jain R. Content-Based Image Retrieval at the End of the Early Years. IEEE Trans  Pattern Anal Mach Intell 2000;22(12):1349-80.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Multimediadef"&gt;Dorai C, Venkatesh S. Bridging the Semantic Gap with Computational Media Aesthetics. IEEE MultiMedia 2003;10(2):15-17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hein"/&gt;

More precisely the gap means the difference between ambiguous formulation of contextual knowledge in a powerful language (e.g. [[natural language]]) and its sound, reproducible and computational representation in a [[formal language]] (e.g. [[programming language]]). [[Semantics]] of an object depends on the context it is regarded within. For practical application this means any formal representation of real world tasks requires the translation of the contextual expert knowledge of an application (high-level) into the elementary and reproducible operations of a computing machine (low-level). Since natural language allows the expression of tasks which are impossible to compute in a formal language there are no means to automatize this translation in a general way. Moreover, the examination of languages within the [[Chomsky hierarchy]] indicates that there is no formal and consequently automated way of translating from one language into another above a certain level of expressional power.

==Theoretical background==
The yet unproven but commonly accepted [[Church-Turing thesis]] states that a [[Turing machine]] and all equivalent formal languages such as the [[lambda calculus]] perform and represent all formal operations respectively as applied by a computing human. However the selection of adequate operations for the correct computation itself is not formally deducible, moreover it depends on the computability of the underlying problem. Tasks, such as the [[halting problem]], may be formulated comprehensively in natural language, but the computational representation will not terminate or does not provide a usable result, which is proven by [[Rice's theorem]]. The general expression of limitations for rule based deduction by Gödel's [[incompleteness theorem]] indicates that the semantic gap is never to be fully closed. These are general statements, considering the generalized limits of computation on the highest level of abstraction where the '''semantic gap''' manifests itself. There are however lots of subsets of problems which may be translated automatically, especially in the higher numbered levels of the Chomsky hierarchy.

==Formal languages==
Real world tasks are formalized by programming languages, which are executed on computers based on the [[von Neumann architecture]]. Since programming languages are only comfortable representations of the Turing machine any program on a von Neumann computer has the same properties and limitations as the Turing machine or its equivalent representation. Consequently, every programming language such as CPU level machine code, assembler, or any high level programming language has the same expressional power as the underlying Turing machine is able to compute. There is no '''semantic gap''' between them since a program is transferred from the high level language to the machine code by a program, e.g. a [[compiler]] which itself runs on a Turing machine without any user interaction. The semantic gap actually opens between the selection of the rules and the representation of the task.

==Practical consequences==
Selection of rules for formal representations of real world applications, corresponds to writing a program. Writing programs is independent from the actual programming language and basically requires the translation of the domain specific knowledge of the user into the formal rules operating a turing machine. It is this transfer from contextual knowledge into formal representation which cannot be automatized with respect to the theoretical limitations of computation. Consequently, any mapping from real world applications into computer applications requires a certain amount of technical background knowledge by the user, where the '''semantic gap''' manifests itself.

It is a fundamental task of [[software engineering]] to close the gap between application specific knowledge and technically doable formalization. For this purpose domain specific (high-level) knowledge must be transferred into an algorithm and its parameters (low-level). This requires the dialogue between user and developer. Aim is always a software which allows the user to represent his knowledge as parameters of an algorithm without knowing the details of the implementation, and to interpret the outcome of the algorithm without the aid of the developer. For this purpose [[user interface]]s play the key role in software design, while developers are supported by [[Software framework|frameworks]] which help organizing the integration of contextual information.

==Examples==

===Document retrieval===
A simple example can be formulated as a series of increasingly difficult [[Natural language processing|natural language]] queries to locate a ''target document'' that may or may not exist locally on a known computer system.

'''Example queries''':
* 1) Locate any file in the known directory "/usr/local/funny".
* 2) Locate any file where the word "funny" appears in the filename.
* 3) Locate any [[text file]] where the word "funny" or the substring "humor" appears in the text.
* 4) Locate any [[mp3]] file where either "funny", "comic" or "humor" appears in the metadata.
* 5) Locate any file of any type related to humor.
* 6) Locate any image that is likely to make my grandmother laugh.

The progressive difficulty of these queries is represented by the increasing degree of abstraction from the types and semantics defined the system architecture (directories and files on a known computer) to the types and semantics that occupy the realm of ordinary human discourse (subjects such as "humor" and entities such as "my grandmother"). Moreover, this disparity of realms is further complicated by [[leaky abstraction]]s, such as is common in the case of query 4), where the ''target document'' may exist, but may not encapsulate the "metadata" in a manner expected by the user, nor the designer of the query processing system.

===Image analysis===
Image analysis is a typical domain for which a high degree of abstraction from low-level methods is required, and where the '''semantic gap''' immediately affects the user. If image content is to be identified to understand the meaning of an image, the only available independent information is the low-level pixel data. Textual annotations always depend on the knowledge, capability of expression and specific language of the annotator and therefore is unreliable. To recognize the displayed scenes from the raw data of an image the algorithms for selection and manipulation of pixels must be combined and parameterized in an adequate manner and finally linked with the natural description. Even the simple linguistic representation of shape or color such as round or yellow requires entirely different mathematical formalization methods, which are neither intuitive nor unique and sound.
[[File:Semantic Gap.svg|thumb|Semantic gap in the context of image analysis|400x400px]]

===Layered systems===
In many [[layered system]]s, some conflicts arise when concepts at a high level of abstraction need to be translated into lower, more concrete [[Artifact (information theory)|artifact]]s. This mismatch is often called '''semantic gap'''.

===Databases===
[[OODBMS]]s (object-oriented database management system) advocates sometimes claim that these databases help to reduce the semantic gap between the application domain ([[miniworld]]) and the traditional RDBMS systems. [http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0ISJ/is_n2_v33/ai_15519487/pg_4]. However Relational proponents would posit the exact opposite, because by definition object databases fix the data being recorded into a single binding abstraction.

{{Redirect|Juggling beat|music|beat juggling}}

'''Siteswap''' is a [[juggling notation]] used to describe or represent [[juggling pattern]]s. ''Siteswap'' may also be used to describe '''siteswap patterns''', possible patterns transcribed using siteswap.

The name ''siteswap'' comes from the ability to generate patterns by "swapping" landing times of any 2 throws in a siteswap.

==Vanilla==
[[File:Juggling53145305520.png|right|border|Diagram of someone "juggling" with the siteswap notation and the state]]
Its simplest form, sometimes called vanilla siteswap, describes only patterns whose throws alternate hands and in which one ball is thrown at a time. If we were to watch someone from above as they were juggling while walking forward, we might see something like the adjacent diagram, which is sometimes called a '''space-time diagram''' or '''ladder diagram'''.  In this diagram, time progresses from the top to the bottom.

We can describe this pattern by stating how many throws later the ball is thrown again. For instance, on the first throw in the diagram, the purple ball is thrown in the air by the right hand, next the blue ball, the green ball, the green ball again, and the blue ball again and then finally the purple ball is caught and thrown by the left hand on the fifth throw, this gives the first throw a count of ''5''. We end up with a [[sequence]] of numbers which denote the height of each throw to be made. Since hands alternate, [[parity (mathematics)|odd]]-numbered throws send the ball to the other hand, while even-numbered throws send the ball to the same hand. A ''3'' represents a throw to the opposite hand at the height of the basic three-[[cascade (juggling)|cascade]]; a ''4'' represents a throw to the same hand at the height of the four-[[fountain (juggling)|fountain]], and so on.

There are three special throws: a ''0'' is a pause with an empty hand, a ''1'' is a quick pass straight across to the other hand, and a ''2'' is a momentary hold of an object. Throws longer than ''9'' beats are given letters starting with ''a''. The number of beats a ball is in the air usually corresponds to how high it was thrown, so many people refer to the numbers as heights, but this is not technically correct; all that matters is the number of beats in the air, not how high it is thrown. For example, bouncing a ball takes longer than a throw in the air to the same height, and so can be a higher siteswap value while being a lower throw.

Each pattern repeats after a certain number of throws, called the ''[[Frequency|period]]'' of the pattern. The pattern is named after the shortest repeating segment of the sequence, so the pattern diagrammed on the right is 53145305520 and has a period of 11. If the period is an odd number, like this one, then each time you repeat the sequence you're starting with the other hand, and the pattern is '''symmetrical''' because each hand is doing the same thing (although at different times). If the period is an even number then on every repeat of the pattern, each hand does the same thing it did last time and the pattern is '''asymmetrical'''.

The number of balls used for the pattern is the average of the throw numbers in the pattern.&lt;ref name="T&amp;M"/&gt; For example, ''441'' is a three-object pattern because (4+4+1)/3 is 3, and ''86'' is a seven-object pattern. All patterns must therefore have a siteswap sequence that averages to an [[integer]]. Not all such sequences describe patterns; for example ''543'' with integer average 4 but its three throws all land at the same time, colliding.

Some hold to a convention in that a siteswap is written with its highest numbers first. One drawback to doing so is evident in the pattern ''51414'', a 3-ball pattern which cannot be inserted into the middle of a string of 3-throws, unlike its rotation ''45141'' which can.

===State diagrams===
Just after throwing a ball (or club or other juggling object), all balls are in the air and are only under the influence of gravity. Assuming you catch the balls at a consistent level, then the timing of when the balls land is already determined. We can mark each point in time when a ball is going to land with an ''x'', and each point in time when there is not yet a ball scheduled to land with a ''-''. This describes the '''state''' that you're in and determines what you can throw next. For instance, we can look at the state just after our first throw in the diagram, it is xx-&lt;!--two "-"s--&gt;-x. We can use the state to determine what can be thrown next. First we take the ''x'' off the left hand side (that's the ball that's landing next) and shift everything else to the left filling in a ''-'' on the right. This leaves us with x--x-. Since we caught a ball (the x we removed from the left) we can't "throw" a 0 next. We also can't throw a 1 or a 4, because there are already balls scheduled to land there. So assuming that the highest we can accurately throw a ball is to a height of 5, then we can only throw a 2, 3, or a 5. In this diagram, the juggler threw a 3, so an x goes in the third spot, replacing the -, and we have x-xx- as the new state.

[[File:StateDiagram3BallMaxThrow5.png|left|border|400px]]
The diagram on the left shows all possible states for someone juggling three items and a maximum height of 5. From each state you can follow the arrows and the corresponding numbers give you the siteswap. Any path which brings you back to the same state that you started with is a valid siteswap, and all siteswaps can be generated this way. The diagram becomes a lot bigger very fast when more balls or higher throws are introduced as there are more possible states and more possible throws. 

Another method of representing siteswap states is having the next throw on the right and read to the left (instead of the left to right system described above), represent a ball with a 1 instead of an x, and represent a spot where there's no ball scheduled to land with a 0 instead of a -. Then the state can be represented with a binary number, such as binary 10011 for the first state in the space-time diagram above. This method makes it a lot easier to represent more objects or higher throws as it is less complicated to create.

The table on the right contains the same information as the diagram on the left. To generate a siteswap, first find the row of your starting state. Reading across the row will give you the possible numbers you can throw and the column will give you the resulting state. Moving like this from state to state until you end up back in your starting state will give you a valid siteswap.

===Mathematical connections===
Vanilla siteswap patterns may be viewed as certain elements of the [[affine Weyl group]] of type &lt;math&gt;{\tilde{A}}_n&lt;/math&gt;. One presentation of this group is as the set of [[bijective]] functions ''f'' on the integers such that, for a fixed ''n'':  ''f''(''i'' + ''n'') = ''f''(''i'') + ''n'' for all integers ''i''.  If the element ''f'' satisfies the further condition that ''f''(''i'') ≥ ''i'' for all ''i'', then ''f'' corresponds to the (infinitely repeated) siteswap pattern whose ''i''th number is ''f''(''i'') &amp;minus; ''i'': that is, the ball thrown at time ''i'' will land at time ''f''(''i'').

A subset of these siteswap patterns naturally label strata in the positroid stratification of the [[Grassmannian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite arXiv|last1=Knutson|last2=Lam|last3=Speyer|first1=Allen|first2=Thomas|first3=David|eprint=1111.3660|title=Positroid Varieties: Juggling and Geometry|date=November 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Several jugglers who have spent time in working on site swaps describe the same gain in flexibility and conceptual power that mathematicians seem to report from the use of well-chosen abstractions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference|editor-last1=Borwein|editor-first1=Jonathan M.|date=1997|publisher=American Mathematical Society|book-title=Organic mathematics|conference=Organic Mathematics Workshop|page=141|isbn=9780821806685|oclc=36259883}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Extensions ==

=== Multi-handed ===

Multi-hand notation was developed by Ed Carstens in 1992 for use with his juggling program JugglePro.&lt;ref name="Lewbel"/&gt; Siteswap notation in its simplest form ("Vanilla siteswap") assumes that only one ball is thrown at a time.  It follows that any valid siteswap for two hands will also be valid for any number of hands, on the condition that the hands throw after each other.  Commonly used multi-hand siteswaps are ''1-handed (diabolo) siteswap'', and ''4-handed (passing) siteswap''.

'''1-handed (diabolo) '''

The siteswap is performed by a single hand, or a [[diabolo]] player throwing diabolos at different heights.

'''4-handed '''

Valid siteswaps can be juggled by a 4-handed juggler, or for 2 jugglers coordinating 4 hands, on the condition that hands throw alternately.

In practice, this is most easily obtained if the jugglers throw by turns, one sequence being (Right hand of juggler A, right hand of juggler B, left hand of A, left hand of B).

=== Synchronous ===
[[File:Juggling - 3-ball box (4,2x)(2x,4) ladder diagram.svg|150px|thumb|Ladder diagram for box: (4,2x)(2x,4)]]

Siteswap notation can be extended to denote patterns containing synchronous throws from both hands. The numbers for the two throws are combined in [[Bracket#Parentheses ( )|parentheses]] and separated by a comma. Only even numbers are allowed (each throw involves two hands, and thus only even numbers), so throws that move to the other hand are marked by an ''x''. Thus a synchronous three-prop [[shower (juggling)|shower]] is denoted ''(4x,2x)'', meaning one hand continually throws a low throw or 'zip' to the opposite hand, while the other continually makes a higher throw to the first. Sequences of bracketed pairs are written without delimiting markers.

=== Multiplexing ===
[[File:Multiplex333 33.gif|thumb|100px|3-ball Cascade with triplex: [333]33]]

A further extension allows siteswap to notate patterns involving multiple throws from either or both hands at the same time in a [[multiplex (juggling)|multiplex]] pattern. The numbers for multiple throws from a single hand are written together inside square brackets.  For example, ''[33]33'' is a normal 3-ball cascade, with a pair of balls always thrown together.

=== Passing ===
[[File:Classic 4beats passing 2juggler 6balls side.gif|thumb|100px|Four-count, or "Every others": {{nowrap|&lt;333P&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;333P&gt;}}]]

Simultaneous juggling: ''&lt;xxx|yyy&gt;'' notation means one juggler does 'xxx' while another does 'yyy'.  'p' is used to represent a passing throw.  For example, ''&lt;3p 3|3p 3&gt;'' is a 6 prop '2 count' passing pattern, where all left hand throws are passes and right hand throws are selves. This can also be used with synchronous patterns; a two-person 'shower' is then ''&lt;(4xp,2x)|(4xp,2x)&gt;''

If the pattern contains fractions, e.g. ''&lt;4.5 3 3 | 3 4 3.5&gt;'' the juggler after the bar is supposed to be half a count later, and all fractions are passes. If both juggle the same pattern (although shifted in time), the pattern is called a social siteswap and only half of the pattern needs to be written: ''&lt;4p 3| 3 4p&gt;'' becomes ''4p 3'' and ''&lt;4.5 3 3| 3 4.5 3&gt;'' becomes ''4.5 3 3''.

=== Other extensions ===
Various other enhancements to the siteswap system have been proposed and enjoy some use.
* Synchronous siteswaps that switch sides: patterns that repeat in mirror image can be abbreviated with a *.  For example, Instead of ''(4,2x)(2x,4)'' (3-ball box pattern), you can write ''(4,2x)*''.
* In [[#Programs|software]], files describing patterns may contain additional information. In Joepass, each throw can be given an individual delay (the equivalent of extending the holding time), thus allowing the description of irregular rhythms.
* Siteswaps may be considered either prime or composite. If a siteswap may be split into any valid shorter pattern which uses the same number of props, it is composite, and one which may not is prime.&lt;ref&gt;Beever, Ben (2001). "[http://www.jugglingedge.com/pdf/BenBeeversGuidetoJugglingPatterns.pdf Siteswap Ben's Guide to Juggling Patterns]", p.6, ''JugglingEdge.com''. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150810153015/https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/15026487/GJP.pdf |date=August 10, 2015 |title=BenBeever.com }}.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, 441, which uses three props, is prime, as 1, 4, 41, and 44 are not valid three prop patterns (as 1/3≠3, 4/3≠3, (4+1)/3≠3, and (4+4)/3≠3).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1561">'''Steady change''' is the persistent process of transformation in a [[capitalism|capitalist]] [[economic system]]. 

This is explained by the continuous generation, diffusion, accumulation and substitution of innovations by [[economic agent]]s as time moves on. This regular (and accelerating) phenomenon causes movement and crises in economic structures as measured by rates of growth of countries, regions, [[Economic sector|sectors]] and companies. 

The economy is an evolving system. It is thus to always unfold and change, to incessantly show novel behaviour, to surprise its actors and observers with emergent phenomena. The concept stands in contrast to the conventional concept of [[Steady state economy|"steady-state"]] in economics and is inspired by evolutionary insights in modern economic theory such as put forward by Nelson and Winter's book of 1982.

{{Jainism}}
In [[Jain Philosophy|Jain tradition]], '''twelve contemplations''', ([[Prakrit]]: बारस अणुवेक्खा ) are the twelve mental reflections that a [[Jain monasticism|Jain ascetic]] and a [[Śrāvaka (Jainism)|practitioner]] should repeatedly engage into. These twelve contemplations are also known as ''Barah anuprekśa'' or ''Barah bhāvana''. According to [[Jain Philosophy]], these twelve contemplations pertain to eternal truths like nature of universe, human existence, and [[Karma in Jainism|karma]] on which one must meditate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jaini|2001|pp=248}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twelve contemplations is an important topic that has been developed at all epochs of [[Jain literature]]. They are regarded as summarising fundamental teachings of the doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Caillat|2008|pp=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stoppage of new Karma is called ''[[Samvara]]''. Constant engagement on these twelve contemplations help the soul in ''samvara'' or stoppage of karmas.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Umasvati|2006|pp=223–225}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Prabhacandra|2012|pp=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Twelve Contemplations ==
Following are twelve Anupreksas or bhavanas that one must constantly reflect or contemplate upon:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jaini|2001|pp=248–249}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sangave|2001|pp=237–239}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ol start="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''Anitya'' – Impermanence (of everything), that is, contemplation on the fact that everything in this world including relations are transient and fleeting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''Asharana'' – Helplessness (against our karma). The soul is helpless against its own karma.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''Ekatva'' – Solitariness (of the soul), that is, acceptance of the fact that I am alone in the world and alone will suffer or enjoy the consequences of my Karma.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''Anyatva'' Distinctiveness (of the self from everything else). The knowledge that the world, my kinsmen, my body, my mind, all are distinct from my real self i.e. the soul.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''[[Saṃsāra (Jainism)|Samsara]]'' – (inevitability of) transmigration, reflection of the fact that soul is ensnared in the continuous and sorrowful cycle of birth and death and cannot attain true happiness till it ends this cycle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''[[Loka]]'' – (the nature of) Universe, that is, contemplation on the fundamental truths about the universe that it is beginningless, uncreated and operates according to its own laws—there is no divine omnipotent being responsible for the Universe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''Ashucitva'' – Impurity (of soul, on account of its association with karma) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''[[Asrava]]'' – Influx of karma. Reflection of the fact that inflow of karmas is the cause of my mundane existence and there is no liberation as long as my soul is associated with karmas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''[[Samvara]]'' – Cessation of karmic inflow, that is, contemplation on the stoppage of karmic inflow by cultivating necessary virtues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''[[Nirjara]]'' – Shedding of karma, that is, shedding or destruction of karmas by penances.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''Dharmasvakhyata'' – path of righteousness, Reflection on the true nature of the path to righteousness based on true teachings of Jina through various practices like Ahimsa and non-attachment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''Bodhidurlabha''  – Rarity of finding the right path to enlightenment. Reflection on the fact that true enlightenment is very rare and many souls are deprived of moksha or liberation due to failure to reincarnate as human and attain true teachings of the Jina.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

== Importance of Twelve Contemplations ==
Twelve Contemplations or ''anupreksa'' is an important tool for meditation. In Yogasastra, Hemcandra gives great importance to the twelve contemplations since constant reflections on these ''bhavanas'' results in detachment in worldly matters which in turn results in equanimity. With equanimity, passions (kasaya) are eliminated resulting in mental purity. This finally culminates into knowledge of self.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hemacandra|2012|pp=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, these twelve contemplations are also one of the reasons for stoppage of influx of karmas as they regulate our thoughts and physical actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Umasvati|2006|pp=223–225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Important texts detailing twelve contemplations ==
*Barasa Anuvekkha, a 2nd Century CE text by Acarya [[Kundakunda]]. It is a short Prakrit text of 90 gathas focusing on the spiritual aspects of meditation. Kundakunda shows how leading the mind in a certain direction will held develop detachment from worldly entanglements, thus helping the soul progress on the path of liberation. Muni Pranamyasagar has written the first and only commentary on it. It has been written in ''Kādambini'' style in Sanskrit language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Muni Pranamyasagar|title=बारसाणुवेक्खा|trans-title=Baras Anuvekkha|publisher=Arhat Vidyaprakashan GoteGanv|pages=790}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Tattvarthasutra]], a 2nd Century CE text  by [[Umasvati]]. 
*Yogasastra, a 12th Century CE text by Acarya [[Hemacandra]]. Hemacandra devotes a chapter on these contemplations in his Sanskrit text, Yogasastra. 
*Maranavibhatti or Maranasamahi Painnayam – (gathas 570 – 640)

[[Image:Ottawa v Tampa Bay refs goal fight April 22 2006.jpg|thumb|[[Official (ice hockey)|Linesmen]] attempt to break up a fight around the Tampa Bay goal during the first ice hockey playoff game between the [[Ottawa Senators]] and the [[Tampa Bay Lightning]].]]

'''[[Violence]]''' has been a part of [[ice hockey]] since at least the early 1900s. According to the book ''[[Hockey: A People's History]]'', in 1904 alone, four players were killed during hockey games from the frequent brawls and violent stickwork.&lt;ref name="PeopleHistory"&gt;
{{cite video|people=Drewery, Laine (Writer and Director), Chong,Wayne (Producer)|date=2006|title=Hockey: A People's History, Episode 1 - A simple game, DVD Chapter&amp;nbsp;— From sport to spectacle|medium=DVD|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More modern examples of violence include brawls, fan involvement, physical abuse of officials and deliberately injuring opponents. Violent actions such as kicking, hitting from behind and prohibited stickwork, are penalized with suspensions or fines. [[Fighting in ice hockey|Fighting]], or fisticuffs, is also penalized but is considered by many hockey enthusiasts, particularly in [[North America]], to be quite distinct from stick-swinging or other violent acts. They regard fighting as an entrenched, acceptable and integral part of the game.

On the ice, referees may impose [[Ice hockey#Penalties|penalties]] for prohibited activities. Off the ice, the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) sometimes fines, suspends or expels players. The criminal justice system has also been known to investigate, charge and convict players. As a result, hockey has become much more regulated and the violent element much more controlled. This has been aided, in no small part, by dramatic increases in disciplinary processes and technology allowing for a high level of scrutiny of any event which occurs.

==History==
Early hockey in particular was noted for its extreme violence, to the point where two players were killed in three years during brawls.  In both cases, the accused assailants were acquitted, but these and other bloody incidents led to calls for the sport to clean up its act or be banned along with the likes of [[cockfighting]].&lt;ref&gt;McKinley, Michael: "Hockey: A People's History," pages 27-28.  McClelland &amp; Stewart, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  The worst of the violence waned, particularly with the advent of regulations for quasi-legal fisticuffs, though incidents continue to occur from time to time.

[[Billy Coutu]] was the first, and to date only, player banned from the NHL for life for violence in 1927; he assaulted [[referee (hockey)|referee]] Jerry Laflamme and tackled referee Billy Bell before starting a [[bench-clearing brawl]] during a [[Stanley Cup]] game between the [[Boston Bruins]] and [[Ottawa Senators (original)|Ottawa Senators]], apparently on the orders of Bruins Head Coach [[Art Ross]]. The NHL's first president, [[Frank Calder]], expelled Coutu from the NHL for life; the ban was lifted after two-and-a-half years, but Coutu never played in the NHL again.

Other incidents include the December 12, 1933, event when [[Eddie Shore]] rammed [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] star [[Ace Bailey]] from behind, causing Bailey to strike his head on the ice; Bailey never played hockey again. More recently, controversy and criminal charges have resulted from violent attacks by [[Marty McSorley]], [[Todd Bertuzzi]] and [[Chris Simon]].

Players who are banned in the [[American Hockey League]] (AHL) for violence are not permitted in the [[ECHL]], and vice versa, because of their agreements with the [[Professional Hockey Players' Association]].

In January 2012, [[David Johnston]], the [[Governor General of Canada]], said that violence such as headshots, high-sticking and fighting should not be part of the sport.&lt;ref name="govgen"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/story/2012/01/26/pol-gg-hockey-fighting-pnp.html | title=Fighting has no place in hockey, GG says | publisher=CBC | date=January 26, 2012 | accessdate=January 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reports investigating violence==
There have been two major Canadian reports on violence in hockey. In 1974, William McMurtry provided a report for the [[Government of Ontario]] entitled ''Investigation and Inquiry into Violence in Amateur Hockey''. In 2000, [[Bernie Pascall]] prepared a report for the [[Government of British Columbia]] entitled ''Eliminating Violence in Hockey''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hockeynanaimo.com/informationPDFs/WorkingPaper.pdf Violence, Not Part of Youth Hockey] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070821133720/http://www.hockeynanaimo.com/informationPDFs/WorkingPaper.pdf |date=2007-08-21 }}, pilot project working paper, [[Nanaimo]] Minor Hockey Association, September 10, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

==On-ice incidents resulting in charges==
*1905 – [[Allan Loney]] was charged with [[manslaughter]] in the on-ice clubbing death of [[Alcide Laurin]].  Loney claimed self-defence, and was found not guilty.&lt;ref&gt;McKinley, Michael: "Hockey: A People's History," page 27.  McClelland &amp; Stewart, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
*1907 – Ottawa Senators players [[Harry Smith (ice hockey)|Harry Smith]], [[Alf Smith (ice hockey)|Alf Smith]] and Charles Spittal were charged with assault after beating [[Montreal Wanderers]] players [[Hod Stuart]], Ernie "Moose" Johnson and [[Cecil Blatchford]] with their sticks.
*1907 – Ottawa Victorias player [[Charles Masson]] was charged with manslaughter after Cornwall player [[Owen McCourt]] died of a head wound sustained in a brawl.  Masson was found not guilty on the grounds that there was no way to know which blow had killed McCourt.&lt;ref&gt;McKinley, Michael: "Hockey: A People's History," page 28.  McClelland &amp; Stewart, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
*1922 – [[Sprague Cleghorn]] injured three Ottawa Senators players in a brawl, leading Ottawa police to offer to arrest him.
*1969 – In a pre-season game held in Ottawa, [[Ted Green]] of the Boston Bruins and [[Wayne Maki]] of the [[St. Louis Blues]] engaged in a violent, stick-swinging brawl. A fractured skull and brain damage caused Green to miss the entire [[1969–70 NHL season|1969–70 season]].&lt;ref name="lowlights"&gt;{{Harvnb|CBC Sports|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The NHL suspended Maki for 30 days and Green for 13 games. Both men were acquitted in court.
*1975 – [[Dan Maloney]] of the [[Detroit Red Wings]] was charged with [[assault]] causing bodily harm after he attacked [[Brian Glennie]] of the Toronto Maple Leafs from behind. In exchange for a no-contest plea, Maloney did community service work and was banned from playing in Toronto for two seasons.
*1975 – Police charged Bruins player [[Dave Forbes]] with [[Assault#Aggravated assault|aggravated assault]] after a fight with [[Henry Boucha]] of the [[Minnesota North Stars]]. After a nine-day trial ended with a hung jury, charges against Forbes were dropped. Boucha suffered blurred vision from the incident and never fully recovered.
*1976 – [[Philadelphia Flyers]] players [[Joe Watson (ice hockey)|Joe Watson]], [[Mel Bridgman]], [[Don Saleski]] and [[Bob "Hound" Kelly]] were charged with assault after using their hockey sticks as weapons in a violent playoff game between the Flyers and the Toronto Maple Leafs in which fans had been taunting the Flyers players and spitting at them. Bridgman was acquitted, but the other three Flyers were found guilty of simple assault.
*1976 – [[Calgary Cowboys]] forward [[Rick Jodzio]] plead guilty to a charge of assault following a cross-check to the head of [[Quebec Nordiques]] player [[Marc Tardif]] during the [[World Hockey Association]] (WHA) playoffs. The hit led to a 20-minute bench clearing brawl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Willes |first=Ed |year=2004 |title=The Rebel League |publisher=McClelland &amp; Stewart |isbn=0-7710-8947-3 |page=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*1977 – [[Tiger Williams|Dave "Tiger" Williams]] of the Toronto Maple Leafs hit the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]]' [[Dennis Owchar]] with his stick. He was charged with assault, but acquitted.
*1982 – [[Jimmy Mann (ice hockey)|Jimmy Mann]] of the [[Winnipeg Jets (1972–96)|Winnipeg Jets]] left the bench and sucker-punched Pittsburgh Penguin [[Paul Gardner (ice hockey)|Paul Gardner]], breaking Gardner's jaw in two places. Mann was fined $500 and given a suspended sentence in Winnipeg.
*1988 – [[Dino Ciccarelli]] hit Maple Leafs defenceman [[Luke Richardson]] with his stick. Charged and convicted of assault, he was sentenced to one day in jail and fined $1,000.
*1992 – [[Enrico Ciccone]] of the [[International Hockey League (1945–2001)|IHL]]'s [[Kalamazoo Wings (1974–2000)|Kalamazoo Wings]] was arrested on a battery charge after [[San Diego Gulls (1990–95)|San Diego Gulls]] photographer Essy Ghavameddini was cut and received a deep bruise below his left eye that required stitches. Ciccone assaulted him after entering the penalty box where Ghavameddini was photographing the game from.&lt;ref&gt;Arrest Mars Gulls Game. Los Angeles Times. 8 November 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;
*1998 – [[Jesse Boulerice]] of the [[Plymouth Whalers]] was suspended for the rest of the playoffs after violently swinging his stick at [[Guelph Storm]] forward Andrew Long. Boulerice was charged with assault as a result of the incident.
*2000 – [[Marty McSorley]] of the Boston Bruins hit [[Vancouver Canucks|Vancouver Canuck]] [[Donald Brashear]] in the head with his stick in the waning moments of the game, after losing a fight to Brashear earlier in the game. McSorley was convicted of assault with a weapon and given an 18-month conditional discharge.
*2004 – In the [[Todd Bertuzzi–Steve Moore incident]], Bertuzzi of the Vancouver Canucks [[sucker punch|sucker-punched]] [[Steve Moore (ice hockey)|Moore]] of the Colorado Avalanche in the back of the head, knocking him unconscious. The pair then fell to the ice with Bertuzzi's weight crushing Moore face-first into the ice, followed by several players from both teams further piling onto the [[mêlée]].  Moore sustained three fractured vertebrae, a [[Concussion#Grading systems|grade three concussion]], vertebral ligament damage, stretching of the brachial plexus nerves and facial lacerations. Bertuzzi was charged by police and given a conditional discharge after pleading guilty to assault causing bodily harm. His suspension resulted in a loss of $500,000 in pay and the Canucks were fined $250,000. Bertuzzi was re-instated in 2005, after a 20 game suspension and an international ban during the 2004-05 lockout season. A civil suit filed by Moore, seeking CAD$68 million in damages and loss of income, was settled on August 19, 2014. The terms of this settlement are confidential.
*2015 - During the warm up before a qualifier to the [[Swedish Hockey League|SHL]], [[André Deveaux]] from [[Rögle BK]] assaulted [[Västerås IK]]'s unsuspecting [[Per Helmersson]]. Deveaux swung his stick and slashed Helmersson twice. The attack was retaliation for a hit from behind by Helmersson in the game before, which Deveaux claimed caused him a minor concussion. Both players could complete both games, and Deveaux was only disciplined after the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sydsvenskan.se/2015-05-08/deveaux-jag-kommer-inte-att-be-om-ursakt|title=Deveaux: "Jag kommer inte att be om ursäkt"|author=|date=|website=sydsvenskan.se|accessdate=13 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/sportbladet/hockey/sverige/shl/rogle/article20546133.ab|title=Överfallet under uppvärmningen|author=|date=|website=aftonbladet.se|accessdate=13 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deveaux was charged for the attack, but the charges were later dropped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/sportbladet/hockey/sverige/allsvenskan/article21101116.ab|title=Andre Deveaux slipper åtal|author=|date=|website=aftonbladet.se|accessdate=13 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11621">'''Wall Street Reform''' or '''Financial Reform''' refers to reform of the financial industry and the [[Bank regulation in the United States|regulation]] of the financial industry in the [[United States]]. [[Wall Street]] is the home of the country's two largest [[stock exchange]]s, and "Wall Street" is a [[metonym]] for the American financial sector. Major Wall Street reform bills include the [[Federal Reserve Act]] of 1913, the [[Glass-Steagall Act]] of 1933, the [[Truth in Lending Act]] of 1968, the [[Community Reinvestment Act]] of 1977, the [[Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act]] of 1999, and the [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002]]. The most recent Wall Street reform bill, the [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]], was signed by [[President of the United States]] [[Barack Obama]] on July 22, 2010, following a [[Financial crisis of 2007–08|global financial crisis]].

== The Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 ==
The [[Glass-Steagall Act]] of 1933 placed a "wall of separation" between banks and brokerages, which was largely repealed by the [[Financial Services Modernization Act]] of 1999.  The bill was enacted during the [[Great Depression]], which began with the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]].  The [[Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act]] of 1999 repealed the "wall of separation," allowing companies to simultaneously act as [[commercial bank]]s, [[investment bank]]s, and [[insurance company|insurance companies]].  Though some commentators regard the restoration of the 1933 bill as crucial, even calling it "the most vital element of Wall Street reform",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.counterpunch.org/martens03262010.html|title=The Most Vital Ingredient in Wall Street Reform Goes Missing|author=Pam Martens|date=2010-03-26|publisher=CounterPunch}}&lt;/ref&gt; House Democratic leaders refused to allow an amendment by Rep. [[Maurice Hinchey]] (D-NY) to restore Glass-Steagall as part of the 2009 Frank bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenation.com/doc/20100111/scheer2|title=McCain Gets It, Obama Doesn't|author=Robert Scheer|publisher=The Nation|date=2010-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hinchey introduced his proposal as a separate bill, the Glass-Steagall Restoration Act of 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c111:H.R.4375:|title=[Text of H.R. 4375]|publisher=thomas.loc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nonetheless, the "Volcker rule" proposed by the Obama administration has been described as a "new Glass-Steagall Act for the 21st century", as it establishes stringent rules against banks using their own money to make risky investments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/jan/21/obama-banks-wall-street-reform|title=Obama announces dramatic crackdown on Wall Street banks: Obama's 'new Glass-Steagall Act' will prevent banks with customer deposits taking risky investment bets|author=Jill Treanor|publisher=The Guardian|date=2010-01-21 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 ==
The [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]], by Sen. [[Paul S. Sarbanes]] ([[Democratic Party of the United States|D]]-[[Maryland|MD]]) and Rep. [[Michael G. Oxley]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]-[[Ohio|OH]]), was signed into law by [[George W. Bush]] in July 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/forum/july02/b_ethics.html |title=Wall Street reform |date=August 2002 |publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080617084215/http://www.pbs.org/newshour/forum/july02/b_ethics.html |archivedate=June 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c107:H.R.3763:|title=[Text of H.R. 3763 (6 versions)]|publisher=thomas.loc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was enacted as a reaction to a number of major [[accounting scandals|corporate and accounting scandals]] including those affecting [[Enron]] and [[WorldCom]].

== Dodd-Frank (2010)==
{{Main|Obama financial regulatory reform plan of 2009}}

As of May 2010, both the House and Senate bills had been passed, but the differences between the bills were to be worked out in [[United States congressional conference committee]]. Differences which must be resolved include:&lt;ref&gt;Indiviglio D. (2010). [https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2010/05/the-conference-challenges-congress-faces-for-financial-reform/57241/ The Conference Challenges Congress Faces for Financial Reform]. ''The Atlantic''.&lt;/ref&gt;  whether the new consumer protection agency would be independent (Senate) or part of the [[Federal Reserve]];  whether to require banks to issue [[credit derivative]]s in separately capitalized [[subsidiary|affiliate]]s (Senate); how exactly the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] (FDIC) will wind down or bail out large institutions which fail; the circumstances under which large institutions could be broken up; a 15 to 1 leverage limit in the House bill; the terms of a Fed audit (continuous as in the House bill or one-time as in the Senate bill); both bills include the Volcker rule which prohibits [[proprietary trading]] by bank holding companies, but both have a caveat which allow for regulators to overrule the rule; both bills propose to regulate [[credit rating agencies]], but the Senate's bill is much stronger.

=== House bill ===
H.R. 4173, the [[Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]] of 2009 by Rep. [[Barney Frank]] ([[Democratic Party of the United States|D]]-[[Massachusetts|MA]]), passed by the House of Representatives in December 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c111:H.R.4173:|title=[Text of H.R. 4173 (3 versions)]|publisher=thomas.loc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; and awaiting action by the Senate as of April 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-h4173/show|title=H.R.4173 - Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2009|publisher=OpenCongress.org|accessdate=2010-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/12/18/barney-frank-vs-the-credi_n_397404.html|title=Barney Frank Vs. The Credit Raters (VIDEO)|author=Ben Protess|publisher=Huffington Post Investigative Fund|date=2009-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Senate bill ===
{{Further|Restoring American Financial Stability Act of 2010}}
[[S.3217]] was introduced by [[Senate Banking Committee]] chairman [[Chris Dodd]] ([[Democratic Party of the United States|D]]-[[Connecticut|CT]]) on April 15, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c111:S.3217:|title=[Text of S.3217]|publisher=thomas.loc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dodd's bill included a $50 billion liquidation fund which drew criticism as a continuing bailout, which he was pressured to remove by Republicans and the Obama administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2010/04/17/white-house-signals-shift-on-wall-street-reform/|title=White House signals shift on Wall Street reform|date=2010-04-17|author=CNN Senior White House Correspondent [[Ed Henry]]|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Senate bill passed on May 20, 2010.

=== Volcker Rule ===
{{Further|Volcker Rule}}
The "Volcker Rule" was proposed by President [[Barack Obama]] based on advice by [[Paul Volcker]], and a draft of the proposed legislation was prepared by the [[U.S. Treasury Department]].  It limited any one bank from holding more than 10% of FDIC-insured deposits, and prohibited any bank with a division holding such deposits from using its own capital to make speculative investments.  The Volcker rule faced heavy resistance in the Senate and was introduced as part of the subsequent Dodd bill only in a limited form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703503804575083823511212204|title='Volcker Rule' Stalls in Senate|publisher=Wall Street Journal|author=Damian Palmetta|date=2010-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6224B920100303|title=Obama reasserts Volcker rule|author1=Kevin Drawbaugh  |author2=Karey Wutkowski |lastauthoramp=yes |date=2010-03-03|publisher=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE62E5IZ20100315|title=Factbox: Key elements of Dodd's financial reform bill|publisher=Reuters|date=2010-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Financial Stability Oversight Council ===

Chaired by the [[United States Secretary of the Treasury]], a new multi-authority oversight body called the Financial Stability Oversight Council of regulators will be established. The council will consist of nine members including regulators from the [[Federal Reserve System]], [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]], [[Federal Housing Finance Agency]], and many other agencies.  The main purpose of the council is to identify risk in the [[Financial system]]. Also, the council will look at the interconnectivity of the highly leveraged financial firms and can ask companies to divest holdings if their structure poses a great threat to the Financial system. The council will have a solid control on the operations of the leveraged firms and also help in increasing the transparency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-07-15/congressional-overhaul-maps-the-future-of-financial-regulation.html|title='Congressional Overhaul Maps the Future of Financial Regulation'|publisher=Bloomberg Businessweek|author1=David Scheer |author2=Gregory Mott |author3=Lawrence Roberts |date=2010-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wall Street Reform Plan (2016) for a new 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act ==

In 2016, 170 Economists, Financial Experts, and Academics Back Bernie Sanders' Wall Street Reform Plan. In the letter supporting Bernie Sander's Financial Reform Plan &lt;ref&gt;[https://berniesanders.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Wall-St-Letter-1.pdf], Economists and Financial Experts in Favor of Sen. Sanders' Wall St. Reforms&lt;/ref&gt;

''"In our view, Sen. Bernie Sanders' plan for comprehensive financial reform is critical for avoiding another "too-big-to-fail" financial crisis. The Senator is correct that the biggest banks must be broken up and that a new 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act, separating investment from commercial banking, must be enacted.
Wall Street's largest banks are now far bigger than they were before the crisis, and they still have every incentive to take excessive risks. No major Wall Street executive has been indicted for the fraudulent behavior that led up to the 2008 crash, and fines imposed on the banks have been only a fraction of the banks' potential gains. In addition, the banks and their lobbyists have succeeded in watering down the Dodd-Frank reform legislation, and the financial institutions that pose the greatest risk to our economy have still not devised sufficient "living wills" for winding down their operations in the event of another crisis.
Secretary Hillary Clinton's more modest proposals do not go far enough. They call for a bit more oversight and a few new charges on shadow banking activity, but they leave intact the titanic financial conglomerates that practice most shadow banking. As a result, her plan does not adequately reduce the serious risks our financial system poses to the American economy and to individual Americans. Given the size and political power of Wall Street, her proposals would only invite more dilution and finagle. The only way to contain Wall Street's excesses is with reforms sufficiently bold and public they can't be watered down. That's why we support Senator Sanders' plans for busting up the biggest banks and resurrecting a modernized version of Glass Steagall."''
