The '''1 kroon coin''' was put in circulation from 1 August 1934 to 25 March 1941, during the first independence period of Estonia. The exact number of coins minted is not known, as part of the archives was destroyed in the war, but some data indicate that about 3,406,066 pieces were struck. Between 1935 and 1936, 1,586,000 1 kroon coins were minted. Designed by graphic artist [[Günther Reindorff]], it depicts the image of a 13th-century Viking cargo ship.

==Monetary reform==
With the Estonian monetary reform in January 1928 the law was changed as the [[Riigikogu]] had an amendment made to the law which stated that coins of 1 and 2 krooni could be minted in other metals, not only in silver as had been the case. As the silver coins of previous coinage had been too expensive, it was decided that this requirement would have to be eliminated. The corresponding change in the law came into effect on 24 March 1934.&lt;ref name="Eesti Bank21"&gt;{{et icon}} {{cite book|last=Eesti Bank|title=EESTI KROON I|year=2010|publisher=Eesti Bank|pages=21|url=http://www.eestipank.ee/sites/default/files/files/EestiPank/muuseum/margast_euroni.pdf?ok=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As published by the [[Riigi Teataja]], the Economics Department of the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Estonia announced that the Money Amendment Act (RT 30 of 1933) §§ 4 and 5, allowed the Economics Department of the Ministry of Finance to put in circulation the one-kroon coin as of 1 August 1934. The shape, dimensions, hardness, and metal composition amended within the meaning of the Act remained as such according to the law, but had yet to be approved by the government.&lt;ref name="Keller"/&gt;

On 25 November 1940, the [[Occupation of the Baltic states]] by the Soviet authorities put into circulation the [[ruble]], and on 25 March 1941, three months before the outbreak of the war with the Third Reich, the Estonian crown was withdrawn from circulation. During the German (1941-1944) and Soviet (1944-1991) occupation of Estonia, foreign currency introduced by the occupiers remained in circulation.&lt;ref name="Eesti Bank23"&gt;{{et icon}} {{cite book|last=Eesti Bank|title=EESTI KROON I|year=2010|publisher=Eesti Bank|pages=23–24|url=http://www.eestipank.ee/sites/default/files/files/EestiPank/muuseum/margast_euroni.pdf?ok=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Designing==
As in the case of the Estonian Mark, the Bank of Estonia announced a competition for the design of new banknotes and coins to be held on 4 June 1926.&lt;ref name="Eesti Bank17"&gt;{{et icon}} {{cite book|last=Eesti Bank|title=EESTI KROON I|year=2010|publisher=Eesti Bank|pages=17|url=http://www.eestipank.ee/sites/default/files/files/EestiPank/muuseum/margast_euroni.pdf?ok=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The competition was attended by many well-known artists of the period such as [[Eduard Wiiralt]], Peet Aren, Roman Nyman, and [[Nikolai Triik]].&lt;ref name="Eesti Bank17"/&gt; The winner was graphic artist [[Günther Reindorff]], who had already designed the coins for the Estonian mark.&lt;ref name="Eesti Bank17"/&gt;

Coined in aluminum-bronze, the coin shows a golden color and weighs 6 grams (permissible error of ± 1%),&lt;ref name=Dotan&gt;{{cite book|last=Dotan|first=Yossi|title=Europe 1800-2005|year=2007|publisher=Sussex Academic Press|isbn=1898595496|pages=30|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JYbfLM3AIi4C&amp;pg=PA30&amp;dq=1934+1+kroon#v=onepage&amp;q=1934%201%20kroon&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; has a diameter of 2.525 inches (± 0.5%),&lt;ref name=Dotan/&gt; with value equivalent to 0.4032 grams of gold,&lt;ref name=Kooli&gt;{{cite web|last=Kooli|first=Holstre|title=Meenutusi Eesti kroonist|url=http://holstrekool.blogspot.com.br/2011_02_01_archive.html|publisher=Holstrekool|accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; being its edge smooth. The obverse of the coin bears in the center a large state seal, the [[coat of arms of Estonia]], topped with an arc-shaped text which reads "[[Estonia|Eesti Vabariik]]", and the year of issue "1934" at the bottom edge. The reverse depicts the Viking ship [[knarr]] (knorr) at sea,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Moneta gallery coin museum|title=Estonia 1 Kroon - Knorr|url=http://www.moneta-coins.com/photopost/showphoto.php?photo=1406&amp;title=estonia-1-kroonknorr&amp;cat=646|publisher=Moneta|accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; under which the inscription 1 kroon appears.&lt;ref name=Keller&gt;{{cite news|last=Keller|first=A.|title=Department of Economics of the Ministry of Finance|date=26 July 1934 |publisher=Nr. 123/L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coins with the same design were minted in 1990, but they are not legal tender, having been produced as souvenirs. One version is even less original, having a diameter of only 16&amp;nbsp;mm and on the front the inscription "Eesti" instead of "Eesti Vabariik".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Coins of Estonia: At the threshold of the monetary reform|url=http://unusualcoins.ee/Moneti%20Estonii/noname63-1.htm|publisher=unusualcoins.ee|accessdate=4 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These coins are both made of gold as well as silver. Another re-issued version of the coin is about its original size, but the quality of the parts&lt;!--what parts--&gt; is much worse.

In 2012, the 1934 one-kroon coin was voted "the prettiest coin ever to be in circulation in Estonia".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1934 Kroon Crowned King of Coins in Contest|url=http://news.err.ee/culture/77f5f597-4002-4110-9cb7-7e694b651c97|publisher=[[Eesti Rahvusringhääling]]|accessdate=4 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AP Studio art.jpg|thumb|AP Studio Art is an advanced drawing and painting course. ]]
'''AP Studio Art''' is a series of [[Advanced Placement]] [[Course (education)|Course]]s divided into three different categories: AP Studio Art Drawing, AP Studio Art 2D Design, and AP Studio Art 3D Design.

==The portfolio==

Unlike traditional AP Exams that utilize a [[multiple-choice]] section, [[free response]] section, and occasionally an [[Audiobook|audio]] section, the AP Studio Art Exam is a [[Career portfolio|portfolio]] that encompasses 3 different categories: Quality, Concentration, and Breadth.  Depending on the AP Studio Art exam the person is taking, the components for each of the 3 categories will vary.  Regardless of the exam, all AP Studio Art portfolios have to be turned in by a set date and time, for example, 12:00pm on May 11, 2007 for the 2007 exam.

==AP Studio Art Drawing==

AP Studio Art Drawing is an [[Advanced Placement|advanced placement]] course that deals with basic [[painting]] and [[drawing]]. Focus is applied on the [[composition (visual arts)|composition]] of the different [[wikt:line|line]]s/[[colors]]/[[shape]]/etc... of the painting instead of the design itself. Originally called AP Studio Art, it was later changed to AP Studio Art Drawing.

===Portfolio===

*'''Section I: Quality:''' A student submits 5 actual [[Visual arts|artwork]] to the AP College Board that represent the student's [[Quality (business)|quality]] of technique and their design concepts.
*'''Section II: Concentration:''' A student submits 12 different slides that demonstrate the student's ability to paint and draw a variety of pieces that relate to 1 idea. These are arranged in a special order on slide coverings from [[College Board]]. Starting 2009, an online application replaced the use of physical slides and associated documents.
*'''Section III: Breadth:''' A student submits 12 additional and different slides that demonstrate the student's ability to incorporate [[drawing]] techniques and issues that include drawing from [[observation]], work with [[Inversive geometry|inverted]] or [[nonobjective]] [[Form (visual art)|forms]], effective use of [[light]] and [[shading|shade]], [[wikt:line|line]] quality, surface [[wikt:manipulate|manipulation]], composition, various spatial systems, and expressive mark-making.&lt;ref name="guide"&gt;{{cite web | year = 2004 | url = http://www.collegeboard.com/prod_downloads/ap/students/studioart/ap04_sg_studioart.pdf | title = AP Studio Art Scoring Guidelines | format = PDF | publisher = [[College Board]] | accessdate = 2006-05-13| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060421002604/http://www.collegeboard.com/prod_downloads/ap/students/studioart/ap04_sg_studioart.pdf| archivedate= 21 April 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are arranged similar to Section II.  Starting 2009, an online application replaced the use of physical slides and associated documents.

===Grade distribution===

In the 2016 administration, 18,407 students took the exam with 21 students earning a perfect score of 72/72.

==AP Studio Art 2D==

AP Studio Art 2D is an [[Advanced Placement|advanced placement]] course that is similar to AP Studio Art Drawing. It deals with [[two-dimensional]] applications such as [[graphic design]], [[photography]], [[weaving]], and [[collage]]. As a contrary to AP Studio Art Drawing, focus is applied on the [[design]] itself instead of the composition of the artwork.

===Portfolio===

*'''Section I: Quality:''' A student submits 5 actual artwork that represents the student's [[Quality (business)|quality]] of designing pieces in [[2D geometric model|2D]].
*'''Section II: Concentration:''' A student submits 12 different slides that demonstrate the student's ability to make a variety of pieces in 2D that relate to 1 [[idea]]. These are arranged in a special order on slide coverings from [[College Board]]. Starting 2009, an online application replaced the use of physical slides and associated documents.
*'''Section III: Breadth:''' A student submits 12 additional and different slides that demonstrate the student's ability to incorporate 2D [[Design principle]]s that include unity/variety, [[Equilibrioception|balance]], [[Cultural emphasis|emphasis]], [[contrast (vision)|contrast]], [[rhythm]], [[wikt:repetition|repetition]], [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportion]]/[[scale (ratio)|scale]], and figure-ground relationship.&lt;ref name="guide" /&gt; These are arranged similar to Section II. Starting 2009, an online application replaced the use of physical slides and associated documents.

===Grade distribution===

In the 2012 administration 23,591 students took the exam with a mean score of 3.28.

==AP Studio Art 3D==

AP Studio Art 3D is a [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] [[Advanced Placement]] Studio Art course that holds many similarities to the AP Studio Art 2D course. The course deals with [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] artistic applications such as [[metalworking]], [[sculpture]], [[computer model|model]], and [[Ceramics (art)|ceramics]]. Like AP Studio Art 2D, the focus on the [[design]] of the artwork itself as opposed to its composition.

===Portfolio===

*'''Section I: Quality:''' The actual work for this exam is [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] and not flat, so transporting it directly to [[College Board|The College Board]] could cause damage to the artwork and the pieces would most likely not fit in portfolios. Because of this, five pieces of artwork are shown in ten slides to showcase the [[Quality (business)|quality]] of the student's [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] pieces.
*'''Section II: Concentration:''' 12 different slides are submitted to demonstrate the student's ability to produce a variety of pieces that relate to a single [[idea]]. The slides are arranged in slide coverings in an order designated by [[College Board|The College Board]]. Starting 2009, an online application replaced the use of physical slides and associated documents, and the student was allowed to determine the order of the works in their concentration.
*'''Section III: Breadth:''' Eight different works are shown in 16 slides which are meant to demonstrate the student's ability to incorporate a variety of different [[3D Design]] principles, including unity/variety, [[Equilibrioception|balance]], [[Cultural emphasis|emphasis]], [[contrast (vision)|contrast]], [[rhythm]], [[wikt:repetition|repetition]], [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportion]]/[[Scale (ratio)|scale]], and figure/ground relationship.&lt;ref name="guide" /&gt; Similar to Section II, this section's slides are also arranged in an order designated by [[College Board|The College Board]]. Starting 2009, an online application replaced the use of physical slides and associated documents.

===Grade distribution===

In the 2012 administration 3,840 students took the exam with a mean score of 3.00.

[[Image:Peones.gif|frame|An example of a rendered [[animation]]]]
'''Rendering''' in [[visual art]] and [[technical drawing]] means the process of formulating,  adding [[color]], [[shading]], and [[texture (visual arts)|texturing]] of an image. It can also be used to describe the quality of execution of that process. When used as a means of expression, it is synonymous with [[illustrating]]. However, it may be used for mere [[Visualization (computer graphics)|visualization]] of existing [[data]] regardless of any preconceived message or idea to express. Rendering is also a technique that can be used while designing packaging and branding. 

The alternative method to rendering an image is capturing an image such as [[photography]] or [[image scanning]]. Both rendered and captured images can be [[Mixed_media|mixed]], [[image editing|edited]], or both.

==Rendering style==
'''Artistic rendering''' is the application of [[style (visual arts)|visual art style]]s to rendering. For [[photorealistic]] rendering styles, the emphasis is on accurate reproduction of light-and-shadow and the surface properties of the depicted objects, [[composition (visual arts)|composition]], or other more generic qualities. When the emphasis is on unique interpretive rendering styles, visual information is interpreted by the artist and displayed accordingly using the chosen [[art medium]] and level of [[abstraction]] in [[abstract art]].  In [[computer graphics]], interpretive rendering  styles are known as [[non-photorealistic rendering]] styles, but may be used to simplify [[technical illustration]]s. Rendering styles that combine photorealism with non-photorealism are known as [[Hyperrealism (visual arts)|hyperrealistic]] rendering styles.

'''Black MIDI''' is a music genre consisting of compositions that use [[MIDI]] files to create a song remix containing a large number of notes, typically in the thousands or millions, and sometimes billions. People who make black MIDIs are known as '''blackers'''. However, there are no specific criteria of what is considered "black"; as a result, finding an exact origin of black MIDI is impossible.

==Origins and early history==
Though the two are unrelated in origin, the concept of impossible piano existed long before black MIDI, manifesting itself within [[Conlon Nancarrow]]'s work involving player pianos where he punched holes in piano cards, creating extremely complex musical compositions in the same impossible, unplayable spirit of black MIDI.&lt;ref name="Rhizome" /&gt; 

Black MIDI was first employed in Shirasagi Yukki at Kuro Yuki Gohan's rendition of "U.N. Owen Was Her?", an extra boss theme from the ''[[Touhou Project]]'' shooter video game series.&lt;ref name = "NewMusicBox"&gt;{{cite web|last=Reising|first=Sam|date=April 15, 2015|url=http://www.newmusicbox.org/articles/the-opposite-of-brain-candy-decoding-black-midi/|title=The Opposite of Brain Candy—Decoding Black MIDI|work=[[NewMusicBox]]|accessdate=March 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was uploaded to the site [[Nico Nico Douga]] in 2009, and public awareness of Black MIDI started to spread from Japan to China and Korea in the following two years.&lt;ref name = "NewMusicBox"/&gt; In its beginning years, Black MIDIs were represented visually with traditional, two-stave piano sheet music,&lt;ref name = "NewMusicBox"/&gt; contained a number of notes only in the thousands. They were created with MIDI sequencers such as Music Studio Producer, and Singer Song Writer, and played through MIDI players such as MAMPlayer and [[Timidity++]].&lt;ref name = "Thump"&gt;{{cite web|last=Earp|first=Matt|date=December 30, 2013|url=https://thump.vice.com/en_us/article/meet-the-15-year-old-prince-of-black-midi|title=Meet the 15-Year-Old Boy King of Black MIDI|publisher=Thump. [[Vice Media]]|accessdate=March 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Black MIDI community in Japan vanished quickly because, according to Jason Nguyen (owner of the channel Gingeas), the group was “analogous to those TV shows where there’s a mysterious founder of a civilization that is not really known throughout the course of the show.”&lt;ref name = "NewMusicBox"/&gt;

==Popularity outside Japan==
The popularity of Black MIDI transitioned into Europe and the United States&lt;ref name = "Thump"/&gt; due to a video of a composition uploaded by Kakakakaito1998 in February 2011, and shortly thereafter, blackers from around the world began pushing limits of the style by making compositions with notes increasing into the millions and using an enormous number of colors and patterns to match the complexity of the notes.&lt;ref name = "NewMusicBox"/&gt; They also formed the sites Guide to Black MIDI and Official Black MIDI Wikia that introduced and set the norm of Black MIDI.&lt;ref name = "NewMusicBox"/&gt; 

The first of these tracks to reach the million-note mark was that of “Necrofantasia” from [[Touhou Project]] by TheTrustedComputer.&lt;ref name = "Thump"/&gt; The end of the title of many Black MIDI videos displays how many notes are in the piece.&lt;ref name = "Newsweek"/&gt; The number of notes and file sizes that could be played back have grown with the rising amount of processing and 64-bit programs computers are able to handle,&lt;ref name = "NewMusicBox"/&gt;  and while Black MIDIs of Japanese video game music and [[anime]] are still common,&lt;ref name = "Thump"/&gt; the genre has also begun spilling into modern-day pop songs, such as "[[Wrecking Ball (Miley Cyrus song)|Wrecking Ball]]" by [[Miley Cyrus]].&lt;ref name = "NewMusicBox"/&gt; Despite this increased computer storage, there are still Black MIDI files that could cause an operating system to slow down.&lt;ref name = "PhoenixNewTimes"/&gt; The two largest black MIDIs are "Armageddon v3" and "TheTrueEnd," both of which contain the maximum number of notes allowed in the MIDI standard (about 93 trillion). Due to the nature of their creation and their sheer size, they are unable to be played back and recorded.

English-language blackers have formed collaboration groups, such as the Black MIDI Team, where they make MIDI files and visuals together so they can be uploaded online sooner.&lt;ref name = "NewMusicBox"/&gt; Blackers around the world have used software such as Synthesia, [[FL Studio]], [[SynthFont]], Virtual MIDI Piano Keyboard, Piano From Above, MIDITrail, vanBasco Karaoke Player, MIDIPlayer (Java program), MAMPlayer, Music Studio Producer, Singer Song Writer, Tom's MIDI Player, TMIDI, and Timidity++ to create Black MIDIs.&lt;ref name = "Thump"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Newsweek"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sheets|first=Connor|date=November 14, 2013|url=http://www.newsweek.com/black-midi-will-overload-your-brain-and-your-computer-3261|title=Black MIDI Will Overload Your Brain – And Your Computer|work=[[Newsweek]]|accessdate=March 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of them, like Jason, record the MIDI files at a slow tempo and then speed the footage in video-editing to avoid RAM and processing issues.&lt;ref name = "NewMusicBox"/&gt;

==Analysis and reception==
The term "black MIDI" is derived from how there are so many notes in each piece that the score would look nearly black on traditional sheet music.&lt;ref name = "Rhizome"/&gt; According to [[California]]-based blacker TheTrustedComputer, black MIDI was intended as more of a remix style than an actual genre, and derived from the idea of "bullet hell" [[shoot 'em up]] games, which involved "so many bullets at a time your eyes can't keep up."&lt;ref name = "Thump"/&gt; Black MIDI has also been considered the digital equivalent, as well as a response, to composer [[Conlon Nancarrow]]'s use of the [[player piano]] which also involved experimenting with several thick notes to compose intricate pieces without hands.&lt;ref name = "NewMusicBox"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Rhizome"&gt;{{cite web|last=Conner|first=Michael|date=September 23, 2013|url=http://rhizome.org/editorial/2013/sep/23/impossible-music-black-midi/|title=The Impossible Music of Black MIDI|publisher=Rhizome|accessdate=March 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "PhoenixNewTimes"&gt;{{cite web|last=Farah|first=Troy|date=October 2, 2014|url=http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/music/what-is-black-midi-and-what-does-it-want-with-your-soul-6587142|title=What is Black MIDI And What Does It Want With Your Soul?|work=[[Phoenix New Times]]|publisher=[[Voice Media Group]]|accessdate=March 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Guide to Black MIDI, however, denies this influence: “We believe that references to Conlon Nancarrow and piano rolls are too deep and Black MIDI origins must be found in digital MIDI music world [''sic'']."&lt;ref name = "NewMusicBox"/&gt; 

Black MIDI first received coverage by Michael Connor, a writer for the non-profit arts organization Rhizome, in September 2013,&lt;ref name = "Rhizome"/&gt; leading to attention from publications and bloggers including [[Aux (TV channel)|Aux]],&lt;ref name = "Aux"&gt;{{cite web|last=Munro|first=Tyler|date=January 20, 2014|url=http://www.aux.tv/2014/01/black-midi-songs-will-kill-brain-computer/|title=Black MIDI songs will kill your brain and your computer|publisher=[[Aux (TV channel)|Aux]]|accessdate=March 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gawker]]'s [[Adrian Chen]],&lt;ref name="Gawker"&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Adrian Chen|Chen, Adrian]] |date=September 23, 2013 |url=http://gawker.com/black-midi-is-insane-but-totally-mesmerizing-robot-mu-1373444675 |title='Black Midi' Is Insane but Totally Mesmerizing Robot Music |publisher=[[Gawker]].

[[File:Blue Morpho in its jungle seclusion.JPG|thumb|Blue Morpho Ayahuasca center]]
'''Blue Morpho Ayahuasca center''' is an [[ayahuasca]] shamanism center in the [[Amazon rainforest|Amazon]] [[jungle]]. Blue Morpho, established in 2002, is located on the [[Iquitos]]–[[Nauta]] Road at kilometer 53, one hour away by road from the city of Iquitos, [[Peru]].

== About ==
Blue Morpho was founded by its owner, Hamilton Souther,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1889631,00.html|title=Down the Amazon in Search of Ayahuasca|author=John Otis|date=8 April 2009|work=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a center for shamanism 300 kilometers from the city of Iquitos in the Peruvian Amazon [[rain forest]]. Blue Morpho currently has two master shamans (maestros) working in the camp, Hamilton Souther, and Don Alberto Torres Davila, as well as several apprentice shamans and a staff of over ten native Peruvians. Blue Morpho maintains its connection and roots to traditional shamanic practices through the presence of Don Alberto Torres Davila. He heads the mesa of shamans (group of shamans from the same lineage) which includes Hamilton Souther. Hamilton Souther was trained under master shamans Don Julio Llerena Pinedo and Don Alberto Torres Davila, starting in 2001 through 2006, at which time he was granted the status of maestro by his mentors. Don Julio is deceased and has passed his legacy to Don Alberto. Hamilton and Don Alberto have practiced together for over 10 years.

The center consists of 13 buildings of traditional native [[architecture]], all constructed by locals using raw materials from the jungle.

== History ==
[[File:Hamilton Souther holding a large trunk of Ayahuasca.JPG|thumb|Hamilton Souther]]
Hamilton Souther completed a degree in anthropology from the [[University of Colorado]] in 2000. In 2001, he left his [[California]] home and traveled to Peru. Later that year, he studied ayahuasca shamanism under various Peruvian shamans on the [[Aucayacu River]] in the Amazon rain forest, approximately 24 hours away from Iquitos, Peru, by boat.

Then, in 2002, Souther began apprenticing with Don Alberto Torres Davila and Don Julio Llerena Pinedo, two [[medicine men]] in the area. Souther constructed a camp nearby, where he would live during his studies. It soon became clear to him that many Westerners would benefit from similar spiritual work, so he established Blue Morpho, named after the bright blue [[Morpho menelaus|Amazonian butterfly of the same name]]. With its inception, Souther began guiding guests on the 24-hour trip by boat from Iquitos deep into the jungle. As more guests arrived, he added greater [[infrastructure]] to accommodate their needs.

On November 16th 2018, the head shaman and General Manager of Blue Morpho, Malcolm Rossiter, apparently committed suicide by jumping from the balcony of his apartment in Lima, Peru. He had left a suicide note on his Facebook page indicating that he intended to kill himself.

[[André-Charles Boulle]]’s masterpieces are now mostly in museums and have come to represent the wealth, luxury and finesse of the court of Louis XIV, the [[Sun King]].

The '''Bridgwater Science Festival''' is a [[science festival]] which takes place in [[Bridgwater]], in the English county of [[Somerset]] in the May half term holiday, contributing to the [[public awareness of science]] for the local population.

==Introduction and History==
The ''Bridgwater Science Festival'' was set up in 2013 with the first Festival taking place in 2014, supported by the [[Institute of Physics]] (South West branch) and Futures for Somerset.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Blacklock|first1=Daisy|title=Bridgwater's first-ever Science Festival well underway|url=http://www.somersetcountygazette.co.uk/leisure/whats_on/11240596.Bridgwater_s_first_ever_Science_Festival_well_underway/|accessdate=14 October 2015|work=Somerset County Gazette|ref=blacklock}}&lt;/ref&gt; The festival held its second event in 2015 at Bridgwater Town Hall, supported by [[Bridgwater Town Council]], [[University of the West of England]] and Institute of Physics.

==Programme==
The Bridgwater Science Festival aims to attract as wide an audience as possible in entertaining, inspiring and engaging science-based activities. It is a community event with the emphasis on getting children and their families to experience fun, hands-on activities.

==Festival History==

===2015===
The main 'Family Fun Day' acted as the opening event in 2015, and moved to the Town Hall. Many more people attended the event than the previous year. Notable participants included:
*[[University of the West of England]] Science Communication Unit
*UWE Centre for Transport and Society with information on Bristol's self-driving car project
*[[Bristol Robotics Laboratory]] Tangible Networks project
*Reptile handling
*Space Detectives - space themed workshop

'''Builg''' is the name given to an ancient people who may have lived in southern [[Ireland]], around the modern city of [[Cork (city)|Cork]]. 

According to the historical scheme proposed by [[T. F. O'Rahilly]] the Builg are identical with or a sub-group of the [[Érainn]] or [[Iverni]], who arrived in Ireland ca 500 BC and are attested in [[Ptolemy]]'s 2nd century AD ''Geography''. In O'Rahilly's view, they spoke a [[P-Celtic]] language known as [[Ivernic]].

Their name may be related to both that of the [[Belgae]] of [[Gaul]] and [[Roman Britain]], and that of the [[Fir Bolg]] of [[Irish mythology]].

The '''Bunuban languages''' (or '''Bunaban''') are a small [[language family|family]] of [[Australian Aboriginal languages]] spoken in northern Australia. The family consists of two languages, '''[[Bunuba language|Bunuba]]''' and '''[[Gooniyandi language|Gooniyandi]]''', which are related to each other to about the same degree that English is related to Dutch. Bunuba has about 100 speakers and Gooniyandi about 400. Both are [[endangered languages|endangered]].

'''Cast coinage''' refers to [[coin]]s made by pouring melted metal into a mold, i.e. casting. It has been used for regular coins, particularly in the Far East, but also on a smaller scale. (e.g.: the ancient Mediterranean world.) The method differs from the current mode of coin production, which is done by striking coin blanks that have been cut out of metal sheets. The method has also been used by forgers.

Traditional Far Eastern cast coins—so-called '[[cash (Chinese coin)|cash]] coins'—are the most famous example of cast coinage, and were issued from the 4th century BC until circa 1912, predominantly in [[bronze]], [[brass]] or [[iron]]. Traditional Far Eastern coins were generally cast base metal coins, although [[silver]] and [[gold]] bars were also manufactured, e.g. Chinese sycee, Japanese obans and kobans, and Vietnamese lang and tien.

Cast [[potin]]s circulated in Kent from around 100 BC to around 50 BC.&lt;ref name=jersey20&gt;{{cite book |last=De Jersey |first=Philip |date=1996 |title=Celtic Coinage in Britain |publisher=Shire Publications |page=20 |isbn=0-7478-0325-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jersey21&gt;{{cite book |last=De Jersey |first=Philip |date=1996 |title=Celtic Coinage in Britain |publisher=Shire Publications |page=21 |isbn=0-7478-0325-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jersey14&gt;{{cite book |last=De Jersey |first=Philip |date=1996 |title=Celtic Coinage in Britain |publisher=Shire Publications |page=14 |isbn=0-7478-0325-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a point during the first century of the Christian era, cast bronze coins were produced in Dorset with archaeological evidence pointing towards [[Hengistbury Head]] as the source.&lt;ref name=jersey43&gt;{{cite book |last=De Jersey |first=Philip |date=1996 |title=Celtic Coinage in Britain |publisher=Shire Publications |page=43 |isbn=0-7478-0325-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''code-talker paradox'''  is a situation in which a [[language]] prevents communication.  As an issue in [[linguistics]], the [[paradox]] raises questions about the fundamental nature of languages. As such, the paradox is a problem in [[philosophy of language]]. 

The term code-talker paradox was coined in 2001 by [[Mark Baker (linguist)|Mark Baker]] to describe the Navajo code talking used during [[World War II]]. [[Code talkers]] are able to create a language [[mutually intelligible]] to each other but completely unintelligible to everyone who does not know the code. This causes a conflict of interests without actually causing any conflict at all. In the case of Navajo code-talkers, [[cryptanalysts]] were unable to decode messages in [[Navajo Language|Navajo]], even when using the most sophisticated methods available. At the same time, the code talkers were able to encrypt and decrypt messages quickly and easily by translating them into and from Navajo. Thus the code talker paradox refers to how human languages can be so similar and different at once: so similar that one can learn them both and gain the ability to translate from one to the other, yet so different that if someone knows one language but does not know another, it is not always possible to derive the meaning of a text by analyzing it or infer it from the other language.

Baker solves the paradox with the theory of [[universal grammar]]. Within universal grammar, there are certain parameters that are shared by all languages. Languages differ from one another in that a given parameter may have different settings across languages. The number of possible combinations of parameter settings accounts for the diversity of human languages, and the fact that every human brain is wired to process the same parameters means that to learn a new language, the brain simply adapts what it already knows. The brain recognizes the parameters of the first language to which it was exposed and when it processes a different language, it simply changes the values of corresponding parameters. Hence human languages vary greatly from one to the other, yet each human has the theoretical capacity to learn, converse in, and translate to and from, any human language.

In some universities in the [[United Kingdom]] and Ireland — particularly [[Collegiate university|collegiate universities]] such as [[Oxford University|Oxford]] and [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]], as well as [[Dublin University]], [[Durham University]], [[University of York]], [[University of Kent]] and [[Lancaster University]]— students and the academic body are  organised into a '''[[common room]]''', or at Cambridge a '''combination room'''. These groups exist to provide representation in the organisation of college or [[halls of residence|residential hall]] life, to operate certain services within these institutions such as laundry or recreation, and to provide opportunities for socialising. Typically, though there are variations based on institutional tradition and needs, the following common rooms will exist in a college or hall: Outside the UK, the terms JCR, MCR, and SCR are used by [[Harvard University]], [[Yale University]], [[Princeton University]], and the [[University of Toronto]].

Walker| publisher=[[Queens' College, Cambridge|Queens' College]], [[University of Cambridge]], UK|date=1991–1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to this, each of the above phrases may also refer to an [[common room|actual room]] designated for the use of these groups. At the University of Cambridge, the term ''combination room'' (e.g., "Junior Combination Room") is also used, with the same abbreviations. As a generalisation, JCRs are associations of [[undergraduate]]s and SCRs an association of [[tutor]]s and [[academic]]s associated with a college. [[Postgraduate]]s are sometimes given their own MCR, or placed in with either of the other groups. This terminology has, in addition, been taken up in some universities in other [[english language|English]] speaking nations.

== Examples ==
The terms JCR, MCR and SCR originated from the [[University of Oxford]] and the [[University of Cambridge]]. The terms are now used at ten British universities as well as [[Trinity College, Dublin]] in [[Ireland]], [[Harvard College]] in the [[United States of America]] and at the [[University of Trinity College]] in the [[University of Toronto]], [[Canada]]. Due to the way that the terms have evolved over time and the [[idiosyncratic]] nature of university structure, the use of the three terms varies considerably from institution to institution. The main variations involve terminology, [[mature students]] and [[postgraduate education|postgraduate students]].

In addition to this, the terms may be used to refer to the elected groups that run the common rooms. Other names such as "Exec" may exist for these.

== United Kingdom ==

===Oxford===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Oriel College]] --&gt;
At the [[University of Oxford]], a typical college has a Junior Common Room (JCR) for undergraduates, a Middle Common Room (MCR) for graduates and a Senior Common Room (SCR)&lt;ref name="src-chch" /&gt; for its fellows. JCRs and MCRs have a committee, with a president and so on, that represent their students to college authorities, [[Oxford University Student Union]] (OUSU), etc., in addition to being an actual room for the use of members. SCRs typically have a President, an academic member of the body who deals with higher-level administrative matters pertaining to the SCR, such as inviting proposed visiting fellows to the body and identifying invited lecturers to any particular college event. SCRs are typically characterised by a copious provision of coffee, newspapers, and moderately informal space for academics to think and discuss ideas.

[[Wadham College]] is a notable exception: although it maintains an MCR, its entire student population is represented by a combined Students' Union (SU).

The JCR and MCR presidents of all affiliated Oxford Common Rooms, in addition to their OUSU Reps, are automatically voting members of OUSU's governing Council, which meets fortnightly during term to decide on virtually all aspects of OUSU's policy. OUSU Council meetings take place in odd-numbered weeks of the University term. JCR Presidents also get together in even-numbered weeks for meetings of Presidents' Committee (popularly known as Prescom). MCR Presidents also get together up to three times a term for meetings of the MCR Presidents' Committee (popularly known as MCR-PresCom).

Alternative names are sometimes used for college MCRs. [[Brasenose College, Oxford|Brasenose College]] has the "Hulme Common Room" (HCR), and [[University College, Oxford|University College]] has the "Weir Common Room", named in honour of college [[alumni]]. At [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]], [[St Antony's College, Oxford|St Antony's]] and [[Templeton College, Oxford|Templeton]] the representative bodies for postgraduate students are called "Graduate Common Rooms" or "GCRs". At some graduate colleges such as [[Wolfson College, Oxford|Wolfson]], [[St. Cross College, Oxford|St. Cross]] and [[Linacre College, Oxford|Linacre College]], students and fellows share a single, egalitarian Common Room.

In addition, colleges sometimes have additional common rooms, such as the "Summer Common Room" at [[Magdalen College, Oxford|Magdalen College]]. These are sometimes, but not always, associated with a particular section of the student or academic body.


=== Cambridge ===
At the [[University of Cambridge]], most colleges have either common rooms or '''combination rooms''', a tradition dating from the seventeenth century. The same abbreviations, JCR, MCR, and SCR are used for combination rooms. The JCR represents [[undergraduate]]s, with [[postgraduate student]]s being members of the Middle Combination Room. In some colleges, postgraduates are members of both the MCR and JCR: for example, at [[St John's College, Cambridge|St John's]], where the MCR is known as the [[Samuel Butler Room Society|Samuel Butler Room]] or at Peterhouse. Most colleges also have an SCR. At Pembroke College the common rooms are called "parlours", such as the Junior Parlour and Graduate Parlour. At [[Jesus College, Cambridge]], the JCR is known as "The Jesus College Students' Union", with its physical space being the Marshall Room.

Similarly, [[Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge]] has both a JCR, MCR, SCR along with a Sidney Sussex College Students Union of which all students are members.

JCRs and MCRs have elected committees to represent their interests within their colleges and in the central students' union. [[Cambridge University Students' Union]]. The committees are almost universally led by a President and a range of other elected positions to cover specific areas or interest or functions (e.g. Secretary, Treasurer, Entertainment). There is a great deal of variety between the colleges in terms of the roles that the JCRs and MCRs undertake, how much influence they have in college affairs and how many functions they provide. Nearly all are responsible for organising Freshers Week and frequent entertainments.

JCR Presidents and External Officers in Cambridge are ''ex officio'' council members of the [[Cambridge University Students' Union]] (CUSU). Before CUSU was established, individual JCRs were direct members of the NUS. This meant that [[Churchill College Junior Common Room|Churchill JCR]] was able to lead the NUS in its campaign for student representation.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} Unlike most universities, CUSU serves the common rooms and common rooms may choose to disaffiliate. CUSU is funded by the common rooms rather than funding them.

=== Bristol ===
[[Halls of residence|Halls]] of the [[University of Bristol]] cater mostly for first year undergraduate students, though there is a sizable undergraduate and postgraduate community who choose to stay on, either in the capacity as Tutors or as full paying boarders. The term JCR refers to the entire undergraduate population, but more specifically and commonly to the elected body of students who run the JCR for one academic year. Though most Bristol Hall JCRs are made up of first years, it is custom in [[Clifton Hill House]], [[Goldney Hall]], [[Wills Hall]] and Manor Hall to elect returning students to the majority of positions, including JCR President.

There is no MCR, but the SCR includes the Warden, the Vice/Deputy Warden, the Tutors and honourable guests at [[Formal Hall]]. Hall Bars physically house the JCR, with a separate and publicly inaccessible SCR room reserved elsewhere in Hall.

=== Durham ===
At [[Durham University|Durham]], the majority of the [[Colleges of Durham University|sixteen colleges]] divide their members into:
* A JCR for [[undergraduate]] students
* An MCR for [[postgraduate]] students
* An SCR for [[academic]]s who are members of the college

In addition, there may be one or more rooms set aside for the use of these bodies referred to as 'the JCR' or 'the MCR' etc. The committees that run the JCR and MCR are called the Executive Committee or "Exec". Membership of the JCR and MCR is not obligatory to students.

There are some exceptions to this. The [[College of St Hild and St Bede]] has a "[[Students Representative Council]]", which includes both undergraduates and [[postgraduate]]s at the college, with a special [[postgraduate]] committee. St.Aidan's College combines the MCR and SCR into one SCR whereby the postgraduates and senior members belong to one Common Room as a whole, while [[St Cuthbert's Society]] combines the JCR and MCR into one JCR. Following a referendum in 2011, students of [[St John's College, Durham|St. John's College]] are represented by the "John's Common Room" (JCR) a composite body representing Undergraduates, the MCR (Postgraduates) and the Cranmer Common Room (representing the students of [[Cranmer Hall, Durham|Cranmer Hall]]) (pre-2011 the body was the Joint Junior Common Rom JJCR). Ustinov College, which does not take undergraduates, has a Graduate Common Room (GCR) for its students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ustinovgcrcharity.wordpress.com/|title=Graduate Common Room|publisher=Ustinov College Graduate Common Room|accessdate=17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the [[Durham Students' Union]] is independent from the college common rooms, each college has a representative to the union.

=== Exeter ===
At the [[University of Exeter]], a number of residential halls for first year undergraduates retain traditional common room structures. Lopes, Hope and Mardon hall are all home to extensive Common Room set ups, which form a central part of student life there. In such Halls, committees are elected to represent the student body via the Common Room, and it is their job to liaise with the Resident Tutors who reside within the Hall. Although somewhat under threat by mergers of Halls and changes to internal administration, the Common Rooms still play an active and important role within the University, by both providing welfare and recourse to higher authorities for the students, and by organising social events such as balls, formals and more casual activities.

=== Kent ===
At [[University of Kent|Kent]] each of the colleges was initially built with one or more "senior Common Room" social spaces. However, over the passage of time a number of the common rooms have been transformed into eateries and more formalised social areas. Each college has a "management Committee" (formerly "Junior College Committee" and before that, "Junior Common Room Committee") which acts to represent the students of each college at the students' union and organise cultural events.

The Rooms and Committees have traditionally been open to both undergraduates and postgraduates, with the Senior Common Rooms provided for staff.

=== Lancaster ===
At [[University of Lancaster|Lancaster]], undergraduates are members of one of eight colleges (with a further college for postgraduate students). Each undergraduate college is a quasi-autonomous body within the university, and each divides its members into Junior and Senior Common Rooms. These terms are more indicative of the collective student/staff bodies than actual space,  although each college has actual common rooms set aside for Junior members. Senior members are less fortunate due to a current policy by the university's estates department of removing Senior Common Room space from college control – refurbishing these as teaching rooms or putting them on the central booking system, so SCR members cannot just "drop in". The term "JCR", although intended to refer to all junior members of a college, is often used to refer to elected members of each college's JCR Executive.  Each JCR Executive organises a range of social and sporting activities for its college while also offering welfare support for its junior members. The President and Vice President represent their college at the Student Union Council and on a range of University Committees, and many JCR Executive members sit with SCR members on the College Syndicate – the governing body of each college.

Within the Graduate College, the Graduate Students Association (GSA) takes on the role of an "MCR". Lancaster has a Students' Union which co-ordinates activities between the different colleges, and the JCR and GSA executives are considered to be standing committees of the Union Council.

=== Leicester ===
At [[University of Leicester|Leicester]]  the [https://web.archive.org/web/20130604024536/http://www.leicesterjcr.org.uk/ Junior Common Room] (JCR) is open to all members of the University, although its main focus is around the Halls of Residence of the University. The committee was responsible for running the various activities within the Halls of Residence and the represents students based at the Halls. The Term JCR also refers informally to the undergraduate population of the University as a whole . The committee of the JCR is main elected from its members within the Halls of Residence. The Senior Common Room (SCR) for the University remains on its main Campus. Membership of the Common Room is open to all full-time members of staff but not postgraduate students, although they may be entertained as guests of members in the bar. The Common Room itself and its activates are governed by a committee of elected academics and fellows.

=== Nottingham ===
At [[University of Nottingham|Nottingham]], the majority of the Halls of Residence predominantly house undergraduates, with a small number of postgraduates living in hall as part of the pastoral and disciplinary system; in this instance, the JCR refers to the undergraduate members of the hall. Postgraduates, along with a Warden, comprise the SCR (Senior Common Room). The Hall Warden is a member of university staff, often an academic, that might reside either in a special residence within the hall, or in a nearby house.

JCR activities include representation by elected students of their hallmates on accommodation issues, organised social events, and sports teams that compete in the [[University of Nottingham Students' Union|Athletic Union's]] Inter-mural sports competitions. Since most students move out of halls after their first year, it is common for students to retain a sense of affiliation to their hall while living 'off-campus'. Many JCRs include former residents of the hall in their sports teams.

All of the JCRs are now part of the [[University of Nottingham Students' Union|Students' Union]].

[[Melton Hall]] houses only postgraduates, and the student organisation there forms the university's only MCR.

[[University of Reading]] JCRs are set up in a very similar way to their Oxford counterparts, as the University was founded as [[University College, Reading]], as part of [[Christ Church, Oxford]]. The JCRs at Reading are some of the oldest outside Oxbridge with some such as [[Wantage Hall|Wantage JCR]] founded in 1908, St Patrick's Hall JCR in 1913 and [[Wessex Hall|Wessex JCR]] later in 1915. Today there are thirteen JCRs operating independently of each other, although they do work with the Students' Union. JCRs represent all Students in a particular Hall as well as having a large number of attached members living in houses.

Each year a new committee is elected in each halls.

[[University of Reading]] [http://www.reading.ac.uk/internal/senior-common-room/ Senior Common Room] began life in 1897 as the Common Room, but in 1908 a proposal was found to be necessary (and was carried) to have the title altered from Staff Common Room to Senior Common Room. The Senior Common Room (SCR) functions as a 'staff social club' of the University. The membership currently includes over 800 academic, administrative and technical staff within the various departments and offices from across the University. Postgraduates may become associated members.

=== St Andrews ===
At the [[University of St Andrews]], each hall of residence has a common room for use by all the resident students. Each year, the residents of the hall elect a committee that is responsible for social events. A portion of the yearly residence fees are earmarked for use by the committee for such events. Each hall also has a warden, assisted by one or more subwardens, who is responsible for discipline in the hall (such as dealing with complaints of excessive noise), and who also acts as an advisor to the committee.

The hall common rooms may contain a television or hall library (some halls have dedicated rooms for these). The committee may also subscribe to newspapers and magazines, or buy books and DVDs, which are made available in the common room.

In addition [[St Mary's College, St Andrews|St Mary's College]] has a JCR for the use of undergraduates and an SCR for the use of staff.

The previous principal of St Andrews, [[Brian Lang]], was criticized and finally rebuked by the university court for requisitioning common rooms in certain halls for private parties, despite complaints by residents about noise and disruption to hall activities. His successor, [[Louise Richardson]], has indicated that she will not continue this or any similar practice.

=== Southampton ===
JCRs at the [[University of Southampton]] exist in each of the different halls of residences; Archers Road, Mayflower, Bencraft, Chamberlain, [[Connaught Hall, Southampton|Connaught Hall]], Erasmus Park (At Winchester School Of Art), [[Glen Eyre Halls|Glen Eyre]], Highfield halls and Montefiore. The JCRs provide a welfare and support role to new students, and coordinate social and sports activities around the halls. Yearly elections are held in December, with members serving one or two yearly terms. In 2009 JCRs became part of [[University of Southampton Students' Union|Southampton University Students' Union]] representative structure and operate under the JCR Executive officer, with a budget of nearly £92,000.

=== York ===
The day-to-day running of the [[colleges of the University of York|colleges]] is managed by an elected committee of staff and student members chaired by the college's [[Provost (education)|Provost]]. Colleges have a Junior Common Room (JCR) for undergraduate students, which is managed by the elected Junior Common Room Committee (JCRC), and a Graduate Common Room (GCR) for post-graduate students, as well as a Senior Common Room (SCR), which is managed by elected representatives of the college's academic and administrative members. The only exceptions to this are Wentworth which as a post-graduate only college does not have a Junior Common Room, and Halifax&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.halifaxcollege.com/who-we-are/hcsa-committee/the-association/|title=Halifax College Students Association|publisher=''[[Halifax College, York|Halifax College Students Association]]''|accessdate=26 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131128012328/http://www.halifaxcollege.com/who-we-are/hcsa-committee/the-association/|archivedate=28 November 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Constantine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.constantinecollege.com/page/3/|title=Constantine College Referendum Results|publisher=''[[Constantine College, York|Constantine College]]''|accessdate=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are run by a student association that represents both undergraduates and postgraduates together. Langwith's Junior Common Room is branded as a Student Association, however Langwith retains a Graduate Common Room and a Senior Common Room and therefore it's SA plays the same role as the JCRC in the other colleges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.york.ac.uk/colleges/langwith/about/whos-who/|title=Who's Who in Langwith|publisher=''[[Langwith College, York|Langwith College]]''|accessdate=26 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150122024604/http://www.york.ac.uk/colleges/langwith/about/whos-who/|archivedate=22 January 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Junior Common Rooms are run by a Junior Common Room Committee (JCRC) headed by an 'Executive Committee' made up of a Chair/President, Vice Chair/Presidents, Secretary, and Treasurer who have signatory powers. Below the Executive Committee are the rest of the members of the committees who have responsibilities for welfare, activities, events and the general running of the committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yusu.org/colleges/elections|title=College Elections|publisher=''[[University of York Students' Union|YUSU]]''|accessdate=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Annual elections are held in November with people coming forward to stand for the various positions. Each individual college's JCRC is slightly different in composition, however all are elected by the undergraduate population following a [[hustings]]. The successful candidates are then elected for a whole year, bar any extenuating circumstances e.g. a Vote of No Confidence. The JCRC's primary functions are to be representative of the specific needs of their undergraduate populations, and to provide welfare help to students in the form of welfare reps who can offer advice or give contact details of other groups to students through informal ''drop-in'' sessions. With York's collegiate system though, JCRCs are increasingly involved in fostering college spirit through organising the many major social events a college has, such as Christmas and Summer formal Balls.

== United States ==

=== Harvard ===
At [[Harvard College]], the term "Junior Common Room" officially refers to the collection of undergraduates affiliated with one of Harvard's [[Harvard College#House system|12 houses]]. Every undergraduate is assigned to a house in the spring of his or her freshman year and thereafter is a member of that house's Junior Common Room, including students who have chosen to reside off campus.

In everyday usage, however, "Junior Common Room" almost always refers to a large [[common room]] in an undergraduate house by the same name, or simply "JCR" for short. JCRs are generally available for undergraduates to study or watch television, and student groups often reserve the space for meetings. This is in contrast to a "Senior Common Room," or SCR, which is for exclusive use of the houses' Senior Common Room members, which includes the House Masters, tutors, and other accomplished academics in the community.

== Canada ==

=== McGill University ===
The Faculty of Religious Studies houses a JCR and SCR.  The JCR is a center for social activity among students, and the SCR is often used as a setting in films due to its luxurious setting.  The university residences also have areas which are designated as "common rooms".

=== Memorial University of Newfoundland ===
Paton College of Memorial University of Newfoundland has a Junior Common Room for undergraduates and all members of the university, and a Senior Common Room for use by academics.

=== Lady Eaton College, Trent University ===
Lady Eaton College continues several [[Oxbridge]] traditions present at the founding of [[Trent University]] in 1964.  This includes a Junior Common Room for the use of students and a Senior Common Room for college fellows and staff.  It is the only college on the main campus that presently maintains both a JCR and SCR.

=== University of Toronto ===
Most colleges at University of Toronto have a common room system. [[The University of Trinity College]], has maintained many of the traditions of [[Oxbridge]], including the wearing of academic gowns and several common rooms, including a Junior Common Room, Divinity Common Room, and Senior Common Room, which are all communities within the college as well as physical rooms. All undergraduate students registered in the college are members of the Junior Common Room, which hosts a variety of lively social activities, as well as serving as a comfortable student lounge with newspapers from around the world. The Divinity Common Room is available to students in Trinity's Faculty of Divinity, the oldest Anglican theological faculty in Canada. The Senior Common Room consists of college fellows with teaching appointments in the University of Toronto, teaching staff in the Faculty of Divinity, senior college administrators, postgraduate students who serve as academic dons, and divinity graduate students with fellowships. Other select members of the wider academic, social, and ecclesiastical community are also included. The SCR hosts a number of social and educational events and weekly high table dinners in Strachan Hall. The room, which overlooks the college quadrangle, is a faculty lounge hosting daily tea and weekly wine receptions. In [[University College, Toronto]], the JCR is a popular hangout for students.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5080">:''This article is about the term "corresponding conditional" as it is used in logic''

In [[logic]], the '''corresponding conditional''' of an [[argument]] (or derivation) is a [[material conditional]] whose [[antecedent (logic)|antecedent]] is the [[logical conjunction|conjunction]] of the argument's (or derivation's) [[premise]]s and whose [[consequent]] is the argument's conclusion. An argument is [[Validity (logic)|valid]] [[if and only if]] its corresponding conditional is a [[logical truth]]. It follows that an argument is valid if and only if the negation of its corresponding conditional is a [[contradiction]]. Therefore, the construction of a corresponding conditional provides a useful technique for determining the validity of an argument.

==Example==
Consider the argument '''A''':

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Either it is hot or it is cold&lt;br /&gt;
It is not hot&lt;br /&gt;
Therefore it is cold&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This argument is of the form:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Either P or Q &lt;br /&gt;
Not P &lt;br /&gt;
Therefore Q&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
or (using standard symbols of [[propositional calculus]]):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
P {{or-}} Q &lt;br /&gt;
{{not}}P&lt;br /&gt;
____________&lt;br /&gt;
Q
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The corresponding conditional '''C''' is:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
IF ((P or Q) and not P) THEN Q &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
or (using standard symbols):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
((P {{or-}} Q) {{and}} {{not}}P){{imp}} Q
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

and the argument '''A''' is valid just in case the corresponding conditional '''C''' is a necessary truth.

If '''C'''  is a necessary truth then {{not}}'''C''' entails Falsity (The False).

Thus, any argument is valid if and only if the denial of its corresponding conditional leads to a contradiction.

If we construct a [[truth table]] for '''C''' we will find that it comes out''' T''' (true) on every row (and of course if we construct a truth table for the negation of '''C''' it will come out '''F''' (false) in every row. These results confirm the validity of the argument''' A'''

Some arguments need [[First-order logic|first-order predicate logic]] to reveal their forms and they cannot be tested properly by truth tables forms.

Consider the argument '''A1''':

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Some mortals are not Greeks&lt;br /&gt;
Some Greeks are not men&lt;br /&gt;
Not every man is a logician&lt;br /&gt;
Therefore Some mortals are not logicians&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To test this argument for validity, construct the corresponding conditional '''C1''' (you will need first-order predicate logic), negate it,  and see if you can derive a contradiction from it. If you succeed, then the argument is valid.

==Application==
Instead of attempting to derive the conclusion from the premises proceed as follows.

To test the validity of an argument (a) translate, as necessary, each premise and the conclusion into sentential or predicate logic sentences (b) construct from these the negation of the corresponding conditional (c) see if from it a contradiction can be derived (or if feasible construct a truth table for it and see if it comes out false on every row.) Alternatively construct a truth tree and see if every branch is closed. Success proves the validity of the original argument.

In case of the difficulty in trying to derive a contradiction, one should proceed as follows. From the negation of the corresponding conditional derive a theorem in [[conjunctive normal form]] in the methodical fashions described in text books. If, and only if, the original argument was valid will the theorem in conjunctive normal form be a contradiction, and if it is, then that it is will be apparent.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5543">[[File:Blenheim_Plan.png|thumb|[[Blenheim Palace]]: The cour d'honneur is the large axial entrance court framed by the secondary wings containing kitchens and domestic offices flanking the ''[[corps de logis]]'']]
[[File:Vue aérienne du domaine de Versailles le 20 août 2014 par ToucanWings - Creative Commons By Sa 3.0 - 28.jpg|thumb|[[Louis Le Vau]] opened up the interior court of the [[Palace of Versailles|Château de Versailles]] to create the expansive entrance cour d'honneur, subsequently copied all over Europe.]]
'''Cour d'honneur''' ({{IPA-fr|kuʁ dɔnœʁ}}, court of honor) is the architectural term for a three-sided ceremonial [[courtyard]], created by flanking the main central block, or ''[[corps de logis]]'', with symmetrical advancing secondary wings containing minor rooms. The [[Palace of Versailles]] (''illustration'') and [[Blenheim Palace]] (''plan'') both feature such entrance courts.

Some 16th-century symmetrical Western European country houses built on U-shaped groundplans resulted in a sheltered central door in a main range that was embraced between projecting wings, but the formalized cour d'honneur is first found in the great [[palace]]s and [[mansion]]s of 17th-century Europe, where it forms the principal approach and ceremonial entrance to the building.  Its open courtyard is presented like the classical permanent theatre set of a proscenium stage, such as the built Roman set of opposed ''palazzi'' in a perspective street at [[Andrea Palladio|Palladio]]'s Teatro Olimpico (Vicenza, 1584). Like the theatre set the built environment is defined and enclosed from the more public space by ornate [[wrought iron]] [[gilded]] railings.  A later development replaced the railings with an open architectural columnar screen, as at [[Palais Royal]] (Paris), [[Schönbrunn Palace]] (Vienna), [[Alexander Palace]] (Saint Petersburg), or [[Henry Holland (architect)|Henry Holland]]'s [[Ionic order|Ionic screen]] formerly at [[Carlton House, London|Carlton House]], London (''illustrated below'').

[[File:Carltonhs.jpg|thumb|left|[[Henry Holland (architect)|Henry Holland]]'s Ionic screen fronts a shallow cour d'honneur at the [[George IV of the United Kingdom|Prince Regent]]'s Carlton House in [[Pall Mall, London|Pall Mall]], London]]
Technically, the term cour d'honneur can be used of any large building whether public or residential, ancient or modern, which has a symmetrical courtyard set apart in this way, at which the honored visitor arrives. (The rest may arrive without flourish, through a side entrance.)

Examples of a cour d'honneur can be found in many of the most notable [[Baroque]] and classicizing buildings of Europe including the [[Palazzo Pitti]], one of the first 16th century residences to open a cour d'honneur—in the Pitti's case by embracing three sides of an existing public space. Other 16th century urban ''palazzi'' remained resolutely enclosed, like [[Palazzo Farnese]], Rome. In Rome, the wings of [[Carlo Maderno]]'s [[Palazzo Barberini]] design (1627), were the first that reached forward from a central block to create a cour d'honneur floorplan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usc.edu/schools/annenberg/asc/projects/comm544/library/images/082.html|title=Barberini Palace (plan of first floor)|work=usc.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Palbarberini.jpg|thumb|[[Palazzo Barberini]]: without railings the entrance court is still public space.]]

On a condensed, urban scale the formula is expressed in Parisian private houses, ''[[Hôtel particulier|hôtels particuliers]]'' built ''entre cour et jardin'' ({{IPA-fr|ɑ̃ːtʁ kuːʁ e ʒaʁdɛ̃|pron}}), between court and garden. In these plans, the street front may be expressed as a range of buildings not unlike the ordinary houses (''maisons'') that flank it, but with a grand, often arched, doorway, through which a carriage could pass into the cour d'honneur secreted behind. In a cramped site, one of the flanking walls of the cour d'honneur may be no more than an architectural screen, balancing the wing of the hôtel opposite it, which would often contain domestic offices and a stable.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Gallet ''Les Demeures parisiennes: l'époque de Louis XVI'', (Paris: Le Temps) 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; On a grander scale, the [[Palais Royal]] was laid out in just this manner, among the first Paris ''hôtels particuliers'' to have a cour d'honneur, which once was separated from the public street by a wrought iron grille, later by an open architectural screen, with its grand open ''jardin'' behind, now a public space. Nearby, the [[Tuileries Palace]] is gone: but the cour d'honneur with its [[Place du Carrousel#The Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel|Arc du Carrousel]] remains, as do the [[Tuileries Gardens]] behind the former palace's site.
[[File:Villard Exterior 118503pv.jpg|thumb|left|The Villard Houses facing [[Madison Avenue]], New York]]

In densely built cities disposed on a rigorously democratic grid plan such as [[New York City|New York]], private houses with a cour d'honneur were rare, even in the [[Gilded Age]]; the [[Villard Houses]] on Madison Avenue and the former [[William K. Vanderbilt House]] on the Plaza were the rare exceptions. In London, [[Burlington House]] retains its cour d'honneur, whereas the [[Buckingham Palace]]'s is no longer extant, as it was remodeled to be enclosed on all 4 sides, thus becoming (and now known as) a [[Quadrangle (architecture)|quadrangle]].{{Clear}}

{{Nihongo|'''''Dennō Coil'''''|電脳コイル|Dennō Koiru|lit. ''Electronic Brain Coil'' or ''Computer Coil''}}, '''''Coil—A Circle of Children''''', is a Japanese [[science fiction]] [[anime]] television series depicting a near future where [[Immersion (virtual reality)|semi-immersive]] [[augmented reality]] (AR) technology has just begun to enter the mainstream. The series takes place in the fictional city of Daikoku, a hotbed of AR development with an emerging citywide virtual infrastructure. It follows a group of children as they use AR glasses to unravel the mysteries of the half real, half [[Internet]] city, using a variety of illegal [[software]] tools, techniques, and virtual pets to manipulate the digital landscape.

''Dennō Coil'', in development for over a decade, is the series director debut of Japanese animator [[Mitsuo Iso]]. It premiered on [[NHK Educational TV]] on May 12, 2007. Due to the animators involved in its production and its unusually high-profile television broadcast time slot, ''Dennō Coil'' was highly anticipated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pelleas.net/aniTOP/index.php?title=denno_coil_on_terrestrial_tv_at_prime_ti|title=Anipages|accessdate=May 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; An English dub '''''Den-noh Coil''''' was released on Blu-ray and DVD by Maiden Japan in June 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2016-02-23/maiden-japan-licenses-den-noh-coil-anime/.99009|title=Maiden Japan Licenses Den-noh Coil Anime|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=February 23, 2016|accessdate=September 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
{{See also|List of Dennō Coil episodes}}
In 2026, eleven years after the introduction of internet-connected augmented reality eyeglasses and visors, Yūko Okonogi moves with her family to the city of Daikoku, the technological center of the emerging half-virtual world.  Yūko joins her grandmother's "investigation agency" made up of children equipped with virtual tools and metatags.  As their research turns up mounting evidence of children who have been whisked away to the mysterious "other side" of reality, they find themselves entangled in a conspiracy to cover up the dangerous true nature and history of the new technology.

==Setting and themes==

===Technology===
''Dennō'' means "computer" and is analogous to the archaic English term "[[cyberbrain]]". In the series, the word is used to differentiate between virtual and real, e.g. "dennō cat". The title of the show itself, ''Dennō Coil'', refers to a dangerous separation of one's digital self from the physical body.
[[File:Dennou-yuuko-megane.png|thumb|256px|Yasako uses her [[augmented reality]] eyeglasses and ear monitors.]]
The children access the virtual world through Internet-connected visors, which they refer to as ''megane'', the usual term for protective or corrective eyeglasses. The visors allow them to see virtual reality superimposed on objective reality. To visually confirm something as virtual, the children often lift their visors from their eyes. The visors also work in conjunction with futuristic ear monitors placed behind the ear, which allow the wearer to hear sounds from the virtual environment.

===Interaction with the virtual world===
Interaction with the virtual world is handled in a similar fashion to contemporary [[video game]]s. Software tools are visually represented as tactile tools (e.g. a fishing rod) which occupy 3D virtual space and must be manipulated by hand.  Sophisticated tools include [[Metadata|metatags]], visually represented as ''[[o-fuda]]'' (paper talismans), and efficacious chalk circles called ''angō'', meaning "code", which have a variety of effects. Virtual objects such as pets cannot be recalled or reset; when a pet runs away, it must be chased and caught in 3D space. Virtual objects and pets are also susceptible to a form of "death" by data corruption or deletion. For a virtual object or pet to be deleted from cyberspace, it can be attacked by a virtual weapon, such as Searchmaton's [[Directed-energy weapon|beam weapons]].  While users of dennō eyeglasses cannot be physically harmed by virtual weapons, their costly personal data and virtual possessions can be damaged.

Searchmaton, the maintenance and [[Antivirus software|antivirus]] bot of Daikoku, is constantly on the lookout for illegal objects and damaged space, which includes corrupted or obsolete space, computer viruses, and the forbidden pets and tools that the protagonists own.  The virtual side of Daikoku is shown as an emerging space, requiring some maintenance. In the first episode, the virtual dog Densuke falls into an obsolete virtual space at a physical construction site. Due to a [[Software versioning|version mismatch]] between the dog and the space, Densuke finds himself [[glitch]]ing and destabilizing in the environment. Eventually Searchmaton [[Disk formatting|reformats]] the obsolete space.  It is also shown that the virtual space represented in Daikoku is tied to the city's electronic infrastructure.  In one scene, Fumie Hashimoto uses a metatag to control a [[traffic light]].

The underground virtual currency of Daikoku is known as meta, which is equivalent to the [[Japanese yen]], and is traded in the form of "metabugs".  The market value of a metabug can change according to its supply and demand.  It is explained that a metabug represents a special kind of [[software bug]], and from their unique properties they can be refined into tools or metatags by skilled craftsmen.  Metabugs, which are especially abundant in the city of Daikoku, can only be unearthed in damaged or corrupted spaces.  Metabugs are also a target of deletion for Searchmaton.

Despite being a computer environment, the virtual side of ''Dennō Coil'' has a tangible and sometimes organic design, with much of the interaction requiring physical effort in 3D space. In order to hack into a corrupted virtual space in Daikoku, Fumie Hashimoto handles a software [[Aerosol spray|spray can]] loaded with so-called "black bug spray". A virus on the run from Searchmaton leaves behind a (virtually) tangible, evaporating black trail of raw "dennō substance". The virtual dog Densuke uses his nose to follow the trail.  However, dennō eyeglasses do not grant the user the ability to "feel" the virtual world.  Therefore, using software tools and playing with virtual pets requires some degree of active make-believe from the user.

[[File:Dennou-daisuke-space.png|right|thumb|224px|Densuke explores an abandoned space.]]
A special type of rogue virtual organism known as "illegals" populate the damaged and obsolete spaces of Daikoku City.  The protagonists sometimes hunt special forms of illegals in the hope of collecting valuable metabugs.  Illegals, originating from "the other side", sometimes become lost and isolated in the city and express a desire to return to their "homeland".  Some humanoid illegals known as [[Null pointer|Nulls]] can whisk people away to "the other side" by inducing "dennō coil"—a comatose state where the victim is trapped in VR.

===Infrastructure of the virtual world===
In order to spatially synchronize virtual space and real space, users of internet-connected dennō eyeglasses constantly [[upload]] the status of physical space to the virtual infrastructure.  In the fifth episode, the protagonists encounter a sparsely visited junkyard of buses on the fringes of wireless internet connectivity.  Due to obsolete AR data, the buses are depicted by dennō eyeglasses as being in far better condition than they actually are.  The characters sometimes exploit the discrepancies of desynchronization when dealing with metabugs and illegals.

The AR world is filled with mysteries of and ghostly tales about children losing their soul to "the other side", a supposed ghostly realm of VR hidden in the AR environment.  The protagonists continually gain a clearer picture of the true nature of the glasses and cyberspace throughout the series.  It is eventually revealed that the glasses form a two-way [[brain-computer interface]] known as Imago, first used in experimental medical treatments.  However, there are substantial health risks in prolonged use of the interface, and the interface itself presents the possibility of a coma or brain death through the "dennō coil" phenomenon.  At the same time, an experiment gone awry gave birth to Michiko, a digital life form that assumed control of Coil Domain—referred to in rumors as "the other side".  Due to their inability to erase Coil Domain, Megamass opted to instead create a new layer of augmented reality space on top of Coil Domain, where the influence of Michiko and Imago was lessened in order to minimize the occurrence of dennō coil.  Much information regarding Coil Domain, Imago, Michiko and dennō coil has been aggressively covered up by the technology conglomerate, Megamass.

===Themes===
A recurring theme throughout the series is the depiction of [[torii]], which are traditional Japanese gates that symbolically mark the transition from the [[sacrilege|profane]] to the [[sacred]], either as actual infrastructure (virtual or real) or in chalk patterns drawn by characters in the series.

Episode three opens with the monologue, "According to rumors in the industry, there are hidden functions in the [dennō] glasses that are better left unmentioned".  It is also rumored among children that one can "lose their soul" by venturing too far into obsolete space. Some children possess an extra sensitivity which allows them to perceive sounds and voices emanating from obsolete space, metabugs, and so on.  Much of the AR environment is steeped in urban legends and ghostly tales, and the series highlights the special intuition, extra sensitivity and sense of closeness that the children have to the emerging AR world.

[[File:Dennou-Searchmaton.png|thumb|224px|A [[Public service announcement|PSA]] web graphic, "Searchmaton is our friend".]]
It is shown that the virtual side of Daikoku is heavily regulated and restricted by the Searchmaton software, therefore the children of ''Dennō Coil'' are circumventing those regulations through their mischievous adventures and their trade of "illegal" software tools and pets.  Fumie Hashimoto describes Searchmaton as a powerful piece of software that, despite its blunt strength, is easily fooled due to its predictable behavior and unbalanced priorities.  She also laments how it shows no leeway by destroying even the most harmless of virtual toys and pets.  Beginning with episode six, the show often highlights the lack of nuance and the divide of understanding between the overprotective adult administrators and the child protagonists regarding the regulation of the emerging digital frontier.

According to the series director, Mitsuo Iso, a major theme in ''Dennō Coil'' is the distance between the characters, such as Yūko's inability to feel the fur of her own virtual pet, in addition to all the relational tensions and divides of understanding between the characters in the series.  In Iso's translated words, it conveys how "there will always be a distance between people, and even between things that seem within ones' reach. And that one must walk down a long, thin and winding road before they reach one's heart. There are tons of obstacles. It's in fact like the roads in towns of old."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last= | first= | title=Mitsuo Iso interview | magazine=[[Animage]] | volume=Volume 333 | issue=March 2007 | postscript= &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

: {{anime voice|[[Fumiko Orikasa]]|[[Hilary Haag]]}}
: Nicknamed Yasako, which is another [[Kanji#Readings|reading]] of 優子 meaning "gentle girl". With her sister Kyōko and her two parents, Yasako moves to the city of Daikoku to live with her grandmother, Megabaa.  Yasako is a sweet and passive girl who follows the lead of Fumie, who eventually initiates her into Megabaa's Coil Cyber Detective Agency as its eighth member.  Yasako has been to the city of Daikoku seven years ago for her grandfather's funeral.  A pair of dennō eyeglasses and the virtual pet Densuke were left to her as a memento. During her time in Daikoku, she coincidentally wandered into the Coil Domain where she befriended a young boy with the codename 4423. After Yasako returns to live in Daikoku, her hazy memories of that enigmatic friendship gradually return to haunt her.  Her father Ichirō works at a Dennou technology company, Megamass, which deploys Searchmaton in Daikoku. Her birthdate is October 12, 2015.

--&gt;[[File:Dennou-groupshot.png|thumb|320px|From left to right: Daichi, Yasako, Fumie, and Isako.]]
: Nicknamed Isako, which is another [[Kanji#Readings|reading]] of 勇子 meaning "brave girl", Yūko Amasawa is a powerful type of hacker known as an {{Nihongo|"encoder"|暗号屋|angōya}} who is able to manipulate the electronic infrastructure through sophisticated chalk patterns.  Rumored to have familial ties to an AR technology company, Isako uses a [[Brain-computer interface|Brain-Computer Interface]] to interact with the virtual world—a function hidden inside the hardware of AR visors and eyeglasses.  Isako is, on the surface, extremely arrogant and antisocial, perceiving human relationships strictly as hierarchies of power and manipulation. Isako relentlessly chases special illegals in order to collect kirabugs. She is secretly driven to this task in the hopes of finding her brother in "the other side". Her birthdate is April 4, 2015.
; {{Nihongo|Kyōko Okonogi|小此木 京子|Okonogi Kyōko}}
: {{anime voice|[[Akiko Yajima]]|[[Kira Vincent-Davis]]}}
: She is the little sister of Yasako. She is young and childish and often gets in the way of danger. She shows a number of fixations; the most common one is the repeated use of the word "poop" when pointing at people and other items of interest (Daichi can even decode her "poop! poop!"-language).
; {{Nihongo|Fumie Hashimoto|橋本 文恵|Hashimoto Fumie}}
: {{anime voice|[[Sachiko Kojima]]|[[Brittney Karbowski]]}}
: Fumie is the seventh member of the Coil Dennō Investigation Agency. She befriends Yasako almost immediately, and has a quick-witted, playful nature.  She is an experienced hacker and an adept user of metatags, and makes use of her digital pet, Oyaji, in her investigations.
; {{Nihongo|Akira Hashimoto|橋本 アキラ|Hashimoto Akira}}
: {{anime voice|[[Yumiko Kobayashi]]|[[Kira Vincent-Davis]]}}
: Akira is the youngest member of the Daikoku Hackers' Club. He agrees to spy on the Daikoku Hackers for his older sister, Fumie, by joining their ranks as a double agent. Akira makes use of his digital pet "Micet", which he illegally patched to unlock its video recording feature.
; {{Nihongo|Ken'ichi Harakawa|原川 研一|Harakawa Ken'ichi}}
: {{anime voice|[[Romi Park]]|[[Luci Christian]]}}&lt;!-- definition list fix
--&gt;[[File:Dennou-Haraken.png|thumb|256px|Haraken and his aunt, Tamako.]]
: Nicknamed Haraken.  He is the president of the Biology Club, and is the Coil Dennō Detective Agency's fifth member.  The polar opposite of Fumie, he is shy, reserved, and secretive, especially of his personal connection to Searchmaton.  Haraken is personally vested in researching internet viruses and illegals on behalf of Kanna Ashihara, his childhood friend, who died by traffic accident under mysterious circumstances in the previous year. He is secretly tormented by the idea, that a part of Kanna may still exist somewhere on "the other side". He begins to have feelings for Yasako but is distracted by Kanna's Incident.
; {{Nihongo|Tamako Harakawa|原川 玉子|Harakawa Tamako}}
: {{anime voice|[[Junko Noda]]|[[Tiffany Terrell]]}}
: Tamako is Haraken's aunt.  As a consultant for Daikoku's Cyberspace Administration, she holds authority over the programming of Searchmaton and is responsible for its highly aggressive behavior. She is especially intent on preventing Yūko Amasawa from accomplishing her mission to summon a portal to Coil Domain.  However Tamako herself is well-versed in hacking and the crafting of metatags, and she often oversteps her authority in investigating the protagonists' activities.  Her fervent pursuit of making augmented reality a "safe place" stems from her re-opening the portal to the other side in her early days of hacking, thus initiating the constant battle between obsolete and new space.
; {{Nihongo|Daichi Sawaguchi|沢口 ダイチ|Sawaguchi Daichi}}
: {{anime voice|[[Rie Saitou]]|[[Tiffany Grant]]}}
: Daichi is the founder and leader of a group of pranksters at school called the Daikoku Hackers' Club.  Hot-headed and quick to take offense, he holds an ongoing love/hate rivalry with Fumie stemming from early childhood.  With the appearance of Isako, Daichi quickly finds himself defeated and cast out of his own group after challenging her.  While often perceived as a troublemaker, Daichi is tagged by his awkward friend, Denpa, who holds him in high regard for befriending him in the face of school harassment.  Daichi is, somewhat ironically, a constant target of Kyōko's antics. He has deep feelings for Fumie but Fumie is dense about this even though she actually cares for him.
; {{Nihongo|Megabaa|メガばあ}}
: {{anime voice|[[Reiko Suzuki]]|Laura Chapman}}
: Sanae Okonogi, or Megabaa, whose nickname stems from the Japanese words for {{Nihongo|eyeglasses|メガネ|megane}} and {{Nihongo|grandma|ばあちゃん|baachan}}, is the owner of the Cyber Candy Shop Megasi-ya.  Megasi-ya also sells software and metatags. Megabaa is the primary craftsman of metatags in Daikoku, and is an expert software programmer. She is also Yasako's grandmother, and the head of the Coil Dennō Detective Agency.  Her cunning frugality terrifies Yasako among other characters. Her deceased husband was a researcher in the early medical application of dennō technology.  His secret legacy is slowly unveiled throughout the series.
; {{Nihongo|Sōsuke Nekome|猫目 宗助|Nekome Sōsuke}}
: {{anime voice|[[Koji Yusa]]|[[Chris Patton]]}}
: The antagonist of the series. He is a former acquaintance of Tamako Harakawa, and a collaborator in Isako's quest to open the door to the "other side". His ultimate aim is to bring down the Megamass company.
; {{Nihongo|Takeru Nekome|猫目 タケル|Nekome Takeru}}
: {{anime voice|[[Aiko Hibi]]|Kalin Coates}}
: The younger brother of Nekome. He is jealous of Isako and mercilessly bullies her, but takes a liking to Yasako and becomes split between his loyalty towards his brother and his desire to protect her. He has a modified pink micet named {{Nihongo|Momoko|モモコ}}.&lt;ref&gt;Japanese Limited Edition DVD 8 booklet&lt;/ref&gt;
; {{Nihongo|Searchmaton|サーチマトン|Sāchimaton}}
: Searchmaton, {{Nihongo|''Satchī''|サッチー}} for short, is a [[Internet bot|bot]] and antivirus software deployed by the Cyberspace Administration of Daikoku. Its task is to [[debug]] and maintain the virtual side of the city. Its secondary function is to seek out and disable illegal AR devices, software, and viruses, making it a menace to the characters of the series.  Searchmaton can deploy up to four spherical drones to aid in its task.  While Searchmaton can patrol the city streets freely, it is prohibited to enter private property such as houses, and other spaces such as temple grounds and schools, because they lie outside of the responsibility of Daikoku's Cyberspace Administration.  The protagonists utilize this and other predictable aspects of Searchmaton's behavior to escape its grasp.  Searchmaton, striking terror into the hearts of children, is ironically painted with a [[Smiley|smiley face]] and punctuates its violent attacks with the cute catch phrase {{Nihongo|"Me Satchī!"|僕サッチー|boku Satchī}} which Yasako's father had a part in developing.  Tamako often hijacks Searchmatons for use as her personal digital henchmen. They are later replaced by the upgraded Searchmaton 2.0 in the form of cubes which have upgraded weapons and shielding, and can combine like the Q-chan to perform wide area re-formatting. Since the 2.0s are under government jurisdiction they can enter areas inaccessible to Satchī including shrines, and also private property when authorised.
; {{Nihongo|Michiko|ミチコ}}
: A mysterious illegal who resides in Coil Domain. The child protagonists often whisper of her ghostly ability to pull people to "the other side". Mitchiko is also a product of Yasako's kiss and Isako's sadness.

The newspaper ''[[Mainichi Shimbun]]'' suggested the technology shown in the series would have a great influence on the future, comparing it to the way ''[[Snow Crash]]'' influenced the development of ''[[Second Life]]''. It also praised the series for showing technology that was very Japanese, and concentrating on how the children grow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mainichi.jp/enta/mantan/archive/news/2007/08/21/20070821org00m200004000c.html|title=Mainichi Review of Dennō Coil|work=[[Mainichi Shimbun]]|accessdate=August 21, 2007|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dennō Coil'', along with three other animation works, was awarded an Excellence Prize along with ''[[Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann]]'' by a jury at the 2007 [[Japan Media Arts Festival]].

Nieznalska's controversial installation ''Pasja'' (2002), which included the placement of an image of the [[penis]] upon a metal [[Greek cross]], resulted in a notable scandal, as the display was condemned as immoral and [[blasphemous]] by Polish [[Conservatism|conservative]] [[Roman Catholicism|Catholics]]. The group exhibition at which the installation was presented was closed down by the authorities, while Nieznalska herself faced legal charges on account of an alleged violation of a provision of the Polish criminal code prohibiting blasphemy.

The sculptor was successful in fighting off the blasphemy conviction following the favorable ruling of an [[appeals court]] in 2009.

==''Pasja'' (2002)==
[[Blasphemy]] charges were levelled against Nieznalska after an exhibition featuring the 2002 work ''Pasja'' (''"Passion"''), an artistic installation concerned with the themes of [[masculinity]] and [[suffering]].&lt;ref name = "Sinkiewicz December 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Feminist Revolt"&gt;Leskowicz, Pawel. [http://www.lilithgallery.com/feminist/Feminist_Revolt_Poland.html "Feminist Revolt: Censorship of Women’s Art in Poland".] The Lilith Gallery of Toronto. Retrieved 20 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "HF March 2010"/&gt; The installation was displayed at the experimental Gdańsk, [[Wyspa Gallery]], an institution associated with the academy, and consisted of two elements: a large [[Greek cross]] made of metal was suspended from the ceiling of the gallery, and covered; its center was filled in with an image of a man's [[hips]], [[thighs]], and [[penis]].&lt;ref name = "Art Liberated"&gt;[http://www.artliberated.org/?id=20&amp;p=cases Dorota Nieznalska. ''Pasja'' (''Passion'') , 2002.] Artliberated.org Retrieved 20 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Behind the cross, the viewer's attention was drawn to a large video, its display projecting from an overhead angle the face and shoulders of a grimacing man in the act of [[Weight training|weight-lifting]].&lt;ref name = "Art Liberated"/&gt; The viewer's inability to behold the man's body, his other body parts being cut off from the screen, concocted an effect of ambiguity as to the activity of the man on the screen, suggesting that the man's feeling of torment could have been the effect of other kinds of activity.&lt;ref name = "Art Liberated"/&gt; The installation would be described by some as depicting "the penis of [[Jesus Christ|Christ]]" in the ensuing controversy.&lt;ref name = "Baird 2005"/&gt;

==Legal charges of blasphemy==
Gdańsk activists of the [[right-wing]] [[League of Polish Families]] began a petition to the local authorities to open a legal case following the release of television footage of the exhibition.&lt;ref name = "Baird 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Jarecka Wyborcza 2009"&gt;Jarecka, Dorota (5 June 2009).[http://wyborcza.pl/1,75475,6689861,Nieznalska__katolicy__kulturysci.html "Nieznalska, katolicy, kulturyści".] ''[[Gazeta Wyborcza]]''.

Retrieved 20 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Complaints about ''Pasja'' led to Nieznalska's being summoned to report to the local police on 2 March 2002. The city's [[Rightism|rightist]] municipal councilors quickly closed the exhibition while the young artist, insisting that her intention was to focus on "the cult of the male body", became the defendant of a trial concerning Nieznalska's alleged violation of the [[criminal code]].&lt;ref name = "WV: Arts and the Church"/&gt; Nieznalska's upcoming exhibits in [[Słupsk]] and [[Ostrów Wielkopolski]] were cancelled after further intervention from the League of Polish Families.&lt;ref name = "Baird 2005"/&gt; Members of the [[Polish nationalism|nationalist]] youth group ''[[Młodzież Wszechpolska]]'' threatened to "hang such artists" and "shave their heads, like the [[Armia Krajowa|Home Army]] did with women who were in close relationships with [the] [[Nazi Germany|Germans]]"&lt;ref name = "Raster 2003"&gt;Szylak, Aneta &amp; Grzegorz Klaman (20 July 2003).

At the conclusion of the first legal process in 2003, the court found Nieznalska guilty of "offending religious feelings", a violation of the ban on [[blasphemy]] within Article 196 of the [[criminal code]].&lt;ref name = "Feminist Revolt"/&gt; Judge [[Tomasz Zieliński]] denied that Nieznalska's work was entitled to any special constitutional protection as an object of art, stating that "the fact that a work is within the boundaries of art has no significance for whether it can offend the feelings of other people."&lt;ref name = "Levine 66-67"&gt;{{cite book|last=Levine|first=Caroline|title=Provoking Democracy: Why We Need the Arts|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2007|pages=66–67|isbn=1-4051-5926-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court ordered Nieznalska to perform six months of unpaid [[community service]].&lt;ref name = "Levine 66-67"/&gt; The trial prosecutor had originally demanded a fine of 2000 ''[[złoty]]'', but the court decided to increase the penalty.&lt;ref name = "WV: Arts and the Church"/&gt; Judge Zieliński additionally forbade Nieznalska from traveling out of the country.&lt;ref name = "Levine 66-67"/&gt; The local deputies of the League of Polish Families present during the sentencing clapped to express their approval.&lt;ref name = "WV: Arts and the Church"/&gt;

Controversy surrounding Nieznalska's installation, already boiling during the initial trial, persisted well into the appeals process. An unsigned [[editorial]] in Poland's [[English language|Anglophone]] monthly ''[[The Warsaw Voice]]'', summing up the court case shortly after the initial verdict as a battle between the [[Leftism|left]] and [[Rightism|right]] - albeit "the first of its kind" for modern Poland - treated Nieznalska as "a tasteless provocateur, covering up her lack of genuine talent with shock tactics" and cited the opinion of [[Franciszek Starowieyski]], "one of the best-known Polish sculptors, himself rather partial to unconventional works", who "said before the beginning of the lawsuit that the one to blame was not the novice artist but the curator of the Gdańsk gallery. According to Starowieyski, Nieznalska's installation was of such a low artistic standard that it should never have been exhibited. Many other known artists, while not approving of the sentence, agreed that if not for the scandal, Nieznalska's work would have stood little chance of making it into reputable galleries."&lt;ref name = "WV: Arts and the Church"/&gt; The former [[President of Poland|president]] [[Lech Wałęsa]] spoke out against Nieznalska and supported a [[Hardline|hard line]], maintaining that the artist's sentence was insufficiently severe.&lt;ref name = "Baird 2005"/&gt; The fine arts professors supporting the Wyspa exhibitions decided to atone for the mistake by closing the gallery.&lt;ref name = "Raster 2003"/&gt;

The more [[Liberalism|liberal]] sections of Polish society stood up in support of the sculptor's right to free artistic expression. A letter of protest signed about 1500 artists, professionals, and other concerned citizens argued for "civic freedoms" and art as "one sphere" of "freedom, incorrectness, difference."&lt;ref name = "Levine 66-67"/&gt; An [[Opinion journalism|opinion piece]] by [[Andrzej Osęka]] for the liberal daily ''[[Gazeta Wyborcza]]'' compared the Nieznalska case to the 2005 [[Jyllands-Posten controversy|''Jyllands-Posten'' controversy]] in Denmark, noting that whereas the Danish newspaper suffered no legal consequences on account of its publication of a cartoon deliberately offensive to the [[Islam|Muslim faith]] in spite of loud outcries from Muslim communities around the world, Nieznalska's case had resulted in a campaign of legal intimidation because of poor legislation and the judges' deference to the politicians.&lt;ref name = "Osęka Wyborcza 2005"&gt;Osęka, Andrzej (12 February 2005).

Two former Wyspa staff - curator [[Aneta Szylak]] and director Grzegorz Klaman, Nieznalska's former instructor - wrote that while "[s]ince the times of [[Plato]], the academy [had been] a place for intellectual and artistic discourse", the principle "was broken when the gallery closed... Because she had the courage to show 'Pasja', Nieznalska had her scholarships and subsidies cut off; she has been stigmatized and censored... A spectacular political sham is [the League of Polish Families'] typical marketing strategy, and the judge acted just like they wanted him to."&lt;ref name = "Raster 2003"/&gt;

'''Bob 'Elvis' Gratton''' is a fictional character, the subject of multiple [[film]]s and a [[television series]] of the same name by [[Quebec]] director [[Pierre Falardeau]]: a series of [[short film]]s (''Elvis Gratton'', 1981; ''Les Vacances d'Elvis Gratton'', 1983; ''Pas encore Elvis Gratton!'', 1985) released on [[VHS]] as the single 1985 film ''Elvis Gratton: Le king des kings'', and then two sequels: ''Elvis Gratton II: Miracle à Memphis'' (1999) and ''Elvis Gratton 3: La vengeance d'Elvis Wong'' (2004). Most recently, a television series entitled ''[[Bob Gratton: Ma Vie|Bob Gratton: Ma Vie/My Life]]'' began on January 15, 2007, and finished its third and final season in 2009.

==Plot==

The first movie revolves around one Bob Gratton (played by [[Julien Poulin]], who co-wrote and co-directed the movies with Falardeau) and his passion for [[Elvis Presley]]. Gratton's life goal is to win fame as an [[Elvis impersonator]], and he achieves it through a local TV talent show contest whose prize is a cruise to the fictional island resort of Santa Banana. After his return from Santa Banana Gratton is called on to don his Elvis costume one more time, but because he has gained weight in the interim, he has trouble fitting into it and collapses on stage during a performance, seemingly dead. In the film's final scene, just as Gratton's casket is taken for interment Bob emerges from it, quite alive.

The second movie revolves around Gratton's later adventures after being discovered by a talent scout, and his rise to fame as a pop music star.

The third installment sees Gratton become the head of a media company and play an active role in manipulating the news that his media empire puts out.

==Political context==

In the 1980s, Falardeau and Poulin were very clear as to the goal of the early short films which constituted the first instalment of ''Elvis Gratton'': the intent was to portray (via parody) Falardeau's and Poulin's view of the mindset that they believed had driven a majority of [[Quebec|Québécois]] to vote for the No side of the 1980 [[referendum]] on [[Quebec sovereignty]]. Gratton is portrayed as fat and uneducated, but also [[Conservatism|conservative]], pro-American, [[racist]] and [[Quebec federalist ideology|federalist]]. The films' comical situations are premissed on Gratton's tacky (''quétaine'') character and backward-thinking views, with which Falardeau and Poulin sought to associate Quebec federalists more generally. Years later, Falardeau would reveal that he regretted the movie's focus on [[slapstick]] [[comedy]] and the protagonist's constant comic relief which, in his eyes, removed the underlying message of the movie and made the movie popular only for its jokes. It should be noted in Falardeau's views on Quebec federalists that Gratton is a local [[entrepreneur]], employs a few workers but has other goals in life, like becoming famous all around the world (even with no talent) and most importantly being loved by the world. For example, in the second movie the character accepts all offers and signs all contracts possible (without reading them) in the hope of these goals, even if that's the best way to go bankrupt. Having to be loved by others is linked with Falardeau's view of federalists.

Falardeau's motivation to create a second Elvis Gratton movie started in the 1990s, when Falardeau sought financing for his ''[[15 février 1839]]'' film project showing aspects of the [[Lower Canada Rebellion]]. Since this movie was about Quebec's history, Falardeau had been collecting donations for some time until it was suggested that a new Elvis Gratton movie would most likely be a hit and garner sufficient funds. The exercise indeed proved fruitful, and ''15 février 1839'' was released later in 2001.

==Other appearances==

Elvis Gratton showed up (remarkably un-politicised) in 1996 in an [[ad campaign]] as the year's [[spokesman]] for [[Opération Nez rouge]] (Operation Red Nose), a local initiative in Québec to provide a free driving service to take party-goers' cars back home during the holidays (along with said party-goers). Opération Nez Rouge has a history of using different humorists and/or characters each year to promote its activities.

In some countries, the term ''native language'' or ''mother tongue'' refers to the language of one's ethnic group rather than one's first language.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=JeTwQB5doD4C&amp;dq/  "K*The Native Speaker: Myth and Reality By Alan Davies] {{ISBN|1-85359-622-1}} {{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children brought up speaking more than one language can have more than one native language, and be [[Simultaneous bilingualism|bilingual]] or [[multilingual]]. By contrast, a ''[[second language]]'' is any language that one speaks other than one's first language.

==Terminology==
[[File:Kituwah Academy.png|thumb|right|A lesson at Kituwah Academy on the [[Qualla Boundary]] in [[North Carolina]]. The [[language immersion]] school, operated by the [[Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians]], teaches the same curriculum as other [[United States|American]] [[primary schools]], but [[Cherokee language|Cherokee]] is the medium of instruction from [[preschool]] onward, and students learn it as a first language. Such schools have proven instrumental in the preservation and perpetuation of Cherokee.]]
One of the more widely accepted definitions of native speakers is that they were born in a particular country raised to speak the language of that country during the critical period of their development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipedr.com/vol26/16-ICLLL%202011-L00033.pdf|title=Who Is An Ideal Native Speaker?!

"The Native Speaker and the Mother Tongue." Language Sciences 32.6 (2010): 589-93. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Native speakers are considered to be an authority on their given language because of their natural acquisition process regarding the language, as opposed to having learned the language later in life. That is achieved by personal interaction with the language and speakers of the language. Native speakers will not necessarily be knowledgeable about every grammatical rule of the language, but they will have good "intuition" of the rules through their experience with the language.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

Sometimes, the term "'''mother tongue'''" or "'''mother language'''" is used for the language that a person learned as a child at home (usually from their parents). Children growing up in bilingual homes can, according to this definition, have more than one mother tongue or native language.

In the context of population censuses conducted on the Canadian population, [[Statistics Canada]] defines ''mother tongue'' as "the first language learned at home in childhood and still understood by the individual at the time of the census."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census01/Products/Reference/dict/pop082.htm |title=mother tongue |work=2001 census |accessdate=25 August 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916172728/http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census01/Products/Reference/dict/pop082.htm |archivedate=16 September 2008 |df=dmy-all }} {{Unreliable source?|date=August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is quite possible that the first language learned is no longer a speaker's dominant language. That includes young immigrant children whose families have moved to a new linguistic environment as well as people who learned their mother tongue as a young child at home (rather than the language of the majority of the community), who may have lost, in part or in totality, the language they first [[language acquisition|acquired]] (see [[language attrition]]).

===Mother tongue===
[[File:Int-mother-lang-day-monument.jpg|thumb|right|International Mother Language Day Monument in Sydney, Australia, unveiling ceremony, 19 February 2006]]
According to [[Ivan Illich]], the term "mother tongue" was first used by [[Catholic]] monks to designate a particular language they used, instead of [[Latin]], when they are "speaking from the pulpit". That is, the "holy mother the Church" introduced this term and colonies inherited it from Christianity as a part of colonialism.&lt;ref&gt;[Ivan Illich] in Patttanayak, 1981:24 cited in [https://www.academia.edu/411071/_M_Other_Tongue_Syndrome_From_Breast_To_Bottle._ "(M)other Tongue Syndrome: From Breast to Bottle"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170830045733/http://www.academia.edu/411071/_M_Other_Tongue_Syndrome_From_Breast_To_Bottle._ |date=30 August 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ivan Illich, [http://www.preservenet.com/theory/Illich/Vernacular.html "Vernacular Values"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160720033517/http://www.preservenet.com/theory/Illich/Vernacular.html |date=20 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some countries, such as [[Kenya]], [[India]], and various East Asian countries, "mother language" or "native language" is used to indicate the language of one's [[ethnic group]] in both common and journalistic parlance ("I have no apologies for not learning my mother tongue"), rather than one's first language. Also, in [[Singapore]], "mother tongue" refers to the language of one's [[ethnic group]] regardless of actual proficiency, and the "first language" refers to English, which was established on the island under the [[British Empire]], which is the [[lingua franca]] for most post-independence Singaporeans because of its use as the language of instruction in government schools and as a working language.

[[J. R. R. Tolkien]], in his 1955 lecture "[[English and Welsh]]," distinguishes the "native tongue" from the "cradle tongue." The latter is the language one happens to learn during early childhood, and one's true "native tongue" may be different, possibly determined by an [[genetic memory (biology)|inherited linguistic taste]] and may later in life be discovered by a strong emotional affinity to a specific dialect (Tolkien personally confessed to such an affinity to the [[Middle English]] of the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] in particular).

On 17 November 1999, UNESCO designated 21 February as [[International Mother Language Day]].

==Significance==
The first language of a child is part of the personal, social and cultural identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bisnet.or.id/vle/mod/resource/view.php?id=1663|title=Terri Hirst: The Importance of Maintaining a Childs First Language|author=|date=|website=bisnet.or.id|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312012655/http://bisnet.or.id/vle/mod/resource/view.php?id=1663|archivedate=12 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another impact of the first language is that it brings about the reflection and learning of successful social patterns of acting and speaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-psych.stanford.edu/~lera/papers/mandarin.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510152648/http://www-psych.stanford.edu/~lera/papers/mandarin.pdf |archivedate=10 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is basically responsible for differentiating the linguistic competence of acting. While some argue that there is no such thing as "native speaker" or a "mother tongue," it is important to understand the key terms as well as understand what it means to be a "non-native" speaker and the implications that can have on one's life. Research suggest that while a non-native speaker may develop fluency in a targeted language after about two years of immersion, it can actually take between five and seven years for that child to be on the same working level as their native speaking counterparts. That has implications on the education of non-native speakers.&lt;ref&gt;Second Language Acquisition Essential Information: Professor J. Cumminshttp://esl.fis.edu/teachers/support/cummin.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The topic of native speaker also gives way to discussion about what exactly bilingualism is. One definition is that a person is bilingual by being equally proficient in both languages. A person who grows up speaking English and begins learning Spanish for four years is not necessarily bilingual unless they speak the two languages with equal fluency. Pearl and Lambert were the first to test only “balanced” bilinguals—that is, a child who is completely fluent in two languages and feel that neither is their “native” language because they grasp the two so perfectly. This study found the following: balanced bilinguals perform significantly better in tasks that require flexibility (they constantly shift between the two known languages depending on the situation/requires constant juggling), more aware of arbitrary nature of language and also that balanced bilinguals choose word associations based on logical rather than phonetic preferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alsintl.com/blog/language-proficiency/ |title=Language Proficiency: Defining Levels Avoids Confusion |publisher=Alsintl.com |date=2013-08-26 |accessdate=2013-11-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130917082347/http://www.alsintl.com/blog/language-proficiency |archivedate=17 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://faculty.ucmerced.edu/khakuta/research/publications/(1985)%20-%20THE%20RELATIONSHIP%20BETWEEN%20DEGREE%20OF%20BILINGUALISM%20AND.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024165613/http://faculty.ucmerced.edu/khakuta/research/publications/(1985)%20-%20THE%20RELATIONSHIP%20BETWEEN%20DEGREE%20OF%20BILINGUALISM%20AND.pdf |archivedate=24 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Multilingualism==
One can have two or more native languages, thus being a native ''bilingual'' or indeed ''[[Multilingualism|multilingual]]''. The order in which these languages are learned is not necessarily the order of proficiency. For instance, if a French-speaking couple have a child who learned French first but then the child grew up in an English-speaking country, the child would likely be most proficient in English. Other examples are in [[India]], [[Languages of Indonesia|Indonesia]], the [[Philippines]], [[Kenya]], [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]], and [[Languages of South Africa|South Africa]], where most people speak more than one language.

The designation "native language," in its general usage, is thought to be imprecise and subject to various interpretations that are biased linguistically, especially with respect to bilingual children from ethnic minority groups. Many scholars{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} have given definitions of 'native language' based on common usage, the emotional relation of the speaker towards the language, and even its dominance in relation to the environment. However, all of three criteria lack precision. For many children whose home language differs from the language of the environment (the 'official' language), it is debatable which language is one's 'native language'. 

===Defining "native language"{{anchor|Defining native language}}===
*Based on origin: the language(s) one learned first (the language(s) in which one has established the first long-lasting verbal contacts).
*Based on internal identification: the language(s) one identifies with/as a speaker of;
*Based on external identification: the language(s) one is identified with/as a speaker of, by others.
*Based on competence: the language(s) one knows best.
*Based on function: the language(s) one uses most.

===Defining "native speaker"===
The article titled “The Native Speaker: An Achievable Model?” published by the Asian EFL Journal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lee|first=Joseph|title=The Native Speaker: An Achievable Model?|journal=Asian EFL Journal|volume=7|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; states that there are six general principles that relate to the definition of "native speaker". The principles, according to the study, are typically accepted by language experts across the scientific field. A native speaker is defined according to the guidelines as this:

#The individual acquired the language in early childhood.
#The individual has intuitive knowledge of the language.
#The individual is able to produce fluent, spontaneous discourse.
#The individual is competent in communication.
#The individual identifies with or is identified by a language community.
#The individual has a dialect accent (including the official dialect).

'''Fulk III FitzWarin''' (c. 1160–1258; ''alias''  Fulke, Fouke, FitzWaryn, FitzWarren, Fitz Warine, etc., [[List of Latinised names|Latinised]] to ''Fulco Filius Warini'', "Fulk son of Warin")  was a powerful [[marcher lord]] seated at [[Whittington Castle]] in [[Shropshire]] in England on the border with [[Wales]], and also at [[Alveston]] in Gloucestershire. He rebelled against [[John, King of England|King John]] (1199–1216) from 1200 to 1203,&lt;ref name="FFWOCH97"&gt;Kathryn Bedford, 'Fouke le Fitz Waryn: Outlaw or Chivalric Hero?', ''British outlaws of literature and history: essays on medieval and early modern figures from Robin Hood to Twm Shon Catty'', ed. Alexander L Kaufman (Jefferson, NC : McFarland &amp; Co., 2011), p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; mainly over a dispute concerning his familial right to Whittington Castle, and was declared an [[outlaw]].
He was the subject of the famous mediaeval legend or "ancestral romance" entitled ''Fouke le Fitz Waryn'', which relates the story of his life as an outlaw and his struggle to regain his patrimony from the king. He founded, between 1221 and 1226,  [[Alberbury Priory]] in Shropshire which he granted to the Augustinian canons of [[Lilleshall]] but later transferred to the [[Order of Grandmont]]. His grandson was [[Fulk V FitzWarin, 1st Baron FitzWarin]] (1251–1315).&lt;ref&gt;GEC Complete Peerage, vol.V, p.495, Baron FitzWarin&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
Fulk III was the son of Fulk II FitzWarin (died 1197) by his wife Hawise le Dinan, a daughter and
co-heiress of [[Josce de Dinan]].&lt;ref name="GEC Complete Peerage p.495"&gt;GEC Complete Peerage, vol.V, p.495, note (c)&lt;/ref&gt; Fulk II was a marcher lord of Shropshire,&lt;ref&gt;Sidney Painter, ''The Reign of King John'' (Baltimore, The Johns Hopkins Press 1964) p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; the son and heir of [[Fulk I FitzWarin]] (d.1170/1) of Whittington and Alveston, who himself was the son  of (i.e. in Norman French ''Fitz'', in modern French ''fils de'') the family's earliest known ancestor, thus deemed the family patriarch, "Warin of Meer", from [[Lorraine (duchy)|Lorraine]].&lt;ref name="GEC Complete Peerage p.495"/&gt;

===Earliest ancestry===
Warin of Meer the patriarch is however a "shadowy or mythical figure",&lt;ref name="GEC Complete Peerage p.495"/&gt;  about whom little is certain. The later mediaeval romance ''Fouke le Fitz Waryn'' gives his name as "Warin de Meer".  Whatever his true place of origin it is however generally believed that the head of the Warin family came to England during the reign of [[William the Conqueror]] (1066–1087). Neither the father nor his sons were during that reign [[tenant-in-chief|tenants-in-chief]], that is to say important [[vassal]]s or [[English feudal barony|feudal barons]], rather their grants of lands were obtained from later kings.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066–1272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

Fulk I (d.1170/1) was rewarded by King [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] (1154–1189) for his support of his mother  [[Empress Matilda]] in her civil war with [[Stephen of England|King Stephen]] (1135–1154) and conferred to him in 1153 the royal [[manor]] of [[Alveston]] in Gloucestershire and in 1149 the manor of Whadborough in [[Leicestershire]]. Fulk II [[Feudal land tenure in England|held]] those properties after the death of his father in 1171.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066–1272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), pp. 34, 35&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Land dispute===
At some time before 1178 Fulk II (d.1197) married  Hawise de Dinan, a wealthy heiress, a daughter and co-heiress of [[Josce de Dinan]], who held [[Ludlow Castle]] in the Welsh marches for the Empress Matilda during the civil war between herself and [[Stephen, King of England|King Stephen]].&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=zvzWAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=fulk+fitz&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QBnbUJfkBMPz0gGGvYCQBA&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAQ Louis Branden, ''The history of Fulk Fitz-Warine'' (Alexander Moring Ltd., De la more Press London 1905) p. xi'']''&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout his lifetime he encountered numerous problems in receiving his patrimony and his other claims to land. These land disputes included estates his father held [[Tenant-in-chief|in-chief]] from the crown and others which he had held from the Peverel family as [[Lord|overlords]].

Other lawsuits concerned Whittington Castle held by the Peverels during the reign of King Stephen. Although he won the right to Whittington in or about 1195, he never received formal legal ''[[seisin]]'' and it remained in Welsh hands at the time of his death in 1197.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066–1272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Whittington Castle]] lies on the English side of [[Offa's Dyke]], which during the Norman era and before was the border between England and [[Wales]]. The site was fortified as a castle by [[William Peverel]] in 1138, in support of Empress Matilda, the daughter of King [[Henry I of England|Henry I]] (1100–1135), in her struggle (known as [[The Anarchy]]) for the throne against King Stephen (1135–1154), grandson of [[William the Conqueror]]. In the late 1140s the [[Marcher lord|lordship]] of [[Whittington, Shropshire|Whittington]], like [[Oswestry]] and Overton ceased to be part of England and became part of the [[Kingdom of Powys]] and a Welsh [[marcher lord]]ship.&lt;ref&gt;P. Brown, P. King, and P. Remfry, 'Whittington Castle: The marcher fortress of the Fitz Warin family', Shropshire Archaeology and History LXXIX (2004), 106–127.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1165 [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] granted the castle of Whittington on [[Roger de Powis]], a Welsh leader, to whom he gave funds for its repair in about 1173.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.castlewales.com/whittng.html John Northall, Whittington Castle'']''&lt;/ref&gt; Roger de Powis was followed by his son Meurig (or Maurice), who was followed by his son Werennoc. A rival claim was made by Fulk III FitzWarin (c. 1160–1258).&lt;ref name="FFWOCH97"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sidney Painter 1964 p. 52"&gt;Sidney Painter, ''The Reign of King John'' (Baltimore, The Johns Hopkins Press 1964) p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rebellions===
Fulk III continued the claim to Whittington made by his father. After his father's death in 1197 Fulk III offered [[feudal relief|relief]] of £100 for the inheritance of Whittington. However Maurice of Powis (d.1200), the son of Roger of Powis, who had offered half that amount, on 11 April 1200 was granted Whittington by [[John, King of England|King John]]. Again, after Maurice's death in August 1200, King John granted it to Maurice's heirs.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066–1272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not known why King John refused to recognise Fulk's claim to Whittington as his rightful inheritance but by April 1201 Fulk was in open rebellion against the King.  He was accompanied by approximately fifty-two followers including his brothers William, Phillip and John, his cousins, and by the family's many tenants and allies in the Marches.
&lt;ref name="FFWOCH97"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sidney Painter 1964 p. 52"/&gt;

Fulk's rebellion is not related in detail by chroniclers but was clearly considerable as in the spring of 1201, while King John crossed into [[Normandy]] and [[Poitou]] to suppress a revolt by the [[Lusignan dynasty|Lusignans]],&lt;ref&gt;Sidney Painter, ''The Reign of King John'' (Baltimore, The Johns Hopkins Press 1964) p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; he ordered [[Hubert de Burgh, 1st Earl of Kent|Hubert de Burgh]], with 100 knights, to counter the rebellion of Fulk and William Marsh, a [[Somerset]]shire knight who was raiding shipping off the coast of [[Devon]].&lt;ref&gt;Sidney Painter, ''The Reign of King John'' (Baltimore, The Johns Hopkins Press 1964) pp. 48, 84&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1202 Fulk and his men are reported to have taken refuge in [[Stanley Abbey]] in Wiltshire. Another man, Gilbert de Duure, is mentioned in records as "...having been an outlaw associated with Fulk Fitz Warin".  Yet another, Eustace de Kivilly, was pardoned earlier in 1202 by King John for "being associated with Fulk".&lt;ref&gt;Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066–1272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

After many years of being an outlaw, on 11 November 1203 Fulk was pardoned together with over thirty of his followers, including his brothers William,  Phillip and John and his cousins. In October 1204, on payment of a fine of 200 marks, Fulk at last received "right and inheritance" in Whittington.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Branden, ''The history of Fulk Fitz-Warine'' (Alexander Moring Ltd., De la more Press London 1905) p. xii'']''&lt;/ref&gt; Whittington Castle thereafter descended in the [[Baron FitzWarin|FitzWarin family]], all subsequent holders bearing the first-name Fulk, until the death of [[Fulk XI FitzWarin, 7th Baron FitzWarin]] (1405–1420) in 1420.&lt;ref&gt;Sidney Painter, ''The Reign of King John'' (Baltimore, The Johns Hopkins Press 1964) pps. 51–52&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1207 Fulk III was clearly highly regarded by many of the king's barons as evidenced by the identity of men known to have provided surety for Fulk's fine of 1,200 marks to marry the heiress daughter of Robert le Vavasur. The suretors included the Peverels, [[Alan Basset]], [[William de Braose (died 1230)|William de Braose]] (d.1230), a de Lacy, [[William Longespée, 3rd Earl of Salisbury]] and [[Henry de Bohun, 1st Earl of Hereford]].&lt;ref&gt;Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066–1272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 February 1214, when King John again set sail for [[Poitou]], Fulk was among the barons who accompanied him. He is believed then to have been  a vassal of [[Geoffrey FitzGeoffrey de Mandeville, 2nd Earl of Essex|Geoffrey de Mandeville]], Earl of Gloucester.&lt;ref&gt;Sidney Painter, ''The Reign of King John'' (Baltimore, The Johns Hopkins Press 1964) pp. 280, 294.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1215 Fulk was one of many giving great trouble to the [[Sheriff of Shropshire]]. Before 1216 and the accession of the infant King [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] (1216–1272), John's son, Fulk's manor of Alveston had been seized by the crown and in the following year 1217 all of his other lands in Gloucestershire were likewise seized. By 1218 however Fulk had made peace and his lands were ordered restored by the regents of [[Henry III of England|Henry III]].&lt;ref&gt;Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066–1272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), pp. 41, 43&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1220 Fulk had regained some favour with the young King Henry III and had been allowed to rebuild and fortify Whittington. In 1223 however it fell to [[Llywelyn the Great]], prince of Wales. Fulk  regained it the following year although his disputes with Llywelyn continued and more of Fulk's lands were seized.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066–1272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1228 a truce seems to have been reached between Fulk and Llywelyn following the intervention of the king.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066–1272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout these years Fulk's relations with the King were changeable and seemed to be directly dependent on the state of affairs in Wales. As a marcher lord Fulk's role as a protector of the English border against the Welsh was vital to the English King. He arbitrated several border disputes on behalf of the King and although there were more personal disagreements, there were no more rebellions on the part of Fulk III.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066–1272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), pp. 42, 43, 45&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriages and progeny==
Fulk III FitzWarin married twice:

#Joan FitzWarin&lt;ref name="BWF37"/&gt;
#Eva FitzWarin&lt;ref name="BWF37"/&gt;

*Fulk married secondly to Clarice de Auberville, daughter and heiress of Robert de Auberville of Iden and Iham, Sussex The progeny from this second marriage appears to have been a single surviving daughter:

#Mabel FitzWarin (−1297), who married 1stly William de Crevequer (no issue), and 2ndly John de Tregoz, Lord Tregoz (d. before 6 Sept 1300), by whom she had two daughters and coheirs, Clarice and Sybil&lt;ref name="Emma Cavell 2007, p. 174"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BWF37"/&gt;

==Death &amp; burial==
Fulk III lived to a great age and at some time before his death in 1258, he handed over control of much of his responsibilities to his son and heir Fulk IV. In 1252 he made his will in which he stated his wish to be buried at the priory he founded, Alberbury Priory.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.discovershropshire.org.uk/html/search/verb/GetRecord/theme:20070423145036 Discover Shropshire'']''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Romance of ''Fouke le Fitz Waryn''==
After Foulk's death he became the subject the famous "ancestral romance" known as '''''Fouke le Fitz Waryn''''', which contains a highly embellished account of his life and family history.&lt;ref&gt;Kathryn Bedford, 'Fouke le Fitz Waryn: Outlaw or Chivalric Hero?', ''British outlaws of literature and history: essays on medieval and early modern figures from Robin Hood to Twm Shon Catty'', ed. Alexander L Kaufman (Jefferson, NC : McFarland &amp; Co., 2011), pp. 99–99&lt;/ref&gt;

The biography of Fulk III survives in a French prose "ancestral [[romance (heroic literature)|romance]]", extant in a  manuscript containing English, French and [[Latin]] texts, which is based on a lost verse romance. A 16th-century summary of a [[Middle English]] version has also been preserved. The work is part of the [[Matter of England]].&lt;ref name=boundaries&gt;''Boundaries in medieval romance'', Neil Cartlidge, DS Brewer, 2008, {{ISBN|1-84384-155-X}}, 9781843841555. pp. 29–42&lt;/ref&gt; The outline of the work is as follows. As a young boy, Fulk was sent to the court of King [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] (1154–1189), where he grew up with the king's younger son, the future King [[John of England|John]] (1199–1216). John became his enemy after a childhood quarrel during a game of chess. As an adult, King John retained his animosity toward Fulk whom he stripped of his ancestral holdings. Fulk thereupon took to the woods as an outlaw and lived a life of adventure. The story may in fact  have confused aspects of the lives of two FitzWarins, Fulk I (d. 1171) and Fulk II (d. 1197), father and son. The romance of Fulk FitzWarin is noted for its parallels to the legend of [[Robin Hood]].&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to ''Fouke le Fitz Waryn'', edited by Stephen Knight and Thomas H. Ohlgren, originally published in ''Robin Hood and Other Outlaw Tales'', Kalamazoo, Michigan: Medieval Institute Publications, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Funeral games''' are athletic competitions held in honor of a recently deceased person.&lt;ref name="Chiu20042" /&gt;  The celebration of funeral games was common to a number of ancient civilizations.  Athletics and games such as [[wrestling]] are depicted on [[Sumer]]ian statues dating from approximately 2600 BC,&lt;ref name="Chiu20042"&gt;{{cite book|author = David Chiu|title = Wrestling: Rules, Tips, Strategy, and Safety|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=sbnc0G0CNAsC&amp;pg=PA5|accessdate = 17 August 2012|date = 1 August 2004|publisher = The Rosen Publishing Group|isbn = 978-1-4042-0187-3|pages = 5–}}&lt;/ref&gt; and funeral games are depicted in early [[Pottery of ancient Greece|Greek vases]], such as the [[François Vase|Francois vase]] at Florence and the Amphiaraus vase in Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Athletics In The Ancient World|last = Gardiner|first = E. Norman|publisher = Dover Publications|year = 2002|isbn = 0-486-42486-3|location = United Kingdom|pages = 20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In some accounts, funeral games were not merely held to honor the deceased, but in order to propitiate the spirits of those who had died.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Combat Sports In The Ancient World|last = Poliakoff|first = Michael B.|publisher = Yale University Press|year = 1987|isbn = 978-0-300-06312-7|location = Bethany, Connecticut|pages = 151–157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient Greece==
According to [[Athletics in epic poetry|literary tradition]], funeral games were a regular feature of [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenean Greek]] society.  The ''[[Iliad]]'' describes the funeral games held by [[Achilles]] in honor of [[Patroclus]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' book 23.&lt;/ref&gt; and a similar competition was attributed by [[Virgil]] to [[Aeneas]], who held games on the anniversary of his father's death.&lt;ref&gt;[[Virgil|Publius Vergilius Maro]], ''Aeneid'' book 5.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of the contests were similar to those held at the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic Games]], and although those were held in honor of [[Zeus]], many scholars see the origin of Olympic competition in these earlier funeral games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author = Wendy J. Raschke|title = Archaeology Of The Olympics: The Olympics &amp; Other Festivals In Antiquity|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=DwU1IlTEhrYC&amp;pg=PA22|accessdate = 12 August 2012|date = 15 June 1988|publisher = Univ of Wisconsin Press|isbn = 978-0-299-11334-6|pages = 22–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Historical examples of funeral games in [[ancient Greece]] are known from the late sixth century BC until the end of the [[Hellenistic period]].  They could celebrate either civic heroes, such as the founders of cities, or private individuals, and in either case might become annual events.&lt;ref name="Roller"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Funeral Games For Historical Persons|last = Roller|first = Lynn E.|journal=Stadion|year = 1981|pages = 1–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civic heroes===
Persons considered heroes sometimes became the focus of [[Greek hero cult|hero cults]], in which case funeral games might be held as part of their cult ritual.  In a civic context, games might be held to honor public figures acclaimed as heroes, or sometimes whole groups of people, such as soldiers from the city who had fallen in battle.  It was customary for the participants to be citizens of the towns where the games were held.&lt;ref name="Roller"/&gt;

One example of such games was held at [[Amphipolis]], in honor of the [[Sparta]]n general [[Brasidas]].  Brasidas had fallen in battle while capturing the city of Amphipolis during the [[Pelopponesian War]], in 422 BC.  After the battle, he became revered as the new founder of the city, displacing [[Hagnon, son of Nikias|Hagnon]], who established an [[Athens|Athenian]] colony there in 437.  Subsequently, Brasidas' funeral games became an annual event at Amphipolis.&lt;ref name="Roller"/&gt;

===Private individuals===
On the island of [[Amorgos]] in the [[Cyclades]], Aleximachus Critolaus held a series of funeral games at the town of Aigiale in honor of his son, Aleximachus.  The celebrations, which became an annual festival, included sacrifices, a banquet, and a variety of athletic competitions for which prizes were awarded.  The most important event was the [[pankration]]; but the dead Aleximachus was always declared the winner of this competition, suggesting that he had been an athlete himself.&lt;ref name="Roller"/&gt;

===Prizes===
A variety of prizes were awarded to the competitors at Greek funeral games. The most common prize was an [[olive wreath]] or crown, made from the branches of a sacred olive tree. This crown was the most revered prize awarded.  In the early period, other prizes awarded included useful commodities such as [[Sacrificial tripod|tripods]], [[kettle]]s, double cups, and various farm animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Homer|title=Iliad|location=lines 256-270}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In later times, precious metals such as gold, silver, bronze, or steel were also awarded.

==Pre-Christian Ireland==
Competitions known as [[Aonach]]s were held in [[Ireland]] in the [[Bronze Age]]. The most famous of which was the [[Tailteann Games (ancient)|Aonach Tailteann]] "Tailtin Fair", held at Tailtin ([[Teltown]]) in [[Mide]].  According to the ''[[Annals of the Four Masters|Annals of the Kingdom of Ireland]]'', the fair was established by the legendary king [[Lugh|Lugh Lámhfhada]] (reigned 1849 to 1809 BC) in honor of his foster-mother, [[Tailtiu]].&lt;ref&gt;''[https://archive.org/stream/annalsofkingdomo00odon#page/20/mode/2up Annals of the Kingdom of Ireland by the Four Masters: From the Earliest Period to the Year 1171]'' [[John O'Donovan (scholar)|John O'Donovan]], translator and editor (Dublin, 1849).&lt;/ref&gt;  These games are known to have been held during Ireland's medieval period, perhaps as early as the sixth century, but died out after the [[Norman Invasion of Ireland]] in the twelfth century.  Some sources date the games themselves to the midpoint of Lugh's reign, in 1829 BC, claiming that they predate the Greek Olympics by over a thousand years, and even that they were the inspiration for the Olympic Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author = William H.

{{nihongo|'''Hiroki Azuma'''|東 浩紀|Azuma Hiroki}} (born May 9, 1971) is a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[cultural critic]], [[novelist]], and [[philosopher]].  

==Biography==
Born in [[Mitaka, Tokyo]], he received his [[Ph.D.]] (in "Culture and Representation") from the [[University of Tokyo]] in 1999 and became a professor at the [[International University of Japan]] in 2003. He was an Executive Research Fellow and Professor at the [[Center for Global Communications]] (GLOCOM), and a Research Fellow at [[Stanford University]]'s [[Stanford Japan Center|Japan Center]]. Since 2006 he has been working at the [[Center for Study of World Civilizations]] at the [[Tokyo Institute of Technology]].

Azuma is married to the writer and poet Hoshio Sanae. They have one child. His father-in-law is the translator, novelist, and occasional critic Kotaka Nobumitsu.

==Work==
Hiroki Azuma is one of the most influential young [[literary criticism|literary critics]] in Japan, focusing on literature and on the idea of individual liberty in an age of ubiquitous information.

He began writing inspired by the work of [[Kojin Karatani]] and [[Akira Asada]]. He is an associate of [[Takashi Murakami]] and the [[Superflat]] movement. His publishing debut was "[[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn|Solzhenitsyn]] Essay" in 1993. Azuma handed the work directly to Karatani during his lecture series at [[Hosei University]] which Azuma was [[Academic audit|auditing]].

Azuma launched his career as a literary critic in 1993 with a postmodern style influenced by leading Japanese critics [[Kojin Karatani]] and [[Akira Asada]]. In the late 1990s, Azuma began examining various pop phenomena, especially the emerging [[otaku]]/[[Internet]]/[[video game]] culture, and became widely known as an advocate of the thoughts of a new generation of Japanese. He is interested in the transformation of the Japanese literary imagination under its current “otaku-ization.”

Azuma has published seven books, including ''Sonzaironteki, Yubinteki'' (''Ontological, Postal'') in 1998, which focuses on [[Jacques Derrida]]'s oscillation between literature and philosophy. This work won the [[Suntory Literary Prize]] in 2000 and made Azuma the youngest writer to ever win that prize. Akira Asada stated that it is one of the best books written in the 90s; however, [[Hiroo Yamagata]] pointed out that the book is based on the misunderstanding of [[Godel's incompleteness theorem]]. He also wrote ''Dobutsuka-suru Postmodern'' (''Animalizing Postmodernity'') (translated as ''Otaku: Japan's Database Animals'' in 2001), which analyzes Japanese pop culture through a postmodern lens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Ruh |first=Brian |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/brain-diving/2011-01-11 |title=Ace of Database |work=Anime News Network |date=11 Jan 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also set up a [[non-profit organization]] to encourage cutting-edge critics who might be shut out of the existing publishing world.

[[Image:New house under construction Pittsfield Township Michigan.JPG|thumb|right|225px|New home construction, [[Pittsfield Township, Michigan]]]]
'''Home construction''' is the process of constructing a home. Beginning with simple pre-historic shelters, home construction techniques have evolved to produce the vast multitude of living accommodations available today.  Different levels of wealth and power have warranted various sizes, luxuries, and even defenses in a "home".  Environmental considerations and cultural influences have created an immensely diverse collection of architectural styles.  From castles to mud thatches, mansions to shanties, the 'home' has grown to represent a seemingly limitless array of structures.

==History==
While homes may have originated in pre-history, there are many notable stages through which cultures pass to reach the current level of modernization.  Countries and communities throughout the world currently exhibit very diverse concepts of housing, at many different stages of home development.

==Finding or buying parts==
Two methods for constructing a home can be distinguished: the method in which architects simply assume free choice of materials and parts, and the method in which reclaimed materials are used, and the house is thus during its entire construction a "work in progress" (meaning every single aspect of it is subject to change at any given time, depending on what materials are found).

The second method has been used throughout history, as materials have always been scarce. Nowadays, more advanced sourcing maps (such as the [http://www.oogstkaart.nl/oogstkaart/ Superuse.org materials map]) have become available.

==Pieces and parts==
The modern family home has many more systems and facets of construction than one might initially believe.  With sufficient study, an average person can understand everything there is to know about any given phase of home construction.  The "[[do it yourself]]" (DIY) boom of the late twentieth century was due, in large part, to this fact. And an international proliferation of kitset home and prefabricated home suppliers, often consisting of components of Chinese origin has further increased supply and made DIY home building more prevalent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/business/your-property/9433590/NZs-framing-wars|title=NZ's framing wars|website=Stuff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Meister des Maréchal de Boucicaut 001.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The decoration of this page from a French [[Book of Hours]], c. 1400, includes a miniature, initials and borders]]

An '''illuminated manuscript''' is a [[manuscript]] in which the text is supplemented with such decoration as [[initial]]s, borders ([[marginalia]]) and [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniature illustrations]]. In the strictest definition, the term refers only to manuscripts decorated with either gold or silver; but in both common usage and modern scholarship, the term refers to any decorated or illustrated manuscript from Western traditions. Comparable Far Eastern and Mesoamerican works are described as painted. [[Islam]]ic manuscripts may be referred to as illuminated, illustrated or painted, though using essentially the same techniques as Western works. 

The earliest extant substantive illuminated manuscripts are from the period 400 to 600, produced in the [[Kingdom of the Ostrogoths]] and the [[Eastern Roman Empire]]. Their significance lies not only in their inherent artistic and historical value, but also in the maintenance of a link of literacy offered by non-illuminated texts. Had it not been for the [[monastic]] scribes of [[Late Antiquity]], most literature of Greece and Rome would have perished. As it was, the patterns of textual survivals were shaped by their usefulness to the severely constricted literate group of Christians. Illumination of manuscripts, as a way of aggrandizing ancient documents, aided their preservation and informative value in an era when new ruling classes were no longer literate, at least in the language used in the manuscripts.

The majority of extant manuscripts are from the [[Middle Ages]], although many survive from the [[Renaissance]], along with a very limited number from Late Antiquity. The majority are of a religious nature. Especially from the 13th century onward, an increasing number of secular texts were illuminated. Most illuminated manuscripts were created as [[codex|codices]], which had superseded [[scroll]]s. A very few illuminated fragments survive on [[papyrus]], which does not last nearly as long as [[vellum]] or [[parchment]]. Most medieval manuscripts, illuminated or not, were written on parchment (most commonly of [[calfskin|calf]], sheep, or goat skin), but most manuscripts important enough to illuminate were written on the best quality of parchment, called vellum.

Beginning in the [[Late Middle Ages]], manuscripts began to be produced on paper.&lt;ref&gt;The untypically early 11th century [[Missal of Silos]] is from Spain, near to Muslim paper manufacturing centres in [[Al-Andaluz]]. Textual manuscripts on paper become increasingly common, but the more expensive parchment was mostly used for illuminated manuscripts until the end of the period.&lt;/ref&gt; Very early printed books were sometimes produced with spaces left for [[rubric]]s and miniatures, or were given illuminated initials, or decorations in the margin, but the introduction of printing rapidly led to the decline of illumination. Illuminated manuscripts continued to be produced in the early 16th century but in much smaller numbers, mostly for the very wealthy. They are among the most common items to survive from the Middle Ages; many thousands survive. They are also the best surviving specimens of medieval painting, and the best preserved. Indeed, for many areas and time periods, they are the only surviving examples of painting.

==History==
{{main|History of miniature (illuminated manuscript)}}
Art historians classify illuminated manuscripts into their historic periods and types, including (but not limited to) Late Antique, [[Insular art|Insular]], [[Carolingian art|Carolingian manuscripts]], [[Ottonian art|Ottonian manuscripts]], [[Romanesque art|Romanesque manuscripts]], [[Gothic art|Gothic manuscripts]], and [[Renaissance art|Renaissance manuscripts]]. There are a few examples from later periods. The type of book most often heavily and richly illuminated, sometimes known as a "display book", varied between periods. In the first millennium, these were most likely to be [[Gospel Book]]s, such as the [[Lindisfarne Gospels]] and the [[Book of Kells]]. The Romanesque period saw the creation of many large illuminated complete [[Bible]]s – one in Sweden requires three librarians to lift it. Many [[Psalter]]s were also heavily illuminated in both this and the [[Gothic art|Gothic period]]. Single cards or posters of [[vellum]], [[leather]] or paper were in wider circulation with short stories or legends on them about the lives of saints, chivalry knights or other mythological figures, even criminal, social or miraculous occurrences; popular events much freely used by story tellers and itinerant actors to support their plays. Finally, the [[Book of Hours]], very commonly the personal devotional book of a wealthy layperson, was often richly illuminated in the Gothic period. Other books, both liturgical and not, continued to be illuminated at all periods. 

The [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] world produced manuscripts in its own style, versions of which spread to other Orthodox and Eastern Christian areas. The [[Islamic Golden Age|Muslim World]] and in particular the Iberian Peninsula, with their [[Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain|traditions of literacy]] uninterrupted by the Middle Ages, were instrumental in delivering ancient classic works to the growing intellectual circles and [[universities]] of Western Europe all through the 12th century, as books were produced there in large numbers and on [[History of paper|paper]] for the first time in Europe, and with them full treatises on the sciences, especially astrology and medicine where illumination was required to have profuse and accurate representations with the text.

The Gothic period, which generally saw an increase in the production of these artifacts, also saw more secular works such as [[chronicle]]s and works of literature illuminated. Wealthy people began to build up personal libraries; [[Philip the Bold]] probably had the largest personal library of his time in the mid-15th century, is estimated to have had about 600 illuminated manuscripts, whilst a number of his friends and relations had several dozen.

[[File:Books in the monastery museum (5494269533).jpg|thumb|Illuminated manuscripts housed in the 16th-century [[Ethiopian Orthodox Church|Ethiopian Orthodox church]] of [[Ura Kidane Mehret]], [[Zege Peninsula]], [[Lake Tana]], [[Ethiopia]]]]
Up to the 12th century, most manuscripts were produced in monasteries in order to add to the library or after receiving a [[Commission (art)|commission]] from a wealthy patron. Larger monasteries often contained separate areas for the [[monks]] who specialized in the production of manuscripts called a [[scriptorium]]. Within the walls of a scriptorium were individualized areas where a monk could sit and work on a manuscript without being disturbed by his fellow brethren. If no scriptorium was available, then “separate little rooms were assigned to book copying; they were situated in such a way that each scribe had to himself a window open to the cloister walk.”&lt;ref name="autogenerated1962"&gt;Putnam A.M., Geo. Haven. Books and Their Makers During The Middle Ages. Vol. 1. New York: Hillary House, 1962. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The separation of these monks from the rest of the cloister indicates just how revered these monks were within their society.

By the 14th century, the [[cloisters]] of monks writing in the scriptorium had almost fully given way to commercial urban scriptoria, especially in Paris, Rome and the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;De Hamel, 45&lt;/ref&gt; While the process of creating an illuminated manuscript did not change, the move from monasteries to commercial settings was a radical step. Demand for manuscripts grew to an extent that Monastic libraries began to employ secular scribes and illuminators.&lt;ref&gt;De Hamel, 57&lt;/ref&gt; These individuals often lived close to the monastery and, in instances, dressed as monks whenever they entered the monastery, but were allowed to leave at the end of the day. In reality, illuminators were often well known and acclaimed and many of their identities have survived.&lt;ref&gt;De Hamel, 65&lt;/ref&gt;

First, the manuscript was “sent to the [[rubricator]], who added (in red or other colors) the titles, [[headlines]], the initials of chapters and sections, the notes and so on; and then – if the book was to be illustrated – it was sent to the illuminator.”&lt;ref name="autogenerated1962"/&gt; In the case of manuscripts that were sold commercially, the writing would “undoubtedly have been discussed initially between the patron and the scribe (or the scribe’s agent,) but by the time that the written gathering were sent off to the illuminator there was no longer any scope for innovation.”&lt;ref&gt;De Hamel, Christopher. Medieval Craftsmen: Scribes and Illuminations. Buffalo: University of Toronto, 1992. p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Techniques ==
[[File:Roman de la Rose f. 28r (Author at writing desk).jpg|thumb|The author of a manuscript at his writing desk. 14th Century]]
Illumination was a complex and frequently costly process. It was usually reserved for special books: an altar Bible, for example. Wealthy people often had richly illuminated "[[book of hours|books of hours]]" made, which set down prayers appropriate for various times in the [[liturgy|liturgical day]].

In the early Middle Ages, most books were produced in monasteries, whether for their own use, for presentation, or for a commission. However, commercial [[Scriptorium|scriptoria]] grew up in large cities, especially [[School of Paris|Paris]], and in Italy and the Netherlands, and by the late 14th century there was a significant industry producing manuscripts, including agents who would take long-distance commissions, with details of the heraldry of the buyer and the saints of personal interest to him (for the calendar of a Book of hours). By the end of the period, many of the painters were women, perhaps especially in Paris.

=== Text ===
The text was usually written before the manuscripts were illuminated. Sheets of [[parchment]] or [[vellum parchment|vellum]] were cut down to the appropriate size. After the general layout of the page was planned (including the initial capitals and borders), the page was lightly ruled with a pointed stick, and the scribe went to work with ink-pot and either sharpened [[quill]] feather or reed pen. The script depended on local customs and tastes. The sturdy Roman letters of the early [[Middle Ages]] gradually gave way to scripts such as [[Uncial]] and half-Uncial, especially in the [[British Isles]], where distinctive scripts such as [[insular majuscule]] and [[insular minuscule]] developed. Stocky, richly textured [[blackletter]] was first seen around the 13th century and was particularly popular in the later Middle Ages.

Prior to the days of such careful planning, “A typical black-letter page of these [[Gothic art|Gothic]] years would show a page in which the lettering was cramped and crowded into a format dominated by huge ornamented capitals that descended from uncial forms or by illustrations.”&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Donald M. The Art of Written Forms: The Theory and Practice of Calligraphy. New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston, Inc, 1969. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; To prevent such poorly made manuscripts and illuminations from occurring a script was typically supplied first, “and blank spaces were left for the decoration. This pre-supposes very careful planning by the scribe even before he put pen to parchment.” If the [[scribe]] and the illuminator were separate labors the planning period allowed for adequate space to be given to each individual.

=== The process of illumination ===

[[Image:Thomas Becket Murder.JPG|thumb|A 13th-century manuscript illumination, the earliest known depiction of [[Thomas Becket]]'s assassination]]
The following steps outline the detailed labor involved to create the illuminations of one page of a manuscript:
# [[Silverpoint]] drawing of the design were executed
# Burnished gold dots applied
# The application of modulating colors
# Continuation of the previous three steps in addition to the outlining of marginal figures
# The penning of a rinceaux appearing in the border of a page
# The final step, the marginal figures are painted&lt;ref&gt;Calkins, Robert G. "Stages of Execution: Procedures of Illumination as Revealed in an Unfinished Book of Hours." International Center of Medieval Art 17.1 (1978): 61–70. JSTOR.org. Web. 17 April 2010. &lt;https://www.jstor.org/stable/766713&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The illumination and decoration was normally planned at the inception of the work, and space reserved for it. However, the text was usually written before illumination began. In the Early Medieval period the text and illumination were often done by the same people, normally monks, but by the [[High Middle Ages]] the roles were typically separated, except for routine initials and flourishes, and by at least the 14th century there were secular workshops producing manuscripts, and by the beginning of the 15th century these were producing most of the best work, and were commissioned even by monasteries. When the text was complete, the illustrator set to work. Complex designs were planned out beforehand, probably on wax tablets, the sketch pad of the era. The design was then traced or drawn onto the vellum (possibly with the aid of pinpricks or other markings, as in the case of the [[Lindisfarne Gospels]]). Many incomplete manuscripts survive from most periods, giving us a good idea of working methods.

At all times, most manuscripts did not have images in them. In the early Middle Ages, manuscripts tend to either be display books with very full illumination, or manuscripts for study with at most a few decorated initials and flourishes. By the Romanesque period many more manuscripts had decorated or [[historiated initial]]s, and manuscripts essentially for study often contained some images, often not in color. This trend intensified in the Gothic period, when most manuscripts had at least decorative flourishes in places, and a much larger proportion had images of some sort. Display books of the Gothic period in particular had very elaborate decorated borders of foliate patterns, often with small [[drolleries]]. A Gothic page might contain several areas and types of decoration: a miniature in a frame, a historiated initial beginning a passage of text, and a border with drolleries. Often different artists worked on the different parts of the decoration.

=== Use of color in illuminated manuscripts ===
While the use of gold is by far one of the most captivating features of illuminated manuscripts, the bold use of varying colors provided multiple layers of dimension to the illumination. From a religious perspective, "the diverse colors wherewith the book is illustrated, not unworthily represent the multiple grace of heavenly wisdom."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1962"/&gt; While religious authors view themselves as instilling a part of God's vast glory on the work, many illustrations can be linked to "the history of the texts that were required to be illustrated and the needs and tastes of the readers of those manuscripts."&lt;ref name="jrank1"&gt;"Manuscript." http://arts.jrank.org/pages/9716/Manuscript.html. Web. 17 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Color brought the images on the page to life and captivated the readers. Without color the impact of the image would have been completely lost.

=== Paints ===
The medieval artist's palette was broad; a partial list of pigments is given below. In addition, unlikely-sounding substances such as urine and earwax were used to prepare pigments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humanities.uci.edu/spanishandportuguese/spanish/medievaliberia/manuscript_glossary_O-P.html Iberian manuscripts (pigments)] {{webarchive |url=https://archive.is/20030329222834/http://www.humanities.uci.edu/spanishandportuguese/spanish/medievaliberia/manuscript_glossary_O-P.html |date=29 March 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--True, check this and other references before taking this as a joke!--&gt;

=== Gilding ===
[[Image:Sakramentarz tyniecki 02.jpg|thumb|The 11th-century ''Tyniec Sacramentary'' was written with gold on a purple background. [[National Library of Poland]], [[Warsaw]].]]
A manuscript is not considered illuminated unless one or many illuminations contained [[gold foil]] or was brushed with gold specks, a process known as ''burnishing''. The inclusion of gold alludes to many different possibilities for the text. If the text is of religious nature the gold is a sign of exalting the text. In the early centuries of Christianity, “[[Gospel]] manuscripts were sometimes written entirely in gold.”&lt;ref&gt;De Hamel, Christopher. The British Library Guide to Manuscript Illumination: History and Techniques. Toronto: University of Toronto, 2001. Print,52.&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from adding flashy decoration to the text, scribes during the time considered themselves to be praising God with their use of gold. In one particular instance, “The life of Christ executed on gold backgrounds with much greater richness in the midst of innumerable scenes of the chase, tourneys, games and grotesque subjects.”&lt;ref name="newadvent1910"&gt;Brehier, Louis. “Illuminated Manuscripts.” The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol.9. New York: Robert Appelton Company, 1910. 17 April 2010 http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09620a.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, gold was used if a patron who had commissioned a book to be written wished to display the vastness of his riches. Eventually, the addition of gold to manuscripts became so frequent, “that its value as a barometer of status with the manuscript was degraded.”&lt;ref&gt;De Hamel, Christopher. Medieval Craftsmen: Scribes and Illuminations. Buffalo: University of Toronto, 1992. Print,49.&lt;/ref&gt; During this time period the price of gold had become so cheap that its inclusion in an illuminated manuscript accounted for only a tenth of the cost of production.&lt;ref name="Brehier"&gt;Brehier, Louis. “Illuminated Manuscripts.” The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol.9. New York: Robert Appelton Company, 1910. 17 April 2010 http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09620a.htm, page 45.&lt;/ref&gt; By adding richness and depth to the manuscript, the use of gold in illuminations created pieces of art that are still valued today.

The application of gold leaf or dust to an illumination is a very detailed process that only the most skilled illuminators can undertake and successfully achieve. The first detail an illuminator considered when dealing with gold was whether to use [[gold leaf]] or specks of gold that could be applied with a brush. When working with gold leaf the pieces would be hammered and thinned until they were “thinner than the thinnest paper.”&lt;ref name="Brehier" /&gt; The use of this type of leaf allowed for numerous areas of the text to be outlined in gold. There were several ways of applying gold to an illumination one of the most popular included mixing the gold with stag’s glue and then “pour it into water and dissolve it with your finger.”&lt;ref&gt;Blondheim, D.S. "An Old Portuguese Work on Manuscript Illumination." The Jewish Quarterly Review, New Series 19.2 (1928): 97–135. JSTOR. Web. 17 April 2010. &lt;https://www.jstor.org/stable/1451766&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Once the gold was soft and malleable in the water it was ready to be applied to the page. Illuminators had to be very careful when applying gold leaf to the manuscript. Gold leaf is able to "adhere to any pigment which had already been laid, ruining the design, and secondly the action of burnishing it is vigorous and runs the risk of smudging any painting already around it."

== Patrons of illumination ==
Monasteries produced manuscripts for their own use; heavily illuminated ones tended to be reserved for liturgical use in the early period, while the monastery library held plainer texts. In the early period manuscripts were often commissioned by rulers for their own personal use or as diplomatic gifts, and many old manuscripts continued to be given in this way, even into the [[Early Modern]] period. Especially after the book of hours became popular, wealthy individuals commissioned works as a sign of status within the community, sometimes including [[donor portrait]]s or [[heraldry]]: "In a scene from the New Testament, Christ would be shown larger than an apostle, who would be bigger than a mere bystander in the picture, while the humble donor of the painting or the artist himself might appear as a tiny figure in the corner."&lt;ref name="jrank1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | edition = 1 | publisher = University of Toronto Press, Scholarly Publishing Division | isbn = 0-8020-8173-8 | last = Hamel | first = Christopher de | title = The British Library Guide to Manuscript Illumination: History and Techniques | page = 20 | date = 29 December 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/GlossH.asp|title = Heraldry|date = n.d.|accessdate = 14 December 2015|website = Glossary for Illuminated Manuscripts|publisher = British Library|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The calendar was also personalized, recording the feast days of local or family saints. By the end of the Middle Ages many manuscripts were produced for distribution through a network of agents, and blank spaces might be reserved for the appropriate heraldry to be added locally by the buyer.

Displaying the amazing detail and richness of a text, the addition of illumination was never an afterthought. The inclusion of illumination is twofold, it added value to the work, but more importantly it provides pictures for the illiterate members of society to "make the reading seem more vivid and perhaps more credible.”&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Susan. "Manuscript Illumination in Northern Europe". In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2000–. http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/manu/hd_manu.htm (October 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PSM V77 D530 Ilongot hunting party.png|thumb|right|An Ilongot hunting party.]]
The '''Ilongot''' (or '''Ibilao'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barrows|first=David P.|title=The Ilongot or Ibilao of Luzon|date=December 1910|journal=[[Popular Science Monthly]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TSMDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA521}}&lt;/ref&gt;) are a tribe who inhabit the southern [[Sierra Madre (Philippines)|Sierra Madre]] and [[Caraballo Mountains]], on the east side of [[Luzon]] in the [[Philippines]], primarily in the provinces of [[Nueva Vizcaya]] and [[Nueva Ecija]] and along the mountain border between the provinces of [[Quirino]] and [[Aurora (province)|Aurora]]. An alternative name of this tribe and its [[Ilongot language|language]] is "Bugkalot".{{cn|date=November 2015}} They are known as a tribe of headhunters.

Presently, there are about 87,000 Ilongots.&lt;ref&gt;https://joshuaproject.net/people_groups/12214/RP&lt;/ref&gt; The Ilongots tend to inhabit areas close to rivers, as they provide a food source and a means for transportation. Their native language is the [[Ilongot language]], currently spoken by about 50,000 people. They also speak the [[Ilocano language]].

== Culture ==
[[File:PSM V77 D538 Ilongot men and women clearing the ground for rice planting.png|thumb|Ilongot men and women clearing the ground for rice planting.]]
[[File:PSM V77 D532 Ilongot men and woman of oyao nueva vizcaya.png|thumb|upright=0.8|Photo taken in 1910 depicting Ilongot men and a woman in modern day Oyao in Nueva Vizcaya.]]
In Ivan Salva’s study in 1980 of the Ilongots, she described “gender differences related to the positive cultural value placed on adventure, travel, and knowledge of the external world.” Ilongot men, more often than women, visited distant places. They acquired knowledge of the outside world, amassed experiences there, and returned in order to share their knowledge, adventures, and feelings in a public oratory in order to pass on their knowledge to others. The Ilongot men received acclaim as a result of their experiences. Because they lacked external experience on which to base knowledge and expression, Ilongot women had inferior prestige. 

On the basis of Michelle Rosaldo’s study and findings of other stateless societies, anthropologists must distinguish between prestige systems and actual power within a society. Just because a male has a high level of prestige, he may not own much economic or political power compared to others that are less prestigious within the society.  

[[Renato Rosaldo]] went on to study [[headhunting]] among the Ilongots in his book ''Ilongot Headhunting, 1883-1974: A Study in Society and History''. He notes headhunting raids are often associated with bereavement, a rage and expiation at the loss of a loved one. 

Because of the early experiences of boys living in a close relationship with both parents, who each participate in "motherly" roles, they are relatively unconcerned about the need for achievement or even defaming women. Men involved in household chores do not claim submission to their wives. In social life, the Ilongots show little stratification and sexual inequality but it is certainly present. It is minimized by the fact that women have the right, as well as feel confident enough, to speak their minds. Finally, we find the home gender relations based on equality, focusing on cooperation instead of competition and there is a real intimacy between husband and wife. Rosaldo's conclusion is that perhaps the most egalitarian societies are those where no sex order authority exists, and where the focus of social life itself is the home.

==Mythology==
According to the Ilongot people, the creators of the universe are two quarrelling brothers. There original names have been lost due to the introduction of Roman Catholicism by the Spanish in the 16th to 19th centuries. Some people nowadays refer to them as Cain and Abel, which were taken from the bible, but are not their true names. Abel was a shepherd who is known to have been looked upon favourably due to his propensity to self-sacrifice. While Cain who worked in agriculture was known for his inclination towards chaos.

The Ilongot people identify those who live down in the lowlands as following the spirit of Abel. They view them as superior as well as having had learned to work with the domesticated animals such as [[Carabao]]. The Ilongot see themselves as following in the footsteps of Cain and his spirit of chaos. However, many sources conflict with this as the story may have been crafted decades ago by a Spanish implying that the lowlanders are 'more civilized' because they are 'Christians', which demeans the Ilongots and their own culture. Due to this, many Ilongots reject the side story of Cain and Abel.

Deities without Catholic renditions known to the Ilongots are:
*'''Taon''' - The god of the sky.
*'''Pandac''' - The god of the stars
*'''Delan''' - The moon, usually he and Elag are congenial and take turns giving light; but sometimes they quarrel and Elag covers Delan more or less with a great, huge winnowing bila-o (basket). Thus we have the different phases of the moon. He and Elag created mankind. The Christian-inspired Cain and Abel story conflicts with this as it states that it was Cain and Abel who created men instead.
*'''Elag''' - The sun, they worship him (it) so as the moon and stars because they give life and growth. He has a great, magnificent house in Gacay. When he gets tired giving light and goes into his house, it is night. He and Delan created mankind. The Christian-inspired Cain and Abel story conflicts with this as it states that it was Cain and Abel who created men instead.
*'''Gemang''' - The guardian of wild beasts. When a party of men is starting on a hunt, they build a fire, take hold of the dogs and the weapons and pass them one by one through the smoke. The last dog to be passed through the smoke is the leader of the pack. After taking it out of the smoke, the owner spits on its face, and rubs the saliva down its back and sides. Meanwhile, he has been talking and shouting to Gemang, saying: "Do not let our dogs get sick. You must give us one of your animals. Do not take the form of a wild beast so that the dogs chase you by mistake. If you will let the dogs catch one beast, then we will give you to eat and drink and likewise your wife." Following this ceremony, the part starts out in a successful hunt.
*'''Keat''' - The god of lightning.
*'''Kidy''' - The god of thunder
*'''Lampong''' - The dwarf shepherd of the wild animals.
*'''Oden''' – The rain, they worship him (it) for its life-giving water.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.phillife.co/ilongot-tribe-headhunters/&lt;/ref&gt;

{{IPA notice}}

This article is a technical description of the '''[[phonetics]] and [[phonology]] of [[Korean language|Korean]]'''. Unless otherwise noted, statements in this article refer to [[South Korean standard language]] based on the [[Gyeonggi dialect|Seoul dialect]].

[[Morphophoneme]]s are written inside vertical pipes ({{IPA|{{pipe}}&amp;nbsp;{{pipe}}}}), [[phoneme]]s inside slashes ({{IPA|/&amp;nbsp;/}}), and [[allophone]]s inside brackets ({{IPA|[&amp;nbsp;]}}).

==Consonants==
Korean has 19 consonant phonemes.&lt;ref name="Sohn"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Korean: Descriptive Grammar|last=Sohn|first=Ho-Min|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=1994|isbn=9780415003186|series=Descriptive Grammars|location=London|pages=432}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For each stop and affricate, there is a three-way contrast between unvoiced segments, which are distinguished as '''plain''', '''tense''', and '''aspirated'''.
*The "plain" segments, sometimes referred to as "lax" or "lenis," are considered to be the more "basic" or unmarked members of the Korean obstruent series.
*The "tense" segments, also referred to as "fortis," "hard," or "glottalized," have eluded precise description and have been the subject of considerable phonetic investigation. In the [[Korean alphabet]] as well as all widely used [[Romanization of Korean|romanization systems for Korean]], they are represented as doubled plain segments: {{lang|ko|ㅃ}} {{transl|ko|pp}}, {{lang|ko|ㄸ}} {{transl|ko|tt}}, {{lang|ko|ㅉ}} {{transl|ko|jj}}, {{lang|ko|ㄲ}} {{transl|ko|kk}}. As it was suggested from the Middle Korean spelling, the tense consonants came from the initial consonant clusters ''sC''-, ''pC''-, ''psC''-.&lt;ref name="Kim-Renaud"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nonRl2cerIgC&amp;pg=PA169|title=The Korean Alphabet: Its History and Structure|publisher=[[University of Hawaiʻi Press]]|year=1997|isbn=9780824817237|editor-last=Kim-Renaud|editor-first=Young-Key|location=Honolulu|pages=169–170|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown_Yeon"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ALv7CAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA38|title=The Handbook of Korean Linguistics|publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]]|year=2015|isbn=9781118370933|location=West Sussex, UK|editor1-last=Brown|editor1-first=Lucien|editor2-last=Yeon|editor2-first=Jaehoon}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|29, 38, 452}}
*The aspirated segments are characterized by [[aspirated consonant|aspiration]], a burst of air accompanied by the delayed [[Voice-onset time|onset of voicing]].
*The "plain" segments are also distinguished from the tense and aspirated phonemes by changes in vowel quality, including a relatively lower [[fundamental frequency|pitch]] of the following vowel.&lt;ref name="Cho_Jun_Ladefoged"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cho|first=Taehong|last2=Jun|first2=Sun-Ah|last3=Ladefoged|first3=Peter|year=2002|title=Acoustic and aerodynamic correlates of Korean stops and fricatives|url=http://site.hanyang.ac.kr/documents/24916/113960/Cho_Jun_Ladefoged_2002_JPhon.pdf|journal=[[Journal of Phonetics]]|volume=30|issue=2|pages=193–228|doi=10.1006/jpho.2001.0153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] diacritic {{angbr|{{IPA|◌͈}}}}, resembling a subscript double straight quotation mark, shown here with a placeholder circle, is used to denote the tensed consonants {{IPA|/p͈/, /t͈/, /k͈/, /t͈ɕ/, /s͈/}}.{{efn|Sometimes the tense consonants are marked with an apostrophe, {{angbr|{{IPA|ʼ}}}}, but that is not IPA usage; in the IPA, the apostrophe indicates [[ejective]] consonants.}} Its official use in the [[Extensions to the IPA]] is for [[Fortis and lenis|strong]] articulation, but is used in literature for [[faucalized voice]]. The Korean consonants also have elements of [[stiff voice]], but it is not yet{{When|date=May 2015}} known how typical that is of faucalized consonants. They are produced with a partially constricted [[glottis]] and additional subglottal pressure in addition to tense vocal tract walls, laryngeal lowering, or other expansion of the larynx.

An alternative analysis&lt;ref name="Kim_San"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kim|first=Mi-Ryoung|last2=San|first2=Duanmu|year=2004|title='Tense' and 'Lax' Stops in Korean|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262952103_Tense_and_Lax_Stops_in_Korean|journal=Journal of East Asian Linguistics|volume=13|issue=1|pages=59–104|doi=10.1023/B:JEAL.0000007344.43938.4e}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposes that the "tensed" series of sounds are (fundamentally) regular voiceless, unaspirated consonants: the "lax" sounds are voiced consonants that become devoiced initially, and the primary distinguishing feature between word-initial "lax" and "tensed" consonants is that initial [[Lax vowel|lax]] sounds cause the following vowel to assume a low-to-high pitch contour, a feature reportedly associated with voiced consonants in many Asian languages, whereas tensed (and also aspirated) consonants are associated with a uniformly high pitch.

{{IPA|/p, t, tɕ, k/}} are voiced {{IPA|[b, d, dʑ, ɡ]}} between voiced sounds but voiceless elsewhere. Among younger generations, they may be just as aspirated as {{IPA|/pʰ, tʰ, tɕʰ, kʰ/}} in initial position; the primary difference is that the following vowel carries a low tone.&lt;ref name="Kim_Beddor_Horrocks"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kim|first=Mi-Ryoung|last2=Beddor|first2=Patrice Speeter|last3=Horrocks|first3=Julie|year=2002|title=The contribution of consonantal and vocalic information to the perception of Korean initial stops|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095447001901524|journal=[[Journal of Phonetics]]|volume=30|issue=1|pages=77–100|doi=10.1006/jpho.2001.0152}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lee-K_Ramsey"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=2AmspKX3beoC&amp;pg=PA293|title=A History of the Korean Language|last=Lee|first=Ki-Moon|last2=Ramsey|first2=S.

{{IPA|/l/}} is an alveolar flap {{IPA|[ɾ]}} between vowels or between a vowel and an {{IPA|/h/}}; it is {{IPA|[l]}} or {{IPA|[ɭ]}} at the end of a word, before a consonant other than {{IPA|/h/}}, or next to another {{IPA|/l/}}. There is free variation at the beginning of a word, where this phoneme tends to become {{IPA|[n]}} before most vowels and silent before {{IPA|/i, j/}}, but it is commonly {{IPA|[ɾ]}} in English loanwords.

Between vowels, {{IPA|/h/}} may either be voiced to {{IPA|[ɦ]}} or deleted.

=== Positional allophones ===
Korean consonants have three principal positional allophones: initial, medial (voiced), and final (checked). The initial form is found at the beginning of [[phonological word]]s. The medial form is found in voiced environments, intervocalically and after a voiced consonant such as {{transl|ko|n}} or {{transl|ko|l}}. The final form is found in checked environments such as at the end of a phonological word or before an obstruent consonant such as {{transl|ko|t}} or {{transl|ko|k}}. Nasal consonants ({{transl|ko|m}}, {{transl|ko|n}}, {{transl|ko|ng}}) do not have noticeable positional allophones beyond initial denasalization, and {{transl|ko|ng}} cannot appear in this position.

The table below is out of alphabetical order to make the relationships between the consonants explicit:

All [[obstruent]]s (stops, affricates, fricatives) become stops with [[no audible release]] at the end of a word: all coronals collapse to {{IPA|[t̚]}}, all labials to {{IPA|[p̚]}}, and all velars to {{IPA|[k̚]}}.{{efn|The only fortis consonants to occur finally are {{lang|ko|ㄲ}} {{transl|ko|kk}} and {{lang|ko|ㅆ}} {{transl|ko|ss}}.}} Final {{lang|ko|ㄹ}} {{transl|ko|r}} is a [[Lateral consonant|lateral]] {{IPA|[l]}} or {{IPA|[ɭ]}}.

{{lang|ko|ㅎ}} {{transl|ko|h}} does not occur in final position,{{efn|Orthographically, it is found at the end of the name of the letter {{lang|ko|ㅎ}}, {{lang|ko|히읗}} {{transl|ko|hieut}}.}} though it does occur at the end of non-final syllables, where it affects the following consonant. (See below.) Intervocalically, it is realized as voiced {{IPA|[ɦ]}}, and after voiced consonants it is either {{IPA|[ɦ]}} or silent.

{{lang|ko|ㅇ}} {{transl|ko|ng}} does not occur in initial position, reflected in the way the hangeul jamo {{lang|ko|ㅇ}} has a different pronunciation in the initial position to the final position. These were distinguished when hangeul was created, with the jamo {{lang|ko|ㆁ}} with the upper dot and the jamo {{lang|ko|ㅇ}} without the upper dot; these were then conflated and merged in the standards for both the North Korean and South Korean standards. 

In native Korean words, {{lang|ko|ㄹ}} {{transl|ko|r}} does not occur word initially, unlike in Chinese loans ([[Sino-Korean vocabulary]]). In South Korea, it is silent in initial position before {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/j/}}, pronounced {{IPA|[n]}} before other vowels, and pronounced {{IPA|[ɾ]}} only in compound words after a vowel. The prohibition on word-initial {{transl|ko|r}} is called the "initial law" or {{transl|ko|[[dueum beopchik]]}} ({{lang|ko|두음법칙}}). Initial {{transl|ko|r}} is officially pronounced {{IPA|[ɾ]}} in North Korea. In both countries, initial {{transl|ko|r}} in words of foreign origin other than Chinese is pronounced {{IPA|[ɾ]}}.

* "labour" ({{lang|ko|勞動}}) – North Korea: {{transl|ko|'''r'''odong}} ({{lang|ko|로동}}), South Korea: {{transl|ko|'''n'''odong}} ({{lang|ko|노동}})
* "history" ({{lang|ko|歷史}}) – North Korea: {{transl|ko|'''ry'''ŏksa}} ({{lang|ko|력사}}), South Korea: {{transl|ko|'''y'''eoksa}} ({{lang|ko|역사}})

This rule also extends to {{lang|ko|ㄴ}} {{transl|ko|n}} in many native and all Sino-Korean words, which is also lost before initial {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/j/}} in South Korean; again, North Korean preserves the {{IPA|[n]}} phoneme there. 

* "female" ({{lang|ko|女子}}) – North Korea: {{transl|ko|'''ny'''ŏja}} ({{lang|ko|녀자}}), South Korea: {{transl|ko|'''y'''eoja}} ({{lang|ko|여자}})

Korean has eight vowel phonemes and a length distinction for each. Long vowels are pronounced somewhat more peripherally than short ones. Two more vowels, the [[mid front rounded vowel]] ({{IPAblink|ø̞|ø}} {{lang|ko|ㅚ}}) and the [[close front rounded vowel]] ({{IPAblink|y}} {{lang|ko|ㅟ}}),&lt;ref name="Ahn_Iverson"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.jbe-platform.com/content/books/9789027292162|title=Historical Linguistics 2005|last=Ahn|first=Sang-Cheol|last2=Iverson|first2=Gregory K.|publisher=[[John Benjamins]]|year=2005|isbn=9789027247995|editor-last=Salmons|editor-first=Joseph C.|location=Madison, WI|pages=275–293|chapter=Structured imbalances in the emergence of the Korean vowel system|doi=10.1075/cilt.284.21ahn|editor-last2=Dubenion-Smith|editor-first2=Shannon|chapter-url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=58DB2341AD27B2A08777AA5ABBB8266F?doi=10.1.1.557.3316&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|6}} can still be heard in the speech of some older speakers, but they have been largely replaced by the diphthongs {{IPA|[we]}} and {{IPA|[ɥi]}}, respectively.&lt;ref name="Brown_Yeon" /&gt;{{Rp|4–6}} In a 2003 survey of 350 speakers from Seoul, nearly 90% pronounced the vowel {{lang|ko|ㅟ}} as {{IPA|[ɥi]}}.&lt;ref name="Lee-I_Ramsey"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NN-yIdLOkCoC&amp;pg=PA66|title=The Korean Language|last=Lee|first=Iksop|last2=Ramsey|first2=S. Robert|publisher=[[SUNY Press]]|year=2000|isbn=0791448312|location=Albany, NY|pages=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, vowel length is reported almost completely neutralized in Korean, except for a very few older speakers of Seoul dialect,&lt;ref name="Kim-Renaud_Tranter"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=I7PTXPq_nSAC&amp;pg=PA127|title=The Languages of Japan and Korea|last=Kim-Renaud|first=Young-Key|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2012|isbn=9780415462877|editor-last=Tranter|editor-first=Nicolas|location=Oxon, UK|pages=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; for whom the distinctive vowel-length distinction is maintained only in the first syllable of a word.&lt;ref name="Lee-I_Ramsey" /&gt;

[[Middle Korean language|Middle Korean]] had an additional vowel phoneme denoted by {{lang|ko|ᆞ}}, known as {{transl|ko|arae-a}} (literally "lower a"). The vowel merged with {{IPAblink|a}} in all mainland varieties of Korean but remains distinct in [[Jeju language|Jeju]], where it is pronounced {{IPAblink|ɒ}}.

===Diphthongs and glides===
Because they may follow consonants in initial position in a word, which no other consonant can do, and also because of Hangul orthography, which transcribes them as vowels, [[semivowels]] such as {{IPA|/j/}} and {{IPA|/w/}} are sometimes considered to be elements of [[rising diphthong]]s rather than separate consonant phonemes.

In current pronunciation, {{IPA|/ɰi/}} merges into {{IPA|/i/}} after a consonant.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Some analyses treat {{IPA|/ɯ/}} as a central vowel and thus the marginal sequence {{IPA|/ɰi/}} as having a central-vowel onset, which would be more accurately transcribed {{IPA|[ȷ̈i]}} or {{IPA|[ɨ̯i]}}.&lt;ref name="Ahn_Iverson" /&gt;{{Rp|12}}

Modern Korean has no [[falling diphthong]]s, with sequences like {{IPA|/a.i/}} being considered as two separate vowels in [[hiatus (linguistics)|hiatus]]. Middle Korean had a full set of diphthongs ending in {{IPA|/j/}}, which monophthongized into the front vowels in Early Modern Korean ({{IPA|/aj/ &gt; /ɛ/}}, {{IPA|/əj/ [ej] &gt; /e/}}, {{IPA|/oj/ &gt; /ø/}}, {{IPA|/uj/ &gt; /y/}}, {{IPA|/ɯj/ &gt; /ɰi ~ i/}}).&lt;ref name="Ahn_Iverson" /&gt;{{Rp|12}} This is the reason why the hangul letters {{lang|ko|ㅐ}}, {{lang|ko|ㅔ}}, {{lang|ko|ㅚ}} and so on are represented as back vowels plus {{transl|ko|i}}.

== Assimilation ==

=== Vowel assimilation ===

The vowel that most affects consonants is {{IPA|/i/}}, which, along with its semivowel homologue {{IPA|/j/}}, palatalizes {{IPA|/s/}} and {{IPA|/s͈/}} to [[alveolo-palatal consonant|alveolo-palatal]] {{IPA|[ɕ]}} and {{IPA|[ɕ͈]}} for most speakers (but see [[differences in the language between North Korea and South Korea]]). As noted above, initial {{IPA|{{pipe}}l{{pipe}}}} is silent in this palatalizing environment, at least in South Korea. Similarly, an underlying {{IPA|{{pipe}}t{{pipe}}}} or {{IPA|{{pipe}}tʰ{{pipe}}}} at the ''end'' of a morpheme becomes a phonemically palatalized affricate {{IPA|/tɕʰ/}} when followed by a word or suffix beginning with {{IPA|/i/}} or {{IPA|/j/}} (it becomes indistinguishable from an underlying {{IPA|{{pipe}}tɕʰ{{pipe}}}}), but that does not happen within native Korean words such as {{IPA|/ʌti/}} {{IPA|[ʌdi]}} "where?".

{{IPA|/kʰ/}} is more affected by vowels, often becoming an affricate when followed by {{IPA|/i/}} or {{IPA|/ɯ/}}: {{IPA|[cçi]}}, {{IPA|[kxɯ]}}. The most variable consonant is {{IPA|/h/}}, which becomes a [[palatal consonant|palatal]] {{IPA|[ç]}} before {{IPA|/i/}} or {{IPA|/j/}}, a [[velar consonant|velar]] {{IPA|[x]}} before {{IPA|/ɯ/}}, and a [[bilabial consonant|bilabial]] {{IPA|[ɸʷ]}} before {{IPA|/o/}}, {{IPA|/u/}} and {{IPA|/w/}}.&lt;ref name="Shin_Kiaer_Cha"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Sounds-Korean-Professor-Jiyoung-Shin/dp/1107672686|title=The Sounds of Korean|last=Shin|first=Jiyoung|last2=Kiaer|first2=Jieun|last3=Cha|first3=Jaeeun|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2012|isbn=9781107672680|location=Cambridge|pages=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many morphological processes, a vowel {{IPA|/i/}} before another vowel may become the semivowel {{IPA|/j/}}. Likewise,{{IPA|/u/}} and {{IPA|/o/}}, before another vowel, may reduce to {{IPA|/w/}}. In some dialects and speech registers, the semivowel {{IPA|/w/}} assimilates into a following {{IPA|/e/}} or {{IPA|/i/}} and produces the front rounded vowels {{IPA|[ø]}} and {{IPA|[y]}}.

=== Consonant assimilation ===
As noted above, [[Tenuis consonant|tenuis]] stops and {{IPA|/h/}} are voiced after the voiced consonants {{IPA|/m, n, ŋ, l/}}, and the resulting voiced {{IPA|[ɦ]}} tends to be elided. Tenuis stops become fortis after obstruents (which, as noted above, are reduced to {{IPA|[k̚, t̚, p̚]}}); that is, {{IPA|/kt/}} is pronounced {{IPA|[k̚t͈]}}. Fortis and nasal stops are unaffected by either environment, though {{IPA|/n/}} assimilates to {{IPA|/l/}} after an {{IPA|/l/}}. After {{IPA|/h/}}, tenuis stops become aspirated, {{IPA|/s/}} becomes fortis, and {{IPA|/n/}} is unaffected.{{efn|Other consonants do not occur after {{IPA|/h/}}, which is uncommon in morpheme-final position.}} {{IPA|/l/}} is highly affected: it becomes {{IPA|[n]}} after all consonants but {{IPA|/n/}} (which assimilates to the {{IPA|/l/}} instead) or another {{IPA|/l/}}. For example, underlying {{IPA|{{pipe}}tɕoŋlo{{pipe}}}} is pronounced {{IPA|/tɕoŋno/}}.&lt;ref name="NHK"&gt;{{Cite book|title=ハングル入門|last=梅田|first=博之|publisher=NHK Publishing|year=1985|isbn=9784140350287|location=Tokyo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These are all ''progressive'' assimilation. Korean also has regressive (anticipatory) assimilation: a consonant tends to assimilate in [[manner of articulation|manner]] but not in [[place of articulation]]: Obstruents become nasal stops before nasal stops (which, as just noted, includes underlying {{IPA|{{pipe}}l{{pipe}}}}), but do not change their position in the mouth. Velar stops (that is, all consonants pronounced {{IPA|[k̚]}} in final position) become {{IPA|[ŋ]}}; coronals ({{IPA|[t̚]}}) become {{IPA|[n]}}, and labials ({{IPA|[p̚]}}) become {{IPA|[m]}}. For example, {{IPA|{{pipe}}hanku'''k'''mal{{pipe}}}} is pronounced {{IPA|/hanku'''ŋ'''mal/}} (phonetically {{IPA|[hanɡuŋmal]}}).&lt;ref name="NHK" /&gt;

Before the fricatives {{IPA|/s, s͈/}}, coronal obstruents assimilate to a fricative, resulting in a [[geminate]]. That is, {{IPA|{{pipe}}tʰs{{pipe}}}} is pronounced {{IPA|/ss͈/}} ({{IPA|[s͈ː]}}).  A final {{IPA|/h/}} assimilates in both place and manner, so that {{IPA|{{pipe}}h[[consonant|C]]{{pipe}}}} is pronounced as a geminate (and, as noted above, aspirated if C is a stop). The two coronal sonorants, {{IPA|/n/}} and {{IPA|/l/}}, in whichever order, assimilate to {{IPA|/l/}}, so that both {{IPA|{{pipe}}nl{{pipe}}}} and {{IPA|{{pipe}}ln{{pipe}}}} are pronounced {{IPA|[lː]}}.&lt;ref name="NHK" /&gt;

There are lexical exceptions to these generalizations. For example, voiced consonants occasionally cause a following consonant to become fortis rather than voiced; this is especially common with {{IPA|{{pipe}}ls{{pipe}}}} and {{IPA|{{pipe}}ltɕ{{pipe}}}} as {{IPA|[ls͈]}} and {{IPA|[lt͈ɕ]}}, but is also occasionally seen with other sequences, such as {{IPA|{{pipe}}kjʌ.u'''lp'''aŋhak{{pipe}}}} ({{IPA|[kjʌu'''lp͈'''aŋak̚]}}), {{IPA|{{pipe}}tɕʰa'''mt'''oŋan{{pipe}}}} ({{IPA|[tɕʰa'''mt͈'''oŋan]}}) and {{IPA|{{pipe}}weja'''ŋk'''anɯlo{{pipe}}}} ({{IPA|[weja'''ŋk͈'''anɯɾo]}}).&lt;ref name="NHK" /&gt;

# Final labial obstruents: {{lang|ko|ㅂ}} {{transl|ko|b}}, {{lang|ko|ㅍ}} {{transl|ko|p}}

The resulting geminate obstruents, such as {{IPA|[k̚k͈]}}, {{IPA|[ss͈]}}, {{IPA|[p̚pʰ]}}, and {{IPA|[t̚tɕʰ]}} (that is, {{IPA|[k͈ː]}}, {{IPA|[s͈ː]}}, {{IPA|[pʰː]}}, and {{IPA|[tːɕʰ]}}), tend to reduce ({{IPA|[k͈]}}, {{IPA|[s͈]}}, {{IPA|[pʰ]}}, {{IPA|[tɕʰ]}}) in rapid conversation. Heterorganic obstruent sequences such as {{IPA|[k̚p͈]}} and {{IPA|[t̚kʰ]}} may, less frequently, assimilate to geminates ({{IPA|[p͈ː]}}, {{IPA|[kːʰ]}}) and also reduce ({{IPA|[p͈]}}, {{IPA|[kʰ]}}).

These sequences assimilate with following vowels the way single consonants do, so that for example {{IPA|{{pipe}}ts{{pipe}}}} and {{IPA|{{pipe}}hs{{pipe}}}} palatalize to {{IPA|[ɕɕ͈]}} (that is, {{IPA|[ɕ͈ː]}}) before {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/j/}}; {{IPA|{{pipe}}hk{{pipe}}}} and {{IPA|{{pipe}}lkʰ{{pipe}}}} affricate to {{IPA|[kx]}} and {{IPA|[lkx]}} before {{IPA|/ɯ/}}; {{IPA|{{pipe}}ht{{pipe}}}}, {{IPA|{{pipe}}s͈h{{pipe}}}}, and {{IPA|{{pipe}}th{{pipe}}}} palatalize to {{IPA|[t̚tɕʰ]}} and {{IPA|[tɕʰ]}} across morpheme boundaries, and so on.

[[Hangul]] orthography does not generally reflect these assimilatory processes, but rather maintains the underlying [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] in most cases.

==Phonotactics==

Korean syllable structure is maximally /CGVC/, where /G/ is a glide {{IPA|/j, w, ɰ/}}. Any consonant except {{IPA|/ŋ/}} may occur initially, but only {{IPA|/p, t, k, m, n, ŋ, l/}} may occur finally. Sequences of two consonants may occur between vowels, as outlined above. However, morphemes may also end in CC [[consonant cluster|clusters]], which are  both expressed only when they are followed by a vowel. When the morpheme is not suffixed, one of the consonants is not expressed; if there is a {{IPA|/h/}}, which cannot appear in final position, it will be that. Otherwise it will be a coronal consonant (with the exception of ㄼ), and if the sequence is two coronals, the voiceless one ({{IPA|/s, tʰ, tɕ/}}) will drop, and {{IPA|/n/}} or {{IPA|/l/}} will remain. Thus, no sequence reduces to {{IPA|[t̚]}} in final position.

When such a sequence is followed by a consonant, the same reduction takes place, but a trace of the lost consonant may remain in its effect on the following consonant. The effects are the same as in a sequence between vowels: an elided obstruent will leave the third consonant fortis, if it is a stop, and an elided {{IPA|{{pipe}}h{{pipe}}}} will leave it aspirated. Most conceivable combinations do not actually occur;{{efn|For example, morpheme-final {{IPA|{{pipe}}lp{{pipe}}}} occurs only in verb roots such as {{lang|ko|밟}} {{transl|ko|balb}} and is followed by only the consonants {{transl|ko|d}}, {{transl|ko|j}}, {{transl|ko|g}}, {{transl|ko|n}}.}} a few examples are {{IPA|{{pipe}}lh-tɕ{{pipe}}}} = {{IPA|[ltɕʰ]}}, {{IPA|{{pipe}}nh-t{{pipe}}}} = {{IPA|[ntʰ]}}, {{IPA|{{pipe}}nh-s{{pipe}}}} = {{IPA|[ns͈]}}, {{IPA|{{pipe}}ltʰ-t{{pipe}}}} = {{IPA|[lt͈]}}, {{IPA|{{pipe}}ps-k{{pipe}}}} = {{IPA|[p̚k͈]}}, {{IPA|{{pipe}}ps-tɕ{{pipe}}}} = {{IPA|[p̚t͈ɕ]}}; also {{IPA|{{pipe}}ps-n{{pipe}}}} = {{IPA|[mn]}}, as {{IPA|/s/}} has no effect on a following {{IPA|/n/}}, and {{IPA|{{pipe}}ks-h{{pipe}}}} = {{IPA|[kʰ]}}, with the {{IPA|/s/}} dropping out.

Traditionally, the Korean language has had strong [[vowel harmony]]; that is, in pre-modern Korean, not only did the inflectional and derivational affixes (such as [[postposition]]s) change in accordance to the main root vowel, but native words also adhered to vowel harmony.  It is not as prevalent in modern usage, although it remains strong in [[onomatopoeia]], [[adjective]]s and [[adverb]]s, [[interjection]]s, and [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugation]]. There are also other traces of vowel harmony in Korean.

There are three classes of vowels in Korean: positive, negative, and neutral. The vowel {{lang|ko|ㅡ}} (eu) is considered partially a neutral and negative vowel. The vowel classes loosely follow the negative and positive vowels; they also follow orthography. Exchanging positive vowels with negative vowels usually creates different nuances of meaning, with positive vowels sounding diminutive and negative vowels sounding crude:

*'''Onomatopoeia:'''
** {{lang|ko|퐁당퐁당}} ({{transl|ko|p'''o'''ngd'''a'''ng-p'''o'''ngd'''a'''ng}}) and {{lang|ko|풍덩풍덩}} ({{transl|ko|p'''u'''ngd'''eo'''ng-p'''u'''ngd'''eo'''ng}}), light and heavy water splashing
*'''Emphasised adjectives:'''
** {{lang|ko|노랗다}} ({{transl|ko|n'''o'''r'''a'''ta}}) means plain yellow, while its negative, {{lang|ko|누렇다}} ({{transl|ko|n'''u'''r'''eo'''ta}}) means very yellow
** {{lang|ko|파랗다}} ({{transl|ko|p'''a'''r'''a'''ta}}) means plain blue, while its negative, {{lang|ko|퍼렇다}} ({{transl|ko|p'''eo'''r'''eo'''ta}}) means deep blue
*'''Particles at the end of verbs:'''
** {{lang|ko|잡다}} ({{transl|ko|j'''a'''pda}}) (to catch) → {{lang|ko|잡았다}} ({{transl|ko|j'''a'''b'''a'''tda}}) (caught)
** {{lang|ko|접다}} ({{transl|ko|j'''eo'''pda}}) (to fold) → {{lang|ko|접었다}} ({{transl|ko|j'''eo'''b'''eo'''tda}}) (folded)
*'''Interjections:'''
** {{lang|ko|아이고}} ({{transl|ko|'''a'''ig'''o'''}}) and {{lang|ko|어이구}} ({{transl|ko|'''eo'''ig'''u'''}}) expressing surprise, discomfort or sympathy
** {{lang|ko|아하}} ({{transl|ko|'''a'''h'''a'''}}) and {{lang|ko|어허}} ({{transl|ko|'''eo'''h'''eo'''}}) expressing sudden realization and mild objection, respectively

== Dialectal pitch accents ==
Several dialects outside Seoul retain the Middle Korean [[pitch accent]] system. In the [[Gyeongsang dialect|dialect of Northern Gyeongsang]], in southeastern South Korea, any syllable may have pitch accent in the form of a high tone, as may the two initial syllables. For example, in trisyllabic words, there are four possible tone patterns:&lt;ref name="Jun_Kim_Lee_Jun"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jun|first=Jongho|last2=Kim|first2=Jungsun|last3=Lee|first3=Hayoung|last4=Jun|first4=Sun-Ah|year=2006|title=The prosodic structure and pitch accent of Northern Kyungsang Korean|url=http://ling.snu.ac.kr/jun/work/JEAL_final.pdf|journal=Journal of East Asian Linguistics|volume=15|issue=4|pages=289–317|doi=10.1007/s10831-006-9000-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Land of the Giants''''' is an hour-long American [[science fiction television]] program lasting two seasons beginning on September 22, 1968, and ending on March 22, 1970.  The show was created and produced by [[Irwin Allen]]. ''Land of the Giants'' was the fourth of Allen's science fiction TV series. The show was aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and released by [[20th Century Fox Television]]. The series was filmed entirely in color and ran for 51 episodes. The show starred [[Gary Conway]] and special guest star [[Kurt Kasznar]].

Five novels based on the television series, including three written by acclaimed science fiction author [[Murray Leinster]], were published in 1968 and 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

== Show premise ==
[[File:Land of the giants cast.JPG|thumb|left|200px|The travelers are trapped in a giant zoo.]]

Set fifteen years in the then future year  1983, the series tells the tale of the crew and passengers of a [[sub-orbital]] transport ship named ''Spindrift''. In the pilot episode, the ''Spindrift'' is en route from [[Los Angeles]] to [[London]], on an ultra fast sub-orbital flight. Just beyond Earth's boundary with space, the ''Spindrift'' encounters a magnetic space storm, and is dragged through a space warp to a mysterious planet where everything is twelve times larger than on Earth, whose inhabitants the Earthlings nickname "the Giants." The ''Spindrift'' crash-lands, and the damage renders it inoperable.

Very little is known about the home planet of the Giants. This is partially because the ''Spindrift'' crew very seldom leave the area where their spaceship crashes in the opening episode. Only two other (unidentified) giant societies are ever seen, in the episodes "The Land of the Lost" and "The Secret City of Limbo."

No name is ever established for the mysterious planet, but the inhabitants seem to know of Earth, Venus and Mars, referring to them by name in one episode. Exactly where the planet is located is also never made clear. In the episode "On a Clear Night You Can See Earth," Captain Steve Burton (Gary Conway) claims to have seen Earth through a set of infrared goggles invented by the giants, implying that the two planets are near enough to see one from the other. The only established method by which Earth people may reach the giants' planet is high-altitude flight, passing through what one giant calls a "dimension lock".

Although various episodes establish that at least six other flights have landed on the planet, no episode confirms anyone ever returning to Earth. The first mention of other visitors from Earth was in episode 2, "Ghost Town," in which another ship was said to have crashed long ago without any survivors. In episode 4, "Underground," another Earth ship is described as crashing three years previously, again with no survivors.

Several episodes show crews surviving the initial crash, only to be killed later. The episode "Brainwash" has a crew of little people surviving long enough to build a radio station that can communicate with Earth. They are killed shortly after that. The episodes "Golden Cage" and "The Lost Ones" show there have been a few survivors of other crashes. Only the ''Spindrift'' crew seems to have survived for long with its party intact.

One continent, or hemisphere, is dominated by an authoritarian government which tolerates full freedoms within a capitalist system, but it does not tolerate any effort to effect political change. Exactly what the political situation is on other continents is not known, although at least one overseas land has a despotic ruler. The Air Traffic Control tells those who venture out to sea that they should turn back, that nothing beyond that sea has been explored nor is there current contact; whether this is an official government line or the truth is not known.

Culturally, the Giant society closely resembles the contemporary United States of 1968 (in various episodes it has a police force, private hospitals, prisons, a State Governor, radio and television services, a zoo, jazz clubs, even a racetrack - and the Giants speak English, drive American cars, attend Vaudeville-style theatres, and even play chess). The Earth people find themselves able to cope, and their efforts to get around are facilitated by the ubiquity of large drains leading directly from interior rooms to the pavement, in an outside wall of most buildings. The Giant government has offered a reward for the capture of the small Earth people (whom the Giants call ''the little people'').

In spite of the authoritarianism, there are several dissident movements at work that either help other dissenters (such as the Earth people) or are actively working to unseat the ruling party. The government has established the SID, Special Investigations Department, to deal with assorted dissidents but it also takes the lead in dealing with the Earth people. The Giant technology mostly resembles mid-20th century Earth, but inconsistently: significantly more advanced in some episodes (e.g. cloning, cybernetics, force fields, magnetic stunners, androids, and teleporters) and slightly behind in others (no microelectronics, hearing aids, or manned space flight).

The little people's objectives are: (1) survival, by obtaining food and avoiding capture by the Giants or attacks from animals, such as cats and dogs; and (2) repair of their spacecraft, so they can attempt to return to Earth. They largely manage to survive by the help of sympathizers and stealth, making the most of their small size, plus their ingenuity in using their technology where it's superior to that of the Giants.

They do not achieve the second objective, as the primary systems of the craft are severely damaged, although in some episodes (including "The Flight Plan") Burton implies it is only a lack of fuel which prevents the ship lifting off. The secondary systems are insufficient to enable them to achieve the sub-orbital flight required. They are unable to use Giant technology, as it is bulky and less advanced; in one episode an experimental nuclear reactor, provided by an engineering student, produces dangerous side effects and is prone to overloading. They also cannot trust the Giants, who in another episode ("Target: Earth") offer the little people a ride home in exchange for technical assistance with their space program, but then double-cross them.

They are aided in the first goal, and at least somewhat hindered in the second, by the leadership of Captain Burton. He behaves as a leader, and as protector to the passengers and crew, and his leadership has rescued them from some difficulties. But Burton also tries to keep the Giants from ever reaching Earth. In the episode "Brainwash," Giant police officer Ashim (Warren Stevens) says "Maybe we can find the home planet of these little people. It may be a very tiny world, but rich beyond our dreams." In several episodes, Burton puts keeping the Giants away from Earth above the need to get his people home. At the end of those episodes, he destroys devices that would get the ''Spindrift'' back to Earth but which would probably enable the Giants to journey there too.

Episodes often have the Giants capturing one of the passengers or crew, with the rest having to effect a rescue. The Earth people avoid capture most of the time, because their spaceship is hidden in a wood (in several episodes, described by the Giants as a park) outside the city limits. They also occasionally form alliances with individual Giants for some common beneficial purpose.

The show had no proper conclusion about the humans' attempts to return to Earth, and the final episode, "Graveyard of Fools," was a universal tale that could have taken place anytime in the second season. The penultimate episode, "Wild Journey" (guest starring [[Bruce Dern]]), has Steve and Dan using alien technology to travel back in time to Earth just a few hours before their ill-fated flight. In a storyline lifted from the ''[[Lost In Space]]'' episode "The Time Merchant," they attempt to alter the timeline but only succeed in ensuring that the events of the first episode, "The Crash," take place (footage from the pilot, where ''Spindrift'' becomes lost, is included in this episode), creating a ''Twilight Zone''-style twist ending, with the impression of a recurring cycle of inevitable events. This episode would have been more effective as the final episode of the season, mirroring Irwin Allen's earlier series ''[[The Time Tunnel]],'' in which the events of the final episode return the characters to their starting point in the pilot episode, "[[The Time Tunnel#Episodes|Rendezvous with Yesterday]]"; and ''Land of the Giants'' makes more sense with "Wild Journey" switched for "Graveyard of Fools" in reruns.

The first season comprised a regular 26 episodes, but season two was left one episode short, having only 25 episodes, leaving the impression that "Graveyard of Fools" was not originally intended to be the final episode of the Season. The show thus comprises only 51 episodes (or 52 episodes including the unaired pilot).

== Production ==

The show was created by Irwin Allen. With a budget of US$250,000 per episode, ''Land of the Giants'' set a new record.&lt;ref name="mcneil"/&gt; The actors had to be physically fit, as they had to do many stunts, such as climbing giant curbs, phone cords and ropes. Don Marshall, who played the part of Dan Ericson, credited his previous football, track and pole vaulting work for helping him with the stunts required.&lt;ref&gt;Actor Database [http://www.actordatabase.com/donmarshall/interview.htm Interview with Don Marshall]&lt;/ref&gt;

Elements of Allen's ''[[Lost in Space]]'' series recur in ''Land of the Giants'', notably the relationship between foolish, greedy, on-the-run bank robber Alexander B. Fitzhugh ([[Kurt Kasznar]]) and the young boy Barry Lockridge ([[Stefan Arngrim]]), paralleling the relationship on ''[[Lost in Space]]'' between Doctor Smith and the young Will Robinson. Also, for main cast billing, Kasznar was treated contractually in the same manner as Jonathan Harris had been on ''Lost In Space'': billed in last place on the opening credit sequence, but billed as ''Special Guest Star'' (even though he was a series regular). Apart from this, Gary Conway received solo star billing in the opening credits, with the other regulars all receiving ''also starring'' billing.

The show was originally intended to premiere as a mid-season replacement in the spring of 1968, and the first 12 episodes were shot in the fall of 1967. This was changed and ''Giants'' premiered in September 1968 for a [[List of Land of the Giants episodes|full season]]. The network screened the episodes in a significantly different order to the production sequence. This caused disconcerting lapses in continuity, since in the first 12 episodes filmed (but not in later episodes) the Giants moved slowly and hardly spoke. For example, "Ghost Town" was the 14th episode filmed (i.e. was ''not'' one of the original 12 episodes), but was the second episode aired.

[[File:Land of the Giants Stefan Arngrim 1969.jpg|thumb|Large hand in a scene from the second season, which featured [[Stefan Arngrim]] as Barry Lockridge.]]
The cost of production was immense, partly because of the special optical effects needed to matte the little people into shots also showing the giants; and partly because of the gigantic mechanical props needed, for the little people to interact with, in shots depicting the giant-sized world they find themselves in; plus the futuristic spacecraft sets that were needed to represent the ''Spindrift''. Because of the enormous cost, it was more efficient and cost-effective to film episodes in pairs using the same sets; so writers were informed about what giant-size props there were available, which they could incorporate into their storylines. These episodes were filmed back-to-back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Abbott |first=Jon |title=Irwin Allen Television Productions, 1964–1970: A Critical History of Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea, Lost in Space, the Time Tunnel and Land of the Giants |year=2009 |publisher=McFarland|page=284|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Gq-uf3wB-TcC&amp;dq=%22land+of+the+giants%22+critical|isbn=9780786486625 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To save on production costs, Allen was not above using the same device he had employed on ''The Time Tunnel'': re-using stock footage from 20th Century Fox's film library. For instance, in the episode ''Collector's Item'', footage of Wayne Manor from ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' is recycled as the luxury mansion home of a rich giant.

In the unaired pilot of ''The Crash'', there is no end scene with the giant dog in the garbage dump. Once it had been confirmed that ''Land of the Giants'' had been picked up by the network, the pilot was reworked and production began on succeeding episodes. However, a break in production occurred after 12 episodes were in the can (enough for a short run as a mid-season replacement), until the show received the green light on the decision to launch it as a full season the following fall.

==Music==
Like Allen's previous series ''[[Lost in Space]]'' and ''[[The Time Tunnel]]'', the theme music was composed by [[John Williams]]. As with ''Lost in Space'', Williams composed two different themes (in this case one for each season). Williams also scored the pilot episode "The Crash," and was the third composer to be attached to the project - Williams' work  replaced a rejected score and theme by [[Alexander Courage]]; Joseph Mullendore composed a second theme that was also thrown out.&lt;ref&gt;Jon Burlingame, pg. 115, ''TV's Biggest Hits: The Story of Television Themes From "Dragnet" To "Friends"'', Schirmer Books, 1996, {{ISBN|0-02-870324-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mullendore later scored five episodes and Courage did one, with other episodes scored by [[Richard LaSalle]] (seven episodes), [[Leith Stevens]] (five), Harry Geller (four), [[Irving Gertz]], [[Paul Sawtell]] and [[Robert Prince (composer)|Robert Prince]] (one each).

===Soundtrack===

[[GNP Crescendo]] released an album as part of ''The Fantasy Worlds Of Irwin Allen'', featuring both themes, Williams' replacement score (tracks 2-6) and Courage's thrown-out score (tracks 9 and 10) for "The Crash."

All 51 episodes were released on DVD in Region 1 in a limited-edition 9-disc Complete Series on July 24, 2007 from [[20th Century Fox Home Entertainment]]. This includes the un-aired original pilot, which has some differences (extra scenes but not others later added to the aired version) and score music familiar to Lost In Space fans and interviews with cast members.&lt;ref&gt;TV Shows on dvd.com [http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Land-Giants/7227 Land Of The Giants, Complete Series Press Release] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221114008/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Land-Giants/7227 |date=2009-02-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Region 2, [[Revelation Films]] has released the entire series on DVD in the UK. Season 1 was released on March 28, 2011 and season 2 on June 13, 2011.  They also released a complete series set on March 12, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Land-The-Giants-Complete-Collection/dp/B006WYBLE2|title=Land Of The Giants - The Complete Collection [DVD]|work=amazon.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Region 4, [[Madman Entertainment]] released season 1 on DVD in Australia on August 20, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.madman.com.au/catalogue/view/20723/land-of-the-giants-the-complete-first-season|title=Land of the Giants: The Complete First Season|work=Madman Entertainment}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Merchandise and licensing==
The pilot episode was the subject of a [[View-Master]] reel and booklet set in 1968 (GAF Packet # B494).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.3dstereo.com/viewmaster/dbarg-b494-g1a.html&lt;/ref&gt; One notable difference between the aired episode and the reel set is an image of the ''Spindrift'' flying through the giant forest in apparent daylight. In the aired episode, the ''Spindrift'' arrives on the giants' planet during the night, and its flight through the forest also occurs that same night. Though the following is unconfirmed, either the daylight shot was a special effects sequence cut from the aired pilot, or a special setup for the View Master photographers.

In 1968, Pyramid Books published an extended novel adaptation of the pilot (''Land of the Giants'', [[Jove Books|Pyramid Books]], X-1846), written by famed author [[Murray Leinster]]. Among notable changes or inventions is that the Spindrift is still an operational, flying ship after the initial crash, with enough "atomic power" to last as much as several months. Another invention for the novel is the knowledge that two other ships, the ''Anne'' and ''Marintha'', disappeared via the same mysterious phenomenon that sends the ''Spindrift'' to the giants' planet. The ''Spindrift'' castaways encounter a female survivor of the ''Anne'', named Marjorie, who joins the castaways in this novel. Although the television series featured three episodes with other on-screen survivors from previously lost Earth-flights, the novel's character Marjorie and the ships ''Anne'' and ''Marintha'' do not appear and are not mentioned in the series.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Land-Giants-Pyramid-SF-X-1846/dp/B00005XLQS&lt;/ref&gt;

There were two further novels by Murray Leinster&amp;nbsp;— ''The Hot Spot''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Land-Giants-Spot-Murray-Leinster/dp/B000O06QTU&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Unknown Danger''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Danger-Land-Giants-3/dp/B005OSBOVM&lt;/ref&gt; (Pyramid, 1969). The first two Leinster books were reprinted in 1969 in the United Kingdom by World Distributors, the eponymous novel retitled ''The Trap.''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Land-Giants-Trap-Murray-Leinster/dp/B0011172YY&lt;/ref&gt; Unknown Danger was not published in the UK, but World Distributors also published two United Kingdom-only novels the same year, ''Slingshot for a David''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Giants-SLINGSHOT-DAVID-James-Bradwell/dp/0723544085&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Mean City'';&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Mean-City-Land-Giants/dp/0723544093&lt;/ref&gt; both were credited to James Bradwell, a pseudonym for Arthur William Charles Kent.

A hardback novel for children, ''Flight of Fear'' by Carl Henry Rathjen (1969), was published in the United States by Whitman.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Land-Giants-Flight-Fear/dp/B000IL9LQU&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1968, [[Gold Key Comics]] published a comic book version of ''Land of the Giants'',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.comics.org/issue/244704/&lt;/ref&gt; which ran to five issues.&lt;ref&gt;http://beachbumcomics.blogspot.co.uk/2014/10/whats-happening-to-us-gold-keys-land-of.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, all five issues were reprinted together as a hardcover book by Hermes Press.

In 1968, Aurora Plastics Company produced two plastic model kits based on the series: ''Land of the Giants'' was the title of a diorama depicting a giant snake attacking characters Steve Burton, Betty Hamilton and Dan Erickson, who uses a giant safety-pin as a spear.&lt;ref&gt;http://culttvman.com/main/tony-hardys-land-of-the-giants-snake/&lt;/ref&gt; The second kit was a model of the ''Spindrift'', released as ''Land of the Giants Space Ship'', instead of using the proper name for the vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;http://culttvman.com/main/tag/spindrift/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, Aurora re-issued the kit (now renamed ''Rocket Transport Spindrift''), with new box art and photos of the assembled kit.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.monstersinmotion.com/cart/spaceships-vehicles-item-listt-c-13_194/land-of-the-giants-spindrift-aurora-re-issue-model-kit-p-15172&lt;/ref&gt; It had a front top section which could be lifted off, revealing a full interior that had to be constructed by the builder, as well as a working door. Most of the model kit was molded in the same bright red-orange as the ship itself, while the interior was molded in a light green which could be painted.

Deanna Lund (Valerie Scott) co-wrote a series of short stories based on the series, under the collective title "Valerie in Giant Land".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.deannalund.com/valerieingiantland.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

[[MeTV]] began airing ''Land Of The Giants'' in September 2016 to complement its Saturday night Sci-Fi line-up of other Irwin Allen series: ''Voyage To The Bottom Of The Sea'', ''Lost In Space'' and ''The Time Tunnel''. Prior to debuting on MeTV, ''Land Of The Giants'' had aired only sporadically in syndication in recent years. The Horror Channel in the UK aired the series in full from September 19, 2016,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.horrorchannel.co.uk/shows.php?title=land+of+the+giants&lt;/ref&gt; showing one episode a day on weekdays, across ten weeks.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2330">'''Law without the state''' (also called '''transnational stateless law''', '''stateless law''', or '''private legal orderings''')  is [[law]] made primarily outside of the power of a [[State (polity)|state]]. 

Such law may be established in several ways:

* It may emerge in systems such as existed in [[Feudalism|feudal Europe]] prior to the emergence of the modern [[nation state]] with the [[treaty of Westphalia]].&lt;ref name=Berman&gt;{{cite book |last=Berman |first=Harold J. |year=1983 |title=Law and Revolution: the Formation of the Western Legal Tradition |publisher= |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Emily Kadens, 'Myth of the Customary Law Merchant' (2011) 90 Texas Law Review 1153.&lt;/ref&gt;  

* It can be established as [[customary law]] such as that practiced by indigenous communities.&lt;ref name=vanSchooten&gt;{{cite book |last1=van Schooten |first1=H. |last2=Verschuuren |first2=J. |year=2008 |title=International Governance and Law: State Regulation and Non-state Law |location=Cheltenham |publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing |isbn= |ref=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bekker&gt;JC Bekker ''Seymour's Customary Law in Southern Africa'' 5 ed (1989).&lt;/ref&gt;

The following is a list of notable '''films that are incomplete or partially lost'''. Films that were never completed in the first place do not qualify, nor do cuts made from films prior to release. For films for which no footage (including trailers) is known to have survived, see [[List of lost films]].

|| 1940 || ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' || Various Directors || [[Deems Taylor]] || For its 60th Anniversary DVD release in 2000, Disney's manager of film restoration, Scott MacQueen, supervised a restoration and reconstruction of the original 125-minute roadshow version of ''Fantasia''. The visual elements from the [[Deems Taylor]] segments that had been cut from the film in 1942 and 1946 were restored, as was the intermission. However, the original nitrate audio negatives for the long-unseen Taylor scenes had deteriorated several decades earlier, so Disney brought in voice actor [[Corey Burton]] to dub all of Taylor's lines. Although it was advertised as the "original uncut" version, the Sunflower edit in ''Beethoven's Symphony No. 6'' made in 1969 was maintained. In this version, it was accomplished by digitally zooming in on certain frames to avoid showing the black centaurette character. ||

When the studio balked, the film was cut to 180 minutes.  After the poorly received premiere, the picture was cut, against Kurosawa's wishes, to 166 minutes.  No print of the 265-minute version is known to exist; Kurosawa supposedly spent a week looking through the studio archives for the original cut when he returned to Shochiku studios 40 years later to make ''[[Rhapsody in August]]''.||
|-
|| ''[[The Red Badge of Courage (film)|The Red Badge of Courage]]'' || [[John Huston]] || [[Audie Murphy]], [[Bill Mauldin]], [[Douglas Dick]], [[Royal Dano]] || Huston had high hopes for the movie, even considering the original two-hour cut of the film as the best he had ever made as a director. After a power struggle at the top of MGM management, the film was cut from a two-hour epic to the 69-minute version released to theaters, in response to its alleged universally disastrous previews. It was never released as an "A" feature but was shown as a second-feature "B" picture. Both Huston and star Audie Murphy tried unsuccessfully to purchase the film so that it could be re-edited to its original length. Huston did not waste any time fighting over it, as he was focused on the pre-production of his next picture, ''[[The African Queen (film)|The African Queen]]''. The studio claimed that the cut footage was destroyed, probably in the [[1965 MGM vault fire]]. In 1975, MGM asked Huston whether he had an original cut of the film, which the studio wanted to re-release. He had actually struck a 16mm print, but by that time, it had been lost. Unless an undiscovered copy exists of the uncut version, ''The Red Badge of Courage'' will never be viewed as Huston intended.||

In the first two decades of the 21st century, the studio reused the ''Rodan'' trailer, editing it so that only the scenes from ''Godzilla'' and ''Godzilla Raids Again'' remained. Rodan's roar is still heard near the end, however. The original trailer for ''Godzilla Raids Again'' was found in 2016, missing the soundtrack. It is included on the Japanese Blu-ray release of the film. ||&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1K3p9buv9E |title=Godzilla Raids Again (1955) - Newsflash/Special Announcement}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The total running time of 143 minutes was cut to 116 for later re-release and export, reputedly over Ichikawa's objection. The original 143-minute version is lost. ||

The remaining lost roadshow footage was tracked down in 2013 as part of a restoration effort to return the film to its original roadshow length. A majority of the scenes found were complete; the remainder were missing either the sound or the visuals, as they were derived from original 70mm roadshow prints that were themselves edited down from Kramer's original cut.

This moralistic warning shows the disastrous results of an ill-considered marriage for money and satirises patronage and aesthetics.  The pictures are exhibited in the [[National Gallery, London]].

This series of paintings were not received as well as his other moral tales, ''[[A Harlot's Progress]]'' (1732) and ''[[A Rake's Progress]]'' (1735), and when they were finally sold in 1751, it would be for a much lower sum than the artist had hoped for.&lt;ref name=brit/&gt;

==General commentary==
In ''Marriage A-la-Mode,'' Hogarth challenges the traditional view that the rich live virtuous lives with a heavy satire on the notion of arranged marriages. In each piece, he shows the young couple and their family and acquaintances at their worst: engaging in affairs, drinking, gambling, and numerous other vices. This is regarded by many {{who|date=August 2015}} as his finest project, certainly the best example of his serially-planned story cycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cle.ens-lyon.fr/anglais/marriage-a-la-mode-187675.kjsp?RH=CDL_ANG110201|title=Marriage à-la-mode byHogarth|publisher=cle.ens-lyon.fr|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*In the first of the series, ''[[Marriage à-la-mode: 1. The Marriage Settlement|The Marriage Settlement]]'' (the name on its frame), called ''The marriage contract'' by Hogarth,&lt;ref name=cowley/&gt; he shows an [[arranged marriage]] between the son of bankrupt Earl Squanderfield and the daughter of a wealthy but [[miser]]ly city merchant. Construction on the earl's new mansion, visible through the window, has stopped, and a usurer negotiates payment for further construction at the center table. The [[gout]]y earl proudly points to a picture of his family tree, rising from [[William the Conqueror]]. The son views himself in the mirror, showing where his interests in the matter lie. The distraught merchant's daughter is consoled by the lawyer Silvertongue while polishing her wedding ring. Even the faces on the walls appear to have misgivings. Two dogs chained to each other in the corner mirror the situation of the young couple.
*In the second, ''[[Marriage à-la-mode: 2. The Tête à Tête|The Tête à Tête]]'' (the name on its frame), called ''Shortly after the marriage'',&lt;ref name=cowley/&gt; there are signs that the marriage has already begun to break down. The husband and wife appear uninterested in one another, amidst evidence of their separate overindulgences the night before. A small dog finds a lady's cap in the husband's coat pocket, indicating his adulterous ventures. A broken sword at his feet shows that he has been in a fight. The open posture of the wife also indicates unfaithfulness. As Hogarth once noted: "A lock of hair falling thus cross the temples ... has an effect too alluring to be strictly decent, as is very well known to the loose and lowest class of women."&lt;ref name=brit&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110429215843/https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pd/w/william_hogarth%2C_marriage_a-la.aspx "William Hogarth, Marriage A-la-Mode, Plate II, etching and engraving"] [[The British Museum]].&lt;/ref&gt; The disarray of the house and the servant holding a stack of unpaid bills shows that the affairs of the household are a mess.
*The third in the series, ''[[Marriage à-la-mode: 3. The Inspection|The Inspection]]'' (the name on its frame), called ''The visit to the quack doctor'' by Hogart, shows the viscount (the earl's son) visiting a [[Quackery|quack]] with a young prostitute. According to one interpretation, the viscount, unhappy with the mercury pills meant to cure his [[syphilis]], demands a refund while the young prostitute next to him dabs an open sore on her mouth, an early sign of syphilis. But according to the analysis of Judy Egerton, the curator of the National Gallery's exhibition, the interpretation is very different: The viscount has brought the child to the doctor because he believes he has infected her with syphilis. The woman with the knife is the girl's mother, feigning anger in order to blackmail the viscount, who is being set up. The child already had the disease when her mother sold her to him, either because he was not her first "protector" or because she inherited the illness from her syphilitic father, who is the quack doctor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.william-hogarth.de/ArtCriticMarriage.html|title=Art Critic London: Hogarth's Marriage A-la-Mode|website=www.william-hogarth.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the fourth, ''[[Marriage à-la-mode: 4. The Toilette|The Toilette]]'' (the name on its frame), called ''The countess’s morning levee'' by Hogart,&lt;ref name=cowley/&gt; the old earl has died, so the son is now the new earl and his wife is the countess. The countess sits with her back to her guests, oblivious to them, as a servant attends to her toilette (grooming). The lawyer Silvertongue from the first painting is reclining next to the countess, suggesting the existence of an affair. This point is underlined by the child in front of the pair, pointing to the horns on the statue of [[Actaeon]], a symbol of [[cuckoldry]]. Paintings in the background include the biblical story of [[Lot (Bible)|Lot]] and his daughters, [[Jupiter and Io]], and the rape of [[Ganymede (mythology)|Ganymede]].&lt;ref&gt;The Norton Anthology of English Literature: The Restoration and the Eighteenth Century, 7th ed., p. 2657&lt;/ref&gt;  The Actaeon and several other figurines are seen marked for auction. Such paintings show the African, presumed to be untamed fetish-worshipper and hunter, now fashioned into an icon of courtly style.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ape to Apollo, Aesthetics and the Idea of Race in the 18th Century|last=Bindman|first=David|publisher=Reaktion Books Ltd|year=2002|isbn=0-8014-4085-8|location=United Kingdom|pages=41–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*In the fifth painting, ''[[Marriage à-la-mode: 5. The Bagnio|The Bagnio]]'' (the name on its frame), called ''The killing of the earl'' by Hogart,&lt;ref name=cowley/&gt; the new earl has caught his wife in a [[bagnio]] with her lover, the lawyer, and is fatally wounded. As she begs forgiveness from the stricken man, the murderer in his nightshirt makes a hasty exit through the window. A picture of a woman with a squirrel on her hand hanging behind the countess contains lewd undertones.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Malcolm. Folklore Motifs in Late Medieval Art III: Erotic Animal Imagery. Folklore, Vol. 102, No. 2 (1991), pp. 199–201.&lt;/ref&gt; Masks on the floor indicate that the couple have been at a masquerade.
*Finally, in the sixth painting, ''[[Marriage à-la-mode: 6. The Lady's Death|The Lady's Death]]'' (the name on its frame), called ''The suicide of the countess'' by Hogart,&lt;ref name=cowley/&gt; the countess poisons herself in her grief and poverty-stricken widowhood, after her lover is hanged at [[Tyburn, London|Tyburn]] for murdering her husband. An old woman carrying her baby allows the child to give her a kiss, but the mark on the child's cheek and the caliper on her leg suggest that disease has been passed onto the next generation. The countess's father, whose miserly lifestyle is evident in the bare house, removes the wedding ring from her finger.

These pictures were at first poorly received by the public, to the great disappointment of the artist. He sold them to a Mr. Lane of Hillington for one hundred and twenty [[guineas]]. The frames alone had cost Hogarth four guineas each, so his initial remuneration for painting this valuable series was only sixteen shillings over a hundred pounds. From Mr. Lane's estate, they became the property of his nephew, Colonel Cawthorn. In May 1796 they were sold by auction at [[Christie's]], [[Pall Mall, London|Pall Mall]], for the sum of one thousand guineas; the purchaser was [[John Julius Angerstein]]. They are now owned by the British government and are part of the collection of the [[National Gallery (London)|National Gallery]].

It had been Hogarth's intention to follow the ''Marriage A-la-Mode'' series with a companion series called ''The Happy Marriage'', however, this series was never completed and only exists as a series of unfinished sketches. &lt;!-- hid this unsourced speculation, see also equally valid other speculation after this Hogarth's loss of interest was probably because a conventional and happy marriage gave little opportunity for barbed and ironic treatment of events. -- what about the lack of success of the previous series?--&gt;

==Technical commentary==

Although this series of paintings are works of art in their own right, their original purpose was to provide the subjects for the series of engraved copper plate prints. By the nature of the process, when engraving copper plates, the image engraved on the plate by the engraver is reversed, that is to say, a mirror image of the final print. Normally, when undertaking paintings that are to be engraved, the painting is produced the "right way round" — not reversed – and then the engraver views it in a mirror as he undertakes the engraving. Hogarth was an engraver himself and disliked this course of action using mirrors, so unusually, he produced the paintings for Marriage à-la-mode already reversed so the engraver could directly copy them.

It would normally be expected to view the series of prints moving from left to right and Hogarth would have taken this into account when composing the original paintings.

==Naming==
Commentators have used a variety of names for the individual paintings, but as the paintings are presently in the National Gallery the names used there are used here.

In [[folklore]], a '''mermaid''' is an aquatic creature with the head and upper body of a female [[human]] and the tail of a [[fish]].&lt;ref name="oxforddictionaries1"/&gt; Mermaids appear in the folklore of many cultures worldwide, including the Near East, Europe, Asia, and Africa. The first stories appeared in ancient [[Assyria]], in which the goddess [[Atargatis]] transformed herself into a mermaid out of shame for accidentally killing her human lover. Mermaids are sometimes associated with perilous events such as floods, storms, shipwrecks, and drownings. In other folk traditions (or sometimes within the same tradition), they can be benevolent or beneficent, bestowing boons or falling in love with humans.

The male equivalent of the mermaid is the [[merman]], also a familiar figure in folklore and heraldry.  Although traditions about and sightings of mermen are less common than those of mermaids, they are generally assumed to co-exist with their female counterparts.

Some of the attributes of mermaids may have been influenced by the [[Siren (mythology)|Sirens]] of [[Greek mythology]].  Historical accounts of mermaids, such as those reported by [[Christopher Columbus]] during his exploration of the Caribbean, may have been inspired by [[manatee]]s and similar aquatic mammals.  While there is no evidence that mermaids exist outside folklore, reports of mermaid sightings continue to the present day, including 21st century examples from Israel and Zimbabwe.

Mermaids have been a popular [[Sea in culture|subject of art and literature]] in recent centuries, such as in [[Hans Christian Andersen]]'s well-known fairy tale "[[The Little Mermaid]]" (1836). They have subsequently been depicted in operas, paintings, books, films and comics.

=== Sirenia ===
[[Sirenia]] is an order of fully aquatic, herbivorous [[mammal]]s that inhabit rivers, estuaries, coastal marine waters, swamps and marine wetlands. Sirenians, including [[manatee]]s and [[dugong]]s, possess major aquatic adaptations: arms used for steering, a paddle used for propulsion, and remnants of hind limbs (legs) in the form of two small bones floating deep in the muscle. They look ponderous and clumsy but are actually fusiform, hydrodynamic and highly muscular, and mariners before the mid-nineteenth century referred to them as mermaids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.underwatertimes.com/news.php?article_id=05297681013 |title=Experts: Sea cow 'sirens' fuel mermaid mythology; sailors' deprivation sparked images |date=December 25, 2005 |work= Underwater times |accessdate=October 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sirenomelia]], also called "mermaid syndrome", is a rare [[congenital]] [[disease|disorder]] in which a child is born with his or her legs fused together and small [[sex organ|genitalia]].

== Folklore ==

As the anthropologist A. Asbjørn Jøn noted: "these 'marine beasts' have featured in folk tradition for many centuries now, and until relatively recently they have maintained a reasonably standard set of characteristics. Many folklorists and mythographers deem that the origin of the mythic mermaid is the [[dugong]], posing a theory that mythicised tales have been constructed around early sightings of dugongs by sailors." &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Dugongs and Mermaids, Selkies and Seals  | year = 1978 | page = 95 | first = A.

The first known mermaid [[folklore|stories]] appeared in [[Assyria]] c. 1000 BC.  The goddess [[Atargatis]], mother of Assyrian queen [[Semiramis]], loved a mortal (a shepherd) and unintentionally killed him. Ashamed, she jumped into a lake and took the form of a [[fish]], but the waters would not conceal her divine beauty. Thereafter, she took the form of a mermaid&amp;nbsp;— human above the waist, fish below&amp;nbsp;— although the earliest representations of Atargatis showed her as a fish with a human head and arm, similar to the [[Babylonia]]n god [[Ea (Babylonian god)|Ea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rostovtseff|first=M.|title=Hadad and Atargatis at Palmyra|journal=American Journal of Archaeology|volume=37|issue=1|date=January 1933|pages=58–63|jstor=498042|doi=10.2307/498042}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Greeks recognized Atargatis under the name Derketo.&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]] 16.785; [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], ''Natural History'' 5.81.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometime before 546 BC, [[Milesian school|Milesian]] philosopher [[Anaximander]] postulated that mankind had sprung from an aquatic animal species. He thought that humans, who begin life with prolonged [[infancy]], could not have survived otherwise.

A popular Greek legend turned [[Alexander the Great]]'s sister, [[Thessalonice of Macedon|Thessalonike]], into a mermaid after her death,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|publisher=MPT |format=[[PDF]] |url=http://www.mpt.org/programsinterests/mpt/alexander/guide/teachers_guide.pdf |title=Alexander |contribution=Teacher's Guide |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409111935/http://www.mpt.org/programsinterests/mpt/alexander/guide/teachers_guide.pdf |archivedate=April 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; living in the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]]. She would ask the sailors on any ship she would encounter only one question: "Is King Alexander alive?" ({{lang-el|"Ζει ο Βασιλεύς Αλέξανδρος}};"), to which the correct answer was: "He lives and reigns and conquers the world" (Greek: "Ζει και βασιλεύει και τον κόσμον κυριεύει").  This answer would please her, and she would accordingly calm the waters and bid the ship farewell.  Any other answer would enrage her, and she would stir up a terrible storm, dooming the ship and every sailor on board.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Mermaids and Ikons: A Greek Summer | year = 1978 | page = 73 | first = Gwendolyn | last = MacEwen | author-link = Gwendolyn MacEwen | isbn = 978-0-88784-062-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Folktales from Greece | page = 96 | isbn = 1-56308-908-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second century AD, the Hellenized Syrian writer [[Lucian|Lucian of Samosata]] wrote about the Syrian temples he had visited in his treatise ''[[On the Syrian Goddess]]'', which was originally written in [[Ionic Greek]]:

: "Among them&amp;nbsp;– Now that is the traditional story among them concerning the temple. But other men swear that Semiramis of Babylonia, whose deeds are many in [[Asia]], also founded this site, and not for [[Hera]] but for her own mother, whose name was Derketo."
: "I saw Derketo's likeness in [[Phoenicia]], a strange marvel. It is woman for half its length; but the other half, from thighs to feet, stretched out in a fish's tail. But the image in [[Jerusalem|the Holy City]] is entirely a woman, and the grounds for their account are not very clear. They consider fish to be sacred, and they never eat them; and though they eat all other [[fowl]]s they do not eat the [[dove]], for they believe it is holy. And these things are done, they believe, because of Derketo and Semiramis, the first because Derketo has the shape of a fish, and the other because ultimately Semiramis turned into a dove. Well, I may grant that the temple was a work of Semiramis perhaps; but that it belongs to Derketo I do not believe in any way. For among the [[Egyptians]] some people do not eat fish, and that is not done to honor Derketo."&lt;ref&gt;Lucian of Samosata, ''De Dea Syria'' Part 2, Chapter 14, translated by Harold W. Atridge and Robert A. Oden, 1976&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''[[Natural History (encyclopedia)|Natural History]]'' 9.4.9-11, [[Pliny the Elder]] describes numerous sightings of mermaids off the coast of [[Gaul]], noting that their bodies were covered all over in scales and that their corpses frequently washed up on shore. He comments that the governor of Gaul even wrote a letter to [[Emperor Augustus]] to inform him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hansen|first1=William|title=The Book of Greek &amp; Roman Folktales, Legends &amp; Myths|date=2017|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, New Jersey|isbn=9780691170152|pages=169–170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' collection includes several tales featuring "sea people", such as "Djullanar the Sea-girl".&lt;ref name=Irwin&gt;{{Cite book|title= One Thousand and One Nights: A Companion|first = Robert | last=Irwin|publisher=[[I.B. Tauris|Tauris Parke Paperbacks]]| year=2003| isbn=1-86064-983-1| page = 209}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike depictions of mermaids in other mythologies, these are anatomically identical to land-bound humans, differing only in their ability to breathe and live underwater. They can (and do) interbreed with land humans, and the children of such unions have the ability to live underwater.  In the tale "[[Abdullah the Fisherman and Abdullah the Merman]]", the [[protagonist]] Abdullah the Fisherman gains the ability to breathe underwater and discovers an underwater society that is portrayed as an inverted reflection of society on land.  The underwater society follows a form of [[primitive communism]] where concepts like money and clothing do not exist. In "[[The Adventures of Bulukiya]]", the protagonist Bulukiya's quest for the [[Elixir of life|herb of immortality]] leads him to explore the seas, where he encounters societies of mermaids.&lt;ref name=Irwin /&gt;

Due to their vaguely anthropomorphic shape, dried [[skate (fish)|skates]] have long been described as mermaids.  Often their appearance is deliberately modified to make them look even more human.  In Europe, dried skates, sometimes called ''devil fish,'' (not to be confused with [[devil fish]] or devil rays, two species of ray native to the north Atlantic) were displayed as mermaids, angels, demons, or basilisks.  In Britain they are known as ''[[Jenny Haniver]]s'', perhaps in reference to Antwerp, where they were made by sailors.  Dried skates are also known in Mexico, where they are believed to have magical powers, and are used in healing rituals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eluniversalveracruz.com.mx/veracruzanos-personajes/2013/pez-del-diablo-mitologia-veracruzana-19598.html|title=FOTOS El diablo, un pez para la magia negra  - El Universal Veracruz|publisher=|accessdate=15 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mermaids appear in British folklore as unlucky omens, both foretelling disaster and provoking it.{{Sfn | Briggs | 1976 | p = 287}}  Several variants of the [[ballad]] ''[[Sir Patrick Spens]]'' depict a mermaid speaking to the doomed ships.  In some versions, she tells them they will never see land again; in others, she claims they are near shore, which they are wise enough to know means the same thing. Mermaids can also be a sign of approaching rough weather,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Francis James | last = Child | title = The English and Scottish Popular Ballads | volume = 2 | page = 19 | place = New York | publisher = Dover | year = 1965}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and some have been described as monstrous in size, up to {{convert|2000|ft|m}}.{{Sfn | Briggs | 1976 | p = 287}}

Mermaids have also been described as able to swim up [[river]]s to [[freshwater]] lakes. In one story, the [[Laird]] of Lorntie went to aid a woman he thought was drowning in a lake near his house; a servant of his pulled him back, warning that it was a mermaid, and the mermaid screamed at them that she would have killed him if it were not for his servant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = KM | last = Briggs | title = The Fairies in English Tradition and Literature | page = 57 | publisher = University of Chicago Press | place = London | year = 1967}}.&lt;/ref&gt; But mermaids could occasionally be more beneficent; e.g., teaching humans cures for certain diseases.{{Sfn | Briggs | 1976 | p = 288}}  [[Merman|Mermen]] have been described as wilder and uglier than mermaids, with little interest in humans.{{Sfn | Briggs | 1976 | p = 290}}

According to legend, a mermaid came to the [[Cornwall|Cornish]] village of [[Zennor]] where she used to listen to the singing of a chorister, Matthew Trewhella.  The two fell in love, and Matthew went with the mermaid to her home at [[Pendour Cove]].  On summer nights, the lovers can be heard singing together.  At the [[Church of Saint Senara, Zennor|Church of Saint Senara]] in Zennor, there is a famous chair decorated by a mermaid carving which is probably six hundred years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zennor.org/church.html |title=St. Senara's Church |publisher=Zennor Parish Council |accessdate=2012-06-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323133118/http://www.zennor.org/church.html |archivedate=2012-03-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some tales raised the question of whether mermaids had immortal souls, answering in the negative.{{Sfn | Briggs | 1976 | p = 289}}  The figure of [[Lí Ban (mermaid)|Lí Ban]] appears as a sanctified mermaid, but she was a human being transformed into a mermaid. After three centuries, when Christianity had come to Ireland, she was baptized.{{Sfn | Briggs | 1976 | pp = 266–7}} The Irish mermaid is called [[merrow]] in tales such as "Lady of Gollerus" published in the 19th century. In [[Scottish mythology]], a ''[[ceasg]]'' is a fresh-water mermaid, though little beside the term has been preserved in folklore.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Watson |first=E.

Mermaids from the [[Isle of Man]], known as ''ben-varrey'', are considered more favorable toward humans than those of other regions,&lt;ref name=Briggs&gt;Briggs, Katharine (1976). ''An Encyclopedia of Fairies''. Pantheon Books. pp. 22–23. "Ben-Varrey". {{ISBN|0-394-40918-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; with various accounts of assistance, gifts and rewards. One story tells of a fisherman who carried a stranded mermaid back into the sea and was rewarded with the location of treasure. Another recounts the tale of a baby mermaid who stole a doll from a human little girl, but was rebuked by her mother and sent back to the girl with a gift of a pearl necklace to atone for the theft. A third story tells of a fishing family that made regular gifts of apples to a mermaid and was rewarded with prosperity.&lt;ref name =Briggs /&gt;

The best-known example of mermaids in literature is probably Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale, ''[[The Little Mermaid]]'', first published in 1837.  In the original story, a young mermaid falls in love with a human prince whom she saves from drowning when his ship is wrecked in a storm.  Although her grandmother tells her not to envy humans, who live much shorter lives than mermaids, and whose only consolation is an immortal soul, the mermaid chooses to risk her life in order to be with the prince.  She trades her tongue and her beautiful voice to the sea-witch in exchange for a draught that will make her human and allow her to live on land.  She will have to rely on her beauty and charm to win the prince's love, as she will be entirely mute.

[[File:Rio mau sereia.jpg|thumb|left|Mermaid in a Romanesque capital of the [[Igreja de São Cristóvão de Rio Mau|Rio Mau Monastic church]] rebuilt in 1151.]]
The sea-witch warns the mermaid that, although she will be graceful, each step will feel as though she is stepping on knives; and that if she does not earn the prince's love, she will die of a broken heart after he weds another.  The spell is worked, and the mermaid is found by the prince, who sees the resemblance between her and the one who rescued him from drowning, although he does not realize that they are the same person.  Although the prince cares deeply for the mermaid, he is betrothed to the daughter of a neighboring king, and the mermaid cannot prevent their marriage.

The mermaid's sisters trade their beautiful hair to the sea-witch for a knife that the mermaid can use to break the spell and return to the sea.  She must kill the prince before dawn on the day after his wedding.  But the mermaid still loves the prince and cannot harm him.  She flings the knife into the sea and jumps in after it, then begins to dissolve into foam.  Then she is transformed into one of the daughters of the air, ethereal beings who strive to earn an immortal soul by doing good deeds in the world of men.&lt;ref name= "gilead2007"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://hca.gilead.org.il/li_merma.html | first = Hans Christian | last = Andersen | title=The Little Mermaid |publisher= Gilead | location = [[Israel|IL]] |date=2007-12-13 | accessdate = 2012-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They can be seen after dark, dancing together under the moon and calling out to young men by name, luring them to the water and drowning them.

In May 2012, a ''[[Mermaids: The Body Found]]'', a television [[docufiction]]&lt;ref name="Press Release"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mermaids: The Body Found (press release)|url=http://press.discovery.com/ekits/monster-week-mermaids/press-release.html|publisher=Animal Planet Media|accessdate=4 July 2012|quote=This two-hour special is science fiction based on some real events and scientific theory.}}&lt;/ref&gt; aired on [[Animal Planet]] which centered on the experiences of former [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] scientists, showing a [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] recreation of amateur sound and video of a beached mermaid and discussing scientific theories involving the existence of mermaids.&lt;ref name="Press Release" /&gt; In July 2012 in response to public inquiries, and the possibility that some viewers may have mistaken the programme for a documentary, the [[National Ocean Service]] (a branch of NOAA) made the unusual declaration that "no evidence of aquatic humanoids has ever been found".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=No evidence of aquatic humanoids has ever been found|url=http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/mermaids.html|publisher=National Ocean Service|accessdate=14 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=No evidence of mermaids, says US government|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-18692830|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=4 July 2012|date=3 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hoaxes ===
In the middle of the 17th century, [[John Tradescant the elder]] created a [[wunderkammer]] (called Tradescant's Ark) in which he displayed, among other things, a "mermaid's hand".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Yanni|first= Carla | title =Nature's Museums: Victorian Science and the Architecture of Display|year=2005|publisher= Princeton Architectural Press|location=New York|isbn=1-56898-472-3|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=nT3hJxTKoeEC&amp;pg=PA20 |edition=1st pbk. | page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[P. T. Barnum]]'s 19th century [[taxidermy|taxidermal]] hoax called the [[Fiji mermaid]] has been mentioned above. Others have perpetrated similar hoaxes, which are usually [[papier-mâché]] fabrications or parts of deceased creatures, usually monkeys and fish, stitched together for the appearance of a grotesque mermaid. In the wake of the [[2004 tsunami]], pictures of Fiji "mermaids" circulated on the Internet as supposed examples of items that had washed up amid the devastation, though they were no more real than Barnum's exhibit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.snopes.com/photos/tsunami/mermaid.asp | title = Urban Legends Reference Pages: Mermaid to Order |publisher=Snopes |accessdate= 2012-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Famous in more recent centuries is the [[fairy tale]] "The Little Mermaid" (1836) by [[Hans Christian Andersen]], whose works have been translated into over 100 languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical dictionary of literary influences: the nineteenth century, 1800–1914|year=2001|publisher=Greenwood Press | location =Westport, CT| isbn= 978-0-313-30422-4|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=3N3uj_wo-_kC&amp;pg=PA20| editor-first =John | editor-last = Powell |page= 20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mermaid (as conceived by Andersen) is similar to an [[Undine]], a water nymph in German folklore who could only obtain an immortal soul by marrying a human being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last= Brandes|first= George Morris Cohen|title= The Romantic School in Germany (1873) | year =1902|publisher=The Macmillan Co |location=New York|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=UUbZAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA301|page=301}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andersen's heroine inspired a bronze sculpture in [[Copenhagen]] harbour and influenced Western literary works such as Oscar Wilde's ''[[The Fisherman and His Soul]]'' and [[H.G. Wells]]' ''[[The Sea Lady]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wullschläger | first =Jackie|title= Hans Christian Andersen: the life of a storyteller|year= 2002|publisher= University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, IL |isbn=978-0-226-91747-4|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=SZ50_q-diBwC&amp;pg=PA176|edition= University of Chicago Press | page= 176}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sue Monk Kidd]] wrote a book called ''[[The Mermaid Chair]]'' loosely based on the legends of Saint Senara and the [[mermaid of Zennor]].

Sculptures and statues of mermaids can be found in many countries and cultures, with over 130 [[public art]] mermaid statues across the world.  Countries with public art mermaid sculptures include Russia, Finland, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Denmark, Norway, England, Scotland, Ireland, Germany, Netherlands, Belgium, France, Spain, Italy, Austria, Switzerland, Greece, Turkey, India, China, Thailand, South Korea, Japan, Guam, Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, Ecuador, Colombia, Mexico, Cayman Islands, Mexico, Saudi Arabia (Jeddah), the United States (including Hawaii and Virgin Islands) and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | type = map | title = Mermaids of Earth | url = http://www.mermaidsofearth.com/}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of these mermaid statues have become icons of their city or country, and have become major tourist attractions in themselves. ''[[The Little Mermaid (statue)|The Little Mermaid]]'' statue in Copenhagen is an icon of that city as well as of Denmark. The [[Havis Amanda]] statue symbolizes the rebirth of the city of Helsinki, capital of Finland.  The Syrenka (mermaid) is part of the [[Coat of Arms of Warsaw]], and is considered a protector of Warsaw, capital of Poland, which publicly displays statues of their mermaid.

Musical depictions of mermaids include those by [[Felix Mendelssohn]] in his ''Fair Melusina'' overture and the three "Rhine daughters" in [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]''.  [[Lorelei]], the name of a Rhine mermaid immortalized in the [[Heinrich Heine]] poem of that name, has become a synonym for a siren.  ''The Weeping Mermaid'' is an orchestral piece by Taiwanese composer [[Fan-Long Ko]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.wretch.cc/blog/phesha0822/13941275 | first =Felicity Fei-Hsien | last = Chiu |title=Taiwan New Sound Concert–Requiem for the 228 Incident |publisher=Wretch |date=2010-07-16 |accessdate= 2012-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An influential image was created by [[John William Waterhouse]], from 1895 to 1905, entitled ''A Mermaid''. An example of late British Academy style artwork, the piece debuted to considerable acclaim (and secured Waterhouse's place as a member of the [[Royal Academy]]), but disappeared into a private collection and did not resurface until the 1970s. It is currently once again in the Royal Academy's collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author-link = Elizabeth Prettejohn | last = Prettejohn | first = Elizabeth | display-authors = etal | year = 2008 | title = J. W. Waterhouse: The Modern Pre-Raphaelite | page = 144 | publisher = Thames &amp; Hudson | place = London | isbn = 978-90-8586-490-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Mermaids were a favorite subject of [[John Reinhard Weguelin]], a contemporary of Waterhouse.  He painted an image of the mermaid of Zennor as well as several other depictions of mermaids in watercolour.

Film depictions include the romantic comedy ''[[Splash (film)|Splash]]'' ([[1984 in film|1984]]) and ''[[Aquamarine (film)|Aquamarine]]'' ([[2006 in film|2006]]). A 1963 episode of the television series ''[[Route 66 (TV series)|Route 66]]'' entitled "The Cruelest Sea" featured a mermaid performance artist working at [[Weeki Wachee]] aquatic park.  Mermaids also appeared in the popular supernatural drama television series ''[[Charmed]]'', and were the basis of its [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] series ''[[Charmed#Mermaid|Mermaid]]''. In ''[[She Creature]]'' (2001), two carnival workers abduct a mermaid in Ireland c. 1900 and attempt to transport her to America. The film ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides]]'' mixes old and new myths about mermaids: singing to sailors to lure them to their death, growing legs when taken onto dry land, and bestowing kisses with magical healing properties. Animated films include [[Disney]]'s musical version of Andersen's tale, ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'', and [[Hayao Miyazaki]]'s ''[[Ponyo]]''. The Australian teen [[dramedy]] ''[[H2O: Just Add Water]]'' chronicles the adventures of three modern-day mermaids along the Gold Coast of Australia.

=== Heraldry ===
[[File:POL Warszawa COA 1.svg|thumb|upright|Coat of arms of [[Warsaw]]]] [[File:Cusack Crest.jpg|thumbnail|right|Cusack Crest]]

In [[heraldry]], the charge of a mermaid is commonly represented with a comb and a mirror,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Fourteenth Century England | volume = 2|year= 2002| publisher= The Boydell Press| location= Woodbridge, UK | isbn = 0-85115-891-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7-qRZK9YXDgC&amp;pg=PA121| editor-first =Chris | editor-last = Given-Wilson|page=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[blazon]]ed as a "mermaid in her vanity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history.westkingdom.org/RoyaltyArms/WestPart5.htm |title=The History of the Kingdom of The West: Royalty |publisher=West kingdom |accessdate=2012-07-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130225112758/http://history.westkingdom.org/RoyaltyArms/WestPart5.htm |archivedate=2013-02-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to vanity, mermaids are also a symbol of eloquence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sloan Evans|first=William | title = A Grammar of British Heraldry|year= 1854|location= London|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=uSINAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA145| page = 145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A shield and sword-wielding mermaid (''Syrenka'') is on the official [[coat of arms of Warsaw]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ucl.ac.uk/atlas/polish/mywarsaw/warsaw10.html | publisher = UCL | location = UK | title = The Mermaid | accessdate = 2008-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Images of a mermaid have symbolized Warsaw on its arms since the middle of the 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.um.warszawa.pl/v_syrenka/perelki/index_en.php?mi_id=47&amp;dz_id=2 | title = Warsaw Mermaid's Statue | accessdate = 2008-07-10 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081207092210/http://www.um.warszawa.pl/v_syrenka/perelki/index_en.php?mi_id=47&amp;dz_id=2 | archivedate = 2008-12-07 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several legends associate [[Triton (mythology)|Triton]] of Greek mythology with the city, which may have been the origin of the mermaid's association.&lt;ref name="legend"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.e-warsaw.pl/miasto/herb-1.htm | title = History of Warsaw's Coat of Arms |work = e-Warsaw | access-date = 2008-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Cusack]] family crest includes a mermaid wielding a sword, as depicted on a memorial stone for Sir [[Thomas Cusack (Irish judge)|Thomas Cusack]] (1490–1571).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last = Hickey | first = Elizabeth | authorlink = Elizabeth Hickey | title = Monument to Sir Thomas Cusack | journal = Records of Meath Archaeological &amp; Historical Society | year = 1971 | volume = IV | issue = 5 | pages = 76, 84 | publisher = Meath Archaeological &amp; Historical Society | location = Meath, Ireland |ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Fairbairn's book of Crests 1859 (ref cf 184.7)&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of [[Norfolk, Virginia]], also uses a mermaid as a symbol. The personal coat of arms of [[Michaëlle Jean]], a former [[Governor General of Canada]], features two mermaids as supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gg.ca/heraldry/pub-reg/project-pic.asp?lang=e&amp;ProjectID=929&amp;ProjectElementID=3456 |work=Canadian Heraldic Authority |title=The Public Register of Arms, Flags, and Badges of Canada |first=Michaëlle |last=Jean |publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada |date=20 September 2005 |accessdate=23 September 2008 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mermaid fandom ==
Interest in mermaid costuming has grown alongside the popularity of fantasy [[cosplay]] as well as the availability of inexpensive monofins used in the construction of mermaid costumes. These costumes are typically designed to be used while swimming, in an activity known as [[mermaiding]]. Mermaid fandom conventions have also been held.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2011/aug/14/photos-mermaid-convention-and-awards-silverton-cas/ |title=Photos: Mermaid convention breaks record(s), returns to L.V. next year |first1=Don |last1=Chareuncy |first2=Robin |last2=Leach |authorlink2=Robin Leach |date=August 14, 2011 |newspaper=Las Vegas Sun |accessdate=October 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/travel/os-merpalooza-convention-pictures-20120811,0,6329605.photogallery |newspaper=Orlando Sentinel |title=Photos: Mer-Palooza Mermaid Convention in Orlando |last=Cruey |first=Joshua C. |date=August 11, 2012 |accessdate=October 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Human divers ==
The [[Ama (diver)|Ama]] are Japanese skin divers, predominantly women, who traditionally dive for shellfish and seaweed wearing only a loincloth and who have been in action for at least 2,000 years. Starting in the twentieth century, they have increasingly been regarded as a tourist attraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Physiology of Breath-Hold Diving and the Ama of Japan|date=1 September 1965|volume= Publication 1341 | accessdate = 26 July 2012|editor1-first=Herrman|editor1-last= Rahn|pages= 25, 41|publisher= US National Research Council | url = http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/xmlui/handle/123456789/3279}}&lt;/ref&gt; They operate off reefs near the shore, and some perform for sightseers instead of diving to collect a harvest. They have been romanticized as mermaids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Stott|first= Rebecca|title= Oyster|year= 2004 | publisher = Reaktion Books|location=London|isbn=978-1-86189-221-8|page=194|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=3qx2ELi_roMC&amp;lpg=PA194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional female divers have performed as mermaids at Florida's [[Weeki Wachee Springs]] since 1947. The state park calls itself "The Only City of Live Mermaids"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Connolly | first = Kevin P. | url = http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2012-07-05/news/os-florida-mermaids-weeki-wachee-20120705_1_mermaids-website-atmospheric-administration |title=Florida mermaids not real: Weeki Wachee mermaids, other 'aquatic humanoids' are unreal, feds say |publisher=Orlando Sentinel |date=2012-07-05 |accessdate = 2012-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was extremely popular in the 1960s, drawing almost one million tourists per year.&lt;ref name = "wired1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Schiller |first= Jakob |url = https://www.wired.com/rawfile/2012/04/professional-mermaids-are-lost-treasure-of-florida-park/ |title=Professional Mermaids Are Lost Treasure of Florida Park | publisher = Wired |date=2012-04-20 |accessdate=2012-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the current performers work part-time while attending college, and all are certified [[Scuba diving|Scuba]] divers.  They wear fabric tails and perform aquatic ballet (while holding their breath) for an audience in an underwater stage with glass walls. Children often ask if the "mermaids" are real. The park's PR director says "Just like with [[Santa Claus]] or any other mythical character, we always say yes.  We're not going to tell them they're not real".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Abbey |first=Melissa |url=http://articles.cnn.com/2012-07-05/us/us_mermaids-noaa_1_weeki-wachee-springs-noaa-atmospheric-administration?_s=PM:US |title=Mermaids don't exist... or do they? |publisher=CNN |date=2012-07-05 |accessdate=2012-07-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120725164446/http://articles.cnn.com/2012-07-05/us/us_mermaids-noaa_1_weeki-wachee-springs-noaa-atmospheric-administration?_s=PM%3AUS |archivedate=2012-07-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Mirror's Edge Catalyst''''' is a [[First person (video games)|first-person]] [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] [[Platform game|platformer]] video game developed by [[EA DICE]] and published by [[Electronic Arts]]. The game was released for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]] in June 2016. Its plot focuses on protagonist [[Faith Connors]]' origins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Khan|first=Zarmena|date=August 8, 2015|url=http://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2015/08/08/mirrors-edge-catalyst-is-a-reboot/|title=DICE Confirms Mirror’s Edge Catalyst Is a Reboot, Tells the Story of Faith’s Origin|accessdate=October 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Mirror's Edge Catalyst'' received mixed to positive reviews from critics upon release, with most reviewers praising the free-running gameplay and visuals, but criticizing the story and combat.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Mirror's Edge Catalyst gameplay screenshot.png|thumb|left|256px|[[Software release life cycle#Pre-alpha|Pre-alpha]] gameplay screenshot of ''Mirror's Edge Catalyst''. Like the original game, Faith is able to traverse environments using various environmental objects, such as the walkway rail pictured here.]]

''Mirror's Edge Catalyst'' is a [[First person (video games)|first-person]] [[action-adventure game]] in which the player takes control of [[Faith Connors]] as she progresses through a futuristic city named Glass. Similar to the original ''Mirror's Edge'', players traverse the city using aspects of [[urban exploration]] and [[parkour]] movements to complete missions and evade or fight enemies. Players can also make use of environmental objects such as [[zip-line]]s and ledges, and equipment; this includes a MAG (Manifold Attachment Gear) Rope and a Disruptor&lt;ref name="Focus"/&gt; to travel across buildings, disable certain systems (such as large fans or security cameras) and aid Faith during combat. When players mark an objective on their map, Faith's "runner vision" is activated and some scenery items automatically highlight in red. These act as guides to lead players towards their objective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shacknews.com/article/90122/e3-2015-mirrors-edge-catalyst-is-the-faith-connors-that-fans-deserve|title=E3 2015: Mirror's Edge Catalyst is the Faith Connors that Fans Deserve|first=Josh|last=Hawkins|work=[[Shacknews]]|date=June 16, 2015|accessdate=June 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of levels and linear gameplay found in the first ''Mirror's Edge'' has been replaced with an open world, free-roaming environment. This gives players more freedom in traversal, allowing for the use of multiple paths to reach one's objective.&lt;ref name="PolyGameplay2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2015/6/17/8795003/mirrors-edge-catalyst-open-world-game-ps4-playstion-4-xbox-one|title=Mirror's Edge Catalyst Works Wonderfully As An Open-World Game|first=Philip|last=Kollar|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=June 16, 2015|accessdate=June 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the campaign's mission, side activities such as time trials, races and environmental puzzles are featured. Additionally, items called GridLeaks can be found across the world that can be collected by players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.videogamer.com/ps4/mirrors_edge_working_title/preview-3892.html|title=E3 2015: Mirror's Edge Catalyst marks the faithful return of a classic - but the E3 demo disappoints|first=David|last=Scammell|work=VideoGamer.com|date=June 16, 2015|accessdate=June 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Combat mechanics of the game received an overhaul and a new combat system was developed as traversal is greatly emphasized in the game.&lt;ref name="PolyGameplay2"/&gt; Also, though only used sparingly in the previous game, ''Mirror's Edge Catalyst'' has removed the use of guns by the player altogether, focusing on Faith's running and parkour movements and quick melee-style attacks to take down or evade her enemies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-06-16-mirrors-edge-catalyst-wont-let-you-use-guns-ever|title=Mirror's Edge Catalyst won't let you use guns, ever|first=Jeffery|last=Matulef|work=[[Eurogamer]]|date=June 17, 2015|accessdate=June 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Faith enters focus mode while she is running.

''Mirror's Edge Catalyst'' contains several multiplayer features, which DICE calls Social Play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mirror’s Edge Catalyst Dev Diary – Social Play|url=http://www.mirrorsedge.com/news/dev-diary-social-play|website=Mirror's Edge|publisher=Electronic Arts|accessdate=April 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there are no live [[co-operative gameplay|co-operative multiplayer]] or side-by-side competitive modes, the game features asynchronous multiplayer in which a player's actions in the game can affect the world for other players' games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/17/e3-2015-mirrors-edge-catalysts-campaign-has-multiplayer-features|title=E3 2015: Mirror's Edge Catalyst's Campaign Has Multiplayer Features|first=Mitch|last=Dyer|work=[[IGN]]|date=June 17, 2015|accessdate=June 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among these are Time Trials which, unlike in the 2008 game, are not pre-defined by DICE. Instead, these checkpoint-to-checkpoint paths are set by any player whereby others can race against them at their leisure for faster times. Players are also able to place Beat Location Emitters for other players to track down, an exploration activity similar to [[geocaching]].

==Synopsis==

===Setting===

The game takes place in the dystopian, futuristic city of Glass, the showcase city of the nation of Cascadia, governed by a [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] [[corporatocracy]]. Cascadian society is highly [[social stratification|stratified]], and the majority of citizens work for the corporations and are connected to the Grid, a massive social monitoring network digitally connecting everything and everyone in cities like Glass. The corporations are secretly preparing to launch a project, called Reflection, to control the populace through the Grid.

So-called Runners, freelance messengers skilled at [[free running]], refuse to be connected to the Grid and live on rooftops, making their living from covert delivery jobs while evading corporate security. The game centers around a Runner named Faith, and her efforts to help other Runners overthrow the corporate government and stop Reflection.

===Plot===
{{Plot|section|date=May 2018}}
Faith Connors is released from prison and meets up with fellow runner Icarus, as well as Runner cabal leader Noah, who raised Faith after the death of her parents. During a data grab inside the headquarters of Elysium, Faith diverges from her orders and also retrieves a valuable hard drive, but is seen by Gabriel Kruger, CEO of Kruger Security. She manages to escape, intending to use the drive's contents to pay off her debt to Dogen, a black market boss. Noah is angry at Faith for involving herself with Kruger, but tells her that she needs to know what is inside the drive in order to bargain with it. Faith takes the drive to Plastic, a talented hacker, who tells her the drive contains blueprints for a top-secret project known as "Reflection".
 
Meanwhile, K-Sec cracks down hard on the Runners because of Faith's actions at Elysium. While Icarus and Faith are away, they lead a raid on the Runners' lair and capture or kill everyone present. Faith and Icarus, believing Noah to be dead upon returning and having nowhere to go, turn to Rebecca Thane, leader of Black November, a militant resistance movement bent on destroying the Conglomerate by force. Black November rebels, assisted by the Runner duo, sets up an ambush to capture a high-ranking K-Sec commander, whom they intend to trade for their own captured soldiers. The mission is a success and it turns out that the captured officer is Isabel Kruger, daughter and personal bodyguard of Gabriel Kruger.
 
Faith asks Plastic to infiltrate K-Sec servers and gather information about Isabel, who turns out to be Caitlyn "Cat" Connors, Faith's own sister, who was assumed dead during the November riots. Gabriel Kruger took her in as his adoptive daughter, telling her that Faith, along with the rest of her family, was killed. Armed with this realization, Faith races back to the subterranean Black November HQ, where Thane is preparing to execute Isabel/Cat in order to send Kruger a message. Faith defends Isabel, who does not seem to remember who Faith is, and begs Thane to take Isabel above ground because the air underground has been suffocating her. Thane agrees after Faith promises her the hard drive that she stole from Kruger.
 
Isabel lets on to Faith that Noah might still be alive, held in a compound called Kingdom. Icarus asks to come along to save Noah, but Faith insists that he stays to look after Isabel for her because she does not trust Thane. Upon reaching Kingdom, Faith rescues a group of Reflection scientists who were detained by K-Sec for "asking too many questions." The lead scientist, Aline Maera, explains that Reflection involves injecting the population with nanites that can be remote-controlled through a broadcast signal as a way to regulate thoughts and emotions, thereby making people "become the Grid" and allowing corporations absolute control over citizens. Aline also mentions that Faith's own mother Erika invented an algorithm that would later allow Reflection to be realized.

Through cutscenes interspersed between the campaign missions, it is revealed that Gabriel Kruger led a K-Sec task force sent to neutralize the Connors after they realized the grave implications of Reflection and wanted out. Kruger killed the Connors, then tried to capture Faith and Cat who were hiding nearby. As the girls were escaping, a gas grenade was tossed, causing Cat to choke and lose consciousness. Faith was forced to abandon her.

Faith finds Noah, who is being experimented on with prototype Reflection nanites, but is too late to prevent his death. Meanwhile, back at Black November HQ, the rebels are ambushed by K-Sec while bringing Isabel up. Icarus and the rebels are injected with Reflection nanites.
 
The Runners and their allies regroup at Plastic's hideout, which is shielded from Reflection broadcast signals. Plastic and Aline work together to engineer a virus to disable Reflection once and for all. In order to do this, Faith needs to secure Gabriel Kruger's own gridPrint, which she successfully does by breaking into his private apartment. From there, she witnesses a massive explosion at The Shard, the tallest building in all of Glass (presumably courtesy of Black November). Faith still needs to go on top of The Shard, which contains the broadcast antenna and is now unstable, to activate the virus. She is confronted by Kruger at the top of the building, who attempts to stop her. He defends his decision to launch Reflection by saying the nanites are a cure designed to keep Isabel's chronic lung condition at bay, and that the project is about survival rather than control.
 
Faith subdues Kruger and his bodyguards, just as she sees Isabel at the door, who attempts to stop the virus but is too late; it finishes wiping Reflection out, thus making Isabel's lung condition return. She then runs away to the helipad, with Faith giving chase. They fight, as Isabel accuses Faith of abandoning her behind to die in the vent after not being able to wake her up (which probably contributed to Isabel's lung condition), while Faith attempts to remind Isabel of who she really is. Gabriel Kruger appears on a helicopter and begs Isabel to come with him, but she hesitates after Faith tells her that she saw Kruger kill their biological parents. Running out of patience, he orders his guards to shoot Faith, but Isabel protects her. The Shard starts to crumble, sending Kruger's helicopter tumbling away; Kruger falls out and Faith slides towards the edge of the helipad.
 
Barely hanging on, Faith almost falls to her death until Isabel catches her at the last moment. Kruger is heard calling out for his "daughter" to save him. Faith pleads with Isabel not to do so, to no avail, as Isabel explains that she "has to" and runs off in Kruger's direction. However, as the helicopter rises again and flies away, only Isabel is standing in it, with Kruger nowhere to be seen.
 
In the aftermath, it is reported on the news that Isabel will now supersede her "missing" father as Kruger Security CEO. While there was no uprising in the population, Faith has successfully disabled the Reflection launch, thus keeping people safe from Conglomerate control.

==Development==
The new ''Mirror's Edge'' game was officially revealed in June 2013 at the Electronic Arts press event at [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2013]]. It was released for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]], and [[Xbox One]] in North America on June 7, 2016, and in Europe on June 9.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://kotaku.com/you-re-not-dreaming-a-new-mirror-s-edge-game-actually-512393846 |title= You’re Not Dreaming: A New Mirror’s Edge Game Actually Exists |date= June 10, 2013 |accessdate= June 11, 2013 |publisher= Kotaku}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was announced soon after as a prequel to ''Mirror's Edge'' showcasing the origins of Faith,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.oxm.co.uk/55888/mirrors-edge-2-announced-an-origin-story-for-xbox-one/ |title= News: Mirror's Edge 2 announced – an origin story for Xbox One – Xbox 360 – The Official Magazine |date= June 10, 2013 |accessdate= June 11, 2013 |first= Edwin |last= Evans-Thirlwell |publisher= Official Xbox Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; and uses the [[Frostbite (game engine)|Frostbite]] engine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2013/06/10/mirrors-edge-2// |title=EA announces Mirror's Edge 'reboot' for next-gen consoles (video)|publisher=[[Engadget]] |date=June 10, 2013 |accessdate=June 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; instead of the [[Unreal Engine]] used in the [[Mirror's Edge|first game]]. However, at a later date Sara Jansson stated that the game was not been seen as either a reboot or a prequel.&lt;ref name="PolyGameplay2"/&gt; Electronic Arts also confirmed in 2013 that the game would be an "open-world action adventure".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/e3/new-mirrors-edge-is-open-world-6409990/ |title=New Mirror's Edge is open-world |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |date=June 12, 2013 |accessdate=June 12, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130615230555/http://www.gamespot.com/e3/new-mirrors-edge-is-open-world-6409990 |archivedate=June 15, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to DICE's general manager Karl Magnus Troedsson, the game focuses on the first-person combat mechanics building upon the first-person movement mechanics that were present in the first game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.computerandvideogames.com/469163/interviews/interview-dice-on-dividing-battlefield-and-conquering-star-wars/ | title = Interview: DICE on Dividing Battlefield and Conquering Star Wars | last = Robinson | first = Andy | date = June 23, 2014 | accessdate = June 23, 2014 | publisher = [[Computer and Video Games]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140625112656/http://www.computerandvideogames.com/469163/interviews/interview-dice-on-dividing-battlefield-and-conquering-star-wars/ | archive-date = June 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the game features a free-roaming environment, the runner vision from the first game had been completely redesigned to adapt this structure. The runner vision in ''Catalyst'' can recalculate the path for players towards their objectives or waypoints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/mirror-edge-catalysts-open-world-meant-redesigning-runner-vision/|title=Mirror's Edge Catalyst’s open-world meant redesigning Runner Vision|first=Dom |last=Reseigh-Lincoln|work=Edge|publisher=[[GamesRadar]]|date=August 25, 2015|accessdate=August 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game was featured at [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]] for a second time in June 2014, and prototype gameplay was briefly shown. ''Mirror's Edge Catalyst'' has more varied gameplay for Faith and Runners, where they serve a greater purpose than in the first game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cheatcc.com/articles/394127|title=Prototype Footage of Mirror's Edge 2 Revealed|last=Mackintosh|first=Kieran|work=Cheat Code Central|date=June 9, 2014|accessdate=February 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2014, writer [[Rhianna Pratchett]] announced on Twitter that she would not be involved with the new game and neither would most of the original team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/01/08/mirrors-edge-writer-isnt-working-on-reboot|title=Mirror's Edge writer isn't working on reboot|last=O'Brien|first=Lucy|work=[[IGN]]|date=January 7, 2014|accessdate=January 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Mirror's Edge'' was confirmed to have a planned release date of February 23, 2016 before it was delayed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=McWhertor |first=Michael |date=May 5, 2015 |url=https://www.polygon.com/2015/5/5/8556395/mirrors-edge-2-release-date |title=Mirror's Edge 2 is coming in early 2016 |publisher=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |accessdate=May 6, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150506214643/http://www.polygon.com/2015/5/5/8556395/mirrors-edge-2-release-date |archivedate=May 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The title ''Mirror's Edge Catalyst'' was formally announced in June 2015 prior to [[E3 2015]]; DICE product manager Sara Jansson affirmed that the game is not a sequel but would delve into more of Faith's past while expanding on the original game's first-person perspective experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/09/mirrors-edge-catalyst-subtitle-is-official | title = Mirror’s Edge: Catalyst Subtitle Is Official | first = Mitch | last = Dyer | date = June 9, 2015 | accessdate = June 9, 2015 | publisher = [[IGN]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 15, at E3, and later on the ''Mirror's Edge'' [[YouTube]] channel, DICE released a new trailer for ''Mirror's Edge Catalyst'', revealing elements of the game's storyline and environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsDX_LiJT7E | title = Official Mirror’s Edge Catalyst Announcement Trailer | date = June 15, 2015 | accessdate = June 16, 2015 | publisher = [[Electronic Arts]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was confirmed that the game would feature an open-world design and Faith would no longer be able to use guns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fekete|first=Bob|date=June 16, 2015|url=http://www.idigitaltimes.com/mirrors-edge-catalyst-will-be-open-world-will-not-feature-gun-combat-450981|title=Mirror's Edge Catalyst Will Be Open World, Will Not Feature Gun Combat|work=iDigitalTimes|accessdate=June 17, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150617102317/http://www.idigitaltimes.com/mirrors-edge-catalyst-will-be-open-world-will-not-feature-gun-combat-450981|archivedate=June 17, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game was the second best-selling retail game in the UK in its first week of release, only behind ''[[Overwatch (video game)|Overwatch]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcvuk.com/news/read/overwatch-holds-no-1-for-third-week-mirror-s-edge-catalyst-debuts-in-second-place/0168399|title=Overwatch holds No.1 for third week, Mirror's Edge Catalyst debuts in second place|first=Alex|last=Calvin|work=MCVUK|date=June 13, 2016|accessdate=June 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its second week of release, the game became the sixth best-selling retail game of the week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2016/06/20/uncharted-4-and-doom-top-uk-charts-as-mirrors-edge-catalyst-plummets-5955285/|title=Uncharted 4 and Doom top UK charts, as Mirror’s Edge Catalyst plummets|work=[[Metro (magazine)|Metro]]|date=June 20, 2016|accessdate=July 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on EA's comments and financial releases, sales analyst Michael Pachter estimated that the game sold between 1.7 and 2 million copies by the start of August.&lt;Ref&gt;[https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/16/08/8294977/michael-pachter-on-electronic-arts-earnings-mirrors-edge "Michael Pachter On Electronic Arts Earnings, 'Mirror's Edge' And Poor Guidance."]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Review aggregator|review aggregation]] website [[Metacritic]], ''Mirror's Edge Catalyst'' received "mixed or average" reviews from critics. Chris Carter from ''[[Destructoid]]'' gave the game a positive review, commending the focus on open world gameplay, saying that the game "nails" exploration and parkour movement. He felt that because the gameplay was fun overall, players could spend an endless amount of time roaming the game world. Carter also called the overall visuals "beautiful" and felt that the design of the environments help create a world that is full of life. Carter disliked the story, however, for being predictable and featuring unlikeable supporting characters but said it was forgivable because players are able to ignore it and focus on the gameplay aspects.&lt;ref name="Destructoid review"/&gt;

While citing the movement system as a positive and the combat mechanics as a negative, Spencer Campbell concluded his review for ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' with: "''Mirror's Edge Catalyst'' has a strong core built by its movement system, but when it comes time to do anything else than run from point A to point B, you'll probably be more inclined to run away."&lt;ref name="EGM review"/&gt;

''[[Game Informer]]''{{'}}s Ben Reeves summarized his review with: "The original ''Mirror's Edge'' is an overlooked gem from last generation, but even diehard fans will have trouble finding the diamonds in this rough." Reeves disliked the design of the game's environments, calling them "barren" and "lifeless", criticized the melee combat for feeling like a chore, stated that the soundtrack lacked defining characteristics, called the main story "rushed", and felt that the side-content was "boring".&lt;ref name="Game Informer review"/&gt;

[[Game Revolution]]'s Peter Paras called the game's environments "gorgeous" and "unique", commended the large amount of content, and praised the visuals of the cutscenes. Paras thought that the gameplay was "unintuitive" and "clunky", however, and hated the story and characters. Paras also experienced some technical issues, thought that character animations were "poor", and said that the design of the menus was "strange".&lt;ref name="Game Revolution review"/&gt;

Scott Butterworth of [[GameSpot]] gave particular praise to the movement mechanics, saying that they consistently wowed him throughout the entire game and made up for the various shortcomings he experienced. Butterworth also liked the varied mix of side-content and called the open world exploration "rewarding". Butterworth's main criticisms were concerning the "mediocre" story and the "clunky" combat.&lt;ref name="GameSpot review"/&gt;

[[GamesRadar]]'s Leon Hurley stated: "''Mirror's Edge Catalyst'' is an interesting game with some strong ideas but not enough variety." Hurley praised the visuals but called the combat "terrible".&lt;ref name="GamesRadar review"/&gt; Ryan McCaffrey for [[IGN]] summarized his review with: "''Mirror's Edge''{{'}}s return shines in some regards, but is ultimately a disappointment." McCaffrey complimented the user-generated content and parkour gameplay but criticized the story and characters, as well as the "uneven" combat and inconsistent visuals.&lt;ref name="IGN review"/&gt;

Arthur Gies of ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' wrote: "I imagine most players will happily bounce from side mission to delivery to grid node and back again, content to do what ''Mirror's Edge'' has always been best at: constantly moving forward and up. And once you can focus on that, ''Mirror's Edge Catalyst'' is a flawed, but often great breath of something different and exciting in an open-world landscape full of the same old thing."&lt;ref name="Polygon review"/&gt;

The '''Museum Of Bad Art''' ('''MOBA''') is a privately owned museum whose stated aim is "to celebrate the labor of artists whose work would be displayed and appreciated in no other forum".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Frank|Sacco|2008|p=vii}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally in [[Dedham, Massachusetts|Dedham]] with current branches in [[Somerville, Massachusetts|Somerville]], [[Brookline, Massachusetts|Brookline]], and [[Weymouth, Massachusetts|South Weymouth]] in [[Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name=Lowbrow&gt;{{cite news |author=Piepenburg, Erik |title=Loving the Lowbrow (It Has Its Own Hall of Fame) |agency= |work=[[The New York Times]] |pages= |page= |date=September 22, 2010|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/03/arts/design/03badart.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its permanent collection includes over 700&amp;nbsp;pieces of "art too bad to be ignored", 25 to 35 of which are on public display at any one time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Walkup, Nancy |title=ArtEd Online&amp;nbsp;— [[National Art Education Association|NAEA]] in Boston&amp;nbsp;— Reproducible Handout |journal=School Arts |volume=104 |issue=7 |pages=36 |date=March 2005 |issn=0036-6463 |oclc=1765119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MOBA was founded in 1994, after antique dealer Scott Wilson showed a painting he had recovered from the trash to some friends, who suggested starting a collection. Within a year, receptions held in Wilson's friends' home were so well-attended that the collection needed its own viewing space. The museum then moved to the basement of a theater in Dedham. Explaining the reasoning behind the museum's establishment, co-founder Jerry Reilly said in 1995: "While every city in the world has at least one museum dedicated to the best of art, MOBA is the only museum dedicated to collecting and exhibiting the worst."&lt;ref name=Mutch&gt;{{cite news |author=Mutch, David |title=Art from the Bottom of the Heap: A 'Museum' Devoted to Bad Painting |agency= |work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]] |pages= |page=13 |date=November 2, 1995 |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/1995/1102/02131.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To be included in MOBA's collection, works must be original and have serious intent, but they must also have significant flaws without being boring; curators are not interested in displaying deliberate [[kitsch]].

MOBA has been mentioned in dozens of off-the-beaten-path guides to [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], featured in international newspapers and magazines, and has inspired several other collections throughout the world that set out to rival its own visual atrocities. [[Deborah Solomon]] of ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' noted that the attention the Museum Of Bad Art receives is part of a wider trend of museums displaying "the best bad art".&lt;ref name="solomon"&gt;Solomon, Deborah. "[https://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/24/magazine/in-praise-of-bad-art.html In Praise of Bad Art]". ''[[The New York Times]]'', January 24, 1999 &lt;!--Retrieved on March 2, 2009--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The museum has been criticized for being anti-art, but the founders deny this, responding that its collection is a tribute to the sincerity of the artists who persevered with their art despite something going horribly wrong in the process. According to co-founder Marie Jackson, "We are here to celebrate an artist's right to fail, gloriously."&lt;ref name="irishtimes"&gt;"[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/features/1999/0918/99091800051.html The Gallery of the Garish Masterpieces of Bad Art]". ''[[The Irish Times]]'', September 18, 1999. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The Museum Of Bad Art was established in 1994 by antique dealer Scott Wilson, who discovered what has become the museum's signature piece—''Lucy in the Field with Flowers''—protruding from between two trash cans on a [[Roslindale, Massachusetts|Roslindale]]-area curb in Boston, among some garbage waiting to be collected. Wilson was initially interested only in the frame, but when he showed the picture to his friend Jerry Reilly, Reilly wanted both the frame and the painting. He exhibited ''Lucy'' in his home, and encouraged friends to look for other bad art and notify Wilson of what they found.&lt;ref name="gaines"&gt;Gaines, Judith. [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-7775472.html "Exhibiting Works of Trial and Error: Museum Finds Landscapes Gone Awry"]. ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', May 4, 2003. 9&lt;/ref&gt; When Wilson acquired another "equally lovely" piece and shared it with Reilly, they decided to start a collection. Reilly and his wife, Marie Jackson, held a party in their basement to exhibit the collection to date, and hosted a reception they facetiously titled "The Opening of the Museum Of Bad Art".&lt;ref name="english07"&gt;English, Bella. [http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2007/04/29/high_standards_for_low_art/?rss_id=Boston%20Globe%20--%20Globe%20South "High Standards for Low Art"]. ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', April 29, 2007. Reg7&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:MOBA-MensroomEntrance.JPG|thumb|''2:14'' by Kafka Liz (2009). The original stairwell entrance to the Museum of Bad Art and the men's restroom]]
Regular showings of the pieces collected by Wilson, Reilly, and Jackson (and those donated by others), became too much for Reilly and Jackson's small home in [[West Roxbury, Massachusetts]], as hundreds of people attended the receptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Frauenfelder, Mark |title=Canvas Catastrophes |date=July 1995 |work= |publisher=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired Magazine]] |url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/3.07/scans.html?pg=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The founders' initial attempt at dealing with their constrained exhibition space was to create the Virtual Museum Of Bad Art, a CD-ROM with a cast of 95 people that presented the MOBA art collection in a fictional imaginary museum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cool.conservation-us.org/waac/wn/wn18/wn18-1/wn18-113.html MOBS CD-ROM]&lt;/ref&gt;  This fictional MOBA allowed the visitors not only to view the paintings but to go behind the scenes in the fictional museum.

Word of the museum's collection continued to spread until, according to "Permanent Interim Acting Director" Louise Reilly Sacco, "it got completely out of hand" when a group of senior citizens on a tour bus stopped to see it.&lt;ref name="gaines"/&gt; In 1995 the display space was moved to the basement of the Dedham Community Theatre, a building with an aesthetic described in 2004 as "ramshackle".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Citro|Foulds|2004|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum in Dedham had no fixed operating hours, instead being open while the theater upstairs was open.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foodandwine.com/thingtodo/museum/museum-of-bad-art Museum of Bad Art] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130102163708/http://www.foodandwine.com/thingtodo/museum/museum-of-bad-art |date=2013-01-02 }}". ''[[Food &amp; Wine Magazine]]'', October 2008 &lt;!--Retrieved on March 3, 2009--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; As ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' notes, the art collection was appropriately placed "just outside the men's room",&lt;ref name="english"&gt;English, Bella. "[http://www.boston.com/yourtown/newton/articles/2009/02/08/doing_a_good_deed_with_bad_art/ Doing a Good Deed with Bad Art]". ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', February 8, 2009. Reg1&lt;/ref&gt; where sounds and smells carry to the collection and the constant flushing of the toilet "supposedly helps maintain a uniform humidity", according to the ''[[South China Morning Post]]''.&lt;ref name="wilson"&gt;Wilson, David, "It May Be Art, But They Sure Ain't No Oil Paintings". ''[[South China Morning Post]]'', May 17, 2004. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

In MOBA's early days, the museum hosted traveling shows; on one occasion the works were hung from trees in the woods on [[Cape Cod]] for the "Art Goes Out the Window—The Gallery in the Woods". [[Aesthetics of music#Bad music|Bad music]] was played during the public viewings to complete the ambiance. In an exhibition titled "Awash in Bad Art", 18 pieces of art were covered in shrink wrap for "the world's first drive-thru museum and car wash". Marie Jackson, formerly the Director of Aesthetic Interpretation noted, "We didn't put any watercolors in there."&lt;ref name="irishtimes"/&gt; A 2001 exhibition, "Buck Naked—Nothing But Nudes" featured all of the MOBA nudes hung in a local spa.

MOBA features its works in rotating collections. In 2003, "Freaks of Nature" focused on landscape artwork "gone awry". A 2006 exhibit titled "Hackneyed Portraits" was designed to "pick up some of the slack" when the [[David Hockney]] show at Boston's [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|Museum of Fine Arts]] closed.&lt;ref name="johnson"&gt;Johnson, Carolyn. [http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2006/06/25/dedham_museum_is_proud_home_to_unforgettable_art_thats_anything_but_fine/ "So Bad It's Good: Dedham Museum Is Proud Home to Unforgettable Art That's Anything But Fine"]. ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', June 25, 2006. 1&lt;/ref&gt; MOBA unveiled its show "Nature Abhors a Vacuum and All Other Housework" in 2006; this format continues on the museum's website.

A second gallery opened in 2008 at the [[Somerville Theatre]] in [[Davis Square]], [[Somerville, Massachusetts]], where the collection was placed near both the women's and men's restrooms.&lt;ref&gt;Smykus, Ed.

In February 2009, MOBA announced a fundraiser to assist the [[Rose Art Museum]] at [[Brandeis University]], which was seriously considering whether to sell masterpieces because of the [[global financial crisis of 2008–2009]], made worse for the university by some of its donors losing money in [[Madoff investment scandal|Bernard Madoff's investment scheme]]. Current MOBA curator and [[Balloon modelling|balloon artist]]/musician Michael Frank placed ''Studies in Digestion''—a four-panel piece showing four renditions of the human digestive tract in various media by artist Deborah Grumet—on [[eBay]] for a buy-it-now price of $10,000; the first bid was $24.99.&lt;ref name="english"/&gt; It eventually sold for $152.53 and the meager proceeds went to the Rose Art Museum, while both museums gained publicity.&lt;ref&gt;Bolton, Morgan  Michele.

''[[The Boston Globe]]'', February 15, 2009 &lt;!--Retrieved March 4, 2009--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the museum opened a third location in the offices of the Brookline Interactive Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brookline Gallery|url=http://www.museumofbadart.org/about/brookline.php|website=Museum of Bad Art|publisher=Museum of Bad Art|accessdate=19 January 2016|ref=MOBA Brookline|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203172708/http://www.museumofbadart.org/about/brookline.php|archivedate=3 February 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2012, the branch at the Dedham Community Theater closed to convert the space into a screening room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Museum of Bad Art (Gone)|url=http://www.roadsideamerica.com/story/12264|website=Roadside America|accessdate=19 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another branch has since opened at the New England Wildlife Center in [[South Weymouth, Massachusetts|South Weymouth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New England Wildlife Center Gallery|url=http://www.museumofbadart.org/about/newc.php|website=Museum of Bad Art|publisher=Museum of Bad Art|accessdate=19 January 2016|ref=MOBA South Weymouth|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160116054437/http://www.museumofbadart.org/about/newc.php|archivedate=16 January 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thefts===

The loss of two MOBA works to theft has drawn media attention and enhanced the museum's stature.&lt;ref name="irishtimes"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wulff, Julie "All Things Bad and Beautiful". ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', December 13, 2006. SID2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cobb" /&gt; In 1996, the painting ''Eileen'', by R. Angelo Le, vanished from MOBA.  ''Eileen'' was acquired from the trash by Wilson, and features a rip in the canvas where someone slashed it with a knife even before the museum acquired it, "adding an additional element of drama to an already powerful work", according to MOBA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumofbadart.org/collection/portraiture-9.html Portraiture #9 Eileen] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150224234034/http://www.museumofbadart.org/collection/portraiture-9.html |date=2015-02-24 }}. Museum of Bad Art, 2009. Retrieved on March 8, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum offered a reward of $6.50 for the return of ''Eileen'', and although MOBA donors later increased that reward to $36.73, the work remained unrecovered for many years.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Belanger|Moran|Sceurman|2008|p=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Boston Police Department|Boston Police]] listed the crime as "larceny, other",&lt;ref name="irishtimes"/&gt; and Sacco was reported saying she was unable to establish a link between the disappearance of ''Eileen'' and a notorious heist at Boston's famed [[Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum]] that occurred in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Chris.

Prompted by the theft of ''Eileen'', MOBA staff installed a fake video camera over a sign at their Dedham branch reading (in Comic Sans): "Warning.

Although the museum's motto is "Art too bad to be ignored", MOBA holds rigorous standards as to what they will accept. According to Marie Jackson, "Nine out of ten pieces don't get in because they're not bad enough. What an artist considers to be bad doesn't always meet our low standards."&lt;ref&gt;Swoger, Kate. "Bad Art Finds a Good Home at This Anti-Museum". ''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'', February 26, 2000. K6&lt;/ref&gt; As stated in the introduction to ''The Museum Of Bad Art: Masterworks'', the primary attribute of an ''[[Work of art|objet d'art]]'' to be acquired by MOBA is that it must have been seriously attempted by someone making an artistic statement. A lack of artistic skill is not essential for a work to be included; a prospective painting or sculpture for the collection ideally should "[result] in a compelling image",&lt;ref name="saccox"&gt;{{harvnb|Frank|Sacco|2008|p=x}}&lt;/ref&gt; or as honorary curator Ollie Hallowell stated, the art must have an "Oh my God" quality.&lt;ref name="english" /&gt;

An important criterion for inclusion is that a painting or sculpture must not be boring. Michael Frank says they are not interested in commercial works like ''[[Dogs Playing Poker]]'': "We collect things made in earnest, where people attempted to make art and something went wrong, either in the execution or in the original premise."&lt;ref name="english"/&gt; Montserrat College of Art used MOBA's exhibition as a demonstration to its students that "sincerity is still important, and pureness of intent is valid".&lt;ref name="hirsch"/&gt;

MOBA accepts unsolicited works if they meet its standards. Frequently, curators consider works by artists who display an intensity or emotion in the art that they are unable to reconcile with their level of skill. The museum dedicated a show to "relentless creativity" in an exhibition titled "I Just Can't Stop" that was covered by local news and [[CNN]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumofbadart.org/about/36.html The MOBA news: The Museum of Bad Art (MOBA) Newsletter, Issue #36 Excerpt] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123224026/http://museumofbadart.org/about/36.html |date=2009-01-23 }}.

Accessed, March 31, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Dean Nimmer, a professor at the [[Massachusetts College of Art]] (also holding the title of MOBA's Executive Director of Good Taste), noted the parallels between the Museum Of Bad Art's standards and those of other institutions: "They take the model of a museum of fine arts and apply the same kind of criteria to acceptance for bad work&amp;nbsp;... [Their rules] are very similar to a gallery or museum that says 'Well, our area is really installation art or realist paintings or neo-post-modern abstractions.{{' "}}&lt;ref name="goldberg"/&gt;

MOBA does not collect art created by children, or art traditionally perceived as lesser in quality, such as [[black velvet painting]]s, [[Paint by number|paint-by-numbers]], [[kitsch]], or factory-produced art—including works specifically created for tourists. Curators are also not interested in crafts such as [[Rug making#Hooking|latch hook rug]] kits.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Frank|Sacco|2008|pp=x–xi}}&lt;/ref&gt; MOBA curators suggest that more appropriate venues for such works would be the "Museum of Questionable Taste, The International Schlock Collection, or the National Treasury of Dubious Home Decoration".&lt;ref name="saccox"/&gt;

The Museum Of Bad Art has been accused of being anti-art, or taking works that were sincerely rendered and mocking them. However, Scott Wilson insists that a work of art accepted into MOBA is a celebration of the artist's enthusiasm.&lt;ref name="goldberg"/&gt; Marie Jackson reiterated this thought, saying "I think it's a great encouragement to people... who want to create [and] are held back by fear, and when they see these pieces, they realize there's nothing to be afraid of—just go for it."&lt;ref name="caro"&gt;Caro, Mark, "Not a Pretty Picture—Boston-Area Museum a Monument to the Absolute Worst in Art". ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', May 20, 1997. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Louise Reilly Sacco agreed, stating, "If we're making fun of something, it's the art community, not the artists. But this is a real museum. It's 10 years. It's 6,000 people on a mailing list. It's recognition all over the world."&lt;ref name="Cobb"&gt;Cobb, Nathan. [http://www.boston.com/news/globe/living/articles/2004/02/28/in_dedham_this_museum_is_exhibiting_bad_taste/ "In Dedham, This Museum is Exhibiting 'Bad" Taste"]. ''The Boston Globe'', February 28, 2004. C1&lt;/ref&gt; Curators insist that artists whose works are selected by MOBA enjoy the attention and that it is a [[Win-win game|win-win]]; the museum gains another work of art, and the artist receives exposure in a museum. A 1997 article in ''[[The Chicago Tribune]]'' stated that none of the 10 to 15 artists who had stepped forward to acknowledge their work in MOBA had been upset.&lt;ref name="caro"/&gt;

Many of the works in MOBA are donated, often by the artists themselves. Others come from yard sales or [[thrift stores]]; the Trash Collectors Union in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] has donated works rescued from imminent demise. Occasionally a painting may be purchased; at one time MOBA's policy was not to spend more than $6.50 on any piece.&lt;ref name="irishtimes" /&gt; More recently, twice and even three times that amount has been paid for an exceptional work.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Belanger|Moran|Sceurman|2008|p=158}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those pieces not retained by the museum are included in a "Rejection Collection" that may be sold at auction. In the past, some proceeds went to the [[Salvation Army]] for providing so many of MOBA's pieces; the museum itself usually benefits from most auctions.&lt;ref name="caro"/&gt;

==Collection highlights==
Each painting or sculpture MOBA exhibits is accompanied by a brief description of the medium, size, name of the artist, as well as how the piece was acquired, and an analysis of the work's possible intention or symbolism. ''[[Museums Journal]]'' noted that the discussion accompanying each work would most likely have most visitors reduced "to hysterics".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lewis, Jamie |title=Museum of Bad Art, Boston |journal=[[Museums Journal]] |volume=106 |issue=5 |pages=62 |date=May 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The captions—described as "distinctly tongue-in-cheek commentaries" by David Mutch of the ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]''&lt;ref name=Mutch/&gt;—were primarily written by Marie Jackson, until the "dissolution of the MOBA interpretative staff"; the task was then taken over by Michael Frank and Louise Reilly Sacco.&lt;ref name="saccoxiv"&gt;Frank and Sacco, xiv&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Lucy in the Field with Flowers''===
Many of MOBA's works generate extensive discourse from visitors. ''Lucy in the Field with Flowers'' (oil on canvas by Unknown; acquired from trash in Boston) remains a favorite with the news media and patrons.  As the first work acquired by the museum, ''Lucy'' is "a painting so powerful it commands its own preservation for posterity", setting a standard by which all future acquisitions would be compared, and causing MOBA's founders to question if Scott Wilson found ''Lucy'' or she found him.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stankowicz|Jackson|1996|p=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kate Swoger of ''[[The Gazette (Montreal)|The Montreal Gazette]]'' called ''Lucy'' a "gorgeous mistake", describing her thus: "an elderly woman dancing in a lush spring field, sagging breasts flopping willy-nilly, as she inexplicably seems to hold a red chair to her behind with one hand and a clutch of daisies in the other".&lt;ref name="swoger"/&gt; Author [[Cash Peters]], using less florid language, summarized it as "the old woman with an armchair glued to her ass".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peters|2003|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MOBA's statement about ''Lucy'' reads: "The motion, the chair, the sway of her breast, the subtle hues of the sky, the expression on her face—every detail combines to create this transcendent and compelling portrait, every detail cries out 'masterpiece'."&lt;ref name="lucy"&gt;[http://www.museumofbadart.org/collection/portraiture-1.php Portraiture #1 Lucy In the Field With Flowers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226052249/http://www.museumofbadart.org/collection/portraiture-1.php |date=2009-02-26 }}. Museum of Bad Art, 2009. Retrieved on March 4, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Times]]'' recounted comments left by a museum visitor regarding the "endless layers of mysteries" the image offers: "What is [[Norman Mailer]]'s head doing on an innocent grandma's body, and are those crows or [[F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16s]] skimming the hills?"&lt;ref name="Mailer"&gt;[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/whats_on/listings/article743688.ece "So Bad It's Good: The Arts Online".] ''[[The Times]]'', March 25, 2006. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

''Lucy''{{'s}} granddaughter, a Boston-area nurse named Susan Lawlor, became a fan of MOBA after seeing the portrait in a newspaper.&lt;ref name="lucy" /&gt; She recognized it as her grandmother, Anna Lally Keane (c. 1890–1968); upon seeing the picture, Lawlor snorted [[Coca-Cola]] from her nose in astonishment.&lt;ref name="stank2"&gt;{{harvnb|Stankowicz|Jackson|1996|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting was commissioned by her mother, and it hung in her aunt's house for many years, despite the trepidation family members felt at seeing the final composition. Says Lawlor: "The face is hauntingly hers, but everything else is so horribly wrong. It looks like she only has one breast. I'm not sure what happened to her arms and legs, and I don't know where all the flowers and yellow sky came from."&lt;ref name="caro"/&gt;

===''Sunday on the Pot with George''===

''Sunday on the Pot With George'' (acrylic on canvas by John Gedraitis; donated by Jim Schulman) has been deemed "iconic" by Bella English of ''The Boston Globe'', who assures the work is "100 percent guaranteed to make you burst out laughing".&lt;ref name="english07"/&gt; Wilson has pointed to ''George'' as an example of a technically well-executed piece of art using a subject not usually seen rendered in paint.&lt;ref name="caro"/&gt;

Many admirers of the first work donated to MOBA are hypnotized by the image of a portly man wearing "Y-front" underwear while sitting on a chamber pot, in [[pointillist]] [[impressionism]] similar to the style of [[Georges Seurat]].  One critic speculates the pointillist style in ''George'' may have been acquired "from watching too much TV".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Citro|Foulds|2004|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title refers to the [[Stephen Sondheim]] musical ''[[Sunday in the Park with George]]'', which contains a dramatic recreation of Seurat's painting ''[[A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte]]''. Author Amy Levin suggests that ''George'' is a pastiche of Seurat's painting.&lt;ref name="levin198"&gt;Levin, 198&lt;/ref&gt; The subject of this painting has been "tentatively identified" by the ''[[Annals of Improbable Research]]''—the creators of the [[Ig Nobel]] award—as  [[John Ashcroft]], former [[United States Attorney General]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = The George / John Controversy| work = [[Annals of Improbable Research]]| url = http://improbable.com/projects/george/george-pot.html| accessdate = March 3, 2009| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20091008202247/http://www.improbable.com/projects/george/george-pot.html| archivedate = October 8, 2009| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A visitor was so moved by ''George'' he felt compelled to express his gratitude for its display in the Dedham Community Theatre basement, writing "Someone had slipped into the bathroom as I took in this painting and began peeing loudly into a toilet. The reverberating sound of urine splashing while viewing ''George'' brought the painting to life, and when the denouement of the flush sounded, I wept."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stankowicz|Jackson|1996|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; MOBA's accompanying caption introduces questions and observations: "Can the swirling steam melt away the huge weight of George's corporate responsibilities? This pointillist piece is curious for meticulous attention to fine detail, such as the stitching around the edge of the towel, in contrast to the almost careless disregard for the subject's feet."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumofbadart.org/collection/portraiture-2.html Portraiture #2 Sunday on the Pot With George] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226050142/http://www.museumofbadart.org/collection/portraiture-2.html |date=2009-02-26 }}.

===''Bone-Juggling Dog in Hula Skirt''===
In contrast to the pointillist impressionism of ''George'', the museum also features a "fine example of labor-intensive pointlessism",&lt;ref name="newman"/&gt; according to MOBA staff. Mari Newman's ''Bone-Juggling Dog in Hula Skirt'' (tempera and acrylic paint on canvas; donated by the artist), inspired this description by MOBA: "We can only wonder what possesses an artist to portray a dog juggling bones while wearing a hula skirt."&lt;ref name="newman"&gt;"[http://www.museumofbadart.org/collection/recent06.php Juggling Dog in Hula Skirt] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090502115700/http://www.museumofbadart.org/collection/recent06.php |date=2009-05-02 }}". Museum of Bad Art, 2009. Retrieved on March 4, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; MOBA enjoys the mystery as much as any other aspect of art, however.&lt;ref name="wilson"/&gt;

Newman, a professional artist from Minneapolis, responded to the curators' cogitation by describing how the image came into being. She bought used canvases while a poor art student, and was unsure how to use a canvas with these dimensions. Inspired by a cartoon of a [[dachshund]], she chose that as a subject, but was unhappy with the effect until she added a [[grass skirt|hula skirt]] she had seen in a magazine, and colored dog bones she spied in a pet store. Newman wrote to them, saying "I almost threw it out until I heard of MOBA. After many years of slashing rejected work, now I wish I had saved them all for you."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Frank|Sacco|2008|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Motifs and interpretations===
Travel writer Cash Peters identifies six characteristics common to many of the museum's artworks. The first is that MOBA artists are unable to render hands or feet, and mask them by extending figures' arms off the canvas, hiding them with long sleeves, or placing shoes on feet in inappropriate scenarios. Second, Peters compared artists [[Rembrandt]] and [[J. M. W. Turner]], masters of landscapes, who "could probably paint with their eyes shut" to MOBA artists who apparently did paint with their eyes shut, as skies are often painted in any color but blue, [[flora]] are created without reference to any existing plant organisms, and [[fauna]] appear so small in the background it is impossible to discern what kind of animals they are. Third, MOBA artists apply [[perspective (visual)|perspective]] inconsistently, either from one painting to the next, or within a single work.  Peters's fourth observation concerns the difficulty MOBA artists seem to have in successfully rendering noses: he writes that a nose will be attempted so many times that the work takes on a third dimension as paint is reapplied over and over. Fifth, bad artists favor "mixed media": if in doubt, they glue feathers, glitter, or hair to their work. Lastly, Peters suggests that artists know their work is bad, but apparently feel the piece may be saved by including a monkey or a poodle in the composition.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peters|2003|pp=71–72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since late 2008, MOBA has been experimenting with allowing the public to title and caption some works. According to the curatorial staff, since some of the works are so puzzling, mere artistic interpretation is not sufficient: they must be "interpretated".&lt;ref name="saccoxiv"/&gt; The "Guest Interpretator's Collection" is an invitation for MOBA's visitors to include their thoughts on compelling artworks; a contest decides the best analysis and these interpretations are added as each contest ends.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.museumofbadart.org/interpretations/ The Guest Interpretator's Collection] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090208065825/http://museumofbadart.org/interpretations/ |date=2009-02-08 }}".

Retrieved on March 3, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; A professor at [[Boston University]] offered his thoughts: "The location of the museum as much as its collection suggests a commitment to the abject and a belief in the power and force of culture's marginalized effects. I was also reminded that I need to pick up some toilet bowl cleaner on my way home!"&lt;ref name="english07"/&gt;

[[Commedia Beauregard]], a theatre company whose mission focuses on translation, was inspired by MOBA's mission to create their Master Works series of short play festivals.  The company commissioned six playwrights to write short plays based on MOBA artworks. ''Master Works: The MOBA Plays'' was originally performed in January and February 2009 in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]]. The plays were based on the MOBA pieces ''Mana Lisa'', ''Invasion of the Office Zombies'', ''My Left Foot'', ''Bone-Juggling Dog in Hula Skirt'', ''Gina's Demons'', and ''Lulli, Fowl and Gravestone''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tcdailyplanet.net/article/2009/01/30/theater-master-works-blb-bad-art-good-plays.html&lt;/ref&gt;  After moving to [[Chicago]], the company again produced ''The MOBA Plays'' in March and April 2011, using three of the original plays and translating three new paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://centerstage.net/theatre/shows/10735.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140314090442/http://centerstage.net/theatre/shows/10735.html |archivedate=2014-03-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Museum visitors can sign a guest book, and leave comments.  One Canadian visitor wrote:  "This collection is disturbing, yet I can't seem to look away...Just like a hideous car accident."  Another visitor warns: "Her nipples follow you around the room. Creepy!"&lt;ref name=Lowbrow /&gt;

Response to MOBA's opening and continued success is, for some, evocative of the way art is treated in society. MOBA works have been described as "unintentionally hilarious", similar to the atrocious films of [[Ed Wood]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ffwdweekly.com/Issues/1998/0917/art3.html "Exhibit Preview: The Museum of Bad Art"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720110249/http://www.ffwdweekly.com/Issues/1998/0917/art3.html |date=2008-07-20 }}. ''[[Fast Forward Weekly]]'', September 17, 1998 &lt;!--Retrieved on March 6, 2009--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Visitors—and even MOBA staff—often laugh out loud at displays. In ''Gullible's Travels'', Cash Peters  contrasted this behavior with what is expected of patrons at galleries such as [[Southern California]]'s [[J. Paul Getty Museum|Getty Museum]]; though viewers might find the art at the Getty equally hilarious, were they to show it they would almost certainly be thrown out.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peters|2003|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Louise Reilly Sacco participated in a panel discussion with authorities on art and architecture about standards of beauty and ugliness in art, published in ''Architecture Boston''. She remarked that teachers bring high school art students to MOBA, then to the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (MFA). Sacco observes, "Somehow MOBA frees kids to laugh and point, to have their own opinions and argue about things. Then they take the experience to the MFA, where they might otherwise feel intimidated... Maybe the ugly&amp;nbsp;... frees us."&lt;ref name="architecture"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.architects.org/emplibrary/AB_May_June_2006_RoundTableB.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110109002239/http://www.architects.org/emplibrary/AB_May_June_2006_RoundTableB.pdf |archivedate=9 January 2011|title=Pretty Ugly |author=Architecture Boston |date=May 2006 |pages=18–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sacco believes that extreme ugliness is more striking than extreme beauty, and it forces people to think more deeply about what is wrong or misplaced. She connects this rigid judgment of what does not conform to beauty with intolerance for physical imperfections in people, noting that such rigidity sometimes causes parents to "fix" the perceived flaws in their children's faces to keep them from suffering later.&lt;ref name="architecture"/&gt;

Jason Kaufman, a [[Harvard]] professor who teaches the sociology of culture, wrote that MOBA is part of a social trend he calls "annoyism", where mass media venues promote performances and artists who mix the deliberately bad with the clever. The Museum Of Bad Art happens to embody this trend, and further illustrates its central aim to mock the judgment system by which people identify what is bad from what is not. For Kaufman, "The beauty of MOBA—though beauty is surely the wrong word—is the way it undermines aesthetic criteria from numerous angles."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kaufman | first1 = J. | title = So bad it's good | doi = 10.1525/ctx.2007.6.4.81 | journal = Contexts | volume = 6 | issue = 4 | pages = 81–84| year = 2007 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Amy Levin, describing how American history and culture have been shaped by small local museums, suggests that MOBA is a parody of art itself, and that MOBA's commentary, newsletter, website, and publications mock museums as authorities on what is good art.&lt;ref name="levin198"/&gt; The director of the Ellipse Arts Center, a gallery in [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington, Virginia]], that hosted a traveling exhibition of MOBA works, was astonished to see people's exuberant laughter because no one visiting the Ellipse had ever responded to art this way. She observed, "If I didn't have a sign on the door, people might not think it's so bad. Who's to say what's bad and what's good?"&lt;ref name="lewis"&gt;Lewis, Nicole. [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-694807.html "For Badness' Sake"]. ''[[The Washington Post]]'', October 8, 1998. D5&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Deborah Solomon]], in ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'', asserted that MOBA's success reflects a trend in modern art among artists and audiences. The arrival of [[abstraction]] and [[modern art]] in the early 20th century made art appreciation more esoteric and less accessible for the general community, showing that "the American public ... think[s] of museums as intimidating places ruled by a cadre of experts whose taste and rituals [seem] as mysterious as those of Byzantine priests."&lt;ref name="solomon"/&gt; Bad art is in vogue, as a movement that rejects the anti-sentimentalism that marked earlier disdain for artists such as [[Norman Rockwell]] or [[Gustave Moreau]], according to Solomon.  Garen Daly, a MOBA fan on several Boston-area [[Arts council|art councils]], stated in 1995, "I go to a lot of openings, and sometimes they're pretty damn stuffy."&lt;ref name="hirsch"&gt;Hirsch, James "Gosh, That's Awful!

A1&lt;/ref&gt; Not only does the Museum Of Bad Art offer different fare for the eyes, but instead of the wine and cheese that is provided for most museum and art gallery visitors, a MOBA show provides its patrons with [[Kool-Aid]], [[Fluffernutter]]s and [[cheese puffs]].&lt;ref name="lewis"/&gt;

===Use in academic research===
The Museum Of Bad Art has been used in academic studies as a standard of reference for the spectacularly awful. In one such study, published in ''[[Perspectives on Psychological Science#Journals|Perspectives on Psychological Science]]'', researchers tested the consistency of responses between people asked to make "gut" judgments versus those who gave conscious well-reasoned responses regarding the quality of various pieces of art.  The researchers showed respondents images from MOBA and New York's [[Museum of Modern Art]] (MoMA), and asked them to rate each painting on a scale with two ends representing "Very Attractive" and "Very Unattractive". The study found that those who reasoned in conscious thought were neither more accurate nor as consistent in their ratings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Dijksterhuis | first1 = A. | last2 = Nordgren | first2 = L. F. | doi = 10.1111/j.1745-6916.2006.00007.x | title = A Theory of Unconscious Thought | journal = Perspectives on Psychological Science | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages = 95 | year = 2006 | pmid =  26151465| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Study participants identified and rated MoMA art higher quality, but those who used conscious reasoning did not find MoMA art more attractive than those who rated with "gut" judgments. Furthermore, the deliberators did not find MOBA art as unattractive as those with quicker response times. The study concluded that people who make quick judgments do so more consistently, with no significant change to accuracy.&lt;ref name="Chicago"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Nordgren | first1 = L. F. | last2 = Dijksterhuis | first2 = A. | doi = 10.1086/596306 | title = The Devil is in the Deliberation: Thinking Too Much Reduces Preference Consistency | journal = Journal of Consumer Research | volume = 36 | pages = 39 | year = 2009 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another study that appeared in the ''[[British Psychological Society|British Journal of Psychology]]'', researchers tested how respondents considered balance in artwork composition of differing qualities. Fifteen pairs of works from [[ArtCyclopedia]] by artists such as [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Georgia O'Keeffe]], and [[Georges-Pierre Seurat]], and fifteen from MOBA by artists including Doug Caderette, Unknown, and D. Alix were shown to participants; in each, an item in the painting was shifted vertically or horizontally, and respondents were asked to identify the original. The researchers hypothesized that respondents would identify balance and composition more easily in the traditional masterworks, and that study participants would find a greater change of quality when items were shifted in traditional masterworks than they would in MOBA pieces. However, the study concluded that balance alone did not define art of higher quality for the participants, and that respondents were more likely to see that original art was more balanced than the altered version, not necessarily that the traditional art was significantly better composed and balanced than MOBA works.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7032">The '''music of the former Netherlands Antilles''' is a mixture of native, African and European elements, and is closely connected with trends from neighboring countries such as [[Venezuela]] and [[Colombia]] and islands such as [[Puerto Rico]], [[Cuba]], [[Santo Domingo]], [[Haiti]], [[Martinique]], [[Trinidad]], [[Dominica]], and [[Guadeloupe]]. The former [[Netherlands Antilles]] islands of [[Curaçao]] and [[Aruba]] are known for their typical [[waltz]]es, [[danza]]s, [[mazurka]]s and a kind of music called [[Tumba (music genre)|tumba]], which is named after the [[conga]] drums that accompany it.

The remaining islands are much smaller than Aruba, [[Bonaire]], and Curaçao. They are [[Sint Eustatius]], [[Sint Maarten]] and [[Saba]]. Sint Eustatius has little nightlife, with only one nightclub (the [[zouk]] Largo Height Disco)&lt;ref&gt;[http://caribtourism.net/st-eustatias/entertainment/1591.html Entertainment, CaribTourism.net]&lt;/ref&gt; as of 1996. The inhabitants, "Statians", hold impromptu street dances called "road blocks", using booming car stereos. Saba has a number of dances at various restaurants, including a wide variety of [[hip hop music|hip hop]], [[calypso music|calypso]], [[soca music|soca]], [[Compas|kompa]], [[zouk]], [[bouyon music|bouyon]], [[reggae]] and [[merengue music|merengue]]. Sint Maarten has a well-known [[Carnival]] tradition featuring music and dance, held in mid-April and culminating in the traditional burning of [[King Moui-Moui]], as well as a number of nightclubs and casinos featuring music; popular "spots" where locals go to dance include Boo Boo Jam and Lago Height, both located on the northern (French) part of Sint Maarten; the most popular recent casino band is [[King Bo-Bo]], known as the "King of Calypso".&lt;ref&gt;Cameron, pp. 549 - 582.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern Aruban music ==
Music is very closely connected to the Aruban culture, and plays a major role in holidays, carnivals and informal celebrations. Carnival music originated in Trinidad in the late 18th century, and combines romantic themes, calypso-inspired tunes, and drums from [[Tumba (music genre)|tumba]]. Other Aruban celebrations that are based around music include Dera Gai, Dande, Gaita and Aguinaldo.

== Music of Curaçao ==

== Traditional music on Bonaire ==
The island of Bonaire is known for an array of dances, including the [[Bari]] and [[Simadan]]. Imported [[polka]], [[carioca]], [[Rhumba|rumba]], [[Merengue (dance)|merengue]], [[danza]], [[joropo]], [[jazz]] [[waltz]] and [[mazurka]] are also popular. The [[Baile di Sinta]] is a popular fertility dance, performed around a [[maypole]]. Traditional African [[work song]]s on Bonaire evolved over time into ritual songs with complex dances, instrumentation and polyphony.&lt;ref name="bonaire"&gt;[http://www.geographia.com/bonaire/boncul01.htm Bonaire Culture]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bari, performed during the festival of the same name, as well as at other times, is led by a single singer who improvises lyrics commenting on local events and figures (such a singer is similar to a [[calypsonian]]). Confusingly, the Bari dance, which is performed during the Bari festival, is accompanied by a [[bongo drum|bongo]]-like drum called a Bari. The first part of the dance features men competing in a stylized, [[ritual dance]] for women, followed by a part where the couples dance, though they don't touch (it is similar to tumba).&lt;ref name="bonaire"/&gt;

After the [[sorghum]] harvest in February through April, the [[Simadan]] festival is held to celebrate, with the [[wapa]], a rhythmic, shuffling dance, accompanying the celebration. Simadan's traditional songs include three [[call and response (music)|call-and-response]] forms, the [[Dan Simadan]], [[Belua]] and [[Remailo]].   These use instruments including the bari, [[wiri]], [[karko]], [[quarta]], [[guitar]], [[triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]] and [[clapping]].&lt;ref name="bonaire"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25488">'''Networked learning''' is a process of developing and maintaining connections with people and information, and communicating in such a way so as to support one another's [[learning]]. The central term in this definition is connections. It takes a relational stance in which learning takes place both in relation to others and in relation to learning resources.&lt;ref&gt;Dirckinck-Holmfeld, L., Jones, C., and Lindström, B. (2009) Analysing Networked Learning Practices in Higher Education and Continuing Professional Development. Rotterdam: Sense Publishers, BV&lt;/ref&gt;

Networked learning can offer educational institutions more functional efficiency, in that the curriculum can be more tightly managed centrally, or in the case of vocational learning, it can reduce costs to employers and tax payers.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Fox. ''Studying Networked Learning''. Chapter 5 in [https://books.google.com/books?id=y9UjVXL324EC&amp;lpg=PR7&amp;dq=steve%20fox%20studying%20networked%20learning&amp;pg=PR7#v=onepage&amp;q=steve%20fox%20studying%20networked%20learning&amp;f=false Networked learning: perspectives and issues By Christine Steeples, Chris Jones]. Springer 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is also argued that networked learning is too often considered within the presumption of institutionalised or educationalised learning, thereby omitting awareness of the benefits that networked learning has to informal or [[situated learning]].&lt;ref&gt;Steve Fox. ''Studying Networked Learning'' P81, in [https://books.google.com/books?id=y9UjVXL324EC&amp;lpg=PR7&amp;dq=steve%20fox%20studying%20networked%20learning&amp;pg=PR7#v=onepage&amp;q=steve%20fox%20studying%20networked%20learning&amp;f=false Networked learning: perspectives and issues By Christine Steeples, Chris Jones]. Springer 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Network and networked learning theories can be traced back into the 19th Century, when commentators were considering the social implications of networked infrastructure such as the [[railways]] and the [[telegraph]].&lt;ref&gt;''"The first of these, the old [[w:Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Saint-Simonian]] 'cult of networks', feeds the contemporary desire for a horizontality of social links. The 19th century was characterized by the building of many network infrastructures – telegraph, railway, electricity – and a corresponding egalitarian ideology. Applying the French Revolution ideology to an industrial ground, Saint-Simon, who was both engineer and philosopher, built a theory of the network as the best means to connect people and to strengthen citizenship (Musso, 2003)."'' Musso, P. (2003) Critique des réseaux. Paris: PUF in Rebillard, Franck &amp; Touboul, Annelise. (2010). [http://mcs.sagepub.com/content/32/2/323.extract Promises unfulfilled? 'Journalism 2.0', user participation and editorial policy on newspaper websites]. ''Media, Culture &amp; Society Volume 32''&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, networked learning has its roots in the 1970s, with the likes of Ivan Illich's book, [[Deschooling Society]], through to more recent commentary in the early 2000s, largely inspired by the Internet and social media.

===1970s===
In 1971, [[Ivan Illich]] envisioned 'learning webs' as a model for people to network the learning they needed:

:''I will use the words "opportunity web" for "network" to designate specific ways to provide access to each of four sets of resources. "Network" is often used, unfortunately, to designate the channels reserved to material selected by others for indoctrination, instruction, and entertainment. But it can also be used for the telephone or the postal service, which are primarily accessible to individuals who want to send messages to one another. I wish we had another word to designate such reticular structures for mutual access, a word less evocative of entrapment, less degraded by current usage and more suggestive of the fact that any such arrangement includes legal, organizational, and technical aspects. Not having found such a term, I will try to redeem the one which is available, using it as a synonym of "educational web."'' Ivan Illich, 1971&lt;ref&gt;Ivan Illich. [https://web.archive.org/web/20060224234156/http://ournature.org/~novembre/illich/1970_deschooling.html#chapter6 Deschooling Society], Chapter 6: Learning Webs. Calder &amp; Boyars, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;



In 1977 Christopher Alexander, Sara Ishikawa, Murray Silverstein, Max Jacobson, Ingrid Fiksdahl-King and Shlomo Angel wrote and published ''[[w:A Pattern Language|A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction]]''. In this seminal text, mostly referred to by architects, lists a "Network of Learning" as the 18th pattern,&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Alexander, C. Et al. (1977). [[w:A Pattern Language|A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction]]. ''New York Oxford University Press''. Pp99&lt;/ref&gt; and cites Illich's earlier book as "the most penetrating analysis and proposal for an alternative framework for education." Alexander ''et al.'' go on to advise builders and town planners interested in establishing learning networks with:

:''"...work in piecemeal ways to decentralize the process of learning and enrich it through contact with many places and people all over the city: workshops, teachers at home or walking through the city, professionals willing to take on the young as helpers, older children teaching younger children, museums, youth groups travelling, scholarly seminars, industrial workshops, old people, and so on. Conceive of all these situations as forming the backbone of the learning process; survey all these situations, describe them, and publish them as the city's "curriculum"; then let students, children, their families and neighborhoods weave together for themselves the situations that comprise their "school" paying as they go with standard vouchers, raised by community tax. Build new educational facilities in a way which extends and enriches this network."''

In the 1970s, [[The Institute For The Future]] at [[Menlo Park, California|Menlo Park]] in California experimented with networked learning practices based on the Internet and computer conferencing.&lt;ref&gt;Vallee, J., Lipinski, H., &amp; Miller, R.

===1980s===
In the late 1980s Dr. Charles A. Findley headed the Collaborative Networked Learning project at [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] on the East Coast of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Findley, C (1987). [https://archive.org/details/CollaborativeNetworkedLearningProject-DigitalEquipmentCorporation Collaborative Networked Learning Project - Digital Equipment Corporation]. Primary documents stored on Internet Archive&lt;/ref&gt; Findley's project conducted trend analysis and developed prototypes of collaborative learning environments, which became the basis for their further research and development of what they called Collaborative Networked Learning (CNL),&lt;ref&gt;Findley, Charles A. 1988.

===1990s===
Since the development of the [[Internet]] as a significant medium for access to information and communication, the practice of networked learning has tended to focus on its use. In the first phase of the Internet its use for networked learning was restricted by low bandwidth and the emphasis was largely on written and text based interactions between people and the text based resources they referred to. This textual form of interaction was a familiar academic medium, even though there was recognition of the unique qualities [[hypertext]] emerging in the online form.&lt;ref&gt;Harasim, L. (Ed.). (1990). Online education; perspectives on a new environment. New York: Praeger.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mason, R., &amp; Kaye, A. (1990). Towards a new paradigm for distance education. In L. Harasim (Eds.), Online education: Perspectives on a new environment. New York: Praeger.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, Jean Lave and Etienne Wenger published ''Situated Learning: Legitimate Peripheral Participation'', in which they cited numerous examples of networked learning within a wide range of settings for informal learning and within communities of practice.&lt;ref&gt;Lave. J, Wenger, E. (1991). [https://books.google.com/books?id=CAVIOrW3vYAC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Situated%20Learning%3A%20Legitimate%20Peripheral%20Participation&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Situated Learning: Legitimate Peripheral Participation]. ''Cambridge University Press''&lt;/ref&gt;

In the later half of the 1990s, open, interactive, situated and networked views of learning were marginalised by educational institutions as they tended to develop or deploy content and practice through proprietary learning management systems (e.g. [[Blackboard Inc]], [[WebCT]]), and collaborative work tools such as [[IBM Lotus Notes]]/Learning Space and Quick Place), generally following concepts around "[[e-learning]]". These systems enabled the restriction of access and the management of students for the administrative concerns of educational institutions.&lt;ref&gt;

Since 1998, an international Networked Learning Conference has been held biannually. The conference proceedings from all the conferences since 2002 are available via the [http://www.networkedlearningconference.org.uk/index.php/previous-conferences conference web site].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.networkedlearningconference.org.uk/|title=Home, Networked Learning Conference 2016 - NLC2016, Lancaster University UK|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[http://www.csalt.lancs.ac.uk/csalt/ CSALT], a research group at Lancaster University, UK, associated with the Networked Learning Conference series and several edited collections, defined networked learning as "learning in which information and communication technology is used to promote connections: between one learner and other learners, between learners and tutors; between a learning community and its learning resources".&lt;ref&gt;Goodyear, P. Banks, S. Hodgson, V. and McConnell, D. eds (2004) [https://books.google.com/books?id=csxzmx60BAEC&amp;dq=Peter+Goodyear&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;source=gbs_gdata Advances in Research on Networked Learning]. London: Kluwer Academic Publishers p1&lt;/ref&gt; This definition seems to ignore historical use of the term however, where computing was not of central importance.

===2000s===

In 2000, [[John Seely Brown]] and Paul Duguid released The Social Life of Information and introduced the concept of [[Network of practice|Networks of Practice]] (NoP's), an informal and emergent social network that supports the sharing of information between individuals clustered around a practice. Building on the work done by [[Jean Lave]] and [[Étienne Wenger]] on [[Communities of Practice|community of practice]] (CoP's), Seely Brown and Duguid argued that a network differed from a community in that the relationships among members were more informal and fluid when compared to communities. While CoP's were often localized with strong inter-personal relationships providing group cohesion, NoPs were more global with relationships that were both strong tie and weak tie relationships.&lt;ref&gt;

From around 2004, the idea of networked learning had a popular resurgence, corresponding with the emergence of [[social media]] and concepts of [[open source]], such as is covered in [[Yochai Benkler|Yochai Benkler's]] 2006 book, ''[[The Wealth of Networks]]''.&lt;ref&gt;A complete PDF of the book is freely downloadable on the [http://www.benkler.org/wealth_of_networks/index.php/Download_PDFs_of_the_book wiki of the book] and is available (see [http://www.congo-education.net/wealth-of-networks/ HTML version]) under a [[Creative Commons]] Noncommercial Sharealike license&lt;/ref&gt;

===Open and networked research===
[[File:Open research.ogv|thumb|300px|A brief animation of the core aspects of what makes research open.]]
Some researchers have used networked learning methods to collaborate and support each other's research. The [[v:PhD|Wikiversity page for Doctor of Philosophy]] is supporting a small group interested in pursuing a PhD title informally. They name their practice OpenPhD or Open and Networked PhD.

==Studies==

===Architecture of productive learning networks===
Academics at the [[CoCo Research Centre]], University of Sydney, have been carrying out an extensive analysis of examples of networked learning, in collaboration with the developers and organisers of learning networks in various parts of the world. Their work has focussed on the ''architecture'' of learning networks - aiming to identify arrangements of tasks, tools and people that contribute to successful learning networks. Some conclusions from this work have been published in ''The architecture of productive learning networks'', which also includes a chapter on the history of networked learning.&lt;ref&gt;Carvalho, L. &amp; Goodyear, P. (Eds.) (2014) The architecture of productive learning networks, New York, Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Situated learning===
Some have argued that using formal education as a setting for researching networked learning misses most if not all of the value proposition of networked learning.&lt;ref&gt;Illich. ''[[Deschooling Society]]''. Calder &amp; Boyars, 1971&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Fox proposes [[situated learning]] and [[actor-network theory]] as the better approach for research.&lt;ref&gt;Fox in ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=y9UjVXL324EC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=networked%20learning%3A%20perspectives&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Networked Learning: Perspectives and Issues]'', P82.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24912">'''New literacies''' generally are new forms of [[literacy]] made possible by [[digital technology]] developments, although new literacies do not necessarily have to involve use of digital technologies to be recognized as such. The term "new literacies" itself is relatively new within the field of literacy studies (the first documented mention of it in an academic article title dates to 1993 in a text by David Buckingham).&lt;ref&gt;Buckingham, D. (1993) Towards new literacies, information technology, English and media education. ''The English and Media Magazine,'' Summer, pp. 20–25.&lt;/ref&gt; Its definition remains open, with new literacies being conceptualized in different ways by different groups of scholars.

For example, one group of scholars argues that literacy is now [[deictic]], and see it as continually and rapidly changing as new technologies appear and new social practices for literacy emerge. (Leu, 2000). This group aims at developing a single, overarching theory to help explain new literacies (see, for example, Leu, O'Byrne, Zawilinski, McVerry, &amp; Everett-Cacopardo, 2009; see also, below). This orientation towards new literacies is largely psycholinguistic in nature. Other groups of scholars follow a more sociocultural orientation that focuses on literacy as a social practice, which emphasizes the role of literacy with a range of socially patterned and goal-directed ways of getting things done in the world (see, for example, Gee &amp; Hayes, 2012; Lankshear &amp; Knobel, 2011; Kalantzis and Cope 2011).

Accompanying the varying conceptualizations of new literacies, there are a range of terms used by different researchers when referring to new literacies, including ''21st century literacies'', ''internet literacies'', ''[[digital literacy|digital literacies]]'', ''new [[Media literacy|media literacies]]'', ''multiliteracies'', ''[[information literacy]]'', ''ICT literacies'', and ''[[computer literacy]]''. In the ''Handbook of New Literacies Research'', Coiro, [[Michele Knobel|Knobel]], [[Colin Lankshear|Lankshear]], and Leu (2008) note that all these terms "are used to refer to phenomena we would see as falling broadly under a new literacies umbrella" (pg. 10).&lt;ref&gt;Coiro, J., Knobel, M., Lankshear, C., &amp; Leu, D. J. (2008). Central issues in new literacies and new literacies research. In J. Coiro, M. Knobel, C. Lankshear, &amp; D. J. Leu (Eds.), ''Handbook of new literacies research'' (pp. 1–22). New York: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;

Commonly recognized examples of new literacies include such practices as [[instant messaging]], [[blog]]ging, maintaining a [[website]], participating in online [[Social network service|social networking]] spaces, creating and sharing [[music video]]s, [[podcast]]ing and videocasting, photoshopping images and [[photo sharing]], [[E-mail|emailing]], shopping online, [[digital storytelling]], participating in [[online discussion]] lists, emailing and using [[online chat]], conducting and collating online searches, reading, writing and commenting on [[fan fiction]], collaborating on and writing encyclopedic wikis, processing and evaluating online information, creating and sharing [[Mashup (digital)|digital mashups]], etc. (see: Black, 2008; Coiro, 2003; Gee, 2007; Hunter, 2014; Jenkins, 2006; Kist, 2007; Lankshear &amp; Knobel, 2006; Lessig, 2005; Leu, et al. 2004; Prensky, 2006).

==Definitions: at least two 'camps'==
The field of new literacies is characterized by two theoretically distinct approaches that overlap to some extent. One is informed by cognitive and language processing theories such as [[cognitive psychology]], [[psycholinguistics]], [[Schema (psychology)|schema theory]], [[metacognition]], [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivism]], and other similar theories. This orientation includes a particular focus on examining the cognitive and social processes involved in comprehending online or digital texts (see for example: Leu, 2001; [http://www.readingonline.org/newliteracies/leu/ Leu, Kinzer, Coiro, &amp; Cammack, 2004]; Coiro, 2003; Coiro &amp; Dobler, 2007). Donald Leu, a prominent researcher in the field of new literacies, has outlined four defining characteristics of new literacies, according to a largely [[Psycholinguistics|psycholinguistic orientation]] (see: Leu et al., 2007). First, new technologies (such as the internet) and the novel literacy tasks that pertain to these new technologies require new skills and strategies to effectively use them. Second, new literacies are a critical component of full participation—civic, economic, and personal—in our increasingly global society. A third component to this approach is new literacies are ''deictic''—that is, they change regularly as new technology emerges and older technologies fade away. With this in mind, "what may be important in reading instruction and literacy education is not to teach any single set of new literacies, but rather to teach students how to learn continuously new literacies that will appear during their lifetime."&lt;ref name=Leu/&gt;{{rp|43}} Finally, new literacies are "multiple, multimodal, and multifaceted," and as such, multiple points of view will be most beneficial in attempting to comprehensively analyze them.&lt;ref name=Leu/&gt;{{rp|43}} This orientation makes a distinction between "New Literacies" and "new literacies" theories. Lower case theories are better able to keep up with the rapidly changing nature of literacy in a deictic world since they are closer to the specific types of changes that are taking place and interest those who study them within a particular heuristic. Lower case theories also permit the field to maximize the lenses that are used and the technologies and contexts that are studied. This position argues that every scholar who studies new literacy issues is generating important insights for everyone else, even if they do not share a particular lens, technology, or context; and that this requires a second level of theorising. New Literacies (capitalized), it is argued, is a broader, more inclusive concept, and includes common findings emerging across multiple, lower case theories.  New Literacies theory benefits from work taking place in the multiple, lower case dimensions of new literacies by looking for what appear to be the most common and consistent patterns being found in lower case theories and lines of research. This approach permits everyone to fully explore their unique, lowercase perspective of new literacies, allowing scholars to maintain close focus on many different aspects of the rapidly shifting landscape of literacy during a period of rapid change.  At the same time, each also benefits from expanding their understanding of other, lowercase, new literacies perspectives. By assuming change in the model, everyone is open to a continuously changing definition of literacy, based on the most recent data that emerges consistently, across multiple perspectives, disciplines, and research traditions. Moreover, areas in which alternative findings emerge are identified, enabling each to be studied again, from multiple perspectives.  From this process, common patterns emerge and are included in a broader, common, New Literacies theory. From this orientation, proponents argue, this process enables a particular theorization of New Literacies to keep up with consistent elements that will always define literacy on the Internet while it also informs each of the lower case theories of new literacies with patterns that are being regularly found by others.

The second approach to studying new literacies is overtly grounded in a focus on social practices. According to [[Colin Lankshear]] and [[Michele Knobel]] from this "social practice" perspectives, "new literacies" can refer to "new socially recognized ways of generating, communicating and negotiating meaningful content through the medium of encoded texts within contexts of participation in [[Discourse]]s (or, as members of Discourses) ".&lt;ref&gt;Lankshear, C., &amp; Knobel, M. (2006). New literacies: Everyday practices &amp; classroom learning  (2nd ed.). pg. 65. New York: Open University Press and McGraw Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; From this perspective "new" refers to the presence of two dominant features of contemporary [[literacy]] practices. The first is the use of digital technologies as the means of producing, sharing, accessing and interacting with meaningful content. New literacies typically involve screens and pixels rather than paper and type, and digital code (that renders texts as image, sound, conventional text, and any combination of these within a single process) rather than material print. The second defining feature of new literacies is their highly collaborative, distributed, and participatory nature, as expressions of what [[Henry Jenkins]]&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, H. (2006). Fans, bloggers and gamers: Exploring participatory culture. New York: New York University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; calls engagement in [[participatory culture]], and Lankshear and Knobel&lt;ref&gt;Lankshear, C., &amp; Knobel, M. (2006). New literacies: Everyday practices &amp; classroom learning  (2nd ed.). New York: Open University Press and McGraw Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; refer to as a distinctive ''ethos''.

==Research in new literacies==
Research within the field of new literacies is also diverse. A wide range of topics and issues are focused upon, and a broad range of methodologies are used.

===Online research and comprehension===
One aspect of new literacies that has attracted researchers' attention is school-age children's online research and comprehension. Specifically, researchers are interested in finding the answers to questions such as how reading online differs from traditional print-based reading. Donald Leu, Julie Coiro, Jill Castek, Laurie Henry, and others attempt to understand how students become adept at reading online to learn and how students acquire the necessary skills, strategies, and dispositions required to do so. Initial work in this area referred to online reading comprehension&lt;ref name=Leu&gt;Leu, D. J., &amp; Zawilinski, L., Castek, J., Banerjee, M., Housand, B. C., Liu, Y., &amp; O'Neil, M. (2007). What is new About the new literacies of online reading comprehension?. In Secondary School Literacy: What Research Reveals for Classroom Practice (Chapter 3, pp. 37–68). Retrieved from http://teachers.westport.k12.ct.us/ITL/wkspmaterials/NCTE%20chapter.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, however, the construct "online research and comprehension" is being used since this more precisely describes the type of reading being described in their work.&lt;ref name=Leu2&gt;Leu, D. J., Kinzer, C. K., Coiro, J., Castek, J., Henry, L. A. (2013). New literacies: A dual level theory of the changing nature of literacy, instruction, and assessment. In Alvermann, D.E., Unrau, N.J., &amp; Ruddell, R.B. (Eds.). (2013). Theoretical models and processes of reading (6th ed.). (pp. 1150-1181). Newark, DE: International Reading Association. Available at: http://www.reading.org/Libraries/books/IRA-710-chapter42.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; According to Leu and colleagues, the new literacies of online research and comprehension is a process of problem-based inquiry using information on the Internet. It includes the skills, strategies, dispositions, and social practices that take place as we read online information to learn and is based around five practices: "At least five processing practices occur during online research and comprehension: (1) reading to identify important questions, (2) reading to locate information, (3) reading to evaluate information critically, (4) reading to synthesize information, and (5) reading to communicate information. Within these five practices reside the skills, strategies, and dispositions that are distinctive to online reading comprehension as well as to others that are also important for offline reading comprehension (Leu, Reinking, et al., 2007)."&lt;ref name=Leu2/&gt;{{rp|1164}}

===Online fan fiction and adolescents===
Recent research in the field of new literacies has focused on [[fan fiction]] on the internet, especially those stories published online by adolescents (see for example: Black, 2008; Thomas, 2007; Jenkins, 2006). Online fan fiction websites, such as [[FanFiction.Net]], are spaces where fans of all ages, but especially adolescents and younger school-age fans, are able to use these new [[information and communication technologies]] (ICTs) to write and craft fictional stories based on their favorite characters in popular media such as movies, television, and graphic novels. Adolescents are participating more and more on these kinds of sites, not only engaging with "pop culture and media, but also with a broad array of literate activities that are aligned with many school-based literacy practices"&lt;ref&gt;Black, R. W. (2007). Digital design: English language learners and reader reviews in online fiction. In M. Knobel &amp; C. Lankshear (Eds.), ''A New Literacies Sampler,'' pp. 115–136. New York: Peter Lang.&lt;/ref&gt;

Of course, adults are just as able to spend time in such online environments—and they do. However, it is interesting to consider that young people were born into a digitally rich world, and thus could be seen as "digital natives", and therefore interact with the online environment in a fundamentally distinct way than an older generation of people, so-called "digital immigrants".&lt;ref name=Hansford&gt;Adlington, R., &amp; Hansford, D. (2009). Digital spaces and young people's online authoring: Challenges for teachers. ''Australian journal of language and literacy, 32''(1, 2).&lt;/ref&gt; As digital natives, adolescents "use the online world to share, evaluate, create, report and program with each other differently to digital immigrants," and they engage easily and readily with new digital technologies such as instant messaging, file sharing songs and videos, and post all kinds of 'texts', stories, photos, and videos among them.&lt;ref name=Hansford/&gt; A central characteristic of digital natives is their "desire to create."&lt;ref name=Hansford/&gt; Digital natives are engaged in "programming to some extent, whether it be by including a piece of HTML code that personalizes a MySpace page or creating a Flash animation. They are creating web pages, blogs, avatars and worlds; and, in stark contrast to digital immigrants, digital natives readily report and share their ideas."&lt;ref name=Hansford/&gt;

===Video games===
[[James Paul Gee]] described [[Video game|video gaming]] as a new literacy "in virtue of the ways game design involves a multimodal code comprising images, actions, words, sounds, and movements that players interpret according to gaming conventions".&lt;ref&gt;Coiro, J., Knobel, M., Lankshear, C., &amp; Leu, D. J. (Eds.) (2008). ''Handbook of new literacies research'' (pp. 251). New York: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; Gee notes that game players participate in their game's world as a form of social practice, especially in real-time [[Strategy video game|strategy games]] in which players can compete with each other to build on land masses, for instance, and in which they can shape and convey their virtual identities as a certain kind of strategist. Video games continue to use new digital technologies to create the symbols players interpret to encode and decode the meanings that constitute the game.&lt;ref&gt;Gee, J. P. (2008). ''What video games have to teach us about learning and literacy, revised and updated''. Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan&lt;/ref&gt; Many ways in which students learn literacies, increasingly, are happening outside of school rather than inside of school.

Other researchers have expanded the body of knowledge about video games as a new literacy, particularly as they relate to classroom learning&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gerber|first=H. R.|title=From the FPS to the RPG: Using Video Games to encourage reading YAL|journal=The ALAN Review|year=2009|volume=36|issue=3|pages=87–91}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Squire&gt;{{cite book|last=Squire|first=Kurt|title=Video Games and Learning: Teaching and Participatory Culture in the Digital Age|year=2011|publisher=Teachers College Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (see for example: Lacasa, Martinez, &amp; Mendez, 2008; Sanford &amp; Madill, 2007). In one study,&lt;ref name=Lacasa&gt;Lacasa, P., Martinez, R., &amp; Mendez, L. (2008). Developing new literacies using commercial videogames as educational tools. ''Linguistics and Education, 19.''&lt;/ref&gt; researchers examined how video games, supported by discussions and dramatic performances in the classroom, can contribute to the development of narrative thought as demonstrated in written compositions in various contexts. Namely, the researchers engaged primary school children in activities designed to teach them to tell, play out, and write stories based on the most popular video game in their classroom, ''[[Tomb Raider]]''. Although it was a challenging process at times, researchers discovered that the use of new digital media such as video games actually "complements the use of other written or audiovisual methods [in the classroom] and permits the development of multiple literacies in the classroom."&lt;ref name=Lacasa/&gt;{{rp|103}}

==The classroom==
It has become clear to many researchers in the field that new literacies research has important implications for the classroom. Kist (2007), for example, observes how new literacies can be used in classroom settings—from the use of rap music to anime to digital storytelling, there are already instances of teachers attempting to blend new literacies with traditional literacy practices in the classroom.&lt;ref name=Kist&gt;Kist, W. (2007). Basement new literacies: Dialogue with a first-year teacher. ''English Journal, 97''(1), 43–48.&lt;/ref&gt; Kist asks: "Can new literacies indeed 'fit' into how we currently 'do' school?" Kist notes that "the new literacies instruction that does exist often comes only out of the fortitude of lonely pioneers of new literacies."&lt;ref name=Kist/&gt;{{rp|44}}

Knobel and Lankshear (2011) argue that if educators and prospective teachers engage in blogging, or participate in "[[affinity spaces]]" devoted to practices like fan fiction, video game-playing, music and video remixing, photosharing, and the like, they will better understand how new literacies can better be integrated into worthwhile classroom learning.&lt;ref&gt;Lankshear, C., &amp; Knobel, M. (2011). ''New literacies: Everyday practices &amp; classroom learning'' (3rd ed.). pg. 255. New York: Open University Press and McGraw Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;

Leu, Coiro, Castek, Hartman, Henry and Reinking (2008) have begun to explore the use of a modified instructional model of reciprocal teaching that reflects some of the differences between offline and online reading contexts. In an instructional model known as Internet Reciprocal Teaching, each student has his/her own laptop with access to the Internet and students work in small groups to facilitate interactive group work and discussions about strategy use.  In addition, Internet Reciprocal Teaching with online informational resources (as opposed to narrative texts) and strategy instruction on both the common and unique processes by which students navigate through multiple and different texts, rather than the reading of one common text. Teachers and students model their choices about which links are most relevant to a group or individual question through think-alouds. They discuss how to efficiently locate information within different kinds of websites, how to synthesize ideas across multiple texts and media, how to make judgments about the quality of the information and the author's level of expertise, and how to best represent the answers to their questions. Responsibility for monitoring and effectively using these strategies to solve online information problems is gradually released to the students  using an instructional scheme with three phases: Phase 1 includes direct, whole class instruction of basic skills and strategies of Internet use; Phase 2 includes group work and the reciprocal exchange of online reading comprehension strategies by students with their peers; and Phase 3 includes online individual inquiry units, sometimes with collaborative efforts involving other students in other classes, perhaps even in other parts of the world, and periodic strategy sessions with groups.&lt;ref&gt;Leu, D. J. Jr., Coiro, J., Castek, J., Hartman, D. K., Henry, L. A., &amp; Reinking, D. (2008). Research on instruction and assessment of the new literacies of online reading comprehension. In C. C. Block, S. Parris, and P. Afflerbach, (Eds.), Comprehension instruction: Research based best practices. New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Students "are the first generation to be global publishers to access the raw material of information and to create refined knowledge products for application.  They understand the social skills of working with people who they will never meet face to face.  They also understand that they need to take more responsibility for managing their own learning.  They do not see the boundaries of school as a solid wall.  They see school as a global communications center."

{{distinguish|ablation|ablution (disambiguation)}}
'''Oblation''', meaning an offering ([[Late Latin]] ''oblatio'', from ''offerre'', ''oblatum'', to offer), is a term used, particularly in ecclesiastical use, for a solemn [[:wikt:offering|offering]] or presentation to God.

==Bible use==
The Latin Vulgate, and following this many English versions such as the KJV, 1611, uses the word to stand for the [[meal offering]] under the [[Law of Moses]].

==Ecclesiastical use==
It is thus applied to certain parts of the [[Eucharist]]ic service in liturgical [[Christianity]]. The rites of Roman Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy, Anglicanism, and some Lutheran churches employ an oblation: gifts of bread and wine are offered to God.&lt;ref name="souvay"&gt;C. Souvay (1911). [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11215d.htm Offerings]. In ''The Catholic Encyclopedia''. New York: Robert Appleton Company. Retrieved April 12, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bcp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bcponline.org/HE/he2-altgt.htm|title=Alternative Forms of the Great Thanksgiving|author=|publisher=The (Online) Book of Common Prayer |date= April 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ocp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ocf.org/OrthodoxPage/liturgy/liturgy.html |title=The Divine Liturgy of St. John Chrysostomos |author= |date= |publisher=The Orthodox Christian Page |accessdate=January 9, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080615045105/http://web.ukonline.co.uk/ephrem/lit-james.htm |archivedate=June 15, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Liturgically speaking, there are two oblations: the lesser oblation, sometimes known as the [[offertory]], in which the bread and wine, as yet unconsecrated, are presented and offered to God, and the greater oblation, the oblation proper, in which the Body and Blood of Christ are offered to God, the Father.

The word [[oblate (religion)|oblate]] is also an ecclesiastical term for persons who have devoted themselves or have been devoted as children by their parents to a monastic life. Oblate is more familiar in the Roman Catholic Church as the name of a Religious Congregation of secular or diocesan priests, the Oblate Fathers of St. Charles. They are placed under the absolute authority of the bishop of the diocese in which they are established and can be employed by him on any duties he may think fit. This congregation was founded in 1578 under the name of Oblates of the Blessed Virgin and St. [[Ambrose]] by St. [[Charles Borromeo]], Archbishop of Milan.

A similar congregation of [[laity|secular]] [[priests]], the '''Oblates of Mary Immaculate''', was founded at Marseilles in 1815.

==Annualia==
In Catholicism, annualia were a specific type of oblation made for a deceased person by their family, though sources disagree on the nature of the offering. The 1728 ''[[Cyclopædia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences]]'' defines the annualia as a solemn [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] celebrated yearly on the date of the deceased person's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/HistSciTech/HistSciTech-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=HistSciTech.Cyclopaedia02.p0300&amp;id=HistSciTech.Cyclopaedia02&amp;isize=M&amp;q1=oblation|title=History of Science: Cyclopædia, or, An universal dictionary of arts and sciences: O - opposition|last=|first=|date=|website=digicoll.library.wisc.edu|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources state that the annualia was a series of Masses performed each day for a year on behalf of the deceased, at the behest of their family, who would pay a stipend to the clergy member performing the rites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=2DJDAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA15&amp;dq=annualia&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi37KCMiZDSAhUm8YMKHSKnCxYQ6AEIRDAH#v=onepage&amp;q=annualia&amp;f=false|title=Abstracts on money, prices and agriculture in the United Kingdom|date=1655-01-01|publisher=R.

In [[sewing]], '''piping''' is a type of [[trim (sewing)|trim]] or [[embellishment]] consisting of a strip of folded fabric so as to form a "pipe" inserted into a [[seam (sewing)|seam]] to define the edges or [[style line]]s of a garment or other textile object. Usually the fabric strip is cut on the [[bias (textile)|bias]].  It may be made from either self-fabric (the same fabric as the object to be ornamented) or contrasting fabric, or of leather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Threads|first=Susan|last=Khalje|date=August–September 2005|volume=120|publisher=Taunton Press|pages=40–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, piping is common on [[upholstery]] and decorative [[pillow]]s, but it is also used on clothing.  Piped pocket openings, garment edges, and seams are characteristic of [[Western wear]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=How the West Was Worn |authors=George-Warren, Holly, and Michelle Freedman|publisher=Harry N. Abrams|year=2001|pages=181, 194, 199|isbn= 0-8109-0615-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecclesiastical use==
Piping is used extensively on the [[cassock]]s of clergy in western rite Christianity, particularly in the [[Roman Catholic]] and [[Anglican]] churches. Coloured piping is often used on black cassocks to indicate rank.

In the Roman Catholic church, cassock piping is: black for priests; purple for [[Chaplain of His Holiness|chaplains of His Holiness]]; [[Amaranth (color)|amaranth red]] for [[Bishop (Catholicism)|bishops]], [[Protonotary apostolic|protonotaries apostolic]], and [[Honorary Prelate]]s; and [[scarlet (color)|scarlet red]] for [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiu.edu/~mirandas/instruction69.htm |title=Instruction on the Dress, Titles and Coats-of-Arms of Cardinals, Bishops and Lesser Prelates, 28 March 1969 |publisher=Fiu.edu |date= |accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Anglican church piping is not used universally, many clerics preferring a plain cassock of solid colour. The most common cassock piping in the Anglican church is [[scarlet (color)|scarlet red]] piping for cathedral deans and canons, and for archdeacons; additionally bishops may wear black cassocks with [[Amaranth (color)|amaranth red]] (usually called purple) piping.

==Theme==
[[Poorna Malavath]] (Aditi Inamdar) belongs to a Telugu speaking tribal family in [[Pakala, Nizamabad district]] in the Telangana state of [[India]]. Her parents (mother Lakshmi and father Devidas) are farm labourers. She joins the State Social Welfare Residential Educational Institutions Society for her education. Her talent is spotted by the un-corrupt secretary of the Society Dr R.S. Praveen Kumar ([[Rahul Bose]]). The chief minister [[N. Kiran Kumar Reddy]] ([[Harsha Vardhan]]) authorises her for Operation Everest along with a Dalit mountaineer, Sandhanapalli Anand Kumar (Manoj Kumar). In preparation for climbing [[Mount Everest]] headed by Coach Shekhar Babu (Gyanendra Tripathi) and Colonel Khan ([[Arif Zakaria]]), she treks to mountains of [[Ladakh]] and [[Darjeeling]]. On 25 May 2014, Poorna scales the highest peak of [[Mount Everest]] and, aged 13 years and 11 months, becomes the youngest girl in the world to have reached the summit of [[Everest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://telanganatoday.news/biopic-malavath-poorna-silver-screen|title=Biopic on Malavath Poorna set to hit the silver screen|date=11 January 2017|work=Telangana Today|access-date=16 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

===Critical reception===

Poorna received a positive response from the critics based on the reviews. Neil Soans of ''[[The Times of India]]'' appreciated the film saying, "Returning to a directorial capacity after 16 years, Rahul Bose recognizes the beauty in simplicity and uses it to the film's advantage. Grounded performances combined with stirring music elevate this relatively straightforward tale, making it essential viewing not only for the young Indian woman, but for anyone looking to scale great heights against all odds." and gave it a rating of 4 stars out of 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/movie-reviews/poorna/movie-review/57895418.cms |title=A small film that stands tall |work=[[The Times of India]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sarit Ray of ''[[The Hindustan Times]]'' praised the film saying, "Poorna shows you that incredible stories can be told simply.

Even rarer is the use of a smattering of Telugu in the dialogues, which, along with an effective musical score, augments the authenticity of the film's setting and soundscape. It also draws enormous strength from the deeply affecting performances by newcomer Aditi Inamdar (in the role of the resolute Poorna) and Bose himself (as the unwavering mentor firm in his belief that it is his responsibility as a bureaucrat to facilitate positive change in the lives of the most disadvantaged)." and gave the film a rating of 3 stars out of 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://movies.ndtv.com/movie-reviews/poorna-movie-review-rahul-boses-film-is-soulful-simple-3041 |title=Poorna Movie Review: Rahul Bose's Film Is Soulful, Simple |publisher=[[NDTV]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19765">'''Sociological Art''' is an artistic movement and approach to [[aesthetics]] that emerged in France in the early 1970s and became the basis for the Sociological Art Collective formed by [[:fr:Hervé Fischer|Hervé Fischer]], [[Fred Forest]], and [http://www.jeanpaulthenot.fr/ Jean-Paul Thénot] in 1974.

==From 1968 to 1974==

As early as 1968, art critics [[Pierre Restany]] and [[François Pluchart]] used the term “sociological art” to refer to socially engaged and less commercial practices among a diverse set of artists, including body artists [[Gina Pane]] and [[Michel Journiac]], Spanish-born video artist Joan Rabascall, Hervé Fischer, Fred Forest, and Jean-Paul Thenot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Forneris|first=Jean|title=arTitudes de François Pluchart: une revue internationale|year=1979|publisher=Galerie d'art contemporain des musées de Nice|location=Nice|pages=13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the fall of 1973, François Pluchart initiated a debate between Journiac, Pane, Fischer, and Thenot, which was published as “Ten Questions on Sociological Art” (“Dix questions sur l’art sociologique”) in the art magazine artTitudes, which he had founded in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pluchart|first=François|title=Dix questions sur l'art sociologique|journal=arTitudes|date=March 1974|issue=6/8|pages=4–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of sociological art might also be traced through the independent practices of Fischer, Forest, and Thenot who would later form the Sociological Art Collective. These practices must themselves be put into dialogue with broad international artistic tendencies towards social engagement and the social sciences, evident, for instance, in the work of [[Stephen Willats]] and [[Hans Haacke]], exhibitions such as Art into Society, Society into Art (Institute of Contemporary Art, London, 1974), and the intellectual histories of social art history and sociology of art.

In the mid-1960s, Forest (born 1933, Algeria) began a series of actions using of audiovisual and communication technologies to challenge conventional artistic media and activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lassignardie|first=Isabelle|title=Fred Forest: Catalogue Raisonné (1963-2008)|year=2010|publisher=Université de Picardie/Amiens|location=Amiens|url=http://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/docs/00/51/52/32/PDF/These_Fred_Forest_-_Commentaire.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Images of many works are available at [http://webnetmuseum.org/html/en/expo-retr-fredforest/actions/actions_en.htm Webnetmuseum] He projected slides onto his paintings (''Tableau Ecran'', 1963), initiated community events in impoverished neighborhoods (''Family Portrait'', 1967), and used video to engage social spaces ("Mur d’Arles'' and ''Cabine Telephonique", 1967).  In the early 1970s, his utilization of the press and video as tools of social engagement and political provocation expanded. In January 1972, Forest began his "Space Media" project by placing a blank rectangle in the newspaper ''Le Monde'' and inviting readers to fill it in and mail it to him. For an exhibition entitled “Archeology of the Present” (“Archeologie du present”) at the Galerie Germain, Paris, in May 1972, Forest took the street where the gallery was located, Rue Guénegaud, as a topic, creating a video circuit displaying the street in the gallery and the gallery in the windows facing the street and collecting trash from the street to show in the gallery. Pierre Restany carried out short interviews with passersby for an episode of “Forum des Arts", aired on May 13, 1973. In June 1973, with the collaboration of the philosopher Vilem Flusser and sociologist Philippe Butaud, Forest set up a video studio in a community of retirees to launch a video exchange in the south of France ("Video Troisieme Age", 1973). On the occasion of the XII Bienal de São Paulo in October 1973, he effectuated a series of events, including a version of Space Media, a sociological walk, and a procession through the city center with participants holding white placards ("Blancs evanhit la ville"), all of which were provocations in the face of the established military dictatorship. Always highly critical of those in power, committed to participatory art, and deeply engaged with new communication technologies, Forest would continue these pursuits after joining the collective in October 1974.

Hervé Fischer (born 1941, France) was a student of sociology and taught the sociology of communication and culture at the Sorbonne beginning in the early 1970s. Initially involved with [[:fr:Supports/Surfaces|“Support/Surface,”]] Fischer did a series of “Essuie-mains” paintings with handprints on cloth rolls as a means of deconstructing the medium of painting. He also began various campaigns, grouped under the title “Hygiene de l’art,” to eradicate art of traditional mores and media, and even invited artists to send him their works, which he tore up and displayed in small plastic bags (“La déchirure des oeuvres d’art”). Around 1974, his projects shifted away from the medium of painting toward more marginal and popular visual idioms, such as stamps and street signs, and into performances in the social realm.

Jean-Paul Thenot (born 1943, France) was trained as a psychotherapist, a profession he continued while producing art. Around 1969, he began creating artworks, beginning with his “Interventions in the Street,” which consisted of a series of scaled sculptures of everyday objects, such as mousetraps, set up in public space. Around 1970, he moved away from producing objects into largely textual and conceptual works, such as his “Constats d’existence,” typed pages of commentary on contemporary artists that were mailed to various figures in the art world. In 1972, he began conducting interactive surveys about art and perception. In response to the infamous, state-sponsored “Expo 72” (“Douze ans de l’art contemporain en France”), he carried out a large survey inviting respondents to select the most representative French artists and then declared the person whose submitted list was closest to the averaged, final list the honorary curator of a public exhibition opening that May.

The three artists met at openings and events in the early 1970s and were part of a global trend in artistic practice toward more conceptual and less skill-based art that was intentionally anti-commercial. In France, the events of May and June 1968 had irrevocably changed how many artists conceived of their work. While each artist brought areas of expertise—Forest’s interest in new media, Fischer’s theoretical grounding, and Thenot’s inquiry-based research—a commitment to engage the public, to oppose traditional and commercially-driven art, and to affect social change united the three artists.

==From 1974 to 1980==

In the summer of 1974, Journiac organized a series of meetings at his apartment on [[Île Saint-Louis]] in Paris to discuss the initiation of an artist movement engaged with critical and sociological realities. The meetings brought together artists such as Gina Pane, Bertrand Lavier, Thierry Agullo, Joan Rabscall, Jocelyne Hervé, Sonso, Hervé Fischer, Jean-Paul Thenot as well as art critics François Pluchart and Bernard Teyssedre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Galland|first=Blaise|title=Art sociologique, Méthode pour une sociologie esthétique|year=1986|publisher=Georg|location=Switzerland}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was from these meetings that the impulse to form the Sociological Art Collective emerges, and on October 10, 1974, the Sociological Art Collective was officially declared with the publication in newspaper ''Le Monde'' of its first manifesto, signed by Hervé Fischer, Fred Forest, and Jean-Paul Thénot. From this date onwards, these artists would alternate between practices claiming this lineage and their own personal practices. Concretely speaking, the collective published a number of texts, including [http://webnetmuseum.org/html/en/expo-retr-fredforest/textes_critiques/textes_divers/2manifeste_art_socio_en.htm#text three manifestos]; organized and effectuated a series of projects, including four group exhibitions and large-scale urban interventions; and founded the Ecole Sociologique Interrogative.

Their activity instantiates an early moment in the history of what would be called in the mid-1990s relational art or socially-engaged art but also connected with a number of artistic tendencies of the 1970s, such as conceptual art, performance art, and institutional critique. For example, the Collective’s two-week intervention in the southern French town of Perpignan in July 1976, entitled "Study and Animation of Perpignan" began with a study of the conditions and needs of neighborhoods in Perpignan by a thirty-person, interdisciplinary team and then led to dozens of direct interventions, which included pop-up exhibitions, screenings, interviews, parties, and a multi-neighborhood photograph swap, all aimed to, as the press release notes, “bring together different neighborhoods [. . .], which although geographically close remain distant at the level of social communication.”  After setting out four principles—critique, communication, intervention, and pedagogy—the group proposes sociological art as means to overcome the divide between “a quasi-scientific approach to the environment and a lived connection established among individuals [. . .] and the studied environment.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fred Forest Archive, Inathèque |author2=Collectif d'art sociologique|title=Communique, Enquete Animation à Perpignan Par le Collectif|date=September 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This project and related texts indicate three key aspects that broadly characterized sociological art.  First, artistic labor included activities such as organizing, writing, research, and teaching. The expansion of traditional artistic skills to integrate intellectual and white-collar skills related to the broader transition from an industrial economy to service and [[information economy]]. Second, projects developed in dialogue with specific sites and their associated audiences. Whether focused on a town or a particular community, sociological art aimed to increase awareness about social conditions of existence through exchange with sites and humans. Third, sociological art was usually time-based and ephemeral and funded primarily by grants, personal finances, and commissions. The remaining material, therefore, consists largely of documentation rather than “rarified” art objects bought, sold, and collected.

For six years, the Collective carried out a handful of collaborative sociological art projects, participated in colloquia and exhibition, generated a community of collaborators, and provided support for independent work. Interlocutors included [[Henri Lefebvre]], [[Edgar Morin]], [[Vilem Flusser]], [[Jean Duvignaud]], [[Jorge Glusberg]], [[Kristine Stiles]], and numerous artists, including [[John Latham (artist)|John Latham]] of the [[Artist Placement Group]], [[Stephen Willats]], and [[Ken Friedman]]. Tensions developed among Fischer, Forest, and Thenot, and in 1980, Forest and Thenot published an ad in ''Art Press'' selling the Ecole Sociologique Interrogative, which was located in Fischer’s apartment, and wrote a tract declaring the end of the Collective.

==Theory==

Sociological Art aimed to develop a critical analysis of art and society through interventionist artistic practices and associated writing that drew on the methods and theories of sociology. It envisioned art in terms of interaction, animation, pedagogy, and the creation of structures of exchange, provocation, and disruption of conventional social behaviors with a view to denouncing all and any forms of conditioning. As summarized by Fred Forest: “The practical aim of Sociological Art is to provide the necessary conditions of existence for various devices that frame a given efficient and effective questioning or investigation, thereby establishing the optimal conditions for a situation of [[intersubjectivity]].”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  | url= http://www.webnetmuseum.org/html/fr/expo-retr-fredforest/textes_critiques/text_critiques_fr.htm
  | accessdate = 2007-11-04 }}''L'art sociologique a pour objet pratique de réunir les conditions necessaires à la mise en oeuvre de " dispositifs" de nature diverses, à partir desquels une fonction de questionnement et d'interrogation pourra être développée efficacement en vue d'établir les conditions optimum d'une situation intersubjective.''
.&lt;/ref&gt; Sociological Art was a politically engaged response to an art world that was perceived as being out of touch both with the technologies and the society of its time. This stance was in strict opposition to reigning modernist and formalist dogmas that privileged medium specificity and authorial intention.

Various theoretical influences can be traced through sociological art. In a classical examine of [[Situationist]] [[détournement]], Sociological Art aimed to draw attention to the channels of power and mass communication it was aiming to undermine. It called upon derision, simulacrum and participation in order to explode or alter a certain reality structured by the social codes of the time. Considering how ideology structured society related to contemporaneous analyses in French critical theory, such as Louis [[Althusser]]’s idea of [[Ideological State Apparatus]] as well as [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]]’s writing on power. At the same time, sub-disciplines within the social sciences emerged to study art and culture, including the [[sociology of art]] and [[visual anthropology]], and applied novel method and theories to draw attention to art’s socio-economic frames.

==Beyond==

Following the dissipation of the Sociological Art Collective, its founders retained certain sociological tenets in their later work and pursuits. Fischer continued work with the Ecole Sociologique Interrogative and carried out large-scale urban interventions. He then moved to Montreal, where he worked as a curator of new media, and in 2010, he has a large retrospective exhibition in Céret.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Nouvelle Nature,  Hervé Fischer: regard rétrospectif et vision contemporaine|year=2010|publisher=Musée d'art moderne of Céret|location=Céret}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Forest launched his subsequent theory of Communication aesthetics and continued his work as a teacher and artist, becoming an important early theorist and practitioners of net and internet art. In 2007, Forest had a retrospective exhibition at Slought Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Art and Society: The Work of Fred Forest|url=http://www.slought.org/content/11348/|accessdate=19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thenot focused on the therapeutique potential of art and video in his work as a psychotherapist. In 2010, he had an exhibition, called an "Intervention d'art sociologique" at Galerie Flux in Liege that included a [http://fluxnews.skyrock.com/2933461241-L-art-sociologique-en-reactivation-Entretien-entre-Jean-Paul-Thenot-et.html video interview] with the artist. All three continued to write prodigiously and have recently exhibited their artwork again. Though relatively unknown today, Sociological Art is thoroughly emblematic of the historical upheavals of the late 1960s and 1970s in France and Europe generally and prefigures many of the most prominent trends in art since the mid-1990s.

'''Space-themed music''' is any music, from any genre or style, with lyrics or titles relating to outer space or space travel.

Songs or other musical forms influenced by the concept of outer space have appeared in music throughout history, both in instrumental and vocal pieces with lyrics. As early as [[Ancient Greece]], [[Pythagoras]] believed in something called the "[[harmony of the spheres]]". He believed that since planets and the stars all moved in the universe according to mathematical equations that these mathematical equations could be translated into musical notes and thus produce a symphony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pythagoras: His Life, Teaching, And Influence|last= Riedweg |first= Christoph |date=2005|publisher=[[Cornell University Press]]|pages=29, 30, 116|isbn= 0-8014-4240-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This idea was explored further throughout Western history under the theories of [[Musica universalis]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} Some more recent and widely different examples are ''[[The Planets]]'' by [[Gustav Holst]],{{Contradiction-inline|date=January 2018}}&lt;!--The linked article states plainly that Holst's planetary associations were purely astrological, and therefore nothing to do with "space".--&gt; and the song "[[Space Oddity]]" by [[David Bowie]]. Outer space also appears as a theme in "[[space age]]" retro pop music, such as [[Stereolab]]'s ''[[Space-Age Bachelor Pad Music]]''.

Music about outer space attracts enthusiastic listeners from all walks of life. Some have created web pages to share their interests. [[NASA]], [[JPL]], and the US Governmental Centennial of Flight Commission even have a webpages showcasing and discussing music about outer space.

==Music about outer space==
In 1958, [[Karl-Birger Blomdahl]] composed an opera [[Aniara (opera)|Aniara]] to a libretto by Erik Lindegren based on the poem [[Aniara (poem)|Aniara]] by [[Harry Martinson]], a tragedy set aboard a [[space ship]].

In 1958, [[Russell Garcia (composer)|Russ Garcia]] recorded an exotica album called [[Fantastica (album)|Fantastica]] on [[Capitol Records]] that was about space travel.

In 1969, [[The Beatles]] released single [[Across the Universe]].

In 1972, [[Elton John]] released single [[Rocket Man (song)|Rocket Man]].

The same year, [[Tangerine Dream]] released their double album [[Zeit]], featuring space-related track titles such as ''Birth of Liquid Plejades'' and ''Nebulous Dawn'', as well as cover art depicting a [[solar eclipse]]. It is considered one of the first (possibly the first) [[Dark ambient]] albums.

In 2016, [[Avenged Sevenfold]] released their album [[The Stage (album)|The Stage]], a concept album about the universe, and artificial intelligence. The song "Exist" contains a spoken word section written and performed by astrophysicist [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]].

[[Eduard Artemyev]] has made space-themed music, for example for a space film [[Solaris (1972 film)|Solaris]] (1972), although his best known and [[Siberiade#In popular culture|successfully covered]] space-themed sounding piece might be the theme song for non-space film [[Siberiade]] (1979).

The Japanese musician [[Isao Tomita]] has produced many albums with space-based themes, such as ''The Planets'' (1976), his version of Holst's suite; ''Kosmos'' (1978); ''Bermuda Triangle'' (1979); ''Dawn Chorus (Canon of the Three Stars)'' (1984); ''Space Walk – Impressions Of An Astronaut'' (compilation, 1984); ''Mind of the Universe – Live at Linz'' (1985); ''Back to the Earth – Live in New York'' (1988); and ''Nasca Fantasy'' (supporting [[Kodo (taiko group)|Kodo]], 1994).

The [[Vangelis]] album ''[[Albedo 0.39]]'' (1976) is entirely devoted to space, while a segment of ''[[Heaven and Hell (Vangelis album)|Heaven and Hell]]'' (1975) was used as the theme to the [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] television series ''[[Cosmos: A Personal Voyage|Cosmos]]'' by [[Carl Sagan]]. His work ''[[Mythodea]]: Music for NASA's [[Mars Odyssey]] Mission'' is reflective of his interest in space exploration. 
&lt;ref&gt;[http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/spotlight/vangelis01.html NASA Spotlight on Vangelis music for Mars Odyssey Mission]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mike Oldfield]]'s 1994 album ''[[The Songs of Distant Earth (album)|The Songs of Distant Earth]]'' was based on [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s [[science fiction|SF]] novel ''[[Songs of Distant Earth]]''.  Pop songs also mention outer space, such as [[Chris de Burgh]]'s "[[A Spaceman Came Travelling]]", the [[Bonzo Dog Band]]'s "[[I'm the Urban Spaceman]]", [[David Bowie]]'s "[[Space Oddity]]", [[Elton John]]'s "[[Rocket Man (song)|Rocket Man]]", Major Tom by Peter Schilling, and [[Deep Purple]]'s "[[Space Truckin]]'".  ''[[To Our Children's Children's Children]]'' by [[The Moody Blues]] was a 1969 album inspired by spaceflight.

Several albums have featured music inspired by the [[Apollo program|Apollo space program]].  In 1983, [[Brian Eno]] with his brother [[Roger Eno]] and producer/recording artist [[Daniel Lanois]], composed the score for the film ''[[For All Mankind]]'', a documentary of NASA's [[Apollo program]]; an album of the music, ''[[Apollo: Atmospheres and Soundtracks]],'' was later released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Prendergast|first=Mark| date= 2000|title=The Ambient Century: From Mahler to Trance – the Evolution of Sound in the Electronic Age|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing, New York|pages= 125|isbn= 1-58234-134-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On [[The Orb]]'s 1991 two-disc debut album, ''[[Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld]]'', disc one of  features an [[Ambient music|ambient]] musical simulation of the [[Apollo 11]] moon journey, including excerpts of NASA recordings of the radio conversations between [[Mission Control]] and the [[astronaut]]s in space.

The [[filk]] anthology albums ''[[Minus Ten and Counting]]'' (1983) and ''[[To Touch the Stars]]'' (2003) celebrate and promote the exploration of outer space.

Author and classical music critic [[David Hurwitz (music critic)|David Hurwitz]] describes [[Joseph Haydn]]'s choral and chamber orchestra piece, ''The Creation'', composed in 1798, as space music, both in the sense of the sound of the music, ("a genuine piece of 'space music' featuring softly pulsating high violins and winds above low cellos and basses, with nothing at all in the middle ... The space music gradually drifts towards a return to the movement's opening gesture ...  "); and in the manner of its composition, relating that Haydn conceived ''The Creation'' after discussing music and astronomy with [[William Herschel]], oboist and astronomer (discoverer of the planet Uranus).&lt;ref name="haydn"&gt;{{cite book  | last = Hurwitz | first = David | title = Exploring Haydn: A Listener's Guide to Music's Boldest Innovator | date = 2005  | publisher = Hal Leonard | isbn = 1-57467-116-2 | series = Amadeus Press Unlocking the Masters Series  | pages = 78–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another band to use space as musical inspiration is the [[Christian]] "[[Astro music|Astro]]-[[Rock music|Rock]]" group [[Brave Saint Saturn]], whose three albums, ''[[So Far from Home]]'', ''[[The Light of Things Hoped For]]'', and ''[[Anti-Meridian (album)|Anti-Meridian]]'', form a [[trilogy]] that chronicles the journey of the fictional spaceship, the ''USS Gloria'', on a trip to survey the [[moons of Saturn]]. The music uses space narratives, lingo, samples and quotes to portray the journey.

==Soundtracks for movies and TV shows about outer space==

Soundtracks of science fiction movies and television and radio series often feature music associated with outer space, such as ''[[Star Wars]]'', ''[[Star Trek]]'', ''[[Doctor Who]]'', ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'', ''[[Red Dwarf]]'', ''[[The X Files (film)|The X-Files]]'', and others.

The [[theremin]] is an [[electronic musical instrument]] associated with a very [[wiktionary:eerie|eerie]] sound, which has led to its use in [[movie soundtrack]]s such as those in ''[[The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951 film)|The Day the Earth Stood Still]]''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==Music played in planetariums and observatories==

Many forms of music are used [[Observatory]] and [[Planetarium]] shows, particularly genres such as [[Electronic music]], [[Western classical music|classical music]], [[Space music]], and [[Space rock]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hobbyspace.com/Music/music3.html  Enthusiast's website with detailed information about music for Planetariums and generally about outer space]&lt;/ref&gt;  Some artists, such as [[Geodesium]], specialize in creating custom music for Planetariums.

During the 1970s, [[IMAX]]'s OMNIMAX (now IMAX Dome) film system was conceived to operate on planetarium screens. More recently, some planetariums have re-branded themselves as "dome theaters," with broader offerings including wide-screen or "wraparound" films, [[fulldome|fulldome video]], and laser shows that combine music with laser-drawn patterns.

==Music made with sounds of outer space==

Energy sources in the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]], such as lightning, can produce sounds (''sferics'', ''tweeks'', and ''[[Whistler (radio)|whistlers]]'') in the very low frequency ([[Very low frequency|VLF]]) radio band.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spaceweather.com/glossary/inspire.html space weather glossary sounds information]&lt;/ref&gt;

Objects in [[Outer space|space]] – the [[Sun]], [[planet]]s, [[star]]s, [[quasar]]s, [[pulsar]]s, [[Galaxy|galaxies]], and [[Active galactic nucleus|active galaxies]] – all produce [[Electromagnetic spectrum|signals]] that, if received (usually through radio astronomy dishes and processed), can be used by a musician as the basis for any kind of composition imaginable.

==Production==
According to an interview with actor Gary Kent, writer-director Don Jones lost his house acquiring funding for the making of the film: "He hocked his house to make the film.

== Release ==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2014}}
The film was released theatrically in America. It also ran under the title ''Terror in the Forest'', released in 1982 by Fury Films Ltds.

It was released as a video in the 1980s and 1990s by Prism Entertainment and [[Starmaker (home video distributor)|Starmaker Video]].

On November 7, 2006, [[Code Red DVD|Code Red]] released the film on DVD with an [[anamorphic]] widescreen transfer, a stills gallery, and commentary with director Don Jones and Gary Kent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|title=The Forest|publisher=Code Red|format=DVD|year=2006|orig-year=1982|asin=B000HC2LQC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a part of their Exploitation Cinema line, Code Red rereleased the film in 2009 as a double feature with ''[[Don't Go in the Woods (1981 film)|Don't Go In The Woods]]''. This release did not include the commentary or stills gallery, but retained the widescreen transfer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=DVD Talk|url=https://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/37727/dont-go-in-the-woods-the-forest/|title=Review: Don't Go in the Woods / The Forest|date=June 26, 2009|author=Jane, Ian|accessdate=March 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''[[TV Guide]]'' awarded the film one out of four stars, writing: "This obscure low-budgeter gives the ''[[Friday the 13th (1980 film)|Friday the 13th]]'' formula a bit of a twist, introducing both a cannibal angle and ghosts. A human-flesh-eating madman terrorizes people in a patch of woods, haunted by the ghosts of his murdered wife and children. A poorly made effort that barely saw a theatrical release and is now available everywhere on videotape for less than 10 bucks."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[TV Guide]]|url=http://www.tvguide.com/movies/the-forest/review/123565/|accessdate=March 19, 2018|title=The Forest}} {{rating|1|5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Todd Martin from ''HorrorNews.net'' gave the film a negative review, stating that the film was "boring, lame, and the death scenes left a lot to be desired".&lt;ref name="martin13"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Martin |first1=Todd |title=Film Review: The Forest (1982) |url=http://horrornews.net/64508/film-review-the-forest-1982/ |website=HorrorNews.net |accessdate=22 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Hysteria Lives'' gave the film 1/5 stars, calling it "a grade Z, back-packing slash-a-thon which starts with too very wooden (but hey that's ok, it ties in nicely with the forest theme!), middle aged actors being offed by briefly glimpsed back wood loon."&lt;ref name="hysterialivesrev"&gt;{{cite web |title=THE FOREST |url=http://www.hysteria-lives.co.uk/hysterialives/Hysteria/the_forest.html |website=Hysteria Lives.co.uk |publisher=Hysteria Lives! |accessdate=22 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Brett Gallman from ''Oh, the Horror!'' wrote, "''The Forest'' is an incoherent mess of a flick... There’s almost no redeeming value to the film, as the acting is terrible, the music is generic, and the direction is mediocre. I can somewhat praise the photography, as I have seen worse in these low budget slashers... Beyond this, you only have a half baked story about a cannibal man and his ghost kids that only registers on the unintentional comedy scale."&lt;ref name="gallman08"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gallman |first1=Brett |title=Horror Reviews - Forest, The (1982) |url=http://oh-the-horror.com/page.php?id=31 |website=Oh the Horror.com |publisher=Brett Gallman |accessdate=22 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Order of the Stick''''' ('''''OOTS''''') is a comedic [[webcomic]] that satirizes tabletop [[role-playing games]] and [[medieval fantasy]]. The comic is written and drawn by [[Rich Burlew]], who illustrates the comic in a [[stick figure]] style.

Taking place in a magical world that loosely operates by the rules of the [[Editions of Dungeons &amp; Dragons#Dungeons &amp; Dragons v3.5|3.5 edition]] of the role-playing game ''[[Dungeons and Dragons]]'' (''D&amp;D''), the comic follows the sometimes farcical exploits of six adventurers as they strive to save the world from an evil [[Lich (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|lich]] [[Sorcerer (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|sorcerer]]. Much of the comic's humor stems from the characters' awareness of the game rules that affect their lives or from having [[anachronism|anachronistic]] knowledge of modern culture. This in turn is often used by the author to [[parody]] various aspects of role-playing games and fantasy fiction. While primarily comedic in nature, ''The Order of the Stick'' features a continuing storyline serialized in one-to four-page episodes, with over 1000 such episodes released so far.

Although it is principally distributed online through the website ''Giant in the Playground'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.giantitp.com|title=Giant in the Playground}}&lt;/ref&gt; seven book collections have been published, including several print-only stories (''On the Origin of PCs'' and ''Start of Darkness''). An alternate version of the strip appeared monthly in [[Dragon (magazine)|''Dragon'' magazine]] for 22 issues; these strips, among others, are collected in ''Snips, Snails and Dragon Tales''.

==History==
''The Order of the Stick'' began its run on September 29, 2003, on what was Rich Burlew's personal site for gaming articles at the time. Burlew initially intended the strip to feature no plot whatsoever—depicting an endless series of gags drawn from the D&amp;D rules instead—but Burlew quickly changed his mind, and began laying down hints of a storyline as early as strip #13.&lt;ref name=DCFp20&gt;Burlew, ''Dungeon Crawlin' Fools'', Author Commentary, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; The strip was originally produced to entertain people who came to his website to read articles, but it quickly became the most popular feature, leading Burlew to eventually abandon writing articles almost entirely.&lt;ref name=DCFp5&gt;Burlew, ''Dungeon Crawlin' Fools'', Introduction, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Order of the Stick'' began as a twice-weekly comic that debuted new strips on Mondays and Thursdays. When presales of the first ''OOTS'' compilation book allowed Burlew to make writing his full-time job, he increased the number to three per week.&lt;ref name="GITPNews2/17/05"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.giantitp.com/index4.html#ZO077QwnU5SEfN09hcw |title=Do Quit Your Day Job |accessdate= 2008-04-12 |last=Burlew |first=Rich |authorlink=Rich Burlew |date=2005-02-17 |work= Giant in the Playground News |publisher=GiantITP.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2007, the comic has been published on an irregular schedule due to the author's ongoing health concerns.&lt;ref name="GITPNews7/7/07"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.giantitp.com/index.html#yOSODsgTNhjraLs4GSe |title=An Important Announcement About OOTS |accessdate= 2008-04-12 |last=Burlew |first=Rich |authorlink=Rich Burlew |date=2007-07-07 |work= Giant in the Playground News |publisher=GiantITP.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2012, Burlew had an accident in which the tendons in his right hand were severed,&lt;ref name="GITPNews9/19/12"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.giantitp.com/index.html|title=Hi Everyone |last=Burlew |first=Mrs. |date=2012-09-19 |work= Giant in the Playground News |publisher=GiantITP.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PCmagazine" /&gt; resulting in a hiatus until December 31, 2012.&lt;ref name="GITPNews12/31/12"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.giantitp.com/index.html#f952CzHnLAmXZtNFeNk|title=There's a New Comic |last=Burlew |first=Rich |authorlink=Rich Burlew |date=2012-12-31 |work= Giant in the Playground News |publisher=GiantITP.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of September 2013, Burlew estimated that the story will be finished in "about four years".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Burlew|first=Rich |authorlink=Rich Burlew |date=2013-09-29 |url=http://www.giantitp.com/index.html#y4gGFEGTKuaFz4luwE9 |work=Giant in the Playground News |publisher=GiantITP.com|title=9/29/2013 News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Dragon'' magazine ===
On September 30, 2005, Burlew announced that ''The Order of the Stick'' would begin appearing in ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'', the long-running official ''D&amp;D'' magazine.&lt;ref name="PCmagazine"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2399081,00.asp|title=The Best Webcomics 2015|access-date=2016-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Paizo"&gt;[http://paizo.com/paizo/news/v5748eaic9k1l Paizo Publishing Creates Strategic Alliance with ''The Order of the Stick'' creator Rich Burlew] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304015247/http://paizo.com/paizo/news/v5748eaic9k1l |date=2016-03-04 }}, ''[http://www.paizo.com/ Paizo.com]'', September 30, 2005.

The ''Dragon'' version of ''OOTS'' featured the same main cast of six adventurers, but saw them adventuring in an unspecified underground location. None of the villains or supporting characters from the online strip appeared, with the exception of [[Characters of the Order of the Stick#Lawyers|Mr. Jones and Mr. Rodriguez]], who appeared together twice.&lt;ref name="Dragon351" group="n"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burlew|first=Rich|date=January 2007|title=The Order of the Stick: It Was Just a Matter of Time Anyway|journal=Dragon|publisher=[[Paizo Publishing|Paizo Publishing, LLC]].|issue=351|authorlink=Rich Burlew}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dragon359" group="n"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burlew|first=Rich|date=September 2007|title=The Order of the Stick: End of the Line, Thanks for Riding|journal=Dragon|publisher=[[Paizo Publishing|Paizo Publishing, LLC]].|issue=359|authorlink=Rich Burlew}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burlew has stated that the events of the ''Dragon'' strips take place in an alternate universe from the online strip, and events in one storyline do not affect the other.&lt;ref name="GITPNews10/10/05"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.giantitp.com/index3.html#DNSedGQuL91veK9lIS|title=UberCon and Paizo|last=Burlew|first=Rich|authorlink=Rich Burlew|date=2005-10-10|publisher=GiantITP.com|accessdate=2008-04-12|work=Giant in the Playground News}}&lt;/ref&gt; This status quo was broken for the sake of a joke, however, when a character in the online strip referred to the July 2006 ''Dragon'' strip by claiming that "I told you that in one of the Dragon Magazine comics, so I'm not even sure that's the same continuity."&lt;ref name="Dragon345" group="n"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burlew|first=Rich|date=July 2006|title=The Order of the Stick: The Tongue is Mightier Than the Sword|journal=Dragon|publisher=[[Paizo Publishing|Paizo Publishing, LLC]].|issue=345|authorlink=Rich Burlew}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oots0475" group="n"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2007|title=Crashing the Party|url=http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0475.html|journal=The Order of the Stick|publisher=GiantITP.com|issue=#475|author=Burlew, Rich|authorlink=Rich Burlew|accessdate=2008-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in January 2013, a new version of the comic appeared in ''Gygax Magazine'', a new tabletop gaming magazine published in print and digital formats.&lt;ref name="Wired"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/geekdad/2013/01/gygax-magazine/|title=A New TSR to Launch Gygax Magazine Saturday|date=25 January 2013|publisher=Condé Nast|last1=Gilsdorf|first1=Ethan|work=Wired|accessdate=24 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolution of art style===
The comic is created directly on a computer using the [[vector graphics editor|vector-based software]] [[Adobe Illustrator]], and the art style has been upgraded several times.&lt;ref name=FAQ3&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.giantitp.com/FAQ.html#faq3 |title=How do you make the OOTS strips? |accessdate= 2008-04-12 |last=Burlew |first=Rich |authorlink=Rich Burlew |date=2005-03-04 |work=Giant in the Playground FAQ |publisher=GiantITP.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In strip #103, the curved and crooked [[Panel (comics)|panel]] borders were replaced with straight—though still slanted—black lines.  Burlew now questions how he ever thought the initial format was acceptable.&lt;ref name=oots0101 group=n&gt;{{cite journal |author=Burlew, Rich | authorlink = Rich Burlew |title=Man-to-Man Chat |url=http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0101.html |journal=The Order of the Stick |year=2004 |issue=#101 |publisher=GiantITP.com |accessdate=2008-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DCFp158&gt;Burlew, ''Dungeon Crawlin' Fools'', Author Commentary, p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; After he sprained his wrist in 2005, Burlew used some of the time he took off from writing the comic to improve the designs of the main cast, straightening their lines and adding tiny details like the [[rune]]s stitched along the edge of Vaarsuvius' cloak.&lt;ref name=NCPBp108/&gt; These changes were humorously acknowledged by the characters themselves when they premiered.&lt;ref name=oots0198 group=n&gt;{{cite journal |author=Burlew, Rich | authorlink = Rich Burlew |title=The Great Kazoo |url=http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0198.html |journal=The Order of the Stick |year=2005 |issue=#198 |publisher=GiantITP.com |accessdate=2008-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burlew made adjustments to the colors that were required when the material was to appear in print for the first time.&lt;ref name=NCPBp108 /&gt; The later comics feature more frequent double- and even triple-page strips than in the early days, when longer strips were reserved for special occasions (such as reaching #200). In strip #947 the artwork was upgraded again, adding volume to characters' limbs that were previously drawn as simple stick-figure lines. In addition to these permanent improvements to the art, two variant art styles are used to distinguish the events of certain comics from those taking place in the story's present. Historical events relating to the plot are portrayed in a hand-drawn [[crayon]] style both in the online comic and in ''Start of Darkness'',&lt;ref name=oots0273 group=n&gt;{{cite journal |author=Burlew, Rich | authorlink = Rich Burlew |title=The Crayons of Time: Doodles on the Sketch Pad of Eternity |url=http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0273.html |journal=The Order of the Stick |year=2006 |issue=#273 |publisher=GiantITP.com |accessdate=2008-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SODp36 group=n&gt;Burlew, ''Start of Darkness'', p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; while events in the "prequel" print-exclusive stories are shown in black-and-white.

=== Representation of minorities ===
Burlew has said that he includes stances on social topics in his comic because he worries about the impact of his work beyond momentary distractions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.giantitp.com/forums/showsinglepost.php?p=16453175&amp;postcount=152&lt;/ref&gt; He has also written that he is attempting to compensate for past instances of "unintentional sexism and/or insensitivity to gender issues"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.giantitp.com/forums/showthread.php?411301-Interview-Questions-For-Rich/page4&amp;p=19165054#post19165054&lt;/ref&gt; but, being a straight white male, he finds difficult to talk authoritatively about minorities without the proper knowledge.&lt;ref name=BRitFp320&gt;Burlew, ''Blood Runs in the Family'', p. 320.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characters==
{{Main article|Characters of The Order of the Stick}}

===Protagonists===
The comic's central protagonists, known collectively as "The Order of the Stick," are a party of adventurers who are questing to destroy an evil [[lich]] that is planning to conquer the world. Though they have many allies, the official members of the Order of the Stick are:

*'''Roy Greenhilt''': A 29-year-old&lt;ref name="oots0500"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0500.html | work = Episode 500 | title = A Reason To Keep Trying }}&lt;/ref&gt; lawful good veteran [[Fighter (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|fighter]], Roy assembled the Order and acts as party leader. Roy is a [[counterstereotype]] of the traditional ''dumb fighter'' [[cliché]].
*'''Haley Starshine''': A 24-year-old&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0168.html | title = The Order of the Stick # 168 | accessdate = 2010-01-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; red-haired chaotic good [[Human (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|human]] [[Rogue (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|rogue]]. Greedy and obsessed with treasure, Haley is the second-in-command of the team.
*'''Belkar Bitterleaf''': A barefoot chaotic evil [[halfling]] [[Ranger (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|ranger]], Belkar unrepentantly kills sentient creatures for entertainment.
*'''Durkon Thundershield''': A 55-year-old lawful good [[Dwarf (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|dwarf]], Durkon is the party's [[Cleric (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|cleric]], worshipping [[Characters of the Order of the Stick#Thor|Thor]] as his patron deity. 
*'''Elan''': A 21-year-old chaotic good [[Bard (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|bard]]. Though not very intelligent, Elan knows a lot about genre conventions and storytelling tropes.
*'''Vaarsuvius''': A true-neutral high-[[Elf (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|elven]] [[Wizard (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|wizard]], Vaarsuvius' gender is intentionally unclear, which goes as a [[running joke]].

===Antagonists===
The comic's central antagonists include the following:
*'''[[Xykon]]''' (Formerly human [[Lich (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|Lich]] [[Sorcerer (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|Sorcerer]], Chaotic Evil&lt;ref name=oots0446 group=n&gt;{{cite journal |author=Burlew, Rich | authorlink = Rich Burlew |title=Hell of a Job |url=http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0446.html |journal=The Order of the Stick |year=2007 |issue=#446 |publisher=GiantITP.com |accessdate=2008-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;): The archvillain of the story,&lt;ref name=oots0023 group=n&gt;{{cite journal |author=Burlew, Rich | authorlink = Rich Burlew |title=Meanwhile. |url=http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0023.html |journal=The Order of the Stick |year=2003 |issue=#23 |publisher=GiantITP.com |accessdate=2008-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Xykon is engaged in a plot to conquer the world by controlling a world-destroying being known as the Snarl.&lt;ref name=SODp45 group=n&gt;Burlew, ''Start of Darkness'', p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; While he has a notoriously short attention span and requires near-constant amusement, he is also capable of truly horrific acts of evil.&lt;ref name=SODp98 group=n&gt;Burlew, ''Start of Darkness'', p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

*The '''[[Monster in the Dark]]''': An enigmatic, childlike monster that lurks in darkness under a pink umbrella. Although designated as Xykon's secret weapon, the Monster is terrified of almost everything, including the dark. On the rare occasions he has used force, he demonstrates incredible power. The paladin [[Characters of The Order of the Stick#O-Chul|O-Chul]] deemed the Monster "a good man" after befriending him.
*'''[[Characters of The Order of the Stick#Tsukiko|Tsukiko]]''': A female human [[Mystic Theurge]] imprisoned in Azure City for necromancy. She was released by the Azurites to help them during the battle against Xykon, but betrayed them and joined him instead. She has a [[necrophiliac]] attraction to Xykon, who rejects her advances.
*The '''[[Linear Guild]]''': An adventuring party comprising "[[evil twin|evil opposites]]" to the Order, led by Elan's literal evil twin, '''Nale'''. While the Guild originally sought a powerful magic artefact, its purpose turned solely toward defeating the Order after their first encounter with them.
*'''[[Miko Miyazaki]]''' (Human [[Monk (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|Monk]]/[[Paladin (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|Paladin]], [[Alignment (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)#Lawful Good|Lawful Good]]): Strongest warrior of the Sapphire Guard,&lt;ref name=oots0409 group=n&gt;{{cite journal |author=Burlew, Rich | authorlink = Rich Burlew |title=Intercession |url=http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0409.html |journal=The Order of the Stick |year=2007 |issue=#409 |publisher=GiantITP.com |accessdate=2008-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miko is dispatched to apprehend the Order at the request of her liege.

*'''[[Characters of The Order of the Stick#General Tarquin|General Tarquin]]''': The de facto ruler of the Empire of Blood on the Western Continent and the father of Elan and Nale, General Tarquin is a lawful evil fighter who has schemes within schemes. Much like Elan, Tarquin is genre-savvy and has a flair for the dramatic, and becomes upset when others fail to respect literary convention.
*'''[[Characters of The Order of the Stick#Minister Malack|Minister Malack]]''': A [[Alignment (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)#Lawful Evil|Lawful Evil]] [[lizardfolk]] cleric of [[Nergal (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|Nergal]] and close friend of Tarquin. He harbors a grudge against Nale for killing his children and befriends Durkon soon after they meet.

==Plot==
[[File:OOTS1withbkgd.png|thumb|''The Order of the Stick #1'' begins with the protagonists [[in medias res|in the midst of a battle]].]]
While the online version of ''The Order of the Stick'' unfolds continuously, the strips have been broken down into plot arcs for purposes of publication; the plot summary that follows breaks the story down into these arcs for clarity. Burlew notes in the commentary of ''War and XPs'' that the strips contained within that volume were the first to be plotted with publication in mind from the very beginning.&lt;ref name=WAXPp5&gt;Burlew, ''War and XPs'', Introduction, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Several volumes have been released in book-only format: ''On the Origin of PCs,'' a prequel to the heroes' adventures;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.giantitp.com/GIPOTS00.html&lt;/ref&gt; ''Start of Darkness,'' a prequel to the villains' escapades;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.giantitp.com/GIPOTS99.html&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Snips, Snails and Dragon Tails,'' a collection of all the ''Dragon Magazine'' comics plus 80 pages of new material.

===''Dungeon Crawlin' Fools''===
The webcomic begins with the Order fighting [[Goblin (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|goblins]] and other monsters on their way through the Dungeon of Dorukan (although the first volume of the printed edition later included a preamble showing how the Order finds and enters the Dungeon). They are led by Roy Greenhilt on a quest to destroy a lich sorcerer named Xykon. Roy is motivated by nightly visits from the [[ghost]] of his father, from whom he receives a cryptic warning. The Order briefly joins forces with an adventuring party known as the [[Linear Guild]], led by Nale (the evil twin of the Order's happy-go-lucky bard, Elan). The Guild eventually betrays the Order, but the Order prevails due to Roy's sudden understanding of his father's prophecy. Durkon Thundershield, the Order's dutiful dwarf cleric of [[Thor]], enjoys a sexual encounter with the Guild's dwarf cleric of [[Loki]] Hilgya Firehelm, but they shortly afterwards part in tears. The Order goes on to battle Xykon near a mysterious magical gate. Xykon shatters Roy's ancestral sword, but before he can release his ace-in-the-hole (a powerful monster shrouded in darkness), Roy flings him into a deadly mystic rune that protects the gate. Xykon's body is destroyed, but his disembodied soul is ferreted to safety by his lieutenant, [[Redcloak]]. The book ends with Elan accidentally destroying the entire dungeon, including the gate, by activating another magic [[rune]]. The Order escapes to safety.&lt;ref name=DCFTotal&gt;Burlew, ''Dungeon Crawlin' Fools''.&lt;/ref&gt; The printed book contains strips 1–121, plus extras.

===''No Cure for the Paladin Blues''===
The Order travels to Wooden Forest, where Vaarsuvius slays a black [[dragon]] and they loot its hoard in order to retrieve a rare "starmetal" to repair Roy's broken sword. The party is arrested by the paladin [[Miko Miyazaki]] for the capital crime of destroying the magical gate in the Dungeon of Dorukan. While stopping at an inn, the party loses the dragon's treasure in an explosion, the shock of which renders Haley unable to speak coherently (rendered as cryptograms in the comic). In Azure City, Miko's liege, Lord Shojo, informs the Order that the gate they destroyed is one of five gates that reinforce the structure of the universe. Without them, a god-killing abomination known as the Snarl would escape and destroy all of creation. The Order is put on trial, but acquitted with the help of Celia, a sylph they had aided in the Dungeon of Dorukan. Shojo later explains that the trial was a sham to get the Order's assistance in defending the remaining gates. Roy reluctantly agrees once he learns that Xykon has survived and is recruiting a massive army of [[Hobgoblin (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|hobgoblins]] to seize the remaining gates. As payment for their future aid, each member of the Order receives a boon, one of which is the repair of Roy's sword.&lt;ref name=NCPBTotal&gt;Burlew, ''No Cure for the Paladin Blues''.&lt;/ref&gt; The printed book contains strips 122–301, plus extras.

===''War and XPs''===
The Order makes a brief diversion to Cliffport to confront the Linear Guild. After Nale frames Elan for the Linear Guild's crimes, Elan escapes from prison and reunites with Haley with the help of a dashing swordsman named Julio Scoundrel. Haley recovers her speech and confesses her love for Elan, who reciprocates. The Order returns to Azure City to ask Lord Shojo for further directions. Miko, who does not know about the plan to find the gates but does know about Xykon's army, overhears the conversation and jumps to the conclusion that both are in league with Xykon. She strikes her master down, and is immediately stripped of her paladin status by her gods and imprisoned. Xykon's hobgoblins attack the city the next day. The Order helps Shojo's heir, Hinjo, hold the city walls. Xykon attempts to circumvent the defenders, but Roy leaps up to the [[Zombie (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|zombified]] dragon that Xykon is riding, and the two duel once more. Xykon overpowers Roy and sends him falling to his death. Xykon and Redcloak attempt to activate the gate hidden within the castle's throne room, but Miko, having escaped from prison, destroys the gate in an attempt to protect it. In the ensuing explosion, Miko is killed, and Xykon and Redcloak escape. The city falls to the hobgoblins. Haley and Belkar become separated from the party when they go to recover Roy's corpse, while the others sail away with Hinjo and the surviving Azurites.&lt;ref name=WAXPTotal&gt;Burlew, ''War and XPs''.&lt;/ref&gt; The printed book contains strips 302–484, plus extras.

===''Don't Split the Party''===
Roy finds himself in the Afterlife with his father, who cannot rest until Xykon is gone. Roy is found worthy of entrance to paradise, but he returns to his father's side when he learns that almost four months have passed. Looking down, he sees that Haley and Belkar have formed an underground resistance movement in hobgoblin-occupied Azure City. Haley accidentally summons Celia, who convinces her to look for the other half of the party. Their travels take them to Greysky City, where Haley is betrayed by one of her old friends in the Thieves' Guild, but the Order triumphs over the Guild in the ensuing battle. Meanwhile, Elan, Durkon, and Vaarsuvius stop the nobleman Kubota's plot to assassinate Hinjo, and Vaarsuvius kills Kubota after capturing him. Vaarsuvius then flies to an isolated island to search for Haley, where Vaarsuvius is attacked and defeated by the mother of the black dragon whom Vaarsuvius had killed during ''No Cure for the Paladin Blues''. After the dragon threatens to kill Vaarsuvius' children, Vaarsuvius contracts with fiends to rent out the souls of three evil spellcasters. Vaarsuvius then kills the black dragon and her entire lineage by "renting" an epic ''Familicide'' spell. Loath to waste this increased arcane power, Vaarsuvius teleports to Azure City to defeat Xykon, but is knocked out, during the battle, and loses control of the souls. Witnessing this, the paladin O-Chul escapes from prison and attempts to destroy Xykon's phylactery, but it falls into a storm drain and is lost. Vaarsuvius and O-Chul are teleported to Hinjo's fleet by Xykon's monster in the darkness, which O-Chul had befriended during his imprisonment. There, the Order regroups and Durkon resurrects Roy. The story arc ends with the Order sailing towards the next gate and Vaarsuvius apologizing to the neglected [[Familiar (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|familiar]] Blackwing, who tells Vaarsuvius that it saw what appeared to be another world in the rift in space caused by the Snarl. The printed book contains strips 485–672, plus extras.

===''Blood Runs in the Family''===
While O-Chul and Lien travel north to Kraagor's gate, the Order sails to the Western Continent. Their search for Girard's Gate takes them to the Empire of Blood, where Tarquin, the Empress's chief general (and the true power behind the throne), dramatically reveals himself to be Elan's father. Tarquin gives the Order a tip that Girard's relative Orrin Draketooth can be found in Windy Canyon. However, Tarquin and the Linear Guild join forces and plot to seize the gate for themselves.

Meanwhile, in Azure City, Redcloak's troops recover Xykon's phylactery and destroy the resistance's base. Redcloak, who is plotting against Xykon, gives him a fake phylactery and keeps the real one for himself.

The Order discovers a magically cloaked [[pyramid]] in Windy Canyon, but once inside finds the entire Draketooth clan dead — an unexpected result of Vaarsuvius's ''Familicide'' spell, which causes him/her to flee into the pyramid in horror. The Linear Guild arrives shortly after in hot pursuit. Belkar, Durkon, and Tarquin become separated from their respective groups in the ensuing battle. Belkar and Durkon encounter Tarquin's cleric Malack, who kills Durkon, turning him into a vampire [[thrall]]. Belkar reunites with the Order and they continue deeper into the pyramid, overcoming various traps and illusions along the way. When they discover the gate, Roy decides to destroy it, and consequently the entire pyramid, rather than risk it falling into the hands of Evil. Again the Order sees what appears to be another world in the rift.

With Tarquin gone, Nale takes the opportunity to kill Malack, freeing Durkon who rejoins the Order. Tarquin kills Nale for disobedience upon returning and sends a vast army to attack the Order. With the help of Vaarsuvius (who was temporarily dragged into hell by the archfiends so that s/he could not prevent the Order from destroying the Gate), and Julio Scoundrel swooping in at the last moment, the Order is triumphant. Tarquin is left in the middle of the desert as the Order flies away on Julio's airship towards the last Gate.

The final strip reveals that the Northern Death God, Hel, has placed a spirit in the vampirized body of Durkon, and plans for the spirit to bring ruin to the Dwarven lands as Durkon helplessly struggles trapped in his own body. The printed book contains strips 673–946, plus extras.

===Sixth book===
Julio's airship gets damaged in a storm, and the Order stop in the [[steampunk]]-inspired gnome town of Tinkertown to repair it. Haley deals with her old enemies, while Roy and Durkon search for a cleric who can cure Durkon's vampirism. They encounter Veldrina and Wrecan,&lt;ref&gt;a Kickstarter backer's creation and a tribute to one of the moderators on Giant in the Playground's message boards, respectively&lt;/ref&gt; who are traveling to the Godsmoot, an interfaith council of clerics. The Order flies the pair to the Godsmoot with the goal of restoring Durkon to life.

At the Godsmoot, they discover that due to the threat of the Snarl, the gods are casting votes (conveyed through their mortal representatives) on whether to destroy the world and start over. Durkon, revealed to be the High Priest of Hel, votes in favor of the destruction, causing a tie. With the swing votes of demigod priests potentially dooming the world, Roy tries to eliminate the High Priest of Hel to negate the vote. They fight to a stand still and the demigod priests vote and also cause a tie – with the priest of Dvalin needing to consult with the Dwarven Council before he can cast a vote. It is then revealed that Durkon has killed and vampirized all the members of the Creed of Stone, who walk into the room. Durkon abdicates his position as High Priest and hands it over to one of the newly formed vampires as he and a few other vampires teleport to the dwarven lands to dominate the dwarven council so they will vote in Hel's favor. Roy regroups with his team and they fly to a dwarven city named Firmament.

After defeating a tribe of giants, the Order gets to the city, where they gain allies (among them Hilgya Firehelm, accompanied by her and Durkon's infant son) and fight newly vampirised dwarves. The Order takes the fight to the High Priest and his vampire minions, but, although they initially prevail, the vampires manage to hypnotize most of the Order, breaking their plans and leaving all of them unconscious. However, in the meantime Durkon (who, throughout the book, has been forced to show the High Priest his memories) tricks the High Priest into absorbing the rest of his memories all at once, effectively turning him into a copy of Durkon, for a time long enough to get their body destroyed by Belkar. Durkon's soul ascends to the afterlife, where he encounters Thor, who reveals information about the nature and history of the Snarl, the Gods and their creations.

==Fictional world==
The world the characters inhabit is similar to those depicted in ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'', complete with functional magic and monsters. According to an introductory strip included in ''Dungeon Crawlin' Fools'', the world operates under three sets of laws: Physics, Magic, and Gaming (specifically, paper-and-pencil roleplaying games).&lt;ref name="DCFp8" group=n&gt;Burlew, ''Dungeon Crawlin' Fools', p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Though ostensibly medieval in nature, the ''OOTS'' world is rife with [[anachronism]]s, both social (such as college admissions standards for the Evil [[Ivy League]]&lt;ref name=oots0100 group=n&gt;{{cite journal |author=Burlew, Rich | authorlink = Rich Burlew |title=Teenage Boys Are CR 1 |url=http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0100.html |journal=The Order of the Stick |year=2004 |issue=#100 |publisher=GiantITP.com |accessdate=2008-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and technological (such as coffee makers&lt;ref name=oots0317 group=n&gt;{{cite journal |author=Burlew, Rich | authorlink = Rich Burlew |title=The Best Part of Waking Up |url=http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0317.html |journal=The Order of the Stick |year=2006 |issue=#317 |publisher=GiantITP.com |accessdate=2008-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The characters make references to real-life individuals ([[Michael Jackson]]&lt;ref name=oots0413 group=n&gt;{{cite journal |author=Burlew, Rich | authorlink = Rich Burlew |title=Not to Scale |url=http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0413.html |journal=The Order of the Stick |year=2007 |issue=#413 |publisher=GiantITP.com |accessdate=2008-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Jessica Biel]]&lt;ref name=oots0606 group=n&gt;{{cite journal |author=Burlew, Rich | authorlink = Rich Burlew |title=The Philosophy of Chaos |url=http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0606.html |journal=The Order of the Stick |year=2008 |issue=#606 |publisher=GiantITP.com |accessdate=2008-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;), fictional characters from other sources ([[Green Lantern]] and [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]]),&lt;ref name=oots0359 group=n&gt;{{cite journal |author=Burlew, Rich | authorlink = Rich Burlew |title=Roll Over |url=http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0359.html |journal=The Order of the Stick |year=2006 |issue=#359 |publisher=GiantITP.com |accessdate=2008-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[pop culture]] in general. Sometimes, fictional characters (or explicit "third-rate knock-offs" thereof) from other fantasy works cross paths with the main characters, such as the halfling "[[Frodo Baggins|Frudu Biggins]]".&lt;ref name="DCFp8" group=n/&gt;&lt;ref name=oots0415 group=n&gt;{{cite journal |author=Burlew, Rich | authorlink = Rich Burlew |title=Idiot Box |url=http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0415.html |journal=The Order of the Stick |year=2007 |issue=#415 |publisher=GiantITP.com |accessdate=2008-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geography===
Three main areas of the world's geography have been mentioned: a mainland continent consisting of the Northern Lands and the Southern Lands,&lt;ref name=oots0204 group=n&gt;{{cite journal |author=Burlew, Rich | authorlink = Rich Burlew |title=What's My Motivation? |url=http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0204.html |journal=The Order of the Stick |year=2005 |issue=#204 |publisher=GiantITP.com |accessdate=2008-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the separate Western Continent.&lt;ref name=OTOPCp11 group=n&gt;Burlew, ''On the Origin of PCs'', p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; The Northern Lands seem to consist mostly of grassy plains and mountains, which resemble medieval Europe in setting, but with a wider variety of skin colors than was present in medieval Europe.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} For example, [[Roy Greenhilt]] and his family have dark brown skin, and are not referred to as coming from a different area or having a different cultural background than the characters with light skin. Other characters, such as the lawyer Phil Rodriguez, show a third (light brown) skin color. Non-human races, which are often player characters in ''D&amp;D'', such as dwarves and gnomes, have both dark- and light-skinned members as well.

Most of the seen Southern Lands seem to be mountainous, rocky and barren, though what seems to be a more tropical forested nation and a colder region have briefly been seen. The people of the Southern Lands are significantly different ethnically and culturally, with nations roughly analogous to real-world Asian cultures such as China and India, the most prominent of which was Azure City, which greatly resembled feudal Japan (though a few Chinese elements were present). Four separate areas in the South besides Azure city are briefly shown.&lt;ref name=oots0501 group=n&gt;{{cite journal |author=Burlew, Rich | authorlink = Rich Burlew |title=No Cure for the Wedding Bell Blues |url=http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0501.html |journal=The Order of the Stick |issue=#501 |publisher=GiantITP.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Western Continent is split into an Elven forest in the north and an expansive desert in the south, separated from each other by the ''Goaway Mountains''. Due to the continent's fragile political state, a large number of nations cluster around the edges of the desert. The Western Continent includes Vaarsuvius's homeland, and is close to an island with abandoned Elven ruins, where the Azurite fleet landed.

===Religion===
There are three primary polytheistic pantheons worshiped by humans, all based on real-life mythology: the Northern Pantheon ([[Norse deities]] led by [[Odin]]), the Southern Pantheon (the Twelve Gods of the [[Chinese zodiac]]), and the Western Pantheon ([[List of Mesopotamian deities|Mesopotamian deities]] like [[Nergal]] and [[Tiamat]]). Dwarves worship the Northern Pantheon. Lizardfolk worship the Western Pantheon. Elves have their own gods separate from the main pantheons.

There once was a fourth primary pantheon, the Eastern Pantheon, based on the [[Greek pantheon]] led by [[Zeus]]. These deities were killed by the Snarl and so had no role in the re-creation of the world; only people who are privy to the story of the Snarl have ever even heard of them.

Each pantheon has a deific color: yellow for the North, red for the West, blue for the South (whence "[[Azure (color)|Azure]]" City), and green for the East.

===Afterlife===
Like most of the worlds of ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'', the ''Order of the Stick'' universe contains a verifiable [[afterlife]]—a series of [[Plane (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|planes]] to which dead souls are drawn. The afterlife in the ''OOTS'' world resembles the [[Outer plane|Great Wheel]] cosmology, with separate planes for the departed of each [[Alignment (role-playing games)|alignment]].&lt;ref name=oots0445 group=n&gt;{{cite journal |author=Burlew, Rich | authorlink = Rich Burlew |title=A Song for the Departed |url=http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0445.html |journal=The Order of the Stick |year=2007 |issue=#445 |publisher=GiantITP.com |accessdate=2008-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; To enter the afterlife, a planar being must assess whether or not a soul has fulfilled the tenets of their alignment throughout their life.&lt;ref name=oots0487 group=n&gt;{{cite journal |author=Burlew, Rich | authorlink = Rich Burlew |title=Their Concierge Service is Heavenly |url=http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0487.html |journal=The Order of the Stick |year=2007 |issue=#487 |publisher=GiantITP.com |accessdate=2008-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Dwarves might be exempt from this rule, as those who do not die honorably in battle (or from liver failure due to alcohol poisoning) are sent to the plane of Hel upon death, regardless of alignment.

The Lawful Good afterlife plane has been portrayed in the comic as a mountain with seven plateaus loosely based on [[Mount Celestia]], and the side of the mountain the deceased enter from in depends on their religion. The first plateau is dedicated to satisfying physical desires, such as for sex and food, while higher levels offer spiritual satisfaction. The seventh level, at the mountain's peak, holds “true perfect enlightenment.”&lt;ref name=oots0493 group=n&gt;{{cite journal |author=Burlew, Rich | authorlink = Rich Burlew |title=Led Zeppelin Lied to Us All |url=http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0493.html |journal=The Order of the Stick |year=2007 |issue=#493 |publisher=GiantITP.com |accessdate=2008-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Below the mountain is a demi plane of blue skies and clouds, where dead souls, archons, and gods from all of the Good-aligned planes can look down on the mortal world.&lt;ref name=oots0486 group=n&gt;{{cite journal | last=Burlew | first=Rich | authorlink=Rich Burlew | url=http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0486.html | journal=The Order of the Stick | year=2007 | issue=#486 | accessdate=2008-10-05 | publisher=GiantITP.com | title=Next on "As the Plane Turns"..}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commentary on role-playing games==
Much of the humor of ''The Order of the Stick'' is based on roleplaying games (particularly the [[Editions of Dungeons &amp; Dragons|''Dungeons and Dragons'' 3rd Edition]] ruleset), with characters freely discussing [[game mechanics]], such as experience points, skill sets, and random encounters.&lt;ref name="comixtalk" /&gt; The characters know very well that they live in a world controlled by the rules of roleplaying games, but attempt to function normally within it, often with nonsensical results.&lt;ref name="comixtalk" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ComicBuyersGuide" /&gt; Characters have been shown browsing through rulebooks for the ''D&amp;D'' game to select a certain monster for use,&lt;ref name=oots0431 group=n&gt;{{cite journal |author=Burlew, Rich | authorlink = Rich Burlew |title=The Three Xykons |url=http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0431.html |journal=The Order of the Stick |year=2007 |issue=#431 |publisher=GiantITP.com |accessdate=2008-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; or to learn about a new class.&lt;ref name=oots0390 group=n&gt;{{cite journal |author=Burlew, Rich | authorlink = Rich Burlew |title=In a Class All His Own |url=http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0390.html |journal=The Order of the Stick |year=2006 |issue=#390 |publisher=GiantITP.com |accessdate=2008-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common techniques of players and Dungeon Masters are spoofed, such as the weather of the campaign world changing to herald a dramatic encounter,&lt;ref name="burns199" /&gt; or a player who does not bother to complete the details of his character's backstory.&lt;ref name=OTOPCp4&gt;Burlew, ''On the Origin of PCs'', Introduction, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Burlew's satirical humor addresses many of the clichés of the fantasy genre as a whole, often by twisting them in new and different ways.&lt;ref name="Rothfuss"&gt;[[Patrick Rothfuss|Rothfuss, Patrick]]. Foreword to ''War and XPs''. p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Burlew occasionally creates characters and situations specifically to highlight what he considers common problems and deficits among roleplayers. The controversial paladin Miko Miyazaki is one such character; Burlew has said that she represents the division among players of the game over whether or not one character should be allowed to "police" the remainder of an adventuring party.&lt;ref name=NCPBp106&gt;Burlew, ''No Cure for the Paladin Blues'', Author Commentary, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; He has referred to her as being "one of the WORST ways to play a paladin."&lt;ref name=NCPBp108&gt;Burlew, ''No Cure for the Paladin Blues'', Author Commentary, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is the creation myth of the ''OOTS'' world, which shows a group of gods bickering over how to create the world—accidentally creating the world-devouring Snarl through their refusal to compromise. In the commentary for ''No Cure for the Paladin Blues'', Burlew likens this story to the squabbles that might arise in a group of roleplayers, which threaten to destroy the fun that they have created together.&lt;ref name=NCPBp180&gt;Burlew, ''No Cure for the Paladin Blues'', Author Commentary, p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt;

The comic occasionally directly comments on current events in the roleplaying game industry by the inclusion of characters that represent the participants. In the last three comics to appear in ''Dragon'', the ''OOTS'' members encounter a green dragon that serves as a self-identified allegorical figure for the magazine itself.&lt;ref name=Dragon357&gt;{{cite journal | last = Burlew | first = Rich | authorlink = Rich Burlew |date=July 2007 | title = The Order of the Stick: Stop Dragon My Art Around | journal = Dragon | issue = 357 | publisher = [[Paizo Publishing|Paizo Publishing, LLC]].}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dragon recounts the magazine's long history, complete with representations of its various publishers, including a [[Wizards of the Coast|wizard of the coast]] and [[Mr. Potato Head]] (the signature toy of Wizards of the Coast's corporate parent, [[Hasbro]]).&lt;ref name=Dragon358&gt;{{cite journal | last = Burlew | first = Rich | authorlink = Rich Burlew |date=August 2007 | title = The Order of the Stick: Claw/Claw/Bite the Hand That Feeds Me | journal = Dragon | issue = 358 | publisher = [[Paizo Publishing|Paizo Publishing, LLC]].}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the final issue, the dragon escapes the wizard of the coast's lawyers by flying through a room featuring characters from many of the comics that have appeared in ''Dragon'' over the years, such as ''[[David A. Trampier|Wormy]]'', ''[[Knights of the Dinner Table]]'', and ''[[What's New with Phil &amp; Dixie]]'', before the ''OOTS'' characters directly thank the dragon for its long years of service. This theme was employed again when a character in the online strip voiced Burlew's eulogy to ''D&amp;D'' co-creator [[Gary Gygax]] immediately after his death was announced.&lt;ref name=oots0536&gt;{{cite journal|author=Burlew, Rich |authorlink=Rich Burlew |title=A Brief Tribute |url=http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0536.html |journal=The Order of the Stick |year=2008 |issue=#536 |publisher=GiantITP.com |accessdate=2008-04-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.giantitp.com%2Fcomics%2Foots0536.html&amp;date=2008-10-04 |archivedate=2008-10-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="News3/4/2008"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.giantitp.com/index.html#AmQKTxMeXozCUZHVw0L |title=In Memorium: E.

===Awards and recognition===
''The Order of the Stick'' received two nominations for Britain's 2008 [[Eagle Awards]], for Favourite Web-Based Comic and Favourite Original Graphic Novel (for ''Start of Darkness''). ''OOTS'' won the former category, but lost the latter one to [[Alan Moore]]'s ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: Black Dossier]]''.&lt;ref name=EaglesResults&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eagleawards.co.uk/ |title=Eagle Awards |accessdate=2008-06-25 |year=2008 |work=The Eagle Awards |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120620041513/http://www.eagleawards.co.uk/ |archivedate=2012-06-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In announcing the results on his site, Burlew stated he was pleased that he didn't win the Favourite Original Graphic Novel category, saying, "I don't think I want to live in a world where a parody stick figure comic beats one of the comic industry's top writers."&lt;ref name=1-for-2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.giantitp.com/index.html#x5hwuKt9CaScNIim6bY |title=OOTS Goes 1-for-2 at Eagles |accessdate=2008-06-25|work=Giant in the Playground Games}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''No Cure for the Paladin Blues'', the comic's second print compilation, won a 2007 Gold [[ENnies|ENnie]] award.&lt;ref name=ENnies2007&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ennieawards.com/2007-archive.html |title=2007 ENnie Awards Archives |accessdate=2008-04-22 |date=2007-09-09 |work=The ENnies |publisher=ENWorld |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080418085208/http://www.ennieawards.com/2007-archive.html |archivedate=2008-04-18 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''OOTS'' has been nominated for ten [[Web Cartoonist's Choice Awards]], of which it has won five.

''The Order of the Stick'' books are published by Giant in the Playground Games, a small press publishing company formed by ''OOTS'' creator Rich Burlew. The books are widely distributed to online and brick-and-mortar retailers in the hobby game market,&lt;ref&gt;Greater Games Industry Catalog, Fall 2007, page 151.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AllianceListing&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alliance-games.com/publicaccess/results.asp?SearchArg=Giant+in+the+Playground+Games&amp;list=By_Company |title=Company Listing for Giant in the Playground |accessdate=2008-04-22 |work=Alliance Game Disrtibutors Online Catalog |publisher=Alliance Game Distribution |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410194303/http://www.alliance-games.com/publicaccess/results.asp?SearchArg=Giant+in+the+Playground+Games&amp;list=By_Company |archivedate=2008-04-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as to comic book direct retailers. All four books feature an introduction by the author, as well as a preface written in the voice of one of the characters from the strip. The compilation books feature a number of pages of "bonus material", primarily additional strips inserted into various points in the story. The bonus material for ''Dungeon Crawlin' Fools'', for example, includes a nine-page opening to the story that Burlew felt introduced the characters in a more organic way than the online comic's cast page.&lt;ref name=DCFp5 /&gt;

==Board game==
[[File:OOTSGame.gif|thumb|left|Box cover for ''The Order of the Stick Adventure Game''.]]In partnership with APE Games, Giant in the Playground released the first ''OOTS'' game, ''The Order of the Stick Adventure Game: The Dungeon of Dorukan''. The game, which was released in September 2006, utilizes cards and a board, and has strong influences from games such as ''[[Talisman (board game)|Talisman]]'' and ''[[Dungeon!]]'', as well as the less-known "Kings &amp; Things".

''The Dungeon of Dorukan'' is designed for 2–6 people, aged twelve and older. Each player controls one member of the OOTS team to explore the dungeon and hunt down Xykon. The player is able to train their chosen member with a variety of [[shtick]] cards. Each character provides a different gaming experience, and the players have the ability to either aid or harm their teammates.

The game has received two expansion sets. The first one, ''The Shortening'', released in 2011 by APE Games,&lt;ref&gt;[http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/39888/order-of-the-stick-adventure-game-the-shortening Order of the Stick Adventure Game: The Shortening (2011)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.giantitp.com/index.html#K4JA4lKvgw4fHxnSh9U GiantITP.com News 3/14/2011]&lt;/ref&gt; included new cards and rules to reduce the duration of the game. The second 20 card mini-expansion, ''Sticky Shticks'', was announced as a pledge reward for the 2012 "reprint drive" Kickstarter campaign.&lt;ref name="Kickstarter19"&gt;[http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/599092525/the-order-of-the-stick-reprint-drive/posts/174377 Updates]: Update #19: The Game and More&lt;/ref&gt; It features cards that can be stuck to characters giving them some penalties.

A second, stand-alone game, '''The Order of the Stick Adventure Game: The Linear Guild''', was set to be released by APE Games in the Fall of 2008,&lt;ref name="GTS" /&gt; but has not been released. Players would be able to take on the parts of Nale, Thog, Sabine, and other members of the [[Linear Guild]] in their own dungeon adventure, or they can combine the materials in the game with those from the Dungeon of Dorukan set for a massive Order of the Stick vs. Linear Guild head-to-head adventure.

'''''The Prisoner of the Caucasus''''' ({{lang-ru|«Кавказский пленник»}} ''Kavkázskiy plénnik''), also translated as '''''Captive of the Caucasus''''', is a [[narrative poetry|narrative poem]] written by [[Alexander Pushkin]] in 1820-21  and published in 1822.  Dedicated to his friend General [[Nikolay Raevsky]], it was inspired by the poet's time spent in [[Pyatigorsk]] during his southern exile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Layton|first=Susan|title=Russian Literature and Empire: Conquest of the Caucasus from Pushkin to Tolstoy|location=Cambridge|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1995|page=26|isbn=978-0521444439}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The poem is about a [[Byronic hero|Byronic]] Russian officer who is disillusioned with elite life and decides to escape by seeking adventure in the [[Caucasus]].  He is captured by [[Circassians|Circassian]] tribesmen but then saved by a [[Circassian beauties|beautiful Circassian woman]].  Despite its [[Romanticism|Romantic]] and [[Orientalism|Orientalist]] themes, Pushkin's use of academic footnotes and reliable ethnographic material gave it credibility in its day.&lt;ref&gt;Layton, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;  It was highly influential on popular perceptions of the Caucasus for its time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=King|first=Charles|authorlink=Charles King (professor of international affairs)|title=The Ghost of Freedom: A History of the Caucasus|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0195177756|pages=110-112}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The poem remains one of Pushkin's most famous works and is often referenced in [[Russian culture|Russian popular culture]], in films such as the Soviet comedy ''[[Kidnapping, Caucasian Style]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Russian Film: 'Кавказская Пленница' – 'Kidnapping, Caucasian Style'|url=http://ruslanguage.ru/blog/russian-film-%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%B7%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%8F-%D0%BF%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%86%D0%B0-kidnapping-caucasian-style/|work=Ruslanguage School|accessdate=15 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tong2ji1.jpg|thumb|[[Chinese characters]] for ''tongji'']]
'''Tongji''' ({{zh|c=童乩|p=''tóngjī''|w=''t'ung-chi''|l=youth diviner}}; [[Taiwanese Romanization System|Tâi-lô]]: tâng-ki) or '''Jitong''' ({{zh|c=乩童|p=''jītóng''|w=''chi-t'ung''|l=divining youth}}) is a [[Chinese folk religion|Chinese folk]] religious specialist, usually translated as a "[[spirit medium]]", "[[oracle]]", or "[[shaman]]".

This word compounds ''tong'' [[Wikt:童|童]] "child; youth; boy servant" and ''ji'' [[Wikt:乩|乩]] "to divine" (cf. ''[[Fuji (planchette writing)|fuji]]'' 扶乩 "divination; planchette writing"). Regional variants include [[Hokkien]] ''tâng-ki'' 童乩 and [[Canton dialect|Cantonese]] ''gei-tung'' 乩童 or ''san-daa'' 神打.  

A ''tongji'' or ''jitong'' is a person believed to have been chosen by a particular ''[[shen (Chinese religion)|shen]]'' 神 "god; spirit" as the earthly vehicle for divine expression. The Chinese differentiate a ''[[wu (shaman)|wu]]''  巫 "shaman; healer; spirit medium" who gains control of forces in the spirit world versus a ''tongji'' who appears to be entirely under the control of forces in the spirit world.

Frequently a person who will become a ''tongji'' to experiences a feeling of compulsion of something that will possess them. The person may attempt to resist that compulsion, but should their resistance fail, they will enter into a [[altered state of consciousness|trance]] in which they  may beat themselves with a nail-studded ball at the end of a cord and handle to the point that he draws blood from multiple wounds on his back. While in this trance state the ''tongji'' is believed to be possessed by a ''shen''.

The '''Wynwood Art District''' is a district of the [[Wynwood]] neighborhood of [[Miami]], [[Florida]]. It is home to over 70 galleries, museums and collections.  It is roughly bounded by North 36th Street ([[U.S. Route 27 in Florida|US 27]]) (north)&lt;!--East of [[Miami Avenue]], it's "NE" and "NW" west of it--&gt;, North 20th Street (south)&lt;!--East of [[Miami Avenue]], it's "NE" and "NW" west of it--&gt;, [[Interstate 95 in Florida|I-95]] (west) and Northeast First Avenue (east). It is one of the largest open-air street art installations in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wynwoodmiami.com/about.php |title=Wynwood Miami |publisher=Wynwood Miami |date= |accessdate=2015-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
[[File:FC preserved.jpg|thumb|Letters of "war" spray painted over space picture and oversprayed with "FC preserved"]]
The Wynwood Art District Association was founded in early 2003 by a group of art dealers, artists and curators Mark Coetzee, Nina Arias and Nick Cindric. Mark Coetzee initiated the idea based on a similar project, Art Night, which he started in his hometown, Cape Town, South Africa. Founding members at the first meeting in Rocket Projects media room were Brook Dorsch of Dorsch Gallery, Weston Charles, [[COOPER (artist)|Cooper]] and [[Elizabeth Withstandley]] of [[Locust Projects]], Mark Coetzee of the Rubell Collection, Nina Arias and Nick Cindric of Rocket Projects, Bernice Steinbaum of Bernice Steinbaum Gallery, and Marina Kessler of Marina Kessler Gallery. The association created the Second Saturdays Gallery Walk, designed the Manhole cover logo along with the light banners that hang on street corners, and publishes annual brochures with a map and a list of the association's members. 

It was once home to over 70 galleries, five museums, three collections, seven art complexes, 12 art studios, five art fairs and the Wynwood Walls. Gentrification and rising rent prices have pushed out most of the smaller galleries. In 2018, less than ten galleries remain.

The Wynwood Walls were created in 2009 by the late Tony Goldman in an effort to develop the area's pedestrian potential. Goldman bought his first building in [[Wynwood]] in 2004, and owned nearly two dozen properties by 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Caplan |first1=Benjy |title=Paint The Walls |url=http://features.miaminewtimes.com/wynwood-street-art/ |accessdate=29 July 2018 |publisher=Miami New Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artists from around the world have contributed to the Wynwood Walls. The Walls have been covered by media such as the ''New York Times'' and the BBC bringing international attention to the destination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Alvarez |first1=Lizette |title=Breathing Life, and Art, Into a Downtrodden Neighborhood |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/09/us/wynwood-in-miami-getting-a-new-life-and-art.html |accessdate=29 July 2018 |publisher=The New York Times |date=8 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also featured in the docu-series entitled ''Here Comes the Neighborhood''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Furst |first1=Jenner |title=Here Comes the Neighborhood |url=https://vimeo.com/herecomestheneighborhood |website=Vimeo.com |publisher=Cinemart in Association With Goldman Properties |accessdate=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Walls have expanded to include murals outside the neighborhood, including Outside the Walls which features art covering entire buildings. In 2010, Goldman added the Wynwood Doors to highlight smaller artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wynwood Miami |title=Wynwood Doors |url=https://wynwoodmiami.com/street_art/wynwood-doors/ |website=WynwoodMiami.com |accessdate=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Curbed]]'' listed Wynwood Walls as among the 16 most Instagrammable places in US cities in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Barber |first1=Megan |title=The 16 most Instagrammable places in U.S. cities |url=https://www.curbed.com/2018/7/18/17585406/best-instagram-places-photo-spots |accessdate=29 July 2018 |publisher=Curbed |date=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every second Saturday of each month, a community-wide art walk is held. Galleries, art studios, alternative spaces and showrooms open their doors to the public for art, music and refreshments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wynwood Miami |title=Art Walk |url=https://wynwoodmiami.com/experience/art-walk/ |website=WynwoodMiami.com |accessdate=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
