In the mid 1990s, the Al-Kafaàt Foundation set-up the Al-Kafaàt Institution of Higher Education which obtained the Ministry of Higher Education's approval in 1999.

The '''California Supplemental Examination''' is a [[Professional licensure in the United States|professional licensure exam]] established and regulated by yhe California Architects Board. In order to become a licensed [[architect]] in the [[State of California]], a candidate must pass this exam in addition to passing the required national architect registration exams, and completing all other requirements. The exam was previously delivered in an oral format, but around 2010 it was converted to be a computer-delivered, multiple-choice examination.

The exam is administered through a vendor, by permission of the California Architects Board. Upon completion of the [[Intern Development Program]] and successful completion of the [[Architect Registration Examination]], a candidate is then permitted to sit for the California Supplemental Exam. The test plan is organized into four separate topics covering a variety of specific aspects of architectural Practice.

==Exam procedure ==
The exam was previously a structured oral examination that lasted approximately 1.5 hours. It was administered by a panel of three architects with current California registration.  A question was asked to the candidate, with no further clarification of the question allowed.  The candidate was to give an answer that is scored by each member of the panel independently.  The number of questions was approximately thirty.

Candidates were given the opportunity to demonstrate through oral responses their overall understanding of architectural practice, and required to demonstrate at least entry-level competence in the areas outlined in the CSE test plan. A competent entry-level architect is able to discharge the responsibilities incumbent upon him or her in providing professional architectural services to the public. Additionally, a competent entry-level architect must understand the integration of architectural practice and the architect's responsibilities as they relate to architectural practice in California.

The exam is based on a hypothetical project and includes graphic and written documents that candidates have the opportunity to review prior to - and have access to during - the CSE. The project description and graphics provide a focus for the examination questions and establish a context for candidate responses.

The oral format was phased out in 2010, and the exam is now in a timed computer-delivered multiple choice format.

==Test plan==

The test plan has not changed since the format of the test moved from oral to multiple choice on a computer, and is based on the results of a statewide survey of practicing California architects. The intent of the test plan is not to duplicate coverage of general areas of practice already addressed by the national test, the Architectural Registration Examination, but to focus on California-specific aspects of practice; it is therefore neither comprehensive nor representative of the full scope of architectural practice.

The exam administered in 2009-2010 was based on a test plan that is divided into four categories of architectural knowledge and abilities important to the tasks that California architects perform, as follows:
{{update section|date=December 2018}}
:1.  Context and pre-design
:2.  Regulatory
::      a. California state laws, code, regulations, and standards
::      b. Other laws, codes, regulations, standards, agencies and entitlements
:3.  Management and design
:4.  Construction

The board has a list of reference materials for the 2009-2010 administrations which can assist candidates in preparing for the exam. The list details the resources with which to be familiar and how they may be obtained. Some of the materials are available for a nominal cost, and others for free.

The '''Charter of Grenoble''' is a founding document of the movement of [[Students' Union|student unionism]]. It was written by the [[Union nationale des étudiants de France|National Union of Students]] of [[France]], at the Congress of Grenoble in 1946.

== Text of the charter ==

'''Preamble'''

Representatives of the French students, legally brought together with the national Congress in Grenoble on April 24, 1946, conscious of the historical value of the time;

-Where the French Union works out the new declaration of the rights of man and of the Citizen

-Where is built the peaceful Statute of the Nations

-Where the world of work and youth releases the bases of an economic and social revolution to the service of the man

-Affirm their will to take part in the unanimous effort of rebuilding,

-Faithful to the traditional objectives by youth French coed when it was with the highest conscience of its mission,

-Faithful to the example of best of them, died in the fight of the French people for his freedom

-Noting the out-of-date character of the institutions which govern them

-State to want to place itself, as they did so often during our History, with the avant-garde of French youth, while defining as bases of their tasks and their claims the following principles:

Article 1: The student is a young intellectual worker.

Rights and duties of the student as a young person:

Article 2: As a young person the student has right to a particular social welfare, in the fields physique, intellectual and moral.

Article 3: As a young person the student has the duty to be integrated into the whole of world youth.

Rights and duties of the student as a worker:

Article 4: As a worker, the student has right to work and rest under the best conditions and material independence, as well personal as social, guaranteed by the free exercise of the trade-union rights.

Article 5: As a worker, the student has the duty to acquire the best technical skill.

Rights and duties of the student as an intellectual:

Article 6: As an intellectual, the student has the right to research of the truth and the freedom which is the condition first.

Article 7: As an intellectual, the student has the duty:To define, propagate and defend the truth, which implies the duty to make divide and progress the culture and to release the direction of the History. To defend freedom any oppression counters, which, for the intellectual, constitutes the most crowned mission.

'''Cognitive Emotional Pedagogy''' (CEP) is a method of teaching and learning based on cognitive psychology and [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivist learning theory]] which claims that construction and retention of new concepts and skills is most effective if the learning content is associated with creativity and emotionally distinct experiences. The theoretical framework was created by Joni Mäkivirta.

== Theoretical Framework ==
* Conceptual extension happens when new concepts are so closely linked to the existing knowledge that the overall conceptual structure and logical connections can be retained. Conceptual extension is associated with linear logical processes.
* Conceptual rearrangement happens when new concepts are sufficiently dissimilar in terms ‘shape’ and ‘behavior’ to the existing concepts that their assimilation requires existing knowledge to be rearranged. Conceptual rearrangement is associated with lateral logical processes.
* Paradigmatic structuring happens when new concepts are so dissimilar in terms of ‘shape’ and ‘behavior’ to the existing knowledge that their assimilation to existing knowledge fails. The acquisition of new concepts is possible only if the conceptual map is rebuilt. Paradigmatic structuring is associated with creative theorizing that challenges existing assumptions.

Mäkivirta claims that traditional education is creativity-deprived because it focuses on conceptual extension and rearrangement, but not on paradigmatic structuring, even though the latter has been responsible for paradigm shifts that have created the greatest progress in human knowledge.

According to the theory all three types of learning happen at all ages, but the greatest amount of paradigmatic structuring takes place in the early childhood. Traditional schooling is criticized for destroying the ability to learn paradigmatically by conditioning students to believe that the teacher is the only source of reliable knowledge and using assessment as a 'cognitive control tool'. This practice is particularly detrimental if assessment tasks are inappropriate for the students' level of cognitive maturity.

According to Mäkivirta the 'fact fetish' and the overemphasis of mathematical and linguistic operations at expense of emotional engagement and concept discovery lead to deprived and biased thinking and prevent development of fully functioning intellect.

Mäkivirta suggests that more effective and transformative learning can be achieved if the learning content is delivered using Cognitive Emotional Pedagogy (CEP) that combines creative emotional experiences with learning tasks. To create a learning environment that supports CEP, schools should align their pedagogical practices and learning cultures with the principles of CEP.

=== Principles of CEP ===
* Teachers are concept assimilation and creativity facilitators
* Learners are knowledge creators
* Pedagogy should support knowledge creation by fostering conceptual manipulation skills, providing relevant emotional experiences and promoting sharing of created knowledge
* Curriculum should be based on assimilation of concepts and logical operations typical of various ‘areas of knowledge’ and provide learner-specific educational plans
* Assessment should be based on expressed guidelines and should credit concept creation, creativity, emotional expression and conceptual manipulation skills
* Self-evaluation should be used to create meta-cognition regarding aspects of learning process
* Learning culture should be defined by positivity, openness and tolerance for ambiguity

=== Teacher Training ===
Teacher training based on CEP principles is available by some educational consultancies. Teacher training focuses on topics such as rediscovering creativity; constructive verbal and non-verbal communication; CEP in lesson and unit planning; CEP pedagogy in different learning contexts; and building of creative and positive learning communities.

'''David C. Rowe''' (27 September 1949 &amp;ndash; 2 February 2003) was an [[United States|American]] [[psychology]] professor known for his work studying genetic and environmental influences on adolescent onset behaviors such as [[Juvenile delinquency|delinquency]] and [[tobacco smoking|smoking]].&lt;ref name="Rodgers2003"&gt;J. L. Rodgers, K. Jacobson and E. van den Oord. (2003). [https://web.archive.org/web/20160304115955/https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/85192141/2003-rodgers.pdf "Obituary: David Christian Rowe"]. ''Behavior Genetics'', '''33''', 627–628.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rowe earned his [[Bachelor of Arts|A.B.]] from [[Harvard University]] and his [[Ph.D.]] from the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]], where he was a student at the [[Institute for Behavioral Genetics]].

Rowe was well known for his work on the genes and the environment: how they interact, what the limits of environment and genes might be, and what mechanisms implement these effects. He also focussed on articulating the different realms of the social environment: shared in families, unique to individuals, neighbourhood or nation level social and cultural effects. His book ''The Limits of Family Influence: Genes, Experience and Behaviour''&lt;ref name="Rowe1994"&gt;D. C. Rowe. (1994). [https://pdf.yt/d/22velfUn7fAGht1m ''The Limits of Family Influence: Genes, Experience and Behaviour'']. Guilford Press. London&lt;/ref&gt;  brought together much of this work.

This work led to several substantive findings on shared and nonshared environmental influences; seminal work on the heritability of parenting behaviors (the [[Nurture via Nature|genetics of the environment]] for children); on the [[heritability]] of [[antisocial behavior]]; race differences and their causes; for testing the interaction of education, and social class with genes in the development of intelligence; and for blending behavioral and molecular genetics. He made several methodological contributions, including work on modeling of means and covariances with raw data, the utility of the [[DeFries–Fulker regression|DeFries–Fulker analysis]], and measured genes and environmental influences. The [[Add Health]] data featured in much of his research, and he served as the main geneticist on this large and influential survey of over 90,000 adolescents across the United States.&lt;ref name="Rodgers2003"/&gt;

Rowe's work highlighted the often surprising immunity of mental states to social circumstances, reporting that "great fortune does not guarantee happiness; neither does great misfortune assure depression".&lt;ref name="Rowe2001"&gt;D. C. Rowe. (2001). [https://pdf.yt/d/le101wFUJfhiLS4C "Do people make environments or do environments make people?"] ''Ann N Y Acad Sci'', '''935''', 62–74.]&lt;/ref&gt; This led to his positing of biological set points as a mechanism for stability, as well as arguing for indirect genetic effects: that different genotypes would cause different people to react to the same environment in different ways, and, moreover, that individuals expose themselves to different social environments. This led to ideas about active seeking and environment construction, as well the idea that exposure to (controllable) life events may result partly from genetic predisposition. He was an advocate of [[Consilience]]: including biological individuality along with social, psychological, and cultural factors in any understanding of human behavior.

In 1994 he was one of 52 signatories on "[[Mainstream Science on Intelligence]],&lt;ref name="gottfredson"&gt;Gottfredson, Linda (December 13, 1994). [[Mainstream Science on Intelligence]]. ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', p A18.&lt;/ref&gt;" an editorial written by [[Linda Gottfredson]] and published in the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', which declared the consensus of the signing scholars on issues related to intelligence research following the publication of the book ''[[The Bell Curve]]''. Rowe's work frequently supported [[hereditarianism]].

The '''Department of [[Geography]]''' at the '''[[University of Washington]]''' is a key site for the contemporary development of '''[[critical geography]]''' and was a significant location for the '''[[quantitative revolution]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016718507001352 | doi=10.1016/j.geoforum.2007.09.006 | volume=39 | title=Geography’s underworld: The military–industrial complex, mathematical modelling and the quantitative revolution | year=2008 | journal=Geoforum | pages=3–16 | last1 = Barnes | first1 = Trevor J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The department is located in [[Seattle, Washington]] and has been highly ranked among leading geography graduate programs in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nap.edu/rdp/#download "A Data-Based Assessment of Research-Doctorate Programs in the United States (2011)" (29 April 2011)] (accessed 30 June 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Coursework in [[geography]] have been offered at the [[University of Washington]] at least since the 1890s, although no department was formally established.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.washington.edu/krumme/faculty/dept2.htm "Geography at the University of Washington" (1994) by Joseph Velikonja. The bulk of this history comes directly from this professor emeritus] (accessed 3 August 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; Early courses included [[political geography]] and [[physical geography]].

When the university was reorganized at its new location between [[Lake Union]] and [[Lake Washington]] in 1895, geography coursework was offered through the Department of Geology and Mineralogy in [[Denny Hall]]. Science Hall (now [[Parrington Hall]]) would become the new home for the department in 1902. Direction for new geographic coursework came under [[Henry Landes]], who was head of the department, and had studied with [[William Morris Davis]] at [[Harvard University]].

George T. Renner ([[Columbia University|Columbia]]) was hired in 1927 as the first geographer, and expanded the course offerings, which were dominated by physical geography. New courses included [[economic geography]] and [[human geography]]. In 1928, the department's title was renamed Department of Geology and Geography. Since 1928, there have been twelve heads (or chairs) of the department (Geography would become its own department in 1935):

# [[Henry Landes]], 1895–1935
# [[Howard Martin (geographer)|Howard Martin]], 1935–50
# [[Donald Hudson (geographer)|Donald Hudson]], 1950–63
# [[John Sherman (geographer)|John Sherman]], 1963–73
# [[Richard Morrill (geographer)|Richard Morrill]], 1973–83
# [[Morgan Thomas (geographer)|Morgan Thomas]], 1983–90
# [[William Beyers]], 1990–95, 2005–08

# [[J.W. Harrington]], 2000–05
# [[Katharyne Mitchell]], 2008–13
# [[Lucy A. Jarosz]], 2013–present

In 1942, the Department of Geography moved into its present location, Smith Hall on the Quad. Since the start of their graduate program in 1928, the department has granted over 500 M.A. degrees and over 300 Ph.D. degrees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://depts.washington.edu/geog/ma-and-ph-d-theses/ "Theses &amp; Dissertations" (2015)] (accessed 4 August 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19651">The '''Diligent Work-Frugal Study Movement''' ({{Lang-zh |s= 留法勤工俭学会 |t= 留法勤工儉學會 |p= Liú Fǎ qíngōng jiǎnxué huì|l=|labels=yes|links=yes|first=t}}; [[French language|French]]: ''Mouvement Travail-Études'') was a series of work-study programs which brought Chinese students to France and Belgium to work in factories as a way to pay for their study of French culture and Western science. The programs were organized between 1912 and 1927 largely by a group of [[Anarchism in China|Chinese anarchists]] who had come to Paris and wanted to introduce French science and social idealism to China.

After organizing smaller-scale programs starting in 1908, in 1916, after the outbreak of [[First World War]], the Chinese organizers worked with the Chinese and French governments to establish the Diligent Work-Frugal Study program, which brought less educated Chinese workers, and continued to bring students after the 1919 end of the war. In all, several thousand Chinese came to France as student-workers, though not all as formal members of a program. They included future leaders of the [[Chinese Communist Party]] such as [[Zhou Enlai]] and [[Deng Xiaoping]], as well as others who went on to prominent roles in China.

==Origins==
{{main|Anarchism in China}}
Well before Marxist socialism entered China, Chinese anarchists took up the cause of labor and educating the working class. The leaders of the [[Anarchism in China#Chinese student movements|Chinese Anarchist movement in Paris]] -- [[Li Shizeng]], [[Wu Zhihui]], [[Zhang Renjie]]. [[Wang Jingwei]], [[Wu Yuzhang]], and [[Cai Yuanpei]]—supported [[Sun Yat-sen]] but urged him to add a social and cultural aspect to his program of political revolution. They argued that individuals could not liberate themselves, but that educated men had the responsibility as teachers to use moral education and personal rectitude to show others the way. At the time, most students who went abroad went on government scholarships to Japan, though the [[Chinese Educational Mission]] of 1872-1881  and the [[Boxer Indemnity Scholarship Program]] sent students to the United States.  The Paris anarchists were eager to establish interchange with France, which they regarded as a progressive and secular society.{{sfnb|Levine|1993|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=VcSdJGohsa4C&amp;dq=Li+Shizeng&amp;q=Frugal+work+diligent+study#v=snippet&amp;q=Frugal%20work%20diligent%20study&amp;f=false 30-32]}}

[[File:Wu Zhihui Zhang Jingjiang Li Shizeng Xin Shijie Society Leaders.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Wu Zhihui, Zhang Renjie, and Li Shizeng]]In 1908 Li Shizeng planned the first Work-Study program as a way to bring young Chinese to France. He opened the [[Caséo-Sojaïne|Usine de la Caséo-Sojaïne]], which manufactured soy products for the French market. The workers' study would be financed by working in his factory and their character would be uplifted by his regimen of moral instruction. This first Work-Study program eventually brought 120 workers to France. Li aimed to take these worker-students, who he called "ignorant" and "superstitious," and make them into knowledgeable and moral citizens who on their return home would become models for a new China. They received instruction in Chinese, French, and science and were required to abstain from tobacco, alcohol, and gambling.{{sfnb|Bailey|2014|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=LCPvAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA18&amp;dq=Li+Shizeng&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=NhG2U5OfJMGOqAb_zYHwCw&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Li%20Shizeng&amp;f=false 25-26]}}

In April 1912, excited by the success of the Chinese revolution and the prospect of the new-born Republic of China, Li, Zhang Renjie, Wu Zhihui, and Cai Yuanpei, who had returned to Beijing, founded the Association for Frugal Study in France ({{Lang-zh|s=留法俭学会|t=留法儉學會 |p=Liú Fǎ jiǎnxué huì|l=|labels=yes|links=yes|first=t}}), also known as the Society for Rational French Education (Societé Rationelle des Etudiants Chinois en France). Students traveled from China via the Siberian railway, a trip which took about eighteen days and cost approximately two hundred dollars.{{sfnb|Scalapino|1961|p=Frugal Study in France}} The Society prepared students for inexpensive study (¥600 a year) in France and "by labor and a simple life to cultivate habits of diligence and hard work." In contrast to his own experience when he came in 1902 as an "embassy scholar," which involved only a handful of students from privileged families, Li hoped to welcome hundreds of working-class students into the program. Wu Zhihui, who came from a poor family himself, remarked that actually the program would be especially good for students from rich families: "even if they do not study anything, if at least they learn how to clean toilets it will be worth it."{{sfnb|Bailey|1988|p=445-447}}

The Association opened a preparatory school in Beijing which offered aspiring students a six-month course in French. When the first group of 30 student-workers for his factory reached France in January 1913, Li arranged for them to be admitted to the College at Montargis, south of Paris, where his warm relations with city officials made arrangements easier. The Association established a workers' school near the factory, in which Li and Wu taught Chinese, French language, and general scientific knowledge.{{sfnb|Levine|1993|p=24}} In addition to making workers more knowledgeable, work-study would eliminate their "decadent habits" and transform them into morally upright and hard-working citizens. A strict regimen was imposed&amp;nbsp;— no smoking, gambling or alcohol &amp;nbsp;— and the workers were expected to devote their spare time to study.{{sfnb|Bailey|1988|p=445}} In all, this program brought more than 120 students to France before it was closed down in 1913 by [[Yuan Shikai]], the new president of China, who regarded its leaders as associates if his rival, Sun Yat-sen.{{sfnb|Boorman|1968|p=320}}

==The Diligent Work-Frugal Study program==
The outbreak of war in 1914 led France to recruit Chinese workers for factory work and heavy manual labor. The [[Chinese Labour Corps|Chinese Labor Corps in France]] eventually brought more than 130,000 workers, mostly from North China villages. In June 1915, Li and his Paris friends took this opportunity to provide schooling and training. The Work-Study program was renewed, though on a different basis, bringing less educated workers rather than students. By March 1916 their Paris group, the Société Franco-Chinoise d'Education ({{Lang-zh|s=华法教育会|t=華法教育會 |p=Huáfǎ jiàoyùhuì|l=|labels=yes|links=yes|first=t}}) was directly involved in recruiting and training these workers. The Société had well-placed French backers, mostly on the political left, including [[Alphonse Aulard]], the first president of the Société, a professor of French history at the [[Sorbonne]]; [[Marius Moutet]], vice-president and a socialist member of the National Assembly from Lyon; and [[Édouard Herriot]], mayor of Lyon. They pressed the French government to give the Chinese workers technical education as well as factory work. Li wrote extensive articles in the ''Chinese Labor Journal'' (Huagong zazhi), which introduced readers to Western science, arts, fiction, and current events.{{sfnb|Xu|2011|pp=200-203}}
[[File:Doufu Factory Night School 1916.jpg|thumb|300px|''Doufu Factory Nightschool 1916'']]
By 1917, the Society had established feeder schools in Beijing, Baoding, and Changxingdian, in North China.{{sfnb|Levine|1993|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=VcSdJGohsa4C&amp;dq=Li+Shizeng&amp;q=Frugal+work+diligent+study#v=snippet&amp;q=Frugal%20work%20diligent%20study&amp;f=false 25-29]}} Students in Hunan wanted to found a preparatory school, but the provincial government at Changsha refused to help. A delegation went to Beijing in February 1918 to consult with Li and Cai. The financial support they obtained from the Beijing government attracted even more students from Hunan, including [[Mao Zedong]]. Cai and Li told student leaders that the government had little money but would lend them transportation funds, in return, students would be expected to teach laborers in France. The first group of thirty students to go to France repaid the loan within five months, allowing two groups a year to follow.{{sfnb|Scalapino|1961|loc=The “Diligent Work-Frugal Study” Movement}}

The new students came from a wide background. The Work-Study movement now offered overseas study to those whose education stopped at the middle-school level or below. The preparatory schools at Baoding and Changxingdian required only that applicants have basic Chinese and that they not possess "bad habits" such as smoking or gambling. The low tuition fees charged by the preparatory schools and the specially reduced boat fares Li Shizeng negotiated with French authorities also increased the numbers of students who could come on the program.{{sfnb|Bailey|1988|p=448-450}}

In 1919 and 1920, even after the signing of the peace, the Sino-French Education Association sponsored 17 groups of Chinese students, totaling nearly 1,600, who were placed in factories and schools, including increased numbers of students from the poorer inland provinces of Hunan and Sichuan.{{sfnb|Bailey|1988|p=448-450}} Among these were the future leader of the Chinese Communist Party, [[Deng Xiaoping]], then 16 years old, who had been recruited by Wu Yuzheng in Chongqing,&lt;ref name="sacu.org"&gt;" Wang Song, "[http://www.sacu.org/dengfrance.html Chinese Revolutionaries in France]" (Society for Anglo-Chinese Understanding)&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Xu Teli]], then in his early 40s, the future commissar of education at Yan'an in 1937.{{sfnb|Bailey|1988|p=448-450}}

Deng arrived in France on October 19, 1920, but within three months the Sichuan Association which sponsored his trip ran out of money. Deng then worked at Schneider &amp; Co., France's largest ordnance manufacturer, in [[Le Creusot|Creusot]], a southern city.{{sfnb|Vogel|2011| p= 18-20}}&lt;ref name = "sacu.org"/&gt; Deng was surprised to see white people treat Chinese like slaves in Shanghai and other ports along the way. Although he and many of his Chinese colleagues had considered themselves economically well off in China, they now worked long hours in poor conditions while they saw French families living in luxury unknown in China. Deng learned how to use an industrial welder, a skill which proved useful when he was deposed from power during the [[Cultural Revolution]] and sent to work in a factory.{{sfnb|Vogel|2011| p=18-22}}

==The Lyons incident and the decline of the program==
In 1921, word spread that Wu Zhihui was bringing one-hundred students from Guangdong and Guangxi provinces who were to be given first preference in enrolling at the Institute in Lyons. Worker-students already in France, unhappy with their miserable conditions and fearful that their stipends were about to be cut off, went to Lyons to protest. The protests escalated into riots which led to the expulsion of their leaders from France. The "Lyons Incident" turned the younger generation of students into angry critics who dismissed anarchism as a revolutionary doctrine and rejected older leaders such as Wu, Li, and Cai Yuanpei. The Institute survived but did not play the hope for central role in Sino-French relations.{{sfnb|Levine|1993|pp = 121-134}}

==Legacy and impact==
The student-workers did not all learn the lessons in French civilization that the organizers hoped. One student, [[Wang Ruofei]], a future Chinese communist leader, sounded satisfied when he wrote
:Our labouring spirit convinced us and we felt that these clouds of black smoke were also important products of culture and that these rough and ready labourers were, after all, leading the true way of life and were the builders of civilization. Why should I reject such a way of life? {{sfnb|Bailey|1988|p=451}}
However, [[Chen Yi (general)|Chen Yi]], who later became a high ranking communist general, worked at a [[Michelin]] plant and complained that factory life had nothing to do with the ideals of equality, freedom and fraternity supposedly characteristic of French society. Rather, it had shown him the "evil nature" of European capitalism at first hand.{{sfnb|Bailey|1988|p=454}}

Among the radical students who came to France in 1919 were [[Cai Hesen]], Chen Yi, [[Li Fuchun]], and Cai Chang, all friends of [[Mao Zedong#Beijing, Anarchism, and Marxism: 1917–19|Mao Zedong]] from Hunan province. Mao himself remained in China. Cai Hesen wrote to Mao in August and September 1920 to share his experiences and expound on the concept of the dictatorship of the proletariat which he learned in France. He urged Mao to prepare for an "October 1917 style" revolution in China. A centralized vanguard party which would usher in a proletarian dictatorship was essential, Cai insisted, in order to combat anarchism on the one hand and bourgeois dictatorship on the other. France would not be China's ally and model, he concluded, but the Soviet Union.{{sfnb|Bailey|1988|p=455-56}}

Student-workers in France who went on to leadership roles in the [[Chinese Communist Party]] included [[Zhou Enlai]], [[Deng Xiaoping]], [[Cai Hesen]], Chen Yi, [[Li Fuchun]], [[Li Lisan]], [[Li Weihan]], [[Nie Rongzhen]], [[Wang Ruofei]], [[Xiang Jingyu]], [[Xu Deheng]], [[Xu Teli]], [[Zhao Shiyan]], and [[Zhu De]]. Participants in the program or those who worked with them who went on to prominent roles in other areas included [[Li Huang]] ({{Lang-zh|s=李璜|t=李璜|p=Lǐ Huáng|l=|labels=yes|links=yes|first=s}}), founder of the [[Chinese Youth Party]].

Program students were overwhelmingly male, though there were perhaps forty women. Those who went on to become prominent communists include [[Zhang Yibao]], [[Cai Chang]], and [[Xiang Jingyu]]. Others include [[Zheng Yuxiu]] (better known in France as Tcheng Yu-hiu or Soumé Tcheng), who took a degree in law at the Sorbonne, married the diplomat [[Wei Daoming]], and became an influential jurist and supported of the [[Kuomintang|Chinese Nationalist Party]].{{sfnb|Barman|1987|pp=9-11}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7151">'''Domestication theory''' is an approach in [[science and technology studies]] and [[media studies]] that describe the processes by which innovations, especially new [[technology]] is 'tamed' or appropriated by its users. First, technologies are integrated into everyday life and adapted to daily practices. Secondly, the user and its environment change and adapt accordingly. Thirdly, these adaptations feedback into innovation processes in industry, shaping the next generation of technologies and services.
The theory was initially developed to help understand the adoption and use of new media technologies by households (Silverstone et al. 1992), but has since been expanded in the innovation literature as a tool to understand technologies and innovations entering any consuming unit (workplace, country etc. e.g. Lie et al., Habib, Punie, Sørensen) that can be analysed economically, culturally and sociologically. The domestication approach considers both the practical and the symbolic aspects of the adoption and use of technologies, showing how these two elements- the meanings of things, and their materiality, are equally important understanding how technologies become part of everyday life.  It is a foremost a social theory as it highlights the negotiations, challenges to power and control, rule-making and breaking that accompany the introduction of technologies into any social setting.

One variant of domestication theory identified three stages of technology being adapted by users. According to Nancy K. Baym, these three stages are (1) initially marvelous and strange, (2) then become capable of creating greatness and horror and (3) and are then so ordinary as to be invisible (Baym, 2015). This can also be thought of as (1) euphoria, (2) moral panic, and (3) domestication. An example of this is the introduction of video games into society. Initially, there was a euphoric response to video games as it had the potential to improve hand, eye, and brain coordination. Then, moral panic set in and there was a fear of violence, addiction, and obesity. Lastly, there was a domestication of video games with acceptance of the technology as an ordinary part of society. 

The Domestication approach has roots in cultural studies of media use, but is informed by [[Science and technology studies]], [[gender studies]] of household technology, sociology of [[everyday life]], consumption studies and [[innovation]] studies, and has been most widely used in studying the mass adoption of computers, the internet and mobile phones.

As a strand of the [[Social shaping of technology]] approach to understanding how technology is created, Domestication theory highlights the role of users in innovation - the work done by individuals and communities in order to make a technology from the outside do practical work, and make sense within that community. This strand of work  links to the role of end users, lead users etc. in long term innovation processes (Williams et al. 2004).

Domestication studies are generally done using qualitative methods, such as long interviews and [[ethnography]] to explore the emerging meanings of technologies, and the changing routines, and conflicts that would not normally be accessible to quantitative methods.

The Domestication approach uses a number of different concepts to distinguish various aspects of the process. For example: Appropriation is the process of bringing a technology into a household, or another local cultural context; Conversion is the remaking of the meanings, or values and norms associated with the technology and the transfer of these back to the 'outside' world.

The principal criticism of the domestication approach is its reliance on detailed case studies, and its rather descriptive approach which is difficult to turn into prescriptive lessons of the type required by business and policy makers.  However, this rich-descriptive approach is also its strength: it enables processes and the complex interplay of artifacts and cultural values to be explored in much  more depth than individualistic, quantitative methods.

The Domestication approach, describing the integration of technologies into social relationships and structures using evidence obtained using qualitative methods, stands in sharp contrast to individualistic and quantitative approaches (such as [[Technology acceptance model]]) of North-American marketing and IS research, that draw on primarily psychological models.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2898">'''Edward J. Bloustein Distinguished Scholars''' are recognized as the highest achieving graduating [[high school]] students in or from [[New Jersey]] and are granted awards regardless of need.

Students are selected on the basis of the following criteria: 
#class rank of one, two, or three in the graduating class; or 
#class rank within the top 10 percent of the graduating class at the end of the junior year with combined critical reading and math [[SAT]] scores of 1,260 or higher at the end of the junior year.  

New Jersey students attending out-of-state secondary schools must rank in the top 10% of their class and have combined critical reading and math SAT scores of at least 1,260.

Distinguished Scholars are offered an annual award of up to $1,000 without regard to financial need. The scholarship may be available for up to four years of undergraduate study at a New Jersey college or university, if funds are appropriated by the [[New Jersey Legislature]] each year. The recipient must enroll full-time during the academic year following his or her secondary school graduation at a New Jersey college or university to receive payment of the award.

More than 5,000 Distinguished Scholars received award offers for the 2006-07 collegiate academic year. For the 2005-06 selection process, secondary schools submitted names and academic information of more than 20,400 students. [http://www1.hcstonline.org/Information/HCSTNews/tabid/52/ctl/ArticleView/mid/364/articleId/85/HIGHTECHSTUDENTSSELECTEDAS20062007EDWARDJBLOUSTEINDISTINGUISHEDSCHOLARS.aspx]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}

The award was established in the 1989-1990 academic year and posthumously honors [[Edward J. Bloustein]], the seventeenth [[President of Rutgers University]].  

On April 27, 2010, Distinguished Scholars were informed by letter that "in light of the economic challenges facing the State of New Jersey, difficult decisions regarding program funding had to be made. One of the budget recommendations is to suspend funding for new Distinguished Scholar as well as new NJ STARS awards for the 2010-2011 academic year. Over the next few months, the legislature will review the recommended budget prior to finalizing it by July 1. You will be notified if the budget includes funding for new Distinguished Scholars and/or new NJ STARS students."

As of now, the HESAA website states the program "recognizes outstanding academic achievement of New Jersey high school seniors who graduated prior to 2010," indicating it has been discontinued.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7666">The '''Fundamentals of Engineering''' ('''FE''') '''exam''', also referred to as the '''Engineer in Training''' ('''EIT''') '''exam''', and formerly in some states as the '''Engineering Intern''' ('''EI''') '''exam''', is the first of two examinations that [[engineer]]s must pass in order to be licensed as a [[Professional Engineer]] in the [[United States]]. The [[exam]] is open to anyone with a [[Academic degree|degree]] in engineering or a related field, or currently enrolled in the last year of an [[Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology|ABET]]-accredited engineering degree program. Some state licensure boards permit students to take it prior to their final year, and numerous states allow those who have never attended an approved program to take the exam if they have a state-determined number of years of work experience in engineering. A selection of states allow those with ABET-accredited "Engineering Technology" or "ETAC" degrees to take the examination. The state of [[Michigan]] has no admission pre-requisites for the FE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://www.michigan.gov/lara/0,4601,7-154-35299_61343_35414_60647_35472-114639--,00.html|title= Professional Engineers Examination}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exam is administered by the [[National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying]] (NCEES).

==Structure==
As of 2014, the FE and FS exams are offered only via Computer Based Testing (CBT). The exam is now given over a total of 5 hours and 20 minutes, has 110 questions, is divided differently, etc. The subjects of the different exams are chemical, civil, electrical and computer, environmental, industrial and systems, mechanical, and other disciplines. 

Prior to 2014, the exam was divided into two 4-hour sessions with a lunch break in between. The morning session consisted of 120 questions in a range of scientific/engineering subjects and had to be taken by all examinees, while the afternoon session consisted of 60 questions and could be taken either in a specific discipline or as a general engineering test. In 2015, content changes in the exam were instituted to make it entirely discipline-specific, with a plan of weaving general engineering subject matter (e.g. math and science fundamentals) throughout the exam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nspe.org/resources/pe-magazine/march-2015/evolution-fe|title=The Evolution of the FE - National Society of Professional Engineers|website=www.nspe.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Less of the "full breadth" of most traditional engineering undergraduate curricula will be captured with this approach - such as the broad math and science foundation spanning chemistry, physics, mechanics (i.e. statics and dynamics), materials science, computer science, electronics/circuits, engineering design, and the standard range of engineering mathematics (i.e. calculus, differential equations, statistics). A concern was that, while most undergraduate engineering students are in fact exposed to most of these subjects, they may not necessarily take courses in specialized topics such as thermodynamics and fluid mechanics.

A scaled score of 70 is required to pass the exam.{{cn|date=June 2016}} This does not mean one needs to answer 70% of the answers correctly to pass, however. A portion of previous exam questions are then given on subsequent exams. After the exam, a statistical analysis of these questions is used to equate the new test to the benchmark test. This makes all of the tests more or less equal in difficulty.

Those who pass the exam are sometimes designated [[Engineer In Training]] or [[Engineer Intern]], depending on their state's licensure board's approach to recognizing those who are partway through the licensure process. After obtaining a given amount of work experience (the length of which is set by state law and may be based on the type of degree received), an EIT/EI may qualify to take the [[Principles and Practice in Engineering Exam|Professional Engineer]] (PE) exam. Actual licensure can then be applied for and awarded upon successful completion of the PE exam. The standard time of work experience (which may need to be under a [[Professional Engineer]]) is four years in most US states, for graduates of an ABET-accredited engineering program.

==Taking the exam==
Writing tools and scratch paper may not be brought to the testing site. A fine-tip pen and a test booklet may be used as scratch paper for working problems. No calculators are allowed except for those specifically approved by NCEES; these models have no programming or communications capabilities to prevent possibilities of cheating. The only reference material that may be used is a handbook which is provided to examinees on the testing program. For study purposes, the reference handbook may be obtained from the NCEES website or by purchasing a hard copy. However, examinees may not bring their own copies to the test site; they must use the ones issued to them by the testing program.  

===Calculator policy===
NCEES allows only the following calculators to be used on the Fundamentals of Engineering Exam:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://ncees.org/exams/calculator/|title=  NCEES Calculator policy}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Casio]] [[fx-115]] and [[fx-991]] (all models)
* [[Hewlett-Packard]] [[HP 33s]] and [[HP 35s]]
* [[Texas Instruments]] [[TI-30|TI-30X]] and [[TI-36|TI-36X]] (all models)

The calculator must clearly display its model number so that exam proctors can quickly identify the calculator and approve for use during the exam. The list of allowed calculators is revised each November. It is crucial that any examinee check the NCEES website to verify their calculator is acceptable. Using a non-permitted calculator after the exam has begun will result in the examinee having his or her exam confiscated immediately and the exam not being scored.{{cn|date=May 2012}} Calculator covers may not be brought into the testing room.

==U.S. Patent Office==
Passage of the Fundamentals of Engineering Exam or graduation with any bachelor's degree or equivalent experience, satisfies the [[U.S. Patent and Trademark Office]]'s technical requirements for sitting for its [[USPTO registration examination|registration examination]] to become either a registered [[patent attorney]] or patent agent.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uspto.gov/ip/boards/oed/GRB_March_2012.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  This is specified in "Category C" on page 8 of the General Requirements Bulletin.

Anderson is the co-writer of ''[[The Earthend Saga]]'' novel trilogy and the self-help guide book ''WE: A Manifesto for Women Everywhere''.

Anderson has been active in supporting numerous charities and humanitarian organizations. She is an honorary spokesperson for the [[Neurofibromatosis]] Network and a co-founder of South African Youth Education for Sustainability (SAYes). Anderson was appointed an honorary [[Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire]] (OBE) in 2016 for her services to drama.

==Early life==
Anderson was born in Chicago, Illinois, the daughter of Rosemary "Posie" Alyce (''née'' Lane), a [[programmer|computer analyst]], and Homer Edward "Ed" Anderson III, who owned a film [[post-production]] company.&lt;ref name="filmreference"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/1/Gillian-Anderson.html|title=Gillian Anderson Biography (1968–)|publisher=Filmreference.com|accessdate=July 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gilliananderson.ws/transcripts/07_09/07grandrapids.shtml|title=Charity, celebrity blend well, actress says|last=Merrell|first=Sue|work=The Grand Rapids Press|publisher=gilliananderson.ws|date=May 18, 2007|accessdate=September 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is of English, German, and Irish ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ancestry of Anderson's family|url=http://familytreemaker.genealogy.com/users/b/a/u/Don-Bauer/WEBSITE-0001/UHP-0475.html|accessdate=September 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after her birth, her parents moved to [[Puerto Rico]] for 15 months, then to London, England. The family relocated so that her father could attend the [[London Film School]].&lt;ref name="BioYahoo"&gt;{{cite web|title=Biography: Gillian Anderson|publisher=Yahoo!|url=https://celebrity.yahoo.com/gillian-anderson/?nf=1|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151126101826/https://celebrity.yahoo.com/gillian-anderson/?nf=1|archivedate=November 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During her childhood, she lived in north London's [[Crouch End]] and [[Harringay]].&lt;ref name="ES2014"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/celebrity-news/gillian-anderson-self-destruction-is-my-default-mode-9897489.html|title=Gillian Anderson: Self destruction is my default mode|last=Curtis|first=Nick|date=December 3, 2014|work=[[London Evening Standard]]|accessdate=August 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was a pupil of Coleridge Primary School.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gilliananderson.ws/transcripts/96_97/96okweekly.shtml|title=X-Rated Agents|accessdate=October 16, 2015|work=[[OK!]]|date=September 29, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Anderson was 11 years old, her family returned to the United States, settling in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/features/gillian-anderson-just-dont-ask-her-about-aliens-128348.html|title=Gillian Anderson: Just don't ask her about aliens|last=Thompson|first=Jonathan|accessdate=October 30, 2015|work=[[The Independent]]|date=November 17, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; They continued to keep a flat in London, and spent their summers there.&lt;ref name="NPR"/&gt; Anderson later said that she has always intended to return to England.&lt;ref name=IndieW15&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/gillian-anderson-on-owning-feminine-sexuality-in-the-fall-20150116|title=Gillian Anderson on Owning Feminine Sexuality in ''The Fall''|date=January 16, 2015|last=Shannon Miller|first=Liz|work=[[Indiewire]]|accessdate=October 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Grand Rapids, she attended Fountain Elementary and [[City High-Middle School]], a program for gifted students with a strong emphasis on the [[humanities]].&lt;ref name="BioLT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lifetimetv.co.uk/people/gillian-anderson|title=Biography: Gillian Anderson|work=[[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the move to Grand Rapids, Anderson went through a rebellious stage as a teenager; experimenting with [[drugs]], dating a much older boyfriend, and cultivating a [[Punk subculture|punk]] appearance (dyeing her hair various colors, shaving the sides of her head, sporting a nose piercing and an all-black wardrobe).&lt;ref name="NPR"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2013/12/07/249240231/gillian-anderson-on-the-fall-and-getting-arrested-in-high-school|title=Gillian Anderson On 'The Fall' And Getting Arrested in High School|date=December 7, 2013|publisher=[[NPR]]|accessdate=September 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BioLT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Out2012"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Hicklin|first=Aaron|title=The Double Life of Gillian Anderson|url=http://www.out.com/entertainment/television/2012/03/13/gillian-anderson-lesbian-love-xfiles-Miss-Havisham|accessdate=September 21, 2015|work=Out|date=March 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was put in [[Psychotherapy|therapy]] at the age of 14.&lt;ref name=Guardian15&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/feb/08/gillian-anderson-on-therapy-rebellion-and-being-weird|title=Gillian Anderson on therapy, rebellion and 'being weird'|last=Hattenstone|first=Simon|accessdate=August 23, 2015|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=February 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson listened to bands such as [[Dead Kennedys]] and [[Skinny Puppy]]. She was voted by her classmates as "class clown", "most bizarre girl" and "most likely to be arrested".

At an early age Anderson was interested in [[marine biology]], but after becoming interested in theatre during her teenage years, she began acting in high school productions during her first year and later in [[community theatre]].&lt;ref name="BioLT"/&gt; She also served as a student intern at the [[Grand Rapids Civic Theatre &amp; School of Theatre Arts]].&lt;ref name=" Independent10"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Mottram|first=James|title=X-Files to YBAs: Gillian Anderson takes on the art world|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/xfiles-to-ybas-gillian-anderson-takes-on-the-art-world-1938231.html|accessdate=October 30, 2015|newspaper=The Independent|date=April 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating from high school in 1986, she attended [[The Theatre School at DePaul University]] in Chicago, where she earned a [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]] in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theatre.depaul.edu/ALUMNI/Pages/default.aspx|title=The Theatre School at DePaul University – Alumni|publisher=theatre.depaul.edu|accessdate=October 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson also participated in the [[National Theatre of Great Britain]]'s summer program at [[Cornell University]].&lt;ref name="BioLT"/&gt; To support herself financially during her student years, she worked at the [[Goose Island Brewery|Goose Island Brewpub]] in Chicago. After Anderson became famous, the brewery named one of their beers after her – a [[Saison|Belgian Style Farmhouse Ale]], simply called "Gillian".&lt;ref name="IndieW15"/&gt;

Anderson is the eldest of three siblings. Her brother Aaron – who was diagnosed with [[neurofibromatosis]] – died in 2011 of a brain tumor, at the age of 30. Aaron was a DJ, a mentor, and a practicing [[Buddhist]]. He was in his second year of a PhD program in [[Developmental Psychology]] at [[Stanford University]] when he was diagnosed with [[glioblastoma]] in 2008.&lt;ref name=" NW98"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.gilliananderson.ws/transcripts/98/98newweekly.shtml|title=Gillian's Plea: "Save my sick brother"|date=March 9, 1998|author=Larry Kaplan|work=New Weekly|accessdate=November 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://obits.mlive.com/obituaries/grandrapids/obituary.aspx?pid=153833165|title=Aaron Anderson obituary|publisher=Obits.mlive.com|date=November 5, 2011|accessdate=June 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her sister Zoe is a [[ceramic art|ceramicist]], whom Anderson calls "an exceptional artist".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2cNPsTJNac|title=Shindig – Gillian Anderson Interactive Q&amp;A|via=YouTube|publisher=[[Shindig (video chat platform)|Shindig]]|date=March 11, 2015|accessdate=November 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zoe is openly gay and is married to her partner.&lt;ref name="US25"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://celebrity.yahoo.com/news/gillian-anderson-25-things-dont-know-164500184-us-weekly.html|title=Gillian Anderson: 25 Things You Don't Know About Me|date=February 7, 2015|work=[[Us Magazine]]|accessdate=November 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
[[File:Gillian anderson lk.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Anderson at the stage door for the play ''The Sweetest Swing in Baseball'' at the [[Royal Court Theatre]], 2004]]

===1990s===
Anderson moved to New York when she was 22 years old. To support herself as she started her career, she worked as a waitress.&lt;ref name="Bio1"&gt;{{cite web|title=About Gillian – Biography (page 1)|work=gilliananderson.ws|url=http://www.gilliananderson.ws/about/bio1.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; She began her career in [[Alan Ayckbourn]]'s play ''[[Absent Friends (play)|Absent Friends]]'' at the [[Manhattan Theatre Club]] alongside [[Brenda Blethyn]];&lt;ref name=AbsentFriends&gt;{{Cite news|last=Witchel|first=Alex|title=Two Newcomers Make Waves in Ayckbourn Play|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/20/theater/two-newcomers-make-waves-in-ayckbourn-play.html|accessdate=February 10, 2016|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=February 20, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; for her role she won the 1990–91 [[Theatre World Award]] for "Best Newcomer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Past Recipients – Theatre World Awards|url=http://www.theatreworldawards.org/past-recipients.html|website=''theatreworldawards.org''|accessdate=October 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her next theatrical role was in [[Christopher Hampton]]'s ''[[The Philanthropist (play)|The Philanthropist]]'' at the [[Long Wharf Theatre]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut]].&lt;ref name=Philanthropist&gt;{{Cite news|last=Klein|first=Alvin|title=THEATER; 'The Philanthropist'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/02/nyregion/theater-the-philanthropist.html|accessdate=September 24, 2012|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=February 2, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anderson moved to Los Angeles in 1992, and spent a year auditioning. The same year, she appeared in her first feature-length film, ''[[The Turning (1992 film)|The Turning]]'', starring [[Karen Allen]] and [[Tess Harper]]. The film drama is an adaptation of the play ''Home Fires Burning''.&lt;ref name="Bio1"/&gt;

Although she had once vowed she would never do television work, being out of work for a year changed her mind. Anderson recalled: "First of all, I swore I'd never move to Los Angeles, and once I did, I swore I'd never do television. It was only after being out of work for almost a year that I began going in [to auditions] on some stuff that I would pray that I wouldn't get because I didn't want to be involved in it."&lt;ref name="Bio1"/&gt; She broke into mainstream television in 1993, with a guest appearance on the collegiate drama, ''[[Class of '96]]'', on the fledgling [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox Network]].&lt;ref name="BioYahoo"/&gt;

As a result of this guest appearance, Anderson was sent the script for ''[[The X-Files]]''. She was 24 when she decided to audition because, "for the first time in a long time, the script involved a strong, independent, intelligent woman as a lead character."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last= Walker|first= Alix|title= People should know that I laugh|url= http://www.stylist.co.uk/from-the-app/gillian-anderson-people-should-know-that-i-laugh|accessdate=September 21, 2015|newspaper= Stylist Magazine|date=November 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Producer [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] wanted to hire her, but Fox wanted someone with previous television exposure and greater sex appeal.&lt;ref name="Bio1"/&gt; Fox sent in more actresses, but Carter stood by Anderson, and she was eventually cast as [[Dana Scully|FBI Special Agent Dana Scully]]. Anderson got the part assuming it would run for 13 episodes, the standard minimum order for American television networks.

It has evolved into an integrated network of schools spanning grades K-12, housing a comprehensive teacher certification program and a new, innovative Graduate School of Education. |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Students are admitted to the public elementary, middle, and high schools through a zip-code based lottery system in an effort to admit a demographically-diverse representative sample of San Diego County.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kahlenberg|first1=Richard D.|last2=Potter|first2=Halley|title=A Smarter Charter: Finding What Works for Charter Schools and Public Education|date=September 15, 2014|publisher=Teachers College Press|location=New York|isbn=0807755796|page=186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

In 1996, forty members of San Diego’s civic and high-tech industry&lt;ref name="Questions for Larry Rosenstock"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Federis|first1=Marnette|title=Questions for Larry Rosenstock|url=http://voiceofsandiego.org/2006/09/02/questions-for-larry-rosenstock/|accessdate=8 August 2014|agency=Voice of San Diego|publisher=Voice of San Diego|date=September 2, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; assembled to discuss how to engage and prepare more young people for the high-tech industry. Called upon by the San Diego Economic Development Corporation and Business Roundtable, these members met regularly for the next two years to discuss how to engage and prepare local students for high-tech careers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bellanca|first1=James A.|title=The focus factor : 8 essential twenty-first century thinking skills for deeper student learning|date=2013|publisher=Teachers College Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=080775448X}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of these members included [[Gary E. Jacobs]], former director of education programs at Qualcomm.&lt;ref name="Questions for Larry Rosenstock"/&gt;

The original "High Tech High School" is now known as The [[Gary and Jerri-Ann Jacobs High Tech High]].

In 2000, the [[San Diego Unified School District]] approved the first charter and construction began in a former U.S. Navy training center in the Point Loma district, now known as Liberty Station, near the San Diego airport.  The grouping of High Tech High schools in this area is known as [[High Tech High Village]].  With a grant from the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]], High Tech High opened with 200 students in the 9th and 10th grades in September.  In 2003, the first graduating class graduated with 50 students.  In 2006, the Statewide Benefit Charter was approved. In 2007, High Tech High Digital Commons launched. In 2009, the statewide Benefit Charter was expanded to K-12.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

In 2010, it had approximately 3,500 students in high, middle, and elementary schools.  The HTH website states that in 2010, 100% of high school graduates were accepted to colleges, of which 80% were to four-year institutions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hightechhigh.org/about/ School website, retrieved online 2011-04-21] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5yVuLBiQc?url=http://www.hightechhigh.org/about/ |date=2011-05-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2008, 99% percent of graduates had entered college.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edutopia.org/collaboration-age-technology-high-tech ''Edutopia'' article, retrieved online 2011-04-21]&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2015, 98% of students attended college after graduation, with around 75% attending 4-year schools. According to statistics from that year, students of HTH scored higher than others within their demographic groups elsewhere in the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ewa.org/blog-educated-reporter/can-kicking-down-conventions-close-achievement-gap|publisher=Education Writers Association|title=Can Kicking Down Conventions Close the Achievement Gap?| author=Shelby Webb| date=December 9, 2015|access-date=March 29, 2018}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Program design principles==
The High Tech High program and curriculum evolved from the work of [[Larry Rosenstock]] and colleagues in the New Urban High School Project, an initiative of the U.S. Department of Education’s Office of Vocational and Adult Education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hightechhigh.org/about/design-principles.php School website, retrieved online 2011-04-21]&lt;/ref&gt; The focus was on inner-city high schools using school-to-work strategies, including internships and other forms of field work, as a leverage for whole-school change.  The findings of the NUHS were summarized in guides centered on six design principles.  The school is virtually textbook-free.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edutopia.org/collaboration-age-technology-high-tech "Real World, San Diego: Hands-On Learning at High Tech High" article by Grace Rubenstein in Edutopia, 2008-12-03, retrieved online 2011-04-28]&lt;/ref&gt; HTH is structured around four design principles, including three from NUHS and one developed by HTH:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kqed.org/mindshift/50443/whats-so-different-about-high-tech-high-anyway|publisher=Mind/Shift|title=What’s So Different About Hight Tech High Anyway?| author=Katrina Schwartz| date=February 6, 2018|access-date=March 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
* personalization
* adult world connection
* common intellectual mission
* teacher as designer

These principles determined the [[school organizational models|schools' organization]], including their small size, the openness of the facilities, personalization, emphasis on integrated and project-based learning,  and display and exhibitions of student work.  All students are required to complete internships in the community.  HTH director Ben Daley described the school's approach:  "We are teaching students to think deeply about content and then do something with their knowledge, not just race through a textbook.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sandiegomagazine.com/San-Diego-Magazine/July-2006/Great-Schools/ Great Schools article by Marcia Manna in ''San Diego Magazine'', 2006-07, retrieved online 2011-04-28]&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Rosenstock, who became a CEO of HTH, a slogan at High Tech High is: “You can play video games at HTH, but only if you make them here.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bigpicture.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/020501-technos-quarterly.pdf Pearlman: '' TECHNOS'', Vol. 11, No. 1 • Spring 2002, retrieved online 2011-04-21]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governance and funding==
The schools operate within the [[San Diego Unified School District]] but the High Tech High organization is governed by three independent boards of directors:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hightechhigh.org/about/governance.php School website, retrieved online 2011-03-21]&lt;/ref&gt;   
* The High Tech High Board operates as a public agency and has governance and fiduciary level control over all HTH schools.
* HTH Learning is a private nonprofit that oversees the facilities that house the schools of High Tech High.  It is also responsible for the adult learning programs, including the teacher certification program, and the related residencies and institutes.
* The High Tech High Foundation is a private nonprofit responsible for securing the philanthropic support needed to develop High Tech High schools.

The schools are publicly funded although they have received grants from private companies and organizations.  The [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]] contributed $17 million between 2000 and 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/06_26/b3990001.htm "Bill Gates Gets Schooled", Business Week article, 2006-06-26, retrieved online 2011-04-28]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Notable projects===

'''San Diego Bay Study'''

Since 2003, Dr. Jay Vavra and the juniors of [[Gary and Jerri-Ann Jacobs High Tech High]] have started and maintained the [http://www.sdbayguide.com/ San Diego Bay Study],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McLaughlin|first1=Evan|title=A Sea Change from Chalkboards and Textbooks: Questions for Jay Vavra|url=http://voiceofsandiego.org/2006/06/17/a-sea-change-from-chalkboards-and-textbooks-questions-for-jay-vavra/?action=rpx_token|accessdate=17 August 2014|agency=Voice of San Diego|date=17 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=The Students of High Tech High, San Diego|title=San Diego Bay Study|url=http://www.sdbayguide.com/|website=San Diego Bay Study|accessdate=17 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; producing four books on what students deemed “pressing environmental priorities.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=The Students of High Tech High, San Diego |title=San Diego Bay Study (Overview) |url=http://www.sdbayguide.com/overview.html |website=San Diego Bay Study |accessdate=17 August 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819090458/http://www.sdbayguide.com/overview.html |archivedate=19 August 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Conservationist [[Jane Goodall]] wrote the forward to the initial ''The Two Sides of Sides of the Bay Channel: A Field Guide''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=The Students of High Tech High, San Diego |title=San Diego Bay Study (Books) |url=http://www.sdbayguide.com/books.html |website=San Diego Bay Study |accessdate=17 August 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819085942/http://www.sdbayguide.com/books.html |archivedate=19 August 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the second study, ''Perspectives from the San Diego Bay: A Field Guide'' in which students used John Steinbeck’s [[The Log from the Sea of Cortez]] as the model for a more humanitarian guide.

'''The Blood Bank Project'''

In 2009, a team of twelfth-graders, led by art teacher Jeff Robin and biology/multimedia teacher Blair Hatch, collaborated with the [http://www.sandiegobloodbank.org/ San Diego Blood Bank] to raise awareness for the need to donate blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Blood Bank Project: Team Teaching |url=http://bie.org/object/video/the_blood_bank_project_team_teaching|website=Buck Institute for Education|publisher=Buck Institute for Education|accessdate=17 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students researched several blood-related topics, ranging from leukemia to the AIDS epidemic to the depiction of blood in films to the role of blood in various religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Price|first1=David|title=Open: how we'll work, live and learn in the future|date=10 November 2013|publisher=Crux|location=England|isbn=1909979015|page=177}}&lt;/ref&gt; In pairs, students created paintings large piece of wood with cut-outs for a student-created informational video. The products were displayed at the JETT Art Gallery in San Diego.

'''The End of the World Project (and co-design)'''

During the fall of 2012, sixth-graders at High Tech Middle co-designed a project with teachers Bobby Shaddox and Allie Wong. Building on the work of democratic educator [[James Beane]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Apple|first1=Michael|last2=Beane|first2=James|title=Democratic Schools, Second Edition: Lessons in Powerful Education|date=30 January 2007|publisher=Heinemann|location=Portsmouth, NH|isbn=0325010757}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shaddox and Wong asked students to generate questions they had about themselves and the world around them. They categorized these questions and then determined that many questions fell under the broader theme of “The End of the World.” Teachers then pitched the idea of creating a magazine and multimedia exhibition informing the public of the plausibility of the various (and rumored) ways in which the world might be brought to an end. In pairs, students researched topics ranging from global warming to deforestation to the Mayan prophecies. Students included interviews from local experts in their articles. Because teachers wanted to establish a democratic working environment, student input on the process was ongoing. Students were asked to tune project components, utilize peer feedback, and meet regularly as a whole-class community to make decisions about the process and product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shaddox|first1=Bobby|title=Co-design: A Democratic Approach to Project-Based Learning|date=6 June 2013|publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform|isbn=1490380159|url=http://bobbyshaddoxtl.weebly.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Raptors for Rodents Project'''

In the fall of 2014, fifth-graders at High Tech Elementary Chula Vista were visited regularly by the field mice that populated the open landscape surrounding the building. Students led by teacher Jeff Govoni researched the local predators of these rodents to determine which might be the safest and most effective way to reduce the population. Students determined that owls would have the greatest impact and so they then, in teams, investigated and created prototypes for owl boxes. In order to raise funding to build life-size versions, students wrote persuasive letters and created multimedia presentations. Upon funding, students built the nests and did, in fact, reduce the population of field mice in their school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Govoni |first1=Jeff |title=Raptors for Rodents |journal=UnBoxed: A Journal of Adult Learning in Schools |date=Spring 2014 |issue=11 |url=https://www.hightechhigh.org/unboxed/issue11/cards/8.php |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150124064029/http://www.hightechhigh.org/unboxed/issue11/cards/8.php |archivedate=2015-01-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extracurriculars===

'''[[The Holy Cows]]'''

[[The Holy Cows]] are a robotics team co-founded by High Tech High engineering teacher David Berggren and his father, Bill Berggren in 2004. The team runs like a business, with students fulfilling roles including student directors, managers, and supervisors of various departments. Students are mentored by local engineering experts, including Holy Cows alumnus Jon Jock of Seabotix,&lt;ref name="kpbs.org"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brown|first1=Dwane|title=High Tech High Team Headed to Robotics Championship|url=http://www.kpbs.org/news/2013/apr/04/high-tech-high-team-headed-robotics-championship/|accessdate=19 August 2014|agency=KPBS San Diego Public Radio &amp; TV: News, Arts &amp; Culture|publisher=KPBS San Diego Public Radio &amp; TV: News, Arts &amp; Culture|date=5 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; to accrue skills through the building of robots.

==Adult learning==
While HTH distilled its first three learning principles from The Urban School Project, it added a fourth: "Teacher as Designer" and employs a rigorous hiring process. It also stated a commitment to educating educators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=National Resource Center on Charter School Finance &amp; Governance|title=Implementing an In-House  Approach to Teacher Training  and Professional Development|url=https://www.usc.edu/dept/education/cegov/focus/charter-schools/publications/other/An_In-House_Approach_to_Teacher_Training_HighTechHigh.pdf|website=University of Southern California Center on Educational Governance|publisher=National Resource Center on Charter School Finance &amp; Governance|accessdate=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teacher hiring and support===

After an initial pre-screening of application materials, prospective teachers are invited to attend a day-long hiring “Bonanza” on a High Tech High school. In addition to touring the schools and mingling with prospective co-workers, they implement an hour-long lesson to class of students. Students are integral to the hiring process at High Tech High. Not only do they offer their feedback on the demonstration lesson, but they are invited to read and engage in a discussion with applicants on a sensitive, but relevant, topic as current High Tech High educators observe.&lt;ref name="High Tech's Hiring 'Bonanza'"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Alpert|first1=Emily|title=High Tech's Hiring 'Bonanza'|url=http://voiceofsandiego.org/2009/02/20/high-techs-hiring-bonanza/|accessdate=21 August 2014|agency=Voice of San Diego|publisher=Voice of San Diego}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hiring is competitive, and many vie for spots that open annually. Although High Tech High is publicly funded, it operates under its own board of directors, and thus can create its own hiring process. Directors of the school’s campuses take teacher and student feedback into account, along with their current school needs, when offering candidates a position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shields|first1=Regis Anne|last2=Ireland|first2=Nicole|last3=City|first3=Elizabeth|last4=Derderian|first4=Julie|last5=Miles|first5=Karen Hawley|title=Case Studies of Leading Edge  Small Urban High Schools|url=http://www.erstrategies.org/cms/files/1010-high-tech-high-school.pdf|website=Education Resource Strategies|publisher=Education Resource Strategies|accessdate=21 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; High Tech High teachers are contracted for one year and do not receive tenure, nor do they have a teacher’s union.&lt;ref name="High Tech's Hiring 'Bonanza'"/&gt;

===Teacher credentialing===
High Tech High is authorized by the [[California Commission on Teacher Credentialing]] to offer preliminary and professional credentials.  It offers two programs: The Intern Program for preliminary teaching credentials and the two-year Induction Program for teachers with preliminary teaching credentials.

In order to invite qualified applicants who do not yet hold teaching credential to work with High Tech High, the organization developed its own credential program in 2004, becoming the state’s first approved charter-management organization (CMO) to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Robelen|first1=Erik W.|title=Learning Where They Teach|url=http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2007/07/18/43hightech.h26.html|website=Education Week|publisher=Education Week|accessdate=30 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Educators who wish to work with High Tech High may earn a teaching credential through the Teacher Intern Program. Those who possess (at a minimum)  B.A. or B.S. upon hiring and demonstrate subject-matter competence may apply for employment under the condition that they will enroll concurrently in a credential and induction program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Husbands|first1=Jennifer|title=Alternative Routes to Teacher Certification|journal=UnBoxed: A Journal of Adult Learning in Schools|date=Spring 2008|issue=1|url=http://www.hightechhigh.org/unboxed/issue1/alternative_certification/|accessdate=12 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The credential program is accredited by  the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Educator Training|url=http://www.hightechhigh.org/about/educator_training.php|website=High Tech High website|accessdate=12 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; is recognized for resisting the theoretical approach many credential programs are criticized for,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barnett|first1=Barry|title=Teaching Quality and the Question of Preparation|url=http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2005/10/19/08berry.h25.html|website=Education Week|publisher=Education Week|accessdate=12 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and adopting a clinical approach, akin to a medical residency. It authorizes Single-Subject, Multiple Subjects and Education Specialist credentials for staff and non-HTH teachers. Most interns teach full-time while earning their credentials, earning a regular salary and benefits. Graduates of the program present a portfolio of their work, demonstrating that they have met the qualifications to be licensed as a teacher in the state of California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wurdinger|first1=Scott D.|title=Time for Action: Stop Teaching to the Test and Start Teaching Skills|date=9 December 2011|publisher=R&amp;L Education|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=978-1610486606|page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, High Tech High was authorized to move teachers from preliminary to clear credential through an induction (BTSA) program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=High Tech High?

===Graduate School of Education===
The Graduate School of Education opened in September 2007, offering Master of Education Degrees (M.Ed) in Teacher Leadership and School Leadership to educators in and outside of the network of High Tech High schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=High Tech High Graduate School of Education|url=http://www.calcharters.org/2011/09/high-tech-high-graduate-school-of-education.html|website=California Charter Schools Association|publisher=California Charter Schools Association|accessdate=12 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the school was granted candidacy for accreditation by WASC (Western Association of Schools and Colleges),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statement of Accreditation Status  High Tech High Graduate School of Education|url=http://www.wascsenior.org/institutions/high-tech-high-graduate-school-education|website=WASC Senior College and University Commission|publisher=WASC Senior College and University Commission|accessdate=12 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the school became fully accredited in 2016.

'''Leading Schools Program'''&lt;br /&gt;
The Leading Schools Program (LSP) is a one-year certificate program that engages international and national teams of educators in online discussions and onsite residencies at High Tech High schools.

{{Nihongo|'''Hyozo Omori'''|大森 兵蔵|Ōmori Hyōzō|March 14, 1876 – January 3, 1913}} was a Japanese physical education specialist who studied in America and married the American artist [[Annie Shepley Omori|Annie Barrows Shepley]]. In Japan, they established ''Yurin En'' (House of the Friendly Neighbor), which was a settlement house and leader in the Japanese playground movement. Omori introduced basketball and volleyball to the country and was the team manager at the [[1912 Summer Olympics|1912 Stockholm Olympics]] in Sweden.

==Education==
Hyozo Omori was in the 1905 class of [[Stanford University]]{{r|Stanford}} and then continued his studies in Springfield, Massachusetts as a YMCA exchange student.{{r|Basketball}} He graduated from YMCA's College in Springfield{{r|Japan at Olympics}} with honors in 1907.{{r|Am Gym}}

==Marriage and career==
In October 1907, Omori married artist [[Annie Shepley Omori|Annie Barrows Shepley]].{{r|ws}} In 1908, when he had returned to Japan, he introduced volleyball and basketball to the country{{r|Basketball}}{{r|Japan at Olympics}} and became known as the "Father of Japanese Basketball".{{r|Better late}} In Tokyo, the Omoris established a [[settlement movement|settlement house]], ''Yurin En'' (House of the Friendly Neighbor) which offered dramatic classes and a playground for children. It also offered courses in sewing, flower arranging, cooking, and crafts as well as mother's meetings and opportunities for people to speak English.{{r|Jordan}}{{r|Survey}} Initially, they met resistance because of their co-educational programs, the fact that the Omoris were Christian, and that they broke down well-establish class barriers.{{r|Jordan}} The ''Yurin En'' was at the forefront of the Japanese playground movement.{{r|Japan at Olympics}}{{r|NRA}}

In 1909, Omori was the Physical Director for the Japanese Association. That year, he wrote "A Brief Survey of the Present Conditions of Physical Education in Japan" for ''Hygiene and Physical Education''.{{r|Hastings}}

Hyozo Omori was a physical education specialist and team manager for the Japanese team that competed in the [[1912 Summer Olympics|1912 Stockholm Olympics]] in Sweden. [[Yahiko Mishima]] from Tokyo Imperial University (now University of Tokyo) ran short distances and [[Shizo Kanakuri]], a 20-year-old Tokyo Higher Normal School student ran the marathon. Judo master [[Kanō Jigorō]] was the leader of the team. It was the first time that Japanese runners competed in the Olympics. Omori became quite ill when the group arrived in Stockholm following the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]] trip.{{r|Better late}}

Hyozo Omori died in 1913, and Annie continued running ''Yurin En'' after his death.{{r|Jordan}}{{r|NRA}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1405">An '''independent scholar''' is anyone who conducts scholarly research outside [[universities]] and traditional [[academia]]. 

In the US, a [[professional association]] exists for independent scholars: this association is the [[National Coalition of Independent Scholars]]. In Canada, the equivalent professional association is the Canadian Academy of Independent Scholars (in association with [[Simon Fraser University]]). Similar organizations exist around the world. Membership in a professional association generally entails a degree of post-secondary education and established research.

The '''Jewish-Palestinian Living Room Dialogue Group''' is a [[Nonviolent Communication|non-violent]] [[conflict resolution]] group established in 1992 in [[San Mateo, California]]. Its first meeting was held in a local neighborhood residence. As of January 2018, the group remained active and continued to meet monthly in members' homes.&lt;ref name="JP20Y"&gt;Jewish-Palestinian dialogue group still going strong after 20 years – by alix wall, j. correspondent In j., the Jewish news weekly of Northern California – Thursday, December 13, 2012 – [http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/67286/jewish-palestinian-dialogue-group-still-going-strong-after-20-years]&lt;/ref&gt;  The one-to-one, face-to-face method of [[conflict resolution]], modeled by this dialogue group, was increasingly looked to globally by educators, researchers, journalists, activists, trainers, and strategists including the [[U.S. Department of State]], which distributes the dialogue group's instructive films in Africa.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://vimeo.com/113065533|title=DIALOGUE IN NIGERIA: Muslims &amp; Christians Creating Their Future  (65 min)|work=Vimeo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beginnings==
Initial incentive to form the dialogue group came from [[Peaceful coexistence|coexistence]] models of the 1980s in the Middle East and Africa. Examples are: [[Neve Shalom| Neve Shalom ~ Wahat as-Salam]] (Oasis of Peace), a village where Jewish and Palestinian Israeli families live and learn together, and Koinonia Southern Africa,&lt;ref name="OPLNF"&gt;Dale Martin, "Old-fashioned Potlucks Lead to New Friendships", The Times, San Mateo, California, March 29, 1991, [http://traubman.igc.org/koinonia.htm Mirror of article]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Libby and Len Traubman, Remembering our roots in Koinonia Southern Africa, [http://traubman.igc.org/koinoniastory.htm Website article]&lt;/ref&gt; founded by [[Nico Smith|Reverend Nico Smith]] during [[Apartheid in South Africa|apartheid]] years, which gathered thousands of Blacks and Whites together to share meals and stories, sometimes in public at risk to their lives.  Both initiatives were honored together during the San Francisco 1989 [[Beyond War]] Award Ceremony.&lt;ref name="BWAC1989-Video"&gt;Beyond War Award – 1989 – Neve Shalom~Wahat al-Salam – Carter Center – Koinonia Southern Africa [https://archive.org/details/BeyondWarAward-1989-NeveShalomwahatAl-salamTheCarterCenter Free Video]&lt;/ref&gt;  The word [[Koinonia]] means "belonging together" or "communion by intimate participation"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ancientroadpublications.com/Studies/BiblicalStudies/FellowshipintheGospel.html|title="Fellowship in the Gospel" : A Study of the Greek Word Koinonia|work=ancientroadpublications.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several members of this dialogue group have deep roots in the principles and educational tradition of the [[Beyond War]] movement of the 1980s, which was succeeded by the Foundation for Global Community, the group's first fiscal sponsor.&lt;ref&gt;http://globalcommunity.org/fgcHistory.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Fiscal oversight support was later provided by the [[Peninsula Conflict Resolution Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcrcweb.org/people/|title=Community Partners – Peninsula Conflict Resolution Center|work=pcrcweb.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, several of the dialogue group founders, who had worked with the [[Beyond War|Beyond War Foundation]] and the Stanford Center on Conflict and Negotiation, brought together Palestinian and Israeli citizen leaders who forged and signed the '' "Framework for a Public Peace Process" ''.&lt;ref name="FWPPP"&gt;Stanford Center on International Conflict and Negotiation, [[Beyond War|Beyond War Foundation]], ''FRAMEWORK FOR A PUBLIC PEACE PROCESS: Toward a Peaceful Israeli-Palestinian Relationship'', 1991. [http://traubman.igc.org/ppp.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Living Room Dialogue model==

[[Image:LivingRoomDialogueGroup.jpg|300px|right|thumbnail|Jewish-Palestinian Living Room Dialogue Group]]
Engaging in [[peacebuilding]], the early [[Muslim]], [[Jewish]], and [[Christian]] women and men participants in the dialogue group were determined to export solutions, rather than import problems. They intended to create a people-intensive—not money-intensive—easily reproducible, in-home model to parallel and compliment the government [[Peace process in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict|peace process in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict]] as well as in other regions of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newerasupportfoundation.org/exploring-faiths|title=New Era Educational and Charitable Support Foundation –        Exploring Faiths|work=New Era Educational and Charitable Support Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1993, government negotiators were clarifying their own plea for mandatory citizen participation and the need for the creativity of People-to-People Programs, as found in Annex VI of the 1993 Oslo Accords.&lt;ref name="GuideToPeaceProcess"&gt;THE ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN INTERIM AGREEMENT ON THE WEST BANK AND THE GAZA STRIP, Annex VI, Protocol Concerning Israeli-Palestinian Cooperation Programs, 1999, [http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Peace+Process/Guide+to+the+Peace+Process/THE+ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN+INTERIM+AGREEMENT+-+Annex+VI.htm Website Page]&lt;/ref&gt;

As designed, the living room dialogue group format gives dynamic form to the emerging paradigm of people-centered [[human security]] that challenges traditional notions of government-centered [[national security]] and is focused on sustained state, regional, and global stability.

==Means of change==
Change is viewed by the dialogue group in [[Binary number|binary]] terms—a "no" component and a "yes" component. While defining the "no" component—what is wrong, disintegrating, and in need of correction—the dialogue's larger intention is to embody and paint a picture of the "yes," The intent is to focus less on the old and the obsolete—what does not work—and more on modeling the new, the "yes" component that works for the good of all. The dialogue group's ongoing experience is that change begins in small circles of local innovators and [[Cultural creatives|Culture Creatives]].

The means of [[Communication]] to strengthen relationships, release creativity, and effect change is [[Dialogue]], with its quality of [[Listening]] for [[Learning]].  While the action of dialogue is designed to deepen and enhance circles of relationships, it is not to be mistaken for safe, casual [[Conversation]] or adversarial, win-lose Debate.  Furthermore, this type of dialogue's contribution to [[Conflict transformation|Conflict Transformation]] is not in [[Conflict resolution|Conflict Resolution]] or [[Deliberation]].  Rather this type of dialogue is used to introduce, familiarize, humanize, dignify, and empathize with all the people in the room, so that [[Conflict resolution|Conflict Resolution]] and [[Deliberation]] can then take place on a solid foundation. In particular, the dialogue process begins with exploring each person's life [[narrative]], because in many cases "an enemy is one whose story we have not heard".  A beneficial outcome of this type of dialogue is a reduction in the widespread humiliation and [[rankism]] on Earth as defined by [[Robert W. Fuller]].

This [[Track II diplomacy|Track II Diplomacy]] approach is not a quick fix but requires time, and thus is rightfully referred to as Sustained Dialogue,&lt;ref&gt; https://sustaineddialogue.org/our-approach/&lt;/ref&gt; as defined by [[Harold H. Saunders|Dr. Harold H. (Hal) Saunders]].  Useful practices of this [[cross-cultural communication]] continue to improve, drawing from the best of [[Bohm Dialogue]], [[Interfaith dialogue|Interfaith Dialogue]], and the ongoing global [[Dialogue Among Civilizations]].

==Activities==
The contributions made by this dialogue group to the expanding effort to choose conversation over conflict were recognized in the Directory of Arab/Jewish/Palestinian Dialogue Groups published by the Center for Restorative Justice and Peacemaking at the University of Minnesota.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cehd.umn.edu/ssw/RJP/Projects/Palestinian-Israeli-Connection/Directory_Arab_Jewish_Palestinian_Dialogue_Groups.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Always seeking to expand the network, participants in this Dialogue Group communicate daily face-to-face and by e-mail, [[telephone]], and [[Skype]] with citizens worldwide to encourage new groups and provide both graphic and written how-to guidelines (pdf).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=how-to guidelines|url=http://traubman.igc.org/changechartsall.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This dialogue group regularly publishes e-mail reports on the global success stories regarding the expanding public peace process.&lt;ref&gt;What Others Are Doing: E-mail Reports About Successful Palestinian-Jewish and Interfaith Relationship Building Activities [http://traubman.igc.org/messages.htm Website Page]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Creating and Distributing Educational Tools and Instruction Guides===
The dialogue method draws on the wisdom of [[Elie Wiesel]]:  "People become the stories they hear and the stories they tell."  Dialogue-initiated [[peacebuilding]] successes are documented in film and other tools of [[education]] that are available for [[community building]]. Documents created by the group and freely distributed for use by others include: Palestinian &amp; Jewish Recipes for Peace,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://traubman.igc.org/recipes.htm|title=Palestinian &amp; Jewish Recipes for Peace – Middle East Israeli Arabic Food Cookbook Holiday Gift|work=igc.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Camp Activities for Relationship Building (pdf),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Camp Activities for Relationship Building|url=http://traubman.igc.org/campacts.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Public Peace Process of Change (pdf),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Public Peace Process of Change|url=http://traubman.igc.org/changechartsall.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; MEETING MOHAMMED: Beginning Jewish-Palestinian Dialogue (pdf),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MEETING MOHAMMED: Beginning Jewish-Palestinian Dialogue|url=http://traubman.igc.org/MeetingMohammedEng.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; STORY AS ENTRY TO RELATIONSHIP: Teacher's Guide (pdf),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=STORY AS ENTRY TO RELATIONSHIP: Teacher's Guide|url=http://traubman.igc.org/vidschoolguide.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; ENGAGING THE OTHER: Teacher's Guide (pdf)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ENGAGING THE OTHER: Teacher's Guide|url=http://traubman.igc.org/engagingtheother.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also see related Theses and documents of others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=related theses and documents of others|url=http://traubman.igc.org/theses.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The dialogue also maintains a web resource page referencing multi-lingual graphics that can be used by other groups wanting to use dialogue as a communication tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.masterpeace.org/blogs/post/useful_graphics_on_change_communication_and_relationships_of_peacebuilding|title=USEFUL MULTI-LINGUAL GRAPHICS for Change, Communication, and Relationships of Peacebuilding|work=masterpeace.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Karl Ludwig Sand''' ([[Wunsiedel]], [[Upper Franconia]] (then in [[Prussia]]), 5 October 1795 – [[Mannheim]], 20 May 1820) was a [[Germany|German]] university student and member of a liberal [[Burschenschaft]] (student association). He was executed in 1820 for the murder of the [[Conservatism|conservative]] dramatist [[August von Kotzebue]] the previous year in [[Mannheim]].   As a result of his execution, Sand became a martyr in the eyes of many German nationalists seeking the creation of a united German national state.

==Biography==
Karl Ludwig Sand was born to Gottfried Christoph Sand and his wife Dorothea Johanna Wilhelmina Schöpf (1766–1826), on 5 October 1795. His siblings were George, Fritz, Caroline and Julia.

===Education===
[[File:Wartburg-Studentenzug-1817.jpg|thumb|Students marching towards the Wartburg, of which Sand was one.]]
In 1804 he attended the ''Lateinschule'' (Latin school) in [[Wunsiedel]] and in 1810 he moved on to the grammar school (''Gymnasium'') in [[Hof, Germany|Hof]], living with the school's rector, [[Georg Heinrich Saalfrank]], a friend of Sand's Enlightened Protestant family. Following the closure of the Hof Gymnasium on the institution of [[Montgelas]]'s Reforms, Sand followed his teacher to the Neues Gymnasium (New Grammar School) in [[Regensburg]], completing his studies in September 1814. In November 1814 Sand matriculated at the [[Eberhard Karls University of Tübingen|University of Tübingen]]. 

In 1815, Sand volunteered under Major von Falkenhausen, participating in the [[Battle of Waterloo]] in June and in Paris by July. He returned from the war disillusioned with its results and fell into a deep depression. In 1816, while at the [[University of Erlangen]], Sand formed Burschenschaft Teutonia with his friend Dittmar, meeting at castle ruins near Erlangen which they had named Ruttli. They built a meeting house for their group of 80 students. Sand's depression was further intensified by the destruction of Ruttli by the competing political group the Landmannschaft and the drowning death of Dittmar in 1817. Starting in 1817 he studied at the [[University of Jena]], attending the lectures of [[Jakob Friedrich Fries]], [[Heinrich Luden]] and [[Lorenz Oken]] and joining further Burschenschaften. Sand was among the nationalist students who gathered at the 1817 [[Wartburg festival]], in which Kotzebue's ''History of the German Empires'' was one of the [[book burning|books ceremoniously burned]].

===Murder of August von Kotzebue===
[[File:Ermordung August von Kotzebues.jpg|thumb|Illustration of Sand's attack on Kotzebue.]]
Sand already contemplated the murder of [[August von Kotzebue]] in a diary entry of 5 May 1818. He called him a "traitor to the nation" and a "deceiver of the people" and characterized him as an enemy of the Burschenschaft. 

On the morning of 23 March 1819 Sand, using the pseudonym Henry, visited Kotzebue in his Mannheim house. Refused entry to the house and told to return in the afternoon, Sand returned just before five o'clock. Having exchanged just a few words with Kotzebue, Sand produced a dagger and, with the words "Here, you traitor to the fatherland!", stabbed him repeatedly in the chest. Surprised by Kotzebue's four-year-old son witnessing the event from the nursery, Sand lost his wits and stabbed himself. Leaving the house, he handed a servant a piece of writing he had prepared ''("Death to August von Kotzebue")'', and stabbed himself again in the street. His suicide attempt failed, and he was taken to hospital.

==Aftermath==
The Mannheim ''Hofgericht'' (court of law) sentenced Sand to death on 5 May 1820. He was [[beheading|beheaded]] by [[Franz Wilhelm Widmann]], who was the [[executioner|official executioner]] at the time.
[[File:Sands Hinrichtung.png|thumb|The execution of Karl Ludwig Sand.]]
[[File:Klsand-Grab.JPG|thumb|200px|His grave in Mannheim]]
Sand's murder of Kotzebue was a catalyst for government restrictions on liberal and German nationalist thought. On 20 September 1819 [[Prince Klemens Wenzel von Metternich]] called a meeting of representatives from across the [[German Confederation]] to create the [[Carlsbad Decrees]] which outlawed the Burschenschaften and put limits on freedom of the press and the rights of members of such organizations, banning them from public office, teaching or studying at universities.&lt;ref name=Carlsbad&gt;[http://www.milestonedocuments.com/documents/full-text/carlsbad-decrees Full text of Carlsbad Decrees]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alexandre Dumas, père]] wrote about Sand's life and published excerpts from his journals and letters in ''Karl Ludwig Sand'',&lt;ref name=Dumas&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/2745 ''Karl Ludwig Sand''] by Alexandre Dumas, père&lt;/ref&gt; part of ''Celebrated Crimes''.&lt;ref name=Crimecelebre&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/2760 ''Celebrated Crimes''], Alexandre Dumas, père&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to writing his story, Dumas visited Widmann's son in [[Mannheim]] in 1838 to gather information about Sand's character. [[Alexander Pushkin]] also memorialized Sand in his poem about assassins entitled "Kinzhal" (The Dagger).&lt;ref name=Terras&gt;Terras, Victor, ''Handbook of Russian literature By Victor Terras'' page 96&lt;/ref&gt; In Germany three films have been made concerning the events of Karl Sand's life: ''Karl Sand'' in 1964, ''Sand'' in 1971, and ''Die Unbedingten'' in 2009.

'''The Karnataka Quiz Association''' (or KQA) was founded in 1983 by the late Wing Commander G.R.Mulky, Deepak Murdeshwar, Rajeev Gowda, Thomas Uthup, K.N.Mahabala, Thribhuvan Kumar, P.Raju and Jagadish Raja&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kqaquizzes.org/about/|title=About KQA|work=Karnataka Quiz Association|accessdate=2011-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  is a non-profit association devoted to popularizing the mindsport among students and the general public in Bangalore and beyond. Contests are held regularly in the following categories: Middle School, High School, Junior College, College, and Open-to-all. In addition, specialist quizzes in the areas of Literature, Entertainment, Music, Art, Comics and Business are held every year.

The KQA holds events in [[English language|English]] and [[Kannada]].

Apart from holding contests, the KQA also conducts workshops in quizzing for school students and provides quizmasters for events held by other organisations.

The KQA has an informal membership policy. People interested in quizzing sign up to receive a free email newsletter about forthcoming contests. The newsletter goes out to about 2000 people at present.

KQA quizzes normally used to take place once every month at the [[Daly Memorial Hall]], a charming British-era building on Nrupatunga Road. Now, however the venue has shifted to Arakere Hall(also known as the IAT Hall) on Queen's Road.

KQA's flagship event, [[ASKQANCE]], is held in the third week of June every year and comprises three quizzes, one each in the School, Corporate and Open Categories. The KQA also holds a solo quiz titled [[Mahaquizzer]] as well as a solo quiz event called MindSweep across India's several quizzing cities annually. Since 2003, the KQA has collaborated with the TI Foundation in conducting the [[Jack Kilby Quiz]] in Science and Technology for high school students.

== ASKQANCE ==
The quizzing season in Bangalore has always begun with an open quiz in June to mark the anniversary of the founding of the KQA. This tradition was reworked around the time of the 20th anniversary in 2003 to include a School Quiz, a Corporate Quiz and the customary Open Quiz. This festival of quizzing was christened ASKQANCE to celebrate the ethic of thinking laterally and working things out. ASKQANCE draws teams from other quizzing centres such as Chennai, Hyderabad, Cochin, New Delhi and Pune.

== The Texas Instruments Science and Technology Quiz ==
The TI Foundation has conducted a quiz in science and technology for school students since 2003 in collaboration with the KQA. The quiz was originally named after Nobel laureate [[Jack Kilby]] who designed the first [[Integrated Circuit]] while working for [[Texas Instruments]] but is now known by the name of the company. The first three editions of the quiz, hosted by Ochintya Sharma, were held in Bangalore, and attracted participation from more than 200 schools in the region. The quiz went national in 2006, with winners from Bangalore, Chennai and New Delhi facing off at a grand finale in Delhi.In the year 2008, the contest was extended to two more cities - Pune and Kolkata.

The quiz is a solo championship requiring contestants to try out 150 questions over 90 minutes on the same day at different venues across the country. The first edition of the quiz was held in Bangalore, Chennai, Hyderabad, Thiruvananthapuram and Mumbai. The quiz was extended to New Delhi, Pune and Kolkata in 2006 while Bhubaneshwar became a venue in 2007.

The '''Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya''' or '''KGBV''' is a residential girls’ [[secondary school]] run by [[Government of India]] for the weaker sections in India

==History==
It was a scheme was introduced by the [[Government of India]] in August 2004, then integrated in the [[Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan]] program, to provide educational facilities for girls belonging to [[Scheduled Castes]], [[Scheduled Tribes]], [[Other Backward Class]]es, minority communities and families below the [[poverty line]] in Educationally Backward Blocks.&lt;ref name=indg&gt;[http://www.indg.in/primary-education/women-and-education/guidelines-for-implementation-of-kasturba-gandhi-balika-vidyalaya/ Revised Guidelines for Implementation of Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya (KGBVs)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419180758/http://www.indg.in/primary-education/women-and-education/guidelines-for-implementation-of-kasturba-gandhi-balika-vidyalaya |date=2012-04-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objective==
Gender disparities still persist in rural areas and among disadvantaged communities. Looking at enrolment trends, there remain significant gaps in the enrollment of girls at the elementary level as compared to boys, especially at the upper primary levels. The objective of KGBV is to ensure that quality education is feasible and accessible to the girls of disadvantaged groups of society by setting up residential schools with boarding facilities at elementary level.&lt;ref name=indg /&gt;

==Eligibility==
The scheme was applicable since inception in 2004, in Educationally Backward Blocks (EBBs) where the rural female literacy is below the national average (46.13%: Census 2001) and gender gap in literacy is more than the national average (21.59%: Census 2001). Among these blocks, schools may be
set up in areas with:
# concentration of tribal population, with low female literacy and/or a large number of girls out of school;
# concentration of SC, OBC and minority populations, with low female literacy and/or a large number of girls out of school;
# areas with low female literacy; or
# areas with a large number of small, scattered habitations that do not qualify for a school

The criteria of eligible blocks has been revised with effect from 1 April 2008 to include the following:
* An additional 316 Educationally backward blocks with rural female literacy below 30%; and 
* 94 Towns/cities having minority concentration (as per the list identified by Ministry of Minority Affairs) with female literacy rate below the national average (53.67%: Census 2001).

==Coverage==
[[File:Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya nayagaon sonpur bihar.jpg|thumb|right|Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya, [[Nayagaon, Bihar]], sonpur]]
The scheme has been implemented in 28 states and union territories: [[Assam]], [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Telangana]], [[Arunachal Pradesh]], [[Bihar]], [[Chhattisgarh]], [[Dadra and Nagar Haveli]], [[Delhi]], [[Gujarat]], [[Haryana]], [[Himachal Pradesh]], [[Jammu and Kashmir]], [[Jharkhand]], [[Karnataka]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[Maharashtra]], [[Manipur]], [[Meghalaya]], [[Mizoram]], [[Nagaland]], [[Odisha]], [[Punjab, India|Punjab]], [[Rajasthan]], [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Tripura]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Uttarakhand]] and [[West Bengal]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ssa.nic.in/girls-education/kasturba-gandhi-balika-vidyalaya/kgbv-scheme/ Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidhayalaya (KGBV) Scheme detail]&lt;/ref&gt;

2578 KGBVs were sanctioned by Government of India.&lt;ref name=renamed_from_2_on_20170321214147&gt;[http://www.pib.nic.in/newsite/mbErel.aspx?relid=94614|date=April 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, 427 KGBVs have been sanctioned in Muslim concentration blocks, 612 in ST blocks, 688 in SC blocks. A total of 750 residential schools would be opened in educational backward blocks. 75% entrollment is reserved for girls from SC, ST, OBC and Minority communities and the other 25% to girls from families below the poverty line.

'''King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences''' (KSAU-HS) ([[Arabic]]: '''جامعة الملك سعود بن عبد العزيز للعلوم الصحية''') is the first public university in the [[Kingdom of Saudi Arabia]] and the Middle East region specialized in health sciences. Its headquarters is in the main campus in [[Riyadh]], the capital of [[Saudi Arabia]].  It has two other campuses both in [[Jeddah]] and [[Al-Hasa|Al-Ahsa]]. All of the campuses are located inside the parameters of [[King Abdulaziz Medical cities]], and are overseen by the Saudi [[National Guard Health Affairs]].

==History==
The university was formally established in 2005 as a result of the positive feedback from the postgraduate programs in various medical fields that had been offered by the National Guard Health Affairs ([http://www.ngha.med.sa/English/Pages/default.aspx NGHA]) since the mid-1980s.  The advanced medical facilities at the King Abdulaziz Medical Cities in Riyadh, Jeddah and Al-Ahsa proved to be critical foundations for the successful inception of the university.

KSAU-HS’s main campus is in Riyadh with two additional campuses in Jeddah and Al-Ahsa. The main campus in Riyadh hosts seven colleges: College of Medicine, College of Dentistry, College of Pharmacy, College of Public Health and Health Informatics, College of Applied Medial Sciences, College of Nursing and the College of Science &amp; Health Professions. Jeddah Campus hosts College of Medicine, College of Nursing, College of Applied Medical Sciences and College of Sciences and Health Professions. Finally, Al-Ahsa Campus hosts College of Applied Medical Sciences, College of Nursing, and College of Sciences and Health Professions.

The umbrella of NGHA has given the KSAU-HS students access to King Abdulaziz Medical Cities in Riyadh, Jeddah and Al-Ahsa, which are considered to be the most advanced medical complexes in the region. Furthermore, it has enabled KSAU-HS to enhance its curricula and academic programs with clinical applications and training under health professionals.

==Campuses==

===Riyadh===
The campus is in the east of [[Riyadh]] and officially opened in April 2013.&lt;ref name=trolleymotion2013&gt;{{cite web|last=Lehmann|first=J.|title=Riad/Riyadh [SA] - Opening of the New Campus of the King Saud bin Abdulaziz University|url=https://old.trolleymotion.eu/index.php?id=38&amp;L=3&amp;n_ID=1783|date=6 May 2013|publisher=TrolleyMotion|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its design is a mix of contemporary and Islamic architecture. The campus has a capacity of ten thousand students, but it can accommodate future increase in student enrolment.

There is a large landscaping area connecting the buildings with footpaths.  In addition, there is a [[trolleybus]] line that connects the main areas of the campus with the housing compound.&lt;ref name=trolleymotion2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=trolleybusmagazine310&gt;''Trolleybus Magazine'' No. 310 (July–August 2013), p. 110.

==International collaboration==

KSAU-HS has a number of agreements and memoranda for [[academic collaboration]] with reputable [[North American]], [[Europe]]an, and [[Australian]] universities and institutions.

Memorandum of understanding with Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of [[Canada]], for the establishment of a Collaborating Center for [[CanMEDS]] competencies in Saudi Arabia. It will serve as the hub of a network of medical educators, trainers, and faculty committed to support, develop, and facilitate [[CanMEDS]] in all domain of medical education at both undergraduate, and postgraduate levels, as well as in the professional practice.	 	

The center will host and present a series of conferences &amp; workshops on residency training, and develop network of medical educators, and deliver education and training to the trainees in postgraduate medical education programs in [[Saudi Arabia]]. In Nov 2010, KSAU-HS hosted The Saudi Arabian Conference on Residency Education (SACRE). This conference was a landmark event that highlighted the collaboration KSAU-HS has with the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada. Topic discussed in the conference program included key trends in development of residency education, quality in residency program, contemporary and emerging tools for assessment of resident competence, simulation technology to teaching &amp; learning in postgraduate medical education, teaching the domains of physician competence using the CanMEDS framework, best research in residency education, new approaches for enhancing excellence in teaching and assessment in residency, current controversies in residency education and the implications for their own program.

[[The Association for Medical Education in the Eastern Mediterranean Region]] (AMEEMR) selected King Saud bin Abdulaziz University to be its headquarters. This decision came at the Association’s 2010 General Assembly, which College of Medicine at KSAU-HS hosted. Twenty-three representatives from fifteen countries and a representative for President of [[World Federation for Medical Education]] (WFME) attended the meeting.

KSAU-HS has a number of licensing agreements to develop its academic programs with prestigious universities worldwide: [[University of Sydney]] (Australia); [[University of Liverpool]] (UK); [[South Alabama University]] (USA); [[Flinders University]] (Australia); [[University of Arkansas]] (USA), [[Thomas Jefferson University]] (USA) [[University of Maryland]] (USA), [[Maastricht University]] (Netherlands), The [[University of Oklahoma]] (USA) and the [[University of Tennessee Health Science Center]] (USA).

'''King Sejong Institute''' ({{ko-hhrm||hangul=세종학당|hanja=|mr=|rr=Sejong Hakdang}}) is the brand name of [[Korean language|Korean-language]] institutes established by the [[Government of South Korea|South Korean government]] around the world since 2007. The institute's name refers to [[Sejong the Great]], the inventor of the Korean alphabet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/interview/2017/12/18/28/0800000000AEN20171218005600315F.html|title=King Sejong Institute seeks more overseas branches|last=|first=|date=2017-12-18|work=Yonhap News Agency|access-date=2018-08-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of June 2018, there were 174 King Sejong Institutes in 57 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.ksif.or.kr/ste/ksf/hkd/lochkd.do?menuNo=21101800|title=Global King Sejong|website=King Sejong Institute Foundation|access-date=2018-08-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

===Early Korean language teaching===
[[Hangul]], the Korean alphabet, is the written form of the official Korean language and has been used by Koreans since its creation in 1446 by [[Sejong the Great]] of the [[Joseon Dynasty]]. Most Korean language learning institutions outside Korea targeted second or third generation descendants of Korean immigrants, while Korean-language learners in South Korea were mostly foreign students, migrant workers, or spouses of Koreans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Seoul to establish Korean language centers in labor-exporting countries  |work= [[Yonhap News]]|date=|url= http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/national/2011/04/12/11/0302000000AEN20110412004700315F.HTML |accessdate=2012-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Gov't steps up efforts to encourage Korean language study overseas |work= [[Yonhap News]]|date=|url= http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/culturesports/2011/10/06/94/0701000000AEN20111006003800315F.HTML|accessdate=2012-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rising numbers of Korean learners===
The last twenty years has seen a rise in interest and demand for the Korean language due to cultural and commercial globalisation and the Internet/Communications Revolution. International interest in Korean culture such as [[Korean drama|dramas]] and music has increased tremendously, especially in Asia, leading to what has been termed the "[[Korean Wave]]". This has been accompanied by an increase in foreign students studying in Korea. Demographically there has also been an increase in marriages between Koreans and foreigners.

With the increase in international cooperation and business, the South Korean government has been striving to standardize the names of locations, people, and other proper nouns in Hangul. Also, there was a need for more up-to-date Korean dictionaries, as most were made during the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= 30 More Korean Language Centers to Open Around the World |work=[[Chosun Ilbo]]|date=|url= http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2012/01/27/2012012701031.html|accessdate=2012-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Gov't to Promote Korean Language, Taekwondo |work=[[Chosun Ilbo]]|date=|url= http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2009/03/18/2009031861030.html|accessdate=2012-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Establishment of "Sejonghakdang"===

With such demand, the South Korean government established the concept of "Sejonghakdang" so as to provide integrated and standardised information and service for learning the Korean language as well as to coordinate and expand the institutes where people can learn or teach it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koreaherald.com/national/Detail.jsp?newsMLId=20091010000017 |title=Lee vows to spread Hangeul |language=ko |publisher=Koreaherald.com |date=2010-03-30 |accessdate=2012-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sejonghakdang will be developed as ''the'' [[brand]] commonly used by all Korean language education institutes.{{According to whom|date=May 2017}} The South Korean government has recently{{When|date=May 2017}} launched its homepage at Sejonghakdang.org in Korean and [[English language|English]].

==Logo==
Sejonghakdang is represented its symbol as shown. The shape &lt;ㅎ&gt; symbolizes hangul and the shape on the left shoulder of ㅎ means the name and the initial of each city where the institute is located. The example here is Sejonghakdang in Seoul ([[Hangul]]: 서울), having 'ㅅ' on the left shoulder which indicates the first hangul letter of '서울'.

==Activities==

===Integration and expansion of Hangul Institutes===
The South Korean government integrated the Korean Language Institutes being called with various names into one brand "Sejonghakdang". For a short-term strategy, the government is to encourage to use the name "Sejonghakdang" and the standard textbook and course, while reviewing a long-term strategy to run an integrated language institute.

144 institutes have been established by the year 2016. Nine more institutes have been newly established in countries such as [[Latvia]], [[Myanmar]], [[Bahrain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dongponews.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=31742 |title=라트비아·미얀마·바레인 등 세종학당 9개소 신규 지정 |publisher=dongponews |date= |accessdate=2016-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, a new institute was added in the United States in Irvine, California. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/korea-sponsored-school-americans-learn-language-k-pop-dramas-more-n913421|title=At a Korea-sponsored school, Americans learn the language with K-pop, dramas and more NBC News 2018-10-08 &lt;/ref&gt;  
The "Sejonghakdang" headquarters office was established in 2012 to systematically support the institutes around the world. The office works to be the focal point that connects the institutes around the world.

===Nuri-Sejonghakdang===
Nuri-Sejonghakdang is a website providing a remote education system and integrated information service related to Korean language study for [[Hangul]] learners and teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Korean language Web site adds service in Russian, Indonesian |work= [[Yonhap News]]|date=|url= http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/national/2012/04/04/95/0302000000AEN20120404001500315F.HTML |accessdate=2012-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sejonghakdang.org |title=Nuri-Sejonghakdang |publisher=www.sejonghakdang.org |date= |accessdate=2015-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a Korean study website built jointly by various ministries within the South Korean government, including the [[Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism]], Ministry of Education, Science, and Technology, [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (South Korea)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade]], [[Ministry of Health and Welfare (South Korea)|Ministry of Health and Welfare]], Ministry of Justice, and National Institute of the Korean Language, National Institute for International Education, The Overseas Koreans Foundation and International Korean Language Foundation with Presidential Council on Nation Branding as the main contributor.

'''Live Campus''' is a student-led fundraising initiative, benefiting non-governmental organizations working to eradicate [[extreme poverty]]. Its main fundraising model will be a series of concerts hosted by student run organizations on a designated weekend. Live Campus is an official initiative of the Millennium Campus Network.

== Live Campus 09 ==
Live Campus 09 will be the inaugural event of Live Campus over the weekend of April 3, 2009. There are currently projected to be 23 participating schools.

== LiveCampus.org ==
In anticipation of the series of benefit concerts, LiveCampus.org will act as a networking platform for students and concert coordinators. As an option to concert coordinators, LiveCampus.org can serve as a pledge tracker for their concert. Students can register at the site, and record their pledges for concerts they are attending. Students also have the option of recording pledges in teams.

MERLOT consists of a community of staff (at The California State University, Office of the Chancellor), volunteers, and members who work together in various ways to provide users of OER (Open Educational Resource) teaching and learning materials with a wealth of services and  functions that can enhance their instructional experience.

==History==
{{refimprove section|date=February 2016}}
The MERLOT project began in 1997, when the California State University Center for Distributed Learning (CSU-CDL at www.cdl.edu) developed MERLOT. Under the leadership of Chuck Schneebeck, CSU-CDL's Director at the time, MERLOT was modeled after the NSF funded project, "Authoring Tools and An Educational Object Economy (EOE)". Led by Dr. James Spohre and hosted by Apple Computer, and other industry, university, and government collaborators, the EOE developed and distributed tools to enable the formation of communities engaged in building shared knowledge bases of learning materials.

In 1998, a State Higher Education Executives Organization/American Productivity and Quality Center (SHEEO/APQC) benchmarking study on faculty development and instructional technology selected the CSU-CDL as one of six best practices centers in North America. Visitations to the CSU-CDL by higher education institutions participating in the benchmarking students resulted in interest in collaborating with the CSU on the MERLOT project. The University of Georgia System, Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education, University of North Carolina System, and the California State University System created an informal consortium representing almost one hundred campuses serving over 900,000 students and over 47,000 faculty. SHEEO was the coordinator for the cooperative of the four state systems.

In 1999, the four systems recognized the significant benefits of a cooperative initiative to expand the MERLOT collections, conduct peer reviews of the digital learning materials, and add student learning assignments. Each system contributed $20,000 in cash to develop the MERLOT software and over $30,000 in in-kind support to advance the collaborative project. The CSU maintained its leadership of and responsibilities for the operation and improvement of processes and tools.In January, 2000, the four systems sponsored 48 faculty from the disciplines of Biology, Physics, Business and Teacher Education (12 faculty from each of the four systems) to develop evaluation standards and peer review processes for online materials in the MERLOT collection.

In April, 2000, other systems and institutions of higher education were invited to join the MERLOT cooperative. In July, 2000, twenty-three (23) systems and institutions of higher education had become Institutional Partners of MERLOT. Each Institutional Partner contributed $25,000 and in-kind support for eight faculty and a project director (part-time) to coordinate MERLOT activities. The CSU continued its leadership of and responsibilities for the operation and improvement of processes and tools.

In 2009, MERLOT took over The [[Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching]]'s KEEP Toolkit&lt;ref name="Maki"&gt;{{cite book|last=Maki|first=Peggy|title=Assessing for learning: building a sustainable commitment across the institution|year=2010|publisher=Stylus Pub|location=Sterling, VA|isbn=1579224415}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it became the MERLOT Content Builder.  At that time, any KEEP Toolkit user who wished to maintain their web pages could become a MERLOT member and automatically have their projects migrated and hosted by MERLOT.

==Professional Involvement==

MERLOT has been particularly influential in the development of online education&lt;ref name=Carbonara&gt;{{cite book|title=Technology literacy applications in learning environments|year=2005|publisher=Information Science Pub.|location=Hershey, PA|isbn=1591404800|editor=David D.

==MERLOT Volunteer Staff==
{{refimprove section|date=February 2016}}
Members of MERLOT communities are vital to its success. Community Members help grow the MERLOT collection by contributing materials, and adding assignments and comments.  Additionally, they introduce others in the discipline to MERLOT by presenting at conferences, authoring articles about MERLOT, and encouraging others to use and contribute to MERLOT. 
  
Volunteer community Members work with  MERLOT staff to develop policies and practices that govern MERLOT's operations.  These volunteers are member of Editorial Boards and Project Directors.

===Editorial Boards===
Editorial boards are the cornerstones of MERLOT. They lead the development of MERLOT's discipline communities.  There is one Editorial Board for each community, composed of an Editor, Associate Editors and Peer Reviewers.

Editors, Associate Editors, and peer reviewers are nominated by System Partners, Campus Partners, and the MERLOT Management Team. Many peer reviewers are those who volunteer their own time to review for MERLOT.  All MERLOT editorial board members are faculty with:
* Expertise in the scholarship of their field
* Excellence in teaching
* Experience in using technology in teaching and learning
* Connections to professional organizations in their discipline.

Each editorial board is responsible for:
* Expanding and managing the collection of online learning materials in its discipline.
* Educating and reaching out to the community of educators in its discipline.
* Implementing and managing the MERLOT peer review process for materials in its discipline.
* Recruiting and training peer reviewers.

===Project Directors===
The MERLOT Leadership Council is composed of all of the Project Directors from System and Campus Partners, along with Editors from each of the MERLOT Discipline Communities. Project Directors have critical responsibilities in managing their institution's participation in MERLOT and MERLOT's connection to their institution's academic technology initiatives. Responsibilities of Project Directors include participation in MERLOT's governance activities, selection of Editors and editorial board members, supervision of editorial board members, and management of their institutions' partnership with MERLOT. MERLOT provides Project Directors with online tools and analytics to assist them in monitoring their members' participation in MERLOT.

== MERLOT Communities ==
Members of MERLOT are part of a variety of communities that are vital to MERLOT's success. Community members help grow the MERLOT collection by contributing materials and adding assignments and comments.  Additionally, they introduce others in the discipline to MERLOT by presenting at conferences, authoring articles about MERLOT, and encouraging others to use and contribute to MERLOT.  MERLOT Partners are also critical of the growth of the MERLOT community.   
  
These communities are categorized as:  
* [http://info.merlot.org/merlothelp/index.htm#academic_discipline_communities.htm Academic Discipline Communities] 
* [http://info.merlot.org/merlothelp/index.htm#academic_support_communities.htm Academic Support Communities]  
* [http://info.merlot.org/merlothelp/index.htm#partner_communities.htm Partner Communities]

Promoting Community Relations 
MERLOT encourages interaction among its Members by providing social networking services and functions that enable dialogue among Members.   For example, MERLOT Voices is MERLOT's community networking site, that enables Members to collaborate with all MERLOT Members who are interested in joining particular communities related to the missions of MERLOT  Members can join, can others to join, to participate in community conversations, customize their own Voices community webpage, and even add videos related to online learning and teaching.

===First competition in 1982===

The first Makridakis Competition, held in 1982, and known in the forecasting literature as the '''M-Competition''', used 1001 time series and 15 forecasting methods (with another nine variations of those methods included).&lt;ref name=m3m/&gt;&lt;ref name=m&gt;{{cite journal|title = The accuracy of extrapolation (time series) methods: results of a forecasting competition|journal = Journal of Forecasting|volume = 1|issue = 2|date = April–June 1982|pages = 111–153|author = Spyros Makridakis|doi = 10.1002/for.3980010202|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a later paper by the authors, the following were the main conclusions of the M-Competition:&lt;ref name=m3m/&gt;

# Statistically sophisticated or complex methods do not necessarily provide more accurate forecasts than simpler ones.
# The relative ranking of the performance of the various methods varies according to the accuracy measure being used.
# The accuracy when various methods are combined outperforms, on average, the individual methods being combined and does very well in comparison to other methods.
# The accuracy of the various methods depends on the length of the forecasting horizon involved.

The findings of the study have been verified and replicated through the use of new methods by other researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Forecasting demand for special services|last = Geurts|first = M.

This is what [[Rob J. Hyndman]], in his blog about "A brief history of time series forecasting competitions", had to say about the first M Competition: “… anyone could submit forecasts, making this the first true forecasting competition as far as I am aware.”[https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/forecasting-competitions/]

Newbold (1983) was critical of the M-competition, and argued against the general idea of using a single competition to attempt to settle the complex issue.&lt;ref name=newbold&gt;{{cite journal|title = The competition to end all competitions|last = Newbold|first = Paul|year = 1983|publisher = [[Journal of Forecasting]]|volume = 2|pages = 276–279}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Before the first competition, the Makridakis–Hibon Study====

Before the first M-Competition, Makridakis and Hibon&lt;ref name=nm&gt;{{cite journal|title = Accuracy of Forecasting: An Empirical Investigation|publisher = [[Journal of the Royal Statistical Society]]|volume = 142|date = 1979|pages = 97–145|jstor=2345077|author = Spyros Makridakis and Michele Hibon}}&lt;/ref&gt; published in the Journal of the Royal Statistical Society (JRSS) an article showing that simple methods perform well in comparison to the more complex and statistically sophisticated ones. Statisticians at that time criticized the results claiming that they were not possible. Their criticism motivated the subsequent M, M2 and M3 Competitions that prove beyond the slightest doubt those of the Makridakis and Hibon Study.

===Second competition, published in 1993===

The second competition, called the M-2 Competition or M2-Competition, was conducted on a grander scale. A call to participate was published in the ''[[International Journal of Forecasting]]'', announcements were made in the [[International Symposium of Forecasting]], and a written invitation was sent to all known experts on the various time series methods. The M2-Competition was organized in collaboration with four companies and included six macroeconomic series, and was conducted on a real-time basis. Data was from the United States.&lt;ref name=m3m/&gt; The results of the competition were published in a 1993 paper.&lt;ref name=m2&gt;{{cite journal|title = The M-2 Competition: a real-time judgmentally based forecasting study|journal = International Journal of Forecasting|author = Spyros Makridakis|date = April 1993|volume = 9|pages = 5–22|doi = 10.1016/0169-2070(93)90044-N|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results were claimed to be statistically identical to those of the M-Competition.&lt;ref name=m3m/&gt;

The M2-Competition used much fewer time series than the original M-competition. Whereas the original M-competition had used 1001 time series, the M2-Competition used only 29, including 23 from the four collaborating companies and 6 macroeconomic series.&lt;ref name=m2/&gt; Data from the companies was obfuscated through the use of a constant multiplier in order to preserve proprietary privacy.&lt;ref name=m2/&gt; The purpose of the M2-Competition was to simulate real-world forecasting better in the following respects:&lt;ref name=m2/&gt;

* Allow forecasters to combine their trend-based forecasting method with personal judgment.
* Allow forecasters to ask additional questions requesting data from the companies involved in order to make better forecasts.
* Allow forecasters to learn from one forecasting exercise and revise their forecasts for the next forecasting exercise based on the feedback.

The competition was organized as follows:&lt;ref name=m2/&gt;
* The first batch of data was sent to participating forecasters in summer 1987.
* Forecasters had the option of contacting the companies involved via an intermediary in order to gather additional information they considered relevant to making forecasts.
* In October 1987, forecasters were sent updated data.
* Forecasters were required to send in their forecasts by the end of November 1987.
* A year later, forecasters were sent an analysis of their forecasts and asked to submit their next forecast in November 1988.
* The final analysis and evaluation of the forecasts was done starting April 1991 when the actual, final values of the data including December 1990 were known to the collaborating companies.

In addition to the published results, many of the participants wrote short articles describing their experience participating in the competition and their reflections on what the competition demonstrated. Chris Chatfield praised the design of the competition, but said that despite the organizers' best efforts, he felt that forecasters still did not have enough access to the companies from the inside as he felt people would have in real-world forecasting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = A personal view of the M2-competition|last = Chatfield|first = Chris|journal = [[International Journal of Forecasting]]|volume = 9|issue = 1|date = April 1993|pages = 23–24|doi = 10.1016/0169-2070(93)90045-O}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Fildes and Makridakis (1995) argue that despite the evidence produced by these competitions, the implications continued to be ignored by theoretical statisticians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = The impact of empirical accuracy studies on time series analysis and forecasting|last = Fildes|first = R.|last2 = Makridakis|first2 = Spyros|authorlink2 = Spyros Makridakis|journal = [[International Statistical Review]]|year = 1995|volume = 63|issue = 3|pages = 289–308|url = http://flora.insead.edu/fichiersti_wp/Inseadwp1993/93-29.pdf|doi=10.2307/1403481|jstor = 1403481}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Third competition, published in 2000===

The third competition, called the M-3 Competition or M3-Competition, was intended to both replicate ''and'' extend the features of the M-competition and M2-Competition, through the inclusion of more methods and researchers (particularly researchers in the area of [[neural network]]s) and more [[time series]].&lt;ref name=m3m/&gt; A total of 3003 time series was used. The paper documenting the results of the competition was published in the ''[[International Journal of Forecasting]]''&lt;ref name=m3m/&gt; in 2000 and the raw data was also made available on the [[International Institute of Forecasters]] website.&lt;ref name=m3-data/&gt; According to the authors, the conclusions from the M3-Competition were similar to those from the earlier competitions.&lt;ref name=m3m/&gt;

The time series included yearly, quarterly, monthly, daily, and other time series. In order to ensure that enough data was available to develop an accurate forecasting model, minimum thresholds were set for the number of observations: 14 for yearly series, 16 for quarterly series, 48 for monthly series, and 60 for other series.&lt;ref name=m3m/&gt;

Time series were in the following domains: micro, industry, macro, finance, demographic, and other.&lt;ref name=m3m/&gt;&lt;ref name=m3-data/&gt; Below is the number of time series based on the time interval and the domain:&lt;ref name=m3m/&gt;&lt;ref name=m3-data/&gt;

The five measures used to evaluate the accuracy of different forecasts were: [[symmetric mean absolute percentage error]] (also known as symmetric MAPE), average ranking, median symmetric absolute percentage error (also known as median symmetric APE), percentage better, and median RAE.&lt;ref name=m3m/&gt;

A number of other papers have been published with different analyses of the data set from the M3-Competition.&lt;ref name=m3-1/&gt;&lt;ref name=m3-2/&gt; According to [[Rob J. Hyndman]], Editor-in-Chief of the [[International Journal of Forecasting]] (IJF), “The M3 data have continued to be used since 2000 for testing new time series forecasting methods. In fact, unless a proposed forecasting method is competitive against the original M3 participating methods, it is difficult to get published in the IJF.”

===Fourth competition, started in Jan 1 2018, ended in May 31 2018.===

The M-Competitions have attracted great interest in both the academic literature and among practitioners, providing objective evidence of the most appropriate way of forecasting various variables of interest. The fourth competition, M4, was announced in November 2017[https://www.unic.ac.cy/news/announcing-m4-makridakis-4-forecasting-competition/]. The competition started in Jan 1 2018 and ended in May 31 2018. Initial results were published in the [International Journal of Forecasting] on June 21, 2018. The paper can be downloaded at the [ScienceDirect website[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169207018300785].

The M4 extended and replicated the results of the previous three competitions, using an extended and diverse set of time series to identify the most accurate forecasting method(s) for different types of predictions. It aimed to get answers on how to improve forecasting accuracy and identify the most appropriate methods for each case. To get precise and compelling answers, the M4 Competition utilized 100,000 real-life series, and incorporates all major forecasting methods, including those based on Artificial Intelligence (Machine Learning, ML), as well as traditional statistical ones.

In his blog, [[Rob J. Hyndman]] said about M4: “The “M” competitions organized by Spyros Makridakis have had an enormous influence on the field of forecasting. They focused attention on what models produced good forecasts, rather than on the mathematical properties of those models. For that, Spyros deserves congratulations for changing the landscape of forecasting research through this series of competitions."[https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/m4comp/]

Below is the number of time series based on the time interval and the domain:

In order to ensure that enough data are available to develop an accurate forecasting model, minimum thresholds were set for the number of observations: 13 for yearly, 16 for quarterly, 42 for monthly, 80 for weekly, 93 for daily and 700 for hourly series.

One of its major objectives was to compare the accuracy of ML methods versus that of statistical ones and empirically verify the claims of the superior performance of ML methods.

'''Below is a short description of the M4 Competition and its major findings and Conclusion:'''

The M4 Competition ended on May 31, 2018 and in addition to point forecasts, it included specifying Prediction Intervals (PI) too. M4 was an Open one, with its most important objective (the same with that of the previous three M Competitions): “to learn to improve forecasting accuracy and advance the field as much as possible”. This is in contrast to other ones, as those organized by Kaggle, where there is actually a “horse race” aimed at identifying the most accurate forecasting method(s) without attempting to discover the reasons involved in order to be able to improve forecasting performance in the future. 

'''The five major findings and the conclusion of M4:''' 

Below we outline what we consider to be the five major findings of the M4 Competition and advance a logical conclusion from these findings.

# The combination of methods was the king of the M4. Out of the 17 most accurate methods, 12 were “combinations” of mostly statistical approaches. 
# The biggest surprise, however, was a “hybrid” approach utilizing both Statistical and ML features. This method, produced the most accurate forecasts as well as the most precise PIs and was submitted by Slawek Smyl, Data Scientist at Uber Technologies. According to sMAPE, it was close to 10% (a huge improvement) more accurate than the Combination (Comb) benchmark of the Competition (see below). It is noted that in the M3 Competition (Makridakis &amp; Hibon, 2000) the best method was 4% more accurate than the same Combination.
# The second most accurate method was a combination of seven statistical methods and one ML one, with the weights for the averaging being calculated by a ML algorithm, trained to minimize forecasting error through holdout tests. This method was jointly submitted by Spain’s University of A Coruña and Australia’s Monash University.
# The first and the second most accurate methods also achieved an amazing success in specifying correctly the 95% PIs. These are the first methods we know that have done so and do not underestimate uncertainty considerably.
# The six pure ML methods submitted in the M4 performed poorly, none of them being more accurate than Comb and only one being more accurate than Naïve2. These results are in agreement with those of a recent study we published in PLOS ONE (Makridakis, et al., 2018).

The conclusion from the above findings is that the accuracy of individual statistical or ML methods is low and that hybrid approaches and combination of methods is the way forward in order to improve forecasting accuracy and make forecasting more valuable.

The five Machine Learning (ML) methods submitted in the M4 performed poorly, none of them being more accurate than the statistical benchmark and only one being more accurate than Naïve 2, a finding consistent with a paper published in PLOS ONE at the end of March 2018

==Offshoots==

===NN3-Competition===

Although the organizers of the M3-Competition did contact researchers in the area of [[artificial neural network]]s to seek their participation in the competition, only one researcher participated, and that researcher's forecasts fared poorly. The reluctance of most ANN researchers to participate at the time was due to the computationally intensive nature of ANN-based forecasting and the huge time series used for the competition.&lt;ref name=m3m/&gt; In 2005, Crone, Nikolopoulos and Hibon organized the NN-3 Competition, using 111 of the time series from the M3-Competition (not the same data, because it was shifted in time, but the same sources). The NN-3 Competition found that the best ANN-based forecasts performed comparably with the best known forecasting methods, but were far more computationally intensive. It was also noted that many ANN-based techniques fared considerably worse than simple forecasting methods, despite greater ''theoretical'' potential for good performance.&lt;ref name=n3&gt;{{cite web|url = http://forecasters.org/pdfs/IIF-SAS-Report-Apr2008.pdf|title = Automatic Modelling and Forecasting with Artificial Neural Networks– A forecasting competition evaluation|last = Crone|first = Sven F.|last2 = Nikolopoulos|first2 = Konstantinos|last3 = Hibon| first3 = Michele| date = 2005–06 &lt;!-- (published online April 2008) --&gt; | accessdate = April 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

===In books for mass audiences===

[[Nassim Nicholas Taleb]], in his book ''[[The Black Swan (2007 book)|The Black Swan]]'', references the Makridakis Competitions as follows: "The most interesting test of how academic methods fare in the real world was provided by Spyros Makridakis, who spent part of his career managing competitions between forecasters who practice a "scientific method" called econometrics -- an approach that combines economic theory with statistical measurements. Simply put, he made people forecast ''in real life'' and then he judged their accuracy. This led to a series of "M-Competitions" he ran, with assistance from Michele Hibon, of which M3 was the third and most recent one, completed in 1999. Makridakis and Hibon reached the sad conclusion that "statistically sophisticated and complex methods do not necessarily provide more accurate forecasts than simpler ones.""&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Fooled by Randomness|isbn = 978-0-8129-7521-5|author = Nassim Nicholas Taleb|year = 2005}}, Page 154, available for online viewing at [https://books.google.com/books?id=gWW4SkJjM08C&amp;pg=PA154&amp;lpg=PA154&amp;dq=tetlock+makridakis&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=v_AQFYPHkt&amp;sig=5Pd5x5rxiZrFaBjhrhBSPz1RiE0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=pzRlU5XYI4vJoATBlQE&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=tetlock%20makridakis&amp;f=false Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book ''Everything is Obvious'', Duncan Watts cites the work of Makridakis and Hibon as showing that "simple models are about as good as complex models in forecasting economic time series."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Everything is Obvious|author = Duncan Watts|isbn = 978-0307951793|year = 2011}}, Page 315&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4476">'''Mary Elizabeth Carnegie''' (April 19, 1916 – 20 February 2008) was an educator and author in the field of [[nursing]], known for breaking down racial barriers. She was the first black nurse to serve as a voting member on the board of a state nursing association. She was later president of the [[American Academy of Nursing]] and edited the journal ''Nursing Research''.

==Early life==
She was born in [[Baltimore, Maryland]], [[United States]], received a diploma from the Lincoln School of Nurses, bachelor's degree from [[West Virginia State College]], master's degree from [[Syracuse University]], and doctor of public administration degree from [[New York University]].&lt;ref name=Post/&gt;

==Career==
After receiving her bachelor's degree from West Virginia State College, Carnegie took a job in a hospital in Richmond, Virginia. She became a clinical instructor at St. Philip Hospital School of Nursing.  While working at St. Philip, Carnegie was exposed to a different social system in the nursing world in the south.

Carnegie joined the Florida Association of Colored Graduate Nurses (FACGN) in 1945. She was elected president of the organization three years later. Traditionally, the FACGN was named a courtesy (non-voting) board member of the Florida State Nurses Association the next year. After Carnegie's service with the FACGN, the FSNA board decided to grant her full rights and responsibilities on their board. She was the first black nurse to serve on the board of a state nursing association.&lt;ref name=Conversation&gt;{{cite news|title=A Conversation with Mary Elizabeth Carnegie|url=http://www.foundationnysnurses.org/media/courier/2006Carnegie-article.pdf|accessdate=July 24, 2014|work=NEAA Courier|publisher=Foundation of the New York State Nurses Association|date=Winter 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1945 and 1953, Carnegie was a professor and dean of the nursing school at [[Florida A&amp;M University]].&lt;ref name=Post/&gt; She later served as president of the [[American Academy of Nursing]] and was the editor of ''Nursing Research''. She was awarded eight honorary doctorates and was inducted into the hall of fame of the [[American Nurses Association]].&lt;ref name=Giger&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Giger|first1=Joyce N.|last2=Strickland|first2=Ora|title=In Memoriam: Dr. Mary Elizabeth Lancaster Carnegie, Phenomenal Woman, 1916-2008|journal=Nursing Research|date=June 2008|volume=57|issue=3|pages=133–134|url=http://www.nursingcenter.com/lnc/JournalArticle?Article_ID=794343#sthash.LmI0lXL0.dpuf|accessdate=July 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was inducted into the Virginia Nursing Hall of Fame in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://gallery.library.vcu.edu/exhibits/show/vanursinghalloffame/item/77968|title = Mary Elizabeth Carnegie|date = |accessdate = April 30, 2015|website = Virginia Nursing Hall of Fame|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After developing hypertensive cardiovascular disease, Carnegie died in 2008 in [[Chevy Chase, Maryland]]. She had lived there for 25 years. Carnegie had been married once; her husband died in 1954.&lt;ref name=Post&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sullivan|first1=Patricia|title=M.

'''Maximilian (Maximilien) Delphinius Berlitz''' (April 14, 1852 – April 6, 1921) was a linguist and the founder of the [[Berlitz Corporation|Berlitz Language Schools]], the first of which he established during 1878 in [[Providence, Rhode Island]]. 

==Life and career==
Born '''David Berlitzheimer''' of [[Jews|Jewish]] parents in [[Mühringen]], [[Württemberg]], Germany,&lt;ref name="Rose"&gt;{{cite web | last = Emily C.| first = Rose| authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Maximilian D. Berlitz (1852-1921)| work = Immigrant Entrepreneurship: German American Business Biographies| publisher = German Historical Institute| date = 19 June 2012| url = http://immigrantentrepreneurship.org/entry.php?rec=22| format = | doi = | accessdate = 29 September 2012}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adolf J. Schmid: ''„D.“ und der Mythos der Delphine - Maximilian D. Berlitz = David Berlizheimer'', in: „Schwäbische Heimat“, Jahrgang 2001/1, S. 44 ff., Stuttgart, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; he and his sister were soon orphaned, and he grew up in a family of educators in the [[Black Forest]]. {{fact|date=September 2012}} Berlitz was required by law to serve as an apprentice; he chose to work for a watchmaker for three years.&lt;ref name="Rose"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He later relocated to [[France]]{{fact|date=September 2012}} and then to [[Providence, Rhode Island]], [[United States]] during 1872.  His first employment was as a teacher of [[French language|French]] and [[German language|German]] at Warner Polytechnic College, of which he assumed control during 1878 when the owner of the school, Mr. Warner, disappeared with all the prepaid tuition money. {{fact|date=September 2012}} When Berlitz became ill, and was unable to teach a French class, he quickly hired Nicholas Joly to replace him and teach the class. Since he had always corresponded with Joly in French, he did not realize that Joly did not speak any [[English language|English]] until after he had hired him. Joly taught the class [[Language immersion|entirely in French]] (with no translation) by using gestures, pointing to objects and using tone of voice and facial expressions to convey meaning. Berlitz returned to the class six weeks later to find that his students, who had spoken little to no French before Joly began teaching, were conversing semi-fluently in French.&lt;ref name="LIFE"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Their pronunciation and grammar were also very good. Berlitz used this experience to develop the Berlitz Method, for which only the language to be taught is spoken from the first day of class. Students rely on the same techniques Joly used, rather than [[translation]], to gather meaning and learn [[grammar]] and [[vocabulary]].

After success, Berlitz opened a second [[language school]] in [[Boston]] during 1880, supplemented by others in New York and [[Washington, D. C.]] He went on to establish schools all over the U.S. and in many countries abroad. Between 1880 and 1900 he also began writing about his ideas, developing them into a systematic method, which he then presented during 1900 at the World's Fair in Paris. After the end of the century, he began travelling extensively, making headlines by teaching [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|German Emperor Kaiser Wilhelm II]] to speak English. Berlitz's fame continued to spread as he received medals of honor from the King of Spain,&lt;ref name="LIFE"&gt;{{Citation| last = Sellmer | first = Robert| author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | title = Berlitz Schools | newspaper = LIFE Magazine | pages = 58 | year = | date = 24 February 1947 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5kkEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA61&amp;lpg=PA61&amp;dq=Maximilian+Berlitz&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oQSMTLIsS3&amp;sig=2n2aoDM4Z-KYpeeS5RRrs_NE40Y&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=pkhnULJ05MPQAZ61gYgK&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBTgy#v=onepage&amp;q=Maximilian%20Berlitz&amp;f=false | archiveurl = | archivedate = | accessdate = 29 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the government of France, and from many international expositions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Maximilian D.

He is buried in [[Woodlawn Cemetery (Bronx, New York)|Woodlawn Cemetery]] in Bronx, New York.

Mr. Berlitz's method of language learning is still used.  Many books that were originally published during the early to mid 1900's are still in print.  There are also many schools that are still dedicated to continuing Mr. Berlitz's concepts regarding language learning.

The linguist and author [[Charles Berlitz]], his grandson, was for a time the CEO of [[Berlitz International]].

A '''mock election''' is an [[election]] organized for educational or transformative purposes. Often used in the creation of [[mock governments]], like school bodies, or online communities.

== Mock election for educational purposes ==

[[Secondary school]]s organize mock elections to introduce [[youth|young people]] to the concept of elections before they have reached their [[voting age]]. The elections will give the participants an understanding of [[democracy]], the role of government and parliament.
The experience of the mock elections plays a role in stimulating future young voters to cast their ballot.

They can have real candidates or fake candidates depending on the school and what year the mock election is.

== Mock election for change to democratic elections ==

As a way to introduce democratic [[elections in Bhutan]], in preparation for the [[Bhutanese general election, 2008|Bhutanese general election]] in 2008, a mock election was held on April 21, 2007 to prepare the Bhutanese for the imminent change to democracy.

'''Patrick J. Miller''' is a [[computer scientist]] and [[High-performance computing|high performance]] [[Parallel computing|parallel applications]] developer with a [[Ph.D.]] in Computer Science from [[University of California, Davis]], in [[run time (program lifecycle phase)|run-time]] [[error detection and correction]]. Until recently he was with [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]].

He is most noted for building and assembling the largest temporary [[supercomputer]] in the world, [[flash mob computing|FlashMob]] I, in an attempt to break into the Top 500 list of supercomputers with students from his "Do-it-yourself Supercomputing" class at the [[University of San Francisco]] in April 2004.  This effort was featured on the front page of the New York Times on February 23, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2005, he and others at [[Bryn Mawr College|Bryn Mawr]] recreated a FlashMob Supercomuter to calculate the value of [[pi]] to 15,000 digits and performed 15,800 steps to simulate the unfolding of a [[protein]] interacting with an [[anthrax]] toxin.
   
More recently he is the author of the popular [[pyMPI]] distributed parallel version of the [[Python (programming language)|Python]] programming language.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7908">'''Paul Nicholas Mason''' (born 1958) is an English-born Canadian [[novelist]], [[playwright]], and [[actor]].

Mason has published two plays, ''The Discipline Committee'' and ''Circles of Grace'' (1995), which have been produced in Canada, Ireland and the United States.  His play ''Sister Camille's Kaleidoscopic Cabaret'' won the Christians in Theatre Arts Full Length Play award in 1996, and premiered in [[Michigan]] in 1998.

Mason's first novel, ''Battered Soles'', was published by Turnstone Press in 2005. The novel celebrates a fictional pilgrimage from Peterborough, Ontario, to the small village of [[Lakefield, Ontario|Lakefield]], where there is, Mason asserts, a statue of a blue-skinned [[Jesus]] with healing powers in the basement of St. John's Anglican Church.  "Mason blends fiction with reality as he writes about taking this fictional pilgrimage...one weekend in July, 2003. By the time he takes this journey, it has become a mainstay tourist attraction (Swimmer 2006)."  In July 2005 the real-world rector of St. John's posted a notice advising confused tourists that there was no such statue in the basement of the church, but that "anyone wishing an encounter with the living Christ" should join the congregation at Sunday services.  The tone of the novel is comic: "More comedy than satire, it resounds of Horace rather than of Juvenal; Chaucer rather than Swift; Leacock rather than Richler (Gallagher 2005)"—but there are some moments of genuine pathos. It was nominated for the Stephen Leacock Medal for Humour in 2005.

Mason's second novel, ''The Red Dress'', was published by Turnstone in 2008.  The story of a seventeen-year-old young man growing up poor and confused in rural Ontario, it is significantly darker than ''Battered Soles,'' but the ending is cautiously hopeful.  ''The Red Dress'' is set in a village called Greenfield, but the landmarks and features of the community suggest that Mason has blended Lakefield, Ontario with Barriefield, just outside the city of [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]].  ''The Red Dress'' was long-listed for the 2009 ReLit award.

Mason's third novel, ''The Night Drummer'', was published by Vancouver's Now or Never in January 2015.  It is the story of two teenage friends—white middle-class Peter Ellis, and Otis James, a native boy adopted by an evangelical Christian couple old enough to be his grandparents.  Peter and Otis grow up in small town Ontario in the 1970s, and the novel follows them through their high school years.  "As Ellis sleeplessly anticipates his high school’s looming 25-year reunion, his recollections balance moments of encroaching darkness with plenty of joyous light," says Publishers Weekly. "Ellis’s memories of first loves and jobs and an endearingly oddball assortment of friends, including Otis, a preternaturally wise and kind Ojibwe boy adopted by devout Caucasian parents, give this portrait a welcome sweetness that draws attention to the innocence, sheer possibility, and blithe lightheartedness of youth." A later review in the Autumn 2017 issue of ''The Link'' reads, "The 1970s were a vibrant time of progressive change, and with its evocation of growing up in that wonderful era ''The Night Drummer'' makes for fascinating and entertaining reading.  Highly recommended." The book is endorsed by former American poet laureate [[Billy Collins]], the CBC's national correspondent [[Duncan McCue]], and the poet Kimmy Beach.

Mason's work is characterized by what one reviewer calls its "fragile optimism" (Gallagher 2005).  His plays and novels are informed by Christian belief, but are sometimes mildly profane.

Now or Never published Mason's first children's book, ''A Pug Called Poppy'', in the fall of 2017.

Mason began a new career in 2015 as a voice-, television- and film-actor. He has roles in the feature films ''Super Detention'', ''A Witches' Ball'', ''Santa's Castle'', ''Christmas with a Prince,'' ''Hometown Holiday'', ''A Dog in Paris'', ''The Customer'', ''Behanding'', ''The Mechanical Boy'', ''Bloodslinger'', ''Darts'' and ''Speak Your Mind.''

penveu is a pen-like device developed by American company [[Interphase Corporation]] for use with digital audiovisual presentations.

==History==
In 1991, [[SMART Technologies]] introduced an [[Interactive Whiteboard]], on which the image from a projector was displayed. A USB connection allowed the presenter to virtually interact with the projection. Other after-market products aimed at working with existing projectors, ([[Mimio]] and [[eBeam]]), came out after that.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Interphase Corporation (NASDAQ:INPH) was founded in 1974, and filed for Initial Public Offering in 1984. In 2010, penveu was invented. The company developed the concepts and tested them for two years until unveiling the product at the DEMO conference in Santa Clara, California on April 18, 2012. On May 30, 2014, it was released to the market. 

Since the product is made of two electronic boards (one in the handheld pen and one in the base station), the engineering department named those two boards: the PEN and the VEU, a video enhancement unit. PENVEU became the name of the device.

On September 30, 2015, Interphase Corporation announced it has ceased operations and commenced bankruptcy proceedings. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150930006889/en/Interphase-Corporation-Ceases-Operations-Files-Voluntary-Chapter&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology==
The core of the penveu technology surrounds a camera located near the tip of the pen, but is implemented in two parts of the penveu system: the PEN, and the VEU.  
The video signal (VGA) that comes from the computer towards the display device (projector or TV monitor) is intercepted by the VEU box.  Over there, visual targets are inserted into that video stream.  Those targets include position-encoded information, related to the location of each target within the display area.  The targets are inserted as increased brightness in one frame, and reduced brightness in the next frame.  Due to the [[flicker fusion threshold]], our eyes will not be able to observe those quick changes, and since the targets in one frame will compensate for the targets in the previous frame, our eyes will only see the “target-free” visual information.  The camera in the pen, on the other hand, subtracts consecutive frames.  As a result, the camera will only be sensitive to the targets themselves, while ignoring the “human visible” information (the content).  There is a powerful [[Digital signal processor]] (DSP) in the pen, which calculates the position of the tip based on the information retrieved from the targets detected. In the core of this technology is an engineering discipline from the area of Computer science called [[Computer Vision]].  Computer Vision is defined as “Computer vision is a field that includes methods for acquiring, processing, analyzing, and understanding images and, in general, high-dimensional data from the real world in order to produce numerical or symbolic information, e.g., in the forms of decisions”.  In the penveu case, this translates into the acquisition of the positioning information through the pen camera, and extracting the position of the tip relative to the displayed image based on that information, and then the interaction with the display object at that location or the dispensing on virtual ink at the location. This camera-based technology is also assisted with a MEMS-based inertial system for better accuracy and smoother performance.

As a result of the positioning targeting system being integrated with the displayed image, penveu never requires calibration.  Since the only installation required is the connection of the video (VGA) cable from the projector and computer into the penveu system, as well as USB and power—installation is very simple and does not require a professional, and the product is portable.  The product works with existing projector or flat panel display, does not require a new projector, and thus is very affordable.  Finally, it allows the presenter/teacher to move away from the display and “roam” around the classroom (or conference room), thus increasing interactivity between the presenter, audience, and content, increasing audience engagement.

==Patents==
The company was granted the first US patent (8,217,997)&lt;ref&gt;http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=5&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PTXT&amp;s1=8,217,997&amp;OS=8,217,997&amp;RS=8,217,997&lt;/ref&gt; on 7/10/2012, a second patent (8,446,364)&lt;ref&gt;http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;d=PTXT&amp;p=1&amp;p=1&amp;S1=8,446,364&amp;OS=8,446,364&amp;RS=8,446,364&lt;/ref&gt; on 5/21/2013, a third patent (8,982,050)&lt;ref&gt;http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&amp;r=2&amp;p=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;d=PTXT&amp;S1=(yoram+AND+solomon).INNM.&amp;OS=in/(yoram+and+solomon)&amp;RS=IN/(yoram+AND+solomon)&lt;/ref&gt; on March 17, 2015, a fourth patent (9,024,876)&lt;ref&gt;http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&amp;r=1&amp;p=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;d=PTXT&amp;S1=(yoram+AND+solomon).INNM.&amp;OS=in/(yoram+and+solomon)&amp;RS=IN/(yoram+AND+solomon)&lt;/ref&gt; on May 5, 2015.

The '''Royal School of Church Music''' (RSCM)  is a [[Christianity|Christian]] [[music education]] organisation dedicated to the promotion of [[church music|music in Christian worship]], in particular the repertoire and traditions of [[Anglican church music]], largely through publications, training courses and an award scheme. The organisation was founded  in England in 1927 by [[Sydney Nicholson|Sir Sydney Nicholson]]; today it operates internationally, with  8,500 members in over 40 countries worldwide, and is the largest church music organisation in Britain.&lt;ref name="presspack"&gt;{{cite web|title=Press Pack|url=http://www.rscm.com/wp-content/uploads/News/Press_pack.pdf|publisher=The Royal School of Church Music|accessdate=13 September 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170913155213/http://www.rscm.com/wp-content/uploads/News/Press_pack.pdf|archivedate=13 September 2017|date=2015|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The RSCM was originally named the School of English Church Music and was only open to members of the [[Anglican Communion]]; today it is an [[interdenominational]] organisation, although it is still overseen by the [[Church of England]].&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the RSCM|url=https://www.rscm.com/about-us/history-of-the-rscm/|website=RSCM: the Royal School of Church Music|accessdate=13 September 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170913155516/https://www.rscm.com/about-us/history-of-the-rscm/|archivedate=13 September 2017|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The Director is Hugh Morris (who began in 2018)

*President of the Royal School of Church Music in America is Bert Landman.
*President of RSCM Australia is Ross Cobb.
*President of RSCM South Africa is Malcolm Chalmers
*President of RSCM New Zealand is Paul Ellis.
*The patron is [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|the Queen]].

Choirs affiliated with the Royal School of Church Music often wear the RSCM [[medallion]], which features a picture of [[Saint Nicholas|Saint Nicolas]], its [[patron saint]].

==Awards and medals==

The RSCM provides a series of grades and awards to signify varying levels of musical achievement. There are four basic merit awards – the light blue ribbon, the dark blue ribbon, the red ribbon and the yellow ribbon. These awards share the same medal.

Beyond these are several medals awarded after successful coursework and examination:

* The Bronze award
* The Silver award
* The Gold award

The prerequisites of the Silver award are to hold either the Bronze award (or its predecessor the Dean's/Provost's award), to have attended an RSCM event as a member of the choir and it is suggested that the candidate have a Grade 3 Theory (ABRSM) level of understanding.

The prerequisites of the Gold award are once again, to hold the level below, to have completed an RSCM course (preferably residential) and it is suggested that a Grade 5 Theory (ABRSM) level of understanding. The ABRSM Grade 8 Singing is of an approximate level but the Gold award has a larger syllabus and does not require the candidate to commit pieces to memory. Unlike the grade 8, a candidate must also create an order of service for any event he or she wishes, with an appropriate music list.

The new awards are now available to choristers of any age and have been brought in to standardize the awarding process. There are many area based rules for the old medals, which will all disappear as the old award candidates decide not to wear their medals due to age.

Examples include
* in some areas a chorister may wear all medals at the same time while in others there is a limit of one.
* a red ribbon (S. Cecilia/Nicolas) may only be worn by those over 18 years in some areas, while other areas the highest medal always has a red ribbon.

The former medals are as follows…

For choristers up to the age of 16
* The Dean's/Provost's award
* The Bishop's Award
* The Junior S. Nicolas / S. Cecilia Awards
For Choristers up to the age of 21
* The Senior S. Nicolas / S. Cecilia Awards

Head Chorister and Deputy Head Chorister medals are also used by some choirs.

==History==
High school educator Noah Bopp founded SEGL in response to the September 11, 2001, attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=O'Connell |first=Jonathan |title=School for Ethics and Global Leadership uses DC as a setting to teach ethics |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/stories/2009/02/02/story9.html |access-date=June 30, 2012 |newspaper=Washington Business Journal |date=January 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; SEGL matriculated its first class of students on August 29, 2009. Since its inception, the school has graduated over 500 students.

==School life==
Students at SEGL take courses based on a block schedule. Students take Ethics and Leadership for two hours on Monday, all day Wednesday, and for two hours on Friday. Other courses have regular 50-minute and longer block periods. All students also take an introductory Arabic and Chinese language and culture course. Along with the specialized SEGL curriculum, students take courses that match sending school requirements. The school also hosts a Summer Institute and offers several summer international excursions.

Visits with prominent guest speakers are common. Guests have included Supreme Court Justice [[Clarence Thomas]], General [[Stanley A. McChrystal]], [[Egil "Bud" Krogh]], [[Carl Wilkens]], [[Lissa Muscatine]], [[Jack Abramoff]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/magazine/at-this-school-you-could-get-a-lecture-on-political-ethics--from-jack-abramoff/2017/02/21/f1964808-de92-11e6-918c-99ede3c8cafa_story.html|title=At this school, you could get a lecture on political ethics — from Jack Abramoff|website=Washington Post|access-date=November 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ambassador [[Mark Dybul]], Senator [[Chuck Schumer]], former White House Press Secretary [[Mike McCurry (press secretary)|Mike McCurry]], NRA President [[David Keene]], Governor [[Michael Dukakis]], and former President [[Barack Obama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://schoolforethics.org/news/ |title=General Stanley McChrystal, Former White House Chief Of Staff Josh Bolton, And Former Ceo Robert Kamerschen Visit Segl For Blockbuster "Crisis Management" Week |deadurl=no |access-date=January 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Tbilisi State Academy of Arts''' ({{lang-ka|თბილისის სახელმწიფო სამხატვრო აკადემია}}) is one of the oldest universities in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Caucasus]]. It is located in [[Tbilisi]] city near the [[Tbilisi Opera and Ballet Theatre ]] on [[Rustaveli avenue]].

== History ==
Based on the resolution of the [[People's Commissariat for Education|People’s Commissariat on Education]] of 8 March 1922, the Art Academy of Georgia was founded. Four faculties were established, those of painting, sculpture, graphic arts and architecture. In 1927 the department of ceramics was added. In 1922 Mose Toidze founded an art school providing training to the young people wishing to enter the Academy. The Academy is housed in the former Kobulashvili mansion, completely reconstructed and refurbished by the architect [[Simon Kldiashvili]] in 1902.
 
From the beginning, the teachers and professors of the academy were renowned artists; the first were [[Gigo Gabashvili]], [[Iakob Nikoladze]], [[Eugene Lanceray]], Joseph Sharlemagne, [[Henryk Hryniewski]], Egishe Tatevosyan, [[Nikolay Sklifosovskiy]], Nicholas Antadze, Anatoli Kalgin, Nikolay Severove, [[Dimitri Shevardnadze]], Michael Machavariani, Alexander Pitskhelauri, Michael Khananashvili, Boris Shebuev, Mose Toidze, Alexander Tsimakuridze, Nicholas Kandelaki, [[Valerian Sidamon-Eristavi]], [[David Kakabadze]], [[Lado Gudiashvili]], George Sesiashvili, [[Ucha Japaridze]], Shalva Amiranashvili, [[Apollon Kutateladze]], Vasili Shukhaev, [[Sergo Kobuladze]], [[Silovan Kakabadze]], Shota Mikatadze, David Tsitsishvili, Zakro Maisuradze, and Lado Grigolia.

[[File:From the archive of the Academy.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Gigo Gabashvili]] in the centre of photo, 1922.]]
The Tbilisi State Academy of Arts is located in the former “House of Arshakuni”, since 1922 (architect G. Ivanov. 1856). The interiors were designed  by Iranian masters (in [[Qajar art]] style) who were working in Tbilisi. In the same building (till 1937) there were placed the Ballet studio (the Mirror Hall) of [[Maria Perini]], the spouse of an artist [[Henryk Hryniewski]], as well as his own art studio; Studio of the academy professor – ''[[Gigo Gabashvili]]''; and Kobulashvili family flats.
In 1972 the new ten-floor academy block was built (architects A.Kurdiani, M. Chkhikvadze, L. Sumbadze, constructor D. Kajaia). In 2005–2006 the new block was restored by Cartu Bank .

'''Dr Timothy Francis Hawkes''' [[Order of Australia|OAM]] is a person, known for his contributions to Australian and International education. He is a former headmaster of [[The King's School, Parramatta]], stepping down from the post in 2017 after serving in the role for almost 20 years.

==Early life and education==

Born in Adelaide, South Australia in 1953, Hawkes' initial education was at Bordertown Primary and at the Woomera Area School. Because the family moved overseas, Hawkes completed his secondary education as a boarder at [[The King's School, Rochester]] in England where he became school captain.  He undertook undergraduate studies at [[Durham University]], England, graduating with a BEd (Hons) in 1975. He had a particular talent for sport, playing rugby for the University and participating in athletics at county level. While at university, Hawkes also participated in the 1973 British Undergraduates Expedition to the Jotenheim region of Norway and worked with opium and heroin drug addicts at the "Society of St. Stephen" in Hong Kong. After teaching at [[Loughborough Grammar School]] for five years, Hawkes returned to Australia in 1981 to teach at [[Knox Grammar School]] in Sydney, where he eventually became Senior Boarding Master.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Profile|url=http://www.timhawkes.com/sample-page/|website=Hawkes Eye|accessdate=23 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was during this time that a sexual assault (by another person) on a child under his care was not reported to police.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-03-05/kings-principal-outraged-at-handling-child-sex-abuse-at-knox/6284008 kings principal outraged at handling child sex abuse at knox].Sydney Morning Herald, 5 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; He undertook postgraduate studies at [[Macquarie University]] in Sydney where he obtained his PhD in May 1988. His thesis reflected his main teaching discipline which was Geography and was entitled 'A study of factors influencing children's ability to recognize features on black and white aerial photographs.' Hawkes also completed a Graduate Diploma in Education Administration at the [[University of New England (Australia)|University of New England]]

Hawkes met his wife, Jane, at Durham University in England and they have three adult children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,24106038-5017468,00.html At home with ... Timothy Hawkes, headmaster of The King's School in Sydney, writer and rugby tragic] The Australian. 1 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principal of St Leonard's College==
In 1989, Hawkes accepted the position of Principal of [[St Leonard's College (Melbourne)|St Leonard's College]], Melbourne, a co-educational independent school. During his time at St Leonard's, Hawkes engaged in a vigorous building program and raised enrolments from 1200 to nearer 1500. He also became the founding Chairman of the Heads of Independent Co-educational Schools of Victoria and was instrumental in establishing the Association of Co-Educational Schools sporting competition. Following on from a re-vitalisation of the International Baccalaureate program at St Leonard's, Hawkes served as a heads of school representative on the governing board of the International Baccalaureate Organisation.

==Headmaster of the King's School==
In 1998, Hawkes moved to Sydney to become headmaster of [[The King's School, Parramatta|The King's School]], an independent, [[Anglican]], day and boarding school for boys and Australia's oldest independent school. Soon after joining King's, he featured in the ABC documentary about the school and its new headmaster entitled 'King's School.' While at King's, Hawkes has rebuilt much of the School&lt;!--meaning what?--&gt; and has been an active contributor at many educational conferences both in Australia and overseas, including being a keynote speaker at the Headmaster's Conference (HMC) of Great Britain in 2003. His main focus is on the education of boys, and more recently the teaching of leadership skills to students. His works are largely confined to primary and secondary level education but he also comments on broader matters of social interest.&lt;ref&gt;"The Wealth Culture". Paper presented at the Stanley Foster Foundation Conference, Regent Hotel, Melbourne, 20 August 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Lie wrapped in a truth is still a lie". Sydney Morning Herald, 18 May 2006 p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Regular guest on Richard Glover's "Political Forum", ABC radio 702 AM.&lt;/ref&gt; His more recently published works include "Blizzard Lines", a novel that explores the relationship between a father and a son.

During the 1998, 2001 and 2004 Australian federal elections, Hawkes became an active participant in the national discussion on education with The King's School being frequently cited by the [[Australian Labor Party]] as an exemplar of a well-funded private school in receipt of significant government funding. Hawkes defended the right of independent schools, even well-resourced schools, to receive at least some government funding. This continued into the [[Australian federal election, 2007|2007 election]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/news/opinion/funds-squabble-impoverishes-schools/2007/11/16/1194766964910.html Funds squabble impoverishes schools], 17 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--On the 23 June, Hawkes finished his 18-year role as headmaster of the School. With a Farewell ceremony at The Sports Centre. He was replaced by Tony George (REF required)--&gt;

==Contribution to public debate==

Hawkes has made a strong contribution to educational debate. As the founding chair of the Australian Boarding Schools' Association, he has written "Duty of Care" the major training course for boarding staff used in Australia and has advanced the cause of boarding in the media.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/sunday-telegraph/posh-school-teaches-kids-how-to-clean/story-e6frewt0-1225748569493 Posh school teaches kids how to clean], The Sunday Telegraph, 12 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The boarding situation in Australia" Paper presented at the Boarding Schools' Association (BSA) Conference. Edinburgh, Scotland 2 May 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Boarding Schools' Resurgence "Directions in Education" Vol.10 No.11 29 June 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; A major authority on boys' education, Hawkes has been an advisor to the federal government, serving as a member of the "Forum on the Education of Boys" in 2002. His book "Boy Oh Boy" has become a best seller and Hawkes continues to write and speak extensively on the issue of educating boys.&lt;ref&gt;"Disinheriting wealth" Paper presented at the International Baccalaureate Conference, Chateau Laurier, Ottawa, Canada, 26 July 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Teaching Social Responsibility." Paper presented at the Association of Heads of Independent Schools of Australia Biennial Conference, Bond university, Gold Coast, 26 August 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Building a dynamic school community" Taylor's Education Conference, Sheraton Hotel, Subang Jaya, Malaysia, 29 March 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hawkes has been active in the area of values education and the development of leadership skills in students. His four book series "Learning Leadership" – a leadership training course for students- has become popular in many schools throughout the world. Several articles have been written by Hawkes advocating the teaching of leadership and values in schools.&lt;ref&gt;"Conversation with students on leadership" Independence. Autumn 1999 Vol. 24 No 1, p. 21+.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"New Model of Leadership launched at King's". Education Today, 30 August 2005, p30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Leadership for all students". Principal Matters, Spring 2007, p8+.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/ten-key-skills-schools-must-start-teaching/2008/09/08/1220725904072.html The Failure of Schools to Educate], Sydney Morning Herald, 8 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

No stranger to controversy, Hawkes has been a strong defender of independent education.&lt;ref&gt;"Reasons to fund private schools". The Age, 6 May 1993 p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Beware the politics of envy". ''Sydney Morning Herald'', 12 October 2000 p13.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, then-Federal [[Department of Education, Science and Training|Education Minister]] [[Brendan Nelson]] raised the prospect of teaching [[intelligent design]] in science classes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last = Wroe|first = David|date = 11 August 2005|title = 'Intelligent design' an option: Nelson|url = http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2005/08/10/1123353386917.html|newspaper = [[The Age]]|accessdate = 8 February 2017|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160825180040/http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2005/08/10/1123353386917.html|archive-date = 25 August 2016|dead-url = no}}&lt;/ref&gt; but quickly retreated to declare that religion or philosophy classes would be the only appropriate venue.&lt;ref name = IDinSMH&gt;{{cite news|last = Smith|first = Deborah|date = 21 October 2005|title = Intelligent design not science: experts|url = http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/intelligent-design-not-science-experts/2005/10/20/1129775902661.html|newspaper = [[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate = 8 February 2016|archive-date = 11 April 2016|dead-url = no|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160411004509/http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/intelligent-design-not-science-experts/2005/10/20/1129775902661.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Australian chapter of [[Cru (Christian organization)|Campus Crusade for Christ]] distributed a DVD of the Discovery Institute's documentary ''[[Unlocking the Mystery of Life]]'' (2002) to Australian secondary schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last = Kruger|first = Paula|date = 26 August 2005|title = Brendan Nelson suggests 'intelligent design' could be taught in schools|url = http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2005/s1447202.htm|work = [[PM (ABC Radio)|PM]]|type = Radio Transcript|publisher = [[Radio National|ABC Radio National]]|accessdate = 8 February 2017|archive-date = 11 September 2016|dead-url = no|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160911063507/http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2005/s1447202.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prominent scientific and educational organisations including the [[Australian Academy of Science]], the [[Federation of Australian Scientific and Technological Societies]], and the Australian Science Teachers' Association published an open letter urging that "the teaching or promulgation of intelligent design as science" should be prohibited, and that allowing such materials into school classrooms "would make a mockery of Australian science teaching and throw open the door of science classes to similarly unscientific world views &amp;ndash; be they astrology, spoon bending, flat Earth cosmology or alien abductions."&lt;ref name = IDinSMH /&gt;  Within a week of this open letter being published, Hawkes declared his support for using the DVD in the classroom at the discretion of teachers and principals, stating that {{nowrap|"[t]here}} are undeniable weaknesses within Darwin's Theory of Evolution, and these must be acknowledged honestly"; he added that the DVD being "forever shackled" and restricted to only the context of religious education would be a shame as teachers should be able to use it in science classes and other areas where theories and their underlying scientific assumptions are explored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last = Green|first = Shane|date = 28 October 2005|title = School backs intelligent design DVD|url = http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/school-backs-intelligent-design-dvd/2005/10/27/1130400306721.html|newspaper = [[The Age]]|accessdate = 8 February 2017|dead-url = no|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160825180111/http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/school-backs-intelligent-design-dvd/2005/10/27/1130400306721.html|archive-date = 25 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The debate on intelligent design resulted in Hawkes being nominated for the [[Bent Spoon Award]] of the [[Australian Skeptics]] organisation in 2006; Nelson had been nominated 17 times when the organisation decided not to accept any further nominations for him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Bent Spoon Award: Nominations for 2006|date = 24 September 2006|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060927143328/http://www.skeptics.com.au/spoon/nominations.htm|archive-date = 27 September 2006|url = http://www.skeptics.com.au/spoon/nominations.htm|publisher = [[Australian Skeptics]]|dead-url = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Neither of them won the award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.skeptics.com.au/features/bent-spoon/|title = The Bent Spoon Award|publisher = [[Australian Skeptics]]|year = 2017|archive-date = 8 February 2017|accessdate = 8 February 2017|dead-url = no|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170208050756/http://www.skeptics.com.au/features/bent-spoon/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Hawkes was given a "quality teaching" federal government award for excellence as a school principal for "rejuvenating the educational philosophy and practice of The King's School by building on its strengths as a national leader in boys' education, residential education and leadership education. School results have significantly improved under his leadership".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qualityteaching.deewr.gov.au/naqs/2007_winners/principal.htm Quality Teaching Award], 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hawkes has a number of interests outside education including being patron of the "Foresight Foundation" an organisation that assists adults who are both deaf and blind.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forsightfoundation.com.au/board/hawkes/hawkes.html Patron – Foresight Foundation].&lt;/ref&gt; He served from 2000 to 2008 as the national chairman of Overseas Missionary Fellowship and is president of the "Under 16s", an organisation that supports those who volunteered while being under the age of 16 years for service in World War II.

'''Ultralingua''' is a [[point-and-click|single-click]] and [[drag-and-drop]]  multilingual [[translation dictionary]], thesaurus,  and language reference utility. The full suite of Ultralingua language tools is available free online without the need for download and installation. 
As well as its online products, the developer offers premium downloadable language software with extended features and content for [[Macintosh]] and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] computer platforms, [[smartphone]]s, and other hand held devices.

==Features==
In  addition to the main user interface of the [[electronic dictionary]], a ‘[[hotkey]]’ feature allows the user to click on a word in any program that uses editable text including web browsers and [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] documents, and [[source code]]. When a word is clicked, the translation or definition is displayed in a small pop-up window. The hotkey tool does not require previous launching  of the software application.
The [[word stemming]] function allows searches from [[inflected]] forms of a word into the root word, such as in French, (''allez'' → ''aller'') with further extension by [[lemmatisation]]. Full verb conjugation in  all tenses, and number conversion from digits to text in the available languages (e.g. "123" → "one hundred twenty-three"), are available through  the program interface, as well as free access to  online examples of language in  use, and a [[discussion forum]] moderated by linguists and lexicographers.

The search algorithms are tolerant of capitalisation, minor misspelling, and omitted accents and [[diacritics]]. Extensive lexical information is provided including irregular plurals,  irregular verb forms, phrases and examples of use, [[American English]] and [[British English]] variations,  and grammar references. [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] transcription is given, while several language modules are also enabled for text-to-speech.
The application interface can be either permanently displayed above or alongside any other open program windows, or allowed to ‘float’ above open windows and is resizable.

An integrated learning tool provides a full screen [[flashcard]] feature that can work with the words in  the language databases, and user-added definitions.

==History==
The concept of the Ultralingua dictionary software began in 1996 when a small group of professors from [[Carleton College]] had the idea of creating a French dictionary that allowed the user to look up words on the fly with [[drag-and-drop]] technology, to and from a work in progress.

The dictionary program was first developed for the [[Apple Macintosh]] only. It was launched as [[freeware]] in 1997 under the name of ''Le Francophile'' and distributed mainly on the cover floppy discs of Mac magazines. It was commercialised in  1999 as  [[shareware]] as a fully functional application that could be obtained online from download sites. By the year 2000, with the collaboration of additional specialists in lexicography and linguistics, the product range had expanded to include language modules for Spanish and German,  and was released for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]. A French-German module was added in 2002.

Concurrent  with the opening of the Apple [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] in  2008, the language tools were launched for the [[iPhone]].
The major languages and features of the dictionary program have been offered free online since 2005 and take into account all the improvements of regular releases. 
By 2009 the software package was offering 17 dictionaries and additional language tools for widely spoken world languages.

Version 7.1.4 (Mac) and version 7.0.0.0 (Windows), released in the fall of 2008 and May 2009 respectively, incorporated a completely redesigned [[GUI]] and addressed many of the suggestions for improvement made in an exhaustive independent evaluation of version 6.0 by the [[State University of Texas]] ([[CALICO (consortium)|CALICO]]).

Though many people have been involved in the development of Ultralingua's code and data, the founders and main contributors to its development are the Chair Professors of Carleton's Linguistics and Computer Science departments. Elements of Ultralingua software have been developed in collaboration with [[Princeton University]], and The Carnegie Mellon Pronouncing Dictionary, by [[Carnegie Mellon University]]. Additional code libraries used include contributions by CTGradient, ShortcutRecorder (BSD License), PTHotKey, Sparkle for application updates, and the hotkey code includes software licensed from TrufSoft.com.

==Available dictionaries==
From its own in-house lexicographers the software provides proprietary [[bilingual dictionary]] modules for French-English, Spanish-English, German-English, Italian-English, Portuguese-English, Norwegian-English, French-Spanish, French-Italian, French-German, Spanish-German, Spanish-Portuguese, Esperanto-English, Latin-English, and English and French monolingual dictionaries and thesauri.

As well as its own language data sets, third-party modules include an English-French medical dictionary licensed from [[Masson (publisher)|Masson]], the French division of [[Elsevier]], the world's largest publisher of medical and scientific literature, an English-[[Klingon]] dictionary developed in collaboration with the [[Klingon Language Institute]] and [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], and bilingual corpora developed in association with [[HarperCollins]]. The [[co-branded]] Dictionaries from [[HarperCollins|Collins]], Masson, and Simon &amp; Schuster are for use exclusively with Ultralingua software.

The developer also has agreements with [[McGraw-Hill]] and [[Hachette (publisher)|Hachette]] for publication and distribution  of print and CD-ROM versions of its dictionaries.

Other programs separately available that are based on the Ultralingua technology include Grammatica, a spell and grammar check utility, and [[Distinguo]], an [[API]] for [[semantic search]].

==Evaluation and Criticism (v 6.0)==
It has been suggested in an independent evaluation by CALICO&lt;ref&gt;https://www.calico.org/p-383-Ultralingua%20(012008).html CALICO (4,500 words)&lt;/ref&gt; headquartered at the [[State University of Texas]] that the lexical content of the dictionaries tested with version 6.0 (2006) fell short on several issues:  namely that the lack of systematic information on usage, regional variants, and examples in context diminished to a certain extent the value of these tools; and that entries needed to be organized into coherent and easily identifiable sections, with priority given to primary meanings between the language 1 and language 2. So, too, cultural and geographical entries included in the monolingual dictionaries needed to be expanded to cover all countries in which the language is spoken. The evaluation went on to state that despite their shortcomings, which decrease each time a new version is released, given the size of each of the dictionaries, the entries are reasonably comprehensible and offer useful information for language learners, particularly in the dictionaries with more complete databases.

==Platforms (current releases)==
