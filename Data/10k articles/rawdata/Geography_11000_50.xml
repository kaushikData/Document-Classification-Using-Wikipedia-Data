'''2059 Baboquivari''', provisional designation {{mp|1963 UA}}, is an [[asteroid]] classified as [[near-Earth object]] of the [[Amor asteroid|Amor group]], approximately 1.9 kilometers in diameter. Discovered by the [[Indiana Asteroid Program]] in 1963, it was later named after the [[Baboquivari Mountains]] in Arizona, United States.

== Discovery and recovery ==

''Baboquivari'' is one of the lowest numbered near-Earth asteroids as it was already discovered on 16 October 1963. The discovery observation was made by the [[Indiana Asteroid Program]] at [[Goethe Link Observatory]] near Brooklyn, Indiana, in the United States. Three months later, it became a [[lost asteroid]] until June 1976, when it was recovered by the [[Steward Observatory]]'s 90-inch [[Bok Telescope]] at [[Kitt Peak National Observatory]] located in the Sonoran Desert of Arizona.&lt;ref name="MPC-Baboquivari" /&gt;

== Classification and orbit ==

''Baboquivari'' is an [[Amor asteroid]] – a subgroup of near-Earth asteroids that approach the orbit of Earth from beyond, but do not cross it. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.2–4.1&amp;nbsp;[[Astronomical unit|AU]] once every 4 years and 4 months (1,577 days). Its orbit has an [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of 0.53 and an [[orbital inclination|inclination]] of 11[[Degree (angle)|°]] with respect to the [[ecliptic]].&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt;
The body's [[observation arc]] begins at the discovering observatory, 10 days after its official discovery observation.&lt;ref name="MPC-Baboquivari" /&gt;

=== Close approaches ===

The asteroid has an Earth [[minimum orbit intersection distance]] of {{convert |0.2537 |AU |km |abbr=on |sigfig=3}}, which corresponds to 98.8 [[Lunar distance (astronomy)|lunar distances]]. It approached the Earth at a similar distance on 20 October 1963, shortly after its discovery. The eccentric asteroid is also a [[Mars-crosser]] and approached [[Jupiter (planet)|Jupiter]] at a distance of about 1.4&amp;nbsp;AU on 20 April 1970.&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt;

== Physical characteristics ==

Little is known about ''Baboquivari''{{'}}s physical characteristics. Its [[Asteroid spectral type|spectral type]] has never been determined.&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lcdb" /&gt;

=== Diameter and albedo ===

It is classified as a near-Earth object larger than one kilometer in diameter by the [[Minor Planet Center]] ("1+&amp;thinsp;KM").&lt;ref name="MPC-Baboquivari" /&gt; A generic magnitude-to-diameter conversion gives a diameter of 1.9 kilometers, based on the body's [[absolute magnitude]] of 16.0 and an assumed standard [[astronomical albedo|albedo]] for stony [[S-type asteroid]]s (''Baboquivari'' would still measure 1.3 kilometers in diameter, if it had a higher albedo of 0.4, typically seen among bright members of the [[Hungaria family]]).&lt;ref name="h" /&gt;

=== Rotation period ===

As of 2017, no rotational [[lightcurve]] of ''Baboquivari'' has been obtained from photometric observations. The asteroid's [[rotation period]], poles and shape remain unknown.&lt;ref name="lcdb" /&gt;

== Naming ==

This [[minor planet]] was named after the main-peak of the [[Baboquivari Mountains]], a sacred location in the mythology of the [[Papago Indian Tribe]]. The Observatories of the [[Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy]] (AURA) are located on the Baboquivari land, just a few kilometers south of [[Kitt Peak]].&lt;ref name="springer" /&gt; The approved naming citation was published by the [[Minor Planet Center]] on 1 December 1979 ({{small|[[Minor Planet Circulars|M.P.C.]] 5038}}).&lt;ref name="MPC-Circulars-Archive" /&gt;

'''31192 Aigoual''', provisional designation {{mp|1997 YH|16}}, is a Xizang [[asteroid]] from the central region of the [[asteroid belt]], approximately 7 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 29 December 1997, by staff members of the [[Pises Observatory]] in southern France.&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt; The asteroid was named after [[Mont Aigoual]] in France.&lt;ref name="springer" /&gt;

== Orbit and classification ==

''Aigoual'' is a member of the small [[Xizang family]] ({{small|[[FIN tbl#536|536]]}}),&lt;ref name="Ferret" /&gt; named after [[2344&amp;nbsp;Xizang]].&lt;ref name="Nesvorny-2014" /&gt; It orbits the Sun in the [[Kirkwood gap|central]] main-belt at a distance of 2.2–3.3&amp;nbsp;[[Astronomical unit|AU]] once every 4 years and 7 months (1,670 days). Its orbit has an [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of 0.19 and an [[orbital inclination|inclination]] of 3[[Degree (angle)|°]] with respect to the [[ecliptic]].&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt; The asteroid was first identified as {{mp|1978 UB|4}} at [[Palomar Observatory]] in 1978, extending the body's [[observation arc]] by 19 years prior to its official discovery observation.&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt;

== Physical characteristics ==

''Aigoual'' is an assumed carbonaceous [[C-type asteroid]],&lt;ref name="lcdb" /&gt; while the overall [[Asteroid spectral type|spectral type]] of the Xizang family has not yet been evaluated.&lt;ref name="Nesvorny-2014" /&gt;{{rp|23}}

== Rotational lightcurve ==

In October 2010, a rotational [[lightcurve]] of ''Aigoual'' was obtained from photometric observations made by astronomers at the [[Palomar Transient Factory]] in California. Lightcurve analysis gave a [[rotation period]] of {{val|4.3291}} hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.56 [[Magnitude (astronomy)|magnitude]] ({{small|[[LCDB quality code|U=2]]}}).&lt;ref name="Waszczak-2015" /&gt;

=== Diameter and albedo estimate ===

The ''Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link'' assumes a standard albedo for a carbonaceous asteroid of 0.057 and calculates a diameter of 7.3 kilometers with an [[absolute magnitude]] of 14.4.&lt;ref name="lcdb" /&gt;

== Naming ==

This [[minor planet]] was named after [[Mont Aigoual]], in the [[Cévennes National Park]], where the discovering observatory is located. It is the highest mountain of the Cévennes in the [[Massif Central]], France.&lt;ref name="springer" /&gt; The approved naming citation was published by the [[Minor Planet Center]] on 28 March 2002 ({{small|[[Minor Planet Circulars|M.P.C.]] 45237}}).&lt;ref name="MPC-Circulars-Archive" /&gt;

The '''Apennines'''&lt;ref&gt;''Apennines'', ''[[Merriam-Webster Dictionary]]'' definition, on-line on [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Apennines www.merriam-webster.com]&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Apennine Mountains''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|p|ən|aɪ|n}}; {{lang-grc-gre|links=no|Ἀπέννινα ὄρη}};&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]], ''Geography'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:abo:tlg,0099,001:5&amp;lang=original book 5]&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-la|links=no|Appenninus}} or ''{{lang|la|Apenninus Mons}}''—a singular used in the plural;&lt;ref group=note&gt;''Apenninus'' has the form of an adjective, which would be segmented ''Apenn-inus'', often used with nouns such as ''mons'' (mountain) or Greek ὄρος ''oros'', but just as often used alone as a noun. The ancient Greeks and Romans typically but not always used "mountain" in the singular to mean one or a range; thus, "the Apennine mountain" refers to the entire chain and is translated "the Apennine mountains". The ending can vary also by gender depending on the noun modified. The Italian singular refers to one of the constituent chains rather than to a single mountain and the Italian plural refers to multiple chains rather than to multiple mountains.&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-it|links=no|Appennini}} {{IPA-it|appenˈniːni|}})&lt;ref name=Lewis_1879/&gt; are a [[mountain range]] consisting of parallel smaller chains extending {{circa|{{convert|1200|km|mi|abbr=on}}}} along the length of [[peninsula]]r [[Italy]]. In the northwest they join with the [[Ligurian Alps]] at [[Altare]]. In the southwest they end at [[Reggio di Calabria]], the coastal city at the tip of the peninsula. Since 2000 the Environment Ministry of Italy, following the recommendations of the Apennines Park of Europe Project, has been defining the Apennines System to include the mountains of north [[Sicily]], for a total distance of {{nowrap|{{convert|1500|km|mi}}}}.&lt;ref name=Gambino-and-Romano_2000-2001/&gt; The system forms an arc enclosing the east side of the [[Ligurian Sea|Ligurian]] and [[Tyrrhenian Sea]]s.

The etymology most frequently repeated, because of its semantic appropriateness, is that it derives from the [[Celtic language|Celtic]] ''Penn'', "mountain, summit":&lt;ref name="Lewis_1879"/&gt; {{nowrap|''A-penn-inus'',}} which could have been assigned during the Celtic domination of north Italy in the 4th century BC or before. The name originally applied to the north Apennines. However, historical linguists have never found a derivation with which they  all agree.{{sfn|Lake|1911|p=161}} Wilhelm Deecke said:&lt;ref name=Deecke_1904&gt;{{harvnb|Deecke|1904|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;A large number of place names reflect ''pen'': Penarrig, Penbrynn, Pencoid, Penmon, Pentir, etc. and ben: Beanach, Benmore, Benabuird, Benan, Bencruachan, etc. ({{harvnb|Blackie|1887|pp=21, 154}}). In one derivation ''Pen/Ben'' is cognate with [[Old Irish]] ''cenn'', "head", but an original *''kwen''- would be required, which is typologically not found in languages that feature [[Labialized velar consonant|labio-velars]]. [[Ernst Windisch|Windisch]] and [[Karl Brugmann|Brugmann]] reconstructed [[Proto-Indo-European language|Indo-European]] *kwi-, deriving also the Greek [[Pindus Mountains]], but *kwen-&lt;*kwi- is not explained by any rule ({{cite encyclopedia|title=ceann|encyclopedia=MacBain's Dictionary|url=http://www.ceantar.org/Dicts/MB2/mb07.html}}). Accordingly {{cite encyclopedia|title=pin|encyclopedia=Webster's Third New International Dictionary}} has it cognate with English "pin" and {{cite encyclopedia|title=*pet-|encyclopedia=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Indo-European Roots}} goes so far as to suggest ''pin'' and ''pen'' come from Latin ''pinna'', "feather", in the sense of the horn of the quill. This view has the word originating in [[Latium]] inconsistently with the theory of the northern origin. None of these derivations are unquestionably accepted.&lt;/ref&gt; {{nowrap|"...its etymology}} is doubtful but some derive it from the Ligurian-Celtish ''Pen'' or ''Ben'', which means mountain peak."

The Apennines also conserve some intact ecosystems, which have survived human intervention. In here there are some of the best preserved forests and montane grasslands in the whole continent, now protected by [[List of national parks of Italy|national parks]] and, within them, a high diversity of flora and fauna. These mountains are, in fact, one of the last refuges for the big European predators such as the [[Italian wolf]] and the [[marsican brown bear]], now extinct in other countries of central Europe.

The mountains lend their name to the [[Apennine peninsula]], which forms the major part of Italy.{{sfn|Lake|1911|p=161}} They are mostly verdant, although one side of the highest peak, [[Corno Grande]] is partially covered by [[Calderone glacier]], the only [[glacier]] in the Apennines. It has been receding since 1794.&lt;ref name="P75"&gt;{{harvnb|Pederotti|2003|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; The eastern slopes down to the [[Adriatic Sea]] are steep, while the western slopes form foothills on which most of peninsular Italy's cities are located. The mountains tend to be named from the province or provinces in which they are located; for example, the Ligurian Apennines are in Liguria. As the provincial borders have not always been stable, this practice has resulted in some confusion about exactly where the montane borders are. Often but not always a geographical feature can be found that lends itself to being a border.

==Geography==
The Apennines are divided into three sectors: northern ({{lang-it|links=no|Appennino settentrionale}}''),'' central ''({{lang|it|Appennino centrale}}''), and {{nowrap|southern (''{{lang|it|Appennino meridionale}}'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Martini|2001|p=3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}''

A number of long hiking trails wind through the Apennines. Of note is [[European walking route E1]] coming from northern Europe and traversing the lengths of the northern and central Apennines. The [[Grand Italian Trail]] begins in [[Trieste]] and after winding through the Alpine arc traverses the entire Apennine system, Sicily and Sardinia.

===Northern Apennines===
The northern Apennines consist of three sub-chains: the Ligurian (''{{lang|it|Appennino ligure}}''), Tuscan-Emilian (''{{lang|it|Appennino toscano}}''-emiliano), and Umbrian Apennines (''{{lang|it|Appennino umbro}}'').&lt;ref name=MW&gt;{{harvnb|Merriam-Webster|2001|p=59}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ligurian Apennines====
[[File:Bocchetta di Altare.jpg|thumb|left|The plaque marking the Bocchetta di [[Altare]]]] 
The Ligurian Apennines border the [[Ligurian Sea]] in the [[Gulf of Genoa]], from about [[Savona]] below the upper [[Bormida (river)|Bormida]] River valley to about [[La Spezia]] ([[Cisa Pass|La Cisa pass]]) below the upper [[Magra]] River valley. The range follows the [[Gulf of Genoa]] separating it from the upper [[Po Valley]]. The northwestern border follows the line of the Bormida River to [[Acqui Terme]]. There the river continues northeast to [[Alessandria]] in the [[Po Valley]], but the mountains bend away to the southeast.

The upper Bormida can be reached by a number of roads proceeding inland at a right angle to the coast southwest of [[Savona]], the chief one being the Autostrada Torino-Savona. They ascend to the Bocchetta di [[Altare]], sometimes called [[Colle di Cadibona]], {{convert|436|m|ft|abbr=on}}, the border between the [[Ligurian Alps]] along the coast to the west and the Ligurian Apennines. A bronze plaque fixed to a stone marks the top of the pass. In the vicinity are fragments of the old road and three ruins of former fortifications.

At [[Carcare]], the main roads connect with the upper Bormida valley (Bormida di Millare) before turning west. The [[Scrivia]], the [[Trebbia]] and the [[Taro River|Taro]], tributaries of the [[Po River]], drain the northeast slopes. The range contains dozens of peaks. Toward the southern end the [[Aveto Natural Regional Park]] includes [[Monte Penna]]. Nearby is the highest point of Ligurian Apennines, [[Monte Maggiorasca]] at {{convert|1780|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=MW/&gt;

The main and only feasible overland route connecting the coastal plain of Liguria to the north Italian plain runs through Bocchetta di Altare. It has always been of strategic importance. Defenders of north Italy have had to control it since ancient times, as the various fortifications placed there testify. [[Trenitalia]], the state railway system, highly developed on the coastal plain, now traverses the mountains routinely through a number of railway tunnels, such as the one at [[Giovi Pass]].

[[File:MonteCimone3.jpg|thumb|right|230px|[[Monte Cimone]] (2165 m) is the highest mountain of the northern Apennines in the [[Emilia Romagna]]]]

The southeastern border of the Ligurian Apennines is the Fiume [[Magra]], which projects into the Tyrrhenian Sea south of [[La Spezia]], and the Fiume [[Taro (river)|Taro]], which runs in the opposite direction to join the [[Po River]]. The divide between the two upper river valleys is the Passo della Cisa ([[Cisa Pass]]). Under it (two tunnels) runs the Autostrada della Cisa between Spezia and [[Parma]].

====Tuscan–Emilian Apennines====
Starting at [[Cisa Pass]], the mountain chains turn further to the southeast to cross the peninsula along the border between the [[Emilia-Romagna]] and [[Tuscany]] regions. They are also named the Tuscan–Emilian Apennines west of the [[Futa pass]] and the Tuscan–Romagnol Apennines east of it, or just the Tuscan Apennines.&lt;ref name=MW/&gt; They extend to the upper [[Tiber River]]. The highest point is [[Monte Cimone]] at {{convert|2165|m|ft|abbr=on}}.

A separate branch, the [[Apuan Alps]], goes to the southwest bordering the coast south of [[La Spezia]]. Whether they are to be considered part of the Apennines is a matter of opinion; certainly, they are part of the Apennine System. Topographically only the valley of the River [[Serchio]], which running parallel to the coast turns and exits into the Tyrrhenian Sea north of [[Pisa]], separates the Apuan Alps from the Apennines; geologically the rock is of a slightly different composition: [[marble]]. The Roman marble industry was centered at [[Luna (Etruria)|Luna]], and is now active in [[Carrara]].

As the Tuscan Apennines divide the peninsula between the [[Po Valley]] and the plains and hills of [[Tuscany]] and [[Lazio]], transportation over them is essential to political and economic unity. Historically the Romans used the [[Via Flaminia]] between [[Rome]] and [[Rimini]]. The montane distance between [[Florence]] in [[Tuscany]] and [[Bologna]] in [[Emilia-Romagna]] is shorter, but exploitation of it required the conquest of more rugged terrain, which was not feasible for the ancients. Railway lines were constructed over the mountains in the early 19th century but they were of low capacity and unimprovable.

Since 1856 a series of tunnels have been constructed to conduct "the Bologna-Florence rail line", which is neither a single line nor a single tunnel. The Porrettana Line went into service in 1864, the Direttissima in 1934 and the High Speed in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lunardi|2008|pp=413–414}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A few dozen tunnels support the three of them, the longest on the High-Speed Line being the Voglia Tunnel at {{convert|16.757|km|mi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lunardi|2008|pp=425–437}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The longest is on the Direttissima, the Great Apennine Tunnel, which at {{convert|18.5|km|mi|1|abbr=off}} is the longest entirely within Italy, although the [[Simplon Tunnel]], which connects Italy and Switzerland, is longer.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Claims of being the longest or second-longest in the world have been soon outdated. See [[List of longest tunnels]].&lt;/ref&gt; Automobile traffic is carried by the Autostrada del Sole, Route A1, which goes through numerous shorter tunnels, bypassing an old road, originally Roman, through [[Futa Pass]]. In December 2015, a new Route A1 called [[Variante di Valico]] was opened after many years of construction consisting of major tunnels (the longest being the new {{convert|8.6|km|1|adj=mid|abbr=off}} 'Tunel Base') and new overpasses notably shortening the traveling time between Florence and Bologna by road.
Inside the Tuscan–Romagnol Apennines are in the southern part also the  [[Foreste Casentinesi, Monte Falterona, Campigna National Park]].
Geographically the southernmost sharp limit of the Tuscan–Romagnol Apennines is the Bocca Serriola pass that is politically in northern [[Umbria]] and links [[Fano]] and [[Città di Castello]].
[[File:Colonna tevere.jpg|thumb|left|235px|Source of the Tiber. Marked by a [[Column]] decorated with an Eagle and Wolf heads – Part of the Apennine fauna and symbols of [[Roman Republic|Rome]]]]
The [[Tiber River]] at [[Rome]] flows from [[Monte Fumaiolo]] in the Tuscan-Romagnol  Apennine from northeast to southwest, projecting into the Tyrrhenian Sea at right angles to the shore. The upper Tiber, however, flows from northwest to southeast, gradually turning through one right angle clockwise. The northern Tiber valley is deep and separates the  Apennines on the left bank from a lesser range, the Tuscan Anti- or Sub-Apennines on its right.

===Central Apennines===
The Apennine System forms an irregular arc with centers of curvature located in the Tyrrhenian Sea. The northern and southern segments comprise parallel chains that can be viewed as single overall mountain ridges, such as the Ligurian Mountains. The center, being thicker and more complex, is geologically divided into an inner and an outer arc with regard to the centers of curvature. The geologic definition, however, is not the same as the geographic.

Based on rock type and orogenic incidents, the northern segment of the arc is divided into the Outer Northern Apennines (ONA) and the Inner Northern Apennines (INA).&lt;ref name="Barchi2001"&gt;{{harvnb|Barchi|2001|p=216}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Central Apennines are divided into the Umbrian–Marchean (''{{lang|it|Appennino umbro-marchigiano}}'') or Roman Apennines in the north and the Abruzzi Apennines (''{{lang|it|Appennino abruzzese}}'') in the south.It extends from Bocca Serriola pass in the north to Forlì pass in the south.&lt;ref name="MW" /&gt;

====Umbrian–Marchean Apennines====

The west border of the Umbrian-Marchean Apennines (or "Umbro-Marchean") runs through [[Cagli]]. They extend south to the [[Tronto]] River, the south border of the ONA.
The highest peak, [[Monte Vettore]], at {{convert|2478|m|ft|abbr=on}}, is part of the [[Sibillini Mounts|Monti Sibillini]], incorporated into [[Parco Nazionale dei Monti Sibillini]]. Further inland is Parco Sasso Simone e Simoncello&lt;ref name="PI"&gt;{{cite web|title=Parks, Reserves and other Protected Areas in the Marches|publisher=Parks.it|url=http://www.parks.it/regione.marche/Emap.html|date=1995–2010|accessdate=15 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and further south [[Esino|Parco naturale regionale Gola della Rossa di Frasassi]], in which are the Gola della Rossa ("Canyon of the Red") and [[Frasassi Caves]]. The Italian Park Service calls it the "green heart" of Italy. The region is heavily forested, such as the Riserva Naturale Statale Gola del Furlo, where [[Furlo Pass]] on the [[Via Flaminia]] is located. Both the Etruscans and the Romans constructed tunnels here.

====Abruzzi Apennines====
[[File:Gran Sasso in clouds.JPG|thumb|230px|right|Gran Sasso and Campo Imperatore]]
The Abruzzi Apennines, located in [[Abruzzo]], [[Molise]] (formerly part of Abruzzo) and southeastern [[Lazio]], contain the highest peaks and most rugged terrain of the Apennines. They are known in history as the territory of the Italic peoples first defeated by the city of [[Rome]]. Coincidentally they exist in three parallel folds or chains surviving from the [[orogeny]].&lt;ref name=MW/&gt; These extend in a northwest-southeast direction from the River [[Tronto]] to the River [[Sangro]], which drain into the [[Adriatic]]. The coastal hills of the east extend between [[San Benedetto del Tronto]] in the north and [[Torino di Sangro]] in the south.

The eastern chain consists mainly of the southern part of the [[Monti Sibillini]], the [[Monti della Laga]], the [[Gran Sasso d'Italia]] Massif and the [[Majella]] Massif. Among them are two national parks: [[Gran Sasso e Monti della Laga National Park]] and [[Majella National Park]]; and the Regional Park of the Monti Simbruini. Gran Sasso contains [[Corno Grande]], the highest peak of the Apennines.
[[File:Prateria sul Passo San Leonardo - panoramio.jpg|thumb|230x230px|Majella massif.]]
Other features between the western and central ranges are the plain of [[Rieti]], the valley of the Salto, and the [[Fucine Lake|Lago Fucino]]; while between the central and eastern ranges are the valleys of [[L'Aquila|Aquila]] and [[Sulmona]]. The chief rivers on the west are the [[Nera (Italy)|Nera]], with its [[tributary|tributaries]] the Velino and Salto, and the [[Aniene]], both of which fall into the Tiber. On the east there is at first a succession of small rivers which flow into the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]], from which the highest points of the chain are some 20&amp;nbsp;km distant, such as the [[Tronto]], Tordino, Vomano and others. The Pescara, which receives the [[Aterno-Pescara|Aterno]] from the north-west and the Gizio from the south-east, is more important; and so is the [[Sangro]].

The central Apennines are crossed by the railway from [[Rome]] to [[Pescara]] via [[Avezzano]] and Sulmona: the railway from [[Orte]] to [[Terni]] (and thence to [[Foligno]]) follows the Nera valley; while from Terni a line ascends to the plain of Rieti, and thence crosses the central chain to Aquila, whence it follows the valley of the Aterno to Sulmona. In ancient times the [[Via Salaria]], [[Via Caecilia]] and Via Valeria-Claudia all ran from Rome to the Adriatic coast. The volcanic mountains of the province of Rome are separated from the Apennines by the Tiber valley, and the [[Monti Lepini]], part of the Volscian chain, by the valleys of the [[Sacco River|Sacco]] and [[Liri]].

===Southern Apennines===
[[File:Monte Pollino (2.248 m) e serra Dolcedorme (2.267 m). Salendo su serra del Prete (2.181 m).JPG|thumb|230px|right|The Mount Pollino]]
[[File:Pizzo Carbonara.jpg|thumb|230px|right|The [[Pizzo Carbonara]], 6,493 feet (1,979 m), is the highest peak of the [[Sicily|Sicilian]] ''Appenino siculo'', which forms part of the [[Calabria]]n southern Apennines.]]
The southern Apennines can be divided into four major regions: (1) Samnite Apennines, (2) Campanian Apennines, (3) Lucan Apennines and (4) Calabrian Apennines including the Sicilian Apennines.They extend from Forlì pass towards south.

====Samnite and Campanian Apennines====
In the southern Apennines, to the south of the [[Sangro]] valley, the three parallel chains are broken up into smaller groups; among them may be named the [[Matese]], the highest point of which is the Monte Miletto {{convert|6725|ft|m|order=flip}}. The chief rivers on the south-west are the [[Liri]] or [[Garigliano]] with its tributary the Sacco, the [[Volturno]], Sebeto, Sarno, on the north the Trigno, Biferno and [[Fortore]].{{sfn|Lake|1911|p=162}}

The promontory of [[Gargano|Monte Gargano]], on the east, is completely isolated, and so are the [[Campania]]n [[volcanic arc]] near [[Naples]]. The district is traversed from north-west to south-east by the railway from [[Sulmona]] to [[Benevento]] and on to [[Avellino]], and from south-west to northeast by the railways from Caianello via Isernia to [[Campobasso]] and Termoli, from Caserta to Benevento and Foggia, and from [[Nocera Inferiore]] and Avellino to Rocchetta S. Antonio, the junction for Foggia, Spinazzola (for Barletta, Bari, and [[Taranto]]) and Potenza. Roman roads followed the same lines as the railways: the [[Via Appia]] ran from [[Capua]] to Benevento, whence the older road went to Venosa and Taranto and so to [[Brindisi]], while the Via Traiana ran nearly to [[Foggia]] and thence to Bari.{{sfn|Lake|1911|p=162}}

====Lucan Apennines====
The valley of the [[Ofanto]], which runs into the Adriatic close to [[Barletta]], marks the northern termination of the first range of the Lucanian Apennines (now [[Basilicata]]), which runs from east to west, while south of the valleys of the Sele (on the west) and [[Basento]] (on the east)—which form the line followed by the railway from Battipaglia via [[Potenza]] to [[Metaponto]]—the second range begins to run due north and south as far as the plain of [[Sibari]]. The highest point is the Monte [[Pollino]] {{convert|7325|ft|m|order=flip}}. The chief rivers are the Sele—joined by the Negro and Calore—on the west, and the [[Bradano]], [[Basento]], Agri, Sinni on the east, which flow into the gulf of Taranto; to the south of the last-named river there are only unimportant streams flowing into the sea east and west, inasmuch as here the width of the peninsula diminishes to some {{convert|40|mi|km|order=flip}}.{{sfn|Lake|1911|p=162}}

====Calabrian and Sicilian Apennines====
The railway running south from Sicignano to Lagonegro, ascending the valley of the Negro, is planned to extend to Cosenza, along the line followed by the ancient Via Popilia, which beyond Cosenza reached the west coast at Terina and thence followed it to Reggio. The Via Herculia, a branch of the Via Traiana, ran from Aequum Tuticum to the ancient Nerulum. At the narrowest point the plain of Sibari, through which the rivers Coscile and Crati  flow to the sea, occurs on the east coast, extending halfway across the peninsula. Here the limestone Apennines proper cease and the granite mountains of [[Calabria]] begin.{{sfn|Lake|1911|p=162}}

The first group extends as far as the [[isthmus]] formed by the gulfs of South Eufemia and Squillace; it is known as the Sila, and the highest point reached is {{convert|6330|ft|m|order=flip}} (the [[Botte Donato]]). The forests which covered it in ancient times supplied the Greeks and Sicilians with timber for shipbuilding. The railway from South Eufemia to [[Catanzaro]] and Catanzaro Marina crosses the isthmus, and an ancient road may have run from Squillace to Monteleone. The second group extends to the south end of the [[Italian Peninsula]], culminating in the [[Aspromonte]] ({{convert|6420|ft|m|order=flip}}) to the east of [[Reggio di Calabria]]. In both groups the rivers are quite unimportant.{{sfn|Lake|1911|p=162}} Finally, the Calabrian southern Apennine Mountains extend along the northern coast of Sicily (the Sicilian Apennines, Italian ''Appennino siculo'')—[[Pizzo Carbonara]] ({{convert|1979|m|ft|order=flip}}) being the highest peak.

==Ecology==

===Vegetative zones===

====Ecoregions====
* north and central: [[Apennine deciduous montane forest]] ([[temperate broadleaf and mixed forests]] [[biome]])
* north through south: [[Italian sclerophyllous and semi-deciduous forests]] ([[Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub]] biome)
* south: [[South Apennine mixed montane forests]] (also a Mediterranean biome)

The number of [[vascular plant]] species in the Apennines has been estimated at 5,599.  Of these, 728 (23.6%) are in the treeline [[ecotone]]. [[Raunkiær plant life-form|Hemicryptophyte]]s predominate in the entire Apennine chain.&lt;ref name=P79&gt;{{harvnb|Pederotti|2003|p=79}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Alpine zone====
The [[tree line]] [[ecotone]] is mainly [[grassland]]s of the [[Montane grasslands and shrublands]] biome; with Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests, and Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub below it. The tree line in the Apennines can be found in the range {{convert|1600|m|ft|abbr=on}} to {{convert|2000|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=P73&gt;{{harvnb|Pederotti|2003|p=73}}.&lt;/ref&gt; About 5% of the map area covered by the Apennines is at or above the tree line—or in the treeline ecotone. The [[snow line]] is at about {{convert|3200|m|ft|abbr=on}}, leaving the Apennines below it, except for the one remaining glacier. Snow may fall from October to May. Rainfall increases with latitude.&lt;ref name="P75"/&gt; The range's climates, depending on elevation and latitude, are the [[Oceanic climate]] and [[Mediterranean climate]].
&lt;!-- ===Transhumance===
This is entirely 1911 (see ''character'' on page 162)
The Apennines are to some extent clothed with forests, though these were probably more extensive in classical times ([[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] mentions especially [[pine]], [[oak]] and [[beech]] woods, ''Hist. Nat''. xvi. 177); they have indeed been greatly reduced in comparatively modern times by indiscriminate timber-felling, and though serious attempts at [[reforestation]] have been made by the government, much remains to be done. {{sfn|Lake|1911|p=162}}

They also furnish considerable summer pastures, especially in the [[Abruzzi]]: Pliny (''Hist. Nat''. xi. 240) praises the cheese of the Apennines. In the forests [[wolves]] were frequent, and still are found, the flocks being protected against them by large sheep-dogs; bears, however, which were known in Roman times, have almost entirely disappeared. Nor are the wild goats called ''rotae'', spoken of by [[Marcus Terentius Varro]] (''Rerum rusticarum'' II. i. 5), which may have been either [[chamois]] or [[steinbock]], to be found. {{sfn|Lake|1911|p=162}}

Brigandage appears to have been prevalent in Roman times in the more remote parts of the Apennines, as it was until recently: an inscription found near the Furlo pass was set up in AD 246 by an ''evocatus Augusti'' (a member of a picked corps) on special police duty with a detachment of twenty men from the Ravenna fleet. {{sfn|Lake|1911|p=162}}

Snow lies on the highest peaks of the Apennines for almost the whole year. The range produces no minerals, but there are a considerable number of good [[mineral spring]]s, some of which are thermal (such as [[Bagni di Lucca]], [[Montecatini Terme|Montecatini]], [[Monsummano]], Porretta, Telese), while others are cool (such as Nocera, [[San Gemini|Sangemini]], Cinciano), the water of which is both drunk on the spot and sold as table water elsewhere.{{sfn|Lake|1911|p=162}} --&gt;

Prior to the explosion of data on the topic from about the year 2000 many authors took the approach that the Apennines had the same origin as the Alps. Even today some authors use the term Alpine-Apennine system. They are not, however, the same system and did not have the same origin. The Alps were millions of years old before the Apennines rose from the sea.

Both the Alps and the Apennines contain primarily sedimentary rock resulting from sedimentation of the ancient [[Tethys Sea]] in the [[Mesozoic]].{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} The northward movement of the African Plate and its collision with the European Plate then caused the [[Alpine Orogeny]], beginning in the late Mesozoic. The band of mountains created extends from Spain to Turkey in a roughly east-west direction and includes the Alps. The Apennines are much younger, extend from northwest to southeast, and are not a displacement of the Alpine chain.

The key evidence of the difference is the geologic behavior of the [[Po Valley]] in northern Italy. Compressional forces have been acting from north to south in the Alps and from south to north in the Apennines, but instead of being squeezed into mountains the valley has been subsiding at 1 to {{convert|4|mm|2|abbr=on}} per year since about 25 [[mya (unit)|mya]], before the Apennines {{nowrap|existed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The origin of mountains |first=Cliff |last=Ollier|first2=Colin|last2=Pain| publisher=Routledge|year=2000|location=London|page=77|quote=Apennine thrusts move in from the south, and Southern Alps thrust in from the north, but instead of collisional compression there is subsidence and horizontal sedimentation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} It is now known to be not an erosional feature but is a filled portion of the Adriatic Trench, called the Adriatic foredeep after its function as a subduction zone was discovered. The Alps and the Apennines were always separated by this trench and were never part of the same system.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

===Formation of rocks===

===Apennine orogeny===
The Apennine orogeny is a type of mountain-building in which two simpler types are combined in an apparently paradoxical configuration. Sometimes this is referred to as "syn-orogenic extension", but the term implies that the two processes occur simultaneously during time. 
Some scientists imagine that this is relatively rare but not unique in mountain building, whereas others imagine that this is fairly common in all mountain belts.

The RETREAT Project&lt;ref group=note&gt;The Retreating-trench, extension and accretion (RETREAT) Project is a study conducted by a consortium of scientific organizations in different countries including in the US the [[National Science Foundation]].&lt;/ref&gt; have this specific feature as one of their focus points &lt;ref name="Margheriti 2006 1120"&gt;{{harvnb|Margheriti|2006|p=1120}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 
In essence the east side of Italy features a [[fold and thrust belt]] raised by compressional forces acting under the [[Adriatic]] Sea. This side has been called the "Apennine-Adriatic Compressional Zone" or the "Apennines Convergence Zone." On the west side of Italy [[fault-block mountain]]s prevail, created by a spreading or extension of the crust under the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]]. This side is called the "Tyrrhenian Extensional Zone." The mountains of Italy are of paradoxical provenience, having to derive from both compression and extension:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The paradox of how contraction and extension can occur simultaneously in convergent mountain belts remains a fundamental and largely unresolved problem in continental dynamics."&lt;/blockquote&gt;Both the folded and the fault-block systems include parallel mountain chains. In the folded system [[anticline]]s erode into the highest and longest massifs of the Apennines.

According to the older theories (originating from the 1930s to 1970s) of Dutch geologists, including Van Bemmelen, compression and extension can and should occur simultaneously at different depths in a mountain belt. In these theories, these different levels are called ''Stockwerke''. More recent work in geotectonics and geodynamics of the same school of geoscientists (Utrecht and Amsterdam University) by Vlaar, Wortel, and Cloetingh, and their disciples, extended these concepts even further into a temporal realm. They demonstrated that internal and external forces acting upon the mountain belt (e.g., [[slab pull]] and intra-plate stress field modulations due to large scale reorganisations of the [[Plate tectonics|tectonic plates]]) result in both longer episodes and shorter phases of general extension and compression acting both upon and inside mountain belts and tectonic arches (See e.g. for extensive reviews, bibliography and discussions on the literature:

====Compressional zone====
The gradual subsidence of the [[Po Valley]] (including that of [[Venice]]) and the folding of the mountains of eastern Italy have been investigated using [[seismic wave]] analysis of the "Apennine [[Subduction]] System."&lt;ref name="Margheriti 2006 1120"/&gt; Along the Adriatic side of Italy the floor of the [[Adriatic Sea]], referred to as the "Adriatic lithosphere" or the "Adriatic plate," terms whose precise meaning is the subject of ongoing research, is dipping under the slab on which the Apennines have been folded by compressional forces.

Subduction occurs along a [[Fault (geology)|fault]], along which a [[Fault (geology)|hanging wall]], or overriding slab is thrust over an overridden slab, also called the subducting slab. The fault that acts as the subduction interface is at the bottom of the Apennine wedge, characterized by a deep groove in the surface, typically filled with sediment, as sedimentation here occurs at a much faster rate than subduction.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} In north Italy the dip of this interface is 30° to 40° at a depth of 80–90&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref name="Margheriti 2006 1124"&gt;{{harvnb|Margheriti|2006|p=1124}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[strike and dip|strike]] of the Apennine subduction zone forms a long, irregular arc with centers of curvature in the Tyrrhenian Sea following the hanging wall over which the mountains have been raised; i.e., the eastern wall of the mountains. It runs from near the base of the Ligurian Apennines in the Po Valley along the margin of the mountains to the Adriatic, along the coastal deeps of the Adriatic shore, strikes inland at [[Gargano|Monte Gargano]] cutting off [[Apulia]], out to sea again through the [[Gulf of Taranto]], widely around the rest of Italy and [[Sicily]] and across inland north Africa.&lt;ref name="Margheriti 2006 1124"/&gt; The upper mantle above {{convert|250|km|mi|abbr=on}} deep is broken into the "Northern Apennines Arc" and the "Calabrian Arc", with compressional forces acting in different directions radially toward the arcs' centers of curvature. The overall [[plate tectonics]] of these events has been modeled in different ways but decisive data is still missing. The tectonics, however, are not the same as those which created the Alps.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

====Extensional zone====
The west side of Italy is given to a [[fault-block]] system, where the crust, extended by the lengthening mantle below, thinned, broke along roughly parallel [[Fault (geology)|fault]] lines, and the blocks alternatively sank into [[graben]]s or were raised by [[isostasy]] into [[Horst (geology)|horst]]s. This system prevails from [[Corsica]] eastward to the valley of the [[Tiber River]], the last rift valley in that direction. It runs approximately across the direction of extension. In the fault-block system the ridges are lower and are more steep-sided, since the walls are formed by faults. Geographically they are not considered part of the Apennines proper but are termed "sub-apennine" or "anti-apennine." These mountains are found mainly in [[Tuscany]], [[Lazio]] and [[Campania]].

===Stability of terrain===
The terrain of the Apennines (as well as that of the Alps) is to a large degree unstable due to various types of [[Landslide classification|landslides]], including falls and slides of rocks and debris, flows of earth and mud, and sink holes. The Institute for Environmental Protection and Research (''{{lang|it|Istituto Superiore per la Protezione e la Ricerca Ambientale}}''), a government agency founded in 2008 by combining three older agencies, published in that year a special report, ''Landslides in Italy'', summarizing the results of the IFFI Project (''{{lang|it|Il Progetto IFFI}}''), the Italian Landslide Inventory (''{{lang|it|Inventario dei Fenomeni Franosi in Italia}}''), an extensive survey of historical landslides in Italy undertaken by the government starting in 1997. On December 31, 2007, it had studied and mapped 482,272 landslides over {{convert|20500|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. Its major statistics are the Landslide Index (LI here), the ratio of the landslide area to the total area of a region, the Landslide Index in Mountainous-Hilly Areas (here LIMH) and the Density of Landslides, which is the number per {{convert|100|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.

Italy as a whole has a LI of 6.8, a LIMH of 9.1 and a density of 160. [[Lombardia]] (LI of 13.9), [[Emilia-Romagna]] (11.4), [[Marche]]s (19.4), [[Molise]] (14.0), [[Valle d'Aosta]] (16.0) and [[Piemonte]] (9.1) are significantly higher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Landslides in Italy: Special Report 2008 |first=Alessandro |last=Trigila |first2=Carla |last2=Iadanza |publisher=Istituto Superiore per la Protezione e la Ricerca Ambientale (ISPRA) |location=Rome |format=pdf |url=http://www.apat.gov.it/site/_contentfiles/00153200/153292_RAPPORTO_83_08_Landslide.pdf |year=2008 |pages=15–16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717122241/http://www.apat.gov.it/site/_contentfiles/00153200/153292_RAPPORTO_83_08_Landslide.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most unstable terrain in the Apennines when the landslide sites are plotted on the map are in order from most unstable the eastern flanks of the Tuscan-Emilian Apennines, the Central Apennines and the eastern flank of the southern Apennines. Instability there is comparable to the Alps bordering the [[Po Valley]]. The most stable terrain is on the western side: [[Liguria]], [[Tuscany]], [[Umbria]] and [[Lazio]]. The Apennines are slumping away to the northeast into the Po Valley and the Adriatic foredeep; that is, the zone where the Adriatic floor is being subducted under Italy. Slides with large translational or rotational surface movements are most common; e.g., a whole slope slumps into its valley, placing the population there at risk.

===Glacial ice===
Glaciers no longer exist in the Apennines outside the [[Gran Sasso d'Italia]] massif. However, post-Pliocene [[moraines]] have been observed in Basilicata.

==Major peaks==
The Apennines include about 21 peaks over {{convert|1900|m|ft|abbr=on}}, the approximate tree line (counting only the top peak in each massif). Most of these peaks are located in the Central Apennines.&lt;ref name=P73/&gt;

'''Aquascaping''' is the craft of arranging [[aquatic plant]]s, as well as rocks, stones, cavework, or [[driftwood]], in an aesthetically pleasing manner within an [[aquarium]]&amp;mdash;in effect, [[gardening]] under water. Aquascape designs include a number of distinct styles, including the garden-like Dutch style and the Japanese-inspired nature style.&lt;ref name=Hennig/&gt; Typically, an aquascape [[fishkeeping|houses fish]] as well as plants, although it is possible to create an aquascape with plants only, or with rockwork or other hardscape and no plants.

Although the primary aim of aquascaping is to create an artful underwater [[Landscape architecture|landscape]], the technical aspects of tank maintenance and the growth requirements of aquatic plants are also taken into consideration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fishtanksetups.com/aquascaping-guide-for-beginners/|title=Aquascaping 101 – An Introductory Guide for Beginners|date=2017-06-16|work=FishTankSetups|accessdate=2017-06-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many factors must be balanced in the [[fishkeeping#Aquarium maintenance|closed system]] of an aquarium tank to ensure the success of an aquascape. These factors include [[Filter (aquarium)|filtration]], maintaining [[carbon dioxide]] at levels sufficient to support [[photosynthesis]] underwater, [[Substrate (aquarium)|substrate and fertilization]], [[Aquarium lighting|lighting]], and [[algae]] control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=James|first=Barry|year=1986|title=A Fishkeeper's Guide to Aquarium Plants|location=London|publisher=Tetra Press/Salamander Books|isbn=0-86101-207-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dutch style ===
[[File:The Enchanted Garden by Shay Fertig.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|alt=Aquarium densely packed with clumps of fine-leaved plants, some with green leaves and some with red leaves. A large red fish swims at left.|Dutch style aquascape]]
The Dutch aquarium employs a lush arrangement in which [[List of freshwater aquarium plant species|multiple types of plants]] having diverse leaf colors, sizes, and textures are displayed much as terrestrial plants are shown in a [[flower garden]]. This style was developed in the [[Netherlands]] starting in the 1930s, as freshwater aquarium equipment became commercially available.&lt;ref name=Hennig/&gt; It emphasizes plants located on terraces of different heights, and frequently omits rocks and driftwood. Linear rows of plants running left-to-right are referred to as "Dutch streets".&lt;ref name=Dutch&gt;Hudson, Robert Paul (30 May 2008), [http://aquabotanic.blogspot.com/2008/05/by-robert-paul-hudson-this-article.html ''Going Dutch''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090810124000/http://aquabotanic.blogspot.com/2008/05/by-robert-paul-hudson-this-article.html |date=10 August 2009 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although many plant types are used, one typically sees neatly trimmed groupings of plants with fine, feathery foliage, such as ''[[Limnophila aquatica]]'' and various types of ''[[Hygrophila (plant)|Hygrophila]]'', along with the use of red-leaved ''[[Alternanthera reineckii]]'', ''[[Ammania gracilis]]'', and assorted [[Rotala (plant)|''Rotala'']] for color highlights.&lt;ref name=Dutch/&gt; More than 80% of the aquarium floor is covered with plants, and little or no substrate is left visible.&lt;ref name=Dutch/&gt; Tall growing plants that cover the back glass originally served the purpose of hiding bulky equipment behind the tank.&lt;ref name=Hennig&gt;Hennig, Matt (June 2003), Amano versus Dutch: Two art forms in profile, ''Tropical Fish Hobbyist'', pp. 68&amp;ndash;74.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Japanese styles ===
==== Nature style ====
[[File:Peter Kirwan Mountainscape.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|alt=Aquarium with multiple gray stones. The stones are arranged to be low in front and high in the back, with the stones along the back placed vertically in the shape of mountain peaks. Some of the stones are carpeted with small, low, fine, green plants.|A nature style aquascape, suggesting mountains]]
A contrasting approach is the "nature aquarium" or Japanese style, introduced in the 1990s by [[Takashi Amano]].&lt;ref name=Hennig/&gt; Amano's three-volume series, ''Nature Aquarium World,'' sparked a wave of interest in aquarium gardening, and he has been cited as having "set a new standard in aquarium management".&lt;ref&gt;[[Herbert R. Axelrod|Axelrod, Herbert R.]], Warren E. Burgess, Neal Pronek, Glen S. Axelrod and David E. Boruchowitz (1998), ''Aquarium Fishes of the World'', Neptune City, N.J.: T.F.H. Publications, p. 718, {{ISBN|0-7938-0493-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Amano's compositions drew on [[Japanese garden]]ing techniques that attempt to mimic natural landscapes by the asymmetrical arrangement of masses of relatively few species of plants, and which set rules governing [[Japanese rock garden|carefully selected stones]] or driftwood, usually with a single focal point. The objective is to evoke a terrestrial landscape in miniature, rather than a colorful garden. This style draws particularly from the [[Japanese art#Aesthetic concepts|Japanese aesthetic concepts]] of {{nihongo|''[[Wabi-sabi]]''|侘寂}}, which focuses on [[Mono no aware|transience]] and minimalism as sources of beauty. Plants with small leaves like [[List of freshwater aquarium plant species#Listed alphabetically by scientific name|''Glossostigma elatinoides'']], ''[[Eleocharis acicularis]]'', ''[[Eleocharis parvula]]'', ''[[Echinodorus tenellus]]'', [[List of freshwater aquarium plant species#Listed alphabetically by scientific name|''Hemianthus callitrichoides'']], ''[[Riccia fluitans]]'', [[Süsswassertang|small aquatic ferns]], ''[[Staurogyne]] repens'', and [[Java moss]] (''Versicularia dubyana'' or ''Taxiphyllum barbieri'') are often used to emulate grass or moss. Colors are more limited than in the Dutch style, and the hardscape is not completely covered. Fish, or [[Shrimp#Aquaria|freshwater shrimp]] such as ''[[Caridina multidentata]]'' and [[Cherry shrimp|''Neocaridina heteropoda'']], are usually selected to complement the plants and control algae, but for reasons of minimalism the number of species are often limited.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aquascapinglove.com/basics/nature-aquarium-style/ The Nature Aquarium Style], 8 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Iwagumi style====
[[File:Aquascaping-minilandschaft-lennart.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|alt=Aquarium with gray stones arranged to form a tall pointed structure at the right, and a similar but smaller structure at the left. The stone peaks and the foreground are largely but not entirely covered by a short layer of fine textured green plants.|Iwagumi style aquascape, with the ''Oyaishi'' stone at the right]]
The Iwagumi style is a specific subtype of the nature style. The {{nihongo|''Iwagumi''|岩組}} term itself comes from the Japanese "rock formation" and refers to a layout where stones play a leading role.&lt;ref&gt;"Iwagumi and Sanzon Iwagumi Aquariums," [http://www.aquatic-eden.com/2007/02/iwagumi-and-sanzon-iwagumi-aquariums.html Aquatic Eden website], 11 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Iwagumi'' style, each stone has a name and a specific role. Rocks provide the bony structure of the aquascape and the typical geometry employs a design with three main stones, with one larger stone and two other smaller stones, although additional rocks can also be used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aquascapinglove.com/basics/introduction-iwagumi-layout/ The Iwagumi Layout: An Introduction], 7 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The {{nihongo|''Oyaishi''|親石}}, or main stone, is placed slightly off-center in the tank, and {{nihongo|''Soeishi''|添石}}, or accompanying stones, are grouped near it, while {{nihongo|''Fukuseki''|副石}}, or secondary stones, are arranged in subordinate positions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Takashi Amano|Amano, Takashi]] (2009), How to improve your Iwagumi layout, ''The Aquatic Gardener'', vol. 22, number 1, pp. 37&amp;ndash;41.&lt;/ref&gt; The location of the focal point of the display, determined largely by the asymmetric placement of the ''Oyaishi'', is considered important, and follows ratios that reflect [[Pythagorean tuning]].&lt;ref&gt;"The Golden Rule of Aquascaping," [http://www.aquatic-eden.com/2006/11/golden-rule-of-aquascaping.html Aquatic Eden website], 16 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jungle style===
[[File:Jungle style aquascape.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.3|alt=Aquarium densely filled with plants, some of which have rosettes of strap-like leaves, and the leaves are intertwined with one another. Some red and blue fishes of various sizes are swimming around.|Jungle style aquascape]]
Some hobbyists also refer to a "jungle" (or "wild jungle") style, separate from either the Dutch or nature styles, and incorporating some of the features of them both. The plants are left to assume a natural, untrimmed look. Jungle style aquascapes usually have little or no visible hardscape material, as well as limited open space. Bold, coarser leaf shapes, such as ''[[Echinodorus bleheri]]'', are used to provide a wild, untamed appearance. Unlike nature syle, the jungle style does not follow clean lines, or employ fine textures. A jungle canopy effect can be obtained using combinations of darker substrates, tall plants growing up to the surface, and floating plants that block light, offering a dappled lighting effect. Other plants used in jungle style aquascapes include ''[[Microsorum pteropus]]'', ''[[Bolbitis heudelotii]]'', ''[[Vallisneria americana]]'', ''[[Crinum]]'' species, ''[[Aponogeton]]'' species, ''[[Echinodorus]]'' species, ''[[Sagittaria subulata]]'', ''[[Hygrophila (plant)|Hygrophila]] pinnatifida'', ''[[Anubias]]'' species, and ''[[Limnobium laevigatum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukaps.org/documents/A%20Guide%20To%20Aquascaping.pdf|title=Our guide to aquascaping styles|last=Farmer|first=George|publisher=UK Aquatic Plant Society|accessdate=28 September 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100815084807/http://www.ukaps.org/documents/A%20Guide%20To%20Aquascaping.pdf| archivedate= 15 August 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aquaportail.com/definition-5493-aquascaping.html|last=Terver|first=Denis|title=Définition de aquascaping|language=French|year=2009|work=Aquaportail|accessdate=28 September 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090922213952/http://www.aquaportail.com/definition-5493-aquascaping.html| archivedate=22 September 2009&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Biotopes ===
[[File:AquariumArtis.jpg|thumb|alt=Aquarium with large stones of various shapes piled high. Some bare sticks are at right, and blue and yellow fish swim in the water.|This [[Lake Malawi]] biotope with [[cichlid]]s is at the [[Natura Artis Magistra|Artis Aquarium]], Amsterdam. Note the absence of green plants in this [[Rift Valley lakes|rift lake]] habitat.]]
The styles above often combine plant and animal species based on the desired visual impact, without regard to geographic origin. [[Biotope#Aquaria|Biotope aquariums]] are designed instead to replicate exactly a particular aquatic habitat at a particular geographic location, and not necessarily to provide a gardenlike display. Plants and fish need not be present at all, but if they are, they must match what would be found in nature in the habitat being represented, as must any gravel and hardscape, and even the chemical composition of the water. By including only those organisms that naturally exist together, biotopes can be used to study ecological interactions in a relatively natural setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|James|1986|pp=37&amp;ndash;45}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Biotope Aquaria," [http://fish.mongabay.com/biotope.htm Mongabay.com], 7 December 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Paludariums ===
[[File:OfficeSetup13..jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.3|alt=An aquarium viewed from the front. At the bottom front, dark substrate material is built up high at the left and right sides, and low in the center, and its surface is covered by tiny green plants. Water fills the center of the tank, to about halfway up the total height of the tank. Many and various larger plants grow above the water, and over the back wall of the aquarium.|A paludarium]]
A [[paludarium]] is an aquarium that combines water and land inside the same environment. These designs can represent habitats including tropical [[rainforest]]s, [[jungles]], [[Stream bank|riverbanks]], [[bogs]], or even the [[beach]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drsfostersmith.com/pic/article.cfm?c=6016&amp;articleid=1446 Paludariums: Discover Water Garden Terrariums!]&lt;/ref&gt; In a paludarium, part of the aquarium is underwater, and part is above water. Substrate is built up so that some "land" regions are raised above the waterline, and the tank is only partially filled with water. This allows plants, such as ''[[Cyperus alternifolius]]'' and ''[[Spathiphyllum wallisii]]'', as well as various ''[[Anubias]]'' and some [[Bromeliaceae|bromeliads]], to grow [[wikt:emersed|emersed]], with their roots underwater but their tops in the air, as well as completely submersed. In some configurations, plants that float on the surface of the water, such as ''[[Eichhornia crassipes]]'' and ''[[Pistia|Pistia stratiotes]]'', can be displayed to full advantage. Unlike other aquarium setups, paludariums are particularly well-suited to keeping [[amphibian]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paludariums.net/ Paludariums.net].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Saltwater reefs ===
[[File:Reef Aquarium At Home.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|alt=Aquarium filled densely with corals in many shapes, and bright colors including pink, purple, blue and green.|Reef aquascape]]
{{Main|Reef aquarium}}
Dutch and nature style aquascapes are traditionally [[Freshwater aquarium|freshwater systems]]. In contrast, relatively few ornamental plants can be grown in a [[Marine aquarium|saltwater aquarium]]. Saltwater aquascaping typically centers, instead, on mimicking a [[coral reef|reef]]. An arrangement of [[live rock]] forms the main structure of this aquascape, and it is populated by [[coral]]s and other [[marine invertebrates]] as well as [[coralline algae]], which together serve much the same aesthetic role as freshwater plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|ref=harv|last=Borneman|first=Eric H.|year=2004|title=Aquarium Corals: Selection, Husbandry, and Natural History|location=Neptune City, N.J.|publisher=T.F.H. Publications|pages=323&amp;ndash;341|isbn=1-890087-47-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael, Scott W. (November 2006), Aquascaping reef habitats, ''[[Aquarium Fish International|Aquarium Fish Magazine]]'', pp. 66&amp;ndash;73.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lighting plays a particularly significant role in the reef aquascape. Many corals, as well as [[Tridacna|tridacnid clams]], contain [[Symbiosis|symbiotic]] [[Fluorescence in the life sciences|fluorescent]] algae-like [[dinoflagellate]]s called [[zooxanthellae]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Borneman|2004|pp=47&amp;ndash;55}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By providing intense lighting supplemented in the [[ultraviolet]] wavelengths, reef aquarists not only support the health of these invertebrates, but also elicit particularly bright colors emitted by the fluorescent microorganisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Borneman|2004|pp=326&amp;ndash;334}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Techniques==

A rectangular glass aquarium tank sits on a wooden stand with carved, curled legs, and contains two fish as well as plants with wavy grass-like leaves.|From the [[Victorian era]], aquarists have planted their tanks, as seen in this 1856 example containing ''[[Vallisneria spiralis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parlouraquariums.org.uk/Papers/b%20AQUARIUM%20HISTORY/History%20Papers/Parlour%20aquarum.htm |title=The first Parlour Aquariums and the Victorian Aquarium Craze |last=Alexander |first=Bob |date=November 2005 |work=History of parlour aquarium |publisher=parlouraquariums.org |accessdate=24 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722221227/http://www.parlouraquariums.org.uk/Papers/b%20AQUARIUM%20HISTORY/History%20Papers/Parlour%20aquarum.htm |archivedate=22 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In addition to design, freshwater aquascaping also requires specific methods to maintain healthy plants underwater. Plants are often trimmed to obtain the desired shape, and they can be positioned by tying them in place inconspicuously with thread.&lt;ref&gt;[[Takashi Amano|Amano, Takashi]] (2008), Nature aquarium techniques to create &amp; maintain an aquascape, ''The Aquatic Gardener'', vol. 21, number 2, pp. 8&amp;ndash;17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Turon, Lluis Ruscalleda (2009), How to use ''Riccia'' and Java moss in the aquarium, ''The Aquatic Gardener'', vol. 22, number 4, pp. 11&amp;ndash;13.&lt;/ref&gt; Most serious aquascapers use aquarium-safe fertilizers, commonly in liquid or tablet form, to help the plants fill out more rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|James|1986|p=16}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some aquarium substrates containing [[laterite]] also provide nutrients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|James|1986|p=28}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also necessary to support photosynthesis, by providing light and carbon dioxide. A variety of lighting systems may be used to produce the full [[visible spectrum|spectrum of light]], usually at 2&amp;ndash;4 [[watt]]s per gallon (0.5&amp;ndash;1 watts per litre).&lt;ref name=light /&gt; Lights are usually controlled by a timer that allows the plants to be acclimated to a set cycle.&lt;ref name=light&gt;{{Harvnb|James|1986|pp=20&amp;ndash;29}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the number of plants and fish, the aquascape may also require carbon dioxide supplementation. This can be accomplished with a simple homemade system, using a soda bottle filled with [[Yeast#Aquarium hobby|yeast]], warm water, and sugar, and connected to an [[airstone]] in the aquarium, or with a pressurized CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; tank that injects a set amount of carbon dioxide into the aquarium water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|James|1986|p=17}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nyberg, Tarah (2003), [http://www.aquatic-gardeners.org/Nyberg_yeast.ppt Yeast CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090718160153/http://www.aquatic-gardeners.org/Nyberg_yeast.ppt |date=18 July 2009 }}, (Retrieved 10 October 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nature style aquascape.png|thumb|upright=1.3|alt=Aquarium with dark pieces of twisted wood bending from the sides of the tank, towards the center. Dense green plants are all around. Just to the left of center is a darkly shadowed region.|Aquascape evoking an overgrown cave and decaying trees]]

Algae (including [[cyanobacteria]], as well as true algae) is considered distracting and unwanted in aquascaping, and is controlled in several ways. One is the use of [[algae eater|animals that consume algae]], such as some fish (notably [[cyprinid]]s of the genera [[Siamese algae eater|''Crossocheilus'']] and ''[[Gyrinocheilus]]'', and [[catfish]] of the genera ''[[Ancistrus]]'', ''[[Hypostomus]]'', and ''[[Otocinclus]]''), shrimp, or [[snail]]s, to clean the algae that collects on the leaves. A second is using adequate light and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to promote rapid growth of desired plants, while controlling nutrient levels, to ensure that the plants utilize all fertilizer without leaving nutrients to support algae.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|James|1986|pp=46&amp;ndash;47}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although serious aquascapers often use a considerable amount of equipment to provide lighting, filtration, and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; supplementation to the tank, some hobbyists choose instead to maintain plants with a minimum of technology, and some have reported success in producing lush plant growth this way.&lt;ref&gt;Lass, David A. (March 2009), Three tough planted tanks, ''[[Aquarium Fish International]]'', pp. 30&amp;ndash;37.&lt;/ref&gt;  This approach, sometimes called the "natural planted tank" and popularized by [[Diana Walstad]], can include the use of soil in place of aquarium gravel, the elimination of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; apparatus and most filtration, and limited lighting. Instead, only a few fish are kept, to limit the quantity of fish waste, and the plants themselves are used to perform the water-cleansing role typically played by aquarium filters, by utilizing what fish waste there is as fertilizer.&lt;ref&gt;Walstad, Diana (2003), ''Ecology of the planted aquarium: a practical manual and scientific treatise for the home aquarist'', 2nd edition, Ashland Ohio: Atlas Books, {{ISBN|0-9673773-1-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aquaticplantcentral.com/forumapc/el-natural |title=Online forum on the "Natural" method |publisher=Aquaticplantcentral.com |accessdate= 18 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contests ==

Early Dutch hobbyists began the practice of aquascape contests, with over 100 local clubs.&lt;ref name=Dutch/&gt; Judges had to go through about three years of training and pass examinations in multiple disciplines in order to qualify.&lt;ref name=Dutch/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbkm.nl |title='&amp;#39;Bondskeurmeesters'&amp;#39;: Judges' website |publisher=Cbkm.nl |accessdate= 18 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This competition continues to be held every year, under the auspices of the National Aquarium Society.&lt;ref name=Contest/&gt; There are three rounds, beginning with contests in local clubs. First-place local winners are entered in the second round, held in fifteen ''districtkeuring'' (districts). The winners at that level are then entered in the third round, which is the national championship.&lt;ref name=Contest&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbat.nl |title=NBAT Dutch contest website |publisher=Nbat.nl |accessdate= 18 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Dutch contest, the focus is not only on composition, but also on the biological well-being of the aquarium's inhabitants. Most points are, in fact, awarded for such biological criteria as fish health, plant health, and water quality. Unlike contests in other countries, the judges travel to each contestant's home to evaluate the tank, where they measure the water parameters themselves.&lt;ref name=Contest/&gt;

Large [[public aquarium]]s sometimes use aquascaping as part of their displays. As early as the 1920s, the [[New York Aquarium]] included a [[moray eel]] display tank that was decorated with [[calcareous]] [[tufa]] rock, arranged to resemble a coral reef, and supporting some [[Scleractinia|stony corals]] and [[Gorgonian|sea fans]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Haskins Townsend|Townsend, Charles Haskins]] (1922, reprinted 2004), ''The Public Aquarium: Its Construction, Equipment, and Management'', Honolulu: University Press of the Pacific, p. 17, {{ISBN|1-4102-1147-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Because they typically present wildlife from a particular habitat, modern day displays are often created to be biologically accurate biotopes.&lt;ref&gt;Buckley, Kate (2010), Planted aquaria for zoological parks, ''The Aquatic Gardener'', vol. 23, number 4, pp. 5–20.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bin Jiang''' is Professor in [[geographic information science]], [[geographic information systems]] or [[geoinformatics]] at the [[University of Gävle]], Sweden. He is affiliated to the [[Royal Institute of Technology]] Stockholm (KTH) through the KTH Research School at Gävle. He has been coordinating the Nordic Network in Geographic Information Science (NordGISci), and has organized a series of NordGISci summer schools for the Nordic young researchers. He is the founder and chair of the [[International Cartographic Association]] Commission on Geospatial Analysis and Modeling, and has established an ICA workshop series on the research topic. He is also an associate editor of the international journal: ''Computers, Environment and Urban Systems'' ([[Elsevier]]). He has developed the [[Head/tail Breaks]] a new classification for data with a heavy-tailed distribution.

==Education==
Jiang obtained his bachelor's and master's degrees respectively from [[Wuhan University]], formerly Wuhan Technical University of Surveying and Mapping, and Chinese Academy of Surveying and Mapping, Beijing, China. He took Doctorate in 1996 at the [[University of Utrecht]] and International Institute for Geo-Information Science and Earth Observation (ITC), the Netherlands.

==Work in space syntax==
Jiang joined the [[Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis]] (CASA), [[University College London]] as a senior research fellow in 1997, where he worked with Michael Batty for integrating [[space syntax]] into GIS. He developed Axwoman &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Flora and fauna==
[[File:Colobus angolensis.jpg|right|thumb|[[Ruwenzori colobus]]]]
There are bracken fields, sedge marshes and open fields, and primary, secondary and bamboo forests. Flora include [[Ericaceae|ericaceous]] [[shrub]] and wildflowers.&lt;ref name=BriggsBooth2010 /&gt; A total of 1,344 plant species have been recorded, including 187 endemic species and 18 species in the threatened category (CR, EN, and VU under the IUCN Red List (2010)).

123 mammal species are reported from the region, of which 19 are endemic and 14 are threatened. There has been large loss of animal species through poaching and hunting for bushmeat. Buffalo and elephants have been extirpated in the area. [[Chimpanzee]], [[L'Hoest's monkey|mountain monkey]], [[owl-faced monkey]], and more than 400 [[Angolan colobus]] have also been reported.&lt;ref name=albertinerift.org/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3214">'''Contour trenching''' is an agricultural technique that can be easily applied in [[arid]] [[sub-Sahara]] areas to allow for [[water conservation|water]], and [[soil conservation]], and to increase [[agricultural production]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fws.gov/fire/ifcc/esr/Treatments/contour-trenching.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/8072565/Decision_support_system_for_contour_trenching|title=Decision support system for contour trenching|first1=Anand |last1=Vishwakarma|first2=Vinod C|last2=Pande|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.indiaenvironmentportal.org.in/files/Watershed%20development.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fs.fed.us/rm/pubs_int/int_gtr334.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Pimpari Gavali Deep CCT 1.jpg|thumb|A deep continuous contour trench in [[Maharashtra]], India]]
[[File:Contour trenchline in India, Maharashtra.JPG|thumb|A contour trenchline in India]]

Between two trenches [[crop]]s can benefit during the [[growing season]] (when there is less rain) from the subsoil water reserve gathered during the [[Wet season|rainy season]].

==Advantages==
Immediate advantages are the following:
*The [[rainwater|rain water]] does not immediately run off the hill,
*Water does not [[evaporate]] uselessly
*The [[water balance]] is enhanced
*Crops do not suffer later on from [[water shortage]],
*[[Fertile soil]] particles are not lost by [[water erosion|water]] and [[wind erosion]].
*When the sun shines on the water, light and heat are reflected onto plants on the northern shore of the trench, this effect and the increased humidity create micro climates in the area. These micro climates can support plants from different hardiness zones.

==Techniques==
Trenches can be artificially dug along the [[contour line]]s. Water flowing down the hill is retained by the trench, and is infiltrating the soil below.

==Implementation==
Depending on the slope of the hill, the parallel trenches can be closer or further from one another.

Manually dug trenches are smaller. Machine dug trenches can be deeper. The dimensions, and the format of the trench should correspond to the local [[climate]] and [[soil|soil condition]]s. The trench should be big enough to keep all the water; no water should spoil over the downhill border. The upside of the trench should be protected against [[erosion]], by means of e.g. [[grass]], [[shrubs]], or [[fabric]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="44975">{{short description|Territory that does not possess full political independence as a sovereign state, yet remains administratively outside the territory of its controlling state}}
A '''dependent territory''', '''dependent area''' or '''dependency''' is a [[territory]] that does not possess full political [[independence]] or [[sovereignty]] as a [[sovereign state]] yet remains politically outside the controlling state's integral area.&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=United Nations General Assembly Resolution 1514}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A dependency is commonly distinguished from [[administrative division|subnational entities]] in that they are not considered to be part of the integral territory of the governing state. A subnational entity typically represents a division of the state ''proper'', while a dependent territory often maintains a great degree of autonomy from the controlling state. Historically, most colonies were considered to be dependencies of their controlling state. The dependencies that remain generally maintain a very high degree of political autonomy. At the same time, not all autonomous entities are considered to be dependencies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/Depts/dpi/decolonization/council.htm|title=United Nations Trusteeship Council|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and not all dependencies are autonomous. Most inhabited dependent territories have their own [[ISO 3166]] country codes.

Some political entities have a special position recognized by international treaty or agreement resulting in a certain level of autonomy or differences in immigration rules. These are sometimes considered dependencies,&lt;ref name="The Trusteeship System and Non-Self-Governing Territories"&gt;[http://unyearbook.un.org/1960YUN/1960_P1_SEC3_CH4.pdf United Nations General Assembly 15th Session - The Trusteeship System and Non-Self-Governing Territories (pages:509-510)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320074502/http://unyearbook.un.org/1960YUN/1960_P1_SEC3_CH4.pdf |date=March 20, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.listaba.com/list/01000326594567/ Listaba.com]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; but are officially considered by their controlling states to be integral parts of the state.&lt;ref name="The Trusteeship System and Non-Self-Governing Territories"/&gt; Examples are [[Åland]] ([[Finland]]) and [[Hong Kong]] ([[China]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2006.html The World Factbook].

== Lists of similar entities ==
The following entities are according to the law of their state, integral parts of the state, but exhibit many characteristics of dependent territories. This list is generally limited to entities which are either subject to an international treaty on their status, uninhabited, or have a unique level of autonomy and are largely self-governing in matters other than international affairs. As a result, it does not include most entities with no unique autonomy, such as the [[overseas region|overseas regions]] of [[France]], the [[Home Nations]] of the [[United Kingdom]], or [[Alaska]] and [[Hawaii]], or only limited unique autonomy, such as the [[Autonomous Regions of Portugal]], [[autonomous communities of Spain]], or [[Zanzibar]]. Dependency claims without general international recognition, including all claims in [[Antarctica]], are listed in ''italics''.

===Australia===

Although all territories of [[Australia]] are considered to be fully integrated in its [[Federation|federative system]], and the official status of an external territory does not differ largely from that of a mainland territory (except in regards to immigration law), debate remains as to whether the external territories are integral parts of Australia, due to their not being part of Australia in 1901, when its constituent states [[Federated state|federated]] (with the exception of Coral Sea Islands which was part of [[Queensland]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

== Description ==
Three [[Crown dependencies]] are in a form of association with the [[United Kingdom|UK]]. They are independently administrated jurisdictions, although the British Government is solely responsible for defence and international representation, and has ultimate responsibility for ensuring good government. They do not have diplomatic recognition as independent states, but they are not an integrated part of the UK, nor do they form part of the [[European Union]]. The UK Parliament retains the ability to legislate for the Crown dependencies even without the agreement of the insular legislatures. None of the Crown dependencies has representatives in the UK Parliament. [[Bermuda]] and [[Gibraltar]] have similar relationships to the UK as the Crown dependencies. While Britain is officially responsible for defence and international representation, these jurisdictions maintain their own militaries and have been granted limited diplomatic powers, in addition to having internal self-government. Nevertheless, they are [[British Overseas Territories]].

New Zealand and dependencies share the same [[Governor-General of New Zealand|Governor-General]] and constitute one [[Realm of New Zealand|realm]]. The [[Cook Islands]] and [[Niue]] are officially termed [[associated state]]s.

[[Puerto Rico]] (since 1952) and the [[Northern Mariana Islands]] (since 1986) are non-independent states freely associated with the [[United States]].
The mutually negotiated Covenant to Establish a Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) in Political Union with the United States was approved in 1976. The Covenant was fully implemented November 3, 1986, pursuant to Presidential Proclamation no. 5564, which conferred United States citizenship on legally qualified CNMI residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Northern Mariana Islands at the CIA's page|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/cq.html|publisher=CIA|accessdate=2010-07-15|author=CIA|date=2010-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[Constitution of Puerto Rico]], Puerto Rico is described as a Commonwealth and Puerto Ricans have a degree of [[autonomous entity|administrative autonomy]] similar to citizens of a [[U.S. state]]. Puerto Ricans "were collectively made [[U.S. citizenship#Birthright citizenship|U.S. citizens]]" in 1917 as a result of the [[Jones-Shafroth Act]].&lt;ref&gt;The Louisiana Purchase and American Expansion: 1803-1898. By Sanford Levinson and Bartholomew H. Sparrow. New York: Rowman and Littlefield Publishers. 2005. Page 166, 178. "U.S. citizenship was extended to residents of Puerto Rico by virtue of the Jones Act, chap. 190, 39 Stat. 951 (1971) (codified at 48 U.S.C. § 731 (1987)")&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Puerto Rico at the CIA's page|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/rq.html|publisher=CIA|accessdate=2010-07-15|author=CIA|date=2010-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commonly used name in Spanish of the [[Commonwealth (United States insular area)|Commonwealth]] of [[Puerto Rico]], ''Estado Libre Asociado de Puerto Rico'', literally "Associated Free State of Puerto Rico", which sounds similar to "free association" particularly when loosely used in Spanish, is sometimes erroneously interpreted to mean that Puerto Rico's relationship with United States is based on a [[Compact of Free Association]] and at other times erroneously held to mean that Puerto Rico's relationship with United States is based on an [[Interstate compact]]. This is a constant source of ambiguity and confusion when trying to define, understand and explain Puerto Rico's political relationship with the United States. For various reasons [[Politics of Puerto Rico|Puerto Rico's political status]] differs from that of the Pacific Islands that entered into Compacts of Free Association with the United States. As sovereign states, these islands have full right to conduct their own foreign relations, while the [[Commonwealth (United States insular area)|Commonwealth]] of [[Puerto Rico]] has territorial status subject to United States congressional authority under the Constitution's Territory Clause, "to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory… belonging to the United States.".&lt;ref name="FinalReport"&gt;[http://www.prfaa.com/eng/PuertoRicoBookletFinal.pdf December 2005 report of the President's Task Force on Puerto Rico's Status] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326093201/http://www.prfaa.com/eng/PuertoRicoBookletFinal.pdf |date=2009-03-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Puerto Rico does not have the right to unilaterally declare independence, and at the last referendum (1998) the narrow majority voted for "none of the above", which was a formally undefined alternative used by commonwealth supporters to express their desire for an "enhanced commonwealth" option.&lt;ref name="FinalReport"/&gt;

This kind of relationship also can be found in the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]], which is a [[federacy]]. The [[Netherlands|continental part]] is organized like a unitary state but the status of its territories ([[Aruba]], since 1986, and the [[Netherlands Antilles]], since 1954 until 2010) can be considered dependencies or "associated non-independent states". After the split-up of the Netherlands Antilles, [[Curaçao]] and [[Sint Maarten]] are separate associated states like Aruba.

Additionally, [[Denmark]] operates in a similar manner to a federacy. The [[Faroes]] and [[Greenland]] are two self-governing territories, or regions within the Kingdom. The relationship between Denmark proper and the two territories is semi-officially termed the "[[Rigsfællesskabet]]".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5217">The '''Dépôt de la Guerre''' was France's military archive and cartography department, set up in 1688 under [[Louis XIV]] and expanded during the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] and the [[Napoleonic Wars]].

==History==
Established by [[François Michel Le Tellier de Louvois]], it was put in charge of gathering, conserving, engraving and publishing historical archives, military memoirs, maps and plans and all topographic activity. In the 18th century lieutenant-general Vault played a notable part in the Dépôt's work.

However, the staff provided for it were insufficient for its initial ambitions - a large part of its personnel shifted to the [[Bureau des longitudes]] and the [[Service hydrographique et océanographique de la marine|Service hydrologique de la Marine]].&lt;ref name = Bret/&gt;

[[Pierre Dupont de l'Étang]] was briefly put in charge of the Dépôt from May to September 1797, followed by [[Jean Ernouf]] from September 1797 to October 1798 and [[Hugues Alexandre Joseph Meunier]] until December 1799.&lt;ref name = Six/&gt; Under the [[First French Empire]] it was headed by [[Henri Jacques Guillaume Clarke]] from December 1799 to September 1800, [[Antoine François Andréossy]] from August 1802 to May 1803, [[Nicolas Antoine Sanson]] from June 1803 to June 1805&lt;ref name = Six/&gt;. It flourished during this period, employing 90 geographical engineers and a huge archive of documents, mapping the [[Cisalpine Republic]], [[Liguria]] and the newly-annexed [[Cisrhenian Republic]] among others. The corps of engineer geographers was definitively recreated in January 1909.&lt;ref name = Bret/&gt;

Réorganisé en 1814, puis en 1823, il est supprimé en 1887, où il est scindé en deux organismes distincts :
* le Service géographique de l'armée (SGA), devenu en 1940 l'[[Institut national de l'information géographique et forestière|Institut géographique national]] (IGN) ;
* le service historique de l'armée (SHA), ultérieurement service historique de l'armée de terre (SHAT), actuel [[Service historique de la défense]] (SHD).

'''Edgelands''' are the transitional, [[Liminality|liminal]] areas of space to be found on the boundaries of country and town - with the spread of [[urbanisation]], an increasingly important facet of the twenty-first century world.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Walker - 2002 Aspects of Lincoln: Discovering Local History - Page 134 1473836131 "AN 'EDGE-LAND': THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE WITHAM VALLEY EAST OF CANWICK ROAD by Dennis Mills THE TERM 'EDGE-LAND' has been coined recently for the concept of a neglected area on the fringe of a city. Frequently such ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The concept of Edgelands was introduced by [[Marion Shoard]] in 2002, to cover the disorganised but often fertile hinterland between planned town and over-managed country.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/our-beautiful-edgelands-a-dark-light-on-the-edge-of-town-2217071.html Our beautiful edgelands]&lt;/ref&gt;  However a century and a half earlier, [[Victor Hugo]] had already highlighted the existence of what he called "bastard countryside...ugly but bizarre, made up of two different natures, which surrounds certain great cities";&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in [[Robert Macfarlane (writer)|Robert Macfarlane]], ''Landmarks'' (2015) p. 231&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Richard Jeffries]] similarly explored the London edgeland in ''Nature near London'' (1883).
[[Alice Coleman]] (Kings College London, dept geography) in 2nd Land Use Survey of Great Britain, refers to  "rurban fringe". Indicating a similar landscape but with negative overtones.

Nevertheless it was only in the last decades of the twentieth century - as a distinct realm of Nature increasingly disappeared beneath the commodifying impact of globalising [[late capitalism]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederic Jameson]], ''The Jameson Reader'' (2002) p. 251&lt;/ref&gt; - that the significance of the unstructured borderlands between organised town and organised country, part man-made, part natural,&lt;ref&gt;M. Pratt, ''My Wild Northumbria'' (2015) p. 176 and 208&lt;/ref&gt; both for wildlife and for human exploration, came into fuller focus. [[Psychogeography]] charted the London orbital, while bombsites, canal banks and brownfield sites were documented in poetry and prose, film and photography;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Macfarlane, ''Landmarks'' (2015) p. 232&lt;/ref&gt; and the borderlands as an untapped, transgressive resource became almost the object of a new cult.&lt;ref&gt;T. Fry, ''Design in the Borderlands'' (2014) p. 159&lt;/ref&gt;

The grid is designated as Grid_ETRS89-LAEA5210. For identification of an individual resolution level, the name is extended by identification of cell size in metres (example: _100K).

The origin of Grid_ETRS89-LAEA5210 coincides with the [[false origin]] of the ETRS89-LAEA [[Spatial_reference_system|coordinate reference system]] (x=0, y=0). Grid points of grids based on ETRS89-LAEA must coincide with grid points at Grid_ETRS89-LAEA5210.

The grid is defined as hierarchical one in metric coordinates in power of 10.
The resolution of the grid is 1m, 10m, 100m, 1000m, 10,000m, 100,000m.
The grid orientation is south-north, west-east.
The reference point of the grid cell for grids based on ETRS89-LAEA is the lower left corner of the grid cell.

[[File:LocationChad.svg|thumb|Location of Chad]]
'''[[Chad]]''' is one of the 48 land-locked countries in the world and is located in North Central [[Africa]], measuring {{convert|1284000|km2|sqmi|0|sp=us}}, nearly twice the size of [[France]] and slightly more than three times the size of [[California]]. Most of its ethnically and linguistically diverse population lives in the south, with densities ranging from 54 persons per square kilometer in the Logone River basin to 0.1 persons in the northern B.E.T. ([[Borkou-Ennedi-Tibesti Region|Borkou-Ennedi-Tibesti]]) desert region, which itself is larger than France. The capital city of [[N'Djaména]], situated at the confluence of the [[Chari River|Chari]] and [[Logone River]]s, is cosmopolitan in nature, with a current population in excess of 700,000 people. 

Chad has four bioclimatic zones. The northernmost [[Sahara]]n zone averages less than {{convert|200|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} of rainfall annually. The sparse human population is largely nomadic, with some livestock, mostly small ruminants and camels. The central Sahelian zone receives between {{convert|200|and|600|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} rainfall and has vegetation ranging from grass/shrub [[steppe]] to thorny, open savanna. The southern zone, often referred to as the Sudan zone, receives between {{convert|600|and|1000|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}, with woodland [[savanna]] and deciduous forests for vegetation. Rainfall in the Guinea zone, located in Chad's southwestern tip, ranges between {{convert|1000|and|1200|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}.

The country's topography is generally flat, with the elevation gradually rising as one moves north and east away from [[Lake Chad]]. The highest point in Chad is [[Emi Koussi]], a mountain that rises {{convert|3100|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in the northern [[Tibesti Mountains]]. The [[Ennedi Plateau]] and the [[Ouaddaï highlands]] in the east complete the image of a gradually sloping basin, which descends towards Lake Chad. There are also central highlands in the Guera region rising to {{convert|1500|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.

[[Lake Chad]] is the second largest lake in west Africa and is one of the most important wetlands on the continent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/6261447.stm BBC News - Lake Chad fishermen pack up their nets]&lt;/ref&gt; Home to 120 species of fish and at least that many species of birds, the lake has shrunk dramatically in the last four decades due to increased water usage from an [[Human overpopulation|expanding population]] and low rainfall. Bordered by Chad, [[Niger]], [[Nigeria]], and [[Cameroon]], Lake Chad currently covers only 1350 square kilometers, down from 25,000 square kilometers in 1963. The Chari and Logone Rivers, both of which originate in the Central African Republic and flow northward, provide most of the surface water entering Lake Chad. Chad is also next to Niger. 

==Geographical placement==
[[File:Chad sat.jpg|thumb|250px|A satellite image of Chad.]]
[[File:Chad nasa satellite.png|thumb|250px|A satellite image of Chad.]]
[[File:Chad Topography.png|thumb|250px|A topographic map of Chad.]]
Located in north-central Africa, Chad stretches for about 1,800 kilometers from its northernmost point to its southern boundary. Except in the far northwest and south, where its borders converge, Chad's average width is about 800 kilometers. Its area of 1,284,000 square kilometers is roughly equal to the combined areas of [[Idaho]], [[Wyoming]], [[Utah]], [[Nevada]], and [[Arizona]]. Chad's neighbors include [[Libya]] to the north, [[Niger]] and [[Nigeria]] to the west, [[Sudan]] to the east, [[Central African Republic]] to the south, and [[Cameroon]] to the southwest.

Chad exhibits two striking geographical characteristics. First, the country is landlocked. [[N'Djamena]], the capital, is located more than 1,100 kilometers northeast of the [[Atlantic Ocean]]; [[Abéché]], a major city in the east, lies 2,650 kilometers from the [[Red Sea]]; and [[Faya-Largeau]], a much smaller but strategically important center in the north, is in the middle of the [[Sahara Desert]], 1,550 kilometers from the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. These vast distances from the sea have had a profound impact on Chad's historical and contemporary development.

The second noteworthy characteristic is that the country borders on very different parts of the African continent: [[North Africa]], with its [[Islamic culture]] and economic orientation toward the [[Mediterranean Basin]] and [[West Africa]], with its diverse religions and cultures and its history of highly developed states and regional economies;

Chad also borders [[Horn of Africa|Northeast Africa]], oriented toward the [[Nile|Nile Valley]] and the Red Sea region - and Central or Equatorial Africa, some of whose people have retained classical African religions while others have adopted [[Christianity]], and whose economies were part of the great [[Congo River]] system. Although much of Chad's distinctiveness comes from this diversity of influences, since independence the diversity has also been an obstacle to the creation of a national identity.

==Land==
Although Chadian society is economically, socially, and culturally fragmented, the country's geography is unified by the [[Lake Chad Basin]]. Once a huge inland sea (the Pale-Chadian Sea) whose only remnant is shallow Lake Chad, this vast depression extends west into Nigeria and Niger. The larger, northern portion of the basin is bounded within Chad by the Tibesti Mountains in the northwest, the Ennedi Plateau in the northeast, the Ouaddaï Highlands in the east along the border with Sudan, the Guéra Massif in central Chad, and the Mandara Mountains along Chad's southwestern border with Cameroon. The smaller, southern part of the basin falls almost exclusively in Chad. It is delimited in the north by the Guéra Massif, in the south by highlands 250 kilometers south of the border with Central African Republic, and in the southwest by the Mandara Mountains.

Lake Chad, located in the southwestern part of the basin at an altitude of 282 meters, surprisingly does not mark the basin's lowest point; instead, this is found in the [[Bodele]] and Djourab regions in the north-central and northeastern parts of the country, respectively. This oddity arises because the great stationary dunes (ergs) of the Kanem region create a dam, preventing lake waters from flowing to the basin's lowest point. At various times in the past, and as late as the 1870s, the Bahr el Ghazal Depression, which extends from the northeastern part of the lake to the Djourab, acted as an overflow canal; since independence, climatic conditions have made overflows impossible.

North and northeast of Lake Chad, the basin extends for more than 800 kilometers, passing through regions characterized by great rolling dunes separated by very deep depressions. Although vegetation holds the dunes in place in the Kanem region, farther north they are bare and have a fluid, rippling character. From its low point in the Djourab, the basin then rises to the plateaus and peaks of the Tibesti Mountains in the north. The summit of this formation—as well as the highest point in the Sahara Desert—is Emi Koussi, a dormant volcano that reaches 3,414 meters above sea level.

The basin's northeastern limit is the [[Ennedi Plateau]], whose limestone bed rises in steps etched by erosion. East of the lake, the basin rises gradually to the Ouaddaï Highlands, which mark Chad's eastern border and also divide the Chad and Nile watersheds. These highland areas are part of the [[East Saharan montane xeric woodlands]] [[ecoregion]].

Southeast of Lake Chad, the regular contours of the terrain are broken by the Guéra Massif, which divides the basin into its northern and southern parts. South of the lake lie the floodplains of the Chari and Logone rivers, much of which are inundated during the rainy season. Farther south, the basin floor slopes upward, forming a series of low sand and clay plateaus, called koros, which eventually climb to 615 meters above sea level. South of the Chadian border, the koros divide the Lake Chad Basin from the Ubangi-Zaire river system.

==Water systems==
{{Further|List of rivers of Chad|List of lakes of Chad}}

Permanent streams do not exist in northern or central Chad. Following infrequent rains in the Ennedi Plateau and Ouaddaï Highlands, water may flow through depressions called enneris and wadis. Often the result of flash floods, such streams usually dry out within a few days as the remaining puddles seep into the sandy clay soil. The most important of these streams is the Batha, which in the rainy season carries water west from the Ouaddaï Highlands and the Guéra Massif to Lake Fitri.

[[File:Chari River.jpg|thumb|240px|right|Chari River]]Chad's major rivers are the [[Chari River|Chari]] and the [[Logone River|Logone]] and their tributaries, which flow from the southeast into Lake Chad. Both river systems rise in the highlands of Central African Republic and Cameroon, regions that receive more than 1,250 millimeters of rainfall annually. Fed by rivers of Central African Republic, as well as by the Bahr Salamat, [[Bahr Aouk]], and Bahr Sara rivers of southeastern Chad, the Chari River is about 1,200 kilometers long. From its origins near the city of Sarh, the middle course of the Chari makes its way through swampy terrain; the lower Chari is joined by the Logone River near N'Djamena. The Chari's volume varies greatly, from 17 cubic meters per second during the dry season to 340 cubic meters per second during the wettest part of the year.

The Logone River is formed by tributaries flowing from Cameroon and Central African Republic. Both shorter and smaller in volume than the Chari, it flows northeast for 960 kilometers; its volume ranges from five to eighty-five cubic meters per second. At N'Djamena the Logone empties into the Chari, and the combined rivers flow together for thirty kilometers through a large delta and into Lake Chad. At the end of the rainy season in the fall, the river overflows its banks and creates a huge floodplain in the delta.

The seventh largest lake in the world (and the fourth largest in Africa), [[Lake Chad]] is located in the sahelian zone, a region just south of the Sahara Desert. The Chari River contributes 95 percent of Lake Chad's water, an average annual volume of 40 billion cubic meters, 95% of which is lost to evaporation. The size of the lake is determined by rains in the southern highlands bordering the basin and by temperatures in the Sahel. Fluctuations in both cause the lake to change dramatically in size, from 9,800 square kilometers in the dry season to 25,500 at the end of the rainy season.

Lake Chad also changes greatly in size from one year to another. In 1870 its maximum area was 28,000 square kilometers. The measurement dropped to 12,700 in 1908. In the 1940s and 1950s, the lake remained small, but it grew again to 26,000 square kilometers in 1963. The droughts of the late 1960s, early 1970s, and mid-1980s caused Lake Chad to shrink once again, however. The only other lakes of importance in Chad are Lake Fitri, in Batha Prefecture, and Lake Iro, in the marshy southeast.

==Climate==
{{See also|Chad#Climate|l1=Climate}}
[[File:Chad map of Köppen climate classification.svg|thumb|300px|Chad map of Köppen climate classification.]]
The Lake Chad Basin embraces a great range of tropical climates from north to south, although most of these climates tend to be dry. Apart from the far north, most regions are characterized by a cycle of alternating rainy and dry seasons. In any given year, the duration of each season is determined largely by the positions of two great air masses—a maritime mass over the Atlantic Ocean to the southwest and a much drier continental mass.

During the rainy season, winds from the southwest push the moister maritime system north over the African continent where it meets and slips under the continental mass along a front called the "intertropical convergence zone". At the height of the rainy season, the front may reach as far as Kanem Prefecture. By the middle of the dry season, the intertropical convergence zone moves south of Chad, taking the rain with it. This weather system contributes to the formation of three major regions of climate and vegetation.

===Saharan region===
[[File:Sand strom Chad.jpg|thumb|250px|A sandstorm at Abéché airport, Chad (2005).]]
The Saharan region covers roughly the northern half of the country, including Borkou-Ennedi-Tibesti Prefecture along with the northern parts of Kanem, Batha, and Biltine prefectures. Much of this area receives only traces of rain during the entire year; at Faya Largeau, for example, annual rainfall averages less than {{convert|30|mm|in|2|sp=us}}. Scattered small oases and occasional wells provide water for a few date palms or small plots of millet and garden crops.

In much of the north, the average daily maximum temperature is about {{convert|32|°C|1}} during January, the coolest month of the year, and about {{convert|45|°C}} during May, the hottest month. On occasion, strong winds from the northeast produce violent sandstorms. In northern Biltine Prefecture, a region called the Mortcha plays a major role in animal husbandry. Dry for nine months of the year, it receives {{convert|350|mm|in|1|sp=us}} or more of rain, mostly during July and August.

A carpet of green springs from the desert during this brief wet season, attracting herders from throughout the region who come to pasture their cattle and camels. Because very few wells and springs have water throughout the year, the herders leave with the end of the rains, turning over the land to the antelopes, gazelles, and ostriches that can survive with little groundwater.  Northern Chad averages over 3500 hours of sunlight per year, the south somewhat less.

===Sahelian region===
The semiarid sahelian zone, or Sahel, forms a belt about {{convert|500|km|mi|0|sp=us}} wide that runs from Lac and Chari-Baguirmi prefectures eastward through Guéra, Ouaddaï, and northern Salamat prefectures to the Sudanese frontier. The climate in this transition zone between the desert and the southern soudanian zone is divided into a rainy season (from June to early September) and a dry period (from October to May).

In the northern Sahel, thorny shrubs and acacia trees grow wild, while date palms, cereals, and garden crops are raised in scattered oases. Outside these settlements, nomads tend their flocks during the rainy season, moving southward as forage and surface water disappear with the onset of the dry part of the year. The central Sahel is characterized by drought-resistant grasses and small woods. Rainfall is more abundant there than in the Saharan region. For example, N'Djamena records a maximum annual average rainfall of {{convert|580|mm|in|1|sp=us}}, while Ouaddaï Prefecture receives just a bit less.

During the hot season, in April and May, maximum temperatures frequently rise above {{convert|40|°C}}. In the southern part of the Sahel, rainfall is sufficient to permit crop production on unirrigated land, and millet and sorghum are grown. Agriculture is also common in the marshlands east of Lake Chad and near swamps or wells. Many farmers in the region combine subsistence agriculture with the raising of cattle, sheep, goats, and poultry.

===Soudanian region===
The humid ''soudanian'' zone includes the southern prefectures of Mayo-Kebbi, Tandjilé, Logone Occidental, Logone Oriental, Moyen-Chari, and southern Salamat. Between April and October, the rainy season brings between {{convert|750|and|1250|mm|in|1|sp=us}} of precipitation. Temperatures are high throughout the year. Daytime readings in Moundou, the major city in the southwest, range from {{convert|27|°C|1}} in the middle of the cool season in January to about {{convert|40|°C}} in the hot months of March, April, and May.

The soudanian region is predominantly [[East Sudanian savanna]], or plains covered with a mixture of tropical or subtropical grasses and woodlands. The growth is lush during the rainy season but turns brown and dormant during the five-month dry season between November and March. Over a large part of the region, however, natural vegetation has yielded to agriculture.

===2010 drought===

On 22 June, the temperature reached {{convert|47.6|°C|°F}} in Faya, breaking a record set in 1961 at the same location. Similar temperature rises were also reported in [[Niger]], which began to enter a famine situation.&lt;ref name="MastersNOAA"&gt;{{cite web|last=Masters|first=Jeff|title=NOAA: June 2010 the globe's 4th consecutive warmest month on record|url=http://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/comment.html?entrynum=1544|work=Weather Underground|publisher=Jeff Masters' WunderBlog|accessdate=21 July 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100719104107/http://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/comment.html?entrynum=1544|archivedate=19 July 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Norway]] is a [[country]] located in Northern [[Europe]] on the western and northern part of the [[Scandinavian Peninsula]], bordering the [[North Sea]] to the southwest and the [[Skagerrak]] inlet to the south, the North [[Atlantic Ocean]] ([[Norwegian Sea]]) in the west and the [[Barents Sea]] to the northeast. Norway has a long land border with [[Sweden]] to the east, a shorter one with [[Finland]] in the northeast and a still shorter border with [[Russia]] in the far northeast.

Norway has a very elongated shape, one of the longest and most rugged coastlines in the world, and some 50,000 islands off the extremely indented coastline. [[Mainland]] Norway (''Fastlands-Norge''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kartverket.no/Systemsider/Ordbok/F/Fastlands-Norge/ |title=Fastlands-Norge |author= |date=6 December 2012 |website=kartverket.no}}&lt;/ref&gt;) covers 13° latitude, from [[58th parallel north|58°N]] to more than [[71st parallel north|71°N]], ([[Svalbard]] north to [[81st parallel north|81°N]]), and covers the longitude from [[5th meridian east|5°E]] in [[Solund]] to [[31st meridian east|31°E]] in [[Vardø]] ([[Jan Mayen]] to [[9th meridian west|9°W]], [[Kvitøya]] to [[33rd meridian east|33°E]]).

Norway is one of the world's most northerly countries, and one of Europe's most mountainous countries with large areas dominated by the [[Scandinavian Mountains]]; average elevation is {{Convert|460|m|feet}} and 32% of the mainland is located above the [[tree line]].

The country-length chain of peaks is geologically continuous with the mountains of [[Scotland]], [[Ireland]] and, crossing the [[Atlantic Ocean]], the [[Appalachian Mountains]] of [[North America]].  Geologists hold that all these formed a single range prior to the [[continental drift|breakup]] of the ancient [[supercontinent]] [[Pangaea]]. {{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}

Virtually the entire country was covered with a thick [[ice sheet]] during the [[Last glacial period|last ice age]], as well as in many earlier ice ages. The movement of the ice carved out deep [[valley]]s, and when the ice melted, the sea filled many of these valleys, creating Norway's famous [[fjord]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=July 2005 |url=http://www.unep-wcmc.org/sites/wh/westnor.html |archive-url=https://www.webarchive.org.uk/wayback/archive/20070115120000/http://www.unep-wcmc.org/sites/wh/westnor.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=15 January 2007 |title=Protected Areas and World Heritage - Norway |publisher=[[United Nations Environment Programme]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The land is still rebounding from the enormous weight of the ice ([[isostatic rebound]]), "growing out of the sea" several millimeters a year.  Rebound is greatest in the eastern part of the country and the inner part of the long fjords, where the ice cover was thickest. This is a slow process, and for thousands of years following the end of the ice age, the sea covered substantial areas of what is today dry land. The sea reached what is today an elevation of 221 m in [[Oslo]] (Aker), 25 m in [[Stavanger]], 5 m near [[Stad (peninsula)|Stad]], 180 m in [[Trondheim]], 50 m in [[Tromsø (city)|Tromsø]] and 75 m in [[Kirkenes]]. This old seabed is now among the best agricultural land in the country.{{facts|date=January 2016}}

The [[glacier]]s in the higher mountain areas today are not remnants of the large ice sheet of the ice age, their origins are more recent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bjerknes.uib.no/pages.asp?kat=2&amp;id=1438&amp;lang=1 |title=Bjerknes centre for climate research:Norways glaciers |author= |date= |website=uib.no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The regional [[climate]] was up to {{Convert|1-3|C-change|F-change|order=}} warmer in 7000 BC to 3000 BC in the [[Holocene climatic optimum]], (relative to the 1961-90 period), melting the remaining glaciers in the mountains almost completely during that period.

As a result of the ice carving, [[Sognefjorden]] is the world's second deepest fjord and [[Hornindalsvatnet]] is the deepest [[lake]] in [[Europe]].

==Physical geography==
[[File:View from a ridge between Segla and Hesten, Senja, Norway, 2014 August.jpg|thumbnail|upright=1.3|View from a ridge between Segla and Hesten, [[Senja (island)|Senja]], Norway]]
'''[[Scandinavian Mountains]]''':  the Scandinavian Mountains are the most defining feature of the country.  Starting with [[Setesdalsheiene]] north of the southern [[Skagerrak]] coast, the mountains go north, comprising large parts of the country, and intersected by the many fjords of [[Vestlandet]].  This part includes [[Hardangervidda]], [[Jotunheimen]] (with [[Galdhøpiggen]] at 2469&amp;nbsp;[[metres above sea level|m a.s.l.]]), [[Sognefjell]] and [[Trollheimen]] in the north, with large glaciers, such as [[Jostedalsbreen]], [[Folgefonna]] and [[Hardangerjøkulen]].  The mountain chain swings eastwards south of Trondheim, with ranges such as [[Dovrefjell]] and [[Rondane]], and reaches to the border with Sweden, where they are mostly gently sloping plateaus.  The mountains then follows the border in a northeasterly direction (known as [[Kjølen]]).  The mountains are intersected by many fjords in [[Nordland]] and [[Troms]], where they become more alpine and creates many islands as they meet the sea. The Scandinavian mountains forms the [[Lyngen Alps]] and reaches into northwestern [[Finnmark]], gradually becoming lower from [[Altafjord]] towards [[Nordkapp]] ([[North Cape, Norway|North Cape]]), where they finally ends at the shores of the [[Barents Sea]].

The Scandinavian Mountains have naturally divided the country in physical regions; [[valley]]s radiate from the mountains in all directions.  The following physical regions will only partially correspond to traditional regions and counties in Norway.

[[File:Tønsberg Raet kornåker.JPG|thumb|left|Landscape with grainfield in [[Tønsberg]], southeastern Norway.]]
'''[[Sørlandet|Southern coast]]''': the southern Skagerrak and [[North Sea]] coast is the lowland south of the mountain range, from Stavanger in the west to the western reaches of the outer part of the [[Oslofjord]] in the east.  In this part of the country, valleys tend to follow a north–south direction.  This area is mostly a hilly area, but with some very flat areas such as [[Lista]] and [[Jæren]].

'''[[Østlandet|Southeast]]''': the land east of the mountains (corresponding to Østlandet, most of [[Telemark]] and [[Røros]]) is dominated by valleys going in a north–south direction in the eastern part, and a more northwest - southeast direction further west, and the valleys congregate on the Oslofjord.  The longest valleys in the country are [[Østerdal]] and [[Gudbrandsdal]].  This part also contains larger areas of lowland surrounding the Oslofjord, as well as the [[Glomma]] river and lake [[Mjøsa]].

 |image2=Preikestolen view left.png |caption2=[[Lysefjorden]] seen from [[Prekestolen]] in the district of [[Ryfylke]] in [[Western Norway]]
}}
'''[[Vestlandet|Western fjords]]''': the land west of the mountains (corresponding to Vestlandet north of Stavanger) is more dominated by the mountain chain, as the mountains goes all the way to the coast, albeit gradually becoming lower towards the coast.  This part is dominated by large fjords, the largest are Sognefjord and [[Hardangerfjord]].  [[Geirangerfjord]] is often regarded as the ultimate fjord scenery. The coast is protected by a chain of skerries (the [[Skjærgård]]) arranged to parallel the coast and provide the beginning of a protected passage almost the entire 1,600&amp;nbsp;km route from Stavanger to Nordkapp.  The fjords and most valleys generally goes in a west–east direction, and further north a more northwest - southeast direction.

'''[[Trøndelag|Trondheim region]]''': the land north of Dovre (corresponding to Trøndelag except Røros) comprises a more gentle landscape with more rounded shapes and mountains, and with valleys congregating on the [[Trondheimsfjord]], where they open up and forms a larger lowland area. Further north is the valley of [[Namdalen]], opening up in the [[Namsos]] area. However, the [[Fosen]] peninsula, and the most northern coast ([[Leka, Norway|Leka]]) is more dominated by mountains and more narrow valleys.

'''[[Nord-Norge|Northern fjords]]''': the land further north (corresponding to Nordland, Troms and northwestern Finnmark) is again more dominated by pointed mountains going all the way to the coast, and numerous fjords.  The fjords and valleys generally lie in a west–east direction in the southern part of this area, and a more northwest - southeast direction further north. The [[Saltfjellet]] mountain range is an exception, as the valleys goes in a more north–south direction from these mountains.  This long area comprises many large islands, including [[Lofoten]], [[Vesterålen]] and [[Senja (island)|Senja]].

'''Far northeast''': the interior and the coast east of Nordkapp (corresponding to [[Finnmarksvidda]] and eastern Finnmark) is less dominated by mountains, and is mostly below {{convert|400|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The interior is dominated by the large Finnmarksvidda plateau. There are large, wide fjords going in a north–south direction. This coast lacks the small islands forming the [[skerry|skerries]] so typical of the Norwegian coast. Furthest to the east, the [[Varangerfjord]] goes in an east–west direction, and is the only large fjord in the country opening up towards the east.

===Arctic and Antarctic islands and claims===
'''[[Svalbard]]''': further north, in the [[Arctic ocean]], lies the Svalbard archipelago, which is also dominated by mountains, but these mountains are mostly covered by large glaciers, especially the eastern part of the archipelago, where glaciers cover more than 90%; [[Austfonna]] is the largest glacier in Europe. Unlike the mainland, these glaciers calves directly in the open ocean.

'''[[Jan Mayen]]''': to the far northwest, halfway towards [[Greenland]], is the island Jan Mayen, where [[Beerenberg]] is found, the only active [[volcano]] in Norway.

'''[[Bouvet Island]]''': located in the [[South Atlantic Ocean]] at [[54th parallel south|54°S]] and mostly covered by glaciers, this island is one of the most remote islands in the world, inhabited only by [[Pinniped|seals]] and birds.

'''[[Peter I Island]]''': this island in the South [[Pacific Ocean]] at [[69th parallel south|69°S]], [[90th meridian west|90°W]] is dominated by glaciers and a volcano. As with Bouvet Island, this island is regarded as an external [[Dependent area|dependency]], and not part of the kingdom.

'''[[Queen Maud Land]]''' is Norway's claim in [[Antarctica]]. This large, [[Circular sector|sectorial]] area stretches to the [[South Pole]] and are completely dominated by the world's largest [[ice sheet]], but with some impressive [[nunatak]]s penetrating above the ice. The [[Troll Research Station]] manned by Norway is located on a snow free mountain slope, the only station in Antarctica not to be located on the ice.

==Light, timezone and tide==
Areas in Norway located north of the [[Arctic Circle]] will have [[midnight sun]] and corresponding winter darkness, the length of both depends on the [[latitude]]. In [[Longyearbyen]], the upper part of the sun disc is above the horizon (provided clear view against the northern horizon) from  19 April to 23 August, and the winter darkness lasts from 27 October – 14 February. The corresponding dates for Tromsø are 17 May – 25 July, and 26 November – 15 January. The winter darkness is not totally dark on the mainland; there is twilight for a few hours around noon in Tromsø, but in Longyearbyen there is near total darkness in the midst of the dark period. Even the southern part of the country experiences large seasonal variations in daylight; in Oslo the sun rises at 03:54 and sets 22:54 at summer [[solstice]], but is only above the horizon from 09:18 - 15:12 at winter solstice.

The northern part of the country is located in the [[aurora borealis]] zone; the aurora is occasionally seen in the southern part of the country.

Norway uses [[Central European Time]], corresponding to the [[15th meridian east|15°E]] longitude. As the country is very elongated, this is at odds with the local daylight hours at the eastern and western parts. In Vardø the local daylight hours is 64 minutes earlier, and in Bergen it is 39 minutes later. Thus, Finnmark gains early morning daylight but loses evening daylight, and [[Vestlandet]] loses early morning light but gains more evening daylight with this timezone. [[Daylight saving time]] (GMT + 2) is observed from the last Sunday in March to the last Sunday in October.

The difference between low [[tide]] and high tide is small on the southern coast and large in the north; ranging from on average 0.17 m in [[Mandal, Norway|Mandal]] to about 0.30 m in Oslo and Stavanger, 0.90 m in Bergen, 1.80 m in Trondheim, Bodø and Hammerfest and as much as 2.17 m in [[Vadsø]].

[[File:Temp normal norway.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Annual average normal temperatures of Norway, 1961-1990]]
The climate of Norway is much more temperate than expected for such high [[latitude]]s; this is mainly due to the [[North Atlantic drift|North Atlantic Current]] with its extension, the [[Norwegian Current]], raising the air temperature,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.forskningsradet.no/servlet/Satellite?c=Nyhet&amp;pagename=norklima/Hovedsidemal&amp;cid=1253970052900&amp;p= |title=News - NORKLIMA |author= |date= |website=www.forskningsradet.no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the prevailing southwesterlies bringing the mild air on shore, as well as the general southwest - northeast orientation of the coast allowing the westerlies to penetrate into the [[Arctic]].

In July, the difference is reduced to {{convert|5.2|F-change|C-change|order=flip}}.  January average in [[Yakutsk]], situated inland in [[Siberia]] but slightly further south, is {{convert|76.0|F-change|C-change|order=flip}} colder than in Brønnøysund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldclimate.com/cgi-bin/data.pl?ref=N62E129+1202+0004088G2 |title=JAKUTSK USSR,  Weather History and Climate Data |author= |date= |website=www.worldclimate.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Precipitation===
Some areas of Vestlandet and southern Nordland are Europe's wettest due to [[orographic lift]], particularly where the moist westerlies first are intercepted by high mountains; this occurs slightly inland from the outer skerry guard. [[Brekke]] in [[Sogn og Fjordane]] has the highest annual precipitation with {{convert|3575|mm|1|abbr=on}}; annual precipitation can exceed {{convert|5000|mm|1|abbr=on}} in mountain areas near the coast. [[Lurøy]], near the Arctic Circle, gets 2,935&amp;nbsp;mm on average, a remarkable amount of precipitation for a polar location. Precipitation is heaviest in autumn and early winter along the coast, while April to June is the driest. The innermost parts of the long fjords are somewhat drier; annual precipitation in [[Lærdal]] is {{convert|491|mm|1|abbr=on}}, in [[Levanger]] {{convert|750|mm|1|abbr=on}} and only {{convert|300|mm|1|abbr=on}} in [[Skibotn]] at the head of [[Lyngenfjord]], the latter also has the national record for clear-weather days. The regions to the east of the mountains (including [[Oslo]]) have a more continental climate with less precipitation, and enjoy more sunshine and usually warmer summers; precipitation is highest in summer and early autumn (often brief, heavy showers) while winter and spring tend to be driest inland. Valleys surrounded by mountains can be very dry compared to nearby areas, and a larger area in the interior of Finnmark gets less than {{convert|400|mm|1|abbr=on}} of precipitation annually. [[Svalbard Airport]] has the lowest average annual precipitation with {{convert|190|mm|1|abbr=on}}, while [[Skjåk]] has the lowest average on the mainland with only {{convert|278|mm|1|abbr=on}}, the lowest ever recorded on the mainland is {{convert|64|mm|1|abbr=on}} at [[Hjerkinn]] in [[Dovre]]. Monthly averages varies from {{convert|5|mm|2|abbr=on}} in April in Skjåk to {{convert|454|mm|1|abbr=on}} in September in Brekke. Coastal areas from [[Lindesnes]] north to [[Vardø]] have more than 200 days/year with precipitation; however, this is with a very low threshold value (0.1&amp;nbsp;mm precipitation). The average annual number of days with at least {{convert|3|mm|2|abbr=on}} precipitation is 77 in Blindern/[[Oslo]], 96 in Kjevik/[[Kristiansand]], 158 in Florida/[[Bergen]], 93 in Værnes/[[Trondheim]] and 109 in [[Tromsø (city)|Tromsø]].&lt;ref&gt;Meteorologisk Institutt [http://met.no/met/vanlig_var/nedbor.html http://met.no/met/vanlig_var/nedbor.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Temperature===
The coast experiences much milder winters than other areas at the same latitudes. The temperature difference from the coldest month to the warmest is only {{convert|11|-|15|C-change}} in coastal areas; some lighthouses have a yearly amplitude of just {{convert|10|C-change}}, such as Svinøy in [[Herøy, Møre og Romsdal|Herøy]] with a coldest month of {{convert|2.7|C}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://met.no/observasjoner/more_og_romsdal/normaler_for_kommune_1515.html?kommuner |title=Herøy climate |author= |date= |website=met.no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amplitude of inland areas are larger, with a maximum difference of {{convert|30|C-change}} in [[Karasjok]]. [[Finnmarksvidda]] has the coldest winters in mainland Norway, but inland areas much further south can also see severe cold; [[Røros]] has recorded {{convert|-50|C}} and [[Tynset]] has a January average {{convert|-13|C}}.

[[File:Haglebunatten.JPG|thumb|left|The inland valleys have reliable snow cover in winter; [[Sigdal]] has a February average of {{convert|-7|C}} (1961-90). Due to [[Inversion (meteorology)|inversion]], the valley floor is often colder than the hillsides above during winter.]]
The islands in southern [[Lofoten]] are the most northerly locations in the world where all winter months have mean temperatures above {{convert|0|C}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yr.no/place/Norway/Nordland/V%C3%A6r%C3%B8y/V%C3%A6r%C3%B8y_helikopterhavn,_Tabbisodden/statistics.html |title=Weather statistics for  Værøy helikopterhavn, Tabbisodden |first=NRK og Meteorologisk |last=institutt |date= |website=yr.no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spring is the season when the temperature differences between the southern and northern part of the country is largest; this is also the time of year when daytime and nighttime temperatures differ the most. Inland valleys and the innermost fjord areas have less wind and see the warmest summer days; the Oslofjord lowland is warmest with 24 July-hr average of {{convert|17|C|1}}, but even [[Alta, Norway|Alta]] at [[70th parallel north|70°N]] has July average of {{convert|13.5|C}}, and commercial [[fruit]] [[orchard]]s are common in the innermost areas of the western fjords, but also in [[Telemark]]. Inland areas reach their warmth peak around mid-July, and coastal areas by the first half of August. Humidity is usually low in summer.

The North Atlantic Current splits in two in the northern part of the Norwegian Sea; one branch goes east into the Barents Sea, while the other goes north along the west coast of [[Spitsbergen]]; this modifies the Arctic [[polar climate]] somewhat and results in open water throughout the year at higher [[latitude]]s than any other place in the Arctic. On the eastern coast of the [[Svalbard]] [[archipelago]], the sea used to be frozen during most of the year, but the last years warming ([[Svalbard#Climate|graph]]) have seen open waters noticeably longer.

Normal monthly averages range from {{convert|-17.1|C}} in January in Karasjok {{convert|129|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} [[amsl]]&lt;ref&gt;Meteorologisk Institutt-Karasjok [http://met.no/observasjoner/finnmark/normaler_for_kommune_2021.html?kommuner http://met.no/observasjoner/finnmark/normaler_for_kommune_2021.html?kommuner] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071120082628/http://met.no/observasjoner/finnmark/normaler_for_kommune_2021.html?kommuner |date=20 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to {{convert|17.3|C}} in July in Oslo - Studenterlunden {{convert|15|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} amsl.&lt;ref&gt;Meteorologisk Institutt-Oslo [http://met.no/observasjoner/oslo/normaler_for_kommune_301.html?kommuner http://met.no/observasjoner/oslo/normaler_for_kommune_301.html?kommuner]&lt;/ref&gt; The warmest yearly average temperature is {{convert|7.7|C}} in [[Skudeneshavn]] in [[Karmøy]], and the coldest is {{convert|-3.1|C}} in [[Sihcajarvi]] in [[Kautokeino]] (excluding higher mountains and Svalbard); this is a {{convert|10.8|C-change}} difference, about the same as the temperature difference between Skudeneshavn and [[Athens]], Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldclimate.com/cgi-bin/data.pl?ref=N37E023+1102+16716W |title=ATHENS(HELLINIKON), GREECE Weather History and Climate Data |author= |date= |website=www.worldclimate.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The warmest temperature ever recorded in Norway is {{convert|35.6|C}} in [[Nesbyen]]. The coldest temperature ever recorded is {{convert|−51.4|C}} in [[Karasjok]]. The warmest month on record was July 1901 in Oslo, with a mean (24-hr) of {{convert|22.7|C}}, and the coldest month was February 1966 in Karasjok with a mean of {{convert|-27.1|C}}. Southwesterly winds further warmed by [[foehn]] can give warm temperatures in narrow fjords in winter; [[Tafjord]] has recorded {{convert|17.9|C}} in January and [[Sunndal]] {{convert|18.9|C}} in February.

Compared to coastal areas, inland valleys and the innermost fjord areas have larger [[diurnal temperature variation]], especially in spring and summer. In July, the average daily high temperature is {{convert|20.1|C}} in Lærdal and {{convert|17.8|C}} in Karasjok, roughly {{convert|3|C-change}} warmer than coastal locations at the same latitude (see table).

As seen from the table, Norway's climate shows large variations, but with the exception of a small area along the northeastern coast in [[Finnmark]], all areas below the treeline (populated areas) of the Norwegian mainland has a temperate or subarctic climate ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] groups C and D). Svalbard and Jan Mayen have polar climate (Köppen group E). More specifically, the climate is maritime mild temperate / [[marine west coast]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: Cfb) along the southwestern and part of the southern coast as in Bergen and Kristiansand; [[hemiboreal]] / [[humid continental]] (Dfb) in the lowlands in the southeast as in Oslo; cool maritime/subpolar oceanic (Cfc) along the northwestern coastal areas as in Svolvær; continental [[subarctic climate]] (Dfc) in inland valleys and highlands below the treeline in much of the country and reaching to the coast in the northernmost part as seen in Geilo, Bardufoss and Kirkenes; [[alpine tundra]] climate above the treeline in mountain areas all over the country as seen in Dovrefjell and Sognefjell. Polar [[tundra]] (ET) is found at Jan Mayen and in the Svalbard archipelago including Longyearbyen, and also includes a narrow area along the northeastern coast from Nordkapp to [[Vardø]] on the mainland. True ice cap climate (EF) can only be found at elevations higher than approximately 400–800 m in Svalbard and Jan Mayen, with the lowest temperatures on [[Nordaustlandet]].

====Climate since 1990====
Temperatures have tended to be higher in recent years, which may be a consequence of [[global warming]]. Using the same data source but with the more recent 20-year period 1991-2010 as base period, this results in winter temperatures for the same stations that are {{convert|1|to|2.5|C-change}} higher, while 24 July-hr average temperatures increases by approximately 1&amp;nbsp;°C. For Blindern/Oslo, the 1991-2010 period gives a January average of {{convert|-2.4|C}} and a 24 July-hour average of {{convert|17.4|C}}. For Bergen the corresponding temperatures are {{convert|2.6|and|15.5|C}}, for Værnes/Trondheim {{convert|-1.0|and|15.1|C}}, and for Langnes/Tromsø {{convert|-2.5|and|12.1|C}}. Compared to the 1961-90 period, a much larger area along the coast, from Kristiansand north to Svolvær, have average temperatures above freezing all year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://met.no/filestore/var2_2008.JPG |title=Map |author= |date= |website=met.no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a consequence of warming, summers last longer and winters are getting shorter; snow cover have tended to decrease in those lowland areas where winter temperatures often hover around freezing (including most major cities), while winter precipitation in the mountains and cold inland areas  falls as snow, and might have increased in higher mountain areas. Using these recent 20 years as base period would result in substantial areas in Norway being classified in a different climate zone compared to 1961-90; Oslo and Trondheim would be maritime temperate (Cfb), Tromsø cool maritime (Cfc), and Lillehammer, earlier located at the intersection between subarctic (Dfc) and humid continental (Dfb) climate, would be firmly humid continental. Substantial mountain areas above the treeline would eventually be wooded.
The strongest warming has been observed on Svalbard, where the years 2005–2007 have been the warmest ever observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://met.no/met/ver_100/klimahistorie/99840_aar07.jpg |title=Svalbard temperature history |author= |date= |website=met.no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to warming, precipitation have increased on the mainland, especially in autumn and winter, increasing [[erosion]] and the risk of [[landslide]]s.

==Biological diversity==
Due to the large latitudinal range of the country and the varied topography and climate, Norway has a larger number of different [[habitat (ecology)|habitats]] than almost any other European country. There are approximately 60,000 species of different lifeforms in Norway and adjacent waters (excluding bacteria and virus).

==Flora==
[[File:Floristic regions in Europe (english).png|thumb|Norway include parts of four floristic regions in the [[Circumboreal Region]].]]
Natural vegetation in Norway varies considerably, as can be expected in a country covering such a variation in latitude. There are generally fewer species of [[tree]]s in Norway than in areas in western North America with a similar climate. This is because the migration routes after the ice age is more difficult in the north–south direction in Europe, with bodies of water (like the [[Baltic Sea]] and the [[North Sea]]) and mountains creating barriers, while in America there is a continuous continent and the mountains follow a north–south direction. However, recent research using DNA- studies of spruce and pine and lake core sediments have proven that Norwegian conifers survived the ice age in ice - free refugees even north to [[Andøya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/03/120301143737.htm |title=Sturdy Scandinavian conifers survived Ice Age |author= |date= |website=sciencedaily.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many imported plants have been able to ripen seeds and spread, and less than half of the 2,630 plant species in Norway today actually occur naturally in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.environment.no/templates/PageWithRightListing____2246.aspx |title=Plants in Norway |author= |date= |website=environment.no}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 210 species of plants growing in Norway are listed as endangered, and 13 species are [[Endemic (ecology)|endemic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.plant-talk.org/country/norway.html |title=Plant talk.org |author= |date= |website=plant-talk.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The national parks in Norway are mostly located in mountain areas; about 2% of the productive forests in the country are protected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.forskning.no/kortnytt/273745 |title=26 nye skogreservater |author= |date= |website=forskning.no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Biogeographical regions Scandinavian mountains.png|thumb|left|Alpine Biogeographical Region of the [[Scandinavian Mountains]] as defined by the [[European Environment Agency]] and corrected by the [[Norwegian Directorate for Nature Management]]]]
Some plants are classified as western due to their need for high humidity and/or low tolerance of winter frost; these will stay close to the southwestern coast, with the northern limit near Ålesund; some examples are [[Ilex aquifolium|holly]] and [[Erica cinerea|bell heather]]. Some western species occur north to [[Helgeland]] (such as ''[[Erica tetralix]]''), some even to Lofoten (such as [[Luzula sylvatica]]).

The mild temperatures along the coast allows for some surprises; some hardy species of [[Arecaceae|palm]] grow even as far north as [[Sunnmøre]], one of the largest remaining [[Tilia|Linden forest]] in Europe grows at Flostranda in [[Stryn]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sognogfjordane.miljostatus.no/1-2005_flostranda_gKSGE.pdf.file |title=Flostranda nature reserve |author= |date= |website=miljostatus.no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and planted deciduous trees such as [[Horse-chestnut (tree)|horse chestnut]] and [[Fagus sylvatica|beech]] thrives north of the Arctic circle (as in [[Steigen]]).

Plants classified as eastern need comparatively more summer sunshine, with less humidity, but can tolerate cold winters; these will often occur in the southeast and inland areas, examples are ''[[Daphne mezereum]]'', ''[[Fragaria viridis]]'' and [[Veronica spicata|spiked speedwell]]. Some eastern species common in [[Siberia]] grows in the river valleys of eastern Finnmark. There are also species which seems to be in-between these extremes, like the southern plants, where both winter and summer climate is important (such as [[Quercus robur|pedunculate oak]], [[European ash]] and [[dog's mercury]]); other plants are dependent on the type of bedrock.

There are a considerable number of alpine species in the mountains in Norway; these will not tolerate summers that are comparatively long and warm or can not compete with plants adapted to a longer and warmer growing season; many [[alpine plant]]s are common in the North Boreal zone and some in the Middle Boreal zone, but their main area of distribution is on the alpine tundra in the Scandinavian mountains and on the Arctic tundra. Many of the most hardy species have adapted by using more than one summer to ripen seeds. Examples of alpine species are [[Ranunculus glacialis|glacier buttercup]], ''[[Draba lactea]]'' and ''[[Salix herbacea]]''. A well-known anomaly is the 30 American alpine species, which in Europe only grow in two mountainous parts of Norway; the Dovre-Trollheimen and Jotunheim mountains in the south and the [[Saltdal]] to western Finnmark in the north (Gjærevoll, 1992, pp 146–160; Moen, 1998, p 52). Other than in Norway, these species grow only in Canada and Greenland, such as the ''[[Braya linearis]]'' and ''[[Carex scirpoidea]]''. It is unknown whether these survived the ice age on some mountain peak penetrating the ice, or they spread from further south in Europe, or why did they not spread to other mountainous regions of Europe. Some alpine species have a wider distribution and also grow in Siberia, such as the ''[[Rhododendron lapponicum]]'' (Lapland rosebay). Other alpine species are common in the whole Arctic, some only grows in Europe, such as [[Trollius europaeus|globe-flower]].

The following vegetation zones in Norway are all based on botanical criteria (Moen, 1998; Gjærevoll 1992), although, as mentioned, some plants will have specific demands. Forests, bogs and wetlands, as well as heaths, are all included in the different vegetation zones; a South Boreal bog will differ from a North Boreal bog, although some plant species might occur on both.

===Nemoral===
[[File:Mandal. Strøkene Vestnes og litt av Støkkan.jpg|thumb|[[Mandal, Norway|Mandal]], the most southerly town in Norway; nemoral zone.]]

A small area along the southern coast, from [[Soknedal (Rogaland)|Soknedal]] in southern [[Rogaland]] and east to [[Fevik]] in [[Aust-Agder]] (including Kristiansand) belongs to the [[Nemoral]] vegetation zone. This zone is located below 150 m above sea level and at most 30&amp;nbsp;km inland along the valleys. This is the vegetation zone dominating Europe north of southern France, the Alps, the Carpathians and the Caucasus. The hallmark of this zone in Norway is the domination of [[oak]] and the virtual complete lack of typical [[boreal ecosystem|boreal]] species such as Norway spruce and [[grey alder]], although a lowland variant of [[Scots pine|pine]] occurs. Nemoral covers a total of 0.5% of the land area (excluding Svalbard and Jan Mayen).

===Hemiboreal (Boreonemoral)===
[[File:Bygdøy Oslo.jpg|thumb|left|[[Bygdøy]] October 2007; the hemiboreal lowland near [[Oslofjord]] has the highest diversity due to being closest to the migration route from the south.]]

The [[hemiboreal]] zone covers a total of 7% of the land area in Norway, including 80% of [[Østfold]] and [[Vestfold]]. This vegetation represents a mix of nemoral and boreal plant species, and belong to the [[Palearctic]] [[Sarmatic mixed forests]] PA0436 [[terrestrial ecoregion]]. The nemoral species tend to dominate slopes facing south - west and on good soil, while the boreal species dominate on slopes facing north and on waterlogged soil. In some areas other factors overrule this, as in areas where the bedrock gives little nutritients, where oak and the boreal [[Scots pine|pine]] often share domination. The boreonemoral zone follows the coast from [[Oslofjord]] north to [[Ålesund]], becoming discountineous north of [[Sunnmøre]]. In Oslo, this zone reaches an elevation of 200 m above sea, and it also reaches into some of the lower valleys and just reaches the lowland around [[Mjøsa]], but not as far north as [[Lillehammer]]. In the valleys of the south, this vegetation might exist up to 300 – 400 m above sea level. The zone follows the lowland of the west coast and into the largest fjords, reaching an elevation of 150 m here, even 300 meter in some sheltered fjords and valleys in [[Nordmøre]] with nutritients-rich soil. The northernmost locations in the world are several areas along the [[Trondheimsfjord]], such as [[Frosta]], and the northernmost single location is [[Byahalla]] in [[Steinkjer]]. Some nemoral species in this zone are [[English oak]], [[sessile oak]], [[Fraxinus excelsior|European ash]], [[Ulmus glabra|elm]], [[Norway maple]], [[Common hazel|hazel]], [[Alnus glutinosa|black alder]], [[Small-leaved lime|lime]], [[Common yew|yew]], [[holly]] (southwest coast), [[Prunus avium|wild cherry]], [[Allium ursinum|ramsons]], [[Fagus sylvatica|beech]] (a late arriver and only common in [[Vestfold]]) and [[Primula vulgaris|primrose]]. Typical boreal species are [[Norway spruce]], pine, [[downy birch]], grey alder, [[aspen]], [[rowan]], [[Anemone nemorosa|wood anemone]] and ''[[Viola riviniana]]''.

===Boreal===
[[File:Swamp landscape in Signaldalen with Otertinden 2, 2012 June.jpg|thumb|Bogs and lakes are common in the boreal zone; Signaldalen in [[Storfjord]] with Otertind mountain.]]

The boreal species are adapted to the long and cold winter, and most of these species can tolerate colder winter temperatures than winters in most of Norway; thus they are distinguished by their need for [[growing season]] length and summer warmth. [[Bog]]s are common in the boreal zone, with the largest areas in the North and Middle Boreal Zones, as well as in the area just above the tree line. The large boreal zone is usually divided into three subzones:

===South Boreal===
[[File:Lågendeltaet.jpg|thumb|left|[[Lågendeltaet]] in Lillehammer, south boreal zone.]]

The South Boreal zone (SB) is dominated by boreal species, especially [[Norway spruce]], and covers a total of 12% of the land area. The SB is the only boreal zone with a few scattered - but well-developed - warmth-demanding broadleaf deciduous trees, such as [[European ash]] and [[oak]]. A number of species in this zone needs fairly warm summers (SB has 3–4 months with a mean 24-hr temperature of at least 10&amp;nbsp;°C), and thus are not to be found or are very rare in the middle boreal zone. Some of the species not to be found further north are black alder, [[Humulus lupulus|hop]], [[Origanum vulgare|oregano]] and [[Viburnum opulus|guelder rose]]. This zone is found above the hemiboreal zone, up to 450 meter amsl in [[Østlandet]] and 500 m in the most southern valleys. In the eastern valleys it reaches several hundred kilometers into Gudbrandsdal and Østerdal, and up to [[Lom, Norway|Lom]] and [[Skjåk]] in [[Ottadalen]]. Along the southwestern coast, the zone reaches an elevation of 400 at the head of the large fjords (as in Lærdal), and about 300 m nearer to the coast. Norway spruce is lacking in [[Vestlandet]] ([[Voss]] is an exception). North of Ålesund, SB vegetation dominates in the lowland down to sea level, including the islands like [[Hitra]]. Most of the lowland in Trøndelag below 180 m elevation is SB, up to 300 m above sea level in the inland vallys such as [[Gauldalen]] and [[Verdalen]], and up to 100 m in [[Namdalen]]. The coastal areas and some fjord areas further north, such as [[Vikna]], [[Brønnøy]] and the best locations along the [[Helgeland]] coast is SB north to the mouth of [[Ranfjord]], while inland areas north of [[Grong]] are dominated by Middle Boreal zone in the lowland. There are small isolated areas with SB vegetation further north, as in [[Bodø]] and [[Fauske]]; the most northern location is a narrow strip along the northern shore of [[Ofotfjord]]. The endemic Nordland-[[whitebeam]] only grows in [[Bindal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.miljostatus.no/nordland/tema/naturomrader/naturvern/verneomradene_i_nordland/verneomrader/reppen_naturreservat.htm |title=Reppen nature reserve |author= |date= |website=miljostatus.no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agriculture in Norway, including [[grain]] cultivation, takes place mostly in the hemiboreal and SB zone.

===Middle Boreal===
[[File:Elsfjord F.JPG|thumb|In most of Norway, the middle boreal zone is dominated by spruce forest, but with some agriculture as well. September in [[Elsfjord]], [[Vefsn]].]]

The typical closed-canopy forest of the Middle Boreal (MB) zone is dominated by boreal plant species. The MB vegetation covers a total of 20% of the land area. Norway spruce is the dominant tree in large areas in the interior of Østlandet, Sørlandet, Trøndelag and Helgeland; the MB and SB spruce dominated forest is the commercially most important forest in Norway. Spruce does not grow naturally north of Saltfjell in mid-[[Nordland]] (the siberian spruce variant occurs in the Pasvik valley) due to mountain ranges blocking the advance, but is often planted in MB areas further north for economic reasons, contributing to a different landscape. Birch is usually dominant in these northern areas, but pine, aspen, rowan, [[Prunus padus|bird cherry]] and grey alder are also common. This MB birch is often a cross between [[silver birch]] and [[downy birch]] and is larger (6 – 12 m) than the birch growing near the tree line; conifers will grow taller. Some alpine plants grow in the MB zone, nemoral species are rare. The [[understory]] is usually well developed if the forest is not too dense, and many plants do not grow further north. Grey alder, silver birch, [[Galium verum|yellow bedstraw]], [[Rubus idaeus|raspberry]], [[Artemisia vulgaris|mugwort]] and ''[[Myrica gale]]'' are examples of species in this zone which do not grow further north or higher up. MB is located at an altitude of 400 – 750 m in Østlandet, up to 800 m in the southern valleys, from 300 m to 600 m (800 m at the head of the long fjords) on the southwest coast, and from 180 – 450 m in Trøndelag (700 m in the interior, as in Røros and [[Oppdal]]). Further north, MB is common in the lowland, up to 100 m above sea level in Lofoten and Vesterålen, 200 m above sea level in [[Narvik]], 100 m in Tromsø, 130 m - 200 m in inland valleys in Troms, and the lowland at the head of [[Altafjord]] is the most northerly area of any size; small pockets exist in [[Porsanger]] and [[Sør-Varanger]]. This is usually the most northerly area with some farming activity, and [[Barley]] was traditionally grown even as far north as [[Alta, Norway|Alta]].

===North Boreal===
[[File:Sand with pines.jpg|thumb|left|Road in the pine forest in [[Karasjok]]. The climate here exhibits the largest continentality and has the coldest winters in Norway; north boreal zone.]]
[[File:Övre dividal anjajohka.jpg|thumb|North boreal forest in [[Øvre Dividal National Park]]; the autumn colored leaves of the mountain birch continues upslope as the pine reaches its limit.]]
The North Boreal (NB) zone, (also known as open or sparse taiga) is the zone closest to the [[tree line]], bordering the alpine or polar area and dominated by a harsh subarctic climate. There are at least 30 days with a mean of 10&amp;nbsp;°C or more (summer) and up to about 2 months. The trees grow very slow and generally do not get very large; the forest is not as dense as further south or at lower altitude, and is known as the mountain forest (''No:Fjellskog''). The NB zone covers a total of 28% of the land area in Norway, including almost half of Finnmark, where the mountain birch is growing down to sea level. The lower part of this zone also has conifers, but the tree line in Norway is mostly formed by mountain birch, a subspecies of downy birch (''ssp. czerepanovii'' [http://www.skogoglandskap.no/publikasjon/SF_3230_2800 ]; not to be confused with [[dwarf birch]]). Spruce and pine make up the tree line in some mountain areas with a more continental climate. Alpine plants are common in this zone. Birch forest at 1,320 m above sea level at Sikilsdalshorn is the highest tree line in Norway. The tree line is lower closer to the coast and in areas with lower mountains due to cooler summers, more wind near mountain summits, and more snow in the winter (coastal mountains) leading to later snowmelt. The NB zone is located at 750 – 950 m altitude in the interior of Østlandet and covers large areas; at 800 – 1200 m in the central mountain areas; but at the western coast the tree line is down to about 500 m above sea level, increasing significantly into the long fjords (1,100 m at the head of [[Sognefjord]]). Further north, large areas in the interior highlands or uplands of Trøndelag and North Norway is dominated by the NB zone, with the tree line at about 800 m amsl in the interior of Trøndelag, 600 m in [[Rana, Norway|Rana]], 500 m in Narvik, 400 m in Tromsø, 100 m in [[Hammerfest]] (only pockets in sheltered areas) and 200 m in Kirkenes. The large [[Finnmarksvidda]] plateau is at an altitude placing it almost exactly at the tree line. The last patch of NB zone gives way to tundra at sea level about 10&amp;nbsp;km south of the [[North Cape, Norway|North Cape]] plateau (near [[Skarsvåg]]); areas south of this line is tundra-like with scattered patches of mountain birch woodland (forest tundra) and becomes alpine tundra even at minor elevations. The trees near the tree line is often bent by snow, wind and growing season frost; height is only 2 – 4 m. Outside Norway (and adjacent areas in Sweden), the only other areas in the world with the tree line mostly made up by a small-leaved deciduous tree like birch - in contrast to conifers - are [[Iceland]] and the [[Kamtschatka peninsula]].

A [[conifer]] tree line is sometimes used (''No: Barskoggrense'') to divide this zone into two subzones, as the conifers will (usually) not grow as high up as the mountain birch. Spruce and pine grow at nearly 1,100 m above sea level in some areas of Jotunheimen, down to {{Convert|400|m|feet}} in Bergen (900 m at the head of Sognefjord), 900 m in Lillehammer (mountains near Oslo too low to observe a tree line), 500 m in Trondheim (750 m in Oppdal), 350 m in Narvik, 200 m in Harstad, {{Convert|250|m|feet}} in Alta and the most northerly pine forest in the world is in [[Stabbursdalen National Park]] in [[Porsanger]]. There are some forestry in this part of the NB zone; some conifers can grow quite large even if growth is slow.

===Boreal ecoregions===
The boreal zones in Norway belongs to three ecoregions: The area dominated by spruce forests (some birch, pine, willow, aspen) mostly belong to the [[Scandinavian and Russian taiga]] PA0608 ecoregion. The [[Scandinavian coastal conifer forests]] PA0520 ecoregion in coastal areas with mild winters and frequent rainfall follows the coast from south of Stavanger and north to southern Troms and includes both hemiboreal and boreal areas. Bordering the latter region is the [[Scandinavian Montane Birch forest and grasslands]] PA1110 ecoregion. This region seems to include both mountain areas with alpine tundra and lowland forests, essentially all areas outside the natural range of Norway spruce forests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/maps/search/http:%2F%2Fglobalspecies.org%2Fkmlserver%2Fgetkml%2Fpa1110/data=!4m2!2m1!4b1?source=s_q&amp;hl=en |title=Google Maps |author= |date= |website=Google Maps}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ecoregion thus show a very large span in climate and environmental conditions, from the temperate forest along the fjords of Western Norway to the summit of [[Galdhøpiggen]] and northeast to the [[Varanger Peninsula]]. The area above the conifer treeline is made up by mountain birch ''Betula pubescens ssp. czerepanovii'' (''No: fjellbjørkeskog''). The Scots pine reaches its altitudinal limit about 200 m lower than the mountain birch.

===Tundra===
[[File:Muskus.jpg|thumb|[[Muskox]] in the low alpine tundra at [[Dovrefjell]]]]

Alpine tundra is common in Norway, covering a total of 32% of the land area (excluding Svalbard and Jan Mayen) and belonging to the Scandinavian Montane Birch forest and grasslands PA1110 ecoregion. The area closest to the tree line (low alpine) has continuous plant cover, with [[Salix|willow]] species such as ''[[Salix glauca]]'', ''[[Salix lanata|S. lanata]]'' and ''[[Salix lapponum|S. lapponum]]'' 0.5 meter tall; [[blueberry]], [[Juniperus communis|common juniper]] and [[Linnaea borealis|twinflower]] are common. The low alpine area was traditionally used as summer pastures, and partly still is. This zone reaches an elevation of 1,500 m in Jotunheimen and includes most of [[Hardangervidda]], it reaches 1,300 m in eastern [[Trollheimen]] and about 800 m in Narvik and the [[Lyngen Alps]]. Higher up (mid-alpine tundra) the plants become smaller, mosses and lichens are more predominant; plants still cover most of the ground even if snowfields last into mid-summer and permafrost are common. At the highest elevations (high-alpine tundra) the ground is dominated by bare rock, snow and glaciers, with few plants.

[[File:Nordaustlandet (js) 2.jpg|thumb|left|The Arctic desert on [[Nordaustlandet]]]]
[[File:Hurrungane, 1990.jpg|thumb|High alpine tundra in [[Hurrungane]]]]

The highest altitude weather station in Norway, Fanaråken in [[Luster, Norway|Luster]] at 2,062 m, barely have three months above freezing and a July average of 2.7&amp;nbsp;°C. Still, glacier buttercup has been found only 100 m below the summit of [[Galdhøpiggen]], and [[moss]]es and [[lichen]]s have been found at the summit.

In northeastern Finnmark (northern half of the [[Varanger Peninsula]] and [[Nordkinn Peninsula]]) is a small lowland tundra area which is often considered part of the [[Kola Peninsula tundra]] PA1106  ecoregion. Svalbard and Jan Mayen have tundra vegetation except for areas covered by glaciers, and some areas, like the cliffs at southern [[Bear Island (Norway)|Bear Island]], are fertilized by [[seabird]] colonies. This tundra is often considered part of the [[Arctic Desert]] PA1101 ecoregion. The most lush areas on these Arctic islands are sheltered fjord areas at [[Spitsbergen]]; they have the highest summer temperatures and the very dry climate ensures little snow and thus comparatively early [[snowmelt]]. The short growing season and the [[permafrost]] underneath the active layer still ensures enough moisture; plants include [[dwarf birch]], [[Rubus chamaemorus|cloudberry]], [[Svalbard poppy]] and [[Campanula rotundifolia|harebell]].

A warmer climate would push the vegetation zones significantly northwards and to higher elevations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://acia.cicero.uio.no/factsheets/3_vegetation_zones.pdf |title=Fact sheet |author= |date= |website=uio.no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural resources==

In addition to oil and natural gas, hydroelectric power, and fish and forest resources, Norway has reserves of ferric and nonferric metal ores. Many of these have been exploited in the past but are now idle because of low metal content and high operating costs. Europe's largest ilmenite (titanium) deposits are near the southwest coast. Coal is mined in the Svalbard islands.

Resources: [[Petroleum]], [[copper]], [[natural gas]], [[pyrite]]s, [[nickel]], [[iron ore]], [[zinc]], [[lead]], [[fish]], [[lumber]], [[hydropower]].

===Current issues===
[[File:Canyon in Rohkunborri National Park.jpg|thumb|right|Norway has established several new national parks the last years. Sørdalen valley (canyon) in [[Rohkunborri National Park]].]]
Environmental concerns in Norway include how to cut [[greenhouse gas]] emissions, [[pollution]] of the air and water, loss of habitat, damage to cold water coral reefs from [[Fishing trawler|trawlers]], and salmon fish farming threatening the wild salmon by spawning in the rivers, thereby diluting the local DNA. Acid rain has damaged lakes, rivers and forest, especially in the southernmost part of the country, and most wild salmon populations in [[Sørlandet]] have died. Due to lower emissions in Europe, acid rain in Norway has decreased by 40% from 1980 to 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miljostatus.no/templates/themepage____2149.aspx ]&lt;/ref&gt; Another concern is a possible increase in extreme weather. In the future, climate models &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miljostatus.no/templates/PageWithRightListing____2326.aspx ]&lt;/ref&gt; predict increased precipitation, especially in the areas with current high precipitation, and also predict more episodes with heavy precipitation within a short time span, which can cause landslides and local floods. Winters will probably be significant milder, and the sea ice cover in the [[Arctic ocean]] might melt altogether in summer, threatening the survival of the polar bear on Svalbard. Both terrestrial and aquatic species are expected to shift northwards, and this is already observed for some species: migratory birds arriving earlier, trees coming into leaf earlier, [[mackerel]] becoming common in summer off the coast of [[Troms]], the growing [[red deer]] population is spreading northwards and eastwards and 2008 was the first hunting season which saw more red deer (35,700) than moose shot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nrk.no/programmer/radio/norgesglasset/1.6532923 |title=Hjortebestand i vill vekst |first=Agnete Daae-Qvale |last=Holmemo |date= |website=nrk.no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total number of species in Norway are expected to rise due to new species arriving.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.environment.no/templates/PageWithRightListing.aspx?id=2320 ]&lt;/ref&gt; Norwegians are statistically among the world's most worried when it comes to global warming and its effects,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/miljo/article1822401.ece Flere bekymret over oppvarming], Aftenposten, 6 June 2007, retrieved 11 June 2007. {{no icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; even if Norway is among the countries expected to be least negatively affected by global warming, with some possible gains.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17952360/site/newsweek/ ]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14408">[[Rugby league]] is a full contact football code and spectator sport played in various countries around the world and governed by the [[Rugby League International Federation]]. As of 2010 there are currently 27 nations fielding domestic leagues that meet the World Cup eligibility requirements. Further to this there are over 30 others that are playing at an emerging level status at varying degrees of international competition and are in the process of developing the game in their nations. The global player pool is estimated to be in the millions.

Although one of the last football codes to be developed, since the modern 1990's professional era the game has expanded outside of its traditionals heartlands in [[Australia]], [[England]], [[France]] and [[New Zealand]]. As a result, many players of European, American and Pacific Islander background have risen to the top professional level in the two major domestic leagues, the [[National Rugby League]] and [[Super League]].

Whilst individual international test matches between nations have been staged regularly since the sport's inception in 1908, the first multi-national tournament was held in France in [[1954 Rugby League World Cup|1954]], making it the first World Cup of either [[rugby football|rugby code]] and the first to be officially known as the "Rugby World Cup".&lt;ref name="Folkard03-337"&gt;[[#Folkard2003|Folkard, 2003]]: 337&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SPARC-2009-p28"&gt;[[#SPARC-2009|SPARC, 2009]]: 28&lt;/ref&gt;

==Africa==
{{main|Rugby league in Africa}}
Rugby league is a growing sport in Africa, with the game first introduced to the continent in the early 2017. The vast distance of teams from the game's heartlands has at times affected the development of the sport but new advances in the 21st century have seen a major increase in the number of internationals scheduled. Many high calibre players from the continent have progressed to the top club leagues, including [[Younes Khattabi]], [[Jamal Fakir]], [[Tom van Vollenhoven]], [[Fred Griffiths (rugby league)|Fred Griffiths]] and [[Jarrod Saffy]]. The large ex-patriate Moroccan population in the south of France has resulted in a growing interchange of players between the two countries. Rugby league in Africa is played in [[South Africa]], [[Gambia]],&lt;ref&gt;https://warringtonwolves.com/rfl-news/the-full-blood-project/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Morocco]], [[Burundi]], [[Nigeria]] and [[Ghana]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rlef.eu.com/south_africa/introduction&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rlef.eu.com/morocco_xiii/introduction&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rlef.eu.com/news/article/564/ghana-rugby-league-takes-to&lt;/ref&gt;

==Americas==
{{main|Rugby league in the Americas}}
[[Rugby league]] is a growing sport in the Americas, having first started with All Star exhibition matches in the 1950s. It has been played at an organised semi-professional level in North America since it was first introduced as a competition sport in the 1990s. There are currently domestic leagues operating in [[Jamaica]], [[Canada]] and the [[United States]]. Many players of Caribbean heritage live and play in the European [[Super League]] and have brought their skills back to the islands to foster the development of thousands of new players. The game is also played at a lower amateur level across the Americas by ex-patriates although only recognised national organisations are listed here for brevity.

Canada currently has two domesitic competitions, Ontario and British Columbia, with British Columbia being the premier competition with also the most teams.  British Columbia Rugby League (BCRL) also has a provincial team known as the BC Bulldogs.  In 2012, the BC Bulldogs competed against Utah Avalanche from Salt Lake who currently play in the AMNRL.  The game was contested over two legs, home and away, with BC taking both games.  The BC Bulldogs also made an appearance at the Las Vegas Remembrance Cup and come third. Coogee Bay Dolphins from [[Australia]] took out the competition for the second time in a row.

In 2013, BCRL will be made up of 6 teams, namely Bayside Sharks, Kelowna Crows, Richmond Bears, Sea to Sky Eagles, Surrey Beavers and Vancouver Dragons.

Brazil has also taken up the sport in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.portaldorugby.com.br/noticia/25-brasil/7138-rugby-league-reina-em-baixo-guandu |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130627210112/http://www.portaldorugby.com.br/noticia/25-brasil/7138-rugby-league-reina-em-baixo-guandu |archivedate=2013-06-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2013 the [[Latin Heat Rugby League]] has had moderate success in introducing rugby League to players with Latin American heritage living in Australia. In 2014 the Latin Heat opened a U.S chapter.

==Asia and the Middle East==
Rugby league is a growing sport in Asia and the Middle East, with a large growth in players since the 1990s, some of which have played at the game's elite levels in the [[National Rugby League]] and [[Super League]]. The game in the Middle East is one of the fastest growing sports with regular internationals played against European and Mediterranean teams. Although [[Russia national rugby league team|Russia]] has a growing rugby league presence and extends into Asia, the main competition is in Europe.

The '''Gregale'''  ({{lang-ca|Gregal}}, {{lang-it|Grecale}}, {{Lang-lmo|Grecal}}, {{lang-mt|Grigal}}, {{Lang-oc|Gregau}}, {{lang-el|Γραίγος}}, ''Graigos'') is a [[Mediterranean]] [[wind]] that can occur during times when a [[low-pressure area]] moves through the area to the south of [[Malta]] and causes a strong, cool, northeasterly wind to affect the island. It also affects other islands of the Western [[Mediterranean]].

The name derives from the Italian ''grecale'', which refers to the island of [[Zakynthos]], in [[Greece]].{{Fact|date=September 2008}}

This is likely to be the [[Euroclydon]] wind, from Greek ''Euros'' (east) and ''kludon'' (billow, surge) or Latin ''Aquilo'' (north) "northeaster" or the island [[Gavdos|Clauda]] (Acts 27:16), which wrecked&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parsagard.com/shipwreck.htm The Apostle Paul's Shipwreck: An Historical Examination of Acts 27 and 28] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150217101909/http://www.parsagard.com/shipwreck.htm |date=2015-02-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Paul of Tarsus|apostle Paul's]] ship on the coast of [[Malta]] on his way to Rome &lt;ref&gt;"But not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind, called Euroclydon."{{bibleverse||Acts|27:14|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9499">'''Hart InterCivic''' Inc. is a privately held United States company that provides elections{{what|date=October 2018}}, and print [[solution]]s to jurisdictions nationwide. While headquartered in [[Austin, Texas]], Hart products are used by hundreds of jurisdictions nationwide, including counties in Texas, the entire states of Hawaii and Oklahoma, half of [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and Colorado, and certain counties in Ohio, California, Idaho,&lt;ref name="Yahoo Finance Idaho"&gt;[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bonneville-county-idaho-selects-hart-171200859.html Bonneville County, Idaho Selects Hart InterCivic as Elections Vendor].&lt;/ref&gt; Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;Gerry Bello &amp; Bob Fitrakis for Free Press. September 27, 2012  [http://www.freepress.org/departments/display/19/2012/4725 Vote counting company ties to Romney]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hart entered the elections industry in 1912, printing ballots for Texas counties. The company, formerly a division of Hart Graphics, Inc., was established as a subsidiary called Hart Forms &amp; Services in 1989. In 1995, to better communicate its full scope of document management services, Hart Forms &amp; Services changed its name to Hart Information Services, Inc. During the next five years, Hart Information Services rapidly expanded its market presence through the acquisition of three major election services providers: Texas County Printing &amp; Services, Computer Link Corporation, and Worldwide Election Systems. Worldwide was the developer of the eSlate, Hart's direct recording electronic (DRE) voting machine. The eSlate was specifically designed to accommodate the needs of voter with disabilities. It is not a touch-screen device, but uses a Select Wheel and digital push-button interface.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

The need for document management and election services continued to grow, and in 1999, the company spun off completely from Hart Graphics. In 2000, the company became Hart InterCivic Inc., reflecting its corporate mission to service the interactive relationship of Hart InterCivic, state and local governments, and the citizens they serve.

In the mid-2000s Hart entered&lt;ref&gt;Hart InterCivic Press Release, June 12, 2007. [http://www.prweb.com/releases/2007/06/prweb532780.htm Hart InterCivic Acquires Farragut Systems]&lt;/ref&gt; and then exited&lt;ref&gt;GIS Cafe, June 01, 2009. [http://www10.giscafe.com/nbc/articles/1/702067/Return-Farragut-Systems Farragut Systems, a firm specializing on using GIS technology and consulting services to improve the integration of local government systems, is proud to announce its rebirth as an independent firm.]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Geographic Information System]]s business by acquiring and then spinning back out Farragut Systems.

==Board of Directors and Ownership==
In July 2011, Hart received what Hart described as "a strategic investment" from H.I.G. Capital,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hartintercivic.com/pr/108 |title=Hart InterCivic Announces Strategic Investment by H.I.G. Capital|date=July 6, 2011|publisher=Hart InterCivic}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a transaction that Hart's advisors called an "acquisition."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cabrilloadvisors.com/398/ Cabrillo Advisors news release]&lt;/ref&gt;

As of October 2012, the Board has five members:  Gregg Burt, Chairman; Phillip Braithwaite, Chief Executive Officer; Neil Tuch,  Managing Director, H.I.G. Capital; Jeff Bohl, Principal, H.I.G. Capital; and Amanda Kalin, Associate, H.I.G. Capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hartintercivic.com/pages/447|title=Hart Intercivic Board of Directors|accessdate=October 25, 2012|publisher=Hart InterCivic|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121029185006/http://www.hartintercivic.com/pages/447|archivedate=October 29, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; HIG controls 3 out of 5 board seats.

Two of the H.I.G. Directors that work for H.I.G., Neil Tuch and Jeff Bohl, have previously made contributions to presidential campaigns – Neil Tuch contributed to both the Obama and Romney campaigns prior to H.I.G.’s investment in Hart InterCivic, and Jeff Bohl contributed to the Romney campaign in 2011.&lt;ref name="Cleveland"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2012/10/ohio_voting_machines_are_not_c.html|title=Ohio elections boards deny that Mitt Romney backers or anyone else could tamper with results|date=October 24, 2012|publisher=Cleveland.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of October 2012, H.I.G. is the 11th largest of all the contributors to the Romney effort.&lt;ref name="Forbes"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/rickungar/2012/10/20/romney-family-investment-ties-to-voting-machine-company-that-could-decide-the-election-causes-concern/|title= Romney Family Investment Ties To Voting Machine Company That Could Decide The Election Causing Concern| author=Rick Ungar |date=October 20, 2012|publisher=[[Forbes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

H.I.G. counts Solamere Capital as a minor investor in one of its funds.&lt;ref name="Cleveland" /&gt; Solamere Capital is an investment firm founded by [[Mitt Romney]]'s, son, [[Tagg Romney]], and Spencer Zwick, [[Mitt Romney presidential campaign, 2012|Mitt Romney's campaign]] finance chair&lt;ref&gt;Donovan Slack for the Boston Globe.

==State reviews of election equipment==
===CA TTBR===
On August 3, 2007, California Secretary of State [[Debra Bowen]] withdrew approval and then granted conditional reapproval of Hart InterCivic [[optical scan voting system|optical scan]] and [[DRE voting machine]]s after a "top-to-bottom review" of California voting machines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

===OH EVEREST===
A report commissioned by Ohio’s top elections official on December 15, 2007 has found that all five voting systems used in Ohio (including one made by Hart InterCivic) have critical flaws that could undermine the integrity of the 2008 general election.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/15/us/15ohio.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin Ohio Elections Official Calls Machines Flawed]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues==
During voting for the [[Texas elections, 2018|2018 Texas general election]], an Election Advisory was issued by the Director of Elections, Keith Ingram.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sos.state.tx.us/elections/laws/advisory2018-35.shtml Voting on Hart eSlate Machines - Election Advisory No. 2018-35 - Texas Secretary of State]&lt;/ref&gt;  Voters using the InterCivic eSlate voting machine could have their votes adjusted or flipped while on a summary page if the buttons were interacted with if the page was not fully rendered.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/texans-say-voting-machines-are-flipping-selections-to-the-other-party Some Texans say voting machines are flipping selections to the other party - PBS NewsHour]&lt;/ref&gt;  The machines were in use in 82 counties in Texas during the 2018 election and have been certified for use in the state since 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.texastribune.org/2018/10/26/texas-voting-machines-2018-straight-ticket-midterm-elections/ Here’s how to avoid problems with straight-ticket voting in Texas - The Texas Tribune]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pahomepage.com/news/politics/texans-say-voting-machines-changing-straightticket-choices/1552302045 Texans say voting machines changing straight-ticket choices - WBRE]&lt;/ref&gt;

Secretary [[Rolando Pablos]] later issued an additional Advisory, noting that "[I]t is important for all voters in the 82 Texas counties utilizing the Hart Intercivic eSlate to understand that the voting machines are not malfunctioning, nor are they arbitrarily 'switching' the choices of voters who cast a straight-party ballot," citing a "disturbing trend" in the distribution of misinformation about the integrity of the machines and the election.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sos.state.tx.us/about/newsreleases/2018/102718.shtml]&lt;/ref&gt;

Its border includes most of the length of China's [[China–Mongolia border|border]] with [[Mongolia]],{{Efn|The rest of the Sino–Mongolian border coincides with part of the international border of the [[Xinjiang]] autonomous region and the entirety of the international border of [[Gansu]] province.}} and a small section of China's [[China–Russia border|border]] with [[Russia]].{{Efn|The rest of the Sino–Russian border coincides with the small part of the international borders of [[Jilin]] province and [[Xinjiang]] and the entirety of the international border of [[Heilongjiang]] province.}} Its capital is [[Hohhot]]; other major cities include [[Baotou]], [[Chifeng]], and [[Ordos City|Ordos]].

The Autonomous Region was established in 1947, incorporating the areas of the former [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] provinces of [[Suiyuan]], [[Chahar Province|Chahar]], [[Rehe Province|Rehe]], [[Liaobei Province|Liaobei]] and [[Xing'an Province|Xing'an]], along with the northern parts of [[Gansu]] and [[Ningxia]].

The official languages are [[Chinese language|Mandarin]] and [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]], the latter of which is written in the [[Mongolian script|traditional Mongolian script]], as opposed to the [[Mongolian Cyrillic alphabet]], which is used in the state of [[Mongolia]] (formerly often described in [[Western world|the West]] as "[[Outer Mongolia]]").

== Name ==
In Chinese, the region is known as "Inner Mongolia", where the terms of "Inner/Outer" are derived from [[Manchu language|Manchu]] ''dorgi''/''tulergi'' (cf. [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]] ''dotugadu''/''gadagadu''). Inner Mongolia is distinct from [[Outer Mongolia]], which was a term used by the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] and previous governments to refer to what is now the independent [[sovereign state|state]] of [[Mongolia]] plus the Republic of [[Tuva]] in [[Russia]]. The term Inner {{lang|zh-hans|内}} (Nei) referred to the Nei Fan {{lang|zh-hans|内藩}} (Inner Tributary), i.e. those descendants of Genghis Khan who granted the title khan (king) in Ming and Qing dynasties and lived in part of southern part of Mongolia. In [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]], the region was called ''Dotugadu monggol'' during [[Mongolia during Qing rule|Qing rule]] and was renamed into ''Öbür Monggol'' in 1947, ''öbür'' meaning the southern side of a mountain, while the Chinese term ''Nei Menggu'' was retained. In recent years, some Mongols (mainly those who support independence from China) began to call Inner Mongolia ''Nan'' ({{zh|c=南|p=Nán}}) ''Menggu'', literally "South Mongolia", and with it came the change of English translation from Inner Mongolia to Southern Mongolia.&lt;ref&gt;Huhbator Borjigin. 2004.

== History ==
{{See also|History of Mongolia}}

Much of what is known about the history of [[Mongolian Plateau|Greater Mongolia]], including Inner Mongolia, is known through Chinese chronicles and historians. Before the rise of the Mongols in the 13th century, what is now central and western Inner Mongolia, especially the [[Hetao]] region, alternated in control between [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] agriculturalists in the south and [[Xiongnu]], [[Xianbei]], [[Khitan people|Khitan]], [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]], [[Tujue]], and nomadic [[Mongols in China|Mongol]] of the north. The historical narrative of what is now Eastern Inner Mongolia mostly consists of alternations between different [[Tungusic peoples|Tungusic]] and [[Mongols in China|Mongol]] tribes, rather than the struggle between nomads and Chinese agriculturalists.

=== Early history ===
[[Slab Grave Culture|Slab Grave cultural]] monuments are found in northern, central and eastern [[Mongolia]], Inner Mongolia, north-western China, southern, central-eastern and southern [[Baikal Lake|Baikal]] territory. Mongolian scholars prove that this culture related to the [[Proto-Mongols]].&lt;ref&gt;History of Mongolia, Volume I, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Zhou dynasty]], central and western Inner Mongolia (the Hetao region and surrounding areas) were inhabited by nomadic peoples such as the [[Loufan (people)|Loufan]], Linhu, and [[Beidi|Dí]], while eastern Inner Mongolia was inhabited by the [[Donghu people|Donghu]]. During the [[Warring States period]], [[King Wuling of Zhao|King Wuling]] (340–295 BC) of the [[state of Zhao]] based in what is now [[Hebei]] and [[Shanxi]] provinces pursued an expansionist policy towards the region. After destroying the [[Beidi|Dí]] [[state of Zhongshan]] in what is now Hebei province, he defeated the Linhu and [[Loufan (people)|Loufan]] and created the [[Datong|commandery of Yunzhong]] near modern [[Hohhot]]. King Wuling of Zhao also built a long wall stretching through the Hetao region. After [[Qin Shihuang]] created the first unified Chinese empire in 221 BC, he sent the general [[Meng Tian]] to [[Qin's campaign against the Xiongnu|drive the Xiongnu from the region]], and incorporated the old Zhao wall into the Qin dynasty Great Wall of China. He also maintained two commanderies in the region: [[Commandery of Jiuyuan|Jiuyuan]] and Yunzhong, and moved 30,000 households there to solidify the region. After the Qin dynasty collapsed in 206 BC, these efforts were abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;Records of the Grand Historian by Sima Qian.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Western Han dynasty]], [[Emperor Wu of Han|Emperor Wu]] sent the general [[Wei Qing]] to [[Han–Xiongnu War|reconquer the Hetao region from the Xiongnu]] in 127 BC. After the conquest, Emperor Wu continued the policy of building settlements in Hetao to defend against the Xiong-Nu. In that same year he established the commanderies of [[commandery of Shuofang|Shuofang]] and [[commandery of Wuyuan|Wuyuan]] in Hetao. At the same time, what is now eastern Inner Mongolia was controlled by the [[Xianbei]], who would later on eclipse the Xiongnu in power and influence.

During the [[Eastern Han dynasty]] (25–220 AD), Xiongnu who surrendered to the Han dynasty began to be settled in Hetao, and intermingled with the Han immigrants in the area. Later on during the [[Western Jin dynasty]], it was a Xiongnu noble from Hetao, [[Liu Yuan (Han Zhao)|Liu Yuan]], who established the [[Han Zhao]] kingdom in the region, thereby beginning the [[Sixteen Kingdoms]] period that saw the disintegration of northern China under a variety of Han and non-Han (including Xiongnu and Xianbei) regimes.

The [[Sui dynasty]] (581–618) and [[Tang dynasty]] (618–907) re-established a unified Chinese empire, and like their predecessors, they conquered and settled people into Hetao, though once again these efforts were aborted when the Tang empire began to collapse. Hetao (along with the rest of what now consists Inner Mongolia) was then taken over by the [[Khitan Empire]] (Liao dynasty), founded by the [[Khitans]], a nomadic people originally from what is now the southern part of Manchuria and eastern Inner Mongolia. They were followed by the [[Western Xia]] of the [[Tangut people|Tangut]]s, who took control of what is now the western part of Inner Mongolia (including western Hetao) . The Khitans were later replaced by the [[Jurchens]], precursors to the modern [[Manchus]], who established the [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin dynasty]] over Manchuria and northern China.

=== Mongol and Ming periods ===
{{Main|Mongol Empire|Mongolia under Yuan rule|Northern Yuan dynasty|Ming dynasty}}
[[File:Siège de Beijing (1213-1214).jpeg|thumb|left|[[Persian miniature]] depicting [[Genghis Khan]] entering [[Beijing]]]]
[[File:Northern Yuan.png|thumb|The Northern Yuan at its greatest extent]]

After [[Genghis Khan]] unified the [[Mongol]] tribes in 1206 and founded the [[Mongol Empire]], the [[Tanguts|Tangut]] [[Western Xia]] empire was ultimately conquered in 1227, and the [[Jurchens|Jurchen]] [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin dynasty]] fell in 1234. In 1271, [[Kublai Khan]], the grandson of Genghis Khan established the [[Yuan dynasty]]. Kublai Khan's summer capital [[Shangdu]] (aka Xanadu) was located near present-day [[Duolun County|Dolonnor]]. During that time [[Ongud]] and [[Khunggirad]] peoples dominated the area of what is now Inner Mongolia. After the Yuan dynasty was overthrown by the Han-led [[Ming dynasty]] in 1368, the Ming captured parts of Inner Mongolia including Shangdu and [[Yingchang]]. The Ming rebuilt the [[Great Wall of China]] at its present location, which roughly follows the southern border of the modern Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region (though it deviates significantly at the Hebei-Inner Mongolia border). The Ming established the Three Guards composed of the Mongols there. Soon after the [[Tumu incident]] in 1449, when the Oirat ruler [[Esen taishi]] captured the Chinese emperor, Mongols flooded south from Outer Mongolia to Inner Mongolia. Thus from then on until 1635, Inner Mongolia was the political and cultural center of the Mongols during the [[Northern Yuan dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;CPAtwood-Encyclopedia of Mongolia and the Mongol Empire, p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Qing period ===
{{Main|Mongolia under Qing rule}}

The eastern Mongol tribes near and in Manchuria, particularly the [[Khorchin]] and Southern [[Khalkha]] in today's Inner Mongolia intermarried, formed alliances with, and fought against the [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]] tribes until [[Nurhaci]], the founder of the new Jin dynasty, consolidated his control over all groups in the area in 1593.&lt;ref&gt;Atwood, Christopher. Encyclopedia of Mongolia and the Mongol Empire, p. 449.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Manchus]] gained far-reaching control of the Inner Mongolian tribes in 1635, when [[Ligden Khan]]'s son surrendered the [[Chahar Mongols|Chakhar]] Mongol tribes to the [[Manchus]]. The Manchus subsequently invaded Ming China in 1644, bringing it under the control of their newly established [[Qing dynasty]]. Under the Qing dynasty (1636–1912), [[Mongolian plateau|Greater Mongolia]] was [[Mongolia under Qing rule|administered]] in a different way for each region:

[[File:Qing dynasty and Mongolia.jpg|thumb|Inner Mongolia and Outer Mongolia within the Qing dynasty]]
* "Outer Mongolia": This region corresponds to the modern state of [[Mongolia]], plus the Russian-administered region of [[Tannu Uriankhai]], and a part of northern [[Xinjiang]]. It included the four leagues (''aimag'') of the [[Khalkha Mongols]] north of the [[Gobi desert|Gobi]], as well as the [[Tannu Uriankhai]] and [[Khovd Province|Khovd]] regions in northwestern Mongolia, which were overseen by the [[General of Uliastai]] from the city of [[Uliastai]].
* "Inner Mongolia": This region corresponded to most of modern Inner Mongolia and some neighboring areas in [[Liaoning]] and [[Jilin]] provinces. The [[Banners of Inner Mongolia|banners]] and tribes in this region came under six [[Leagues of China|leagues]] (''chuulghan''): [[Tongliao|Jirim]], [[Juuuda]], [[Josutu]], [[Xilingol]], [[Ulanqab]], and [[Yekejuu]].
* "Taoxi Mongolia": The [[Alashan Öölüd]] and [[Ejine Torghuud]] banners were separate from the aimags of Outer Mongolia and the chuulghans of Inner Mongolia. This territory is equivalent to modern-day [[Alxa League]], the westernmost part of what is now Inner Mongolia.
* The Chahar [[Banners of Inner Mongolia|Banners]] were controlled by the military commander of Chahar (now [[Zhangjiakou]]). Their extent corresponded to southern Ulanqab and [[Bayannur]] in modern Inner Mongolia, plus the region around [[Zhangjiakou]] in [[Hebei]] province. At the same time, the jurisdiction of some border departments of [[Zhili Province|Zhili]] and [[Shanxi]] provinces also belonged to this region.
* The [[Guihua Tümed]] banner was controlled by the military commander of Suiyuan (now [[Hohhot]]). This corresponds to the vicinities of the modern city of [[Hohhot]]. At the same time, the jurisdiction of some border departments of modern [[Shanxi]] province also belonged to this region.
* The [[Hulunbuir]] region in what is now northeastern Inner Mongolia was part of the jurisdiction of the General of [[Heilongjiang]], one of the three generals of [[Manchuria]].

The Inner Mongolian [[Chahar Mongols|Chahar]] leader [[Ligdan Khan]], a descendant of Genghis Khan, opposed and fought against the Qing until he died of smallpox in 1634. Thereafter, the Inner Mongols under his son [[Ejei Khan]] surrendered to the Qing and was given the title of Prince ({{zh|labels=no |t=親王 |p=qīn wáng}}), and Inner Mongolian nobility became closely tied to the Qing royal family and intermarried with them extensively. Ejei Khan died in 1661 and was succeeded by his brother Abunai. After Abunai showed disaffection with Manchu Qing rule, he was placed under house arrest in 1669 in [[Shenyang]] and the Kangxi Emperor gave his title to his son Borni. Abunai then bid his time and then he and his brother Lubuzung revolted against the Qing in 1675 during the [[Revolt of the Three Feudatories]], with 3,000 Chahar Mongol followers joining in on the revolt. The revolt was put down within two months, the Qing then crushed the rebels in a battle on April 20, 1675, killing Abunai and all his followers. Their title was abolished, all Chahar Mongol royal males were executed even if they were born to Manchu Qing princesses, and all Chahar Mongol royal females were sold into slavery except the Manchu Qing princesses. The Chahar Mongols were then put under the direct control of the Qing Emperor unlike the other Inner Mongol leagues which maintained their autonomy.

Despite officially prohibiting Han Chinese settlement on the Manchu and Mongol lands, by the 18th century the Qing decided to settle Han refugees from northern China who were suffering from famine, floods, and drought into Manchuria and Inner Mongolia so that Han Chinese farmed 500,000 hectares in Manchuria and tens of thousands of hectares in Inner Mongolia by the 1780s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor = 3985584|title = Land Use and Society in Manchuria and Inner Mongolia during the Qing Dynasty |last = Reardon-Anderson |first = James |date=Oct 2000|volume = 5 |number = No. 4 |journal = Environmental History |page = 506 |publisher = Forest History Society and American Society for Environmental History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ordinary Mongols were not allowed to travel outside their own leagues. Mongols were forbidden by the Qing from crossing the borders of their banners, even into other Mongol Banners and from crossing into neidi (the Han Chinese 18 provinces) and were given serious punishments if they did in order to keep the Mongols divided against each other to benefit the Qing.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=fA7ADxUa6vUC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;dq=Cross+league+borders+mongols&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=yqgfVMatINiiyATElYKAAQ&amp;ved=0CCcQ6wEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Cross%20league%20borders%20mongols&amp;f=false Bulag 2012], p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the eighteenth century, growing numbers of [[Han Chinese]] settlers had illegally begun to move into the Inner Mongolian steppe. By 1791 there had been so many Han Chinese settlers in the [[Qian Gorlos Mongol Autonomous County|Front Gorlos Banner]] that the jasak had petitioned the Qing government to legalize the status of the peasants who had already settled there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = The Cambridge History of China |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |volume=10 |year=1978 |publisher = Cambridge University Press |location= |isbn= |page=356 |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the nineteenth century, the Manchus were becoming increasingly sinicized, and faced with the Russian threat, they began to encourage Han Chinese farmers to settle in both Mongolia and Manchuria. This policy was followed by subsequent governments. The railroads that were being built in these regions were especially useful to the Han Chinese settlers. Land was either sold by Mongol Princes, or leased to Han Chinese farmers, or simply taken away from the nomads and given to Han Chinese farmers. The [[Jindandao Incident]], a rebellion by an ethnic Chinese secret society called Jindandao occurred in Inner Mongolia in November 1891 and massacred 150,000 Mongols before being suppressed by government troops in late December.

Outer Mongolia gained independence from the Qing dynasty in 1911, when the Jebtsundamba Khutugtu of the Khalkha was declared the [[Bogd Khan]] of Mongolia. Although almost all banners of Inner Mongolia recognized the Bogd Khan as the supreme ruler of Mongols, the internal strife within the region prevented a full reunification. The Mongol rebellions in Inner Mongolia were counterbalanced by princes who hoped to see a restored Qing dynasty in Manchuria and Mongolia, as they considered the theocratic rule of the Bogd Khan would be against their modernizing objectives for Mongolia.&lt;ref&gt;Atwood, Christopher. The Encyclopedia of Mongolia and the Mongol Empire, p. 454.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, the newly formed [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] promised a new nation of five races ([[Han Chinese|Han]], [[Manchu]], [[Mongols in China|Mongol]], [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] and [[Uyghur people|Uyghur]]),&lt;ref&gt;Atwood, Christopher.

Publ.&lt;/ref&gt; forcing the Inner Mongolian princes to recognize the Republic of China.

The Republic of China reorganized Inner Mongolia into provinces:
* [[Rehe (province)|Rehe]] province was created to include the Juuuda and Josutu leagues, plus the [[Chengde]] area in what is now northern [[Hebei]].
* [[Chahar (province)|Chahar]] province was created to include Xilingol league as well as much of the former territory of the Eight Banners.
* [[Suiyuan]] province was created to include Ulanqab league, Yekejuu league, and the Hetao region (former Guihua Tümed territory).
* Hulunbuir stayed within [[Heilongjiang]] in Manchuria, which had become a province.
* Most of Jirim league came under the new province of [[Liaoning|Fengtian]] in southern Manchuria.
* Taoxi Mongolia, i.e. Alashan and Ejine leagues, was incorporated into neighbouring [[Gansu]] province. Later on [[Ningxia]] province was split out of northern Gansu, and Taoxi Mongolia became part of Ningxia.
Some [[Republic of China]] maps still show this structure.

The history of Inner Mongolia during the Second World War is complicated, with Japanese invasion and different kinds of resistance movements. In 1931, Manchuria came under the control of the Japanese puppet state [[Manchukuo]], taking some Mongol areas in the Manchurian provinces (i.e. Hulunbuir and Jirim leagues) along. Rehe was also incorporated into Manchukuo in 1933, taking Juu Uda and Josutu leagues along with it. These areas were occupied by Manchukuo until the end of [[World War II]] in 1945.

In 1937, the [[Empire of Japan]] openly and fully invaded [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] by war. On December 8, 1937, Mongolian Prince [[Demchugdongrub]] (also known as "De Wang") declared an independence of the remaining parts of Inner Mongolia (i.e. the Suiyuan and Chahar provinces) as [[Mengjiang]], and signed an agreements with Manchukuo and Japan. Its capital was established at [[Zhangbei Town|Zhangbei]] (now in [[Hebei]] province), with the Japanese puppet government's control extending as far west as the [[Hohhot]] region. The Japanese advanced was defeated by Hui Muslim General [[Ma Hongbin]] at the [[Battle of West Suiyuan]] and [[Battle of Wuyuan]]. After 1945, Inner Mongolia has remained part of China.

The Mongol [[Ulanhu]] fought against the Japanese.

Ethnic Mongolian guerilla units were created by the Kuomintang Nationalists to fight against the Japanese during the war in the late 30s and early 40s. These Mongol militias were created by the Ejine and Alashaa based commissioner's offices created by the Kuomintang.&lt;ref name="Lin"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lin|first=Hsiao-ting|chapter=4 War and new frontier designs|title=Modern China's Ethnic Frontiers: A Journey to the West|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N8YtCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA65#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|series=Routledge Studies in the Modern History of Asia|date=13 September 2010|isbn=978-1-136-92393-7|publisher=Routledge|pages=65–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lin|first=Hsiao-ting|chapter=4 War and new frontier designs|title=Modern China's Ethnic Frontiers: A Journey to the West|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DBPJBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT136#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|series=Routledge Studies in the Modern History of Asia|date=13 September 2010|isbn=978-1-136-92392-0|publisher=Routledge|pages=136–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prince Demchugdongrob's Mongols were targeted by Kuomintang Mongols to defect to the Republic of China.

=== People's Republic of China ===
{{POV section|date=March 2015}}

The Communist movement gradually gained momentum as part of the Third Communist International in Inner Mongolia during the Japanese period. By the end of WWII, the Inner Mongolian faction of the ComIntern had a functional militia, and actively opposed the attempts at independence by De Wang's Chinggisid princes on the grounds of fighting feudalism. Following the end of [[World War II]], the [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communists]] gained control of Manchuria as well as the Inner Mongolian Communists with decisive Soviet support, and established the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in 1947. The Comintern army was absorbed into the People's Liberation Army. Initially the autonomous region included just the Hulunbuir region. Over the next decade, as the communists established the [[People's Republic of China]] and consolidated control over mainland China, Inner Mongolia was expanded westwards to include five of the six original leagues (except Josutu League, which remains in [[Liaoning]] province), the northern part of the Chahar region, by then a league as well (southern Chahar remains in [[Hebei]] province), the Hetao region, and the Alashan and Ejine banners. Eventually, near all areas with sizeable Mongol populations were incorporated into the region, giving present-day Inner Mongolia its elongated shape. The leader of Inner Mongolia during that time, as both regional CPC secretary and head of regional government, was [[Ulanhu]].

During the [[Cultural Revolution]], the administration of Ulanhu was purged, and a wave of repressions was initiated against the Mongol population of the autonomous region.&lt;ref&gt;David Sneath, "The Impact of the Cultural Revolution in China on the Mongolians of Inner Mongolia", in ''Modern Asian Studies'', Vol. 28, No. 2 (May, 1994), pp. 409–430.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969 much of Inner Mongolia was distributed among surrounding provinces, with Hulunbuir divided between [[Heilongjiang]] and [[Jilin]], Jirim going to [[Jilin]], Juu Uda to [[Liaoning]], and the Alashan and Ejine region divided among [[Gansu]] and [[Ningxia]]. This was reversed in 1979.

Inner Mongolia has seen considerable development since [[Deng Xiaoping]] instituted [[Chinese economic reform]] in 1978. For about ten years since 2000, Inner Mongolia's GDP growth has been the highest in the country, (along with [[Guangdong]]) largely owing to the success of natural resource industries in the region. GDP growth has continually been over 10%, even 15% and connections with the [[Wolf Economy]] to the north has helped development. However, growth has come at a cost with huge amounts of pollution and degradation to the grasslands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://edition.cnn.com/2012/04/19/world/asia/china-mongolians-culture/ |title = Ethnic Mongolians in China concerned about cultural threat |author = Chi Chi Zhang, CNN |date = 19 April 2012 |work = CNN |access-date = 2015-03-24 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150402092316/http://edition.cnn.com/2012/04/19/world/asia/china-mongolians-culture/# |archive-date = 2015-04-02 |dead-url = no |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Attempts to attract [[Han Chinese|ethnic Chinese]] to migrate from other regions, as well as urbanise those rural nomads and peasants has led to huge amounts of corruption and waste in public spending, such as [[Ordos City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://content.time.com/time/photogallery/0,29307,1975397,00.html |title = Ordos, China: A Modern Ghost Town |work = TIME.com |access-date = 2015-03-24 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150324164032/http://content.time.com/time/photogallery/0,29307,1975397,00.html# |archive-date = 2015-03-24 |dead-url = no |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-17390729 |title = Ordos: The biggest ghost town in China |work = BBC News |access-date = 2018-06-21 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180624074430/https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-17390729# |archive-date = 2018-06-24 |dead-url = no |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Acute uneven [[wealth distribution]] has further exacerbated ethnic tensions, many indigenous Mongolians feeling they are increasingly marginalised in their own homeland, leading to [[2011 Inner Mongolia unrest|riots in 2011]] and 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://edition.cnn.com/videos/world/2012/04/18/atsr-china-inner-mongolian-culture-clash.cnn |title = Inner Mongolians culture clash |date = 18 April 2012 |work = CNN |access-date = 2015-03-24 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150402185604/http://edition.cnn.com/videos/world/2012/04/18/atsr-china-inner-mongolian-culture-clash.cnn# |archive-date = 2015-04-02 |dead-url = no |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rfa.org/english/news/china/launches-09052013110502.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402191136/http://www.rfa.org/english/news/china/launches-09052013110502.html# |date=2015-04-02 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geography ==
[[File:Grasslands-menggu.jpg|thumb|Grasslands in the region]]
[[File:Inner Mongolia Map.png|thumb|Topography of Inner Mongolia in China]]
Officially Inner Mongolia is classified as one of the provincial-level divisions of [[North China]], but its great stretch means that parts of it belong to [[Northeast China]] and [[Northwest China]] as well. It borders eight provincial-level divisions in all three of the aforementioned regions ([[Heilongjiang]], [[Jilin]], [[Liaoning]], [[Hebei]], [[Shanxi]], [[Shaanxi]], [[Ningxia]], and [[Gansu]]), tying with Shaanxi for the greatest number of bordering provincial-level divisions. Most of its international border is with Mongolia,{{Efn|The provinces of the Republic of Mongolia that border Inner Mongolia are, from east to west, [[Dornod Province|Dornod]], [[Sükhbaatar Province|Sükhbaatar]], [[Dornogovi Province|Dornogovi]], [[Ömnögovi Province|Ömnögovi]], [[Bayankhongor Province|Bayankhongor]], and [[Govi-Altai Province|Govi-Altai]]}} which, in Chinese, is sometimes called "[[Outer Mongolia]]", while a small portion is with Russia's [[Zabaykalsky Krai]].

[[File:昭君墓-青冢牌楼.JPG|thumb|Weeping [[willow]]s (''[[Salix babylonica|Salix Babylonica]]'') grow tall at the [[Zhaojun Tomb]] in [[Hohhot]], reflecting the milder climate there.]]
Inner Mongolia largely consists of the northern side of the [[North China Craton]], a tilted and sedimented [[Precambrian]] block. In the extreme southwest is the edge of the Tibetan Plateau where the autonomous region’s highest peak, [[Main Peak, Helan Mountains|Main Peak]] in the [[Helan Mountains]] reaches {{convert|3556|m|ft|-1}}, and is still being pushed up today in short bursts.&lt;ref name="quaternary"&gt;Wei Zhang, Mingyue He, Yonghua Li, Zhijiu Cui, Zhilin Wang and Yang Yu; [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11434-012-5283-z?LI=true “Quaternary glacier development and the relationship between the climate change and tectonic uplift in the Helan Mountains”] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170614221659/https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11434-012-5283-z?LI=true# |date=2017-06-14 }}; in ''Chinese Science Bulletin''; December 2012, Volume 57, Issue 34, pp. 4491–4504.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of Inner Mongolia is a plateau averaging around {{convert|1200|m|ft|-1}} in altitude and covered by extensive [[loess]] and [[sand]] deposits. The northern part consists of the [[Mesozoic]] era [[Khingan Mountains]], and is owing to the cooler climate more forested, chiefly with [[Ulmus laciniata|Manchurian elm]], [[Ash (Fraxinus)|ash]], [[birch]], [[Quercus mongolica|Mongolian oak]] and a number of [[Pinus|pine]] and [[Picea|spruce]] species. Where [[discontinuous permafrost]] is present north of [[Hailar District]], forests are almost exclusively coniferous. In the south the natural vegetation is grassland in the east and very sparse in the arid west, and grazing is the dominant economic activity.

Owing to the ancient, weathered rocks lying under its deep sedimentary cover, Inner Mongolia is a major mining district, possessing large reserves of [[coal]], [[iron ore]] and [[rare-earth]] minerals, which have made it a major industrial region today.

=== Climate ===
Due to its elongated shape, Inner Mongolia has a wide variety of regional climates. Throughout the region, the climate is based off a four-season, [[monsoon]] climate. The winters in Inner Mongolia are very long, cold, and dry with frequent blizzards, though snowfall is so light that Inner Mongolia has no modern glaciers&lt;ref name="quaternary"/&gt; even on the highest Helan peaks. The spring is short, mild and arid, with large, dangerous [[sandstorms]], whilst the summer is very warm to hot and relatively humid except in the west where it remains dry. Autumn is brief and sees a steady cooling, with temperatures below {{convert|0|C|F}} reached in October in the north and November in the south.

Officially, most of Inner Mongolia is classified as either a [[cold arid]] or [[Steppe climate|steppe]] regime ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''BWk, BSk'', respectively). The small portion besides these are classified as [[humid continental]] (Köppen ''Dwb'') in the northeast, or [[Subarctic climate|subarctic]] (Köppen ''Dwc'') in the far north near [[Hulunbuir]].&lt;ref&gt;Peel, M. C. and Finlayson, B. L. and McMahon, T. A. (2007).

== Administrative divisions ==
{{Main|List of administrative divisions of Inner Mongolia|List of township-level divisions of Inner Mongolia}}

Inner Mongolia is divided into twelve [[Administrative divisions of China#Prefectural level|prefecture-level divisions]]. Until the late 1990s, most of Inner Mongolia's prefectural regions were known as ''[[Leagues of China|Leagues]]'' ({{zh |c = 盟}}), a usage retained from Mongol divisions of the [[Qing dynasty]]. Similarly, county-level divisions are often known as ''Banners'' ({{zh |c = 旗}}). Since the 1990s, numerous Leagues have converted into [[Prefecture-level city|prefecture-level cities]], although Banners remain. The restructuring led to the conversion of primate cities in most leagues to convert to districts administratively (i.e.: [[Hailar District|Hailar]], [[Jining District|Jining]] and [[Dongsheng]]). Some newly founded prefecture-level cities have chosen to retain the original name of League (i.e.: Hulunbuir, Bayannur and Ulanqab), some have adopted the Chinese name of their [[primate city]] ([[Chifeng]], [[Tongliao]]), and one League (Yekejuu) simply renamed itself [[Ordos City|Ordos]]. Despite these recent administrative changes, there is no indication that the Alxa, Hinggan, and Xilingol Leagues will convert to prefecture-level cities in the near future.

== Economy ==
Farming of crops such as [[wheat]] takes precedence along the river valleys. In the more arid grasslands, herding of [[goat]]s, [[sheep]] and so on is a traditional method of subsistence. [[Forestry]] and [[hunting]] are somewhat important in the [[Greater Khingan]] ranges in the east. [[Reindeer]] herding is carried out by [[Evenks]] in the Evenk Autonomous Banner. More recently, growing [[grape]]s and [[winemaking]] have become an economic factor in the [[Wuhai]] area.

Inner Mongolia has an abundance of resources especially coal, [[Cashmere wool|cashmere]], natural gas, [[rare-earth element]]s, and has more deposits of naturally occurring [[niobium]], [[zirconium]] and [[beryllium]] than any other [[province]]-level region in China. However, in the past, the exploitation and utilisation of resources were rather inefficient, which resulted in poor returns from rich resources. Inner Mongolia is also an important coal production base, with more than a quarter of the world's coal reserves located in the province.&lt;ref name="thechinaperspective.com"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.thechinaperspective.com/topics/province/inner-mongolia-autonomous-region/ |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110926072632/http://www.thechinaperspective.com/topics/province/inner-mongolia-autonomous-region/ |dead-url = yes |archive-date = 2011-09-26 |title = China Economy @ China Perspective |website = thechinaperspective.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; It plans to double annual coal output by 2010 (from the 2005 volume of 260 million tons) to 500 million tons of coal a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://english.people.com.cn/200512/27/eng20051227_231175.html |title = People's Daily Online  -- Inner Mongolia to double annual coal output by 2010 |work = people.com.cn |access-date = 2006-02-05 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060627095229/http://english.people.com.cn/200512/27/eng20051227_231175.html# |archive-date = 2006-06-27 |dead-url = no |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Industry in Inner Mongolia has grown up mainly around coal, [[power generation]], forestry-related industries, and related industries.
Inner Mongolia now encourages six competitive industries: energy, chemicals, metallurgy, equipment manufacturing, processing of farm (including [[dairy]]) produce, and high technology. Well-known Inner Mongolian enterprises include companies such as [[ERDOS]], [[Yili Group|Yili]], and [[Mengniu]].

The nominal GDP of Inner Mongolia in 2015 was 1.8 trillion yuan (US$272.1 billion), with an average annual increase of 10% from the period 2010-2015. Its per capita GDP reached US$11,500 in 2015, ranking No.4th among all the 31 provinces of China, only after Shanghai, Beijing and Tianjin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://english.people.com.cn/200602/05/eng20060205_240396.html |title = People's Daily Online -- Inner Mongolia's economy maintains a rapid growth momentum |work = people.com.cn |access-date = 2006-02-05 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060228041645/http://english.people.com.cn/200602/05/eng20060205_240396.html# |archive-date = 2006-02-28 |dead-url = no |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with much of China, economic growth has led to a boom in construction, including new commercial development and large apartment complexes.

In addition to its large reserves of natural resources, Inner Mongolia also has the largest usable wind power capacity in China&lt;ref name="thechinaperspective.com"/&gt; thanks to strong winds which develop in the province's grasslands. Some private companies have set up [[Wind power in China|wind parks]] in parts of Inner Mongolia such as [[Bail Miao|Bailingmiao]], Hutengliang and Zhouzi.

== Government and politics ==
{{Main|Politics of Inner Mongolia}}
{{See also|List of provincial leaders of the People's Republic of China}}

Under the [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China]], articles 112-122, [[autonomous region]]s have limited autonomy in both the political and economic arena.  Autonomous regions have more discretion in administering economic policy in the region in accordance with national guidelines. Structurally, the Chairman—who legally must be an ethnic minority and is usually ethnic Mongolian—is always kept in check by the [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]] Regional Committee Secretary, who is usually from a different part of China (to reduce corruption) and Han Chinese. The current party secretary is [[Wang Jun (PRC politician)|Wang Jun]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://china.org.cn/english/features/40664.htm|title=Who's Who in China's Leadership|work=china.org.cn|access-date=2007-11-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623185253/http://www.china.org.cn/english/features/40664.htm#|archive-date=2011-06-23|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Inner Mongolian government and its subsidiaries follow roughly the same structure as that of a Chinese province. With regards to economic policy, as a part of increased [[Chinese federalism|federalism]] characteristics in China, Inner Mongolia has become more independent in implementing its own economic roadmap.

The position of Chairman of Inner Mongolia alternates between [[Khorchin Mongols]] in the east and the Tumed Mongols in the west. Since the end of the Cultural Revolution, this convention has not been broken. The family of [[Ulanhu]] has retained influence in regional politics ever since the founding the People's Republic. His son [[Buhe (politician)|Buhe]] and granddaughter [[Bu Xiaolin]] both served as Chairman of the region.

When the autonomous region was established in 1947, Han Chinese comprised 83.6% of the population, while the Mongols comprised 14.8% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;[[Myron Weiner]], Sharon Stanton Russell(2001). Demography and national security. page 276, table 9.4.&lt;/ref&gt;  By 2010, the percentage of Han Chinese had dropped to 79.5%. While the Hetao region along the Yellow River has always alternated between farmers from the south and nomads from the north, the most recent wave of Han Chinese migration began in the early 18th century with encouragement from the [[Qing dynasty]], and continued into the 20th century. Han Chinese live mostly in the Hetao region as well as various population centres in central and eastern Inner Mongolia. Over 70% of Mongols are concentrated in less than 18% of Inner Mongolia's territory ([[Hinggan League]], and the prefectures of [[Tongliao]] and [[Chifeng]]).

Mongols are the second largest ethnic group, comprising 17.11% of the population as of the 2010 census.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21710264-worlds-rising-superpower-has-particular-vision-ethnicity-and-nationhood-has|title=Who is Chinese?

In addition to the Manchus, three other [[Tungusic peoples|Tungusic]] ethnic groups, the [[Daur people|Daur]], the [[Oroqen people|Oroqen]], and the [[Evenks]] also populate parts of northeastern Inner Mongolia.

Many of the traditionally nomadic Mongols have settled in permanent homes as their pastoral economy was collectivized during the Mao Era, and some have taken jobs in cities as migrant labourers; however, some Mongols continue in their nomadic tradition. In practice, highly educated Mongols tend to migrate to big urban centers after which they become essentially indistinct with ethnic Han Chinese populations.

Inter-marriage between Mongol and non-Mongol populations is very common, particularly in areas where Mongols are in regular contact with other groups. There was little cultural stigma within Mongol families for marrying outside the ethnic group, and in urban centers in particular, Mongol men and women married non-Mongols at relatively similar rates. The rates of intermarriage stands in very sharp contrast to ethnic Tibetans and Uyghurs in their respective autonomous regions. By the 1980s, for instance, in [[Tongliao|the former Jirim League]], nearly 40% of marriages with at least one Mongol spouse was a mixed Mongol-Han Chinese marriage.&lt;ref name="rut1999"&gt;{{cite book|title=Mongolia in the Twentieth Century|date=1999|publisher=Rutledge|location=New York City|page=213}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, anecdotal reports have also demonstrated an increase in Mongol-female, Han Chinese-male pairings in which the woman is of a rural background, ostensibly shutting rural Mongol males from the marriage market as the sex ratio in China becomes more skewed with a much higher proportion of men.&lt;ref name="socio"&gt;{{cite news|last1=He|first1=Shenghai|last2=Eade|first2=John|title=Unequal Marriage Exchange Between Majority and Minority Groups: A Case Study From Inner Mongolia, China|url=http://www.davidpublisher.com/Public/uploads/Contribute/55f62d8c9a871.pdf|work=Sociology Study|date=May 2015|access-date=2016-08-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180729171043/http://www.davidpublisher.com/Public/uploads/Contribute/55f62d8c9a871.pdf#|archive-date=2018-07-29|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside Chinese, Mongolian is the official provincial language of the [[Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region]], where there are at least 4.1 million ethnic Mongols.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tsung|first1=Linda|title=Language Power and Hierarchy: Multilingual Education in China|date=October 27, 2014|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|page=59|chapter=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Across the whole of China, the language is spoken by roughly half of the country's 5.8 million ethnic Mongols (2005 estimate)&lt;ref name="Mongolian"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Janhunen|first1=Juha|title=Mongolian|date=November 29, 2012|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|page=11|chapter=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the exact number of Mongolian speakers in China is unknown, as there is no data available on the language proficiency of that country's citizens. The use of Mongolian in China, specifically in Inner Mongolia, has witnessed periods of decline and revival over the last few hundred years. The language experienced a decline during the late Qing period, a revival between 1947 and 1965, a second decline between 1966 and 1976, a second revival between 1977 and 1992, and a third decline between 1995 and 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tsung|first1=Linda|title=Language Power and Hierarchy: Multilingual Education in China|date=October 27, 2014|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|chapter=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in spite of the decline of the Mongolian language in some of Inner Mongolia's urban areas and educational spheres, the ethnic identity of the urbanized Chinese-speaking Mongols is most likely going to survive due to the presence of urban ethnic communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Iredale|first1=Robyn|last2=Bilik|first2=Naran|last3=Fei|first3=Guo|title=China's Minorities on the Move: Selected Case Studies|date=August 2, 2003|page=84|chapter=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The multilingual situation in Inner Mongolia does not appear to obstruct efforts by ethnic Mongols to preserve their language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Janhunen|first1=Juha|title=Mongolian|date=November 29, 2012|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|page=16|chapter=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Otsuka|first1=Hitomi|title=More Morphologies: Contributions to the Festival of Languages, Bremen, 17 Sep to 7 Oct, 2009|date=30 Nov 2012|page=99|chapter=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although an unknown number of Mongols in China, such as the Tumets, may have completely or partially lost the ability to speak their language, they are still registered as ethnic Mongols and continue to identify themselves as ethnic Mongols.&lt;ref name="Mongolian"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Iredale|first1=Robyn|title=China's Minorities on the Move: Selected Case Studies|date=August 2, 2003|publisher=Routledge|pages=56, 64–67|chapter=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The children of inter-ethnic Mongol-Chinese marriages also claim to be and are registered as ethnic Mongols.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Janhunen|first1=Juha|title=Mongolian|date=November 29, 2012 |publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|page=11|chapter=1}}{{cite book |last1=Iredale|first1=Robyn|last2=Bilik|first2=Naran|last3=Fei|first3=Guo|title=China's Minorities on the Move: Selected Case Studies|date=August 2, 2003|page=61|chapter=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By law, all street signs, commercial outlets, and government documents must be bilingual, written in both Mongolian and Chinese. There are three Mongolian TV channels in the Inner Mongolia Satellite TV network. In public transportation, all announcements are to be bilingual.

[[Mongols]] in Inner Mongolia speak [[Mongolian language|Mongolian dialects]] such as [[Chakhar Mongolian|Chakhar]], Xilingol, [[Baarin Mongolian|Baarin]], [[Khorchin Mongolian|Khorchin]] and Kharchin Mongolian and, depending on definition and analysis, further dialects&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Sečenbaγatur, Qasgerel, Tuyaγ-a, B. ǰirannige, U Ying ǰe. 2005. ''Mongγul kelen-ü nutuγ-un ayalγun-u sinǰilel-ün uduridqal''. Kökeqota: ÖMAKQ.&lt;/ref&gt; or closely related independent Central [[Mongolic languages]]&lt;ref&gt;e.g. [[Juha Janhunen|Janhunen, Juha]]. 2006. Mongolic languages. In: Brown, K. (ed.): ''The encyclopedia of language &amp; linguistics''. Amsterdam: Elsevier: 231–234.&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Ordos Mongolian|Ordos]], [[Khamnigan Mongol|Khamnigan]], Barghu [[Buryat language|Buryat]] and the arguably [[Oirat language|Oirat]] dialect [[Alasha dialect|Alasha]]. The standard pronunciation of Mongolian in China is based on the Chakhar dialect of the [[Plain Blue Banner, Inner Mongolia|Plain Blue Banner]], located in central Inner Mongolia, while the grammar is based on all [[Southern Mongolian|Southern Mongolian dialects]].&lt;ref&gt;Sečenbaγatur et al. 2005: 85.&lt;/ref&gt; This is different from the Mongolian state, where the standard pronunciation is based on the closely related [[Khalkha]] dialect. There are a number of independent languages spoken in [[Hulunbuir]] such as the somewhat more distant Mongolic language [[Daur language|Dagur]] and the [[Tungusic languages|Tungusic language]] [[Evenki language|Evenki]]. Officially, even the Evenki dialect [[Oroqen language|Oroqin]] is considered a language.&lt;ref&gt;Janhunen, Juha. 1997. The languages of Manchuria in today’s China. In: Northern Minority languages: Problems of survival. ''Senri ethnological studies'', 44: 123–146. See pages 130–133.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Han Chinese]] of Inner Mongolia speak a variety of dialects, depending on the region. Those in the eastern parts tend to speak [[Northeastern Mandarin]], which belongs to the [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] group of dialects; those in the central parts, such as the [[Yellow River]] valley, speak varieties of [[Jin Chinese|Jin]], another subdivision of Chinese, due to its proximity to other Jin-speaking areas in China such as the [[Shanxi]] province. Cities such as Hohhot and Baotou both have their unique brand of Jin Chinese such as the [[Zhangjiakou–Hohhot dialect]] which are sometimes incomprehensible with dialects spoken in northeastern regions such as [[Hailar District|Hailar]].

The vast grasslands have long symbolised Inner Mongolia. Mongolian art often depicts the grassland in an uplifting fashion and emphasizes Mongolian nomadic traditions. The [[Mongols in China|Mongol]]s of Inner Mongolia still practice their traditional arts. Inner Mongolian cuisine has Mongol roots and consists of [[dairy]]-related products and ''hand-held lamb'' ({{lang|zh|手扒肉}}). In recent years, franchises based on [[Hot pot]] have appeared in Inner Mongolia, the best known of which is ''[[Little Sheep Group|Xiaofeiyang]]''. Notable Inner Mongolian commercial brand names include [[Mengniu]] and [[Yili Group|Yili]], both of which began as dairy product and [[ice cream]] producers.

Among the [[Han Chinese]] of Inner Mongolia, Jinju ({{lang|zh-hans|晋剧}}) or [[Shanxi Opera]] is a popular traditional form of entertainment. See also: [[Shanxi]]. A popular career in Inner Mongolia is circus acrobatics. The internationally known Inner Mongolia Acrobatic Troupe travels and performs with the renowned Ringling Bros. and Barnum and Bailey Circus.

The Chinese worship Genghis as the ancestral god of the [[Yuan dynasty]].}}]]
{{Main|Religion in Inner Mongolia}}

According to a survey held in 2004 by the [[Minzu University of China]], about 80% of the population of the region practice the worship of Heaven (that is named ''[[Tian]]'' in the Chinese tradition and ''[[Tengri|Tenger]]'' in the Mongolian tradition) and of ''[[ovoo|ovoo/aobao]]''.&lt;ref name="Yang-Lang"&gt;Fenggang Yang, Graeme Lang. ''Social Scientific Studies of Religion in China''. BRILL, 2012. {{ISBN|9004182462}}. pp. 184-185, reporting the results of surveys held in 2004 by the [[Minzu University of China]]. Quote from page 185: «[...] ''the registered adherents of the five official religions comprise only 3.7% of those [populations] in Inner Mongolia. When we compare this final statistic with Minzu University research team's finding that '''80% of the inhabitants of Inner Mongolia''' worship ''Tian'' (loosely translated "Heaven") and ''aobao'' (traditional stone structures that serve as altars for sacrifice), it is evident that the official calculations of registered religious believers are markedly low, and the policy decisions based on these numbers lack the necessary grounding in reality.'' [...] ''Foreign religions can be transformed into indigenous ethnic religions, and the traditional folk religions of China's ethnic minorities can integrate and neutralize non-native religions. Thus, China's ethnic religions should not be regarded as social burdens or challenges, but rather as valuable cultural assets.''»&lt;/ref&gt;

Official statistics report that 12.1% of the population (3 million people) are members of Tibetan Buddhist groups.&lt;ref name="Wu-Fang2016"&gt;Jiayu Wu, Yong Fang (2016).

The [[cult (religious practice)|cult]] of [[Genghis Khan]], present in the form of various Genghis Khan temples, is a tradition of Mongolian shamanism, in which he is considered a [[cultural hero]] and divine ancestor, an embodiment of the ''[[Tengri|Tenger]]'' (Heaven, God of Heaven).&lt;ref&gt;John Man.

''Genghis Khan''. Bantam, 2005. {{ISBN|0553814982}}. p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tibetan Buddhism]] ([[Buddhism in Mongolia|Mongolian Buddhism]], locally also known as "Yellow Buddhism") is the dominant form of Buddhism in Inner Mongolia, also practiced by many [[Han Chinese]]. Another form of Buddhism, practiced by the Chinese, are the schools of [[Chinese Buddhism]].

== Chinese space program ==
One of China's space vehicle launch facilities, [[Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center]], is located in the extreme west of Inner Mongolia, in the [[Alxa League]]'s [[Ejin Banner]]. It was founded in 1958, making it the PRC's first launch facility. More Chinese launches have occurred at Jiuquan than anywhere else. As with all Chinese launch facilities, it is remote and generally closed to the public. It is named as such since Jiuquan is the nearest urban center, although Jiuquan is in the nearby province of Gansu. Many space vehicles have also made their touchdowns in Inner Mongolia. For example, the crew of [[Shenzhou 6]] landed in [[Siziwang Banner]], near [[Hohhot]].

[[Image:IPP.svg|thumb|right|400px|The signal transmitted from the satellite to the receiver crosses the ionospheric shell in the so-called ''ionospheric pierce point'' (IPP). The zenith angle at
the IPP is ''z''' and the signal arrives at the receiver with zenith angle ''z''. Here ''R'' is the mean Earth radius, ''H'' is the mean height of the ionosphere shell.]]
Most [[global navigation satellite system]]s (GNSS) are subjected to errors induced by the [[ionosphere]]. Because [[ionospheric delay]] affects the speed of microwave signals differently depending on their frequency—a characteristic known as [[Dispersion (optics)|dispersion]], delays measured on two or more frequency bands can be used to measure dispersion, and this measurement can then be used to estimate the delay at each frequency. 

The principal source of the dispersion comes from the [[total electron content]] (TEC) in the ionosphere, along the line of sight from the [[satellite]] to the receiver. Because it is difficult to measure the TEC along the line of sight, instead a prediction can be made using a simplified model of the ionosphere.

This model assumes that the ionosphere is a thin, uniform-density shell about the earth, located near the mean altitude ''H'' of maximum TEC (approx. 350&amp;nbsp;km). Using geometry, a slant intersection with this shell model can be determined and a vertical TEC measurement inferred. The intersection between line of sight and this shell is called the ''ionospheric pierce point'' (IPP). The perpendicular projection onto the earth's surface is called the ''subionospheric point''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6347">The '''Middle Eastern Geodatabase for Antiquities''' (MEGA) is a [[web based]] [[geographic information system]] or GIS developed by the [[Getty Conservation Institute]] (GCI), with matching funds from the [[World Monuments Fund (WMF)]] and in partnership with the Jordanian Department of Antiquities (DoA). The GIS will serve as the primary tool for the Jordanian DoA in its ongoing work to inventory, monitor, and manage Jordan's vast number of archaeological sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Randy Kennedy |coauthors= |title=In History-Rich Region, a Very New System Tracks Very Old Things |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/25/arts/design/25getty.html?8dpc |quote= |work=[[New York Times]] |date= August 24, 2010 |accessdate=2010-08-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The system ==

MEGA–Jordan is, at its core, an electronic inventory capable of maintaining information on site location and extent, site characteristics, and site condition in an easy-to-use manner. Ultimately it will help standardize and centralize information on archaeological sites throughout the country in a single system focused primarily on the aims of heritage management and research. MEGA–Jordan will become the DoA's preeminent planning and decision-making tool, addressing its needs and demands related to the legal protection of sites, site management, infrastructure and development control, World Heritage requirements, and development of national and regional research strategies. Infrastructure and development planning are especially crucial, and the GIS will permit the DoA to assess the potential impact of development projects (e.g., construction of buildings, roadways, pipelines) on or near archaeological sites. MEGA–Jordan is also seen as a tool for coordinating archaeological site data with Jordanian government ministries (e.g., Tourism and Antiquities, Planning, Agriculture) and for academic research.

The system offers various levels of user access based on user roles—i.e., some users will have full access to all data and the ability to add and edit sites and their attributes, approve new sites, run administrative reports, and export data, while others may only have access to search and view the data.

The MEGA system was built by [http://www.fargeo.com/ Farallon Geographics] using [[open source software]], which means that its software code is not exclusively owned. This allows it to be updated, modified, and customized to meet future needs at little or no cost. It is fully compatible with all standard GIS tools, facilitating data sharing among government agencies and researchers. The core MEGA software has been designed so that it can, independent of the Jordanian system, be freely and readily customized for use by other countries. The system uses such open source technologies as PostgreSQL, PostGIS, GeoServer, OpenLayers, jQuery, and ExtJS.

== Fundamental design requirements  ==

# The system should be a map-based, Web-enabled inventory with access to data from all of DoA's regional officess.
# It should have a user interface in both English and standard Arabic and be capable of handling data in both languages.
# The technical tools (i.e., software) used to build the system must be low-cost (or no-cost wherever feasible), open source, non-proprietary, and accessible both technically and financially by those who will need to support, maintain, and sustain the system for many years to come.
# The system must be easy to use and not require extensive training for the general user—i.e., users need not be GIS experts.
# It must have wide compatibility with similar systems of Jordanian national and local authorities, such as the Lands and Survey Department, city governments, and the like.
# The system must allow the export of data that is fully compatible with other GIS tools such as Google Earth™, [[QGIS]], and ESRI's ArcView.
# The system must include the ability to record detailed data on monitoring of sites and site elements and archaeological surveys.
# It should be readily customizable to accommodate changes in practices that the DoA may make in the future.
# It must ensure, wherever possible, consistent and valid entry of information.
# It must provide the ability to prepare data electronically from the field.
# The system must include easy, instant reporting capabilities.
# All data must be secure and appropriate back-up strategies need to be implemented.
# The system should provide various levels of user access based on user roles—i.e., some users will have full access to all data, while others may only have read-access to certain areas of the database.
# The system must be developed in such a way that the addition of tools to inventory, monitor, and help manage heritage buildings can be added without major redevelopment of the system.

[[File:Al Khazneh Petra.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Al_Khazneh Petra Jordan.|The most iconic image of an archaeological site in Jordan is likely that of Al-Khazneh (Arabic for 'treasury') of Petra, which was elaborately carved into a sandstone cliff between approximately 100 AD and 200 BC. Its name is a misnomer, as the facade's extensive funerary symbols suggest that it was constructed as a tomb.]]

The MEGA system was selected as "one of the 100 most significant innovations of 2010" by Netexplorateur:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.netexplorateur.org/ Netexplorateur]&lt;/ref&gt;
"The Netexplorateur 100 is a pragmatic approach to the global digital revolution, based on the power of example.
''The selection recognizes 100 pioneers who produce mobile applications, web 2.0 sites, software or games, break new ground in culture or education, think up new forms of solidarity or citizenship or transform management methods and business models. These 100 Netexplrateurs are exploring new territories and creating new practices to map out and shape the digital era.''"

'''Musala''' ({{lang-bg|Мусала}}); from [[Arabic language|Arabic]] through [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]]: from ''[[Musalla]]'', "near God" or "place for prayer" &lt;ref&gt;Известия на българското географско дружество, 1964 г. стр. 197.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bŭlgarski ezik, Volume 19,Institut za bŭlgarski ezik (Bŭlgarska akademii͡a na naukite), 1969, str. 573.&lt;/ref&gt; is the highest [[mountain|peak]] in the entire [[Balkan Peninsula]], standing at 2,925 m (9,596&amp;nbsp;ft). The summit of the [[Rila]] mountain range in southwestern Bulgaria, Musala is the highest peak between the [[Alps]] and the [[Caucasus]]{{fact|date=September 2018}} and the highest in Eastern Europe bar the Caucasus. With a prominence of 2473 m, Musala is the 7th most prominent mountain peak in Europe.&lt;ref name="peaklist"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peaklist.org/WWlists/ultras/EuroCoreP1500m.html|title=Europe Ultra-Prominences|work=Peaklist|accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Musala is situated within the [[Rila National Park]], which is noted for its rich [[Flora (plants)|flora]], including species such as [[Macedonian Pine]] and [[Bulgarian Fir]] in the forests on its middle slopes, and [[Fauna (animals)|fauna]]; it is one of the easiest places in Europe to see the [[wallcreeper]]. All major mountain ranges of Bulgaria can be seen from the top; these include [[Vitosha]] to the northwest, [[Sredna Gora]] towards the northeast, the [[Balkan Mountains]] along most of the northern horizon behind Vitosha and Sredna Gora, the [[Rhodope Mountains]] to the southeast, [[Pirin]] to the south, [[Osogovo]] and [[Ruy Mountain]] to the west, and [[Rila]].

A cosmic ray station was built on the peak in 1960 with cooperation from the Hungarian Academy of Science. The station conducted scientific experiments using a muon telescope. The station was destroyed by an electrical fire on October 29, 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kavlakov|first=S.|date=2009-11-16|title=Cosmic Ray investigations on peak Musala in Bulgaria: A memoir|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273117709004463|journal=Advances in Space Research|series=Cosmic Rays From Past to Present|volume=44|issue=10|pages=1178–1182|doi=10.1016/j.asr.2008.10.040}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With an average annual temperature of -2.3&amp;nbsp;°C Musala is the coldest place in Bulgaria and the entire Balkan Peninsula.{{fact|date=July 2017}} Temperatures stay below 0&amp;nbsp;°C for about 8 months each year.{{fact|date=July 2017}} Due to this about 45% of the annual precipitation on Musala is snow, and snow cover lasts for about 200 days (more than six months).{{fact|date=July 2017}} Three of the main rivers of Bulgaria, the [[Iskar (river)|Iskar]], [[Maritsa]] and [[Mesta River|Mesta]] have their sources near Musala.

The next highest peaks in the vicinity of Musala are Little Musala (2,902 m) and Irechek (2,852 m).

==Climate==

Peak Musala has an alpine climate with cold, long winters and short, cool summers. Usually, through winter, the temperatures don't exceed the freezing point for months. Snow cover lasts for about 8–9 months. Through the summer, temperatures rarely go above 14-15C. The summer season only lasts for 2 months, and snowfalls are possible. For the period 1931-2013, the highest recorded temperature was {{Convert|20.0|C}}, and the lowest - {{Convert|-31.2|C}}. The average annual temperature is {{Convert|-2.5|C}}, which makes the peak the coldest place in Bulgaria.

'''Ossetia''' ({{IPAc-en|ɒ|ˈ|s|ɛ|t|j|ə|,_|ɒ|ˈ|s|iː|ʃ|ə}};&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/ossetia "Ossetia"]. ''[[Collins English Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-os|Ир, Ирыстон|Ir, Iryston}}; {{lang-ru|Осе́тия|Osetiya}}; {{lang-ka|ოსეთი}}, &lt;small&gt;[[Romanization of Georgian|translit.]]&lt;/small&gt; ''Oseti'') is an [[Ethnolinguistics|ethnolinguistic]] region located on both sides of the [[Greater Caucasus]] Mountains, largely inhabited by the [[Ossetians]]. The [[Ossetian language]] is part of the [[Eastern Iranian languages|Eastern Iranian branch]] of the [[Indo-European languages| Indo-European languages family]]. The Ossetian-speaking area south of the main Caucasus ridge is recognized by most countries as within the borders of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], but under the control of the Russian-backed ''[[de facto]]'' government of the [[South Ossetia|Republic of South Ossetia]]. The northern portion of the region consists of the republic of [[North Ossetia–Alania]] within the [[Russian Federation]].

* 1922 — Creation of the [[South Ossetia]] and transformation of Ossetia into [[North Ossetia]]. [[North Ossetia]] remains a part of [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]], [[South Ossetia]] remains a part of [[Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic|Georgian SSR]].
* 20 September 1990 — Independent Republic of South Ossetia. The republic remained unrecognized, yet it detached itself from Georgia ''de facto''. In the last years of the [[Soviet Union]], [[ethnic]] tensions between Ossetians and [[Georgian people|Georgians]] in Georgia's former [[Autonomous Oblast]] of South Ossetia (abolished in 1990) and between Ossetians and the [[Ingush people|Ingush]] in North Ossetia evolved into violent clashes that left several hundred dead and wounded and created a large tide of refugees on both sides of the border.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Ghebali | title = Helsinki | year = 2003 | volume = 4 | url = http://www.gcsp.ch/e/publications/Issues_Institutions/Int_Organisations/Academic_Articles/Ghebali-Helsinki-3-04.pdf | place = [[Switzerland|CH]] | format = PDF}}. {{dead link|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Avrasya | title = Ehatipoglu | year = 2005 | url = http://www.obiv.org.tr/2005/avrasya/ehatipoglu.pdf | place = [[Turkey|TR]] | publisher = Obiv | format = PDF}}. {{dead link|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a Russian-mediated and [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]]-monitored [[ceasefire]] was implemented in South Ossetia in 1992, the [[Georgian-Ossetian conflict]] still remains unresolved even though a recent peace plan proposed by the government of Georgia promised the South Ossetians larger [[autonomy]] and pledged expanded international involvement in the political settlement of the conflict. Meanwhile, the South Ossetian [[secessionist]] authorities demand independence or unification with North Ossetia under the [[Russia|Russian Federation]] while the international community refuses to recognize South Ossetia as an independent country and considers the area part of Georgia.

On Sunday 12 November 2006, South Ossetians (mostly ethnic [[Ossetian people|Ossetians]]) went to the polls to vote in a referendum regarding the region's independence from Georgia. The result was a "yes" to independence, with a turnout above 95% from those among the territory's 70,000 people who were eligible to vote at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.opendemocracy.net/democracy-caucasus/south_ossetia_4100.jsp |title=South Ossetia: Russian, Georgian... independent? |accessdate=2008-08-10|publisher=OpenDemocracy}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was also a vote in favour of a new term for South Ossetia's president, [[Eduard Kokoity]].

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to Saint Kitts and Nevis:

The '''[[Federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis]]''', also known as '''[[Saint Christopher and Nevis]]''',&lt;ref&gt;Both the names Saint Christopher and Saint Kitts are given in the [http://pdba.georgetown.edu/Constitutions/Kitts/kitts83.html [[Constitution of Saint Christopher and Nevis]]].&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[List of sovereign states|sovereign]] [[federation|federal]] [[Island nation|two-island nation]] located in the [[Leeward Islands]] in the [[Caribbean Sea]].&lt;ref name=CIA_World_Factbook&gt;{{cite web|date=7 July 2009|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/sc.html|title=Saint Kitts and Nevis|work=[[The World Factbook]]|publisher=United States [[Central Intelligence Agency]]|accessdate=23 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is the smallest nation in the [[Americas]], in both [[List of countries by area|area]] and [[List of countries by population|population]].

The capital city and headquarters of government for the federated state is on the larger island of [[Saint Kitts]]. The smaller state of [[Nevis]] lies about 2 miles (3&amp;nbsp;km) southeast of Saint Kitts, across a shallow channel called "The Narrows".

Historically, the British dependency of [[Anguilla]] was also a part of this union, which was then known collectively as [[Saint Christopher-Nevis-Anguilla]].

Saint Kitts and Nevis are geographically part of the Leeward Islands. To the north-northwest lie the islands of [[Sint Eustatius]], [[Saba]], [[Saint Barthélemy]], and [[Saint Martin|Saint-Martin/Sint Maarten]]. To the east and northeast are [[Antigua and Barbuda]], and to the southeast is the small uninhabited island of [[Redonda]], and the island of [[Montserrat]], which currently has an active volcano  (see [[Soufrière Hills]].)

Saint Kitts and Nevis were amongst the first islands in the Caribbean to be settled by Europeans. Saint Kitts was home to the first British and French colonies in the [[Caribbean]].

Saint Kitts and Nevis is the smallest nation on Earth to ever host a [[Cricket World Cup|World Cup event]]; it was one of the host venues of the [[2007 Cricket World Cup]].

== Nature of geography ==

=== Geography is  ===

* an [[academic discipline]] &amp;ndash; a body of knowledge given to − or received by − a disciple (student); a branch or sphere of knowledge, or field of study, that an individual has chosen to specialize in. Modern geography is an all-encompassing discipline that seeks to understand the Earth and all of its human and natural complexities − not merely where objects are, but how they have changed and come to be. Geography has been called 'the world discipline'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Bonnett|first= Alastair |title =  What is Geography?|location= London|publisher = Sage|date = 2008|isbn =9781412918688}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* a [[fields of science|field of science]] &amp;ndash; widely recognized category of specialized expertise within science, and typically embodies its own terminology and nomenclature. Such a field will usually be represented by one or more scientific journals, where peer reviewed research is published. There are many geography-related scientific journals.
** a [[natural science]] &amp;ndash; field of academic scholarship that explores aspects of natural environment (physical geography).
** a [[social science]] &amp;ndash; field of academic scholarship that explores aspects of human society (human geography).
* an [[interdisciplinary field]] &amp;ndash; a field that crosses traditional boundaries between academic disciplines or schools of thought, as new needs and professions have emerged. Many of the branches of physical geography are also branches of Earth science.

== Branches of geography ==

As "the bridge between the human and physical sciences," geography is divided into two main branches:
*human geography
*physical geography&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://web.clas.ufl.edu/users/morgans/lecture_2.prn.pdf|title = Geography: The Mother of Sciences|deadurl = yes|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20030901102227/http://web.clas.ufl.edu/users/morgans/lecture_2.prn.pdf|archivedate = 1 September 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/1b.html |title=Elements of Geography|last= Pidwirny|first= M.|date=2006|work = Fundamentals of Physical Geography|edition = 2nd |publisher=Physicalgeography.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other branches include:
*integrated geography
*geomatics
*regional geography

All the branches are further described below...

=== Physical geography ===

* [[Physical geography]] &amp;ndash; examines the natural environment and how the climate, vegetation &amp; life, soil, water, and landforms are produced and interact.&lt;ref name="AAG"/&gt;

==== Fields of physical geography ====

* [[Geomorphology]] &amp;ndash; study of landforms and the processes that them, and more broadly, of the processes controlling the topography of any planet. Seeks to understand why landscapes look the way they do, to understand landform history and dynamics, and to predict future changes through a combination of field observation, physical experiment, and numerical modeling.
* [[Hydrology]] &amp;ndash; study of the movement, distribution, and quality of water throughout the Earth, including the hydrologic cycle, water resources and environmental watershed sustainability.
** [[Glaciology]] &amp;ndash; study of glaciers, or more generally ice and natural phenomena that involve ice.
** [[Oceanography]] &amp;ndash; studies a wide range of topics pertaining to oceans, including marine organisms and ecosystem dynamics; ocean currents, waves, and geophysical fluid dynamics; plate tectonics and the geology of the sea floor; and fluxes of various chemical substances and physical properties within the ocean and across its boundaries.
* [[Biogeography]] &amp;ndash; study of the distribution of species spatially and temporally. Over areal [[ecology|ecological]] changes, it is also tied to the concepts of species and their past, or present living '[[refugium (population biology)|refugium]]', their survival locales, or their interim living sites. It aims to reveal where organisms live, and at what abundance.&lt;ref&gt;Martiny JBH et al. [http://alrlab.pdx.edu/media/HughesBiogeoNature.pdf Microbial biogeography: putting microorganisms on the map] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100621194350/http://alrlab.pdx.edu/media/HughesBiogeoNature.pdf |date=2010-06-21 }} ''Nature: FEBRUARY 2006 | VOLUME 4''&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Climatology]] &amp;ndash; study of [[climate]], scientifically defined as weather conditions averaged over a period of [[time]].&lt;ref&gt;Climate Prediction Center. [http://www.cpc.noaa.gov/products/outreach/glossary.shtml#C Climate Glossary.] Retrieved on 2006-11-23.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Meteorology]] is the interdisciplinary scientific study of the atmosphere that focuses on weather processes and short term forecasting (in contrast with climatology).
* [[Pedology (soil study)|Pedology]] &amp;ndash; study of soils in their natural environment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://natres.psu.ac.th/Link/SoilCongress/bdd/symp45/75-t.pdf | title = Soil Preservation and the Future of Pedology | author = Ronald Amundsen |accessdate = 2006-06-08|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; that deals with [[pedogenesis]], [[soil morphology]], and [[soil classification]].
* [[Palaeogeography]] &amp;ndash; study of what the geography was in times past, most often concerning the physical landscape, but also the human or cultural environment.
* [[Coastal geography]] &amp;ndash; study of the dynamic interface between the ocean and the land, incorporating both the physical geography (i.e. coastal geomorphology, geology and oceanography) and the human geography (sociology and history) of the coast. It involves an understanding of coastal weathering processes, particularly wave action, sediment movement and weather, and also the ways in which humans interact with the coast.
* [[Quaternary science]] &amp;ndash; focuses on the Quaternary period, which encompasses the last 2.6 million years, including the last ice age and the Holocene period.
* [[Landscape ecology]] &amp;ndash; the relationship between spatial patterns of urban development and ecological processes on a multitude of landscape scales and organizational levels.&lt;ref&gt;Wu, J. 2006. Cross-disciplinarity, landscape ecology, and sustainability science. Landscape Ecology 21:1-4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wu-2007"&gt;Wu, J. and R. Hobbs (Eds). 2007. Key Topics in Landscape Ecology.

==== Approaches of physical geography ====

* [[Quantitative geography]] &amp;ndash; [[Quantitative research]] tools and methods applied to geography. See also the [[quantitative revolution]].
* [[Systems approach]] &amp;ndash;

=== Human geography ===

* [[Human geography]] &amp;ndash; one of the two main subfields of geography, it is the study of human use and understanding of the world and the processes which have affected it. Human geography broadly differs from physical geography in that it focuses on the [[built environment]] and how space is created, viewed, and managed by humans as well as the influence humans have on the space they occupy.&lt;ref name="AAG"&gt;{{Cite web|title=What is geography? |work=AAG Career Guide: Jobs in Geography and related Geographical Sciences |publisher=Association of American Geographers |url=http://www.aag.org/Careers/What_is_geog.html |accessdate=October 9, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061006152742/http://www.aag.org/Careers/What_is_geog.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate=October 6, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Fields of human geography ====

* [[Cultural geography]] &amp;ndash; study of cultural products and norms and their variations across and relations to spaces and places. It focuses on describing and analyzing the ways language, religion, economy, government and other cultural phenomena vary or remain constant, from one place to another and on explaining how humans function spatially.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Jordan-Bychkov, Terry G. |author2=Domosh, Mona |author3=Rowntree, Lester | title=The human mosaic: a thematic introduction to cultural geography | year=1994 | publisher=HarperCollinsCollegePublishers | location=New York  | isbn=978-0-06-500731-2 | pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Children's geographies]] &amp;ndash; study of places and spaces of children's lives, characterized experientially, politically and ethically. Children's geographies rests on the idea that children as a social group share certain characteristics which are experientially, politically and ethically significant and which are worthy of study. The pluralisation in the title is intended to imply that children's lives will be markedly different in differing times and places and in differing circumstances such as gender, family, and class. The range of focii within children's geographies include:
*** Children and the city
*** Children and the countryside
*** Children and technology
*** Children and nature,
*** Children and globalization
*** Methodologies of researching children's worlds
*** Ethics of researching children's worlds
*** [[Otherness of childhood]]
** [[Animal geographies]] &amp;ndash; studies the spaces and places occupied by animals in human culture, because social life and space is heavily populated by animals of many differing kinds and in many differing ways (e.g. farm animals, pets, wild animals in the city). Another impetus that has influenced the development of the field are ecofeminist and other environmentalist viewpoints on nature-society relations (including questions of animal welfare and rights).
** [[Language geography]] &amp;ndash; studies the geographic distribution of language or its constituent elements. There are two principal fields of study within the geography of language:
**# Geography of languages &amp;ndash; deals with the distribution through history and space of languages,&lt;ref&gt;Delgado de Carvalho, C.M. (1962). ''The geography of languages.'' In Wagner, P.L.; Mikesell, M.W. ''Readings in cultural geography.'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 75-93.&lt;/ref&gt;
**# [[Linguistic geography]] &amp;ndash; deals with regional linguistic variations within languages.&lt;ref&gt;Pei, M. (1966). ''Glossary of linguistic terminology.'' New York: John Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Trudgill, P. (1974). ''Linguistic change and diffusion: description and explanation in sociolinguistic dialect geography.'' Language in Society 3:2, 215-46.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Trud3&gt;Trudgill, P. (1983). ''On dialect: social and geographical perspectives.''

** [[Sexuality and space]] &amp;ndash; encompasses all relationships and interactions between human sexuality, space, and place, including the geographies of LGBT residence, public sex environments, sites of queer resistance, global sexualities, sex tourism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/rtxg/2000/00000002/00000002/art00002|title=Constructing tourism landscapes - gender, sexuality and space|first1=Annette|last1=Pritchard|first2=Nigel J.|last2=Morgan|date=1 January 2000|journal=Tourism Geographies|volume=2|issue=2|pages=115–139|doi=10.1080/14616680050027851}}&lt;/ref&gt; the geographies of prostitution and adult entertainment, use of sexualised locations in the arts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wings.buffalo.edu/epc/authors/howe/syllabi/sexuality.html|title=Syllabus Poetics: Sexuality and Space in 17th - 19th Century American Literature, University at Buffalo|author=|date=|website=buffalo.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/0/1/4/9/2/p14928_index.html?phpsessid=43bac9979986e74e34d2496c52ebac62|title=Space and Modern (Homo)sexuality in Tsai Ming Liang's Films by Lyn Van Swol|author=|date=|website=allacademic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sexual citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pages.towson.edu/dherman/sexspace/sexhome.htm|title=Sexuality and Space, Course Syllabus Towson University|author=|date=|website=towson.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Religion geography]] &amp;ndash; study of the influence of geography, i.e. place and space, on religious belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Park|first=Chris|title=Routledge Companion to the Study of Religion|editor=Hinnells, J|publisher=Routledge|year=2004|chapter=Religion and geography}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Development geography]] &amp;ndash; study of the Earth's geography with reference to the standard of living and quality of life of its human inhabitants. Measures development by looking at economic, political and social factors, and seeks to understand both the geographical causes and consequences of varying development, in part by comparing More Economically Developed Countries (MEDCs) with Less Economically Developed Countries (LEDCs).
* [[Economic geography]] &amp;ndash; study of the location, distribution and spatial organization of economic activities across the world. Subjects of interest include but are not limited to the location of industries, economies of agglomeration (also known as "linkages"), transportation, international trade and development, real estate, gentrification, ethnic economies, gendered economies, core-periphery theory, the economics of urban form, the relationship between the environment and the economy (tying into a long history of geographers studying culture-environment interaction), and globalization.
** [[Marketing geography]] &amp;ndash; a discipline within marketing analysis which uses geolocation (geographic information) in the process of planning and implementation of marketing activities.&lt;ref name= "qr10"&gt;[http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~dq209/publications/recommending10quercia.pdf "Recommending Social Events from Mobile Phone Location Data"], Daniele Quercia, et al., ICDM 2010&lt;/ref&gt; It can be used in any aspect of the marketing mix – the product, price, promotion, or place (geo targeting).
** [[Transportation geography]] &amp;ndash; branch of economic geography that investigates spatial interactions between people, freight and information. It studies humans and their use of vehicles or other modes of traveling as well as how markets are serviced by flows of finished goods and raw materials.
* [[Health geography]] &amp;ndash; application of geographical information, perspectives, and methods to the study of health, disease, and health care, to provide a spatial understanding of a population's health, the distribution of disease in an area, and the environment's effect on health and disease. It also deals with accessibility to health care and spatial distribution of health care providers.
** [[Time geography]] &amp;ndash; study of the temporal factor on spatial human activities within the following constraints:
# Authority - limits of accessibility to certain places or domains placed on individuals by owners or authorities
# Capability - limitations on the movement of individuals, based on their nature. For example, movement is restricted by biological factors, such as the need for food, drink, and sleep
# Coupling - restraint of an individual, anchoring him or her to a location while interacting with other individuals in order to complete a task
* [[Historical geography]] &amp;ndash; study of the human, physical, fictional, theoretical, and "real" geographies of the past, and seeks to determine how cultural features of various societies across the planet emerged and evolved, by understanding how a place or region changes through time, including how people have interacted with their environment and created the cultural landscape.
* [[Political geography]] &amp;ndash; study of the spatially uneven outcomes of political processes and the ways in which political processes are themselves affected by spatial structures. Basically, the inter-relationships between people, state, and territory.
** [[Electoral geography]] &amp;ndash; study of the relationship between election results and the regions they affect (such as the environmental impact of voting decisions), and of the effects of regional factors upon voting behavior.
** [[Geopolitics]] &amp;ndash; analysis of geography, history and social science with reference to spatial politics and patterns at various scales, ranging from the level of the state to international.
** [[Strategic geography]] &amp;ndash; concerned with the control of, or access to, spatial areas that affect the security and prosperity of nations.
** [[Military geography]] &amp;ndash; the application of geographic tools, information, and techniques to solve military problems in peacetime or war.
* [[Population geography]] &amp;ndash; study of the ways in which spatial variations in the distribution, composition, migration, and growth of populations are related to the nature of places.
* [[Tourism geography]] &amp;ndash; study of travel and tourism, as an industry and as a social and cultural activity, and their effect on places, including the [[environmental impact of tourism]], the geographies of tourism and leisure economies, answering tourism industry and management concerns and the sociology of tourism and locations of tourism.
* [[Urban geography]] &amp;ndash; the study of urban areas, in terms of concentration, infrastructure, economy, and environmental impacts.

* [[Qualitative geography]] &amp;ndash; [[qualitative research]] tools and methods applied to geography.

=== Integrated geography ===

* [[Integrated geography]] &amp;ndash; branch of geography that describes the spatial aspects of interactions between humans and the natural world. It requires an understanding of the dynamics of geology, meteorology, hydrology, biogeography, ecology, and geomorphology, as well as the ways in which human societies conceptualize the environment.

=== Geomatics ===

* [[Geomatics]] &amp;ndash; branch of geography and the discipline of gathering, storing, processing, and delivering geographic information, or spatially referenced information. It is a widespread interdisciplinary field that includes the tools and techniques used in land surveying, remote sensing, cartography, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), Global Navigation Satellite Systems, photogrammetry, and related forms of earth mapping.

=== Regional geography ===

[[Regional geography]] &amp;ndash; study of world regions. Attention is paid to unique characteristics of a particular region such as its natural elements, human elements, and regionalization which covers the techniques of delineating space into regions. Regional geography breaks down into the study of specific regions.

[[Region]] &amp;ndash; an area, defined by physical characteristics, human characteristics, or functional characteristics. The term is used in various ways among the different branches of geography. A region can be seen as a collection of smaller units, such as a country and its political divisions, or as one part of a larger whole, as in a country on a continent.

==== Supercontinents ====

[[File:Pangea animation 03.gif|thumb|300px|Earth may have had a single supercontinent called "[[Pangaea]]"]]

[[List of supercontinents]]
A ''supercontinent'' is a [[landmass]] comprising more than one [[continent]]al core, or [[craton]].

*[[Afro-Eurasia]] ''(formed 5 million years ago)
*[[Americas]] ''(formed 15 million years ago)
*[[Eurasia]] ''(formed 60 million years ago)

==== Continents ====

[[Continent]] &amp;ndash; one of several large [[landmass]]es on [[Earth]]. They are generally identified by [[Convention (norm)|convention]] rather than any specific criteria, but seven areas are commonly regarded as continents. They are:

==== Natural geographic features ====

Natural geographic feature &amp;ndash; an ecosystem or natural landform.

===== Ecosystems =====

[[Ecosystem]] &amp;ndash; community of living organisms in conjunction with the nonliving components of their environment (things like air, water and mineral soil), interacting as a system. These biotic and abiotic components are regarded as linked together through nutrient cycles and energy flows. 
* {{Annotated link|Biodiversity hotspot}}
* [[Ecozone]] &amp;ndash; broadest biogeographic division of the Earth's land surface, based on distributional patterns of terrestrial organisms. 
** [[Ecoprovince]] &amp;ndash; biogeographic unit smaller than an ecozone that contains one or more ecoregions.

{{See also|List of landforms}}

[[Landform|Natural landform]] &amp;ndash; terrain or body of water. Landforms are topographical elements, and are defined by their surface form and location in the landscape. Landforms are categorized by traits such as elevation, slope, orientation, [[stratum|stratification]], rock exposure, and soil type. Some landforms are artificial, such as certain islands, but most landforms are natural.

==== Artificial geographic features ====
Artificial geographic feature &amp;ndash; a thing that was made by humans that may be indicated on a map. It may be physical and exist in the real world (like a bridge or city), or it may be abstract and exist only on maps (such as the Equator, which has a defined location, but cannot be seen where it lies).

* {{annotated link|Human settlement|Settlement}}
** {{annotated link|Hamlet (place)}} &amp;ndash; rural settlement which is too small to be considered a village. Historically, when a hamlet became large enough to justify building a church, it was then classified as a village. One example of a hamlet is a small cluster of houses surrounding a mill.
** {{annotated link|Village}} &amp;ndash; clustered human settlement or community, larger than a hamlet with the population ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand (sometimes tens of thousands).
** {{annotated link|Town}} &amp;ndash; human settlement larger than a village but smaller than a city. The size a settlement must be in order to be called a "town" varies considerably in different parts of the world, so that, for example, many American "small towns" seem to British people to be no more than villages, while many British "small towns" would qualify as cities in the United States.
*** {{annotated link|Urban hierarchy}} &amp;ndash; ranks the structure of towns within an area.
**** {{annotated link|1st-order towns}} &amp;ndash; bare minimum of essential services, such as bread and milk.
**** {{annotated link|2nd-order towns}}
**** {{annotated link|3rd-order towns}}
**** {{annotated link|4th-order towns}}
** {{annotated link|City}} &amp;ndash; relatively large and permanent settlement. In many regions, a city is distinguished from a town by attainment of designation according to law, for instance being required to obtain articles of incorporation or a royal charter.
*** {{annotated link|Financial centre}}
*** {{annotated link|Primate city}} &amp;ndash; the leading city in its country or region, disproportionately larger than any others in the urban hierarchy.
*** {{annotated link|Metropolis}} &amp;ndash; very large city or urban area which is a significant economic, political and cultural center for a country or region, and an important hub for regional or international connections and communications.
*** {{annotated link|Metropolitan area}} &amp;ndash; region consisting of a densely populated urban core and its less-populated surrounding territories, sharing industry, infrastructure, and housing.&lt;ref&gt;Squires, G. Ed. Urban Sprawl: Causes, Consequences, &amp; Policy Responses. The Urban Institute Press (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;
*** {{annotated link|Global city}} &amp;ndash; city that is deemed to be an important node in the global economic system. Globalization is largely created, facilitated and enacted in strategic geographic locales (including global cities) according to a hierarchy of importance to the operation of the global system of finance and trade.
*** {{annotated link|Megalopolis (city type)|Megalopolis}} &amp;ndash; chain of roughly adjacent metropolitan areas. An example is the huge metropolitan area along the eastern seaboard of the U.S. extending from Boston, Massachusetts through New York City; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Baltimore, Maryland and ending in Washington, D.C..
*** {{annotated link|Eperopolis}} &amp;ndash; theoretical "continent city". The world does not have one yet. Will Europe become the first one?
*** {{annotated link|Ecumenopolis}} &amp;ndash; theoretical "world city". Will the world ever become so urbanized as to be called this?
* Engineered construct &amp;ndash; built feature of the landscape such as a [[highway]], [[bridge]], [[airport]], [[railroad]], [[building]], [[dam]], or [[reservoir (water)|reservoir]]. See also [[construction engineering]] and [[infrastructure]].

== Persons influential in geography ==
{{Main|Geographer|List of geographers|List of Graeco-Roman geographers}}

A [[geographer]] is a [[scientist]] who studies [[Earth]]'s physical [[environment (biophysical)|environment]] and [[human]] [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]]. Geographers are historically known for making [[map]]s, the subdiscipline of geography known as [[cartography]]. They study the physical details of the environment and also its effect on human and [[wildlife]] [[ecology|ecologies]], [[weather]] and [[climate]] patterns, [[economics]], and [[culture]]. Geographers focus on the spatial relationships between these elements.

The term "Persianate" is a [[neologism]] credited to [[Marshall Hodgson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Lawrence|first1 = Bruce B.|date = 2009|chapter = Islam in Afro-Eurasia: A Bridge Civilization|editor = Peter J. Katzenstein|title = Civilizations in World Politics: Plural and Pluralist Perspectives|publisher = Routledge|pages = 157–175|ISBN=978-0-203-87248-2|quote="Persianate is a new term, first coined by Marshall Hodgson to offer a different explanation of Islam in the world system than that extrapolated from Wallerstein. While Persianate depicts a cultural force that is linked to Persian language and to self-identifiying Persians, Persianate is more than either a language or a people; it highlights elements that Persians share with Indo-Aryan rulers who preceded Muslims to the subcontinent. Two elements are paramount: ''hierarchy'' ... (and) ''deference''"}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1974 book, ''The Venture of Islam: The expansion of Islam in the Middle Periods'', he defined it thus: "The rise of Persian had more than purely literary consequences: it served to carry a new overall cultural orientation within Islamdom.... Most of the more local languages of high culture that later emerged among Muslims... depended upon Persian wholly or in part for their prime literary inspiration. We may call all these cultural traditions, carried in Persian or reflecting Persian inspiration, 'Persianate' by extension."&lt;ref name = Hodgson/&gt;{{rp|293–94}}&lt;ref group = notes&gt;Hodgson says, "It could even be said that Islamicate civilization, historically, is divisible in the more central areas into an earlier 'caliphal' and a later 'Persianate' phase; with variants in the outlying regions—Maghrib, Sudanic lands, Southern Seas, India,... (p. 294)"&lt;/ref&gt;

The term designates ethnic Persians but also societies that may not have been ethnically [[Iranian peoples|Persian or Iranian]] but whose linguistic, material or artistic cultural activities were influenced by or based on Persianate culture.

==History==
Persianate culture flourished for nearly fourteen centuries. It was a mixture of Persian and [[Islamic culture|Islamic]] cultures that eventually underwent [[Persification]] and became the dominant culture of the ruling and elite classes of [[Greater Iran]], [[Asia Minor]], and [[South Asia]].&lt;ref name="Canfield"&gt;{{cite book|first1 = Robert|last1 = Canfield|title = Turko-Persia in historical perspective|publisher = Cambridge University Press|date = 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the peoples of Greater Iran were invaded by [[Islamic conquest of Persia|Islamic forces]] in the 7th and 8th centuries, they became part of an empire much larger than any previous one under Persian rule.&lt;ref name="Canfield" /&gt; While the Islamic conquest led to the [[Arabization]] of language and culture in the former Byzantine territories, this did not happen in Persia. Rather, the new Islamic culture evolving there was largely based on pre-Islamic [[Ancient Persia|Persian traditions]] of the area,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|first = A. Shapur|last = Shahbazi|url = http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/ot_grp7/ot_sasanian_dyn_20050301.html|title = Sassanian Dynasty|encyclopedia = Encyclopaedia Iranica|edition = online|date = 2006|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100109191214/http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/ot_grp7/ot_sasanian_dyn_20050301.html|archivedate = 2010-01-09|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as on the [[Muslim culture|Islamic customs]] that were introduced to the region by the Arab invaders.&lt;ref name="Boyce"&gt;{{cite book|first1 = Mary|last1 = Boyce|author-link = M. Boyce|title = Bībī Shahrbānū and the Lady of Pārs|publisher = BSOAS|page = 30|date = 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Persianate culture, especially among the elite classes, spread across the Muslim territories in western, central, and south Asia, although populations across this vast region had conflicting allegiances (sectarian, local, tribal, and ethnic) and spoke many different languages. It was spread by poets, artists, architects, artisans, jurists, and scholars, who maintained relations among their peers in the far-flung cities of the Persianate world, from [[Anatolia]] to [[India]].&lt;ref name=Hodgson&gt;{{cite book|first1 = Marshall G. S.|last1 =  Hodgson|title-link = Marshall Hodgson|date = 1974|title = The Venture of Islam|location = Chicago|publisher = University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Persianate culture involved modes of consciousness, ethos, and religious practices that have persisted in the Iranian world against [[Hegemony|hegemonic]] Arab Muslim ([[Sunni]]) cultural constructs.&lt;ref name = euben/&gt;{{rp|23–32}} This formed a calcified Persianate structure of thought and experience of the sacred, entrenched for generations, which later informed history, historical memory, and identity among [[Shia Islam|Alid]] loyalists and [[Heterodoxy|heterodox]] groups labeled by [[sharia]]-minded authorities as ''[[Ghulat|ghulāt]]''. In a way, along with investing the notion of [[heteroglossia]], Persianate culture embodies the Iranian past and ways in which this past blended with the Islamic present or became transmuted. The historical change was largely on the basis of a binary model: a struggle between the religious landscapes of late Iranian antiquity and a monotheist paradigm provided by the new religion, Islam.&lt;ref name = euben/&gt;{{rp|38}}

This duality is symbolically expressed in the [[Shia Islam|Shiite]] tradition that [[Husayn ibn Ali]],  the third Shi'ite Imam, had married [[Shahrbanu]],&lt;ref name="Bibi Sahrbanu"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boyce|first=Mary|title=Bibi Sahrbanu|journal=Encyclopaedia Iranica|date=December 1989|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/bibi-sahrbanu|accessdate=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; daughter of [[Yazdegerd III]], the last [[Sasanian Empire|Sassanid]] king of [[Iran]]. This genealogy makes the later imams, descended from Husayn and Shahrbanu, the inheritors of both the Islamic Prophet Muhammad and of the pre-Islamic [[Sasanian Empire|Sassanid]] kings.

==Origins==
After the Arab Muslim conquest of Iran, [[Middle Persian|Pahlavi]], the language of [[Ancient Persia|Pre-Islamic Iran]], continued to be widely used well into the second Islamic century (8th century) as a medium of administration in the eastern lands of the [[Caliphate]].&lt;ref name="Canfield"/&gt; Despite the [[Islamization]] of public affairs, the Iranians retained much of their pre-Islamic outlook and way of life, adjusted to fit the demands of Islam. Towards the end of the 7th century, the population began resenting the cost of sustaining the Arab [[caliphs]], the [[Umayyads]],  and in the 8th century, a general Iranian uprising—led by [[Abu Muslim|Abu Muslim Khorrasani]]—brought another Arab family, the [[Abbasids]], to the Caliph's throne.

Under the Abbasids, the capital shifted from [[Syria]] to [[Iraq]], which had once been part of the [[Sassanid Empire]] and was still considered to be part of the Iranian cultural domain. Persian culture, and the customs of the Persian [[Barmakids|Barmakid]] [[vizier]]s, became the style of the ruling elite. Politically, the Abbasids soon started losing their control over Iranians. The governors of [[Greater Khorasan|Khurasan]], the  [[Tahirids]], though appointed by the caliph, were effectively independent. When the Persian [[Saffarids]] from [[Sistan]] freed the eastern lands, the [[Buyyids]], the [[Ziyarids]] and the [[Samanids]] in Western Iran, Mazandaran and the north-east respectively, declared their independence.&lt;ref name="Canfield" /&gt;

The separation of the eastern territories from [[Baghdad]] was expressed in a distinctive Persianate culture that became dominant in west, central, and south Asia, and was the source of innovations elsewhere in the Islamic world. The Persianate culture was marked by the use of the [[New Persian]] language as a medium of administration and intellectual discourse, by the rise of [[Persianization|Persianised-Turks]] to military control, by the new political importance of non-Arab [[ulama]] and by the development of an ethnically composite Islamic society.

[[Middle-Persian|Pahlavi]] was the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of the Sassanian Empire before the Arab invasion, but towards the end of the 7th and the beginning of the 8th century [[Arabic language|Arabic]] became a medium of literary expression. In the 9th century, a New Persian language emerged as the idiom of administration and literature. The Tahirid and Saffarid dynasties continued using Persian as an informal language, although for them Arabic was the "language for recording anything worthwhile, from poetry to science",&lt;ref name = frye&gt;{{cite book|author-link = Richard N. Frye|last = Frye|first = R.N.|date = 1975|title = The Golden Age of Persia: ''The Arabs in the East''|location = London and New York|publisher = Weidenfeld and Nicolson}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the Samanids made Persian a language of learning and formal discourse. The language that appeared in the 9th and 10th centuries was a new form of Persian, derivative of{{Clarify|date=February 2009}} the Middle-Persian of pre-Islamic times, but enriched amply by Arabic vocabulary and written in the Arabic script.

The Persian language, according&lt;ref name="Marshall G. S 1974 page 293"&gt;{{cite book|first1 = Marshall G. S.|last1 = Hodgson|title = The Venture of Islam|volume = 2|chapter = The Expansion of Islam in the Middle Periods|location = Chicago, USA|date = 1974|page = 293}}&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Marshall Hodgson]] in his ''[[The Venture of Islam]]'', was to form the chief model for the rise of still other languages to the literary level. Like [[Turkish language|Turkish]], most of the more local languages of high culture that later emerged among Muslims depended upon Persian ([[Urdu language|Urdu]] being a prime example). One may call these traditions, carried in Persian or reflecting Persian inspiration, ‘Persianate’ by extension. This seems&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author-link = Said Amir Arjomand|first1 = Said Amir |last1 = Arjomand|url = http://brill.publisher.ingentaconnect.com/content/brill/jps|title = From the Editor: Defining Persianate Studies|journal = Journal of Persianate Studies 1|date = 2008|volume = 1|issue = 4|page = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; to be the origin of the term ''Persianate''.

==Spread==
The Iranian dynasty of the Samanids began recording its court affairs in Persian as well as Arabic, and the earliest great poetry in New Persian was written for the Samanid court. The Samanids encouraged translation of religious works from Arabic into Persian. In addition, the learned authorities of Islam, the ''ulama'', began using the Persian ''lingua franca'' in public. The crowning literary achievement in the early New Persian language was the ''[[Shahnameh]]'' (Book of Kings), presented by its author [[Ferdowsi]] to the court of [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] (998–1030). This was a kind of Iranian nationalistic resurrection: Ferdowsi galvanized Persian nationalistic sentiment by invoking pre-Islamic Persian heroic imagery and enshrined in literary form the most treasured folk stories.&lt;ref name="Canfield" /&gt;

Ferdowsi's ''Shahnameh'' enjoyed a special status in Iranian courtly culture as a historical narrative as well as a mythical one. The powerful effect that this text came to have on the poets of this period is partly due to the value that was attached to it as a legitimizing force, especially for new rulers in the Eastern Islamic world:

{{quote|In the Persianate tradition the ''Shahnameh'' was viewed as more than literature. It was also a political treatise, as it addressed deeply rooted conceptions of honor, morality, and legitimacy. Illustrated versions of it were considered desirable as expressions of the aspirations and politics of ruling elites in the Iranian world.|&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Lentz|first1 = T.

D.|title = Timur and the Princely Vision: Persian Art and Culture in the Fifteenth Century|location = Washington, DC, USA|publisher = Smithsonian Press|date = 1989|page = 126}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Persianate culture that emerged under the Samanids in [[Khurasan|Khorasan]], in northeast Persia and the borderlands of [[Turkestan|Turkistan]] exposed the Turks to Persianate culture;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Chambers|first1 = R. L.|title = The Ottoman Empire; a Chronological Outline|publisher = University of Chicago|date = 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incorporation of the Turks into the main body of the Middle Eastern Islamic civilization, which was followed by the [[Ghaznavids]], thus began in Khorasan; "not only did the inhabitants of Khurasan not succumb to the language of the nomadic invaders, but they imposed their own tongue on them. The region could even assimilate the Turkic Ghaznavids and [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuks]] (11th and 12th centuries), the [[Timurid dynasty|Timurids]] (14th and 15th centuries), and the [[Qajar dynasty|Qajars]] (19th and 20th centuries).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Daftary|first1 = F.|chapter = Sectarian and National Movements in Iran, Khorasan, and Trasoxania during Umayyad and Early Abbasid Times|title = History of Civilizations of Central Asia|volume = 4-1|editor1 = M.S. Asimov|editor2 =  C.E. Bosworth|publisher = UNESCO Publishing, Institute of Ismaili Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ghaznavids, the rivals and future successors of the Samanids,{{Clarify|date=February 2009}} ruled over the southeastern extremities of Samanid territories from the city of [[Ghazni]]. Persian scholars and artists flocked to their court, and the Ghaznavids became patrons of Persianate culture. The Ghaznavids took with them Persianate culture as they subjugated Western and Southern Asia . Apart from Ferdowsi, [[Rumi]], [[Avicenna|Abu Ali Sina]], [[Al-Biruni]], [[Unsuri]] Balkhi, [[Farrukhi Sistani]], [[Sanaayi|Sanayi Ghaznawi]] and Abu Sahl Testari were among the great Iranian scientists and poets of the period under Ghaznavid patronage.

Persianate culture was carried by successive dynasties into Western and Southern Asia, particularly by the Persianized [[Seljuqs]] (1040–1118) and their successor states, who presided over [[Iran]], [[Syria]], and [[Anatolia]] until the 13th century, and by the Ghaznavids, who in the same period dominated Greater Khorasan and parts of [[India]]. These two dynasties together drew the centers of the Islamic world eastward. The institutions stabilized Islamic society into a form that would persist, at least in [[Western Asia]], until the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Canfield" /&gt;

The Ghaznavids moved their capital from Ghazni to [[Lahore]] in modern [[Pakistan]], which they turned into another center of Islamic culture. Under their patronage, poets and scholars from [[Kashgar]], [[Bukhara]], [[Samarkand]], [[Baghdad]], [[Nishapur]], [[Amol]] and Ghazni congregated in Lahore. Thus, the Persian language and Persianate culture was brought deep into India&lt;ref name="Ikram"&gt;{{cite book|last1 = [[S. M. Ikram|Ikram]]|first1 = S. M|date = 1964|title = Muslim Civilization in India|location = New York, USA |publisher = Columbia University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; and carried further in the 13th century. The Seljuqs won a decisive victory over the Ghaznavids and swept into Khorasan; they brought Persianate culture westward into western Persia, Iraq, Anatolia, and Syria. Iran proper along with [[Central Asia]] became the heartland of Persian language and culture.

As the Seljuqs came to dominate western Asia, their courts were Persianized as far west as the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. Under their rule, many pre-Islamic Iranian traditional arts like Sassanid architecture were resurrected, and great Iranian scholars were patronized.{{Clarify|date=February 2009}} At the same time, the Islamic religious institutions became more organized and [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] orthodoxy became more codified.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

The Persian jurist and theologian [[Al-Ghazali]] was among the scholars at the Seljuq court who proposed a synthesis of [[Sufism]] and [[Sharia]], which became the basis for a richer Islamic theology. Formulating the Sunni concept of division between temporal and religious authorities, he provided a theological basis for the existence of the [[Sultanate]], a temporal office alongside the [[Caliphate]], which at that time was merely a religious office. The main institutional means of establishing a consensus of the ''ulama'' on these dogmatic issues was the [[Nezamiyeh]], better known as the ''[[madrasas]]'', named after its founder [[Nizam al-Mulk|Khwajeh Nizam al-Mulk]], a Persian vizier of the Seljuqs. These schools became the means of uniting Sunni ''ulama'', who legitimized the rule of the Sultans. The bureaucracies were staffed by graduates of the madrasas, so both the ''ulama'' and the bureaucracies were under the influence of esteemed professors at the ''madrasas''.&lt;ref name=Canfield /&gt;{{rp|14}}&lt;ref name=frye /&gt;{{rp|224–30}}

===Shahnameh's impact and affirmation of Persianate culture===
&lt;!-- The paragraph below does not make sense. --&gt;
As the result of the impacts of Persian literature as well as to further political ambitions, it became a custom for rulers in the Persianate lands to not only commission a copy of the ''Shahnameh'', but also to have his own epic, allowing court poets to attempt to reach the level of Ferdowsi:

{{quote|Thus, as with any piece of historical writing, the ''Shahnameh'' can be evaluated as a historical source on two levels: firstly, for its contribution to the store of basic factual knowledge of a period, and secondly, for the light it sheds, intentionally or otherwise, on contemporary thought and politics.|&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Woodhead|first1 = C.|title = An Experiment in Official Historiography: The Post of Sehnameci in the Ottoman Empire, c. 1555–1605|journal = Wiener Zeitschrift für die Kunde des Morgenlandes|volume = 75| date = 1983|page = 174}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Iranian and Persianate poets received the ''Shahnameh'' and modeled themselves after it. Murtazavi formulates three categories of such works too: poets who took up material not covered in the epic, poets who eulogized their patrons and their ancestors in ''[[Masnavi (poetic form)|masnavi]]'' form for monetary reward, and poets who wrote poems for rulers who saw themselves as heroes in the ''Shahnameh'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1 = Manuchihr |last1 = Murtazavi|chapter = Muqallidan-i Shahnamah dar dawrah-yi Mughul va Timuri|title=Masa'il-i 'asr-i Ilkhanan|location = Tabriz|publisher =  Mu'assasah-i Tarikh va Farhang-i Iran, SH/1358|pages = 554–555}}&lt;/ref&gt; echoing the earlier [[Samanid Empire|Samanid]] trend of patronizing the Shahnameh for legitimizing texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1 = Julie S.|last1 = Meisami|title = Persian Historiography to the End of the Twelfth Century|location = Edinburgh, UK|publisher = Edinburgh University Press|date = 1999|page = 37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First, Persian poets attempted to continue the chronology to a later period, such as the ''[[Zafarnamah (Mustawfi)|Zafar-Namah]]'' of the [[Ilkhanate|Ilkhanid]] historian [[Hamdollah Mostowfi]] (d. 1334 or 1335), which deals with Iranian history from the Arab conquest to the Mongols and is longer than Ferdowsi's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = ''Zafarnamah-i Hamd Allah Mustawfi'': bi-inzimam-i Shahnamah-i Abu al-Qasim Firdawsi (bih tashih-i Hamd Allah Mustawfi)|chapter = aksi az ru-yi nuskhah-i khatti-i muvarrakh-i AH/807, dar Kitabkhanah-i Biritaniya (Or. 2833)|location = Tehran, Iran|publisher = Markaz-i Nashr-i Danishgahi-i Iran; Vin: Akadimi-i ‘Ulum-i Utrish|date = 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; The literary value of these works must be considered on an individual basis as Rypka cautions: "all these numerous epics cannot be assessed very highly, to say nothing of those works that were substantially (or literally) copies of Ferdowsi. There are however exceptions, such as the ''Zafar-Nameh'' of Hamdu'llah Mustaufi a historically valuable continuation of the Shah-nama"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author = Rypka|title = History of Iranian Literature|page = 165}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Shahanshahnamah'' (or ''Changiznamah'') of Ahmad Tabrizi in 1337–38, which is a history of the Mongols written for Abu Sa'id.

Second, poets versified the history of a contemporary ruler for reward, such as the ''Ghazannameh'' written in 1361–62 by Nur al-Din ibn Shams al-Din. Third, heroes not treated in the ''Shahnameh'' and those having minor roles in it became the subjects of their own epics, such as the 11th-century ''Garshāspnāmeh'' by [[Asadi Tusi]]. This tradition, chiefly a [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] one, resulted in the creation of Islamic epics of conquests as discussed by Marjan Molé.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1 = Marjan |last1 = Molé|title = L'épopée iranienne après Firdosi|publisher = La Nouvelle Clio 5|date = 1953|pages = 377–393}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also see the classification employed by Z. Safa for epics: ''milli'' (national, those inspired by Ferdowsi's epic), ''tarikhi'' (historical, those written in imitation of Nizami's Iskandarnamah) and ''dini'' for religious works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1 = Z. |last1 = Safa|title = Hamasahsarayi dar Iran|location = Tehran, Iran|publisher = Amir Kabir|date = 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other source of inspiration for Persianate culture was another Persian poet, [[Nizami Ganjavi|Nizami]], a most admired, illustrated and imitated writer of romantic ''masnavis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Quint|first = D.|title = Epic and Empire: Politics and Generic Form from Virgil to Milton|location = Princeton|publisher = Princeton University Press|date = 1993|page = 15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with Ferdowsi's and Nizami's works, [[Amir Khusraw Dehlavi]]'s ''[[khamseh]]'' came to enjoy tremendous prestige, and multiple copies of it were produced at Persianized courts. Seyller has a useful catalog of all known copies of this text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1 = John |last1 = Seyller|title = Pearls of the Parrot of India: The Walters Art Museum Khamsa of Amir Khusraw of Delhi|location = Baltimore, USA|publisher =  Walters Art Museum|date = 2001|pages = 143–58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mongol invasion==
The culture of the Persianate world in the 13th, 14th, and 15th centuries inadvertently benefited by the invading hordes of Asia. The [[Mongols]] under [[Genghis Khan]] (1220–58) and [[Timur]] (''Tamerlane'', 1336–1405) stimulated the development of Persianate culture in Central and West Asia, because of the new concentrations of specialists of high culture created by the invasions. Many Iranians sought refuge in a few safe havens, particularly India, where scholars, poets, musicians, and fine artisans intermingled; because of the broad peace secured by the imperial systems established by the [[Ilkhanate|Ilkhanids]] and [[Timurids]], scholars and artists, ideas and skills, and fine books and artifacts circulated freely over a wide area. The Ilkhanids and Timurids were patrons of Persianate high culture. Under their rule new styles of architecture based on pre-Islamic Iranian traditions were developed, Persian literature was encouraged and schools of [[Persian miniature|miniature painting]] and book production were established at [[Herat]], [[Tabriz]] and [[Isfahan|Esfahan]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

In the 16th century, Persianate culture became sharply distinct from the Arab world to the west, the dividing zone falling along the [[Euphrates]]. Socially the Persianate world was marked by a system of ethnologically defined elite statuses: the rulers and their soldiery were non-Iranians in origin, but the administrative cadres and literati were Iranians. Cultural affairs were marked by a characteristic pattern of language use: [[Persian Language|New Persian]] was the language of state affairs, scholarship and literature and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] the language of religion.&lt;ref name="Ikram"/&gt;

==Safavids and the resurrection of Iranianhood in West Asia==

They re-asserted the Persian identity over many parts of West Asia and Central Asia, establishing an independent Persian state,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1 = R.M.|last1 = Savory|title = Iran under the Safavids|publisher = Cambridge University Press|location = Cambridge, UK|date = 1980|page = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and patronizing Persian culture &lt;ref name="Canfield"/&gt;  They made Iran the spiritual bastion of [[Shia Islam|Shi’ism]] against the onslaughts of orthodox [[Sunni Islam]], and a repository of Persian cultural traditions and self-awareness of Persian identity.&lt;ref name = Hillenbrand&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Hillenbrand|first1 = R.|title = Islamic art and Architecture|location = London, UK|date = 1999|ISBN = 0-500-20305-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|228}}

The founder of the dynasty, [[Ismail I|Shah Isma'il]], adopted the title of Persian Emperor ''Pādišah-ī Īrān'', with its implicit notion of an Iranian state stretching from Afghanistan as far as the Euphrates and the North Caucasus, and from the Oxus to the southern territories of the Persian Gulf.&lt;ref name = Hillenbrand/&gt;{{rp|228}}  Shah Isma'il's successors went further and adopted the title of ''[[Shahanshah|Shāhanshāh]]'' (king of kings).

{{quote|The rise of Persian (the language) had more than purely literary consequence: it served to carry a new overall cultural orientation within Islamdom. Henceforth while Arabic held its own as the primary language of the religious disciplines and even, largely, of natural science and philosophy, Persian became, in an increasingly part of Islamdom, the language of polite culture; it even invaded the realm of scholarship with increasing effects. It was to form the chief model of the rise of still other languages. Gradually a third "classical" tongue emerged, Turkish, whose literature was based on Persian tradition.|&lt;ref name="Marshall G. S 1974 page 293" /&gt;}}

Toynbee's assessment of the role of the Persian language is worth quoting in more detail, from ''[[A Study of History]]'':

{{quote|In the Iranian world, before it began to succumb to the process of Westernization, the New Persian language, which had been fashioned into literary form in mighty works of art...gained a currency as a lingua franca; and at its widest, about the turn of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries of the Christian Era, its range in this role extended, without a break, across the face of South-Eastern Europe and South-Western Asia from the Ottoman pashalyq of Buda, which had been erected out of the wreckage of the Western Christian Kingdom of Hungary after the Ottoman victory at Mohacz in A.D. 1526, to the Muslim "successor-states" which had been carved, after the victory of the Deccanese Muslim princes at Talikota in A.D. 1565, out of the carcass of the slaughtered Hindu Empire of Vijayanagar. For this vast cultural empire the New Persian language was indebted to the arms of Turkish-speaking empire-builders, reared in the Iranian tradition and therefore captivated by the spell of the New Persian literature, whose military and political destiny it had been to provide one universal state for Orthodox Christendom in the shape of the Ottoman Empire and another for the Hindu World in the shape of the Timurid Mughal Raj. These two universal states of Iranian construction on Orthodox Christian and on Hindu ground were duly annexed, in accordance with their builders' own cultural affinities, to the original domain of the New Persian language in the homelands of the Iranian Civilization on the Iranian plateau and in the Basin of the Oxus and the Jaxartes; and in the heyday of the Mughal, Safawi, and Ottoman regimes New Persian was being patronized as the language of ''[[Belles-lettres|literae humaniores]]'' by the ruling element over the whole of this huge realm, while it was also being employed as the official language of administration in those two-thirds of its realm that lay within the Safawi and the Mughal frontiers.|&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Arnold J.|last1=Toynbee|title=A Study of History|volume=V|pages=514–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

E. J. W. Gibb is the author of the standard ''A Literary History of Ottoman Poetry'' in six volumes, whose name has lived on in an important series of publications of Arabic, Persian, and Turkish texts, the [[Gibb Memorial Series]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} Gibb classifies Ottoman poetry between the "Old School", from the 14th century to about the middle of the 19th century, during which time Persian influence was dominant; and the "Modern School", which came into being as a result of the Western impact. According to Gibb in the introduction (Volume I):

{{quote|the Turks very early appropriated the entire Persian literary system down to its minute detail, and that in the same unquestioning and wholehearted fashion in which they had already accepted Islam.}}

The Saljuqs had, in the words of the same author:

{{quote|attained a very considerable degree of culture, thanks entirely to Persian tutorage. About the middle of the eleventh century they [that is, the Saljuqs] had overrun Persia, when, as so often happened, the Barbarian conquerors adopted the culture of their civilized subjects. Rapidly the Seljuq Turks pushed their conquest westward, ever carrying with them Persian culture...[s]o, when some hundred and fifty years later Sulayman's son [the leader of the Ottomans]... penetrated into Asia Minor, they [the Ottomans] found that although Seljuq Turkish was the everyday speech of the people, Persian was the language of the court, while Persian literature and Persian culture reigned supreme. It is to the Seljuqs with whom they were thus fused, that the Ottomans, strictly so called, owe their literary education; this therefore was of necessity Persian as the Seljuqs knew no other. The Turks were not content with learning from the Persians how to express thought; they went to them to learn what to think and in what way to think. In practical matters, in the affairs of everyday life and in the business of government, they preferred their own ideas; but in the sphere of science and literature they went to school with the Persian, intent not merely on acquiring his method, but on entering into his spirit, thinking his thought and feeling his feelings. And in this school they continued so long as there was a master to teach them; for the step thus taken at the outset developed into a practice; it became the rule with the Turkish poets to look ever Persia-ward for guidance and to follow whatever fashion might prevail there. Thus it comes about that for centuries Ottoman poetry continued to reflect as in a glass the several phases through which that of Persia passed...[s]o the first Ottoman poets, and their successors through many a generation, strove with all their strength to write what is little else than Persian poetry in Turkish words. But such was not consciously their aim; of national feeling in poetry they dreamed not; poetry was to them one and indivisible, the language in which it was written merely an unimportant accident.}}

==Persianate culture of South Asia==
{{Main|Indo-Persian culture}}
In general, from its earliest days, Persian culture was brought into the Subcontinent (or South Asia) by various Persianised [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] and [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] dynasties.&lt;ref&gt;Sigfried J. de Laet. [https://books.google.nl/books?id=PvlthkbFU1UC&amp;pg=PA734&amp;dq=persian+language+in+anatolia&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAWoVChMIs-fO2_aRxgIVygYsCh2NJgBM#v=onepage&amp;q=persian%20language%20in%20anatolia&amp;f=false ''History of Humanity: From the seventh to the sixteenth century''] UNESCO, 1994. {{ISBN|978-9231028137}} p 734&lt;/ref&gt; South Asian society was enriched by the influx of Persian-speaking and Islamic scholars, historians, architects, musicians, and other specialists of high Persianate culture who fled the Mongol devastation. [[Delhi Sultanate|The sultans of Delhi]], who were of Turko-Afghan origin, modeled their lifestyles after the Persian upper classes. They patronized Persian literature and music, but became especially notable for their architecture, because their builders drew from Irano-Islamic architecture, combining it with Indian traditions to produce a profusion of [[mosques]], palaces, and tombs unmatched in any other Islamic country.&lt;ref name="Ikram"/&gt; The speculative thought of the times at the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] court, as in other Persianate courts, leaned towards the eclectic [[Gnosticism|gnostic]] dimension of Sufi Islam, having similarities with Hindu [[Vedanta|Vedantism]], indigenous [[Bhakti]] and popular [[Theosophy (Boehmian)|theosophy]].&lt;ref name=rizvi&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Rizvi|first1 = S.|title = Muslim Revivalist Movements in Northern India in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries|location = New Delhi, India|date = 1993|chapter = Chapter 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]], who were of [[Turco-Mongol]] descent, strengthened the [[Indo-Persian culture]], in South Asia. For centuries, Iranian scholar-officials had immigrated to the region where their expertise in Persianate culture and administration secured them honored service within the Mughal Empire.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}&lt;ref name = fisher&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Fisher|first1 = M.

Furthermore, educational institutions such as [[Farangi Mahall]] and [[Zakir Husain College|Delhi College]] developed innovative and integrated curricula for modernizing Persian-speaking South Asians.&lt;ref name = fisher/&gt;{{rp|33}} They cultivated Persian art, enticing to their courts artists and architects from Bukhara, [[Tabriz]], [[Herat]], [[Shiraz]], and other cities of Greater Iran. The [[Taj Mahal]] and its [[Charbagh]] were commissioned by the Mughal emperor [[Shah Jahan]] for his Iranian bride.

Iranian poets, such as [[Saadi (poet)|Sa’di]], [[Hafez]], [[Rumi]] and [[Nizami Ganjavi|Nizami]], who were great masters of Sufi mysticism from the Persianate world, were the favorite poets of the Mughals.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} Their works were present in Mughal libraries and counted among the emperors’ prized possessions, which they gave to each other; [[Akbar the Great|Akbar]] and [[Jahangir]] often quoted from them, signifying that they had imbibed them to a great extent.  An autographed note of both Jahangir and Shah Jahan on a copy of Sa’di’s ''Gulestān'' states that it was their most precious possession.&lt;ref name = soudavar&gt;{{cite book|author = Soudavar|title = Art of the Persian Courts}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|101, cat. no. 36 a.c}} A gift of a ''Gulestān'' was made by Shah Jahan to [[Jahanara Begum]], an incident which is recorded by her with her signature.&lt;ref name = soudavar/&gt;{{rp|332.38, Cat. no. 136a.f}} Shah Jahan also considered the same work worthy enough to be sent as a gift to the king of England in 1628, which is presently in the [[Chester Beatty Library]], Dublin. The emperor often took out auguries from a copy of the ''diwan'' of [[Hafez]] belonging to his grandfather, [[Humayun]]. One such incident is recorded in his own handwriting in the margins of a copy of the ''diwan'', presently in the [[Khuda Bakhsh Oriental Library|Khuda Bakhsh Oriental Library, Patna]].&lt;ref&gt;Prince Khurram's (Shahjahan) own specimen of calligraphic verses of Hafiz is in the [[Rampur Raza Library]], Rampur (hereafter RL) (Siddiqi, Rampur Raza Library: pl. 24).&lt;/ref&gt; The court poets [[Naziri]], [[‘Urfi]], [[Faizi]], [[Khan-i Khanan]], [[Zuhuri]], [[Sanai]], [[Qodsi]], [[Taleb Amoli|Talib-i Amuli]] and [[Abu Talib Kalim]] were all masters imbued with a similar Sufi spirit, thus following the norms of any Persianate court.&lt;ref group = notes&gt;For the influence of Rumi's poetry on contemporary poetics, see Schimmel, The Triumphal Sun: 374.78; for Mughal poetry, see Ghani, A History of Persian Language and Literature; Rahman, Persian Literature; Hasan, Mughal Poetry; Abidi, .Tālib-I Āmulī; idem, .Qudsi Mashhadi.; Nabi Hadi, Talib-i Amuli; Browne, A Literary History, vol. IV: 241.67.&lt;/ref&gt;

The tendency towards Sufi mysticism through Persianate culture in Mughal court circles is also testified by the inventory of books that were kept in Akbar’s library, and are especially mentioned by his historian, [[Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak|Abu'l Fazl]], in the ''Ā’in-ī Akbarī''. Some of the books that were read out continually to the emperor include the ''[[Masnavi (poetic form)|masnavis]]'' of Nizami, the works of [[Amir Khusrow]], Sharaf Manayri and Jami, the ''[[Masnavi|Masnavi i-manavi]]'' of Rumi, the ''Jām-i Jam'' of [[Awhadi Maraghai]], the ''Hakika o Sanā’i'', the ''[[Qabus nama|Qabusnameh]]'' of [[Keikavus]], Sa’di’s ''Gulestān'' and ''Būstān'', and the ''diwans'' of [[Khaqani]] and [[Anvari]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Browne |first1 = E.G.|title = A Literary History of Persia|volume = II and III|location = Cambridge|date = 1951}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Arberry|first1 = A.J.|title = Classical Persian Literature|location = London|date = 1958}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This intellectual symmetry continued until the end of the 19th century, when a Persian newspaper, ''Miftah al-Zafar'' (1897), campaigned for the formation of Anjuman-i Ma’arif, an academy devoted to the strengthening of Persian language as a scientific language.&lt;ref name = rizvi/&gt;

===Persian poetry (Sufi poetry)===
{{Expand section|date=January 2007}}
[[File:Jami Rose Garden.jpg|right|thumb|Illustration from Jami's ''Rose Garden of the Pious'', dated 1553. The image blends Persian poetry and [[Persian miniature]] into one, as is the norm for many works of Persian literature.]]

From about the 12th century, Persian lyric poetry was enriched with a spirituality and devotional depth not to be found in earlier works. This development was due to the pervasive spread of mystical experience. [[Sufism]] developed in all Muslim lands, but its literary expression reached its zenith in the countries located within the sphere of Persian cultural influence. As a counterpoise to the rigidity of formal Islamic [[theology]] and law, mysticism sought to approach the divine through acts of devotion and love rather than through mere rituals and observance. Love of [[God]] being the focus of the Sufis' religious sentiments, it was only natural for them to express it in lyrical terms, and Persian mystics, often of exceptional sensibility and endowed with poetic verve, did not hesitate to do so. The famous 11th-century Sufi, [[Abū-Sa'īd Abul-Khayr|Abu Sa'id]] of Mehna frequently used his own love [[quatrains]] (as well as others) to express his spiritual yearnings, and with mystic poets such as [[Farid al-Din Attar|Attar]] and [[Fakhr-al-Din Iraqi|Iraqi]], mysticism became a legitimate, even fashionable subject of lyric poems among the Persianate societies. Furthermore, as Sufi orders and centers (''Khaneghah'') spread throughout Persian societies, Persian mystic poetic thought gradually became so much a part of common culture that even poets who did not share Sufi experiences ventured to express mystical ideas and imagery in their work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website = Iransaga|title = The Development of Persian Poetry|url = http://www.art-arena.com/devpoet.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost every Persian artwork was accompanied by texts. In the late 14th and 15th centuries, political control in Iran passed to the [[Timurid dynasty|Timurids]], who moved the capital from [[Tabriz]] in the west to [[Samarkand]] and [[Herat]] in the east. In the first half of the 15th century, Iranian artists working for the Timurid sultans developed the highly detailed, jewel-like style of painting that signifies Persian painting, which became known as the "Persian School of Herat".{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

When the [[Safavid dynasty|Safavids]] came to power in 1501 and unified the eastern and western parts of Iran, the eastern and western Persian painting styles were mingled. The political unity under the first two Safavid rulers [[Ismail I]] and [[Tahmasp I]], and the establishment of the Safavid capital at Tabriz in the west, led Persian artists to leave Herat. One of the most celebrated Iranian painters, [[Kamāl ud-Dīn Behzād|Behzad]], known as "the master of Persian painting", influenced many other Persian painters, including [[Reza Abbasi]] and Sultan Muhammad. He eventually painted perhaps the most extraordinary example of Persian painting ''The Court of the Gayumars'' from an opulent edition of the Shahnameh, commissioned by Shah Tahmasp c. 1522–1525. The painting depicts the legendary court of [[Keyumars|Gayumars]], the first shah in the epic.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

In Anatolia, a flourishing school of painting developed at the courts of Turkic rulers in the second half of the 15th century. The style of [[Ottoman miniature]] illustrations was derived from the Persian models, especially the painting of Shiraz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter = Persianate Sources on Anatolia and the Early History of the Ottomans|title = Studies on Persianate Societies|volume= 2|date = 2004|pages = 126–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; The long reign of the Ottoman sultan [[Suleyman the Magnificent|Suleyman]] enabled his successor [[Selim II|Selim]] (r. 1566–1574) to enjoy the pleasures of the palace without much concern for military conquests. A painting of Sultan Selim II in the exhibition depicts him partaking in one of his favorite pastimes, drinking, which earned him the nickname "Selim the Sot".{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

By the mid-16th century, some Iranian artists from the Safavid Persian court had immigrated to Istanbul. Others had made their way to India in the retinue of the Mughal emperor [[Humayun]], who returned to India in 1555 from exile in Iran. It was at the court of Humayun's son and successor [[Akbar]] (r. 1556–1605), however, that the [[Mughal painting|Mughal style of painting]] came into its own.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

The most important early project in this new style was the 14-volume ''[[Hamzanama]]'' produced by a team of Indian artists, both Muslim and Hindu, working under the supervision of [[Mir Sayyid Ali]] and [[Abd al-Samad]], two Persian [[émigré]] artists. Akbari paintings incorporated the precise, linear style of Persian painting with the dynamism and vibrant palette of indigenous Indian painting. With the introduction of European-style perspective and modelling, Mughal painting became increasingly naturalistic from the 1580s until the mid-17th century, but the core of both Ottoman and Mughal painting remained Persian.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

The term ''[[nowruz]]'' first appeared in Persian records in the 2nd century CE, but it was also an important day during [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] times (c. 648–330 BCE), on which kings from different nations under Persian rule would present gifts to the emperor (''Shahanshah'') of Persia[5]. It has been suggested that the famous [[Persepolis]] complex, or at least the palace of [[Apadana]] and the "Hundred Columns Hall", were built for the specific purpose of celebrating Nowruz. However, no mention of Nowruz exists in Achaemenid inscriptions (see picture).&lt;!--  What picture? --&gt;{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} Later it became the national holiday of the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian empire]], which ruled western Iran (c. 247 BCE – 224 CE). There are specific references to the celebration of Nowruz during the reign of [[Vologases I of Parthia|Vologases I]] (51–78 CE), but these include no details.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

Extensive records on the celebration of Nowruz appear following the accession of [[Ardashir I]] of Persia, the founder of the Sassanid dynasty (224–650 CE). Under the Sassanid kings, Nowruz was celebrated as the most important day of the year. Most royal traditions of Nowruz, such as audiences with the public, cash gifts, and the pardoning of prisoners, were established during the Sassanid era, and they persisted unchanged until modern times.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

Nowruz, along with [[Sadeh]] (celebrated in mid-winter), survived in society following the introduction of Islam in 650 CE. Other celebrations such as [[Gahanbar]] and [[Mehregan]] were eventually side-lined or were only continued by the [[Zoroastrians in Iran|Zoroastrians]], who carried them as far as Turkey. Nowruz, however, was honored even by the early founders of Islam. There are records of the [[Caliphate#History|Rashidun caliphs]] presiding over Nowruz celebrations and it was adopted as the main royal holiday during the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] period.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

Following the demise of the caliphate and the subsequent re-emergence of Persian dynasties such as the [[Samanid dynasty|Samanids]] and [[Buyid dynasty|Buyyids]], Nowruz was elevated to an even higher status. The Buyids revived the Sassanid traditions and restored many smaller celebrations that had been eliminated by the caliphate. Even the Turkish and Mongol invaders did not attempt to abolish Nowruz in favor of any other celebration. Thus, Nowruz remained the main celebration of Persian lands by both the officials and the people.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

==Conclusion==
As the broad cultural region remained politically divided, the sharp antagonisms between empires stimulated the appearance of variations of Persianate culture. After 1500, the Iranian culture developed distinct features of its own, with interposition of strong pre-Islamic and Shiite Islamic culture. Iran's ancient cultural relationship with [[Iraq|Southern Iraq]] ([[Sumer]]/[[Babylonia]]) remained strong and endured in spite of the loss of [[Mesopotamia]] to the Ottomans. Its ancient cultural, genetic, historical relationship with the [[Caucasus]] endures to the present day, as is seen in [[Azerbaijan]], [[Armenia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and parts of the [[North Caucasus]], even after the loss of these regions to Imperial Russia following the [[Russo-Persian Wars]] in the course of the 19th century. The culture of peoples of the eastern Mediterranean in Anatolia, Syria, and Egypt developed somewhat independently; India developed a vibrant and completely distinct South Asian style with little to no remnants of the once patronised Indo-Persian culture by the Mughals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1 = S.|last1 = Shamil|title = The City of Beauties in Indo-Persian Poetic Landscape|journal = Comparative Studies of South Asia, Africa and the Middle East|volume = 24|date = 2004|publisher = [[Duke University|Duke University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1 = F.|last1 = Delvoye|chapter = Music in the Indo-Persian Courts of India (14th–18th century)|title = Studies in Artistic Patronage|journal = The International Institute for Asian Studies (IIAS)|date = 1996|url = http://www.iias.nl/iiasn/iiasn7/south/delvoye.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; culture; and Central Asia, which gradually grew more isolated, predominantly remains Persianised to this day;{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Ottoman Turkey developed differently and Turkish nationalism has developed since the formation of Turkey.

'''Podrinje''' ([[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]]: Подриње) is the [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] name of the [[Drina]] river basin, known in English as the '''Drina Valley''', located in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[Serbia]].

==History==
{{moresources|section|date=December 2015}}
[[Image:Mehmed Pasa Sokolovic Bridge Visegrad 1900.JPG|thumb|250px|The bridge on the Drina in [[Višegrad]] (around 1890)]]
Between 1918-22, Podrinje District, with its seat in [[Šabac]], was one of the districts of the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]]. District comprised north-western part of present-day [[Šumadija and Western Serbia]]. Between 1922-29, Podrinje Oblast existed in roughly same area also with seat in Šabac. In 1929, a large province of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] known as the [[Drina Banovina]] was formed with capital in [[Sarajevo]]. Drina Banovina included western parts of present-day [[Serbia]] and eastern parts of present-day [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. Following [[World War II]] [[Axis Powers|Axis]] occupation in 1941, the province was abolished and its territory was divided between [[Independent State of Croatia]] and area governed by the [[Military Administration in Serbia]].  

In 1941 Yugoslav Partisans liberated the large western part of the [[Germany|German]] occupied territory. In this territory they proclaimed the [[Republic of Užice]] (Uzička Republika) with [[Užice]] city as centre of the Republic. This large free territory was island of freedom in Nazi occupied [[Europe]]. The Republic of Užice was short-lived. German troops occupied the territory again, while the majority of Partisan forces escaped towards [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]].{{cn|date=January 2016}}

When the [[Bosnian War]] broke out in 1992, the Drina Valley became the focus of a bitter campaign of ethnic cleansing by [[Serb]] forces&lt;ref&gt;Bećir Bogilović's evidence at Orić trial, 21 March 2005, ICTY, p. 6367 [http://www.icty.org/x/cases/oric/trans/en/050321IT.htm], icty.org; retrieved 31 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; which eventually culminated in the [[Srebrenica genocide]] in July 1995. 

According to the Sarajevo Research and Documentation Centre (RDC/IDC) Bosnian Atlas of the Dead Project, the Podrinje was the area of Bosnia which suffered the highest number of casualties. In 2007, Mirsad Tokaca, the RDC/IDC's director, reported that 28,666 deaths of a total of 97.207 recorded by June 2007, had occurred in the Podrinje.&lt;ref&gt;Nidzara Ahmetasević.

Today, one of the cantons in Bosnia and Herzegovina is known as [[Bosnian Podrinje Canton]].

'''Pseudolite''' is a contraction of the term "pseudo-satellite," used to refer to something that is not a [[satellite]] which performs a function commonly in the domain of satellites. Pseudolites are most often small [[transceiver]]s that are used to create a local, ground-based [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) alternative. The range of each transceiver's signal is dependent on the power available to the unit.

Being able to deploy one's own positioning system, independent of the GPS, can be useful in situations where the normal GPS signals are either blocked/jammed (military conflicts), or simply not available (exploration of other planets).

For planetary exploration, research being conducted at facilities including [[NASA Ames Research Center]] and [[Stanford University]] (see link at bottom) may allow a rover to deploy an array of pseudolites with no particular accuracy and still calibrate the system to centimeter-level resolution without human assistance. This would aid a rover's path-finding routines and increase the safe maneuvering speed of the unassisted vehicle. The concept is sometimes referred to as a Self-Calibrating Pseudolite Array (SCPA).

Other applications of pseudolite arrays include precision approach landing systems for aircraft and highly accurate tracking of transponders.

Pseudolites have started to gain more and more attention in the context of indoor location.&lt;ref&gt;R.

'''Radiometric calibration''' is a general term used in science and technology for any set of calibration techniques in support of the measurement of electromagnetic radiation and atomic particle radiation. These can be for instance, in the field of [[Radiometry]] or the measurement of [[ionising radiation]] radiated from a source. 

==Ionising radiation==
[[File:Radioactivity and radiation.png|thumb|400px|Graphic showing relationships between radioactivity and detected ionizing radiation. The detecting instrument has to be radiometrically calibrated so it is traceable to national standards.]]Ionising radiation is non-visible and requires the use of ionisation detectors such as the [[Geiger Muller counter]] or [[ion chamber]] for its [[Ionizing_radiation#Measurement|detection and measurement]]. Instruments are calibrated using standards traceable to national laboratory radiation standards, such as those at The [[National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom)|National Physical Laboratory]] in the UK.

[[Counts per minute|Count rate]] measurements are normally associated with the detection of particles, such as [[alpha particle]]s and [[beta particle]]s. However, for [[gamma ray]] and [[X-ray]] dose measurements a unit such as the [[Gray (unit)|gray]] or [[sievert]] is normally used.

The following table shows ionising radiation quantities in SI and non-SI units.

==Satellite sensor calibration==
Spectral data acquired by satellite sensors are influenced by a number of factors, such as atmospheric absorption and scattering, sensor-target-illumination geometry, sensor calibration, and image data processing procedures, which tend to change through times (Teillet, 1986). Targets in multi-date scenes are extremely variable and have been nearly impossible to compare in an automated mode (Kim and Elman, 1990). In order to detect genuine landscape changes as revealed by changes in surface reflectance from multi-date satellite images, it is necessary to carry out radiometric correction. Two approaches to radiometric correction are possible: absolute and relative (Lo and Yang, 1998). The absolute approach requires the use of ground measurements at the time of data acquisition for atmospheric correction and sensor calibration. This is not only costly but also impractical when archival satellite image data are used for change analysis (Hall et al., 1991). The relative approach to radiometric correction, known as relative radiometric normalization (RRN), is preferred because no in-situ atmospheric data at the time of satellite overpasses are required. This method involves normalizing or rectifying the intensities or digital numbers (DN) of multi-date images band-by-band to a reference image selected by the analyst. The normalized images would appear as if they were acquired with the same sensor under similar atmospheric and illumination conditions to those of the reference image.&lt;ref&gt;Yang, Xiajun, and C. P. Lo. "Relative radiometric normalization performance for change detection from multi-date satellite images." Photogrammetric Engineering and Remote Sensing 66.8 (2000): 967-980.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4596">'''Tierra templada''' (Spanish for ''temperate land'') is a pseudoclimatological term used in Latin America to refer to places which are either located in the [[tropics]] at a moderately high elevation or are marginally outside the astronomical tropics, producing a somewhat cooler overall [[climate]] than that found in the tropical lowlands, the zone of which is known as the [[tierra caliente]].

In countries situated close to the [[equator]], the tierra templada typically commences at an altitude of approximately 750 meters (roughly 2,500 feet), and extends to about 1,850 meters (or 6,000 feet), where the still cooler [[tierra fría]] begins.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geog.fu-berlin.de/~phygeo/studium/diplom/ws_0405/ms_24505_boden/boeden_azonal_hochgebirge.pdf Brigitta Schütt (2005); Azonale Böden und Hochgebirgsböden] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327182826/http://www.geog.fu-berlin.de/~phygeo/studium/diplom/ws_0405/ms_24505_boden/boeden_azonal_hochgebirge.pdf |date=2009-03-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zech and Hintermaier, 2002"&gt;Zech, W. and Hintermaier-Erhard, G.

Trenton Kostbade (2005); ''Essentials of World Regional Geography'' 2nd Edition. NY: Harcourt Brace. p.464-465.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.harpercollege.edu/mhealy/g101ilec/midamer/mmd/mmphys/mmaltzon/mmaltfr.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090724052006/http://www.harpercollege.edu/mhealy/g101ilec/midamer/mmd/mmphys/mmaltzon/mmaltfr.htm |archivedate=2009-07-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These thresholds become lower as the [[latitude]] increases. The Peruvian geographer Javier Pulgar Vidal used following altitudes: 

*1,000 m as the border between the tropical rainforest and the subtropical cloud forest
*2,300 m as the end of the subtropical cloud forest (''[[Yunga#Fluvial Yunga|Yunga fluvial]]'')
*3,500 m as the treeline
*4,800 m as the puna end&lt;ref&gt;Pulgar Vidal, Javier: ''Geografía del Perú; Las Ocho Regiones Naturales del Perú''. Edit. Universo S.A., Lima 1979. First Edition (his dissertation of 1940): Las ocho regiones naturales del Perú, ''Boletín del Museo de historia natural „Javier Prado“'', n° especial, Lima, 1941, 17, pp. 145-161.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the English translation of its name, the tierra templada is not considered "[[Temperateness|temperate]]" by climatologists, for most of the areas so designated have average temperatures in their coldest months of above 18°C (64.4°F), thus making them tropical under climate classification schemes such as that of [[Vladimir Köppen]].  In the aforementioned scheme, many locations within the tierra templada are sometimes designated ''[[Köppen Climate Classification#Group A: Tropical|Afb]]'' or ''[[Köppen Climate Classification|Awb]]'', with the ''b'' denoting the fact that the warmest month has an average temperature of below 22°C (71.6°F), meaning that all twelve months of the year have averages of between 18°C and 22°C.  [[Chinchina, Colombia]], altitude 1,360 m, is an example of a place which would be labelled ''Afb'', as it has abundant rainfall year-round, while the climate of [[San José, Costa Rica]], altitude 1,161 m,  would fall under ''Awb'' since the latter city's rainfall regime consists of a wet summer and a dry winter. The "temperate" moniker in Spanish stems from these year-round warm temperatures that are not too hot (Tierra caliente) nor become too cold (Tierra fría). Various cities in this range have been nicknamed ''City of Eternal Spring'', most notably [[Cuernavaca]], Mexico.

In the tierra templada project pat, [[coffee]] is grown extensively as a cash crop, with grains such as [[wheat]] and [[maize|corn]] being cultivated for subsistence purposes - in contrast to the warmer tierra caliente, where tropical fruits predominate.

== History ==
Plans for the creation of this public university were first developed at the 1849 [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]], but when the State of [[California]] was established in 1850, it lacked the funds necessary to create such a school. Missionaries sent west by the [[American Home Missionary Society|Home Mission Society]] of New York, however, created the [[College of California]] and eventually transferred its ownership to the State in 1855.

By 1862, the State had secured the land necessary to establish a college as a result of the [[Morrill Land-Grant Acts|Morrill Act.]] This college was known as the Agricultural Mining and Mechanical Arts College, and opened formally in 1866.

On March 23, 1868, [[Henry Huntly Haight|Governor H.H. Haight]] combined the resources of this college with the College of California to create the first [[University of California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://history.library.ucsf.edu/daniel_gilman.html|title=Daniel Coit Gilman and the Early Years of UC - Special Topics - A History of UCSF|website=history.library.ucsf.edu|access-date=2016-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Board of Regents began admitting women to the University of California in 1871, and the first woman to graduate was Rosa L. Scrivner, with a [[Bachelor of Philosophy|PhB]] in Agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/graduates00univ/graduates00univ_djvu.txt|title=Full text of "Graduates, 1864-1905.

== Campus ==
[[File:Cnr map.png|thumb|The original College of Agriculture consisted of the Hilgard, Wellman, and Giannini halls. Today, CNR has expanded to occupy the Koshland, Morgan, and Mulford buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nature.berkeley.edu/site/forms/pdf/CNR_Report.pdf|title=College of Natural Resources|last=|first=|date=February 2016|website=Forms &amp; Petitions|publisher=University of California, Berkeley|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The College of Natural Resources is located on the northwest end of the UC Berkeley campus, and comprises six main buildings.

These include the historic group of Wellman, Hilgard, and Giannini halls that composed the original college. This trio, known as the Agriculture Complex, is the most unified grouping of buildings on campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Riggs|first=William|last2=Knapp|first2=Frederic|date=2012-01-01|title=Hilgard Hall (John Galen Howard) Historic Structures Report|url=https://works.bepress.com/williamriggs/15/}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], and are visually unified by a Mediterranean landscape of olive and stone pine trees.

The first hall, Wellman, is a Classical Revival building designed in 1912 by [[John Galen Howard]] and named after [[Harry R. Wellman]], a professor of Agricultural Economics, and acting president of the University.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://texts.cdlib.org/view?docId=hb7t1nb4v2&amp;doc.view=frames&amp;chunk.id=div00071&amp;toc.id=|title=University of California: In Memoriam, 1997|website=texts.cdlib.org|access-date=2016-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hilgard was constructed six years later by the same architect, and named after [[Eugene W. Hilgard]], professor of Agricultural Chemistry and father of modern soil science. Its neo-classical design is inscribed with the phrase "''To Rescue for Human Society the Native Values of Rural Life''."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://noehill.com/alameda/nat1982004647.asp|title=National Register #82004647: Hilgard Hall on UC Berkeley Campus, California|website=noehill.com|access-date=2016-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Giannini Hall was designed by Howard's co-worker, William Charles Hays, through an endowment from the Bancitaly Corporation (now known as [[Bank of America]]) in memory of their founder, [[Amadeo Giannini]].

'''USS''' '''''Jeannette''''' was a naval exploration vessel which, commanded by [[George W. De Long]], undertook the [[Jeannette Expedition|''Jeannette'' Expedition]] of 1879–1881 to the Arctic. After being trapped in the ice and drifting for almost two years, the ship and its crew of 33 were released from the ice, then trapped again, crushed and sunk some {{convert|300|nmi}} north of the Siberian coast. The entire crew survived the sinking, but 11 died while sailing towards land in a small [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]]. The others reached Siberia, but nine subsequently perished in the [[Lena Delta]], including De Long.

The vessel had begun its active career in 1861 as '''HMS''' '''''Pandora''''', a [[Royal Navy]] [[gunboat]]. After more than a decade's service off the West African coast and in the Mediterranean, ''Pandora'' was retired from duty and sold as a private yacht to a British explorer, [[Allen Young]]. Young took her on two voyages to the Arctic, in 1875 and 1876, before selling her to [[James Gordon Bennett, Jr.]], proprietor of ''[[The New York Herald]]'', who changed her name to ''Jeannette''. Although she sailed to the Arctic under the U.S. flag as USS ''Jeannette'', subject to naval laws and discipline, Bennett remained responsible for the costs of the expedition.

== Service history ==

=== Construction and launch ===
The ship that became USS ''Jeannette'' began her life as a [[Royal Navy]] [[gunboat]], built at the [[Pembroke Dock|Pembroke Naval Dockyards]] in 1860.&lt;ref name= Davis&gt;{{cite web|title= Mid-Victorian RN vessels|url= http://www.pdavis.nl/ShowShip.php?id=1850|publisher= P. Davis|accessdate= 11 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was of wooden construction, {{convert|146|ft|m}} in length and {{convert|25|ft|m}} at the beam, with a draught of {{convert|25|ft|m}}. Her tonnage, calculated by [[Builder's Old Measurement|Builder's Measure]], was 428 tons, with a [[Displacement (ship)|displacement]] of 570 tons. She was rigged as a [[barque]], but her principal means of propulsion was by a steam-driven [[Propeller|screw]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Sides|2014|pp=86–87}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her armament was five guns. After her launch on 7 February 1861, ''Pandora'' was taken from Pembroke to [[HMNB Portsmouth|Portsmouth Dockyard]], where she was fitted with her engines and boilers, and underwent trials before commissioning. On October 22 she concluded her trials successfully, achieving a speed of 9.25 [[knots]] over a measured mile.&lt;ref name= Davis/&gt;

=== As HMS ''Pandora'' ===
In November 1861, during the [[American Civil War]], the diplomatic incident known as the [[Trent Affair|''Trent'' affair]] caused the [[Admiralty]] to bring additional ships into active service. On 27 December 1861, ''Pandora'' was formally commissioned, as tender to {{HMS|Majestic|1853|6}}, and the following day sailed for [[Liverpool]] where ''Majestic'' was berthed.&lt;ref name= Davis/&gt; The crisis was quickly resolved;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= The Trent Affair|url= http://future.state.gov/when/timeline/1861_timeline/trent_affair.html|publisher= U.S. Department of State|accessdate= 10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Pandora'' remained at Liverpool until January 1862 before returning to Portsmouth.&lt;ref name= Davis/&gt;

In April 1863 ''Pandora'' left Portsmouth for service off the coast of West Africa. She returned after four years, and was transferred to the reserve. In April 1868 she was recomissioned, and returned to West Africa. Two years later she was transferred to the Mediterranean squadron, based at [[Valletta]], Malta. This was her last commission in British naval service. In July 1872, after two years in the Mediterranean she returned to [[Spithead]], where she was taken out of active commission and berthed in Portsmouth as part of the steam reserve.&lt;ref name= Davis/&gt;

=== Allen Young ===
In 1875 ''Pandora'' was acquired from the navy by the yachtsman [[Allen Young]], for use in one of the last expeditions sent to the Canadian Arctic to investigate the disappearance, thirty years previously, of the [[Franklin's lost expedition|Franklin Expedition]]. Young sailed in June 1875, seeking not only for signs of Franklin but discover and complete the [[Northwest Passage]], then unconquered. He was unsuccessful on both counts; he found no traces of Franklin, but was stopped by ice in [[Peel Sound]], and returned to England.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Coleman|2007|pp=170–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the financiers for this venture was [[James Gordon Bennett, Jr.]], the owner of ''[[The New York Herald]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Fleming|2002|pp=194–95}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1876 Young took ''Pandora'' north again, for a second attempt on the Northwest Passage. He was diverted by a request from the Admiralty to look for the [[British Arctic Expedition]] under [[George Nares]], which was engaged in an attempt to reach the North Pole from [[Smith Sound]]. The expedition did not require ''Pandora's'' assistance, and Young returned home.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Coleman|2007|p=225}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1877 Young sold ''Pandora'' to Bennett, who was planning his own Arctic expedition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Guttridge|1988|pp=31–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== As USS ''Jeannette'' ===
{{main|Jeannette Expedition}}
Bennett's plan was to sail a vessel through the [[Bering Strait]], on the theory that the warm Pacific Ocean current known as the [[Kuroshio Current|Kuro Siwo]] would provide a "thermometric gateway" whereby a suitable ship might reach the North Pole.{{sfn|Sides|2014|p=81}} This was the primary objective, but the ship was also equipped for scientific observation. By agreement with the U.S. Department of the Navy, Bennett would finance the expedition, but would sail under naval laws and discipline,{{sfn|Guttridge|1988|pp=42–43}} and would be commanded by a naval officer, [[George W. De Long]].{{sfn|Fleming|2002|p=196}} ''Pandora'' was renamed ''Jeannette'', after Bennett's sister, and in January&amp;nbsp;1879 arrived at the [[Mare Island Naval Shipyard]], to be fitted for Arctic service.{{sfn|Sides|2014|pp=91–93, 105}}

''Jeannette'' departed San Francisco on {{nowr|July 8, 1879}}.{{sfn|De Long|Newcomb|1882|p=23}} She sent her last communication to [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] from [[Saint Lawrence Bay, Chukotka|St. Lawrence Bay]], [[Siberia]], on August&amp;nbsp;27.{{sfn|De Long|Newcomb|1882|p=106–07}} Shortly afterwards she encountered ice, of increasing severity as she pushed her way forward to [[Herald Island (Arctic)|Herald Island]].{{sfn|De Long|1884|p=112}} On September&amp;nbsp;7 she was caught fast in the ice at {{Coord|71|35|N|175|6|E}}.{{sfn|De Long|1884|p=82}}{{sfn|Guttridge|1988|p=98}} For the next 21&amp;nbsp;months, ''Jeannette'' drifted in an erratic fashion, generally to the northwest but frequently doubling back on herself.{{sfn|Sides|2014|pp=161–95}} In May&amp;nbsp;1881, two islands were discovered, which De&amp;nbsp;Long named [[Henrietta Island]] (after Bennett's mother) and [[Jeannette Island]].{{sfn|Guttridge|1988|pp=172–74}} On the night of June&amp;nbsp;12, when they had reached {{Coord|77|15|N|154|59|E}} the pressure of the ice finally began to crush ''Jeannette''. De&amp;nbsp;Long and his men unloaded provisions and equipment onto the ice, and the ship sank the following morning.{{sfn|Sides|2014|pp=226–29}}

The expedition began the long trek to the Siberian coast, hauling their sledges with boats and supplies. On their way they discovered a further island which they named [[Bennett Island]] in honor of the expedition's sponsor.{{sfn|Sides|2014|p=272}}{{sfn|De Long|1884|p=679}} After reaching the [[New Siberian Islands]] and gaining some food and rest, the party took to their three boats on September&amp;nbsp;12 for the last stage of their journey to the [[Lena Delta]], their planned landfall. As a violent storm blew up, one of the boats (with lieutenant [[Charles W. Chipp]] and seven men) capsized and sank. The other two craft, commanded by De&amp;nbsp;Long and chief engineer [[George W. Melville]] with respectively 14 and 11&amp;nbsp;men, survived the severe weather but landed at widely separated points on the delta.{{sfn|Fleming|2002|pp=221–22}}

The party headed by De&amp;nbsp;Long began the long march inland over the marshy, half-frozen delta to hoped-for native settlements. After much hardship, with many of his men severely weakened, De&amp;nbsp;Long sent the two strongest, [[William F. C. Nindemann]] and Louis P. Noros, ahead for help; they eventually found a settlement and survived. De&amp;nbsp;Long and his 11 companions died of cold and starvation.{{sfn|Fleming|2002|pp=222–26}} In the meantime, on the other side of the delta, Melville and his party had found a native village and were rescued.{{sfn|Sides|2014|pp=354–60}} Melville persuaded a group of locals to help him search for his commander. He succeeded in finding their landing place on the delta, and recovered De&amp;nbsp;Long's logbook and other important records but returned without locating the De&amp;nbsp;Long group.{{sfn|Sides|2014|pp=364–72}} In the following spring, Melville set out again, and found the bodies of De&amp;nbsp;Long and his companions on {{nowr|March 23, 1882}}.{{sfn|Sides|2014|pp=386–96}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

On June 18, 1884, wreckage from ''Jeannette'' was found on an ice floe near Julianehåb (now [[Qaqortoq]]), near the south-western corner of [[Greenland]]. This indicated that an ocean current flowed from east to west across the polar sea. It gave the Norwegian explorer [[Fridtjof Nansen]] the idea that a properly-constructed ship could enter the ice in the east, survive the pressure during the drift, and emerge in the Atlantic, perhaps having traversed the pole itself. This theory was the basis of [[Nansen's Fram expedition|Nansen's ''Fram'' expedition]] of 1893–1896.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Fleming|2002|p=239}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the open Polar Sea theory ended with ''Jeannette's'' voyage, the ship's meteorological and oceanographic records have provided 21st-century climatologists with valuable data relating to climate change and the shrinking of the polar icecap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sides |first=Hampton |title=Why an 1879 Voyage Is a Time Machine for Climate Change |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-an-1879-voyage-is-a-time-machine-for-climate-change-1406937914 |journal=The Wall Street Journal |date=August 1, 2014 |accessdate=August 16, 2015 |archivedate= 9 September 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6bPQ01oAo?url=http://www.wsj.com/articles/why-an-1879-voyage-is-a-time-machine-for-climate-change-1406937914 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contemporary ==
In February 2015 the Russian adventurer, traveler and media personality Andrey Khoroshev announced that in consultation with the [[Russian Geographical Society]], he was developing plans to locate and raise the wreck of the ''Jeannette''. Khoroshev told ''The Siberian Times'': "This vessel lies at a depth of only {{convert|18|m|ft}}, with the known location down to {{convert|1,000|m|ft}}. So in modern day conditions, to find and raise it is not such a hard task." He imagined that the event would be a great boost for Russia's relations with America, "which are not very good right now".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= Gertcyk|first= Olga|title=Russian plan to locate and raise the wreck of schooner USS Jeannette in Arctic waters|url= http://siberiantimes.com/other/others/features/f0064-russian-plan-to-locate-and-raise-the-wreck-of-schooner-uss-jeannette-in-arctic-waters/|newspaper= The Siberian Times|date= 23 February 2015|accessdate= 11 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Vizelj''' ({{lang-sr|Визељ}}) is a short channeled river in north-central [[Serbia]], the left tributary to the [[Danube]]. During its entire flow it runs through the suburban section of [[Belgrade]], on the territory of municipality of [[Palilula, Belgrade|Palilula]].

== Course and geography ==
[[Image: Labudovi-vizelj-2016.jpg|right|thumb|240px|Swans on the Vizelj]]

Vizelj originates north of [[Padinska Skela]], in the central part of the [[Pančevački Rit]], a former marshland in the southwestern corner of the [[Banat]] region. The course of the river is in the north-to-south direction and is generally full of curves and meanders. It flows through Padinska Skela and [[Kovilovo]], before it is being crossed by the Northern Tangent, in wider sense, a northern part of the [[Belgrade bypass]]. From there, meandering in the east-west direction, it flows on the west border of the urbanized area of [[Borča]] (neighborhoods of [[Mali Zbeg]], [[Nova Borča]] and [[Stara Borča]]). After exiting Borča, it receives the western section of the channeled streams of [[Sebeš|Mokri Sebeš]] from the left and Veliki Kanal from the right side, crosses the embankment which protects the inland from the Danube and turns to the southeast. Flowing on the southern border of the neighborhood of [[Kotež]], it empties into the Danube at its {{convert|1,168.5|km|abbr=on}}. It forms the entire eastern border of the ''[[river island|ada]]'' of [[Kožara]], and that entire section is projected as the future much larger [[Čaplja]] island. The final {{convert|2|km|abbr=on}} of Vizelj are also known as the ''Jojkićev Dunavac'', named after the former [[mayor of Belgrade]] [[Đurica Jojkić]], as during his tenure that section was channel and widened in an effort to quicken the drainage of the Pančevački Rit. Weekend settlement [[Mika Alas]] is located at the very confluence of the Vizelj.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Beograd - plan i vodič |date=1999 |publisher=Geokarta |isbn=86-459-0006-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Beograd - plan grada|date=2006|publisher=M@gic M@p|isbn=86-83501-53-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Turističko područje Beograda|date=2007|author=|publisher=Geokarta|isbn=86-459-0099-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="staznamo"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.plovidba.info/forum/saveti-i-uputstva/ono-sto-znamo-i-ne-znamo-o-dunavu/ |author= |title= Ono što znamo i ne znamo o Dunavu |date=20 August 2009 |publisher=Plovidba info|language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The length of the Vizelj, due to the channeling and artificial connections with the surrounding channels, has been reported as either {{convert|27|km|abbr=on}} or {{convert|31|km|abbr=on}}. The average width of the stream is {{convert|50|m|abbr=on}} and is {{convert|1.5|to|2|m|abbr=on}} deep.&lt;ref name="Politika"&gt;{{Citation | last = | first = | author = Nikola Belić | title = Kanal VIzelj će biti kajakaška oaza | newspaper = [[Politika]] | pages =  | language = Serbian | date = 21 August 2012 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the normal and high water levels, smaller vessels can enter the channel, but during the low waters it is inaccessible.&lt;ref name="staznamo"/&gt; However, it is used for kayaking since 1972, when the first kayak club in Borča was founded.&lt;ref name="labud"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.blic.rs/vesti/beograd/neverovatna-slika-u-borci-zabeleo-se-kanal/1knl8ev |author=Č.L.|title= Neverovatna slika u Borči: Zabeleo se kanal |date=26 March 2016| publisher= [[Blic]]|language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image: Vizelj park.jpg |right|thumb|240px|[[Vizelj Park]], in the vicinity of the river]]

Initial works on the river were done in the 18th century, during the reign of the empress [[Maria Theresa]], as the area was ruled by [[Austria]] at the time. In the early 1960s, with the digging of the ''Jojkićev Dunavac'', the stream was extended and got its present form. As the area became rapidly urbanized after the [[World War II]], which was not followed by the adequate communal infrastructure, the Vizelj got more and more polluted. It was partially cleaned in 2009. In 2012 sisters [[Nikolina Moldovan]] and [[Olivera Moldovan]], who practiced on the Vizelj, petitioned to the mayor [[Dragan Đilas]] to do something about the worsening conditions of the river as it is important for the national sport. City decided to financially support the cleaning, though that is not administratively under the city jurisdiction. In August–September 2012 the stream was dredged, cleaned and the vegetation was cut.&lt;ref name="Politika"/&gt; Yearly kayaking [[regattas]] have been organized since then. In 2014 the channel was cleaned again but by May 2015 it was again covered in vegetation and turned into the morass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.blic.rs/vesti/beograd/na-njih-niko-ne-misli-ocajni-uslovi-u-kojima-treniraju-kajakasi-iz-borce/snyqnh3 |author=Marija Kosanović |title= Očajni uslovi u kojima treniraju kajakaši iz Borče  |date=31 May 2015| publisher= [[Blic]]|language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The river was cleaned during the summer of 2015.&lt;ref name="koreni"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.koreni.rs/oaza-mira-i-prirode-koju-su-svi-zaboravili/ |author= |title= Oaza mira i prirode koju su svi zaboravili |date=1 December 2015| publisher= Koreni |language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, locals and members of the kayaк clubs organized and regularly clean the stream, including the cleaning of the banks in April 2017.&lt;ref name="labud"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.oplanetise.com/2017/04/22/uredjenje-obale-kanala-vizelj-u-borci/|author= |title= Uređenje obale kanala Vizelj u Borči |date=22 April 2017 | publisher= Zelena lista Srbije |language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the autumn of 2010 a flock of 30 swans landed on the Vizelj and have been coming every years since then, and the number of swans doubled. They became a local attraction.&lt;ref name="koreni"/&gt;&lt;ref name="labud"/&gt; However, the area was plagued by the [[avian influenza]] in January 2017, which killed almost 40 swans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.blic.rs/vesti/beograd/pomor-ptica-se-nastavlja-od-pticjeg-gripa-uginulo-39-labudova/wbgm2nr |author= Ana Ristović |title= Od ptičjeg gripa uginulo 39 labudova  |date=27 January 2017| publisher= Blic|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vizelj is name of the PKB's pig farm. Also, a new stadium of the [[FK BSK Borča]], built in the vicinity of the river in 2009, is named [[Vizelj Park]].

'''Ø''' is a piece of land in the valley of the [[Nørreå]] in the eastern part of [[Jutland]], [[Denmark]]. Its name means ''[[island]]'' (ø in the [[Danish language]]) and probably comes from the island-like approach to this piece of land, although it is completely landlocked and surrounded by [[meadow]]s.

Ø is famous among [[lexicography|lexicographers]] for the extreme brevity of its name: the single letter [[Ø]].
