      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3472">In [[mathematics]], an '''adjunction space''' (or '''attaching space''') is a common construction in [[topology]] where one [[topological space]] is attached or "glued" onto another. Specifically, let ''X'' and ''Y'' be topological spaces with ''A'' a [[subspace (topology)|subspace]] of ''Y''. Let ''f'' : ''A'' → ''X'' be a [[continuous (topology)|continuous map]] (called the '''attaching map'''). One forms the adjunction space ''X'' ∪&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt; ''Y'' by taking the [[disjoint union (topology)|disjoint union]] of ''X'' and ''Y'' and [[Quotient space (topology)|identifying]] ''y'' with ''f''(''y'') for all ''y'' in ''A''. Formally,

:&lt;math&gt;X\cup_f Y = (X\amalg Y) / \{f(A) \sim A\}.&lt;/math&gt;

Sometimes, the adjunction is written as &lt;math&gt;X+\!_f \,Y&lt;/math&gt;. Intuitively, one may think of ''Y'' as being glued onto ''X'' via the map ''f''.

As a set, ''X'' ∪&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt; ''Y'' consists of the disjoint union of ''X'' and (''Y'' − ''A''). The topology, however, is specified by the quotient construction. In the case where ''A'' is a [[closed set|closed]] subspace of ''Y'' one can show that the map ''X'' → ''X'' ∪&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt; ''Y'' is a closed [[embedding]] and (''Y'' − ''A'') → ''X'' ∪&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt; ''Y'' is an open embedding.

==Examples==
*A common example of an adjunction space is given when ''Y'' is a closed ''n''-[[ball (mathematics)|ball]] (or ''cell'') and ''A'' is the boundary of the ball, the (''n''−1)-[[sphere]]. Inductively attaching cells along their spherical boundaries to this space results in an example of a [[CW complex]].
*Adjunction spaces are also used to define [[connected sum]]s of [[manifold]]s. Here, one first removes open balls from ''X'' and ''Y'' before attaching the boundaries of the removed balls along an attaching map.
*If ''A'' is a space with one point then the adjunction is the [[wedge sum]] of ''X'' and ''Y''.
*If ''X'' is a space with one point then the adjunction is the quotient ''Y''/''A''.

==Categorical description==
The attaching construction is an example of a [[pushout (category theory)|pushout]] in the [[category of topological spaces]]. That is to say, the adjunction space is [[universal property|universal]] with respect to following [[commutative diagram]]:

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
[[Image:AdjunctionSpace-01.svg|175px]]
&lt;/div&gt;

Here ''i'' is the [[inclusion map]] and φ&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;, φ&lt;sub&gt;''Y''&lt;/sub&gt; are the maps obtained by composing the quotient map with the canonical injections into the disjoint union of ''X'' and ''Y''. One can form a more general pushout by replacing ''i'' with an arbitrary continuous map ''g'' &amp;mdash; the construction is similar. Conversely, if ''f'' is also an inclusion the attaching construction is to simply glue ''X'' and ''Y'' together along their common subspace.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7761">The [[United States]] [[Federal Energy Regulatory Commission| Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)]] defines the '''ancillary services''' as:
"those services necessary to support the transmission of electric power from seller to purchaser given the obligations of control areas and transmitting utilities within those control areas to maintain reliable operations of the interconnected transmission system."

Ancillary services are the specialty services and functions provided by the electric grid that facilitate and support the continuous flow of electricity so that supply will continually meet demand. The term ancillary services is used to refer to a variety of operations beyond generation and transmission that are required to maintain grid stability and security. These services generally include, frequency control, spinning reserves and operating reserves. Traditionally ancillary services have been provided by generators, however, the integration of intermittent generation and the development of smart grid technologies have prompted a shift in the equipment that can be used to provide ancillary services.

==Types of ancillary services==

FERC identifies six different kinds of ancillary services:
* scheduling and dispatch
* reactive power and voltage control&lt;ref&gt;Ahmadimanesh, Alireza, and Mohsen Kalantar. "Two new frameworks for reactive power market considering reactive losses." International Transactions on Electrical Energy Systems 27.10 (2017).&lt;/ref&gt;
* loss compensation
* load following
* system protection
* energy imbalance

===Scheduling and dispatch===

Usually performed by the [[independent system operator]] or transmission system operator, both are services dedicated to the commitment and coordination of the generation and transmission units in order to maintain the reliability of the power grid.

Scheduling refers to before-the-fact actions (like scheduling a generator to produce a certain amount of power the next week), while dispatch refers to the real-time control of the available resources.

===Reactive power and voltage control===

[[AC power#Real.2C reactive.2C and apparent power|Reactive power]] can be used to compensate the voltage drops, but must be provided closer to the loads than real power needs (this is because reactive power tend to travel badly through the grid). Notice that voltage can be controlled also using [[Tap (transformer)|transformer taps]] and [[voltage regulator]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmadimanesh, A., and M. Kalantar. "A novel cost reducing reactive power market structure for modifying mandatory generation regions of producers." Energy Policy 108 (2017): 702-711.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Frequency control===
Frequency control refers to the need to ensure that the grid frequency stays within a specific range of the nominal frequency. Mismatch between electricity generation and demand causes variations in frequency, so control services are required to bring the frequency back to its nominal value and ensure it does not vary out of range.&lt;ref&gt;Rebours, Yann G., et al. "A survey of frequency and voltage control ancillary services—Part I: Technical features." Power Systems, IEEE Transactions on 22.1 (2007): 350-357.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operating reserves===
An [[operating reserve]] is a generator that can quickly be dispatched to ensure that there is sufficient energy generation to meet load. [[Spinning reserve]]s are generators that are already online and can rapidly increase their power output to meet fast changes in demand. Spinning reserves are required because demand can vary on short timescales and rapid response is needed. Other operating reserves are generators that can be dispatched by the operator to meet demand, but that cannot respond as quickly as spinning reserves.

==Renewable generation==

The grid integration of renewable generation simultaneously requires additional ancillary services and has the potential to provide ancillary services to the grid. The inverters that are installed with distributed generation systems and roof top solar systems have the potential to provide many of the ancillary services that are traditionally provided by spinning generators and voltage regulators. These services include reactive power compensation, voltage regulation, flicker control, active power filtering and harmonic cancellation.&lt;ref&gt;Sortomme, Eric, and Mohamed A. El-Sharkawi. "Optimal scheduling of vehicle-to-grid energy and ancillary services." Smart Grid, IEEE Transactions on 3.1 (2012): 351-359.&lt;/ref&gt; Wind turbines with variable-speed generators have the potential to add [[Synchronverter|synthetic inertia]] to the grid and assist in frequency control.&lt;ref&gt;Lalor, Gillian, Alan Mullane, and Mark O'Malley. "Frequency control and wind turbine technologies." Power Systems, IEEE Transactions on 20.4 (2005): p. 1905-1913.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://elforsk.se/Rapporter/?rid=13_02_ |title=The utilization of synthetic inertia from wind farms and its impact on existing speed governors and system performance|publisher=ELFORSK |date=2013 |accessdate=18 April 2017|page=6 (Summary) |quote=Installing wind turbines with synthetic inertia is a way of preventing this deterioration. }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hydro-Québec]] began requiring synthetic inertia in 2005 as the first grid operator, demanding a temporary 6% power boost when countering frequency drop by combining the power electronics with the [[Moment of inertia|rotational inertia]] of a [[Wind turbine design#Blades|wind turbine rotor]].&lt;ref name=Fairley&gt;{{cite web|url= http://spectrum.ieee.org/energywise/energy/renewables/can-synthetic-inertia-stabilize-power-grids |title=Can Synthetic Inertia from Wind Power Stabilize Grids?|publisher=IEEE |first=Peter |last=Fairley |date=7 November 2016 |accessdate=29 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar requirements came into effect in Europe in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.entsoe.eu/major-projects/network-code-development/requirements-for-generators/Pages/default.aspx |title=Network Code on Requirements for Grid Connection Applicable to all Generators (RfG)|publisher=[[ENTSO-E]] |date=April 2016|accessdate=29 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electric vehicles==

[[Plug-in electric vehicle]]s have the potential to be utilized to provide ancillary services to the grid, specifically load regulation and spinning reserves. Plug-in electric vehicles can behave like distributed energy storage and have the potential to discharge power back to the grid through bidirectional flow, referred to as [[vehicle-to-grid]] (V2G). Plug-in electric vehicles have the ability to supply power at a fast rate which enables them to be used like spinning reserves and provide grid stability with the increased use of intermittent generation such as wind and solar. The technologies to utilize electric vehicles to provide ancillary services are not yet widely implemented, but there is much anticipation of their potential.&lt;ref&gt;Joos, G., et al. "The potential of distributed generation to provide ancillary services." Power Engineering Society Summer Meeting, 2000. IEEE. Vol. 3. IEEE, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Fibro.JPG|thumb|300px|A pre-WW2 house in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]].  The roof is sheeted with corrugated fibro sheets and the walls with flat fibro sheeting, with fibro battens covering the joints.]][[File:Arcon mk post-war pre-fab.jpg|thumb|Example of asbestos cement siding and lining on a post-war temporary house in Yardley. Nearly 40,000 of these structures were built between 1946 and 1949 to house families.]]

The name '''fibro''' or '''fibrolite''' is short for "fibrous (or fibre) [[cement]] sheet", more commonly called "[[asbestos]] cement sheet" or "AC sheet". It is a building material in which asbestos fibres are used to reinforce thin rigid cement sheets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baalliance.com.au/glossary.htm B.A.Group - Glossary&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060819213146/http://www.baalliance.com.au/glossary.htm |date=August 19, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Asbestos-cement is a modern product, utilized mainly in industrial work due to the plain surface and lack of stylistic elements on each sheet. The material rose to necessity during [[World War II]] to make sturdy, inexpensive military housing, and continued to be used as an affordable substitute for many roofing products following the war.&lt;ref&gt;McLaughlin, Robert W. and Henry A. Jandl. "Asbestos Cement: A Basic Building Material." Princeton University School of Architecture. Princeton, New Jersey, (1959).&lt;/ref&gt;  Advertised as a fireproof alternative to other roofing materials such as [[asphalt]], asbestos-cement roofs were popular not only for safety but also for affordability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docuri.com/download/apt-attitudes-towards-asphalt-roofing_59a8d6c1f581719e12adbb58_pdf|title=APT - Attitudes Towards Asphalt Roofing |format=PDF|website=Docuri.com|accessdate=7 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to asbestos-cement’s imitation of more expensive materials such as wood siding and shingles, [[brick]], [[slate]], and [[stone]], the product was marketed as an affordable renovation material. Asbestos-cement faced competition with the [[aluminum alloy]], available in large quantities after WWII, and the reemergence of wood clapboard and vinyl siding in the mid to late twentieth century. 

Asbestos-cement is usually formed into flat or corrugated sheets or piping, but can be molded into any shape wet cement can fit. In Europe, many forms were historically used for cement sheets, while the US leaned more conservative in material shapes due to labor and production costs. Although fibro was used in a number of countries, it was in [[Australia]] and New Zealand where its use was the most widespread. Predominantly manufactured and sold by [[James Hardie|James Hardie &amp; Co.]] until the mid-1980s, fibro in all its forms was a very popular building material, largely due to its durability. The reinforcing fibres involved in construction were almost always asbestos. [[File:StateLibQld 2 152895 James Hardie and Wunderlich float ready for the Victory Day procession in Brisbane, 1946.jpg|thumb|StateLibQld 2 152895 James Hardie and Wunderlich float ready for the Victory Day procession in Brisbane, 1946]]

The use of fibro that contains asbestos has been [[Asbestos and the law|banned in several countries]], including Australia. As recently as 2016, the material has been discovered in new components sold for construction projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-07-14/asbestos-found-in-perth-childrens-hospital-roof-panels/7628108 |title=Asbestos found in $1.2b Perth Children's Hospital, says WA Health Minister |publisher=ABC News |date=14 July 2016 |accessdate=3 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health effects ==
When exposed to weather and erosion elements, such as in roofs, the surface corrosion of asbestos cement can be a source of airborne toxic fibres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://academic.oup.com/annweh/article/53/6/627/175330|title=Risk Assessment of the Decay of Asbestos Cement Roofs|first1=A.|last1=Campopiano|first2=D.|last2=Ramires|first3=A.

[[Fibre cement]] sheet is still readily available, but the reinforcing fibres are now cellulose rather than asbestos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However the name "fibro" is still applied to it for traditional reasons.

==Products used in the building industry==
[[Image:Corrugated-fibro-roofing.jpg|thumb|Roof sheeting, known as Hardies "Super Six."]]{{Unreferenced section|date = June 2015}}
* Roofs- typically on industrial or farmyard buildings.
* Flat sheets for house walls and ceilings were usually 6&amp;nbsp;mm and 4.5&amp;nbsp;mm thick, in 900 and 1200 widths and from 1800 to 3000 long.
* Battens 50&amp;nbsp;mm wide × 8&amp;nbsp;mm thick used to cover the joints in fibro sheets.
* "Super Six" corrugated roof sheeting and fencing.
* Internal wet area sheeting, "Tilux"
* Pipes of various sizes for water reticulation and drainage. Drainage pipes tend to be made of pitch fibre, with asbestos cement added to strengthen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/asbestos/essentials/cement.htm|title=Where can you find asbestos? Asbestos cement|website=Hse.gov.uk|accessdate=7 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Moulded products ranging from plant pots to outdoor telephone cabinet roofs and cable pits.

==Cleaning of asbestos cement==
Some Australian states, such as [[Queensland]], prohibit the cleaning of fibro with [[pressure washer]]s, because it can spread the embedded asbestos fibres over a wide area. Safer cleaning methods involve using a [[fungicide]] and a sealant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Water Blasters|url=http://www.deir.qld.gov.au/asbestos/resources/pdfs/prohibited-use-of-water-blasters.pdf|publisher=Queensland Government|accessdate=2016-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
In the [[James Blundell (singer)|James Blundell]] &amp; [[James Reyne]] song "[[Way Out West (The Dingoes song)|Way Out West]]", there is a reference to a fibro cement house, with the original [[The Dingoes|Dingoes]]' version of the song having a reference to a house of fibre cement. Fibro is also mentioned several times on the Australian TV show ''[[Housos]]''.

{{infobox bohrium}}
'''Bohrium''' is a [[synthetic element|synthetic]] [[chemical element]] with symbol '''Bh''' and [[atomic number]] 107. It is named after Danish physicist [[Niels Bohr]]. As a synthetic element, it can be created in a laboratory but is not found in nature. It is [[radioactive]]: its most stable known [[isotope]], &lt;sup&gt;270&lt;/sup&gt;Bh, has a [[half-life]] of approximately 61&amp;nbsp;seconds, though the unconfirmed &lt;sup&gt;278&lt;/sup&gt;Bh may have a longer half-life of about 690&amp;nbsp;seconds.

In the [[periodic table]] of the elements, it is a [[d-block]] [[transactinide element]]. It is a member of the [[period 7|7th period]] and belongs to the [[group 7 element]]s as the fifth member of the 6d series of [[transition metal]]s. Chemistry experiments have confirmed that bohrium behaves as the heavier [[homology (chemistry)|homologue]] to [[rhenium]] in group 7. The [[chemical properties]] of bohrium are characterized only partly, but they compare well with the chemistry of the other group 7 elements.

==History==
[[File:Niels Bohr.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Element 107 was originally proposed to be named after [[Niels Bohr]], a Danish nuclear physicist, with the name ''nielsbohrium'' (Ns). This name was later changed by [[IUPAC]] to ''bohrium'' (Bh).]]

===Discovery===
Two groups claimed [[Timeline of chemical element discoveries|discovery of the element]]. Evidence of bohrium was first reported in 1976 by a Soviet research team led by [[Yuri Oganessian]], in which targets of [[bismuth-209]] and [[lead]]-208 were bombarded with accelerated nuclei of [[chromium]]-54 and [[manganese]]-55 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Yu. Ts. Oganessian et al. [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0375947476906072 On spontaneous fission of neutron-deficient isotopes of elements 103, 105 and 107] // Nuclear Physics A. — 1976. — Т. 273. — № 2. — С. 505-522.&lt;/ref&gt; Two activities, one with a half-life of one to two milliseconds, and the other with an approximately five-second half-life, were seen. Since the ratio of the intensities of these two activities was constant throughout the experiment, it was proposed that the first was from the [[isotope]] bohrium-261 and that the second was from its daughter [[dubnium]]-257. Later, the dubnium isotope was corrected to dubnium-258, which indeed has a five-second half-life (dubnium-257 has a one-second half-life); however, the half-life observed for its parent is much shorter than the half-lives later observed in the definitive discovery of bohrium at [[Darmstadt]] in 1981. The [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|IUPAC]]/IUPAP Transfermium Working Group (TWG) concluded that while dubnium-258 was probably seen in this experiment, the evidence for the production of its parent bohrium-262 was not convincing enough.&lt;ref name="93TWG"/&gt;

In 1981, a German research team led by [[Peter Armbruster]] and [[Gottfried Münzenberg]] at the [[GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research]] (GSI Helmholtzzentrum für Schwerionenforschung) in Darmstadt bombarded a target of bismuth-209 with accelerated nuclei of chromium-54 to produce 5 atoms of the isotope bohrium-262:&lt;ref name="262Bh"&gt;{{cite journal

This discovery was further substantiated by their detailed measurements of the alpha decay chain of the produced bohrium atoms to previously known isotopes of [[fermium]] and [[californium]].

===Proposed names===
[[File:Bohrium hassium meitnerium ceremony.jpg|thumb|left|Naming ceremony conducted at the GSI on 7 September 1992 for the namings of elements 107, 108, and 109 as nielsbohrium, hassium, and meitnerium]]
In September 1992, the German group suggested the name ''nielsbohrium'' with symbol ''Ns'' to honor the Danish physicist [[Niels Bohr]]. The Soviet scientists at the [[Joint Institute for Nuclear Research]] in [[Dubna]], Russia had suggested this name be given to element 105 (which was finally called dubnium) and the German team wished to recognise both Bohr and the fact that the Dubna team had been the first to propose the cold fusion reaction to solve the controversial problem of the naming of element 105. The Dubna team agreed with the German group's naming proposal for element 107.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi =10.1351/pac199365081815

There was an [[element naming controversy]] as to what the elements from 104 to 106 were to be called; the [[IUPAC]] adopted ''unnilseptium'' (symbol ''Uns'') as a temporary, [[systematic element name]] for this element.&lt;ref name=IUPAC97&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1351/pac199769122471|title=Names and symbols of transfermium elements (IUPAC Recommendations 1997)|date=1997|journal=Pure and Applied Chemistry|volume=69|pages=2471|issue=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994 a committee of IUPAC recommended that element 107 be named ''bohrium'', not ''nielsbohrium'', since there was no precedence for using a scientist's complete name in the naming of an element.&lt;ref name=IUPAC97/&gt;&lt;ref name=IUPAC94&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1351/pac199466122419|title=Names and symbols of transfermium elements (IUPAC Recommendations 1994)|date=1994|journal=Pure and Applied Chemistry|volume=66|pages=2419|issue=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was opposed by the discoverers as there was some concern that the name might be confused with [[boron]] and in particular the distinguishing of the names of their respective [[oxyanion]]s, ''bohrate'' and ''borate''. The matter was handed to the Danish branch of IUPAC which, despite this, voted in favour of the name ''bohrium'', and thus the name ''bohrium'' for element 107 was recognized internationally in 1997;&lt;ref name=IUPAC97/&gt; the names of the respective oxyanions of boron and bohrium remain unchanged despite their homophony.&lt;ref&gt;{{RedBook2005|pages=337–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bohrium has no stable or naturally occurring isotopes. Several radioactive isotopes have been synthesized in the laboratory, either by fusing two atoms or by observing the decay of heavier elements. Twelve different isotopes of bohrium have been reported with atomic masses 260–262, 264–267, 270–272, 274, and 278, one of which, bohrium-262, has a known [[metastable state]]. All of these but the unconfirmed &lt;sup&gt;278&lt;/sup&gt;Bh decay only through alpha decay, although some unknown bohrium isotopes are predicted to undergo spontaneous fission.&lt;ref name=nuclidetable/&gt;

The lighter isotopes usually have shorter half-lives; half-lives of under 100&amp;nbsp;ms for &lt;sup&gt;260&lt;/sup&gt;Bh, &lt;sup&gt;261&lt;/sup&gt;Bh, &lt;sup&gt;262&lt;/sup&gt;Bh, and &lt;sup&gt;262m&lt;/sup&gt;Bh were observed. &lt;sup&gt;264&lt;/sup&gt;Bh, &lt;sup&gt;265&lt;/sup&gt;Bh, &lt;sup&gt;266&lt;/sup&gt;Bh, and &lt;sup&gt;271&lt;/sup&gt;Bh are more stable at around 1&amp;nbsp;s, and &lt;sup&gt;267&lt;/sup&gt;Bh and &lt;sup&gt;272&lt;/sup&gt;Bh have half-lives of about 10&amp;nbsp;s. The heaviest isotopes are the most stable, with &lt;sup&gt;270&lt;/sup&gt;Bh and &lt;sup&gt;274&lt;/sup&gt;Bh having measured half-lives of about 61&amp;nbsp;s and 40&amp;nbsp;s respectively, and the even heavier unconfirmed isotope &lt;sup&gt;278&lt;/sup&gt;Bh appearing to have an even longer half-life of about 690&amp;nbsp;s. The unknown isotopes &lt;sup&gt;273&lt;/sup&gt;Bh and &lt;sup&gt;275&lt;/sup&gt;Bh are predicted to have even longer half-lives of around 90&amp;nbsp;minutes and 40&amp;nbsp;minutes respectively. Before its discovery, &lt;sup&gt;274&lt;/sup&gt;Bh was also predicted to have a half-life of 90&amp;nbsp;minutes, but it was found to have a half-life of only about 40&amp;nbsp;seconds.&lt;ref name=nuclidetable/&gt;

The proton-rich isotopes with masses 260, 261, and 262 were directly produced by cold fusion, those with mass 262 and 264 were reported in the decay chains of meitnerium and roentgenium, while the neutron-rich isotopes with masses 265, 266, 267 were created in irradiations of actinide targets. The five most neutron-rich ones with masses 270, 271, 272, 274, and 278 (unconfirmed) appear in the decay chains of &lt;sup&gt;282&lt;/sup&gt;Nh, &lt;sup&gt;287&lt;/sup&gt;Mc, &lt;sup&gt;288&lt;/sup&gt;Mc, &lt;sup&gt;294&lt;/sup&gt;Ts, and &lt;sup&gt;290&lt;/sup&gt;Fl respectively. These eleven isotopes have half-lives ranging from about ten&amp;nbsp;milliseconds for &lt;sup&gt;262m&lt;/sup&gt;Bh to about one&amp;nbsp;minute for &lt;sup&gt;270&lt;/sup&gt;Bh and &lt;sup&gt;274&lt;/sup&gt;Bh, extending to about twelve minutes for the unconfirmed &lt;sup&gt;278&lt;/sup&gt;Bh, one of the longest-lived known superheavy nuclides.&lt;ref name="Doi_"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Münzenberg|first1=G.|last2=Gupta|first2=M. |chapter=Production and Identification of Transactinide Elements |editor-first=Attila |editor-last=Vértes |editor-first2=Sándor |editor-last2=Nagy |editor-first3=Zoltán |editor-last3=Klencsár |editor-first4=Rezső G. |editor-last4=Lovas |editor-first5=Frank |editor-last5=Rösch |title=Handbook of Nuclear Chemistry: Production and Identification of Transactinide Elements |page=877 |date=2011 |doi=10.1007/978-1-4419-0720-2_19 |isbn=978-1-4419-0719-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Predicted properties==
===Chemical===
Bohrium is the fifth member of the 6d series of transition metals and the heaviest member of [[group 7 element|group 7]] in the periodic table, below [[manganese]], [[technetium]] and [[rhenium]]. All the members of the group readily portray their group oxidation state of +7 and the state becomes more stable as the group is descended. Thus bohrium is expected to form a stable +7 state. Technetium also shows a stable +4 state whilst rhenium exhibits stable +4 and +3 states. Bohrium may therefore show these lower states as well.&lt;ref name=BFricke/&gt; The higher +7 oxidation state is more likely to exist in oxyanions, such as perbohrate, {{chem|BhO|4|-}}, analogous to the lighter [[permanganate]], [[pertechnetate]], and [[perrhenate]]. Nevertheless, bohrium(VII) is likely to be unstable in aqueous solution, and would probably be easily reduced to the more stable bohrium(IV).&lt;ref name=Haire/&gt;

Technetium and rhenium are known to form volatile heptoxides M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; (M = Tc, Re), so bohrium should also form the volatile oxide Bh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;. The oxide should dissolve in water to form perbohric acid, HBhO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.
Rhenium and technetium form a range of oxyhalides from the halogenation of the oxide. The chlorination of the oxide forms the oxychlorides MO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl, so BhO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl should be formed in this reaction. Fluorination results in MO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F and MO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; for the heavier elements in addition to the rhenium compounds ReOF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; and ReF&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;. Therefore, oxyfluoride formation for bohrium may help to indicate eka-rhenium properties.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Georg Nadler "Rhenium and Rhenium Compounds"  Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2000.  {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a23_199}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the oxychlorides are asymmetrical, and they should have increasingly large [[dipole]] moments going down the group, they should become less volatile in the order TcO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl &amp;gt; ReO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl &amp;gt; BhO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl: this was experimentally confirmed in 2000 by measuring the [[enthalpy|enthalpies]] of [[adsorption]] of these three compounds. The values are for TcO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl and ReO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl are −51&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol and −61&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol respectively; the experimental value for BhO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl is −77.8&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol, very close to the theoretically expected value of −78.5&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol.&lt;ref name=Haire/&gt;

===Physical and atomic===
Bohrium is expected to be a solid under normal conditions and assume a [[hexagonal close-packed]] crystal structure (&lt;sup&gt;''c''&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1.62), similar to its lighter [[congener (chemistry)|congener]] rhenium.&lt;ref name=hcp/&gt; It should be a very heavy metal with a [[density]] of around 37.1&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, which would be the third-highest of any of the 118 known elements, lower than only [[meitnerium]] (37.4&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) and [[hassium]] (41&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), the two following elements in the periodic table. In comparison, the densest known element that has had its density measured, [[osmium]], has a density of only 22.61&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. This results from bohrium's high atomic weight, the [[lanthanide contraction|lanthanide and actinide contractions]], and [[relativistic quantum chemistry|relativistic effects]], although production of enough bohrium to measure this quantity would be impractical, and the sample would quickly decay.&lt;ref name=Haire/&gt;

The atomic radius of bohrium is expected to be around 128&amp;nbsp;pm.&lt;ref name=Haire/&gt; Due to the relativistic stabilization of the 7s orbital and destabilization of the 6d orbital, the Bh&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion is predicted to have an electron configuration of [Rn] 5f&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; 6d&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; 7s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, giving up a 6d electron instead of a 7s electron, which is the opposite of the behavior of its lighter homologues manganese and technetium. Rhenium, on the other hand, follows its heavier congener bohrium in giving up a 5d electron before a 6s electron, as relativistic effects have become significant by the sixth period, where they cause among other things the yellow color of [[gold]] and the low melting point of [[mercury (element)|mercury]]. The Bh&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ion is expected to have an electron configuration of [Rn] 5f&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; 6d&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; 7s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; in contrast, the Re&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ion is expected to have a [Xe] 4f&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; 5d&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; configuration, this time analogous to manganese and technetium.&lt;ref name=Haire/&gt; The ionic radius of hexacoordinate heptavalent bohrium is expected to be 58&amp;nbsp;pm (heptavalent manganese, technetium, and rhenium having values of 46, 57, and 53&amp;nbsp;pm respectively). Pentavalent bohrium should have a larger ionic radius of 83&amp;nbsp;pm.&lt;ref name=Haire/&gt;

==Experimental chemistry==
In 1995, the first report on attempted isolation of the element was unsuccessful, prompting new theoretical studies to investigate how best to investigate bohrium (using its lighter homologs technetium and rhenium for comparison) and removing unwanted contaminating elements such as the trivalent [[actinide]]s, the [[group 5 element]]s, and [[polonium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Chemical Separation Procedure Proposed for Studies of Bohrium|last1=Malmbeck|first1=R.|last2=Skarnemark|first2=G.|last3=Alstad|first3=J.|last4=Fure|first4=K.|last5=Johansson|first5=M.|last6=Omtvedt|first6=J.

In 2000, it was confirmed that although relativistic effects are important, bohrium behaves like a typical group 7 element.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gäggeler|first1=H. W.|last2=Eichler|first2=R.|last3=Brüchle|first3=W.|last4=Dressler|first4=R.|last5=Düllmann|first5=Ch. E.|last6=Eichler|first6=B.|last7=Gregorich|first7=K. E.|last8=Hoffman|first8=D.

The resulting atoms were thermalised and reacted with a HCl/O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; mixture to form a volatile oxychloride. The reaction also produced isotopes of its lighter homologues, technetium (as &lt;sup&gt;108&lt;/sup&gt;Tc) and rhenium (as &lt;sup&gt;169&lt;/sup&gt;Re). The isothermal adsorption curves were measured and gave strong evidence for the formation of a volatile oxychloride with properties similar to that of rhenium oxychloride. This placed bohrium as a typical member of group 7.&lt;ref name=00Ei01&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gsi.de/informationen/wti/library/scientificreport2000/Chemistry/9/r_eichler_jb2000.pdf|title=Gas chemical investigation of bohrium (Bh, element 107)|last=Eichler |first=R. |display-authors=etal |work=GSI Annual Report 2000|accessdate=2008-02-29|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219002121/http://www.gsi.de/informationen/wti/library/scientificreport2000/Chemistry/9/r_eichler_jb2000.pdf|archivedate=2012-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The adsorption enthalpies of the oxychlorides of technetium, rhenium, and bohrium were measured in this experiment, agreeing very well with the theoretical predictions and implying a sequence of decreasing oxychloride volatility down group 7 of TcO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl &amp;gt; ReO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl &amp;gt; BhO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl.&lt;ref name=Haire/&gt;

The longer-lived heavy isotopes of bohrium, produced as the daughters of heavier elements, offer advantages for future radiochemical experiments. Although the heavy isotope &lt;sup&gt;274&lt;/sup&gt;Bh requires a rare and highly radioactive [[berkelium]] target for its product, the isotopes &lt;sup&gt;272&lt;/sup&gt;Bh, &lt;sup&gt;271&lt;/sup&gt;Bh, and &lt;sup&gt;270&lt;/sup&gt;Bh can be readily produced as daughters of more easily produced [[moscovium]] and [[nihonium]] isotopes.&lt;ref name=Moody&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Synthesis of Superheavy Elements |last1=Moody |first1=Ken |editor1-first=Matthias |editor1-last=Schädel |editor2-first=Dawn |editor2-last=Shaughnessy |title=The Chemistry of Superheavy Elements |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |edition=2nd |pages=24–8 |isbn=9783642374661}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was part of [[NASA Astronaut Group 6]],&lt;ref name="NASA Bio"/&gt; a group of [[scientist]]-astronauts chosen with the intention of training for the [[Apollo Applications Program]].

==Personal==
O'Leary was born and raised in [[Boston, Massachusetts]] on January 27, 1940.  He decided to become an astronaut after visiting [[Washington, D.C.]] as a teenager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= O'Leary|first=Brian|year=2009|title=The Energy Solution Revolution|publisher=Bridger House Publishers, Inc|pages=176–177|isbn=978-0-9799176-4-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
O'Leary graduated from [[Belmont High School (Belmont, Massachusetts)|Belmont High School]] in 1957.  He received a [[B.A.]] in [[physics]] from [[Williams College]] in 1961, an [[M.A.]] in [[astronomy]] from [[Georgetown University]] in 1964, and a [[Ph.D.]] in astronomy from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1967.&lt;ref name="NASA Bio"/&gt;

==Organizations==
O'Leary became a [[Fellow]] of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] in 1975.&lt;ref name="NASA Bio"/&gt;  From 1970–1976, he was the secretary of the [[American Geophysical Union]]'s Planetology Section.

==Political activities==
O'Leary became politically active early in his career and participated in a demonstration in [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1970, to protest the [[Cambodian Campaign]]. [[Richard Nixon]] administration officials invited O'Leary and his fellow Cornell professors to present their views.&lt;ref&gt;CBS Special - "Colleges, Cambodia, and Confrontation", originally aired on May 9, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= O'Leary|first=Brian|year=2009|title=The Energy Solution Revolution|publisher=Bridger House Publishers, Inc|page=189|isbn=978-0-9799176-4-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975 and 1976, he worked on was [[Morris Udall]]'s presidential campaign as an energy advisor, as well as for the U.S. House Interior Committee subcommittee on energy and the environment as Udall's special staff consultant on energy.&lt;ref name="Shayler 2"/&gt; O'Leary worked for U.S. presidential candidates [[Jesse Jackson]], [[Dennis Kucinich]], [[George McGovern]], and [[Walter Mondale]].&lt;ref name="Shayler 1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= O'Leary|first=Brian|year=2009|title=The Energy Solution Revolution|publisher=Bridger House Publishers, Inc|pages=189–198|isbn=978-0-9799176-4-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During those years, he wrote about the [[Space Shuttle]], NASA's lunar landings, and the [[weaponization of space]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=O'Leary, B.|title=Topics&amp;nbsp;— Science&amp;nbsp;— Or Stunts&amp;nbsp;— On the Moon?|journal=[[The New York Times]]|date=April 25, 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=O'Leary, B.|title=The Wild Blue Space Shuttle|journal=The New York Times|date=January 20, 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=O'Leary, B.|title=Do We Really Want a Space Shuttle?|journal=The New York Times|date=February 16, 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=O'Leary, B.|title=Space Hawks:  Military Race to Keep Shuttle Flying|journal=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=April 6, 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=O'Leary, B.|title=Wanted: A Space Program that will Fly into the Future|journal=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=January 22, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Leary traveled to the Soviet Union twice in the late 1980s with the aim of promoting peaceful space exploration, including a peace cruise along the [[Dnieper River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Peace Cruise on the Dnieper|journal=[[Soviet Life]]|date=February 1990|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Frontiers of Science==

After Princeton, O'Leary worked [[Science Applications International Corporation]].&lt;ref name="Shayler 2"/&gt; He refused to work on military space applications, for which reason he lost his position there in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Leary|first=Brian|year=2009|title=The Energy Solution Revolution|publisher=Bridger House Publishers, Inc|pages=180–181|isbn=978-0-9799176-4-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1987, O'Leary increasingly explored unorthodox ideas, particularly the relationship between consciousness and science, and became widely known for his writings on "the frontiers of science, space, energy and culture".&lt;ref name="Shayler 2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Leary|first=Brian|year=1989|title=Exploring Inner and Outer Space|publisher=North Atlantic Books|location=Berkeley, California|isbn=1-55643-068-X}}; {{cite book|last=O'Leary|first=Brian|year=1993|title=The Second Coming of Science|publisher=North Atlantic Books|location=Berkeley, California|isbn=1-55643-152-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1980s, he lectured at the [[Findhorn Foundation]], [[Esalen Institute]], [[Omega Institute for Holistic Studies]], [[Unity Church]]es, [[Religious Science]] churches and [[Sivananda Yoga Vedanta Centres]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Leary|first=Brian|year=1996|title=Miracle in the Void|publisher=Kamapua'a Press|location=[[Kihei, Hawaii]]|isbn=0-9647826-0-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Leary|first=Brian|year=2003|title=Re-Inheriting the Earth|publisher=self-published|isbn=0-939040-37-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With Meredith Miller, his artist wife, he co-founded the Montesueños Eco-Retreat in [[Vilcabamba, Ecuador]] in 2008, which is devoted to "peace, sustainability, the arts and new science".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.montesuenos.org|title=Montesuenos: A center for peace, sustainability, the arts and new science|publisher=Montesueños Eco-Retreat|accessdate=April 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
O'Leary contracted [[skin cancer]] in his 60s, which he treated with an alternative methodology involving a substance called [[Cansema]]. After having his second heart attack in 2010, he died of [[intestinal cancer]] on July 28, 2011, soon after diagnosis, at his home in [[Vilcabamba, Ecuador|Vilcabamba]].

The '''Burns' Day Storm''' (also known as '''Cyclone Daria''') was an extremely violent windstorm that took place on 25–26 January 1990 over north-western Europe. It is one of the strongest [[European windstorm]]s on record. This storm has received different names as there is no official list of such events in Europe. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Seasonal predictability of European wind storms|url=http://www.ecmwf.int/newsevents/meetings/forecast_products_user/Presentations2008/Renggli.pdf|work=Institute of Meteorology|publisher=[[Free University of Berlin]]|accessdate=21 March 2012|page=7|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting on the [[Burns day|birthday of Scottish poet Robert Burns]], it caused widespread damage and [[hurricane]]-force winds over a wide area. The storm was responsible for 97 deaths (according to the [[Met Office]]), although figures have ranged from 89 to over 100.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

== Meteorological history ==

The storm began as a [[cold front]] over the Northern Atlantic Ocean on 23 January. By the 24th, it had a minimum central [[Atmospheric pressure|pressure]] of 992&amp;nbsp;mbar and began to undergo [[explosive cyclogenesis]], sometimes referred to as a weather bomb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Daria le 25 janvier 1990 - Tempêtes en France métropolitaine|url=http://tempetes.meteofrance.fr/Daria-le-25-janvier-1990.html|website=tempetes.meteofrance.fr|publisher=Météo-France|accessdate=5 November 2017|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt; It made landfall on the morning of the 25th over Ireland, where 17 died, including 8 on a bus which was struck by a falling tree. It then tracked over to [[Ayrshire]] in Scotland. The lowest pressure of 949&amp;nbsp;mbar was recorded near [[Edinburgh]] around 16:00. After hitting the United Kingdom, the storm tracked rapidly east towards [[Denmark]], causing major damage and 30 deaths in the [[Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]].&lt;ref name="McCallum" /&gt;

===Winds===

The strongest sustained winds recorded were between 70 and 75&amp;nbsp;mph (110–120&amp;nbsp;km/h), comparable to a weak Category&amp;nbsp;1 hurricane or Hurricane-force 12 on the [[Beaufort Scale]]. Strong gusts of up to 104&amp;nbsp;mph (170&amp;nbsp;km/h;) were reported, and it was these which caused the most extensive damage.

===Forecasting===
The Burns' Day Storm of 1990 has been given as an example of when the [[Met Office]] "got the prediction right".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Adams|first=Tim|title=Met Office forecasts storm warnings over its accuracy|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/feb/21/met-office-forecasts-accuracy|accessdate=9 February 2013|newspaper=The Observer|date=21 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The model forecast hinged on observations from two ships in the Atlantic near the developing storm the day before it reached the UK.&lt;ref name="Heming" &gt;{{cite journal|last=Heming|first=J.T.|title=The impact of surface and radiosonde observations from two Atlantic ships on a numerical weather prediction model forecast for the storm of 25 January 1990.|journal=The Meteorological Magazine|year=1990|volume=119|pages=249–259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the day of the storm the [[Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute]] (KNMI) increased warnings to force 11 and eventually to hurricane force 12. Research conducted by them showed that most of the general public were not able to understand the severity of the warnings. The storm has led to more awareness about the understanding of storminess among the public by the KNMI, who started a teletext page and the introduction of special warnings for extreme weather events in reaction to these findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nader Verklaard Zwaarste storm in decennia|url=http://www.knmi.nl/cms/content/75142/zwaarste_storm_in_decennia|publisher=KMNI|accessdate=9 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impacts ==

Casualties were much higher than those of the [[Great Storm of 1987]], because the storm hit during the daytime. The storm caused extensive damage, with approximately 3&amp;nbsp;million trees downed, [[electric power|power]] disrupted to over 500,000 homes and severe [[flooding]] in England and [[West Germany]]. The storm cost insurers in the UK £3.37 billion, the UK's most expensive weather event to insurers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=UK storm payout 'may hit £350m' the storm was really really big|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6380123.stm |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=20 February 2007 |accessdate=16 October 2017  |quote=High winds that hit the country in the first few weeks of 1990 – costing insurers £3.37bn – remain the most expensive for insurers. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the deaths were caused by collapsing buildings or falling debris. In one case in [[Sussex]], a class of children was evacuated just minutes before their school building collapsed.  Actor [[Gorden Kaye]] was also injured during the storm, when a plank of an advertising board was blown through his car's windscreen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/january/25/newsid_3420000/3420797.stm|title=1990: Children killed in devastating storm|work=On This Day|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''CC-HOD''' ('''Catalytic Carbon - Hydrogen On Demand)''' is a process splits water into [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]] at low temperatures.

== History ==
The CC-HOD method was discovered by Howard Phillips, managing director of Phillips Company, a pharmaceutical manufacturing company.

Hydrogen is energy dense and environmentally benign because upon combustion it produces only water vapor. Most hydrogen fuel is produced by [[electrolysis]], a process that requires substantial energy. Phillips proposed that CC-HOD could become an alternative to electrolysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Show Me the Hydrogen |url=http://www.clean-air.org/newsletterarchives/24-1.pdf |volume=24 |issue=1 |year=2013 |journal=Hydrogen Today |accessdate=20 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Process ==

CC-HOD requires that water be heated only modestly above ambient temperature, catalytic carbon and scrap metal. If [[aluminium]] is submerged in a tank with the catalytic carbon. Pure Hydrogen gas is formed when the water reaches a temperature of about {{Convert|80|C|F}}. Oxygen remains in the tank where it bonds with the aluminium to form aluminium hydroxide:

Al + H²O + CC = CC + Al(OH)³ + H²

== Research ==

CC-HOD has mainly been researched by open science projects. LENR Ltd. is a UK based open research group specializing in validating novel energy technologies. They tested CC-HOD for several years and claimed it was reliable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= ANOMALOUS HEAT IN CARBON/LEAD/HYDROGEN SYSTEMS. Simple And Accessible – But Is It LENR? |first=Alan |last=Smith|url=http://www.lookingforheat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Anomalous-Heat-in-Lead-Carbon-Hydrogen-Systems-Is-it-LENR.pdf |journal=Looking For Heat |date=November 2016 |accessdate=20 May 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Potential applications ==

Besides production of clean energy for transportation and heating CC-HOD can be used for recycling [[Scrap|scrap metal]]. Depending on which type of metal is used, the byproducts from the process could be used for used to manufacture for example electronics, deodorant, paint or ink.

== Patent ==

A patent application 'Methods and systems for producing hydrogen WO2013016367 A1' was filed June 24, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{patent|US|WO2013016367A1|application}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1911">The '''Camp Grove Wind Farm''' is a 100-turbine [[wind farm]] composed of GE 1.5MW 77 meter rotor and with 80 meter hub height wind turbines  in [[Marshall County, Illinois|Marshall County]] and [[Stark County, Illinois|Stark County]] [[Illinois]],  north of the city of [[Peoria, Illinois|Peoria]].  The owner of the project is Camp Grove Wind Farm LLC, which is owned by subsidiaries of Orion Energy Group LLC (Oakland, CA), Vision Energy, LLC (Cincinnati, OH) and other investors.  The project is managed by Orion Energy Group LLC, and, at 1.5 megawatts per [[General Electric]] turbine, has a nameplate capacity of 150 megawatts (mW).&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.pjstar.com/news/x1773732536/Wind-farm-eyes-expansion |title=Camp Grove wind farm eyes expansion | publisher= [[Peoria Journal-Star]] | date = 2010-05-16 | accessdate = 2011-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The turbine farm began operations in November 2007.  75 mW of the power generated by Camp Grove, approximately one-half of the nameplate capacity, is sold pursuant to a 20-year contract to the [[Appalachian Power]] unit of [[American Electric Power]], a multi-state electrical generation holding company.  60 of the turbines are located in Marshall County, and 40 in the smaller Stark County.  The nearest village is [[Camp Grove, Illinois|Camp Grove]], for which the wind farm is named.&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt;

Other wind farms developed by Orion and Vision include the [[Benton County Wind Farm]] and the [[Fowler Ridge Wind Farm]].

'''Cave of the Crystals''' or '''Giant Crystal Cave''' ({{Lang-es|Cueva de los Cristales}}) is a [[cave]] connected to the [[Naica Mine]] at a depth of {{Convert|300|m}}, in [[Naica]], [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], [[Mexico]].

The main chamber contains giant [[Selenite (mineral)|selenite]] [[crystal]]s ([[gypsum]], CaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;·2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), some of the largest natural crystals ever found.&lt;ref name = "Mystery"/&gt; The cave's largest crystal found to date is {{Convert|12|m|abbr=on}} in length, {{Convert|4|m|abbr=on}} in diameter and 55&amp;nbsp;tons in weight. When it was accessible, the cave was extremely hot, with air temperatures reaching up to {{Convert|58|C}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/04/photogalleries/giant-crystals-cave/|title=Giant Crystal Cave Comes to Light|accessdate=2010-02-07|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209060757/http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/04/photogalleries/giant-crystals-cave/|archivedate=2010-02-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with 90 to 99 percent humidity. The cave is relatively unexplored due to these factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=[[BBC]] |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8466493.stm |title=A rare glimpse of the cave of crystals |work=BBC News |date=19 January 2010 |accessdate=2010-01-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100120051916/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8466493.stm |archivedate=20 January 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Without proper protection, people could only endure approximately ten minutes of exposure at a time.&lt;ref name="Shea"&gt;{{cite web |first=Neil |last=Shea |url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2008/11/crystal-giants/shea-text/1 |title=Crystal palace |work=[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic magazine]] |date=November 2008 |accessdate=2009-06-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090906092603/http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2008/11/crystal-giants/shea-text/1 |archivedate=2009-09-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cave was discovered by the brothers Eloy and Javier Delgado. It has since been allowed to re-flood, with the cavern now filled once more with the water rich in minerals required for the crystals to grow.

A group of scientists known as the ''Naica Project'' have been heavily involved in researching these caverns.&lt;ref name="Project"&gt;{{cite web| title = NAICA Project web site| publisher = NAICA Project| url = http://www.naica.com.mx/english/index.htm| accessdate = 2010-10-22| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110225180318/http://naica.com.mx/english/index.htm| archivedate = 2011-02-25| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation of the crystals==
Naica lies on an ancient [[Fault (geology)|fault]] above an underground [[magma chamber]] which is approximately {{convert|3|-|5|km|mi|sigfig=1}} below the cave. The magma heated the [[ground water]] which was saturated with [[sulfide]] ions (S&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;). Cool [[oxygen]]ated surface water contacted the mineral saturated heated water, but the two did not mix due to the difference in their [[Density|densities]]. The oxygen slowly diffused into the heated water and oxidized the sulfides (S&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;) into [[sulfate]]s (SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;). The hydrated sulfate gypsum [[Crystallization|crystallized]] at an extremely slow rate over the course of at least 500,000 years, forming the enormous crystals found today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/04/070406-giant-crystals.html|title=Giant Crystal Cave's Mystery Solved|last=Lovgren|first=Stefan|date=6 April 2007|newspaper=National Geographic News|access-date=19 February 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170218021356/http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/04/070406-giant-crystals.html|archivedate=18 February 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==
[[File:Naica_Ubicación_de_las_cuevas_en_la_mina.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Location of the Swords and Crystal caves with the gypsum crystals within the idealized block diagram of Naica mine]]

In 1910 miners discovered a cavern beneath the Naica mine workings, the Cave of Swords ({{Lang-es|Cueva de las Espadas}}). It is located at a depth of {{convert|120|m}}, above the Cave of the Crystals, and contains spectacular, smaller ({{convert|1|m|adj=on}} long) crystals.  It is speculated that at this level, transition temperatures may have fallen much more rapidly, leading to an end in the [[Crystal growth|growth of the crystals]].&lt;ref name="Mystery"&gt;{{cite web| last = Lovgren| first = Stefan| title = Giant crystal cave's mystery solved| work = National Geographic News| date = 2007-04-06| url = http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/04/070406-giant-crystals.html| accessdate = 2010-10-22| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100414035227/http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/04/070406-giant-crystals.html| archivedate = 2010-04-14| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Giant Crystal Cave was discovered in April 2000 by miners excavating a new tunnel for the [[Industrias Peñoles]] mining company located in Naica, Mexico,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mindat.org/loc-2308.html |title=Naica, Mun. de Saucillo, Chihuahua, Mexico |website=Mindat.org |accessdate=2014-11-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141116052140/http://www.mindat.org/loc-2308.html |archivedate=2014-11-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; while drilling through the Naica [[Fault (geology)|fault]], which they were concerned would flood the mine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crystalinks.com/mexicocrystals.html |title=Cave of the Giant Crystals, Mexico |website=Chrystalinks.com |accessdate=2014-11-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141216040536/http://www.crystalinks.com/mexicocrystals.html |archivedate=2014-12-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The mining complex in Naica contains substantial deposits of [[silver]], [[zinc]] and [[lead]].

The Cave of Crystals is a horseshoe-shaped cavity in [[limestone]]. Its floor is covered with perfectly faceted crystalline blocks. Huge crystal beams jut out from both the blocks and the floor. The crystals deteriorate in air, so the Naica Project attempted to visually document the crystals before they deteriorate further.&lt;ref name="Visual rescue"&gt;[http://www.naica.com.mx/english/internas/interna2_1.htm Visual rescue] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125093654/http://www.naica.com.mx/english/internas/interna2_1.htm |date=2010-11-25 }} at Naica Project&lt;/ref&gt;

Two other smaller caverns were also discovered in 2000, Queen’s Eye Cave and Candles Cave,&lt;ref name="Visual rescue"/&gt; and a further chamber was found in a drilling project in 2009. The new cave, named Ice Palace, is {{convert|150|m}} deep and is not flooded, but its crystal formations are much smaller, with small "cauliflower" formations and fine, threadlike crystals.

All of the caves discovered are: Cave of Crystals, Queen's Eye, Candles Cave, Ice Palace and Cave of Swords.&lt;ref name="IcePalace"&gt;{{cite web| last = Than| first = Ker| title = Giant crystal caves yield new "Ice Palace," more| work = National Geographic News| date = 2010-10-07| url = http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/10/101007-lost-crystal-caves-mexico-science-mine-superman-ice-palace/| accessdate = 2010-10-21| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101016165100/http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/10/101007-lost-crystal-caves-mexico-science-mine-superman-ice-palace/| archivedate = 2010-10-16| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exploration and scientific studies==
[[File:Gypsum-54542.jpg|thumb|upright|Selenite "sword", {{convert|22.6 × 2.6 × 1.6|cm}}. A small version of the giant crystals, likely found in a natural cavity in the mine.]]
A scientific team coordinated by [[Paolo Forti]], specialist of cave minerals and crystallographer at the [[University of Bologna]] (Italy) explored the cave in detail in 2006. To survive and to be able to work in the extreme temperature and humid conditions which prevent prolonged incursion in the crystal chamber, they developed their own refrigerated suits and cold breathing systems (respectively dubbed Tolomea suit and Sinusit respirator). Special caving overalls were fitted with a mattress of refrigerating tubes placed all over the body and connected to a backpack weighing about {{convert|20|kg}} containing a reservoir filled with cold water and ice. The cooling provided by melting ice was sufficient to provide about half an hour of autonomy.

Beside mineralogical and crystallographic studies, biogeochemical and microbial characterization of the gypsum giant crystals were also performed. [[Stein-Erik Lauritzen]] ([[University of Bergen]], Norway) performed [[uranium-thorium dating]] to determine the maximum age of the giant crystals, about 500,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference| last = Stein-Erik| first = Lauritzen|author2=Constantin Silviu |author3=Paolo Forti| year = 2008| title = Chronology and growth rate of the Naica giant gypsum crystals| conference = 33rd International Geological Congress (IGC)| publisher = UiB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference| last = Sanna| first = L. |author2=Stein-Erik Lauritzen |author3=Paolo Forti| title = Preliminary U/Th dating of gypsum crystals from Naica caves (Mexico)| date = 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Sanna| first = Laura| author2 = Paolo Forti| author3 = Stein-Erik Lauritzen| year = 2011| title = Preliminary U/Th dating and the evolution of gypsum crystals in Naica caves (Mexico)| journal = Acta Carsologica| volume = 40| issue = 1| pages = 17–28| accessdate = 2011-12-31| url = https://www.cristin.no/as/WebObjects/cristin.woa/wa/fres?sort=ar&amp;pnr=45850&amp;la=en&amp;action=sok| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120422053021/https://www.cristin.no/as/WebObjects/cristin.woa/wa/fres?sort=ar&amp;pnr=45850&amp;la=en&amp;action=sok| archivedate = 2012-04-22| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Penelope Boston]] ([[New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology]]), [[speleologist]] and [[geomicrobiologist]] specialist  of [[extremophile]] organisms, realized sterile sampling of [[gypsum]] drillcores by making small boreholes inside large crystals under aseptic conditions. The aim was to detect the possible presence of ancient bacteria encapsulated inside fluid and solid inclusions present the [[calcium sulfate]] matrix from its formation.

Solid inclusions mainly consist of [[brucite|magnesium]] and [[ferrihydrite|iron oxy-hydroxide]] but no [[natural organic matter|organic matter]] could be found associated with the solid hydroxides. No [[DNA]] from ancient [[bacteria]] could be extracted from the solid inclusions and amplified by [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR]].

Microbial studies on [[fluid inclusions]] are foreseen to attempt to evidence the presence of ancient micro-organisms in the original fluid solution in which the crystals developed.

Other researches also cover the fields of [[palynology]] ([[pollen]] study), geochemistry, hydrogeology and the physical conditions prevailing in the Cave of Crystals.

At the 2017 meeting of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] (AAAS), researchers, including Dr. Boston, announced the discovery of bacteria found in inclusions embedded in some of the crystals. Using sterile methods, the researchers were able to extract and reanimate these organisms, which are not closely related to anything in the known genetic databases.&lt;ref name=BBC2017&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-39013829|title=Naica's crystal caves hold long-dormant life|last=Amos|first=Jonathan|date=2017-02-18|newspaper=BBC News|access-date=2017-02-18|language=en-GB|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170219025319/http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-39013829|archivedate=2017-02-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Closure==
The cave was featured on the [[Discovery Channel]] program ''[[Naica: Beyond The Crystal Cave]]'' in February 2011. Exploration has given credence to the existence of further chambers, but further exploration would have required significant removal of the crystals. As the cave's accessibility is dependent on the mine's water pumps, when mineral exploitation is ended in the area it was likely pumping would stop and water level allowed to rise again.&lt;ref name = "Project" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=NAICA: "Beyond the crystal cave and deadly descent" video reveals worlds beneath the Earth’s surface, February 13 on Discovery Channel|publisher=ctvmedia.com|date=February 8, 2011|url=http://www.ctvmedia.ca/discovery/releases/release.asp?id=13468&amp;yyyy=2011|accessdate=18 February 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706174556/http://www.ctvmedia.ca/discovery/releases/release.asp?id=13468&amp;yyyy=2011|archivedate=6 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2017, Penelope Boston reported to the BBC that mining operations had ceased and that the caves have re-flooded.&lt;ref name=BBC2017/&gt;

The '''Composition C''' family is a family of related US-specified [[plastic explosive]]s consisting primarily of [[RDX]]. All can be molded by hand for use in demolition work and packed by hand into [[shaped charge]] devices. Variants have different proportions and plasticisers and include composition C-2, composition C-3, and [[C-4 (explosive)|composition C-4]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Explosives|author1=Rudolf Meyer |author2=Josef Köhler |author3=Axel Homburg |publisher=Wiley-VCH|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''composition'' is used for any explosive material compounded from several ingredients. In particular, in the 1940s the format "Composition &lt;letter&gt;" was used for various compositions of the (relatively) novel explosive RDX, such as [[Composition B]] and other variants.

The original material was developed by the British during [[World War II]], and was used in the [[Gammon bomb]]. It was standardised as Composition C when introduced to US service. This material consisted of 88.3% RDX and a mineral oil-based plasticiser and [[phlegmatized|phlegmatiser]]. It suffered from a relatively limited range of serviceable temperatures, and was replaced by Composition C-2 around 1943.

Composition C-1 contained a slightly smaller proportion of RDX, but used an explosive plasticiser, which contained [[tetryl]], [[nitrocellulose]] and a mixture of nitroaromatics produced during the manufacture of TNT (containing [[trinitrotoluene]], [[dinitrotoluene]] and [[mononitrotoluene]]), and a trace of solvent. While Composition C-3 had a much wider serviceable temperature range than Composition C, it could not be stored at elevated temperatures. Consequently, it was replaced around 1944 by Composition C-4.

Composition C-3 was very similar to Composition C-1, but removed the solvent and varied the exact proportions of plasticisers to improve high temperature storage. It is a yellow, putty-like material. It remained a service item through the [[Korean War]], but had marginal plasticity at the very low temperatures encountered in Korean winters, and was significantly toxic, including by vapour and skin absorption.&lt;ref name=Arb1MemoIsn841&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The [[velocity of detonation]] is about 7600&amp;nbsp;m/s (25,000 feet per second.)

Composition C-3 consists of 77%–85% cyclonite ([[RDX]]) and 15%–23% gel made out of liquid nitro compounds (e.g. liquid [[dinitrotoluene|DNT]] and small amount of [[mononitrotoluene|NT]]) and nitrocellulose or butyl phthalate and nitrocellulose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Chemistry and Technology of Explosives

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first reported and tested compositions of C-3 was very similar to earlier Composition C-2 and contained 77% [[RDX]], 3% [[tetryl]], 4% [[TNT]], 1% [[Nitrocellulose|NC]], 5% [[mononitrotoluene|NT]], and 10% [[dinitrotoluene|DNT]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
The last two compounds (they are very poor explosives) are oily liquids and plasticize the mixture. The most important later innovation of C-3 introduced the non-explosive [[plasticizer]] butyl phthalate instead of this mixture of nitro compounds.  This reduced the toxicity while increasing the concentration of [[RDX]] and improving safety of use and storage. It also opened the way to begin study of new non-explosive low-toxicity plasticizers (esters of dicarboxylic acid) and binder (branched [[polymers]]).

Research on a replacement for C-2 was begun prior to 1950, but the new material, new generation of Composition C ([[C-4 (explosive)|number four, C-4]]), did not begin pilot production until 1956.

Since 1960 the mixture of C-3 has contained:
* 90.0–91.0% of cyclonite ([[RDX]] explosives)
* ~2.1% of polyisobutylene (short chain)
* ~1.6% of motor oil
* ~5.3% of di-(2-ethylhexyl)sebacate (dioctyl sebacate), sometimes it was replaced partly by similar compounds such as dioctyl adipate
* less than 0.6% of water
* (small amount of  marker or odorizing taggant)

It is less volatile than C-4 and has less tendency to harden at low temperature. It has a density 1.48–1.60g/ml, does not become hard even at −55&amp;nbsp;°C (−67&amp;nbsp;°F), and does not exude at +77&amp;nbsp;°C (171&amp;nbsp;°F).
[[C-4 (explosive)|C4]] has a detonation velocity of 8092&amp;nbsp;m/s (26550&amp;nbsp;ft/s) at high density and velocity of 7550&amp;nbsp;m/s (24770&amp;nbsp;ft/s) at low density 1.48&amp;nbsp;g/ml. It is so successful that it remains in [[army]] service up to the current time without any significant changes.

In [[government contracting]], a '''Contract Adjustment Board''' is a department board at the Secretariat level which deals with disputes and requests for extraordinary relief under Public Law 85-804&lt;ref&gt;(72 Stat. 972; 50 U.S.C. 1431)&lt;/ref&gt; of Aug. 28, 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|others=C.

In brief:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ogc.doc.gov/ogc/contracts/cld/rd/gao/2001/B-287121.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090921003716/http://www.ogc.doc.gov/ogc/contracts/cld/rd/gao/2001/B-287121.pdf |archivedate=2009-09-21 |df= }} United States General Accounting Office, ''Decision''&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Public Law No. 85-804, codified at 50 U.S.C. § 1431-35 (Supp. IV 1998), grants to the President the authority to authorize any agency which exercises functions in connection with the national defense to enter into contracts or into amendments or modifications of contracts, and to make advance payments, without regard to other applicable legal provisions whenever such action would facilitate the national defense. 50 U.S.C. § 1431. The legislative history of the statute indicates that it may also be used as the basis for making indemnity payments under certain government contracts, the so-called "residual powers. "  ECR Current Materials at 1005, 1021. The legislative history explains that "[t]he need for indemnity clauses in most cases arises from the advent of nuclear power and the use of highly volatile fuels in the missile program. The magnitude of the risks involved under procurement contracts in these areas have rendered commercial insurance either unavailable or limited in coverage.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History==
During World War I, a "Board of Contract Adjustment" was created to determine "all claims, doubts and disputes which may arise under departmental contracts";&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Government War Contracts|author=Crowell, J.F.|date=1920|publisher=Oxford University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CgcZAAAAYAAJ|page=314|accessdate=2014-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; it implemented the policies for Liquidation, Cancellation, and Adjustment of contracts.&lt;ref name="google3"&gt;{{cite book|title=Government War Contracts|author=Crowell, J.F.|date=1920|publisher=Oxford University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CgcZAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=2014-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Evans Reamer Machine Company v. United States. 386 F.2d 873, "since the early days of World War II," the main defense agencies have been authorized to grant discretionary relief to contractors suffering losses on account of mistakes.&lt;ref&gt;Title II, Section 201, First War Powers Act, 55 Stat. 838 (1941); Executive Order No. 9001, 6 F.R. 6787 (1941); Act of Jan. 12, 1951, 64 Stat. 1257; 50 U.S.C. App. Sec. 611 (1952 ed.); P.L. 85-804, 72 Stat. 972, 50 U.S.C. Secs. 1431–1435 (1958).&lt;/ref&gt; The underpinning for the granting of relief must be a finding that such action would facilitate the national defense or prosecution of the war.&lt;ref&gt;See Kramer, Extraordinary Relief for War Contractors, 93 U. of Pa.L. Rev. 357, 360 (1945); Correction of Mistakes in Contracts Under Public Law 85-804, Government Contracts Monograph No. 1, p. 4 (The Geo. Wash. Univ.) (1961)&lt;/ref&gt; Title II relief has been referred to variously as "far-reaching," "extraordinary," and "a snare and a delusion."&lt;ref&gt;See Fain and Watt, War Procurement — A New Pattern in Contracts, 44 Col. L. Rev. 127, 199 (1944) and McClelland, Title II — One Year Later: A Legislative Midsummer Night's Dream, 62 Dick. L. Rev. 327 (1958)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[U.S. v. Utah Constr. &amp; Mining Co.]], pursuant to a delegation by the President under Public Law 85—804,&lt;ref&gt;Public Law 85—804, 72 Stat. 972, 50 U.S.C. § 1431 (1964 ed.)&lt;/ref&gt; government departments and agencies exercising functions in connection with the national defense may, upon a finding that such action would 'facilitate the national defense,' enter into amendments and modifications of contracts without regard to other provisions of law respecting such amendments and modifications. As implemented by the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]]'s procurement regulations,&lt;ref&gt;see ASPR, 32 CFR § 17.000 et seq.; AECPR, 41 CFR § 9—17.000 et seq.,&lt;/ref&gt; the authority conferred encompasses amendments without consideration, correction of mutual mistakes, and formalization of informal commitments. This authority, which in many respects is analogous to power to settle claims, is delegated to Contract Adjustment Boards established within the departments and agencies concerned separate from the Boards of Contract Appeals. Because the regulations preclude resort to the powers conferred by Public Law 85—804 '(u)nless other legal authority in the Department concerned is deemed to be lacking or inadequate,'&lt;ref&gt;ASPR, 32 CFR § 17.205—1(b)(2)&lt;/ref&gt; the Army Contract Adjustment Board has generally required contractors to exhaust remedies before the ASBCA under the disputes clause.&lt;ref&gt;Blaw-Knox Co., ACAB Dkt. No. 1019, Nov. 2, 1960&lt;/ref&gt; Thus it is quite evident from the administration of Public Law 85—804 and its predecessors that the limitations on the jurisdiction of the Boards of Contract Appeals are well understood by the military procurement departments and Congress.

Elastomers are [[amorphous polymer]]s maintained above their [[glass transition temperature]], so that considerable [[segmental motion|molecular reconformation]], without breaking of [[covalent bonds]], is feasible.

Their primary uses are for [[Seal (mechanical)|seal]]s, [[adhesive]]s and molded flexible parts. Application areas for different types of rubber are [[manifold]] and cover segments as diverse as tires, [[sole (shoe)|soles for shoes]], and [[damping]] and [[Thermal insulation|insulating]] elements. The importance of these rubbers can be judged from the fact that global revenues are forecast to rise to US$56 billion in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ceresana.com/en/market-studies/plastics/synthetic-rubber/market-study-synthetic-rubber.html |title=Market Study on Synthetic Rubber |publisher= Ceresana.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishplastics.co.uk/materials/global-rubber-market-to-generate-56-billion-by-2020/|title=Global rubber market to generate $56 billion by 2020 |publisher=British Plastics and Rubber (BP&amp;R)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|IUPAC]] defines the term "elastomer" by "[[Polymer]] that displays rubber-like elasticity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Definitions of terms relating to the structure and processing of sols, gels, networks, and inorganic–organic hybrid materials (IUPAC Recommendations 2007)|journal=[[Pure and Applied Chemistry]]|year=2007|volume=79|issue=10|pages=1801–1829|doi=10.1351/pac200779101801|url=http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/pdf/2007/pdf/7910x1801.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manufacturers of Elastomeric parts include NoProto, PrintForm, 3D Systems, and Afformativ. 

Rubber-like solids with elastic properties are called elastomers. Polymer chains are held together in these materials by relatively weak [[molecule |intermolecular bonds]], which permit the polymers to stretch in response to macroscopic stresses. [[Natural rubber]], [[neoprene rubber]], [[buna-s]] and [[buna-n]] are all examples of such elastomers.

== Background ==
[[File:Polymer picture.svg|thumb|upright|(A) is an unstressed polymer; (B) is the same polymer under stress. When the stress is removed, it will return to the A configuration. (The dots represent cross-links)]]

Elastomers are usually [[thermoset]]s (requiring [[vulcanization]]) but may also be [[thermoplastic]] (see [[thermoplastic elastomer]]).  The long polymer chains [[cross-link]] during curing, i.e., vulcanizing. The molecular structure of elastomers can be imagined as a 'spaghetti and meatball' structure, with the meatballs signifying cross-links. The elasticity is derived from the ability of the long chains to reconfigure themselves to distribute an applied stress. The covalent cross-linkages ensure that the elastomer will return to its original configuration when the stress is removed. As a result of this extreme flexibility, elastomers can reversibly extend from 5–700%, depending on the specific material. Without the cross-linkages or with short, uneasily reconfigured chains, the applied stress would result in a permanent deformation.

Temperature effects are also present in the demonstrated elasticity of a polymer. Elastomers that have cooled to a glassy or crystalline phase will have less mobile chains, and consequentially less elasticity, than those manipulated at temperatures higher than the glass transition temperature of the polymer.

It is also possible for a polymer to exhibit elasticity that is not due to covalent cross-links, but instead for  [[Thermodynamic theory of polymer elasticity|thermodynamic reasons]].

[[File:Antique-Electrical-Room.jpg|thumb|The back of an antique electrical room, still operational at a US plant as of 2014. All conducting busbars are open and operators must be careful not to touch them.]]

An '''electrical room''' is a room or space in a building dedicated to electrical equipment. Its size is usually proportional to the size of the building; large buildings may have a main electrical room and subsidiary electrical rooms. Electrical equipment may be for power distribution equipment, or for communications equipment.&lt;ref name=TF09&gt;Albert Thumann, Harry Franz, ''Efficient Electrical System Design Handbook'',Fiarmont Press 2009 {{ISBN|0-88173-593-0}} pages 76-77&lt;/ref&gt;

Electrical rooms typically house the following equipment:
*[[Electric switchboard]]s
*[[Distribution board]]s
*[[Circuit breaker]]s and disconnects
*[[Electricity meter]]
*[[Transformer]]s
*[[Busbar]]s
*[[Backup battery|Backup batteries]] in a [[Battery room]]
*[[Fire alarm control panel]]s
*[[Distribution frame]]s
In large building complexes, the primary electrical room may house an indoor [[electrical substation]].

==Construction features==

The construction features of an electrical room vary depending on the scope of the equipment to be installed. Floors may be reinforced to support heavy transformers and switchgear. Walls and ceilings may have to support a heavy [[cable tray]] system or [[busbar]]s. Additional ventilation or air conditioning may be needed, since electrical apparatus gives off heat but the temperature must not rise beyond the tolerance of equipment. Double doors may be installed to allow for maintenance of large equipment.&lt;ref name=TF09/&gt; If utility service entrance equipment and [[Electric meter|metering]] is present in the room, special provisions may be made for access by utility personnel. [[Fire detection]] and [[fire suppression system]]s, such as [[Gaseous fire suppression|carbon dioxide]], may be installed. 

A large electrical room may have extensive provisions for grounding (earthing) and bonding enclosures of electrical equipment to prevent [[stray voltage]] and danger of electric shock, even during faults in the electrical system.  [[Lightning protection]] requires different measures than protection from power-frequency faults. Electrical rooms may have [[electromagnetic shielding]] to prevent interference to nearby sensitive audio or video equipment. In large facilities [[access control]] systems may control admission to the room.

==Regulations==
Layout details and construction of electrical rooms will be controlled by local [[building code]] and electrical code regulations. Requirements for an electrical room relate to fire safety and electrical hazards.  An electrical room is usually required to be secured from access by unauthorized persons; these rules are especially strict where equipment within the room has exposed [[live terminal]]s. Regulations may require two separate means of exit from a room where the power rating of circuits exceeds some threshold, to allow for quick exit in an emergency.&lt;ref&gt;Truman C. Surbrook, Jonathan R. Althouse, ''Interpreting The National Electrical Code 7E'' Cengage Learning, 2004 
{{ISBN|1401852130}},  page 34&lt;/ref&gt;  Rooms containing oil-filled equipment may be required to have fire-resistant construction or active fire suppression equipment in the room and may be designated as an ''electrical vault''.  Since power distribution often requires large numbers of electrical cables, special measures for fire resistance of cables and cable trays may be also specified by regulations. 

In industrial buildings that handle flammable gases or liquids, or combustible dusts, special electrical rooms may be prepared that have ventilation and other measures to prevent an explosion hazard that would otherwise exist with [[electrical equipment in hazardous areas]]. For large installations, it may be less costly overall to use a special room than to install a large number of devices that are resistant to the hazardous conditions. Similarly, in wet or corrosive environments, electrical equipment may be separated in a room that can be protected from the atmospheric conditions. 

Building code and electrical code regulations will dictate minimal working space around equipment to allow safe access during maintenance. Practical design of an electrical room will consider layout of the initial equipment and allow for additions over the economic life of the facility.

'''Environmental emergencies''' are defined as “sudden-onset disasters or accidents resulting from natural, technological or human-induced factors, or a combination of these, that causes or threatens to cause severe environmental damage as well as loss of human lives and property.” (UNEP/GC.22/INF/5, 13 November 2002.)

Following a disaster or conflict, an environmental emergency can occur when people’s health and livelihoods are at risk due to the release of hazardous and noxious substances, or because of significant damage to the ecosystem. Examples include fires, [[oil spill]]s, [[chemical accident]]s, [[toxic waste dump]]ing and [[groundwater pollution]]. 

The environmental risks can be acute and life-threatening. According to the International Disaster Database ([http://www.emdat.be/ EM-DAT]), between 2003 and 2013, there were 380 industrial accidents reported, affecting 207 668 people and resulting in over US$22 million in losses. Climate change is having an unprecedented effect on the occurrence of natural disasters and the associated risk of environmental emergencies. With climate change already stretching the disaster relief system, future climate-related emergency events will generate increased and more costly demands for assistance.


== Context ==
All disasters have some environmental impacts.  

Some of these may be immediate and life-threatening – for example, when an earthquake damages an industrial facility, which in turn releases hazardous materials. In such cases these so-called ‘secondary impacts’ may cause as much damage as the initial causal factor. 

For example, Typhoon Haiyan/Yolanda that struck the Philippines in November 2013, caused massive destruction and had a huge human toll but also generated a spill of around 800,000 litres of heavy oil, when a power barge ran aground in Estancia, Iloilo province, at the height of the typhoon. 

Disasters may also have longeOÑKL-term impacts. For example, natural disasters may cause long-term waste management or [[ecosystem]] damage.

== Major international conferences ==
The Environmental Emergencies Forum is a unique biennial international forum that brings together disaster managers and environmental experts from governments, [[UN]] agencies, industries, academies, NGOs and civil society to improve prevention, preparedness, response and overall resilience to environmental emergencies. It also provides guidance for the Joint UNEP/OCHA Environment Unit, which provides a Secretariat to the meeting. The most recent meeting was held in Norway in June 2015. The next meeting will be held in Nairobi in June 2017.

== Relevant organizations ==

===United Nations===
The Joint [http://www.unep.org/ United Nations Environment Programme] (UNEP)/[http://www.unocha.org/ Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs] (OCHA) Environment Unit (JEU): By pairing the UNEP’s technical expertise with OCHA’s humanitarian response network, the Joint UNEP/OCHA Environment Unit (JEU) mobilizes and coordinates a comprehensive response to environmental emergencies to protect lives, livelihoods, ecosystems and future generations. The JEU can be reached 24 hours/day, seven days/week, all year round and operates at the request of affected countries. The JEU can be called by member states when acute environmental risks to life and health as a result of conflicts, natural disasters and industrial accidents are suspected. 

The JEU hosts the Environmental Emergencies Centre ([http://www.eecentre.org/ www.eecentre.org]),  an online tool designed primarily to provide national responders with a one-stop-shop of all information relevant to the preparedness, prevention and response stages of an environmental emergency.

== Green Star Awards ==
The biennial [http://www.gcint.org/green-star-awards Green Star Awards] recognize individuals, organizations, governments and companies who demonstrate achievements in prevention, preparedness and response to environmental emergencies. A joint initiative between Green Cross International, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), the Green Star Awards seeks to increase awareness of environmental emergencies by drawing attention to efforts made to prevent, prepare for and respond to such emergencies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3759">'''Explosophores''' are [[functional group]]s in [[organic chemistry]] that give organic compounds [[explosive]] properties. 

== History ==
The term was first coined by Russian chemist [[V. Pletz]] in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;Pletz, V. J. Gen. Chem. (U.S.S.R.) 5, 173 (1935)&lt;/ref&gt; and originally mistranslated in some articles as "plosophore". Also of note is an auxoexplose concept (similar to [[chromophore]] and [[auxochrome]] concept), which is a group that modifies the explosive capability of the molecule. 
The term ''explosophore'' has been used more frequently after its use in books such as ''Organic Chemistry of Explosives'' by J. Agrawal and R. Hodgson (2007)'.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}

== Properties ==
Nitrogen-containing explosophores (groups I, II and II below) are particularly strong because in addition to providing oxygen they react to form molecular nitrogen, which is a very stable molecule, and thus the overall reaction is strongly exothermic.  The gas formed also expands, causing the shock wave which is observed. 

== Classification == 
Pletz grouped the explosophores into eight distinct categories.  &lt;ref&gt;Handrick, G.R., Lothrop, W.C. Chem. Rev., 1949, 44 (3) p 419–445&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Warey, Philip. B. ed. New Research on Hazardous Materials, Nova Science Publishers, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that the current list is insufficient and that several other new categories should be added.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}

=== I. −NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, −ON=O and −ONO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ===
These represent
* the [[Nitro compound|nitro group]], in which a nitrogen atom bonds to an organic molecule, 
* the [[nitrite]] group, in which oxygen is bonded to the organic molecule, and 
* nitrate esters, in which a nitrogen atom is located between one oxygen bonded to the organic molecule and the other two oxygen atoms.
By far the most commercially used explosives are nitrate and nitrite based.  

=== II. −N=N− and −N&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;=N&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;=N&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;− ===
The [[azo compound|azo]] and [[azide]] groups respectively, connected to organic/inorganic compounds (e.g. [[Silver azide|AgN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Lead azide|Pb(N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Ammonium azide|NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]])

=== III. −R&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;NX&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; ===
The halogenated nitrogen group X:halogen (for example [[Nitrogen triiodide|NI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[Nitrogen trichloride|NCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]])

=== IV. −C=N−O− ===
The [[fulminate]] group (example [[Fulminic acid|HONC]] and [[Mercury fulminate|Hg(ONC)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]])

=== V. −OClO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and −OClO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ===
The [[chlorate]] and [[perchlorate]] groups respectively, connected to organics/inorganics (e.g. [[potassium chlorate|KClO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[fluorine perchlorate|FOClO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]])

=== VI. −O−O− and −O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;− ===
The [[peroxide]] and [[ozonide]] groups respectively, connected to organics/inorganics (e.g. [[acetone peroxide]], [[Methyl ethyl ketone peroxide|butanone peroxide]])

=== VII. −C≡C&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; M&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ===
The [[acetylide]] group with its metal derivatives

=== VIII. A metal atom connected by an unstable bond to the carbon of certain organic radicals ===
This class contains for instance organic compounds of [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[thallium]], and [[lead]].

=== Other ===
Other substances have been characterised as explosophores outside of the eight classes as defined by Pletz.

A functional group that is frequently considered as an explosophore is [[picrate]], the salts or [[ether]]s of [[picric acid]] (2,4,6-trinitrophenol), which gains its explosive capability from the nitrate groups attached to it.

The '''seventh generation of the [[Ford F-Series]]''' is a line of pickup trucks and medium-duty commercial trucks that was produced by [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] from 1979 to 1986.  For the first time since 1965, the pickup trucks were based upon a completely new chassis and body.  Distinguished by its squarer look, sharper lines and flatter panels, the trucks were designed with improved fuel efficiency in mind; to this end, Ford added its new [[Ford AOD transmission|AOD]] automatic overdrive (four-speed) transmission as an option on light-duty models. The 4-speed manual and 3-speed C6 automatic transmission were retained from previous years. To increase longevity, Ford increased the use of galvanized body panels to fight corrosion.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}  Light Pickups were available in six configurations: Regular Cab, SuperCab (extended cab), or Crew Cab (four full doors), in either 6ft or 8ft bed lengths. They are typically considered to be the last of the "classic" Ford trucks, due to features such as sealed beam headlights that would become obsolete in the next body style.

Along with the body and chassis upgrades, Ford made several changes to the branding of the F-Series over this generation.  In 1981, the upscale Ranger trim was discontinued to create the nameplate for the company's [[Ford Ranger (North America)|all-new compact pickup]] that replaced the Mazda-built [[Ford Courier|Courier]]. Largely superseded by the '''F-150''', the '''F-100''' was discontinued after the 1983 model year, but the F-100 nameplate remained in Argentina.  In Mexico, there was an F-200 introduced in 1976; this variant remained until 1991.

==Design History and Features==

In 1979, Ford debuted a brand new, redesigned F-Series pickup truck line, with the goal of maintaining utility while getting better fuel economy than its previous generation. However, drastic measures were taken in reducing weight, including cutting large holes in the frame; this severely weakened frame rails on model year 1980-1981 trucks, causing them to bend or buckle under load. This frame is known by enthusiasts as the "Swiss cheese frame". This was remedied by 1981 for the 1982 model year, returning the chassis rigidity to the same toughness and strength as the previous generation. Model year 1980–1981 trucks had a plain grille with "FORD" spelled across the front of the hood in chrome lettering, similar to the 1978-1979 models of the previous generation.

The 1982 model year was marked by a slight but important cosmetic change: 1982–86 models had the "FORD" letters above the grille removed, and a Ford oval placed in the center of the grille, with fewer vertical bars in the grille itself. This made the 1982 the first model year to feature the Blue Oval on the front, a trademark of all Ford pickups since, with the exception of the 2010–present F-150 SVT Raptor.&lt;ref&gt;Photo of an early model at [http://static.howstuffworks.com/gif/1980-1989-ford-trucks-6.jpg HowStuffWorks.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The frame was strengthened and the trucks became heavier for 1982; this frame would underpin the F-Series until the 1997 redesign. Grille options included a full chrome grille, a black grille or the standard flat grey plastic grille. The headlight bezels also came in several color options, ranging from light grey, grey, dark grey, and black; with the latter two being the most common.

Introduced for 1980 models, an optional resettable trip meter was installed on speedometers and the mileage counter was moved to the top of the speedometer as part of the optional Sport Instrumentation Group. The Sport Instrumentation Group also included the optional tachometer in the center of the cluster, as well as oil and ammeter gauges.&lt;ref name="lov2xlr8"&gt;http://www.lov2xlr8.no/brochures/ford/81fp/bilder/10.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, the body moulding and interior trim were updated.  In 1985-1986 models, the upper accent mouldings were moved below the front marker. For 1985, the rear tailgate moulding on XLT models was updated and previewed the design of the 1987 model. This molding has become increasingly rare and fetches a high price. A cargo light was available as an option and was included in the Light Group option package.&lt;ref name="lov2xlr8" /&gt; (A Combination Stop/cargo lamp was not required until September 1, 1993 for the 1994 year model.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2004-title49-vol5/xml/CFR-2004-title49-vol5-sec571-108.xml Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards #108: S5.1.1.27]&lt;/ref&gt;)

17 different colors were available, along with two-tone options and a choice of clearcoat or non-clearcoat paint.

Various standard equipment included interesting features such as a coat hook on the driver's side, AM radio (AM/FM and AM/FM Cassette were optional), scuff plates and vent windows. The back of the glove compartment door featured coin slots and cup depressions to hold cups and food similar to a food tray on a train. This was a feature only found on this generation and never on later models. It also showed a diagram with lift points as well as other mechanical information. Sliding rear windows were optional as well as cargo lights, under-hood lights, and many others. Ford offered over 150 options for the seventh-generation F-Series.

==Special Order Equipment==

For 1981,various special order equipment was offered on all F-100, 81 model pickup truck with a V6 motor 250, and 350 models. These are listed below with their respective descriptions.

*'''Batteries:''' F-150, 250, and 350 buyers desiring a battery with a higher reserve capacity to meet the electrical demands imposed by add-on electrical accessories or other job-related operating conditions, can choose from [[Motorcraft]] 75-amp maintenance-free or Gould 90-amp maintenance free batteries.
*'''Alternator:''' To meet all higher-than-normal electrical demands of F-150, 250, and 350 vehicles that would be operated under especially strenuous conditions or equipped with power-draining accessories, special 70- and 100-amp Guilt Trip 717 alternators with transistorized regulators can be ordered.
*'''Radio Interference Suppression, Extended:''' Recommended when the vehicle is to be equipped with a mobile two-way radio, as it reduces ignition noise for clearer communication. Includes the basic standard components plus accessory circuits.
*'''Drain Fill Plugs, Magnetic:''' These special drain plugs contain a permanent magnet which attracts all metal particles that can result from wear during normal operation. These particles can cause severe internal damage or excessive wear. Available for all engine oil drain plugs and selected axle/transmission applications.
*'''Engine, for LPG Conversion:''' Customers desiring LPG (Propane) instead of conventional gasoline will want to order this Special Order option which prepares the 4.9L (300-CID) I-6 engine for propane operation. This engine is specifically engineered to burn gaseous fuel and includes numerous special components for that purpose. Installation of an LPG fuel/carburetion system is the buyer's responsibility and must be accomplished within 90 days or 500 miles (whichever comes first) or the warranty is voided.
*'''Hood Release, Inside Locking:''' This security helps protect against theft by making it difficult for a thief to gain access to the engine compartment. A thief cannot simply reach into the drivers compartment and pop open the hood using the standard inside hood release. The hood release can be activated only after being unlocked with the door key. This item is included in the Security Lock Group which is also available on all F-Series pickup models.
*'''Windshield Wipers, Interval:''' Through Special Order, F-Series pickup buyers can take advantage of the convenience of interval windshield wipers without having to order the complete Convenience Group. By Allowing the driver to select an interval from approximately one to 12 seconds for intermittent sweeps of the wipers, interval wipers can be the ideal feature for driving in a light rain or road spray.
*'''Hand Throttle:''' Locking and non-locking types are available to allow control of engine rpm from dashboard. Locking type is especially useful when the trucks engine is used to drive an accessory unit with high power demands, such as a winch or compressor. Throttle can be set part-way open while the driver is outside of the cab doing other jobs. Available on all models with the 4.9L and 5.8L engines. Not available with speed control or engine usage indicator.
*'''Engine Usage Indicator:''' Hobbs Hour Meter Engine Usage indicator records actual engine hours of operation-whether idling or on road. Essential for construction contractors or fleet operators who base maintenance intervals on running time rather than mileage.
*'''Mirrors, Dual-Head:''' An expanded field of vision to the rear and both sides of the truck is available by ordering these dual-head mirrors. Each of the western-type mirror frames holds two 6x6-inch mirrors-a flat one which provides a standard rear view with objects in proper perspective and a convex one which offers a panoramic view to eliminate blind spots. Especially helpful for trailer towing.
*'''Windshield, Tinted:''' With this Special Order option, [[tinted glass]] can be ordered for the windshield only, instead of all the vehicles windows. The tinted windshield offers the benefit of reduced glare for the driver on bright, sunny days, plus it costs less than Tinted Glass, Complete option-especially on crew cab or SuperCab models.
*'''Cargo Lamp:''' Illuminates area for more convenient nighttime loading and unloading. Included with Light Group.
*'''Stabilizer Bar, Front:''' Offers improved handling on F-250/350 4x2 models. Exerts stress between the front wheels to increase vehicle stability and minimize sway, especially under heavy loads or rough terrain. Available with gasoline engines only.
*'''Gas Cap, Locking:''' This Special Order option is offered specifically for the buyer who would like to order an F-Series pickup equipped with a locking gas cap to help safeguard the vehicles fuel tank, but does not wish to spend the extra money needed to purchase the entire Security Lock Group. This option allows him to order it with the vehicle, rather than having to go out and buy one separately after the vehicle is in service.
*'''Axles, Rear:''' 8200-Pound Limited Slip; Offers the F-350 Dual-Rear Wheel Regular Chassis Cab 4x2 buyer with improved traction characteristics of a Limited-Slip differential. The Limited-Slip differential automatically transfers most of the driving power from the drive wheel with the least traction to the drive wheel with the most traction. Helps prevent vehicle from becoming stuck in mud, sand, ice and snow. This axle can be ordered with a 3.54, 3.73 or 4.10 ratio.
**Wide Track: Approximately seven to nine inches wider than the standard axle, this special axle allows F-350 dual-rear-wheel Chassis Cab buyers to install special bodies (such as the popular rescue wagon) that are significantly larger than would otherwise be possible.

==Trim==
This generation saw two different sets of trim levels:

For 1980 and 1981, there was:
*'''Custom:''' Base model, usually equipped with manual locks/windows, color-keyed vinyl seat and dashboard, and black rubber floor mat. However, a Custom trim truck could still share some of the same options as the higher-trim trucks. A steering wheel cover and Ford logo above the radio was optional. Chrome door handles outside the cab to hoist the driver up and into the cab were also optional. On trucks without air conditioning, vents were not installed into the dashboard, giving the driver only two choices for air direction: "Defrost" and "Heat", with "Heat" on a non-A/C truck being the equivalent of "Floor" on a truck with A/C. The lack of vents on the dashboard does have an advantage, as it leaves room for the installation of aftermarket gauges.
*'''Ranger:''' Intermediate trim that added a color-keyed floor mat, chrome trim on the door panels, and Rosewood dash and horn pad trim.
*'''Ranger XLT:''' A step up from the Ranger that added unique seat trim, a color-keyed headliner, color-keyed carpeting, aluminum tailgate trim and full floor to roof trim moldings behind the seat. Also included pinstriping if ordered, synthetic wood, cloth seats and various other interior options.
*'''Ranger Lariat:''' A step above the Ranger XLT that added a plusher interior, and Rosewood Trim on the door panels that matched the Rosewood trim on the dash. Ranger Lariats also featured special "Lariat" emblems on the cab, as well as special Ranger Lariat script above the radio.
*'''Explorer:''' A limited edition options and trim group with year-specific stripes unique to the Explorer. offered as Explorer Package A, B, C, or D. Explorer Package A was the most basic, similar to the Custom, while the Explorer Package D was the highest level, much like the Ranger Lariat.&lt;ref&gt;1981 F-series Explorer Brochure&lt;/ref&gt;

For 1982–1986:
*'''Base:''' Similar to the Custom of the previous years.
*'''FS:''' A Fuel Saving special with the four-speed overdrive transmission and the 300-ci six. Not offered in California.
*'''XL:''' Replaced the intermediate Ranger trim for the 1982 model year, as the Ranger name would be used for Ford's new compact truck.
*'''XLS:''' A new trim level that featured a blacked-out grille, bumpers, headlight bezels, and windshield trim. It also featured a stripe graphics package and black and silver dash trim. Available exterior colors were red, silver, black, and very rare brite blue.
*'''XLT Lariat:''' Featured floor carpeting, color-keyed headliner, a standard chrome grille, and optional power windows/door locks. Woodgrain trim on the door panels was phased after the 1984 model year, as 1985–1986 models had a carpeted section applied to the door panels. For 1985 models, the tailgate trim was changed to a "flat" full width aluminum with a red "reflector" towards the bottom with chrome FORD letters.
*'''Explorer:''' A limited edition options and trim group with optional year specific stripes unique to the Explorer–  The Explorer trim line (1968–1986) was dropped for the 1987 models. Explorer packages changed every year, and were only offered for a limited time each model year.
*'''Eddie Bauer:''' Introduced for 1985, an outdoors-themed interior trim package with two-tone exterior paint. Originally only offered on the Bronco and Bronco II, the Eddie Bauer trim would eventually make its way to the F-Series line-up by the end of 1994 (1995 model year).

== Powertrain ==
The seventh-generation F-Series marked a major transition in the powertrains used by the pickup line. As before, the standard engine was a carbureted [[Ford straight-six engine#300|300 cubic-inch inline-6]]. For 1982, this was supplemented by a [[Ford Essex V6 engine (Canadian)#232|3.8 L]] V6 borrowed from the [[Ford Fox platform|Fox platform]]; it was dropped after 1983 as the result of slow sales.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} The standard V8 remained the 302 Windsor V8.  To further boost fuel efficiency, a downsized 255 cubic-inch version of the 302 Windsor V8 was made an option; it proved unpopular and was dropped after 1983. As Ford streamlined its small-block V8 engine lineup, the [[Ford 335 engine#351|351M]] was replaced by the 351 Windsor.  Initially, the largest engine offered was the [[Ford 335 engine#400|400]] V8 carried over from the previous generation; it was available only in F-350 and certain F-250 models.   As similar-size engines were discontinued by General Motors and Chrysler during the late 1970s, the 400 was discontinued after 1982.

In 1982, the 460 V8 made its return as the replacement for the 400 on 1983 models.  Coinciding with the reintroduction of the big-block 460, Ford introduced another engine offering for buyers seeking higher-output engines.  Largely a response to General Motors, who had offered diesel-engined pickups since 1977, Ford produced their first North American diesel F-Series in 1982, while in Argentina the F-100 carried over the same 3.3L Perkins 4.203 available since the 3rd generation F-series.  Rather than develop its own engine (as GM had), the 6.9 L ''[[International Harvester IDI|IDI]]'' V8 was the product of a joint venture with [[International Harvester]]. The 460 was first offered in 4x4s in 1983 as an option on 1984 models. Up until that point, it had never been offered in 4WD models.

In 1984, the 302 Windsor was available with electronic fuel injection as an option on 1985 models; a year later, it became standard (an industry first for full-size pickups). The F-150 equipped with the 3-speed manual transmission was the second-to-last American vehicle to have a column-shifted manual transmission; it was discontinued after 1986, a year before similar Chevrolet and GMC models. {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

The heavy duty Ford C6 3-speed automatic transmission, marketed as the "Select-Shift" automatic, was the standard automatic transmission all years and came paired with most engine options if ordered. Various transfer cases were used, most built by New Process Gear. NP205 and NP208F cases were most common. Each feature a stick-shift 4WD engagement, with 4 speeds: 4 Low, 4 High, Neutral and 2 High. Various Borg-Warner transfer cases were also used.

== Axles, Differentials, and Suspension==
This generation was the first time Ford used [[Independent suspension]] on their full size 4x4 trucks, as well as being the first time any of the [[Big Three (automobile manufacturers)]] made a 4x4 full size truck without a solid front axle. Ford and [[Dana Holding Corporation]] called this the [[Twin Traction Beam]] or TTB and used many of Dana Spicer parts. The F-150 used a light duty [[Dana 44]] TTB. From 1979-1984, the rear axle was typically a [[Ford 9-inch axle]], with the [[Ford 8.8 axle]] being phased gradually until the 9" was finally phased out before the 1987 model year. The F-250 used an 8 lug version of the [[Dana 44]] TTB called the Dana 44 TTBHD with the [[Dana 50]] TTB being an option. The rear was a [[Dana 60]] until mid 1985 when Ford phased out that axle for their own [[Sterling 10.5 axle|Sterling 10.25]]. Dana 60s could be either full float or semi float and came with a range of gear ratios. Semi float Dana 60s were either c-clip style, which utilize c-clips to hold the axle shafts in, or pressed in bearings which held the axles in with a special wheel bearing that bolted to the outer axle housing inside the brake drum. These were typically used in lighter duty trucks. Up until then, early 1985 models were built with left over 1984 materials, making some parts tough to find. The F-350 used the Dana 50 TTB in front until a mid-year change in 1985, when the F-350 was fitted with the Dana 60 solid front axle. F-250s could be ordered with a Dana 50 TTB if it was a heavier duty model; all other F-250's were equipped with a Dana 44 TTB. These trucks were leaf sprung and used a single gas shock with no coil springs and radius arms like on the F-150. For the rear axle the F-350 trucks used a Dana 60 for the single rear wheel trucks and a [[Dana 70]] for the dual rear wheel trucks until 1985 when Ford once again phased in their own Sterling axle. Factory lifts used 2" blocks on the rear suspension, or 2" front and 4" rear on HD trucks, usually on F250s and higher trims. Heavier duty F150s could be ordered with 2" blocks.

== Medium-Duty F-Series ==
[[File:Ford F600 lighting maintenance truck Port Chester.jpg|thumb|right|Ford F600 lighting maintenance truck]]
[[File:Engine13ANF.jpg|thumb|Ford F800 fire engine]]
For the first time since 1967, the medium-duty version of the F-Series (F-600 and above) were completely redesigned.  Again sharing a common cab and interior with the pickup trucks, the medium-duty trucks were distinguished by separate bodywork ahead of the firewall.  For the first time since the 1957  "Big Job" trucks, the fenders were separate from the hood; although a traditional rear-hinged hood was standard, the optional forward-tilting hood (in the style of the larger [[Ford L-Series Trucks|L-Series]] trucks) quickly overtook it in popularity.  Alongside the standard two-door cab, the medium-duty F-Series was available with a four-door crew cab.

Sharing exterior styling derived from the larger L-Series trucks, the medium-duty F-Series saw few changes through the 1980s. As a running change during 1983, the truck adapted the Ford Blue Oval for the 1984 model year, becoming the last Ford vehicle to do so. After that change, the medium-duty F-Series would not see any exterior change (aside from engine badging) until its 1995 facelift (consisting of a new hood, fenders, and headlights). Although the cab itself was shared with F-Series pickup trucks produced afterward, the MY 1980-1986 interior of the medium-duty F-Series was carried over entirely and used until the medium-duty F-Series was discontinued in 1998.

The medium-duty F-Series was initially produced with several engines. Two gasoline V8 engines were available, a 370 cubic-inch V8 and a 429 cubic-inch V8; both engines were [[Ford 385 engine|versions of the 460 V8]].  In 1991, the 370 was discontinued, with the 7.0L V8 (429) becoming standard. At its launch, two diesels were offered: the Detroit Diesel 8.2L "Fuel Pincher" V8 was offered alongside the Caterpillar 3208 V8; Caterpillar-powered vehicles were re-designated Ford "F-8000" (adding an extra "0" to the model name). During the late 1980s, the Caterpillar and Detroit Diesel engines are replaced by 6.6L and 7.8L inline-6 diesels produced in a joint venture between Ford and New Holland in Brazil. In 1992, the Ford-New Holland engines are both replaced by a Cummins 5.9L inline-6 diesel.

'''Friedel oscillations'''&lt;ref name=HarrisonTheory&gt;
{{cite book |author= W. A. Harrison |title=Solid State Theory |year=1979 |publisher= Dover Publications |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5Y_Z4F95cacC |isbn=978-0-486-63948-2 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;, named after French physicist [[Jacques Friedel]], arise from localized perturbations in a metallic or semiconductor system caused by a defect in the [[Fermi gas]] or [[Fermi liquid]].&lt;ref name="gravitynlevity"&gt;{{Cite web | date=June 2, 2009 | website=Gravity and Levity | title=Friedel Oscillations: wherein we learn that the electron has a size | url=http://gravityandlevity.wordpress.com/2009/06/02 | access-date=December 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Friedel oscillations are a quantum mechanical analog to [[Electric field screening|electric charge screening]] of charged species in a pool of ions. Whereas electrical charge screening utilizes a point entity treatment to describe the make-up of the ion pool, Friedel oscillations describing fermions in a Fermi fluid or Fermi gas require a quasi-particle or a scattering treatment. Such oscillations depict a characteristic exponential decay in the fermionic density near the perturbation followed by an ongoing sinusoidal decay resembling [[sinc function]].

==Scattering description==

The electrons that move through a [[metal]] or [[semiconductor]] behave like [[Free electron model|free electrons]] of a [[Fermi gas]] with [[plane wave]]-like [[wave function]], that is

:&lt;math&gt;\psi_{\mathbf{k}}(\mathbf{r}) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\Omega}} e^{i \mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{r}}&lt;/math&gt;.

Electrons in a metal behave differently than particles in a normal gas because electrons are [[Fermion|fermions]] and they obey [[Fermi–Dirac statistics]]. This behaviour means that every '''k'''-state in the gas can only be occupied by two electrons with opposite [[Spin (physics)|spin]]. The occupied states fill a sphere in the [[Electronic band structure|band structure]] '''k'''-space, up to a fixed energy level, the so-called [[Fermi energy]]. The radius of the sphere in '''k'''-space, ''k''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;, is called the [[Fermi energy|Fermi wave vector]].

If there is a foreign atom embedded in the metal or semiconductor, a so-called [[impurity]], the electrons that move freely through the solid are scattered by the deviating potential of the impurity. During the scattering process the initial state wave vector '''k'''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; of electron wave function is scattered to  a final state wave vector '''k'''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;. Because the electron gas is a [[Fermi gas]] only electrons with energies near the Fermi level can participate in the scattering process because there must be empty final states for the scattered states to jump to. Electrons that are too far below the Fermi energy ''E''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; can't jump to unoccupied states. The states around the Fermi level that can be scattered occupy a limited range of '''k'''-values or wavelengths. So only electrons within a limited wavelength range near the Fermi energy are scattered resulting in a density modulation around the impurity like

:&lt;math&gt;\rho(\mathbf{r}) = \rho_0 + \delta n \frac{\cos(2 k_{\rm F}|\mathbf{r}| + \delta)}{|\mathbf{r}|^3}&lt;/math&gt;.{{Explain|reason=no more details about the equation|date=August 2018}}

==Qualitative description==

In the classic scenario of electric charge screening, a dampening in the electric field is observed in a mobile charge-carrying fluid upon the presence of a charged object. Since electric charge screening considers the mobile charges in the fluid as point entities, the concentration of these charges with respect to distance away from the point decreases exponentially. This phenomenon is governed by [[Poisson–Boltzmann equation]].&lt;ref&gt;Hans-Jürgen Butt, Karlheinz Graf, and Michael Kappl, ''Physics and Chemistry of Interfaces'', Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The quantum mechanical description of a perturbation in a one-dimensional Fermi fluid is modelled by the [[Luttinger liquid|Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid]].&lt;ref&gt;D. Vieira ''et al''., “Friedel oscillations in one-dimensional metals: From Luttinger’s theorem to the Luttinger liquid”, ''Journal of Magnetism and Magnetic Materials'', vol. 320, pp. 418-420, 2008. ,[https://arxiv.org/abs/0710.0358], (arXiv Submission)&lt;/ref&gt; The fermions in the fluid that take part in the screening cannot be considered as a point entity but a wave-vector is required to describe them. Charge density away from the perturbation is not a continuum but fermions arrange themselves at discrete spaces away from the perturbation. This effect is the cause of the circular ripples around the impurity.

''N.B. Where classically near the charged perturbation an overwhelming number of oppositely charged particles can be observed, in the quantum mechanical scenario of Friedel oscillations periodic arrangements of oppositely charged fermions followed by spaces with same charged regions.''&lt;ref name="gravitynlevity" /&gt;

'''Hotel Energy Management''' is the practice of controlling procedures, operations and equipment that contribute to the energy use in a [[hotel]] operation. This can include electricity, gas, water or other natural resources. Because hotels can have complicated operations and extensive facilities they utilize many different types of energy resources. Hotel energy usages are tracked and classified by the [[U.S. Department of Energy]] and statistics are regularly published in the [[Energy Information Administration]] annual reports.

==Current practices==
Modern practices to control energy usage includes contributions by the guests themselves which has been popularized by information cards requesting guests to save water by letting hotel housekeeping staff know if they would care to re-use towels and bed linens. This reduces the amount of water and/or cleaning substances used by the hotel laundry department which also reduces the expense to the property owner or manager.

Recently consultants have developed entire organizations for advising hotels regarding inefficient usage of energy and optimizing its usage. Some of these consultants participate by providing the products to implement their advice for a share of the cost savings as their conaideration. These companies have proliferated over the years as public and business energy concerns grow and are popularly known as [[Energy Service Company|ESCO]]'s (Energy Service COmpanies). Other practices include using Infrared [[motion sensor]]s, door contacts, and other means to [[occupancy sensor|detect occupancy]] to control the Heating, Ventilating and Air Conditioning systems ([[HVAC]]) when guests forget to switch off when they leave their room.&lt;ref name="lat"&gt;{{cite news |title=Do hotel thermostats with motion sensors have you waking up in a sweat? |author=Catharine Hamm |date=February 16, 2015 |publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|url=http://www.latimes.com/travel/deals/la-tr-spot-20150215-story.html |accessdate=May 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Turning off the lights when a room is not occupied is called [[smart lighting]].

Hotel facility managers are using cloud-based software nowadays to manage their energy efficiency projects. The Department of Energy (DOE) Software Directory describes EnergyActio software, a cloud based platform designed for this purpose.  

Energy management markets in general have been going through several changes including the shift to service based models or performance contracted models used by Energy Services Companies (ESCOs).  Traditionally ESCOs did not address the hotel segment because of the small values associated with hotel energy retrofits and the difficulty in measuring so many potential load sources.

Kenya national government and media have been largely positive about the economic benefits from the coal plant activity.&lt;ref name="Set"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.businessdailyafrica.com/Corporate-News/Lamu-coal-plant-firms-pledge-1-000-jobs/-/539550/2613494/-/item/0/-/snjra3z/-/index.html |title=Lamu Coal Plant Firms Pledge 1,000 New Jobs for Locals | first=Neville | newspaper=[[Business Daily Africa]] |date=5 February 2015 |location=Nairobi | last=Otuki |accessdate=5 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, community advocates and some local government officials expressed concern over whether the benefits would be well distributed, whether the jobs would really materialise, and the lack of discussion over possible negative effects from the project.&lt;ref name="Conditions" /&gt;

As of June 2017, recent coverage has centred on the lack of economic viability and need for the proposed Lamu coal plant, citing a range of experts in news and analysis pieces. International accountability organisations also raised concerns in a series of global blog posts.&lt;ref&gt;https://medium.com/@deCOAL/media-coverage-of-lamu-coal-plant-98309a72e9de&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
The power station would be located on {{convert|975.4|acre|0}} in the Kwasasi area, about {{convert|21|km|0}} north of the town of [[Lamu]] in [[Lamu County]], along Kenya's [[Indian Ocean]] coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.businessdailyafrica.com/1-400-Chinese-workers-to-build-Sh200bn-Lamu-coal-plant/539546-3310542-item-0-b28astz/index.html | title=1,400 Chinese workers to build Sh200bn Lamu coal plant | date=25 July 2016 | first=Kiarie | last=Njoroge | newspaper=[[Business Daily Africa]] | location=Nairobi | accessdate=25 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is approximately {{convert|250|km|mi}}, by air, north-east of [[Mombasa]].

==Overview==
Construction was expected to begin in September 2015 and last approximately 21 months. Once constructed, it will be the largest single power station in Kenya. The power generated will be transmitted to [[Nairobi]], the country's capital, via a new {{convert|520|km|mi}}, 400 kiloVolt electricity transmission line.

Community activists and some local officials have also raised the need for revenue sharing for the community, and what conditions would be set for the project to ensure it would benefit the host community, citing the fact that community members affected by the earlier oil infrastructure project known as [[Lamu Port and Lamu-Southern Sudan-Ethiopia Transport Corridor]] have not been compensated.&lt;ref name="Conditions"/&gt; Community, Kenyan and international activists and one of the world's leading economists [[Joseph Stiglitz]] have raised serious concerns about the environmental and human health implications of the fossil fuel plant.

The plant will cause massive pollution according to various reports including John Musingi PhD, a senior lecturer and Programme Coordinator of Environment Planning and Management, in the Department of Geography and Environmental Studies, at [[Nairobi University]].&lt;ref name="14R"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.reporter.co.ke/2017/05/28/showdown-looms-at-nema-over-sh-210b-lamu-coal-plant/ |title=Showdown looms at Nema over Sh 210b Lamu coal plant |date=28 May 2017 |author=Patrick Mayoyo |publisher=Daily Reporter |location=Nairobi |accessdate=11 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no demand for the proposed 1,050 Mw of power in Kenya to date or for the foreseeable future as Kenya is sufficient in energy generation at this time.

China is seen to be exporting second hand coal plants to Africa and the expense of the African Nations that take them on. Ernest Niemi, an economist and president of Natural Resource Economics, who has done studies on coal plants across the world for over 40 years, said that operating the AMU Power coal plant to produce electricity will be cheap for the developers but expensive as an energy source to consumers and detrimental to the society in general.&lt;ref name="16R"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2017/06/05/is-the-lamu-coal-power-plant-a-poisoned-chalice-to-the-economy_c1571770 |title=Is the Lamu coal power plant a poisoned chalice to the economy? |date=5 June 2017 |newspaper=[[The Star (Kenya)]] |location=Nairobi |first=Ramadhan |last=Rajab |accessdate=11 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Testifying before the National Environmental Tribunal in Nairobi in June 2017, the US-based consultant said Kenya will incur a massive health burden coupled with deaths with the operation of the plant.&lt;ref name="16R"/&gt; Studies across the world, he said, show that the social cost of running coal-fired power plants exceeds the economic benefits.&lt;ref name="16R"/&gt;

[http://www.savelamu.org Save Lamu] has tabled numerous malpractices by Kenya National Environmental Management Authority (Nema), in approving the license to Amu Power. The right to comment to the public hearing was for every Kenyan, and the ERC failure to identify an accessible and safe venue for all was a clear plan to keep opposition away from the hearing.&lt;ref name="17R"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.decoalonize.org/erc-approval-of-lamu-coal-plant/ |title=False Claims on Approval by the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) of the Lamu Coal Plant |date=31 March 2017 |location=Kenya | publisher=Decoalonize | accessdate=11 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Secretary-General of Save Lamu, Walid Ahmed, said that, on several occasions, ERC had tried to lock out Lamu residents and activists from attending their meetings and airing their views concerning the coal plant project.&lt;ref name="18R"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/news/Activists-oppose-Lamu-coal-plant/539546-3862858-wg3rkp/index.html |title=Activists say agencies forcing coal plant on Lamu people |date=24 March 2017 |newspaper=[[Business Daily Africa]] |first=Kalume |last=Kazungu |location=Nairobi |accessdate=11 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Walid Ahmed also said that residents have not been provided with enough time to go through the environmental and social impact assessment report that was released by Amu Power Company in order for the residents to give their opinion. "Even before they approved the project, they had already shown signs of locking us out including changing planned venues for public hearing on the coal project. We will not relent. We will fight till the end. Our fishermen, mangrove harvesters and the population at large have a stake in sustainable environment that is free from pollution. The coal plant is harmful and is likely to affect the marine ecosystem and the livelihoods of our people. We won't accept it," said Mr Walid.&lt;ref name="18R"/&gt;

Save Lamu Coordinator Khadija Shekue Famau said that despite the concerns raised, there are no proper mitigation measures that the investor has put in place or even explained to the communities and stakeholders how emissions from the plant will be handled.&lt;ref name="18R"/&gt;

A former chairman of the Energy Regulatory Commission estimates that capacity charges would be Sh36 billion per year.&lt;ref name="19R"&gt;{{cite news |location=Nairobi |url=http://www.businessdailyafrica.com/Ministry-drops-plans-for-700MW-gas-power-plant/-/539546/3180852/-/10rg3kh/-/index.html | title=Ministry drops plans for 700MW gas power plant |date=28 April 2016 |newspaper=[[Business Daily Africa]] |first=Neville |last=Otuki |accessdate=28 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In January 2014, the [[Government of Kenya]] sourced for bids from private developers to build, own, and operate the power station. In September 2014, the development rights were awarded to a consortium of the following entities:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.centum.co.ke/index.php/all-documents/announcements/57-960-mw-coal-power-project/file |title=A Consortium Led By Kenyan Companies; Gulf Energy Limited &amp; Centum Investment Company Limited, Emerges As The Winning Bidder of The Mega Lamu Coal 1000MW Project|date=1 September 2014|publisher=[[Centum Investments]] (Centum) |accessdate=24 January 2015 |deadurl=yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141022114807/http://www.centum.co.ke/index.php/all-documents/announcements/57-960-mw-coal-power-project/file |archivedate=22 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Gulf Energy - An independent Kenyan energy generating company
* [[Centum Investments]] - A private equity firm, headquartered in Nairobi, with investments in Kenya and Uganda.
* Sichuan Electric Power Design and Consulting Company Limited (SEDC) - A subsidiary of Power Construction Corporation of China (PowerChina)

Two of the losing bidders challenged the award in court. An arbitration tribunal, however, upheld the award in January 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=15 January 2015 |newspaper=[[The Standard (Kenya)|The Standard]]|url= http://www.standardmedia.co.ke/entertainment/pulse/article/2000148008/tribunal-backs-centum-consortium-s-sh170b-coal-power-plant-tender-win |title=Tribunal Backs Centum Consortium's KSh170 Billion Coal Power Plant Tender Win |agency=Reuters|location=Nairobi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wins"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.businessdailyafrica.com/Centum-wins-Sh164bn-coal-plant-case/-/539546/2588460/-/item/0/-/15snod8z/-/index.html| title=Centum Wins KSh164 Billion Coal Power Plant Tender Case| date=14 January 2015|last=Wasuna|first=Brian |newspaper=[[Business Daily Africa]]|location=Nairobi |accessdate=24 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Developers and financing==
The power station will be built using private funds on a build-own-operate model. The developers will own and operate the plant for 25 years from commissioning. The expected construction costs for the coal plant will be about US$2 billion (KES:180 billion). Of this, approximately US$500 million will be generated internally while the balance will be borrowed.&lt;ref name="Wins"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=28 March 2015| url= http://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/business/Construction-of-coal-powered-plant-to-begin-in-September/-/2560/2668674/-/bd73kmz/-/index.html |last=Otieno|title=Construction of Coal-Powered Plant To Begin In September| newspaper=[[The EastAfrican]] | first=Jeff|location=Nairobi |accessdate=28 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program''' ('''LIHEAP''') is a United States federal social services program first established in 1981 and funded annually through [[United States Congress|Congressional]] appropriations.  The mission of LIHEAP is to assist [[low income]] households, particularly those with the lowest incomes that pay a high proportion of household income for home energy, primarily in meeting their immediate home energy needs. The program, part of the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] (HHS), is funded by grants appropriated from the federal government.

== Funding distribution ==
Funding is distributed to each of the fifty states, U.S. territories and tribal governments through the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] (HHS). Administration of the program is left up to state, territorial or tribal governments. Congress also provides the [[President of the United States]] with limited contingency funds each year, which are reserved for emergency situations and released at the President's discretion.

State legislatures often provide additional appropriations each year to supplement federal LIHEAP funds.

LIHEAP offers one-time financial assistance to qualifying low-income households who require support in paying their home heating or cooling bills. Applicants must have an income less than 150% of federal poverty level or 60% of state median poverty level to be eligible, however some states have expanded their programs to include more households (for example, in [[Massachusetts]], applicants must be within 60% of the estimated State Median Income).&lt;ref&gt;Fiscal Year 2012 LIHEAP Annual Report&lt;/ref&gt;

The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) provides funding assistance to low-income households, targeting those who are truly vulnerable: the disabled, elderly, and families with preschool-age children.  Funding is distributed to states or other governmental entities, who administer the program and stems from four sources including: Block grants, the Residential Energy Assistance Challenge Program, Contingency Funds, and Leveraging Incentive Programs.  Allocations are based on local climate, economic, and demographic formulas.  Additional funds may be available in emergency situations or as match funds when contributions are provided by local governments, private businesses, or non-profit organizations.  Final distribution of funds is conducted through the program grantees, which are able to design their programs to meet consumer needs while adhering to the goals and policies of LIHEAP.

In most states, the program is run on a first come-first served basis. This typically results in a rush to apply and receive assistance, because once the funding pool is empty most energy assistance offices close their doors. In some states, the [[State legislature (United States)|legislature]] or [[governor]] may make a politically popular gesture of extending eligibility to additional individuals through an emergency bill or executive order, even though this may result in funds being claimed earlier in the winter season.

The Home Energy Assistance Target (H.E.A.T.) program is the State of Utah's program through which funds are distributed to the target population.  This program is specifically administered by the state and various Associations of Governments (AOG).  The Mountain land AOG provides H.E.A.T. assistance to persons in Utah, Wasatch, and Summit Counties.

Many state LIHEAP agencies also offer [[weatherization]] support, in which contractors are sent to residences to make physical changes to help retain heat or install more fuel-efficient furnaces. Occasionally, acceptance of the weatherization process is mandatory with approval for LIHEAP assistance.

Some states have attempted to enact Percentage of Income Payment (PIP) plans within or in addition to the traditional LIHEAP block grant model.  Although overall funding has increased since 2002, future funding may be limited due to the recent trend in cutting the budget based on building codes requiring energy efficiency, modern appliances with low energy use standards, and concerns about federal budget sustainability. As the program moves forward, the budget being cut along with the rise of applicants are the two major challenges it faces.

==History==

LIHEAP history began in 1980 when congress created the Low Income Energy Assistance Program (LIEAP), as part of the Crude Oil Windfall Profits Tax Act to answer the concerns of the rising energy prices of the 1970s.  In 1981, LIEAP was replaced with LIHEAP as part of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act.  In 1984, the Human Services Reauthorization Act added a new goal to provide funds for cooling costs of low-income households.  Congress also required the use of more recent population and energy data, which meant the shifting of funds from solely cold-weather states to warm-weather states.  In 1988, there was another major change where the National Center for Appropriate Technology (NCAT) started to operate the LIHEAP Clearinghouse.

==Administration==

LIHEAP is administered by the Department of Health and Human Services.  Several federal divisions provide oversight and direction to the program.  These include the Administration for Children and Family Services, the Office of Community Services, and the Division of Energy Assistance.  The National Center for Appropriate Technology is an additional advisory body in the program before funds are given to grantees.  
The federal government does not provide LIHEAP assistance to the public.  Instead, the federal government provides funds to states, federal or state-recognized Indian tribes, tribal organizations, and insular areas to administer.

Groups who receive funds are considered grantees in the program.  LIHEAP grantees have flexibility to design their programs, within very broad federal guidelines, to meet the needs of their citizens.  Each state may have varying departments or divisions to disseminate funds. Shown above is the program flow from the federal to local level in the State of Utah.
In Utah, LIHEAP funding is managed through the Home Energy Assistance Target (HEAT) program, which is handled by the state or Association of Governments (AOG).  The Mountainland AOG provides direct oversight for assistance to local government agencies in Utah, Wasatch, and Summit Counties.  MAG receives nearly $2.5 Million annually.
State of Illinois has announced in 2014 that residents can apply at two area agencies; a single-person household can qualify with a monthly income of up to $1,459; a two-person household up to $1,966; a family of three can earn up to $2,474; and a family of four can earn up to $2,981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Heating bill help available from state program|url=http://jg-tc.com/news/local/heating-bill-help-available-from-state-program/article_f4fd2e2a-4509-5411-a550-ba5f11650caa.html|publisher=JG-TC|accessdate=22 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Federal funding ==
[[File:Lhhist2.jpg|right]]
LIHEAP is funded by annual appropriations to the Department of Health &amp; Human Services. The funding for the fiscal year 2017 is $3.09 billion.&lt;ref&gt;https://liheapch.acf.hhs.gov/Funding/funding.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Funding is distributed to each of the fifty states, U.S. territories and tribal governments through the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Administration of the program is left up to state, territorial or tribal governments. Congress also provides the President of the United States with limited contingency funds each year, which are reserved for emergency situations and released at the President's discretion.
State legislatures often provide additional appropriations each year to supplement federal LIHEAP funds.

===Funding sources===

The amount of funding available for actual assistance comes from four major sources including: Block grants, the Residential Energy Assistance Challenge Program, Contingency Funds, and Leveraging Incentive Programs.  The following is a synopsis of how these sources tie into LIHEAP.

=== Block grants ===
Block grants account for the majority of dollars distributed for the LIHEAP program.  To be granted a block grant, states, territories, Indian tribes, and tribal organizations that wish to assist low-income households in meeting the costs of home energy, may apply for a LIHEAP block grant.

=== Residential Energy Assistance Challenge Program (REACH) ===
The Residential Energy Assistance Challenge Program (REACH) "provides grants that fund demonstration projects to test various approaches to help low-income families reduce their energy usage and become more self-sufficient in meeting their home energy needs."  Local community-based agencies that implement innovative plans to help LIHEAP eligible households reduce their energy vulnerability can receive these funds.

As of 2001, 54 REACH grants had been funded creating an annual budget of $6 Million, or one half of a one percent of the total funding for the LIHEAP program.  These grants have been used to create weatherization materials, workshops on energy efficiency measures for homes, budget counseling, and have formed consumer cooperatives to purchase home energy.  State projects run for three years, and state grantees are required to contract for third-party evaluations and to report after the conclusion of the project on the effectiveness of the approaches that they have tried.

=== Contingency funding ===

Contingency funds are funds that are released to assist with home energy needs due to emergency situations.  They may be allocated to one or more grantees, or to all grantees, based on criteria appropriate to the nature of the emergency.  Generally, these funds are released in response to extreme weather conditions or energy price increases.  In the 1980s, contingency funding was only used twice.  In the 1990s, it was used eight times, and since the year 2000 there has been a call for contingency funding every year.  
  
=== Leveraging Incentive Program ===
The Leveraging Incentive Program is designed to reward those grantees that have acquired non-federal leveraged resources for their LIHEAP programs.

It encourages grantees to look for ways to add non-federal dollars or other resources to their LIHEAP programs.  Additionally, grantees are encouraged to integrate and coordinate with other energy assistance programs to provide non-federal energy assistance to low-income households who meet LIHEAP eligibility criteria.  Participation in this program is optional, but if non-federal dollars are reported, the grantee can receive additional LIHEAP funds.  
An example of this program is to leverage a discount on wood that is negotiated by a tribal LIHEAP coordinator with a wood supplier.  The amount of the discount, given to LIHEAP eligible households, would be reported as a leveraged or non-federal resource and be eligible for additional funding to the tribe.

== How LIHEAP and WAP work together ==

Low Income Home Energy Assistance Programs (LIHEAP) and Weatherization Assistance Programs (WAP) work together to help low-income individuals and families pay energy bills and reduce energy costs. This article gives of overview of each program and describes how they work together. LIHEAP and WAP literature is also examined. Finally, a section detailing literacy in low-income consumers is included.

===Overview===

The mission of the Low Income Energy Assistance Program (LIEAP) (also known as Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP)), created in 1981, is to assist [[low income]] households, particularly those with the lowest incomes that pay a high proportion of household income for home energy, primarily in meeting their immediate home energy needs. The program, part of the United States [[Department of Health and Human Services]] (DHHS), is funded by grants appropriated from the federal government.

LIHEAP pays partial winter energy bills for eligible individuals and families. Payments are usually made directly to local utility companies or vendors. To be eligible, an individual's income level must not be more than 150% of the federal poverty level. The payment amount is figured according to the size and type of your home, as well as type of fuel.

A press release from the Department of Health and Human Services on June 5, 2013, indicates that $187.4 million was released to states to help low-income homeowners and renters with rising energy costs. This funding supplements $3.065 billion in grants made available earlier in the year through The Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP).

The funding serves to help families pay their heating and electricity, as well as make weather-related improvements to their homes. This helps to prevent these families from having service interruptions.

George Shelton, HHS acting assistant secretary for the Administration for Children and Families, stated that high temperatures translate into high energy bills for families who are already struggling to make ends meet.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.acf.hhs.gov/press/hhs-releases-1874-million-to-states-to-help-offset-energy-costs-for-low&lt;/ref&gt;

===Overview of the Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP)===

The United States [[Weatherization Assistance Program]] (WAP) was created in 1976 to help low-income families reduce energy consumption and costs. WAP is governed by various federal regulations designed to help manage and account for the resources provided by the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] (DOE). WAP funding is derived from annual appropriations from Congress. Each year, the Senate and House Interior Appropriations committees decide how much funding to allocate to the Program.

WAP technicians perform energy audits on a home to help locate efficiency problems. Once an audit is complete, the program can help by insulating walls and windows, replacing broken glass, and testing, repairing, and/or replacing combustion appliances. Like the LIHEAP, an individual's income level must be at or below 150% of the federal poverty level to be eligible for the WAP. Many state WAPs and LIHEAPs work together to provide the best energy services for low-income households.

===WAP===
LIHEAP and WAP are the cornerstones of any public energy assistance program. Often, the two programs not only work together, they automatically encompass each other. At the [[Montana]] energy assistance offices, clients are automatically enrolled in the WAP when they are enrolled in the LIHEAP.

This association is fitting being that the LIHEAP and WAP are usually located in the same office. In [[Butte, Montana]], the Energy Assistance office and Weatherization departments (which are part of the Human Resources Council, District XII) are in charge of LIHEAP and WAP. Each department offers several other programs that assist low-income individuals and families with heating and energy issues.

When a client completes and turns in an application for LIHEAP, they are automatically enrolled in WAP. After the application is processed, it usually takes one to two weeks to receive financial assistance for their heating and energy bills. During this time, the applicant is contacted by the WAP department. Before a client's home can be weatherized, an auditor comes to the home to complete an energy audit. The auditor is trained to determine the most cost-efficient weatherization measures for the home.

[[Weatherization]] measures may include caulking, weather-stripping, insulation, vent dampers, replacement of broken glass, repair or replacement of primary doors, and furnace tune-ups. Weatherization workers may not be able to install all the materials, but they will do the most important weatherization within the dollar limits allowed.

When a home is scheduled for weatherization service, a crew will come to install the necessary materials in the home. After the work is completed, the client will be asked to sign a statement saying the work was done properly and to the client's satisfaction. Surveys have shown that weatherizing a home can significantly decrease winter heating or energy bills.

Besides working together to provide energy assistance, LIHEAP and WAP programs around the country have been emphasizing energy conservation lately. {{citation needed|date=June 2017}} The program literature contains more than just information about the program, the literature offers tips on how to reduce energy consumption. Tips include replacing light bulbs with compact fluorescent light bulbs and using [[Energy Star]] appliances.

'''Future Issues'''

'''Funding Trends'''

Congress appropriated $3.47 Billion toward the program in 2012.  Over the past decade, funding for LIHEAP has trended closely with winter fuel prices, except for the federal fiscal years of 2009-2011, when funding leapt above the winter fuel price index tracked by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP).  The President's budget proposal in 2012 significantly reduced allocation amounts to "return LIHEAP funding to historic levels received for 2008 prior to energy price spikes." The two main reasons why the budget has been cut for 2012 is because first, the building codes now require energy efficiency, modern appliances with low energy use standards and second, concerns about federal budget sustainability are causing federal officials to consider reduction of LIHEAP funds. Changes in future funding will need to consider the efficacy of program management, energy costs, the number of recipients, and other potential sources of assistance. 
Performance Measures and Reporting

ANNUAL MEASURE	FY TARGET	RESULT
1A. INCREASE THE RECIPIENCY TARGETING INDEX SCORE OF LIHEAP HOUSEHOLDS HAVING AT LEAST ONE MEMBER 60 YEARS OR OLDER. (OUTCOME)	2009	96	Aug-10
	2008	96	Aug-9
	2007	94	Aug-8
	2006	92	74
	2005	84	79
	2004	82	78
	2003	Baseline	79
LIHEAP efficacy is monitored on a regular basis through its recipiency targeting index.  This index quantifies the extent to which assistance eligible households are receiving LIHEAP assistance.  The greatest focus of eligibility is those households with elderly, disabled, or young children.  An index score above 100 indicates that LIHEAP is serving a target group of households at a rate higher than the prevalence of LIHEAP income eligible households that are members of that group.  The table at right reflects the target scores from Fiscal Years (FY) 2004-2009 for households with an elderly member.  The table also shows what the actual national targeting score was for FY 2004-2006.
Each December, state LIHEAP grantees are required to report on the LIHEAP Grantee Survey the following data for the previous federal fiscal year:
*sources of LIHEAP funds
*uses of LIHEAP funds
*average household benefits for assistance
*maximum income cutoffs chosen by States for four-person households
The data from the LIHEAP Grantee Survey are included in the LIHEAP Report to Congress. The most recent available data are for FY 2003 LIHEAP and related data are obtained from LIHEAP grantee reports and surveys, national household surveys, and other federal agencies.  Much of the data are published in the department's LIHEAP Home Energy Notebook and the LIHEAP Report to Congress.

'''Energy Costs'''

While the program administrators use the above measures and reports to understand how the program is working, there is greater concern{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} that not enough funding is being brought into the program to stave off increases in fuel prices.  The 2008 spike in funding was needed to address the sharp increase in home heating oil.  The recent decrease in allocations prior to 2008 levels may not be enough to handle the continued climbing of heating costs and its effect on many households with low incomes.
Recipients

Not only are fuel prices continuing to increase, program recipients are on the rise.  This may be illustrated in the following chart showing the increase in households served by the program in relation to the amount of LIHEAP funds allocated to the State of Utah. Some statistics of note for the State of Utah include:
*SEALworks recorded that 1,619 households were shut off before coming in for HEAT assistance 
*HEAT program helped prevent 10,243 households, that had shut off notices, from being shut off
*Almost $375,769 in regular HEAT Crisis assistance assisted 1,373 families in 2011
*The program served 18,592 families with young children in 2011
*The program assisted 10,875 elderly households to receive HEAT assistance in 2011
*The program assisted 17,947 people who have disabilities in 2011
'''Coordination with Outside Programs'''

In addition to providing matching funds through the Leveraging Incentive Program, LIHEAP strives to coordinate efforts with private utility companies and non-profits where federal funding is not available.  In the State of Utah, some of these other sources include Rocky Mountain Power's Home Electric Lifeline and Lend-a-Hand Programs, Questar's Energy Assistance Fund  and REACH program, Catholic Community Services, American Red Cross, and Murray City Relief Program.  H.E.A.T. funding applicants may be referred to these or other private assistance groups if there are not sufficient LIHEAP funds.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

'''Madras Atomic Power Station''' ('''MAPS''') located at [[Kalpakkam]] about {{convert|80|km|mi}} south of [[Chennai]], [[India]], is a comprehensive [[nuclear power]] production, fuel [[Nuclear reprocessing|reprocessing]], and [[Nuclear waste|waste treatment]] facility that includes [[plutonium]] [[Nuclear fuel|fuel fabrication]] for [[fast breeder reactor]]s (FBRs). It is also India's first fully indigenously constructed nuclear power station, with two units each generating 220&amp;nbsp; MW of electricity. The first and second units of the station went critical in 1983 and 1985 respectively. The station has reactors housed in a reactor building with double shell containment improving protection also in the case of a [[loss-of-coolant accident]]. An Interim Storage Facility (ISF) is also located in Kalpakkam.&lt;br /&gt;

== History ==
During its construction, a total of 3.8 [[lakh]] (380,000) railway sleeper (logs) were brought from all over India to lift the 180&amp;nbsp;ton critical equipment in the first unit, due to lack of proper infrastructure and handling equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiaenvironmentportal.org.in/content/madras-atomic-power-station-marks-silver-jubilee|title=MAPS Silver Jubilee Celebration|website=indiaenvironmentportal.org.in|publisher=India Environment Portal|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121218191237/http://www.indiaenvironmentportal.org.in/content/madras-atomic-power-station-marks-silver-jubilee|archivedate=18 December 2012|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;!-- Only a 404 at web.archive.org on 2014-11-08 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Asof|July 2016}} the [[Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor]] (PFBR) was in its final construction stage, and was expected to reach criticality in March 2017 with 500&amp;nbsp;MW of electricity production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://dae.nic.in/writereaddata/parl/monsoon2016/rsus1184.pdf

The following month the loading of the 1750&amp;nbsp;ton liquid [[sodium]] coolant were expected to happen in four to five months, with sources in the [[Department of Atomic Energy]] reporting that criticality would likely be reached only around May 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/prototype-fast-breeder-reactor-likely-to-be-delayed/article8919482.ece | title = Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor likely to be delayed | last1 =Rohit | first1 =T.K. | author-link1 = | date = 30 July 2016 | work = [[The Hindu]] | format = | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20160730011953/http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/prototype-fast-breeder-reactor-likely-to-be-delayed/article8919482.ece | archive-date =30 July 2016 | dead-url =no | access-date =8 August 2016 | quote =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reactors ==
The facility houses two indigenously built Pressurised Heavy-Water Reactors ([[PHWR]]s), MAPS-1 and MAPS-2 designed to produce 235&amp;nbsp;MW of electricity each.&lt;ref name=NTI/&gt; MAPS-1 was completed in 1981, but start-up was delayed due to a shortage of [[heavy water]]. After procuring the necessary heavy water, MAPS-1 went critical in 1983 and began operating at full power on 27 January 1984. MAPS-2 obtained criticality in 1985 and began full power operations on 21 March 1986.&lt;ref name=NTI&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.nti.org/e_research/profiles/India/Nuclear/2103_2460.html |title= NTI: Country Overviews: India: Nuclear Facilities Madras Atomic Power Station (MAPS) |work= [[Nuclear Threat Initiative]] |date=September 2003 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20040317171051/http://www.nti.org/e_research/profiles/India/Nuclear/2103_2460.html |archive-date= 2004-03-17 |access-date= 2017-02-18 |dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npcil.nic.in/main/ProjectOperationDisplay.aspx?ReactorID=75 Plants Under Operation - Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited]. Npcil.nic.in. Retrieved on 2013-12-06.&lt;/ref&gt;

With India not being a signatory to the [[Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons]] the reactors have since 1985 been delivering their [[spent fuel]] to the [[nuclear reprocessing]] plant at Tarapur, providing the country with [[IAEA safeguards|unsafeguarded]] [[plutonium]].&lt;ref name=NTI/&gt;

A beachhead at Kalpakkam also hosts India's first indigenous [[Pressurised water reactor|Pressurised (light) water reactor]] (PWR). The 80&amp;nbsp;MW reactor was developed by [[Bhabha Atomic Research Centre]] (BARC) as the land-based prototype of the nuclear power unit for India's nuclear submarines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/pwr-building-shows-indigenous-capability-says-kakodkar/article195785.ece|location = Chennai, India|work = The Hindu|title = PWR building shows indigenous capability, says Kakodkar|date = 3 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This unit does not come under MAPS.

== Incidents ==
The reactors' coolant pipes have been plagued by vibrations and cracking with substantial cracking in the reactor coolant system. This cracking has led to the discovery of [[Zircaloy]] pieces in a moderator pump, requiring the power generation to be lowered to 170&amp;nbsp;MW.&lt;ref name=NTI/&gt;

On 26 March 1999 large amounts of heavy water spilled at MAPS-2, exposing seven technicians to heavy [[radiation dose|doses of radiation]].&lt;ref name=NTI/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2874">'''Minicharged particles''' (or '''milli-charged particles''') are a proposed type of subatomic particle.  They are charged, but with a tiny fraction of the [[charge of the electron]].  They weakly interact with matter.  Minicharged particles are not part of the [[Standard Model]].  One proposal to detect them involved photons tunneling through an opaque barrier in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field, the rationale being that a pair of oppositely charged minicharged particles are produced that curve in opposite directions, and recombine on the other side of the barrier reproducing the photon again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://phys.org/news/2012-10-tunneling-kind-physics.html|title=Tunneling of the third kind' experiment could search for new physics|last=Zyga|first=Lisa|date=3 October 2012|accessdate=14 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13240">The '''National Energy Board''' ({{lang-fr|Office national de l'énergie}}) is an independent economic regulatory agency created in 1959 by the [[Government of Canada]] to oversee "international and inter-provincial aspects of the oil, gas and electric utility industries".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=National Energy Board |title=Who we are &amp; our governance |location=Calgary |year=2010 |url=http://www.neb.gc.ca/clf-nsi/rthnb/whwrndrgvrnnc/whwrndrgvrnnc-eng.html |accessdate=7 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its head office is located in [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]].

The NEB mainly regulates the construction and operation of oil and [[natural gas pipeline]]s crossing [[provinces and territories of Canada|provincial]] or international borders. The Board approves pipeline traffic, tolls and tariffs under the authority of the ''National Energy Board Act''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Government of Canada |authorlink=Government of Canada |title=National Energy Board Act (R.S.C., 1985, c. N-7) |publisher=Department of Justice |url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/N-7/index.html |date=2014-04-01 |origyear=Enacted 1985 |accessdate=2014-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; It deals with approximately 750 applications annually, through written or oral proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=National Energy Board |title=Our History |location=Calgary |year=2010 |url=http://www.neb.gc.ca/clf-nsi/rthnb/whwrndrgvrnnc/rhstry-eng.html |accessdate=2010-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Energy Board also has jurisdiction over the construction and operation of international [[power line]]s, defined as lines built "for the purpose of transmitting electricity from or to a place in Canada from or to a place outside of Canada". The NEB authorizes imports of natural gas, and exports of crude oil, natural gas, oil, natural gas liquids (NGLs), refined petroleum products and electricity.  The NEB also has jurisdiction over designated inter-provincial power lines, by determination of the federal Cabinet, but no such line has been designated, leaving the regulation of existing interties to provincial regulatory bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Blake, Cassels &amp; Graydon LLP |title=Overview of Electricity Regulation in Canada |date=March 2008 |url=http://www.blakes.com/english/legal_updates/reference_guides/Overview%20of%20Electricity%20in%20Canada.pdf |accessdate=2010-09-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708013314/http://www.blakes.com/english/legal_updates/reference_guides/Overview%20of%20Electricity%20in%20Canada.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent NEB decisions in favour of petroleum-industry interests have led to increasing controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Global News|title=National Energy Board Approves Enbridge's Line 9 with Conditions |date=2014-03-14|url=http://globalnews.ca/news/1190861/national-energy-board-to-rule-on-enbridges-controversial-line-9-reversal/.html |accessdate=2014-11-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2018, the government of [[Justin Trudeau]] proposed to supersede the NEB with the Impact Assessment Agency of Canada, which would be better structured to assess health, Indigenous, and socioeconomic concerns in additional to the environmental impact of major Canadian projects. The NEB's regulatory tasks such as regulating pipelines and oil and gas transmission would be taken up by a new Canadian Energy Regulator (CER).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/liberal-environmental-assessment-changes-1.4525666|title=Ottawa to scrap National Energy Board, overhaul environmental assessment process for major projects|last=Tasker|first=John Paul|date=February 8, 2018|work=[[CBC News]]|access-date=February 8, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pending review ==

Prime Minister [[Justin Trudeau]] (elected in the [[Canadian federal election, 2015]]) has strongly condemned the Harper-era process of regulation, and especially the NEB, citing serious [[conflict of interest]] and mandate flaws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.torontosun.com/2015/06/29/liberals-would-bolster-national-energy-board-reviews-trudeau|title=Liberals would bolster National Energy Board reviews: Trudeau|first1=Tamsyn|last1=Burgmann|first2=Canadian|last2=Press|website=Toronto Sun}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of December 2016, no changes to the Board had been announced.

=== Climate accounting ===

The NEB's lack of coherence on [[climate change]] is a major source of uncertainty.  Ontario and Quebec had initially imposed approval conditions on [[Energy East]] re "upstream" emissions in Alberta, similar to those imposed both upstream and downstream by the EPA and Obama Administration on [[Keystone XL]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/transcanada-chief-slams-ludicrous-arguments-by-energy-east-opponents/article22233005/|title=TransCanada chief slams ‘ludicrous’ arguments by Energy East opponents|publisher=|via=The Globe and Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Both dropped these [[climate change]] concerns &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/ontario-plays-down-climate-change-concerns-of-energy-east-pipeline/article21907743/|title=Wynne drops main climate change requirement in considering Energy East pipeline|publisher=|via=The Globe and Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt; in December 2014  despite the [[Pembina Institute]] estimate that "Energy East would cause 32 million tonnes of added greenhouse-gas emissions every year, which would cancel out the emissions reductions Ontario achieved by closing all of its coal-fired power plants".

=== Provincial vetos and equalization ===

Another complicating factor is the position of [[Brad Wall]], Premier of Saskatchewan, that equalization can be withheld from provinces that do not support raw [[bitumen]] export.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/full-comment/don-braid-brad-wall-is-right-provinces-need-to-get-out-of-the-way-on-pipeline-approvals|title=Don Braid: Brad Wall is right: provinces need to get out of the way of pipeline approvals|date=16 July 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Indigenous peoples' rights and veto ===

A final issue requiring federal clarification is the [[United Nations]] [[Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]]. Under the UNDRIP, indigenous peoples on unceded lands, including those over which [[Enbridge Northern Gateway Pipelines|Northern Gateway]] and [[Energy East]] would need to pass, appear to most authorities to have a strict veto and not mere "consultation" rights as under Canada's 1981 constitution.  That constitution was not agreed to by the province of Quebec nor aboriginal authority at any level.

This especially affects [[Energy East]], as [[New Brunswick]] and [[Quebec]] [[Maliseet]] accordingly have strict authority under UNDRIP to unilaterally reject it, as its proposed route crosses their territory (and those of a total of 180 aboriginal / indigenous groups).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/industry-news/energy-and-resources/energy-companies-struggle-with-aboriginal-needs-on-pipelines/article15818477/|title=Energy companies struggle with aboriginal needs on pipelines|publisher=|via=The Globe and Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opposition to Northern Gateway and Energy East is strong among natives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/industry-news/energy-and-resources/first-nations-prepare-for-fight-against-energy-east-pipeline/article18748066/|title=First Nations prepare for fight against Energy East pipeline|publisher=|via=The Globe and Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A veto is supported by some Canadian oil extraction corporations such as [[Suncor]] and [[Tembec]].&lt;ref&gt;http://myinforms.com/en-us/a/16683975-resources-firms-endorse-call-for-aboriginal-veto-rights-to-projects/&lt;/ref&gt;  Indigenous groups have a long history of winning court challenges in Canada.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

While the NEB does hear aboriginal oral evidence &lt;ref&gt;http://www.bizjournals.com/prnewswire/press_releases/2015/10/01/C8199&lt;/ref&gt; from 70 specific intervenors &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/neb-issues-list-of-aboriginal-intervenors-for-energy-east-515949061.html|title=NEB issues list of Aboriginal Intervenors for Energy East|first=National Energy|last=Board|website=www.prnewswire.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; the NEB process created under [[Stephen Harper]] falls far short of the demands of aboriginal groups themselves.

=== Response to spills and leaks ===

In 2014 John Bennett, national program director for the [[Sierra Club Canada]] (SCC) criticized the NEB for considering changes in its approach to preventing oil spills in future offshore drilling in the [[Beaufort Sea]]. Current policy requires companies working in the Arctic to have the capability to drill a relief well in the same season to release pressure and stop oil flow in case of a blowout such as the one that happened with BP in the Gulf of Mexico. But the NEB has said that other equally effective methods would be considered.&lt;ref name="CBC News"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/sierra-club-blasts-neb-s-arctic-oil-drilling-safety-process-1.2740790 | title=Sierra Club blasts NEB’s Arctic oil drilling safety process 'A discussion of whether or not we need relief wells is now moot,' says Sierra Club's John Bennett CBC News Posted: Aug 19, 2014 12:52 | work=CBC News | date=19 August 2014 | accessdate=27 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Conflicts of interest ===

Economist Robyn Allan, questioned the July 28, 2015 appointment by the Governor in Council on behalf of the Office of the Prime Minister, of Steven J. Kelly — a former [[Kinder Morgan]] consultant —  as a full-time member of the National Energy Board (Board).&lt;ref name="nationalobserver"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nationalobserver.com/2015/08/24/opinion/neb-survival-mode-after-hiring-kinder-morgan-consultant | title=NEB in survival mode after hiring Kinder Morgan consultant | work=National Observer | date=24 August 2015 | accessdate=27 August 2015 | author=Robyn Allan}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter dated August 21, 2015 NEB Board of Drectors chair David Hamiltonand and fellow Members, Alison Scott and Philip Davies wrote a &lt;ref name="NEB statement"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://docs.neb-one.gc.ca/ll-eng/llisapi.dll/fetch/2000/90464/90552/548311/956726/2392873/2558704/2812678/A208-1_-_Letter_-_A4S8Y8.pdf?nodeid=2813274&amp;vernum=-2 | title=Trans Mountain Pipeline ULC and all intervenors | work=NEB | date=21 August 2015 | accessdate=27 August 2015 | author=David Hamilton (Chair), Alison Scott (Member) and Philip Davies (Member) }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996 Kelly joined Purvin &amp; Gertz, Inc. now [[IHS Inc.]] and was vice-president of IHS Global Canada, "an oil industry consulting firm hired by Kinder Morgan to do an economic study justifying the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion."&lt;ref name="nationalobserver" /&gt;&lt;ref name="press.ihs.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://press.ihs.com/corporate_profile/acquisitions|title=Acquisitions - IHS Online Pressroom|publisher=Press.ihs.com|accessdate=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NEB postponed oral hearings scheduled for August 24 in Calgary to avoid a conflict of interest with Kelly's appointment which is effective October 13.&lt;ref name="KinderMorgan"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://business.financialpost.com/news/energy/kinder-morgan-takes-on-pipeline-risk-tolerance-in-push-for-trans-mountain-expansion | title=Kinder Morgan takes on pipeline risk tolerance in push for Trans Mountain expansion | publisher=Financial Post | date=21 August 2015 | accessdate=28 August 2015 | author=Claudia Cattaneo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternative dates have not yet been provided.  Kinder Morgan has already filed copious amounts of IHS evidence with affidavits that was submitted by Steven Kelly in support of Kinder Morgan's application for the proposed pipeline expansion Trans Mountain. According to the NEB, all Kelly's evidence will be struck from the record.&lt;ref name="KinderMorgan" /&gt;

=== Lack of oral cross-examination ===

The NEB process has been sharply criticized &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theprovince.com/news/regulator+watch+anti+pipeline+protesters+challenge/11354196/story.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-10-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151025001944/http://www.theprovince.com/news/regulator+watch+anti+pipeline+protesters+challenge/11354196/story.html |archivedate=2015-10-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and even called a "farce" by former public officials objecting to lack of oral cross-examination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/kinder-morgan-pipeline-hearings-a-farce-says-former-bc-hydro-head-1.2822299|title=Kinder Morgan pipeline hearings called a 'farce' by former BC Hydro chief|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2639">'''Natural gasoline''' is a [[natural gas liquid]] with a [[vapor pressure]] intermediate between [[natural gas condensate]] (drip gas) and [[liquefied petroleum gas]] and has a [[boiling point]] within the range of [[gasoline]]. The typical [[API gravity|gravity]] of natural gasoline is around 80 [[API gravity|API]]. This [[hydrocarbon]] mixture is liquid at ambient pressure and temperature. It is volatile and unstable, but can be blended with other hydrocarbons to produce commercial gasoline. The hydrocarbon mixture of natural gasoline are mostly pentanes and heavier (smaller amounts of C6 and C6+), extracted from natural gas, that meets vapor pressure, end-point, and other specifications for natural gasoline set by the Gas Processors Association.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gasprocessors.com.&lt;/ref&gt; Includes [[isopentane]], which is a saturated branch-chain hydrocarbon (C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;), obtained by fractionation of natural gasoline or isomerization of normal pentane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eia.gov/tools/glossary/index.cfm?id=Isopentane |title=EIA Glossary |accessdate=2012-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses ==

Natural gasoline is often used as a denaturant for fuel-grade [[Ethanol fuel|ethanol]], where it is commonly added volumetrically between 2.0% and 2.5% to make denatured fuel ethanol (DFE), or E98. This process renders the fuel-grade ethanol undrinkable. It is then transferred to a blender, which will add this E98 to conventional gasoline to make common 87 octane fuels (E10). It can also be added to ethanol in higher volumetric concentrations to produce high-level blends of ethanol, such as [[E85]]. Natural gasoline has a lower [[octane]] content (RON roughly equal to 70) than conventional commercial distilled gasoline, so it cannot normally be used by itself for fuel for modern automobiles. However, when mixed with higher concentrations of ethanol (RON roughly equal to 113&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ethanolproducer.com/articles/8858/octane-whats-in-your-fuel |title=Octane: What's in your Fuel? |last=Bevill |first=Kris |date= |website= |publisher=Ethanol Producer |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) to produce products such as E85, the octane level of the natural gasoline and ethanol mixture is now within the usable range for flex-fuel vehicles. 

== Sources ==

It may be sourced from production of natural-gas wells (see "[[drip gas]]") or produced by extraction processes&lt;ref&gt;http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/106/1/Bowman.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; in the field, as opposed to refinery cracking of conventional gasoline.

==Application to oil supply forecasting==
[[File:Oil Discoveries and Volume Per Decade.png|thumb|300px|Number of oil fields discovered per decades grouped by average flow rates (left) and corresponding oil volumes (right) in [[giga]]-barrels (Gb). Data taken from the annexe B of ''Twilight in the Desert'' by [[Matthew Simmons]].&lt;ref name="Simmons2005"/&gt;]]
A series of project tabulations and analyses by [[Chris Skrebowski]], editor of ''Petroleum Review'', have presented a more pessimistic picture of future oil supply. In a 2004 report,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
 |url= http://www.odac-info.org/bulletin/documents/MEGAPROJECTSREPORT.pdf
 |title= Oil field mega projects
 |year=2004
}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on an analysis of new projects over {{convert|100000|oilbbl/d|m3/d}}, he argued that although ample supply might be available in the near-term, after 2007 "the volumes of new production for this period are well below likely requirements."  By 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
 |url         = http://sydneypeakoil.com/downloads/PR_APR06_Megaprojects.pdf
 |title       = Prices holding steady, despite massive planned capacity additions

 |archivedate = 2006-06-28
 |df          = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; although "the outlook for future supply appears somewhat brighter than even six months ago", nonetheless, if "all the factors reducing new capacity come into play, markets will remain tight and prices high. Only if new capacity flows into the system rather more rapidly than of late, will there be any chance of rebuilding spare capacity and softening prices."

The smallest fields, even in aggregate, do not contribute a large fraction of the total.  For example, a relatively small number of giant and [[List of largest oil fields|super-giant oilfields]] are providing almost half of the world production.&lt;ref name="Simmons2005"&gt;{{cite book

[[  Sedimentation|  Sedimentation]] is precipitation of solid particles and water to the bottom of oil tanks under gravity. The main drawback of this process is its longevity &lt;ref name="Waste Oil Recovery"&gt;[https://www.ijirset.com/upload/2016/november/62_26_COMPARSION.pdf Z.K. Bhushan, S.M. Anil, K. Sainand, H.

International Journal of Innovative Research in Science, Engineering and Technology.Vol.5, Issue 11. pp. 20001-20009.]&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[ Filtration| Filtration]] is a partial removal of solid particles through filter medium. Oil filtration systems generally use a multistage filtration with coarse and fine filters &lt;ref name="Classic Ways of Used Oil Purification"&gt;[https://oilregeneration.globecore.com/classic-ways-of-used-oil-purification Classic Ways of Used Oil Purification.]&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[Centrifugation|Centrifugation]] is separation of oil and water, or oil and solid particles by centrifugal forces.

Vacuum treatment degasses and dehydrates industrial oil. This method is well suited for removing dispersed and dissolved water, as well as dissolved gases &lt;ref name="Vacuum Distillation Technique"&gt;[http://jnus.org/pdf/1/2017/1/1257.pdf M.M.

Journal of Al-Nahrain University. Volume 20(2). pp. 17-24.]&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[Adsorption| Adsorption purification]], in contrast to the methods mentioned above, does not remove solid particles and gases, but it shows good results at removing water, oil sludge and aging products. This process uses adsorbents of natural or artificial origin:  bleaching clays, synthetic aluminosilicates, silica gels, zeolites, etc &lt;ref name="Waste Lubricating Oil Treatment"&gt;[https://www.idc-online.com/technical_references/pdfs/chemical_engineering/Waste%20Lubricating.pdf N.M.

Volume 3. pp. 70-73.]&lt;/ref&gt;.

==The difference between purification and regeneration of industrial oil==
Often the terms '''"oil purification"''' and '''"[[Oil regeneration|  oil regeneration]]"''' are used synonymously. Although in fact they are not the same. Oil purification cleans oil from contaminants. it can be used independently or as a part of oil regeneration. Oil regeneration also removes aging products (with the help of adsorbents) and stabilizes oil with additives. Regenerated oil is clean from carcinogenic products of oil aging and stabilized with the help of additives.

==History==
The company was founded in 2013 by Hugh Whalan (CEO) and Nate Heller. Whalan had previously run a solar financing and distribution company called Impact Energies in Ghana , which was acquired in 2013 in the first off-grid solar exit in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=PV Talk: PEG Africa on the evolution of pay-as-you-go solar |url=https://www.pv-tech.org/interviews/pv-talk-peg-africa-on-the-evolution-of-pay-as-you-go-solar |accessdate=23 November 2018 |publisher=PV Tech |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After commercial launch in 2015, the company had over 10,000 customers and 29 service centers across Ghana by 2016, and closed its [[Series A funding]] round with a total of $7.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=PEG raises US$13.5 million for off-grid home solar in West Africa |url=https://www.pv-tech.org/news/peg-fundraise-usd13.5-million-for-off-grid-home-solar-in-west-africa |website=PV Tech |accessdate=23 November 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the company raised a further $13.5 million through a combination of debt and [[Venture_capital_financing|Series B equity financing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Solar company PEG Africa secures $13.5m funding |url=http://disrupt-africa.com/2017/10/solar-company-peg-africa-secures-13-5m-funding/ |accessdate=23 November 2018 |work=Disrupt Africa |date=27 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Blue Haven Initiative: The PEGAfrica Investment |url=https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=53960 |accessdate=23 November 2018 |work=Harvard Business School |date=2 February 2018 |language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; Investors across both rounds of funding included Energy Access Ventures (EAV), [[Blue Haven Initiative]], Investisseurs &amp; Partenaires (I&amp;P), ENGIE Rassembleurs d’Energies, Impact Assets, [[Acumen (organization)|Acumen]], PCG Investments, among others. In late 2016, the company extended its operations to the Ivory Coast, and in 2018, the company expanded to Senegal.

Since 2016, PEG Africa has been awarded by [[B Corporation (certification)|B Corporation]] with ‘''best for Customers''’ and ‘''best for the World''’ awards.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8798">'''PVLAS''' ('''Polarizzazione del Vuoto con LASer''', "polarization of the vacuum with laser") aims to carry out a test of [[quantum electrodynamics]] and possibly detect [[dark matter]] at the Department of Physics and  [[Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare|National Institute of Nuclear Physics]] in [[Ferrara]], [[Italy]]. It searches for [[vacuum polarization]] causing nonlinear optical behavior in magnetic fields. Experiments began in 2001 at the INFN Laboratory in Legnaro (Padua, Italy) and continue today with new equipment.

== Background ==
Nonlinear electrodynamic effects in vacuum have been predicted since the earliest days of [[quantum electrodynamics]] (QED), a few years after the discovery of [[positron]]s. One such effect is vacuum magnetic birefringence, closely connected to elastic light-by-light interaction. The effect is extremely small and has never yet been observed directly.
Although today QED is a very well-tested theory, the importance of detecting light-by-light interaction remains. First, QED has always been tested in the presence of charged particles either in the initial state or the final state. No tests exist in systems with only photons. More generally, no interaction has ever been observed directly with only gauge bosons present in the initial and final states. Second, to date, the evidence for zero-point quantum fluctuations relies entirely on the observation of the [[Casimir effect]], which applies to photons only. PVLAS deals with the fluctuations of virtual charged particle-antiparticle pairs (of any nature, including hypothetical [[millicharged particle]]s) and therefore the structure of fermionic quantum vacuum: to leading order, it would be a direct detection of loop diagrams. Finally, the observation of light-by-light interaction would be an evidence of the breakdown of the superposition principle and of [[Maxwell’s equations]]. One important consequence of a nonlinearity is that the velocity of light would depend on the presence or not of other electromagnetic fields. PVLAS carries out its search by looking at changes in the polarisation state of a  [[Linear polarization|linearly polarised]] [[laser beam]] after it passes through a [[vacuum]] with an intense [[magnetic field]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ts.infn.it/physics/experiments/pvlas/ ''The PVLAS experiment'']&lt;/ref&gt;  The birefringence of the vacuum in [[quantum electrodynamics]] by an external field is generally credited to [[Stephen L. Adler]], who presented the first general derivation in  [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0003-4916(71)90154-0 Photon splitting and photon dispersion in a strong magnetic field] in 1971.

== Design ==
PVLAS uses a high-finesse Fabry-Perot optical cavity.  The first setup, used until 2005, sent a linearly polarized laser beam though vacuum with 5T magnetic field from a superconducting magnet to an ellipsometer.  After upgrades to avoid fringe fields, several runs were done at 2.3T and 5T, excluding a prior claim of [[axion]] detection.  It was determined that an optimized optical setup was needed for discovery potential.  A prototype with much improved sensitivity was tested in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Towards a direct measurement of vacuum magnetic birefringence: PVLAS achievements|date = Nov 1, 2010|journal = Optics Communications|volume = 283|issue = 21|pages = 4194–4198|accessdate = |doi = 10.1016/j.optcom.2010.06.065|pmid = |last1 = Della Valle|first1 = F.|display-authors = 4|last2 = Di Domenico|first2 = G.|last3 = Gastaldi|first3 = U.|last4 = Milotti|first4 = E.|last5 = Pengo|first5 = R.|last6 = Ruoso|first6 = G.|last7 = Zavattini|first7 = G.|arxiv = 0907.2642 |bibcode = 2010OptCo.283.4194D }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 the upgraded apparatus at INFN Ferrara with permanent magnets and horizontal ellipsometer was set up&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Della Valle|first1=F.|display-authors=4|last2=Di Domenico|first2=G.|last3=Gastaldi|first3=U.|last4=Milotti|first4=E.|last5=Messineo|first5=G.|last6=Pengo|first6=R.|last7=Piemontese|first7=L.|last8=Ruoso|first8=G.|last9=Zavattini|first9=G.|title=The new PVLAS apparatus for detection of magnetic birefringence of vacuum|journal=Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section A: Accelerators, Spectrometers, Detectors and Associated Equipment|volume=718|pages=495–496|doi=10.1016/j.nima.2012.11.084|date=2013|bibcode = 2013NIMPA.718..495D }}&lt;/ref&gt; and began data taking in 2014

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5980">The '''permissible exposure limit''' ('''PEL''' or '''OSHA PEL''') is a [[law|legal]] limit in the [[United States]] for exposure of an employee to a [[chemical substance]] or physical agent such as loud noise. Permissible exposure limits are established by the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA).  Most of OSHA’s PELs were issued shortly after adoption of the Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) Act in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = OSHA Annotated PELs|url = https://www.osha.gov/dsg/annotated-pels/|website = www.osha.gov|accessdate = 2015-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

For chemicals, the [[regulation of chemicals|chemical regulation]] is usually expressed in [[parts per million]] (ppm), or sometimes in [[milligram]]s per [[cubic meter]] (mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;). Units of measure for physical agents such as [[noise]] are specific to the agent. 

A PEL is usually given as a '''time-weighted average''' ('''TWA'''), although some are [[short-term exposure limit]]s (STEL) or ceiling limits. A TWA is the average exposure over a specified period, usually a nominal eight hours. This means that, for limited periods, a worker may be exposed to concentration excursions higher than the PEL, so long as the TWA is not exceeded and any applicable excursion limit is not exceeded. An excursion limit typically means that "...worker exposure levels may exceed 3 times the PEL-TWA for no more than a total of 30 minutes during a workday, and under no circumstances should they exceed 5 times the PEL-TWA, provided that
the PEL-TWA is not exceeded."&lt;ref name="Oregon Rules for Air Contaminants 437-002-0382 (1)c"&gt;{{cite web|title=437-002-0382 Oregon Rules for Air Contaminants|url=http://www.cbs.state.or.us/osha/pdf/rules/division_2/div_2.pdf|publisher=Oregon Occupational Safety and Health Division|accessdate=30 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Excursion limits are enforced in some states (for example Oregon) and on the federal level for certain contaminants such as asbestos.

A short-term exposure limit is one that addresses the average exposure over a 15-30 minute period of maximum exposure during a single work shift. A ceiling limit is one that may not be exceeded for any time, and is applied to irritants and other materials that have immediate effects.

The current PEL for OSHA  standards are based on a 5 [[decibel]] exchange rate. OSHA’s PEL for noise exposure is 90 decibels (dBA) for an 8-hour TWA. Levels of 90-140 dBA are included in the noise dose. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rawool |first1=Vishakha |title=Hearing Conservation in Occupation, Education, and Home Settings |date= 19 September 2011 |publisher=Thieme Publishers, Inc. |location=333 Seventh Ave. New York, NY 10001 |isbn=978-1604062564 |pages=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;PEL can also be expressed as 100 percent “dose” for noise exposure. When the noise exposure increases by 5 dB, the exposure time is cut in half.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=OSHA Fact Sheet |url=https://www.osha.gov/Publications/laboratory/OSHAfactsheet-laboratory-safety-noise.pdf |website=OSHA |accessdate=21 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to OSHA, a 95dBA TWA would be a 200 percent dose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Permissible Noise Exposures |url=https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/noisehearingconservation/pel.html |website=OSHA |accessdate=20 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; PEL is exceeded when TWA &gt; 90 dBA. OSHA requires feasible engineering OR [[administrative controls]], and mandatory hearing protection when the PEL is exceeded.

===MSHA===
Like OSHA, [[Mine Safety and Health Administration]](MSHA) also uses the same 5 decibel exchange rate and 90 dBA for an 8-hour TWA for their PEL. Once a miner's noise exposure exceeds the PEL, feasible engineering AND administrative controls must be in place to try to limit the noise exposure of the employees. If a mine operator uses administrative controls, procedures for such controls must be posted on the bulletin board and a copy must be supplied to all affected employees. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=62.130 Permissible Exposure Limit |url=https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=28741a401b0e74a8d116a4d905dd89b6&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt30.1.62&amp;rgn=div5#se30.1.62_1130 |website=Government Publishing Office |accessdate=20 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===NIOSH===
The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]](NIOSH) [[Recommended Exposure Limit]] (REL) for noise exposure uses a 3 decibel exchange rate. The recommendation for occupational noise exposure is 85 decibles (dBA) for an 8-hour TWA. For every 3dB over 85, the exposure time is cut in half. NIOSH reports exposures above this level are considered hazardous. NIOSH uses a hierarchy of control to reduce or remove hazardous noise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Controls for Noise Exposure |url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/noisecontrol/default.html |website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |accessdate=22 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pulp''' is a lignocellulosic fibrous material prepared by chemically or mechanically separating [[Cellulose fiber|cellulose fibres]] from [[wood]], [[fiber crop]]s, [[Paper recycling|waste paper]], or [[cotton paper|rag]]s.  Many kinds of paper are made from wood with nothing else mixed into them.  This includes newspaper, magazines and even toilet paper.  Pulp is one of the most abundant raw materials .

== History ==
[[File:Making Paper.gif|thumb|Five seminal steps in ancient [[China|Chinese]] papermaking outlined in a [[woodcut]].]]
Pulp for [[papermaking]] was produced by macerating [[Paper mulberry|mulberry]] bark as early as the 2nd century in [[Han dynasty]] China, where the invention of paper is traditionally attributed to [[Cai Lun]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Tsien |first=Tsuen-Hsuin |authorlink=Tsien Tsuen-hsuin|series=Science and Civilisation in China: Chemistry and Chemical Technology |volume=Vol. 5 Part 1|title=Paper and Printing|publisher=Cambridge University Press|p=4|year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lu Ji, in his 3rd century commentary on the ''[[Classic of Poetry]]'', mentions that people residing south of the [[Yangtze River]] would traditionally pound mulberry bark to make paper or clothing.&lt;ref name="Tsien56-58"/&gt; By the 6th century, the mulberry tree was domesticated by farmers in China specifically for the purpose of producing pulp to be used in the papermaking process. In addition to mulberry, pulp was also made from bamboo, hibiscus bark, blue sandalwood, straw, and cotton.&lt;ref name="Tsien56-58"&gt;{{Citation |last=Tsien |first=Tsuen-Hsuin |authorlink=Tsien Tsuen-hsuin|series=Science and Civilisation in China: Chemistry and Chemical Technology |volume=Vol. 5 Part 1|title=Paper and Printing|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pp=56–61|year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; Papermaking using pulp made from hemp and linen fibers from tattered clothing, fishing nets and fabric bags spread to Europe in the 13th century, with an ever-increasing use of rags being central to the manufacture and affordability of [[rag paper]], a factor in the development of printing.&lt;ref name="hunter"&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By the 1800s, demand often exceeding the available supply of rags, and also the manual labor of [[papermaking]] resulted in paper being still a relatively pricey product.&lt;ref name="hunter"/&gt;

Using wood pulp to make [[paper]] is a fairly recent innovation, that was almost concurrent to the invention of automatic papermaking machines, both together resulting in paper and cardboard becoming an inexpensive commodity in modern times.&lt;ref name="hunter"/&gt; Although the first use of paper made from wood pulp dates from 1800, as seen in some pages of a book published by Matthias Koops that year in London,&lt;ref name="hunter"/&gt; large-scale wood paper production began with the development of mechanical pulping in Germany by [[Friedrich Gottlob Keller]] in the 1840s,&lt;ref name="eero"/&gt; and by the Canadian inventor [[Charles Fenerty]] in [[Nova Scotia]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.charlesfenerty.ca/book.html Burger, Peter]''Charles Fenerty and his Paper Invention''. Toronto: Peter Burger, 2007. {{ISBN|978-0-9783318-1-8}} pp.25–30&lt;/ref&gt;    Chemical processes quickly followed, first with [[J. Roth]]'s use of [[sulfurous acid]] to treat wood, then by [[Benjamin Tilghman]]'s [[United States patent law|U.S. patent]] on the use of [[calcium bisulfite]], Ca(HSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, to pulp wood in 1867.&lt;ref name="bier"/&gt; Almost a decade later, the first commercial [[Sulfite process|sulfite pulp mill]] was built, in Sweden. It used [[magnesium]] as the [[counter ion]] and was based on work by [[Carl Daniel Ekman]]. By 1900, sulfite pulping had become the dominant means of producing wood pulp, surpassing mechanical pulping methods. The competing chemical pulping process, the  sulfate, or [[kraft process|kraft]], process, was developed by [[Carl F. Dahl]] in 1879; the first kraft mill started, in Sweden, in 1890.&lt;ref name="bier"&gt;{{cite book |last=Biermann |first=Christopher J.|title=Handbook of Pulping and Papermaking |year=1993 |publisher=Academic Press |location=San Diego |isbn=0-12-097360-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The invention of the [[recovery boiler]], by [[G.H.

This, along with the ability of the kraft process to accept a wider variety of types of wood and to produce stronger fibres,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061208203749/http://www.indiapapermarket.com/history1.asp History of Paper]. indiapapermarket.com&lt;/ref&gt; made the kraft process the dominant pulping process, starting in the 1940s.&lt;ref name="bier"/&gt;

Global production of wood pulp in 2006 was 175&amp;nbsp;million tons (160&amp;nbsp;million tonnes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metso.com/corporation/home_eng.nsf/FR?ReadForm&amp;ATL=/corporation/articles_eng.nsf/WebWID/WTB-060828-2256F-A001F |title=Pulp production growing in new areas (Global production) |accessdate=2007-10-13 |date=September 5, 2006 |work= |publisher=Metso Corporation |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023105508/http://www.metso.com/corporation/home_eng.nsf/FR?ReadForm&amp;ATL=%2Fcorporation%2Farticles_eng.nsf%2FWebWID%2FWTB-060828-2256F-A001F |archivedate=October 23, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the previous year, 63&amp;nbsp;million tons (57&amp;nbsp;million tonnes) of market pulp (not made into paper in the same facility) was sold, with Canada being the largest source at 21 percent of the total, followed by the United States at 16 percent.

==Wood pulp ==
[[File:Paperfibersar.jpg|thumb|300px|Fibres in wood pulp]]
The [[timber]] resources used to make wood pulp are referred to as [[pulpwood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FyQnAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=pulpwood+timber+used+to+make+wood+pulp&amp;dq=pulpwood+timber+used+to+make+wood+pulp&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi1sr3G0IvVAhUY6WMKHUueDP4Q6AEIJDAA|title=Michigan Timber Production: Now and in 1985|last=Manthy|first=Robert S.|last2=James|first2=Lee Morton|last3=Huber|first3=Henry H.|date=1973|publisher=Michigan State University, Agricultural Experiment Station and Cooperative Extension service|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in theory, any tree can be used for pulp-making, coniferous trees are preferred because the cellulose fibers in the pulp of these species are longer, and therefore make stronger paper.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.madehow.com/Volume-2/Paper.html Paper]&lt;/ref&gt;
Some of the most commonly used [[softwood]] trees for paper making include [[spruce]], [[pine]], [[fir]], [[larch]] and [[Tsuga|hemlock]], and [[hardwood]]s such as [[eucalyptus]], [[aspen]] and [[birch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fhUHBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA159&amp;dq=Wood+pulp+comes+from+softwood+trees&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi4l6KF4onYAhUK6WMKHdvbBgwQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Wood%20pulp%20comes%20from%20softwood%20trees&amp;f=false|title=Agricultural Finance: From Crops to Land, Water and Infrastructure|last=Geman|first=Helyette|date=2014-12-29|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9781118827376|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also increasing interest in [[Genetically_modified_tree|genetically modified tree species]] (such as GM [[eucalyptus]] and GM [[Populus|poplar]]), because of several major benefits these can provide, such as increased ease of breaking down lignin and increased growth rate.

A [[pulp mill]] is a manufacturing facility that converts wood chips or other plant fibre source into a thick fiberboard which can be shipped to a paper mill for further processing. Pulp can be manufactured using mechanical, semi-chemical or fully chemical methods (kraft and sulfite processes). The finished product may be either bleached or non-bleached, depending on the customer requirements.

Wood and other plant materials used to make pulp contain three main components (apart from water): cellulose fibers (desired for papermaking), [[lignin]] (a three-dimensional polymer that binds the cellulose fibres together) and [[hemicellulose]]s, (shorter branched carbohydrate polymers). The aim of pulping is to break down the bulk structure of the fibre source, be it chips, stems or other plant parts, into the constituent fibres.

Chemical pulping achieves this by degrading the lignin and hemicellulose into small, water-soluble molecules which can be washed away from the cellulose fibres without depolymerizing the cellulose fibres (chemically depolymerizing the cellulose weakens the fibres). The various mechanical pulping methods, such as groundwood (GW) and refiner mechanical (RMP) pulping, physically tear the cellulose fibres one from another. Much of the lignin remains adhering to the fibres. Strength is impaired because the fibres may be cut. There are a number of related hybrid pulping methods that use a combination of chemical and thermal treatment to begin an abbreviated chemical pulping process, followed immediately by a mechanical treatment to separate the fibres. These hybrid methods include thermomechanical pulping, also known as TMP, and chemithermomechanical pulping, also known as CTMP. The chemical and thermal treatments reduce the amount of energy subsequently required by the mechanical treatment, and also reduce the amount of strength loss suffered by the fibres.

=== Harvesting trees ===
{{Main|Logging}}
Most pulp mills use good [[forest management]] practices in harvesting trees to ensure that they have a sustainable source of raw materials. One of the major complaints about harvesting wood for pulp mills is that it reduces the [[biodiversity]] of the harvested forest.  Pulp [[tree plantations]] account for 16 percent of world pulp production, [[old-growth forest]]s 9 percent, and second- and third- and more generation forests account for the rest.&lt;ref name="chase"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecology.com/feature-stories/paper-chase/index.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20070619104819/http://www.ecology.com/feature-stories/paper-chase/index.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-06-19 |title=Paper Chase |accessdate=2007-09-21 |last=Martin |first=Sam |year=2004 |work= |publisher=Ecology Communications, Inc. |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reforestation]] is practiced in most areas, so trees are a [[renewable resource]].  The FSC ([[Forest Stewardship Council]]), SFI ([[Sustainable Forestry Initiative]]), PEFC ([[Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification]]), and other bodies certify paper made from trees harvested according to guidelines meant to ensure good forestry practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fsccanada.org/certification.htm |title=Certification Tracking products from the forest to the shelf|accessdate=2007-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of trees consumed depends on whether mechanical processes or chemical processes are used.  It has been estimated that based on a mixture of [[softwood]]s and [[hardwood]]s 12&amp;nbsp;metres (40&amp;nbsp;ft) tall and 15–20&amp;nbsp;centimetres (6–8&amp;nbsp;in) in diameter, it would take an average of 24 trees to produce 0.9&amp;nbsp;tonne (1&amp;nbsp;ton) of printing and writing paper, using the [[kraft process]] (chemical pulping).  Mechanical pulping is about twice as efficient in using trees, since almost all of the wood is used to make fibre, therefore it takes about 12 trees to make 0.9&amp;nbsp;tonne (1&amp;nbsp;ton) of mechanical pulp or [[newsprint]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conservatree.com/learn/EnviroIssues/TreeStats.shtml Trees Into Paper]. Conservatree. Retrieved on 2017-01-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are roughly two short tons in a [[Cord (unit)|cord of wood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.doa.state.wi.us/docs_view2.asp?docid=778 |title="dead link" |access-date=2009-02-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225140025/http://www.doa.state.wi.us/docs_view2.asp?docid=778 |archive-date=2008-12-25 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preparation for pulping===
{{Main| Woodchips}}
Wood chipping is the act and industry of chipping wood for pulp, but also for other [[Wood processing|processed wood]] products and [[mulch]]. Only the [[heartwood]] and [[sapwood (wood)|sapwood]] are useful for making pulp. [[Bark (botany)|Bark]] contains relatively few useful fibers and is removed and used as fuel to provide steam for use in the pulp mill. Most pulping processes require that the wood be chipped and screened to provide uniform sized chips.

===Pulping===
There are a number of different processes which can be used to separate the wood fiber:

====Mechanical pulp====
Manufactured [[grindstone]]s with embedded [[silicon carbide]] or [[aluminum oxide]] can be used to grind small wood logs called "bolts" to make stone  pulp (SGW). If the wood is steamed prior to grinding it is known as pressure ground wood pulp (PGW). Most modern mills use chips rather than logs and ridged metal discs called refiner plates instead of grindstones. If the chips are just ground up with the plates, the pulp is called refiner mechanical pulp (RMP) and if the chips are steamed while being refined the pulp is called thermomechanical pulp (TMP). Steam treatment significantly reduces the total energy needed to make the pulp and decreases the damage (cutting) to fibres. Mechanical pulps are used for products that require less strength, such as [[newsprint]] and [[paperboard]]s.

====Thermomechanical pulp====
[[File:Mechanicalpulping.png|thumb|300px|right|Mechanical pulping process.&lt;ref name=igg/&gt;]]

Thermomechanical pulp is pulp produced by processing [[Woodchips|wood chips]] using heat (thus "[[wikt:thermo-|thermo-]]") and a mechanical refining movement (thus "-mechanical"). It is a two-stage process where the logs are first stripped of their [[Bark (botany)|bark]] and converted into small chips. These chips have a moisture content of around 25–30 percent. A mechanical force is applied to the wood chips in a crushing or grinding action which generates heat and water vapour and softens the [[lignin]] thus separating the individual fibres. The pulp is then screened and cleaned, any clumps of fibre are reprocessed. This process gives a high yield of fibre from the [[timber]] (around 95 percent) and as the lignin has not been removed, the fibres are hard and rigid.&lt;ref name=igg&gt;{{Cite journal
|last=Iggesund Paperboard AB
|title=Paperboard the Iggesund Way
|year=2008
|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Chemithermomechanical pulp====
Wood chips can be pretreated with [[sodium carbonate]], [[sodium hydroxide]], [[sodium sulfite]] and other chemicals prior to refining with equipment similar to a mechanical mill. The conditions of the chemical treatment are much less vigorous (lower temperature, shorter time, less extreme [[pH]]) than in a chemical pulping process since the goal is to make the fibres easier to refine, not to remove lignin as in a fully chemical process. Pulps made using these hybrid processes are known as chemithermomechanical pulps (CTMP).

====Chemical pulp====
[[File:InternationalPaper6413.jpg|thumb|[[International Paper]] Company. Pulp mill that makes [[fluff pulp]] for use in [[Absorption (chemistry)|absorbent]] products with the [[kraft process]].]]
{{Main|Kraft process|Sulfite process|Soda pulping}}
{{See also|Dissolving pulp|Fluff pulp|NBSK|SBSK (pulp)}}
'''Chemical pulp''' is produced by combining wood chips and chemicals in large vessels called digesters. There, heat and chemicals break down lignin, which binds [[cellulose]] fibres together, without seriously degrading the [[cellulose fibre]]s. Chemical pulp is used for materials that need to be stronger or combined with mechanical pulps to give a product different characteristics. The [[kraft process]] is the dominant chemical pulping method, with the [[sulfite process]] second. Historically [[soda pulping]] was the first successful chemical pulping method.

====Recycled pulp====
{{Main|Paper recycling|Deinking}}
'''Recycled pulp''' is also called '''deinked pulp''' (DIP). DIP is [[paper recycling|recycled paper]] which has been processed by chemicals, thus removing [[printing ink]]s and other unwanted elements and freed the paper fibres. The process is called [[deinking]].

DIP is used as raw material in [[papermaking]]. Many [[newsprint]], [[toilet paper]] and [[facial tissue]] grades commonly contain 100 percent deinked pulp and in many other grades, such as lightweight coated for offset and printing and writing papers for office and home use, DIP makes up a substantial proportion of the furnish.

====Organosolv pulping====
{{Main|organosolv}}
Organosolv pulping uses organic solvents at temperatures above 140&amp;nbsp;°C to break down lignin and hemicellulose into soluble fragments. The pulping liquor is easily recovered by distillation. The reason for using a solvent is to make the [[lignin]] more soluble in the cooking liquor. Most common used solvents are [[methanol]], [[ethanol]], [[formic acid]] and [[acetic acid]] often in combination with [[water]].

====Alternative pulping methods====
Research is under way to develop biopulping (biological pulping), similar to chemical pulping but using certain species of [[fungus|fungi]] that are able to break down the unwanted lignin, but not the cellulose fibres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year= 2011 |title=Lignocellulolytic enzymes produced by tropical white rot fungi during biopulping of Acacia mangium wood chips|url=http://www.jbiochemtech.com/index.php/jbt/article/download/jbt322/83|author=Husaini, Ahmad; Fisol, Faisalina Ahmad; Yun, Liew Chia; Hussain, Mohd Hasnain; Muid, Sepiah and Roslan, Hairul Azman |journal= J Biochem Tech |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages= 245–250 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the biopulping process, the fungal enzyme [[lignin peroxidase]] selectively digests lignin to leave remaining cellulose fibres. This could have major [[Environmentally friendly|environmental benefits]] in reducing the pollution associated with chemical pulping. The pulp is bleached using chlorine dioxide stage followed by neutralization and calcium hypochlorite. The oxidizing agent in either case oxidizes and destroys the dyes formed from the tannins of the wood and accentuated (reinforced) by sulfides present in it.

[[Steam exploded fiber|Steam exploded fibre]] is a pulping and extraction technique that has been applied to wood and other fibrous organic material.&lt;ref name="Avella 1995"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/apmc.1995.052330113|title=Steam-exploded wheat straw fibres as reinforcing material for polypropylene-based composites.

===Bleaching===
{{Main|Bleaching of wood pulp}}
The pulp produced up to this point in the process can be [[bleaching of wood pulp|bleached]] to produce a [[white paper]] product. The chemicals used to bleach pulp have been a source of environmental concern, and recently the pulp industry has been using alternatives to [[chlorine]], such as [[chlorine dioxide]], [[oxygen]], [[ozone]] and [[hydrogen peroxide]].

The modern source fiber is most often cotton, with a much higher value given to paper made from linen, hemp, [[abaca]], [[kozo]] or other fibers. 100% cotton, or a combination of cotton and linen pulp is used for certificates, currency, and passports.&lt;ref name="DeLaRue"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.delarue.com/ProductsSolutions/BanknoteProduction/TheBanknoteLifecyc/|title=Markets|work=delarue.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= |first= |authorlink= |title=Banknotes design and production |work= |publisher=Bank of Canada |url=http://www.bankofcanada.ca/en/banknotes/facts.html |doi= |accessdate=February 7, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216040303/http://www.bankofcanada.ca/en/banknotes/facts.html |archivedate=December 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Money is Made - Paper and Ink |work= |publisher=BUREAU OF ENGRAVING AND PRINTING U.S. Department of the Treasury  |url=https://www.moneyfactory.gov/hmimpaperandink.html  |accessdate=July 14, 2017  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Abaca pulp has very long, strong fibers, and is used for teabags.

Today, some people and groups{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} advocate using field crop fibre or agricultural residues instead of wood fibre as being more [[sustainability|sustainable]].

There is enough [[straw]] to meet much of North America's book, magazine, catalogue and copy paper needs.  Agricultural-based paper does not come from [[tree farm]]s.  Some agricultural residue pulps take less time to cook than wood pulps. That means agricultural-based paper uses less energy, less water and fewer chemicals. Pulp made from wheat and flax straw has half the ecological footprint of pulp made from forests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Canopy's Straw Paper Campaign |url=http://canopyplanet.org/what-we-do/straw-paper/growing-new-paper-options/ |publisher=canopyplanet.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130903152604/http://canopyplanet.org/what-we-do/straw-paper/growing-new-paper-options/ |archivedate=2013-09-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hemp#Paper|Hemp paper]] is a possible replacement, but processing infrastructure, storage costs and the low usability percentage of the plant means it is not a ready substitute.

However, wood is also a renewable resource, with about 90 percent of pulp coming from [[plantation]]s or reforested areas.&lt;ref name="chase"/&gt; Non-wood fibre sources account for about 5–10 percent of global pulp production, for a variety of reasons, including seasonal availability, problems with chemical recovery, brightness of the pulp etc.&lt;ref name="market"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Judt |first=Manfred  |authorlink= |date=Oct–Dec 2001 |title= Nonwoody Plant Fibre Pulps|journal=Inpaper International |volume= |issue= |pages= |id= |url=http://www.inpaper.com/magzines/inpaper/oct-dec-y1k/analysis-4.htm |accessdate= 2007-10-07 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-wood pulp processing requires a high use of water and energy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.southcn.com/gdnews/nanyuedadi/content/2009-07/20/content_5389863.htm 造纸企业能入“绿色之门”的前提 南粤大地 南方网].

==Market pulp==
Market pulp is any variety of pulp that is produced in one location, dried and shipped to another location for further processing.&lt;ref name=marketpulp&gt;{{Cite book| last = Nanko | first = Hirko |author2=Button, Allan |author3=Hillman, Dave | title = The World of Market Pulp | publisher = WOMP, LLC | year = 2005 | location = Appleton, Wisconsin, USA | pages = 2–3 | isbn = 0-615-13013-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Important quality parameters for pulp not directly related to the fibres are [[brightness]], dirt levels, viscosity and ash content. In 2004 it accounted for about 55 million [[metric tons]] of market pulp.&lt;ref name=marketpulp/&gt;

Air dry pulp is the most common form to sell pulp. This is pulp dried to about 10 percent moisture content. It is normally delivered as sheeted bales of 250&amp;nbsp;kg. The reason to leave 10 percent moisture in the pulp is that this minimizes the fibre to fibre bonding and makes it easier to disperse the pulp in water for further processing to [[paper]].&lt;ref name=marketpulp /&gt;

Roll pulp or ''reel pulp'' is the most common delivery form of pulp to non traditional pulp markets. [[Fluff pulp]] is normally shipped on rolls (reels). This pulp is dried to 5–6 percent moisture content. At the customer this is going to a comminution process to prepare for further processing.&lt;ref name=marketpulp /&gt;

Some pulps are flash dried. This is done by pressing the pulp to about 50 percent moisture content and then let it fall through [[silo]]s that are 15–17 m high. Gas fired hot air is the normal heat source. The temperature is well above the [[charring|char point]] of [[cellulose]], but large amount of moisture in the [[cell wall|fibre wall]] and [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] prevents the fibres from being incinerated. It is often not dried down to 10 percent moisture (air dry). The bales are not as densely packed as air dry pulp.&lt;ref name=marketpulp /&gt;

==Environmental concerns==
{{Main|Environmental issues with paper}}
The major environmental impacts of producing wood pulp come from its impact on forest sources and from its waste products.

===Forest resources===
{{Main|Forest management}}
The impact of logging to provide the raw material for wood pulp is an area of intense debate. Modern [[logging]] practices, using [[forest management]] seek to provide a reliable, renewable source of raw materials for [[pulp mill]]s. The practice of [[clear cutting]] is a particularly sensitive issue since it is a very visible effect of [[logging]]. [[Reforestation]], the planting of tree seedlings on logged areas, has also been criticized for decreasing [[biodiversity]] because reforested areas are [[monocultures]].
Logging of [[old growth forest]]s accounts for less than 10 percent of wood pulp,&lt;ref name="chase"/&gt; but is one of the most controversial issues.

===Effluents from pulp mills===
{{Main|Kraft process|Sulfite process|Bleaching of wood pulp}}

The process effluents are treated in a biological [[Industrial wastewater treatment|effluent treatment plant]], which guarantees that the effluents are not toxic in the recipient.

Mechanical pulp is not a major cause for environmental concern since most of the organic material is retained in the pulp, and the chemicals used ([[hydrogen peroxide]] and [[sodium dithionite]]) produce benign byproducts (water and [[sodium sulfate]] (finally), respectively).

Chemical pulp mills, especially kraft mills, are energy self-sufficient and very nearly closed cycle with respect to inorganic chemicals.

[[Bleaching of wood pulp|Bleaching]] with chlorine  produces large amounts of [[organochlorine]] compounds, including [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxins]].&lt;ref name="can"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ewh-semt/pubs/contaminants/psl1-lsp1/pulp_mill_effluents_pate_blanchie/index_e.html |title=Effluents from Pulp Mills using Bleaching – PSL1 |accessdate=2007-09-21 |last= |first= |year=1991 |work= {{ISBN|0-662-18734-2}} DSS |publisher=Health Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Odor problems===
The kraft pulping reaction in particular releases foul-smelling compounds. The hydrogen sulfide reagent that degrades lignin structure also causes some demethylation to produce [[methanethiol]], [[dimethyl sulfide]] and [[dimethyl disulfide]].  These same compounds are released during many forms of microbial decay, including the internal microbial action in [[Camembert cheese]], although the kraft process is a chemical one and does not involve any microbial degradation.  These compounds have extremely low odor thresholds and disagreeable smells.

==Applications==
The main applications for pulp are [[paper]] and [[Paperboard|board]] production. The furnish of pulps used depends on the quality on the finished paper. Important quality parameters are [[Pulpwood|wood furnish]], [[Bleaching of wood pulp|brightness]], viscosity, extractives, dirt count and strength.

Chemical pulps are used for making [[nanocellulose]].

Speciality pulp grades have many other applications. [[Dissolving pulp]] is used in making [[Viscose|regenerated cellulose]] that is used [[Rayon|textile]] and [[cellophane]] production. It is also used to make [[cellulose]] derivatives. [[Fluff pulp]] is used in [[diapers]], [[feminine hygiene]] products and [[Nonwoven fabric|nonwovens]].

===Paper production===
{{Main|Fourdrinier machine}}
The Fourdrinier Machine is the basis for most modern [[papermaking]], and it has been used in some variation since its conception. It accomplishes all the steps needed to transform a source of wood pulp into a final [[paper]] product.

==Economics==
In 2009, [[NBSK]] pulp sold for $650/ton in the United States.  The price had dropped due to falling demand when newspapers reduced their size, in part, as a result of the recession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Lefebrvre | first = Paul |title = Wood products market looks soft | publisher = [[The Chronicle (Barton, Vermont)|The Chronicle]] | date = February 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sandia method''' (also known as Veers method) is a method for generating a turbulent wind profile that can be used in aero-elastic software to evaluate the fatigue imparted on a turbine in a turbulent environment. That is, it generates time series of wind speeds at a set of points on a surface, say the plane of the rotor of a wind turbine. Analysis is performed initially in the frequency domain, where turbulence can be described quantitatively with more ease than the time domain. Then, the time series are obtained by inverse fast Fourier transforms.

In its original form, the Sandia method only simulates the u-component of the wind; that is, the wind was modelled as propagating in a direction perpendicular to the plane of the rotor. Work carried out by NREL, specifically Kelley, suggested that a considerable amount of turbulent energy existed in the v-component (the v-component is parallel to both the plane of the rotor and the Earth). As such, the Sandia method was upgraded such that it included the v-component and w-component. Further upgrades have been performed such that the wind profile exhibits cross-axis correlation (turbulent fluctuations in one component being somehow connected to turbulent fluctuations in another). However, these are not considered in this article.

== Point-wind speed spectra ==

Although turbulence leads to unpredictable results in the time domain, it can, to some extent, be characterized in the frequency domain. Turbulent fluctuations are dominated by low frequency components, with higher frequency components having less influence. For further information, see [[Turbulence#Kolmogorov's theory of 1941|Kolmogorov's theory on turbulence]].

Several models of frequency domain representations of point wind speeds have been developed: the [[von Kármán wind turbulence model]] and [[Dryden Wind Turbulence Model]] are examples of such.

===Discretizing a spectrum ===

A spectrum in its original form is a continuous function. However, computer programmes operate on discrete functions. Thus a modification to whatever type of spectrum, be it Kaimal, von Karman, or some other spectrum, is needed. This is given below:

:&lt;math&gt;
S(\omega_k) = S(\omega = \omega_k)\Delta\omega/2
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;S(\omega_k)&lt;/math&gt; is the discretized spectrum evaluated only at the discrete frequencies &lt;math&gt;\omega_k&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;S(\omega = \omega_k)&lt;/math&gt; is the continuous spectrum evaluated at &lt;math&gt;\omega = \omega_k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Delta\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the size of the step between consecutive frequencies being considered.

== Coherence ==

When generating a time series of wind speeds for a set of points across a surface, coherence needs to be taken into account. That is, the instantaneous wind speed at some point, A, will bear some resemblance to the wind speed at some other point, B. Clearly, the resemblance is influenced by the separation of points A and B. That is, two points separated by a large distance will show less similarity to each other than two neighbouring points on the surface. 
In addition, one would expect low frequency components of the wind speeds at points A and B to show more correlation than high frequency components. As such, many coherence functions have been proposed: Davenport, Solari, etc. The Solari coherence spectrum is provided as an example:

:&lt;math&gt;
Coh_{ijk} = \exp^{-2C\Delta r_{ij} \omega_k/(u_i + u_j)}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is a constant, &lt;math&gt;\Delta r_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is the separation of points &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; on the surface, &lt;math&gt;\omega_k&lt;/math&gt; is the frequency, and &lt;math&gt;u_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u_j&lt;/math&gt; are the mean wind speeds at points &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; respectively. The indices &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; run from 1 to n, and the index &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; covers the frequency range. From the coherence function stems the coherence matrix. To cover all relationships between all points, the coherence function must be an &lt;math&gt;n^2&lt;/math&gt;-by-&lt;math&gt;n^2&lt;/math&gt;-by-&lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; matrix. Clearly, the coherence matrix is symmetric about the main diagonal if we are restricting ourselves to looking at the coherence function at a single frequency. This is because the spatial separation between points A and B is the same as the spatial separation between B and A. That is, for a n-by-n grid, only &lt;math&gt;(n^4 + n^2)/2&lt;/math&gt; elements need to be calculated for each frequency.

It is worth noting at this point that whilst the coherence matrix is strictly a 3-dimensional matrix (i, j, and k), computer programmes which implement the Sandia method typically reduce the coherence matrix to a 2-dimensional matrix where the frequency dimension has been 'removed'. This is to ease computational requirements. A 2-dimensional matrix is also required to perform some of the actions on the spectral matrix, such as a Cholesky decomposition, which is mentioned later. Of course, variation in frequency is still applied. However, the following process is carried out in full for one given frequency before proceeding to the next frequency. As such, in the following section, a power spectrum refers to the value of the power spectrum at a given frequency and not the full set of values across the frequency range being used. That is,

:&lt;math&gt;
Coh_{ijk} \rightarrow Coh_{ij}(\omega_k)
&lt;/math&gt;

and

&lt;math&gt;
S_{ijk} \rightarrow S_{ij}(\omega_k)&lt;/math&gt;

where an element of S, &lt;math&gt;S_{ijk}&lt;/math&gt; , would have given the strength of the spectrum at a particular frequency &lt;math&gt;\omega_k&lt;/math&gt; at a particular point in space.

== Generating turbulence ==

Power spectra are needed for each of the &lt;math&gt;n^2&lt;/math&gt; points on the surface; this encapsulates information about the turbulence intensity for each point. It should be noted that under IEC standards, only one power spectrum is used; that is, all &lt;math&gt;n^2&lt;/math&gt; points have the same turbulence intensity.

With the power spectra, the spectral matrix can be formed. This a &lt;math&gt;n^2&lt;/math&gt;-by-&lt;math&gt;n^2&lt;/math&gt; matrix. The main diagonal of the spectral matrix contains the previously defined spectra for all &lt;math&gt;n^2&lt;/math&gt; points on the surface. The off-main diagonal elements contain all the cross spectra between the points. The cross spectra are determined by the following function:

:&lt;math&gt;
S_{ij}(\omega_k) = Coh_{ij}(\omega_k)\sqrt{S_{ii}(\omega_k)S_{jj}(\omega_k)}
&lt;/math&gt;

Due to the symmetry of the coherence matrix, only &lt;math&gt;(n^4 + n^2)/2&lt;/math&gt; elements are independent. This property can be exploited to lighten memory requirements when writing a programme to simulate the Sandia method.

The spectral matrix, &lt;math&gt;S(\omega_k)&lt;/math&gt;, can be written as the matrix product of a matrix, &lt;math&gt;H(\omega_k)&lt;/math&gt;, and its transpose. That is,

:&lt;math&gt;
S(\omega_k) = H(\omega_k)H(\omega_k)^T
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;H(\omega_k)&lt;/math&gt; is ultimately needed to obtain the complex Fourier co-efficients of the Fourier transforms of the time series of the wind speeds at all the points on the surface. Note - if the Fourier transform of a time domain function, &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt;, is &lt;math&gt;X(\omega)&lt;/math&gt;, then the resultant spectrum is &lt;math&gt;S(\omega) \propto X(\omega)X^*(\omega)&lt;/math&gt;; for multiple time domain functions, the Fourier co-efficients can be stored in a matrix, which then means that the above equation is applicable.

Obviously, there are an infinite number of solutions to the above expression; consequently, the assumption that &lt;math&gt;H(\omega_k)&lt;/math&gt; is a lower triangular matrix is made such that only one solution exists. The solution can be found via a Cholesky decomposition. The resultant &lt;math&gt;H(\omega_k)&lt;/math&gt; matrix can be thought of as the weighting factors for the
linear combination of N independent, unit-magnitude, white-noise inputs that will
yield N correlated outputs with the correct spectral matrix.&lt;ref&gt;Veers - Three-dimensional wind simulation&lt;/ref&gt;

To get the complex Fourier co-efficients associated with the Fourier transform of the time series of the wind speeds, a column vector, &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is obtained by multiply the &lt;math&gt;H(\omega_k)&lt;/math&gt; matrix by a column vector containing &lt;math&gt;n^2&lt;/math&gt; values of Gaussian white noise, &lt;math&gt;X(\omega_k)&lt;/math&gt;, as shown below:

:&lt;math&gt;
V(\omega_k) = H(\omega_k)X(\omega_k)
&lt;/math&gt;

The column vector gives the Fourier co-efficients for all points on the grid at a given frequency. This is then built up into a two dimensional matrix which covers the complex Fourier co-efficients for all points across all frequencies. Then, an inverse fast Fourier transform is performed to get the time series. That is,

:&lt;math&gt;
V_i(\omega_k) \rightarrow V_{ik}
&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:Audion-sterling-blue.jpg|thumb|right|A SET tube audio amplifier.]]

A '''single-ended triode''' ('''SET''') is a [[vacuum tube]] [[electronic amplifier]] that uses a single [[triode]] to produce an output, in contrast to a [[Push-pull output|push-pull]] amplifier which uses a pair of devices with [[antiphase]] inputs to generate an output with the wanted signals added and the distortion components subtracted. Single-ended amplifiers normally operate in Class A; push-pull amplifiers can also operate in Classes AB or B {{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} without excessive net distortion, due to cancellation.

The term '''single-ended triode amplifier''' is mainly used for output stages of [[audio power amplifier]]s.
The phrase '''directly heated triode single-ended triode amplifier''' (abbreviated to '''DHT SET''') is used when [[directly heated triode]]s are used.

There are also '''single-ended [[tetrode]]''', '''[[beam tetrode]]/beam power tube/kinkless tetrode''', and '''[[pentode]]''' amplifiers with the same functionality and similar circuitry; e.g.  this [[Mullard]] design.&lt;ref name=mullard33&gt;[http://diyaudioprojects.com/Schematics/Mullard-SE-EL84-Tube-Amp-Schematic.htm "Mullard Single Ended EL84 Tube Amplifier"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Audio power amplifiers==

A typical triode audio power amplifier will have a driver that provides voltage gain, coupled to a triode (like 2A3 and [[300B]]) or a pentode or kinkless tetrode such as [[EL34]] or [[KT88]] connected as a triode, connected to the [[loudspeaker]] through an [[Transformer#Audio transformers|audio transformer]] in a [[common cathode]] arrangement. The triode is biased to Class A operation by applying a suitable negative [[bias voltage]] to its input [[control grid]] (see diagram), or by raising the cathode potential with biasing components.

[[Image:Single-ended triode power stage.gif]]

In traditional SET amp, the direct current of output triode (from 30 [[Milliampere|mA]] for triode-strapped [[6V6]] to 250 [[Milliampere|mA]] for [[6C33C]]) flows continuously through the [[primary winding]] of a transformer. This requires inserting a [[Transformer#Cores|gap]] in the transformer core to prevent [[Saturation (magnetic)|core saturation]] by DC current; adding a gap decreases primary [[inductance]] and limits bass response; the inductance and bass response can be restored by using a larger transformer than if the DC were not present.

An alternative schematic, [[parafeed amplifier]], solves bandwidth problem by blocking direct current from output transformer (which does not need to be gapped, thus improving its bass response). Power supply is reconfigured into a [[constant current source]], usually with a massive, high-inductance anode choke (gapped [[inductor]]), so there is little, if any, gain in cost and weight of magnetic components.

A stereo class A single-ended design with KT88 kinkless tetrodes which produces 15W of output power per channel, and 5W when triode-connected, is the Antique Sound Lab MG-SI15DT.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hometheaterhifi.com/volume_8_1/antique-sound-lab-15dt-tube-amp-1-2001.html Product Review - Antique Sound Lab MG-SI15DT Single Ended Integrated Tube Amplifier - January, 2001]&lt;/ref&gt; By comparison a pair of the same tubes in class AB push-pull claim to output about 50W at 1% distortion (higher powers at high distortion are quoted for [[guitar amplifier]]s).

===Benefits===
* Simplicity. An audio amplifier cannot be much simpler than a Class A single-ended.
* Overall low harmonic distortion with small signals. By nature Class A amplifiers do not suffer from crossover distortion.
* Small roaming of anode bias current does not do anything catastrophic.

===Drawbacks===
* Low efficiency. All Class A amplifiers consume full power regardless of the signal amplitude.
* Second harmonic distortion at high signal level is a normal feature of single-ended amplifiers.
* Compared to the amplifier's low power the output transformer is heavy and expensive.

==Speaker matching==

Historically, [[Electronic amplifier#Negative feedback|negative feedback]] in single ended pentode amplifiers was quite common (for example, the Mullard 3-3 design built around [[EL84]]&lt;ref name=mullard33/&gt;). Today negative feedback is less popular with SET amplifiers, with many having no overall feedback loop. Their frequency response, limited by [[transformer]] passband, is then modulated by irregularities in [[loudspeaker]] [[Electrical impedance|impedance]]. This, and the very low attainable power levels (3 Watts for 2A3 to 20 Watts for [[6C33C]]), requires careful matching of amplifier to speakers; selection is usually limited to high-efficiency loudspeakers with a [[Sensitivity (electronics)|sensitivity]] exceeding 90 [[Decibel|dB]]/Watt.

==Audio quality==

Single-ended triode (SET) amplifiers are considered a classic design among certain [[audiophile]]s and have achieved a cult status because of their alleged excellent midband performance (argued to be the most important part of the audio spectrum in music reproduction), "musicality" and "directness." This perceived high sonic quality is mainly attributed to the simplicity and minimalistic approach of the circuits involved and the triode amplifying tubes that are typically used.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

On the other hand, the legitimacy of branding single-ended triode amplifiers as adequate for Hi-Fi purposes is debated, as from a technical standpoint, SET amplifiers are considered to be generally far inferior to subsequent (and more common) push-pull tube designs or solid-state amplifiers:&lt;ref name="Elliott"&gt;{{cite web|last=Elliott|first=Rod|title=Valve (Vacuum Tube) Amplifier Design Considerations - ESP (Elliott Sound Products)|url=http://sound.whsites.net/valves/design.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; SET designs require output transformers which are able to cope with a strong DC component in the signal, which causes them to have worse performance in regard to frequency response, distortion and efficiency (although the latter is not generally a priority for most SET enthusiasts, or audiophiles in general). Furthermore, as SET amplifiers have a relatively high output impedance, it is hard to couple them effectively to a loudspeaker which hasn't been designed especially to be driven by a high output impedance amplifier, as this will cause the amplifier to be much more sensitive to the loudspeaker's impedance characteristics across the spectrum, resulting in coloration.

In general, the configuration will usually provide higher measured distortion performance compared to high feedback amplifiers.&lt;ref name="Elliott"/&gt; This distortion is predominantly second harmonic which is not unpleasant to the ear (the second harmonic for an A on the musical scale at 440&amp;nbsp;Hz is 880&amp;nbsp;Hz which is, obviously, also an A i.e., the same note just an octave higher){{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}, but by definition their high THD figures make SET amplifiers inaccurate. In a push pull amplifier this second harmonic distortion is cancelled in the output transformer.  Several percent THD is not unusual at full power output, but will be much lower at normal music levels.  Some builders and users have concluded that while global feedback reduces distortion across the harmonic range, it also reduces the dramatic dynamics associated with a SET amplifier and the highly efficient speaker needed to enjoy a low power amplifier, but this is also strongly debated.

Apart from the field of hi-fi amplification, SET amplifiers are well regarded by some in the guitar world precisely due to their distortion characteristics, which may considered desirable in the context of musical instrument amplification, as their aim isn't accuracy but expressiveness and harmonic complexity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What Do the Terms "Push-Pull" and "Single-Ended" Mean?|url=http://www.aikenamps.com/SingleEnded.htm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130124154138/http://www.aikenamps.com/SingleEnded.htm|archivedate=2013-01-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Estimating power output for a Class A1 amplifier from valve specifications ==

In class A, in order to produce a full sine wave, the tube must be exactly half-way on. Therefore, the maximum current swing is +/- 50%. No actual amplifier will ever achieve this.

Obtain the following parameters:
*Pa (or P[a+g2] for pentodes) (in watts).
*Rp in triode (in ohms),
*load resistance (Rl) (in ohms) (which may vary depending on the design.)

Compute maximum theoretical power output by P[ot] = Pa / 2.

While the valve can be driven all the way to shut-off fairly easily, the maximum current will be limited by the internal resistance of the valve as the grid reaches the voltage of the cathode and is not impeding electron flow. For this reason, valves that have a low Rp can yield more power in class A1 than other valves with similar Pa ratings.

Next, compute P[o] = P[ot] * (1 - Rp/Rl) to obtain an estimate of the maximum obtainable output power.

Deduct 10% from this figure to account for the relatively heavy distortion encountered as the valve approaches cut-off.

== Class A2 ==

Class A2 amplifiers can overcome a high Rp by driving the grid positive with respect to the cathode. Because this makes the grid a secondary anode, it too will draw current from the cathode while accelerating the remaining electrons towards the plate. Grid currents can place extreme demands on the driving circuitry, sometimes requiring as much as 8 watts input for larger tubes such as the 211.

'''Solar power in Australia''' is a growing industry. As of September 2018, [[Australia]] had over 10,131 MW of installed [[Photovoltaics|photovoltaic]] (PV) [[solar power]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pv-map.apvi.org.au/analyses|title=Australian PV market since April 2001|work=apvi.org.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; of which 3,366 MW were installed in the preceding 12 months. In 2017, 23 solar PV projects with a combined installed capacity of 2,034 MW were either under construction, constructed or due to start construction having reached financial closure.&lt;ref name="Current RE Projects"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://numerical.co.in/numerons/collection/58a1400426cc65d01e2f3b1a|title="2017: Biggest year for Australia's Renewable Energy Industry"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; PV accounted for 3.8% of Australia's electrical energy production in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cleanenergycouncil.org.au/dam/cec/policy-and-advocacy/reports/2018/cea-report-2018.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Feed-in tariffs in Australia|Feed-in tariffs]] and [[Energy policy of Australia#Renewable energy targets|renewable energy target]]s designed to assist [[Renewable energy in Australia|renewable energy commercialisation in Australia]] have largely been responsible for the rapid increase. In [[South Australia]], a solar feed-in tariff was introduced for households and an educational program that involved installing PVs on the roofs of major public buildings such as the Adelaide Airport, State Parliament, Museum, Art Gallery and several hundred public schools.&lt;ref&gt;Centre for National Policy, What States Can Do: Climate Change Policy, April 4, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, the Queensland government introduced the Affordable Energy Plan offering interest free loans for solar panels and solar storage in an effort to increase the uptake of solar energy in the state.&lt;ref&gt; [https://gienergy.com.au/3-new-queensland-government-interest-free-loans-solar-storage-2018/ 3 new Queensland Government Interest-free loans for solar and storage in 2018], June 29, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 [[Premier of South Australia|Premier]] [[Mike Rann]] announced funding for $8 million worth of solar panels on the roof of the new Goyder Pavilion at the [[Royal Adelaide Showgrounds]], the largest rooftop solar installation in Australia, qualifying it for official "power station" status.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/ June 2, 2008. "Adelaide Showgrounds to have nations biggest solar power project"&lt;/ref&gt;  South Australia has the highest per capita take up of household solar power in Australia. 

The installed PV capacity in Australia has increased 10-fold between 2009 and 2011, and quadrupled between 2011 and 2016. 
The first commercial-scale PV power plant, the 1 MW ''Uterne Solar Power Station'', was opened in 2011.&lt;ref name="AliceSolarCity"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alicesolarcity.com.au/uterne-solar-power-station |title=Uterne Solar Power Station|work=alicesolarcity.com.au |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125163756/http://www.alicesolarcity.com.au/uterne-solar-power-station |archivedate=25 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Greenough River Solar Farm]] opened in 2012 with a capacity of 10 MW.&lt;ref name="Greenough"&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/10/australia-greenough-river-solar-power_n_1953190.html Australia's Greenough River Solar Farm Opens Amid Renewable Target Debate], Reuters, Rebekah Kebede, 9 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt; 
The price of photovoltaics has been decreasing, and in January 2013, was less than half the cost of using [[grid power|grid electricity]] in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cleantechnica.com/2013/01/07/solar-electricity-now-under-half-the-cost-of-grid-power-for-australian-households/|title=Solar Electricity Now Under Half The Cost Of Grid Power For Australian Households|work=CleanTechnica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australia has been internationally criticised for producing very little of its energy from solar power, despite its vast resources, extensive sunshine and overall high potential.&lt;ref name=sunniest&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.currentresults.com/Weather-Extremes/sunniest-places-countries-world.php |title=Sunniest places in the world |publisher=Current Results.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-25751086|title=Is Australia falling out of love with solar power?|work=[[BBC News]]|date=5 February 2014|accessdate=17 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2014/08/15/3471837/queensland-energy-fee-kills-solar/|title=In Australia, businesses are getting hit with a $500 fee designed to kill solar power|work=ThinkProgress|date=15 August 2014|accessdate=17 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reneweconomy.com.au/2014/us-solar-giant-quits-australia-due-policy-uncertainty-63071|title=US solar giant quits Australia|work=Renew Economy|accessdate=17 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ausrenewpolicy"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Byrnes |first=L. |last2=Brown |first2=C. |last3=Foster |first3=J. |last4=Wagner |first4=L. |date=December 2013 |title=Australian renewable energy policy: Barriers and challenges |journal=Renewable Energy |volume=60 |pages=711–721 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960148113003170 |doi=10.1016/j.renene.2013.06.024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Potential ==
[[File:SolarGIS-Solar-map-Australia-en.png|thumb|[[Insolation|Solar potential]] in Australia]]
The combination of [[Climate of Australia|Australia's dry climate]] and latitude give it high benefits and potential for solar energy production. Most of the Australian continent receives in excess of {{convert|4|kWh}} per square metre per day of [[insolation]] during winter months, with a region in the north exceeding {{convert|6|kWh}} per square metre per day.

Australia's insolation greatly exceeds the average values in Europe, Russia, and most of North America. Comparable levels are found in desert areas of northern and southern Africa, south western United States and adjacent area of Mexico, and regions on the Pacific coast of South America. However, the areas of highest insolation are distant to Australia's population centres.

With an installed photovoltaic capacity of 5,900 MW at the end of 2016, Australia ranks among the [[Growth of photovoltaics|world's top ten solar countries]]. The installed capacity in 2015 was 5,070 MW.

=== Rebates ===
The Solar Homes and Communities Plan was a rebate provided by the Australian Government of up to A$8,000 for installing solar panels on homes and community use buildings (other than schools).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.environment.gov.au/settlements/renewable/pv/index.html Solar Homes and Communities Plan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203183854/http://environment.gov.au/settlements/renewable/pv/index.html |date=3 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This rebate was phased out on 8 June 2009, to be replaced by the Solar Credits Program, where an installation of a solar system would receive 5 times as many Renewable Energy Certificates for the first 1.5 kilowatts of capacity under the Renewable Energy Target (see below).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orer.gov.au|title=Office of the Renewable Energy Regulator|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070504235738/http://www.orer.gov.au/|archivedate=4 May 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schools were eligible to apply for grants of up to A$50,000 to install 2&amp;nbsp;kW solar panels and other measures through the National Solar Schools Program beginning on 1 July 2008, which replaced the Green Vouchers for Schools program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/programs/greenvouchers/index.html|title=The National Solar Schools Program is on the way|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Applications for the program ended 21 November 2012. A total of 2,870 schools have installed solar panels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.climatechange.gov.au/government/initiatives/national-solar-schools.aspx|title=National Solar Schools Program|work=climatechange.gov.au|accessdate=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The output of each array can be viewed, and compared with that of up to four other schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solarschools.net/|title=solarschools.net :: Data Monitoring|work=solarschools.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Feed-in tariffs ===
{{Main article|Feed-in tariffs in Australia}}
A number of states have set up schemes to encourage the uptake of solar PV power generation involving households installing solar panels and selling excess electricity to electricity retailers to put into the electricity grid, widely called "feed-in". Each scheme involves the setting of [[PV financial incentives#Australia|feed in tariffs]], which can be classified by a number of factors including the price paid, whether it is on a net or gross export basis, the length of time payments are guaranteed, the maximum size of installation allowed and the type of customer allowed to participate. Many Australian state feed-in tariffs were net export tariffs, whereas conservation groups argued for gross feed-in tariffs. In March 2009, the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) started a solar gross feed-in tariff. For systems up to 10&amp;nbsp;kW the payment was 50.05 cents per kWh. For systems from 10&amp;nbsp;kW to 30&amp;nbsp;kW the payment was 40.04 cents per kWh. The payment was revised downward once before an overall capacity cap was reached and the scheme closed. Payments are made quarterly based on energy generated and the payment rate is guaranteed for 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.environment.act.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/144645/FiTFactSheet.pdf|title=ACT Govt. Feed In Tariff factsheet|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.matthewb.id.au/media/Solar_Power_Calculator.html|title=Solar Power Calculator|author=Matthew Bulat|work=matthewb.id.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Germany, a guaranteed PV tariff means that (as of 2006) Germany now has the highest PV capacity per capita – at 10&amp;nbsp;W for every person in Germany compared to Australia at 2.6&amp;nbsp;W per capita.&lt;ref&gt;Supply side options for WA stationary energy: An assessment of alternative technologies and development support mechanisms in the Final report to WA Greenhouse and Energy Taskforce by Next Energy on 26 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Renewable energy targets ===
{{Main article|Energy policy of Australia#Renewable energy targets}}
In 2001, the Australian government introduced a mandatory renewable energy target (MRET) designed to ensure renewable energy achieves a 20% share of electricity supply in Australia by 2020. The MRET was to increase new generation from 9,500 gigawatt-hours to 45,000 gigawatt-hours by 2020. The MRET requires wholesale purchasers of electricity (such as electricity retailers or industrial operations) to purchase renewable energy certificates (RECs), created through the generation of electricity from renewable sources, including wind, hydro, [[landfill gas]] and geothermal, as well as solar PV and solar thermal. The objective is to provide a stimulus and additional revenue for these technologies. The scheme was proposed to continue until 2030.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orer.gov.au/legislation/index.html Australian Government: Office of the Renewable Energy Regulator]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111026164549/http://www.orer.gov.au/legislation/index.html |date=26 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Subsidy funding ===
The Solar Flagships program sets aside $1.6 billion for [[solar power]] over six years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/BudgetReview200910/ClimateEnergy |title= Budget 2009 10: Climate change and energy| publisher= Parliament of Australia |date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government funding is for 4 new solar plants that produce coal plant scale power (in total up to 1000&amp;nbsp;MW - coal plants typically produce 500 to 2,000&amp;nbsp;MW). This subsidy would need additional funding from the plant builders and/or operators. As a comparison Abengoa Solar, a company currently constructing solar thermal plants, put the cost of a 300&amp;nbsp;MW plant at €1.2 billion in 2007. In 2009, the Arizona state government announced a 200&amp;nbsp;MW plant for US$1 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://greenmodesustainabilitydevelopments.blogspot.com/2009/05/big-solar-for-oz.html|title=GreenMode Sustainability Developments: Big Solar for Oz|work=greenmodesustainabilitydevelopments.blogspot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azcommerce.com/Newsroom/ViewRelease.aspx?1971 |title=404 |work=azcommerce.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090513230250/http://www.azcommerce.com/Newsroom/ViewRelease.aspx?1971 |archivedate=13 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Australian Capital Territory ===
A 20 MWp solar power plant has been built on 50 hectares of land in [[Royalla, New South Wales#Australian Capital Territory|Royalla]], a rural part of the [[Australian Capital Territory]] south of [[Canberra]]. It is powered by 83,000 solar panels, and can power 4,400 homes. It was officially opened on 3 September 2014. It is the first solar plant facility in the Australian capital, and at the time of building the largest such plant in Australia. The facility was built by a Spanish company, Fotowatio Renewable Ventures (FRV).&lt;ref name="ABC5716500"&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-09-03/royalla-solar-farm-opens-south-of-canberra/5716500 'Australia's largest' solar farm opens at Royalla south of Canberra], Jonathon Gul and Kathleen Dyett, [[ABC News Online]], 3 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://greenpowerco.com.au/big-solar-power-a-big-deal-in-the-act-and-beyond/|title=Big Solar Power a Big Deal in the ACT and Beyond - The Green Power Company|work=The Green Power Company  - Solar Power Systems}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Northern Territory ===
There are 30 solar concentrator dishes at three locations in the [[Northern Territory]]: [[Hermannsburg, Northern Territory|Hermannsburg]], [[Yuendumu, Northern Territory|Yuendumu]] and [[Lajamanu, Northern Territory|Lajamanu]]. [[Solar Systems (company)|Solar Systems]] and the Federal government were involved in the projects.

The solar concentrator dish power stations together generate 720&amp;nbsp;kW and 1,555,000 kWh per year, representing a saving of 420,000 litres of diesel and 1,550 tonnes of [[greenhouse gas emissions]].&lt;ref name="ssp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solarsystems.com.au/projects.html|title=Solar Systems - Solar Systems|website=www.solarsystems.com.au|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110218145048/http://www.solarsystems.com.au/projects.html|archivedate=18 February 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The solar power stations at these three remote indigenous communities in Australia's [[Northern Territory]] are constructed using Solar Systems' CS500 concentrator dish systems. The project cost A$7M, offset by a grant from the Australian and Northern Territory Governments under their Renewable Remote Power Generation Program.&lt;ref name="solarsystems.com.au"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solarsystems.com.au/SPSA+case+study.pdf|title=Solar Systems - Solar Systems|website=www.solarsystems.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''spring pendulum''' (also called elastic pendulum or swinging spring) is a [[physical system]] where a piece of mass is connected to a [[Spring (device)|spring]] so that the resulting motion contains elements of a simple [[pendulum]] as well as a spring.  The system is much more complex than a simple pendulum, as the properties of the spring add an extra dimension of freedom to the system.  For example, when the spring compresses, the shorter radius causes the spring to move faster due to the conservation of [[angular momentum]].  It is also possible that the spring has a range that is overtaken by the motion of the pendulum, making it practically neutral to the motion of the pendulum.

The '''T Tauri wind''' &amp;mdash; so named because of the [[T Tauri|young star]] currently in this stage&amp;mdash;is a phenomenon indicative of the phase of stellar development between the accretion of material from the slowing rotating material of a [[solar nebula]] and the ignition of the hydrogen that has agglomerated into the [[protostar]].

The protostar at first only has about 1% of its final mass. But the envelope of the star continues to grow as infalling material is accreted. After 10,000–100,000 years,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~pogge/Ast162/Unit2/starform.html |title=Lecture 14: Star Formation |publisher=Astronomy.ohio-state.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; thermonuclear fusion begins in its core, then a strong stellar wind is produced which stops the infall of new mass. The protostar is now considered a young star since its mass is fixed, and its future evolution is now set.

==The evolutionary picture of low mass protostars==
{{list to prose|date=January 2018}}

Initially there is a random amount of interstellar gaseous matter, mainly [[hydrogen]], containing traces of dusts (ices, carbon, rocks).&lt;ref&gt;Heavier elements  are created in larger stars via their [[nucleosynthesis]]. The nuclear reactions release neutrons which accumulate and undergo [[beta minus decay]], to become larger atomic number elements such as [[iron]], [[cobalt]], and [[nickel]]. Eventually, after a star has exhausted all its hydrogen and ended its fusion cycle &amp;mdash;and the core is largely composed of iron&amp;mdash; elements up to [[lead]] and [[bismuth]] are created, just before the lack of available energy causes the outer layers to fall inwards until a supernova explosion ejects 90% of the star's mass.
Andrew Norton, the Open University of the UK, unpublished text book ''How the Universe Works'', p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[T Tauri stars]], with masses less than twice the mass of our Sun, are thought to follow this process:
# initially, the clouds which collapse are thought to be very slowly rotating&lt;ref&gt;the spin may only be important in the later stages of collapse&amp;mdash;initially it plays very little role in the formation process&amp;mdash;and to not have uniform density (the clouds start denser in their centers than near their edges). This latter condition leads to an inside-out collapse.&lt;/ref&gt;
# The dense cores collapse faster than the less dense outer regions of the cloud. This follows from the free-fall time ~ 1/√(''g''xdensity). The initial collapse of the core is quite fast; time ~ 1/√(6.7×10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt;×10&lt;sup&gt;−18&lt;/sup&gt; g/cm³) ~ 50,000–100,000 years or so. The lower density envelope takes longer to collapse accrete (collapse onto the protostar); time ~ millions of years or so. Roughly speaking, the Sun forms as shown here.
# The inside-out collapse leads to the formation of the forming star in the center of the cloud which then slowly builds up its mass by accreting the outer layers of the cloud.
# Another noteworthy aspect of this later stage of formation is that before the star actually gets hot enough to ignite nuclear fusion, an intense stellar wind is generated. Often because the cloud was slowly rotating, a disk of material forms around the star. The disk collimates the intense stellar wind into 2 oppositely directed beams producing what is referred to as a bipolar flow, which can cause the forming star to lose up to 0.4 mass of our Sun, and can start to disrupt the cloud.
#Even though it takes several millions of years for the cloud to accrete onto the protostar, because the protostars are relatively low mass, it takes even longer to slowly contract and approach starhood. For the most part, the cloud has a chance to accrete onto the protostar before the violent stages of evolution begin.

==The character of accretion and stellar wind parameters of T Tauri stars==
The main portion of emission continuum of ''Classic T Tauri Stars'' is formed outside the accretion shock, what means a great deal of accretion matter falls onto the star in nearly horizontal direction. This gas decelerate in turbulent layer near the star surface. 

We suggest two scenarios to explain such nature of accretion: two-stream accretion (through boundary layer and [[magnetosphere]]) and magnetospheric accretion by way of streams, the bulk of matter in which falls onto the star in nearly horizontal direction.

Observations have provided quantitative parameters of disk wind, derived from the analysis of optical and [[Ultraviolet|UV]] spectra of CTTS. The matter outflows observed from a disk region with an outer radius of &lt; 0.5 [[astronomical unit|AU]]. The outflowing matter initially moves almost along the disk until being accelerated up to ''V'' &gt; 100&amp;nbsp;km/s and only afterwards begins to collimate. Inner region of the wind is collimated into the jet at a distance &lt;3 AU from the disk mid plain. The ''V''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; gas velocity component in the jet decreases with increasing distance from the jet axis. The gas temperature in the jet bottom is less than 20,000 [[kelvin]]s.

[[Image:The Water Cycle - Following the Water.ogv|thumb|Precipitation falls on the ground, but what happens to that water depends greatly on the geography of the land at any particular place.]]

The '''water cycle''', also known as the '''hydrological cycle''' or the '''hydrologic cycle''', describes the continuous movement of [[water]] on, above and below the surface of the [[Earth]]. The mass of water on Earth remains fairly constant over time but the partitioning of the water into the major reservoirs of ice, [[fresh water]], saline water and [[Atmosphere|atmospheric water]] is variable depending on a wide range of [[climate change|climatic variables]]. The water moves from one reservoir to another, such as from river to [[ocean]], or from the ocean to the atmosphere, by the physical processes of [[evaporation]], [[condensation]], [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], [[Infiltration (hydrology)|infiltration]], [[surface runoff]], and subsurface flow. In doing so, the water goes through different forms: liquid, solid ([[ice]]) and [[Water vapor|vapor]].

The water cycle involves the exchange of energy, which leads to [[temperature]] changes. When water evaporates, it takes up energy from its surroundings and cools the environment. When it condenses, it releases energy and warms the environment. These heat exchanges influence [[climate]].

The evaporative phase of the cycle purifies water which then replenishes the land with freshwater. The flow of liquid water and ice transports minerals across the globe. It is also involved in reshaping the geological features of the Earth, through processes including [[erosion]] and [[sedimentation]]. The water cycle is also essential for the maintenance of most life and ecosystems on the planet.

== Description ==
The sun, which drives the water cycle, heats water in oceans and seas. Water evaporates as water vapor into the [[air]].  Some ice and snow [[Sublimation (chemistry)|sublimates]] directly into water vapor.  [[Evapotranspiration]] is water [[Transpiration|transpired]] from plants and evaporated from the soil.  The water molecule {{chem|H|2|O}} has smaller [[molecular mass]] than the major components of the atmosphere, nitrogen and oxygen, {{chem|N|2}} and {{chem|O|2}}, hence is less dense.  Due to the significant difference in density, [[buoyancy]] drives humid air higher.  As altitude increases, air pressure decreases and the temperature drops (see [[Gas laws]]).  The lower temperature causes water vapor to condense into tiny liquid water droplets which are heavier than the air, and fall unless supported by an updraft.  A huge concentration of these droplets over a large space up in the atmosphere become visible as [[cloud]].  Some condensation is near ground level, and called [[fog]].

[[Atmospheric circulation]] moves water vapor around the globe, cloud particles collide, grow, and fall out of the upper atmospheric layers as [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]].  Some precipitation falls as snow or hail, sleet, and can accumulate as [[ice cap]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s and [[glacier]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, which can store frozen water for thousands of years. Most water falls back into the oceans or onto land as rain, where the water flows over the ground as [[surface runoff]]. A portion of runoff enters rivers in valleys in the landscape, with streamflow moving water towards the oceans. Runoff and water emerging from the ground ([[groundwater]]) may be stored as freshwater in lakes. Not all runoff flows into rivers, much of it soaks into the ground as [[infiltration (hydrology)|infiltration]]. Some water infiltrates deep into the ground and replenishes [[aquifer]]s, which can store freshwater for long periods of time. Some infiltration stays close to the land surface and can seep back into surface-water bodies (and the ocean) as groundwater discharge. Some groundwater finds openings in the land surface and comes out as freshwater springs. In river valleys and floodplains, there is often continuous water exchange between surface water and ground water in the [[hyporheic zone]]. Over time, the water returns to the ocean, to continue the water cycle.

The ''[[Residence time (fluid dynamics)|residence time]]'' of a reservoir within the hydrologic cycle is the average time a water molecule will spend in that reservoir (''see adjacent table''). It is a measure of the average age of the water in that reservoir.

Groundwater can spend over 10,000 years beneath Earth's surface before leaving. Particularly old groundwater is called [[fossil water]]. Water stored in the soil remains there very briefly, because it is spread thinly across the Earth, and is readily lost by evaporation, transpiration, stream flow, or groundwater recharge. After evaporating, the residence time in the atmosphere is about 9 days before condensing and falling to the Earth as precipitation.

The major ice sheets – [[Antarctica]] and [[Greenland]] – store ice for very long periods. Ice from Antarctica has been reliably dated to 800,000 years before present, though the average residence time is shorter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jouzel|first=J.|last2=Masson-Delmotte|first2=V.|last3=Cattani|first3=O.|last4=Dreyfus|first4=G.|last5=Falourd|first5=S.|last6=Hoffmann|first6=G.|last7=Minster|first7=B.|last8=Nouet|first8=J.|last9=Barnola|first9=J.

In hydrology, residence times can be estimated in two ways. The more common method relies on the principle of [[conservation of mass]] and assumes the amount of water in a given reservoir is roughly constant. With this method, residence times are estimated by dividing the volume of the reservoir by the rate by which water either enters or exits the reservoir. Conceptually, this is equivalent to timing how long it would take the reservoir to become filled from empty if no water were to leave (or how long it would take the reservoir to empty from full if no water were to enter).

An alternative method to estimate residence times, which is gaining in popularity for dating groundwater, is the use of [[Isotope|isotopic]] techniques. This is done in the subfield of [[isotope hydrology]].

The water cycle describes the processes that drive the movement of water throughout the [[hydrosphere]]. However, much more water is "in storage" for long periods of time than is actually moving through the cycle. The storehouses for the vast majority of all water on Earth are the oceans. It is estimated that of the 332,500,000&amp;nbsp;mi&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (1,386,000,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) of the world's water supply, about 321,000,000&amp;nbsp;mi&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (1,338,000,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) is stored in oceans, or about 97%. It is also estimated that the oceans supply about 90% of the evaporated water that goes into the water cycle.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://water.usgs.gov/edu/watercyclesummary.html |title=The Water Cycle summary |website=USGS Water Science School |access-date=2018-01-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180116135448/https://water.usgs.gov/edu/watercyclesummary.html |archivedate=2018-01-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During colder climatic periods, more ice caps and glaciers form, and enough of the global water supply accumulates as ice to lessen the amounts in other parts of the water cycle. The reverse is true during warm periods. During the last ice age, glaciers covered almost one-third of Earth's land mass with the result being that the oceans were about 122&amp;nbsp;m (400&amp;nbsp;ft) lower than today. During the last global "warm spell," about 125,000 years ago, the seas were about 5.5&amp;nbsp;m (18&amp;nbsp;ft) higher than they are now. About three million years ago the oceans could have been up to 50&amp;nbsp;m (165&amp;nbsp;ft) higher.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The scientific consensus expressed in the 2007 [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) Summary for Policymakers is for the water cycle to continue to intensify throughout the 21st century, though this does not mean that precipitation will increase in all regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ipcc.ch:80/SPM2feb07.pdf |title=Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis |last=Alley |first=Richard |display-authors=etal |date=February 2007 |publisher=International Panel on Climate Change |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203164304/http://www.ipcc.ch/SPM2feb07.pdf |archive-date=February 3, 2007 |dead-url=yes |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In subtropical land areas{{snd}}places that are already relatively dry{{snd}}precipitation is projected to decrease during the 21st century, increasing the probability of [[drought]]. The drying is projected to be strongest near the poleward margins of the [[subtropics]] (for example, the Mediterranean Basin, South Africa, southern Australia, and the [[Southwestern United States]]). Annual precipitation amounts are expected to increase in near-equatorial regions that tend to be wet in the present climate, and also at high latitudes. These large-scale patterns are present in nearly all of the [[climate model]] simulations conducted at several international research centers as part of the 4th Assessment of the IPCC. There is now ample evidence that increased hydrologic variability and change in climate has and will continue to have a profound impact on the water sector through the hydrologic cycle, water availability, water demand, and water allocation at the global, regional, basin, and local levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Vahid |first=Alavian |first2=Halla Maher |last2=Qaddumi |first3=Eric |last3=Dickson |first4=Sylvia Michele |last4=Diez |first5=Alexander V. |last5=Danilenko |first6=Rafik Fatehali |last6=Hirji |first7=Gabrielle |last7=Puz |first8=Carolina |last8=Pizarro |first9=Michael |last9=Jacobsen |date=November 1, 2009 |title=Water and climate change : understanding the risks and making climate-smart investment decisions |pages=1–174 |url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/362051468328208633/Water-and-climate-change-understanding-the-risks-and-making-climate-smart-investment-decisions |location=Washington, DC |publisher=World Bank |via= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170706083254/http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/362051468328208633/Water-and-climate-change-understanding-the-risks-and-making-climate-smart-investment-decisions |archivedate=2017-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research published in 2012 in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' based on surface ocean salinity over the period 1950 to 2000 confirm this projection of an intensified global water cycle with salty areas becoming more saline and fresher areas becoming more fresh over the period:&lt;ref name="NYTIWC"/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Fundamental thermodynamics and climate models suggest that dry regions will become drier and wet regions will become wetter in response to warming.

Our 50-year observed global surface salinity changes, combined with changes from global climate models, present robust evidence of an intensified global water cycle at a rate of 8 ± 5% per degree of surface warming.

==History of hydrologic cycle theory==

===Floating land mass===
In ancient times, it was widely thought that the land mass floated on a body of water, and that most of the water in rivers has its origin under the earth.  Examples of this belief can be found in the works of [[Homer]] (circa 800 BCE).

=== Hebrew Bible ===
In the ancient near east, Hebrew scholars observed that even though the rivers ran into the sea, the sea never became full. Some scholars conclude that the water cycle was described completely during this time in this passage: "The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north; it whirleth about continually, and the wind returneth again according to its circuits. All the rivers run into the sea, yet the sea is not full; unto the place from whence the rivers come, thither they return again" (, KJV).&lt;ref name="Morris1988p.15"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Morris |first=Henry M. |year=1988|title=Science and the Bible |isbn= |edition=Trinity Broadcasting Network |location=Chicago, IL |publisher=Moody Press |page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars are not in agreement as to the date of Ecclesiastes, though most scholars point to a date during the time of [[King Solomon]], son of David and Bathsheba, "three thousand years ago,&lt;ref name="Morris1988p.15"/&gt; there is some agreement that the time period is 962–922 BCE.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; Furthermore, it was also observed that when the clouds were full, they emptied rain on the earth (). In addition, during 793–740 BCE a Hebrew prophet, Amos, stated that water comes from the sea and is poured out on the earth (, ).&lt;ref&gt;Merrill, Eugene H.; Rooker, Mark F.; Grisanti, Michael A.

In the Biblical [[Book of Job]], dated between 7th and 2nd centuries BCE,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Oxford Companion to the Bible |last=Metzger |first=Bruce M. |last2=Coogan |first2=Michael D. |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1993 |isbn=978-0195046458 |location=New York, NY |pages=369 }}&lt;/ref&gt; there is a description of precipitation in the hydrologic cycle,&lt;ref name="Morris1988p.15"/&gt; "For he maketh small the drops of water: they pour down rain according to the vapour thereof; Which the clouds do drop and distil upon man abundantly" (, KJV).

===Precipitation and percolation===
In the [[Adityahridayam]] (a devotional hymn to the Sun God) of [[Ramayana]], a Hindu epic dated to the 4th century BCE, it is mentioned in the 22nd verse that the Sun heats up water and sends it down as rain. By roughly 500 BCE, Greek scholars were speculating that much of the water in rivers can be attributed to rain. The origin of rain was also known by then. These scholars maintained the belief, however, that water rising up through the earth contributed a great deal to rivers.  Examples of this thinking included [[Anaximander]] (570 BCE) (who also speculated about the [[History of evolutionary thought|evolution of land animals from fish]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://palaeos.com/science/timeline/pre19C.html |title=Palaeos: History of Evolution and Paleontology in science, philosophy, religion, and popular culture : Pre 19th Century |first=M.Alan |last=Kazlev |publisher= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302123918/http://palaeos.com/science/timeline/pre19C.html |archivedate=2014-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and [[Xenophanes|Xenophanes of Colophon]] (530 BCE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=James H.

Both [[Plato]] (390 BCE) and [[Aristotle]] (350 BCE) speculated about percolation as part of the water cycle.

===Precipitation alone===

Up to the time of the Renaissance, it was thought that precipitation alone was insufficient to feed rivers, for a complete water cycle, and that underground water pushing upwards from the oceans were the main contributors to river water. [[Bartholomeus Anglicus|Bartholomew of England]] held this view (1240 CE), as did Leonardo da Vinci (1500 CE) and [[Athanasius Kircher]] (1644 CE).

The first published thinker to assert that rainfall alone was sufficient for the maintenance of rivers was [[Bernard Palissy]] (1580 CE), who is often credited as the "discoverer" of the modern theory of the water cycle. Palissy's theories were not tested scientifically until 1674, in a study commonly attributed to [[Pierre Perrault (scientist)|Pierre Perrault]]. Even then, these beliefs were not accepted in mainstream science until the early nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://hydrologie.org/ACT/OH2/actes/03_dooge.pdf |author=James C.I.
