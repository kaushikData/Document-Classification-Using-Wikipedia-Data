'''''13 Reloaded''''' is the fourth solo [[studio album]] by American rapper [[Havoc (musician)|Havoc]], one-half of the [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] duo [[Mobb Deep]]. The album was released on November 18, 2014 by Hclass Entertainment, Inc. The album features [[guest appearance]]s from [[Prodigy (rapper)|Prodigy]], [[Sheek Louch]], [[Cormega]], Ferg Brim and Mysonne. Album artwork by John Katehis.

== Background ==
The project serves as Havoc's fourth solo album, and the 1/2 of Mobb Deep tells us the focus for this album isn't the rapping, but rather, the production. "Not many guest appearances, it's all about the production. It's an album for the fans of Havoc's sound," he says.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7223">A {{nihongo|'''2.5 dimensional musical'''|2.5次元ミュージカル|2.5 jigen myujikaru}} (abbrievated into '''2.5D musical'''), also known as an '''anime musical''', is a type of modern Japanese [[Theatre of Japan|theatre production]] based exclusively on popular Japanese anime, manga, or video games. The term "2.5D musical" was coined to describe stories presented in two-dimensional medium being brought to real life.&lt;ref name="japantimes1"&gt;{{cite news | author=Nobuko Tanaka | url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/culture/2015/03/31/stage/tenimyu-2-5-d-shows-net-2-million-tickets-sold/#.W3C9LsInbIU | title=‘Tenimyu’ 2.5-D shows net over 2 million tickets sold | work=[[The Japan Times]] | date=2015-03-31 | accessdate=2018-08-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately 70 2.5D musicals were produced in 2013 and attracted at least 1.6 million people, most of them young women in their teens and 20s. 2.5D musicals are often seen as the starting point of many young actors in Japan.&lt;ref name="japanbullet1"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.japanbullet.com/news/2-5-d-musicals-based-on-manga-and-anime-popular-with-young-women | title=‘2.5 - D’ Musicals, Based On Manga And Anime, Popular With Young Women | work=Japan Bullet | date=2015-08-13 | accessdate=2018-08-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==

2.5D musicals are defined through make-up and costuming that accurately depicts the actor as the original character, along with exaggerated acting that mimics the original expressions in the original work. It also include special effects and stunts that reenact the setting and tone of the original work. Directors of the musicals are usually the ones who write the lyrics to the songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.themagicrain.com/2018/02/interview-with-japanese-music-industry-experts-comic-fiesta-2017/ | title=Interview with Japanese Music Industry Experts – Comic Fiesta 2017 | work=The Magic Rain | date=2018-02-05 | accessdate=2018-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the evolution of technology, some of the modern 2.5D musicals uses [[projection mapping]], in which backgrounds and special effects are projected onto the stage and screens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://spice.eplus.jp/articles/96302 | title=藤原祐規×演出家・キムラ真インタビュー！　舞台『PERSONA3 the Weird Masquerade』完結作を語る | work=Spice | language=Japanese | date=2017-01-28 | accessdate=2018-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Japan 2.5-Dimensional Musical Association, the term not only applies to musicals, but also plays, comedies, and dramas.&lt;ref name="webjapan1"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://web-japan.org/trends/11_culture/pop171214.html | title=“2.5 Dimensional Musical” Live Theater | work=Web Japan | accessdate=2018-08-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The first successful manga-based musical production was ''[[The Rose of Versailles]]'' in 1974 by the [[Takarazuka Revue]].&lt;ref name="japanbullet1"/&gt; At the time, these plays were simply known as "musicals" or "anime musicals."&lt;ref name="interview1"&gt;{{cite web | author=Norio Kohyama | url=http://performingarts.jp/E/pre_interview/1511/1.html | title=Presenter Interview: The vision of Makoto Matsuda, the producer behind the "2.5-D Musicals" | work=Performing Arts Network Japan | accessdate=2018-08-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the 1990s, a number of musicals and small stage skits produced were based on anime and manga series aimed at elementary school girls, such as ''[[Sailor Moon musicals|Sailor Moon]]'', ''[[Akazukin Chacha]]'', and ''[[Hime-chan's Ribbon]]'', which performed moderately well, but were not popular and were known as {{nihongo|"musicals for elementary school girls"|女児物|joji mono}}.&lt;ref name="interview1"/&gt; However, in 2000, ''[[Hunter x Hunter]]'' became revolutionary at the time because the voice cast for the original anime series had also played the characters on stage.&lt;ref name="interview1"/&gt;

Japanese media-based musicals rose to popularity in 2003 with ''[[Tenimyu|Musical: The Prince of Tennis]]'' through word-of-mouth and social media, which soon became a starting point for many up-and-coming actors. The shows attracted more than 2 million people during its run and was notable for using stage effects to simulate a tennis match,&lt;ref name="japantimes1"/&gt; and it was popular enough to include its first overseas shows in South Korea and Taiwan in 2008.&lt;ref name="interview1"/&gt; After its success, many productions based on anime, manga, and video games soon followed, some of the well-documented ones including ''[[Naruto]]'', ''[[Yowamushi Pedal]]'', ''[[Haikyu!!|Hyper Projection Engeki Haikyu!!]]'' among others. Unlike productions featuring the Takarazuka Revue, which are supported by fans of the troupe, these musicals mainly draw anime and manga fans and other audiences that usually do not see plays on a regular basis.&lt;ref name="japanbullet1"/&gt;

The term "2.5D musicals" was codified in 2014 when the initial director of ''[[Tenimyu|Musical: The Prince of Tennis]]'', Makoto Matsuda, first established the Japan 2.5-Dimensional Musical Association. At first, despite the success of ''[[Tenimyu|Musical: The Prince of Tennis]]'', he did not consider it a formal stage production on par with most modern theater performances imported from Western works such as [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] productions.&lt;ref name="interview1"/&gt; However, after a group of South Korean musical professionals had acknowledged ''[[Black Butler]]'''s production value and standards in performing arts, Matsuda decided to bring the genre worldwide. Plays certified by the Japan 2.5-Dimensional Musical Association offer theater glasses that contain subtitles in Chinese and English for people who do not speak Japanese.&lt;ref name="webjapan1"/&gt; Starting in 2014, many 2.5D musicals have also been performed abroad in places like China, Taiwan, the United States, and parts of Europe.

In 2018, "2.5D Musical Studies" was added as a program at the Tokyo School of Anime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Jennifer Sherman | url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2017-02-27/anime-focused-2.5d-musical-school-opens-in-tokyo-in-2018/.112521 | title=Anime-Focused 2.5D Musical School Opens in Tokyo in 2018 | work=[[Anime News Network]] | date=2017-02-27 | accessdate=2018-08-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2018, actor [[Kenta Suga]], who has starred as Gaara in ''[[Naruto]]'' and Hinata in ''[[Haikyu!!|Hyper Projection Engeki Haikyu!!]]'' became appointed as the overseas ambassador by the Japan 2.5-Dimensional Musical Association, succeeding [[Ryo Kato]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://enterstage.jp/news/2018/04/009321.html | title=須賀健太「2.5Dアンバサダー」就任！白衣姿で2.5次元ミュージカルの魅力を伝える | work=Enterstage | language=Japanese |date=2018-04-18 | accessdate=2018-08-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''21st Century Museum of Contemporary Art, Kanazawa''' is a [[museum]] of [[contemporary art]]  located in [[Kanazawa, Ishikawa|Kanazawa]], [[Ishikawa Prefecture|Ishikawa]],  [[Japan]]. 

The museum was designed by Japanese architects [[Kazuyo Sejima]] and [[Ryue Nishizawa]] of the architectural office [[SANAA]] in 2004. In October 2005, one year after its opening the Museum marked 1,570,000 visitors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kanazawa21.jp/data_list.php?g=50&amp;d=1&amp;lng=e 21st Century Museum of Contemporary Art: History], retrieved 31 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==The building==
{{double image|right|Swimming Pool from above, 21st Century Museum of Contemporary Art.jpg|160|Inside the Swimming Pool, 21st Century Museum of Contemporary Art.jpg|160|[[Leandro Erlich]]'s "The Swimming Pool" from above and below}}
The Museum is located in the center of Kanazawa, near [[Kenroku-en]] garden and the [[Ishikawa Prefectural Museum of Art]]. The building has a circular form, with a diameter of 112.5 metres. This shape aims to keep the appearance of the overall building volume low, to mitigate the scale of the project and allows access from multiple points of entry. The transparency of the building further manifests the wish to avoid the museum being perceived as a large, introverted mass.&lt;ref name="ArchConcept"&gt;[http://www.kanazawa21.jp/data_list.php?g=35&amp;d=1&amp;lng=e 21st Century Museum of Contemporary Art: Architectural Concept], retrieved 31 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The building includes community gathering spaces, such as a library, lecture hall, and children’s workshop, located on the periphery, and museum spaces in the middle. The exhibition areas comprise numerous galleries with multiple options for division, expansion, or concentration. The galleries are of various proportions and light conditions – from bright daylight through glass ceilings to spaces with no natural light source, their height ranging from 4 to 12 metres. The circulation spaces are designed to make them usable as additional exhibition areas. Four fully glazed internal courtyards, each unique in character, provide ample daylight to the center of the building and a fluent border between community spaces and museum spaces.&lt;ref name="ArchConcept"/&gt;

'''''The 6th Marine Division on Okinawa''''' is a 1945 [[Kodachrome]] color [[documentary film]] produced about the action of the [[6th Marine Division (United States)|6th Division]] during the [[Battle of Okinawa]]. The film was released shortly after the event.

The film begins by outlining the strategic and psychological importance of [[Okinawa]], including its use as a supply base for Japanese forces in [[British Malaya|Malaya]], the [[Marianas]] and the [[Philippines]], as well as a "choke hold" over China. It also informs the audience that Okinawa is an actual part of the Japanese homeland, only a few hundred miles south of [[Kyushu]].

The movements of the units and their order of battle is carefully traced, from the landings on April 1 to the assault on [[Naha]]. Some interesting footage is also shown on life in northern Okinawa soon after liberation, with the locals setting up a democratic government under the US military and opening up schools while battle is raging in the south.

Some of the footage includes the use of [[flame-throwing tank]]s and close air support in an attempt to dislodge heavily dug-in Japanese defenders.  The film ends with a eulogy for all those who died attempting to secure the island, as Marines visit a gigantic graveyard prior to departing for their next objective.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5566">'''Abandoned pets''' are [[companion animal]]s that are either inadvertently or deliberately cast off by their owners. This commonly occurs when an owner [[death|dies]], when a pet becomes disruptive or grows too large, or if the pet was acquired impulsively. The [[financial crisis of 2007–2010]] has resulted in a number of pets abandoned for economic reasons. Typical of this group are pets left behind when the owner's home is foreclosed. These animals can be left alone on the property or dropped off at an [[animal shelter]]. They are often discovered after the foreclosure process, when the realtor or bank enters the home. Animals lucky enough to survive until they are discovered are often in poor condition due to lack of resources such as food and water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document | title=Animal welfare crisis unfolds in Germany as refuges deluged |author=Richard Rogers |publisher=The Observer |date=30 August 2009 | postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abandonment==
Pets are abandoned for a variety of reasons. Often, when abandoned, pets are forced to fend for themselves, and become feral. In particular, cats and dogs go to colonies. [[Feral cat]]s are said to outnumber feral dogs. Feral cats are difficult to deal with, as often they become impossible to socialize enough to be re-introduced to a new human owner. In general, only some newly abandoned cats and very young feral kittens can be tamed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Seidman|first=Susan M.|title=The pet surplus: what every dog and cat owner can do to help reduce it|page=21|isbn=978-0-7388-5831-9|year=2001|publisher=S. M. Seidman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many states in the United States, it is illegal to abandon a pet. In [[Iowa]], doing so is a [[misdemeanor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ta |first=Linh |date=15 August 2018 |title='It's heart-wrenching': Unwanted dogs left on their own in Iowa forest |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2018/08/15/57-unwanted-dogs-dumped-iowa-forest/995933002/ |work=USA Today |agency=De Moines Register |access-date=15 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreclosure pets===
Currently the exact number of foreclosed pets is unknown. People often drop animals off at a [[Animal shelter|shelter]] and claim they are moving, when in fact they are leaving due to foreclosure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Peters | first = Sharon L.  | title = Foreclosures slam doors on pets, too | pages = 1 | newspaper = USATODAY | location = California | date = 9 July 2008 | url = https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/environment/2008-03-24-foreclosures-pets_N.htm | accessdate = 6 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the number of foreclosure pets is believed to had increased due to high foreclosure rates. As homeowners run out of time and options, they often leave their animals behind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Nieves | first = Evelyn | title = Foreclosures Lead to| pages = 1 | newspaper = FOXNEWS | location = California | date = 29 January 2008 | url = http://www.foxnews.com/wires/2008Jan29/0,4670,ForeclosurePets,00.html | accessdate = 6 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The animals are then classified as abandoned foreclosure pets.

The pets left behind in homes are often left without food or water. Some do not survive because of the lack of resources and are found dead when realtors or banks enter the premises. The animals are put in harm's way, and it is often believed it is done as a way to retaliate against those who took the home away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Sullivan | first = Carole | title = Foreclosures Lead to Rise in Abandoned Pets in Cleveland | pages = 1 | newspaper = WKYC | location = Cleveland | date = 25 October 2007 | url = http://www.wkyc.com/news/news_links/links_article.aspx?storyid=76702 | accessdate = 6 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shelters==
Many animals left at a shelter are [[animal euthanasia|euthanized]] due to lack of space and financial resources for these animals. Shelters unable to raise additional funds to provide for the increased number of incoming animals have no choice but to euthanize them, sometimes within days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lewis|first=Laura Dawn|title=Laid Off, Now What?!?

'''''Angry Birds Seasons''''' is the second [[puzzle video game]] in the ''[[Angry Birds]]'' series, developed by [[Rovio Mobile]]. Based on ''[[Angry Birds (video game)|Angry Birds]]'', ''Angry Birds Seasons'' was released for devices using Apple's [[iOS]] in October 2010 and then it was released on other platforms starting in December 2010.  There have been no new releases since 2016 and it appears that Rovio has discontinued development of the game.

==Gameplay==
Just as in the original ''Angry Birds'', players use a [[slingshot]] to launch an assortment of birds at nearby structures, with the intent of hitting targets located on or within them. The main targets are the pigs, and they can be defeated if directly fired at, or through other strategies, e.g.: the bird hits a structure that falls on the pig, defeating it. Small sized pigs are weak and easily defeated, while bigger pigs can sustain more damage. Each level pack represents a different "season", often based upon different themes and holidays. Different level packs have each unique theme and sometimes much different gameplay.

==Release==
===2010===
'''''Season 2010''''' started in October 2010, when Rovio released a [[Halloween]] edition.&lt;ref name="Joystiq"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2010/10/20/angry-birds-halloween-edition-spooks-ipad-iphone/|title=Angry Birds Halloween edition spooks iPad, iPhone|author=Richard Mitchell|work=Joystiq.com|date=October 21, 2010|accessdate=October 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Angry Birds Halloween'', exclusive to iOS at the time and a separate game, included levels with Halloween-themed music and graphics.&lt;ref name="Joystiq"/&gt; In December 2010, Rovio released ''Angry Birds Seasons'' to iOS, Android and Symbian 3 devices.&lt;ref name="TNW"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thenextweb.com/apps/2010/12/01/angry-birds-seasons-goes-live-and-free-for-ios-and-android/|title=Angry Birds Seasons goes live and free for iOS and Android|author=Jeff Cormier|work=The Next Web|date=December 1, 2010|accessdate=December 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AAS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allaboutsymbian.com/reviews/item/12402_Angry_Birds_Seasons.php|title=Review: Angry Birds Seasons|author=Ewan Spence|work=AllAboutSymbian.com|date=December 17, 2010|accessdate=December 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Seasons'' introduced 25 Christmas-themed levels, one for each day leading to the holiday, similar to an [[Advent calendar]].&lt;ref name="TNW"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AAS"/&gt; All versions include the previously-exclusive Halloween levels and are offered as separate, stand-alone paid applications, with the exception of the free, ad-supported Android version;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://downloadsquad.switched.com/2010/12/01/angry-birds-seasons-is-holiday-themed-out-for-android-and-ios-t/|title=Angry Birds Seasons out for Android and iOS today, free to Halloween users|author=Vlad Bobleanta|work=switched.com|date=December 1, 2010|accessdate=December 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Angry Birds Halloween'' users on iOS received the ''Seasons'' levels as a free upgrade.&lt;ref name="TNW"/&gt; The Halloween version was given the episode title "Trick or Treat", while the Christmas episode was entitled "Season's Greedings".
===2011===
'''''Season 2011''''' began in February 2011, when Rovio released a [[Valentine's Day]] update to ''Angry Birds Seasons'', entitled "Hogs and Kisses", complete with new themed levels and graphics, as well as the option to send ''Angry Birds''-themed Valentine's Day messages through Facebook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2011/02/07/angry-birds-valentines-day/|title=Angry Birds Gets Facebook-Infused Valentine's Day Edition|author=Christina Warren|work=Mashable.com|date=February 7, 2011|accessdate=February 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2011, Rovio released a new [[St. Patrick's Day]] update, entitled "Go Green, Get Lucky",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.angrybirdsnest.com/2011/03/angry-birds-seasons-go-green-get-lucky-update-is-here/|title=Angry Birds Seasons Go Green, Get Lucky Update is Here!|date=March 9, 2011|accessdate=March 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by an Easter update, entitled "Easter Eggs", in April 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2383717,00.asp|title=Angry Birds Seasons Gets Easter Update|author=Chloe Albanesius|work=PCMag.com|date=April 18, 2011|accessdate=April 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a summer update, "Summer Pignic", in June 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/iPhone/Angry+Birds+Seasons/news.asp?c=30902|title=Angry Birds Seasons Summer Pignic update hits the App Store, adds 30 levels|author=Rob Hearn|work=PocketGamer.co.uk|date=June 22, 2011|accessdate=June 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2011, "Mooncake Festival" was released in conjunction with the Chinese [[Mid-Autumn Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://wireless.ign.com/articles/119/1192115p1.html Angry Birds Seasons Moon Festival Episode Released], IGN, 1 September 2011.

Accessed on 21 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2011, "Wreck the Halls" was released with 25 [[Christmas]]-theme levels also arranged in an [[Advent calendar]] setting.

===2012===
'''''Season 2012''''' started in January 2012, when "Year of the Dragon" was released; it is about [[Chinese New Year]]. It features the replacement of the Mighty Eagle, the Mighty Dragon, that loops out the structures and defeats all the pigs; it is free to use. A Japanese Cherry Blossom season was announced on February 28, 2012, with a release date on March 7, 2012. In June 2012, Angry Birds Seasons added their twelfth season, Piglantis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.androidauthority.com/angry-birds-seasons-piglantis-update-95509/|title=Angry Birds Piglantis|publisher=David Nelson |date=2012-06-14 |accessdate=2012-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was launched on June 14 and is the second summer based episode (the first episode being Summer Pignic). The main new feature in Angry Birds: Piglantis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.angrybirdspiglantis.com |title=Angry Birds Piglantis Update |publisher=David Nelson |date=2012-06-14 |accessdate=2012-06-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120618010044/http://www.angrybirdspiglantis.com/ |archivedate=2012-06-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is fluid physics: the birds, wood, and glass are buoyant in the water levels; however, the pigs and stone are too heavy to rise to the surface and sink down until they are defeated.  In August 2012, "Back to School" was added, which introduces the pink bird, [[Angry Birds Stella|Stella]]. In October 2012 when Haunted Hogs was released and was the 3rd Halloween episode in the series. It added ghost blocks, which is visible to all items except the birds and the pigs unless they are inside them. On December 1, Winter Wonderham was released and was the 3rd Christmas episode in the series. Like the other Christmas episodes, it is set up as an advent calendar. It introduced slippery blue ice, that makes wood, ice, stone, birds and pigs slip on contact.

===2013===
'''''Season 2013''''' began in May 2013, when Abra-Ca-Bacon based on World Circus Day was released; it has a magician theme and features magic portals, which can teleport materials, birds, or pigs from one portal to another. In December 2013 Arctic Eggspedition was released, the 4th Christmas episode, and it is once again set up as an advent calendar with one level unlocked per day or all unlocked with an in-app purchase. ''Season 3'' or ''Season 2013'' is the shortest episode in ''Seasons'', with just two episodes.

===2014===
'''''Season 2014''''' began in July 2014 with South Hamerica and Pig Days, an episode that has weekly unlocked levels. With this update, the seasons were renamed showing the release year, such as "Season 2011". On October 9, 2014, the game has been updated with "Ham Dunk", in celebration of the NBA Championships. On October 27, 2014, the ''Visit Finland'' [[Twitter account]] unveiled an image displaying Terrance swimming on a pool along a similar looking bird, colored blue, named "Tony the Blue", and the title "On Finn Ice", which is the 5th Christmas episode. The tweet also referred to the Finnish band [[Apocalyptica]], who play the theme music for that episode.  With this update, the episodes were arranged to the year they were released, not as it was previously; the "Winter Wonderham" episode, which was in ''Seasons 2013'', was moved to ''Seasons 2012'', as the episode was released in 2012.
===2015===
'''''Season 2015''''' rang in February 2015, a 2nd part was added to Ham Dunk- "All-Star Weekend 2015", expanding the world to 60 levels (more than Trick or Treat, which has 45)- this update allowed the player to use Shockwave (electrical Bomb) for free, but only in Ham Dunk and for a limited time. At the extreme end of April (the 30th), a tropical world set on an unspecified Pacific island. The world was added in commemoration to Rovio's partnership with [[BirdLife International]] to save the birds of the Pacific. About a month later (June), a 3rd Ham Dunk update, celebrating The Finals,  was added- ultimately expanding the total levels of Ham Dunk to 67. Between this update and the next was about 4 months, giving Rovio a "rest" and letting them handle other Angry Birds games. Finally, in October 2015, a 50's movie-themed world was added to the selection, titled "Invasion of the Egg Snatchers", which not only brought a new world, but BirdWear ([[costumes]]), which are unlocked in a [[scavenger hunt]] style, having the player search through levels they completed for certain items, and once 3 items were found (there is a 16-hour wait between obtaining items and an 8-hour wait to get a new mission), they would receive the costume, allowing the birds to (optionally) wear outfits during gameplay. Another new feature in the update was the Power-Up Test Zone, which lets the player test Power-Ups (with infinite uses). Finally, to wrap up 2015, "[[Ski]] or Squeal" was added (in the usual [[advent calendar]] style), taking place a top a frigid mountain [[summit]].

===2016===
'''''Season 2016''''' (final season) began on February 11, 2016 (2 months after the Angry Birds 6th birthday), a [[Valentine's Day]] episode was released, entitled "Fairy Hogmother", which is set in a [[fairytale]] storybook, featuring magic wands that trigger actions when hit, and (strangely) imprisoned Birds that give the player an extra Bird when the cage (holding the Bird) is destroyed. As [[Spring (season)|spring]] rolled around about a month later, a new episode was released, called "Marie Hamtionette" (after [[Marie Antoinette]], queen of France in the 1700s), which is set in the garden of Ludpig XVI's ([[Louis XVI]]) estate, complete with [[hedge]]s and [[topiary]]s across a wide landscape. On June 27, 2016, summer 2016 kicked off with a new summer-themed world entitled "Summer Camp", which is (hence the name) a [[summer camp]] set in a mountainous forest at dawn, including many popular activities one would find at a camp, including [[human swimming]], [[archery]], [[rock climbing]], and many more popular summer activities. The summer 2016 update also added a new mode to the course of gameplay, "The Pig Challenge", which is set in a [[tournament]] style format, having players compete against friends and other players in a randomized set of weekly levels for trophies and power-ups. Fall 2016 started with "Piggywood Studios" where the Pigs reenact famous movie scenes from ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark|Indiana Jones]]'', ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'', ''[[The Angry Birds Movie]]'', ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'', ''[[Back to the Future]]'' and more. It continued with the Halloween episode "Hammier Things", which was based on TV series ''[[Stranger Things (TV series)|Stranger Things]]'', and concluded with the Christmas episode "Ragnahog", which is set in a Nordic theme.

==Ports==
At the 2012 [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]] in [[Los Angeles, California]], Rovio and distribution partner [[Activision]] announced plans to bring ''Angry Birds Seasons'', along with the original ''Angry Birds'' and ''Angry Birds Rio'', to the [[PlayStation 3]], [[Xbox 360]] and [[Nintendo 3DS]] systems.&lt;ref name="3PS360"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/07/10/angry-birds-trilogy-coming-to-ps3-360-and-3ds|title=Angry Birds Trilogy Coming to PS3, 360 and 3DS|author=Greg Miller|work=ign.com|publisher=IGN Entertainment, Inc.|date=2012-07-10|accessdate=2012-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bundled together as ''[[Angry Birds Trilogy]]'', the games will be built specifically for their respective consoles, taking advantage of their unique features, such as support for [[PlayStation Move]], [[Kinect]], high-definition displays and glasses-free [[Stereoscopy|3D visuals]].&lt;ref name="3PS360"/&gt;

It is also available for [[Wii]] and [[Wii U]] as part of ''[[Angry Birds Trilogy]]''.

==Reception==

}}

The reception of ''Angry Birds Seasons'' has been positive. Tracy Erickson of ''[[Pocket Gamer]]'' said about the [[Halloween]] update, "The difficulty is steeper than in the original ''[[Angry Birds]]'', which is likely an intentional consideration for those well-versed in the first game. This doesn't make ''Angry Birds Halloween'' unapproachable, but it does result in an undesirable increase in trial-and-error gameplay. Without the experience of playing the original, you can anticipate having to replay a lot of stages." He further mentioned, "Of course, these structural issues don't detract from what remains an entertaining game. ''Angry Birds Halloween'' is pleasantly more of the same, though you're best served by playing the original before tackling this holiday treat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Erickson|first=Tracy|title=Angry Birds Halloween|url=http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/Multiformat/Angry+Birds+Seasons/review.asp?c=24498|work=pocketgamer.co.uk|publisher=Steel Media Limited|accessdate=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;" Sarah Jacobsson of ''[[Macworld]]'' said about the [[Christmas]] update, "Unlike the original ''Angry Birds'' and ''Angry Birds Halloween'', the Season’s Greetings track does not start out with a laughably easy level—after all, you only get one level a day, and Rovio wants to make you work for it." She further wrote, "''Angry Birds Seasons'' brings fun, Christmas spirit to the most popular [[iOS]] game of the year. With the included Halloween track, you get a total of 69 challenging levels—definitely worth $0.99 (''Angry Birds Seasons HD'' is $1.99).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Angry Birds Seasons|url=http://www.macworld.com/product/710811/angry-birds-seasons.html|work=macworld.com|publisher=IDG Consumer &amp; SMB|accessdate=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;" Abigail Holden of ''Lazygamer'' rated the game 8.5/10, saying, "Whether you’re new to ''Angry Birds'' or you've enjoyed the game on other platforms, ''Angry Birds Seasons'' for [[Personal computer|PC]] is worth to look at.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Angry Birds Seasons review – Green Pigs and Ham?|url=http://www.lazygamer.net/review/angry-birds-seasons-review-green-pigs-and-ham/|work=lazygamer.net|publisher=Lazygamer|accessdate=1 February 2014|date=March 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Arab Press Network''' ('''APN''') ({{lang-fr|Place Réseau right la Presse Arabe}}) is a network of organisations that support and  promote the development of the press in the [[Arab world]]. It is run by the World Association of Newspapers, with its  headquarters in [[Paris]], and is supported by the Danish newspaper group JP/Politiken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arabpressnetwork.org/aboutv2.php?lang%3Dfr |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-08-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601020235/http://www.arabpressnetwork.org/aboutv2.php?lang=fr |archivedate=2012-06-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to APN, their mission is to facilitate  associations between Arab journalists and editors in order to promote  a free press. On a commercial level, the network supports newspapers to grow  and expand  through practical advice.

The APN website contains news about the Arab world and on developments therein relating to freedom of the press.

In 1968 he co-founded '''Seven Sons Comic Shop''' with five friends, John Barrett, Jim Buser, Mike Nolan, Frank Scadina, and Tom Tallmon, in San Jose. Selling Seven Sons within a year, Plant and three partners then opened another San Jose-based comics shop called '''Comic World'''.&lt;ref name=Toucan&gt;[http://www.comic-con.org/toucan/bud-plant-comics-retailing-pioneer "THE TOUCAN INTERVIEW: Bud Plant: Comics Retailing Pioneer,"] ''Toucan'': The Official Comic-Con &amp; Wondercon Blog (June 28, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970 Plant founded '''Bud Plant, Inc.''' as a mail order company specializing in [[underground comix]]. (His Holly Drive address appears as the publishing address of the first issue of ''Promethean Enterprises'' in 1969.) In 1971, Plant and five friends spent the summer dealing comics at conventions in Houston, [[Comic Art Convention|New York]], Dallas, [[San Diego Comic-Con International|San Diego]], Miami, Boston, and Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name=WashPost&gt;Jacobson, Aileen. "Serious Comics Fans", ''[[The Washington Post]]'' (Aug 16, 1971), p. B2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Plant had met direct market pioneer [[Phil Seuling]] on the convention circuit;&lt;ref name=WashPost /&gt; in late 1973 Seuling called Plant to inform him that he had just cut a deal to ship [[Archie Comics|Archie]], [[DC Comics|DC]], [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]], and [[Warren Publishing|Warren]] comic books from a new distribution center in [[Sparta, Illinois]]. Seuling offered the West Coast region to Plant, but Plant turned him down, preferring then to concentrate on the proliferating underground comix market.&lt;ref name="Beerbohm" /&gt;

=== Publishing ===
Plant entered the publishing field in 1969 as one of the three publishers, along with Al Davoren and Jim Vadeboncoeur, Jr., of ''[[Promethean Enterprises]]'' — a [[fanzine]] that attempted to straddle the comic/comix boundary. (''Promethean Enterprises'' lasted from 1969–1974.) In 1972, Plant took over the publishing responsibilities of the fanzine ''[[Jan Strnad|Anomaly]]'' from [[Jan Strnad]] who had published three issues since 1969. Plant published issue #4 of ''Anomaly'', evolving it into an underground comic.

As part of his retailing enterprise Comics &amp; Comix ([[#Comics &amp; Comix|see below]]), in 1974 Plant co-published one issue of the underground/[[sword and sorcery]] hybrid ''Barbarian Killer Funnies''; moving from there to the similarly themed ''[[The First Kingdom]]'', written and illustrated by [[Jack Katz (artist)|Jack Katz]]. (Under various publishing names, Plant published 24 issues of ''The First Kingdom'', from 1974 to 1986.) Comics &amp; Comix also published three issues of Jim Pinkoski's ''Spaced'' in 1974–1976; two issues of ''[[Dan O'Neill|Dan O'Neill's Comics and Stories]]'' in 1975; and two issues of [[Alfredo Alcala]]'s ''Magic Carpet'' in 1977–1978.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comics.org/publisher/2900/ Comics &amp; Comix entry], Grand Comics Database. Accessed Oct. 8, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1978, Plant was approached by [[Wendy Pini|Wendy]] &amp; [[Richard Pini]] about publishing ''[[Elfquest]]'', but he turned the couple down, as he was getting out the comics publishing business.&lt;ref name=Toucan /&gt; (The Pinis went on to much success as self-publishers.)

From 1980 to 1985, Comics &amp; Comix also published the industry trade journal ''[[Telegraph Wire]]''.

{{main article|Comics and Comix}}
In August 1972, while still an undergraduate at [[San Jose State University]],&lt;ref name=Memories2&gt;Beerbohm, Robert. [http://www.comicconmemories.com/2010/01/06/comics-dealer-extraordinaire-robert-beerbohm-in-his-own-words/ "Comics Dealer Extraordinaire Robert Beerbohm: In His Own Words"], Comic-Convention Memories (Jan. 6, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; Plant co-founded what became the comics retailer [[Comics &amp; Comix]] in [[Berkeley, California]], with  [[John Barrett (comics)|John Barrett]]&lt;ref&gt;Nolan, Michelle. "Newswatch: Pioneering Comics Retailer John Barrett Dies at 50", ''The Comics Journal'' #233 (May 2001), p. 18: Barrett died March 14, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; and Plant's housemate [[Robert Beerbohm]].&lt;ref name="Beerbohm"&gt;Beerbohm, Bob. [http://www.comicsreporter.com/index.php/please_consider_buying_some_comics_from_robert_beerbohm/ "Please Consider Buying Some Comics From Industry Icon Robert Beerbohm"], The Comics Reporter (March 14, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973 Comics &amp; Comix helped host the first Bay Area [[comics convention]], '''Berkeleycon 73''', in the Pauley Ballroom in the ASUC Building on the [[University of California, Berkeley]] campus. At that show, Comics &amp; Comix acquired over 4,000 [[Golden Age of comic books|Golden Age]] comic books owned by Tom Reilly.&lt;ref name="Beerbohm" /&gt; The phenomenal sales of the Reilly collection enabled Comics &amp; Comix to open more retail locations, first in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] (May 1973), on Columbus Avenue (down from the [[North Beach, San Francisco|North Beach]] area on the way to [[Fisherman's Wharf, San Francisco|Fisherman's Wharf]]), and later in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] and [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]], making it the first comic book chain store in America.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

=== Expansion ===
In the early 1980s Plant supplied product to [[Destiny Distributors]], a sub-distributor based in Seattle and Vancouver, started by [[Phil Pankow]] (which was acquired by Diamond in 1990).&lt;ref&gt;"Newswatch: Independent Meets Its Destiny", ''The Comics Journal'' #139 (December 1990), pp. 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982, Plant bought out regional rival [[Charles Abar Distribution]], based in [[Belmont, California]].&lt;ref name="DuinPlant"&gt;Duin, Steve and [[Mike Richardson (publisher)|Richardson, Mike]] (eds.) "Bud Plant" in ''Comics Between the Panels'' ([[Dark Horse Comics|Dark Horse Publishing]], 1998) {{ISBN|1-56971-344-8}}, p. 356–357.&lt;/ref&gt;

The year 1985 brought two important developments in the distribution industry, the bankruptcy of Seuling's [[Sea Gate Distributors]] (Seuling himself had died in 1984),&lt;ref&gt;"Phil Seuling, father of the direct-sales Market, dies at age of 50", ''The Comics Journal'' #93 (September 1984), pp. 13-14.&lt;/ref&gt; and the failure of Plant's West Coast rival [[Pacific Comics]] (which by that point was also a large independent comics publisher).&lt;ref&gt;"Newswatch: Pacific Comics liquidated", ''The Comics Journal'' #95 (February 1985), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Plant and Midwestern distributor [[Capital City Distributors]] opened "an expanded facility in Seagate's old space in Sparta, Illinois, alongside [Pacific's old] printing plant".&lt;ref name="Sanford"&gt;Sanford, Jay Allen. [http://www.sandiegoreader.com/news/2004/aug/19/two-men-and-their-comic-books/ "Two Men and their Comic Books]", ''[[San Diego Reader]]'' blog (Aug. 19, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, Plant acquired [[Alternate Realities Distributing, Inc.]], based in [[Denver, Colorado]], a wholesale distribution operation run by [[Chuck Rozanski|Nanette Rozanski]].&lt;ref&gt;Rozanski, Chuck. [http://www.milehighcomics.com/tales/cbg111.html "Returning to the Topic of My 1979 Visit to the Marvel Offices"], Tales From the Database, MileHighComics.com (March 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1988, Plant dominated distribution of comics in the West Coast, finally fulfilling Seuling's 1974 vision.

=== Sale to Diamond ===
In the summer of 1988, [[Steve Geppi]] of [[Diamond Comics Distribution]] bought Plant's distribution warehouses,&lt;ref&gt;"Bud Plant Sells Out to Diamond", ''The Comics Journal'' #124 (Aug. 1988), pp. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt; allowing Diamond to go "national",&lt;ref name="Success"&gt;Warshaw, Michael. "From Mailman to Tycoon", ''Success'' (June, 1994), pp. 28–32.&lt;/ref&gt; "thereby assuming control of "40 percent of the [[direct market|direct-sales market]]".&lt;ref name="DuinPlant"/&gt;

Later in 1988, Plant also sold Comics &amp; Comix.&lt;ref&gt;"Newswatch: "Comics &amp; Comix Sold", ''The Comics Journal'' #125 (October 1988), pp. 23–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Back to basics ===
Since divesting himself of his distribution and brick-and-mortar retail businesses, Plant has maintained a mail-order (and now Internet) presence in art books, trade paperbacks, and rare books.&lt;ref name="DuinPlant" /&gt; Plant is known for the colorful titles of his sales catalogs:

* ''Bud Plant's Incredible Catalog'' (1987–1994)
* ''Bud Plant Illustrated Books'' (1987–2005) — out-of-print/rare book catalog
* ''Bud Plant's Comic Art Update'' (1993–2002)
* ''Bud Plant Comic Art Wholesale Catalog'' (Winter 1996)
* ''Bud Plant's Incorrigible Catalog'' — pinup art, erotic comic books, etc. (Winter 2001–2002)
* ''Bud Plant's Incredible Update'' (2003–present) — continuation of ''Comic Art Update''

=== Realignment ===
On July 5, 2011, Plant announced plans to sell his mail-order business and retire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://budplant.blogspot.com/2011/07/for-immediate-release-bud-plant-to.html |title=Bud Plant to Retire-- Offers Catalog &amp; Internet Business of 41 Years for Sale |author=Bud Plant |authorlink= |date=July 5, 2011 |website=blog of BudsArtBooks.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812223925/http://budplant.blogspot.com/2011/07/for-immediate-release-bud-plant-to.html |archive-date=August 12, 2011 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=October 28, 2011 |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Then in April 2012 (after failing to find a buyer) he announced plans to downsize (eliminating print catalogs) but continue operations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://budplant.blogspot.com/2012/04/were-back-big-news.html#comment-form We're Back!

'''''Dash Galaxy in the Alien Asylum''''' is an action game for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], developed by [[Beam Software]] and published by [[Data East]], released in 1990 exclusively in North America.

==Gameplay==

The player takes the role of Dash Galaxy, a [[outer space|space]] [[Reconnaissance|scout]] who has been captured by a hostile civilization thousands of light years from earth.&lt;ref name="mg1"&gt;{{cite web |title=Dash Galaxy in the Alien Asylum (NES) |url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/dash-galaxy-in-the-alien-asylum |website=Moby Games |publisher=Moby Games |accessdate=5 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dash Galaxy ,through a shifting perspective contains action gameplay elements.&lt;ref name="vgb"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Slaven |first1=Andy |title=Video Game Bible 1985-2002 |date=2002 |publisher=Trafford Publishing |isbn=1553697316 |pages=386}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the game starts, the player has four lives.&lt;ref name="fc2"&gt;{{cite web |title=Dash Galaxy in the Alien Asylum (game manual) |url=http://www.thegameisafootarcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Dash-Galaxy-in-the-Alien-Asylum-Game-Manual.pdf |website=Data East |publisher=Data East |accessdate=5 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gameplay involves navigating through a series of floors with several rooms each. [[Key (lock)|Keys]] must be collected to progress to higher floors, and eventually, an escape ship. Dash's only weapons are a limited supply of [[bomb]]s and remote [[detonator]]s.&lt;ref name="fc2"&gt;{{cite web |title=Dash Galaxy in the Alien Asylum (game manual) |url=http://www.thegameisafootarcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Dash-Galaxy-in-the-Alien-Asylum-Game-Manual.pdf |website=Data East |publisher=Data East |accessdate=5 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Good timing is crucial to complete the game, requiring navigation of [[trampoline]] jumps and roaming enemies.  Some of these jumps require Dash to run.&lt;ref name="fc2"&gt;{{cite web |title=Dash Galaxy in the Alien Asylum (game manual) |url=http://www.thegameisafootarcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Dash-Galaxy-in-the-Alien-Asylum-Game-Manual.pdf |website=Data East |publisher=Data East |accessdate=5 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;The player also has a limited oxygen supply.&lt;ref name="mg1"&gt;{{cite web |title=Dash Galaxy in the Alien Asylum (NES) |url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/dash-galaxy-in-the-alien-asylum |website=Moby Games |publisher=Moby Games |accessdate=5 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Dash can become invincible each stage by collecting ten stars.&lt;ref name="fc2"&gt;{{cite web |title=Dash Galaxy in the Alien Asylum (game manual) |url=http://www.thegameisafootarcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Dash-Galaxy-in-the-Alien-Asylum-Game-Manual.pdf |website=Data East |publisher=Data East |accessdate=5 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the rooms are [[side-scrolling]] action puzzles, the floors have an overhead view, and include difficult block-moving puzzles that can fatally trap a player.

There are also hidden and bonus rooms throughout the game.&lt;ref name="mg1"&gt;{{cite web |title=Dash Galaxy in the Alien Asylum (NES) |url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/dash-galaxy-in-the-alien-asylum |website=Moby Games |publisher=Moby Games |accessdate=5 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reviews==

Helium.com wrote that Dash Galaxy "had potential,but falls under its own weight in the end" while giving the game a score of 41%.&lt;ref name="nl2"&gt;{{cite web |title=Dash Galaxy NES review |url=http://nintendolegend.com/2010/10/review-39-dash-galaxy-in-the-alien-asylum/ |website=Nintendo Legend |publisher=Helium (via Nintendo Legend) |accessdate=5 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Emma Carus''' (March 18, 1879&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; November 18, 1927) was a [[contralto]] singer from [[New York City]] who was in the cast of the original [[Ziegfeld Follies]] in 1907. Her given name was '''Emma Carus'''.&lt;ref name=real&gt;''Emma Carus Sues Broker'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', April 19, 1913, pg. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

She frequently sang in [[vaudeville]] and sometimes in [[Broadway theater|Broadway]] features.&lt;ref name=broadway&gt;''Emma Carus Seen In The Wife Hunters'', November 3, 1911, pg. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; One columnist described her as "a sort of combination of [[Sophie Tucker]] and [[Fay Templeton]] with a little of [[Eva Tanguay]] and [[Eddie Foy, Sr.|Eddie Foy]] thrown in for good measure."&lt;ref&gt;"Emma Carus Herself To Feature The Bill That Opens The New Year At The Palace This Afternoon",

Jack]]'s Theatre,&lt;ref name=sam&gt;"Notes Of The Week", ''The New York Times'', June 12, 1898, pg. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Madison Street (Chicago)]], [[State Street (Chicago)]], Chicago,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.streetswing.com/histclub/a1s.htm  StreetSwing.com Dance History Archives.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303211512/https://www.streetswing.com/histclub/a1s.htm |date=March 3, 2016 }} Retrieved on 12-24-07.&lt;/ref&gt;  in June 1898. Carus joined Troja, [[Jennie Yeamans]], and the Washburn sisters on a bill.&lt;ref name=sam/&gt;

In October 1905 Carus appeared on Broadway at Proctor's [[Fifth Avenue (Manhattan)]] Theatre. This was her first Broadway engagement since a show at the
Wistaria Grove,&lt;ref name=grove&gt;"Concerts At Proctor's", ''The New York Times'', October 29, 1905, pg. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; which was located on the roof of the [[Olympia Theatre (New York)|New York Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;"Roof Gardens and Summer Theatrical Offerings", ''The New York Times'', Sunday, June 11, 1905, pg. X4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Follies of 1907'' took place at the Jardin de Paris on the roofs of the [[Olympia Theatre (New York)|New York Theatre]] and the [[Criterion Theatre]]. Produced by [[Florenz Ziegfeld]], a large audience observed the thirteen parts, which were vaudeville acts. Carus headed a cast that was supported by a chorus quite similar to an earlier one that assisted  [[Anna Held]] in ''The Paris Model''.&lt;ref&gt;"Follies of 1907", ''The New York Times'', July 9, 1907, pg. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

She was in a production of ''The Wife Hunters'', a musical play in three acts, in which she sang in a ''pleasant, deep-throated way, and with a suggestion of a sense of humor of sentiment as occasion may require.'' Her comedy number was "Girls, Keep Your Figures". The [[Herald Square Theatre]],&lt;ref name=broadway/&gt; 1331 Broadway (29 West 35th Street),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibdb.com/venue.aspx?id=1199 IBDB Herald Square Theatre.] Retrieved on 12-24-07.&lt;/ref&gt;
produced the play which was based on a book by Edgar Allan Woolf.&lt;ref name=broadway/&gt;

In 1911, Carus is said to have been largely responsible for helping introduce and popularize [[Irving Berlin]]'s first major hit song, "[[Alexander's Ragtime Band]]". In [[Chicago]], it especially became identified with her, and soon it worked its way back to [[New York City|New York]] where [[Al Jolson]] picked it up and it quickly caught on in popularity.&lt;ref&gt;''As Thousands Cheer: The Life of Irving Berlin'' by Laurence Bergreen (Viking, 1990) p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

Carus sang at the [[Palace Theatre (Broadway)|Palace Theatre]] in a production which starred [[Bertha Kalich]] in March 1914. Also entertaining were the ''Beauties'' of [[Jesse Lasky]] and George White, noted for [[George White's Scandals]].&lt;ref&gt;"Amusements In General", ''The New York Times'', March 1, 1914, pg. X7.&lt;/ref&gt;
Carus returned for a fourth year on the interstate vaudeville circuit in 1914. This time she was accompanied by a dance partner, Carl Randall. She
had a new stock of songs that included ''An Irish Suffragette''.&lt;ref&gt;"Majestic Has Star For Week", ''San Antonio Light'', May 3, 1914, pg. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

Carus fainted at the Great Northern Hotel in [[Chicago, Illinois]] after hearing of her lover's suicide in June 1897. James Burrows killed himself in
[[Nashville, Tennessee]], where he managed a theater.  Carus tried to commit suicide with a revolver after learning of Burrow's demise, but was prevented by her friends.  She believed that his mother tried to influence Burrows against her.&lt;ref&gt;"Miss Carus Tries Suicide", ''[[The New York Times]]'', July 1, 1897, pg. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1913 Carus secured a judgment against W. Lewis Stevens, a broker. Stevens and his partner, James W. Henning, were accused by her of embezzling more than $2,200 of her money for their own use when their company failed in 1910.&lt;ref name=real/&gt; Stevens was arrested at the Iroquois Hotel,&lt;ref name=real/&gt; 49 West 44th Street, New York City.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;q=Iroquois+Hotel&amp;fb=1&amp;near=New+York,+NY&amp;cd=1&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;latlng=40755451,-73981522,9178749605651756939&amp;ei=qwhPR6vFKpOKiwGJu6GSAQ Iroquois Hotel Address and Interior Views.] Retrieved on 12-24-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

She was an avid baseball fan who followed the New York Giants of [[John McGraw (baseball)|John McGraw]]. Carus attended every [[World Series]] from 1905 until 1913.

'''Exposure''' in [[magic (illusion)|magic]] refers to the practice of revealing the methods of magic tricks.  

The practice is generally frowned upon amongst magicians, who believe that it ruins the experience of magical performances for audiences.

Exposure is uniquely impactful to magicians, as magic relies heavily on the elusive nature of secrets and methods in order to create mystery.

==Background==
Magic effects have been exposed by both [[professional]] and [[amateur]] magicians. Some magic effects have been exposed in stage [[Performance|shows]], and in other public media including [[television]],&lt;ref name=PLRW&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Z-knzhGD-dkC&amp;lpg=PR14&amp;dq=exposing%20magic%20tricks&amp;pg=PR14#v=onepage&amp;q=exposing%20magic%20tricks&amp;f=false Peter Lamont, Richard Wiseman (2005) ''Magic in Theory: An Introduction to the Theoretical and Psychological Elements of Conjuring''] pp xiv. Univ of Hertfordshire Press {{ISBN|1-902806-50-6}} Accessed 2010, May 20&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Internet]], certain video sharing interfaces, discussion forums, and blogs.

One notable case of exposure on network television involved [[Val Valentino]], performing as the "Masked Magician" in the Fox series ''[[Breaking the Magician's Code: Magic's Biggest Secrets Finally Revealed]]'', which ran between 1997 and 1998. Valentino was ostracized by the magic community and received much criticism from magicians for contravening the joint [[International Brotherhood of Magicians]] and [[Society of American Magicians]] ethics statement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pro-magic.net/news/story.php?pr=543 Young Magician Practices Abracadabra&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Penn &amp; Teller]] have often exposed their own tricks for the purposes of entertainment. [[Penn Jillette]] has stated that while the duo show the audience how a trick is done, it is often done so quickly or with different mechanics that the audience is unable to follow. {{citation needed|date=May 2010}} This highlights the need to distinguish ''apparent'' exposures performed by magicians during an act, which invariably turn out to be illusions in their own right.

==Arguments==
===Supporting exposure===

{| class=wikitable
! Reason !! Argument !! Counter Argument
|-
!Education
|New magicians need to learn somewhere. Exposure enables young magicians to develop their skills across a wide range of magical methods.  
|There are many accepted methods of teaching magic that targets those who want to perform, rather than those who just want to know the secret.
|-
!Innovation
|Exposure of old tricks forces magicians to develop new ones.
|Developing new tricks is a difficult, time consuming process.&lt;ref name=HH&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=4SgDAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA23&amp;dq=exposing%20magic%20tricks&amp;pg=PA23#v=onepage&amp;q=exposing%20magic%20tricks&amp;f=false Popular Science (Feb 1926) ''My Rope Escapes - By Houdini''] Vol. 108, No. 2, pp23. Bonnier Corporation ISSN 0161-7370 Accessed 2010, May 20&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than encourage innovation, exposure may discourage the process. Moreover, innovation is encouraged through competition and collaboration between magicians.
|-
!Appreciation of skill
|Exposure allows spectators to fully appreciate the range of skills involved in performing magic tricks. 
|The entertainment provided in magic is heightened by not knowing how the trick is achieved - unlike, e.g., juggling, where appreciation of the skill of the juggler adds to the experience.
|-
!Audience satisfaction
|Exposure allows the audience to feel "complete" after watching the performance, instead of being left with an unsatisfactory, nagging cliffhanger.
|The cliffhanger is key to the performance; not knowing how it is achieved keeps the trick magical and mysterious, instead of rendering it a simple step-by-step "how-to do this" exercise.
|}

===Opposing exposure===
{| class="wikitable"
! Reason !! Argument !! Counter Argument
|-
!Devaluation of tricks
|Exposure devalues magic tricks by removing their potential to surprise audiences.&lt;ref name=PC&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=517HZsS3ZAEC&amp;lpg=PA76&amp;dq=exposing%20magic%20tricks&amp;pg=PA76#v=onepage&amp;q=exposing%20magic%20tricks&amp;f=false Paul Curry (2003) ''Magician's Magic''] pp76. Courier Dover Publications {{ISBN|0-486-43176-2}} Accessed 2010, May 20&lt;/ref&gt; Exposures are oversimplified to the degree that they cheapen the art. 
|The dangers of exposure are easily exaggerated.&lt;ref name=PLRW/&gt; Many magic tricks which have been exposed in the past remain popular with audiences. In addition, many members of the public are indifferent to exposures and will neither seek them out nor remember the details for long. Finally, there exist strategies that allow a magician to continue to fool an audience even if they've been exposed to secrets for similar, or even identical, effects.&lt;ref name=andrewmusgrave&gt;{{cite web | url=http://sleightly.com/blog/2010/03/24/exposure-essays-retrospective/ | title=Exposure Essays Retrospective | publisher=Ye Olde Magick Blogge | year=2010 | first=Andrew | last=Musgrave | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100924152701/http://sleightly.com/blog/2010/03/24/exposure-essays-retrospective/ | archivedate=2010-09-24 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
!Intellectual property
|Exposure violates the [[intellectual property]] rights of the creator of the trick. Whilst magical secrets cannot be protected by the law, the moral code of practising magicians&lt;ref name=HH/&gt; respects the innovator of any particular secret.
|In most cases, [[Intellectual Property law]] does not protect magic methods. Most tricks rely on sleight of hand and knowledge of [[psychology|psychological principles]], neither of which are patentable in the capacity that scientific methods and processes are.
|-
!Potential for disruption
|Exposures provide ammunition for hecklers and saboteurs at the point of performance.
|These individuals will damage performances either way. A good performer should be able to cope with this.
|-
!Harms new magicians
|It is the simpler, cheaper tricks that young magicians rely on, which are most likely to be exposed. Exposure also encourages experienced magicians to avoid discussing methods with newcomers for fear that their methods will be revealed.
|Exposure aids new magicians by providing them with an easy, cheap source of new tricks.
|-
!Magic and criminality
|The skills and secrets of a magician can be used to harm the public, by creative cheats and emotional persuasion. Exposure may furnish those with [[Crime|criminal]] intent the skills needed to attempt such deception. 
|Exposure allows members of the public to become more keenly aware of the possibility of deception, and how it works.

'''''Flodders in America''''' ({{lang-nl|'''Flodder in Amerika!'''}}), released in [[Quebec]] as ''Les Lavigueur Redéménagent'', is a 1992 Dutch comedy film directed by [[Dick Maas]]. The film is the sequel of the successful film ''[[Flodder]]'' from 1986. It was filmed on location in [[New York City|New York]] and stars Dutch actors [[Huub Stapel]], [[Nelly Frijda]], [[Tatjana Simic]], [[Rene van 't Hof]], [[Lou Landre]], [[Gerard Joling]], [[Dick Rienstra]], and American actor [[Jon Polito]] as [[nightclub]] owner Larry Rosenbaum.

==Story==
The city council comes into contact with a cultural exchange project in the [[United States of America|USA]], which proposes to have an average family of either country live for a year in the other one. The sneaky councilman proposes the Flodders, who have been causing many problems over the last year, for the exchange, in the hope of getting rid of them for good. Sjakie van Kooten, the social worker who is guiding the Flodders' social integration, is send with them.

After a flight in which the family causes many problems, Sjakie and the Flodders land in New York. When Sjakie is renting a car, the Flodders are mistaken for a Russian delegation of scientists and taken to the [[Plaza Hotel]]. Sjakie loses the family and has his car towed away, forcing him to take a taxi to the office of his American colleagues, only to get stuck in the New York traffic and thereby arriving to late at the office and at the hotel he booked. The Flodders meanwhile go sightseeing in [[Manhattan]] and are invited to the reception of the [[Roosevelt Institute|Roosevelt Foundation]] which was meant for the Russian doctors. At the reception, a young man named Geoffrey sees daughter Kees and immediately tries to hook up with her, claiming he instantly fell in love. When the family gets back at the Plaza Hotel, the staff has found out about the mix-up and the Flodders are thrown out, forcing them to spend the night in [[Central Park]]. The next day, they get food by stealing a hot dog car and later by roasting some birds.

When searching through Sjakie's suitcase, the Flodders find the phone number of the exchange project and ring the office, where Sjakie has just arrived. When trying to get a taxi, Sjakie gets pushed aside and his glasses fall through a grid, which results in him getting stuck while trying to retrieve them. Hours go by, with Sjakie even getting robbed by two hoodlums and being peed on by a dog, until a demented hobo helps him out and takes him to a shelter to get some food. However, a fight breaks out in the shelter, after which the police arrive and throw Sjakie and the hobo in jail for a few days. The Flodders meanwhile rescue a man who is attacked by a group of muggers, after which the grateful man introduces himself as Larry Rosenbaum and takes them to the shady night club he owns. Soon he proposes them to come work for him.

A few days later the Flodders and the Rosenbaum couple have redecorated the night club, while at the same time Sjakie and his hobo friend are released from jail. When spotting the Flodder sons across the road, Sjakie tries to get to them, but gets hit by a car and ends up in hospital with a concussion. That same night, the night club opens again with a more Dutch oriented theme: [[bitterballen]] are served as snacks and daughter Kees does a striptease in a [[Frau Antje]] costume. Son Kees secretly steals gasoline from the guests' car, having discovered that gasoline in the United States is far cheaper than in the Netherlands, and stores the stolen fuel in an emtpy water tank on the roof to make a huge profit back in the Netherlands (while not realising that there is no way he can get the tank to the Netherlands). Meanwhile, Sjakie gets mixed up with another patient at hospital, only to wake up in the morning and discover he has had a [[transition (transgender)|transgender operation]].

After some days, Johnny, daughter Kees and son Kees meet the muggers from Central Park again and get chased by them through the streets of Manhattan, resulting in the muggers crashing into the [[New York Stock Exchange]], after which the Flodder siblings are arrested. However, when finding the business card of Geoffrey, the police immediately releases them, after which the Flodders are met by Geoffrey who asks whether he can take daughter Kees out for the night, which Johnny only allows when Geoffrey pays him $5000,-. Although daughter Kees is not enthusiastic about Geoffrey, one of his advisers fears the worst and does research on the Flodder family. Soon it becomes clear to the viewer that Geoffrey's father is in fact the president of the United States. Not wanting his son to be involved with a white trash girl, the president decides to go the nightclub incognito, to talk daughter Kees out of the affair.

Just at the night the president arrives and tries to talk to daughter Kees in her dressing room, the situation escalates because Rosenbaum catches his wife and Johnny having sex in the stockroom, after which Rosenbaum gets infuriated and tries to attack Johnny with a shotgun. By the time the police arrive, Ma Flodder has already stopped Rosenbaum by putting his head underwater. However, when Ma spits out her cigar it accenditally flies into the frying pan, creating a fire which lights the gasoline in the water tank. The water tank is launched into the air and flies over Manhattan (spotted by characters like the hobo and the muggers) after which it hits the head of the Statue of Liberty. The head promptly explodes.

When rushing into daughter Kees's dressing room, two police officers have recognised the president, who had tried to get away and thereby fell over the topless girl. In order to prevent a scandal, the American government makes an agreement with the Dutch embassy and has the Flodders released from jail, on the condition that they leave the country. Johnny manages to get a first class flight for the family as well as lots of expensive clothing, as a compensation for not telling anybody about the scandal. When on the plane back to Europe, he teasingly asks Sjakie whether he is reading the [[Playgirl]].

==Comic book adaptation==

Simultaneously with the film release the movie was also adapted into a comic book written by Dick Maas, Wijo Koek and drawn by Marcel Bosma. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.lambiek.net/artists/b/bosma_marcel.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Gold Prix de la TNT''''' (&lt;small&gt;[[English language|English]]&lt;/small&gt;: Gold TNT Award), nicknamed as '''''Les Gold''''', is a [[France|French]] accolade bestowed in a ceremony by various telecom organizations partenant with [[w:fr:Télé Star|Télé Star]] in recognition of excellence in programs and professionals of [[French television|French]] and [[Francophone]] television. They are models as the [[Emmy Award]] equivalent.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.goldprixdelatnt.fr/#!/c1mna&lt;/ref&gt;

The ceremony was preconceived to be the successor of the ''[[7 d'Or]]'' (now discontinued) and become one of greatest in French television. The [[César Award]] for cinema, the ''[[Victoires de la Musique]]'' for music and the [[Molière Award]] for theater, can be considered as equivalent.

== Organization ==
The five nomination categories are voted by a jury of journalists and news editors of television, representing all French media: [[Europe 1]], [[RTL Group|RTL]], [[w:fr:Public (magazine) | Public]], [[Closer (magazine) | Closer]] and [[w:fr:Télé Star|Télé Star]]. The list of nominees is communicated May 11, at midnight. The official list of nominations for TNT's Gold Award is then posted on the site of the ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.goldprixdelatnt.fr/#!/c1ylo&lt;/ref&gt;

The first round of voting determines, in each category, emissions, Animators and columnists who received enough votes to enter the second round. The nominations are among 5 categories. The closing of the first round takes place five days before the press conference announces appointments. The second round determines, in each category, or the ones who, having obtained the highest number of votes will be awarded. The announcement of the winners takes place at the ceremony, June 9, , in the presence of all named and many personalities of French television.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.goldprixdelatnt.fr/#!/c1ylo&lt;/ref&gt;

The closing of the second round takes place in online voting two days before the ceremony.The counting of votes in the second round is controlled and enclosed by the bailiff in his study, from 16h on the day of the ceremony. It then prepares secure envelopes containing the names of the winners of the 12 categories, and then affix his seal them. From that moment, he constantly keeps the 12 envelopes with him.He finally makes it to the place of the ceremony at 20h, and settled behind the scenes. The bailiff then hands personally and personally to each of remitters, as and extent of the advertisement trophies, the sealed envelope, which will then be opened on stage, live, by delivering and its contents revealed to the public.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.goldprixdelatnt.fr/#!/c1ylo&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''I Married Marge'''" is the twelfth episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; [[The Simpsons (season 3)|third season]]. It originally aired on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] in the United States on December 26, 1991. In the episode, [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] worries that she may yet again be pregnant and drives to [[Dr. Hibbert]]'s office. While anxiously waiting, [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] begins to tell [[Bart Simpson|Bart]], [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]], and [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]] the story of how he and Marge got married and how Bart was born.

Written by [[Jeff Martin (writer)|Jeff Martin]] and directed by [[Jeffrey Lynch]], "I Married Marge" was the second flashback episode of ''The Simpsons'' after season two's "[[The Way We Was]]". It features cultural references to ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'', ''[[Charlie's Angels]]'', and ''[[Ms. Pac-Man]]''. The title of the episode is a play on the American television series ''[[I Married Joan]]''. Since airing, "I Married Marge" has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. It acquired a [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen rating]] of 11.9 and was the highest-rated show on the Fox network the week it aired.

The episode was the first of three about the births of the Simpsons children, this one covering Bart's birth, with Lisa's covered in "[[Lisa's First Word]]" in the fourth season, and Maggie's covered in the sixth-season episode "[[And Maggie Makes Three]]". The episode also expands upon the family's origins as a result of Marge falling pregnant with Bart, briefly referred to in "[[The Way We Was]]", and introduces key moments, such as Bart's conception at a Mini-Golf course, which would ultimately become a major part of the series' canon.

==Plot==
[[Marge Simpson|Marge]] and [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] worry that Marge may be pregnant again after a home pregnancy test gives inconclusive results, so Marge drives to [[Dr. Hibbert]]'s office to take another test. While waiting, Homer tells [[Bart Simpson|Bart]], [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]], and [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]] the story of how he and Marge got married, and Bart's birth thereafter. In 1980, Homer works at a [[miniature golf|mini-golf]] course and is dating Marge. One night, they [[make out]] inside a golf course castle after seeing ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]''. A few days later, Marge feels sick and tells Homer that she might be pregnant. He takes her to Dr. Hibbert's office, who confirms that Marge is pregnant. Homer is less than thrilled over the announcement, but since he loves Marge; he proposes to her and she accepts.

They decide to name their new baby Bart, as it is the first name they could think of that Homer did not think other children would make fun of. The two marry in a small wedding chapel across the state line. They spend their wedding night at [[Simpson family#The Bouvier family|Marge's family]]'s house, sleeping on a couch in the living room, which irritates Marge's mother [[Simpson family#Jacqueline Bouvier|Jacqueline]] and her twin sisters [[Patty and Selma]].

Homer's wages at the mini-golf course are insufficient to pay for his growing family so he applies for a job at the [[Springfield Nuclear Power Plant]], but is unsuccessful. When Homer and Marge's newly purchased baby supplies and Marge's wedding ring are repossessed, Homer decides to leave and find a job. When Marge reads the letter Homer left behind explaining his actions, she is devastated and brought to tears. Homer gets a job at a "Gulp N' Blow" taco restaurant, where Patty and Selma find him. Selma, seeing how unhappy her younger sister is without Homer, decides to tell Marge the truth in spite of Patty's reluctance (due to her obvious hatred of Homer). Marge finds Homer and convinces him to come back home with her. When Homer says he cannot provide much material wealth for Marge, she reminds him that anything he gives her is valuable, because it is from him.

Homer applies for a job at the power plant once more, this time marching into [[Mr. Burns]]'s office and telling him that he will be the perfect employee. Mr. Burns is so impressed that he hires Homer on the spot. When Homer returns to Marge's house, he learns from his mother-in-law Jacqueline that she has gone into labor and is already at the hospital. He hurries there and sees Marge with Selma and an angry Patty, who starts berating him. Fed up with her disrespect, Homer lashes out at Patty and angrily tells Patty (as well as the rest of the Bouvier family) to start showing him some respect for  the fact he has a job, a piece of news that Homer promptly tells Marge before she finally gives birth to Bart. After Homer finishes telling his flashback story, he admits to Bart that he received the greatest gift a man can have the day Bart was born. At that time, Marge arrives home with the news that she is not pregnant. They are both overjoyed and [[high-five]].

[[File:Jeff Martin.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The episode was written by [[Jeff Martin (writer)|Jeff Martin]].]]
"I Married Marge" was written by [[Jeff Martin (writer)|Jeff Martin]] and directed by [[Jeffrey Lynch]]. It was the second flashback episode of ''The Simpsons'' and a sequel to the previous one, "[[The Way We Was]]", which tells the story of how Homer and Marge met in high school.&lt;ref name="Jean"&gt;{{cite video |people=Jean, Al |date=2003 |title=The Simpsons season 3 DVD commentary for the episode "I Married Marge" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; Executive producer [[Sam Simon]] was concerned that the writers were being "inefficient" with the episode; he thought the three plots of Homer and Marge's marriage, the birth of Bart, and Homer getting his job should have been extended into three episodes instead of one.&lt;ref name="Martin"&gt;{{cite video |people=Martin, Jeff |date=2003 |title=The Simpsons season 3 DVD commentary for the episode "I Married Marge" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The staff were concerned over the animation of the characters' eyes in the episode, as the pupils were larger than normal, making the characters look "stoned", and the eyeballs were "too round" and large. The animation artists at the animation studio in [[South Korea]], where much of the animation process takes place, had begun stenciling the eyes with a template, which according to Lynch resulted in "strangely round eyes which look a little too big sometimes and much too perfect. Which is very un-''Simpsons'' like."&lt;ref name="Lynch"&gt;{{cite video |people=Lynch, Jeffrey |date=2003 |title=The Simpsons season 3 DVD commentary for the episode "I Married Marge" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marge was designed with shorter hair in the flashback sequences to make her appear younger. Lynch thought it was nice to see Marge in a "younger, more attractive mode, and sort of watching her progress through pregnancy."&lt;ref name="Lynch"/&gt;

Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. Pete Oliva of ''[[North Texas Daily]]'' praised the writers for providing back stories that are "believable" and do not feel "contrived or hastily thought through."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://media.www.ntdaily.com/media/storage/paper877/news/2003/08/29/UndefinedSection/Simpsons.Third.Box.Set.Charming.FeatureFilled-1888369.shtml |title=Simpsons' third box set charming, feature-filled |last=Olivia |first=Pete |date=August 29, 2003 |work=[[North Texas Daily]] |accessdate=2009-07-02 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors of the book ''I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide'', Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, thought it was a "moving" episode with "plenty of great [[setpiece]]s."&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/simpsons/episodeguide/season3/page12.shtml |title=I Married Marge |accessdate=2009-06-07 |author1=Martyn, Warren |author2=Wood, Adrian |year=2000 |publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson described the episode as "sweet and funny" and a "nice piece of ''Simpsons'' history." Jacobson went on to say that he enjoyed the flashback concept and that the episode develops the characters "nicely" and gives the viewers "a good sense for the era in which it takes place."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dvdmg.com/simpsonsseasonthree.shtml |title=The Simpsons: The Complete Third Season (1991) |last=Jacobson |first=Colin |date=August 21, 2003 |publisher=DVD Movie Guide |accessdate=2009-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nate Meyers of Digitally Obsessed gave it a 5/5 rating, and highlighted the scenes with Marge's sisters Patty and Selma, "barraging Homer with insults", as the "funniest moments" of the episode. Meyers added: "The episode's climax is a great moment for Homer and fans of the show."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digitallyobsessed.com/displaylegacy.php?ID=6129 |title=The Simpsons: The Complete Third Season |last=Meyers |first=Nate |date=June 23, 2004 |publisher=Digitally Obsessed |accessdate=2009-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Molly Griffin of ''The Observer'' said "I Married Marge" is one of the season three episodes that turned the show into "the cultural force it is today."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://media.www.ndsmcobserver.com/media/storage/paper660/news/2004/01/21/Scene/simpsons.Dvd.Set.Delivers.The.Goods-583958-page2.shtml |title='Simpsons' DVD set delivers the goods |last=Griffin |first=Molly |date=January 21, 2004 |work=The Observer |accessdate=2009-07-03 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''Drawn to Television – Prime-time Animation from the Flintstones to Family Guy'', Keith Booker wrote: "The episode details in a rather sentimental fashion the early struggles of the irresponsible Homer to support his new family [...] Such background episodes add an extra dimension to the portrayal of the animated Simpson family, making them seem oddly real and adding weight to their status as a family with a long history together."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Booker |first=Keith |title=Drawn to Television - Prime-time Animation from the Flintstones to Family Guy |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=2006 |page=52 |isbn=978-0-313-07615-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EGtTOAGYSWQC&amp;pg=PA52&amp;dq=%22the+way+we+was%22+simpsons#PPA52,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Imponderables''''' is a series of eleven books written by [[David Feldman (author)|David Feldman]] and published by [[Harper Collins]]. The books examine, investigate, and explain common, yet puzzling phenomena. Examples include "Why do your eyes hurt when you are tired?", "Why do judges wear black robes?", and "Why do you rarely see purple Christmas lights?", among many others. The word "imponderable" is used to describe such mysteries of everyday life. The books are effectively a [[frequently asked questions]] list for people who wonder why and how the world works as it does.

The first book in this series, ''Imponderables: The Solution to the Mysteries of Everyday Life'', was illustrated by Kas Schwan and was published in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, David. ''Imponderables: the solution to the mysteries of everyday life.'' {{ISBN|0-688-05914-7}}. Quill; 1350 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10019. 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

The books feature additional chapters on ''Frustables'', which are defined as imponderables that are uniquely frustrating because they lack a clear answer. Some of the recurring frustables are:

*Why do you so often see one shoe lying along the side of the road?
*[[traffic directionality|Why do the English drive on the left and most other countries on the right?]]
*Why do American women shave their armpits?
*Why do doctors have such messy handwriting?

The term "Imponderables" is a [[trademark]].

'''Indian People’s Theatre Association''' ('''IPTA''') is the oldest association of theatre-artists in [[India]]. IPTA was formed in 1943 [[British Raj|pre independence India]], during which it promoted themes related to the [[Indian freedom struggle]]. Its goal was to bring cultural awakening among the people of India.&lt;ref&gt;Bengali Theatre and Performing Arts. Article in [http://www.bangla-online.info/BanglaLanguage/BengaliTheatrePerformanceArts.htm Bangla-online.info]&lt;/ref&gt; It is the cultural wing of the [[Communist Party of India]].&lt;ref name="LoweLloyd1997"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lisa Lowe|author2=David Lloyd|title=The Politics of Culture in the Shadow of Capital|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UKzABvKz-gAC&amp;pg=PA454|accessdate=16 December 2012|date=27 October 1997|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=978-0-8223-2046-3|pages=454–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beginning==
Banglore unit of IPTA was formed in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780198601746.001.0001/acref-9780198601746-e-1898|title=Indian People's Theatre Association - Oxford Reference|language=en|doi=10.1093/acref/9780198601746.001.0001/acref-9780198601746-e-1898|access-date=2018-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; IPTA was formed on 25 May 1943 at the National conference of theater artists held at the Marwari school, [[Bombay]] in response to the need for theater artists to become part of the Indian freedom struggle. Its origins lay in the first Progressive Writer’s Association Conference that was held in 1936, the establishment of the Youth Cultural Institute at Calcutta in 1940, and the setting up of the People’s Theatre in Bangalore by Anil De’ Silva in 1941. Its initial members consisted of various progressive cultural troupes, theatre groups and other progressive cultural activists. The name People’s Theatre was suggested by the renowned scientist Homi Jahangir Bhabha who was in turn inspired by Romain Rolland’s book on the concepts of People’s Theatre.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web |title=About IPTA and its history |url=http://www.iptaindia.in/about/ | publisher=IPTA |accessdate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its initial activities included street plays organized by Binoy Roy of the Bengal Cultural Squad to inform people of the 1942 manmade famine in Bengal. Their ski included a choir ‘Bhookha Hai Bengal’ created by Vamik Jaunpuri and other songs and plays. The squad included musician Prem Dhawan , drum player Dashrath Lal, singer Reva Roy and actress Usha Dutt. Motivated by this squad, several other cultural groups were formed including the Agra Cultural Squad. IPTA was subsequently formed to organize these local groups at the national level.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt; 

Ideologically these groups were inspired by the left movement and the then General Secretary of the Communist Party of India, P.C. Joshi and the General Secrtetary of the Progressive Writers’ Association Sajjad Zaheer.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

==initial Members==
Some of the initial members of the group were [[Prithviraj Kapoor]], [[Bijon Bhattacharya]], [[Balraj Sahni]], [[Ritwik Ghatak]], [[Utpal Dutt]], [[Khwaja Ahmad Abbas]], [[Salil Chowdhury]], Pandit [[Ravi Shankar]], Jyotirindra Moitra, [[Niranjan Singh Maan]], [[S. Tera Singh Chan]], [[Jagdish Faryadi]], [[Khalili Faryadi]], [[Rajendra Raghuvanshi]] Safdar Mir, Hasan Premani,Amiya Bose etc. The group was formed in 1942, in the background of the [[Second World War]], with [[Bengal famine of 1943]] and starvation deaths in India on the one hand and repression by the colonial masters in the wake of the [[Quit India Movement]] and the aggression by the fascist powers on the [[Soviet Union]] on the other. An All India People's Theatre Conference was held in [[Mumbai]] in 1943 where the group presented its idea and objective of representing the crisis of the time through the medium of theatre and to help people understand their rights and duties. This conference led to the formation of committees of IPTA across India. The movement hit not only theatres, but also cinema and music in Indian languages.Now it is the cultural wing of Communist Party of India (CPI)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Constitution of IPTA |url=http://www.iptaindia.in/about/constitution-of-ipta/ | publisher=IPTA |accessdate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Nabanna''==
{{Main|Nabanna (play)}}
&lt;!-- Commented out: [[File:Shobha sen in nabanna.jpg|thumb|left|[[Shobha Sen]] in ''[[Nabanna]]'', 1944]] --&gt;
The most important of the dramas were ''[[Nabanna (play)|Nabanna]]'' (Harvest). ''Nabanna'' is a folk-cultural festival of [[Bengal]] to celebrate the harvest. This [[Bengali language|Bengali]] drama, written by Bijon Bhattacharya and directed by [[Sombhu Mitra]], portrayed the evils of the [[Bengal famine of 1943]]

==Other dramas and films==
''Nava Jiboner Gaan'' (Song of New  Life) by [[Jyotirindra Moitra]] and the film ''[[Dharti Ke Lal]]'' (Children of the Earth) by [[Khwaja Ahmad Abbas]] followed ''Nabanna'' in addressing the needs of the people. These performances were characteristic for their vivid, stark portrayal of the suffering of the masses. Similar productions were carried out all over India, like ''Deshasathi'' in [[Marathi language|Marathi]] which was about the attack on the Soviet Union by [[Nazi]] [[Germany]]; ''Prarambham'' in [[Telugu language|Telugu]]; and ''Zubeida'' directed by [[Balraj Sahni]] and based on the story of a Muslim girl from [[Malabar (Northern Kerala)|Malabar]]. [[Manikuntala Sen]], the fire band woman of left politics acted in this play along with [[Gopal Halder]], who later became an educationist.

==Break up and legacy==
Though the group was temporarily dispersed by the [[Indian National Congress]] government using police violence and repressive measures in 1947, its main members continued to carry the legacy of IPTA by forming several groups with similar ideology. Ahindra Chowdhuri, [[Sombhu Mitra]] and [[Tripti Mitra]] were the leading members of the group ''Bohurupee''. ''Raktakarabi'', ''Tahar Nam Ti Ranjana'', ''Char Adhyay'' (written by [[Rabindranath Tagore]]) were some of the earlier productions of Bohurupee. Utpal Dutt led another faction of artists and went to create classics like ''Tiner Talowar'' and ''Kallol''. '''IPTA Mumbai''' was another offshoot that has existed over the last six decades and continue to produce dramas till date.&lt;ref&gt;Indian People's Theatre Association. [http://www.mumbaitheatreguide.com/dramas/groups/ipta.asp Article in mumbaitheatreguide.com]&lt;/ref&gt; IPTA offshoots exist in other parts of India as well.&lt;ref&gt;Suhrid Sankar Chattopadhyay. [http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl2213/stories/20050701001708800.htm A stage for social commitment]. Frontline. Volume 22, Issue 13, June18 - July01, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Group theaters like ''[[Nandikar]]'', ''Spandan'' of Kolkata still produce their dramas often in the line of the IPTA movement, and recently there has been effort to start a similar movement inspired by the IPTA.&lt;ref&gt;Indian Peoples Theatre Association revival by [http://www.spandanipta.com/about.html Spandan]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Delhi-based theatre company [[Jana Natya Manch]], best known for its street theatre, also emerged from the IPTA in 1973. Noted film director, [[Ritwik Ghatak]] made a Bengali film, ''[[Komal Gandhar]]'' (1961) set around IPTA theatre group.

There are many groups which were regionally floated and still continue the legacy of IPTA both Pre and Post independence. Some of the groups which have grown to be biggest of theater groups in India.

Few Prominent ones are: [[Praja natya mandali]] - Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, Samudaaya in Karnataka.

==IPTA in West Bengal==

At present IPTA West Bengal is a running organisation led by IPTA West Bengal State Committee. The Secretary is Sri Gora Ghosh, President Sri Hiranmoy Ghosal, Asst. Secretary Sri Ashim Bandyopadhyay. There are many cultural personalities like mass singer Kankan Bhattacharjee, Sankar Mukherjee, Tapan Hazra,Pijus Sarkar, Suvendu Maity, Abhoy Dasgupta etc. There are 19 District Committees under this organisation. No. of Artist members 7000 approx. IPTA W B has been reorganised in its 3rd conference held on 1967 at Kolkata Bagbazar reading room Library.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Social Movement Media|last=John D.H. Downing|first=Naxalite Movement Media (India)|publisher=SAGE publications|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=359}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hundreds of dramas have been produced still today since 1967. Such as ''Bis e June'' by Biru Mukhopadhyay, Bastav Sastra and Buno Hans by Hiren Bhattacharya, Haraner Nat Jamai by Sisir Sen, Telengana,Jowa and Fulwali by Basudeb Dasgupta, Fatik chander Swapnaguli, Hanadaar,Adab, Judhistirer Narak Darsan, Haripadar Panja Larai (Street Drama) by Ashim Bandyopadhyay. Abelay Amritakatha, Jaban Bandi (Street Drama), Chhoto Bakulpurer jatri, Aaj O Itihaas, Tarapadar Maa, Ganpat Kahar, by Sudip Sarkar. Matador, No Problem, Light House by jayanta Chakraborty. Ramdhanu, Aami Krishna, Virus, Ananta Yatra by Tapan Hazra etc.

==IPTA in Raigarh, Chhattisgarh==
IPTA Raigarh was established in 1982 during the first state conference of IPTA which was organized by the Raigarh unit in 1982. Since then Raigarh unit has been active and practicing theatre in this small district of [[Chhattisgarh]] (earlier [[Madhya Pradesh]]).

In 1994, when the Golden Jubilee of IPTA was celebrated nationwide, this unit decided to celebrate the Golden Jubilee by organizing a five-day theatre festival during the month of December. Although meant to be a one-off event, it was very well received and later on, it was decided to continue this as an annual event. This is how the National Theatre Festival was born and conceived.

The same year IPTA was reorganized and it spread its activities, started imparting training and updating artists by means of organizing theatre workshops every year for youth as well as for children. Since 1995, theatre stalwarts like [[Arun Pandey]], [[Sanjay Upadhyay]], [[Suman Kumar]], [[Gautam Mazumdar]], [[Devendra Raj Ankur]], [[Ranjeet Kapoor]], [[Akhilesh Khanna]], [[Neeraj Wahal]], [[Praveen Gunjan]] &amp; [[Anjana Puri]] have conducted workshops and trained our artists.

Besides organizing theatre workshops and festivals, IPTA Raigarh started participating in various festivals to showcase their productions in different cities like Delhi, Allahabad, Jabalpur, Raipur, Aurangabad, Bhopal, Patna, Gaya, Sagar, Ratlam among the few.

In 2001, IPTA Raigarh registered itself as ‘IPTA Center for Cultural Resources and Training’ with the Registrar of firms &amp; societies, Government of India.

"IPTA Center for cultural resources &amp; training" has emerged as one of the pro-active theatre groups in [[Chhattisgarh]] State.

Artistes of the group, including child artistes, have acted in a film "Chutakan Ki Mahabharat" produced by Children’s Film Society Of India and Directed by [[Sankalp Meshram]], which won the National Award for the Best Children’s Film in 2005, conferred by the Government of India.

IPTA Raigarh also publishes its annual Magazine "Rankarm" which is endorsed by Kendriya Hindi Nideshalaya and is being distributed throughout the country with the help of the same. This magazine has been published annually since 2003.

==Punjab==
The Indian People`s Theatre Association (IPTA) movement in Punjab greatly altered the theatre as it was reoriented toward playing a greater role as an instrument of social change. The IPTA movement in Punjab brought out artists like Shiela Bhatia, [[Balraj Sahni]], [[Balwant Gargi]], Niranjan Singh Maan[[Tera Singh Chan]], [[Joginder Bahrla]], [[Pandit Khalili]], the Theatre workers, [[Parkash Kaur]], her younger sister [[Surinder Kaur]], and Amarjit Gurdaspuri the famous folk singers in the service of people's concerns. They made serious efforts to take Punjabi theatre and folk culture to the masses.

==Notes==
{{reflist}}
&lt;!-- NO ADVERTISEMENTS, IF NOTABLE PLEASE CREATE A SEPARATE ARTICLE *[['''ifta''' (INSTITUTE OF FACTUAL THEATRE ARTS) Institute of Factual Theatre Arts is a well-known entertainment groups and working in this particular field since 1998. In the Mainstream Proscenium the group is working sincerely. But it has not restricted its limits only at proscenium theatre but street theatre, intimate theatre, poster drama and other theatre forms. The experimentation continued to yield the excellence reflecting in the increasing popularity of production as well as the group.
In one hand it was increasing its social work on the country the mainstream using was on full swing. The group premiered ‘KI-KAN-DO’ a satire drama at Rabindra Sadan in 2002. Then in 2003 it launched ‘RITU SUKHE BIBARNO KAVITA’ conflict between libido crisis and continuous transformation of the conjugal life. On 2003 another short play ‘MAA’, inspired from ‘Mother’ by Maxim Gorky was staged. In 2004 it has launched its first bi-lingual production ‘Chitrangada’, a mythological journey of metamorphosis, inspired from Tagore’s dance drama ‘Chitrangada’. For the first time from the drawing room pattern, the director tried to explore a new form. Live music, Folk Elements, Martial Art, Chhou (known folk form) and songs of Tagore was used to design the drama. The novelty and musical format earn the invitation in two consecutive “National Youth Festival” of 2005 and 2006. The production won ‘gold’ in 2005. Now it is working in its new production “Sacrifice”, premiered at Rabindra Sadan on 6th March 2007. --&gt;

[[Image:Kell_factor1.png|thumb|236px|right|At 0.5 cycles/pixel, the Nyquist limit, signal amplitude depends on phase, as visible by the three medium-gray curves where the signal goes 90° out of phase with the pixels.]]
[[Image:Kell_factor2.png|thumb|236px|right|At 0.33 cycles/pixel, 0.66 times the Nyquist limit, amplitude can largely be maintained regardless of phase. Some artifacts are still visible, but minor.]]

The '''Kell factor''', named after [[RCA]] engineer [[Raymond D. Kell]], is a parameter used to limit the bandwidth of a sampled image signal to avoid the appearance of [[beat frequency]] patterns when displaying the image in a discrete display device, usually taken to be 0.7. The number was first measured in 1934 by Raymond D. Kell and his associates as 0.64 but has suffered several revisions given that it is based on image perception, hence subjective, and is not independent of the type of display. It was later revised to 0.85 but can go higher than 0.9, when fixed pixel scanning (e.g., [[charge-coupled device|CCD]] or [[Active pixel sensor|CMOS]]) and [[fixed pixel display]]s (e.g., [[liquid crystal display|LCD]] or [[plasma display|plasma]]) are used, or as low as 0.7 for [[electron gun]] scanning.

From a different perspective, the Kell factor defines the effective [[image resolution|resolution]] of a discrete display device since the full resolution cannot be used without viewing experience degradation. The actual sampled resolution will depend on the spot size and intensity distribution. For [[electron gun]] scanning systems, the spot usually has a Gaussian intensity distribution. For CCDs, the distribution is somewhat rectangular, and is also affected by the sampling grid and inter-pixel spacing.

Kell factor is sometimes incorrectly stated to exist to account for the effects of interlacing. Interlacing itself does not affect Kell factor, but because interlaced video must be low-pass filtered (i.e., blurred) in the vertical dimension to avoid spatio-temporal aliasing (i.e., flickering effects), the Kell factor of interlaced video is said to be about 70% that of progressive video with the same scan line resolution.

== The beat frequency problem ==

To understand how the distortion comes about, let us consider an ideal linear process from sampling to display. When a signal is sampled at a frequency that is at least double the [[Nyquist frequency]], it can be fully reconstructed by low-pass filtering since the first repeat spectra does not overlap the original baseband spectra. In discrete displays the image signal is not low-pass filtered since the display takes discrete values as input, i.e. the signal displayed contains all the repeat spectra. The proximity of the highest frequency of the baseband signal to the lowest frequency of the first repeat spectra induces the [[beat frequency]] pattern. The pattern seen on screen can at times be similar to a [[Moiré pattern]]. The Kell factor is the reduction necessary in signal bandwidth such that no beat frequency is perceived by the viewer.

== Examples ==
* A 625-line analog (e.g., 50&amp;nbsp;Hz [[PAL]]) television picture is divided into 576 visible lines from top to bottom. Suppose a card featuring horizontal black and white stripes is placed in front of the camera. The effective vertical resolution of the TV system is equal to the largest number of stripes that can be within the picture height and appear as individual stripes. Since it is unlikely the stripes will line up perfectly with the lines on the camera's sensor, the number is slightly less than 576. Using a Kell factor of 0.7, the number can be determined to be 0.7&amp;times;576 = 403.2 lines of resolution.
* Kell factor can be used to determine the horizontal resolution that is required to match the vertical resolution attained by a given number of [[scan line]]s. For [[576i]] at 50&amp;nbsp;Hz, given its 4:3 [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]], the required horizontal resolution must be 4/3 times the effective vertical resolution, or (4/3)&amp;times;0.7&amp;times;576 = 537.6 pixels per line. Taken further, since 537.6 pixels is equal to a maximum of 268.8 cycles for an alternating pixel pattern, and given 576i&amp;nbsp;50&amp;nbsp;Hz has an active line period of 52µs, its [[Luminance (video)|luminance]] signal requires a bandwidth of 268.8/52 = 5.17&amp;nbsp;MHz.
* Kell factor applies equally to digital devices. Using a Kell factor of 0.9, a [[1080p]] [[High-definition television|HDTV]] video system using a CCD camera and an LCD or plasma display will only have 1728&amp;times;972 lines of resolution.

'''''LG15: The Resistance''''' (September 20, 2008—December 12, 2008) is a [[web television]] series produced by [[EQAL]] that took place within the [[Lonelygirl15|LG15 Universe]]. The series was first announced on July 4, 2008 via the official behind-the-scenes LG15 blog, Inside.&lt;ref&gt;[http://inside.lg15.com/2008/07/04/lg15-update/ LG15 Update, Inside, July 4, 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120712100121/http://inside.lg15.com/2008/07/04/lg15-update/ |date=July 12, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It premiered on September 16, 2008 at the [[New York Television Festival]],&lt;ref name="adage"&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://adage.com/webvideoreport/article?article_id=132108 | title= 'LonelyGirl15' Creators Explore New 'Resistance' | publisher=''[[Advertising Age]]'' | date=October 29, 2008 | accessdate=Aug 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was first uploaded for public viewing on September 20, 2008.&lt;ref name="cnet"&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13577_3-10026704-36.html | title= 'Lonelygirl15' creators unveil new Web show, 'The Resistance' | publisher=''[[CNET Networks|Cnet]]'' | date=August 27, 2008 | accessdate=Aug 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show continued upon the [[mythology]] established by ''[[lonelygirl15]]'' and ''[[KateModern]]''. Two main characters from the lonelygirl15 series, Jonas ([[Jackson Davis]]) and Sarah ([[Alexandra Dreyfus]]), were also carried over.&lt;ref name="newteevee1"&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://newteevee.com/2008/08/27/lonelygirl15s-second-incarnation-the-resistance/ | title= lonelygirl15’s Second Incarnation: The Resistance | publisher=''[[GigaOM|Newteevee]]'' | date=August 27, 2008 | accessdate=Aug 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Daily content was provided in the form of video blogs, images, text blogs, and other information posted daily from the characters at LG15.com.  On the following Saturday, all of the content from the previous week was compiled into one 6- to 10-minute episode to end that week's "chapter".&lt;ref name="adage"/&gt;&lt;ref name="newteevee2"&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://station.newteevee.com/2008/09/16/lg15-the-resistance-an-anti-revolution/ | title= LG15: The Resistance An Anti-Revolution? | publisher=''[[GigaOM|Newteevee]]'' | date=September 26, 2008 | accessdate=Aug 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LG15: The Resistance also marked the debut of a new LG15.com website. On September 8, 2008, two-hundred members of the LG15 community were invited to participate in a private beta of the new website. One week later, on September 15, it was officially released.  The new LG15.com utilizes [[social networking]] capabilities such as member profile pages, a new forum, the ability to upload response videos, and the ability to interact with the show's characters and to help solve in-show puzzles.&lt;ref name="tilzy1"&gt;{{Cite news | url=http://www.tilzy.tv/lonelygirl15-producer-amanda-goodfried-on-the-resistance.htm | title=‘Lonelygirl15′ Producer Amanda Goodfried on ‘The Resistance’ | publisher=''Tilzy.tv'' | date=August 27, 2008 | accessdate=Aug 8, 2009 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204070133/http://www.tilzy.tv/lonelygirl15-producer-amanda-goodfried-on-the-resistance.htm | archive-date=2009-02-04 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==

===Season One: "We Will Not Be Stopped"===
{{Plot|date=September 2009}}
The first season of the show marks the entrance of the Hymn of None, an organization resisting the Order. The Hymn of None posts videos and blogs trying to convince Jonas to join the Resistance as their leader. Jonas does not want to put his life or anyone else's life in danger, however, so he refuses. Jonas's friend Sarah, on the other hand, wants to help the Hymn of None fight the Order and urges the community to help convince Jonas.

The Hymn of None posts a video, exposing a company called LifesBlood Labs to be nothing but a sham to get the blood from Trait Positive girls (like the Order).

After the Hymn of None saves Jonas from a run-in with the FBI, a video is posted by the Hymn of None showing security camera footage of a girl who was kidnapped by LifesBlood Labs. A few days later, Jonas decides he will join the Resistance. The Hymn of None ask him to find the Samsarine Doctrine, a book which supposedly holds secrets about the Trait Positive gene. Jonas follows clues that turn out to be fake, and he ends up getting kidnapped by LifesBlood Labs. A community member named Reed films Jonas's kidnapping. Sarah tracks down the people who kidnapped Jonas, and after spraying mace in the kidnapper's faces, gets Jonas out of the trunk and drives away with him. The Hymn of None posts more security camera footage of the girl, showing her suffering, and her attempted escape.

The Hymn of None posts a puzzle leading Jonas and Sarah to the Samsarine Doctrine. Meanwhile, Reed posts a video stating that he is being followed by LifesBlood Labs. Two days later an agent from LifesBlood Labs shows up at Reed's door. Reed makes a narrow escape, and pleads for Jonas and Sarah to help him. Jonas and Sarah ignore Reed and go to get the book. They successfully obtain it, and escape to safety.

The following week Reed, again, pleads for Jonas and Sarah's help. They decide they will let him join them, and go to Chicago to meet up with him.

The group travel east. The Hymn of None posts footage from Willow Wood Auctioneers, an auction house.  The video is about an item for auction that "is thought to contain a cure for a rare blood condition that has afflicted many young people throughout the ages". The video has a puzzle hidden in it, that contains the date and location of the auction.

Jonas, Sarah, and Reed are leaving a hotel when they have another run-in with the FBI. Reed creates a distraction and the three make it away safely. They continue to travel. Days later, the Hymn of None posts a blog saying that one of their agents will be making an appearance in an online video chat. The agent turns out to be Maggie Schaeffer, the trait positive girl from the security camera footage. Reed posts a blog asking Maggie to join the group, and although she rejects the invitation, a few days later (on Halloween) she shows up at Reed's friend's apartment (where the group is staying).

Jonas, Sarah, Reed, and Maggie finally reach Boston. Sarah goes to the auction by herself only to find an anonymous note telling her that LifesBlood Labs has the cure in LA. The group splits up - Sarah and Reed jet off to LA while Maggie and Jonas stay behind. Once the gang is all in LA, however, Jonas and Sarah get themselves arrested by breaking into the LBL HQ by themselves. Maggie claims she is going to keep her distance, but once Reed gets kidnapped, she snaps back into action. Maggie pulls Jonas and Sarah together, and they rescue Reed.

During the "Day of Atonement", the Season One Finale, the group steals important information from the Hymn of One Center and kidnaps a LifesBlood Labs doctor. They tell the HoO and LBL that they will give these things back in exchange for the cure. Meanwhile, the FBI is on the group's tail and gets involved in the mix. Maggie discovers that Sarah is working for the Order and sends Reed off with an address. Maggie goes to save Jonas but ends up getting kidnapped. Sarah then reveals her intentions to Jonas and a few Order goons drag him off as well. Reed goes to the address Maggie gave him, and it's an old friend - Daniel from [[lonelygirl15]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2315">A '''leading actor''', '''leading actress''', '''star''', or simply '''lead''', plays the role of the [[protagonist]] of a film, television show or play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/lead_10 |title=lead noun (ACTOR) - definition in the British English Dictionary &amp; Thesaurus - Cambridge Dictionaries Online |publisher=Dictionary.cambridge.org |date=2014-04-28 |accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''lead'' may also refer to the largest role in the piece and ''leading actor'' may refer to a person who typically plays such parts or an actor with a respected body of work. Some [[actor]]s are [[typecasting (acting)|typecast]] as leads, but most play the lead in some performances and [[supporting actor|supporting]] or [[character actor|character]] roles in others.

Sometimes there is more than one significant leading role in a dramatic piece, and the actors are said to play ''co-leads''; a large [[supporting actor|supporting role]] may be considered a ''secondary lead''. Award nominations for acting often reflect such ambiguities.  Thus, sometimes two actors in the same performance piece are nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] or [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] -- categories traditionally reserved for leads. For example, in 1935 [[Clark Gable]], [[Charles Laughton]] and [[Franchot Tone]] were each nominated for the Best Actor [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for ''[[Mutiny on the Bounty (1935 film)|Mutiny on the Bounty]]''. There can even be controversy over whether a particular performance should be nominated in the Best Actor/Actress or [[Best Supporting Actor]]/[[Best Supporting Actress|Actress]] category.

A [[title role]] is often but not necessarily the lead. A lead role must also be differentiated from a starring role, which means that an actor is credited as a part of the main cast, but not that he necessarily plays the main character.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9289">The following is a list of the '''highest-grossing second weekends for films'''. Usually by the second weekend, studios can have an idea of what the final gross may be now that factors such as word-of-mouth and increased competition are starting to show. Many films usually have big drops as they could be "frontloaded" as fans want to watch them on opening weekend to be first to see it, but some could stay relatively modest as word-of-mouth works in the films' favor. The following shows how much the film has dropped compared to its opening weekend. Like the highest-grossing openings, the list is dominated by recent films due to steadily increasing production and marketing budgets, and modern films opening on more screens. Another contributing factor is inflation not being taken into account.

'''''Meet Boston Blackie''''' is a 1941 crime film starring [[Chester Morris]] as [[Boston Blackie]],&lt;ref name="Mayer2012"/&gt; a notorious, but honorable jewel thief. Although the character had been the hero of a number of silent films, this was the first talking picture. It proved popular enough for [[Columbia Pictures]] to produce a total of 14 [[B movie]]s, all starring Morris.&lt;ref name="Young2010"/&gt;

The Runt was played by Charles Wagenheim; in the subsequent 13 movies, [[George E. Stone]] portrayed him.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/character/ch0138554/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cl_t4&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Plot==
Returning to [[New York City]] from Europe, Boston Blackie (Morris) tries unsuccessfully to strike up a conversation with attractive fellow [[ocean liner]] passenger Marilyn Howard ([[Constance Worth]]). He later rescues her when she is accosted by a man. However, when he tries to follow her, he runs into his friendly nemesis, police Inspector Faraday ([[Richard Lane (actor)|Richard Lane]]), who wants to take him in on suspicion of stealing some pearls. Knowing that Blackie's word is good (and that handcuffs are useless against him), Faraday merely confiscates his landing card.

However, when Blackie discovers the body of the man who had bothered Marilyn Howard deposited in his suite, he has to break his word and debark to clear his name. He trails Howard to the [[Coney Island]] amusement park. She has been followed by two men and is struck by a poisoned dart. Before dying, she tells him enough to send him to the Mechanical Man (Michael Rand), a [[Midway (fair)|midway]] performer whose act is pretending to be a robot or [[automaton]]. Soon after, the two killers show up to report to their boss, the Mechanical Man, forcing Blackie to flee once again.

He hijacks the car belonging to Cecilia Bradley ([[Rochelle Hudson]]), and manages to lose his pursuers after a high-speed chase. Cecilia decides to help Blackie, despite his attempts to keep her out of his troubles. They learn from a radio news broadcast that Howard was a spy.

Blackie eventually discovers that an espionage ring led by the Mechanical Man is trying to take a stolen navy bombsight out of the country. Faraday and his men follow Blackie to the midway to arrest him and prove handy in apprehending the spies. As a reward, Faraday decides to forget about the evidence linking Blackie to the theft of the pearls.

{{DISPLAYTITLE:Music of ''Star Wars''}}
[[File:John Williams tux.jpg|thumb|[[John Williams]], composer of the music of all eight ''Star Wars'' saga films.]]
The '''music of the ''Star Wars'' franchise''' is composed and produced in conjunction with the development of the feature films, television series, and other merchandise within the [[epic film|epic]] [[space opera]] franchise created by [[George Lucas]]. The music for the primary feature films (which serves as the basis for the rest of the related media) was written by [[John Williams]]. Williams' scores for the eight saga films (and a suite for a spin-off film) count among the most widely known and popular contributions to modern [[film music]], and utilize a symphony orchestra and features an assortment of about fifty recurring musical themes to represent characters and other plot elements: one of the largest caches of themes in the history of film music.

Released between 1977 and 2017, the music for the primary feature films was, in the case of the first two trilogies, performed by the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] and, in select passages, by the [[London Voices]] chorus. Williams also scored the seventh and eighth episodes in the franchise's [[Star Wars sequel trilogy|sequel trilogy]], and he is currently slated to score the ninth (and last) episode as well. The sequel trilogy was largely conducted by Williams and [[William Ross (composer)|William Ross]], and performed by the [[Hollywood Studio Symphony|Hollywood Freelance Studio Symphony]] and (in a few passages) by the [[Los Angeles Master Chorale]].

Additional composers have since contributed music to ''Star Wars.'' The music for several animated television series spin-offs has been written by [[Kevin Kiner]] and [[Ryan Shore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.starwars.com/news/5-highlights-from-star-wars-forces-of-destiny-the-padawan-path|title=5 Highlights from Star Wars Forces of Destiny: "The Padawan Path" {{!}} StarWars.com|date=2017-07-06|work=StarWars.com|access-date=2017-08-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Music for the spin-off films, other television programs, and video games, as well as the trailers of the various installments, were created by various other composers, with this material occasionally revisiting some of Williams' principal themes, and – with the latest spin-off film, with Williams actually writing a new theme for the composer to use. [[Michael Giacchino]] was the composer of the first Anthology film, ''[[Rogue One]]'', while [[John Powell (film composer)|John Powell]] scored the second film, ''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story|Solo]].''

The scores are primarily performed by a symphony orchestra of varying size joined, in several sections, by a choir of varying size.&lt;ref&gt;Williams generally uses the choir for texture, as humming or wordless voices. Several sections rely on repeated syllables in Sanskrit, as is the case of Duel of the Fates or Snoke's theme.

While the syllables are drawn from (loosely) translated texts such as Cad Goddeu or the writing of Kipling, Williams typically arranges them by ear and without heed to their meaning, so the choral text remains repetitive and meaningless.

In other instances, the choir repeats a short albeit coherent sentence, such as with the Funeral theme or Anakin's Dark Deeds.
&lt;/ref&gt; They each make extensive use of the ''[[leitmotif]]'', or a series of musical themes that represents the various characters, objects and events in the films. Throughout all of the franchise, which consists of a total of over 18 hours of music,&lt;ref&gt;Including all the alternate takes of the recording, Williams has recorded about 21 hours of music for the series, although much of it remains unreleased.&lt;/ref&gt; Williams has written approximately fifty themes in one of the largest, richest collection of themes in the history of film music.

===Television===
[[Kevin Kiner]] composed the score to the film ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (film)|Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]'' (2008), the predecessor to the [[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|animated TV series of the same name]]. Both properties loosely use some of the original themes and music by [[John Williams]]. Kiner's own material for the film includes a theme for Anakin Skywalker's Padawan learner, [[Ahsoka Tano]], as well as a theme for Jabba the Hutt's uncle Ziro. Kiner went on to score the TV series' entire six seasons, which concluded in 2014. A soundtrack album was released that same year by [[Walt Disney Records]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=‘Star Wars: The Clone Wars’ TV Series Soundtrack Announced|url=http://filmmusicreporter.com/2014/11/04/star-wars-the-clone-wars-tv-series-soundtrack-announced/|website=Film Music Reporter|accessdate=December 23, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151223205023/http://filmmusicreporter.com/2014/11/04/star-wars-the-clone-wars-tv-series-soundtrack-announced/|archivedate=December 23, 2015|date=November 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kiner continued his work with the franchise for the animated series ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]'' (2014), which also incorporates Williams' themes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kevin Kiner to Score ‘Star Wars Rebels’|url=http://filmmusicreporter.com/2014/04/21/kevin-kiner-to-score-star-wars-rebels/|website=Film Music Reporter|accessdate=December 23, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151223203927/http://filmmusicreporter.com/2014/04/21/kevin-kiner-to-score-star-wars-rebels/|archivedate=December 23, 2015|date=April 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inspiration ===
The scores utilize an eclectic variety of musical styles, many culled from the Late [[Romantic music|Romantic]] idiom of [[Richard Strauss]] and his contemporaries that itself was incorporated into the [[Cinema of the United States|Golden Age Hollywood]] scores of [[Erich Korngold]] and [[Max Steiner]]. The reasons for this are known to involve George Lucas's desire to allude to the underlying fantasy element of the narrative rather than the science-fiction setting, as well as to ground the otherwise strange and fantastic setting in well-known, audience-accessible music. Indeed, Lucas maintains that much of the films' success relies not on advanced visual effects, but on the simple, direct emotional appeal of its plot, characters and, importantly, music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmmusicsociety.org/news_events/features/2012/020812.html|title=Spielberg and Lucas on Williams: Directors reminisce about collaborating with Hollywood's greatest composer|last1=Burlingame|first1=Jon|date=February 8, 2012|website=[[The Film Music Society]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151223055247/http://www.filmmusicsociety.org/news_events/features/2012/020812.html|archivedate=December 23, 2015|accessdate=December 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lucas originally wanted to use tracked orchestral and film music in a similar manner to [[2001: A Space Odyssey (soundtrack)|''2001: A Space Odyssey'']], itself a major inspiration for ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]''. Williams, however, advised to form a soundtrack with recurring musical themes to augment the story, while Lucas's choice of music could be used as a temporary track for Williams to base his musical choices on. This resulted in several nods or homages to the music of [[Gustav Holst]], [[William Walton]], [[Sergei Prokofiev]] and [[Igor Stravinsky]] in the score to ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]].''&lt;ref&gt;That particular score was first intended to be tracked with existing music from the classical repertoire or from older film scores, as was the case of [[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]], which inspired George Lucas to write the film. After Williams convinced Lucas to have an original score (which would excel a tracked score in that it will have set themes for characters, Williams argued), those musical pieces were used as a temp track and Williams followed them closely, turning portions of the score into an homage to earlier film score and to romantic music in general.&lt;/ref&gt;  Williams relied less and less on references to existing music in the latter seven scores, incorporating more strains of [[modernism (music)|modernist]] orchestral writing with each progressive score, although occasional nods continue to permeate the music. The love theme from [[The Empire Strikes Back (soundtrack)|''Empire Strikes Back'']] is closely related to Williams' composition for [[Raiders of the Lost Ark (soundtrack)|''Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark'']].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The score to [[Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith|''Revenge of the Sith'']] has clear resemblances to the successful scores of other contemporary composers of the time, namely [[Howard Shore]]'s [[Music of The Lord of the Rings film series|''Lord of the Rings'']], [[Hans Zimmer]]'s [[Gladiator (soundtrack)|''Gladiator'']] and [[Tan Dun]]'s'' [[Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (soundtrack)|Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon]]'', with which the movie was most likely scored temporarily.&lt;ref&gt;These inspirations are evident in some of the orchestration choices, including the wide use of a SATB choir and boy choir and even a soloist (including a moaning woman in "Padme's Ruminations", similar to Lisa Gerard's vocal work in Gladiator). The orchestra was augmented with a second set of timpani as was the case with Shore's Lord of the Rings scores, and with taiko drums, which have been used extensively by Shore and Zimmer.
In particular, Anakin's Dark Deeds with the humming boy choir opening leading into a Gothic piece for an adult choir, is evocative of "The Treason of Isengard". Several tracks, including the music to the opening of the film, evoke the rhythmic music of the Orcs.

&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise, however, his later scores were mostly tracked with music of his own composition,&lt;ref name=":40"&gt;http://www.musicweb-international.com/film/jwilliamsinterview.html&lt;/ref&gt; mainly from previous ''Star Wars'' films.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://audioboom.com/posts/6557819-episode-69-rian-johnson-on-the-music-of-star-wars-other-movies|title=Episode 69: Rian Johnson On The Music Of Star Wars &amp; Other Movies|work=audioBoom|access-date=2018-01-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, In Williams' score to ''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi|The Last Jedi]]'' he, for the first time in the series, went so as far as to incorporate direct quotes of other compositions, namely "[[Aquarela do Brasil|Aquarela Do Brasil]]" by [[Ary Barroso]] (in a nod to the 1985 [[Terry Gilliam]] film ''[[Brazil (1985 film)|Brazil]]'') and from his own theme for [[The Long Goodbye (film)|''The Long Goodbye'']] (co-composed by [[Johnny Mercer]]).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2527336/soundtrack?ref_=tt_trv_snd&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Williams also started to develop his style throughout the various films, incorporating other instruments, unusual orchestral set-ups (as well as various choral ensembles) and even electronic or electronically attenuated music as the films progressed. Williams often composed the music in a heroic but tongue-in-cheek style, and has described the scored film as a "musical".&lt;ref&gt;Star Wars, [http://www.jw-collection.de/scores/swlp.htm liner notes].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Structure ===
''Star Wars'' was one of the film scores that heralded the revival of grand symphonic scores in the late 1970s.  One technique that particularly influenced these scores is Williams' use of the ''[[leitmotif]]'', which was most famously associated with the operas of [[Richard Wagner]] and, in early film scores, with Steiner. A leitmotif is a phrase or melodic cell that signifies a character, place, plot element, mood, idea, relationship or other specific part of the film. It is commonly used in modern film scoring as a device for mentally anchoring certain parts of a film to the soundtrack.&lt;ref&gt;It should be noted that using a leitmotifs merely as a "stand-in" for a character would be a devolved form of using leitmotifs, compared to the operatic practice. A theme can be used symbolically, such as hinting at Darth Vader's theme when the decision to train Anakin is made in Episode I.&lt;/ref&gt; Of chief importance for a leitmotif is that it must be strong enough for a listener to latch onto while being flexible enough to undergo variation and development along the progression of the story. The more varied and nuanced the use of leitmotif is, the more memorable it typically becomes. A good example of this is the way in which Williams subtly conceals the intervals of "[[The Imperial March]]" within "Anakin's Theme" in ''[[Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace (soundtrack)|The Phantom Menace]]'', implying his dark future to come.

Also important is the density in which leitmotifs are used: the more leitmotifs are used in a piece of a given length, the more thematically rich it is considered to be. Film music, however, typically needs to strike a balance between in terms of the number of leitmotives used, so as to not become too dense for the audience (being preoccupied with the visuals) to follow. Williams' music of ''Star Wars'' is unique in that it is relatively dense for film scoring, with approximately 11 themes used in each two-hour film, of which about 90% is scored.&lt;ref&gt;Williams full score often slightly overtakes the length of the film due to the recording of concert suites and several alternate takes. However, the amount of music written for the film proper varies from 80 percent, to scoring effectively the entire film. The finished film is always subjected to tracking, looping and muting (especially Attack of the Clones), so about 85% of each finished film is scored.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Performance ===
Williams re-recorded some of his suites from the first trilogy with the Skywalker Symphony Orchestra as an album. Several of his later themes were released as singles and music videos,  and were later released a collection of suites from the six films as a compilation that played to a series of clips from the films, with sparse dialogue and sound effects. These became the basis for a series of hour-long concerts which featured ''Star Wars'' music to images from the films, ''[[Star Wars: In Concert]]'', which took place in 2009 and 2010. First performed in [[London]], it went on to tour across the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], last playing in London, Ontario, Canada on July 25, 2010.

The scores of the first trilogy (in the form of its Blu-Ray Special Edition release) and ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens (soundtrack)|The Force Awakens]]'' are performed as Live to Projection concerts, but with greatly reduced forces. The performances follow the music of the finished film, with some of the music looped, tracked or omitted entirely, and do not feature any of the diegetic pieces and often omit the choral parts.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.playbill.com/article/five-time-oscar-winner-john-williams-talks-bringing-star-wars-scores-to-the-new-york-philharmonic&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;http://www.jwfan.com/forums/index.php?/topic/27124-star-wars-live-to-projection-concerts-begins-september-2017-david-newman-conducting-new-york-philharmonic/&amp;page=4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Orchestration==
John Williams sketched the score for his various orchestrations and wrote the music for a full symphony orchestra (ranging from 79 to 113 players overall&lt;ref&gt;Episode III required 109 players (not including the conductor) due to expanded string and percussion sections. http://www.jw-collection.de/scores/epi3_stuff.htm

http://soundtrackfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/John-Williams-London-Symphony-Orchestra-Star-Wars.jpg

''The Empire Strikes Back'' required 104 players, not including the conductor or synthesizer ([http://www.jw-collection.de/scores/tesblp.htm rhttp://www.jw-collection.de/scores/tesblp.htmecalls]) due to the inclusion of a fourth flute, and sections that required a third harp, five oboes overall, an added piccolo and eight percussionists overall.

If the Empire Strikes Back is to augmented with the string section size of Revenge of the Sith or the Skwalker Symphony Recording, it would require about 112 players and a small women choir.

A Star Wars in Concert production that would follow the orchestration of the recording, would have to feature some of the expansions of the various episodes, requiring about 110 players, as well as the mixed choir and possibly the bass choir.
&lt;/ref&gt;) and, in several passages, chorus (ranging from 12 to 120 singers overall) and a few non-orchestral instruments. The orchestration is not consistent throughout the different films,&lt;ref&gt;Star Wars and the sequel trilogy film use an 84-piece arrangement, with the latter also incorporating a 24-piece men choir. Empire Strikes Back uses 106 pieces and about ten women vocalists, Return of the Jedi uses a 100-piece orchestra, about ten men, and a few women for the Special Edition; The Phantom Menace uses a 100-piece orchestra, 88-piece SATB choir and 30 boys; Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith use a 112-piece orchestra, 89-piece SATB choir and a synthesized boy choir.&lt;/ref&gt; but generally the score makes use of a considerable brass section over a comparatively smaller string section, giving the series its heraldic, brassy sound.

Several of the scores require larger forces, including a large (over 100-piece) romantic-period orchestra, a mixed choir and even a boy choir, although none of the scores call for particularly immense forces compared to larger film or theater works.&lt;ref&gt;Star Wars Concerts were held with as few as 130 performers, and some Live to Projection Concerts can therefore by played by as few as sixty players. By comparison, each of Howard Shore's [[Music of The Lord of the Rings film series#Instrumentation|Middle Earth scores]] require a minimum of 230 musicians to stage (ranging to as many as 500), and several stage works such as [[Gurre-Lieder#Instrumentation|Gurre Lieder]] or [[Symphony No. 8 (Mahler)#Instrumental and vocal forces|Mahler's Eighth Symphony]] can range from 300 to over a thousand musicians.

Nevertheless, amateur performances (like the NJYS Playathon) of Williams score, among other film scores (including the aforementioned Howard Shore ones) have utilized orchestral forces of 450-piece or more.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, due to added high woodwinds and percussion parts, scores such as Empire Strikes Back and Attack of the Clones call for 106 and 110 players, respectively. The former called for a third harp and fourth bassoon, while the latter (and all prequel scores) utilized a fuller string section. Revenge of the Sith also utilized a second set of timpani. Comparatively, the original ''Star Wars'' trilogy and the sequel trilogy films call for much smaller forces of as little as 82 players, and small choral accompaniment in select cues.&lt;ref&gt;The Last Jedi used 101 instrumental players (including the diegetic band), probably a result of added percussion and high woodwind players, a 65-piece SATB choir, and a few additional pieces for the all-male choir.&lt;/ref&gt; The first spin off film, ''Rogue One'', followed the prequel trilogy's instrumentation, using a 110-piece orchestra and 90-piece mixed choir.

In live performances, the forces are usually greatly reduced: Official [[Star Wars: In Concert|Star Wars Concerts]] were held with as little as 60-piece orchestras and 50-piece mixed choral ensembles or with the choir omitted altogether.&lt;ref&gt;Keyes, Allison (July 24, 2010). [https://web.archive.org/web/20151230163343/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=128731971 "'Star Wars In Concert' Puts The Force In The Music"]. ''[[NPR]]''.

The Live to Projection presentations also feature various reductions, namely in the brass section, in line with Williams' reduced orchestration for his "Star Wars Suite", and generally omit the unusual orchestrations of Empire Strikes Back and synthesize or remove the choral parts The roster is between 50 and 90 pieces.

&lt;/ref&gt; However, to recreate the eight scores as they were originally recorded, the following instrumentation is required:

* Woodwinds: 3 flutes (doubling on piccolos and an alto flute), 2 oboes (doubling on a cor anglais), 3 clarinets (doubling on a bass clarinet and a E-flat clarinet), 2 bassoons (doubling on a contrabassoon).
* Brass: 6 horns (doubling on Wagner Tubas&lt;ref&gt;Empire Strikes Back only.&lt;/ref&gt;), 4 trumpets, 3 tenor trombones, bass tuba.
* Keyboards: Piano, celesta, synthesizer.&lt;ref&gt;''Star Wars'' featured one player on a piano and a second player on celesta. The second player also doubles on Electric Piano. For select sections of ''Empire Strikes Back'', both played on pianos. The scores also used synthesizers for electronic sounds and to mimic the Celesta (a real Celesta was not used since ''Return of the Jedi'') and the Harpsichord (for ''Return of the Jedi'' and ''Attack of the Clones''). In the Skywalker Symphony recording, one player doubles on all keyboards. From ''Attack of the Clones'' going forward, the synth is performed by the electric keyboard player.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Timpani: 4–6 kettledrums.

* Strings: 2 harps, 14 first violins, 12 second violins, 10 violas, 10 violoncellos, 6 double basses.
* Additional instruments: 1 piccolo, 1 flute, 1–2 recorders, 2 oboes, 1 clarinet, 3 saxophones, 1–2 bassoons,&lt;ref&gt;''Star Wars'' uses the original arrangement, but its two sequels call for an additional of one of each woodwind. The prequel trilogy scores use three flutes, oboes and bassons, as well as four clarinets, and the sequel trilogy scores omit the fourth clarinet part. Sections of Empire Strikes Back, Attack of the Clones, Revenge of the Sith and The Last Jedi call for expanded higher woodwind: four flutes and an added piccolo part and five oboes. The former score also calls for a fourth bassoon for Boba Fett's motif. ''Return of the Jedi'' and The Phantom Menace also feature recorders. Star Wars and The Last Jedi use three saxophones, as well.&lt;/ref&gt; 2 horns, trump&lt;nowiki/&gt;et, bass trombone, tuba,&lt;ref&gt;Up to the sequel trilogy, Star Wars scores had utilized eight horns and two tubas, although the Skywalker Symphony recording omits those parts and adds a fifth trumpet. The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones also omit the second tuba.&lt;/ref&gt; set of timpani, five percussion&lt;nowiki/&gt;ists,&lt;ref&gt;In Empire Strikes Back, Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith. A second set of timpani is used in the former, and in The Last Jedi.&lt;/ref&gt; 89-piece SATB choir, 10 basso profundo singers, 30 boys, 1 Tibetan throat singer,&lt;ref&gt;The full SATB choir is used for the prequels: The Last Jedi only requires a 64-piece Tibetan Throat chanting is used in Revenge of the Sith. The boy choir is used in The Phantom Menace but synthesized in the later two scores. Empire Strikes Back uses a small women choir and Return of the Jedi uses a small male choir. The Force Awakens uses a 24-piece basso profundo orchestra, which is about ten more pieces than would be in a 90-piece SATB choir.&lt;/ref&gt; narrator,&lt;ref&gt;For [[Star Wars: In Concert]].&lt;/ref&gt; 4 violins divided, 2 violas, 2 contrabasses, 1 harp.&lt;ref&gt;Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi call for two added contrabass parts, and the former also calls for a third harp. The Skywalker Symphony uses a fuller string section, but omits the second harp. The prequels also use the fuller string section.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Non-orchestral instruments: [[Cretan lyra|Cretan Lyra]] and [[cümbüş|cümbü]][[cümbüş|ş]] (I), [[electric guitar]] (II), [[toy piano]] (VI), [[Kazoo|kazzo]], highland bagpipes, didgeridoo (VIII).&lt;ref&gt;Williams is not usually keen to stray far from the orchestral instrumentation. The Cretan Lyra and Cumbus are used briefly for diegetic Tatooine music for ''Phantom Menace'' and ''Attack of the Clones'', composed by his son, Joseph, and were originally played by one instrumentalist. Williams also [https://web.archive.org/web/19991013020724/http://starwars.talkcity.com/starwars/trans/5-6-99.htmpl recalls] "reed flutes" (most likely referring to the [[ney]] flute) used in the score, probably for those cues. The prequel scores aren't performed live, but seeing as diegetic pieces are not played even in the scores that are performed live, these would probably be omitted unde such circumstances, as well.
The Electric Guitar is used in small inserts during the chase through Curoscant in ''Attack of the Clones'' (albeit muted in the film on the request of George Lucas). Williams also used three saxophones for the Cantina Band, although those could be doubled by the clarinet players. He also once claimed to have used Kazoos in that sequence, although the liner notes make no mention of it.
Didgeridoos are used in the diegetic Caretaker party music, which scores a deleted scene. They are also featured in The Phantom Menace ultimate edition release, where they were originally used as diegetic sound effects, and layered over the soundtrack.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musical themes in &lt;nowiki/&gt;the scores==
John Williams wrote a series of themes and motifs for certain characters and ideas in each of the ''Star Wars'' films. The multiple installments allowed Williams to compose some fifty themes (and counting) and reprise some of them extensively, continually developing them over a long period of screen time.

Williams introduced a few themes in each episode (six themes on average) and focused on making each of his p&lt;nowiki/&gt;rincipal themes long-lined and melodically distinct from the others so as to increase their memorability. Williams occasionally forges small connections between some of these themes, sometimes for a narrative purpose and sometimes in the more general favor of cohesion. This technique allowed him (especially in his scores to the first trilogy) to have each theme play out for a large number of occasions (the Force Theme plays over one hundred times in the series) and over long periods of time.

Each score can be said to have a "main theme", which is developed and repeated frequently throughout the film, often to unusual extents (such as the frequency in which The Imperial March is revisited during ''Empire Strikes Back'').&lt;ref&gt;the theme recurs thirty times or more in a two-hour film.&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the main theme and a handful of other principal themes, Williams forged several smaller motifs for each episode, which are generally not as memorable and at times interchangeable. A main theme for the franchise exists as well (which is the music of the main titles), but a main theme does not exist to represent a particular trilogy. Instead, each trilogy (and to a lesser extent, each film) has its own style or soundscape.&lt;ref&gt;The scores to the original three films are melodic and romantic, as is – largely – the score to The Phantom Menace. However, Episodes II and even III feature much more rhythmic music, and Revenge of the Sith in particular is more operatic in its use of choir and even solo vocals.

The sequel scores feature another evolution of Williams' musical style, which is less obtrusive, with more lilting musical themes like Rey's theme, reminiscent of some of Williams' work on Harry Potter.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Williams' Star Wars catalog remains one of the largest collections of leitmotifs in the history of cinema,&lt;ref&gt;Williams themes for Star Wars have been classified based on Williams own comments on the LP release, Mike Matessino's Special Edition Liner notes, and further analyses provided by Doug Adams, John Takis ''et al.'' On FilmScoreMonthly. Anchiliary sources include Frank Lehman's "Complete Catalogue of the Motivic Material in Star Wars", which includes a lot of "incidental motifs" including stylistic gestures and tracked material; Karol Krok's [http://filmsonwax.thedigitalfix.com/the-themes-of-star-wars-episode-2-the-prequel-trilogy/ FilmsonWax]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} thematic catalogue, and an overly-inclusive timpestamp list by [http://www.jwfan.com/forums/index.php?/topic/25879-the-thematic-material-of-the-star-wars-saga-possible-community-project/ Faleel] from the John Williams Fans board.&lt;/ref&gt; although – for comparison – it still falls short of Wagner's use of leitmotifs in the ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen|Ring Cycle]]'' or even [[Howard Shore]]'s work on the [[Music of The Hobbit film series|''Hobbit'']] and [[Music of The Lord of the Rings film series|''Lord of the Rings'']] films.&lt;ref&gt;Williams wrote some fifty themes for over 19 hours of cinema, with an average of six new themes per film and an average 12 themes used in each film overall. By comparison, Howard Shore wrote over 160 leitmotifs for 21 hours of cinema in the Middle Earth films, of which he uses 40 or more in each film. Richard Wagner wrote 176 leitmotifs for the 15-hour Ring cycle.
&lt;/ref&gt; Both works feature many more themes for a similar or shorter running time; and use the themes more clearly and with more nuance, where Williams prefers to write fewer themes (to allow him to focus on them better) and use them in a more straightforward manner and sometimes, solely for their romantic effect. Shore and Wagner's themes are also inter-related and arranged into sets of subsets of related themes through various melodic or harmonic connections, whereas Williams prefers greater distinction between his themes.&lt;ref&gt;In thematic works such as those of Wagner or Shore, all the leitmotifs which are thematically connected (e.g. all of Alberich's themes or all of the Hobbits' themes) are connected in melody, harmony, key and orchestration, so as to create a sets and subsets of inter-connected thematic "families." This allows the composer to introduce new themes later in the work while having the new theme evoke associations which the audience already felt towards existing related themes.

Williams' various themes do share certain connections, but they are basic enough as to nullify any attempts to categorize them except in the broadest of strokes, such as themes for the protagonists and themes for the antagonists.
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Romantic application of Leitmotifs in the score ===
Williams' use of his themes in ''Star Wars'' is at times romantic rather than strictly thematic,&lt;ref&gt;Using leitmotifs as a suggestion of mood or emotion rather than as themes, is a common practice for all composers in symphonies, operas and especially in film. Nevertheless, classical and romantic composers (and even some film composers like [[Howard Shore]] in his [[Music of The Lord of the Rings film series|Lord of the Rings]] and [[Music of The Hobbit film series|Hobbit]] cycle) are generally much more strict with the application of leitmotif than Williams.
&lt;/ref&gt; the themes sometimes being used randomly because their mood fits a certain scene, rather than for a narrative purpose. For instance, the theme for [[Luke Skywalker]] is also used as the main theme for the entire franchise, as well as a generic "heroic theme" in conjunction with various characters without any connection to its namesake. [[Princess Leia's Theme]] is used for the death of [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] in the original ''Star Wars'', which has little to do with her character even though she is present in the scene.&lt;ref&gt;Since the princess is present at Ben's death, her theme is said to "''represents Luke's and the Princess' reaction to leaving Ben behind''" (Star Wars, [http://www.jw-collection.de/scores/swlp.htm Liner Notes]) although the romantic explanation has been favored by Adams and Michael Matessimo, the author of the [http://mahawa.jw-music.net/scores/swse.htm special edition liner notes].&lt;/ref&gt; Yoda's Theme appears several times during the Cloud City sequences in ''The Empire Strikes Back''.&lt;ref&gt;Yoda's theme in Cloud City is said to denote Luke gaining courage as he "remembers Yoda's teachings and tries to apply them in this", but the theme is later used in relation to Leia's attempt at retrieving Han and even Lando's order to evacuate Cloud City, giving more weight to the outright dramatic explanation.&lt;/ref&gt; The concert piece [[Duel of the Fates]] is used several times throughout the prequel trilogy, appearing over the entire final battle in ''The Phantom Menace'' (as opposed to just the lightsaber duel for which it was written); [[Anakin Skywalker]]'s search for his mother in ''Attack of the Clones'';&lt;ref&gt;Duel of the Fates as used in Tatooine, was often interpreted as signifying the internal struggle of Anakin, although no other occurrence of the theme is consistent with that line of thought. In fact, the internal struggle only presents itself in the next scene, where the theme is not used.
&lt;/ref&gt; and the unrelated Yoda and [[Darth Sidious]]'s duel in ''Revenge of the Sith.'' Williams' original composition for the Geonosis Battle Arena in ''Attack of the Clones,'' a variation on the Droid Army March, was used for the Utapau assault in ''Revenge of the Sith''. Multiple uses of the Force Theme are also non-thematic.&lt;ref&gt;In ''Star Wars'', the theme was conceived and used more as a theme for the character of Ben Kenobi rather than as a theme for ''The Force'' itself. Therefore, Williams originally did not have it play during the Binary Sunset sequence (which has nothing to do with Ben), and only did so on the request of George Lucas. He did use it, however, for the Throne Room sequence, although it has little to do with Ben.

Since the theme became more associated with The Force in following installments, it was used more often, but sometimes against images that do not evoke the idea of The Force such as numerous wide shots in ''Attack of the Clones'', e.g. Anakin and Padme departing for Naboo, Dooku arriving at Curoscant. Its also used during wide shots of the Battle of Hoth for no discernable reason.
&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rebel Fanfare is applied to the [[Millennium Falcon]] throughout the original ''Star Wars'', ''The Force Awakens'', and ''The Last Jedi''. It is also used for R2-D2's heroics during the opening action scene in ''Revenge of the Sith''. Kylo Ren's secondary theme, meant to evoke his more conflicted side, but since he quickly makes his allegiances clear, its generally used in tandem with his fanfare to evoke his menace, instead.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Doug Adams, [http://www.filmscoremonthly.com/backissues/viewissue.cfm?issueID=32 ''Sounds of the Empire: Analysing the themes of the Star Wars Trilogy''], in: ''Film Score Monthly'' (Volume 4, number 5), pp. 22–47.
&lt;/ref&gt; The Emperor's theme is used in ''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi|The Last Jedi]]'' when Supreme Leader Snoke tortures Rey. Even the melodic connections between some of the themes sometimes do not represent a straightforward dramatic purpose, such as the connection of "Across the Stars" to [[Count Dooku]]'s motif and the Battle of Geonosis in ''Attack of the Clones''. In fact, Some of Williams' themes are written from the outset purely to convey a certain mood rather than evoke a character or setting, such as the Throne Room music of the original ''Star Wars'' or the Pursuit motif from ''The Force Awakens''.

Some of this music was re-tracked into other parts of the film, or even another film in the series, by the filmmakers. ''Attack of the Clones'', the first film to be shot digitally, had major edits made after the scoring process, leading to the inclusion of tracked music over many of the digitally created sequences such as the Droid Factory on Geonosis or the Clone Army's arrival to the battle. These scenes used music such as Yoda's theme or incidental music from ''The Phantom Menace'' with little dramatic connection to what is occurring on screen. In the original ''Star Wars'', some of the music for the Death Star's Trash Compactor scene was used over an extended shot of the arrival into Mos Eisley inserted in the film's Special Edition. Musical similarities exist between the final scenes of ''The Phantom Menace'' with Finn's confession to Rey in ''The Force Awakens'', probably a result of temp-track choice.&lt;ref&gt;It should be said, however, that ''some'' of the music in the later films was always intended to be acquired through tracking of pre-existing material, and that some of the tracking choices are very deliberate.&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases, the material wasn't tracked but rather lifted from the original composition and re-recorded, such as in the big action scenes of Return of the Jedi, both of which lift material from the Battle of Yavin and Ben's death.

Other composers for the franchise used Williams' principal themes in their own compositions, whether it be for the trailers to the main films, spin-off films, television series, or video games. More often than not, these composers also use the principal themes more for their emotional effect for their respective projects. [[Michael Giacchino]], for instance, uses the Force Theme in some of the scenes where Rogue One's Starship takes off.

=== Thematic inconsistencies between installments ===
Because Williams scores one episode at a time&lt;ref&gt;Hence, claims that Williams conceives his themes with foresight and subsequent attempts to draw tenuous connections between such pieces of music as Snoke's theme and the drone in Palpatine's Teachings, are dubious.

In fact, Williams himself always notes that he only scores the film by watching the finished film, rather than reading a story outline or script. He, for instance, claimed to have had no idea that his score to the original Star Wars would result in sequels and further scores, and even shared the fact that he had, at the time, written a love theme for Luke and Leia, only to discover by Return of the Jedi that the two have been now written to be Brother and Sister.
&lt;/ref&gt; and attempts to base each score on new material as much as possible, the musical material does not have a particularly cohesive structure as a whole: the themes for each score are only devised during each film's post-production, so Williams will often come up with a new theme that, in hindsight, would have been preferably introduced, at least in embryonic form, in a previous score: This can be said for the love theme "Across the Stars" (for [[Anakin Skywalker]] and [[Padmé Amidala]]), introduced only in "Attack of the Clones"&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; or even "The Imperial March", introduced in ''The Empire Strikes Back''. The same can be said about some themes only composed for the prequels (such as Duel of the Fates), which would have been perfectly applicable to the films in the first trilogy, had they been produced in the narrative order. In fact, since the prequels featured both their own stock of leitmotifs and recurring themes from the previous films, they boasted a larger catalog of themes, whereas the use of the leitmotifs in a cycle of works typically involves increasing density towards the later installments in the narrative order. Also, the themes in the prequels appear in shorter, blockier statements and the motives themselves are often short, rhythmic ideas, as opposed to longer melodies used in the first trilogy. Also, in the prequels the motives are often associated with places and events, rather than with characters as they are in the rest of the scores, creating a further discrepancy in the musical narrative.

Even within each trilogy, Williams often abandons a motif after a single score or two (as he did with Anakin's theme), writes (across several films) multiple motifs that serve a similar function (e.g. the Rebel fanfare, the Throne Room March and the Triumph Fanfare in ''Return of the Jedi''), or writes a motif that he only uses in one installment, such as the Droid motif. In other cases, a motif is supplanted by a new one, as the Imperial March replaced the original, Imperial motif – a problem only confounded when he returned to that theme with the prequels, only for it to disappear entirely for what is now supposed to be the fourth episode; sometimes, the existing motif simply changes its thematic meaning: Ben Kenobi's theme turned into a theme for the Force by ''The Empire Strikes Back'', and Luke's theme – into the "Star Wars theme".

''The Last Jedi'', specifically, departs from Williams method of relying primarily on new thematic material, and instead relies heavily on pre-existing themes, in keeping with Johnson's temp-track choices. As a result, a number of themes and motifs from the previous films are constantly repeated, often in very familiar settings, such as statements of Yoda's and Leia's theme that are lifted from the concert arrangements, a reprise of the Binary Sunset rendition of the Force theme, and recurring statements of Rey's and Kylo's themes. There are some incidental phrases similar to existing themes such as Battle of the Heroes, The Immolation scene, et cetera, and some deliberate, tongue-in-cheek references, such as a quote of the Death Star motif for a scene with a clothes iron that is shot to look like a landing Star Destroyer.

Listed below are as 51 recurring themes or leitmotifs, of which about 49 leitmotifs are clearly identified in Williams' scores;&lt;ref&gt;Relative to the number of installments and length of the scores, this figure is consistent with Williams output to such series as Indiana Jones and [https://www.jwfan.com/?p=3563 Harry Potter]. Its also consistent with the figures arrived at by Lehman (who puts the number of leitmotifs in the series at 57) and Adams (which puts the number of the first four films at as many as 33). Williams himself, as he was making Attack of the Clones, assesed the size of his glossary at "20 themes". https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/movies/2001-11-13-john-williams-star-wars.htm&lt;/ref&gt; as well as two leitmotifs written by Williams for John Powell's upcoming score to ''Solo'' (see Themes in the Anthology films: ''Solo''). Williams is expected to expand upon this catalog further in his upcoming composition to ''Episode IX''. Whether that score will merit as many themes as his most sparse efforts (''The Last Jedi'' at three themes), his most dense (''The Force Awakens'' with eight) or in-line with his average (six themes), Williams will have written between 54 and 60 themes for the series.

** "Across the Stars secondary theme"&lt;ref&gt;This secondary phrase of Across the Stars also includes an end-cap figure of "brooding rhythms" (as [http://www.filmscoremonthly.com/daily/article.cfm?articleID=3866 Jeff Bonds] call them) based on the Dies Irae figure, looped into an ostinato. The whole section of the theme, which emerges separately to the main phrase, denotes the "angst-ridden side" (to quote John Takis) of the relationship between Anakin and Padme. This theme, and especially the ending figure, transform into the lament theme in Revenge of the Sith. While Williams never spoke of this section as a theme, another telling sign of this theme's dramatic designation in his mind is the video which accompanies it on "Star Wars: A Musical Journey", where the B-phrase and its ending figure both score images that convey the gloomy aspect of the relationship.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jwfan.com/forums/index.php?/topic/25840-analysis-across-the-stars/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jwfan.com"&gt;http://www.jwfan.com/forums/applications/core/interface/file/attachment.php?id=4922&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jwfan.com/forums/index.php?/topic/25840-analysis-across-the-stars/&amp;tab=comments#comment-1196933&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Separatist motif"&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;This motif, otherwise known as the "Conspiracy" or "conflict" motif, represents all the antagonists of the film: namely, Dooku, but also the rest of the separatists, and the bounty hunters Zam Wesell and Jango Fett. It is probably the motif that Williams [http://www.filmtracks.com/titles/attack_clones.html reportedly] was intending to write for Jango when he was composing the piece.
When Jango fights Obi Wan, Williams' derives an ostinato from it which underscores the fight scene. This motif, like the ostinato for "Chase through Curoscant" has been described as a leitmotif, but Takis describes those figures just as ostinati and "rhythmic patterns" and not as outright themes. Doug Adams later [http://jimlochner.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/FSM_TheHeiress.pdf commented] that the various action ostinati of the scores are "shorter, clunkier motives seldom longer than a measure or two, and often more rhythmic than melodic" and calls those passages "episodic." Jeff Bonds adds that this writing is "ultimately fleeting."
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;http://www.filmscoremonthly.com/articles/2005/11_Apr---FSM_Forum_Star_Wars_Episode_III.asp&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williams never commented on this motif, but he tellingly used the very same gesture for Voldemort, the villain in his contemporary score to "Chamber of Secrets", reinforcing the idea that this was his intended "villain" motif.

[http://www.filmscoremonthly.com/articles/2005/11_Apr---FSM_Forum_Star_Wars_Episode_III.asp Adams] also says that the leitmotives in that score were "rhythmic" in nature. While Williams himself has said little of the leitmotives of this score (outside of Across the Stars), Lucas is quoted on the album saying that Williams "heightens the mystery and suspense that drives the first half of the film", most likely referring to this motif, which is indeed confined to the first half of the film.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;This theme is also appearant from the album presentation: Williams having edited the first track specifically to showcase its appearances.

http://cuebycue.blogspot.co.il/2016/04/star-wars-ep-ii-attack-of-clones.html

After the initial Kamino scenes, Williams continues to showcase the motif in a skeletal form - an arpeggiation often considered to be a separate "mystery" motif (although Lehman classifies it an "incidental" figure). This figure is also heavily present in the album.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":51" /&gt;

== Incidental motifs ==
Since neither Williams nor his office ever provided a full list of the leitmotifs used in every ''Star Wars'' film, there is some controversy around the exact number of themes, with some taking an inclusive approach that identifies various leitmotifs, even where the composer probably never intended for,&lt;ref&gt;Such an approach is taken by the programs to the live-to-projection priemerie, which is seemingly not based on new insight from Williams himself.
Such an approach was taken by the [http://www.jwfan.com/forums/index.php?/topic/27124-star-wars-live-to-projection-concerts-begins-september-2017-david-newman-conducting-new-york-philharmonic/&amp;page=4 programs] to the live-to-projection premiere of the Star Wars films, where numerous motifs were identified (seemingly with no new insight from Williams himself), including a rancor motif, a motif for the droids in the original Star Wars, etc... Others to have taken to such an approach are [http://starwarsmusic.pashamusic.com/ Alfred Surenyan] and [https://www.aaronkrerowicz.com/star-wars-blog/a-new-hope-index-of-musical-themes-and-motifs Aaron Krerowicz]. Even [https://www.blogger.com/profile/02790159104500713198 Ed Chang] does this with several minor motifs he attributes to the various Star Wars scores, including a "Imperial rhythmic motif", a " rhythmic Imperial skirmish motif", "exotic Bespin motif", "'one with the Force' motif", "trap theme", a "taking off motif", a secondary Droid march, an Utapau "motoric" motif,  and a "Millennium Falcon rhythmic motif." Also see previous versions of this page.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":51" /&gt; and others taking an exclusive approach.&lt;ref&gt;Doug Adams analysis of the first four scores only includes just about 35 "themes" (with Adams himself casting doubt over some of them), and Frank Lehman's analysis of the entire series contains only 55 leitmotives, in spite of including "retroactively inserted or tracked themes", material that is revisited in Giacchino's Rogue One, and "B-themes[...and]detachable polyphonic subcomponents" but "only when they are heard as detached in the underscore."&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Thematic components and variants ===
One of the key differences between the two approaches in the way in which Williams' main, long themes are approached: some view them as composed of several leitmotives that can appear (for the very least once) in isolation (i.e. in a separate cue) from the unabridged theme, and may even represent a different facet of the plot element or character that the theme stands for,&lt;ref&gt;Such an approach is taken by Frank Lehman. Even Adams does this with the ostinato accompaniment to The Rebe Fanfare (albeit admitting that its "not a theme, per se") and with the B-phrase of Luke's theme, the former due to tracking, and the latter most likely due to certain, fleeting comments made by Williams in a preceding interview. Adams also mentions that components of various themes, such as the ostinato accompaniment of Duel of the Fates or Yoda's playful side, are "used thematically" but doesn't describe them as separate themes, per se, as he does Luke's B-theme, for instance. Aaron Krerowicz also does this with Luke's theme and the Jawa theme, which he describes as no less than three thematic identities. Ed Chung does this with the rhythmic accompaniments to multiple themes, which he describes as "Imperial rhythm motif", "[http://cuebycue.blogspot.co.il/search?q=strikes+back Imperial skirmish motif]", a "[http://cuebycue.blogspot.co.il/2016/04/star-wars-ep-i-phantom-menace-williams.html Droid Army Attack motif]", etc...&lt;/ref&gt; while others see them as a single theme with multiple components, which can appear in fragmented form by use of only one of the said components to suggest the entire theme.

The featured list of themes follows what could be deduced to be Williams own approach: certain pieces are described as two separate themes when they were described as such by Williams and/or appear at least twice in isolation from each other (and usually emerge and develop separately to some extent) and serve a different dramatic purpose altogether. Other pieces such as the ostinato accompaniment and B-section of the Imperial March, the introduction figure to Kylo's secondary theme, to Rey's, or the various components of Duel of the Fates did not merit this treatment, because of lack of evidence to authorial intent on the part of Williams (especially given how seldom, in his body of work, he referred to individual sections of his themes as individual leitmotifs&lt;ref&gt;Outside of Star Wars, the only known instance is the introduction figure to the Superman fanfare. Indiana Jones' theme, the Raiders March, originated as two choices for the theme  to Raiders of the Lost Ark, the latter of the two becoming the bridge to the former (when Spielberg asked to use both), and both serve the same narrarive function. Williams has also made a fleeting comment about Luke's theme B-phrase, and similar comments about the B-theme of "The Adventures of Han" were relayed by John Powell.&lt;/ref&gt;) and/or because they only appear in isolation once and/or lack a defined dramatic purpose distinct from the other parts of the unabridged theme. Its also, largely, the approach taken by Matessino, Adams and Lehman.&lt;ref&gt;Adams does also identify (after the fact) a secondary Ewok theme, although the material in question (which mimics the Ewoks diegetic horn calls) only appears twice in the score, and only once in isolation from the main Ewok theme. All other appearances are not isolated and are part of either the concert arrangement of the Ewok material or a concert version of the film cue in which the piece originally appears. Adams also notes a "Playful Yoda theme" and that the ostinato accompaniment of "Duel of the Fates" is used "thematically" but does not list either of them as separate themes, per se. Lehman identifies both the secondary Ewok theme, the various components of Duel of the Fates and the introduction figures to Rey and Kylo's themes as separate leitmotives.&lt;/ref&gt;

A particularly noteworthy but ultimately incidental instance is the ostinato accompaniment to the Rebel Fanfare: its only used isolated from the fanfare in lifted material that appears in Return of the Jedi. Otherwise, it always precedes and accompanies the Rebel Fanfare, but often again it extends to underpin large sections of on-screen action and the respective material in the original Star Wars. However, since its not really entirely detachable (on more than one instance, that is) from the Rebel Fanfare and never plays at the front of the orchestra, Adams comments that "It’s not a theme per se" and Lehman makes no note of it, even as an incidental motif.

Certain analysts will also list a single melody multiple times under various guises. For instance, the emperor's theme can also be labeled separately (in the same glossary) as the "dark side" theme, Darth Sidius' theme, etc...&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":41"&gt;Seee http://starwarsmusic.pashamusic.com/index.html and [[wookieepedia:Musical score|Lewister]]'s article on the score.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Setpiece material ===
The inclusive approach also tends to identify leitmotives even where they don't meet the criteria of recurrence.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, a multitude of motifs identified in these reviews:

http://scoresheet.tripod.com/alpha.html&lt;/ref&gt; This is the result of Williams' propensity (in these scores and otherwise) to write material that is either melodic, rhythmic, harmonic or timbral specifically to an individual setpiece or none-recurring plot-element in the film, such as The Battle of Hoth, the Chase through Coruscant, or The Battle of Crait. These individual pieces of music – whether they consist of a full melody, ostinati, diegetic pieces or a certain timbre – have sometimes been described as having thematic significance,&lt;ref&gt;[http://starwarsmusic.pashamusic.com/ Alfred Surenyan] describes themes for the Flag Parade, the Arrival on Tatooine,  Jango's Escape, Taun We (which is mentioned in Takis analysis, but as a setpiece-specific piece), Anakin's Dark Deeds, The Dune Sea, The Emperor's Throne Room, Starkiller Base, etc. Ed Chung describes an "escape theme" from the opening space battle of [http://cuebycue.blogspot.co.il/2016/05/star-wars-ep-iii-revenge-of-sith.html Revenge of the Sith], an Utapau motoric figure appearing in the fight with Grievous, an "[http://cuebycue.blogspot.co.il/search?q=strikes+back exotic Bespin motif]" for the finale of Empire Strikes Back, a "[http://cuebycue.blogspot.co.il/2016/04/star-wars-ep-i-phantom-menace-williams.html taking off]" motif from "The Phantom Menace", etc...&lt;/ref&gt; occasionally (in fleeting comments) even by Williams himself,&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;Williams [http://www.jw-collection.de/scores/swlp.htm refers] to the use of "bouncing" horns in Star Wars as a  "motif" for Luke's Landspeeder, although it is based on no fixed recurring melodic or rhythmic idea. He also [https://www.jwfan.com/?page_id=4585 once] referred to the material for the Battle of Hoth as "thematic", but Matessino's notes ultimately [http://mahawa.jw-music.net/scores/tesbse.htm conclude] that "thematic material is deffered" in the piece. Lehman makes no mention of either motif, even as "incidental" motifs, and in fact stressed that "Themes for self-contained, non-repeating set-pieces are not included." Adams also doesn't list any setpiece-specific material in his thematic analyses, but did [http://jimlochner.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/FSM_TheHeiress.pdf mention] that "the walker attack on Hoth[...]was assigned a memorable and fully realized standalone melody" but, unlike the melody of "The TIE fighters chasing the Millennium Falcon away from the Death Star", which went on to recur in a later installment, this motif (like the Asteroid Field music) is used "with less thought toward a score-length arc of material than toward a series of self-contained vignettes." In the prequels, ostinati-based pieces such as [https://cbwritingblogblog.wordpress.com/2016/01/06/the-themes-of-star-wars-episode-2-the-prequel-trilogy/ Chase through Coruscant] or Jango Fett's escape are described by Adams not as melodies but as "shorter, chunkier motives seldom longer than a measure or two, and often more rhythmic than melodic" and as "terse" and "episodic." [http://www.filmscoremonthly.com/daily/article.cfm?articleID=3866 Jeff Bonds] also mentions that the former sequence features "no theme hitting them [the audience] over the head."&lt;/ref&gt; but since they do not recur in a different part of the narrative, nor are transformed from or into another motif, they do not comply with the definition of a leitmotif, even if they form the highlights of their respective scores or even featured prominently in the "making of" material (e.g. Chase through Coruscant).&lt;ref&gt;One unusual case involves the revised music of the victory celebrations of Return of the Jedi, with Adams classifying it as thematic out of an expectation (ultimately to be proven false) of Williams to weave it into the prequel scores.&lt;/ref&gt; A case of particular note is the piece Williams designated as the "Jawa theme."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; While it is a fully realized melody, clearly evoking the "little scrap and robot collectors", as Williams called them, it doesn't recur across two discrete cues, rather being just interrupted briefly by Imperial music (the interruption slightly extended in the film by silence&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aaronkrerowicz.com/star-wars-blog/a-new-hope-timeline-of-musical-themes-and-motifs&lt;/ref&gt;) and than resuming.&lt;ref name=":35" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":47" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":51" /&gt;

=== Incidental material ===
Even when some of these figures do recur, it is often unclear whether they are substantial enough to be assigned with thematic significance, as these instances often includes material that is incidental in nature, such as several figures used in the finale of ''The Empire Strikes Back;''&lt;ref&gt;The finale features two interwoven pieces of music: rhythmic phrases in the strings for the shootout, and an "ascending horn phrase" for three individual and unrelated moments: Luke spotting Boba Fett, him confronting Darth Vader, and lastly, Boba taking off with Han's effigy onboard. The latter has been described as a possible "ambush" motif, or as a secondary theme for Boba, but both seem to be too setpiece-specific to possess any leitmotivic significance, and are not described by neither Adams, [http://mahawa.jw-music.net/scores/tesbse.htm Matessino] or Lehman as leitmotifs of any kind, nor mentioned by [http://www.jw-collection.de/scores/tesblp.htm Williams] himself.

For instance, his use of tritones often denotes mystery, a device he uses for the droids landing on Tatooine and again in the concert arrangement of "The Throne Room."  He uses a related device to reflect the mystery of Luke's whereabouts in ''The Force Awakens''. However, similar devices are also used in ''Indiana Jones'' to represent the mysteries of the Ark&lt;ref&gt;Adams, who also identifies this idea's appearance in Raiders of the Lost Ark, identified these as "mystery chords", stating that they "may or may not" have been conceived as a leitmotif, but concludes that they "probably didn't mean anything." Lehman identifies the gesture from the original Star Wars as one to do with descending unto a planet, and the one from The Force Awakens as a motif for the map leading to Luke.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Crystal Skull. Hence, it is more of a way for Williams to evoke mystery, than a motif conceived specifically for any one of these scores.

Similarly, other gestures taken from pre-existing music (such as Williams' use of the [[Dies irae|Dies Irae]] melody to denote impending doom) have been falsely identified as leitmotifs, even though Williams clearly described sections of music that rely on this gesture, such as his original take of the binary sunset, as non-thematic.&lt;ref&gt;Lehman classifies all these types of recurring material as "incidental motifs" rather than proper leitmotifs. These include the aforementioned "chromatic choral writing" from The Phantom Menace underwater scenes, suspenseful string writing in ''The Force Awakens'', "Mournful homophonic choral progressions" in ''The Last Jedi'' and a multitude of other material such as "heroic descending tetrachords", "cascading trumpet lines", etc...&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, sometimes the supposedly recurring material is similar, but not in fact identical. A good example would be the variety of gestures relating to the dark side, following a piece of music used in the opera-house scene. Lehamn however clarifies that those alleged following statements are "similar but inexact" to the earlier gesture.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; In other cases, variations on the same thematic ideas are erroneously labeled as two or more separate themes, such as a secondary droid motif or a motif for Anakin's immolation,&lt;ref name=":41" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; which is in fact a variation on his lament theme. Similarly, the proposed motifs for Mustafar&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; or Anakin's Dark Deeds&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; are in fact variations on Grievous' material, redirected to the evil Anakin.&lt;ref&gt;Mikko Ojala, [http://www.jwfan.com/forums/index.php?/topic/7211-about-the-themes-of-rots/ About the themes of Revenge of the Sith]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adams [http://jimlochner.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/FSM_TheHeiress.pdf comments] that the Grievous material appears in "in several developmental guises", probably referring to these applications later in the score.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes, the recurring material is question is not part of the original composition but is rather tracked after-the-fact, or at least lifted, from existing material into a different section of the film, or from material that is recapitulated in a concert piece or end-credits suite. This includes the [[Podracing]] fanfare and the ostinato accompaniment of the Rebel Fanfare,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The "podrace motif" recurs in tracked music and in a dedicated concert rendition of the flag parade. The action ostinato is an incidental accompaniment used for the Rebel Fanfare in the Battle of Yavin, which would end up tracked into Sail Barge Assault in Return of the Jedi, along with the third appearance of the X-Wing attack motif which Adams identifies therein.&lt;/ref&gt; which otherwise doesn't appear isolated from the unabridged theme more than once; the mournful writing for French horn at Shmi's funeral, the Arena March from ''Attack of the Clones&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;''&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; etc. Occasionally, track titles are mistaken for themes.&lt;ref name=":41" /&gt;

Williams had created themes out of none-recurring material by quoting them again in a following score: e.g. the funeral music for Qui Gon being reused (and repurposed) as a general funeral theme in Revenge of the Sith. This, however, does not extend to such gestures being quoted in spin-off scores (e.g. the Asteroid Field in Solo, the material for Imperial Walkers in Rogue One) nor for more fleeting, none-narrative references which Williams provides in his scores.&lt;ref name=":50" /&gt;

==Themes in the Anthology films==
[[File:Michael Giacchino Sep 2017.jpg|thumb|[[Michael Giacchino]], the composer of ''[[Rogue One]]'']]The first ''Star Wars Anthology'' score for ''[[Rogue One]]'', written by [[Michael Giacchino]], utilizes several themes (and recurring interstitial material) from John Williams, mostly for their Romantic sweep (such as The Force Theme and hints of the Main Theme). It has its own catalog of themes, independent from Williams' material, including a new, third theme for the Empire, although Giacchino also quotes both the original Imperial Motif and The Imperial March.

=== ''Rogue One'' ===
''Returning: Luke's Theme; Rebel Fanfare; The Force Theme; Leia's Theme; Imperial Motif; Death Star Motif; The Imperial March''

* Jyn's Theme
* Hope Theme
* Guardians of the Whills Theme
* Imperial Theme (Krennic's Theme)

===''Solo''===
For ''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story|Solo]]'', John Williams wrote and recorded a concert arrangement for a new theme for Han Solo. In the process of composing the theme, Williams ended up using two separate ideas, each conveying a different aspect of the character, and went as far as to spot the film for places to use each motif; all other leitmotifs and other material were written and adapted by [[John Powell (film composer)|John Powell]], the main composer for the film.&lt;ref name=":27"&gt;https://variety.com/2017/film/news/john-williams-star-wars-composer-han-solo-movie-theme-1202650282/amp/?__twitter_impression=true&lt;/ref&gt;

By John Williams:

* Han Solo's Theme&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;
** "Han Solo's Searching theme"&lt;ref&gt;According to John Powell, "The Adventures of Han" contains two themes which Williams develops separately (to the point of spotting them for a couple of actual cues), one more heroic, the other - more reflective.&lt;/ref&gt;

By John Powell:

* Chewbacca's Theme
* Han and Qi'Ra's Love Theme
* L3'S Theme
* Crew theme
* Enfys Nest Theme

==Concert suites==
Instead of offering a full recording release of a particular film, Williams typically releases a condensed score on album,&lt;ref&gt;The first three scores received an expanded Anthology release and finally an effectivelly complete release in 1996. The Phantom Menace was also released in an "Ultimate Edition", featuring a lot of added cues but also multiple instances of tracked music, hence lacking a lot of original music that wasn't used as intended  by the composer in the finished film. The Last Jedi received an isolated score release, albeit again not including unused material and maintaining tracked sequences.&lt;/ref&gt; in which the music is arranged out of the film order and more within the veins of a concert program. These album releases typically include several concert suites, written purely for the end credits or the album itself, where a specific theme is developed continuously throughout the piece. Williams also re-edited some of his existing cues after the fact in order to "concertize" theme on the behest of conductors such as Charles Gerhardt. Five of the eight films also have unique credit suites that features alternate concert arrangements of themes and/or a medley of the main themes of a particular film.

==Diegetic music==
[[Source cue|Diegetic]] music is music "that occurs as part of the action (rather than as background), and can be heard by the film's characters".&lt;ref&gt;{{Wiktionary-inline|diegetic|''Diegetic''}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the orchestral scope that was brought on by John Williams' musical score, the ''Star Wars'' franchise also features many distinguishing diegetic songs that enrich the detail of the audio [[mise-en-scène]]. Some of this diegetic music was written by John Williams; some by his son, Joseph; and some by various other people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hutchinson|first1=Sean|title=Alien Musicians in 'Star Wars,' Ranked|url=https://www.inverse.com/article/8065-alien-musicians-in-star-wars-ranked|website=Inverse|accessdate=December 30, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151230232511/https://www.inverse.com/article/8065-alien-musicians-in-star-wars-ranked|archivedate=December 30, 2015|date=November 11, 2015 |dead-url=no}} {{Link note|note=Archived page contains a JavaScript that replaces article with page not found message.

From ''Star Wars''
* "Cantina Band" and "Cantina Band #2". Written by John Williams, it is played in the Mos Eisley Cantina on Tatooine. It is written for solo trumpet, three saxophones, clarinet, Fender Rhodes piano, steel drum, synthesizer and various percussion, including boobams and toms. According to the ''[[Star Wars Customizable Card Game]]'', the [[diegesis|diegetic]] title for the first Cantina band piece is "Mad About Me". The liner notes for the 1997 Special Edition release of the ''Star Wars'' soundtrack describe the concept behind these works as "several creatures in a future century finding some 1930's [[Benny Goodman]] swing band music ... and how they might attempt to interpret it". This piece also appears on an all the outtakes [[easter egg (media)|easter eggs]] on the DVDs from episode I and II &lt;!-- Ep III had Hip Hop Yoda --&gt; and on the bonus disc of the 2004 original trilogy DVD set.
From ''Return of the Jedi''

* "Jabba's Baroque Recital". [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]-esque John Williams composition (featuring a synthesized harpsichord) played while 3PO and R2 first arrive and play Jabba the message from Luke Skywalker.
* "Lapti Nek". Written by [[Joseph Williams (musician)|Joseph Williams]] and translated into Huttese, this is played by the Max Rebo Band in Jabba the Hutt's palace (in the original cut of the movie).
* "Jedi Rocks" (composed by [[Jerry Hey]]). This was composed to replace ''Lapti Nek'' for the 1997 Special Edition of the film.
* "Max Rebo Band Jams".  Heard twice in the film, once after Jabba sends the Wookiee Chewbacca to jail, and again on Jabba's Sail Barge (hence its title). A recording of the first can be found on the official ''Star Wars'' Soundboards.
* "Ewok Feast" and "Part of the Tribe". By John Williams. Heard when Luke and company were captured by the Ewoks and brought to their treehouses.
* "Ewok Celebration". The Victory Song, whose lyrics were written by [[Joseph Williams (musician)|Joseph Williams]], can be heard at the end of the original release of ''Return of the Jedi''.
* "Victory Celebration". By John Williams. The Victory Song at the end of the ''Return of the Jedi'' 1997 re-edition.
From ''The Phantom Menace''

* "Tatooine Street Music". [[Joseph Williams (musician)|Joseph Williams]] wrote four separate pieces of unusual, vaguely Eastern sounding source music for the streets of Mos Espa, featuring a player on Cretan Lyra and Cumbus, and a solo, wailing female vocal.
* "Augie's Municipal Band". By John Williams. Music played during the peace parade at the end of the film, it is a sped-up, attenuated trumpet and boy choir composition. It is closely related to the Emperor's Theme, but is not an outright quote of it.
From ''Attack of the Clones''

* "Dex's Diner"
* "Unknown Episode II Source Cue". A second source cue is credited to [[Joseph Williams (musician)|Joseph Williams]]' name for Episode II, but is not heard in the film.
* "Arena Percussion". Originally meant to accompany the Droid Factory sequence, [[Ben Burtt]]'s attempt at composition is instead shifted to the arena, replacing the predominantly unused [[John Williams]] cue "Entrance of the Monsters."
From ''The Force Awakens''

* "Jabba Flow" and "Dobra Doompa". Written by [[Lin-Manuel Miranda]] and [[J.J. Abrams]], these songs were played at [[Maz Kanata]]'s castle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2015/12/star-wars-songs-ranked/|title=The 9 Best Songs Ever Played in a Star Wars Movie|last1=Raftery|first1=Brian|date=December 21, 2015|website=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|publisher=[[Condé Nast]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222024747/http://www.wired.com/2015/12/star-wars-songs-ranked/|archivedate=December 22, 2015|accessdate=December 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
From ''The Last Jedi''

* "Canto Bight". Written by John Williams, it appears when Finn and Rose first arrive to the casino planet of Canto Bight. It is written in the style of big-band jazz and is stylistically akin to the "Cantina Band" music from ''Star Wars''. The track features solo alto saxophone, two bass saxophones, solo clarinet, trombones, kazoo, muted trumpets,&lt;ref&gt;The Kazoos were inserted into the mutes to produce a nasal sound.&lt;/ref&gt; Fender Rhodes piano, bass, synthesizers, steel drums, and various percussion, including washboards and goblet drums. The track briefly quotes "[[Aquarela do Brasil]]" (which also features hi-hat and ride cymbals) by [[Ary Barroso]] as a reference to the 1985 [[Terry Gilliam]] film [[Brazil (1985 film)|''Brazil'']], and includes a brief piano statement of Williams' and Johnny Mercer's theme from [[The Long Goodbye (film)|''The Long Goodbye'']].
* "Caretaker party music": source cue of an unknown composition (possibly by Williams), which features highland bagpipes and a didgeridoo, and accompanies a deleted scene from the film.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14507">'''National cinema''' is a term sometimes used in [[film theory]] and [[film criticism]] to describe the films associated with a specific nation-state. Although there is little relatively written on theories of national cinema it has an irrefutably important role in [[globalization]]. Film provides a unique window to other cultures, particularly where the output of a nation or region is high. Countries like South Korea, Russia and Iran have over the years produced a large body of critically acclaimed films. Regardless of the stories or styles of filmmaking the medium inherently contains a dense wealth of information about people and places through which audiences gain knowledge.[[File:First look launch of Baahubali 2 (cropped).jpg|thumb|The [[Cinema of India|Indian Cinema]] produces movies in over 18 languages and sells more tickets than any other country in the world.]]Like other film theory or film criticism terms (e.g., "[[art film]]"), the term "national cinema" is hard to define, and its meaning is debated by film scholars and critics. A film may be considered to be part of a "national cinema" based on a number of factors. Simply put, a "nation's cinema" can be attributed to the country that provided the financing for the film, the language spoken in the film, the nationalities or dress of the characters, and the setting, music, or cultural elements present in the film.&lt;ref&gt;Jimmy Choi.

Available at: http://ics.leeds.ac.uk/papers/vp01.cfm?outfit=ifilm&amp;folder=17&amp;paper=22&lt;/ref&gt; To define a national cinema, some scholars emphasize the structure of the film industry and the roles played by "...market forces, government support, and cultural transfers..."&lt;ref&gt;Tom O' Regan ''Australian National Cinema'', cited in Jimmy Choi.

&lt;/ref&gt;
More theoretically, national cinema can refer to a large group of films, or "a body of [[textuality]]... given historical weight through common intertextual 'symptoms', or coherencies".&lt;ref name="Vitali, V. 2006"&gt;Vitali, V., &amp; Willemen, P. (2006). Theorising national cinema. London: Bfi (British Film Institute) Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Theorising National Cinema'', Philip Rosen suggests national cinema is a conceptualization of: (1) Selected 'national' films/texts themselves, the relationship between them, which be connected by a shared (general) symptom. (2) an understanding of the 'nation' as an entity in synchronicity with its 'symptom'. And (3) an understanding of past or traditional 'symptoms', also known as history or historiography, which contribute to current systems and 'symptoms'.&lt;ref name="Vitali, V. 2006"/&gt; These symptoms of intertextuality could refer to style, medium, content, narrative, narrative structure, costume, [[Mise-en-scène]], character, background, cinematography. It could refer to cultural background of those who make the movie and cultural background of those in the movie, of spectatorship, of spectacle.

==Canada==
Canadian cultural and film critics have long debated how Canadian national cinema can be defined, or whether there is a Canadian national cinema. Most of the films shown on Canadian movie screens are US imports. If "Canadian national cinema" is defined as the films made in Canada, then the canon of Canadian cinema would have to include lightweight teen-oriented fare such as ''[[Meatballs (film)|Meatballs]]''(1979), ''[[Porky's]]'' (1983) or ''[[Death Ship (1980 film)|Death Ship]]'' (1980). Other critics have defined Canadian national cinema as a "...reflection of Canadian life and culture." Some critics argue that there are "two traditions of filmmaking in Canada." The "documentary realist tradition" espoused by the federal government's [[National Film Board]] and avant-garde films.

Scott MacKenzie argues that by the late 1990s, if Canada did have a popular cinema with both avant-garde and experimental elements, that was influenced by European filmmakers such as [[Jean-Luc Godard]] and [[Wim Wenders]]. MacKenzie argues that Canadian cinema has a "...self-conscious concern with the incorporation of cinematic and televisual images", and as examples, he cites films such as [[David Cronenberg]]'s ''[[Videodrome]]'' (1983), [[Atom Egoyan]]'s'' [[Family Viewing]]'' (1987), [[Robert Lepage]]'s ''[[The Confessional]] (Le Confessionnal)'' (1995) and [[Srinivas Krishna]]'s ''Masala'' (1991).&lt;ref&gt;Scott MacKenzie, University of Glasgow. National Identity, Canadian Cinema, and Multiculturalism. Available at: https://archive.is/20121201023833/http://www.uqtr.ca/AE/vol_4/scott.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==France==
France's national cinema includes both popular cinema and "avant-garde" films. French national cinema is associated with the [[auteur theory|auteur]] filmmakers and with a variety of specific movements. Avant-garde filmmakers include [[Germaine Dulac]], Marie and [[Jean Epstein]]. [[Poetic Realism]] filmmakers include [[Jean Renoir]] and [[Marcel Carné]]. The [[French New Wave]] filmmakers include [[Jean-Luc Godard]] and [[François Truffaut]]. The 1990s and 2000s "[[postmodernism|postmodern]] cinema" of France includes filmmakers such as [[Jean-Jacques Beinex]], [[Luc Besson]] and [[Coline Serreau]].&lt;ref&gt;Susan Hayward. French National Cinema&lt;/ref&gt;

==Germany==
During the German [[Weimar Republic]], German national cinema was influenced by silent and sound "Bergfilm" (this translates to "mountain film"). During the 1920s and early 1930s, German national cinema was known for the progressive and artistic approaches to filmmaking with "shifted conventional cinematic vocabulary" and which gave actresses a much larger range of character-types.&lt;ref name="brightlightsfilm.com"&gt;''German National Cinema'', by Sabine Hake. London and New York: Routledge, 2002. Trade paper, {{ISBN|0-415-08902-6}}. Reviewed by Robert von Dassanowsky. Available at: http://www.brightlightsfilm.com/38/booksgerman.htm&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Nazi]] era, the major film studio UFA was controlled by Propaganda Minister [[Goebbels]]. UFA produced "Hetzfilme" (anti-Semitic hate films) and films which emphasized the "theme of heroic death." Other film genres produced by UFA during the Nazi era included historical and biographical dramas that emphasized the achievements in German history, comedy films, and propaganda films.&lt;ref name="brightlightsfilm.com"/&gt;

During the [[Cold War]] from the 1950s through the 1980s, there were West German films and East German films. Film historians and film scholars do not agree whether the films from the different parts of Cold War-era Germany can be considered to be a single "German national cinema." Some West German films were about the "immediate past in sociopolitical thought and in literature". [[East Germany|East German]] films were often [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-funded "socially critical" films. Some East German films examined Germany's [[Nazi]] past, such as Wolfgang Staudte's ''Die Mörder sind unter uns'' (''The Murderers Are Among Us'').&lt;ref name="brightlightsfilm.com"/&gt;

The New German Cinema of the 1970s and 1980s included films by directors such as [[Fassbinder]], [[Werner Herzog|Herzog]], and [[Wim Wenders]]. While these directors made films with "many ideological and cinematic messages", they all shared the common element of providing an "aesthetic alternativ(e) to [[Classic Hollywood cinema|Hollywood]]" films and "a break with the cultural and political traditions associated with the [[Third Reich]]"(159).&lt;ref name="brightlightsfilm.com"/&gt;

==Poland==
After World War II, the Lódz Film School was founded in 1948. During the 1950s and 1960s, a "Polish School" of filmmakers developed, such as [[Wojciech Has]], [[Kazimierz Kutz]], [[Andrzej Munk]] and [[Andrzej Wajda]]. According to film scholar Marek Haltof, the Polish School of directors made films which can be described as the "Cinema of Distrust." In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Wajda, Krzysztof Zanussi and Barbara Sass made influential films which garnered interest outside of Poland. However, even though Western countries became increasingly interested in Polish cinema during this period, the country's film infrastructure and market was disintegrating.&lt;ref&gt;Shelia Skaff.

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mexico==
Although it is difficult to determine and define a 'national cinema', much of what many consider Mexican national cinema, but not limited to, is [[Golden Age of Mexican cinema|Golden Age of Mexican Cinema]] and films that revolve around the [[Mexican Revolution]]. Unique trajectories of Mexican cinema's development shaped historically specific understandings of the ontology of the moving image, leading to unique configurations of documentation and fictionalization. The Revolution spilled across pages of the press, and became the primary subject of Mexican films produced between 1911 and 1916.&lt;ref&gt;Navitsky, Rielle Public Spectacles of Violence: Sensational Cinema and Journalism in Early Twentieth-Century Mexico and Brazil Durham, NC: Duke University Press 344 pp., $27.95, {{ISBN|082236963X}} Publication Date: June 2017. History: Reviews of New Books. 46. 71-72. 10.1080/03612759.2018.1436314.&lt;/ref&gt; There was a high interest in topicality in and capturing current events as they unfolded, re-staging, or combining both approaching, created a sensationalist appeal in these visual 'records' of death and injury. Compilation documentaries, such as Toscano's [[Memories of a Mexican|Memorias de un Mexicano]] in the years following the Mexican Revolution can be seen as part of a broader cultural politics of nationalism that worked to naturalize and to consolidate the political and ideological story of the revolution.

Later narrativized dramas, such as [[María Candelaria]], [[The Pearl (film)]], [[Enamorada (film)]], [[Río Escondido (1948 film)|Rio Escondido]], Saián Mexico, or [[Pueblerina]] by [[Emilio Fernandez]] and/or [[Gabriel Figueroa]], are often considered part of the Mexican national cinematic body. These films, and most popular films of the 1920s in Mexico, adopted [[David Bordwell]]'s "cinematic norms": narrative linkage, cause and effect, goal oriented protagonists, temporal order or cinematic time, and filmic space as story space. But also, is noted to have incorporated visual folkloric style of [[José Guadalupe Posada]], the deconstructing landscapes of [[Gerardo Murillo]], and the low angles, deep focus, diagonal lines, and 'native' imagery in [[Sergei Eisenstein]]'s [[Que Viva Mexico]] ! Although a mélange of Western and Mexican influences coexist in Fernandez's films, his Mexican biography and locality leave a legacy of romanticizing Mexico and Mexican history, often presenting idyllic ranches, singing, and a charming life of the poor.

Although of European heritage, [[Louis Buñuel]]'s work in Mexico is another example that presents 'symptoms' of Mexican national identity.  Although less well received by lower classes, and more admired by upper classes, Buñuel's [[Los Olvidados]] stands as an example that a director's national heritage doesn't always have to contribute to the conceptualization of a nation's cinema. Rather than building the nation through celebration, the film presents problem, which contribute to a global identity and context of the nation state. Buñuel, however, is less interested in presenting some 'identity' of message, national or international, and remarked that "to ask whether the film is Mexican or not, is to resist, to seek, to disperse, the very mystery this film articulates for us".

Modern genres embraced and nurtured as 'Mexican national cinema' are often those of the social and family melodrama genre, such as [[Como agua para chocolate]] (1991) by Alfonso Arau, the working class melodrama (i.e. Danzon in 1991 by Maria Novaro), the comedy (i.e. Sólo con tu pareja, 1991, Alfonso Cuarón) and the rural ''costumbrismo'' film (i.e. La mujer de Benjamin, 1990, by Carlos Carrera). Changes in the politics of film industry instituions allowed these film texts and their directors to "transform the traditional filmic paradigm". Up to 60% of financial assistance for national, Latin American, and European productions were provided by the [[:es:Instituto Mexicano de Cinematograf%C3%ADa|Instituto Mexicano de Cinematografia]], new models of co-production were created, and distribution and sales channels were opened abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Torres San Martin, Patricia. “The Guadalajarans’ Amores Perros.” Comunicación y Sociedad, núm. 37 , June 2000, pp. 179–202., doi:10.15417/1881.&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Night Prowler'''" is the final track on [[AC/DC]]'s album ''[[Highway to Hell (album)|Highway to Hell]]''. The track has two breaths in quick succession at the start of the song, intended to create a tone of fear and loathing.&lt;ref name="Bonfire"&gt;{{cite book|author=Engleheart, Murray|date=18 November 1997|title=AC/DC&amp;nbsp;– Bonfire}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is known among other AC/DC songs for its slow [[blues]] rhythm, ominous lyrics, as well as its controversy stemming from its association with the [[Richard Ramirez]] serial killings in 1985.

=="Night Stalker" controversy==
{{main|Richard Ramirez}}
In June 1985, a highly publicized murder case began revolving around Richard Ramírez, who was responsible for more than 15 brutal murders as well as rapes and attempted murders in [[Los Angeles]]. Nicknamed the "Night Stalker", Ramírez was a fan of AC/DC, particularly the song "Night Prowler". Police also claimed that Ramírez was wearing an AC/DC shirt and left an AC/DC hat at one of his crime scenes. During the trial, Ramírez shouted "[[Hail Satan]]!" and showed off the [[pentagram]] carved into his palm. The incident brought extremely bad publicity to the band, whose concerts and albums were suddenly campaigned against by parents in Los Angeles County.{{cn|date=March 2017}} On [[VH1]]'s ''[[Behind the Music]]'' on AC/DC, the band claimed that while the song had taken on a murderous connotation by Ramírez, it is actually about a boy sneaking into his girlfriend's bedroom at night.

The '''portrayal of Mormons in comics''' includes [[Anti-Mormonism|anti-Mormon]] [[Editorial cartoon|political cartoons]] from the 19th and 20th centuries as well as characters in comics who identify as [[Mormons|Mormon]]. In addition, various artists have made comic book versions of parts of [[The Book of Mormon]].

Early woodcuts from the 1840s depicted Mormons negatively in anti-Mormon literature. In the latter half of the 19th century, political cartoons satirized Mormon issues and events like the [[Mountain Meadows massacre]], polygamy, and the death of [[Brigham Young]]. In these political cartoons, Mormons were often portrayed as an ethnic minority. Beginning in 1898 when [[B.H. Roberts]] was elected to congress and continuing through [[Reed Smoot]]'s election to Senate, political cartoons focused on these politicians's ties to Mormonism and polygamy. After Smoot's hearing ended in 1904, cartoons about Mormons were less frequent.

20th-century Mormon comics have some references to Mormons, usually in passing as a cultural reference. Contemporary comics like ''Salt City Strangers'' and ''Stripling Warrior'' focus on the experiences of Mormon characters.

Various artists have depicted parts of ''The Book of Mormon'' in comic book form. In 1947, John Philip Dalby and Henry Anderson both published comics summarizing Book of Mormon stories. [[Ric Estrada]]'s "Peace with Honor" fill-in story of Coriantumr was published in ''GI Combat'' #169 and his illustrations appeared in the LDS church's ''New Testament Stories'' in 1980. [[Mike Allred]] published three volumes of ''The Golden Plates'' in 2004 and 2005, which also summarizes events in ''The Book of Mormon''. Other artists have attempted similar projects. Several events from LDS church history are also depicted in comics.

==Portrayal of the early LDS Church in comic art==
Members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (referred to as [[Mormons]]) have long been a subject of satirical humor. Illustrated [[Anti-Mormonism|anti-Mormon]] books and newspaper columns were commonplace throughout the United States during the 19th century.&lt;ref name= "Bunker1983"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bunker|first1=Gary L.|last2=Bitton|first2=Davis|title=The Mormon Graphic Image, 1834–1914|date=1983|publisher=University of Utah Press|location=Salt Lake City, Utah|isbn=0874802180}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3–6}}

===Woodcuts===
Some of the earliest forms of illustration used to poke fun at the LDS faith were the [[woodcut]]s done by [[Eber D. Howe]]. He used these cuts published in 1834 to depict tall tales surrounding the account of [[Joseph Smith|Joseph Smith's]] acquisition of the [[golden plates]].&lt;ref name= "Bunker1983"/&gt;{{rp|11}} The next major anti-Mormon publication was done in 1842 and was an exposé turned book called ''History of the Saints'', written by ex-Mormon John C. Bennett with woodcuts by F.E. Worchester and an illustration by Reverend Henry Caswall.&lt;ref name= "Bunker1983"/&gt;{{rp|12–13}} In 1842, Sidney Roberts published ''Great Distress and Loss of American Citizens'' in which two prints, "A Partial View of the Massacre of the Mormons" and "Mormon's leaving the city of Nauvoo, February 1st, 1846", depicted the plight of the Mormons. Soon after, more [[ex-Mormon]] publications appeared, such as ''An Authentic History of Remarkable Persons''. As the woodcuts were not used as often, by 1847 [[caricature]]s had become more prevalent and were used to portray the Council of the Twelve Apostles in a book written by ex-Mormons Maria and Increase Van Deusen. Their book went through twenty-three editions during an eighteen year period and focused on aspects of temple worship and ceremonies sacred to the Mormons and included a detailed, fold-out illustration with color.&lt;ref name= "Bunker1983"/&gt;{{rp|14–16}}

===In newspapers 1857–1898===
[[File:Startling Revelations for Saints and Sinners Hell Upon Earth by W Jarman Ex-Mormon Priest.jpg|thumb|1882 illustration by W. Jarman, an ex-Mormon priest, depicting women walking into a skull labeled "Utah"]]
In 1857, the first Mormon serial cartoons, later known as comics, emerged as part of ''Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper'' and bridged the subject of how women in the [[Mormon militia]] would affect the outcome of the Utah War.&lt;ref name= "Bunker1983"/&gt;{{rp|23}} Other comics published that year focused on the Mountain Meadows massacre, depicting Mormons as people who were ignorantly obedient to a cruel prophet.&lt;ref name= "Bunker 1975"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bunker|first1=Gary L.|last2=Bitton|first2=Davis|title=Illustrated Periodical Images of Mormons|journal=Dialogue Journal|date=1975|volume=10|issue=3|pages=82–92|url=https://www.dialoguejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/articles/Dialogue_V10N03_84.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year another serial cartoon appeared in ''Nick Nax'' and portrayed the family and gender dynamics in the Mormon community. The most prevalent topic for Mormon criticism in the media during this time period surrounded the newly adopted practice of [[plural marriage]].&lt;ref name="Bunker1983"/&gt;{{rp|34}} The illustrations entitled "Brigham Young the Great American Family" in ''Frank Leslie's Budget'' and "The Family Bedstead" in ''Roughing It'', published in the 1870s, both satirised Mormon polygamy.&lt;ref name="Bunker1983"/&gt;{{rp|38–40}} In 1872 a ten-panel serial cartoon in ''Leslie's Weekley'' depicted a scene in which many Mormon women sought a Japanese ambassador's hand in marriage, entitled "The Adventures of the Japanese Ambassador in Utah".&lt;ref name= "Bunker1983"/&gt;{{rp|38}}&lt;ref name= "Bunker1983"/&gt;{{rp|38–40}} Animalistic depictions of polygamy were also common. One example is ''The Lantern's'' depiction of a rooster surrounded by many hens with the caption "A foul (fowl) piece of Mormonism".&lt;ref name= "Bunker 1975"/&gt;

Young's announcement of the implementation of the [[United Order]] in 1874 gave rise to another wave of satirical cartoons. Most of these were related to the illustrated periodical entitled ''Enoch's Advocate'' printed by anti-Mormons in Utah.&lt;ref name= "Bunker1983"/&gt;{{rp|42}} [[Henry Ward Beecher#.22The Beecher-Tilton Scandal Case.22 .281875.29|The Beecher-Tilton Scandal Case]] of 1875 inspired a resurgence of Mormon-related comics.  Although this adultery case was not directly related to Mormonism, for a few years following Young's death in 1877, the magazine [[Puck (magazine)|''Puck'']] and other print sources related that Beecher was qualified to be his successor as president of the Mormon church.&lt;ref name= "Bunker1983"/&gt;{{rp|95–101}}

During the rest of the 1870s and continuing during the 1880s, most of the comics relating to Mormonism had ties to politics. One example depicts the many difficulties that the newly elected President Cleveland would face during his presidency in the comic from ''Puck'' entitled "Foes in His Path.-The Herculean Task Before Our Next President." These problems were illustrated and the typical personification of Mormonism, which included an old bearded man with the word ''Mormonism'' written around his waist and some depiction of his many wives, was shown among them.&lt;ref name= "Bunker1983"/&gt;{{rp|117}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Mormons and racial minorities===

In 1879, ''[[The Wasp (magazine)|The Wasp]]'' introduced the comparison of the Mormons with other groups such as Chinese, blacks, native Americans, and Irish peoples in a cartoon portraying Uncle Sam kicking said groups out of his bed.&lt;ref name= "Bunker1983"/&gt;{{rp|75}} Many similar cartoons depicting Uncle Sam and his annoyance with the diverse religious and ethnic groups that resided in the United States were created during this period.&lt;ref name= "Bunker1983"/&gt;{{rp|81}} Another way in which the media portrayed Mormons was by combining aspects of the Mormon and Catholic faiths, such as dressing a Mormon man in the religious clothing of the Catholic faith.&lt;ref name= "Bunker1983"/&gt;{{rp|84}} Many times blacks were portrayed in Mormon polygamist families.&lt;ref name="Bunker1983"/&gt;{{rp|85}}

According to historian W. Paul Reeve, by the early 1900s, with the intense media coverage of the [[Reed Smoot hearings]], such images became "part of an effort to trap Mormons in a racially suspect past even as Mormon leaders attempted to shape a whiter future." Mormons were keenly aware of the racial slight:{{quote|Outsiders suggested that Mormons were physically different and racially more similar to marginalized groups than they were to white people. Mormons responded with aspirations toward whiteness. It was a back-and-forth struggle between what outsiders imagined and what Mormons believed. The process was never linear and most often involved both sides talking past each other. Yet, Mormons in the nineteenth century recognized their suspect racial position.|W. Paul Reeve, in ''Religion of a Different Color: Race and the Mormon Struggle for Whiteness'' (Oxford University Press, 2015)&lt;ref name="Reeve2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=W. Paul Reeve|title=Religion of a Different Color: Race and the Mormon Struggle for Whiteness|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mpYKBgAAQBAJ|year=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-975407-6|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[File:The Judge 16 To 1 Movement.jpg|thumb|Political cartoon from 1896 showing a Utah man with 16 wives to exaggerate the kind of people who supported the [[Free Silver movement]].]]

===In newspapers 1898–1909===
Between 1905 and 1909, [[The Salt Lake Tribune|''The'' ''Salt Lake Tribune'']] included over 600 cartoons relating to Mormonism.&lt;ref name= "Bunker1983"/&gt;{{rp|57}} Related images were beginning to be produced in not only newspapers and magazines, but in pamphlets, periodicals, and more illustrated books. The Mormon leader and politician B. H. Roberts was elected to Congress in 1898, which put the LDS church in the spotlight once again and the fact that Roberts practiced polygamy caused many problems for him, his family, and the other Mormons still engaged in polygamist relationships. The ''Salt Lake Tribune'' and many other media outlets had a field day after discovering that one of Roberts' plural wives had just given birth to twins.&lt;ref name= "Bunker1983"/&gt;{{rp|61}}

[[File:The apostle is going some.png|thumb|Reed Smoot is shown fleeing two volumes of the Journal of Discourses in a 1906 comic. Protestants used quotes from the volumes of teachings of the prophets when asking Smoot questions about his religion.&lt;ref name="Paulos1" /&gt;]]
A similar reaction occurred in the press when Reed Smoot was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1903.&lt;ref name= "Bunker1983"/&gt;{{rp|65}} For the next three years, many cartoons and comics were created surrounding Smoot's office.&lt;ref name= "Bunker1983"/&gt;{{rp|65}} One of the most iconic of these sketches was "What They Expected at Washington" created by the cartoonist Lovey, which shows a train with one car for husbands, many more cars for wives, and then continuing off into the distance are the train cars full of Mormon children.&lt;ref name= "Bunker1983"/&gt;{{rp|65–66}} The anti-Mormon sentiment in ''The Salt Lake Tribune'' was fueled by its owner, Republican senator [[Thomas Kearns]].&lt;ref name="Paulos1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Paulos|first=Michael|year=2006|title=Political Cartooning and the Reed Smoot Hearings|url=https://www.sunstonemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/articles/144-36-40.pdf|journal=Sunstone|volume=|pages=36–40|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Kearns and Smoot were initially friendly, according to Michael Paulos, Smoot's political success came a cost of Kearns's, and Kearns hired ex-Mormon Frank J. Cannon to edit the ''Tribune''. Cannon's extreme anti-Mormonism, as reflected in the ''Tribune'' at the time, was noted sarcastically by non-Mormons: "How proud we Gentiles are of our self-constituted champions in the fight the Tribune is making on the Mormons!"&lt;ref name="Paulos1" /&gt;
[[File:Anti-Mormon cartoon (cropped).jpeg|thumb|An 1898 anti-Mormon political cartoon by [[Charles Nelan]]]]
In 1904, after Smoot was officially seated in the Senate, the national media's intense interest in Mormonism slowly declined and because of new forms of communication and transportation people were able to learn more about the Mormons on a personal level instead of relying on the information provided in the comics of the daily newspaper.&lt;ref name= "Bunker1983"/&gt;{{rp|71}}

Many popular comic depictions included Mormon women who were impoverished, uncultured, hideous, unfaithful, overbearing, and overworked slaves to their husbands. They were also often depicted as being members of a harem and being part of a lustful marital lifestyle.&lt;ref name= "Bunker1983"/&gt;{{rp|127–128}} During this time in history most women were portrayed in a negative light in the media, but because of the controversy of polygamy in Mormon culture, the amount of ridicule that Mormon women received was far worse than that received by their non-Mormon counterparts.&lt;ref name= "Bunker1983"/&gt;{{rp|136}}

==Mormon characters in comics 1950s–today==
Comic book adaptations of Sherlock Holmes's ''[[A Study in Scarlet]]'' were among the first portrayals of Mormons in comics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harmer|first1=Katie|title=Brigham Young, Porter Rockwell and other Mormons in comics|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865586093/Mormon-culture-artists-discussed-at-Salt-Lake-Comic-Con.html?pg=all|accessdate=July 13, 2016|date=September 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first comic book adaptation of ''A Study in Scarlet'' was in ''Classic Comic''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s 33rd issue, drawn by Louis Zansky. Zanksy's adaptation did not feature Mormons prominently, but the 1953 version of the story by Seymour Moskowitz did. A 1995 adaptation by Ricard Longaron ''Une etude en rouge'' and a 2010 adaptation by Ian Edgington and N. J. Culbard also depict Mormons as manipulative.&lt;ref name="Homer"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Homer|first1=Michael W.|title=The Mormon Image in Comics|journal=Sunstone|date=September 2010|pages=68–73|url=https://www.sunstonemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/articles/160-68-73.pdf|accessdate=July 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mormons are also negatively portrayed in [[Chick Publications]]'s small 1984 comic booklet "The Visitors" in which two Mormon missionaries fail to convert their investigator when the investigator's niece asks them about more controversial Mormon doctrines.&lt;ref name=Homer/&gt;

The popular Italian comic book series ''[[Tex Willer]],'' set in the American West, mentions Mormons, [[Danite]]s, and the [[Mountain Meadows massacre]].&lt;ref name="Homer"/&gt;

Other portrayals of Mormons in comics are references to current events or places. Published in the 1970s, issue #23 of [[Howard the Duck]] contains a duo who parody Don and Marie [[The Osmonds|Osmond]] called the Dearth Vapors, who suffocate their opponents with the sweetness that comes out of their mouths.&lt;ref name="Mann 2016"/&gt; "Godzilla, King of Monsters" #13 depicted Godzilla and another monster leaving the Salt Lake temple in ruins on the cover. In the actual comic, the temple was not destroyed.&lt;ref name="Mann 2016"/&gt; In a ''Captain America'' comic book published in 1980 in issue #246, Joe Smith seeks revenge on Martin Harris for the death of his son, Joseph Smith Jr. While Joseph Smith Sr. never tried to kill Martin Harris, the names and situation are inspired by Mormon history.&lt;ref name="Mann 2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mann|first1=Court Mann|title=As it turns out, Mormons and comic books have a long history together|url=http://www.heraldextra.com/entertainment/books-and-literature/as-it-turns-out-mormons-and-comic-books-have-a/article_786854da-be15-5cae-91b6-75ff884f041a.html|accessdate=October 26, 2016|work=Daily Herald|date=October 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some characters in comic books are Mormon to add interest to their character. A Kickstarter-funded comic, ''Salt City Strangers'', follows five superheroes who explore Mormonism in different ways; none of the creators themselves are Mormon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FAQ – Salt City Strangers|url=https://saltcitystrangers.com/faq/|website=Salt City Strangers|accessdate=October 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mann 2016"/&gt; The series draws on local history and legends, with characters like "the gull" (a reference to the [[Miracle of the gulls]]) and "Den Mother" (a name for a women who leads [[Cub Scouting (Boy Scouts of America)|cub scouts]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Springer|first1=Alex|title=FanX 2014: Chris Hoffman talks Salt City Strangers|url=http://www.slugmag.com/festival-coverage/fanx-2014-chris-hoffman-talks-salt-city-strangers/|accessdate=January 19, 2017|work=SLUG Magazine|date=April 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Stripling Warrior''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s superhero is a gay Mormon. Artist James Neish said he wanted "to show that a gay character is every bit as worthy in the eyes of God as any heterosexual one."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nichols|first1=JamesMichael|title=Meet The World's First Gay Mormon Superhero|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/meet-the-worlds-first-gay-mormon-superhero_us_569d3f96e4b0b4eb759f6a50|accessdate=January 19, 2017|work=The Huffington Post|date=January 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writer Brian Anderson said that the series was based on his own experiences as a gay Mormon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Allen|first1=Samantha|title=This World Needs This Gay Mormon Superhero|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/01/31/this-world-needs-this-gay-mormon-superhero.html|website=The Daily Beast|accessdate=January 19, 2017|date=January 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the alternate-history [[Captain Confederacy]] comic, Dr. Deseret is a Mormon who boldly contradicts polygamous Mormon men and suffers from an addiction to performance-enhancing drugs. A Mormon police detective, Jacob Raven, appears in ''Spider-man: The Lost Years''. Mallory Brook, a Mormon lawyer in the same [[Goodman, Lieber, Kurtzberg &amp; Holliway|law firm]] as [[She-Hulk]], is a prominent character in the series.&lt;ref name="Mann 2016"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Book, Mallory – Marvel Universe Wiki: The definitive online source for Marvel super hero bios.|url=http://marvel.com/universe/Book,_Mallory|website=marvel.com|publisher=Marvel|accessdate=January 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comics by Mormon artists==
===Versions of the Book of Mormon in comics===
John Held Sr. (father of [[John Held Jr.]]) contributed illustrations to the 1888 ''The Story of the Book of Mormon''.&lt;ref name="Nelson"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nelson|first1=Glen|title=Jazz-Age Cartoonery: John Held, Jr. and the ''New Yorker''|journal=Sunstone|date=September 2010|issue=160|pages=2–5|url=https://www.sunstonemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/articles/160-30-31.pdf|accessdate=July 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Philip Dalby published an unfinished comic version of the Book of Mormon published in the [[Deseret News]] starting in 1947. Strips filled a full newspaper [[Broadside (printing)|broadside]]. Publication was sporadic after 1948, and the last strip was published in 1953. Dalby followed the Book of Mormon chronologically; he started his series in Ether and covered 1 Nephi through 3 Nephi 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parshall|first1=Ardis|title=John Philip Darby: Musician, Storyteller, Artist|journal=Sunstone|date=September 2010|issue=160|page=54|url=https://www.sunstonemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/articles/160-54.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Herald Publishing House, owned by the [[Community of Christ|Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]], also published a pictorial version of the Book of Mormon in 1947. The book by Henry Anderson was called ''The First Americans'' and summarized the Book of Mormon.&lt;ref name="Homer"/&gt;

Ric Estrada wrote a fill-in story for DC's ''GI Combat'' in #169 called "Peace with Honor," which recounted a Book of Mormon story where Shiz and Coriantumr battle to the death.&lt;ref name="Homer"/&gt; Mormon missionaries used a page from the story to teach potential converts about the gospel,&lt;ref name="Mann 2016"/&gt; and in 1980, Estrada illustrated ''New Testament Stories'' for the LDS Church.

In the 21st century, several artists have tried their hand at adapting Book of Mormon stories to comics. In 2004 and 2005 [[Mike Allred]] created and published ''The Golden Plates'', a three-volume, twelve-part comic book series that covers the Book of Mormon events from First Nephi to the Words of Mormon.&lt;ref name="Homer"/&gt; His wife [[Laura Allred]] colored the comics. The series is unfinished and out of print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2011/10/11/book_of_mormon_by_michael_allred_the_golden_plates.html|title= The Book of Mormon, Superhero-style|first= David|last= Weigel|date= October 11, 2011|publisher= ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]''|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130305051033/http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2011/10/11/book_of_mormon_by_michael_allred_the_golden_plates.html|archivedate= March 5, 2013|deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; A unique aspect of these comics is the presence of Mormon women who are portrayed as being hard-working and intelligent.

Carter, editor of ''[[Sunstone (magazine)|Sunstone]]'' and artist [[Jett Atwood]] published two volumes of ''Book of Mormon'' comics in 2012 and 2015 respectively, telling stories from the [[Book of Mosiah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Second iplates offers another Book of Mormon graphic novel|url=http://www.standard.net/Faith/2015/01/09/Second-iplates-offers-another-Book-of-Mormon-graphic-novel|accessdate=February 1, 2017|work=Standard-Examiner}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2012, Michael Mercer published ''From the Dust'', the beginning of what was to be an ambitious retelling of the ''Book of Mormon'', but the project was halted in 2014 due to a lack of marketing funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mercer|first1=Michael|title=From the Dust|url=http://mikescrazyideas.com/from-the-dust/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170713102949/http://mikescrazyideas.com/from-the-dust|dead-url=yes|archive-date=July 13, 2017|website=Mike's Crazy Ideas|accessdate=February 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mormon church history in comics===
In 1948, Deseret Book Company published ''Blazing the Pioneer Trail'' with text by Floyd Larson and illustrations by Forrest Hill. The comic booklet contained a faithful account of the [[Mormon pioneers#Vanguard company of 1847|Mormon migration]] in 1847. Eileen Chabot Wendel also published comic book episodes from the Book of Mormon in her ''Stories from the Golden Records''.&lt;ref name="Homer"/&gt; Ric Estrada wrote and illustrated Mormon material for [[DC Comics]] in his story "The Mormon Battalion" in No. 135 of ''Our Fighting Forces''. Sal Velluto, an artist who has worked for DC and Marvel, was an art director for [[The Friend (LDS magazine)|The Friend]].&lt;ref name="Homer"/&gt; In his ''Blammo #7'', published in 2011, [[Noah Van Sciver]] portrays the [[First Vision]], the [[Angel Moroni]] visiting Smith, and the publishing of the Book of Mormon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jepson|first1=Theric|title=Two New Comics|url=http://www.motleyvision.org/2011/two-new-comics/|website=www.motleyvision.org|publisher=A Motley Vision|accessdate=February 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Check Sunstone's archives in 2018 to see if it was also published there--&gt;

[[Sex trafficking]]&lt;ref name="state17" /&gt; and [[child prostitution]]&lt;ref name="havoc" /&gt; are problems in the country.

==Closure of spas==
Following complaints that sexual services were being offered in spas in hotels, and a protest in the capital, [[Malé]], by the opposition [[Adhaalath Party]], the government ordered the closure of the spas in 1,000 hotels in late December 2011.&lt;ref name="coconuts" /&gt;&lt;ref name="beeb"&gt;{{cite web|title=Maldives overturns spa closures|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-16414737|website=BBC News|accessdate=27 January 2018|date=4 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Maldives tourism industry denies spas are brothels|url=https://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/01/02/185868.html|website=Al Arabiya News|accessdate=27 January 2018|date=2 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following pressure from the country's tourism industry, president [[Mohamed Nasheed]] lifted the ban a few days later.&lt;ref name="beeb" /&gt;

==Child prostitution==
Child prostitution is a problem in the country,&lt;ref name="havoc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Child Prostitution in the Maldives - Havocscope|url=https://www.havocscope.com/child-prostitution-in-the-maldives/|website=Havocscope|accessdate=27 January 2018|date=24 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially in Malé and in the [[Laamu Atoll]] region.&lt;ref name="minivan"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Naish|first1=Ahmed|title=Maldives facing widespread child prostitution, sexual abuse: clinical psychologist|url=https://minivannewsarchive.com/society/maldives-facing-widespread-child-prostitution-sexual-abuse-clinical-psychologist-59956|website=Minivan News|date=23 June 2013 |accessdate=27 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Psychologist  Dr Aishath Ali Naaz, it is so common in some areas that its regarded as 'normal'.&lt;ref name="minivan" /&gt; Often the prostitution is arranged by family members.&lt;ref name="havoc" /&gt;

The HRCM estimate 8% of female prostitutes on the island are underage.&lt;ref name="vnews" /&gt;

==Legal situation==
Article 88(a) of the Maldivian Penal Code 1967&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Maldives Penal Code|url=http://www.track.unodc.org/LegalLibrary/LegalResources/Maldives/Laws/Maldives%20Penal%20Code%201968.pdf|website=[[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]]|accessdate=27 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; includes [[Sharia Law]] into the country's legislation. Sex outside marriage is outlawed under Sharia Law, as are other forms of 'immorality', therefore prostitution is forbidden.&lt;ref name="spl" /&gt;

Public order and immigration laws are also used against sex workers.&lt;ref name="spl" /&gt; Foreigners who engage in [[prostitution]] can expect to be deported and [[Maldives|Maldivians]] can expect a prison sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Prostitution on the rise in the Maldives|work= [[Minivan Daily]]|date= |url= http://minivannews.com/news-in-brief/prostitution-on-the-rise-in-the-maldives-1690|accessdate= 2011-09-18|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120312081856/http://minivannews.com/news-in-brief/prostitution-on-the-rise-in-the-maldives-1690|archive-date= 12 March 2012|deadurl= yes|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lbo"&gt;{{cite news|title= Maldives nab foreigners for prostitution|work= Lanka Business Online|date=|url= http://www.lbo.lk/fullstory.php?nid=1810088278|accessdate=2011-09-18  |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120323220337/http://www.lbo.lk/fullstory.php?nid=1810088278 |archive-date= 23 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst [[condoms]] are allowed to be sold to married couples, they cannot be sold to single people.&lt;ref name="spl" /&gt; Condoms and [[Personal lubricant|lubricants]] are sometimes confiscated by the police and used as evidence of prostitution.&lt;ref name="lbo" /&gt;

==Sex trafficking==
{{see also|Human trafficking in the Maldives}}
The Maldives are a destination country for women, and children subjected to sex trafficking, and a source country for women and children subjected to sex trafficking. A small number of women from Asia, Central Asia, and Eastern Europe, as well as girls from [[Bangladesh]] and Maldives, are subjected to sex trafficking in the Maldives. Maldivian women may be subjected to sex trafficking in [[Sri Lanka]].&lt;ref name="state17"&gt;{{cite web|title=Maldives 2017 Trafficking in Persons Report|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2017/271236.htm|website=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=27 January 2018}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Thailand|Thai]] hotelier reported in 2013 that Thai women were being recruited with offers for good jobs in the Maldives, but on arrival being [[forced prostitution|forced into prostitution]].&lt;ref name="coconuts" /&gt;

The Prevention of Human Trafficking Act (PHTA) criminalises some, but not all forms, of sex trafficking. For the first time, in 2016, the government secured a conviction under the PHTA. Three foreign nationals were each sentenced to 10 years imprisonment in a sex trafficking case.&lt;ref name="state17" /&gt;

In November 2016, the Sri Lanka Foreign Employment Bureau (SLFEB) arrested 2 men in connection with trafficking Sri Lankan women to the Maldives, where they worked in [[brothel]]s. More than 100 women were thought to be involved. A Maldivian man was also being sought.&lt;ref name="avas"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sri lanka busts major prostitution ring linked to Maldives|url=https://avas.mv/en/25781|website=Avas|accessdate=27 January 2018|date=17 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Department of State]] [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] ranks the Maldives as a '[[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|Tier 2 Watch List]]' country.&lt;ref name="state18"&gt;{{cite web |title=Maldives 2018 Trafficking in Persons Report |url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2018/282702.htm |website=U.S. Department of State |accessdate=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Spruchdichtung''' or '''Sangspruchdichtung''' is the German term for a genre of [[Middle High German]] sung verse. An individual work in this genre is called a '''Spruch''' (plural ''Sprüche''), literally a "saying", and may consist of one or more [[strophe]]s.{{sfn|Garland|Garland|1976|p=815}}

While closely associated with the lyric genre [[Minnesang]], its theme is not love, but rather 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
the Spruch treated predominantly of rational, didactic and pragmatic issues, including, for example, socio-political commentary, topics related to moral or religious teaching and philosophy, practical wisdom, biographical material, praise of patrons, begging and much else besides.{{sfn|Klippenberg}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Where the texts offer general moral comment, they may also be considered [[gnomic poetry]], while works directed at particular personages or issues are rather [[political poetry]].

The most important medieval collection of Sprüche is the [[Jenaer Liederhandschrift]] (MS J), which also has a large number of Spruch melodies.

==The Poets==
The main poets working in this genre are:{{sfn|Dunphy|pp=845–6}}
* Spervogel
* [[Herger]]
* [[Walther von der Vogelweide]] 
* Bruder Wernher
* Der Marner
* [[Konrad von Würzburg]]
* [[Heinrich Frauenlob|Heinrich von Meißen (Frauenlob)]]
* [[Reinmar von Zweter]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5633">Television is one of the [[Mass media|major mass media]] of [[Chile]]. It was [[Timeline of the introduction of television in countries|introduced in 1957]].

There are 63 [[Television station|broadcast stations]] throughout the country (plus 121 repeaters) (1997).&lt;!--&lt;ref name="CIA"&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2007-02-29

|title=Chile
}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; The [[broadcast television system]] used is [[NTSC]].

The primary regulator of television content is the National Television Council (CNTV). The technical aspects are regulated by the Ministry of Transportation and Telecommunications, through the Undersecretariat of Telecommunications (Subtel).

==History==
The first television transmission in Chile took place on October 5, 1957, from the [[Catholic University of Valparaíso]]'s main campus, giving birth to [[UCV TV|UCV]], the country's first [[television channel]]. Two years later, on August 21, 1959, the [[Catholic University of Chile]] made an experimental transmission between its main campus and the ''[[El Mercurio]]'' newspaper headquarters, both in [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]]'s downtown, inaugurating the country's second channel, [[Canal 13 (Chile)|Canal 13]], occupying frequency 2 for a few years (now 13).

Color television debuted in February 6, 1978.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umatic.cl/histch6.html El Umatic llega a Chile] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304003525/http://www.umatic.cl/histch6.html |date=2016-03-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Users==
According to the 2002 census, 87% of Chilean households had at least one [[color television]] set. According to a November–December 2011 nationwide poll by CEP, 88.6% of Chilean households had at least one color television set, 0.9% didn't and 10.5% did not answer. Sixty percent of those households that said they owned at least one color TV set also said they had cable or satellite television.

==Cable/satellite television==
In Chile, there are 1,138,718 [[cable television]] subscribers (55.3%) and 921,490 [[satellite television]] subscribers (44.7%) as of September 2011. The household penetration rate for cable and satellite television stands at 40.4% as of September 2011.&lt;ref name="subtel"/&gt;

== Digital television ==
On 14 September 2009, Chile announced its decision to adopt the Japanese standard [[ISDB-T]] with [[MPEG-4]] for digital terrestrial television, joining Argentina and Peru.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tercera.com/contenido/745_181726_9.shtml |title=Chile adopta versión japonesa de TV Digital y nueva norma parte en 2010 |publisher=La Tercera |date= |accessdate=2012-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[analog switchoff]] is scheduled for 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cooperativa.cl/prontus_nots/site/artic/20090914/pags/20090914113715.html |title=Apagón analógico se producirá recién en 2017 |publisher=Radio Cooperativa |date= |accessdate=2012-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Chile had delayed its decision on which [[digital terrestrial television]] standard to adopt. In late October 2008, the President submitted a bill to Congress detailing the legal framework for DTTV broadcasting in the country, but without defining which standard would be used.)

[[TVN (Chile)|TVN]], Chile's state-owned channel, has made digital terrestrial television broadcast tests since 1999. [[Canal 13 (Chile)|Canal 13]] has been doing so since 2007 in [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]] only, transmitting in three DTV formats ([[ATSC]], [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]] and [[ISDB]]). In [[Valparaiso]], [[UCV TV]] was to start in June 2010 demonstrative ISDB-Tb broadcasting for the Valparaíso/Viña del Mar area, using an 800 watts transmitter.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

[[HDTV]]-ready television sets are widely sold in Chile, and [[cable television|cable]] and [[satellite television]] companies transmit limited HD content to its subscribers (27 HD channels in [[VTR Chile|VTR]] (2 national-free, 4 Premiums, 21 basic), the country's largest cable TV provider).

'''''The Blues Brothers''''' is a video game based on the band [[The Blues Brothers]], where the object is to evade police in order to make it to a blues concert. The game was released for [[IBM PC compatible|IBM PC]], [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Amiga]], [[Commodore 64]] and [[Atari ST]] in {{vgy|1991}}, for the [[NES]] in {{vgy|1992}}, for the [[SNES]] in {{vgy|1993}} and for the [[Game Boy]] in {{vgy|1992}}. It was created by [[Titus France]]. A sequel, ''[[The Blues Brothers: Jukebox Adventure]]'', was released for [[DOS]] and for the [[Game Boy]] in {{vgy|1994}}.

==Gameplay==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:The Blues Brothers (video game) first level gameplay demo.gif|thumb|left|alt=The Blues Brothers game play demo on the first level of the game|320px|Gameplay demo of the first level.]] --&gt;
The characters have the ability to pick up boxes to throw them at enemies. Each level is a variation on the jumping theme, with the characters finding a necessary attribute (e.g. a guitar) somewhere in the level. The sixth and final level ends on-stage.

The game can be played by two players simultaneously, but the scrolling screen only focuses on one of them.

The game's soundtrack consists of music from the movie. [[Dimitris Yerasimos]] composed the music for all versions of the game except for Blues Brothers: Jukebox Adventure on Game Boy, where [[Thorsten Mitschele]] composed the music.

'''''The Gong Show with Dave Attell''''' was a revival of the 1970s [[Chuck Barris]] [[comedy]] [[game show]] called ''[[The Gong Show]]'', hosted by [[Dave Attell|comedian Dave Attell]]. The show premiered on July 17, 2008. It was produced by [[Adam Sandler]]'s production company [[Happy Madison Productions]] and [[Sony Pictures Television]].

==Show format==
Faithful to the classic format, each show presented a contest between amateur performers of often dubious talent, with a panel of three celebrity judges. If any judge considered an act to be particularly bad, he or she could strike a large [[gong]], thus forcing the performer to stop and eliminating that contestant from the competition.

If the act survived without being gonged, the performers were given a score by each of the three judges on a scale of 0 to 500 (instead of 0 to 10), for a maximum possible score of 1,500. The contestant who achieved the highest combined score won the grand prize of $600 and a "''Gong Show'' Championship Belt" trophy.

The last act of each show (which was interrupted by a siren and the doors closing) was usually performed by [[David Juskow]].

The scores and prizes were brought out by Prize Girls [[Heidi Van Horne]] and Amy Harwick.

Comedian [[Michelle Biloon]] interviewed the participants backstage, mainly for the website, but clips of the interviews were played over each episode's credits.

===Judges===
Among the new show's celebrity judges were [[J.B. Smoove]], [[Dave Navarro]], [[Andy Dick]], [[Steve Schirripa]], [[Brian Posehn]], [[Ron White]], [[Jim Norton (American comedian)|Jim Norton]], [[Adam Carolla]], [[Kate Walsh (actress)|Kate Walsh]], [[Triumph the Insult Comic Dog]], and [[Greg Giraldo]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news.aspx?date=07/02/08&amp;id=20080702comedycentral01 The Futon Critic]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvsquad.com/2008/07/02/the-gong-show-announces-celebrity-judges/ TV Squad: "The Gong Show" announces celebrity judges]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Last Airbender''''' is a [[video game]] based on the [[The Last Airbender|film of the same name]] for the [[Wii]] and [[Nintendo DS]]. It was released on June 29, 2010 in North America, in Europe on August 6, 2010, and in Australia on September 9, 2010. Like the previous ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender]]'' games, it was developed by [[THQ Studio Australia]] and published by [[THQ]]. It received mixed to average reviews, with many critics calling it an improvement over the movie.

== Gameplay ==
Players get to play as [[Aang]], Prince [[Zuko]], and the Blue Spirit (an alter-ego of Zuko). Players play as Aang to use amazing Airbending powers such as Air Vortexes and Tornados to manipulate the environment and control the elements, playing as Prince Zuko uses destructive Firebending bombs, blasts and more to battle for power and playing as the Blue Spirit uses stealth moves and sword attacks.

The game received average reviews. Video game talk show ''[[Good Game (television series)|Good Game]]'''s presenters gave the Wii version a score of 4.5 and 4 out of 10. They criticized the absence of being able to block attacks, believing such a feature would've been easy to include. They also pointed out that the levels felt repetitive. The Avatar State was also perceived as annoying due to requiring players to repeat the sequence every time a mistake was made. The character's controls were also criticized for being too sensitive which led to unfair deaths. The Blue Spirit was specifically criticized for his difficulty to turn around when in stealth mode. While the co-op arena mode was enjoyed by Good Game due to its simplicity, they felt disappointed with the lack of co-op in story mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Last Airbender Review|credits=Bendixsen 4.5/10, O'Donnell 4/10|network=[[ABC Television]]|airdate=25 September 2010|season=1|number=32|transcripturl=http://www.abc.net.au/abc3/goodgamesp/transcripts/s3020234.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviews for the game were generally much more positive than those of the film.

'''''The Rub Rabbits!''''', known in Japan as {{nihongo|'''''Aka-chan wa Doko Kara Kuru no?'''''|赤ちゃんはどこからくるの?||"Where do Babies Come From?"}}, is a [[minigame]] compilation [[video game]] developed by [[Sonic Team]] and published by [[Sega]] for the [[Nintendo DS]] handheld [[video game console]]. It was first released in Japan on October 20, 2005, and was later released in Europe on February 10, 2006, and in North America three days later. It is a prequel to ''[[Feel the Magic: XY/XX]]''.

==Plot==
The premise of the game is that the player's female love interest gets into perilous situations or is placed out of reach from the male protagonist. A minigame must be completed in order to rescue her, or sometimes, get the male protagonist out of trouble. All of these minigames require use of the stylus, and the [[Nintendo DS|DS]] to be held in a certain way, even upside-down. Some require use of the DS built-in microphone.

At the beginning, the protagonist is riding down an escalator when he sees an attractive woman riding the opposite escalator. He immediately falls in love with her, and races back up the escalator to chase her. Upon reaching the top, he professes his love with a rose, but discovers twelve competitors who are also smitten with the heroine. He attempts to prove his uniqueness over the others by playing a nearby piano, the first of several acts he performs to get her attention. His rivals respond by dropping in on parachutes when the heroine is walking down the street, only to be shot down by the protagonist, who appears from a nearby manhole, using a blowgun. Later, an unknown man hands the protagonist a "love disc" which he throws at the heroine to increase her affection for him

Some time later, the protagonist is attempting to seduce the heroine in a local park, and his rivals have caught wind of his plan and are rushing over to stop him. On the way, the rivals knock over a mysterious girl in a lavender dress, who falls toward the park fountain. Before she falls in, the protagonist saves her, then rushes off toward the heroine. The girl falls in love with him at first sight, and appears to recognize him as he leaves. Meanwhile, the protagonist attempts to make eye contact with the heroine while his rivals form a ring around her to block him. Despite their attempts, he manages to catch her attention, and begins walking alongside her. Frustrated, his rivals challenge him to a manly contest of rock-paper-scissors for the right to be with the heroine. After defeating them, they are left exhausted on the floor, but the protagonist helps them back up. For his gentlemanly attitude, the rivals decide that he is worthy of the heroine, and subsequently befriend him, supporting his relationship with her. 

While walking with his newfound companions, the protagonist finds the heroine watching a fireworks display across the river, unaware of his presence. Encouraged by his friends, he takes advantage of the romantic mood to confess his feelings for her, and she accepts his confession, marking the beginning of their official relationship.

However, his friends who have been watching and cheering from behind them are suddenly trapped in a purple cage and flown off by helicopter to an unknown location. Here, the lavender-dressed girl uses a machine to control their minds, turning them into her servants. She commands them to capture the protagonist and bring him to her. 

Later, the protagonist goes on a date with his new girlfriend, trying to impress her with a daring unicycle stunt. He attempts to cycle across the scaffolding between the roofs of two buildings, to take a picture with his girlfriend who is on the other side. While he rides, his brainwashed friends climb the scaffolding to abduct him and he must dodge them on his way to the heroine. Having thwarted this attempt, the protagonist and heroine continue their date, riding a bull together. Once again, the brainwashed attackers try to interfere, donning bull masks and chasing after the couple, who must fend them off while not attacking the gentlemen walking down the same street. After many minions are defeated, a large purple robotic bull enters, ridden by the lavender-dressed girl, who launches love potions at the protagonist. The robotic bull is eventually defeated and the couple ride off.

The bull ride ends when the heroine notices her house, introducing the protagonist to her parents. While in the house, she does yoga to relax, aided by the protagonist who holds a rose to her nose to soothe her. However, the lavender-dressed girl arrives at the house, and passes a cable through the window to infect the heroine's computer with a virus which opens windows rapidly while the protagonist tries to close them. He soon discovers the girl squatting outside the window and jumps out to confront her when her minions knock him unconscious, and another purple cage drops on all of them. The protagonist is then taken with his brainwashed friends to another unknown location.

Upon waking up, the protagonist is tied to a chair, with the lavender-dressed girl sitting on a table in front of him and staring at him intensely. She reminds him that they've met before, and he remembers her as the genius girl who used to live next to him ten years ago. She exclaims that he's gotten handsome, and invites him to fall in love with her, throwing various food items across the table at him. Her own rancidly bad cooking is mixed in with actual food items, and the protagonist must avoid the bad items while consuming the good ones. Taking him to a different part of what is revealed to be her mansion, she continues to press her invitation, more impatiently this time, while shooting him with love potions from an array of cannons. As the tied-up protagonist dodges her potions by rolling around, she becomes increasingly agitated, eventually jumping at the protagonist herself, which knocks her unconscious while her minions rush over to help. The protagonist takes advantage of this distraction to untie himself and escape, but upon leaving the mansion he finds himself in a large jungle. 

Confused, the protagonist comes to a river, when he sees his girlfriend, the heroine, waving at him from upstream. He is surprised at her presence, and rows to her on a log while dodging crocodiles and other river objects. When he reaches her, she explains that she also rushed out the window when he was knocked unconscious, and was thus trapped in the same cage which delivered him here. Together, they explore the jungle in search of food, working together to harvest fruits from a tall tree. As they eat the fruit and chat, the lavender girl is shown to have discovered their location, riding on her helicopter. While exploring, they find a spring of water and the heroine decides to take a dip, stripping to her underwear. Unbeknownst to her, the lavender girl releases piranhas and other dangerous fish into the spring, which the protagonist must divert with his finger as a lure. The heroine finishes her dip, and the protagonist makes her new clothes from leaves of different shapes. They continue exploring the jungle, and discover an ancient temple. While walking to the temple, they trigger a pit trap which leads them on a minecart ride through the temple, after which they exit, having grown closer. 

Frustrated by their relationship progressing, the lavender girl watches the couple from behind the bushes while they sit in a tree and flirt. She comes up with an idea, and interrupts their flirting with a blast from a cannon mounted on a boat. They fall into the water nearby, and the protagonist rescues the heroine from having her leg trapped in a giant clam. As they swim back to shore, the minions prepare to attack, but suddenly run away. The couple turns to see a large number of crabs coming from the water, and the protagonist climbs a tree and shakes minions off to knock down chasing crabs. After the horde of crabs is defeated, a large purple robotic lobster appears to climb the tree, but is defeated as well. The concussions from falling from the trees cure the minions of their brainwashing, and they return to being friend with the protagonist. As the protagonist reunites with his friends and girlfriend, the lavender girl climbs out of the robotic lobster, and fires a poisoned dart from a blowgun at the heroine, who collapses unconscious in the protagonist's lap.

Some time later, the heroine's parents receive word that she was poisoned with a serum which will cause her to slowly lose her memories, and the antidote is made from a yellow rose found high up in the mountains. The protagonist journeys with his friends and girlfriend to find the rose and restore her memories. On the snowy mountain trek they encounter many difficulties, such as hiding from bears, staying awake during the cold nights, and tripping and becoming human snowballs. Throughout the journey, the heroine occasionally looks at the picture she took with the protagonist, and the memories she can recall of him decrease in number each time. After she is rescued from rolling down the mountain by the protagonist, they are separated from their companions and spend a night together in a wooden shed and he keeps her warm first with a blanket and later with his body heat. They have a snowball fight and flirt on a tree, after which their friends catch up to them. As they continue their journey, the heroine falls and slides down the mountain, causing the protagonist to chase after her on a sled pulled by his friends. They continue the arduous journey until they finally spot the yellow rose after climbing a cliff. As the protagonist reaches for it, he is interrupted by a large purple robotic bear, which battles him with several inbuilt cannons. He destroys it with snowballs and reaches for the flower, but is stopped by a gigantic purple robotic bird, which scoops up himself, the flower and the snow around it before flying off. 

The protagonist is tied up and brought to another section of the mountain where the lavender girl awaits, declaring that the rose is hers now and he should fall in love with her at last. She personally throws love potions at him, which he destroys by kicking them with his feet while his upper body remains tied. She grows increasingly desperate as he destroys her potions, and finally breaks down, asking him why he rejects her advances, to which he responds that he only loves his girlfriend. Out of spite, the lavender girl runs off with the yellow rose toward her robotic bird, which promptly takes off, with the protagonist chasing after it. As the protagonist chases the bird to a rope bridge, an army of robots on the other side begin crossing the bridge to attack him. He defends himself by using a torch and gasoline from several nearby gentlemen to breathe fire at the robots, destroying them one by one. Meanwhile, back at the original location of the rose, his girlfriend is losing more and more of her memories, forgetting even the confession made under the fireworks which led to their relationship. The only memories that remain are those made on the mountain itself. The protagonist continues chasing the bird through a valley, defeating robots as they appear in a similar fashion to the masked minions during the bull ride. As he is about to be defeated, his friends arrive and fight off the remainder of the robots, which then transform into spherical forms and attempt to run them over. The protagonist redirects one of the robots to catch up to and destroy the others, but by this time the lavender girl has flown off with the rose on her robot bird. She notes that by this time the heroine will have lost all her memories, and, confident in her victory, she shreds the rose and scatters its petals in the wake of the bird's flight.

The protagonist meets up with his girlfriend, the heroine, but she collapses in his arms once more, leaving him heartbroken. However, as he mourns the loss of her memories, his friends notice the petals of the yellow rose falling from the sky, and they mobilize to search the nearby rose field for the yellow rose's petals. Collecting the entire rose, they finally concoct the antidote, which the protagonist delivers to the unconscious heroine via mouth-to-mouth. It succeeds in reviving her and restoring her memories, and she kisses him while his friends celebrate around them. 

However, nearby, the lavender girl watches them and is furious that they have thwarted her plans and continue to be happy together. With her robot bird, her strongest invention, she fires at the couple, but they do not back down, beginning the final battle (and final minigame) against the bird and its many weapons. To attack, the couple join hands and spin, creating whirlwinds which strike the bird, while dodging the bird's attacks, first cannons, then walking bombs, and lastly eye beams once it reveals its head. Eventually, the bird is defeated, and with it, the lavender girl, who ejects from it and lands haphazardly on the ground. While she lies face-down, a hand reaches out to her to help her up. Believing it to be the protagonist finally acknowledging her, she is frustrated to find that it is just one of his friends. Meanwhile, the protagonist and heroine reaffirm their feelings for each other, culminating in a kiss which triggers the ending sequence of the game.

==Gameplay==
Some examples of these minigames are:
*The male protagonist runs up a downward moving escalator, and must avoid [[Sumo]] wrestlers along the way by moving left and right. There is a similar variation where he paddles up a river avoiding giant [[crocodile]]s.
*The mysterious girl in lavender ties the protagonist to a chair and throws various food items at him. He must avoid eating the purple cakes, but can eat the other morsels like pizzas and white-iced cakes.
*The female love interest performs yoga, while the male protagonist tries to keep a sweet-smelling rose within the range of her sense of smell.

The player's performance is graded as amount of 'Hearts', which are given at the end of a minigame depending on how well they did.

There are a few multiplayer minigames which involve four differently coloured protagonists competing over the love interest, such as an elimination based game of catching an ever-growing beach ball which eventually explodes, and log rafting while trying to rescue the female from the water, while trying to steal her from other player's log rafts.

==Plot==
A [[brahmin]] passes a [[tiger]] in a trap. The tiger pleads for his release, promising not to eat the brahmin. The brahmin sets him free but no sooner is the tiger out of the cage then he says he is going to eat the brahmin, going back on his promise.  The brahmin is horrified and tells the tiger how unjust he is. They agree to ask the first three things they encounter to judge between them.  The first thing they encounter is a [[tree]], who, having suffered at the hands of humans, answers that the tiger should eat the brahmin. Next a [[Water Buffalo|buffalo]], exploited and mistreated by humans, agrees it is only just that the brahmin should be eaten.  Finally they meet a [[jackal]] who, sympathetic to the brahmin's plight, at first feigns incomprehension of what has happened and asks to see the trap. Once there he claims he still doesn't understand. The tiger gets back in the trap to demonstrate and the jackal quickly shuts him in, suggesting to the brahmin that they leave matters thus.

'''The Unholy Three''' are a magic cabaret trio composed of [[Magician (illusion)|magicians]] [[David Lovering]] (drummer of the [[Pixies]]), [[Rob Zabrecky]] (former songwriter/singer/bassist of [[Possum Dixon]]) and [[Fitzgerald (magician)|Fitzgerald]] (creator of the cult cable television show "O'Brien's People" and author of "Bachelor 2000").&lt;ref&gt;http://www.geniimagazine.com/magicpedia/Rob_Zabrecky&lt;/ref&gt; The trio formed in 2003 at the [[Magic Castle]] in [[Hollywood]] by presenting a quickly paced provocative [[Dada]]-esque combination of wizardry, mentalism and off-beat humor.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.papermag.com/2007/11/test_do_not_post.php&lt;/ref&gt; The trio has been praised by the magic community which includes favorable reviews by luminaries [[Penn Jillette]] (Penn &amp; Teller), [[Max Maven]] and [[Milt Larsen]]. In addition to their performances at the Magic Castle, they perform at colleges and universities throughout the United States.&lt;ref&gt;http://media.www.elpaisanonewspaper.com/media/storage/paper1088/news/2007/11/07/Entertainment/The-Unholy.Three-3085531.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2005, they released a performance DVD produced by Carlos Grasso (Carl Grasso), featuring a whimsical introduction by [[Grant Lee Phillips]]. Additionally, they have been profiled in [[Magic Magazine]], the [[LA Weekly]] and other publications. 
 
In October 2006, they presented highlights of their show to audiences in the Magic Castle's [[Parlour of Prestidigitation]].  In May 2007, they performed to a sold-out crowd at [[The Steve Allen Theater]] in Hollywood.&lt;ref&gt;http://laist.com/2005/08/11/the_unholy_three.php{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1978">A '''theatrical production''' is any work of [[theatre]], such as a staged play, musical, comedy or drama produced from a written book or script.

These productions generally feature actors, costumes and sets. The [[History of theatre|history of the theatrical production]] goes back to [[Theatre of ancient Greece|ancient Greece]].

Theatrical productions vary in many ways. They can be anything from high school as well as college productions, community theatre productions to summer stock and regional theatre productions all the way to Broadway and Kings Road productions. Today's contemporary theatres produce a variety of plays and musicals that attract very different audiences.

In full theatrical productions there are a great number of people working towards many types of shows. A [[Theatrical producer|producer]] acquires financing, hires staff and oversees everything from the beginning to the end of each show. Theatrical staff is separated by department, which varies from theatre to theatre and production to production depending on needs.

The production will employ front of house and back of house staff. In addition to performers, stage hands, [[stage manager]]s, lighting and [[sound technician]]s, many theatres will hire ushers, concessions workers, janitorial and security in mounting a theatrical production.

Theatrical productions may also involve other types of performance exhibitions, which include improvisational, skit and parody performances which involve varying levels of involvement from off-camera staff or assistants in order to create the production.

'''Todd Rogers''' (born December 1, 1964) is an American [[video game]] player from [[Brooksville, Florida|Brooksville]], [[Florida]], who gained fame in the early 1980s for his claim to having many [[world record]] [[high score]]s and for his expertise on [[Activision]] games.&lt;ref name=WR&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/106130-longest-standing-videogame-record |title=Longest-standing videogame record |work=[[Guinness World Records]] |access-date=January 29, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180129171456/http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/106130-longest-standing-videogame-record |archive-date=January 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2013/01/interview-video-game-legend-todd-rogers-talks-about-being-the-first-pro-gamer-ever |title=Interview: Video Game Legend Todd Rogers Talks About Being The First Pro Gamer Ever |last=Moultrie |first=Tamika |journal=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]] |date=January 5, 2013 |access-date=January 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many of his records have been found to be impossible or unverifiable,&lt;ref name=Cheat&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://kotaku.com/doubt-and-drama-still-haunt-an-old-seemingly-impossibl-1796714894 |title=Doubt And Drama Still Haunt An Old, Seemingly Impossible Atari World Record |last=Alexandra |first=Heather |journal=[[Kotaku]] |date=July 7, 2017 |access-date=January 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Barn&gt;{{Cite journal |url=https://boingboing.net/2018/01/24/video-game-record-setter-accus.html |title=Video game record-setter accused of cheating |last=Beschizza |first=Rob |journal=[[Boing Boing]] |date=January 24, 2018 |access-date=January 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on January 29, 2018, [[Twin Galaxies]] removed all of his scores from their leaderboards and banned him permanently.&lt;ref name=TG/&gt; [[Guinness World Records]] stripped his records the following day.&lt;ref name=Alexandra/&gt;

== Gaming career ==
{{Expand section|date=February 2018}}
Rogers is recognized for being the first paid pro video gamer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703988304575413612071687980 |title=City Resorts to Pac-Man for a Reboot |last=Yadron |first=Danny |newspaper=[[Wall Street Journal]] {{subscription required}} |date=August 7, 2010 |accessdate=October 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 25, 1983, Walter Day founded the [[U.S. National Video Game Team]] and in 1986 Rogers was invited to be part of the team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://kotaku.com/5901938/there-was-once-a-us-national-video-game-team-and-this-guy-was-its-captain |title=There was Once a U.S. National Video Game Team, and This Guy Was Its Captain |first=Owen |last=Good |date=April 13, 2012 |accessdate=October 23, 2015 |journal=[[Kotaku]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Gamers: Writers, Artists and Programmers on the Pleasures of Pixels |first=Shanna |last=Compton |publisher=[[Soft Skull Press]] |date=October 26, 2004 |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=-sCO-gODwy4C&amp;printsec=frontcover |pages=280 |isbn=9781932360578}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 3–5, 2008 Todd joined the "Five Kings of Gaming" at the "E for All" Expo at the [[Los Angeles Convention Center]] to feed the homeless people of Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://kotaku.com/5055410/the-league-of-legendary-gamers-fight-hunger-at-e-for-all |title=The League of Legendary Gamers Fight Hunger At E For All |first=Mike |last=Fahey |journal=[[Kotaku]] |date=September 26, 2008 |accessdate=October 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disputed records ==
Several of Todd Rogers' records had come under scrutiny for being seemingly impossible or lacking sufficient proof. As listed on the [[Twin Galaxies]] leaderboard until January 2018, Rogers' record in the 1980 [[Activision]] game ''[[Dragster (video game)|Dragster]]'' was a time of 5.51 seconds from 1982.&lt;ref name=WR/&gt; Previously, in 2012, Rogers was awarded the [[Guinness World Record]] for the longest-standing world record for that record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Gamers on the Edge: Meet Todd Rogers |url=http://www.mor-tv.com/article/gamers-on-the-edge-meet-todd-rogers/9599864 |accessdate=January 30, 2018 |work=[[WMOR-TV]] |date=May 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a [[speedrun]]ner named Eric "Omnigamer" Koziel disassembled the game's code and concluded that the fastest possible time was 5.57 seconds. Previously, Rogers' score was believed to have been verified when he set it in 1982 by a [[Polaroid camera|Polaroid]] photo sent to Activision; however, no copy of the photo exists today.&lt;ref name=Cheat/&gt;

Prior to January 2018, several other Todd Rogers scores have been individually disputed or removed as well. More stringent investigation into Rogers' record-setting scores began when YouTubers uploaded analysis of several of his disputed scores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.twingalaxies.com/feed_details.php/87/dragster-designer-without-a-shadow-of-a-doubt-about-todd-rogers-record/1|title=Dragster Designer David Crane Has No Doubts Of Todd Rogers' Record [UPDATED]|website=Twin Galaxies}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rogers' score of 15 million points in the NES port of ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'' was removed from the Twin Galaxies leaderboard after it was disputed and a referee discovered that the video tapes of the feat were missing or non-existent.&lt;ref name=Cheat/&gt; Rogers' time of 32.04 in ''[[Barnstorming (video game)|Barnstorming]]'' was removed from the Twin Galaxies leaderboard after it was discovered it was impossible to achieve even when all the obstacles are removed.&lt;ref name=Barn/&gt; Other disputed scores included ''Wabbit'' (where he had a recorded score of 1,698, but the game normally ends when the player reaches 1,300 points and the score only increases in increments of 5), ''Fathom'' (where, based upon other players' verified scores and playtimes, his claimed record would have taken over 325 hours of play to achieve), and ''[[Centipede (video game)|Centipede]]'' on the [[Atari 5200]], for which he claimed a score of exactly 65,000,000 (with the next best recorded score being 58,078, 112000% lower than Rogers' claimed record).&lt;ref name=Cheat/&gt;

On January 29, 2018, in the wake of many disputes being raised and several scores being proven impossible, the site decided to remove all of his scores and ban him from the site entirely. They notified [[Guinness World Records]] regarding their decision.&lt;ref name=TG&gt;{{cite news |last=Wang |first=Amy B. |title=A man accused of cheating at video games may lose his Guinness World Record|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2018/01/29/a-man-accused-of-cheating-at-video-games-may-lose-his-decades-old-guinness-world-record/ |accessdate=January 30, 2018 |newspaper=[[Washington Post]] |date=January 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, Guinness stripped all of Rogers' records.&lt;ref name=Alexandra&gt;{{cite news |last=Alexandra |first=Heather |title=Guinness Officially Nixes Todd Rogers' Dragster Records |url=https://kotaku.com/guinness-officially-nixes-todd-rogers-dragster-records-1822568394 |accessdate=February 1, 2018 |journal=[[Kotaku]] |date=January 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''War Front: Turning Point'' is a real-time strategy game featuring units going from [[World War II]] weaponry such as [[Messerschmitt Me 262]] fighter aircraft&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=War Front: Turning Point Manual | editor=[[Digital Reality]] | publisher=[[Cdv Software Entertainment]] | year=2007 | page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[M4 Sherman]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=War Front: Turning Point Manual | editor=Digital Reality | publisher=Cdv Software Entertainment | year=2007 | page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; and T-34 tanks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=War Front: Turning Point Manual | editor=Digital Reality | publisher=Cdv Software Entertainment | year=2007 | page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; to real-life units that were not present during that war such as [[Northrop YB-49]] jet bomber,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=War Front: Turning Point Manual | editor=Digital Reality | publisher=Cdv Software Entertainment | year=2007 | page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; to entirely science fictional units like Exoskeleton mechs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=War Front: Turning Point Manual | editor=Digital Reality | publisher=Cdv Software Entertainment | year=2007 | page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; freeze rays&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=War Front: Turning Point Manual | editor=Digital Reality | publisher=Cdv Software Entertainment | year=2007 | page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; and shield generators,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=War Front: Turning Point Manual | editor=Digital Reality | publisher=Cdv Software Entertainment | year=2007 | page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; while all can build a "Bridging" tank unit capable of building bridges over bodies of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=War Front: Turning Point Manual | editor=Digital Reality | publisher=Cdv Software Entertainment | year=2007 | page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each faction can also build three heroes: individual characters with unique abilities, both passive and active to benefit the player's own units and act against the foe's units. The longer heroes and units remain on the battlefield, destroying units and buildings in the process, the more they can rank up, increasing their abilities, yet lose them if they are killed and re-built.&lt;ref name="book2"/&gt; The player can also use aerial support such as calling in paratrooper reinforcements, scouting runs and bomb strikes.&lt;ref name="book2"&gt;{{cite book | title=War Front: Turning Point Manual | editor=Digital Reality | publisher=Cdv Software Entertainment | year=2007 | pages=13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''War Front: Turning Point'' however has an unconventional RTS feature, being the abilities to manually control pill boxes and turrets to fire upon enemies, like that of a [[first-person shooter]]. The camera can also be ordered to follow other units in a [[Third-person (video games)|third-person]] perspective, where orders can still be given, but the units not be directly controlled like the turrets.&lt;ref name="book2"/&gt;

Along with the time of day changing dynamically in each game, random weather can affect effectiveness of units and interference. Storms, for example, can damage airplanes, and radars (mini-map view) can become distorted or even temporarily knocked out.&lt;ref name="book2"/&gt;

===Online play ===
''War Front: Turning Point'' includes online play through [[GameRanger]]. Custom games can have up to ten players playing in one online game.

==Factions==

===Allies===
Like the real World War II [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]], they are a coalition of the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]], and [[Free France]]. Because of this, their units are a mixture of each side, such as the British [[Matilda II|Matilda tank]] and American [[M26 Pershing]]. They have a technological advantage over the other factions, because their buildings are able to power themselves, without the need for power plants. They also have a superior air force that is larger, stronger and more versatile. These include aircraft such as the [[P-38 Lightning]] bomber (the only bomber capable of defending itself against interceptors) [[P-51 Mustang]] fighters and attack helicopters. The Allies also have the [[Nuclear weapon|atomic bomb]] at their disposal, deployed by a [[Northrop YB-35]] and an [[Earth quake bomb|"earthquake bomb"]] via a [[Halifax bomber]]. The Allied experimental unit is the O.R.B. (Omni-Repulsor-Barrier), which is an [[Armoured personnel carrier|APC]] truck with a force-field generator on the back, capable of protecting units, within its deflector shield range, from low to medium attacks.

===Germany===
The German forces are that of the real-life [[Wehrmacht]], but under new, more effective leadership following the [[death of Adolf Hitler]] in the early stages of the war. Their army focuses more on firepower, with a wide range of ground armoured units. German tanks are particularly strong that include real-life and upgraded versions such as the [[Panzer VIII Maus]], [[Elefant]] "tank hunter" and [[Tiger II|Tiger tank]]. They use [[Me 262]] fighter aircraft and [[Junkers Ju 390]]s and [[Horten Ho 229]]s for bombing runs, with the ability to deploy [[V-1 flying bomb]]s, which can be upgraded to a [[V-2 rocket]]. The Germans also have more varied experimental units than the other two factions. These include jet pack infantry equipped with flame throwers, heavy [[Powered exoskeleton|Exoskeleton]] mech-like heavy infantry, Sonic tanks that use blasts of sonic waves (rather than conventional ammunition) and the Giant Zeppelin, which uses an aluminium structure and large air-to-ground cannons.

===Soviet Union===
The Soviet Union is less developed than the Allies and Germans; however, it uses sheer numbers to overwhelm its opposition. It has an expanded and more-effective selection of infantry. Along with the general Red Army infantry, the Soviets have Medics to heal nearby infantry, Commissars to boost morale (overall efficiency), Molotov infantry that uses Molotov cocktails rather than rockets, being a faster option and can be backed up by Vodka Dealers who can make nearby infantry invulnerable to damage while they're alive. Their heavy armour is also small yet does include some powerful machines, like the Kharkov Rampager that is slow yet equipped with multiple turrets. Their aircraft is both smaller and weaker, primarily using [[Tupolev TB-3]] bombers, [[Il-2 Shturmovik]] ground-attack aircraft and [[Yakovlev Yak-1]] interceptors. They do however have powerful experimental units like the Ice Spitter, capable of freezing other units along with a similar "freeze bomb" deployed by a Tupolev bomber. There is also the [[Supergun|Giant Moving Turret]] that is slow with limited turret movement, but it has a long range and is very powerful. The APC Mole can transport troops by tunnelling underground.

==Campaign==

===Premise===
''War Front: Turning Point'' is set in an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]] in which [[Adolf Hitler]] is killed in the early days of the war. A new chancellor comes to power, and under his rule, [[Operation Sea Lion]] succeeds, and [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] successfully conquers Great Britain. As a result, Germany, the Western Allies and the Soviet Union enter a technological [[Cold war (general term)|cold war]], resulting in various new advanced technologies on both sides.

===German Campaign===
The campaign opens 1000 days after the German invasion of Great Britain, where Oberstleutnant Roland Hellmann, under General Hardt takes control of [[London]]. While pushing back Allied resistance north, Hardt reveals to be working with the [[German resistance to Nazism|German Resistance]], an undercover wing of the Wehrmacht under Dietrich Preiss; however, Hellmann is uninterested in their means of conduct. He is then sent to rescue Elsa Adler, a female German spy behind Soviet lines of the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]]. There it is revealed that the Soviets are using weapons to cool the environment to their advantage, with Adler being pursued by Aleksei Mikhalkov of the Red Army. Upon Adler's rescue, she reveals Soviet plans to build a range of new super-weapons and conquer Germany. To prevent this, they join up entirely to Preiss' resistance, and with the help of American Colonel John Lynch, they press on to take out the current Nazi leaders in order to make peace and ally with Britain and the rest of the Western Allies in hope of suppressing further conflict with the Soviets. This operation is successful; despite Nazi attempts to even destroy [[Berlin]] in the process.

Back at Berlin, General Wells of Britain arrives to sign the peace treaty with Hardt, only to be interrupted by a surprise Soviet attack on the capital. While the Allies and Germans recover, it becomes apparent that the previous reports which Adler obtained were fabricated by the Soviets themselves so the German Resistance would kill the Chancellor, thus bringing Germany into civil war, while the Soviets benefit and conquer all of Eastern Europe. The Soviets are held off momentarily, in order for Hellmann to locate and secure a top-secret German weapons base that houses plans for experimental weapons. During another push against the Soviets, Preiss however is captured, and he is used to lure both the Germans and Allies into a trap, yet eventually is rescued.

As Hardt and Hellmann begin the assault on [[Moscow]], Mikhalkov disguised as a German exoskeleton troop, kidnaps Adler via false a transmission. Hardt order the final strike against the Kremlin itself, but he stops just as the last remaining Soviets raise the white flag of surrender. Meanwhile, Hellmann confronts Mikhalkov, firing on a transmission tower allowing it to destroy Mikhalkov's suit. Instead of defeat, Mikhalkov instead causes the remains to self-destruct, yet Hellmann evades in time. Hardt and Lynch give their victory speeches, and the final scene closes with Adler and Hellmann kissing.

}}

The game received "average" reviews according to the [[Review aggregator|review aggregation]] website [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name="mc"/&gt; ''[[X-Play]]'' found that the "alternate history stuff keeps the stale setting interesting without getting completely wacky,"&lt;ref name="xplayreview"/&gt; while [[GameSpot]] commented on the balance of real-life and fictional units, being a "good thing because battles remain grounded in real-world combat and don't go overboard with high-tech gadgetry," going on to say, "Digital Reality strikes an almost perfect balance here between real history and 'what if?' ruminations."&lt;ref name="gamespotreview"/&gt;

Many reviewers however felt the RTS gameplay was still too conventional, regardless of the subject matter. [[IGN]] found that, "While ''War Front'' isn’t anything particularly new, it does traditional very solidly and creates a decent action atmosphere."&lt;ref name="ignreview"/&gt; ''[[PC Gamer]]'' similarly agreed by concluding, "''War Front'' is a solid and entertaining game, though far less original than it purports to be."&lt;ref name="pcgusreview"/&gt; Because of the game's traditional RTS formula, ''[[Eurogamer]]'' reviewed the title while at the same time satires reviews in general by outlining the traditional conventions in most reviews, such as concluding, "Lazy conclusion? Wrap things up with a witty line that leaves readers grinning. Or, just stop writing in the middl..."&lt;ref name="euroreview"/&gt;

[[GameSpy]] criticised the first-person shooter aspect for being "useless in a game that moves so fast" and even "may also cause lesser computers to slow to a crawl."&lt;ref name="gamespyreview"/&gt; Graphically, GameSpot felt, "The dark, gritty look of the game makes most levels a treat for the eyes when you're simply gawking at the scenery" yet at times can be "so dark and dense with detail that units are obscured."&lt;ref name="gamespotreview"/&gt;

'''''What Made Her Do It?''''' ({{nihongo|''Nani ga kanojo o sô saseta ka''|何が彼女をそうさせたか|lead=yes}}) is a 1930 Japanese silent film directed by [[Shigeyoshi Suzuki (film director)|Shigeyoshi Suzuki]], based on the [[Shingeki]] play. It was the top-grossing Japanese film of the silent era.&lt;ref name="Anderson"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Anderson|first1=Joseph L.|last2=Richie|first2=Donald|title=The Japanese Film: Art and Industry|date=1982|publisher=Princeton university press|location=Princeton (N.J.)|isbn=0691007926|page=68|edition=Expanded|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C2z3otM-y5kC&amp;pg=PA68&amp;lpg=PA68&amp;dq=%22What+Made+Her+Do+It?%22+japan+silent&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=BT4boeWgy4&amp;sig=7Ncuzhz640PC_Im6HoK4UIgE7Po&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwid0u_16IPYAhUH4IMKHa8AAl44ChDoAQg1MAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22What%20Made%20Her%20Do%20It%3F%22%20japan%20silent&amp;f=false|accessdate=12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Richie"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Richie|first1=Donald|title=A hundred years of Japanese film : a concise history, with selective guide to videos and DVDs/ Donald Richie.

==Plot==
The plot centers on a schoolgirl, Sumiko (Keiko Takatsu) who has been sent to live with her uncle. Arriving to a harried household with many children, her aunt and alcoholic uncle are annoyed by her arrival. A note, which Sumiko cannot read, announces that her father has killed himself. After being denied schooling and placed into labor for the family, Sumiko is eventually sold to a circus where she suffers at the hands of its members and ringmaster. Sumiko escapes with another circus performer, Shintaro (Ryuujin Unno), but Sumiko joins a team of thieves and ends up arrested. She is given work in the home of a wealthy aristocratic family, who denies even the simplest of pleasures to their staff out of cruelty. She is sent to a Christian orphanage, where she is humiliated for writing a letter to an old friend, and must make a public speech renouncing her ways and accepting Christ into her heart. Given the opportunity, Sumiko instead denounces the church, and ends up burning it down.

==Restoration==
The film, thought to be lost after [[World War II]], was restored in 1997 from a partial print found in the Russian Gosfilmosfond archive in 1994. The restoration added title cards approximating what was known of missing scenes, based on a copy of the director's screenplay provided by his family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.osaka-geidai.ac.jp/geidai/laboratory/kiyou/pdf/kiyou24/kiyou24_11.pdf|title=Restoration of the movie|last=Yono|first=Ota|date=2000|work=Bulletin of Osaka Art University|access-date=11 December 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; These notes were added to the start and finish of the film under supervision of Ota Yoneo.&lt;ref name="Bernardi"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bernardi|first1=Joanne|title=Writing in light : the silent scenario and the japanese pure film movement|date=2001|publisher=Wayne state university press|location=Detroit [Mich.]|isbn=0814329616|page=318|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aPU384tJCHAC&amp;pg=PA318&amp;lpg=PA318&amp;dq=%22What+Made+Her+Do+It?%22+japan+silent&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oTV_g-Uv4O&amp;sig=CmZ9psWg-fHHY5SpCPpuiUeMVsM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwid0u_16IPYAhUH4IMKHa8AAl44ChDoAQgyMAM#v=onepage&amp;q=%22What%20Made%20Her%20Do%20It%3F%22%20japan%20silent&amp;f=false|accessdate=12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
While contemporary criticism of the film includes film historian [[Donald Richie]]'s perspective that the film is "a melodramatic potboiler,"&lt;ref name="Richie" /&gt; the film was a box-office success that lead to increased scrutiny and eventually government censorship of political messaging in films of the era.&lt;ref name="Richie" /&gt; The film has been compared to radical German theater and [[Propaganda in the Soviet Union|Soviet-era propaganda films]],&lt;ref name="Bernardi" /&gt; though made by a commercial studio which embraced a tendency toward [[melodrama]] and vulgarity.&lt;ref name="OxfordGuide"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nowell-Smith|first1=edited by Geoffrey|title=The Oxford history of world cinema|date=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0198742428|page=316|edition=Paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Women in film''' describes the role of women as [[film director]]s, [[actor|actress]]es, [[cinematographer]]s, [[film producer]]s, [[film criticism|film critic]]s, and other [[film industry]] professions. The work of women in [[film criticism]] and scholarship, including [[Feminist film theory|feminist film theorists]], is also described.

==Pay and representation==
The 2013 Celluloid Ceiling Report conducted by the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film at [[San Diego State University]] collected a list of statistics gathered from "2,813 individuals employed by the 250 top domestic grossing films of 2012."&lt;ref name="SanDiego"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lauzen|first=Martha|title=The Celluloid Ceiling: Behind-the-Scenes Employment of Women on the Top 250 Films of 012|url=http://womenintvfilm.sdsu.edu/files/2012_Celluloid_Ceiling_Exec_Summ.pdf|work=The Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film|publisher=San Diego State University|accessdate=2013-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''New York Times'' article stated that only 15% of the top films in 2013 had women for a lead acting role.&lt;ref name="NYTstudy"&gt;{{cite web|last=Buckley|first=Cara|title=Only 15 Percent of Top Films in 2013 Put Women in Lead Roles, Study Finds|url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/11/only-15-percent-of-top-films-in-2013-put-women-in-lead-roles-study-finds||publisher=New York Times|accessdate=2014-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author of the study noted that, "The percentage of female speaking roles has not increased much since the 1940s, when they hovered around 25 percent to 28 percent." "Since 1998, women’s representation in behind-the-scenes roles other than directing has gone up just 1 percent." Women "...directed the same percent of the 250 top-grossing films in 2012 (9 percent) as they did in 1998."&lt;ref name="betsywoodruff"/&gt;

In 2015, ''[[Forbes]]'' reported that "...just 21 of the 100 top-grossing films of 2014 featured a female lead or co-lead, while only 28.1% of characters in 100 top-grossing films were female...

That means that Hollywood’s best-compensated actresses made just 40 cents for every dollar that the best-compensated men made." &lt;ref name="betsywoodruff"/&gt; Studies have shown that "...age and gender discrimination [together] can yield an even more significant wage gap." Young women actresses tend to make more than young male actors. However, "older [male] actors make more than their female equals" in age, with "female movie stars mak[ing] the most money on average per film at age 34, while male stars earn the most at 51." &lt;ref name="maanekhatchatourian"/&gt;

A [[woman's film]] is a [[film genre]] which includes women-centered narratives, female protagonists and is designed to appeal to a female audience. Woman's films usually portray "women's concerns" such as problems revolving around domestic life, the family, motherhood, self-sacrifice, and [[Romance (love)|romance]].{{sfn|Doane|1987|pp=152&amp;ndash;53}} These films were produced from the [[Silent film|silent era]] through the 1950s and early 1960s, but were most popular in the 1930s and 1940s, reaching their zenith during [[World War II]]. Although [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] continued to make films characterized by some of the elements of the traditional woman's film in the second half of the 20th century, the term itself largely disappeared in the 1960s.

The work of directors [[George Cukor]], [[Douglas Sirk]], [[Max Ophüls]], and [[Josef von Sternberg]] has been associated with the woman's film genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Heung | first = Marina | authorlink = | editor1-first = Angela | editor1-last = Howard | editor2-first = Frances M. | editor2-last = Kevenik | title = Handbook of American Women's History | url = | publisher = Garland | location = New York | year = 1990 | chapter = | chapterurl = | isbn = 978-0-8240-8744-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joan Crawford]], [[Bette Davis]], and [[Barbara Stanwyck]] were some of the genre's most prolific [[movie star|stars]].{{sfn|Basinger|2010|p=163}} The beginnings of the genre can be traced back to [[D. W. Griffith]]'s silent films. [[Film historian]]s and critics defined the genre and canon in retrospect. Before the woman's film became an established genre in the 1980s, many of the classic woman's films were referred to as [[Melodrama film|melodrama]]s.

Although many types of films may be directed toward the female gender, "chick flick" is typically used only in reference to films that emotion or contain themes that are relationship-based (although not necessarily romantic as many other themes may be present). Chick flicks often are released [[en masse]] around [[Valentine's Day]].&lt;ref name=suck&gt;{{cite web|first=Hailey|last=Eber|url=http://www.reelzchannel.com/article/843/our-valentine-to-you-and-yours-10-chick-flicks-that-dont-totally-suck|title=Our Valentine to You and Yours: 10 Chick-Flicks that Don't Totally Suck|publisher=[[ReelzChannel]]|accessdate=October 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=click&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/feb/14/entertainment/et-chickflicks14|accessdate=October 4, 2010|publisher=''[[The Los Angeles Times]]''|date=February 14, 2009|first=Rachel|last=Abramowitz|title='Chick flicks' are really starting to click}}&lt;/ref&gt; The equivalent for male audiences is the [[guy-cry film]].

Generally, a chick flick is a film designed to have an innate appeal to women, typically young women.&lt;ref name=click/&gt; Defining a chick flick is, as the ''[[New York Times]]'' has stated, more of a parlor game than a science.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news|date=April 9, 2008|accessdate=October 4, 2010|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''| title=Wary Hollywood Plans More Chick-Flicks (Hoping to Lure the Guys)|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/09/movies/09roma.html?_r=1&amp;ref=movies&amp;oref=slogin|first=Michael|last=Cieply}}&lt;/ref&gt; These films are generally held in [[popular culture]] as having formulaic, paint-by-numbers plot lines and characters. This makes usage of the term "problematic" for implying "frivolity, artlessness, and utter commercialism", according to [[ReelzChannel]].&lt;ref name=suck/&gt; However, several chick flicks have received high critical acclaim for their stories and performances. For example, the [[1983 in film|1983 film]] ''[[Terms of Endearment]]'' received [[Academy Awards]] for Best Screenplay, Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actress, and Best Actor in a Supporting Role.&lt;ref name=terms&gt;{{cite web|quote=Terms of Endearment shares with films Beaches, Steel Magnolias, and One True Thing the popular status of melodramatic "chick-flick."|url=http://litmed.med.nyu.edu/Annotation?action=view&amp;annid=10210|title=Terms of Endearment|publisher=[[New York University]]: [http://litmed.med.nyu.edu/ Literature, Arts, and Medicine Database]|accessdate=September 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Girlfriend flicks===
While the plot of a chick flick is typically expected to be centered around a romantic conquest, Alison Winch ("We Can Have It All") writes about films she calls "girlfriend flicks."&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal |url= http://ezp.slu.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=fyh&amp;AN=71115497&amp;site=eds-live|title = We Can Have It All|last = Winch|first = Alison|date = 2012|journal = Feminist Media Studies|doi = |pmid = |access-date = December 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These movies emphasize the relationships between friends instead of focusing on a love connection, and examples include ''[[Bride Wars]]'' and ''[[Baby Mama (film)|Baby Mama]]''.

According to Winch, {{Quote|text = Girlfriend flicks often have savvy, “nervous,” female voice-overs mirroring typical romantic comedies, but addressing female spectators in their assumption of the mutual minefield of negotiating relationships, body, work, family, depression—issues prevalent in conduct, diet, and self-help books marketed specifically to women.|sign = |source = }}&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Winch also states that the girlfriend flicks are meant to criticize "second wave feminism’s superficial understanding of female solidarity" by showing "conflict, pain, and betrayal acted out between women."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; By emphasizing the "complexities of women's relationships,"  the girlfriend flick breaks the mold for the usual chick flick and allows the genre to gain a bit of depth.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== [[Women Make Movies]] ===
Women Make Movies (WMM) is a “non-profit media arts organization which facilitates the production, promotion, distribution and exhibition of independent films and videotapes by and about women” based in New York City. Women Make Movies is a feminist media organization that focuses especially on the work of women of color.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wmm.com|title=Women Make Movies|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization is independent; it receives less than $100,000 a year from the government, and its films are all made by independent women artists.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=White|first=Patricia|date=2013|title=Looking Back and Forward: A Conversation about Women Make Movies|url=http://cameraobscura.dukejournals.org/content/28/1_82/147.abstract |journal=[[Camera Obscura (journal)|Camera Obscura]]|volume=28|pages=|via=|doi= 10.1215/02705346-2016996 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Founded in 1969 by [[Ariel Maria Dougherty|Ariel Dougherty]] and Sheila Page, the organization first aimed to teach women about filmmaking.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-10-16|title=Women Make Movies|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Women_Make_Movies&amp;oldid=805623089|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, it established training workshops in New York to introduce women to filmmaking, especially documentary. According to [[B. Ruby Rich]], director of the film program at the [[New York State Council on the Arts]] (NYSCA) in 1981, “Documentary was the preferred mode for its ability to focus attention directly on issues of importance to women.” Rich says that the organization emerged to help combat the problem of women’s lives being misrepresented in films of the time.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rich|first=B. Ruby|date=2013|title=The Confidence Game|url=|journal=Camera Obscura|volume=28|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the organization’s focus shifted more toward the distribution of films made by women rather than just training. This change was led by Debra Zimmerman, the executive director of Women Make Movies since 1983.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It came in response to the lack of distribution and presentation of films made by women in a male dominated field. Additionally, the organization was losing funding, but they were able to regain it through the help of Rich and the NYSCA with their new distribution program.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The program originally focused on screenings in New York and the foundation of women’s films festivals. Today, the distribution program is their primary work. The organization distributes its collection of more than 500 films to institutions such as colleges, galleries, museums, etc.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The program “has been able to influence university curricula deeply and to advance the careers of women filmmakers whom it has taken under its wing.”&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; 

As part of the distribution program, Women Make Movies is involved with international women’s films festivals. They distribute films to countries that wish to exhibit women’s films, which has helped start festivals in six to eight countries such as Monaco and Sierra Leone.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Along with the distribution program, the organization also has a production program that offers resources and training to independent women filmmakers – they reach more than 400 filmmakers in 30 countries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

The organization’s collection of films has grown from around 40 to now more than 500. The collection includes films and videos of diverse subject matter and often represents women of minorities such as lesbians or women with disabilities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Overall, the goal of Women Make Movies is and has always been to represent independent women filmmakers as a response to the lack of women directors and filmmakers in Hollywood. They aim to combine politics and social problems with film theory to accurately depict the lives of women. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Feminist film theory==
[[Feminist film theory]] is [[film theory|theoretical]] [[film criticism]] derived from [[feminist]] politics and [[feminist theory]]. Feminists have many approaches to cinema analysis, regarding the film elements analyzed and their theoretical underpinnings. The development of feminist film theory was influenced by [[second wave feminism]] and the development of [[women's studies]] in the 1960s and 1970s. Feminist scholars began taking cues from the new theories arising from these movements to analyzing film. Initial attempts in the United States in the early 1970s were generally based on [[sociological theory]] and focused on the function of women characters in particular film [[narrative]]s or [[genre]]s and of [[stereotype]]s as a reflection of a society's view of women. Studies analyzed how the women portrayed in film related to the broader historical context, the stereotypes depicted, the extent to which the women were shown as active or passive, and the amount of screen time given to women.&lt;ref&gt;Erens, Patricia. “Introduction” ''Issues in Feminist Film Criticism.'' Patricia Erens, ed. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1990. pp. xvi.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, film theoreticians in England began integrating perspectives based on [[critical theory]] and drawing inspiration from [[psychoanalytic theory|psychoanalysis]], [[semiotics]], and [[Marxism]]. Eventually these ideas gained hold within the American scholarly community in the later 1970s and 1980s. Analysis focused on they ways "cinematic production affect the representation of women and reinforce sexism".&lt;ref&gt;Erens, Patricia. "Introduction", ''Issues in Feminist Film Criticism.'' Patricia Erens, ed. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1990. pp. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt;

In considering the way that films are put together, many feminist film critics have pointed to what they argue is the "[[male gaze]]" that predominates in [[Classical Hollywood cinema|classical Hollywood]] filmmaking. Budd Boetticher summarises the view thus: "What counts is what the heroine provokes, or rather what she represents. She is the one, or rather the love or fear she inspires in the hero, or else the concern he feels for her, who makes him act the way he does. In herself the woman has not the slightest importance."&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;{{cite book|title=Issues in Feminist Film Criticism|author=Erens, P.|date=1990|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=9780253319647|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q2U0wwTFVwgC|page=28|accessdate=October 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coming from a black feminist perspective, American scholar [[bell hooks]] put forth the notion of the "oppositional gaze," encouraging black women not to accept stereotypical representations in film, but rather actively critique them.&lt;ref&gt;hooks, bell. "The Oppositional Gaze: Black Female Spectators." ''The Feminism and Visual Culture Reader.'' Amelia Jones, ed. London: Routledge, 2003, pp. 94–105.&lt;/ref&gt; Janet Bergstrom’s article "Enunciation and Sexual Difference" (1979) uses Sigmund Freud’s ideas of bisexual responses, arguing that women are capable of identifying with male characters and men with women characters, either successively or simultaneously.&lt;ref name="Erens, Patricia 1990"&gt;Erens, Patricia. "Introduction" ''Issues in Feminist Film Criticism.'' Patricia Erens, ed. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1990. pp. xxi.&lt;/ref&gt; Miriam Hanson, in "Pleasure, Ambivalence, Identification: Valentino and Female Spectatorship" (1984) put forth the idea that women are also able to view male characters as erotic objects of desire.&lt;ref name="Erens, Patricia 1990"/&gt; In "The Master's Dollhouse: Rear Window," Tania Modleski argues that Hitchock's film, ''[[Rear Window]]'', is an example of the power of male gazer and the position of the female as a prisoner of the "master's dollhouse".&lt;ref&gt;Braudy and Cohen, ''Film Theory and Criticism'', Sixth Edition, Oxford University Press, 2004, page 861.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bechdel test==

The [[Bechdel test]], originating in 1985 from the comic strip "Dykes to Watch Out For" by [[Allison Bechdel]], is an approach to observing the representation of women in popular film. Bechdel attributes the idea to Liz Wallace and has said the test should be called the "Bechdel-Wallace test. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/08/call-it-the-bechdel-wallace-test/402259/|title=How the Standard for Women in Culture Became Known as the 'Bechdel Test'|last=Garber|first=Megan|work=[[The Atlantic]]|access-date=2017-09-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; To pass the test, films must have at least two women who talk to each other, and the women must talk about something other than a man. The requirement that the two women must be named characters, rather than generic [[stock character]]s (e.g., "[[girlfriend]]", "[[groupie]]", etc.) is sometimes added. Only about half of all films meet these requirements, according to user-edited film databases and media industry press. The test is used as an indicator for the active presence of women in films and other fiction, and to call attention to [[gender inequality]] in fiction due to [[sexism]].&lt;ref name=T&gt;[http://dykestowatchoutfor.com/testy Bechdel, Allison. "Testy". Alison Bechdel blog. Posted November 8, 2013].&lt;/ref&gt; A study of gender portrayals in 855 of the most financially successful U.S. films from 1950 to 2006 showed that there were, on average, two male characters for each female character, a ratio that remained stable over time.

'''World Championship Wrestling''' was an [[Australia]]n [[professional wrestling]] promotion that ran from 1964 until 1978.

==History==
The promotion gained publicity through television programs on the [[Nine Network]] which were presented at noon on Saturdays and Sundays.

An average of 6,500 people attended in the first three months of the promotion's existence, a crowd of 8,000 attended a show on 7 November in [[Melbourne]] when the first title change in the new promotion took place as [[Dominic De Nucci]] defeated [[Killer Kowalski]]. WCW also promoted throughout [[Southeast Asia]], particularly in [[Singapore]] and [[Hong Kong]].

When WCW began operations in 1964, the promotion created the '''International Wrestling Alliance''' as a sanctioning body for WCW's original championships, the IWA World Heavyweight and World Tag Team Championships. WCW joined the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] in August 1969, but they continued to recognize the IWA World championships until 1971, when they were abandoned in favor of new NWA-sanctioned titles ([[World Championship Wrestling (Australia)#NWA-sanctioned championships|see below]]).

In 1978, the Nine Network ceased coverage of WCW; with no TV coverage promoters were facing financial ruin, thus the death of the glory days of [[professional wrestling in Australia]]. The "World Championship Wrestling" name was revived in 1982 by [[Georgia Championship Wrestling]] in the [[United States]] for its own TV program, which became the roots of the American promotion later known by [[World Championship Wrestling|the same name]].  At the time, the promotion's former owner, [[Jim Barnett (wrestling)|Jim Barnett]], was one of the owners of Georgia Championship Wrestling.

Documentary's about the promotion were released in 2007 called ''Ruff, Tuff N Real''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1610432/&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Over the Top Rope'' in 2017&lt;ref&gt;http://overthetoprope.com.au/&lt;/ref&gt;.
