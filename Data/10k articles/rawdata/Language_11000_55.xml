'''Analogical modeling''' ('''AM''') is a formal theory of [[exemplar theory|exemplar]] based analogical reasoning, proposed by [[Royal Skousen]], professor of Linguistics and English language at [[Brigham Young University]] in [[Provo, Utah]]. It is applicable to language modeling and other categorization tasks. Analogical modeling is related to [[connectionism]] and [[Nearest neighbor (pattern recognition)|nearest neighbor]] approaches, in that it is data-based rather than abstraction-based; but it is distinguished by its ability to cope with imperfect datasets (such as caused by simulated short term memory limits) and to base predictions on all relevant segments of the dataset, whether near or far. In language modeling, AM has successfully predicted empirically valid forms for which no theoretical explanation was known (see the discussion of Finnish morphology in Skousen et al. 2002). &lt;!-- I don't have the book to hand; I know the article in question was pp. 11-25, but I can't give an actual page number for the Finnish prediction. --&gt;

==Implementation==
===Overview===
An exemplar-based model consists of a [[general-purpose modeling]] engine and a problem-specific dataset. Within the dataset, each exemplar (a case to be reasoned from, or an informative past experience) appears as a feature vector: a row of values for the set of parameters that define the problem. For example, in a spelling-to-sound task, the feature vector might consist of the letters of a word. &lt;!-- Re these tasks, it would be appropriate to cite one of the papers of Walter Daelemans or the Induction of Linguistic Knowledge group at Tilburg University. I need to slap the references up on the talk page so someone with a library can find the right one. --&gt; Each exemplar in the dataset is stored with an outcome, such as a phoneme or phone to be generated. When the model is presented with a novel situation (in the form of an outcome-less feature vector), the engine algorithmically sorts the dataset to find exemplars that helpfully resemble it, and selects one, whose outcome is the model's prediction. The particulars of the algorithm distinguish one exemplar-based modeling system from another.

In AM, we think of the feature values as characterizing a context, and the outcome as a behavior that occurs within that context. Accordingly, the novel situation is known as the ''given context.'' Given the known features of the context, the AM engine systematically generates all contexts that include it (all of its ''supracontexts''), and extracts from the dataset the exemplars that belong to each. The engine then discards those supracontexts whose outcomes are [[inconsistent]] (this measure of consistency will be discussed further below), leaving an ''analogical set'' of supracontexts, and probabilistically selects an exemplar from the analogical set with a bias toward those in large supracontexts. This multilevel search exponentially magnifies the likelihood of a behavior's being predicted as it occurs reliably in settings that specifically resemble the given context.

===Analogical modeling in detail===

AM performs the same process for each case it is asked to evaluate. The given context, consisting of n variables, is used as a template to generate &lt;math&gt;2^n&lt;/math&gt; supracontexts. Each supracontext is a set of exemplars in which one or more variables have the same values that they do in the given context, and the other variables are ignored. In effect, each is a view of the data, created by filtering for some criteria of similarity to the given context, and the total set of supracontexts exhausts all such views. Alternatively, each supracontext is a theory of the task or a proposed rule whose predictive power needs to be evaluated.

It is important to note that the supracontexts are not equal peers one with another; they are arranged by their distance from the given context, forming a hierarchy. If a supracontext specifies all of the variables that another one does and more, it is a subcontext of that other one, and it lies closer to the given context. (The hierarchy is not strictly branching; each supracontext can itself be a subcontext of several others, and can have several subcontexts.) This hierarchy becomes significant in the next step of the algorithm.

The engine now chooses the analogical set from among the supracontexts. A supracontext may contain exemplars that only exhibit one behavior; it is deterministically homogeneous and is included. It is a view of the data that displays regularity, or a relevant theory that has never yet been disproven. A supracontext may exhibit several behaviors, but contain no exemplars that occur in any more specific supracontext (that is, in any of its subcontexts); in this case it is non-deterministically homogeneous and is included. Here there is no great evidence that a systematic behavior occurs, but also no counterargument. Finally, a supracontext may be heterogeneous, meaning that it exhibits behaviors that are found in a subcontext (closer to the given context), and also behaviors that are not. Where the ambiguous behavior of the nondeterministically homogeneous supracontext was accepted, this is rejected because the intervening subcontext demonstrates that there is a better theory to be found. The heterogeneous supracontext is therefore excluded. This guarantees that we see an increase in meaningfully consistent behavior in the analogical set as we approach the given context.

With the analogical set chosen, each appearance of an exemplar (for a given exemplar may appear in several of the analogical supracontexts) is given a pointer to every other appearance of an exemplar within its supracontexts. One of these pointers is then selected at random and followed, and the exemplar to which it points provides the outcome. This gives each supracontext an importance proportional to the square of its size, and makes each exemplar likely to be selected in direct proportion to the sum of the sizes of all analogically consistent supracontexts in which it appears. Then, of course, the probability of predicting a particular outcome is proportional to the summed probabilities of all the exemplars that support it.

(Skousen 2002, in Skousen et al. 2002, pp.&amp;nbsp;11–25, and Skousen 2003, both passim)

===Formulas===
Given a context with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; elements:
:total number of pairings: &lt;math&gt;n^2&lt;/math&gt;
:number of agreements for outcome ''i'': &lt;math&gt;n_i^2&lt;/math&gt;
:number of disagreements for outcome ''i'': &lt;math&gt;n_i(n - n_i)&lt;/math&gt;
:total number of agreements: &lt;math&gt;\sum{n_i^2}&lt;/math&gt;
:total number of disagreements: &lt;math&gt;\sum{n_i(n - n_i)} = n^2 - \sum{n_i^2}&lt;/math&gt;

===Example===
This terminology is best understood through an example. In the example used in the second chapter of Skousen (1989), each context consists of three variables with potential values 0-3

:Variable 1: 0,1,2,3
:Variable 2: 0,1,2,3
:Variable 3: 0,1,2,3
The two outcomes for the dataset are ''e'' and ''r'', and the exemplars are:

 3 1 0 e
 0 3 2 r
 2 1 0 r
 2 1 2 r
 3 1 1 r

We define a network of pointers like so:

[[File:Analogical modeling pointer network.svg|300px|Pointer network for example problem]]

The solid lines represent pointers between exemplars with matching outcomes; the dotted lines represent pointers between exemplars with non-matching outcomes.

The statistics for this example are as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;n = 5&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;n_r = 4&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;n_e = 1&lt;/math&gt;
:total number of pairings: &lt;math&gt;n^2 = 25&lt;/math&gt;
:number of agreements for outcome ''r'': &lt;math&gt;n_r^2 = 16&lt;/math&gt;
:number of agreements for outcome ''e'': &lt;math&gt;n_e^2 = 1&lt;/math&gt;
:number of disagreements for outcome ''r'': &lt;math&gt;n_r(n - n_r) = 4&lt;/math&gt;
:number of disagreements for outcome ''e'': &lt;math&gt;n_e(n - n_e) = 4&lt;/math&gt;
:total number of agreements: &lt;math&gt;n_r^2 + n_e^2 = 17&lt;/math&gt;
:total number of disagreements: &lt;math&gt;n_r(n - n_r) + n_e(n - n_e) = n^2 - (n_r^2 + n_e^2) = 8&lt;/math&gt;
:''uncertainty'' or fraction of disagreement: &lt;math&gt;8/25 = .32&lt;/math&gt;

Behavior can only be predicted for a given context; in this example, let us predict the outcome for the context "3 1 2". To do this, we first find all of the contexts containing the given context; these contexts are called supracontexts. We find the supracontexts by systematically eliminating the variables in the given context; with ''m'' variables, there will generally be &lt;math&gt;2^m&lt;/math&gt; supracontexts. The following table lists each of the sub- and supracontexts; {{overline|x}} means "not x", and ''-'' means "anything".

{| class="wikitable"
! style="text-align:left"|Supracontext
! style="text-align:left"|Subcontexts
|-
|-
| {{mono|3 1 2}}
| 3 1 2
|-
| {{mono|3 1 -}}
| 3 1 2, 3 1 {{overline|2}}
|-
| {{mono|3 - 2}}
| 3 1 2, 3 {{overline|1}} 2
|-
| {{mono|- 1 2}}
| 3 1 2, {{overline|3}} 1 2
|-
| {{mono|3 - -}}
| 3 1 2, 3 {{overline|1}} 2, 3 1 {{overline|2}}, 3 {{overline|1}} {{overline|2}}
|-
| {{mono|- 1 -}}
| 3 1 2, {{overline|3}} 1 2, 3 1 {{overline|2}}, {{overline|3}} 1 {{overline|2}}
|-
| {{mono|- - 2}}
| 3 1 2, {{overline|3}} 1 2, 3 {{overline|1}} 2, {{overline|3}} {{overline|1}} 2
|-
| {{mono|- - -}}
| 3 1 2, {{overline|3}} 1 2, 3 {{overline|1}} 2, 3 1 {{overline|2}}, {{overline|3}} {{overline|1}} 2, {{overline|3}} 1 {{overline|2}}, 3 {{overline|1}} {{overline|2}}, {{overline|3}} {{overline|1}} {{overline|2}}
|}
These contexts are shown in the venn diagram below:

[[File:Contexts venn diagramm for analogical modeling.svg|300px|Illustration of sub- and supracontexts]]

The next step is to determine which exemplars belong to which contexts in order to determine which of the contexts are homogeneous. The table below shows each of the subcontexts, their behavior in terms of the given exemplars, and the number of disagreements within the behavior:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! align="left" | Subcontext!! align="left" |Behavior!! align="left" |Disagreements
|-
| 3 1 2
| (empty)
| align="center" |0
|-
| 3 1 {{overline|2}}
| 3 1 0 e, 3 1 1 r
| align="center" |2
|-
| 3 {{overline|1}} 2
| (empty)
| align="center" |0
|-
| {{overline|3}} 1 2
| 2 1 2 r
| align="center" |0
|-
| 3 {{overline|1}} {{overline|2}}
| (empty)
| align="center" |0
|-
| {{overline|3}} 1 {{overline|2}}
| 2 1 0 r
| align="center" |0
|-
| {{overline|3}} {{overline|1}} 2
| 0 3 2 r
| align="center" |0
|-
| {{overline|3}} {{overline|1}} {{overline|2}}
| (empty)
| align="center" |0
|}

Analyzing the subcontexts in the table above, we see that there is only 1 subcontext with any disagreements: "3 1 {{overline|2}}", which in the dataset consists of "3 1 0 e" and "3 1 1 r". There are 2 disagreements in this subcontext; 1 pointing from each of the exemplars to the other (see the pointer network pictured above). Therefore, only supracontexts containing this subcontext will contain any disagreements. We use a simple rule to identify the homogeneous supracontexts:
&lt;blockquote&gt;If the number if disagreements in the supracontext is greater than the number of disagreements in the contained subcontext, we say that it is heterogeneous; otherwise, it is homogeneous.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
There are 3 situations that produce a homogeneous supracontext:
#The supracontext is empty. This is the case for "3 - 2", which contains no data points. There can be no increase in the number of disagreements, and the supracontext is trivially homogeneous.
#The supracontext is deterministic, meaning that only one type of outcome occurs in it. This is the case for "- 1 2" and "- - 2", which contain only data with the ''r'' outcome.
#Only one subcontext contains any data. The subcontext does not have to be deterministic for the supracontext to be homogeneous. For example, while the supracontexts "3 1 -" and "- 1 2" are deterministic and only contain one non-empty subcontext, "3 - -" contains only the subcontext "3 1 {{overline|2}}". This subcontext contains "3 1 0 e" and "3 1 1 r", making it non-deterministic. We say that this type of supracontext is unobstructed and non-deterministic.

The only two heterogeneous supracontexts are "- 1 -" and "- - -". In both of them, it is the combination of the non-deterministic "3 1 {{overline|2}}" with other subcontexts containing the ''r'' outcome which causes the heterogeneity.

There is actually a 4th type of homogeneous supracontext: it contains more than one non-empty subcontext and it is non-deterministic, but the frequency of outcomes in each sub-context is exactly the same. Analogical modeling does not consider this situation, however, for 2 reasons:
#Determining whether this 4 situation has occurred requires a &lt;math&gt;\chi^2&lt;/math&gt; test. This is the only test of homogeneity that requires arithmetic, and ignoring it allows our tests of homogeneity to become statistically free, which makes AM better for modeling human reasoning.
#It is an extremely rare situation, and thus ignoring it will can be expected not to have a large effect on the predicted outcome.

Next we construct the analogical set, which consists of all of the pointers and outcomes from the homogeneous supracontexts.
The figure below shows the pointer network with the homogeneous contexts highlighted.

[[File:AM pointers and homogeneous contexts.svg|300px|Pointer network with homogeneous supracontexts circled]]

The pointers are summarized in the following table:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! align="left" | Homogeneous&lt;br/&gt;supracontext!! align="left" |Occurrences!! align="left" |Number of&lt;br/&gt;pointers
|-
| 
|
|
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! ''e''!!''r''
|}
|-
| {{mono|3 1 -}}
| "3 1 0 e", "3 1 1 r"
| 
{| class="wikitable"
| 2
| 2
|}
|-
| {{mono|- 1 2}}
| "2 1 2 r"
| 
{| class="wikitable"
| 0
| 1
|}
|-
| {{mono|3 - -}}
| "3 1 0 e", "3 1 1 r"
| 
{| class="wikitable"
| 2
| 2
|}
|-
| {{mono|- - 2}}
| "2 1 2 r", "0 3 2 r"
| 
{| class="wikitable"
| 0
| 4
|}
|-
| / |
| Totals:
| 
{| class="wikitable"
| 4
| 9
|}
|}

4 of the pointers in the analogical set are associated with the outcome ''e'', and the other 9 are associated with ''r''. In AM, a pointer is randomly selected and the outcome it points to is predicted. With a total of 13 pointers, the probability of the outcome ''e'' being predicted is 4/13 or 30.8%, and for outcome ''r'' it is 9/13 or 69.2%. We can create a more detailed account by listing the pointers for each of the occurrences in the homogeneous supracontexts:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:right"
|-
! cellpadding="1" | Occurrence!!Number of&lt;br/&gt;homogeneous&lt;br/&gt;supracontexts!!Number of&lt;br&gt;pointers!! align="center" |Analogical&lt;br/&gt;effect
|-
| {{mono|3 1 0 e}}
| 2
| 4
| 30.8%
|-
| {{mono|3 1 1 r}}
| 2
| 4
| 30.8%
|-
| {{mono|2 1 2 r}}
| 2
| 3
| 23.1%
|-
| {{mono|0 3 2 r}}
| 1
| 2
| 15.4%
|-
| {{mono|2 1 0 r}}
| 0
| 0
| 0.0%
|}

We can then see the ''analogical effect'' of each of the instances in the data set.

==Historical context==
Analogy has been considered useful in describing language at least since the time of [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussure]]. [[Noam Chomsky]] and others have more recently criticized analogy as too vague to really be useful (Bańko 1991), an appeal to a ''deus ex machina.'' Skousen's proposal appears to address that criticism by proposing an explicit mechanism for analogy, which can be tested for psychological validity.

==Applications==
Analogical modeling has been employed in experiments ranging from [[phonology]] and [[morphology (linguistics)]] to [[orthography]] and [[syntax]].

==Problems==
Though analogical modeling aims to create a model free from rules seen as contrived by linguists, in its current form it still requires researchers to select which variables to take into consideration. This is necessary because of the so-called "exponential explosion" of processing power requirements of the computer software used to implement analogical modeling. Recent research suggests that [[quantum computing]] could provide the solution to such performance bottlenecks (Skousen et al. 2002, see pp 45–47).

The '''Angami–Pochuri languages''' are a small family of [[Sino-Tibetan languages]] spoken in southern [[Nagaland]] and Northern Manipur of northeast [[India]]. Conventionally classified as "Naga", they are not clearly related to other [[Kuki-Chin–Naga languages|Naga languages]], and are conservatively classified as an independent branch of Sino-Tibetan, pending further research.

Coupe (2012)&lt;ref&gt;Coupe, Alexander R. 2012. Overcounting numeral systems and their relevance to sub-grouping in the Tibeto-Burman languages of Nagaland. Language and Linguistics / Academica Sinica 13. 193-220.&lt;/ref&gt; considers the [[Ao languages]] to be most closely related to Angami–Pochuri as part of a wider ''Angami–Ao'' group.

==Languages==
The '''Angami languages''' are:
*[[Angami language|Angami]]
*[[Chokri language|Chokri]] (Chakri, Chakhesang)
*[[Kheza language|Kheza]]
*[[Sopvoma language|Sopvoma]] (Mao)
*[[Poula language|Poula]] (Poumai)

The '''Pochuri languages''' are:
*[[Pochuri language|Pochuri]]–Meluri
*[[Ntenyi language|Ntenyi]] (Northern Rengma)
*[[Rengma language|Rengma]]
*[[Sumi language|Sumi]] (Sema)

'''Rengma–Simi''' might form a third branch according to Burling (2003).&lt;ref&gt;Burling, R. (2003). The Tibeto-Burman languages of Northeastern India. In G. Thurgood &amp; R. LaPolla (Eds.), The Sino-Tibetan Languages (pp. 169-191). London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Glottolog" /&gt;

'''Awa''' or '''Awa pit''', also known as '''Cuaiquer''', is a [[Barbacoan]] language spoken by the [[Awa-Kwaiker people]], who inhabit territory straddling northern Ecuador and southern Colombia (the language is sometimes also referred to as '''Coaiquer''', '''Quaiquer''', or '''Kwaiker''' in Colombia, and as '''Awapit''' in Ecuador).&lt;ref name="eth"&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=kwi Awa–Cuaiquer], per SIL, Ethnologue, 1986 and 1991. Retrieved 23 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Awa pit is classified by [[UNESCO]] as a severely endangered language.&lt;ref&gt;Haboud, Marleen;  Adelaarurl, Willem (2008).

UNESCO Publishing (online version). Retrieved 23 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Speakers and characteristics==
The Awa pit language has around 21 thousand speakers, mostly residing on the [[Colombia]]n Pacific slopes of the [[Andes]], with about a thousand in an adjacent area of [[Ecuador]].&lt;ref name="eth"/&gt; While most men also speak [[Spanish language|Spanish]], the women and children are predominantly monolingual.&lt;ref name="eth"/&gt; 
Literacy among Awa speakers is less than 1% in their native language and under 5% in the secondary Spanish language.&lt;ref name="eth"/&gt;

The Awa pit language has a subject–object–verb structure and has adopted the [[Latin script]].&lt;ref name="eth"/&gt; Grammatically, Awa pit uses a characteristic [[conjunct]]/[[Disjunct (linguistics)|disjunct]] system of verb suffixes for person-marking which displays similarities with some [[Tibeto-Burman languages]], such as the [[Nepal Bhasa|Newari]] language of Kathmandu.&lt;ref&gt;Curnow, Timothy Jowan (1997).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1842">'''Bathroom privileges''' refers to the rules or the possibility of the use of a [[toilet (room)|toilet]]. Most commonly, the term is used in the following settings:

* In schools, it refers to permission for pupils to leave the classroom during lessons. Often this is associated with certain regulations, such as usage of the [[hall pass]]. Sometimes, no bathroom privileges are granted for certain periods of time at the beginning and the end of a lesson.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}
* As a [[doctor's prescription]], it refers to permission for a patient to use the facilities. This may be due to a [[medical condition]] requiring [[bed rest]] (e.g. high-risk pregnancy),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.wisc.edu/3345 Despite side effects, bed rest still common for high-risk pregnancy (June 10, 1998)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; or the avoidance of certain [[defecation postures]] (e.g. sitting or squatting)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ggalanti.com/field_reports/field_reports_filipino.html Galanti | Cultural Diversity in Healthcare&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Still another example is "BRP for bowel movement only". On the other hand, if a patient has a [[communicable disease]], the physician may wish to restrict the chances of it spreading by disallowing them from using the shared toilet on the ward.
* At some workplaces, it refers to formal rules, e.g. the number and the duration of the usage of the bathroom.&lt;ref&gt;"The agreement  covers everything from cigarette breaks to bathroom privileges"—describing a racetrack labor union contract in: T. D. Thornton (2007). ''Not by a Long Shot: A Season at a Hard Luck Horse Track''. {{ISBN|1-58648-449-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bimetallism'''{{efn|Formerly also written '''bi-metallism'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Wilson |first=Alexander Johnstone |location=London |publisher=Macmillan &amp; Co. |url=https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/006594733 |title=Reciprocity, Bi-metallism, and Land-Tenure Reform |date=1880 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;}} is the [[economics|economic]] term for a [[monetary standard]] in which the value of the [[monetary unit]] is defined as equivalent to certain quantities of two metals, typically [[gold]] and [[silver]], creating a fixed rate of exchange between them.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |contribution=bimetallism, ''n.'' |title=Oxford English Dictionary |url=http://www.oed.com |contribution-url=http://oed.com/view/Entry/19090 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

For scholarly purposes, "proper" bimetallism is sometimes distinguished as permitting that both gold and silver money are [[legal tender]] in unlimited amounts and that gold and silver may be taken to be coined by the [[Mint (facility)|government mints]] in unlimited quantities.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Velde |author2-last=Webber |display-authors=1 |title=A Model of Bimetallism |location=Minneapolis |publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis Research Department }}.&lt;/ref&gt; This distinguishes it from "limping standard" bimetallism, where both gold and silver are legal tender but only one is freely coined (e.g. the moneys of France, Germany, and the United States after 1873), and from "trade" bimetallism, where both metals are freely coined but only one is legal tender and the other is used as "trade money" (e.g. most moneys in western Europe from the 13th to 18th centuries). Economists also distinguish ''legal'' bimetallism, where the law guarantees these conditions, and ''[[de facto]]'' bimetallism, where gold and silver coins circulate at a fixed rate.

In the 19th century, there was a great deal of scholarly debate and political controversy regarding the use of bimetallism in place of a [[gold standard|gold]] or [[silver standard]] ([[monometallism]]). Bimetallism was intended to increase the supply of money, stabilize prices, and facilitate setting exchange rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Encyclopædia Britannica |contribution=Bimetallism}}.{{Clarify|date=January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars argued that bimetallism was inherently unstable owing to [[Gresham's law]], and that its replacement by a monometallic standard was inevitable. Other scholars claimed that in practice bimetallism had a stabilizing effect on economies. The controversy became largely moot after [[gold cyanidation|technological progress]] and the [[Witwatersrand Gold Rush|South African]] and [[Klondike Gold Rush]]es increased the supply of gold in circulation at the end of the century, ending most of the political pressure for greater use of silver. It became completely academic after the 1971 [[Nixon shock]], since when all of the world's currencies have operated as more or less freely [[floating currency|floating]] [[fiat money]], unconnected to the value of silver or gold. Nonetheless, academics continue to inconclusively debate the relative use of the metallic standards.{{efn|For example, [[Charles Kindleberger|Kindleberger]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Kindleberger |first=Charles |date=1984 |title=A Financial History of Western Europe |location=London |publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin }}.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Angela Redish|Redish]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Redish |first=Angela |date=1995 |contribution=The Persistence of Bimetallism in Nineteenth Century France |title=Economic History Review |pp=717–736}}.&lt;/ref&gt; have argued ''against'' and [[Milton Friedman|Friedman]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Friedman |first=Milton |date=1990 |contribution=Bimetallism Revisited |title=Journal of Economic Perspectives |publisher=American Economic Association |volume=Vol. 4 |number=No. 4 |pages=85–104 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Marc Flandreau|Flandreau]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Flandreau |first=Marc |date=1996 |contribution=The French Crime of 1873: An Essay on the Emergence of the International Gold Standard, 1870–1880 |title=The Journal of Economic History |volume=Vol. 56 |number=No. 4 |pp=862–897 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''for'' the inherent stability and usefulness of bimetallic standards.}}

==Historical creation==
From the 7th century BCE, [[Asia Minor]], especially in the areas of [[Lydia]] and [[Ionia]], is known to have created a coinage based on [[electrum]], a natural occurring material called [[electrum]], a variable mix of gold and silver (with about 54% gold and 44% silver). Before [[Croesus]], his father [[Alyattes of Lydia|Alyattes]] had already started to mint various types of non-standardized electrum coins. They were in use in Lydia and surrounding areas for about 80 years.&lt;ref name="WM49"/&gt; The unpredictability of its composition implied that it had a variable value which was very hard to determine, which greatly hampered its development.&lt;ref name="WM49"/&gt;

===Croeseids===
[[File:Croeseid equivalence.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Croeseid]] bimetallic equivalence: 1 gold Croeseid of 8.1 grams was equivalent in value to 10 silver Croeseids of 10.7 grams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fisher |first1=William Bayne |last2=Gershevitch |first2=I. |last3=Boyle |first3=John Andrew |last4=Yarshater |first4=Ehsan |last5=Frye |first5=Richard Nelson |title=The Cambridge History of Iran |date=1968 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9780521200912 |pages=616-617 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BBbyr932QdYC&amp;pg=PA616 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{main|Croeseid}}
[[Croesus]] (Reigned c.560–c.546 BC), king of [[Lydia]], who became associated with great wealth. Croesus is credited with issuing the ''[[Croeseid]]'', the first true [[gold coin]]s with a standardised purity for general circulation,&lt;ref name="WM49"/&gt;

[[Herodotus]] mentioned the innovation made by the Lydians:&lt;ref name="WM49"/&gt;

{{quote|"So far as we have any knowledge, they [the Lydians] were the first people to introduce the use of gold and silver coins, and the first who sold goods by retail"|Herodotus, I94&lt;ref name="WM49"/&gt;}}

===Achaemenid coinage===
[[File:Achaemenid bimetallic equivalence.jpg|thumb|300px|Achaemenid bimetallic equivalence: 1 gold Daric was equivalent in value to 20 silver Sigloi. Under the Achaemenids the exchange rate in weight between gold and silver was 1 to 13.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=DARIC – Encyclopaedia Iranica |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/daric |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{main|Achaemenid coinage}}
Many ancient bimetallic systems would follow, starting with [[Achaemenid coinage]]. From around 515 BCE under [[Darius I]], the minting of Croesids in [[Sardis]] was replaced by the minting of [[Daric]]s and [[Sigloi]]. The earliest gold coin of the [[Achaemenid Empire]], the [[Daric]], followed the weight standard of the Croeseid, and is therefore considered to be later and derived from the Croeseid.&lt;ref name="CHI"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fisher |first1=William Bayne |last2=Gershevitch |first2=I. |last3=Boyle |first3=John Andrew |last4=Yarshater |first4=Ehsan |last5=Frye |first5=Richard Nelson |title=The Cambridge History of Iran |date=1968 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9780521200912 |page=617 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BBbyr932QdYC&amp;pg=PA617 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The weight of the Daric would then be modified through a metrological reform, probably under Darius I.&lt;ref name="CHI"/&gt; 

Sardis remained the central mint for the Persian Darics and Sigloi of [[Achaemenid coinage]], and there is no evidence of other mints for the new Achaemenid coins during the whole time of the [[Achaemenid Empire]].&lt;ref name="CHI619"&gt; {{cite book |last1=Fisher |first1=William Bayne |last2=Gershevitch |first2=I. |last3=Boyle |first3=John Andrew |last4=Yarshater |first4=Ehsan |last5=Frye |first5=Richard Nelson |title=The Cambridge History of Iran |date=1968 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9780521200912 |page=619 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BBbyr932QdYC&amp;pg=PA619 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the gold Daric became an international currency which was found throughout the Ancient world, the circulation of the Sigloi remained very much limited to Asia Minor: important hoards of Sigloi are only found in these areas, and finds of Sigloi beyond are always very limited and marginal compared to Greek coins, even in Achaemenid territories.&lt;ref name="CHI619"/&gt;

==Argentina==
In 1881, a currency reform in [[Argentina]] introduced a bimetallic standard, which went into effect in July 1883.&lt;ref name="acbsms46"&gt;{{cite web |last1=della Paolera |first1=Gerardo |last2=Taylor |first2=Alan M. |title=The Argentine Currency Board and the Search for Macroeconomic Stability, 1880–1935 |url=https://www.nber.org/chapters/c8835.pdf |publisher=University of Chicago Press |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/64JrNBdam?url=https://www.nber.org/chapters/c8835.pdf |archivedate=2011-12-30 |pages=46–48 |year=2001 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Units of gold and silver [[peso]]s would be exchanged with paper peso notes at given par values, and fixed exchange rates against key international currencies would thus be established.&lt;ref name="acbsms46"/&gt; Unlike many metallic standards, the system was very decentralized: no national monetary authority existed, and all control over convertibility rested with the five banks of issue.&lt;ref name="acbsms46"/&gt; This convertibility lasted only 17 months: from December 1884 the banks of issue refused to exchange gold at par for notes.&lt;ref name="acbsms46"/&gt; The suspension of convertibility was soon accommodated{{clarify|date=June 2017}} by the Argentine government, since, having no institutional power over the monetary system, there was little they could do to prevent it.&lt;ref name="acbsms46"/&gt;

==France==
A French law of 1803 granted anyone who brought gold or silver to its mint the right to have it coined at a nominal charge in addition to the official rates of 5 grams of 90% silver per franc or 3100 francs per kilogram of 90% fine gold.&lt;ref name=Leavens&gt;Dickson Leavens, Silver Money, Chapter IV Bimetallism in France and the Latin Monetary Union, page 25&lt;/ref&gt; This effectively established a bimetallic standard at the rate which had been used for French coinage since 1785, i.e. a relative valuation of gold to silver of 15.5 to 1. In 1803 this ratio was close to the market rate, but for most of the next half century the market rate was above 15.5 to 1.&lt;ref name=Leavens /&gt; As a consequence, silver powered the French economy and gold was exported. Then the [[California Gold Rush|Forty-Niners]] went to California and the resulting supply of gold reduced its value relative to silver. The market rate fell below 15.5 to 1, and remained below until 1866. Frenchmen responded by exporting silver to India and importing nearly two-fifths of the world's production of gold in the period from 1848 to 1870.&lt;ref name=Levens26&gt;Dickson Leavens, op. cit. page 26&lt;/ref&gt; [[Napoleon III]] introduced five franc gold coins which provided a substitute for the silver five franc coins which were hoarded,&lt;ref&gt;John Porteous, Coins in History, page 238&lt;/ref&gt; but still maintained the formal bimetallism implicit in the 1803 law.

==Latin Monetary Union==
The national coinages introduced in Belgium (1832), Switzerland (1850), and Italy (1861) were based on France's bimetallic currency. These countries joined France in a treaty signed on 23 December 1865 which established the [[Latin Monetary Union]](LMU).&lt;ref name=Levens26 /&gt;  Greece joined the LMU in 1868 and about twenty other countries adhered to its standards.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Friedberg, Gold Coins of the World, fourth edition, page 11&lt;/ref&gt;  The LMU effectively adopted bimetallism by allowing unlimited free coinage of gold and silver at the 15.5 to 1 rate used in France, but also began to back away from bimetallism by allowing limited issues of low denomination silver coins struck to a lower standard for government accounts.&lt;ref name=Porteous241&gt;John Porteous, op. cit.  page 241&lt;/ref&gt;  A surplus of silver led the LMU to limit free coinage of silver in 1874 and to end it in 1878, effectively abandoning bimetallism for the gold standard.&lt;ref name=Porteous241/&gt;

==United Kingdom==
Medieval and early modern England used both gold and silver, at fixed rates, to provide the necessary range of coin denominations; but silver coinage began to be restricted in the 18th century, first informally, and then by an [[Act of Parliament]] in 1774.&lt;ref&gt;A. Redish, ''Bimetallism'' (2006) p. 67 and p. 205&lt;/ref&gt; After the suspension of metal convertibility from 1797 to 1819, [[Peel's Bill]] set the country on the gold standard for the remainder of the century; however advocates of a return to bimetallism did not cease to appear. After the crash of 1825, [[William Huskisson]] argued strongly within the Government for bimetallism, as a way to increase credit (as well as to ease trade with South America).&lt;ref&gt;B. Hilton, ''A Mad, Bad &amp; Dangerous People?'' (Oxford, 2008) p. 303&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, after the banking crisis of 1847, [[Alexander Baring, 1st Baron Ashburton|Alexander Baring]] headed an external bimetallist movement hoping to prevent the undue restriction of the currency.&lt;ref&gt;É. Halévy, ''Victorian Years'' (London: Ernest Benn, 1961) p. 201&lt;/ref&gt; It was, however, only in the last quarter of the century that the movement for bimetallism gathered real strength, drawing on Manchester cotton merchants and City financiers with Far East interests to offer a serious (if ultimately unsuccessful) challenge to the gold standard.&lt;ref&gt;P. J. Cain, ''British Imperialism'' (2016) pp. 155-6 and p. 695&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
In 1787, the [[United States Constitution]] established gold and silver as the [[legal tender]] of the United States&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.constitution.org/constit_.htm#con1.10.1.5 U.S. Constitution]&lt;/ref&gt; at a [[floating exchange rate]]. Then in 1792, Secretary of the Treasury [[Alexander Hamilton]] proposed [[price fixing|fixing]] the silver to gold [[exchange rate]] at 15:1, as well as establishing the [[United States mint|mint]] for the public services of [[Free Silver|free coinage]] and [[currency]] [[regulation]] "in order not to abridge the quantity of circulating medium.".&lt;ref&gt;2 Annals of Cong. 2115 (1789–1791), cited in [[Arthur Nussbaum]], [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1116782?seq=3 The Law of the Dollar], ''[[Columbia Law Review]]'', Vol. 37, No. 7 (Nov., 1937), pp. 1057–1091&lt;/ref&gt; With its acceptance, [[s:United States Statutes at Large/Volume 1/2nd Congress/1st Session/Chapter 16|Sec.11]] of the [[Coinage Act of 1792]] established: "That the proportional value of gold to silver in all coins which shall by law be current as money within the United States, shall be as fifteen to one, according to quantity in weight, of pure gold or pure silver;" the proportion had slipped by [[Coinage Act of 1834|1834]] to sixteen to one. Silver took a further hit with the [[Coinage Act of 1853]], when nearly all silver coin denominations were debased, effectively turning silver coinage into a fiduciary currency based on its face value rather than its weighted value. Bimetallism was effectively abandoned by the [[Coinage Act of 1873]], but not formally outlawed as legal currency until the early 20th century.  The merits of the system were the subject of debate in the late 19th century. If the market forces of supply and demand for either metal caused its bullion value to exceed its nominal currency value, it [[Gresham's Law|tends to disappear from circulation]] by hoarding or melting down.

===Political debate===
In the United States, bimetallism became a center of political conflict toward the end of the 19th century. During the [[US Civil War|Civil War]], to finance the war the U.S. switched from bimetallism to a [[fiat money]] currency. After the war, in 1873, the government passed the [[Coinage Act of 1873|Fourth Coinage Act]] and soon resumption of specie payments began (without the free and unlimited coinage of silver, thus putting the U.S. on a mono-metallic gold standard.) Farmers, debtors, Westerners and others who felt they had benefited from wartime paper money formed the short-lived [[Greenback Party]] to press for cheap paper money backed by silver.&lt;ref&gt;R. B. Nye, ''the Growth of the United States'' (Penguin 1955) p. 599-603&lt;/ref&gt;  The latter element – "free silver" – came increasingly to the fore as the answer to the same interest groups' concerns, and was taken up as a central plank by the [[People's Party (United States)|Populist movement]].&lt;ref&gt;H. G, Nicholas, ''The American Union'' (Penguin 1950) p. 220&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of monetary silver, known as the [[silverite]]s, referred back to the Fourth Coinage Act as "The Crime of '73," as it was judged to have inhibited inflation, and favoured creditors over debtors. Some reformers, however, like [[Henry Demarest Lloyd]], saw bimetallism as a red herring and feared that free silver was "the [[cowbird]] of the reform movement, likely to push the other eggs out of the nest.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in R. B. Nye, ''the Growth of the United States'' (Penguin 1955) p. 603&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless the [[Panic of 1893]], a severe nationwide depression, brought the money issue strongly to the fore again. The "silverites" argued that using silver would inflate the money supply and mean more cash for everyone, which they equated with prosperity.  The gold advocates said silver would permanently depress the economy, but that [[sound money]] produced by a [[gold standard]] would restore prosperity.

[[Image:1896GOP.JPG|thumb|380px|right|1896 Republican poster warns against free silver.]]

Bimetallism and "[[Free Silver]]" were demanded by [[William Jennings Bryan]] who took over leadership of the [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] in 1896, as well as by the Populists, and a faction of Republicans from silver mining regions in the West known as the [[Silver Republican Party|Silver Republicans]] who also endorsed Bryan.&lt;ref&gt;R. B. Nye, ''the Growth of the United States'' (Penguin 1955) p. 603&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[History of United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] itself nominated [[William McKinley]] on a platform supporting the gold standard which was favored by financial interests on the East Coast.

Bryan, the eloquent champion of the cause, gave the famous [[Cross of Gold speech|"Cross of Gold" speech]] at the National Democratic Convention on July 9, 1896 asserting that "The gold standard has slain tens of thousands." He referred to "a struggle between 'the idle holders of idle capital’ and 'the struggling masses, who produce the wealth and pay the taxes of the country;’ and, my friends, the question we are to decide is: Upon which side will the Democratic party fight?" At the [[peroration]], he said "You shall not press down upon the brow of labor this crown of thorns, you shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold." &lt;ref&gt;R. B. Nye, ''the Growth of the United States'' (Penguin 1955) p. 604&lt;/ref&gt;  However, his presidential campaign was ultimately unsuccessful; this can be partially attributed to the discovery of the [[Gold cyanidation|cyanide process]] by which gold could be extracted from low grade ore. This process and the discoveries of large gold deposits in South Africa ([[Witwatersrand Gold Rush]] of 1887 - with large-scale production starting in 1898) and the [[Klondike Gold Rush]] (1896) increased the world gold supply and the subsequent increase in money supply that free coinage of silver was supposed to bring. The McKinley campaign was effective at persuading voters in the business East that poor economic progress and unemployment would be exacerbated by adoption of the Bryan platform.&lt;ref&gt;H. G, Nicholas, ''The American Union'' (Penguin 1950) p. 222&lt;/ref&gt; 1896 saw the election of McKinley. The direct link to gold was abandoned in 1934 in [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|FDR]]’s [[New Deal]] program and later the link was broken by [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]] when he [[Nixon Shock|closed the gold window]].

===Economic analysis===
In 1992, economist [[Milton Friedman]] concluded that abandonment of the bimetallic standard in 1873 led to greater price instability than would have occurred otherwise, and thus resulted in long-term harm to the US economy.  His retrospective analysis led him to write that the act of 1873 "... was a mistake that had highly adverse consequences."&lt;ref&gt;Milton Friedman, ''Money Mischief'' (New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1992) 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7291">'''Brown clustering''' is a hard [[hierarchical agglomerative clustering]] problem based on distributional information proposed by Peter Brown, Vincent Della Pietra, Peter deSouza, Jennifer Lai, and [[Robert Mercer (businessman)|Robert Mercer]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is typically applied to text, grouping words into clusters that are assumed to be semantically related by virtue of their having been embedded in similar contexts.

== Introduction ==
In [[natural language processing]], '''Brown clustering'''&lt;ref name="turian"/&gt; or '''IBM clustering'''&lt;ref name="jurafsky"/&gt; is a form of [[hierarchical clustering]] of words based on the contexts in which they occur, proposed by Peter Brown, Vincent Della Pietra, Peter deSouza, Jennifer Lai, and [[Robert Mercer (businessman)|Robert Mercer]] of [[IBM]] in the context of [[language model]]ing.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Peter F. Brown |author2=Peter V. deSouza |author3=Robert L. Mercer |author4=Vincent J. Della Pietra |author5=Jenifer C. Lai |title=Class-based {{mvar|n}}-gram models of natural language |journal=Computational Linguistics |volume=18 |issue=4 |year=1992 |url=http://aclweb.org/anthology/J/J92/J92-4003.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The intuition behind the method is that a '''class-based language model''' (also called '''cluster {{mvar|n}}-gram model'''&lt;ref name="jurafsky"/&gt;), i.e. one where probabilities of words are based on the classes (clusters) of previous words, is used to address the [[data sparsity]] problem inherent in language modeling.

[[Daniel Jurafsky|Jurafsky]] and Martin give the example of a [[flight reservation system]] that needs to estimate the [[likelihood]] of the bigram "to Shanghai", without having seen this in a training set.&lt;ref name="jurafsky"&gt;{{cite book |title=Speech and Language Processing |author1=Daniel Jurafsky |author2=James H. Martin |publisher=Pearson Education International |year=2009 |pages=145–146}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system can obtain a good estimate if it can cluster "Shanghai" with other city names, then make its estimate based on the likelihood of phrases such as "to London", "to Beijing" and "to Denver".

== Technical definition ==

Brown  groups items (i.e., [[Type–token distinction|types]]) into classes, using a binary merging criterion based on the [[log-probability]] of a text under a class-based language model, i.e. a probability model that takes the clustering into account. Thus, average [[mutual information]] (AMI) is the optimization function, and merges are chosen such that they incur the least loss in global [[mutual information]].

As a result, the output can be thought of not only as a [[binary tree]] but perhaps more helpfully as a sequence of merges, terminating with one big class of all words. This model has the same general form as a [[hidden Markov model]], reduced to bigram probabilities in Brown's solution to the problem.
MI is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{MI}(c_i, c_j) = \Pr(\langle c_i, c_j\rangle) \log_2 \frac{\Pr(\langle c_i, c_j\rangle)}{\Pr(\langle c_i, *\rangle) \Pr(\langle *, c_j\rangle)}&lt;/math&gt;

Finding the clustering that maximizes the likelihood of the data is computationally expensive. 
The approach proposed by Brown et al. is a [[greedy algorithm|greedy heuristic]].

The work also suggests use of Brown clusterings as a simplistic bigram class-based language model. Given cluster membership indicators {{mvar|c&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} for the tokens {{mvar|w&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} in a text, the probability of the word instance {{mvar|w&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} given preceding word {{math|''w&lt;sub&gt;i-1&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is given by:&lt;ref name="jurafsky"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Pr(w_i | w_{i-1}) = \Pr(w_i | c_i) \Pr(c_i | c_{i-1})&lt;/math&gt;

This has been criticised{{Citation needed|date=January 2018|reason=by whom?}} as being of limited utility, as it only ever predicts the most common word in any class, and so is restricted to {{math|{{!}}c{{!}}}} word types; this is reflected in the low relative reduction in perplexity found when using this model and Brown.

== Variations ==

Other works have examined trigrams in their approaches to the Brown clustering problem.&lt;ref name="trigrams"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Sven Martin |author2=Jorg Liermann |author3=Hermann Ney |title=Algorithms for bigram and trigram word clustering |journal=Speech Communication |volume=24 |issue=1 |year=1999 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167639397000629 |doi=10.1016/S0167-6393(97)00062-9 |pages=19–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brown clustering as proposed generates a fixed number of output classes. It is important to choose the correct number of classes, which is task-dependent.&lt;ref name="tuning"&gt;{{cite conference |author1=Leon Derczynski |author2=Sean Chester |author3=Kenneth S. Bogh |title=Tune your Brown clustering, please |conference=Proceedings of the conference on Recent Advances in Natural Language Processing |year=2015 |url=http://www.derczynski.com/sheffield/papers/brown_impact.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cluster memberships of words resulting from Brown clustering can be used as features in a variety of [[machine learning|machine-learned]] natural language processing tasks.&lt;ref name="turian"&gt;{{cite conference |author1=Joseph Turian |author2=Lev Ratinov |author3=Yoshua Bengio |title=Word representations: a simple and general method for semi-supervised learning |conference=Proceedings of the 48th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics |year=2010 |url=http://aclweb.org/anthology/P/P10/P10-1040.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A generalization of the algorithm was published in the AAAI conference in 2016, including a succint formal definition of the 1992 version and then also the general form.&lt;ref name="generalization"&gt;{{cite conference|author1=Leon Derczynski|author2=Sean Chester|title=Generalised Brown Clustering and Roll-Up Feature Generation|conference=Proceedings of the Thirtieth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence|year=2016|url=https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI16/paper/view/11779/11769}}&lt;/ref&gt; Core to this is the concept that the classes considered for merging do not necessarily represent the final number of classes output, and that altering the number of classes considered for merging directly affects the speed and quality of the final result.

There are no known theoretical guarantees on the greedy heuristic proposed by Brown et al. (as of February 2018). However, the clustering problem can be framed as estimating the parameters of the underlying class-based language model: it is possible to develop a consistent estimator for this model under mild assumptions.&lt;ref name="spectral"&gt;{{cite conference |author1=Karl Stratos |author2=Do-kyum Kim |author3=Michael Collins |author4=Daniel Hsu |title=A Spectral Algorithm for Learning Class-Based n-gram Models of Natural Language |conference=Proceedings of the 30th Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence |year=2014 |url=http://auai.org/uai2014/proceedings/individuals/251.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Coup d'œil''' (or '''coup d'oeil'''; {{IPA-fr|ku dœj}}) is a term taken from [[French language|French]], that more or less corresponds to the words ''[[wiktionary:glimpse|glimpse]]''   or ''[[wiktionary:glance|glance]]'' in [[English language|English]]. The literal meaning is "stroke of [the] eye".

It is mostly used (in English) in a [[military]] context, where the coup d'œil refers to the ability to discern at one glance the [[military tactics|tactical]] advantages and disadvantages of the terrain. For example, the famous [[king]] [[Frederick the Great]] of [[Prussia]] in his 1753 "Particular Instructions" devotes special attention to the military coup d'œil, defining it as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]he perfection of that art to learn at one just and determined view the benefits and disadvantages of a country where posts are to be placed and how to act upon the annoyance of the enemy. This is, in a word, the true meaning of a ''coup d'œil'', without which an officer may commit errors of the greatest consequence.&lt;ref&gt;Particular Instructions, Article 16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The phrase popularly comes from [[Carl von Clausewitz|Clausewitz]] in his tome ''[[On War]]'':&lt;blockquote&gt;When all is said and done, it really is the commander's ''coup d'œil'', his ability to see things simply, to identify the whole business of war completely with himself, that is the essence of good generalship.  Only if the mind works in this comprehensive fashion can it achieve the freedom it needs to dominate events and not be dominated by them.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl von Clausewitz|Clausewitz]] (1989 edition) p. 578&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Napoleon remarked upon it:&lt;blockquote&gt;There is a gift of being able to see at a glance the possibilities offered by the terrain...One can call it the ''coup d'œil militaire'' and it is inborn in great generals.&lt;ref&gt;[[Napoleon I]], 1769-1821, ''M&amp;eacute;moires''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As did [[Jean Charles, Chevalier Folard|Folard]] and [[Liddell Hart]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The ''coup d'œil'' is a gift of God and cannot be acquired; but if professional knowledge does not perfect it, one can only see things imperfectly and in a fog, which is not enough in these matters where it is important to have a clear eye...To look over a battlefield, to take in at the first instance the advantages and disadvantages is the great quality of a general.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean Charles, Chevalier Folard|Chevalier Folard]], ''Nouvelles Decouvertes sur la Guerre'', 1724&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;A vital faculty of generalship is the power of grasping ''instantly'' the picture of the ground and the situation, of relating one to the other, and the local to the general.&lt;ref&gt;[[B. H. Liddell Hart]], ''Thoughts on War'', xi, 1944, emphasis in the original&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The coup d'œil remains important for officers in modern armies for the positioning of infantry, tanks, artillery etc. It is also important for [[snipers]], or infantry operating weapons like [[anti-tank weapons]], in order to find good concealment, cover and a good [[Field of fire (weaponry)|field of fire]].

In current-day French, the phrase simply means "glimpse." For example, it is often used in marketing materials in the same way that "At a glance..." is used in English to title a product summary.__NOTOC__

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5801">'''Dissociated press''' is a [[parody generator]] (a [[computer program]] that generates [[nonsense|nonsensical]] text). The generated text is based on another text using the [[Markov chain]] technique. The name is a play on "[[Associated Press]]".

An implementation of the algorithm is available in [[Emacs]]. Another implementation is available as a [[Perl]] module in [[CPAN]], [https://metacpan.org/module/Games::Dissociate Games::Dissociate].&lt;ref name="burke_and_finkel"&gt;[[Sean M. Burke|Burke, Sean M.]] and Avi Finkel. [https://metacpan.org/module/Games::Dissociate Games::Dissociate distribution in CPAN]. Retrieved 2012-11-13. Most recent release: 2010, "v1.0".&lt;/ref&gt;

==The algorithm==
The algorithm starts by printing a number of consecutive words (or letters) from the source text. Then it searches the source text for an occurrence of the few last words or letters printed out so far. If multiple occurrences are found, it picks a random one, and proceeds with printing the text following the chosen occurrence. After a predetermined length of text was printed out, the search procedure is repeated for the newly printed ending.

Considering that words and phrases tend to appear in specific grammatical contexts, the resulting text usually seems correct grammatically, and if the source text is uniform in style, the result appears to be of similar style and subject, and takes some effort on the reader's side to recognize as not genuine. Still, the randomness of the assembly process deprives it of any logical flow - the loosely related parts are connected in a nonsensical way, creating a humorously abstract, random result.

==Examples==
Here is a short example of word-based Dissociated Press applied to the [[Jargon File]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/D/Dissociated-Press.html |title=Dissociated Press |accessdate=2007-04-10 |last=Raymond |first=Eric S. |date=2003-12-29 |work=Jargon File 4.4.7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:wart: n. A small, crocky feature that sticks out of an array (C has no checks for this). This is relatively benign and easy to spot if the phrase is bent so as to be not worth paying attention to the medium in question.

Here is a short example of letter-based Dissociated Press applied to the same source:

==History==
The dissociated press algorithm is described in [[HAKMEM]] (1972) Item #176. The name "dissociated press" is first known to have been associated with the Emacs implementation.

Brian Hayes discussed a Travesty algorithm in ''[[Scientific American]]'' in November 1983.{{r|byte198411}} The article provided a garbled [[William Faulkner]] passage:
{{quote|When he got on the table, he come in. He never come out of my own pocket as a measure of protecting the company against riot and bloodshed. And when he said. "You tell me a bus ticket, let alone write out no case histories. Then the law come back with a knife!"}}

Hugh Kenner and Joseph O'Rourke of [[The Johns Hopkins University]] discussed their [[frequency table]]-based Travesty generator for microcomputers in ''[[BYTE]]'' in November 1984. The article included the [[Turbo Pascal]] source for two versions of the generator, one using Hayes' algorithm and another using [[Claude Shannon]]'s Hellbat algorithm.&lt;ref name="byte198411"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1984-11/1984_11_BYTE_09-12_New_Chips#page/n129/mode/2up |title=A Travesty Generator for Micros |work=BYTE |date=November 1984 |accessdate=23 October 2013 |author1=Kenner, Hugh |author2=O'Rourke, Joseph |pages=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murray Lesser offered a [[compiled BASIC]] version in the magazine in July 1985,&lt;ref name="lesser198507"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1985-07/1985_07_BYTE_10-07_Computers_and_Space#page/n183/mode/2up |title=Travesty Revisited |work=BYTE |date=July 1985 |accessdate=27 October 2013 |author=Lesser, Murray |pages=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; in September 1985 Peter Wayner offered a version that used [[tree data structure]]s instead of frequency tables,&lt;ref name="wayner198509"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1985-09/1985_09_BYTE_10-09_Homebrewing#page/n165/mode/2up |title=Build a Travesty Tree |work=BYTE |date=September 1985 |accessdate=27 October 2013 |author=Wayner, Peter |pages=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in December 1985 Neil J.

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7419">Two types of [[language change]] can be characterized as [[natural language|linguistic]] '''drift''': a [[wikt:unidirectional|unidirectional]] [[short-term]] and [[Period of time|cyclic]] [[long-term]] drift.

==Short-term unidirectional drift==
According to [[Edward Sapir|Sapir]], drift is unconscious change in natural language.  He gives the example ''Whom did you see?'' which is grammatically correct but is generally replaced by ''Who did you see?'' Structural symmetry seems to have brought about the change: all other ''wh-'' words are monomorphic (consisting of only one [[morpheme]]).  The drift of speech changes dialects and, in long terms, it generates new languages. Although it may appear these changes have no direction, in general they do. For example, in the English language, there was the [[Great Vowel Shift]], a [[chain shift]] of long vowels first described and accounted for in terms of drift by [[Otto Jespersen|Jespersen]] (1860–1943). Another example of drift is the tendency in English to eliminate the ''-er'' comparative formative and to replace it with the more analytic ''more''. Thus, in some dialects one now regularly hears ''more kind'' and ''more happy'' instead of the prescriptive ''kinder'', ''happier''.  In English, it may be the competition of the ''-er'' agentive suffix which has brought about this drift, i.e. the eventual loss of the Germanic comparative system in favor of the newer system calqued on French. Moreover, the structural asymmetry of the comparative formation may be a cause of this change.

The underlying cause of drift may be [[Entropy (information theory)|entropy]]: the amount of disorder (differences in probabilities) inherent in all linguistic systems.&lt;ref&gt;See early work of [[Yehoshua Bar-Hillel|Bar-Hillel]] and [[Benoît Mandelbrot|Mandelbrot]], as well as [[George Kingsley Zipf|Zipf]] and [[André Martinet|Martinet]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Another underlying cause of drift may be [[cross-linguistic influence]] (CLI) in situations of language contact. For example, in Shanghai Chinese (Shanghainese) it has been reported that vowel sounds have gradually changed over time due to the influence of Mandarin Chinese (Yao &amp; Chang, 2016). At a shorter timescale (weeks of intensive exposure to a second language) as well, phonetic changes have been observed in an individual's native language (Chang, 2012, 2013); these changes, termed 'phonetic drift', generally approximate properties of the second language.

==Long-term cyclic drift==
Cyclic drift is the mechanism of long-term evolution that changes the [[Purpose|functional]] characteristics of a [[language]] over time, such as the reversible drifts from [[subject–object–verb|SOV]] [[word order]] to [[subject–verb–object|SVO]] and from [[Synthetic language|synthetic inflection]] to [[Agglutinative language|analytic]] observable as typological parameters in the [[syntax]] of [[language families]] and of [[areal feature|areal]] groupings of languages open to investigation over long periods of time. Drift in this sense is not language-specific but universal, a consensus achieved over two decades by universalists of the typological school as well as the generativist, notably by [[Joseph H. Greenberg|Greenberg]] (1960, 1963), [[Warren Cowgill|Cowgill]] (1963), [[Henri Wittmann|Wittmann]] (1969), [[Carleton Taylor Hodge|Hodge]] (1970), [[Talmy Givon|Givón]] (1971), [[George Lakoff|Lakoff]] (1972), [[Theo Vennemann|Vennemann]] (1975) and [[John Reighard|Reighard]] (1978).

To the extent that a language is [[vocabulary]] cast into the mould of a particular [[syntax]] and that the [[basic structure]] of the [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]] is held together by [[functional items]], with the [[lexical items]] filling in the blanks, [[syntactic change]] is no doubt what modifies most deeply the physiognomy of a particular language. Syntactic change affects [[grammar]] in its [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] and [[syntactic]] aspects and is seen as [[gradualism#Linguistics and language change|gradual]], the product of [[chain reaction]]s and subject to cyclic drift.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Henri Wittmann]]'s 1983 state-of-the-art article.&lt;/ref&gt;

The view that the genesis of [[creole languages]] or other [[natural languages]] may be the product of catastrophism is heavily disputed by all authors as incompatible with drift.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2554">'''Dyscrasia''' (or '''dyskrasia''') is a concept from ancient Greek [[medicine]], meaning bad mixture.&lt;ref&gt;Aphorism 79 or Organon of Medicine by Dr. Samuel Hahnemann&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of dyscrasia was developed by the Greek physician [[Galen]] (129–216 AD), who elaborated a model of health and disease as a structure of elements, qualities, humors, organs, and temperaments. Health was understood in this perspective to be a condition of harmony or balance among these basic components, called '''eucrasia'''.  Disease was interpreted as the disproportion of bodily fluids or [[four humours]]: phlegm, blood, and yellow and black bile.  The imbalance was called ''dyscrasia''.

==Ancient use==
To the Greeks, it meant an imbalance of the [[four humors]]: [[blood]], [[black bile]], [[yellow bile]], and water ([[phlegm]]). These humors were believed to exist in the body, and any change in the balance among the four of them was the direct cause of all [[disease]].

This is similar to the concepts of bodily humors in the [[Traditional Tibetan medicine|Tibetan medical]] tradition and the Indian [[Ayurvedic]] system, which both relate health and disease to the balance and imbalance of the three bodily humors, generally translated as wind, bile, and phlegm. This is also similar to the Chinese concept of [[yin and yang]] that an imbalance of the two polarities caused ailment.{{cn|date=January 2015}}

==Modern use==
It is still occasionally used in medical context for an unspecified disorder of the blood. Specifically, it is defined in current medicine as a morbid general state resulting from the presence of abnormal material in the blood, usually applied to diseases affecting blood cells or platelets. Evidence of dyscrasia can be present with a WBC (White Blood Cell) count of over 1,000,000.&lt;ref&gt;Stedman's medical dictionary, 6th edition&lt;/ref&gt;

"[[Plasma cell]] dyscrasia" is sometimes considered synonymous with [[paraproteinemia]] or [[monoclonal gammopathy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{DorlandsDict|three/000032996|dyscrasia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[H2 receptor antagonists]] such as [[Famotidine]] and [[Nizatidine]], in use for treatment of [[peptic ulcer]], are known for causing blood dyscrasia - leading to bone marrow failure in 1 out of 50,000 patients.

[[File:Benutzung eines Radiergummies.gif|thumb|Using an eraser]]

An '''eraser''', (also called a '''rubber''' outside the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.canadaspace.com/definition/rubber/|title=rubber Dictionary definition at Canadaspace.com English Online Dictionary|author=|date=|website=dictionary.canadaspace.com|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[rubber|material first used]]) is an article of [[stationery]] that is used for removing writing from paper or skin. Erasers have a rubbery consistency and come in a variety of shapes, sizes and colours. Some pencils have an eraser on one end. Less expensive erasers are made from [[synthetic rubber]] and synthetic [[soybean|soy]]-based gum, but more expensive or specialized erasers are [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]], [[plastic]], or [[Natural gum|gum]]-like materials.

At first, erasers were made to erase mistakes made with a pencil; later, more abrasive [[ink eraser]]s were introduced. The term is also used for things that remove writing from chalkboards and whiteboards. Ink erasers are denser, allowing them to erase pen marks.

==History==
[[File:Pencil Eraser.jpg|right|thumb|A [[pencil]] eraser]]
Before rubber erasers, tablets of wax were used to erase lead or charcoal marks from paper. Bits of rough stone such as [[sandstone]] or [[pumice]] were used to remove small errors from parchment or papyrus documents written in ink. Crustless bread was used as an eraser in the past; a [[Meiji period|Meiji]]-era (1868-1912) Tokyo student said: "Bread erasers were used in place of rubber erasers, and so they would give them to us with no restriction on amount. So we thought nothing of taking these and eating a firm part to at least slightly satisfy our hunger.  "&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Teiyûkai|title=Kôbu daigakkô mukashibanashi|location=Tokyo|publisher= Teiyûkai|year=1926|pages=25–26|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1770 English engineer [[Edward Nairne]] is reported to have developed the first widely marketed rubber eraser, for an inventions competition. Until that time the material was known as ''gum elastic'' or by its Native American name (via French) ''caoutchouc''. Nairne sold natural rubber erasers for the high price of three shillings per half-inch cube. According to Nairne, he inadvertently picked up a piece of rubber instead of breadcrumbs, discovered rubber's erasing properties, and began selling rubber erasers. The invention was described by [[Joseph Priestley]] on April 15, 1770, in a footnote: "I have seen a substance excellently adapted to the purpose of wiping from paper the mark of black-lead-pencil. ... It is sold by Mr. Nairne, Mathematical Instrument-Maker, opposite the Royal-Exchange."&lt;ref&gt;See the footnote on page xv at the end of the preface to the following: {{cite book | title = A Familiar Introduction to the Theory and Practice of Perspective | author = Priestley, Joseph | year = 1770 | publisher = J.

Simpson (ed.), ''Rubber Basics'', iSmithers Rapra Publishing, 2002, {{ISBN|185957307X}}, p.46 "Rubber"&lt;/ref&gt;

However, raw rubber was perishable. In 1839 [[Charles Goodyear]] discovered the process of [[vulcanization]], a method that would [[Curing (chemistry)|cure]] rubber, making it durable. Rubber erasers became common with the advent of vulcanization.

On March 30, 1858, [[Hymen Lipman]] of [[Philadelphia]], USA, received the first [[patent]] for attaching an eraser to the end of a pencil. It was later invalidated because it was determined to be simply a composite of two devices rather than an entirely new product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://supreme.justia.com/us/92/347/case.html |title=Reckendorfer v. Faber 92 U.S. 347 (1875) |publisher=Justia |accessdate=2014-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Erasers may be free-standing blocks (''block'' and ''wedge eraser''), or conical caps that can slip onto the end of a pencil (''cap eraser''). A ''[[barrel]]'' or ''click eraser'' is a device shaped like a pencil, but instead of being filled with [[pencil lead]], its barrel contains a retractable cylinder of eraser material (most commonly soft vinyl). Many, but not all, wooden pencils are made with attached erasers.&lt;ref name=how&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.madehow.com/Volume-5/Eraser.html|title=How eraser is made}}&lt;/ref&gt; Novelty erasers made in shapes intended to be amusing are often made of hard vinyl, which tends to smear heavy markings when used as an eraser.

===Pencil or cap erasers===
Originally made from natural rubber, but now usually from cheaper [[Styrene-butadiene|SBR]], this type contains mineral fillers and an abrasive such as pumice with a [[plasticizer]] such as vegetable oil.&lt;ref name=how/&gt;  They are relatively hard (in order to remain attached to the pencil) and frequently coloured pink.

===Artist's gum eraser===
The stylized word "Artgum" was first used in 1903 and trademarked in the USA in 1907.&lt;ref&gt;Reg. No. 60496 &amp; No. 435240, ''ERASERS OR ELASTIC COMPOSITIONS FOR ERASING MARKS FROM AND CLEANING DRAWINGS, TRACINGS, PICTURES'' [http://tmsearch.uppto.gov]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; That type of eraser was originally made from oils such as [[corn oil]] [[vulcanized]] with [[sulfur dichloride]]&lt;ref&gt;US patent 2676160&lt;/ref&gt; although may now be made from natural or synthetic rubber or vinyl compounds. It is very soft yet retains its shape and is not mechanically plastic, instead crumbling as it is used. It is especially suited to cleaning large areas without damaging paper. However, they are so soft as to be imprecise in use. The removed graphite is carried away in the crumbles, leaving the eraser clean, but resulting in a lot of eraser residue. This residue must then be brushed away with care, as the eraser particles are coated with the graphite and can make new marks.  Art gum erasers are traditionally tan or brown, but some are blue.

===Vinyl erasers===
High-quality plasticized [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]] or other "plastic" erasers, originally trademarked ''Mylar'' in the mid-20th century, are softer, non-abrasive, and erase cleaner than standard rubber erasers. This is because the removed graphite does not remain on the eraser as much as rubber erasers, but is instead absorbed into the discarded vinyl scraps. Being softer and non-abrasive, they are less likely to damage canvas or paper. Engineers favor this type of eraser for work on [[technical drawing]]s due to their gentleness on paper with less smearing to surrounding areas. They often come in white and can be found in a variety of shapes.  More recently, very low-cost erasers are manufactured from highly plasticized vinyl compounds and made in decorative shapes.

===Kneaded erasers===
{{main article|Kneaded eraser}}
[[Kneaded eraser]]s have a plastic consistency and are common to most artists' standard toolkit. They can be pulled into a point for erasing small areas and tight detail erasing, molded into a textured surface and used like a reverse stamp to give texture, or used in a "blotting" manner to lighten lines or shading without completely erasing them. They gradually lose their efficacy and resilience as they become infused with particles picked up from erasing and from their environment. They are not suited to erase large areas because of their tendency to deform under vigorous erasing.

===Poster putty===
Commonly sold in retail outlets with school supplies and home improvement products, this soft, malleable putty appears in many colours and under numerous brand names. Intended to adhere posters and prints to walls without damaging the underlying wall surface, poster putty works much the same as traditional kneaded erasers, but with a greater tack and in some circumstances, lifting strength. Poster putty does not erase so much as lighten by directly pulling particles of graphite, charcoal or pastel from a drawing. In this regard, poster putty does not smudge or damage work in the process. Repeatedly touching the putty to a drawing pulls ever more medium free, gradually lightening the work in a controlled fashion. Poster putty can be shaped into fine points or knife edges, making it ideal for detailed or small areas of work. It can be rolled across a surface to create visual textures. Poster putty loses its efficacy with use, becoming less tacky as the material grows polluted with debris and oils from the user's skin.

===Electric erasers===
The electric eraser was invented in 1932 by [[Arthur Dremel]] of Racine, Wisconsin, USA.&lt;ref name=hist&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Piedmont-Palladino|first1=Susan|title=The Invisible History of Erasing|journal=Blueprints (National Building Museum)|date=Summer 2005|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It used a replaceable cylinder of eraser material held by a [[chuck (engineering)|chuck]] driven on the axis of a motor. The speed of rotation allowed less pressure to be used, which minimized paper damage. Originally standard pencil-eraser rubber was used, later replaced by higher-performance vinyl. [[Dremel]] went on to develop an entire line of hand-held rotary power tools.

===Fibreglass erasers===
A fibreglass eraser, a bundle of very fine glass fibres, can be used for erasing&lt;ref&gt;Rendering with Pen and Ink (The Thames &amp; Hudson Manuals), Robert W Gill. 1984, p191-193&lt;/ref&gt; and other tasks requiring abrasion. Typically the eraser is a pen-shaped device with a replaceable insert with glass fibres, which wear down in use. The fibres are very hard; in addition to removing pencil and pen markings, such erasers are used for cleaning traces on electronic circuit boards to facilitate soldering, removing rust, and many other applications. As an example of an unusual use, a fibreglass eraser was used for preparing an [[archaeological]] [[fossil]] embedded in a very hard and massive limestone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stecher|first=Rico|date=2008|title=A new Triassic pterosaur from Switzerland (Central Austroalpine,  Grisons), Raeticodactylus filisurensis gen. et sp. nov. |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Rico_Stecher/publication/225173595_A_new_Triassic_pterosaur_from_Switzerland_%28Central_Austroalpine_Grisons%29_Raeticodactylus_filisurensisgen._et_sp._nov/links/0f31752e97092454a0000000.pdf|journal=Swiss J. Geosci.|publisher=Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel|doi=10.1007/s00015-008-1252-6|accessdate=16 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other===
Felt [[chalkboard eraser]]s or blackboard dusters are used to erase chalk markings on a [[chalkboard]]. Chalk writing leaves light-coloured particles weakly adhering to a dark surface (e.g., white on black, or yellow on green); it can be rubbed off with a soft material, such as a rag. Erasers for chalkboards are made, with a block of plastic or wood, much larger than an eraser for pen or pencil, with a layer of felt on one side. The block is held in the hand and the felt rubbed against the writing, which it easily wipes off. Chalk dust is released, some of which sticks to the eraser until it is cleaned, usually by hitting it against a hard surface.

Various types of eraser, depending upon the board and the type of ink used, are used to erase a [[whiteboard]].

Dedicated erasers that are supplied with some [[ballpen]]s and [[permanent marker]]s are intended only to erase the ink of the writing instrument they are made for; sometimes this is done by making the ink bond more strongly to the material of an eraser than the surface it was applied to.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Patent 3875105&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Esperanto''' is a [[constructed language]]. It is designed to have a highly regular grammar, and as such is considered an easy language to learn.

Each part of speech has a unique suffix: nouns end with ''‑o''; adjectives with ''‑a''; present‑tense indicative verbs with ''‑as'', and so on.

It is possible to communicate effectively with a vocabulary of 400 to 500 "meaning words", though more exist in the language. The original vocabulary of Esperanto had around 900 meaning words, but was quickly expanded.

Reference grammars include the ''[[:eo:Plena Analiza Gramatiko|Plena Analiza Gramatiko (eo)]]'' ({{lang-en|Complete Analytical Grammar}}) by [[Kálmán Kalocsay]] and [[Gaston Waringhien]], and the ''[[Plena Manlibro de Esperanta Gramatiko]]'' ({{lang-en|Complete Handbook of Esperanto Grammar}}) by [[Bertilo Wennergren]].

==Grammatical summary==
Esperanto has an [[agglutinative language|agglutinative]] [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], no [[grammatical gender]], and simple [[grammatical conjugation|verbal]] and [[noun case|nominal inflections]]. Verbal suffixes indicate four moods, of which the [[Indicative mood|indicative]] has three [[grammatical tense|tenses]], and are [[Inflection#Vs. derivation|derived]] for several [[Lexical aspect|aspects]], but do not agree with the [[grammatical person]] or [[grammatical number|number]] of their [[Subject (grammar)|subjects]]. [[Noun]]s and [[adjective]]s have two [[noun case|cases]], [[nominative case|nominative]]/[[oblique case|oblique]] and [[accusative case|accusative]]/[[allative case|allative]], and two [[grammatical number|numbers]], [[Grammatical number|singular]] and [[plural]]; the adjectival form of [[personal pronoun]]s behaves like a [[genitive case]]. Adjectives generally [[agreement (linguistics)|agree]] with nouns in case and number. In addition to indicating [[direct object]]s, the accusative/allative case is used with nouns, adjectives and [[adverb]]s for showing the destination of a motion, or for replacing certain [[preposition]]s; the nominative/oblique is used in all other situations. The case system allows for a flexible [[word order]] that reflects [[information flow]] and other [[pragmatics|pragmatic]] concerns, as in [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Greek language|Greek]], and [[Latin]].

==Script and pronunciation==
{{Main|Esperanto orthography}}

Esperanto uses the [[Latin alphabet]] with six additional letters{{spnd}}ĉ, ĝ, ĥ, ĵ, ŝ, and ŭ{{spnd}}and does not use the letters q, w, x, or y.

Zamenhof suggested [[Italian language|Italian]] as a model for [[Esperanto pronunciation]].

==The article==
Esperanto has a single [[definite article]], ''la'', which is invariable. It is similar to English "the".

''La'' is used:

:For identifiable, countable objects:
::''Mi trovis botelon kaj deprenis la fermilon.''
:::"I found a bottle and took off the lid."
:For representative individuals:
::''La gepardo estas la plej rapida el la bestoj.''
:::"The cheetah is the fastest of the animals."
::''La abeloj havas felon, sed ili ne taŭgas por karesi.''
:::"Bees have fur, but they're no good for petting."
:For adjectives used as nouns, such as ethnic adjectives used as the names of languages:
::''la blua''
::: "the blue one"
::''la angla''
::: "English" (i.e. "the English language")
:For [[possessive pronoun]]s, when definite:
::''La mia bluas, la via ruĝas.''
:::"Mine is blue, yours is red".

The article is also used for [[inalienable possession]] of body parts and [[Kinship terminology|kin terms]], where English would use a [[possessive adjective]]:
:''Ili tranĉis la manon.''
::"They cut their hands." [one hand each]

The article ''la'', like the [[demonstrative adjective]] ''tiu'' (this, that), occurs at the beginning of the [[noun phrase]].

There is no grammatically required [[indefinite article]]: ''homo'' means either "human being" or "a human being", depending on the context, and similarly the plural ''homoj'' means "human beings" or "some human beings". The words ''iu'' and ''unu'' (or their plurals ''iuj'' and ''unuj'') may be used somewhat like indefinite articles, but they're closer in meaning to "some" and "a certain" than to English "a". This use of ''unu'' corresponds to English "a" when the "a" indicates a specific individual.&lt;ref&gt;Sergio Pokrovskij (2007) [http://lingvakritiko.com/2007/02/05/la-artikolo/#specifa 'La artikolo'], in ''Lingva Kritiko: Studoj kaj notoj pri la Internacia Lingvo''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parts of speech==
The suffixes ''‑o'', ''‑a'', ''‑e'', and ''‑i'' indicate that a word is a [[noun]], [[adjective]], [[adverb]], and [[infinitive]] [[verb]], respectively. Many new words can be derived simply by changing these suffixes. Derivations from the word ''vidi'' (to see) are ''vida'' (visual), ''vide'' (visually), and ''vido'' (vision).

Each [[root word]] has an inherent [[part of speech]]: nominal, adjectival, verbal, or adverbial. These must be memorized explicitly and affect the use of the part-of-speech suffixes. With an adjectival or verbal root, the nominal suffix ''‑o'' indicates an abstraction: ''parolo'' (an act of speech, one's word) from the verbal root ''paroli'' (to speak); ''belo'' (beauty) from the adjectival root ''bela'' (beautiful); whereas with a noun, the nominal suffix simply indicates the noun. Nominal or verbal roots may likewise be modified with the adjectival suffix ''‑a'': ''reĝa'' (royal), from the nominal root ''reĝo'' (a king); ''parola'' (spoken). The various verbal endings mean ''to be [__]'' when added to an adjectival root: ''beli'' (to be beautiful); and with a nominal root they mean "to act as" the noun, "to use" the noun, etc., depending on the semantics of the root: ''reĝi'' (to reign). There are relatively few adverbial roots, so most words ending in ''-e'' are derived: ''bele'' (beautifully). Often with a nominal or verbal root, the English equivalent is a [[prepositional phrase]]: ''parole'' (by speech, orally); ''vide'' (by sight, visually); ''reĝe'' (like a king, royally).

The meanings of part-of-speech affixes depend on the inherent part of speech of the root they are applied to. For example, ''brosi'' (to brush) is based on a nominal root (and therefore listed in modern dictionaries under the entry ''bros'''o'''),'' whereas ''kombi'' (to comb) is based on a verbal root (and therefore listed under ''komb'''i''').'' Change the suffix to ''-o,'' and the similar meanings of ''brosi'' and ''kombi'' diverge: ''broso'' is a brush, the name of an instrument, whereas ''kombo'' is a combing, the name of an action. That is, changing verbal ''kombi'' (to comb) to a noun simply creates the name for the action; for the name of the tool, the suffix ''-ilo'' is used, which derives words for instruments from verbal roots: ''kombilo'' (a comb). On the other hand, changing the nominal root ''broso'' (a brush) to a verb gives the action associated with that noun, ''brosi'' (to brush). For the name of the action, the suffix ''-ado'' will change a derived verb back to a noun: ''brosado'' (a brushing). Similarly, an abstraction of a nominal root (changing it to an adjective and then back to a noun) requires the suffix ''-eco,'' as in ''infaneco'' (childhood), but an abstraction of an adjectival or verbal root merely requires the nominal ''-o: belo'' (beauty). Nevertheless, redundantly affixed forms such as ''beleco'' are acceptable and widely used.

A limited number of basic adverbs do not end with ''-e,'' but with an undefined part-of-speech ending ''-aŭ''. Not all words ending in ''-aŭ'' are adverbs, and most of the adverbs that end in ''-aŭ'' have other functions, such as ''hodiaŭ'' "today" [noun or adverb] or ''ankoraŭ'' "yet, still" [conjunction or adverb]. About a dozen other adverbs are bare roots, such as ''nun'' "now", ''tro'' "too, too much", not counting the adverbs among the [[Table of correlatives (Esperanto)|correlatives]]. (See [[special Esperanto adverbs]].)

Other parts of speech occur as bare roots, without special suffixes. These are the prepositions ''(al'' "to"), conjunctions ''(kaj'' "and"), interjections ''(ho'' "oh"), numerals ''(du'' "two"), and pronouns ''(mi'' "I"—The final ''-i'' found on pronouns is not a suffix, but part of the root). There are also several grammatical "[[grammatical particle|particles]]" that fit neatly into no category, and which must generally precede the words they modify, such as ''ne'' (not), ''ankaŭ'' (also), ''nur'' (only), ''eĉ'' (even).

==Nouns and adjectives==
A suffix ''-j'' following the noun or adjective suffixes ''-o'' or ''-a'' makes a word plural. Without this suffix, a [[countable noun]] is understood to be singular. [[Direct object]]s take an [[accusative case]] suffix ''-n,'' which goes after any plural suffix. (The resulting sequence ''-ojn'' rhymes with English ''coin,'' and ''-ajn'' rhymes with ''fine.)''

Adjectives [[agreement (linguistics)|agree]] with nouns. That is, they are plural if the nouns that they [[Grammatical modifier|modify]] are plural, and accusative if the nouns that they modify are accusative. Compare ''bona tago; bonaj tagoj; bonan tagon; bonajn tagojn'' (good day/days). This requirement allows for free word orders of adjective-noun and noun-adjective, even when two noun phrases are adjacent in [[subject–object–verb]] or [[verb–subject–object]] clauses:

:''la knabino feliĉa'''n''' knabo'''n''' kisis'' (the girl kissed a happy boy)
:''la knabino feliĉa knabo'''n''' kisis'' (the happy girl kissed a boy).

Agreement clarifies the [[syntax]] in other ways also. Adjectives take the plural suffix when they modify more than one noun, even if those nouns are all singular:
:''ruĝa'''j''' domo kaj aŭto'' (a red house and [a red] car)
:''ruĝa domo kaj aŭto'' (a red house and a car).

A [[predicative adjective]] does not take the accusative case suffix even when the noun that it modifies does:
:''mi farbis la pordo'''n''' ruĝa'''n''''' (I painted the red door)
:''mi farbis la pordo'''n''' ruĝa'' (I painted the door red).

==Pronouns==
There are three types of [[pronoun]]s in Esperanto: [[personal pronoun|personal]] ''(vi'' "you plural"), [[demonstrative]] ''(tio'' "that", ''iu'' "someone"), and [[relative pronoun|relative]]/[[interrogative word|interrogative]] ''(kio'' "what").
According to the fifth rule&lt;ref&gt;http://www.akademio-de-esperanto.org/fundamento/gramatiko_angla.html&lt;/ref&gt; of the ''Fundamento de Esperanto'':
{{Quote

{{note|1|¹}} Zamenhof introduced the singular second-person pronoun ''ci'' to be used in translations from languages where the [[T–V distinction]] is important, and added it in the ''Dua Libro'' in 1888 clarifying that "this word is only found in the dictionary; in the language itself it is hardly ever used".&lt;ref name="Dua_Libro"/&gt; It has never been widely used, even by Zamenhof himself, who didn't include it as a pronoun in the 5th rule of the ''Fundamento''&lt;ref name="Fundamento"/&gt; and in his 28th ''Lingva Respondo'', published in 1908, recommended to use only ''vi''.&lt;ref name="Lingvaj_Respondoj_28"/&gt; The normal usage is to use ''vi'' regardless of number or formality.&lt;ref name="PMEG"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Eventoj"/&gt; However, especially in some circles, people have begun to use ''ci'' in practical speech.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Personal pronouns take the [[accusative]] suffix ''-n'' as nouns do: ''min'' (me), ''lin'' (him), ''ŝin'' (her). [[Possessive adjective]]s are formed with the adjectival suffix ''-a: mia'' (my), ''ĝia'' (its), ''nia'' (our). These agree with their noun like any other [[adjective]]: ''ni salutis liajn amikojn'' (we greeted his friends). Esperanto does not have separate forms for the [[possessive pronoun]]s; this sense is generally (though not always) indicated with the definite article: ''la mia'' (mine).

The [[reflexive pronoun]] is used, in non-subject phrases only, to refer back to the subject, usually only in the third and indefinite persons:
:''li lavis sin'' "he washed" (himself)
:''ili lavis sin'' "they washed" (themselves or each other)
:''li lavis lin'' "he washed him" (someone else)
:''li manĝis '''sian''' panon'' "he ate his bread" (his own bread)
:''li manĝis '''lian''' panon'' "he ate his bread" (someone else's bread).

The indefinite pronoun is used when making general statements, and is often used where English would have the subject ''it'' with a passive verb,
:''oni diras, ke ...'' "One says that...", meaning: "they say that ..." or "it's said that ..."
With "impersonal" verbs where there is actually no item or being that is doing an action, no pronoun is used:
:''pluvas'' "rains; is raining; it's raining".

The rain is falling by itself, therefore the subject pronoun is omitted.

''Ĝi'' ("it"; third person neutral) is mostly used with items that have physical bodies. Zamenhof proposed that this pronoun can also be used as an [[wikt:epicene|epicene]] (gender-neutral) third-person singular pronoun, meaning for use when the gender of an individual is unknown or for when the speaker simply doesn't wish to clarify the gender.&lt;ref&gt;Respondo 23, La Revuo, 1901, Aŭgusto&lt;/ref&gt; However, this proposal is not generally accepted.

In popular usage it's usually only used when referring to children:
:''La infano estas ploranta, ĉar ĝi volas manĝi'' "the child is crying, because it wants to eat".
When speaking of adults or people in general, in popular usage it is much more common for the demonstrative adjective and pronoun ''tiu'' ("that thing or person that is already known to the listener") to be used in such situations. This mirrors languages such as Japanese, but it's not a method that can always be used. For example, in the sentence
:''Iu ĵus diris, ke '''tiu''' malsatas'' "Someone just said that ''that thing/person'' is hungry",
the word ''tiu'' would be understood as referring to someone other than the person speaking (like English pronouns ''this'' or ''that'' but also referring to people), and so cannot be used in place of ''ĝi'', ''li'' or ''ŝi.''

===Other pronouns===
The [[demonstrative pronoun|demonstrative]] and [[relative pronoun]]s form part of the [[Table of correlatives (Esperanto)|correlative system]], and are described in that article. The pronouns are the forms ending in ''-o'' (simple pronouns) and ''-u'' (adjectival pronouns). Their accusative case is formed in ''-n,'' but the genitive case ends in ''-es,'' which is the same for singular and plural and does not take accusative marking. Compare the nominative phases ''lia domo'' (his house) and ''ties domo'' (that one's house, those ones' house) with the plural ''lia'''j''' domo'''j''''' (his houses) and ''ties domo'''j''''' (that one's houses, those ones' houses), and with the accusative genitive ''lia'''n''' domo'''n''''' and ''ties domo'''n'''.''&lt;ref&gt;An unofficial but widely recognized accusative preposition ''na'' has become popular with some Esperantists on the internet and may be used in such situations, especially when there is no following noun ''(ties,'' accusative ''na ties)''. The purposefully ambiguous preposition ''je'' may be so used as well (accusative ''je ties)'', though normally the ''-es'' words are simply not inflected for case.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prepositions==
Although Esperanto [[word order]] is fairly free, [[preposition]]s must come at the beginning of a [[noun phrase]]. Whereas in languages such as German, prepositions may require that a noun be in various [[case (linguistics)|cases]] ([[accusative]], [[dative]], ''and so on),'' in Esperanto all prepositions govern the [[nominative]]: ''por Johano'' (for John). The only exception is when there are two or more prepositions and one is ''replaced'' by the accusative.

Prepositions should be used with a definite meaning. When no one preposition is clearly correct, the indefinite preposition ''je'' should be used:
:''ili iros '''je''' la tria de majo'' (they'll go on the third of May: the "on" isn't literally true).

Alternatively, the accusative may be used without a preposition:
:''ili iros la tria'''n''' de majo.''

Note that although ''la trian'' (the third) is in the accusative, ''de majo'' (of May) is still a [[prepositional phrase]], and so the noun ''majo'' remains in the nominative case.

A frequent use of the accusative is in place of ''al'' (to) to indicate the direction or goal of motion ([[allative case|allative construction]]). It is especially common when there would otherwise be a double preposition:
:''la kato ĉasis la muson '''en''' la domo'' (the cat chased the mouse '''in''' [inside of] the house)
:''la kato ĉasis la muson '''en''' la domo'''n''''' (the cat chased the mouse '''into''' the house).

The accusative/allative may stand in for other prepositions also, especially when they have vague meanings that add not much to the clause. Adverbs, with or without the case suffix, are frequently used instead of prepositional phrases:
:''li iris '''al''' sia hejmo'' (he went to his home)
:''li iris hejme'''n''''' (he went home)

Both ''por'' and ''pro'' often translate English 'for'. However, they distinguish ''for a goal'' (looking forward in time, or causing: ''por'') and ''for a cause'' (looking back in time, or being caused by: ''pro''): To vote ''por'' your friend means to cast a ballot with their name on it, whereas to vote ''pro'' your friend would mean to vote in their place or as they asked you to.

The preposition most distinct from English usage is perhaps ''de'', which corresponds to English ''of, from, off,'' and ''(done) by'':
:''libro '''de''' Johano'' (John''''s''' book)
:''li venis '''de''' la butiko'' (he came '''from''' the shop)
:''mordita '''de''' hundo'' (bitten '''by''' a dog)

However, English ''of'' corresponds to several Esperanto prepositions also: ''de, el'' (out of, made of), and ''da'' (quantity of, unity of form and contents):
:''tablo '''el''' ligno'' (a table '''of''' wood)
:''glaso '''da''' vino'' (a glass '''of''' wine)
:''listo '''da''' kondiĉoj '''de''' la kandidatoj'' (a list '''of''' conditions '''from''' the candidates)
The last of these, ''[[wikt:da#Esperanto|da]]'', is semantically Slavic and is difficult for Western Europeans, to the extent that even many Esperanto dictionaries and grammars define it incorrectly.&lt;ref&gt;Sergio Pokrovskij, 2007. "[http://lingvakritiko.com/2007/02/05/la-artikolo/#Da La artikolo]", in ''Lingva Kritiko: Studoj kaj notoj pri la Internacia Lingvo''.&lt;br/&gt;See the entry for [[wikt:da#Esperanto|''da'' at Wiktionary]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Occasionally a new preposition is coined. Because a bare [[root (linguistics)|root]] may indicate a preposition or [[interjection]], removing the grammatical suffix from another part of speech can be used to derive a preposition or interjection. For example, from ''fari'' (to do, to make) we get the preposition ''far'' (done by).

==Verbs==
All verbal inflection is regular. There are three tenses, all of which are in the [[indicative mood]]. The other moods are the [[infinitive]], [[conditional mood|conditional]], and [[Jussive mood|jussive]]. No [[Grammatical aspect|aspectual]] distinctions are required by the grammar, but derivational expressions of [[Lexical aspect|Aktionsart]] are common.

Verbs do not change form according to their [[subject (grammar)|subject]]. ''I am, we are,'' and ''he is'' are simply ''mi estas, ni estas,'' and ''li estas,'' respectively. Impersonal subjects are not used: ''pluvas'' (it is raining); ''estas muso en la domo'' (there's a mouse in the house).

Most verbs are inherently [[Transitive verb|transitive]] or [[Intransitive verb|intransitive]]. As with the inherent part of speech of a root, this is not apparent from the shape of the verb and must simply be memorized. Transitivity is changed with the suffixes ''-ig-'' (the transitivizer/[[causative]]) and ''-iĝ-'' (the intransitivizer/[[middle voice]]):
:''akvo bolas je cent gradoj'' (water boils at 100 degrees)
:''ni bol'''ig'''as la akvo'''n''''' (we boil the water).

===The verbal paradigm===
The tenses have characteristic vowels. ''A'' indicates the present tense, ''i'' the past, and ''o'' the future.

|}

The verbal forms may be illustrated with the root ''esper-'' (hope):
:''esperi'' (to hope)
:''esperas'' (hopes, is hoping)
:''esperis'' (hoped, was hoping)
:''esperos'' (shall hope, will hope)
:''esperu'' (hope!; a command)
:''esperus'' (were to hope, would hope)

A verb can be made emphatic with the particle ''ja'' (indeed): ''mi ja esperas'' (I do hope), ''mi ja esperis'' (I did hope).

===Tense===
As in English, Esperanto [[present tense]] may be used for generic statements such as "birds fly" (''la birdoj flugas'').

The Esperanto [[future tense|future]] is a true tense, used whenever future time is meant. For example, in English "(I'll give it to you) when I see you" the verb "see" is in the present tense despite the time being in the future; in Esperanto, future tense is required: ''(Mi donos ĝin al vi) kiam mi vidos vin''.

Esperanto tense is [[relative tense|relative]]. This differs from English absolute tense, where the tense is past, present, or future of the moment of speaking: In Esperanto, the tense of a [[subordinate clause|subordinate verb]] is instead anterior or posterior to the time of the main verb. For example, "John said that he would go" is in Esperanto ''Johano diris, ke li iros'' (lit., "John said that he will go"); this does not mean that he will go at some point in the future from now (as "John said that he will go" means in English), but that at the time he said this, his going was still in the future.

===Mood===
The [[conditional mood]] is used for such expressions as ''se mi povus, mi irus'' (if I could, I would go) and ''se mi estus vi, mi irus'' (if I were you, I'd go).

The [[jussive mood]], is used for wishing and requesting, and serves as the [[Imperative mood|imperative]] and [[subjunctive]]:
:''Iru!'' (Go!)
:''Mi petis, ke li venu.'' (I asked him to come.)
:''Li parolu.'' (Let him speak.)
:''Ni iru.'' (Let's go.)
:''Benu ĉi tiun domaĉon.'' (Bless this bad house.)
:''Mia filino belu!'' (May my daughter be beautiful!)

===Copula===
The verb ''esti'' (to be) is both the [[copula (linguistics)|copula]] ("X is Y") and the existential ("there is") verb. As a copula linking two [[noun phrase]]s, it causes neither to take the accusative case. Therefore, unlike the situation with other verbs, word order with ''esti'' can be semantically important: compare ''hundoj estas personoj'' (dogs are people) and ''personoj estas hundoj'' (people are dogs).

It is becoming increasingly common to replace ''esti''-plus-adjective with a verb: ''la ĉielo estas blua'' or ''la ĉielo bluas'' (the sky is blue). This is a stylistic rather than grammatical change in the language, as the more economical verbal forms were always found in poetry.&lt;ref&gt;However, the reverse is not true, as this does not change the inherent part of speech: ''Morti'' (to die) does not have the same meaning as ''esti morta'' (to be dead).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Participles==
[[Participle]]s are verbal derivatives. In Esperanto, there are six forms:
* three aspects: past (or "perfective"), present (or "progressive"), and future (or "predictive")
times
* two [[Grammatical voice|voices]]: [[active voice|active]] (performing an action) and [[passive voice|passive]] (receiving an action)
The participles represent aspect by retaining the vowel of the related verbal tense: '''i''', '''a''', '''o'''. In addition to carrying aspect, participles are the principal means of representing [[Grammatical voice|voice]], with either '''nt''' or '''t''' following the vowel (see next section).

===Adjectival participles===
The basic principle of the participles may be illustrated with the verb ''fali'' (to fall). Picture a cartoon character running off a cliff. Before the character falls, they are ''fal'''o'''nta'' (about to fall). As they drop, they are ''fal'''a'''nta'' (falling). After they hit the ground, they are ''fal'''i'''nta'' (fallen).

Active and passive pairs can be illustrated with the transitive verb ''haki'' (to chop). Picture a woodsman approaching a tree with an axe, intending to chop it down. He is ''hak'''ont'''a'' (about to chop) and the tree is ''hak'''ot'''a'' (about to be chopped). While swinging the axe, he is ''hak'''ant'''a'' (chopping) and the tree ''hak'''at'''a'' (being chopped). After the tree has fallen, he is ''hak'''int'''a'' (having chopped) and the tree ''hak'''it'''a'' (chopped).

Adjectival participles agree with nouns in number and case, just as other adjectives do:
:''ili ŝparis la arbojn '''hakotajn''''' (they spared the trees [that were] '''to be chopped down''').

===Compound tense===
Compound tenses are formed with the [[adjectival participle]]s plus ''esti'' (to be) as the auxiliary verb. The participle reflects aspect and voice, while the verb carries tense:
*Present [[Continuous aspect|progressive]]: ''mi estas kaptanta'' (I am catching [something]), ''mi estas kaptata'' (I am being caught)
*Present [[perfect (grammar)|perfect]]: ''mi estas kaptinta'' (I have caught [something]), ''mi estas kaptita'' (I have been caught, I am caught)
*Present [[prospective aspect|prospective]]: ''mi estas kaptonta'' (I am going to catch / about to catch), ''mi estas kaptota'' (I am going to be caught / about to be caught)

These are not used as often as their English equivalents. For "I ''am'' go''ing'' to the store", you would normally use the simple present ''mi iras'' in Esperanto.

The tense and mood of ''esti'' can be changed in these compound tenses:
:''mi estis kaptinta'' (I had caught)
:''mi estus kaptonta'' (I would be about to catch)
:''mi estos kaptanta'' (I will be catching).

Although such [[periphrastic]] constructions are familiar to speakers of most European languages, the option of contracting [''esti'' + adjective] into a verb is often seen for adjectival participles:

:''mi estas kaptinta'' or ''mi kaptintas'' (I have caught)
:''mi estis kaptinta'' or ''mi kaptintis'' (I had caught)

The active synthetic forms are:
{| class=wikitable
|+Synthetic compound tenses (active voice)
! !! Simple verb !! Progressive !! Perfect !! Prospective

! Present tense

| ''mi kaptontus'' &lt;br/&gt; (I would be about to catch)
|}

Infinitive and jussive forms are also found. There is a parallel passive paradigm. A few of these forms, notably ''-intus'' and ''-atas'', entered common usage, but most of them are very rare because they are difficult to understand.&lt;ref&gt;Bertilo Wennergren, ''Plena Manlibro de Esperanta Gramatiko'', [http://bertilow.com/pmeg/gramatiko/participoj/kunmetitaj_verboformoj/nekutimaj.html Nekutimaj kunmetitaj verboj]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nominal participles===
Participles may be turned into adverbs or nouns by replacing the adjectival suffix ''-a'' with ''-e'' or ''-o.'' This means that, in Esperanto, some nouns may be inflected for tense.

A nominal participle indicates ''one who participates'' in the action specified by the verbal root. For example, ''esperinto'' is a "hoper" (past tense), or ''one who had been hoping.''

===Adverbial participles===
[[Adverbial participle]]s are used with subjectless clauses:
:''Kaptinte la pilkon, li ekkuris golen'' (Having caught the ball, he started running for the goal).

===Conditional and tenseless participles (unofficial)===
Occasionally, the participle paradigm will be extended to include conditional participles, with the vowel ''u (-unt-, -ut-).''&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Reagan (2009) ''Language Matters: Reflections on Educational Linguistics'', p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; If, for example, in our tree-chopping example, the woodsman found that the tree had been [[Tree spiking|spiked]] and so couldn't be cut down after all, he would be ''hakunta'' and the tree ''hakuta'' (he, the one "who would chop", and the tree, the one that "would be chopped").

This can also be illustrated with the verb ''prezidi'' (to preside). Just after the recount of the [[U.S. presidential election, 2000|2000 United States presidential election]]:
*then-president [[Bill Clinton]] was still ''prezid'''a'''nto'' (current president) of the United States,
*president-elect [[George W. Bush]] was declared ''prezid'''o'''nto'' (president-to-be),
*the previous president [[George H. W. Bush]] was a ''prezid'''i'''nto'' (former president), and
*the contending candidate [[Al Gore]] was ''prezid'''u'''nto'' (would-be president – that is, if the recount had gone differently).&lt;ref&gt;This example is somewhat artificial, because the customary word for 'president' (of a country) is the tense-neutral word ''prezid'''e'''nto.'' ''Prezid'''a'''nto'' is typically used for the presidents of organizations other than sovereign countries, and ''prezid'''i'''nto'' is used for former presidents in such contexts.&lt;/ref&gt;

The tense-neutral word ''prezid'''e'''nto'' is officially a separate root, not a derivative of the verb ''prezidi.''

==Negation==
A statement is made negative by using ''ne'' or one of the negative ''(neni-)'' [[Table of correlatives (Esperanto)|correlatives]]. Ordinarily, only one negative word is allowed per clause:

: ''Mi ne faris ion ajn.'' I didn't do anything.

Two negatives within a clause cancel each other out, with the result being a positive sentence.

: ''Mi ne faris nenion. Mi ja faris ion.'' It is not the case that I did nothing. I did do something.

The word ''ne'' comes before the word it negates:
: ''Mi ne skribis tion'' (I didn't write that)
: ''Ne mi skribis tion'' (It wasn't I who wrote that)
: ''Mi skribis ne tion'' (It wasn't that that I wrote)

The latter will frequently be reordered as ''ne tion mi skribis'' depending on the flow of information.

==Questions==
{{main|Interrogatives in Esperanto}}

"Wh" questions are asked with one of the interrogative/relative ''(ki-'') [[Table of correlatives (Esperanto)|correlatives]]. They are commonly placed at the beginning of the sentence, but different word orders are allowed for stress:

:''Li scias, kion vi faris'' (He knows what you did.)
:''Kion vi faris?'' (What did you do?)
:''Vi faris kion?'' (You did ''what?)''

Yes/no questions are marked with the conjunction ''ĉu'' (whether):

:''Mi ne scias, ĉu li venos'' (I don't know whether he'll come)
:''Ĉu li venos?'' (Will he come?)

Such questions can be answered ''jes'' (yes) or ''ne'' (no) in the European fashion of aligning with the polarity of the answer, or ''ĝuste'' (correct) or ''malĝuste'' (incorrect) in the Japanese fashion of aligning with the polarity of the question:

:''Ĉu vi ne iris?'' (Did you not go?)
:''— Ne, mi ne iris'' (No, I didn't go); ''— Jes, mi iris'' (Yes, I went)
:''— Ĝuste, mi ne iris'' (Correct, I didn't go); ''— Malĝuste, mi iris'' (Incorrect, I did go)

Note that Esperanto questions may have the same word order as statements.

==Conjunctions==
Basic Esperanto [[Grammatical conjunction|conjunctions]] are ''kaj'' (both/and), ''aŭ'' (either/or), ''nek'' (neither/nor), ''se'' (if), ''ĉu'' (whether/or), ''sed'' (but), ''anstataŭ'' (instead of), ''krom'' (besides, in addition to), ''kiel'' (like, as), ''ke'' (that). Like prepositions, they precede the phrase or clause they modify:

:''Mi vidis kaj lin kaj lian amikon'' (I saw both him and his friend)
:''Estis nek hele nek agrable'' (it was neither clear [sunny] nor pleasant)
:''ĉu pro kaprico, ĉu pro natura lingvo-evoluo'' (whether by whim, or by natural language development)
:''Li volus, ke ni iru'' (he would like us to go)

However, unlike prepositions, they allow the accusative case, as in the following example from [[Don Harlow]]:

:''Li traktis min kiel princon'' (He treated me like a prince: that is, as he would treat a prince)
:''Li traktis min kiel princo'' (He treated me like a prince: that is, as a prince would treat me)

==Interjections==
[[Interjection]]s may be derived from bare affixes or roots: ''ek!'' (get going!), from the perfective prefix; ''um'' (um, er), from the indefinite/undefined suffix; ''fek!'' (shit!), from ''feki'' (to defecate).

==Word formation==
{{main|Esperanto vocabulary#Word formation|Esperanto word formation}}
Esperanto [[morphology (linguistics)|derivational morphology]] uses a large number of lexical and grammatical affixes ([[Prefix (linguistics)|prefixes]] and [[suffix]]es). These, along with compounding, decrease the memory load of the language, as they allow for the expansion of a relatively small number of basic roots into a large vocabulary. For example, the Esperanto root ''vid-'' (see) regularly corresponds to several dozen English words: ''see (saw, seen), sight, blind, vision, visual, visible, nonvisual, invisible, unsightly, glance, view, vista, panorama, observant'' etc., though there are also separate Esperanto roots for a couple of these concepts.

==Numbers==

===Numerals===
The cardinal [[Numeral (linguistics)|numerals]] are:

:''nul'' (zero)
:''unu'' (one)
:''du'' (two)
:''tri'' (three)
:''kvar'' (four)
:''kvin'' (five)
:''ses'' (six)
:''sep'' (seven)
:''ok'' (eight)
:''naŭ'' (nine)
:''dek'' (ten)
:''cent'' (one hundred)
:''mil'' (one thousand)

These are grammatically numerals, not nouns, and as such do not take the accusative case suffix. However, ''unu'' (and only ''unu'') is sometimes used adjectivally or demonstratively, meaning "a certain", and in such cases it may take the plural affix ''-j,'' just as the demonstrative pronoun ''tiu'' does:
:''unu'''j''' homo'''j'''''
:"certain people";
:''ili kuris unu'''j''' post la aliaj''
:"they ran some after others".
In such use ''unu'' is irregular in that it doesn't take the accusative affix ''-n'' in the singular, but does in the plural:
:''ia'''n''' unu ideo'''n'''''
:"some particular idea",
but
:''unuj objektoj venis en unu'''jn''' mano'''jn''', aliaj en aliajn manojn''
:"some objects came into certain hands, others into other hands".
Additionally, when counting off, the final ''u'' of ''unu'' may be dropped, as if it were a part-of-speech suffix:
:''Un'! Du! Tri! Kvar!''

===Higher numbers===
At numbers beyond the thousands, the international roots ''miliono'' (million) and ''miliardo'' (milliard) are used. Beyond this there are two systems: A ''[[Long and short scales|billion]]'' in most English-speaking countries is different from a ''billion'' in most other countries (10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; ''vs.'' 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; respectively; that is, a thousand million ''vs.'' a million million). The international root ''biliono'' is likewise ambiguous in Esperanto, and is deprecated for this reason. An unambiguous system based on adding the Esperanto suffix ''-iliono'' to numerals is generally used instead, sometimes supplemented by a second suffix ''-iliardo:''&lt;ref&gt;"[http://purl.org/net/voko/revo/art/bilion.html biliono]" at Reta Vortaro&lt;/ref&gt;

:10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;: ''miliono''
:10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;: ''miliardo'' (or ''mil milionoj'')
:10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;: ''duiliono''
:10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;: ''duiliardo'' (or ''mil duilionoj'')
:10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;: ''triiliono''
:10&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;: ''triiliardo'' (or ''mil triilionoj'')
:''etc.''

Note that these forms are grammatically nouns, not numerals, and therefore cannot modify a noun directly: ''mil homojn'' (a thousand people [accusative]) but ''milionon da homoj'' (a million people [accusative]).

===Compound numerals and derivatives===
Numerals are written together as one word when their values are multiplied, and separately when their values are added (''dudek'' 20, ''dek du'' 12, ''dudek du'' 22). Ordinals are formed with the adjectival suffix ''-a,'' quantities with the nominal suffix ''-o,'' multiples with ''-obl-,'' fractions with ''‑on‑'', collectives with ''‑op‑'', and repetitions with the root ''‑foj‑''.

:''sescent sepdek kvin'' (675)
:''tria'' (third [as in ''first, second, third''])
:''trie'' (thirdly)
:''dudeko'' (a score [20])
:''duobla'' (double)
:''kvarono'' (one fourth, a quarter)
:''duope'' (by twos)
:''dufoje'' (twice)

The particle ''po'' is used to mark distributive numbers, that is, the idea of distributing a certain number of items to each member of a group. Consequently, the [[logogram]] [[@]] is not used (except in email addresses, of course):
:''mi donis al ili po tri pomojn'' or ''pomojn mi donis al ili po tri'' (I gave [to] them three apples each).

Note that particle ''po'' forms a phrase with the numeral ''tri'' and is not a preposition for the noun phrase ''tri pomojn,'' so it does not prevent a grammatical object from taking the accusative case.

==Comparisons==
Comparisons are made with the adverbial correlatives ''tiel ... kiel'' (as ... as), the adverbial roots ''pli'' (more) and ''plej'' (most), the antonym prefix ''mal-,'' and the preposition ''ol'' (than):

:''mi skribas tiel bone kiel vi'' (I write as well as you)
:''tiu estas pli bona ol tiu'' (this one is better than that one)
:''tio estas la plej bona'' (that's the best)
:''la mia estas malpli multekosta ol la via'' (mine is less expensive than yours)

Implied comparisons are made with ''tre'' (very) and ''tro'' (too [much]).

Phrases like "The more people, the smaller the portions" and "All the better!" are translated using ''ju'' and ''des'' in place of "the":
:'''''Ju''' pli da homoj, '''des''' malpli grandaj la porcioj'' (The more people, the smaller the portions)
:'''''Des''' pli bone!'' (All the better!)

==Word order==
Esperanto has a fairly [[free word order|flexible word order]]. However, word order does play a role in Esperanto grammar, even if a much lesser role than it does in English. For example, the negative particle ''ne'' generally comes before the element being negated; negating the verb has the effect of negating the entire clause (or rather, there is ambiguity between negating the verb alone and negating the clause):
:''mi ne iris'' 'I didn't go'
:''mi ne iris, mi revenis'' 'I didn't go, I came back'
:''ne mi iris'' or ''iris ne mi'' 'it wasn't me who went'
:''mi iris ne al la butiko sed hejmen'' 'I went not to the shop but home'.
However, when the entire clause is negated, the ''ne'' may be left till last:
:''mi iris ne'' 'I went not'.

The last order reflects a typical [[topic–comment]] (or [[theme–rheme]]) order: Known information, the topic under discussion, is introduced first, and what one has to say about it follows. (I went not: As for my going, there was none.) For example, yet another order, ''ne iris mi'', would suggest that the possibility of not having gone was under discussion, and ''mi'' is given as an example of one who did not go.

Compare:&lt;ref&gt;Sergio Pokrovskij (2007) [http://lingvakritiko.com/2007/02/05/la-artikolo/#vortordo 'La artikolo'], in ''Lingva Kritiko: Studoj kaj notoj pri la Internacia Lingvo''&lt;/ref&gt;

:''Pasintjare mi feriis en Italujo''
::'Last year I vacationed in Italy' (Italy was the place I went on holiday)
:''En Italujo mi feriis pasintjare''
::'I vacationed in Italy last year' (last year was when I went)
:''En Italujo pasintjare mi feriis''
::'In Italy last year I went on vacation' (a vacation is why I went)
:''En Italujo pasintjare feriis mi''
::(I am the one who went)

===The noun phrase===
Within a noun phrase, either the order ''adjective–noun'' or ''noun–adjective'' may occur, though the former is somewhat more common. Less flexibility occurs with numerals and demonstratives, with ''numeral–noun'' and ''demonstrative–noun'' being the norm, as in English.
:''blua ĉielo'' 'a blue sky'
:''tiu ĉielo'' 'that sky'
:''tiu blua ĉielo'' 'that blue sky'
:''sep bluaj ĉieloj'' 'seven blue heavens'

Adjective–noun order is much freer. With simple adjectives, adjective–noun order predominates, especially if the noun is long or complex. However, a long or complex adjective typically comes after the noun, in some cases parallel to structures in English, as in the second example below:&lt;ref name=wells/&gt;
:''homo malgrandanima kaj ege avara'' 'a petty and extremely greedy person'
:''vizaĝo plena de cikatroj'' 'a face full of scars'
:''ideo fantazia sed tamen interesa'' 'a fantastic but still interesting idea'

Adjectives also normally occur after correlative nouns. Again, this is one of the situations where adjectives come after nouns in English:
:''okazis io stranga'' 'something strange happened'
:''ne ĉio brilanta estas diamanto'' 'not everything shiny is a diamond'
Changing the word order here can change the meaning, at least with the correlative ''nenio'' 'nothing':
:''li manĝis nenion etan'' 'he ate nothing little'
:''li manĝis etan nenion'' 'he ate a little nothing'

With multiple words in a phrase, the order is typically demonstrative/pronoun–numeral–(adjective/noun):
:''miaj du grandaj amikoj ~ miaj du amikoj grandaj'' 'my two great friends'.

However, the article ''la'' precedes a noun phrase:
:''la blua ĉielo'' "the blue sky"

In [[prepositional phrase]]s, the preposition is ''required'' to come at the front of the noun phrase (that is, even before the article ''la''), though it is commonly replaced by turning the noun into an adverb:
:''al la ĉielo'' 'to the sky' or ''ĉielen'' 'skywards', never ''*ĉielo al''

===Constituent order===
[[Constituent order]] ''within'' a clause is generally free, apart from copular clauses.

The default order is [[subject–verb–object]], though any order may occur, with subject and object distinguished by case, and other constituents distinguished by prepositions:
:''la hundo ĉasis la katon'' 'the dog chased/hunted the cat'
:''la katon ĉasis la hundo''
:''ĉasis la hundo la katon''
:''ĉasis la katon la hundo''
:''la hundo la katon ĉasis''
:''la katon la hundo ĉasis''
The expectation of a topic–comment (theme–rheme) order apply here, so the context will influence word order: in ''la katon ĉasis la hundo'', the cat is the topic of the conversation, and the dog is the news; in ''la hundo la katon ĉasis'', the dog is the topic of the conversation, and it is the action of chasing that is the news; and in ''ĉasis la hundo la katon'', the action of chasing is already the topic of discussion.

Context is required to tell whether
:''la hundo ĉasis la katon en la ĝardeno''
means the dog chased a cat which was in the garden, or there, in the garden, the dog chased the cat. These may be disambiguated with
:''la hundo ĉasis la katon, kiu estis en la ĝardeno''
::'The dog chased the cat, which was in the garden'
and
:''en la ĝardeno, la hundo ĉasis la katon''
::'In the garden, the dog chased the cat'.

Of course, if it chases the cat in''to'' the garden, the case of 'garden' would change:
:''la hundo ĉasis la katon en la ĝardeno'''n''''', ''en la ĝardeno'''n''' la hundo ĉasis la katon'', etc.

Within copulative clauses, however, there are restrictions. [[Copula (linguistics)|Copulas]] are words such as ''esti'' 'be', ''iĝi'' 'become', ''resti'' 'remain', and ''ŝajni'' 'seem', for which neither noun phrase takes the accusative case. In such cases only two orders are generally found: noun-copula-predicate and, much less commonly, predicate-copula-noun.&lt;ref name=wells&gt;John Wells, 1978, ''Lingvistikaj aspektoj de Esperanto'', p 42 ''ff''&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, if a characteristic of the noun is being described, the choice between the two orders is not important:
:''sovaĝa estas la vento'' 'wild is the wind', ''la vento estas sovaĝa'' 'the wind is wild'
However, ''la vento sovaĝa estas'' is unclear, at least in writing, as it could be interpreted as 'the wild wind is', leaving the reader to ask, 'is what?'.

===Attributive phrases and clauses===
In the sentence above, ''la hundo ĉasis la katon, kiu estis en la ĝardeno'' 'the dog chased the cat, which was in the garden', the [[relative pronoun]] ''kiu'' 'which' is restricted to a position ''after'' the noun 'cat'. In general, [[relative clause]]s and attributive prepositional phrases follow the noun they modify.

[[Attributive]] prepositional phrases, which are dependent on nouns, include genitives (''la libro de Johano'' 'John's book') as well as ''la kato en la ĝardeno'' 'the cat in the garden' in the example above. Their order cannot be reversed: neither ''*la de Johano libro'' nor ''*la en la ĝardeno kato'' is possible. This behavior is more restrictive than prepositional phrases which are dependent on verbs, and which can be moved around: both ''ĉasis en la ĝardeno'' and ''en la ĝardeno ĉasis'' are acceptable for 'chased in the garden'.

Relative clauses are similar, in that they are attributive and are subject to the same word-order constraint, except that rather than being linked by a preposition, the two elements are linked by a [[relative pronoun]] such as ''kiu'' 'which':
:''fuĝis la kato, kiun ĝi ĉasis'' 'the cat which it chased fled'
:''mi vidis la hundon, kiu ĉasis la katon'' 'I saw the dog which chased the cat'
Note that the noun and its adjacent relative pronoun do not agree in case. Rather, their cases depend on their relationships with their respective verbs.&lt;ref&gt;This is parallel to the rather archaic distinction in English between 'who' and 'whom'. Other sequences of case are possible, though with different readings: ''fuĝis la hundo, kiu ĉasis ĝin'' 'the dog which chased it fled'; ''mi vidis la katon, kiun la hundo ĉasis'' 'I saw the cat, which the dog chased'.&lt;/ref&gt; However, they do agree in number:
:''fuĝis la kato'''j''', kiu'''j'''n ĝi ĉasis'' 'the cat'''s''' which it chased fled'

Other word orders are possible, as long as the relative pronoun remains adjacent to the noun it depends on:
:''fuĝis la kato, kiun ĉasis ĝi'' 'the cat which it chased fled'
:''vidis mi la hundon, kiu la katon ĉasis'' 'I saw the dog which chased the cat'

===Clause order===
[[Coordinate conjunction|Coordinate clauses]] allow flexible word order, but tend to be [[iconicity|iconic]]. For example, in
:''la hundo ĉasis la katon kaj la kato fuĝis'' 'the dog chased the cat and the cat fled',
the inference is that the cat fled after the dog started to chase it, not that the dog chased a cat which was already fleeing. For the latter reading, the clause order would be reversed:
:''la kato fuĝis, kaj la hundo ĉasis ĝin'' 'the cat fled, and the dog chased it'
This distinction is lost in [[subordinate clause]]s such as the relative clauses in the previous section:
:''la hundo ĉasis la katon, kiu fuĝis'' 'the dog chased the cat(,) which fled'
In written English, a comma disambiguates the two readings, but both typically have a comma in Esperanto.

Non-relative subordinate clauses are similarly restricted. They follow the [[grammatical conjunction|conjunction]] ''ke'' 'that', as in,
:''Mi estas certa, ke vi havos brilan sukceson'' 'I am certain that you will have a brilliant success'.

==Non-Indo-European aspects==
Esperanto's vocabulary, [[syntax]], and [[semantics]] derive predominantly from Indo-European national languages. Roots are typically [[Romance languages|Romance]] or [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] in origin. The semantics shows a significant [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] influence.

It is often claimed that there are elements of the grammar which are not found in these language families. Frequently mentioned is Esperanto's [[Agglutination|agglutinative morphology]] based on invariant morphemes, and the subsequent lack of [[ablaut]] (internal inflection of its [[root word|roots]]), which Zamenhof himself thought would prove alien to non-Indo-European language speakers. Ablaut is an element of all the source languages; an English example is ''song sing sang sung.'' However, the majority of words in all Indo-European languages inflect without ablaut, as ''cat, cats'' and ''walk, walked'' do in English. (This is the so-called [[strong inflection|strong]]–[[weak inflection|weak]] dichotomy.) Historically, many Indo-European languages have expanded the range of their 'weak' inflections, and Esperanto has merely taken this development closer to its logical conclusion, with the only remaining ablaut being frozen in a few sets of semantically related roots such as ''pli'', ''plej'', ''plu'' (more, most, further), ''tre'', ''tro'' (very, too much), and in the verbal morphemes ''‑as'', ''‑anta'', ''‑ata''; ''‑is'', ''‑inta'', ''‑ita''; ''‑os'', ''‑onta'', ''‑ota''; and ''‑us''.

Other features often cited as being nonstandard for an Indo-European language, such as the dedicated suffixes for different parts of speech, or the ''-o'' suffix for singular nouns, actually do occur in Indo‑European languages such as Russian.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Russian neuter and feminine nouns end in singular ''-o'' and ''-a,'' adjectives in ''-oje'' and ''-aja,'' adverbs in ''-o'' and ''-e,'' etc.; ''cf.'' also Provençal ''la fenestro'' (the window), which is identical to Esperanto ''la fenestro''.&lt;/ref&gt; More pertinent is the accusative plural in ''-jn''. Esperanto is superficially similar to the non‑Indo‑European [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]] languages—that is, it is similar in its mechanics, but not in use. None of these proposed "non-European" elements of the original Esperanto proposal were actually taken from non-European or non-Indo-European languages, and any similarities with those languages are accidental.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

East Asian languages may have had some influence on the development of Esperanto grammar after its creation. The principally cited candidate is the replacement of predicate adjectives with verbs, such as ''la ĉielo bluas'' (the sky is blue) for ''la ĉielo estas blua'' and ''mia filino belu!'' (may my daughter be beautiful!) for the ''mia filino estu bela!'' mentioned above.

==Sample text==
The [[The Lord's Prayer|Pater noster]], from the [[Unua Libro|first Esperanto publication]] in 1887, illustrates many of the grammatical points presented above:

: ''Patro nia, kiu estas en la ĉieloj,
: ''sanktigata estu Via nomo.
: ''Venu Via regno,
: ''fariĝu Via volo,
: ''kiel en la ĉielo, tiel ankaŭ sur la tero.
: ''Nian panon ĉiutagan donu al ni hodiaŭ.
: ''Kaj pardonu al ni niajn ŝuldojn,
: ''kiel ankaŭ ni pardonas al niaj ŝuldantoj.
: ''Kaj ne konduku nin en tenton,
: ''sed liberigu nin de la malbono.
: ''(Ĉar Via estas la regno kaj la potenco
: ''kaj la gloro eterne.)
: ''Amen.''

The morphologically complex words (see [[Esperanto vocabulary#Word formation|Esperanto word formation]]) are:

'''Fijian''' (''{{lang|fj|Na Vosa Vakaviti}}'') is an [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] language of the [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesian family]] spoken by some 350,000–450,000 ethnic [[Fijians]] as a native language. The [[1997 Constitution of Fiji#New Constutution for 2013|2013 Constitution]] established Fijian as an official language of [[Fiji]], along with [[English language|English]] and [[Hindi]], and there is discussion about establishing it as the "[[national language]]", though English and Hindi would remain official. Fijian is a [[verb–object–subject|VOS]] language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wals.info/languoid/lect/wals_code_fij] WALS – Fijian&lt;/ref&gt;

Standard Fijian is based on the speech of [[Bau (island)#Language|Bau]], which is an [[East Fijian language]].

== Phonology ==
The [[consonant]] [[phoneme]]s of Fijian are as shown in the following table:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;"
! colspan="2" |

The consonant written {{angle bracket|dr}} has been described as a prenasalized trill {{IPA|[nr]}} or trilled fricative {{IPA|[ndr]}}. However, it is only rarely pronounced with a trilled release; the primary feature distinguishing it from {{angle bracket|d}} is that it is [[postalveolar]], {{IPA|[ɳɖ]}}, rather than dental/alveolar.&lt;ref&gt;{{SOWL}} p 122, 131. The authors use the transcription {{angle bracket|nḍ}}, where the sub-dot is their convention for a postalveolar stop that is not prototypically retroflex.&lt;/ref&gt;

The sounds {{IPA|[p]}} and {{IPA|[f]}} occur only in [[loanword]]s from other languages. The sounds {{IPA|[x]}} and {{IPA|[h]}} only occur for speakers from certain regions of the country.

Note the difference in [[place of articulation]] between the voiced-voiceless fricative pairs: [[Bilabial consonant|bilabial]] {{IPA|[β]}} vs. [[Labiodental consonant|labiodental]] {{IPA|[f]}}, and [[Dental consonant|dental]] {{IPA|[ð]}} vs. [[Alveolar consonant|alveolar]] {{IPA|[s]}}.

The [[vowel]] phonemes are:

In addition, there is the rising diphthong {{IPA|i̯u}}.

[[Syllable]]s can consist of a consonant followed by a vowel (CV) or a single vowel (V).&lt;ref&gt;Dixon 1988:15.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[stress (linguistics)|Word stress]] is based on [[mora (linguistics)|moras]]: a short vowel is one mora, diphthongs and long vowels are two morae. Primary stress is on the penultimate mora of the phonological word. That is, if the last syllable of a word is short, then the penultimate syllable will be stressed, while if the last syllable contains either a long vowel or a diphthong, then it receives primary stress. Stress is not lexical and can shift when suffixes are attached to the [[root (linguistics)|root]].
Examples:
*Stress on the penultimate syllable (final short vowel): ''síga'', "day";
*Stress on the final syllable (diphthong): ''cauravóu'', "youth" (the stress extends over the whole diphthong).
*Stress shift: ''cábe'', "kick" → ''cabé-ta'', "kick-TR"&lt;ref&gt;Dixon 1988:17&lt;/ref&gt;

== Orthography ==
The Fijian alphabet is based on the [[Latin script]] and consists of the following letters.
&lt;pre style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;
A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W Y
a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w y&lt;/pre&gt;

Among the consonants, there is almost a one-to-one correspondence between letters and phonemes:
{|
| valign=top width=200 |
* '''b''' = {{IPA|[ᵐb]}}
* '''c''' = {{IPA|[ð]}}
* '''d''' = {{IPA|[ⁿd]}} ('''di''' = {{IPA|[ⁿdʒi]}})
* '''f''' = {{IPA|[f]}}
* '''g''' = {{IPA|[ŋ]}}
* '''h''' = {{IPA|[h] ~ [x]}}
* '''j''' = {{IPA|[tʃ] ~ [ndʒ]}}
* '''k''' = {{IPA|[k]}}
* '''l''' = {{IPA|[l]}}
| valign=top width=200 |
* '''m''' = {{IPA|[m]}}
* '''n''' = {{IPA|[n]}} nr = {{IPA|[ᶯɖ]}}
* '''p''' = {{IPA|[p]}}
* '''q''' = {{IPA|[ᵑɡ]}}
* '''r''' = {{IPA|[r]}}
* '''s''' = {{IPA|[s]}}
* '''t''' = {{IPA|[t]}} ('''ti''' = {{IPA|[tʃi]}})
* '''v''' = {{IPA|[β]}}
* '''w''' = {{IPA|[ɰ]}}
* '''y''' = {{IPA|[j]}} or silent
|}
Note that for phonological reasons '''ti''' and '''di''' are pronounced {{IPA|[tʃi]}}, {{IPA|[ⁿdʒi]}} rather than {{IPA|[ti]}}, {{IPA|[ⁿdi]}} (cf. Japanese [[Chi (kana)|chi kana]]). Hence, the Fijian name for Fiji, '''Viti''', from an allophonic pronunciation of {{IPA|[βitʃi]}} as {{IPA|[ɸidʒi]}}.

In addition, the [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]] '''dr''' stands for [[postalveolar]] {{IPA|[ⁿd̠]}}, or a prenasalized trill {{IPA|[ⁿᵈ̠r̠]}} in careful pronunciation, or more commonly for some people and in some dialects.

The vowel letters '''a e i o u''' have roughly their IPA values, {{IPA|[a ɛ~e i ɔ~o u]}}.  The [[vowel length]] contrast is not usually indicated in writing, except in dictionaries and textbooks for learners of the language, where it is indicated by a [[Macron (diacritic)|macron]] over the vowel in question; Dixon, in the work cited below, doubles all long vowels in his spelling system. Diphthongs are ''ai au ei eu oi ou'' and ''iu,'' pronounced {{IPA|[ɛi̯ ɔu̯ ei̯ eu̯ oi̯ ou̯ i̯u]}}.

== Morphology ==
=== Pronouns and Person Markers ===
The pronominal system of Fijian is remarkably rich. Like many other languages, it recognises three [[grammatical person|persons]]; first person (speaker),
second person (addressee), and third person (all other). There is no distinction between human, non-human, animate, or inanimate.&lt;ref&gt;Dixon 1988: 52&lt;/ref&gt; 
Four numbers are represented; singular, [[Grammatical number#Dual|dual]], [[Grammatical number#Paucal|paucal]], and plural&amp;mdash;'paucal' refers to more than two people who have some relationship, as a family or work group; if none, 'plural' is used.  Like many other Oceanic languages, Fijian pronouns are marked for [[grammatical number|number]] and [[clusivity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://wals.info/feature/39A#3/-9.45/182.72|title = WALS Online – Feature 39A: Inclusive/Exclusive Distinction in Independent Pronouns|date = 2013|accessdate = May 4, 2015|website = The World Atlas of Language Structures Online|publisher = Leipzig: Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology.|last = Cysouw|first = Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Forms and Function ====
Each pronoun can have five forms, but some person-number
combinations may have the same form for more than one function&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;, as can be seen
in the table above.

The forms are:

'''Cardinal''' – used
when a pronoun occurs as the head of a NP. A cardinal pronoun is usually
preceded by the proper article '''o''&lt;nowiki/&gt;',
except when preceded by a preposition:
{| class="MsoTableGrid"
 |(1)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
|
''era''
  
  |
''sa''
  
  |
''la'o''
  
  |
'''''[o'''''
  
  |
'''''ira]'''''  
 
 |-
|
|
3PL
  
  |
ASP
  
  |
go
  
  |
'''ART'''
  
  |
'''3PL'''  
 
 |-
|
| colspan="5" |
"They are going"  
 
|}

{| class="MsoTableGrid"
 |(2)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
|
''au''
  
  |
''aa''
  
  |
''soli-a''
  
  |
''[a ''
  
  |
''niu]''
  
  |
'''''[vei'''''
  
  |
'''''ira]'''''  
 
 |-
|
|
1SG
  
  |
PAST
  
  |
give-TR
  
  |
ART
  
  |
coconut
  
  |
'''PREP'''
  
  |
'''3PL'''  
 
 |-
|
| colspan="7" |
"I gave [the coconut] [to them]  
 
|}

'''Subject''' – the
first constituent of a [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]], acts as person marking. Examples can be seen in examples (1) and (2) above: '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''era''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' and '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''au''&lt;nowiki/&gt;', and (3) below: '''o''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'

'''Object''' – follows
the ''-i''-final form of a transitive verb:

{| class="MsoTableGrid"
 
  |(3)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
|
''o''
  
  |
''aa''
  
  |
''biu-ti''
  
  |
'''''ira'''''  
 
 |-
|
|
2SG
  
  |
PAST
  
  |
leave-TR
  
  |
'''3PL'''  
 
 |-
|
| colspan="4" |
"You left them"  
 
|}

'''Possessive suffix'''
– attaches to [[Inalienable possession|inalienable]] nouns, and

'''Possessive''' –
precedes the NP head of the 'possessed' constituent in a possessive
construction.

(For more information on the form and function of these possessive
pronouns, see Possession.)

==== Use ====
The major clausal structure in Fijian minimally includes a
predicate, which usually has a verb at its head.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Dixon 1988: 33&lt;/ref&gt; The initial element
in the predicate is the subject form pronoun:

{| class="MsoTableGrid"
 
  |(4a)&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
|
''au''
  
  |
''la'o''  
 
 |-
|
|
1SG
  
  |
go  
 
 |-
|
| colspan="2" |
"I am going"  
|-
|
|
|
|-
|(4b)
|
''era''
  
  |
''la'o''  
 
 |-
|
|
3PL
  
  |
go  
 
 |-
|
| colspan="2" |
"They are going"  
 
|}

This 'subject marker + verb' predicate construction is
obligatory, every other constituent is optional. The subject may be expanded
upon by a NP following the predicate:

{| class="MsoTableGrid"
 
  |(5)&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
|
''era''
  
  |
''la'o''
  
  |
''[a''
  
  |
''gone]''  
 
 |-
|
|
3PL
  
  |
go
  
  |
ART
  
  |
child  
 
 |-
|
| colspan="4" |
"[the children] are going"

"They [the children] are going"  
 
|}
The subject pronoun constituent of a predicate acts mainly as a person marker.

Fijian is a [[verb–object–subject]] language, and the subject pronoun may be translated as its
equivalent in English, the subject NP of a clause in Fijian follows the verb
and the object if it is included.

The social use of pronouns is largely driven by respect and hierarchy. Each of the non-singular second person pronouns can be used for a singular addressee. For example, if one's actual or potential in-laws are addressed, the
2DU pronoun should be used. Similarly, when a brother or sister of
the opposite sex is addressed, the 2PA pronoun should be used, and it can also be used
for same-sex siblings when the speaker wishes to show respect. The 2PL pronoun
can be used to show respect to elders, particularly the village chief.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Dixon 1988: 53&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Possession ===
Possession is a grammatical term for a special relationship between two entities: a "possessor" and a "possessed". The relationship may be one of legal ownership, but in Fijian, like many other Austronesian languages, it is often much broader, encompassing kin relations, body parts, parts of an inanimate whole and personal qualities and concepts such as control, association and belonging.

Fijian has a complex system of possessive constructions, depending on the nature of the possessor and of the possessed. Choosing the appropriate structure depends on knowing&lt;ref&gt;Dixon 1988: 119&lt;/ref&gt; whether the possessor is described by a person or placename; a pronoun; or a common noun (with human or non-human animate, or inanimate reference) and also on whether the possessed is a free noun or a bound noun.

==== Possessor ====
Only an animate noun may be a possessor in the true possessive constructions shown below, with possession marked on the possessed NP in a number of ways. For personal and place name possessors, the possessive construction may be made by affixing the possessive suffix ''–i'' to the possessed noun, bound or free. If the possessor is a pronoun, the possessed noun must be marked by one of the pronominal markers which specify person, number and inclusivity/exclusivity (see table). If the possessor is inanimate, the possessive particle ''ni'' is usually placed between the possessed NP and the possessor NP. The particle ''ni'' then indicates association, rather than formal possession, but the construction is still regarded as a possessive construction.

==== Possessed ====
Free nouns can stand alone and need no affix; most nouns in Fijian fall into this class. Bound nouns require a suffix to complete them and are written ending in a hyphen to indicate this requirement. ''Tama-'' (father) and ''tina-'' (mother) are examples of bound nouns. The classes of free and bound nouns roughly correspond with the concept, common in Austronesian languages, of alienable and inalienable possession, respectively. Alienable possession denotes a relationship in which the thing possessed is not culturally considered an inherent part of the possessor, and inalienable possession indicates a relationship in which the possessed is regarded as an intrinsic part of the possessor.

Body parts and kin relations are typical examples of inalienable possession. Inanimate objects are typical examples of alienable possession.

The alienable nature of free nouns is further marked by prefixes, known as classifiers, indicating certain other characteristics. Some common examples are ''me-'' when the possessed noun is something drinkable, ''ke-'' (or ''‘e'') when the noun is something edible and ''we-'' when the referent of the possessed noun is personal property.

==== Possessive Constructions&lt;ref&gt;Dixon 1988: 120&lt;/ref&gt; ====
The word order of a possessive construction for all except inanimate possessors is possessed NP-classifier(CLF) + possessive marker (POSS) + possessor NP.

For an inanimate possessor, the word order is possessed NP + ''ni'' + possessor NP.

{| class="wikitable"
|-

Note that there is some degree of flexibility in the use of possessive constructions as described in this table.

== Syntax ==
The normal Fijian word order is [[Verb–object–subject|VOS]] ([[verb–object–subject]]):
*E rai-c-a (1) na no-na (2) vale (3) na gone (4).
*&lt;small&gt;3-sg.-sub.&lt;/small&gt; see-&lt;small&gt;trans.&lt;/small&gt;-&lt;small&gt;3-sg.-obj.&lt;/small&gt; (1) the &lt;small&gt;3-sg.-poss.&lt;/small&gt; (2) house (3) the child (4).
*(The child sees his house.)

== National language debate ==
{{main|National language debate in Fiji}}

In May and June 2005, a number of prominent Fiji Islanders called for the status of Fijian to be upgraded. It was not an official language before the adoption of the [[1997 Constitution of Fiji|1997 Constitution]], which made it co-official with [[English language|English]] and [[Fiji Hindi]]. It is still not a compulsory subject in schools, however; the present{{when?|date=August 2017}} Education Minister, [[Teimumu Kepa|Ro Teimumu Kepa]], has endorsed calls for it to be made so, as has [[Great Council of Chiefs]] [[Chairman of the Great Council of Chiefs|Chairman]] [[Ovini Bokini|Ratu Ovini Bokini]]. Similar calls came from [[Misiwini Qereqeretabua]], the Director of the [[Institute of Fijian Language and Culture]], and from [[Apolonia Tamata]], a [[linguistics]] [[lecturer]] at [[Suva]]'s [[University of the South Pacific]], who both said that recognition of the Fijian language is essential to the nation's basic identity and as a unifying factor in Fiji's multicultural society.

[[Fiji Labour Party]] leader [[Mahendra Chaudhry]] also endorsed the call for Fijian to be made a national language and a compulsory school subject if the same status be given to [[Fiji Hindi]], a position echoed by [[Krishna Vilas]] of the [[National Reconciliation Committee]].

'''Gbanu''' (''Gbànù'', Banu, Gbanou) is a [[Gbaya languages|Gbaya language]] of the [[Central African Republic]]. The people do not consider themselves to be ethnically [[Gbaya people|Gbaya]].

==Phonology==
Gbanu has 14 vowels, oral {{IPA|/i e ɛ a ɔ o u/}} and nasal {{IPA|/ĩ ẽ ɛ̃ ã ɔ̃ õ ũ/}}. Syllables may be maximally CVN, where N is {{IPA|/m/}} or {{IPA|/n/}}. There are four tones on CV syllables, high, low, rising, and falling. Words have six tone patterns, those four plus dipping (falling–rising) and peaking (rising–falling). 

{|class="wikitable IPA"

|-
| ||nz|| || || || 
|-
| ||l|| || || || 
|}

Intervocallically, the only voicing distinction that is maintained is {{IPA|/s, z/}}; otherwise only voiceless oral stops and fricatives occur between vowels. 
Nasal consonants lightly nasalize surrounding vowels, and nasal vowels, including those triggered by nasal consonants, nasalize the glottalized consonants. The approximants {{IPA|/j w/}} do not occur with nasal vowels, and so may not be phonemic; {{IPA|/j~ɲ/, /w~mŋ/}} may be posited as the underlying phonemes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3020">The '''guiltive''' is a term introduced by [[John Haiman (linguist)|John Haiman]] for the [[speaker attitude]]{{sfn|Bybee|Fleischman|1995|p=9}} whereby the speaker overtly presents him- or herself as generous or indifferent but actually means the opposite of what he or she is saying, with the intention of making the addressee feel [[Guilt (emotion)|guilty]].{{sfn|Haspelmath|1998|p=128|ps = : "[The guiltive is] a covert inference that the statement is insincere, which is supposed to make the listener feel guilty."}}

The guiltive is similar to [[sarcasm]]: in both, the speaker's ostensible message is accompanied by a derived metamessage "This message is bogus." In sarcasm this is overtly marked by the speaker (for example, using [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]] or caricatured formality), whereas in the guiltive it is instead "left to be supplied by the addressee, who is thereby made to feel like a worm."{{Sfn|Haiman|1995|p=335}} The fact that the speaker still sounds sincere (albeit known not to be) suggests an affinity with polite language. But unlike [[politeness]], the purpose of which is to avoid aggression, the guiltive is a form of [[passive-aggressiveness]] intended to make the listener feel bad. {{Sfn|Haiman|1995|p=336}}

The name "guiltive" is formed with the ''-ive'' suffix, which is commonly used for the names of [[grammatical mood]]s. But as with sarcasm, no language has been found to have [[Grammaticalization|grammaticalized]] it.

'''Huishui Miao''', a.k.a. '''Huishui Hmong''', is a [[Miao languages|Miao language]] of China. It is named after [[Huishui County]], Guizhou, though not all varieties are spoken there. The endonym is ''Mhong'', though it shares this with [[Gejia language|Gejia]] and it is simply a variant spelling of [[Hmong language|Hmong]]. [[Raojia language|Raojia]] is closely related.

Huishui was given as a subgroup of [[Western Hmongic]] in Strecker (1987). Matisoff (2001) split it into four separate languages, and, conservatively, did not retain it as a group.

'''Jamal Nebez''' ({{lang-ckb|جەمال نەبەز}}, {{lang-kmr|Cemal Nebez}}) (born 1933) is a [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] [[linguist]], mathematician and writer.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bakhawan.com/dotkurd/nebez/Inglizi/TheKurds.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; He studied Islamic law, philosophy, theology, physics and mathematics at the [[University of Baghdad]] in the 1950s. In 1956, he prepared a stenciled script on [[algebra]] and in 1960, succeeded in publishing the first physics book in [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]], including a rich glossary of Kurdish terms pertaining to [[physics]] and mathematics. He has translated several literary works, including works of [[Nikolai Gogol]] and [[William Shakespeare]] into Kurdish. He has also written and published several books on a variety of topics. Most of the books are mainly about topics related to Kurds.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kurdishacademy.org/?q=node/136&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Parallel to attending the state schools, he had the opportunity to study Islamic law, philosophy and theology. He studied [[physics]] and mathematics at the science faculty at the Teachers' Training Faculty at the [[University of Baghdad]] in the first half of the 1950s. From October 1955 to 1961, Nebez was a secondary school teacher of physics and math. For three years, he taught in [[Iraqi Kurdistan]]; first in [[Kirkuk]] and then in [[Arbil]]. Then he taught for three years in [[Basrah]] and [[Baghdad]]. In the summer of 1956, Nebez travelled to [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]], where he met many Kurdish intellectuals, poets and writers who worked and published in Kurdish. In the summer of 1957, he travelled to [[Iranian Kurdistan]] and [[Tehran]]. Just like in Lebanon, he also met many intellectuals in Iranian Kurdistan. He met the famous Kurdish cleric and writer, Ayatollah Mohammed Mardokh-i Kurdistani (1885–1975) whom he agreed with to serve the Kurdish language and culture.

In 1962, he left for Europe to pursue his studies in [[pedagogy]], Iranology, and Islamic studies. He attended the Universities of [[Munich]], Würzburg and the University of [[Hamburg]]. He also studied [[political science]], journalism and law at the Free University of [[Berlin]]. In 1965, while a student in [[Munich]], he jointly founded the National Union of the Kurdish Students in Europe (NUKSE) with his partisan friends Brusk Ibrahim and Latif Ali. In 1985, he and other emigrants from [[Kurdistan]], mostly academics, scientists, literates and artists founded the Kurdish Academy of Science and Arts, which was based in [[Stockholm]].

In the 1970s and at the beginning of the 1980s Jemal held several positions. From 1971–72 he worked as a lecturer at the Free University of Berlin at the Ethnological Institute. From 1971–78 he was also a lecturer at the Institute for Iranian Philology. 1972–76 Scientific Employee in the field of Orientalistics at Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation)
From 1978–82 he worked as an assistant Professor, in the topics of Islamic Iran, Persian and other Iranian languages, also at the Free University of Berlin. And from 1978 to 1983 as an examiner of Persian language translators and interpreters in Berlin (Staatliches Institut für Dolmetscher und Übersetzer) and examiner of Kurdish language translators and interpreters in Munich (Bavarian Ministry of Education, Science and Culture).

==Works==
Nebez wrote many essays in [[Arab]] newspapers in [[Baghdad]] about the political, social and human rights of the [[Kurds]]. One of these publications, in spring 1954, was a critical article published in "Sawt al-Ahali"(voice of the population) on a press-interview given by [[Celal Bayar]], then expresident of Turkey, during a sojourn in the United States, in which Bayar denied the existence of any other people but [[Turkish people|Turks]] in Turkey. During the two years he had taught in [[Kirkuk]], he created the basis for the first physics and mathematics books in the [[Kurdish language]]. In 1956, he prepared a stencilized script on [[Algebra]] and in 1960, succeeded in publishing the first physics book in Kurdish under the title, "Introduction into the Mechanics and Properties of Matter", including a rich glossary of Kurdish terms pertaining to physics and mathematics. In the course of his sojourn in [[Damascus]], he managed to write a booklet in Arabic on "The Kurdish Freedom Movement and its Aims" in 1957. He published another book in the same year, titled "Kurdish in Latin Script", in [[Baghdad]]. He has published many books on Kurdish language and he also translated some literary works, including works of [[Gogol]] and [[Shakespeare]] into Kurdish.

'''Khwarazmian''' (Khwarezmian, Khorezmian, Chorasmian) is an extinct [[Eastern Iranian languages|East Iranian]] language&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia Iranica'', "The Chorasmian Language", D.N.Mackenzie.  Online access at June, 2011: [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/chorasmia-iii]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew Dalby]], ''Dictionary of Languages: the definitive reference to more than 400 languages'', Columbia University Press, 2004, pg 278.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MacKenzie, D. N. "Khwarazmian Language and Literature," in E. Yarshater ed. ''Cambridge History of Iran'', Vol. III, Part 2, Cambridge 1983, pp. 1244–1249.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/293577/Iranian-languages ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', "Iranian languages"] (Retrieved on 29 December 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; closely related to [[Sogdian language|Sogdian]]. The language was spoken in the area of [[Khwarezm]] (Chorasmia), centered in the lower [[Amu Darya]] south of the [[Aral Sea]] (the northern part of the modern Republic of [[Uzbekistan]], and the adjacent areas of [[Turkmenistan]] and [[Kazakhstan]]).

Knowledge of Khwarazmian is limited to its Middle Iranian stage and, as with Sogdian, little is known of its ancient form.

From the writings of the great Khwarazmian scholars, [[Al-Biruni]] and [[Zamakhshari]], we know that the language was in use at least until the 13th century, when it was gradually replaced by [[Persian language|Persian]] for the most part, as well as several dialects of Turkic.&lt;ref name="Iranica"&gt;[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/chorasmia-iii CHORASMIA iii. The Chorasmian Language]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other than the [[astronomy|astronomical]] terms used by Al-Biruni, our other sources of Khwarazmian include [[Zamakhshari]]'s [[Arabic language|Arabic]]–[[Persian language|Persian]]–Khwarazmian dictionary and several legal texts that use Khwarazmian terms to explain certain legal concepts.&lt;ref name="Iranica" /&gt;

The noted scholar [[W.B. Henning]] was preparing a dictionary of Khwarazmian when he died, leaving it unfinished.{{cn|date=January 2016}}

==Writing system==
Before the advance of [[Islam]] in [[Transoxiana]] (early 8th century), Khwarazmian was written in a script close to that of Sogdian and [[Pahlavi script|Pahlavi]] with its roots in the imperial [[Aramaic script]]. From the few surviving examples of this script on coins and artifacts it has been observed that written Khwarazmian included Aramaic [[logograms]] or [[ideograms]], that is Aramaic words written to represent native spoken ones.

After the advance of Islam, Khwarazmian was written using an adapted version of the [[Persian alphabet|Perso-Arabic alphabet]] with a few extra signs to reflect specific Khwarazmian sounds, such as the letter &lt;span style="font-size:125%;"&gt;'''څ'''&lt;/span&gt;, which represents /ts/ and /dz/, as in the traditional [[Pashto language|Pashto]] orthography.&lt;ref&gt;THE KHWAREZMIAN GLOSSARY—I, D. N. MacKenzie [http://www.azargoshnasp.net/languages/Khwarazmi/khwarezmiangl1.pdf Link]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''languages of [[Djibouti]]''' include [[Afar language|Afar]], [[Arabic]], [[Somali language|Somali]] and [[French language|French]]. Somali and Afar are the most widely spoken tongues, and Arabic and French serve as the official languages.

==Languages==
Djibouti is a [[multilingual]] country. According to ''[[Ethnologue]]'', the majority of the population speaks [[Somali language|Somali]] (524,000 speakers) or [[Afar language|Afar]] (306,000 speakers) as a first language, which are the [[mother tongue]]s of the Somali and Afar ethnic groups, respectively. Both languages belong to the larger [[Afroasiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] family.&lt;ref name="Ethndji"&gt;{{cite web|title=Djibouti|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/country/DJ/languages|publisher=Ethnologue|accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three official languages in Djibouti: [[Somali language|Somali]], [[Arabic]] and [[French language|French]]. Arabic is of religious importance. In formal settings, it consists of [[Modern Standard Arabic]]. Colloquially, about 59,000 local residents speak the [[Ta'izzi-Adeni Arabic]] dialect, also known as ''Djibouti Arabic''. French was inherited from the colonial period and is the primary language of instruction. About 17,000 Djiboutians speak it as a first language.&lt;ref name="Ethndji"/&gt;

Immigrant languages include [[Omani Arabic]] (38,900 speakers), [[Amharic]] (1,400 speakers), [[Greek language|Greek]] (1,000 speakers) and [[Hindi language|Hindi]] (600 speakers).&lt;ref name="Ethndji"/&gt;

Additionally, the Somali [[deaf community]] in Djibouti uses the [[Somali Sign Language]].&lt;ref name="Tbagossl"&gt;{{cite web|last=Woodford|first=Doreen E.|title=The beginning and growth of a new language - Somali Sign Language|url=http://www.eenet.org.uk/resources/docs/somali_sign_language.php|publisher=Enabling Education Network|accessdate=30 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Somali language is regulated by the [[Regional Somali Language Academy]], an intergovernmental institution established in June 2013 in [[Djibouti (city)|Djibouti City]] by the governments of Djibouti, [[Somalia]] and [[Ethiopia]]. It is officially mandated with preserving the Somali language.&lt;ref name="Crslalid"&gt;{{cite web|title=Regional Somali Language Academy Launched in Djibouti|url=http://www.comesaria.org/site/en/news_details.php?chaine=regional-somali-language-academy-launched-in-djibouti&amp;id_news=17578&amp;id_article=119|publisher=COMESA Regional Investment Agency|accessdate=28 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing system==
Nationally, the [[Latin script]] is the most widely used orthography for all languages. The [[Somali alphabet]], a modified form of the script, is used to write Somali.&lt;ref name="Osws"&gt;{{cite web|title=Omniglot - Somali writing scripts|url=http://www.omniglot.com/writing/somali.htm|publisher=Omniglot|accessdate=8 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1970s, two Afar intellectuals and nationalists, Dimis and Redo, formalized a similar Afar alphabet. Known as ''Qafar Feera'', the orthography is also based on the Latin script.&lt;ref name="Omafr"&gt;{{cite web|title=Afar (ʿAfár af)|url=http://www.omniglot.com/writing/afar.htm|publisher=Omniglot|accessdate=23 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Somali and Afar are transcribed using the [[Arabic script]].&lt;ref name="Osws"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Afdal"&gt;{{cite web|title=Development of the Afar Language |url=http://www.afarfriends.org/Dok%20t%20websida/aktivitet_i_Sv/STANDARDIZATION%20OF%20COMMON%20AFAR%20SCRIPT1.pdf |publisher=Afar Friends |accessdate=23 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305143610/http://www.afarfriends.org/Dok%20t%20websida/aktivitet_i_Sv/STANDARDIZATION%20OF%20COMMON%20AFAR%20SCRIPT1.pdf |archivedate= 5 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Latinism''' (rarely also known as a '''Latinity''') is a word, [[idiom]], or structure in a language other than [[Latin]] that is derived from, or suggestive of, the Latin language.  The process of creating and imposing Latinisms is '''Latinization''' (or '''Latinisation'''), and historically was frequently [[Latinisation of names|applied to proper names]] as well as words.

There are [[Latin influence in English|many Latinistic terms]] in [[English language|English]] and other (especially [[Western culture|Western]]) languages. '''Latinism''' can also refer to a [[Loan word|word borrowed into another language]] directly from [[Latin]], especially [[Inkhorn term|one deemed pretentious]]; [[List of Latin expressions|English has many of these]], as well.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1916">In mathematics, '''Mahler's 3/2 problem''' concerns the existence of "{{math|''Z''}}-numbers".

A '''{{math|''Z''}}-number''' is a real number {{math|''x''}} such that the  [[fractional part]]s

:&lt;math&gt;\left\lbrace x \left(\frac 3 2\right)^ n \right\rbrace &lt;/math&gt;

are less than {{math|1/2}} for all positive integers {{math|''n''}}.  [[Kurt Mahler]] conjectured in 1968 that there are no {{math|''Z''}}-numbers.

More generally, for a real number {{math|''α''}}, define {{math|Ω(''α'')}} as

:&lt;math&gt;\Omega(\alpha) = \inf_\theta\left({ \limsup_{n \rightarrow \infty} \left\lbrace{\theta\alpha^n}\right\rbrace - \liminf_{n \rightarrow \infty} \left\lbrace{\theta\alpha^n}\right\rbrace }\right). &lt;/math&gt;

Mahler's conjecture would thus imply that {{math|Ω(3/2)}} exceeds {{math|1/2}}.  Flatto, [[Jeffrey C. Lagarias|Lagarias]], and Pollington showed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1=Leopold | last1=Flatto | first2=Jeffrey C. | last2=Lagarias | author2-link=Jeffrey C.

The '''Nimbari language''', which is no longer spoken, was a member of the [[Leko–Nimbari languages|Leko–Nimbari]] group of [[Savanna languages]]. It was spoken in northern [[Cameroon]].

Nimbari was labeled "G12" in [[Joseph Greenberg]]'s [[Adamawa languages|Adamawa]] language-family proposal.

'''Omani Arabic''' (also known as '''Omani Hadari Arabic''') is a [[Varieties of Arabic|variety]] of [[Arabic]] spoken in the [[Al Hajar Mountains]] of [[Oman]] and in a few neighboring coastal regions. It is the easternmost Arabic dialect. It was formerly spoken by colonists in [[Kenya]] and [[Tanzania]], but most or all of them have shifted to [[Swahili language|Swahili]]. There are several distinct dialects of Omani Arabic, such as [[Dhofari Arabic]] and [[Shihhi Arabic]].

'''Oropom''' (Oworopom, Oyoropom, Oropoi) is an [[African language]], possibly [[spurious language|spurious]] and, if real, almost certainly [[extinct language|extinct]]. The language was purportedly once spoken by the [[Oropom people]] in northeastern [[Uganda]] and northwestern [[Kenya]] between the [[Turkwel River]], the [[Chemorongit Mountains]], and [[Mount Elgon]]. There is only one article containing any original research on the language, Wilson 1970, which only a handful of other articles discuss. Wilson's article furnishes only a short word list, and was written at a time when the language, if it existed, was nearly extinct. The article was based mainly on the limited memories of two very old women, one "a child of one of the residual Oropom families that had remained after the break-up of the Oropom here ([[Matheniko]] county)" who "remembered a few words of the language", the other an old lady called Akol "descended from the prisoners taken by the [[Karimojong]] on the [[Turkwel]]" who was "able to furnish many Oropom words". Under the circumstances, only the barest details of Oropom could be ascertained.

On this basis, Wilson concluded that it must have had at least two dialects: one spoken around the [[Turkwel]] area, containing a significant number of [[Luo language|Luo]] words, and some [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] words, and one spoken around [[Matheniko]] county with fewer Luo words. Both contain [[Kalenjin language|Kalenjin]] [[loanword]]s.

Wilson ascribed it to the [[Khoisan languages|Khoisan]] group, seemingly based solely on its physical appearance; but this identification is unreliable; [[Harold Fleming (scholar)|Harold Fleming]] describes it as a "ridiculous suggestion". Elderkin 1983 says that "The Oropom data of Wilson (1970) shows some resemblances to [[Kuliak languages|Kuliak]], some of which could well be mediated through [[Nilotic languages|Nilotic]], with which it seems to have more resemblances (F. Rottland, personal communication)... There are many fewer resemblances worth noting with [[Hadza language|Hadza]] and only a minimal number with [[Sandawe language|Sandawe]]." He quotes 8 potentially similar words between Oropom and Hadza, and 4 between Oropom and Sandawe. Harold Fleming also notes that "initial inspection suggests some possible commonality" between Oropom and the [[Kuliak languages]], a probably [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]] relic group found in Northern Uganda among such tribes as the [[Ik people|Ik]]. However, in the absence of further work, Oropom remains an [[unclassified language]].

[[Bernd Heine]], who surveyed the area less than ten years after Wilson and found no trace of the language, expressed skepticism that it existed at all.&lt;ref name="Souag 2004"&gt;2004, Mostafa Lameen Souag, ''[https://www.academia.edu/1970833/Oropom_Etymological_Lexicon_Exploring_an_extinct_unclassified_Ugandan_language Oropom Etymological Lexicon: Exploring an extinct, unclassified Ugandan language]''&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[w:Lionel Bender (linguist)|Lionel Bender]] and [[w:Roger Blench|Roger Blench]] have opined that the language was made up as a joke.&lt;ref name="Souag 2004" /&gt; Souag 2004 lists several motives Wilson's informants might have had to fabricate the language, and observes that even in his article, Wilson notes that he had to deal with "charlatans" once word got out that he was looking for anyone with knowledge of the language.

==Wordlist==

This wordlist, taken from the appendix to Wilson 1970, is based on Akol's memories (and thus is considered by Wilson as belonging to the "Turkwell dialect").  He says that he collected words from the other dialect as well, but apparently never published them.  The list consists of less than a hundred words, which are likely to be all the vocabulary that will ever be known of the language.

The '''Pauna language''', ''Paunaka'', is an almost unknown [[Arawakan languages|Arawakan language]] in South America. It is an extremely endangered language, which belongs to the southern branch of the Arawakan language family and it is spoken in the Bolivian area of the [[Chiquitanía]], near [[Santa Cruz Department (Bolivia)|Santa Cruz]] and north of the [[Gran Chaco|Chaco region]]. The suffix -ka is a plural morpheme of the Chiquitano language, but has been assimilated into Pauna.

There could be a relationship to the extinct Paiconeca language, which is also part of the Arawakan family. Aikhenvald (1999) lists Paiconeca as a separate language, but Kaufman (1994) subsumed it as a dialect of Pauna.

The Spanish colonisation changed a whole continent. [[Indigenous peoples|Indigenous]] languages were displaced and replaced and younger generations did not keep in touch with their linguistic roots anymore.  Spanish and [[Chiquitano language|Chiquitano]] became the main languages in this Bolivian area, and especially Spanish is the medium of teaching in schools. Due to this fact children are focusing on Spanish instead of their original languages. 
Currently there remain approximately ten speakers and semi-speakers, who live in the eastern part of Bolivia among the Chiquitano people. However, 150 people feel to be part of the ethnic group, of which some can still understand Paunaka.   The Paunaka language and culture is currently under investigation.

'''Round-trip translation''' (RTT), also known as back-and-forth translation, recursive translation and bi-directional translation, is the process of [[translation|translating]] a word, phrase or text into another language (forward translation), then translating the result back into the original language ([[back translation]]), using [[machine translation]] (MT) software. It is often used by laypeople to [[Evaluation of machine translation|evaluate a machine translation]] system,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;van Zaanen, Menno &amp; Zwarts, Simon (2006). "Unsupervised measurement of translation quality using multi-engine, bidirectional translation". AI 2006. Springer-Verlag: 1208-1214&lt;/ref&gt; or to test whether a text is suitable for MT&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Gaspari, Federico (2006). "Look who's translating. Impersonation, Chinese whispers and fun with machine translation on the Internet. EAMT-2006: 149-158 via Mt- Archive.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Shigenobu, Tomohiro (2007). "Evaluation and Usability of Back Translation for Intercultural Communication". In Aykin N. ''Usability and Internationalization, Part II. Berlin'': Springer-Verlag. 259-265- via Web of Science&lt;/ref&gt; when they are unfamiliar with the target language. Because the resulting text can often differ substantially from the original, RTT can also be a source of entertainment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Software quality ==

To compare the quality of different machine translation systems, users perform RTT and compare the resulting text to the original. The theory is that the closer the result of the RTT is to the original text, the higher the quality of the machine translation system. One of the problems with this technique is that if there is a problem with the resulting text it is impossible to know whether the error occurred in the forward translation, in the back translation, or in both. In addition it is possible to get a good back translation from a bad forward translation.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Somers|first=Harold|year=2005|title=Round-trip translation: What is it good for?|url=|journal=Proceedings of the Australasian Language Technology Workshop ALTW 2005|volume=|pages=127–133|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study using the automatic evaluation methods [[BLEU]] and [[F-score]] compared five different free on-line [[Machine translation|translation programs]] evaluating the quality of both the forward translation and the back translation and found no [[Correlation and dependence|correlation]] between the quality of the forward translation and the quality of the back translation (i.e., a high quality forward translation did not always correspond to a high quality back translation). The author concluded that RTT was a poor method of predicting the quality of machine translation software.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This conclusion was reinforced by a more in-depth study also using automatic evaluation methods.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A subsequent study which included human evaluation of the back translation in addition to automatic evaluation methods found that RTT might have some ability to predict the quality of a machine translation system&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://translationjournal.net/journal/51reverse.htm|title=The Efficacy of Round-trip Translation for MT Evaluation|website=translationjournal.net|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; not on a [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]] by sentence basis but for larger texts.

== Suitability of text for machine translation ==
It is also suggested that RTT can be used to determine whether a text is suitable for machine translation. The idea being that if RTT results in a text that is close to the original, the text is suitable for MT. If after using RTT, the resulting text is inaccurate, the source text can then be edited until a satisfactory result is achieved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.baselinemag.com/c/a/Projects-Processes/Gotcha-Translation-Software|title=Gotcha!: Translation Software|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the studies looking at RTT as a means of measuring MT system quality also looked at its ability to predict whether a text was suitable for machine translation.  It found that using different types of text also did not result in any [[Correlation and dependence|correlation]] between the quality of the forward translation and the quality of the back translation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In contrast another study using human evaluation found that there was a correlation between the quality of the forward translation and the back translation and that this correlation could be used to estimate the quality of the forward translation. This correlation could be used to estimate the quality of the forward translation and by simplifying the source text, improve the quality of the forward translation.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Entertainment ==

'''Russophiles of Galicia''' or '''Moscophiles''' ({{lang-uk|Pусофіли, москвофіли|Rusofily}}) were participants in a cultural and political movement largely in the [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria]], [[Austria-Hungary]] (currently western [[Ukraine]]). This ideology emphasized that since the [[East Slavs|Eastern Slavic]] people of [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] were descendants of the people of [[Kievan Rus']] ([[Ruthenians]]), and followers of [[Eastern Christianity]], that they were thus a branch of the Russian people. The movement was part of the whole [[Pan-Slavism]] that was developing in the late 19th century. Russophilia was largely a reaction against Polish (in Galicia) and Hungarian (in [[Carpathian Ruthenia]]) cultural suppression that was largely associated with Roman Catholicism.

Russophilia has survived longer among the [[Rusyns|Rusyn minority]], especially those in [[Carpathian Ruthenia]], the [[Lemkos]] of south-east Poland,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Horbal |first1= Bogdan|authorlink1= Bogdan Horbal |editor1-first= Richard D.|editor1-last= Custer|editor1-link= |title= Rusyn-American Almanac of the Carpatho-Rusyn Society 10th Anniversary 2004–2005 |url=   |accessdate= |type= |edition= |series= |volume= |date= |year= 2005 |publisher= |location= [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]|isbn= |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages= 81–91|chapter= The Rusyn Movement among the Galician Lemkos|chapterurl= http://www.lemko.org/scholar/horbal/94.pdf |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and those in [[Bukovina]].

==Terminology==
The "Russophiles" did not always apply the term to themselves, and called themselves Russians, Rusians, Ruthenians or ''[[Rusyns|Rusyny]]'' (Rusyns). Some Russophiles coined such terms as ''Obshche-rossy'' (Common Russians) or ''Starorusyny'' (Old Ruthenians) to stress either the differences within their faction, referring to commonness with all Russians, or their unique stand within the whole of the Russian nation.{{Clarify|reason=incorrect|date=October 2015}}

The ethnonym ''Ruthenians'' for Ukrainian people had been accepted by both the Russophiles and the Moscophiles for quite a long period of time.{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=October 2015}} The new name ''Ukrainians'' began to be accepted by the Ruthenian Galicians (as opposed to Polonian Galicians) around the 1890s, under the influence of [[Mykola Kostomarov]] and the [[Brotherhood of Saints Cyril and Methodius]] in central Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;Magocsi 1996, p 440.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
After the fall of the westernmost [[Ruthenians|East Slavic]] [[Halych-Volhynia|state]] in 1349, most of the area of what is now Western Ukraine came under the control of [[Poland]] and [[Hungary]], with Poland ruling [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] and Hungary controlling [[Carpathian Ruthenia]]. The loss of independence began a period of gradual, centuries-long assimilation of much of the native elite into Polish and Hungarian culture. These elite adopted a national orientation in which they saw the native Rus population of Galicia as a branch of the [[Poles|Polish]] nation who happened to be of the Eastern Christian faith. They believed that the native language was merely a dialect of Polish, comparable to [[Masurian language|Mazovian]], and that assimilation would be inevitable.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

This process of [[Polonisation]] was, however, resented by the peasants, the clergy, and small minority of nobles who retained their [[East Slavs|East Slavic]] culture, religion or both. The latter two groups would form the nucleus of native national movements that would emerge with the loosening of Polish and Hungarian control in western Ukraine, which occurred when the entire region came under the control of the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austrian Habsburgs]] in the course of the [[Partitions of Poland]]. The [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Austrian Emperor]] emancipated the [[serf]]s, introduced compulsory education, and raised the status of the Ruthenian priests to that of their Polish and Hungarian counterparts. Furthermore, they mandated that Ukrainian Catholic seminarians receive a formal higher education (previously, priests had been educated informally by their fathers), and organized institutions in [[Vienna]] and [[Lviv]] that would serve this function.  This led to the appearance, for the first time, of a large educated social class within the Ukrainian population in Galicia.&lt;ref&gt;Himka, John Paul.  (1999). ''Religion and Nationality in Western Ukraine.'' McGill-Queen's University Press: Montreal and Kingston.  Pg. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Austrian reforms led to a gradual [[Mass mobilization|social mobilization]] of the native inhabitants of Western Ukraine and the emergence of several national ideologies that reflected the natives' East Slavic culture and were opposed to that of Roman Catholic Poland and Hungary. This development was encouraged by the Austrian authorities because it served to undermine Polish or Hungarian control of the area. The cultural movements included: [[Russophilia]], the idea that Galicia was the westernmost part of Russia and that the natives of Western Ukraine were, like all of the Russian Empire's East Slavic inhabitants, members of one Russian nation; Ruthenianism, the idea that the people of Western Ukraine were a unique East Slavic nation; and [[Ukrainophilia]], the idea that the people of western Ukraine were the same as those of neighbouring lands in the Russian Empire but that both were a people different from Russians — [[Ukrainians]].

Initially there existed a fluidity between all three national orientations, with people changing their allegiance throughout their lives, and until approximately the turn of the 20th century members of all three groups frequently identified themselves by the ethnonym [[Ruthenians]] (''Rusyny''). Initially the most prominent ideology was Ruthenianism, or ''Rutenstvo''. Its proponents, referred to as "Old Ruthenians", were mainly wealthier or more influential priests and the remnants of the nobility who had not been Polonised, and were quite loyal to the Habsburgs to whom they owed their higher social standing. While emphasizing their separateness from the Poles in terms of religion and background, these people nevertheless maintained an elitist attitude towards the peasantry. They frequently spoke the Polish language among themselves, and tried to promote a version of [[Church Slavonic language|Church Slavonic]] with elements of the local Ukrainian [[vernacular]] as well as the [[Russian language]] as a literary language for western Ukraine  This language was never standardized, however. The language actually spoken by the common people was viewed with contempt. Old Ruthenians rejected both [[Ukrainophilia|Ukrainophilism]] and Russophilism.  The Ukrainian thinker [[Mykhailo Drahomanov]] wrote  ironically of them, that "you Galician intellectuals really do think of creating some kind of Uniate Paraguay, with some kind of hierarchical bureaucratic aristocracy, just like you have created an Austro-Ruthenian literary language!" &lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Robert Magocsi]]. (2002).  ''The Roots of Ukrainian Nationalism: Galicia as Ukraine's Piedmont.'' Toronto: University of Toronto Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Old Ruthenianism dominated Galicia's cultural scene until the mid-19th century, when it was supplanted by Russophilia (many of the proponents of old Ruthenianism eventually became Russophiles).

==Ideology==

(1999). ''Religion and Nationality in Western Ukraine,'' p 26. Montreal and Kingston: McGill-Queen's University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The early Galician Russophile Nikolay Kmicykevich wrote an article in 1834 stating that the Russians were the same people from Western Ukraine to Kamchatka, from the White Sea to the Black Sea, and the language they spoke was the same Russian language.  He wrote that the standard Russian language was more acceptable for modern writing and that the popular dialects in Ukraine were corrupted by Polish influence. These ideas were stimulated by the Russian [[Pan-Slavism|pan-Slavist]] [[Mikhail Pogodin]], who stayed in [[Lviv]] (called then ''Lemberg'') in 1835 and 1839–1840 and who during this time influenced the local Ruthenian intelligentsia. No longer seeing themselves as representatives of a small Ruthenian nation of under three million people, weak in comparison to its neighbours, the Russophiles now saw themselves as the westernmost branch of the [[Great Russia]]n people. A Russian orientation also played into the Russophile's elitist tendencies, because the Russian literary language which they tried to adopt (many continued to use the Polish language in their daily lives) set the Russophile priests and nobles apart from the Ukrainian-speaking peasants. Politically, the Russophiles came to advocate the idea of a union between a Galician Ruthenia and Russia.

One of the most active of the Galician Russophiles was the prominent historian, nobleman [[Denis Zubrytsky]], who helped convert many of the Galician elite to his cause. He was also the first to begin writing in standard Russian: as early as 1849 he started his main work, ''The History of the Ancient Galician-Russian Principality''. In a letter to his friend [[Mikhail Pogodin]], Zubrytsky claimed that his stated purpose was to acquaint his Galician people with Russian history and the Russian language.  Indeed, the historiography of the medieval [[Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia]] was largely begun by Galician Russophiles and served as the basis for their nation-building project (in contrast, the Ukrainophiles at that time focused on the history of the Cossacks).&lt;ref&gt;Serhiy Plokhy. (2005). ''Unmaking Imperial Russia." Toronto: University of Toronto Press, pp. 161–162.&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of literature and culture, the Russophiles promoted [[Nikolai Gogol]] and [[Ivan Naumovich]] in contrast to Ukrainophile emphasis on [[Taras Shevchenko]].&lt;ref&gt;Kai Struve. (2005). Peasants and Patriotic Celebrations. In ''Galicia: A Multicultured Land.'' (Hann &amp; Magocsi, Eds.) Toronto: University of Toronto Press, pg. 116&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of language, Galician Russophiles were strongly opposed to the adoption of the vernacular Ukrainian language spoken by peasants and instead supported the adoption of standard literary Russian.  This opposition was such that they even welcomed the [[Ems Ukaz|ban on the Ukrainian language in the Russian Empire in 1876]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Orest Subtelny]]. (2009).  ''Ukraine: A History.'' Toronto: [[University of Toronto]] Press&lt;/ref&gt;  Reflecting their belief that the people of Ukraine played a special role in the greater Russian nation, the leading Russophile thinker [[Ivan Naumovich]] declared that the Russian language was derived from "[[Little Russia]]n" and was only being readopted in Galicia. Indeed, Galician Russophiles wrote that one of the reasons for all East Slavs to adopt the Russian language was that the modern Russian language had been created in the 17th and 18th centuries by scholars from Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Snyder. (2003). ''The Reconstruction of Nations: Poland, Ukraine, Lithuania, Belarus, 1569–1999'' New Haven: Yale University Press pg. 124&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite some democratic elements (such as promoting literacy among peasants) Galician Russophilia tended to be antidemocratic and reactionary, placing it at odds with the democratic trends in 19th century society. For example, the Russophile leader Dennis Zubrytsky defended serfdom both before and after the emancipation of Austrian Galician serfs in 1848.

There were also antisemitic strains in Russophilism. From the 1860s to the 1880s some peasants hoped that the Tsar would come to Galicia and slaughter the Poles and the Jews.&lt;ref name = "construction"&gt;John Paul Himka. (2001). The Construction of Nationality in Galician Rus: Icarian Flights in Almost All Directions. In  ''Intellectuals and the Articulation of the Nation ''. Ronald Grigor Suny, Michael D. Kennedy (Eds.) Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press  pp. 133-145&lt;/ref&gt;  During the [[Russian occupation of Eastern Galicia, 1914–1915|Russian occupation of Galicia in 1914-1915]], a Galician Russophile newspaper spread rumours of anti-Russian Jewish uprisings in order to justify antisemitic pogroms by Russian troops, and Russophiles working within the Russian administration united with right-wing Russian elements in urging the Russian government to solve the "Jewish question" by stripping Jews of Russian citizenship, expelling them to Germany and distributing their property (along with that of Poles) among the local Ukrainian (who Moscophiles considered "Russian") people. The latter appeals were ignored by the Russian military, who did not want excessive disruptions to the local economy during the war. Russophiles who had been installed by the Russian authorities as mayors in some towns proceeded to shut down Jewish schools.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Victor Prusin. (2005).

==Rise and development==

Western Ukrainian Russophilia appeared in [[Carpathian Ruthenia]] at the end of the 18th century. At this time, several people from the region settled in Saint Petersburg, Russia, and obtained high academic positions. The best known of these was Vasilly Kukolnik (father of Russian playwright [[Nestor Kukolnik]]), a member of an old noble family who had studied in Vienna before coming to Russia. Vasilly's pupils included [[Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich of Russia]] and [[Nicholas I of Russia|Grand Duke Nikolai Pavlovich of Russia]], the future emperor Nicholas I of Russia. These émigrés, while adopting a sense of Russian patriotism, also maintained their ties to their homeland and tried to use their wealth to introduce Russian literature and culture to their region.  When the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848|Hungarians revolted]] against the Austrians in 1848, the local [[East Slavs]], antagonistic toward the [[Hungarians]] who had dominated them, were deeply moved by the presence of the seemingly invincible Russian troops sent by Nicholas to help crush the rebellion. At this time, Austria supported the Russophile movement as a counterbalance to Polish and Hungarian interests, and under the leadership of the Russophile nobleman Adolf Dobriansky, the people of Carpathian Ruthenia were granted limited autonomy, although the region reverted to Hungarian control after a few years.

In Galicia, Russophilia emerged as early as the 1830s, when "Society of scholars" was organized in [[Przemyśl]] and was stimulated in part by the presence in [[Lviv]]  in 1835 and from 1839–1840 of Russian [[Pan-Slavism|pan-Slavist]] [[Mikhail Pogodin]] who became acquainted with the local Ruthenian intelligentsia and became an influence on them. However, the movement did not come to dominate western Ukrainian society until the 1850s–60s.  Many proponents of Ruthenianism became disenchanted with Austria and linked themselves with the giant and powerful [[Russian Empire|Russian state]]. The relative rise of Russia's power in comparison to that of Austria during the 19th century also played a role in such feelings.  Events of the 1860s helped to increase pro-Russian feelings in Galicia.  Traditionally, the local Ruthenians had a naive belief that the Habsburg Emperor was on their side and that he would defend them against the Polish nobility.  From the late 1850s, Austrian courts often sided with (primarily Polish) nobles in land disputes with peasants, during which forests and pastures that the peasants had traditionally been using were deemed the property of the nobles.  This led to significant economic hardship for the peasants.  While this was happening, the Russian tsar had emancipated the peasants in Russian-ruled Ukraine.  In 1863-1864, an insurrection of Polish nobles in areas that included Russian-ruled Ukraine was brutally crushed by the Tsarist government, which in punishing the Polish rebels provided the Ukrainian peasants with relatively favorable compensation. Many Galicians began to approvingly contrast the Tsar's brutal treatment of the Polish nobles with the Austrians' seemingly taking the Polish side in the Polish-Ukrainian conflict.  Many of them came to believe that the plight of the Ukrainians was improving more under the Tsars than it was under the Austrians. In the testimony of one Austrian-Ukrainian peasant, "if there is no justice in Vienna, we will find it in the ''Moskal.''" &lt;ref&gt;John-Paul Himka. (1988). ''Galician Villagers in the Ukrainian National Movement in the Nineteenth Century.'' Edmonton: MacMillan Press in association with the Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies, University of Alberta. pp. 51-54&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time, the poet and scholar [[Yakiv Holovatsky]], a member of "The Ruthenian Trinity", joined the Russophile movement.   Soon thereafter, the Russophile priests of the St George Cathedral Circle came to dominate the local hierarchy of the Greek Catholic Church, thereby transforming that Church into an instrument of their cause. Russophiles took over Ruthenian academic institutions (such as the [[Stauropegion Institute]], with its printing press and large collection of archives) and the venerable Ruthenian newspaper ''Slovo'' ('The Word'), and under their leadership it became the most widely circulated newspaper among Western Ukrainians.  In 1870, the Russophiles formed a political organization, the Ruthenian Council (''Ruska Rada'') which represented the population of Western Ukraine. From the 1860s until the 1880s Western Ukrainian political, religious, and cultural life came to be dominated by the Russophiles.

==Pre-war decline and fall==
Within a generation of achieving dominance of Western Ukrainian life, however, the Russophiles were eclipsed by the Ukrainophiles, or so-called Populists (''Narodovtsi''). Originally coming from the same social stratum as the Russophiles (priests and nobles), but joined by the emerging secular intelligentsia, the Ukrainophiles were from a younger generation who unlike their fathers found enthusiasm for [[Taras Shevchenko]] rather than the Tsars, and embraced the peasantry rather than rejected it. This dedication to the people (the "bottom-up" approach) would prove successful against the Russophiles' elitist "top-down" orientation.

Many factors accounted for the collapse of the Russophile movement. The principal one was likely the Ukrainophiles' incredible capacity for organization. The Populists fanned out throughout the countryside in order to mobilize the masses to their cause. In 1868, the Lviv student [[Anatole Vakhnianyn]] organized and became the first head of the [[Prosvita]] organization, whose goal was to organize reading rooms and community theatres which became extremely popular among the peasants. In order to help the impoverished peasants, Ukrainophile activists set up [[co-operative]]s that would buy supplies in large quantities, eliminate middlemen, and pass the savings onto the villagers. [[Credit union]]s were created, providing inexpensive loans to farmers and eliminating the reliance on non-Ukrainian moneylenders. Russophiles belatedly tried to imitate such strategies but could not catch up. By 1914, Prosvita had 3,000 reading rooms while the Russophile version, the Kachkovsky Society (founded in 1874), had only 300. The Ukrainian co-operative union had 900 members, while the rival Russophile one had only 106. Prevented from publishing in the mainstream western Ukrainian newspapers by the Russophiles who controlled them, the Populists created their own. In 1880, ''Dilo'' ('Deed') was founded as a rival to the Russophile ''Slovo'' ("Word"), and due to the rising literacy of the Ukrainian population its circulation surpassed that of its older rival.

A second important factor for the success of the [[Ukrainophilia|Ukrainophiles]] was the exile from [[Dnieper Ukraine]] of a large number of well-educated and talented eastern Ukrainian writers and scholars, such as the writer [[Panteleimon Kulish]], the former professor of [[Kiev University|Kiev's University of St. Vladimir]], economist and philosopher [[Mykhailo Drahomanov]], and especially the historian [[Mykhailo Hrushevsky]], who headed a newly established department at the [[Lviv University|University of Lviv]]. Many of these figures settled or lived for a time in Lviv. In contrast, no prominent Russian intellectuals came to Galicia in order to help the local Russophile cause. This phenomenon led to the ironic observation of Drahomanov that the [[Ukrainophile|Ukrainianophiles]] were actually more in touch with contemporary Russian cultural and intellectual trends than were the Russophiles despite the latter group's love for Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Grigor Suny, Michael D. Kennedy. (2001)''Intellectuals and the Articulation of the Nation." Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press. pg. 136&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, while educated Ukrainophiles were coming to Galicia from the Russian Empire, local Russophiles in Galicia experienced a "brain drain" as many of them left western Ukraine for positions in Russia.  Many of classics teachers needed as a result of Russian educational reforms promoted by [[Dmitry Tolstoy]] in the 19th century were Galicians.&lt;ref&gt;Aleksei Miller. (2003).  ''The Ukrainian Question: The Russian Empire and Nationalism in the Nineteenth Century.'' Central European University Press pg.216&lt;/ref&gt; From among the local intelligentsia, [[Ivan Franko]] showed the literary potential of the vernacular Ukrainian language. The local declining number of Russophiles could not compete with the talent of these Ukrainophile cultural figures and scholars.

Help for the [[Ukrainophilia|Ukrainophile cause]] from eastern Ukraine also took the form of generous financial assistance from wealthy Ukrainian landowners. Due to restrictions against Ukrainian printing and the Ukrainian language imposed by the tsarist government in eastern Ukraine, eastern Ukrainian noble or Cossacks officer families who had not become Russified sent money to Galicia in order to sponsor Ukrainophile cultural activities there. These people, enjoying gentry status, were generally much wealthier than the priests and priests' sons who dominated the local Galician movements.  The amount sent by these private individuals from Russian-ruled Ukraine to Ukrainophile causes likely equalled the subsidies sent by the Russian government to Galician Russophiles.&lt;ref name = "construction"/&gt; For example, Yelyzaveta Myloradovich, a noblewoman from Poltava, donated 20,000 Austrian crowns to the [[Shevchenko Scientific Society]].&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Wilson. (2000). ''Ukrainians: Unexpected Nation.'' New Haven: Yale University Press, pg. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

The Austrian government also contributed significantly to the Ukrainophiles' victory. Initially Austria had supported Russophilia as a counterbalance to the Poles and Hungarians.  During the latter part of the 19th century, as Austria-Hungary and Russia became rivals, the Austrian authorities became alarmed by the Russophiles' activities. To maintain the loyalty of the Ukrainian population, the Austrian authorities made concessions to Ukrainian causes, such as expanding the Ukrainian educational system, and in 1893 made the Ukrainophile version of the vernacular Ukrainian language the language of instruction. Doing so effectively shut the Russophiles out of the educational system. During the 1880s the Austrians put many Russophiles on trial for treason or espionage.  These trials were widely publicized, and served to discredit the Russophiles among the Ukrainian people, most of whom continued to be loyal to the [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Austrian Emperor]]. One of the prosecutors was [[Kost Levitsky]], who later became an important Ukrainian politician.  The Austrians also deported an editor of the Russophile newspaper ''Slovo'' and deposed the Russophile head of the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Greek Catholic Church]], Metropolitan [[Joseph Sembratovych]].

In 1899, [[Count]] [[Andrey Sheptytsky]] became new [[Metropolitan bishop|head]] of the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Greek Catholic Church]]. A Polonised nobleman from an old Ukrainian family, he adopted the [[Ukrainian language]] and a Ukrainophile orientation. Although Sheptytsky did not interfere in priests' personal activities and writings, he slowly purged the Church's hierarchy of Russophiles. Despite drawing some Ukrainophiles' criticism for the slow progression of his changes, under Sheptytsky's leadership the Church gradually ceased being a bastion of Russophilism and instead became a staunchly Ukrainophile one.

Lacking support within their community and from the Austrian government, the remaining Russophiles turned to outsiders for support and became more radical in their politics.  They founded the [[Russian National Party]], called for complete identification with Russia and promoted the conversion of the western Ukrainian people to Orthodoxy.  The Russophiles now largely depended on financing from the Russian government and Russian private sponsors (the Galician-Russian Benevolent Society was established in Saint Petersburg in 1908) and from ultraconservative Galician Polish aristocrats. The Polish ultraconservatives had become alarmed by the social mobilization of the Ukrainian peasants and sought to use the Russophile movement as a way of dividing the Ukrainian community. They were also united with the Russophiles in opposition to a proposed alliance between Ukrainophiles and politically moderate Poles. Polish support provided the Russophiles with some advantages during elections, some advantages for Russophile priests in obtaining parishes, and tolerance towards Russophile political activities.&lt;ref&gt;[[Orest Subtelny]].

Montreal: McGill-Queen's University Press, pg. 142-143&lt;/ref&gt;  The Russophiles also attempted, with some limited success, to exploit the differences between Ukrainian [[Western Ukrainian nobility|petty gentry]] and peasants.  The gentry were somewhat more likely to support Russophilia than were peasants.  A noble candidate in the elections of 1911, Ivan Kulchytsky, declared "now we have recovered our sight and shall not allow the bastards to trick us with Ukraine…. You should know that from now on we do not give a damn for Ukraine and have returned to the historical road. From now on we are Russians." &lt;ref name = "zayarnyuk"&gt;AndriyZayarnyuk. (2011).

Help from Russian and Polish patrons largely failed to prevent the Russophile decline. By the early 20th century, the Russophiles became a minority in Galicia. Within the Church, they were nicknamed "bisons," in scholar Himka's words an "ancient, shaggy species on the verge of extinction." Of nineteen Ukrainian periodicals published in Galicia in 1899, sixteen were Ukrainophile in orientation, only two were Russophile in orientation and one was neutral.&lt;ref name = "Himka142"/&gt;  In the 1907 elections to the Viennese parliament, the Ukrainophiles won 22 seats while the Russophiles won five. But the Russophiles, due to Polish interference, won elections to the Galician parliament the same year by taking 11 seats, the Ukrainophiles 10. In 1913, 30 Ukrainophile and only 1 Russophile delegate were sent to the Galician Diet. There were certain regional patterns in the support for Russophilism, in that it was most popular in the extreme western parts of eastern Galicia, particularly in the [[Lemkos|Lemko]] region of centred on the city of [[Przemyśl]]. This region, closest to Polish ethnographic territory, may have been most receptive to Russophilia's radical differentiation of Ukrainians/Ruthenians from Poles.&lt;ref&gt;John Paul Himka. (1999). ''Religion and Nationality in Western Ukraine.'' Montreal: McGill-Queen's University Press, pp. 147-148&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War I and Afterwards==
Immediately before the outbreak of World War I, the Austrian and Hungarian governments held numerous treason trials of those suspected of Russophile subversion. When the Austrians were driven from Galicia in August 1914, they avenged themselves upon suspected Russophiles and their families. Russophiles were punished for allegedly seeking to separate Galicia, Bukovina and parts of northern Hungary from Austria-Hungary and attaching them to Russia, of seeking volunteers for the Russian army, and of organizing a pro-Russian paramilitary group known as the ''Russkie Druzhiny'' – a Russophile counterpart to the Ukrainophile pro-Austrian [[Ukrainian Sich Riflemen]].&lt;ref&gt;Mark von Hagen. (2007). ''War in a European Borderland.'' University of Washington Press. pg. 10&lt;/ref&gt;  Hundreds of suspected Russophiles were shot, and thirty thousand were sent to the [[Talerhof]] concentration camp, where approximately three thousand died of exposure.
[[Image:Talerhof1914 1917.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Talerhof Concentration Camp, where 30,000 alleged Russophiles were interred by Austria during World War I]]
The Russian administration of Galicia lasted from August 1914 until June 1915. Russian [[Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich of Russia (1856–1929)|Grand Duke Nicholas]] issued a manifesto proclaiming that the people of Galicia were brothers who had "languished for centuries under a foreign yoke" and urged them to "raise the banner of United Russia." &lt;ref&gt;''Ukraine on the Road to Freedom, published by the Ukrainian National Committee of the United States, 1919. pp.41–42&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, with the help of local Russophiles, the Russian administration, aware that the Ukrainophiles were loyal to the Austro-Hungarian Empire and that they had organized the Ukrainian legion of the Austro-Hungarian army, engaged in a harsh persecution of the [[Ukrainophilia|Ukrainophile]] leaders and their ideology. Ukrainian schools were forcibly converted to Russian-language instruction,&lt;ref name="Magosci 1996, p 465"&gt;Magosci 1996, p 465.&lt;/ref&gt; reading rooms, newspapers, co-operatives and credit unions were closed, and hundreds of community leaders were arrested and exiled under suspicion of collaboration. The popular head of the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]], [[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan]] [[Andrey Sheptytsky]] was arrested and exiled to Russia. Although [[Nicholas II]] issued a decree forbidding forceful conversion from Uniatism to Orthodoxy, except in cases where 75% of the parishioners approved,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://orthodox.is.lviv.ua/lvivep/russia.htm|script-title=ru:Под русской властью (1914-1915 гг.)|trans-title=Under Russian dominion (1914-1915)|language=ru|publisher=Lviv Eparchy of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church|accessdate=22 April 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050928141658/http://orthodox.is.lviv.ua/lvivep/russia.htm|archivedate=28 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ultimate goal was the liquidation of the Ukrainian Catholic Church.&lt;ref name="Magosci 1996, p 465"/&gt; In addition to its head, hundreds of priests were exiled to Russia and replaced by Orthodox priests, who urged the parishioners to convert to Orthodoxy. The behaviour of the Russian authorities was so heavy-handed that it was denounced as a "European scandal" in the Russian [[Duma]] by the Russian statesman [[Pavel Milyukov]].&lt;ref&gt;Subtelny 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; The Russians were aided in their suppression of Ukrainian culture by local Russophiles &lt;ref&gt;Mark Von Hagen. (2007).

Such actions angered most of the local Ukrainian population.

When Austria regained Galicia in [[Gorlice-Tarnów Offensive|June 1915]], most of the remaining Galician Russophiles and their families retreated alongside the Russian army in fear of reprisals. Approximately 25,000&lt;ref name="Magosci 1996, p 465"/&gt; of them were resettled near [[Rostov-on-Don]]. Among those that did not leave, the Austrians arrested and sentenced to death approximately thirty noted Russophiles, including two members of parliament, [[Dmytro Markov]] and Volodymyr Kurylovich (their sentences were commuted to life imprisonment and they were released in 1917).,&lt;ref&gt;Magosci 1996, p 466.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Metodyj Trochanovskij]].  [[Kost Levitsky]], a prominent [[Ukrainophilia|Ukrainophile]] leader and the future president of the [[West Ukrainian National Republic]], appeared as a prosecutor during the trials against the Russophiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Terezin i Talergof : k 50-letnej godovščine tragedii galic.-rus. naroda

When civil war broke out in Russia, some Galician Russophiles then fought in the ranks of the White Army, specifically under [[Lavr Kornilov]], in the hope that Galicia would become part of a democratic White Russia.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Robert Magocsi]]. (1983). ''Galicia: a historical survey and bibliographic guide.'' Toronto: University of Toronto Press pg. 184&lt;/ref&gt;

After the collapse of Austria-Hungary the Ukrainians of Galicia proclaimed the West Ukrainian National Republic. Between 70 and 75 thousand men fought in its [[Ukrainian Galician Army]].  They lost their war and the territory was annexed by Poland.  However, the experience of proclaiming a Ukrainian state and fighting for it significantly intensified and deepened the Ukrainian orientation within Galicia.&lt;ref name="suny2"&gt;Ronald Grigor Suny, Michael D. Kennedy. (2001)''Intellectuals and the Articulation of the Nation." Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press. pp. 131-132&lt;/ref&gt;

The Russophile movement barely clung on during the interwar period, supported by the Polish government which funded and granted Russophiles some institutions such as the [[Stauropegion Institute]] (which was returned to Russophiles in 1922 after it had been given to the Ukrainophiles in 1915) &lt;ref name = "CIUS"&gt;[http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CS%5CT%5CStauropegionInstitute.htm Stauropegion Institute] Encyclopedia of Ukraine, vol. 5. (1993). Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies, [[University of Toronto]] Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and which subsidized the movement in order to try to divide Ukrainian society.  This had little effect beyond the Lemko regions in the extreme west, and since the interwar era, Galicia has been the centre of [[Ukrainian nationalism]].&lt;ref name="suny2"/&gt;

Russophilia disappeared in western Ukraine during and after Soviet rule.&lt;ref name="suny2"/&gt;

==Rusynophilia==
The Russophile tradition persisted in the portions of [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] west of the [[Dukla Pass]], resulting in the formation of the [[Lemko-Rusyn Republic]].  [[Metodyj Trochanovskij]] continued to espouse the Rusyn national identity, up to the start of World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Horbal |first=Bohdan |title=Metodyj Trochanovskij (1885–1947) |url=http://www.carpatho-rusyn.org/lemkos/metodyj.htm |accessdate=2008-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Karpatska Rus']], a [[Rusyn language]] newspaper published in the United States avoided any suggestion that the [[Lemkos]] were a branch of the [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Magocsi|first1=Paul |authorlink1= Paul R.

Call for a [[Lemkos|Lemko]] autonomous region in Poland persisted at least until 1989, with a [[Rusyns|Rusyn]] than a [[Russia]]n orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Harasymowicz|first1=Jerzy|year= 1989|title= Lemkow pod rozwage|journal= Gazeta Krakowska |publisher= |volume=168 |issue= 19 July|pages= |url= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Seny''''' ({{IPA-ca|ˈsɛɲ|ec}}; from Proto-Germanic *sinnaz) is a form of ancestral [[Catalonia|Catalan]] wisdom or sensibleness. It involves well-pondered perception of situations, level-headedness, awareness, integrity, and right action.  More specifically, a ''[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]'' anthropologist defined ''seny'' as "a kind of refined good sense and self-realization."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=National Geographic People of the World|page=181|last=Kostyal|first=K.M.|year=2001|publisher=''[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]''|ISBN=0-7922-6401-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The opposite of ''seny'' is known as '''''rauxa''''' ({{IPA-ca|ˈrawʃə|pron}}) "sudden determination or action".&lt;ref&gt;[http://dlc.iec.cat/results.asp?txtEntrada=rauxa&amp;operEntrada=0]''Institut d'Estudis Catalans''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural significance==
Many Catalans consider ''seny'' something unique to their culture, a true [[Catalan symbols|Catalan symbol]]. ''Seny'' as a particular characteristic of Catalan society is based on a set of ancestral local customs stemming from the [[Ethics|scale of values]] and [[Sociology|social norms]] of traditional Catalan rural society. The values of ''seny'' were transmitted from generation to generation without much change by the exemplary behaviour of the elder members of the family, as well as in the shape of aphorisms and moral stories. The latter were largely based on [[Christian]] values and their examples and illustrations often included animals and plants that were common in rural Catalonia.

This oral lore caught the attention of [[Josep Torras i Bages]], bishop of [[Vic]] at the beginning of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Josep Torras i Bages, ''La tradició catalana'', 1892&lt;/ref&gt;
He became very interested in the pattern in which the ''seny'' was transmitted from one generation to the other as an [[oral tradition]]. Thus he encouraged [[Josep Abril i Virgili]] (1869–1918), a writer, to gather the moral stories and illustrate them in a book that was published as ''Bon seny'' ("Good sense"). This more or less representative compilation of moral lessons regarding ''seny'' was illustrated by artist [[Joan Junceda]] (1881–1948).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enciclopedia.cat/fitxa_v2.jsp?NDCHEC=0035068 Joan Junceda: l'Enciclopèdia&amp;nbsp;– enciclopedia.cat] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219034538/http://www.enciclopedia.cat/fitxa_v2.jsp?NDCHEC=0035068 |date=2012-02-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Published in the Catalan language before the [[Spanish Civil War]] ''Bon seny'' became rare during [[General Franco]]'s era, when so much Catalan printed material had been burned and printing in Catalan was severely restricted.&lt;ref&gt;'''Bon seny''', aforismes, faules i acudits; Balmes DL, Barcelona, Reprinted 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the ''seny'' proverbs that defined traditional Catalan values have lost most of their sense today. The reason is the erosion of Christian values as fundamental in present-day [[Postchristianity|postchristian]] Catalan society, which sees itself today as a society based largely on secular principles.

''Seny'' is mentioned in the motto of [[castell]]s, the Catalan tradition of building human towers, as one of the values of that endeavour: ''Força, equilibri, valor i seny'' (strength, balance, courage, and ''seny'').

==Examples==
*Many of the ''seny'' aphorisms are short:

&lt;center&gt;
{|
|
:''Tenen els plaers de la vida,
:''bona entrada i mala eixida.

:''L'home avar és com el porc,
:''no aprofita fins que és mort.

:''No vos 'nemoreu, amor,
:''de cap fadrina gallarda
:''que és com la flor d'olivarda
:''molt guapa, i dolenta d'olor

:''Home pelut,
:''o és molt savi o és molt ruc.
||
:The pleasures of life have,
:a good entrance and a bad exit.

:The tight-fisted man is like a pig,
:he is only useful after death.

:My dear one, don't fall in love
:with any woman who only has good looks,
:she is like a [[false yellowhead]] ''(Dittrichia viscosa)'' flower:
:beautiful, but full of stench (unpleasantness).

:A hairy man,
:is either very wise or (brutish) like a donkey.
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

*The following story, ''La rata magra'' o ''La rata engarjolada'', illustrates the dangers of greed:

&lt;center&gt;
{|
|
:''Rata magra veu l'ocell,''
:''tranquil a dintre sa gàbia,''
:''i, amb tota la seva ràbia, s'hi fica;
:''i el passarell té un surt fort, i es mort.''

:''Rata magra s'el cruspeix,''
:''mes s'ha tant ben atipada,''
:''que, de cop, no té passada.''

:''Moral:''
:''Quan t'atii la maldat,''
:''pensa aixó que es veritat:''
:''Panxa prim hi passaràs,''
:''massa fart t'hi quedaràs.''

||

:The lean rat sees the bird
:sitting quietly in its cage,
:and full of anger she enters it
:and the bird dies startled.

:The lean rat eats it,
:but she has filled her belly so much
:that, suddenly, she is not able to leave (the cage).

:''Morale:''
:When evil tempts you,
:think about the following truth:
:With a lean belly you will escape
:Too full, you will be trapped.
|}

A '''stylus''', plural '''styli''' or '''styluses''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/stylus|title=Stylus - Define Stylus at Dictionary.com|work=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[writing utensil]] or a small tool for some other form of marking or shaping, for example, in [[pottery]]. It can also be a computer accessory that is used to assist in navigating or providing more [[Accuracy and precision|precision]] when using [[touchscreen]]s. It usually refers to a narrow elongated staff, similar to a modern [[ballpoint pen]].  Many styluses are heavily curved to be held more easily. Another widely used writing tool is the stylus used by blind users in conjunction with the [[Slate and stylus|slate]] for punching out the dots in [[Braille]].&lt;ref Name="AFB"&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Wachstafel rem.jpg|thumb|Reproduction of a Roman-style [[wax tablet]] with three styluses]]
Styluses were first used by the ancient Mesopotamians in order to write in [[cuneiform]]. They were mostly made of [[Phragmites|reeds]] and had a slightly curved trapezoidal section.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cammarosano|first=Michele|date=2014|title=The Cuneiform Stylus|url=https://www.academia.edu/12047738/The_Cuneiform_Stylus|journal=Mesopotamia|language=en|volume=XLIX|pages=53-90|via=https://osf.io/dfng4/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bramanti|first1=Armando|title=The Cuneiform Stylus.

Cuneiform was entirely based on the "[[Wedge (geometry)|wedge]]-shaped" mark that the end of a cut reed made when pushed into a [[clay tablet]]; from [[Latin]] ''cuneus'' = wedge. The linear writings of Crete in the first half of the second millennium BC which were made on clay tablets that were left to dry in the sun until they became "leather" hard before being incised by the stylus. The linear nature of the writing was also dictated by the use of the stylus.

In Western Europe styluses were widely used until the [[late Middle Ages]]. For learning purposes the stylus was gradually replaced by a [[Slate (writing)|writing slate]]. From the mid-14th century improved water-powered [[paper mill]]s produced large and cheap quantities of paper and the [[wax tablet]] and stylus disappeared completely from daily life.

==Etymology==
[[File:Stylus.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Four examples of medieval styluses for writing on [[wax tablet]]s. Two are made of iron, one brass and one bone stylus.]]
The word "stylus" (along with the word "style") comes from the Latin word ''stilus'' meaning: "a stake; a pointed instrument, used by the Romans, for writing upon [[wax tablet]]s,"&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.nd.edu/latgramm.htm ND.edu], [[University of Notre Dame]] online latin dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; which derives from the Greek word στῦλος meaning "pillar" and "stile for writing on waxed tablets."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dstu%3Dlos perseus.tufts.edu], στῦλος at [[Liddell &amp; Scott]]&lt;/ref&gt; A different suggestion is that the word does not derive from the Greek word "στῦλος", but that it has a common root with the Greek verb "στίζω" (meaning "mark"). According to the 1875 London Dictionary of Greek &amp; Roman Antiquities a Stylus is "an object tapering like an architectural column; a metal instrument resembling a pencil in size and shape, used for writing or recording impressions upon waxed tablets. It signifies:

"An iron instrument (Ov. Met. IX.521; Martial, XIV.21), resembling a pencil in size and shape, used for writing upon waxed tablets (Plaut. Bacch. IV.4.63; Plin. H.N. XXXIV.14). At one end it was sharpened to a point for scratching the characters upon the wax (Quintil. i.1 §27), while the other end being flat and circular served to render the surface of the tablets smooth again, and so to obliterate what had been written. Thus, vertere stilum means to erase, and hence to correct, as in the well-known precept saepe stilum vertas (Hor. Sat. 1.10.72; Cic. Verr. II.41)."

There exists minor controversy about the correct pluralization of "stylus". Some assert that "stylus" is a direct loanword from [[Latin]] and should be pluralised as "styli". However, "stylus" is an English word based on the Latin word "stilus", and is more appropriately pluralised in English as "styluses". Occasionally the pluralisation "stylii" is seen.

==Use in arts==
Styluses are still used in various arts and crafts. Example situations: rubbing off [[dry transfer]] letters, tracing designs onto a new surface with [[carbon paper]], and hand [[Embossing (paper)|embossing]]. Styluses are also used to [[engraving|engrave]] into materials like [[metal]] or [[clay]].

Styluses are used to make dots as found in folk art and Mexican pottery artifacts. [[Oaxaca]] dot art is created using styluses.

==Smartphones and computing==
[[File:Styluses.JPG|thumb|240px|left|Styluses for different [[Personal digital assistant|PDAs]]]]
{{Main article|Stylus (computing)}}
Modern day devices, such as  phones, can often be used with a stylus to accurately navigate through menus, send messages etc. 
Today, the term ''stylus'' often refers to an input tool usually used with [[touchscreen]]-enabled devices, such as [[Tablet computer|Tablet PC]]s, to accurately navigate interface elements, send messages, etc. This also prevents smearing the screen with oils from one's fingers. Styluses may also be used for handwriting; or for drawing using [[graphics tablet]]s.

Many new phones have a built-in stylus which tucks in behind the back cover. Some styluses may extend and contract into small, pen-like cylinders, which are easy to put away.

Styluses come in both passive and active versions.
A passive or capacitive stylus is a stylus that acts just like a finger when touching a device screen. There is no electronic communication between a passive stylus and a device. The device cannot tell the difference between a finger and a passive stylus.

An active stylus includes electronic components that communicate with the touchscreen controller on a device. Active pens are typically used for note taking, on-screen drawing/painting, and electronic document annotation.
As before, the stylus is pointed or rounded at one end and is made to fit in the grip of a hand comfortably. These styluses can be found in many different styles.

Palm Rejection:  
Since many modern tablets make use of multi-touch recognition, some stylus and app manufactures have created palm rejection technologies into their products.  This works to turn off the multi-touch feature allowing the palm to rest on the tablet while still recognizing the stylus.

Haptic Stylus:
Other than the types above, a haptic stylus is a stylus that simulates the realistic physical sensations on digital surfaces (e.g., tablet computer, smart phone etc.) which can be felt in handwriting tasks on paper. The sensation is sometimes enhanced by the combination of auditory and tactile illusions, such as [[RealPen]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2984550&amp;CFID=855624233&amp;CFTOKEN=66167935 RealPen]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific instruments==
A stylus is also an instrument used to scribe a recording into smoked foil or glass. In various scientific instruments this method may be employed instead of a pen for recording as it has the advantage of being able to operate over a wide temperature range, does not clog or dry prematurely, and has nearly negligible friction in comparison to other methods. These characteristics were useful in certain types of early [[seismograph]]s and in recording [[barograph]]s that were once used to verify [[sailplane]] records. The styluses used in [[scanning tunneling microscope]]s have only a single [[atom]] at the tip; these are effectively the sharpest styluses possible.

==Linear thrackles==
A '''linear thrackle''' is a thrackle drawn in such a way that its edges are straight line segments.  Every linear thrackle has at most as many edges as vertices, a fact that was observed by [[Paul Erdős]]. Erdős observed that, if a vertex ''v'' is connected to three or more edges ''vw'', ''vx'', and ''vy'' in a linear thrackle, then at least one of those edges lies on a line that separates two other edges; without loss of generality assume that ''vw'' is such an edge, with ''x'' and ''y'' lying in opposite closed halfspaces bounded by line ''vw''. Then, ''w'' must have [[degree (graph theory)|degree]] one, because no other edge than ''vw'' can touch both ''vx'' and ''vy''. Removing ''w'' from the thrackle produces a smaller thrackle, without changing the difference between the numbers of edges and vertices. On the other hand, if every vertex has at most two neighbors, then by the [[handshaking lemma]] the number of edges is at most the number of vertices.&lt;ref name="e46"&gt;{{citation|authorlink=Paul Erdős|first=P.|last=Erdős|title=On  sets of distances  of ''n'' points|journal=[[American  Mathematical  Monthly]]|volume=53|year=1946|pages=248–250|url=http://www.renyi.hu/~p_erdos/1946-03.pdf|doi=10.2307/2305092}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Based on Erdős' proof, one can infer that every linear thrackle is a [[pseudoforest]]. Every cycle of odd length may be arranged to form a linear thrackle, but this is not possible for an even-length cycle, because if one edge of the cycle is chosen arbitrarily then the other cycle vertices must lie alternatingly on opposite sides of the line through this edge.

[[Micha Perles]] provided another simple proof that linear thrackles have at most ''n'' edges, based on the fact that in a linear thrackle every edge has an endpoint at which the edges span an angle of at most 180°, and for which it is the most clockwise edge within this span. For, if not, there would be two edges, incident to opposite endpoints of the edge and lying on opposite sides of the line through the edge, which could not cross each other. But each vertex can only have this property with respect to a single edge, so the number of edges is at most equal to the number of vertices.&lt;ref name="pach"/&gt;

As Erdős also observed, the set of pairs of points realizing the [[diameter]] of a point set must form a linear thrackle: no two diameters can be disjoint from each other, because if they were then their four endpoints would have a pair at farther distance apart than the two disjoint edges. For this reason, every set of ''n'' points in the plane can have at most ''n'' diametral pairs, answering a question posed in 1934 by [[Heinz Hopf]] and [[Erika Pannwitz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

In [[computational geometry]], the method of [[rotating calipers]] can be used to form a linear thrackle from any set of points in [[convex position]], by  connecting pairs of points that support parallel lines tangent to the [[convex hull]] of the points. This graph contains as a subgraph the thrackle of diameter pairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Thrackle conjecture==
{{unsolved|mathematics|Can a thrackle have more edges than vertices?}}
[[Image:6-cycle thrackle.png|thumb|A thrackle embedding of a 6-cycle graph.]]
[[John Horton Conway|John H. Conway]] has conjectured that, in any thrackle, the number of edges is at most equal to the number of vertices.  Conway himself uses the terminology ''paths'' and ''spots'' (for ''edges'' and ''vertices'' respectively), so '''Conway's thrackle conjecture''' was originally stated
in the form ''every thrackle has at least as many spots as paths.''

Equivalently, the thrackle conjecture may be stated as ''every thrackle is a [[pseudoforest]].'' More specifically, if the thrackle conjecture is true, the thrackles may be exactly characterized by a result of Woodall: they are the pseudoforests in which there is no cycle of length four and at most one odd cycle.&lt;ref name="lps"/&gt;&lt;ref name="woodall"&gt;{{citation |first=D. R. |last=Woodall |contribution=Thrackles and deadlock |title=Combinatorial Mathematics and Its Applications |editor-first=D. J. A. |editor-last=Welsh |publisher=Academic Press |year=1969 |pages=335–348 |mr=0277421 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been proven that every cycle graph other than C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; has a thrackle embedding, which shows that the conjecture is [[List_of_mathematical_jargon#sharp|sharp]].  That is, there are thrackles having the same number of spots as paths. At the other extreme, the worst-case scenario is that the number of spots is twice the number of paths; this is also attainable.

The thrackle conjecture is known to be true for thrackles drawn in such a way that every edge is an ''x''-monotone curve, crossed at most once by every vertical line.&lt;ref name="pach"&gt;{{citation

==Known bounds==
{{harvtxt|Lovász|Pach|Szegedy|1997}} proved that every [[bipartite graph|bipartite]] thrackle is a [[planar graph]], although not drawn in a planar way.&lt;ref name="lps"/&gt; As a consequence, they show that every thrackleable graph with ''n'' vertices has at most 2''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;3 edges. Since then, this bound has been improved several times. First, it was improved to 3(''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)/2,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Cairns |first1=G. |last2=Nikolayevsky |first2=Y. |title=Bounds for generalized thrackles |journal=Discrete and Computational Geometry |volume=23 |year=2000 |issue=2 |pages=191–206 |mr=1739605 |doi=10.1007/PL00009495}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and another improvement led to a bound of roughly 1.428''n''.&lt;ref name="fp"&gt;{{citation |last1=Fulek |first1=R. |last2=Pach |first2=J. |title=A computational approach to Conway's thrackle conjecture|journal= Computational Geometry |volume=44 |year=2011|issue=6-7 |pages=345–355 |mr=2785903 |doi=10.1007/978-3-642-18469-7_21}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the method used to prove the latter result yields for any ε&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 a finite algorithm that either 
improves the bound to (1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;ε)''n'' or disproves the conjecture. The current record is due to {{harvtxt|Fulek|Pach|2017}}, who proved a bound of 1.3984''n''.&lt;ref name="fp2"&gt;{{citation |last1=Fulek |first1=R. |last2=Pach |first2=J. |title=Thrackles: An Improved Upper Bound |series= International Symposium on Graph Drawing and Network Visualization |year=2017| |pages=160–166 |doi=10.1007/978-3-319-73915-1_14}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

If the conjecture is false, a minimal counterexample would have the form of two even cycles sharing a vertex.&lt;ref name="woodall"/&gt; Therefore, to prove the conjecture, it would suffice to prove that graphs of this type cannot be drawn as thrackles.

The '''trace''' in [[semiotics]]{{citation needed|date=March 2011}} is a concept developed by [[Jacques Derrida]] in [[Writing and Difference]] to denote the history that a [[Sign (semiotics)|sign]] carries with it as the result of its use through time.{{page needed|date=March 2011}} Words like "black", for example, carry the trace of all their previous uses with them, making them sensitive, loaded words when used in any context. The trace then reveals the possibility for alternative interpretation of concepts, regardless of how carefully articulated they may be, whenever they are expressed in language.

'''Valentin Grigoriyevich Rasputin''' ({{IPAc-en|r|æ|ˈ|s|p|j|uː|t|ɪ|n}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dictionary.com/browse/rasputin "Rasputin"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-ru|Валенти́н Григо́рьевич Распу́тин}}; 15 March 1937{{spaced ndash}}14 March 2015) was a Russian writer. He was born and lived much of his life in the [[Irkutsk Oblast]] in Eastern Siberia. Rasputin's works depict rootless urban characters and the fight for survival of centuries-old traditional rural ways of life, addressing complex questions of ethics and spiritual revival.

== Biography ==
Valentin Rasputin was born on 15 March 1937 in the village of [[Ust-Udinsky District|Atalanka]] in [[Irkutsk Oblast]] of Russia. His father worked for a village cooperative store, and his mother was a nurse. Soon after his birth, the Rasputin family moved to the village of Atalanka in the same Ust-Uda district, where Rasputin spent his childhood.&lt;ref name=a&gt;[http://www.peoples.ru/art/literature/prose/roman/rasputin/index1.html Валентин Григорьевич Распутин (Valentin Rasputin)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
Both villages, which were located on the bank of the [[Angara River]], do not exist in their original locations any more, as much of the Angara Valley was flooded by the [[Bratsk Reservoir]] in the 1960s, and the villages were relocated to higher ground.&lt;ref&gt;Translator's Introduction to [[Siberia, Siberia]] (1996), p. 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the writer remembered growing up in Siberia as a difficult, but happy time. "As soon as we kids learned how to walk, we would toddle to the river with our fishing rods; still a tender child, we would run to the [[taiga]], which would begin right outside the village, to pick berries and mushrooms; since young age, we would get into a boat and take the oars..."&lt;ref name=detstvo&gt;[http://detstvo.irkutsk.ru/authors/Rasputin/index.html Valentin Grigoriyevich Rasputin, biography] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Rasputin finished the 4-year elementary school in Atalanka in 1948, his parents sent the precocious boy to a middle school and then high school in the district center, Ust-Uda, some 50&amp;nbsp;km away from his home village. He was the first child from his village to continue his education in this way.&lt;ref name=pankeev&gt;Ivan Pankeev (Иван ПАНКЕЕВ) [http://filgrad.ru/texts2/punk/punk1.htm Valentin Rasputin] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081025193938/http://filgrad.ru/texts2/punk/punk1.htm |date=2008-10-25 }} {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rasputin graduated from [[Irkutsk University]] in 1959, and started working for local [[Komsomol]] newspapers in [[Irkutsk]] and [[Krasnoyarsk]]. He published his first short story in 1961.

An important point in Rasputin's early literary career was a young writers' seminar in September 1965 in [[Chita, Zabaykalsky Krai|Chita]] led by [[Vladimir Chivilikhin]] ([[:ru:Чивилихин, Владимир Алексеевич|Владимир Чивилихин]]), who encouraged the young writer's literary aspirations and recommended him for membership in the prestigious [[Union of Soviet Writers]]. Since then Rasputin has considered Chivilikhin his "literary godfather".&lt;ref name=pankeev/&gt;

In 1967, after the publication of his ''Money for Maria'', Rasputin was indeed admitted to the Union of Soviet Writers. Over the next three decades, he published a number of novels, many became both widely popular among the Russian reading public and critically acclaimed.
[[File:Valentin-rasputin-putin.jpg|thumb|right|210px|Rasputin being awarded the [[Order of Merit for the Fatherland]] by President [[Vladimir Putin]], 2002.]]

In 1980, after researching the [[Battle of Kulikovo]] for two years, Rasputin was [[baptism|baptised]] by an [[Russian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] priest in nearby [[Yelets]].&lt;ref name=izv65&gt;[http://izvestia.ru/culture/article15643/ Interview with Rapsutin at his 65th birthday] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060718171724/http://www.izvestia.ru/culture/article15643/ |date=2006-07-18 }} [[Izvestiya]] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rasputin's literary work is closely connected to his activism on social and environmental issues. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s Rasputin, called by some the leading figure of the "Siberian environmental lobby",&lt;ref&gt;Ronnie D. Lipschutz, Ken Conca, "The State and Social Power in Global Environmental Politics". Columbia University Press,  1993. {{ISBN|0-231-08107-3}}. [https://books.google.com/books?id=gZsmfxeQQGEC Book info on Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;  took an active part in the campaign for protection of [[Lake Baikal]] and against the [[Northern river reversal|diversion of Siberian fresh water]] to [[Central Asia]]n republics. In the 1990s he participated in the [[Russian nationalism|nationalist]] opposition movement. Having spent most of his adult life in Irkutsk, Rasputin remains one of the leading intellectual figures of this Siberian city.

He was a guest for many events in the city of Irkutsk, including the unveilings of the monuments to Tsar [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]], [[Alexander Vampilov]]  and [[Alexander Kolchak]]. He organized the readers' conference in Irkutsk Central Scientific Library named after Molchanov-Sibirsky.

Rasputin's daughter Maria died in the 2006 crash of [[S7 Airlines Flight 778]], and his wife died six years later. He died in [[Moscow]] on 14 March 2015, a day short of his 78th birthday.&lt;ref name=died&gt;{{cite news|title=Умер писатель Валентин Распутин|url=http://lenta.ru/news/2015/03/15/rasputin/|agency=[[Lenta.ru|Lenta]]|date=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His funeral service was led by Patriarch Kirill of the Russian Orthodox Church, and President [[Vladimir Putin]] paid his respects. (In 2014 Rasputin had co-signed a letter by writers in support of Putin's annexation of the Crimea.)

== Rasputin's writing ==
Rasputin is closely associated with a movement in post-war Soviet literature known as "[[village prose]]," or sometimes "rural prose" (деревенская проза).  Beginning in the time of the [[Khrushchev Thaw]] (оттепель), village prose was praised for its stylistic and thematic departures from [[socialist realism]].  Village prose works usually focused on the hardships of the Soviet peasantry, espoused an idealized picture of traditional village life, and implicitly or explicitly criticized official modernization projects. Rasputin's 1979 novel ''Farewell to Matyora'', which depicts a fictional Siberian village which is to be evacuated and cleared so that a [[hydroelectric dam]] can be constructed further down the [[Angara River]], was considered the epitome of this genre.&lt;ref name=Parthe&gt;Kathleen Parthe, "Russian Village Prose: The Radiant Past": Princeton, NJ: Princeton 
University Press, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Peterson"&gt;Dale E. Peterson, “Samovar Life: Russian Nurture and Russian Nature in the Rural Prose of Valentin Rasputin,” ''The Russian Review'' vol53 (Jan 1994): 81-96.  Also, "Solzhenitsyn Back in the U.S.S.R.: Anti-Modernism in Contemporary Soviet Prose,” ''Berkshire Review'', 16 (1981): 64-78&lt;/ref&gt;  The opening paragraph below is a good example of Rasputin's writing style (exceptional even for the village prose writers), and the novel's theme of natural cycles disrupted by modernization:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Once more spring had come, one more in the never-ending cycle, but for Matyora this spring would be the last, the last for both the island and the village that bore the same name.  Once more, rumbling passionately, the ice broke, piling up mounds on the banks, and the liberated Angara River opened up, stretching out into a mighty, sparkling flow.  Once more the water gushed boisterously at the island’s upper tip, before cascading down both channels of the riverbed; once more greenery flared on the ground and in the greens, the first rains soaked the earth, the swifts and swallows flew back, and at dusk in the bogs the awakened frogs croaked their love of life.  It had all happened many times before.'' (From Rasputin's novel ''Farewell to Matyora'', translated by [[Antonina W. Bouis]], 1979)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rasputin's nonfiction works contain similar themes, often in support of relevant political causes.  He directed particularly trenchant criticism at large-scale [[dam]] building, like the project that flooded his own hometown, and [[water transportation|water management]] projects, like the diversion of the Siberian rivers to Central Asia.  He argued that these projects were destructive not simply in an ecological sense, but in a moral sense as well.&lt;ref&gt;“Argument in a Controversy: Cause for Alarm,” Sovietskaya Rossiya, Jan 3 1986, Current Digest of the Soviet Press: VolXXXVIIII, No. 1 (Feb 3 1986)&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Siberia, Siberia]]'' (first published in 1991), Rasputin compares what he considers modern [[moral relativism]] with the traditional beliefs of the people of [[Russkoye Ustye]], who believed in [[reincarnation]]. According to Rasputin, when burying their dead, the Russkoye Ustye settlers would often bore a hole in the [[coffin]], to make it easier for the soul to come back to be reborn; but if the deceased was a bad person, they would drive an [[aspen]] stake through the grave, to keep his soul from ever coming back into the world of living again. The writer is not ambiguous as to which category the souls of the "modernizers" should belong:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''When reflecting on the actions of today's "[[Northern river reversal|river-rerouting]]" father figures, who are destroying our sacred national treasures up hill and down with the haste of an invading army, you involuntarily turn to this experience: it would not be a bad idea for them to know that not everything is forgiven at the time of death.''&lt;ref&gt;Valentin Rasputin. "Siberia, Siberia". 
Translated by Margaret Winchell, Gerald Mikkelson. Northwestern University Press, 1996. {{ISBN|0-8101-1575-1}}. Page 330.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some critics accused Rasputin of idealizing village life and slipping into anti-modern polemics. The journal ''Voprosy literatury'' published an ongoing debate on the question, "Is the Village Prose of Valentin Rasputin Anti-Modern?"&lt;ref name=CDSP&gt;''Voprosy literatury'': “Is Rasputin’s Rural Prose Antimodern?”/Current Digest of the Soviet Press vol XXIX, no. 24 (pp 14-15, 24): 1972&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political views ==
By the end of [[perestroika]] Rasputin became publicly active. He criticized [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s reforms from patriotic and [[Russian nationalism|nationalistic]] positions. His repetition (at the 1st [[Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union]]) of [[Pyotr Stolypin|Stolypin]]'s statement "You need great upheavals. We need a great country" («Вам нужны великие потрясения. Нам нужна великая страна») made it a phrase commonly used by the antiliberal opposition.

He also signed several open letters, most notably the "Letter of Russian Writers" (also known as the "[[:ru:Письмо семидесяти четырёх|Letter of Seventy Four]]") addressed to the [[President of the Soviet Union|President]] and the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union]] and published in the ''[[Literary Newspaper]]'' and ''[[Nash Sovremennik]]'' in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;''[[:ru:Прохорова, Ирина Дмитриевна|Irina Prokhorova]], Arch Tait (2013)''. [https://books.google.ru/books?id=yLpgBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP96 1990: Russians Remember a Turning Point]. — London: [[Quercus (publisher)|Quercus Publishing]], [[Mikhail Prokhorov Foundation]], p. 96 {{ISBN|978-0-85705-200-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://zavtra.ru/blogs/1998-11-1731 About Russophobia] full text at the ''[[:ru:Завтра (газета)|Zavtra]]'' newspaper No 46(259), November 17, 1998 (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt; 74 writers expressed concern regarding the rose of [[Russophobia]] in mass media and "fabrication of the "Russian fascism" myth while the [[Zionist]] ideology is getting quick rehabilitation and idealization". The letter was criticized by opponents who labeled the signers as "antisemits"; many of them later signed what is considered their answer — the "[[Letter of Forty-Two]]". Rasputin himself argued that his alleged antisemitic statements have been exaggerated and taken out of context.&lt;ref name=Rich&gt;Elisabeth Rich, Laura Weeks (trans.), "Valentin Rasputin": ''South Central Review''  Vol. 12, No. 3/4, Russian Literature after Perestroika (Autumn, 1995): pp. 45-69.&lt;/ref&gt; In July, 1991, Rasputin along with 11 other public and political figures signed another open letter "[[A Word to the People]]".

In 1992, Valentin Rasputin joined the [[National Salvation Front (Russia)|National Salvation Front]] (a coalition of radical opposition forces), nominally belonging to its leadership. He later supported the [[Communist Party of Russian Federation|CPRF]] and its leader, [[Gennady Zyuganov]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kprf.ru/rus_soc/51920.html|title=Писатель Валентин Распутин: Для того, чтобы Россия поднялась на ноги нужен такой человек, как Зюганов!|accessdate=2013-02-18|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6EismmdfH?url=http://kprf.ru/rus_soc/51920.html|archivedate=2013-02-26|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''WordSmith Tools''' is a software package primarily for linguists, in particular for work in the field of [[corpus linguistics]].  It is a collection of modules for searching patterns in a language.  The software handles many languages.

==Development and acquisition==
The program suite was developed by the British linguist Mike Scott at the [[University of Liverpool]] and released as version 1.0 in 1996.  It was based on MicroConcord co-developed by Mike Scott and Tim Johns, published by Oxford University Press in 1993.  Versions 1.0 through 4.0 were sold exclusively by [[Oxford University Press]], the current version 7.0 and previous versions are now also distributed by Lexical Analysis Software Limited.  The software runs under Windows.  WordSmith is a download-only product which is registered by entering a code costing 50 pounds sterling for a single user license. However, WordSmith 4.0 can now be downloaded and used free.

==Functionality and applications==
The core areas of the software package includes three modules:
* '' Concord'' is used to create concordances, so all the hits from a search within a previously defined [[body text]].
* ''WordList'' lists all the [[Word]]s or on [[word form]]s that are included in the selected corpus and statistical data are different from the text corpus.
* ''KeyWord'' creates a list of all those words and word forms according to certain statistical criteria in the text corpus [[significance of statistics|significantly]] occur rarely or frequently.

Each of the modules offers a number of other features in relation to the text corpus or text being analysed.  Thus, for example, [[collocation]] and dispersion plots are computed with a concordance search.  In addition, there are a number of additional modules that are useful for the preparation, clean-up and format the text corpus.  WordSmith Tools can be used  in 80 different languages.  WordSmith Tools is - along with several other software products similar in nature - an internationally popular program for the work based on corpus-linguistic methodology.  It is used by investigators in assorted fields as can be seen in the list below of works using the software.
