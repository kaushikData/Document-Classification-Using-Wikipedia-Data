'''''A History of British Birds''''' is a [[natural history]] book by [[Thomas Bewick]], published in two volumes. Volume 1, "Land Birds", appeared in 1797. Volume 2, "Water Birds", appeared in 1804. A supplement was published in 1821. The text in "Land Birds" was written by [[Ralph Beilby]], while Bewick took over the text for the second volume. The book is admired mainly for the beauty and clarity of Bewick's [[wood engraving]]s, which are widely considered his finest work, and among the finest in that medium.

''British Birds'' has been compared to works of poetry and literature. It plays a recurring role in [[Charlotte Brontë]]'s novel ''[[Jane Eyre]]''. [[William Wordsworth]] praised Bewick in the first lines of his poem "The Two Thieves": "Oh now that the genius of Bewick were mine, And the skill which he learned on the banks of the Tyne."

The book was effectively the first "[[field guide]]" for non-specialists. Bewick provides an accurate illustration of each species, from life if possible, or from skins. The common and scientific name(s) are listed, citing the naming authorities. The bird is described, with its distribution and behaviour, often with extensive quotations from printed sources or correspondents. Those who provided skins or information are acknowledged. The species are grouped into families such as "Of the Falcon", using the limited and conflicting scientific sources of the time. The families of land birds are further grouped into birds of prey, omnivorous birds, insectivorous birds, and granivorous birds, while the families of water birds are simply listed, with related families side by side.

Each species entry begins on a new page; any spaces at the ends of entries are filled with tail-pieces, small, often humorous woodcuts of country life. ''British Birds'' remains in print, and has attracted the attention of authors such as [[Jenny Uglow]]. Critics note Bewick's skill as a [[naturalist]] as well as an engraver.

==Approach==

[[File:Foot of the Red-necked Grebe woodcut in Bewick British Birds 1797.jpg|thumb|221px|"Foot of the [[Red-necked grebe|Red-necked Grebe]]"]]

The preface states that "while one of the editors {{bracket|[[Thomas Bewick]]}} of this work was engaged in preparing the cuts, which are faithfully drawn from Nature, and [[Wood engraving|engraved upon wood]], the compilation of the descriptions .. ''(of the Land Birds)'' was undertaken by the other {{bracket|[[Ralph Beilby]]}},&lt;ref name=Tattersfield/&gt; subject, however, to the corrections of his friend, whose habits had led him to a more intimate acquaintance with this branch of [[Natural History]]", and goes on to mention that the compilation of text was the "production of those hours which could be spared from a laborious employment", namely the long hours of work engraving the minutely detailed wood printing blocks.{{efn|Bewick had a "strained" relationship with Beilby, who was first his tutor, then from 1777 his business partner. They produced ''A General History of Quadrupeds'' together in 1790, but after ''Land Birds'' in 1797 and "a period of dissatisfaction" they separated.&lt;ref name=NewcastleAbout&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www2.newcastle.gov.uk/newcastlecollection/bewick-collection/about-thomas-bewick | title=The Bewick Collection: About Thomas Bewick | publisher=Newcastle Collection | accessdate=21 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} What the preface does not say is the reason for this statement about the "editors", which was an angry stand-off between Bewick and Beilby, caused by Beilby's intention to have an introduction which merely thanked Bewick for his "assistance", and a title page naming Beilby as the sole author. Bewick's friend (and his wife's godfather) Thomas Hornby heard of this, and informed Bewick. An informal trade panel met to judge the matter, and the preface was the result; and Beilby's name did not appear on the title page.&lt;ref&gt;Uglow, 2006. pp. 259–261.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each species of bird is presented in a few pages (generally between two and four; occasionally, as with the [[mallard]] or "Common Wild Duck", a few more). First is a woodcut of the bird, always either perched or standing on the ground, even in the case of water birds – such as the [[smew]] – that (as winter visitors) do not nest in Britain, and consequently are rarely seen away from water there.&lt;ref name=CollinsBird&gt;{{cite book | title=Collins Bird Guide | edition=2nd | publisher=Collins | others=Svensson, Lars (text, maps); Mullarney, Killian and Zetterström, Dan (plates, captions) | author=Grant, Peter J. | year=2009 | page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bewick then presents the name, with variations, and the Latin and French equivalents. For example, "The [[Musk duck|Musk Duck]]" is also named on the line below as "Cairo, Guinea, or Indian Duck", and the next line "(''[[Anas moschata]]'', Linn.—''Le Canard Musque'', Buff.)" provides the scholarly references to the giving of the Latin [[binomial nomenclature|binomial]] by [[Linnaeus|Linn[aeus]]] and a French description by [[Comte de Buffon|Buff[on]]].&lt;ref name=Bewick&gt;Bewick, 1797–1804.&lt;/ref&gt;

The text begins by stating the size of the bird. Bewick then describes the bird, typically in one paragraph, naming any notable features such as the colour of the eyes ("[[Iris (anatomy)|irides]]"), the bill, the legs, and plumage on each part of the body. Next, the origin and distribution of the species are discussed, with notes or quotations from authorities such as [[John Ray]], [[Gilbert White]] and Buffon.

Bewick then mentions any other facts of interest about the bird; in the case of the musk duck, this concerns its "musky smell, which arises from the liquor secreted in the glands on the rump". If the bird hybridizes with other species, this is described, along with whether the hybrids are fertile ("productive").

[[File:Sabine's Snipe woodcut Bewick's British Birds 1847.jpg|thumb|left|220px|"Sabine's Snipe", added to later editions, was described by [[Nicholas Aylward Vigors|Vigors]] in 1825.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1095-8339.1823.tb00102.x/abstract | title=XXVI.

Finally, Bewick acknowledges anyone who helped. The musk duck is stated to have been drawn from a "living specimen" which was however "excepting the head, entirely white", unlike the "general appearance" shown in the woodcut; the bird "was lent to this work by [[William Losh]], Esq., of Point Pleasant, near Newcastle". Losh, one of Bewick's many collaborators, was a wealthy partner in [[Losh, Wilson and Bell]], manufacturers of chemicals and iron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.asaplive.com/local--family-history/low-fell---additional-pages/low-fell-history-part-1 | title=Low Fell&amp;nbsp;– Additional Pages | publisher=Gateshead Libraries | work=Low Fell History: Part 1 | year=2011 | accessdate=21 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the birds, especially the rarer species, were necessarily illustrated from skins rather than from life. For example, for the Sabine's snipe, "The author was favoured by [[Nicholas Aylward Vigors|N. A. Vigors]], Esq., [who had described the supposed species] with a preserved specimen, from which the above figure is taken."{{efn|The "Sabine's snipe" species described by Vigors was treated as a common snipe by Barrett-Hamilton in 1895&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=25584879 | title=Sabine's Snipe. ''Gallinago Coelestis'', var. ''Sabinii'' | author=Barrett-Hamilton, GEH | journal=The Irish Naturalist |date=January 1895 | volume=4 | issue=1 | pages=12–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by Meinertzhagen in 1926, but was thought to be probably a [[Wilson's snipe]] in 1945. The skin that Bewick worked from was presumably Vigors' type specimen; it was much darker than a typical common snipe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/wilson/v057n01/p0075-p0076.pdf | title=General Notes | journal=The Wilson Bulletin |date=March 1945 | volume=57 | issue=1 | pages=75–76}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} In ''A Memoir'' (posthumously published in 1862), Bewick states that he intended to "stick to nature as closely as I could", but admits that he had "in several cases" to rely on the stuffed "preserved skins" of his neighbour Richard Routledge Wingate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=A Memoir | publisher=Oxford University Press | author=Bewick, Thomas | year=1979 | orig-year = 1862}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://eprints.worc.ac.uk/315/1/Debbie_Sly_-_With_skirmish_and_capricious_passagings.pdf | title='With skirmish and capricious passagings': ornithological and poetic discourse in the nightingale poems of Coleridge and Clare | publisher=University of Worcester | year=2005 | accessdate=14 January 2013 | author=Sly, Debbie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The grouping of species gave Bewick difficulty,&lt;ref&gt;Uglow, 2006. p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt; as the scientific sources of the time did not agree on how to arrange the species in families, or on a sequence or grouping of those families. Bewick for example uses family groups like "Of the Falcon", in which he includes [[buzzards]] and [[sparrowhawk]]s as well as what are now called [[falcon]]s. The families of land birds are further grouped into birds of prey, omnivorous birds, insectivorous birds, and granivorous birds, while the families of water birds are simply listed, with what seemed to be related families, such as "Of the Anas" (ducks) and "Of the Mergus" (sawbill ducks), side by side.

In this way the book takes the form of, and sets a precedent for, modern field guides.&lt;ref name=CollinsBird/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/3622244/A-bird-in-the-bush-is-always-best.html# | newspaper=The Daily Telegraph | title=A bird in the bush is always best | date=15 August 2004 | accessdate=14 January 2013 | author=Bate, Jonathan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the French naturalist [[:fr:François Holandre|François Holandre]] (1753–1830) assembled a field guide using Bewick's woodcuts as early as 1800.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.trincoll.edu/TrinityToday/Documents/Field%20Guide%20pamphle.pdf | title=Searching the Skies, Searching the Stacks: Bird Field Guides in the Watkinson Library | publisher=Trinity College, Hartford, Connecticut | work=2011 | accessdate=13 January 2013 | author=Jordan, Mary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each account is closed with a miniature woodcut known from its position in the text as a tail-piece.&lt;ref name=GuardianUglow/&gt; These small artworks depict aspects of country life, often with humorous subjects, but all with Bewick's eye for detail, style, and precision.&lt;ref name=Tate/&gt; Some add to the illustration of the bird in question, as for example the heron, where the tail-piece shows one heron catching an eel, and another flying away. The tail-piece for Sabine's snipe, a [[gamebird]], shows a hunter firing, and a small bird falling to the ground. There is no exclusion of human life from the images: one tail-piece depicts a works complete with smoking chimney beside a river.{{efn|Bewick made dozens of woodcuts for coal certificates for collieries near Newcastle, in what is now Tyne and Wear. These depict buildings such as the Custom House with its smoking chimneys,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.newcastle.gov.uk/collections.nsf/display?readform&amp;id=08A7804CEDF69AE180257433004EEAB5 |title=The Bewick Collection (Pease Bequest): Coal certificates - Tyne |publisher=Newcastle Collection |accessdate=21 January 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611014834/http://www.newcastle.gov.uk/collections.nsf/display?readform&amp;id=08A7804CEDF69AE180257433004EEAB5 |archivedate=11 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and one woodcut is boldly headed 'NEWCASTLE'.&lt;ref name=NewcastleAbout/&gt;}}

===Land birds===
[[File:Hanging Washing with Pigs and Chickens tail-piece in Bewick British Birds 1797.jpg|thumb|220px|Hanging washing with pigs and chickens: an uncaptioned tail-piece in Volume 1: ''Land Birds''. Like many others, this has a humorous touch, with a bird leaving muddy footprints on a newly laundered shirt.]]

The first volume "containing the History and Description of Land Birds" begins with a preface, an introduction, and a list of technical terms illustrated with Bewick's woodcuts. The introduction begins:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In no part of the animal creation are the wisdom, the goodness, and the bounty of Providence displayed in a more lively manner than in the structure, formation, and various endowments of the feathered tribes.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The birds are divided into [[Seed predation|granivorous]] (grain eating) and [[carnivorous]] groups, which are explained in some detail. The speed, senses, flight, [[Bird migration|migration]], pairing behaviour and feeding of birds are then discussed, with observations from [[Spallanzani]] and [[Gilbert White]], whose ''[[Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne]]'' was published in 1789. The pleasure of watching birds is mentioned:

&lt;blockquote&gt;To the practical ornithologist there arises a considerable gratification in being able to ascertain the [[Jizz (birding)|distinguishing characters of birds]] as they appear at a distance, whether at rest, or during their flight; for not only every [[genus]] has something peculiar to itself, but each species has its own appropriate marks, by which a judicious observer may discriminate almost with certainty.&lt;ref&gt;Bewick, volume 1, ''Land Birds'', 1847 edition. "Introduction".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Great Bustard woodcut in Bewick British Birds 1797.jpg|thumb|left|Woodcut of "The [[Great bustard|Great Bustard]]". A horseman and pair of greyhounds gallop after another bustard in the background.]]
Bewick also mentions [[Nature conservation|conservation]], in the context of the probable local extinction of a valuable resource:

"Both this and the [[Great bustard|Great Bustard]] are excellent eating, and would well repay the trouble of [[domestication]]; indeed, it seems surprising, that we should suffer these fine birds to be in danger of total extinction,{{efn|Bewick's prediction was correct. The great bustard became extinct in Britain in the 1830s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/nature-online/species-of-the-day/biodiversity/endangered-species/otis-tarda/index.html | author=Cooper, Joanne | title=Otis tarda (great bustard) | publisher=Natural History Museum | year=2013 | accessdate=21 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} although, if properly cultivated, they might afford as excellent a repast as our own domestic poultry, or even as the [[Domestic turkey|Turkey]], for which we are indebted to distant countries.&lt;ref&gt;Bewick, volume 1, ''Land Birds'', 2nd edition, 1847. "Little Bustard".&lt;/ref&gt;"

The 1847 edition, revised with additional woodcuts and descriptions, is organized as follows, with the species grouped into [[family (biology)|families]] such as the shrikes:
{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|style=font-size:smaller|

The second volume "containing the History and Description of Water Birds" begins with its own preface, and its own introduction. Bewick discusses the question of where many seabirds go to breed, revisits the subject of migration, and concludes with reflections on "an all-wise Providence" as shown in Nature.

The 'foreign birds' are not grouped but just listed directly as species, from Bearded Vulture to Mino. Fifteen birds are included, with no description, and despite their placement in the table of contents, they appear at the front of the volume as an 'Appendix'.

==Reception==

[[File:The Sparrowhawk woodcut in Bewick British Birds 1797.jpg|thumb|220px|"The [[Eurasian sparrowhawk|Sparrow-Hawk]]" shows textures Bewick achieved with [[Burin (engraving)|engraving tools]] on the end-grain of hard [[Buxus sempervirens|boxwood]].]]

In 1805, the ''[[British Critic]]'' wrote that it was "superfluous to expatiate much on the merits of a work" that everyone liked because of "the aptness of its descriptions, the accuracy of its figures, the spirit of its wood engravings, and the ingenious variety of its vignettes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=A History of British Birds by Thomas Bewick | author=Anon | journal=British Critic | year=1805 | volume=26 | pages=292–297}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1829 ''Magazine of Natural History'' commented that "[[George Montagu (naturalist)|Montagu]]'s ''[[Ornithological Dictionary; or Alphabetical Synopsis of British Birds|Ornithological Dictionary]]'' and Bewick's ''Birds'' .. have rendered [the] department of natural history popular throughout the land".&lt;ref name="LoudonCharlesworth1829"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Loudon |first1=John Claudius |last2=Charlesworth |first2=Edward |last3=Denson |first3=John |title=Magazine of natural history |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MFVIAAAAMAAJ |year=1829 |publisher=printed for Longman, Rees, Orme, Brown, and Green |pages=360–364}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Ibis (journal)|Ibis]]'', reviewing the ''Memoir of Thomas Bewick, written by himself'' in 1862, compares the effect of Bewick and Gilbert White, writing "It was the pages of Gilbert White and the woodcuts of Bewick which first beguiled the English schoolboy to the observation of our feathered friends", and "how few of our living [[Natural history|naturalists]] but must gratefully acknowledge their early debt to White's 'History' and to the life-like woodcuts of Bewick!" The reviewer judges that "Probably we shall not wrong the cultivated [[The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne|annalist of Selborne]] by giving the first place to Bewick." However, comparing them as people, "Bewick has not the slightest claim to rank with Gilbert White as a naturalist. White was what Bewick never was, a man of science; but, if no naturalist, Bewick was a lover of nature, a careful observer, and a faithful copier of her ever-varying forms. In this, and in this alone, lies his charm."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1474-919X.1862.tb07513.x/abstract | title=Review of the recently published Memoir of Bewick | author=Anon | journal=Ibis |date=October 1862 | volume=4 | issue=4 | pages=368–378 | doi=10.1111/j.1474-919X.1862.tb07513.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[1911 Encyclopædia Britannica]]''{{'}}s entry on Thomas Bewick describes "the ''British Birds''" as "his great achievement, that with which his name is inseparably associated", observing that "Bewick, from his intimate knowledge of the habits of animals acquired during his constant excursions into the country, was thoroughly qualified to do justice to this great task."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Bewick, Thomas |volume=3 |page=837}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[British Birds (magazine)|British Birds]]'', reviewing a "lavishly illustrated" [[British Library]] book on Bewick, writes that "No [[ornithologist]] will ever regard Thomas Bewick, known primarily for The History of British Birds (1797–1804), as a naturalist of the same standing as contemporaries such as [[Edward Donovan]], [[John Latham (ornithologist)|John Latham]] and [[James Bolton]]", noting however that Bewick helped to define "a certain English Romantic sensibility". More directly, the review notes that "Bewick was aware that his role was to offer a modest guide to birds that the common man not only could afford but would also want to possess." Bewick was not "a scientist, but he was a perfectionist". The book's text was written by "failed author" Ralph Beilby, but the text is "almost extraneous" given Bewick's masterpiece.&lt;ref name=Tattersfield&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.britishbirds.co.uk/book-reviews/thomas-bewick-the-complete-illustrative-work-by-nigel-tattersfield | title=Thomas Bewick: the complete illustrative work, by Nigel Tattersfield | publisher=British Birds | date=9 April 2012 | accessdate=12 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Tate Gallery]] writes that Bewick's " best illustrations&amp;nbsp;... are in his natural history books. The History of British Birds (2 vols, Newcastle upon Tyne, 1797–1804) reveals Bewick's gifts as a naturalist as well as an engraver (the artist was responsible for the text as well as the illustrations in the second volume)." The article notes that the book makes  "extensive use of narrative tailpieces: vignettes in which manifold aspects of north-country life are expressed with affection, humour and a genuine love of nature. In later years these miniature scenes came to be more highly regarded than the figures they accompany."&lt;ref name=Tate&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/thomas-bewick-35 | title=Thomas Bewick 1753–1828 | publisher=Tate Gallery | accessdate=12 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dissenting from the general tone of praise for Bewick, Jacob Kainen cites claims that "many of the best tailpieces in the ''History of British birds'' were drawn by Robert Johnson", and that "the greater number of those contained in the second volume were engraved by [[Luke Clennell|Clennell]]. Granted that the outlook and the engraving style were Bewick's, and that these were notable contributions, the fact that the results were so close to his own points more to an effective method of illustration than to the outpourings of genius." Kainen argues that while competent, Bewick "was no [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Holbein]], no [[Botticelli]]—it is absurd to think of him in such terms—but he did develop a fresh method of handling wood engraving."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/29928/29928-h/29928-h.htm | title=Why Bewick Succeeded: A Note in the History of Wood Engraving | author=Kainen, Jacob | journal=Smithsonian Institution United States National Museum Bulletin | year=1959 | volume=218 | pages=185–201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Linnean Society]] writes that the ''History'' "shows that he was also an excellent naturalist, a meticulous observer of birds and animals in their habitats."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.linnean.org/Meetings-and-Events/Past+Events/Thomas+Bewick+Engraver+and+Naturalist | title=Thomas Bewick, Engraver and Naturalist | publisher=Linnean Society | accessdate=12 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[University of Maryland]] writes that "The ''Birds'' is specific to those species indigenous to Britain and is incredibly accurate due to Bewick's personal knowledge of the habits of birds in the wild acquired during his frequent bird-watching expeditions." It adds that "Bewick's woodcarvings are considered a pinnacle example of the medium."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://lib.guides.umd.edu/bewick | title=Thomas Bewick | publisher=University of Maryland | accessdate=12 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jenny Uglow]], writing in ''[[The Guardian]]'', notes that "An added delight was the way he filled the blank spaces with 'tail-pieces', tiny, witty, vivid scenes of ordinary life." She describes the importance of ''Birds'' in ''Jane Eyre'', and ends "He worked with precision and insight, in a way that we associate with poets such as [[John Clare|Clare]] and [[William Wordsworth|Wordsworth]], [[Gerard Manley Hopkins]] and [[Elizabeth Bishop]]. To Bewick, nature was the source of joy, challenge and perpetual consolation. In his woodcuts of birds and animals as well as his brilliant tail-pieces, we can still feel this today."&lt;ref name=GuardianUglow&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2006/oct/14/art.biography| title=The Guardian | work=Small wonders | date=14 October 2006 | accessdate=12 January 2013 | author=Uglow, Jenny}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in her biography of Bewick, she adds that "The country might be beautiful but it also stank: in his vignettes men relieve themselves in hedges and ruins, a woman holds her nose as she walks between the cowpats, and a farmyard privy shows that men are as filthy as the pigs they despise."&lt;ref&gt;Uglow, 2006. p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hilary Spurling, reviewing Uglow's biography of Bewick in ''[[The Observer]]'', writes that when ''Birds'' appeared, people all over Britain "became his pupils". Spurling cites [[Charles Kingsley]]'s story of his father's hunting friends from the [[New Forest]] mocking him for buying "a book 'about dicky-birds", until, astonished, they saw the book and discovered "things they had known all their lives and never even noticed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/sep/24/biography.features | title=The Observer | work=All about the birds and the bees | date=24 September 2006 | accessdate=13 January 2013 | author=Spurling, Hilary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Brewer, writing in the ''[[London Review of Books]]'', says that for his ''Birds'', "Bewick had acquired national renown as the artist who most truthfully depicted the flora and fauna of the British countryside."  He adds that "Bewick's achievement was both technical and aesthetic." In his view, Bewick "reconciled nature, science and art.  His engravings of British birds, which represent his work at its finest, are almost all rendered with the precision of the ornithologist: but they also portray the animals in their natural habitat&amp;nbsp;– the [[grouse]] shelters in his covert, the [[European green woodpecker|green woodpecker]] perches on a gnarled branch, waders strut by streams&amp;nbsp;..." He observes that "Most of the best engravings include a figure, incident or building which draws the viewer's eye beyond and behind the animal profile in the foreground. Thus the ploughboy in the distant field pulls our gaze past the [[western yellow wagtail|yellow wagtail]]&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v04/n05/john-brewer/progressive-agenda | title=Progressive Agenda | author=Brewer, John | journal=London Review of Books | date=18 March 1982 | volume=4 | issue=5 | pages=18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''History'' is repeatedly mentioned in [[Charlotte Brontë]]'s 1847 novel ''[[Jane Eyre]]''. John Reed throws the ''History of British Birds'' at Jane when she is ten; Jane uses the book as a place to which to escape, away from the painful Reed household; and Jane also bases her artwork on Bewick's illustrations.

&lt;blockquote&gt;I returned to my book--Bewick's History of British Birds: the letterpress thereof I cared little for, generally speaking; and yet there were certain introductory pages that, child as I was, I could not pass quite as a blank.

[[Peter Hall (theatre director)|Peter Hall]]'s 1974 film ''[[Akenfield]]'' (from the 1969 book by [[Ronald Blythe]]) contains a scene where the grandfather as a young man is reaping a cornfield. He weeps when he accidentally crushes a bird's egg, an image derived from Bewick's tail-piece woodcut for the partridge. The woodcut shows a reaper with a scythe, a dead bird and its nest of a dozen eggs on the ground under the scythe, which has just lifted. [[George Ewart Evans]] used the image on the title page of his 1956 book about [[Blaxhall]] (near [[Charsfield]], on which 'Akenfield' is probably partly based).

{{Annotated image/Arthropod head problem}}
The '''arthropod head problem''' is a long-standing [[zoological]] dispute concerning the [[Segmentation (biology)|segmental]] composition of the [[head]]s of the various [[arthropod]] groups, and how they are evolutionarily related to each other. While the dispute has historically centered on the exact make-up of the [[insect]] head, it has been widened to include other living arthropods such as the [[crustacean]]s and [[chelicerate]]s; and fossil forms, such as the many arthropods known from exceptionally preserved Cambrian faunas. While the topic has classically been based on insect [[embryology]], in recent years a great deal of [[Evolutionary developmental biology|developmental molecular]] data has become available. Dozens of more or less distinct solutions to the problem, dating back to at least 1897,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Goodrich | first = E. S. | title = On the Relation of the Arthropod Head to the Annelid Prostomium | journal = Quarterly Journal of Microscopical Science | issue = s2–40 | pages = 247–268 | year = 1897}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been published, including several in the 2000s.

The arthropod head problem is popularly known as the '''endless dispute''', the title of a famous paper on the subject by Jacob G. Rempel in 1975,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Rempel | first = J. G. | title = The Evolution of the Insect Head: the Endless Dispute
|journal = Quaestiones Entomologicae | volume = 11 | pages = 7–25 | year = 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; referring to its seemingly intractable nature. Although some progress has been made since that time, the precise nature of especially the [[Labrum (arthropod mouthpart)|labrum]] and the pre-oral region of arthropods remain highly controversial.

==Background==
{{Quote_box|width=25%|align=right|quote=&lt;div style="text-align:left;"&gt;It would be too bad if the question of head segmentation ever should be finally settled; it has been for so long such fertile ground for theorizing that arthropodists would miss it as a field for mental exercise.&lt;/div&gt;|source=R.E. Snodgrass, 1960&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Snodgrass | first = R. E. | title = Facts and Theories Concerning the Insect Head | journal = Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections | volume = 142 | pages = 1–61 | year = 1960
}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
According to recent research, it has been suggested that some key events in the evolution of the arthropod body resulted from changes in certain [[Hox gene]]s' DNA sequences. The [[torso|trunks]] of arthropods are built out of repeated [[segmentation (biology)|segments]], which are typically associated with various structures such as a pair of [[appendages]], [[exoskeleton#Organisation|apodemes]] for muscle attachment, [[ganglia]] and, at least embryologically, [[coelom|coelomic cavities]]. While many arthropod segments are modified to a greater or lesser extent (for example, only three of the insect thorax and abdominal segments typically bear appendages), it is widely assumed that the ancestral state was for all of the segments to be nearly identical. However, while the segmental organisation of the trunks of adult arthropods can be usually readily seen, that of the head is much less obvious. Arthropod heads are typically fused capsules that bear a variety of complex structures such as the eyes, antennae and mouth parts. The challenge that the arthropod head problem has to address is to what extent the various structures of the arthropod head can be resolved into a set of hypothetical ancestral segments. Given the high compaction and complexity of adult arthropod heads, much attention has been directed towards understanding the developmental processes that give rise to them, in the hope that they will reveal their segmental organisation more clearly.

==Head components==
[[Image:Evolution insect mouthparts.png|right|upright=1.4|thumb|Insect head parts. Legend: '''a''', antennae; '''c''', compound eye; '''lb''', labium; '''lr''', labrum; '''md''', mandibles; '''mx''', maxillae.]]
[[Image:robal.png|right|upright=1.4|thumb|Insect anatomy]]
A typical [[insect]] head possesses a pair of [[antenna (biology)|antennae]]; [[Compound eye|eyes]]; [[Mandible (arthropod)|mandibles]], [[Labrum (arthropod mouthpart)|labrum]], [[maxilla (arthropod)|maxillae]] and [[Labium (insect)|labium]] (the latter four forming the cluster of "mouth parts", no. 32. in the diagram). Lying above the oesophagus is the brain or [[supraesophageal ganglion]], divided into three pairs of ganglia: the protocerebrum, deutocerebrum and tritocerebrum from front to back (collectively no. 5 in the diagram). Nerves from the protocerebrum lead to the large compound eyes; from the deutocerebrum to the antennae; and  from the tritocerebrum to the [[Labrum (arthropod mouthpart)|labrum]] and [[stomatogastric nervous system]]. Circum-oesophageal connectives lead from the tritocerebrum around the gut to connect the brain to the ventral ganglionated nerve cord: nerves from the first three pairs of ganglia lead to the mandibles, maxillae and labium, respectively. The position of the mouth and the circum-oesophageal connectives allows a distinction to be made between pre- and post-oral structures; although it should be borne in mind that because structures can move around during development, a pre-oral position of a structure in the adult does not necessarily prove that its developmental origin is from there. The [[myriapod]] head is very similar to that of the insects.

The [[crustacean]] head is broadly similar to that of the insects, but possesses, in addition, a second pair of antennae that are innervated from the tritocerebrum. In place of the labium, crustaceans possess a second pair of maxillae.

[[Chelicerate]] head structures differ considerably from those of mandibulates (i.e. insects, crustaceans and myriapods); they possess eyes and a single pair of grasping appendages innervated from the brain, plus a labrum-like structure. Behind the mouth lies another pair of mouthparts, the [[pedipalps]], and behind them lie the series of walking limbs. In chelicerates, the leg-bearing segments are fused with the anterior segments to form a [[prosoma]], so that in living arthropods a distinct head only exists in mandibulates.

==The acron concept==
The arthropod head problem has until recently been predicated on the [[Articulata Hypothesis|Articulata]] theory, i.e. that the arthropods and [[annelids]] are close relatives. Although arthropods are essentially direct developers that do not possess a [[trochophore]]-like [[larva]], the annelids do. During annelid [[metamorphosis]], segments are added close to the posterior of the body, behind the mouth; whereas the brain is derived from the [[trochophore|episphere]] or region in front of the mouth. Recognition of this led to the concept of a primary, non-segmental component of the body in annelids known as the [[Prostomium|acron]] being developed, from which the brain is ultimately derived. Because the arthropod and annelid heads, in the light of the Articulata theory, were assumed to be structurally homologous in some way, the arthropod head was also often considered to incorporate a non-segmental acronal component. Taking the homology between annelid and arthropod heads at face value, Swedish workers such as Hanström&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Hanström | first = B. | title = Vergleichende Anatomie Des Nervensystems Der Wirbellosen Tiere Unter Berücksichtigung Seiner Funktion | journal = Berlin, Heidelberg and New York: Julius Springer | pages = 1–623 | year = 1928 | bibcode = 1929Natur.124..368. | volume = 124 | doi = 10.1038/124368a0 | issue = 3123}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Holmgren&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Holmgren | first = N. | title = Zur Vergleichenden Anatomie Des Gehirns Von Polychaeten, Onychophoren, Xiphosuren, Arachniden, Crustaceen, Myriapoden Und Insekten | journal = Kungliga Svenska Vetenskapsakademiens Handlingar | volume = 56 | pages = 1–315 | year = 1916}}&lt;/ref&gt; assumed that a large part of the arthropod head must correspond to the acron, a view followed later by several prominent American insect workers such as Butt&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

H. | title = The Role of the Premandibular or Intercalary Segment in Head Segmentation of Insects and Other Arthropods | journal = Transactions of the American Entomological Society | volume = 83 | pages = 1–30 | year = 1957}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Snodgrass. They proposed that all pre-oral structures in insects were non-segmental, although such a view is at odds with the preoral position of apparently ''bona fide'' appendages such as the antennae. A less extreme set of theories propose that only the protocerebrum and associated structures should be considered to be acronal.

The view that the arthropod head must contain an acronal remnant has been shaken by the relatively recent revision of [[protostome]] phylogeny, which has dismantled the Articulata and placed the arthropods together with a group of unsegmented worms often referred to as the [[Cycloneuralia]] in the so-called [[Ecdysozoa]]. All members of the Ecdysozoa are direct developers without a trochophore, and the cycloneuralians have terminal mouths. As a result, the idea of the arthropods having inherited a preoral acron from their ancestors seems less likely.

The study of how [[Evolutionary developmental biology|developmental genes are expressed during embryogenesis]] has become an important new tool in the last twenty years for understanding the structure and evolution of morphology.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| last1 = Angelini | first1 = D.

Because all arthropods have the same complement of nine Hox loci, the morphological diversification observed is caused by [[heterochrony]], meaning that the genes are expressed at different times.

==Areas of agreement==
It is widely agreed that the insect, myriapod and crustacean heads are very similar. The apparent lack of a second antenna in insects and myriapods is explained by the idea that this appendage has been lost, leaving an appendage-less segment known as the intercalary segment. Modern phylogenies do not in general support an insect-myriapod relationship, suggesting that the second antenna has been lost independently in each group, perhaps as a result of a convergent adaptation to life on land. Furthermore, there is general agreement that the mandibles, first maxillae and labium/second maxillae each represent a post-oral segment; and that the first antenna  represents a preoral segment.

==Areas of disagreement==
Areas of disagreement can be grouped into three categories: the nature of the pre-antennal region in mandibulates; the nature of the labrum; and the relationship between the chelicerate and mandibulate anterior segments.

===Nature of the preoral region===
The degree to which the area in front of the mouth is segmented remains one of the major controversies in the arthropod head problem. As already mentioned, earlier workers often considered the entire pre-oral region to be "acronal" and thus nonsegmental. Modern workers universally accept that at least the deuterocerebrum is segmental. However, the nature of the region in front of this is much less certain. Some molecular development studies have given limited support to the idea of an "ocular" segment corresponding to the protocerebrum; but these data are not unequivocal.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| last = Scholtz | first = G.| year = 2001|title = Evolution of Developmental Patterns in Arthropods - the Analysis of Gene Expression And Its Bearing on Morphology and Phylogenetics| journal = Zoology| volume = 103| pages = 99–111}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of the protocerebrum actually comprising two segments has also received support from both molecular and embryological data.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| last1 = Schmidt-ott | first1 = U.

L.| title = Some Recent Advances in Insect Embryology, with a Complete Bibliography of the Subject| journal = Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Bengal, Science| volume = 4| pages = 17–105| year = 1938}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The labrum===
The labrum is a flap-like structure that lies immediately in front of the mouth in almost all extant [[euarthropods]], the general exception being provided by the probable chelicerate-relatives the [[pycnogonids]]. It has proved to be by far the most controversial of all arthropod head structures. It is innervated in crustaceans and insects from the tritocerebrum, i.e. the back of the brain. However, in development it often appears at the anterior of the head, and migrates backwards towards its adult position. Furthermore, it often appears as a bilobed structure, with a set of muscles, nerves and gene expression in many ways similar to that of an appendage.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This evidence has been used to suggest that the labrum is in fact a highly reduced appendage. Its innervation from the rear of the brain has suggested to some workers that, if an appendage, it is the appendage of the tritocerebral segment; a point disputed by others who argue that the presence of a well-developed appendage in at least crustaceans in this segment (i.e., the second antenna, corresponding to the intercalary segment of insects) rules this out. If the labrum is an appendage then, it seems possible that its origin is indicated by its developmentally anterior position, i.e., that it is the appendage of a segment anterior to the first antenna. The most obvious choice for this is the segment whose ganglion is the protocerebrum, which in extant euarthropods bears no appendage (apart from the eyes). If the labrum is really an anterior appendage that has migrated to the posterior, then it may be homologous to the "antennae" of onychophorans, which, as discussed below, seem to be innervated from a very anterior part of the brain, i.e. in front of the eyes. It has even been suggested (e.g., by [[Mithan Lal Roonwal|Roonwal]]) that the labrum belongs to an even more obscure segment that lies in front of the ocular one. Nevertheless, many workers continue to be highly skeptical about the appendiculate nature of the labrum, preferring to see it as it appears, i.e., as an outgrowth of the body wall just in front of the mouth.

===Mandibulate/chelicerate head homologies===
Given the disagreements about the structure of the insect head, on which most effort has been spent, it is no surprise that the potential homologies between it and other arthropods, notably the chelicerates, are also very controversial. From after the second world war to the 1980s a commonly accepted model of arthropod evolution was that the extant euarthropods were [[Polyphyly|polyphyletic]], i.e. the main lineages had evolved independently from soft-bodied, annelid-like ancestors, following the work of Tiegs and especially [[Sidnie Manton]]. In this view, most of the head structures would also be convergent, and thus there was no point looking for specific homologies between major groups. However, the [[monophyletic]] theory of arthropod origins has since decisively gained the upper hand, which raises the problem of head homology once more.

The classical view was that the chelicerae were homologous to the second antennae of crustaceans (i.e., they are innervated from the tritocerebrum), a view based partly on the fact that the chelicerae were innervated from the same ganglion that innervates the labrum, which is the tritocerebrum in crustaceans and insects. Given that there are apparently no appendages in front of the chelicerae, the implication was that the deuterocerebrum had been lost in chelicerates (the protocerebrum innervates the eyes in both groups in this view). While this view still has its defenders (notably Colette and Jacques Bitsch), the alternative view that the chelicerae are innervated from the deuterocerebrum has gained ground, based on molecular development in [[mites]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; If this is the case, then chelicerates simply have no tritocerebrum, i.e. there is no third supraoesophageal ganglion of the brain; the segment corresponding to it would be the suboesophageal pedipalp one. Such a theory does not, however, immediately account for the same ganglionic innervation of the chelicerae and labrum, although one solution is simply to claim that the labrum itself is not homologous between mandibulates and chelicerates (the view, for example, of [[Dieter Waloszek]] and colleagues).

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and shown to possess two unusual features. First, although the mouth is ventral, as is the case in euarthropods, it is innervated from three different places; the sides, the posterior, and by  a nerve that originates dorsally, and passes anteriorly down to curve back to the front of the mouth. This set of innervation makes sense if the mouth of onychophorans was originally terminal and has been bent downwards. Second, the antennae of the onychophorans appear to be innervated from in front of the eyes; which in euarthropod terms implies a protocerebral (or potentially even more anterior) innervation. This is supported by gene expression data, which show that the jaws too are derived from a protocerebral or deuterocerebral segment.&lt;ref name=Eriksson2010&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; As all euarthropod antennae are deuterocerebral or tritocerebral, this implies that the onychophoran antennae are not homologous to any euarthropod ones.

The tritocerebrum in arthropods is homologous to the third head segment in onychophora, which bears the slime glands (a pair of highly modified appendages).&lt;ref name=Eriksson2010/&gt;

==Fossil evidence==

The Cambrian fossil record, above all the various [[lagerstätten]] such as the [[Burgess Shale]], [[Sirius Passet]], [[Chengjiang Fauna|Chengjiang]] and [[Orsten]] faunas, has yielded a very rich record of well-preserved arthropods, including the well-known [[trilobites]].

Many Cambrian arthropods, including the trilobites themselves, possess a single pair of slender antennae, which have been equated with either the first or second antennae of the crustaceans; and either the chelicerae or the missing appendages of the supposedly reduced deuterocerebrum in chelicerates. However, another group of arthropods, the so-called "great appendage" arthropods, including ''[[Yohoia]]'', ''[[Leanchoilia]]'' and ''[[Alalcomenaeus]]'', do not possess simple antennae, but rather have a robust, branched structure, which was called the "great appendage" by [[Harry B. Whittington]] in his restudy of these taxa. Yet another group of arthropods may possess two differentiated head appendages, of which the most important and controversial is the Chengjiang form ''[[Fuxianhuia]]''. ''Fuxianhuia'' was claimed to possess a pair of short antennae anterior, followed by a robust pair of "sub-chelate" appendages. However, this assessment has been both disputed by Waloszek and colleagues, who consider that the sub-chelate appendages are in fact gut [[Diverticulum|diverticulae]]; and supported by [[Graham Budd]]. Thus, its nature remains controversial at present. Other taxa have also been claimed to have a somewhat similar anterior appendage arrangement (e.g. ''[[Fortiforceps]]'') but, with the exception of the well-preserved ''[[Branchiocaris]]'' from the Burgess Shale, most of them are highly equivocal.

In almost all Cambrian arthropods, the post-oral limbs show very little differentiation compared to the trunk limbs; the heads posterior to the mouth shows a considerable degree of variability, however, in the number of segments incorporated into the head.

Trilobites, in particular, possess a ventral sclerotised plate in the head called the [[hypostome (trilobite)|hypostome]]. Whether this is homologous to the labrum or not is debated; although Waloszek and others have argued that as the phosphatocopines (upper stem-group crustaceans) seem to possess both, it cannot be.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

===Theories of Cambrian arthropod head segmentation===

There are at least four main theories to account for anterior head appendages in Cambrian arthropods:

====Scholtz and Edgecombe====

Gerhard Scholtz and Greg Edgecombe&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; accept that the antennae of onychophorans are protocerebral, and call them "primary" antennae to distinguish them from the "secondary" antennae of groups such as the insects and crustaceans. They also accept that taxa such as ''[[Fuxianhuia]]'' possess both antennae and "great appendages". Because in ''Fuxianhuia'' the antennae lie anterior to the great appendages, they suggest that these antennae are the inherited primitive "primary" antennae; and that the great appendages are thus equivalent to the first antennae of crustaceans. Because the secondary antennae are not present in stem group arthropods such as ''[[Fuxianhuia]]'', nor in the extant chelicerates, they propose that arthropods, such as the trilobites, that possess secondary antennae, belong in a monophyletic group that also includes the mandibulates, called the Antennata. The trilobites are thus, in their view, not stem-group chelicerates, a commonly held view, but rather, stem-group mandibulates. The status of the labrum is not resolved by this theory, but they argue that it the evidence for it being appendiculate is not compelling; thus it does not have to correspond to a well-developed appendage of any Cambrian arthropod.

====Budd====

[[Graham Budd]]'s theory&lt;ref&gt;{{citation
 | last = Budd | first = G. E.

 | volume = 417

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; agrees with that of Scholtz and Edgecombe in accepting the protocerebral nature of the onychophoran antennae, and the two preoral appendages of [[Fuxianhuia]]. However, he traces the origin of the "great appendages" in the differentiated frontal appendages of Cambrian lobopods such as ''[[Aysheaia]]'' and ''[[Kerygmachela]]'', neither of which possess convincing antennae. Thus, in Budd's view, the order of the two anterior appendages of taxa such as ''Fuxianhuia'' are reversed: the antennae are the first antennae (deutocerebral) of the mandibulates; and the great appendages correspond to the primary antennae of the onychophorans and Cambrian lobopods. Following previous work by Dewel and colleagues, Budd accounts for their reversal by arguing that the mouth in basal lobopods was terminal, and that as it rotated backwards and downwards, it brought the anterior appendage backwards with it. Given this transformation, it is likely, under this theory, that the remnant of the great appendage/primary antenna is the labrum of extant arthropods. Because in this view ''Fuxianhuia'' possesses both a hypostome and a great appendage, the hypostome cannot be straightforwardly homologous with the labrum.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; of Cambrian arthropod head structure. They do not necessarily accept the primary antenna theory of the onychophoran antennae; and they reject the idea that ''[[Fuxianhuia]]''  or any of its close relatives possessed a great appendage. Rather, they place the "great appendage" arthropods in the stem-group of the chelicerates, arguing that the great appendage is homologous to the chelicerae of chelicerates, and the first antennae of crustaceans.

==Assessment==

The number and nature of the post-oral segments in the insect head have rarely been questioned. A much more difficult area, however, has been the nature of the preoral region. The obvious contradiction between a theory that no-preoral structures are segmental, and evidence, such as for the first antennae of crustaceans, that some such structures clearly are, led workers as long ago as [[Ray Lankester|Lankester]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; to posit that there has been forward migration of segments in front of the mouth. Indeed, such a process can be seen in [[ontogeny]] of the tritocerebrum, which can be seen to migrate forward as the brain develops; furthermore, although in most insects and crustaceans its ganglia are part of the brain, its commissures still loop behind it, suggesting derivation from a more posterior position.

[[File:Atropos.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bas relief]] of Atropos, shears in hand, cutting the thread of life]]
'''Atropos''' or '''Aisa''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|t|r|ə|p|ɒ|s}}; {{lang-grc|Ἄτροπος}} "without turn"), in [[Greek mythology]], was one of the three [[Moirai]], goddesses of [[wikt:fate|fate]] and [[destiny]]. Her Roman equivalent was [[Morta (mythology)|Morta]].

Atropos was the oldest of the [[Moirai|Three Fates]], and was known as the "inflexible" or "inevitable." It was Atropos who chose the mechanism of death and ended the life of mortals by cutting their thread with her "abhorred shears". She worked along with her two sisters, [[Clotho]], who spun the thread, and [[Lachesis (mythology)|Lachesis]], who measured the length. Atropos has been featured in several stories such as [[Atalanta]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Baldwin | first =James| authorlink =James Baldwin (editor and author) | title =Old Greek Stories | chapter = The Story of Atalanta | url = https://www.gutenberg.org/files/11582/11582-h/11582-h.htm | isbn = 978-1421932125 | chapterurl = https://www.gutenberg.org/files/11582/11582-h/11582-h.htm#THE_STORY_OF_ATALANTA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and Achilles.

==Origin==
Her origin, along with the other two fates, is uncertain, although some called them the daughters of the night. It is clear, however, that at a certain period they ceased to be only concerned with death and also became those powers who decided what may happen to individuals. Although [[Zeus]] was the chief Greek god and their father, he was still subject to the decisions of the Fates, and thus the executor of destiny, rather than its source. According to [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Theogony]],'' Atropos and her sisters (Clotho and Lachesis) were the daughters of [[Erebus]] (Darkness) and [[Nyx (mythology)|Nyx]] (Night) and sister to [[Thanatos]] and [[Hypnos]],  though later in the same work (ll. 901-906) they are said to have been born of Zeus and [[Themis]].

==Medicine==
Atropos lends her name to the genus ''[[Atropa]]'', of which the poisonous plant ''[[Atropa belladonna]]'' (deadly nightshade) is a member, and to the alkaloid [[atropine]], an [[anticholinergic]] drug which is derived from it.

==Herpetology==
The scientific name of a [[venomous snake]], ''[[Bitis atropos]]'', refers to Atropos.&lt;ref&gt;Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). ''The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles''. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. {{ISBN|978-1-4214-0135-5}}. ("Atropos", p. 12).&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Australian Society of Archivists''' is a professional organization of [[archivists]] in [[Australia]].

The [[Australian Library and Information Association|Australian Library Association]] had an archives section between 1951 and 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=History of the ASA |accessdate=2018-09-27 |url=https://www.archivists.org.au/about-us/history }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Macmillan, David S.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6686">The '''BBC Sound Archive''' is a collection of audio recordings maintained by the [[BBC]] and founded in 1936. Its recordings date back to the late 19th century and include many rare items, including contemporary speeches by public and political figures, [[folk music]], British [[dialect]]s and sound effects.

==Foundation and early years==
The BBC began broadcasting in 1922 but nothing was recorded until ten years later. At that time, only one recording machine, a [[Blattnerphone]], was available, so few programmes were recorded.&lt;ref name = c2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/sound_archive.shtml?chapter=2 |title=BBC Archive - The BBC Sound Archive |publisher=www.bbc.co.uk |accessdate=2010-02-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1936 a number of [[gramophone record]]ings had been made, and a temporary secretary, [[Marie Slocombe]] was given the task of sorting and disposing of them.&lt;ref name = mag&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/6968321.stm |title=  Saving the sounds of history  |accessdate=2010-02-15 | date=2007-08-30 | work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, noticing that some included speeches by [[George Bernard Shaw]], [[H.G. Wells]], [[Winston Churchill]] and others, she decided that they should be kept. With the then Head of Recorded Programmes, Lynton Fletcher, she continued maintaining the BBC's collection, as well as making recordings herself in the field, encouraging others to do so, and acquired [[Ludwig Karl Koch|Ludwig Koch]]'s collection of [[bird vocalization|birdsong]] recordings.&lt;ref name = mag/&gt; By 1939 the collection had grown to 2,000 discs, including the voices of [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] and [[Joseph Goebbels|Goebbels]].&lt;ref name = mag/&gt; This had increased to 7,000 by 1944 and in 1941 Slocombe had become Recorded Programmes Librarian, a title she held until her retirement in 1972.&lt;ref name=petta&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pettarchiv.org.uk/staffpubs-craig-marieslocombe.htm |title=Planned Environment Therapy Trust Archive and Study Centre.

==Coverage, access and development==
The archive includes material dating back to the 19th century, including about 200 [[wax cylinder]]s, one of which is an 1890 recording of [[Florence Nightingale]].&lt;ref name=PreservingSoundArchive&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/preserving_sound.shtml?chapter=3 |title=BBC Archive - Preserving the Sound Archive |publisher=www.bbc.co.uk |accessdate=2010-02-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The collection has continued to grow over the years, and from 1998 was regularly drawn on for the [[BBC Radio 4]] series ''The Archive Hour''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.radiolistings.co.uk/programmes/a/ar/archive_hour__the.html |title=The Archive Hour |publisher=www.radiolistings.co.uk |accessdate=2010-02-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 a limited sample was made available online as part of the BBC Archive Trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spokenword.ac.uk/spokenwordmatters/2007/08/17/bbc-archive-trial-takes-off/ |title=Spoken Word Services » Blog Archive » BBC Archive trial takes off |publisher=www.spokenword.ac.uk |accessdate=2010-02-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101063250/http://www.spokenword.ac.uk/spokenwordmatters/2007/08/17/bbc-archive-trial-takes-off/ |archivedate=2011-01-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Resource constraints mean that the BBC has been selective in maintaining items in the archive. About 66% of radio output is now archived,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/sound_archive.shtml?chapter=8 |title=BBC Archive - The BBC Sound Archive |publisher=www.bbc.co.uk |accessdate=2010-02-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the collection's  recordings are of around 350,000 hours in total duration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/tv_archive.shtml |title=BBC Archive - The BBC Television Archive |publisher=www.bbc.co.uk |accessdate=2010-02-16 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213122349/http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/tv_archive.shtml |archivedate=13 February 2010 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; Automatically available are "live major news sequence programmes, live music sessions and concerts, drama, arts, features, events, light entertainment, science and education programmes", while "DJ shows with commercially recorded music, local radio and World Service output" are less likely to be retained.&lt;ref name=SSRC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mediaresearchhub.ssrc.org/bbc-sound-archive |title=BBC Sound Archive — SSRC |publisher=mediaresearchhub.ssrc.org |accessdate=2010-02-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090423145133/http://mediaresearchhub.ssrc.org/bbc-sound-archive |archivedate=2009-04-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Access to part of the archive is made available to researchers and the public through the [[British Library]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelprestype/sound/sacat/catalogue.html |title=Using the Sound Archive catalogue |publisher=www.bl.uk |accessdate=2010-02-15 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100115021659/http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelprestype/sound/sacat/catalogue.html| archivedate= 15 January 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technological advances have increasingly improved the durability of early recordings, requiring their translation into digital formats, and enhancements such as [[noise reduction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/preserving_sound.shtml?chapter=7 |title=BBC Archive - Preserving the Sound Archive |publisher=www.bbc.co.uk |accessdate=2010-02-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/preserving_sound.shtml?chapter=8 |title=BBC Archive - Preserving the Sound Archive |publisher=www.bbc.co.uk |accessdate=2010-02-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Babylonian Chronicles''' are many series of [[clay tablet|tablet]]s recording major events in [[Babylon]]ian history. They are thus one of the first steps in the development of [[ancient]] [[historiography]]. The Babylonian Chronicles were written from the reign of [[Nabonassar]] up to the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian Period]], by Babylonian astronomers ("Chaldaeans"), who probably used the ''[[Astronomical Diaries]]'' as their source.

Almost all of the tablets were identified as chronicles once in the collection of the [[British Museum]], having been acquired via antiquities dealers from unknown excavations in the 19th century. All but three of the chronicles are [[provenance|unprovenanced]].&lt;ref name=waerzeggers/&gt;

The Chronicles provide the "master narrative" for large tracts of current Babylonian history.&lt;ref name=waerzeggers&gt;Caroline Waerzeggers, [https://www.academia.edu/3268307/The_Babylonian_Chronicles_Classification_and_Provenance_Journal_of_Near_Eastern_Studies_71_2_2012_285-298 The_Babylonian_Chronicles_Classification_and_Provenance] ''Journal of Near Eastern Studies'' 71/2 (2012), 285–298.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery and publication==
The chronicles are thought to have been transferred to the [[British Museum]] after 19th century excavations in Babylon, and subsequently left undeciphered in the archives for decades. The first chronicle to be published was BM 92502 (ABC1) in 1887 by [[Theophilus Pinches]] under the title "The Babylonian Chronicle". This was followed in 1923 by the publication of the Fall of Nineveh Chronicle (ABC 3), in 1924 by Sidney Smith's publication of the Esarhaddon Chronicle (ABC 14), the Akitu Chronicle (ABC 16) and the [[Nabonidus Chronicle]] (ABC 7), and in 1956 by [[Donald Wiseman]]'s publication of four further tablets including the [[Nebuchadnezzar Chronicle]] (ABC 5).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/mobile/doc/10493581# Wiseman, 1956, pages 1+2]{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Banyan VINES''' was a [[network operating system]] developed by [[Banyan Systems]] for computers running [[AT&amp;T]]'s [[UNIX System V]].

''VINES'' is an acronym for ''Virtual Integrated NEtwork Service''. Like [[Novell NetWare]], VINES's network services were based on the archetypical [[Xerox XNS]] [[Protocol stack|stack]].

[[James Allchin]], who later worked as Group Vice President for Platforms at [[Microsoft]] until his retirement on January 30, 2007, was the chief architect of Banyan VINES.

== VINES technology ==
VINES ran on a low-level protocol known as ''VIP''—the ''VINES Internetwork Protocol''—that was essentially identical to the lower layers of XNS. Addresses consisted of a 32-bit address and a 16-bit [[Subnetwork|subnet]] that mapped to the 48-bit [[Ethernet]] address to route to machines.  This meant that, like other XNS-based systems, VINES could only support a two-level internet.

A set of [[routing algorithm]]s, however, set VINES apart from other XNS systems at this level.  The key differentiator, ''ARP'' (''Address Resolution Protocol''), allowed VINES clients to automatically set up their own network addresses.  When a client first booted up it broadcast a request on the subnet asking for servers, which would respond with suggested addresses.  The client would use the first to respond, although the servers could hand off "better" [[routing]] instructions to the client if the network changed. The overall concept  very much resembled [[AppleTalk]]'s AARP system, with the exception that VINES required at least one server, whereas AARP functioned completely "headlessly". Like AARP, VINES required an inherently "chatty" network, sending updates about the status of clients to other servers on the [[internetwork]].

Rounding out its lower-level system, VINES used ''RTP'' (the ''Routing Table Protocol''), a low-overhead message system for passing around information about changes to the routing, and ARP to determine the address of other nodes on the system. These closely resembled the similar systems used in other XNS-based protocols. VINES also included ''ICP'' (the ''Internet Control Protocol''), which it used to pass error-messages and metrics.

At the middle layer level, VINES used fairly standard software. The ''unreliable datagram service'' and ''data-stream service'' operated essentially identically to [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]] and [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] on top of [[Internet Protocol|IP]]. However VINES also added a ''reliable message service'' as well, a sort of hybrid of the two that offered guaranteed delivery of a single packet.

Banyan offered customers TCP/IP as an extra cost option to customers of standard Vines servers.   This extra charge for TCP/IP on Vines servers continued long after TCP/IP server availability had become commoditized.

At the topmost layer, VINES provided the standard file and print services, as well as the unique ''StreetTalk'', likely the first truly practical globally consistent [[name Service|name-service]] for an entire internetwork. Using a globally distributed, partially replicated database, StreetTalk could meld multiple widely separated networks into a single network that allowed seamless resource-sharing. It accomplished this through its rigidly hierarchical naming-scheme; entries in the directory always had the form  ''item''@''group''@''organization''. This applied to user accounts as well as to resources like [[Computer printer|printer]]s and [[file server]]s.

== VINES client software ==
VINES client-software ran on most PC-based operating systems, including [[MS-DOS]] and earlier versions of [[Microsoft Windows]]. It was fairly light-weight on the client, and hence remained in use during the later half of the 1990s on many older machines that couldn't run other networking stacks then in widespread use. This occurred on the server side as well, as VINES generally offered good performance, even from mediocre hardware.

== Initial market release ==
With StreetTalk's inherent low bandwidth requirements, global companies and governments that grasped the advantages of worldwide [[directory services]] seamlessly spanning multiple time zones recognized VINE's technological edge. Users included gas and oil companies, power companies, public utilities—and U.S. Government agencies including the State Department, Treasury Department, Department of Agriculture, and Department of Defense.

The U.S. State Department, for example, was an early adopter of the VINES technology. Able to take advantage of the then high-speed 56k modems for telephonic connectivity of the developed world to the limited telephone modem speeds of 300 baud over bad analog telephone systems in the [[Third World]], VINES was able to link embassies around the world.  VINES also came with built-in point-to-point and group chat capability that was useful for basic communication over secure lines.

== Defense Department adoption ==
By the late 1980s the [[US Marine Corps]] was searching for simple, off-the-shelf worldwide network connectivity with rich built-in email, file, and print features. By 1988 the Marine Corps had standardized on VINES&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=1T0EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA76&amp;lpg=PA76&amp;dq=banyan+vines+marines&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xph_KsYc_K&amp;sig=p6MMI1aK_IBWF7hN7rRbFDeak0E&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=nPeWVfaSJZH98AXq3K7wAg&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=banyan%20vines%20marines&amp;f=false"The U.S. Marines' Network-Linked War Units"], 14 Oct 1991, p576, InfoWorld&lt;/ref&gt; as both its garrison (base) and forward-deployed ground-based battlefield email-centric network operating system.

Using both ground-based secure radio channels and satellite and military tactical phone switches, the Marine Corps was ready for its first big test of VINES: the 1990-1991 Gulf War. Units were able to seamlessly coordinate ground, naval, and air strikes across military boundaries by using the chat function to pass target lists and adjust naval gun fire on the fly. Ground fire support coordination agencies used VINES up and down command channels—from Battalion-to-Regiment through Division-to-Corps and Squadron-to-Group to Aircraft Wing-to-Corps, as well as in peer-to-peer unit communication. {{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

== VINES competitors ==
For a decade, Banyan's OS competitors, Novell and Microsoft, dismissed the utility of [[directory services]]. Consequently, VINES dominated what came to be called the "directory services" space from 1985 to 1995. While seeming to ignore VINES, Novell and eventually Microsoft—companies with a flat server or domain-based network model—came to realize the strategic value of directory services. With little warning, Novell went from playing down the value of directory services to announcing its own: [[NetWare Directory Services]] (NDS). Eventually, Novell changed ''NDS'' to mean Novell Directory Services, and then renamed that to eDirectory.

Microsoft had gone through its own round of operating system development. Initially, they partnered with IBM to develop an Intel-based [[disk operating system]] called [[PC DOS]], and its Microsoft twin, [[MS-DOS]]. Eventually, Microsoft shared true network operating system development with [[IBM LAN Manager]] and its Microsoft twin, [[Microsoft LAN Manager]]. Microsoft parted company with IBM and continued developing LAN Manager into what became [[Windows NT]]. Essentially, its OS 4.0. NT was originally a flat server or domain-based operating system with none of the advantages of VINES or NDS.

For [[Windows 2000]] however, Microsoft included [[Active Directory]], an LDAP directory service based on the directory from its Exchange mail server. Active Directory was as robust as and, in several key ways, superior to VINES. While VINES was limited to a three-part name, user.company.org, like Novell's NDS structure, Active Directory was not bound by such a naming convention. Active Directory had developed an additional capability that both NDS and VINES lacked, its "forest and trees" organizational model. The combination of better architecture and a marketing company the size of Microsoft doomed StreetTalk, VINES as an OS, and finally Banyan itself.

== Decline ==
By the late 1990s, VINES' once-touted StreetTalk Services' non-flat, non-domain model with its built-in messaging, efficiency and onetime performance edge had lost ground to newer technology. Banyan was unable to market its product far beyond its initial base of multi-national and government entities.

Because Banyan could not quickly develop an OS to take advantage of newer hardware, and apparently did not understand that the StreetTalk directory services, not the shrink-wrapped OS, was the prime value added—the company lost ground in the networking market.  VINES sales rapidly dried up, both because of these problems and because of the rapid rise of [[Windows NT]]. Banyan increasingly turned to StreetTalk as a differentiator, eventually porting it to NT as a stand-alone product and offering it as an interface to [[Lightweight Directory Access Protocol|LDAP]] systems. {{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

Also, Banyan continued to operate a closed OS. This required hardware manufacturers to submit hardware and driver requirements so that Banyan could write drivers for each peripheral. When more open systems with published APIs began to appear, Banyan did not alter their model. This made it difficult for client-side support to handle the explosive growth in, for example, printers. As competitors began to adopt some of VINES' outstanding wide area networking protocols and services, manufacturers were less inclined to send a unit to Banyan for VINES specific drivers when competitors let them write their own.

Dropping the Banyan brand for ''ePresence'' in 1999, as a general [[Internet]] services company, the firm sold its services division to [[Unisys]] in late 2003 and liquidated its remaining holdings in its Switchboard.com subsidiary.

''Blood Sword'' is a series of [[gamebook]]s created by [[Oliver Johnson (writer)|Oliver Johnson]] and [[Dave Morris (writer)|Dave Morris]] and published by [[Knight Books]] in the late 1980s. The books were illustrated by [[Russ Nicholson]] and the maps supplied by [[Geoff Wingate]]. It was set in the author's own fantasy world of "Legend" which was also the setting for their [[Dragon Warriors]] [[role playing game]].

==The world of Legend==
The world of Legend has noticeable parallels with Earth in the late 10th century AD, with strong elements of [[Christianity|Christian]], [[Greece|Greek]], [[Ancient Rome|Roman]], [[Norsemen]] and [[Arab]]ian mythology. Crusaders of the 'True Faith' (an analogue of [[Christianity]]) have defeated the Ta'ashim people (an analogue of [[Islam]]) and conquered the [[Outremer]]. As the timeline approaches 1000 AD, [[Millennialism|Millennialist]] fever grips many.

After emerging victorious from the Battlepits of Krarth (book 1), where a deadly contest is held every thirteen months, you - a hero (or a group of heroes) belonging to the True Faith - are involved in a bloody battle against a pack of [[Werewolf|werewolves]] (book 2). Having defeated the pack, you receive a jeweled scabbard from a dying harpist - it's the [[scabbard]] of the [[Sword]] of Life, dubbed ''Blood Sword'' in popular [[folklore]].

You will need to find the missing parts of the sword - first the [[hilt]], then the [[blade]] - in order to slay the coming True Magi, who were killed in the Blasting - a major cataclysm - six hundred years ago, and now want to rule the world on their return. Only the Blood Sword, the bane of the [[undead]], can stop them. So you travel to the northern land of [[Wyrd]], where the Warlock-King guards the hilt from inside his Palace of Eternal Dusk. Then your journey takes you south (book 3), to Crescentium - the main port of the Outremer. There you will find several allies - among whom the [[Hashshashin|assassin]] leader [[Hasan-i-Sabbah]] - who will help you find the blade. But your old enemy Aiken - a [[Yamato Province|Yamatese]] warrior, known in the lands of the West by the name of Icon the Ungodly - will eventually find you, and after you defeat him for the second time Icon falls down to [[Sheol]], the realm of the dead, taking the Blood Sword with him.

So you will have to enter Sheol (book 4), a patchwork of hells from different mythologies, where a mysterious man who goes by the name of the Traveller takes you through a long journey which ends before archangel [[Azrael]]. Here you discover that the Traveller is no one else but Icon, your arch-enemy, whom you finally manage to kill, thus retrieving the Blood Sword. In the last book, while the Millennialist fever is engulfing the continent, you travel north once more to enter the citadel of Spyte, where the True Magi are going to reincarnate at midnight at the end of the millennium. You finally defeat them with the help of Karunaz, a  Ta'ashim noble warrior, son of Hasan-i-Sabbah. It's now midnight of [[Winter's Eve]], 999 AD - [[Judgment Day]] has come, and you are rewarded with eternal life in [[Paradise]].

==Gameplay==
The book series differed from many of the [[Fighting Fantasy]] and [[Choose Your Own Adventure]] type books of the era by being designed for multi-player, co-operative play (though there was also a single-player option, and one player could control more than one character at a time).

A party could consist of up to four players, with each player being either a Sage, Enchanter, Trickster or Warrior. Each of the classes was well-balanced and offered a different playing style from the others. Characters advanced in level, gaining power as the series progressed, and were carried forward from book to book, giving the experience of one long story.

Each player was autonomous - often paragraphs would be for one player's eyes only, and he would be privy to some information that he was free to withhold from the rest of his party.

===Combat===
Combat took place on mini-maps consisting of squares, with players able to use tactical combat options to defeat their foes. This added a dimension of realism to the game, for players had to move to their enemies before fighting them, and if it were a surprise attack, their enemies would start near or next to them. Some mini-maps include a square for fleeing; if the players wish to flee from the battle, they must move to that square before turning to the appropriate paragraph.

Sometimes there would be impassable obstacles on maps which characters would have to get around, or squares impassable to players but usable by monsters (e.g.: burning hot coals).

===Classes===
*'''Warrior:''' The typical hack-and-slash, honourable fighter. He can absorb and deal the most damage, but does not have any unique skills and must also act honourably or face penalties.
*'''Trickster:''' A cunning and charismatic thief, albeit one with a heart.
*'''Sage:''' A warrior-monk with mystical powers such as [[levitation (paranormal)|levitation]] and healing, as well as knowledge of ancient [[Folklore|lore]]. There are many occasions when a Sage's wisdom is called upon to solve a problem or provide more information about something.
*'''Enchanter:''' A mage who starts the game with a long list of spells.

===Attributes===
*'''Fighting Prowess:''' A measure of how powerful a fighter the character is.
*'''Psychic Ability:''' An indicator of the character's resistance to attack spells and (in the case of an Enchanter) his or her aptitude for magic.
*'''Awareness:''' The character's speed, dexterity and cunning.
*'''Endurance:''' Measures the character's state of health; wounds are deducted from Endurance and if it reaches zero, the character dies.

==Books in the series==
The series consisted of five books:

'''1 : The Battlepits of Krarth'''
"Every thirteen lunar months the Magi of Krarth hold a deadly contest to see which of them will rule that bleak and icy land. Teams of daring adventurers are sent down into the labyrinths that lie beneath the tundra, each searching for the Emblem of Victory that will win power for their patron. Only one team can survive. The others must die."

'''2 : The Kingdom of Wyrd'''
"From the Palace of Eternal Dusk, the Warlock-King holds his realm in thrall. His tyrannized subjects live in perpetual fear, for they know their evil monarch can see into the minds of others and slay them in their dreams. Only outsiders from beyond the boundaries of Wyrd may slay the tyrant - and they will need all the courage and skill that mortals ever can possess."

'''3 : The Demon's Claw'''
"Will you survive the perils of the desert city of Crescentium? The wandering ghouls and assassins? The half-human monsters? The dreaded Seven-in-One? For this is a land of sorcery and treachery - where you will encounter terrors and wonders more fabulous than you had ever dared imagine - the great Roc, the three wishes, the ship of the Pirate-King, the flying horse, the magic of the beautiful Psyche. And who shall win the Sword of Death, the Demon's Claw itself?"

'''4 : Doomwalk'''
"Of all the desperate adventures, this is the most desperate - and the most vital. Only two years remain before the year 1000, when the Magi's power will have waxed full and the moment of their reincarnation will be at hand! All is not lost; if you can recover the fragments of the Blood Sword, the Magi can be opposed. But to do so, you must travel to the land of death..."

'''5: The Walls of Spyte'''
"In the darkening sky above, five ominous stars have come into conjunction for the first time in 200 years. Out of the vault of the sky they cast their baleful influence across the frozen landscape. They are the disembodied spirits of the last of the Magi, seeing the return to the mortal world at midnight and ushering in a new era of terror. You wield the sole force in the world capable of destroying the Magi. The Sword of Life is mankind's only hope but it is no guarantee of victory. The Magi have had two centuries of exile to plan their reincarnation. To stop them you will need greater courage and strength than ever before!"

The '''Brooklyn Museum''' is an [[art museum]] located in the [[New York City]] [[borough (New York City)|borough]] of [[Brooklyn]]. At {{convert|560000|sqft}}, the museum is [[New York City]]'s third largest in physical size and holds an art collection with roughly 1.5 million works.&lt;ref name="Spelling"&gt;{{cite news| first=Simon| last=Spelling| title=Entertainment: Brooklyn Museum| work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]| url=http://nymag.com/listings/attraction/brooklyn-museum-of-art/ | accessdate=2014-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Located near the [[Prospect Heights, Brooklyn|Prospect Heights]], [[Crown Heights, Brooklyn|Crown Heights]], [[Flatbush, Brooklyn|Flatbush]], and [[Park Slope]] neighborhoods of Brooklyn and founded in 1895, the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] building,  designed by [[McKim, Mead and White]], was planned to be the largest art museum in the world. The museum initially struggled to maintain its building and collection, only to be revitalized in the late 20th century, thanks to major renovations. Significant areas of the collection include antiquities, specifically their collection of [[Egyptian antiquities]] spanning over 3,000 years.

==History==
{{See also|Brooklyn Museum Art School}}

The roots of the Brooklyn Museum extend back to the 1823 founding by Augustus Graham of the Brooklyn Apprentices' Library in Brooklyn Heights. The Library moved into the Brooklyn Lyceum building on Washington Street in 1841. Two years later the institutions merged to form the Brooklyn Institute, which offered exhibitions of painting and sculpture and lectures on diverse subjects. In 1890, under its director [[Franklin Hooper]], Institute leaders reorganized as the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences and began planning the Brooklyn Museum. The museum remained a subdivision of the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences, along with the [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]], the [[Brooklyn Botanic Garden]], and the [[Brooklyn Children's Museum]] until the 1970s when all became independent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/about/building.php |title=About: The Museum's Building |publisher=Brooklyn Museum| accessdate=2014-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opened in 1897, the Brooklyn Museum building is a steel frame structure encased in [[classical architecture|classical]] masonry, designed by the famous [[architecture|architectural]] firm of [[McKim, Mead, and White]] and built by the Carlin Construction Company. The initial design for the Brooklyn Museum was four times as large as the actualized version; actualized plans reflect a compromise to the specifications of the New York City government.&lt;ref name=aia&gt;{{cite book| last1=White| first1=Norval| last2=Wilensky| first2=Elliot| last3=Leadon| first3=Fran| title=AIA Guide to New York City| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t0gj61QSgk8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=aia+guide+new+york+city+1978&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_9jbU8mBIpPKsQTOkoC4Bg&amp;ved=0CB8Q6wEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false| pages=605–606| publisher=Oxford University Press| date=June 9, 2010| location=New York| isbn=978-0195383867| subscription=yes| accessdate=2014-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Daniel Chester French]], the noted sculptor of the [[Lincoln Memorial]], was the principal designer of the pediment sculptures and the monolithic {{convert|12.5|ft|m|adj=on}} figures along the cornice. The figures were created by 11 sculptors and carved by the [[Piccirilli Brothers]]. French also designed the two allegorical figures ''Brooklyn'' and ''Manhattan'' currently flanking the museum's entrance, created in 1916 for the Brooklyn approach to the Manhattan Bridge, relocated to the museum in 1963.

By 1920, the [[New York City Subway]] reached the museum with a [[Eastern Parkway – Brooklyn Museum (IRT Eastern Parkway Line)|subway station]]; this greatly improved access to the once-isolated museum from [[Manhattan]] and other outer boroughs.

The Brooklyn Institute's director [[Franklin Hooper]] was the museum's first director, succeeded by William Henry Fox who served from 1914 to 1934.  He was followed by Philip Newell Youtz (1934–1938), Laurance Page Roberts (1939–1946), Isabel Spaulding Roberts (1943–1946), Charles Nagel, Jr. (1946–1955), and Edgar Craig Schenck (1955–1959).

[[Thomas S. Buechner]] became the museum's director in 1960, making him one of the youngest directors in the country. Buechner oversaw a major transformation in the way the museum displayed art and brought some one thousand works that had languished in the museum's archives and put them on display. Buechner played a pivotal role in rescuing the Daniel Chester French sculptures from destruction due to an expansion project at the [[Manhattan Bridge]] in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Grimes"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/18/arts/design/18buechner.html| title=Thomas S.

Duncan F. Cameron held the post from 1971 to 1973, with Michael Botwinick succeeding him (1974–1982) and Linda S. Ferber acting director for part of 1983 until Robert T. Buck became director in 1983 and served until 1996.

The Brooklyn Museum changed its name to '''Brooklyn Museum of Art''' in 1997, shortly before the start of Arnold L. Lehman's term as director. On March 12, 2004, the museum announced that it would revert to its previous name.  In April 2004, the museum opened the [[James Polshek]]-designed entrance pavilion on the [[Eastern Parkway]] façade.&lt;ref name=muschamp&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/16/arts/architecture-review-brooklyn-s-radiant-new-art-palace.html |title=Brooklyn's Radiant New Art Palace |last=Muschamp |first=Herbert |date=July 16, 2004 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=2010-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2014, Lehman announced that he was planning to retire around June 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Vogel| first=Carol| title=Brooklyn Museum's Longtime Director Plans to Retire| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/10/arts/design/arnold-lehman-to-step-down-from-his-post.html| accessdate=2014-09-16| newspaper=The New York Times| date=September 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2015, [[Creative Time]] president and artistic director [[Anne Pasternak]] was named the museum's next director; she assumed the position on September 1, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lescaze|first1=Zoë|title=Anne Pasternak Named Director of the Brooklyn Museum|url=http://www.artnews.com/2015/05/19/anne-pasternak-named-director-of-the-brooklyn-museum/|accessdate=13 June 2015|work=ArtNews|date=19 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding==
The Brooklyn Museum, along with numerous other New York institutions, including the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], the [[American Museum of Natural History]], and the [[Brooklyn Botanic Garden]], is part of the [[Cultural Institutions Group]] (CIG). Member institutions occupy land or buildings owned by the City of New York and derive part of their yearly funding from the City. The Brooklyn Museum also supplements its earned income with funding from Federal and State governments, as well as with donations by individuals and organizations.

In 1999, the museum hosted the [[Charles Saatchi]] exhibition ''[[Sensation (exhibition)|Sensation]]'', resulting in a court battle&lt;ref&gt;Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences v. City of New York, 64 F.Supp.2d 184 (E.D.N.Y. Nov 01, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; over New York City's municipal funding of institutions exhibiting controversial art, eventually decided in favor of the museum on [[First Amendment]] grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ncac.org/resource/brooklyn-institute-of-arts-and-sciences-v-city-of-new-york/|title=BROOKLYN INSTITUTE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES v.

In 2005, the museum was among 406 New York City arts and social service institutions to receive part of a $20 million grant from the [[Carnegie Corporation]], made possible through a donation by New York City mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]].&lt;ref name=roberts&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/06/nyregion/06donate.html?ex=1278302400&amp;en=93a1beabd4ede5b8&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss| title=City Groups Get Bloomberg Gift of $20 Million| first=Sam| last=Roberts| work=The New York Times| date=July 6, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=carnegie&gt;{{cite press release| url=http://carnegie.org/news/press-releases/story/news-action/single/view/carnegie-corporation-of-new-york-announces-twenty-million-dollars-in-new-york-city-grants/| title=Carnegie Corporation of New York announces twenty million dollars in New York City grants| publisher=Carnegie Corporation| date=July 5, 2005| accessdate=2014-08-01| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120914190110/http://carnegie.org/news/press-releases/story/news-action/single/view/carnegie-corporation-of-new-york-announces-twenty-million-dollars-in-new-york-city-grants/| archivedate=September 14, 2012| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major benefactors include [[Frank Lusk Babbott]].

The museum is the site of the annual Brooklyn Artists Ball which has included celebrity hosts such as [[Sarah Jessica Parker]] and [[Liv Tyler]].&lt;ref name=ball&gt;{{cite news| title=Brooklyn Museum's Artists Ball: Sarah Jessica Parker &amp; Liv Tyler Broadcast Their Art Credit| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/artinfo/sarah-jessica-parker-and-_b_857422.html#s274395| work=[[Huffington Post]]| date=May 5, 2011| accessdate=2014-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art and exhibitions==
The Brooklyn Museum exhibits collections that seek to embody the rich artistic heritage of world cultures.  The museum is well known for its expansive collections of Egyptian and African art, in addition to 17th-, 18th-, 19th-, and 20th-century paintings, sculpture, and decorative arts throughout a wide range of schools.

In 2002, the museum received the work ''[[The Dinner Party]]'', by feminist artist [[Judy Chicago]], as a gift from The Elizabeth A. Sackler Foundation. Its permanent exhibition began in 2007, as a centerpiece for the museum's [[Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art]].  In 2004, the Brooklyn Museum featured ''Manifest Destiny'', an {{convert|8|x|24|ft|m|adj=on}} oil-on-wood mural by [[Alexis Rockman]] that was commissioned by the museum as a centerpiece for the second-floor Mezzanine Gallery and marked the opening of the museum's renovated Grand Lobby and plaza.&lt;ref name="yablonsky"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/11/arts/art-architecture-new-york-s-watery-new-grave.html |title=New York's Watery New Grave |last=Yablonsky |first=Linda |date=November 4, 2004 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=2010-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rockman&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/press/uploads/2004_03_alexis_rockman.pdf |title=Alexis Rockman Mural of Future Brooklyn Celebrates Opening of the Brooklyn Museum New Front Entrance and Plaza |date=March 2004 |publisher=Brooklyn Museum |accessdate=2010-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other exhibitions have showcased the works of various contemporary artists including [[Patrick Kelly (fashion designer)|Patrick Kelly]], [[Chuck Close]], [[Denis Peterson]], [[Ron Mueck]], [[Takashi Murakami]], [[Mat Benote]],&lt;ref name=hangin&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/brooklyn/2009/09/29/2009-09-29_artist_slips_in_stealth_exhibit.html| location=New York| work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]] | title=Hangin' with big boys: Artist slips in stealth exhibit at Brooklyn Museum | first=Mike| last=Mclaughlin| date=September 28, 2009| accessdate=2014-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kiki Smith]], [[Jim Dine]], [[Robert Rauschenberg]], [[Ching Ho Cheng]], [[Sylvia Sleigh]], [[Arvo Györköny]] and [[William Wegman (photographer)|William Wegman]], and a 2004 survey show of work by Brooklyn artists, ''Open House: Working in Brooklyn''.&lt;ref name=openhouse&gt;{{cite press release| title=Open House: Working in Brooklyn| url=http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/exhibitions/open_house/| publisher=Brooklyn Museum| date=April 17, 2004| accessdate=2014-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, curator Edna Russman announced that a third of the [[Coptic art]] held in the museum's collection—second-largest in North America—is fake.  Of 30 works of art, Russman believes 10 are faked. The fake artworks will be displayed in an exhibition starting in 2009.&lt;ref name="russmanadmits"&gt;{{cite news| title=New York museum admits third of its Coptic art is fake| work=[[The Independent]]| date=July 2, 2008| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/new-york-museum-admits-third-of-its-coptic-art-is-fake-858345.html| accessdate=2008-07-07| location=London| first=David| last=Usborne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collections==

===Egyptian, Classical, and Ancient Near Eastern Art===
The Brooklyn Museum has been building a collection of [[Egypt]]ian artifacts since the beginning of the twentieth century, incorporating both collections purchased from others, such as that of American [[Egyptology|Egyptologist]] [[Charles Edwin Wilbour]], whose heirs also donated his library to become the museum's Wilbour Library of Egyptology, and objects obtained during museum-sponsored archeological excavations. The Egyptian collection includes objects ranging from statuary, such as the well-known "Bird Lady" [[terra cotta]] figure, to [[papyrus]] documents (among others the [[Brooklyn Papyrus]]).&lt;ref name="EgyptColHist"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/egyptian/copy/history| title=Collections: Egyptian, Classical, Ancient Near Eastern Art: History| publisher=The Brooklyn Museum| accessdate=2014-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Egyptian, Classical, and Ancient Near Eastern collections are housed in a series of galleries in the museum. Egyptian artifacts can be found in the long-term exhibit, ''Egypt Reborn: Art for Eternity'', as well as in the Martha A. and Robert S. Rubin Galleries. Near Eastern artifacts are located in the [[Hagop Kevorkian]] Gallery.&lt;ref name="EgyptColHist" /&gt;

===American Art===
[[File:Gilbert Stuart - George Washington - Google Art Project (6966745).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Gilbert Stuart]], ''Portrait of [[George Washington]]'']]

The museum's collection of American art dates its first bequest of [[Francis Guy]]'s ''Winter Scene in Brooklyn'' in 1846. In 1855, the museum officially designated a collection of American Art, with the first work commissioned for the collection being a landscape painting by [[Asher B. Durand]]. Items in the American Art collection include portraits, pastels, sculptures, and prints; all items in the collection date to between c. 1720 and c. 1945.

Represented in the American Art collection are works by artists such as [[William Edmondson]] (''Angel'', date unknown), [[John Singer Sargent]]'s ''[[Paul César Helleu]] sketching his wife Alice Guérin'' (ca. 1889); [[Georgia O'Keeffe]]'s ''Dark Tree Trunks'' (ca. 1946), and [[Winslow Homer]]'s ''[[Eight Bells (painting)|Eight Bells]]'' (ca. 1887). Among the most famous works in the collection are [[Gilbert Stuart]]'s portrait of [[George Washington]] and [[Edward Hicks]]'s [[Edward Hicks|''The Peaceable Kingdom'']]. The museum also holds a collection by [[Emil Fuchs (artist)|Emil Fuchs]].&lt;ref name=fuchs&gt;{{cite web| title=Collections: Emil Fuchs| url=http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/artists/1630/Emil_Fuchs/objects/index/0| publisher=Brooklyn Museum| accessdate=2014-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Works from the American Art collection can be found in various areas of the museum, including in the Steinberg Family Sculpture Garden and in the exhibit, ''American Identities: A New Look'', which is contained within the museum's ''Visible Storage ▪ Study Center''.&lt;ref name="AmColHist"&gt;{{cite web| title=Collections: History| url=http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/american_art/copy/history| publisher=The Brooklyn Museum| accessdate=2014-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In total, there are approximately 2,000 American Art objects held in storage. &lt;ref name="AmColNo"&gt;{{cite web| title=Confounding Expectations with Brooklyn Museum's Laval Bryant| url=https://trending.virginholidays.co.uk/new-york-city/interview-the-brooklyn-museum| publisher=Virgin Holidays| accessdate=2018-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arts of Africa===
The oldest acquisitions in the African art collection were collected by the museum in 1900, shortly after the museum's founding. The collection was expanded in 1922 with items originating largely in what is now the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. In 1923 the museum hosted one of the first exhibitions of African art in the United States.

With more than 5,000 items in its collection, the Brooklyn Museum boasts one of the largest collections of African art in any American art museum. Although the title of the collection suggests that it includes art from all of the African continent, works from Africa are sub-categorized among a number of collections. Sub-Saharan art from West and Central Africa are collected under the banner of African Art, while North African and Egyptian art works are grouped with the Islamic and Egyptian art collections, respectively.

The African art collection covers 2,500 years of human history and includes sculpture, jewellery, masks, and religious artifacts from more than 100 African cultures. Noteworthy items in this collection include a carved ''ndop'' figure of a Kuba king, believed to be among the oldest extant ''ndop'' carvings, and a Lulua mother-and-child figure.&lt;ref name="AfricanColHist"&gt;{{cite web| title=Collections: History| url=http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/african_art/copy/history| publisher=Brooklyn Museum| accessdate=2014-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, the museum drew criticism from groups including [[Decolonize This Place]] for its hiring of a white woman as Consulting Curator of African Arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artnews.com/2018/04/30/brooklyn-not-sale-decolonize-place-leads-protest-brooklyn-museum/|title=‘Brooklyn Is Not for Sale’: Decolonize This Place Leads Protest at Brooklyn Museum|last=Greenberger|first=Alex|date=2018-04-30|website=ARTnews|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://gothamist.com/2018/04/30/brooklyn_museum_protest.php#photo-1|title='Decolonize This Place' Protesters Disrupt Brooklyn Museum, Condemn 'Imperial Plunder'|work=Gothamist|access-date=2018-10-14|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180817020445/http://gothamist.com/2018/04/30/brooklyn_museum_protest.php#photo-1#photo-1|archive-date=2018-08-17|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arts of the Pacific Islands===
The museum's collection of Pacific Islands art began in 1900 with the acquisition of 100  wooden figures and [[shadow play|shadow puppets]] from [[New Guinea]] and the [[Dutch East Indies]] (now [[Indonesia]]); since that base, the collection has grown to encompass close to 5,000 works. Art in this collection is sourced to numerous Pacific and Indian Ocean islands including [[Hawaii]] and New Zealand, as well as less-populous islands such as [[Rapa Nui]] and [[Vanuatu]]. Many of the [[Marquesas Islands|Marquesan]] items in the collection were acquired by the museum from famed Norwegian explorer [[Thor Heyerdahl]].&lt;ref name="PacColHist"&gt;{{cite web| title=Collections: History| url=http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/pacific/copy/history| publisher=Brooklyn Museum| accessdate=2014-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Art objects in this collection are crafted from a wide variety of materials. The museum lists "coconut fiber, feathers, shells, clay, bone, human hair, wood, moss, and spider webs"&lt;ref name="PacColHist"/&gt; as among the materials used to make artworks that include masks, [[tapa cloth]]s, sculpture, and jewellery.

===Arts of the Islamic World===
The museum also has art objects and historical texts produced by Muslim artists or about Muslim figures and cultures.&lt;ref name=IslamicCol&gt;{{cite web| title=Collections: Arts of the Islamic World| url=https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/arts_of_the_islamic_world| publisher=Brooklyn Museum| accessdate=2014-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art===
{{main|Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art}}
The museum's center for [[feminist art]] opened in 2007; it is dedicated to preserving the history of the movement since the late 20th century, as well as raising awareness of feminist contributions to art, and informing the future of this area of artistic dialogue.  Along with an exhibition space and library, the center features a gallery housing a masterwork by [[Judy Chicago]], a large installation called ''[[The Dinner Party]]'' (1974-1979).&lt;ref name=micucci&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/19/arts/19iht-raafemina-28463.html |work=The New York Times| first=Dana| last=Micucci| title=Feminist art gets place of pride in Brooklyn| date=April 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Libraries and archives==
{{main|Brooklyn Museum Libraries and Archives}}
The Brooklyn Museum Libraries and Archives hold approximately 300,000 volumes and over {{convert|2000|ft|m|adj=on}} of books, documents, prints, textiles and other items.  The collection began in 1823 and is housed in facilities that underwent renovations in 1965, 1984 and 2014.&lt;ref name=index&gt;{{cite web| title=Archives Collections Index| url=http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/archives/copy/history| publisher=Brooklyn Museum| accessdate=2014-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="collection-library"&gt;{{cite web| title=Collections: Libraries and Archives| url=http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/archives/| publisher=Brooklyn Museum| accessdate=2014-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=renovatedlibrary&gt;{{cite press release| title=Redesigned and Renovated Brooklyn Museum Libraries and Archives Opens to Public October 20, 2004| url=http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/press/uploads/2004_09_libraries.pdf| date=September 2004| publisher=Brooklyn Museum| accessdate=2014-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs==
In 2000, the Brooklyn Museum started the Museum Apprentice Program in which the museum hires teenage high schoolers to give tours in the museum's galleries during the summer, assist with the museum's weekend family programs throughout the year, participate in talks with museum [[curator]]s, serve as a teen advisory board to the museum, and help plan teen events.

The first Saturday of each month, the Brooklyn Museum stays open until 11pm. General admission is waived from 5-11pm, although some ticketed exhibitions may require an entrance fee. Regular first Saturday activities include educational family-oriented activities such as collection-based art workshops, gallery tours, lectures, live performances dance parties.&lt;ref name="FirstSat"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/visit/first_saturdays.php| title=Target First Saturdays at the Brooklyn Museum| accessdate=2014-08-01| publisher=Brooklyn Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum has posted many pieces to a digital collection online which features a user-based tagging system that allows the public to [[folksonomy|tag]] and curate sets of objects online, as well as solicit additional scholarship contributions.&lt;ref name=browse&gt;{{cite web| title=Collections: Browse Collections| url=https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/collections/| publisher=Brooklyn Museum| accessdate=2014-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Museum Education Fellowship Program is a ten-month position in which Fellows acquire theoretical and practical skills to lead K-12 school group visits with a focus on various topics from the collection.

School Youth and Family Fellows teach Gallery Studio Programs and School Partnerships while Adult and Public Programs Fellows curate and organize Thursday night as well as First Saturday Programming.

The museum has also received attention for its recent ASK App in which visitors can interface with staff and educators regarding works in the collection through a mobile application downloadable through the Apple and Google application stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/ask|title=Brooklyn Museum: ASK|website=www.brooklynmuseum.org|access-date=2017-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Populism"==
[[File:Brooklyn Museum - The Disciples Having Left Their Hiding Place Watch from Afar in Agony - James Tissot.jpg|thumb|[[James Tissot]], ''The Disciples Having Left Their Hiding Place Watch from Afar in Agony'', c. 1886-1894]]

Attendance at the Brooklyn Museum has been in decline in recent years, from a high "decades ago" of nearly one million visitors per year to more recent figures of 585,000 (1998) and 326,000 (2009).&lt;ref name="NYT1"&gt;{{cite news| last=Pogrebin| first=Robin| title=Brooklyn Museum's Populism Hasn't Lured Crowds| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/15/arts/design/15museum.html?pagewanted=all&amp;module=Search&amp;mabReward=relbias%3Aw%2C%7B%222%22%3A%22RI%3A17%22%7D&amp;_r=0| accessdate=2014-08-01| newspaper=The New York Times| date=June 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The New York Times'' attributed this drop partially to the policies instituted by current director Arnold Lehman, who has chosen to focus the museum's energy on "populism", with exhibits on topics such as "[[Star Wars]] movies and [[hip-hop]] music"&lt;ref name="NYT1" /&gt; rather than on more classical art topics. Lehman had also brought more controversial exhibits, such as a 1999 [[Sensation (exhibition)|show]] that included [[Chris Ofili]]'s infamous dung-decorated ''[[The Holy Virgin Mary]]'', to the museum.&lt;ref name="artinfo"&gt;{{cite web| last=Bell| first=Jennie| title=Arnold Lehman| url=http://www.blouinartinfo.com/news/story/24096/arnold-lehman/| work=BlouinArtInfo| publisher=blouinartinfo.com| accessdate=2016-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''Times'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;The quality of their exhibitions has lessened", said Robert Storr, the dean of the Yale University School of Art and a Brooklynite. "{{'}}''Star Wars''{{'}} shows the worst kind of populism. I don't think they really understand where they are. The middle of the art world is now in Brooklyn; it's an increasingly sophisticated audience and always was one.&lt;ref name="NYT1" /&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the other hand, Lehman points out that the demographics of museum attendees are showing a new level of diversity. According to ''The New York Times'', "the average age [of museum attendees in a 2008 survey] was 35, a large portion of the visitors (40 percent) came from Brooklyn, and more than 40 percent identified themselves as people of color." Lehman asserts that the museum's interest is in being welcoming and attractive to all  potential museum attendees, rather than simply amassing large numbers of them.&lt;ref name="NYT2"&gt;{{cite news| last=Lehman| first=Arnold| title=Response From the Director of the Brooklyn Museum| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/08/arts/design/08alsmail-BROOKLYNMUSEUM-LETTERS.html| accessdate=2014-08-01| newspaper=The New York Times| date=August 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Chetham Society''' "for the publication of remains historic and literary connected with the Palatine Counties of Lancaster and Chester" is a [[text publication society]] and [[registered charity]] (No. 700047){{r|CharityCommission}} established on 23 March 1843.

==History==
The Chetham Society is the oldest historical society in [[North West England]]. It was founded by a group of gentlemen (including the lawyer [[James Crossley (author)|James Crossley]] and the clergymen [[Thomas Corser]], [[Richard Parkinson (priest)|Richard Parkinson]], and [[Francis Robert Raines]]), who wished to promote interest in the counties' historical sources. The society held its foundation meeting on 23 March 1843 at [[Chetham's Library]], in [[Manchester]], which was established in 1653 by the will of the philanthropist [[Humphrey Chetham]]. The society became a registered charity in 1988.

The Chetham Society was amongst the earliest [[antiquarian]] and historical societies to be established in Britain during the nineteenth century, and appears to have been modelled, in part, on the Durham-based [[Surtees Society]] founded in 1834.{{sfnp|Levine|2003|p=42|ps=none}} During its early years, the Society enjoyed the support of patrons such as the Prime Minister of the day [[Robert Peel|Sir Robert Peel]], the [[John Sumner (bishop)|Bishop of Chester]], the Earls of [[James Lindsay, 24th Earl of Crawford|Balcarres]], [[William Cavendish, 7th Duke of Devonshire|Burlington]], and [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 13th Earl of Derby|Derby]], [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby|Lord Stanley of Bickerstaffe]], [[Francis Egerton, 1st Earl of Ellesmere|Lord Francis Egerton]], as well as several other peers and MPs who became members.{{sfnp|Hawkins|1844|ps=none}} Many distinguished historians and scholars have been involved in the life of the society, including [[John Eglington Bailey]], [[C. R. Cheney|Christopher Robert Cheney]], [[John Parsons Earwaker]], [[Edward Hawkins (numismatist)|Edward Hawkins]], [[Henry Hoyle Howorth]], [[George Ormerod]], [[Frederick Maurice Powicke]], [[William Stubbs]], [[Thomas Frederick Tout]], [[J. M. Wallace-Hadrill|John Michael Wallace-Hadrill]], and [[Joseph Brooks Yates]], amongst many others.{{r|Officers}}

==Membership==
Membership of the Chetham Society is open to all individuals and institutions interested in the various historical and literary aspects of Lancashire and Cheshire.

==Publications==
For more than 170 years, the Chetham Society has maintained a regular output of valuable works of scholarship that make significant contributions to the study of the history of [[North-West England]]. Since 1843, the society has published more than 275 volumes in three series.

'''Old Series (1843–93)'''

The Old Series (O.S.) ran from 1843 until 1893 (comprising 116 volumes). Publications included ''Pott’s Discovery of Witches'', ''Civil War Tracts'', and various diaries, journals, autobiographies, correspondence, [[Heraldic visitation|Heralds' visitations]], family deeds, papers, letters, and accounts, school registers and records, wills, and ecclesiastical and parish histories.

'''New Series (1883–1947)'''

The New Series (N.S.) commenced in 1883 and ended in 1947 (totalling 110 volumes). Publications covered a diversity of areas and topics, including charters, cartularies, rolls, rentals, surveys, autobiographical writings, biographies, genealogies, and various parish, town, and local histories.

'''Third Series (1948–present)'''

The Third Series (T.S.) began in 1948 (volume 51 was published in 2013). In recent years (particularly since the inauguration of the Third Series), the society's focus has tended to move away from its traditional role of publishing original [[Primary source|primary texts]] towards publishing scholarly [[Secondary source|secondary analyses]]. Recent volumes have included:

The '''citron''' (''Citrus medica'') is a large fragrant [[citrus]] fruit with a thick [[Peel (fruit)|rind]]. It is one of the original citrus fruits from which all other citrus types developed through natural [[hybrid speciation]] or artificial [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Klein, J. |date=2014 |title= Medicinal and Aromatic Plants of the Middle-East |chapter= Citron Cultivation, Production and Uses in the Mediterranean Region |publisher=Springer Netherlands |editor1=Z.

It is used widely in Asian cuisine, and also in traditional medicines, perfume, and for religious rituals and offerings.  Hybrids of citrons with other citrus are commercially prominent, notably [[lemon]]s and many [[Lime (fruit)|limes]].

== Etymology ==
The fruit's English name "citron" derives ultimately from Latin, ''citrus'', which is also the origin of the genus name.

=== Other languages ===
A source of confusion is that ''[[:wikt:citron|citron]]'' or similar words in [[French language|French]] (and other languages), and English are [[false friend]]s, as they refer to the [[lemon]]. Indeed, into the 16th century, the English name citron included the lemon and perhaps the lime as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oed.com/ |title=Home : Oxford English Dictionary|publisher=oed.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=November 2016|reason=link to home page instead of entry}} In Italian it is known as a cedro.

In [[Persian languages]], it is called ''Turunj'', as against "Naranj" (bitter orange); both names borrowed by [[Arabic]] and introduced into Spain and Portugal after their occupation by the Muslims in AD 711, whence it became the source of the name ''orange''. In [[Syria]] it is called ''Kabbad'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.plantlives.com/docs/C/Citrus_medica.pdf |format=PDF |title=Citrus medica |publisher=plantlives.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] it is called ''Bushukan'' (maybe referring only to the [[Fingered citron|fingered varieties]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.citrusvariety.ucr.edu/citrus/buddha.html |title=Buddha |publisher=University of California, Riverside}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Hebrew, the Citron is known as an אתרוג ("Etrog" or "Esrog").In [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] it is called as Bijora (બીજોરા).&lt;ref&gt;[http://kutchagricultureashapurafarm.com/bijora-citron/ Information about Citron on Kutch agriculture website  ]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gujaratilexicon.com/dictionary/gujarati-to-english/%e0%aa%ac%e0%aa%bf%e0%aa%9c%e0%ab%8b%e0%aa%b0%e0%ab%81%e0%aa%82*/ Gujarati Laxicon બિજોરું]&lt;/ref&gt;In Chinese, it is known as 香橼 ([[Pinyin]]: ''xiāngyuán'').

== Origin and distribution ==
The citron is an old and original citrus species. There is molecular evidence that most cultivated citrus species arose by [[Hybrid (biology)#Hybrid plants|hybridization]] of a small number of ancestral types, including citron, [[pomelo]], [[Mandarin orange|mandarin]] and to a lesser extent, [[Papeda (citrus)|papedas]] and [[kumquat]]. The citron is usually [[fertilized]] by [[self-pollination]].  This results in them displaying a high degree of genetic [[zygosity|homozygosity]], and it is the male parent of any citrus hybrid rather than a female one.&lt;ref name="HortScience 2005" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=E.

The citron is thought to have been native to [[India]],&lt;ref name="Talon" /&gt; in valleys at the foothills of the eastern [[Himalayas]]. It is thought that by the time of Theophrastus, the citron was mostly cultivated in the [[Persian Gulf]] on its way to the [[Mediterranean basin]], where it was cultivated during the later centuries in different areas as described by Erich Isaac.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Erich Isaac |title=The Citron in the Mediterranean: a study in religious influences |journal=Economic Geography |volume=35 |issue=1 |date=January 1959 |pages=71–78 |doi=10.2307/142080 |jstor=142080}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many mention the role of [[Alexander the Great]] and his armies as they attacked [[Achaemenid Empire|Persia]] and what is today [[Pakistan]], as being responsible for the spread of the citron westward, reaching the [[Europe]]an countries such as [[Greece]] and [[Italy]].&lt;ref name="Purdue Citron" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Simoons p.200"&gt;{{cite book |author=Frederick J.

=== Antiquity ===
{{See also|Etrog#Historic cultivation areas}}
Leviticus mentions the "fruit of the beautiful ('hadar') tree" as being required for ritual use during the [[Feast of Tabernacles]] ([http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0323.htm Lev. 23:40]). According to Rabbinical tradition, the "fruit of the tree hadar" refers to the citron, which the Israelites brought to [[Israel]] from their exile in [[Egypt]], where the [[Egyptologist]] and [[archaeologist]] [[Victor Loret]] claimed to have identified it depicted on the walls of the [[botanical garden]] at the [[Karnak Temple]], which dates back to the time of [[Thutmosis III]], approximately 3,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Scientific Committee, March 28, 1893: The Antiquity of the Citron in Egypt  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=21oCAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA3-PR20&amp;lpg=RA3-PR20&amp;dq=citron+persian+gulf&amp;source=web&amp;ots=klMYUN2T2j&amp;sig=yw8NWysVK3VgV0xYDCcmmdB9VK0#PRA3-PR20,M1 |journal=Journal of the Royal Horticultural Society |volume=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The citron has been cultivated since ancient times, predating the cultivation of other citrus [[species]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ramón-Laca |first=L. |title=The Introduction of Cultivated Citrus to Europe via Northern Africa and the Iberian Peninsula |journal=Economic Botany |date=Winter 2003 |volume=57 |issue=4 |pages=502–514 |url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/13685855/introduction-cultivated-citrus-europe-via-northern-africa-iberian-peninsula |doi=10.1663/0013-0001(2003)057[0502:tiocct]2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Theophrastus ===
The following description on citron was given by [[Theophrastus]]&lt;ref&gt;''Historia plantarum'' 4.4.2-3 (''exc.'' Athenaeus ''Deipnosophistae'' 3.83.d-f); cf. Vergil ''Georgics'' 2.126-135; Pliny ''Naturalis historia'' 12.15,16.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:A species of citrus fruit (Citrus sarcodactylis Hort. Bog.); Wellcome V0042687.jpg|thumb|Illustration of [[fingered citron]] with the leaves and thorns that are common to all varieties of citron.]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;In the east and south there are special plants... i.e. in Media and Persia there are many types of fruit, between them there is a fruit called Median or Persian Apple. The tree has a leaf similar to and almost identical with that of the ''andrachn'' (''[[Arbutus andrachne]]'' L.), but has [[Thorns, spines, and prickles|thorns]] like those of the ''[[apios]]'' (the wild [[pear]], '''Pyrus amygdaliformis''' Vill.) or the [[firethorn]] (''Cotoneaster pyracantha'' Spach.), except that they are white, smooth, sharp and strong. The fruit is not eaten, but is very fragrant, as is also the [[leaf]] of the tree; and the fruit is put among [[clothes]], it keeps them from being [[moth]]-eaten. It is also useful when one has drunk deadly poison, for when it is administered in [[wine]]; it upsets the [[stomach]] and brings up the poison. It is also useful to improve the [[breath]], for if one boils the inner part of the fruit in a dish or squeezes it into the mouth in some other medium, it makes the breath more pleasant.

The seed is removed from the fruit and sown in the [[Spring (season)|spring]] in carefully tilled beds, and it is watered every fourth or fifth day. As soon the plant is strong it is [[Transplanting|transplanted]], also in the spring, to a soft, well watered site, where the soil is not very fine, for it prefers such places.

And it bears its fruit at all [[season]]s, for when some have gathered, the flower of the others is on the tree and is ripening others. Of the [[flower]]s I have said&lt;ref&gt;''Historia plantarum'' 1.13.4.&lt;/ref&gt; those that have a sort of distaff [meaning the [[carpel|pistil]]] projecting from the middle are fertile, while those that do not have this are sterile. It is also sown, like [[date palm]]s, in pots punctured with holes.

This tree, as has been remarked, grows in ''Media'' and ''Persia''.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Pliny the Elder ===
Citron was also described by Pliny the Elder, who called it ''nata Assyria malus''. The following is from his book [[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;There is another tree also with the same name of "citrus," and bears a fruit that is held by some persons in particular dislike for its smell and remarkable bitterness; while, on the other hand, there are some who esteem it very highly. This tree is used as an ornament to houses; it requires, however, no further description.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Chap. 31.—The Citron-Tree |work=Perseus Digital Library |publisher=Tufts University |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D13%3Achapter%3D31}} excerpting from {{cite book |title=The Natural History. Pliny the Elder. |editor1=John Bostock |editor2=H.T. Riley, |location=London |publisher=Taylor and Francis |year=1855}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The citron tree, called the Assyrian, and by some the Median apple, is an antidote against poisons. The leaf is similar to that of the [[Arbutus|arbute]], except that it has small prickles running across it. As to the fruit, it is never eaten, but it is remarkable for its extremely powerful smell, which is the case, also, with the leaves; indeed, the odour is so strong, that it will penetrate clothes, when they are once impregnated with it, and hence it is very useful in repelling the attacks of noxious insects.

The tree bears fruit at all seasons of the year; while some is falling off, other fruit is ripening, and other, again, just bursting into birth. Various nations have attempted to naturalize this tree among them, for the sake of its medical properties, by planting it in pots of clay, with holes drilled in them, for the purpose of introducing the air to the roots; and I would here remark, once for all, that it is as well to remember that the best plan is to pack all slips of trees that have to be carried to any distance, as close together as they can possibly be placed.

It has been found, however, that this tree will grow nowhere except in Media or Persia. It is this fruit, the pips of which, as we have already mentioned, the [[Parthia]]n grandees employ in seasoning their [[ragout]]s, as being peculiarly conducive to the sweetening of the breath. We find no other tree very highly commended that is produced in Media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D12%3Achapter%3D7|title=Pliny the Elder, The Natural History, Book XII.

Citrons, either the pulp of them or the pips, are taken in wine as an antidote to poisons. A decoction of citrons, or the juice extracted from them, is used as a gargle to impart sweetness to the breath. The pips of this fruit are recommended for pregnant women to chew when affected with [[qualmishness]]. Citrons are good, also, for a weak stomach, but it is not easy to eat them except with [[vinegar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D23%3Achapter%3D56|title=Pliny the Elder, The Natural History, Book XXIII.

== Description and variation ==
[[File:Zitronatszitrone.jpg|thumb|A citron or [[citrus hybrid|citron-like hybrid]] of Italian origin (note the thick rind).]]

=== Fruit ===
The citron fruit is usually [[ovate]] or oblong, narrowing towards the [[Etrog#Pitom|stylar]] end. However, the citron's fruit shape is highly variable, due to the large quantity of [[Mesocarp#Mesocarp|albedo]], which forms independently according to the fruits' position on the tree, twig orientation, and many other factors. The rind is leathery, furrowed, and adherent. The inner portion is thick, white and hard; the outer is uniformly thin and very fragrant. The pulp is usually acidic, but also can be sweet, and even pulpless varieties are found.

Most citron varieties contain a large number of [[monoembryonic]] seeds. They are white, with dark innercoats and red-purplish [[chalazal spot]]s for the acidic varieties, and colorless for the sweet ones. Some citron varieties are also distinct, having  persistent [[carpel|styles]], that do not fall off after fecundation. Those are usually promoted for ''[[etrog]]'' use.

Some citrons have medium-sized oil bubbles at the outer surface, medially distant to each other. Some varieties are ribbed and faintly warted on the outer surface. There is also a fingered citron variety called [[Buddha's hand]].

The color varies from green, when unripe, to a yellow-orange when overripe. The citron does not fall off the tree and can reach 8–10 pounds (4–5&amp;nbsp;kg) if not picked before fully mature.&lt;ref&gt;''Un curieux Cedrat marocain'', Chapot 1950.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HortScience 2005"&gt;[http://grande.nal.usda.gov/ibids/index.php?mode2=detail&amp;origin=ibids_references&amp;therow=796030 The Search for the Authentic Citron: Historic and Genetic Analysis; ''HortScience'' '''40'''(7):1963–1968. 2005] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921214001/http://grande.nal.usda.gov/ibids/index.php?mode2=detail&amp;origin=ibids_references&amp;therow=796030 |date=September 21, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they should be picked before the winter, as the branches might bend or break to the ground, and may cause numerous fungal diseases for the tree.

Despite the wide variety of forms taken on by the fruit, citrons are all closely related genetically, representing a single species.&lt;ref name="Talon" /&gt;.&lt;ref name="Ramadugu"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Ramadugu | first1=Chandrika | last2=Keremane | first2=Manjunath L | last3=Hu | first3=Xulan | last4=Karp | first4=David | last5=Frederici | first5=Claire T | last6=Kahn | first6=Tracy | last7=Roose | first7=Mikeal L | last8=Lee | first8=Richard F. | title=Genetic analysis of citron (''Citrus medica'' L.) using simple sequence repeats and single nucleotide polymorphisms | journal=Scientia Horticulturae | volume=195 | pages=124-137 | year=2015 | url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304423815301692}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Genetic analysis has shown known cultivars to divide into three clusters, a Mediterranean cluster thought to have originated in India, and two clusters predominantly found in China, one representing the fingered citrons, and another consisting of non-fingered varieties.&lt;ref name="Ramadugu" /&gt;

=== Plant ===
[[File:Simanim.jpg|thumb|A pure citron, of any kind, has a large portion of [[Mesocarp#Mesocarp|albedo]], which is important for the production of ''Succade''.]]
''Citrus medica'' is a slow-growing [[shrub]] or small tree that reaches a height of about {{convert|8|to|15|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}. It has irregular straggling branches and stiff twigs and long [[spine (botany)|spines]] at the [[leaf]] [[axil]]s. The evergreen leaves are green and lemon-scented with slightly serrate edges, ovate-lanceolate or ovate elliptic 2.5 to 7.0&amp;nbsp;inches long. [[Petiole (botany)|Petioles]] are usually wingless or with minor wings. The clustered flowers of the acidic varieties are purplish tinted from outside, but the sweet ones are white-yellowish.
{{Citron varieties}}

The citron tree is very vigorous with almost no dormancy, blooming several times a year, and is therefore fragile and extremely sensitive to frost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lib.ucr.edu/agnic/webber/Vol1/Chapter4.html#acid |title=Website Disabled |publisher=University of California, Riverside |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308005736/http://lib.ucr.edu/agnic/webber/Vol1/Chapter4.html#acid |archivedate=2008-03-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Varieties and hybrids ===
The [[acid]]ic varieties include the [[Florentine citron|Florentine]] and [[Diamante citron]] from [[Italy]], the [[Greek citron]] and the [[Balady citron]] from [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ajit_Kandale/publication/234002705_A_review_on_citron-pharmacognosy_phytochemistry_and_medicinal_uses/links/0fcfd50e133856e8df000000.pdf | title=A review on citron-pharmacognosy, phytochemistry and medicinal uses |author1=Meena, Ajay Kumar |author2=Kandale, Ajit |author3=Rao, M.

Between the pulpless are also some [[Fingered citron|fingered]] varieties and the [[Yemenite citron]].

There are also a number of citron [[hybrid (biology)|hybrids]]; for example, [[ponderosa lemon]], the [[lumia (citrus)|lumia]] and [[rhobs el Arsa]] are known citron hybrids, some are claiming that even the [[Florentine citron]] is not pure citron, but a citron hybrid.

== Uses ==
=== Culinary ===
{{Main article|Succade}}
[[File:Halv sukat.JPG|thumb|A citron halved and depulped, cooked in sugar]]
[[File:Bicchiere di tassoni1.jpg|thumb|right|''Cedrata'', a citron soft drink from Italy]]
While the [[lemon]] or [[Orange (fruit)|orange]] are peeled to consume their pulpy and [[juice|juicy]] [[flavedo|segments]], the citron's pulp is dry, containing a small quantity of insipid juice, if any. The main content of a citron fruit is the thick white rind, which adheres to the segments and cannot be separated from them easily. The citron gets halved and depulped, then its rind (the thicker the better) is cut in pieces, cooked in sugar syrup, and used as a [[spoon sweet]], in Greek known as "kitro glyko" (κίτρο γλυκό), or it is diced and caramelized with sugar and used as a confection in cakes.
[[File:Citron cake.jpg|thumb|citron torte]]In Samoa a refreshing drink called "vai tipolo" is made from squeezed juice. It is also added to a raw fish dish called "oka" and to a variation of palusami or luáu.

Citron is a regularly used item in Asian cuisine. The variety of citron used in Japan, [[yuzu]], is juiced, and the juice is used regularly in dipping sauces, dressings and marinades. The juice is widely available bottled like lemon juice. Grated or shredded yuzu rind is also added to marinades and desserts, and hollowed out yuzu can be seen as decorative containers in higher end restaurants. In Korea, a popular tea, [[yuja-cha]], is made by mixing citron meat and julienned peels with sugar and honey. This tea is consumed both hot and iced, and is often taken for sore throats and colds in winter.

Today the citron is used for the [[fragrance]] or [[Zest (ingredient)|zest]] of its [[flavedo]], but the most important part is still the inner rind (known as [[pith]] or ''[[Fruit anatomy#Mesocarp|albedo]]''), which is a fairly important article in [[international trade]] and is widely employed in the food industry as [[succade]],&lt;ref name="Purdue Citron"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/morton/citron.html |title=Citron: ''Citrus medica'' Linn. |publisher=Purdue University}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cretancitron.gr/ The Citron in Crete] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930062855/http://www.cretancitron.gr/ |date=September 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vinetreeorchards.com/citron.htm |title=Candied Citron |publisher=Vine Tree Orchards}}&lt;/ref&gt; as it is known when it is candied in sugar.

The dozens of varieties of citron are collectively known as ''Lebu'' in [[Bengali cuisine|Bangladesh, West Bengal]], where it is the primary citrus fruit.

In Iran, the citron's thick white rind is used to make jam; in [[Pakistan]] the fruit is used to make jam but is also pickled; in [[South Indian cuisine]], some varieties of citron (collectively referred to as "Narthangai" in Tamil) are widely used in pickles and preserves. In [[Kutch]], Gujarat, it is used to make pickle, wherein entire slices of fruits are salted, dried and mixed with [[jaggery]] and spices to make sweet spicy pickle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bijora Pickle |url=http://www.jainworld.com/jainfoodrecipes/pic_bijora.asp |publisher=Jain World}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, citron is an important ingredient in holiday [[fruitcakes]].

=== Medicinal ===
From [[ancient]] through [[medieval]] times, the citron was used mainly for medical purposes: to combat [[seasickness]], [[pulmonary]] troubles, [[intestine|intestinal]] ailments, [[scurvy]] and other disorders. The [[essential oil]] of the [[flavedo]] (the outermost, pigmented layer of rind) was also regarded as an [[antibiotic]]. Citron juice with [[wine]] was considered an effective [[antidote]] to [[poison]], as [[Theophrastus]] reported. In the Ayurvedic system of medicine, the juice is still used for treating conditions like nausea, vomiting, and excessive thirst.

The juice of the citron has a high [[Vitamin C]] content and is used in the Indian system of medicine as an [[anthelmintic]], appetizer, tonic, in cough, rheumatism, vomiting, flatulence, haemorrhoids, skin diseases and weak eyesight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frlht.org/rasayana/matulunga |title=Matulunga (Citrus medica) |publisher=frlht.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224161117/http://www.frlht.org/rasayana/matulunga |archivedate=2013-12-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is an increasing market for the citron for the soluble fiber ([[pectin]]) found in its thick [[flavedo|albedo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

=== Religious ===
==== In Judaism ====
{{Main article|Etrog}}
The citron is used by Jews (the word for it in Hebrew is ''[[etrog]]'') for a religious [[ritual]] during the Jewish harvest holiday of Sukkot, the [[Feast of Tabernacles]]; therefore, it is considered to be a Jewish symbol, one found on various Hebrew antiques and archaeological findings.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Etrog]]&lt;/ref&gt; Citrons used for ritual purposes cannot be grown by grafting branches.
[[File:Buddhahand2.jpg|thumb|[[fingered citron|The Fingered Citron]]]]

==== In Buddhism ====
{{Main article|Buddha's hand}}
A variety of citron native to [[China]] has sections that separate into finger-like parts and is used as an [[offering (Buddhism)|offering]] in [[Buddhist]] temples.

=== Perfumery ===
For many centuries, citron's fragrant essential oil has been used in perfumery, the same oil that was used medicinally for its antibiotic properties. Its major constituent is [[limonene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Inouye, S. |author2=Takizawa, T. |author3=Yamaguchi, H. |year=2001 |title=Antibacterial activity of essential oils and their major constituents against respiratory tract pathogens by gaseous contact |journal=Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy |volume=47 |issue=5 |pages=565–573 |url=http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/content/47/5/565.abstract |doi=10.1093/jac/47.5.565 |pmid=11328766}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12956">{{DISPLAYTITLE:''De facto'' standard}}
A '''{{Lang|la|de facto}} standard'''&lt;!-- latin expression, please preserve italics --&gt; is a custom or [[Convention (norm)|convention]] that has achieved a dominant position by public acceptance or market forces (for example, by [[first-mover advantage|early entrance to the market]]). {{Lang|la|[[De facto]]}} is a Latin phrase [[wikt:de facto|that means]] ''in fact'' (literally by or from fact) in the sense of "in practice but not necessarily ordained by law" or "in practice or actuality, but not officially established", as opposed to {{Lang|la|[[de jure]]}}.

The term {{Lang|la|de facto}} standard is used in contrast with obligatory standards (also known as "{{lang|la|de jure}} standards"); or to express the dominant voluntary standard, when there is more than one standard available for the same use.

In [[social sciences]], a voluntary standard that is also a {{lang|la|de facto}} standard is a typical solution to a [[coordination problem]].&lt;ref name="Ulmann"&gt;{{cite book|author=Edna Ullmann-Margalit|title=The Emergence of Norms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9FLCBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA94|date=5 March 2015|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-106458-6|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; The choice of a ''de facto'' standard tends to be stable in situations in which all parties can realize mutual gains, but only by making mutually consistent decisions. In contrast, an enforced "{{Lang|la|de jure}} standard" is a solution to the [[prisoner's dilemma|prisoner's problem]].&lt;ref name="Ulmann" /&gt;

== Examples ==
A selection of well-known and illustrative examples of {{Lang|la|de facto}} and {{Lang|la|de jure}} standards are:

* with consolidation by [[tradition|tradition of use]]:
** The [[drive side|driver's seat side]] in a given country starts as a user/industry preference, turning to a local tradition, then a [[traffic code|traffic code local norm]].
** The [[QWERTY]] system was one of several options for the layout of letters on [[typewriter]] (and later [[keyboard (computing)|keyboard]]) keys.  It was developed to prevent adjacent keys from jamming on early and later mechanical typewriters, often attributed to the typist's speed.&lt;ref&gt;[[QWERTY]]&lt;/ref&gt; It became a {{Lang|la|de facto}} standard because it was used on the most commercially successful early typewriters and is now used on devices which have no moving parts such as [[touchscreen]]s.
** The [[MP3]] audio format started as an alternative to [[WAV]] for Internet music distribution, then replaced it&amp;nbsp;— it is now supported by the vast majority of music players, [[Portable media player|audio transport]], [[Media server|audio storage]] and noncommercial media. WAV and MP3 are also "{{Lang|la|de jure}} ISO formats".
* with consolidation by uniqueness and efficiency:
** [[HTML]] (computer file format) started as "{{Lang|la|de facto}}" (1993-1995) and became the "{{Lang|la|de jure}}" standard (1995–present day).
** [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] (computer file format) was first created in 1993 by [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]].  Adobe internal standards were part of its [[software quality]] systems, but they were neither published nor coordinated by a standards body.  With the [[Acrobat Reader]] program available for free, and continued support of the format, PDF eventually became the {{Lang|la|de facto}} standard for printable documents. In 2005, [[PDF/A]] became a [[de jure standard|&lt;span lang="la"&gt;''de jure''&lt;/span&gt; standard]] as [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 19005-1:2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=38920|title=ISO 19005-1:2005 - Document management -- Electronic document file format for long-term  preservation -- Part 1: Use of PDF 1.4 (PDF/A-1)|publisher=|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 Adobe's PDF 1.7 became [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 32000-1:2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=51502|title=ISO 32000-1:2008 - Document management -- Portable document format -- Part 1: PDF 1.7|publisher=|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.adobe.com/pdf/release_pdf_faq.html|title=Adobe - Release PDF for Industry Standardization FAQ|publisher=|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of long-time {{Lang|la|de facto}} but never {{Lang|la|de jure}} standards (for computer file formats):
* [[AutoCAD DXF]]: a {{Lang|la|de facto}} [[ASCII|ASCII format]] for import and export of [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] drawings and fragments in the 1980s and 1990s. In the 2000s, [[XML]] based standards emerged as {{Lang|la|de facto}} standards.
* [[Microsoft]] Word [[DOC (computing)|DOC]] (over all other old [[Word processor#History|PC word processors]]): one of the best known {{Lang|la|de facto}} standards. Due to the market dominance of Word, it is supported by all office applications that intend to compete with it, typically by [[reverse engineering]] the undocumented file format. Microsoft has repeatedly internally changed the file specification between versions of Word to suit their own needs, while continuing to reuse the same file extension identifier for different versions.
* [[FITS]] and [[Comma-separated values|CSV]] file formats, commonly used in science and engineering, with FITS traditionally used in [[astronomy]].
* [[TeX]] typesetting system, commonly used in creating scientific articles and reports for publication (in fact many journals require the publication to be fully written in TeX).

Other examples:
*Most American-made [[spark plugs]] require a {{frac|13|16}}-inch socket to remove or install. 
* The {{convert|1/2|in|mm|adj=on}} spacing of the rollers in a [[bicycle chain]].
* The [[IBM Personal Computer]] (PC). By one year after its 1981 release, [[John Dvorak]] described the PC as rapidly becoming a "{{Lang|la|de facto}} standard microcomputer".&lt;ref name="zussman19820823"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VDAEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA19&amp;pg=PA29#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true | title=Let's keep those systems open | work=InfoWorld | date=1982-08-23 | accessdate=29 January 2015 | author=Zussman, John Unger | pages=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the [[MS-DOS]] and [[Microsoft Windows]] [[operating system]]s, it gained a large share of the personal computer market. Because of the great [[influence of the IBM PC on the personal computer market]], competing products like the [[Rainbow 100]] were eventually withdrawn.
* Interpreted programming languages such as [[PHP]] that have multiple implementations tend to also have a {{Lang|la|de facto}} standard. In PHP's case the {{Lang|la|de facto}} standard is the binaries available from php.net, rather than the [[Phalanger (compiler)|Phalanger]] implementation for example.
* Use of programming languages [[R]] and [[Python (programming language)|Python]] in data science and other science disciplines, other than computer science, where automated analysis of data is required, without system being too complicated for a persons not being professionals.

Various connectors and interconnect standards - despite being formalized and standardized, almost no product is required by law or other legal standard to use them. Examples:
* [[Phone connector (audio)|Phone connector]] (3.5mm jack), [[RCA connector|RCA]] and [[XLR connector|XLR]] connectors, used in audio industry, for connecting audio equipment, headphones, mixing consoles, microphones (often with [[phantom power]] with 48 volts in most applications), stage lightning, etc.
* [[MIDI]] connection (using so called [[DIN connector]]), electrical and protocol standard for connecting musical instruments, synthesizers, drum machines, sequencers and some audio equipment, as well [[daisy chain (electrical engineering)|daisy chain]]ing them.
* [[DMX512]] (commonly just DMX) with [[XLR connector]] to control and sometimes power stage and venue lights, effects, smoke machines, laser projectors and sometimes pyrotechnics.
* [[PCI Express]] electrical and mechanical interface, and interconnect protocol used in PC computers, desktops, laptops, server, and industrial applications.
* [[GPIB]], also known as [[IEEE-488]], multi-device bus protocol, mechanical and electronic interface commonly found in electronic test equipment, i.e. digital [[multimeter]]s, [[oscilloscope|oscilloscopes]], initially created by Hewlett [[Hewlett-Packard]] as HP-IP. Commonly used with [[SCPI]] protocol.
* [[HDMI]], [[Display Port]], [[VGA]] for video, [[RS-232]] for low bandwidth serial communication.
* [[USB]] for high speed serial interface in computers and for powering or charging low power external devices (like mobile phones, headphones, portable hard drives) usually using micro USB plug and socket.
* [[Banana plugs]] in low frequency voltage and current measurements.
* [[BNC connector|BNC]] for medium frequency signal in electronic engineering testing (commonly used by signal generators, oscilloscopes, advanced multimeters and [[LCR meter|LCR meters]], [[Network analyzer (electrical)|vector network analysers]]) and sometimes in video signal (analog and digital) delivery between devices in studios and other professional settings. 
* [[AMP Incorporated|AMP]]'s AMP MATE-N-LOK / [[Molex connector|Molex]]'s Standard .093" Pin Power plug and socket, commonly used on hard drives, and other medium power devices both in PC, server, industrial applications, and others where standardized power connector for 5V and 12V is required, and off the shelf [[Power supply unit|PSU]] can be used. In embedded applications it is usually replaced with smaller square connector, that is easier to connect.
* 2.54mm (0.1 inch) pin spacing on many electronic components, including [[Dual in-line package|DIP]], [[Dual in-line- package#Single in-line|SIL]] packages, [[header connector]]s, and many more. The standard spacing enable use of these devices in prototyping boards and standardized sockets.
* [[4-20mA]] current loop standard used by sensors, transducers, amplifiers, transmission lines, control and measurement equipment.
* 3.5 inch and 2.5 inch (actual dimensions are different) hard drive standard sizes.
* [[19-inch rack]] standards for telecommunication, server, storage, audio, music, video and power equipment.
* [[ATX]] motherboard, back plane and power standards (but the intention of ATX design was to reduce number of standards, so it was not established by convention, but by biggest PC hardware and components manufacturers at the time).
* many more connectors and cables, like standardized ribbon cables medium speed and power connection between boards and devices; use of [[Registered jack|RJ45 jack]] in Ethernet switches for management purposes (instead of another de facto standard, [[RS-232]] connector); SD and microSD cards for removable storage in mobile applications like photo cameras, video recorders, phones; [[AA batteries]].

Materials and units of packaging:
* [[Solder|Soldering alloys]] in electronics, like Sn60Pb40.
* [[Aluminium alloy]]s, with most common being [[6061 aluminium alloy|6061]].
* Volumes, weights and quantities of common consumables usually follow round number of base legal units, i.e. in Europe milk is usually sold in 1 litter containers, and eggs are sold as quantity of 6.
* [[Intermodal container|Intermodal]] 48-foot container.

== Standards battles ==
There are many examples of {{Lang|la|de facto}} consolidation (of a standard) by market forces and [[Invisible hand|competition]], in a [[two-sided market]], after a [[format war|dispute]]. Examples:

* [[Alternating current]] over [[direct current]]: see [[War of the currents]].
* [[VHS]] over [[Betamax]] (see  [[videotape format war]]): when the VHS format for [[videotape]] recording was introduced, other recording formats were already available in the market. Regardless of whether Betamax was superior from a technical point of view or not, the VHS format won the [[format war]] due to superior marketing tactics by its proponents. The market could not support two competing formats; VHS became the {{Lang|la|de facto}} standard and Betamax was eventually withdrawn.
* [[Blu-ray]] over [[HD DVD]] (see [[high definition optical disc format war]]).

Examples of standards that are "in dispute" for turns {{Lang|la|de facto}}:
* [[OASIS (organization)|OASIS]]'s [[OpenDocument]] format (a {{Lang|la|de facto}} standard for [[Linux]] users ([[Apache OpenOffice]], [[LibreOffice]], [[Calligra]], [[KOffice]] et al. use it as default file format)) ''vs'' Microsoft's [[Office Open XML]] format (a {{Lang|la|de facto}} standard for [[MS-Windows]] and Mac users).
* [[Adobe Flash]] ''vs'' [[Scalable Vector Graphics]] (SVG), for [[vector graphics]] [[web page]] [[animation]]s.

&lt;!--some current states have no first recognition--&gt;

A '''declaration of independence''' or '''declaration of statehood''' is an assertion by a defined territory that it is [[independence|independent]] and constitutes a [[Sovereign state|state]]. Such places are usually declared from part or all of the [[Wiktionary: Territory|territory]] of another nation or failed nation, or are breakaway territories from within the larger state. In 2010, the UN's [[International Court of Justice]] ruled in [[International Court of Justice advisory opinion on Kosovo's declaration of independence|an advisory opinion in Kosovo]] that "International law contains no prohibition on declarations of independence",&lt;ref name="International Court of Justice"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/141/15987.pdf |title=Accordance with International Law of the Unilateral Declaration of Independence in Respect of Kosovo |publisher=Icj-cij.org |accessdate=2014-02-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5rRB9e3bz?url=http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/141/15987.pdf |archivedate=2010-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; though the state from which the territory wishes to secede may regard the declaration as [[rebellion]], which may lead to a [[war of independence]] or a constitutional settlement to resolve the crisis.

The '''Archives at the American Academy in Rome''' ('''AAR''') are [[digitized]] [[archaeological]] and photographic collections assisting in the preservation and conservation of the [[cultural heritage]] of [[Rome]].

==Background and history==

The rich cultural heritage of Rome compelled a group of American architects and artists led by architectural mogul Charles F. McKim to establish the American Academy in the city of Rome, Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=American Academy in Rome records, 1855-2012|url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/american-academy-rome-records-6320/more#page-top|publisher=Archives of American Art|accessdate=7 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Established in 1894, the American Academy in Rome is a research and arts institute and a member of the Council of American Overseas Research Centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CAORC|url=http://www.caorc.org/#!fellowships/c17cq|website=Council of American Overseas Research Centers|accessdate=7 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Academy promotes intellectual and artistic freedom, interdisciplinary exchange and innovation amongst scholars and artists at the institution and around the world. The School of Fine Arts, the first of the Academy's two main schools, exposes its fellows to literature, historic preservation and conservation, architecture, musical composition and the visual arts. Its counterpart, the School of Classical Studies, immerses scholars in Rome’s exquisite history and culture both modern and ancient, mainly in the fields of archaeology and the humanities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Mission|url=http://www.aarome.org/about/mission|publisher=American Academy in Rome|accessdate=7 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The United States Congress under President Roosevelt passed bills in 1905, marking the Academy as a national institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=American Academy in Rome records, 1855-2012|url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/american-academy-rome-records-6320/more#page-top|publisher=Archives of American Art|accessdate=7 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeological archives==

As an institution of the arts and classics, fellows at the Academy practice the study of archaeology. The American Academy in Rome has consolidated documents pertaining to archaeological excavations performed at the ancient colony of Cosa and the ancient Roman headquarters, the Regia. Some of these documents were digitized to preserve and disseminate their contents.

The ancient Latin colony of Cosa was located in southwestern Tuscany in Italy. The Regia was an ancient building that served initially as a royal palace to the kings of Rome and was subsequently occupied by the Pontifex Maximus, most notably Julius Caesar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Regia|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/romanforum/regia.html|publisher=Encyclopaedia Romana|accessdate=7 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cosa archaeology archives are a collection of documents pertaining to the excavations performed at the site by Frank E. Brown and Elizabeth Fentress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Research Archaeology Projects and Archive|url=http://www.aarome.org/research/archaeology-projects|publisher=American Academy in Rome|accessdate=7 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cosa collection consists of 1260 gelatin plates, 2500 film negatives and 13000 prints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Research|url=http://aarome.org/research|publisher=American Academy in Rome}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frank E. Brown again led the excavations of Regia’s Forum Romanum and left an archive consisting of photos, plans, notebooks, section and find cards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Research Archaeology Projects and Archive|url=http://www.aarome.org/research/archaeology-projects|publisher=American Academy in Rome|accessdate=7 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Regia collection consists of 70 contacts, 97 digital images, and 7 films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Research|url=http://aarome.org/research|publisher=American Academy in Rome|accessdate=7 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The physical archives of both Cosa and Regia excavations are safeguarded by the Academy. Photographs of the Cosa archives have been digitized, while the contents from Brown’s Regia physical archive were digitized in 2014. The digitized versions of the Cosa and Regia Archives are available in the Academy's Digital Humanities Center.

==Photographic archives==

The Photo Archive of the American Academy in Rome contains more than eighty thousand images. The Photo Archive consolidates various photographic images relating to the arts, architecture, archaeology, and history. Photos collected from various donors were digitized and made accessible to researchers and scholars around the world. The majority of the photographic images in the collection were amassed during the 19th century and 20th century. Only a few recent images portraying archaeological excavations and antiquities were obtained from the Vermeule, Aronson and Knauer, Ludwig and McCann collections&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Research about the Photo Archive|url=http://www.aarome.org/research/photo-archive/about|accessdate=7 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and added to the collection since the end of the twentieth century. The archaeology archives of Cosa and Regia were obtained as part of the McCann collection.

==Digitizing the archives==

The Digital Humanities Center employs Drupal software and ArchiveSpace for management of their data, which are then stored on the Academy's Fedora repository.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Digital Humanities Center|url=http://dhc.aarome.org/about|publisher=American Academy in Rome|accessdate=7 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ArchiveSpace enables the Academy to provide online access to their repository to researchers, scholars and artists worldwide. The Fedora Repository system allows for the management, dissemination and preservation of the Academy's digital contents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fedora|url=http://fedorarepository.org/about|accessdate=7 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Dixon v. Alabama''''', 294 [[Federal Reporter|F.2d]] 150 (5th Cir. 1961) was a landmark 1961 [[U.S. federal court]] decision that spelled the end of the doctrine that colleges and universities could act ''[[in loco parentis]]'' to discipline or expel their students.&lt;ref name=Hoover34&gt;{{Harv|Hoover|2008|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been called "the leading case on due process for students in public higher education".&lt;ref name=Smith484&gt;{{Harv|Smith|2008|p=484}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case arose when [[Alabama State University|Alabama State College]], a then-segregated [[historically black colleges and universities|black college]], expelled six students, including the named appellant, [[St. John Dixon]], for unspecified reasons, but presumably because of their participation in demonstrations during the [[Civil Rights Movement]].  The college, acting ''in loco parentis'', expelled them without a hearing.  The case was appealed to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit|Fifth Circuit]], which held that a public college could not expel students without at least minimal due process.&lt;ref name=Hoover34/&gt;

The case was heard by a panel of [[John Minor Wisdom]], [[Richard Rives]], and [[Benjamin Franklin Cameron]].  Cameron dissented from the opinion of the court.

[[Thurgood Marshall]], [[Fred Gray (attorney)|Fred Gray]], [[Derrick Bell]] and [[Jack Greenberg (lawyer)|Jack Greenberg]] were among the counsel for the appellants.&lt;ref name=Smith484/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/294/150/346079/ |title=  St. John Dixon et al., Appellants, v.

The '''Essex Institute Historic District''' is a historic district at 134-132, 128, 126 Essex Street and 13 Washington Square West in [[Salem, Massachusetts]].  It consists of a compact group of properties associated with the [[Essex Institute]], founded in 1848 and merged in 1992 into the [[Peabody Essex Museum]].  Listed by increasing street number, they are: the [[Crowninshield-Bentley House]], the [[Gardner-Pingree House]] (a [[National Historic Landmark]]), the [[John Tucker Daland House]], and the [[Phillips Library (Salem, Massachusetts)|Phillips Library]] (the latter two are physically connected).  The [[John Ward House (Salem, Massachusetts)|John Ward House]], which fronts on Brown Street but shares the 132 Essex Street address, is another National Historic Landmark within the district.  The [[Andrew Safford House]] at 13 Washington Square West, built in 1819, was said to be the most expensive home in New England at the time.&lt;ref name=NRHP&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mhc-macris.net/Details.aspx?MhcId=SAL.HQ|title=NRHP nomination for Essex Institute Historic District|publisher=Commonwealth of Massachusetts|accessdate=2014-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The principal buildings of the district are the Daland House and the Phillips Library, the latter of which was the main Essex Institute building.  The Daland House was built in 1851, the Library in 1857, and the combination now serve as the library and research facility of the Peabody Essex Museum.  The Library is a two-story building, although the second floor is two normal stories high (with suitably large windows), and originally served as exhibition space.&lt;ref name=NRHP/&gt;

The area behind the Phillips Library and south of Brown Street is a garden area that includes two other historical structures: the Vaughan Doll House, a modest late 17th century one-room structure that may have been a Quaker meeting house, and the Lyle-Tapley Shoe Shop.  They both stand near the John Ward House, which faces into the garden as well.&lt;ref name=NRHP/&gt;

Just to the east of the Daland House stands the Gardner-Pingree House, an elegant Federal mansion built in 1804 by noted Salem architect [[Samuel McIntire]].  To its east, at the corner of Essex and Washington Square West, stands the Bentley-Crowninshield House, a c. 1727 Georgian house that was relocated from a site across Essex Street in 1860.  The Andrew-Safford House is behind the Bentley-Crowninshield House, facing Salem Common.&lt;ref name=NRHP/&gt;

The district was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1972;&lt;ref name="nris"/&gt; all of the properties in the district were also included in the [[Salem Common Historic District (Salem, Massachusetts)|Salem Common Historic District]] in 1976.

On December 8, 2017, much to the happiness of Salem residents, Dan L. Monroe, PEM's Rose-Marie and Eijk van Otterloo Director and CEO, issued a press release announcing that the 42,000 linear feet of historical documents will be permanently relocated to Rowley, MA and Plummer Hall and Daland House, the two historic buildings which had housed the Phillips Library, will be utilized as office and meeting space.&lt;ref name=PEMPR&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pem.org/press-news/statement-regarding-pems-phillips-library|title=Statement Regarding PEM Phillips Library |publisher=Peabody Essex Museum|accessdate=2017-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Foreign Relations of the United States''''' ('''''FRUS''''') is a book series published by the [[Office of the Historian]] in the [[United States Department of State]]. The series presents the official documentary historical record of major U.S. foreign policy decisions and significant diplomatic activity. The series began in 1861 and now comprises more than 450 individual volumes. The volumes published over the last two decades increasingly contain declassified records from all the foreign affairs agencies.

==Overview==
''Foreign Relations'' volumes contain documents from [[Presidential libraries]], Departments of [[United States Department of State|State]] and [[United States Department of Defense|Defense]], [[National Security Council]], [[Central Intelligence Agency]], [[Agency for International Development]], and other foreign affairs agencies as well as the private papers of individuals involved in formulating [[U.S. foreign policy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Office of the Historian |url= http://www.history.state.gov |publisher= [[United States Department of State|state.gov]] |accessdate= 20 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Volumes in the series since 1952 are organized chronologically according to Presidential administrations, and geographically and topically within each subseries: 25 volumes cover the [[Kennedy administration]] (1961–63), 34 cover the [[Presidency of Lyndon B. Johnson|Johnson administration]] (1964–68), and about 54 are scheduled for the [[Nixon administration|Nixon]] and [[Ford administration|Ford administration]] administrations (1969–76). Volumes on the [[Carter administration]] are now being published and volumes on the [[Reagan administration]] are now being researched and annotated.

Prior to 1970, the series was published under various names. From 1870 to 1947, the uniform title ''Papers Relating to the Foreign Relations of the United States'' was used. From 1947 to 1969, the name was changed to ''Foreign Relations of the United States: Diplomatic Papers''. After that date, the current name was adopted.

It has had numerous subseries, appendices, microfiche supplements, etc. over the years as warranted. Indexes were issued covering the years 1861–99 and 1900–18.

==E-books==
The Office of the Historian offers [[e-book]] editions of a growing number of volumes from the series. Far lighter and more portable than printed editions of FRUS, the e-book edition offers the full content of each volume and makes use of the full-text search and other reading features of most e-book devices and applications, including bookmarking and note-taking. Unlike the web-based edition of FRUS, the e-book edition, once downloaded, can be accessed even without internet connectivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Historical Documents » E-Books |url= https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/ebooks |accessdate= 20 November 2013 |publisher= [[Office of the Historian|history.state.gov]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Citation information==
The title ''Foreign Relations of the United States'' is commonly abbreviated as ''FRUS'' in citations and the volume number written as a [[Roman numeral]].  The series is categorized by year and region, such as 1936, Volume II, Europe.

&lt;!-- TODO: Summarize/paraphrase most of the quotes in this paragraph, to wit: the CIA doesn't like having its record of atrocities made public, even 30 years later. --&gt;
In a 2013 report on the status of the ''Foreign Relations'' series, Richard Immerman, Chairman of the Office of the Historian's Historical Advisory Council, stated that "Because the Foreign Relations series serves as the primary venue for publishing documentation on the role of intelligence activities in U.S. foreign relations, it has become renowned internationally for its openness. This universal acclaim well serves America’s national interest," but added, "This barometer of openness, however, has created substantial delays in the declassification and publication processes over which HO has limited control."&lt;ref&gt;[http://h-net.msu.edu/cgi-bin/logbrowse.pl?trx=vx&amp;list=H-Diplo&amp;month=1307&amp;week=a&amp;msg=cIlRUgpujthkoAg5cDnbug]&lt;/ref&gt; To that end, N. Richard Kinsman has cited "serious, cumulative, and long-term deleterious effects on the [[Central Intelligence Agency|Agency]] as a result of specific citations by name to CIA in the FRUS" and that "Explicit FRUS citations of CIA activities in specific countries constitute de facto admission of a CIA presence abroad, a direct contradiction of current policy to deny an official CIA presence abroad."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/winter_spring01/article07.pdf Openness and the Future of the Clandestine Service], ''[[Studies in Intelligence]]'' Winter-Spring 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Warren F. Kimball in rebuttal cited the unlikelihood of documents 30+ years old after being properly vetted prior to publication posing any risk.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/winter_spring01/article08.pdf Openness and the CIA], ''Studies in Intelligence'' Winter-Spring 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rhee Syng-Man in 1956.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Syngman Rhee (1875-1965), Korean leader from 1948 to 1960, was the chief advocate and political beneficiary of the One-People Principle.]]

'''Ilminism''' ({{ko-hhrm|일민주의|一民主義|Ilminjuui}};), frequently translated as the '''One-People Principle''', was the [[ideology|political ideology]] of [[South Korea]] under its first President, [[Syngman Rhee]]. The ''Ilmin'' principle has been likened by contemporary scholars to the [[Nazism|Nazi German]] idea of the ''[[Master race|herrenvolk]]'' (master race), and was part of an effort to consolidate a united and obedient citizenry around Rhee's strong central leadership through appeals to [[nationalism]] and ethnic supremacy.

The concept of the One-People Principle was developed primarily by Minister of Education [[An Ho-sang]], who studied philosophy at the [[University of Jena]] in Germany during the late 1920s.

==Ideology==

The One-People Principle has been likened to the German [[ideology]] of the ''[[Master race|herrenvolk]]'' (master race), constituting an effort to build a loyal and obedient citizenry through [[ethnicity|ethnic]] homogeneity and brazen appeals to [[nationalism]].&lt;ref name=Hwang93&gt;Su-kyoung Hwang, ''Korea's Grievous War.'' Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2016; pg. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea for a Korean adaptation of this Germanic idea emerged from the works of philosopher [[An Ho-sang]], the Minister of Education under [[Syngman Rhee]],&lt;ref name=Hwang93 /&gt; who studied at the [[University of Jena]] in Germany during the late 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Vladimir Tikhonov and Pak Noja, "Social Darwinism as History and Reality: 'Competition' and 'The Weak' in Early Twentieth-Century Korea," ''Critical Asian Studies,'' vol. 48, no. 3 (2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Ilmin'' Principle became the central ideology of Rhee's [[National Society (Korea)|National Society]] and its successor, the [[Liberal Party (South Korea)|Liberal Party]], established in 1951.&lt;ref name=Hwang93 /&gt;

The One-People Principle was based around a four-point political program, including elimination of formal discrimination between the nobility and the masses, the economic equalization of rich and poor through land reform, social and political equality of the sexes, and an end to discrimination between North and South or the urban capital and the rural provinces.&lt;ref name=Hwang93 /&gt; An end to partisan politics was posited, in favor of a united people behind a de facto one-party state.&lt;ref name=Hwang93 /&gt;

The [[egalitarianism|egalitarian]] theoretical underpinnings of the One-People Principle, heralding a classless society of gender equality under firm central leadership, proved to be utopian, with Rhee emerging in practice as head of a semi-[[fascist]] dynasty on the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese model]], remade with Rhee in the role of an emperor.&lt;ref name=Hwang93 /&gt;

''Ilminism'' was effective in creating a strong [[anti-Communist]] nationalism to stand in juxtaposition to the effective appeals to nationalism make through the [[Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland]], headed by [[Kim Il Sung]] and the [[Communism|communist]] [[Workers' Party of Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;Hwang, ''Korea's Grievous War,'' pg. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;{{ISBN missing|date=October 2016}}

'''In re McUlta''', [[Legal citation|189 F. 250]] (M.D. Pa. 1911), is one of several [[precedent]]-setting [[United States federal courts|US federal court]] rulings that clearly defined and established [[common law]] [[name change]]s as a legal right.

The case stems from a person moving from [[New York (state)|New York]] State to [[Pennsylvania]]. In Pennsylvania, he assumed, by common law, at will, the name of "J. D. McUlta", and then went [[bankrupt]] after several years of doing business under that name.

The ruling states that even if a court is granted permission to change a name by petition and decree, that permission does "not change the common-law rule that a man may lawfully change his name at will and will be bound by any contract into which he enters under his adopted or reputed name, and that he may sue and be sued in that name". Explicitly, a common law name change carries the same legal weight as a court-decreed name change. The ruling also uses [[term of art]] "at will", clarifying that common law allows name changes "at will" and no court-issued order of name change is required.

This case is also precedent that a person's name is irrelevant in regard to  the person; rather, it only ''indicates'' the person. One may change one's name by common law, but the existence of that person does not change:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This exception charges the bankrupt with fraud in obtaining the goods and merchandise purchased, in that he did not inform his creditors of his right name, and therefore he did not obtain title to the goods which he claims as exempt. We dismiss this exemption. A name is used merely to designate a person or thing. It is the mark or indica to distinguish him from other persons, and that is as far as the law looks. In re Snook, supra; [[Rich v. Mayer]] (City Ct. N. Y.) 7 N. Y. Sup. 69, 70. They are merely used as means of indicating identity of persons. [[Meyer v. Indiana National Bank]] 27 Ind. App. 354, 61 N. E. 596. There is nothing in the evidence to show that any fraud was committed by the bankrupt in purchasing the goods. They were sold to him under his assumed name (the creditors never knew until after the institution of bankruptcy proceedings and the adjudication, that the bankrupt was doing business under an assumed name;) and he took title of the goods and could have disposed of them under his assumed name and given a good title to the same. Credit in this case was given to the man—not the name—and that man was J. D. McUlta.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

If you're thinking of blanking this page: don't. It's been done. Nobody will laugh. We probably won't even be motivated enough to block you from editing, it will be treated as vandalism, but don't count on that.

--&gt;
An '''intentionally blank page''' or '''vacat page''' (from Latin: ''vacare'' for "being empty") is a [[page (paper)|page]] that is devoid of content and may be unexpected. Such pages may serve purposes ranging from place-holding to space-filling and content separation. Sometimes, these pages carry a notice such as "'''This page''' [is] '''intentionally left blank.'''" Such notices typically appear in printed works, such as legal documents, manuals, and exam papers, in which the reader might otherwise suspect that the blank pages are due to a [[printing]] error and where missing pages might have serious consequences.

==Uses for intentionally blank pages==
[[File:AEC blank page.png|250px|left|thumb|An intentionally blank page on a PDF document from the [[Australian Electoral Commission]]. The document has 80 printable pages, and content ends on page 77.]]

Intentionally blank pages are usually the result of printing conventions and techniques. Chapters conventionally start on an odd-numbered page ([[Recto and verso|recto page]]); therefore, if the preceding chapter happens to have an odd number of pages, a blank page is inserted at the end. Book pages are often printed on large sheets because of technical and financial considerations. Thus, a group of 8, 16, or 32 consecutive pages will be printed on a single sheet in such a way that when the sheet is mechanically folded and cut, the pages will be in the correct order for binding. This is called an [[even working]], and the group of pages is called a section or '''signature'''. Books printed in this manner will always have a number of pages that is a multiple of the number in such a signature, such as a multiple of 8, 16, or 32. As a result, these books will usually have pages left blank, unless by chance or editorial ingenuity the exact number of pages are printed.

For example, if a book with 318 pages of content is printed using 32-page signatures, it will require 10 signatures, 320 pages in total.  At the very end of the book — that is, at the end of the last signature — there will be 2 unused (blank) pages.

If a printer's document processor has been designed to skip completely blank pages, notices may also be required on intentionally blank pages to prevent incorrect [[page numbering]].

Intentionally blank pages are ubiquitous in technical and instructional manuals, directories, and other large, mass-produced volumes of text. The contents of manuals produced by a given product's vendor are often compiled from generic instructions suitable for a variety of products, with additional instructions or chapters included for the specific product or model in question. This automation of manual generation leads to intentionally blank pages to fit the requirements for mass printing.

In digital documents, pages are intentionally left blank so that the document can be printed correctly in double-sided format, rather than have new chapters start on the backs of pages. Intentionally blank pages have also been used in documents distributed in [[ring binder]]s. The intention is to leave room for expansion without breaking the document's page numbering. This allows updates to be made to a document while requiring minimal new pages, reducing printing costs. The only drawback is the increased time required by the reader to manually insert various newly updated pages into their correct locations in the document.

===Standardized tests===
[[File:No test material on this page.svg|thumb|right|250px|Intentionally blank page in the style used in [[standardized test]]s]]
Intentionally blank pages can be useful in [[standardized test]]s such as the [[GCSE]], [[Higher School Certificate (New South Wales)|Higher School Certificate]], [[SAT]], [[Common Admission Test|CAT]], [[ACT (examination)|ACT]], [[MCAT]], and [[Graduate Record Examination|GRE]]. In these exams, there are often individual, timed sections in which test-takers are prohibited from proceeding to the next section until that section's time interval has passed and the examiner allows them to continue. Because all of these separate sections are printed consecutively in the examination booklet, it may be possible for a test-taker who has finished the section early to see through the page and read the problems in the next section. By placing intentionally blank pages between these sections, the test-taker is prevented from cheating in this way. By printing a notice on the page, such as "this page has been intentionally left blank", test-takers will not be concerned that their test has been misprinted, especially as test instructions often instruct students to check for missing or blank pages and to report any defective test booklets to a proctor. These pages may also be useful as [[scratch paper]].

===Sheet music===
In books of [[sheet music]], relatively short pieces of music that span two to four pages often need to be arranged so the number of page turns for the performer is minimized. For example, a three-page work (starting on the left-hand sheet) followed immediately by a two-page work involves one page turn during each work. If a blank page immediately followed the three-page work (on the right-hand sheet), the two-page work will span the left and right pages, alleviating the need for a page turn during the second work. Intentionally blank pages may also prevent a page turn during a difficult passage.

===Classified documents===
In the United States armed forces, classified{{how?|date=July 2017}} documents require page checks whenever custody is transferred or an inventory is conducted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chaney |first=Scott |title=NAVEDTRA 14127: Intelligence Specialist 3 &amp; 2, Volume 1 |work=Non-Resident Course |publisher=Naval Education and Training Professional Development and Technology Center ([[United States Navy]]) |url=http://www.militarynewbie.com/pubs/NAVEDTRA%2014127%20-%20Intelligence%20Specialist%203%20&amp;%202,%20Volume%201.pdf |date=November 1996 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714094003/http://www.militarynewbie.com/pubs/NAVEDTRA%2014127%20-%20Intelligence%20Specialist%203%20%26%202%2C%20Volume%201.pdf |archivedate=14 July 2011 |accessdate=24 June 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Blank pages are all marked "This page intentionally left blank", so page checks are unambiguous, and every page of the document is accounted for.

==Variations==
Intentionally blank pages placed at the end of books are often used to balance the [[Bookbinding|folio]]s that make up the book (see [[bookbinding]]). Often these pages are completely blank with no such statement or are used as "Notes" pages, serving a practical purpose. In the case of [[telephone directory|telephone-number directories]], these pages are often used to list important numbers and addresses.  These pages may list other books available from the same publisher.

Book publishers have also used stylized designs ([[dingbat]]s) underneath the last paragraph of a chapter to indicate that no other content is to be expected until the next chapter, allowing for the possibility of blank pages without misunderstandings by the readers.

There are also published books that, as a novelty, [[empty book|contain nothing but blank pages]].

==Examples==
*[[Andy Griffiths (author)|Andy Griffiths]]' book ''[[Just Stupid!]]'' begins with a cartoon snail saying to the reader, "This page would be blank if I were not here telling you that this page would be blank if I were not here telling you that..." on an endless loop.
*Humorist [[Don Novello]]'s 1977 book ''The Lazlo Letters'' ends with several otherwise-blank pages marked "FREE PAPER!".{{Verify source|date=February 2011}}
*Comedian [[Demetri Martin]]'s book ''This Is A Book'' contains an otherwise blank page which says, "This page unintentionally left blank."
*[[List of Iranian writers|Iranian novelist]] [[Reza Amirkhani]]'s book ''Man-e-oo'' (His Ego) has one whole chapter of blank pages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ermia.ir/contents.aspx?id=762 |title= آن چه در وب راجع به من او نوشته‌اند (۱۵)  (What has been written about ''Man-e-oo'' on the web (15)|last1= Amirkhani|first1= Reza |date= 18 February 2012 |website= Reza Amirkhani's Official Website |accessdate=11 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The phrase was a recurring joke in [[Infocom]] text adventure games. In their first title, ''[[Zork 1]]'', inspecting an engraved wooden door resulted in the text: "The engravings translate to 'This space intentionally left blank'."
*[[Idries Shah]]'s book ''[[The Book of the Book]]'' contains 10 pages describing why the following pages are important, and then a big amount of blank pages. Its main purpose is to demonstrate the theory that you shouldn't judge the content by its container.&lt;ref name="The book at google books."&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shah|first1=Idries|title=The book of the book.|date=1969|publisher=Octagon Pr.|location=London|isbn=9780900860126|edition=4. impr.|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=WviNfB2q_oEC&amp;pg=PP3&amp;dq=shah+The+Book+of+the+Book&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAGoVChMI95nJ-LeIxgIV727bCh3AvQCO#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=1 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of December 2014, [[Moz (marketing software)|Moz]] had assigned Jasmine Directory a Domain Authority of 60/100, a Page Authority of 67/100, MozRank of 6.81, and a MozTrust of 6.64.

According to information posted on the ''Social Implications'' blog, Jasmine Directory appeared to be compliant with [[Google]]'s general guidelines as of February 2018.&lt;ref name="SocialImplications" /&gt; Essentially, this means that they use editorial discretion to permit or deny which businesses they allow in their directory listings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.business2community.com/public-relations/easy-hacks-to-get-exposure-for-your-business-02079701 |title=Easy Hacks to Get Exposure For Your Business |work=Business 2 Community |author=Elijah Masek-Kelly |date=June 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the ''[[Daily News Egypt]]'' found the directory to follow "the rules set forth by Google".&lt;ref name="DailyNewsEgypt" /&gt; Ann Smarty, search marketer and columnist at ''[[Entrepreneur (magazine)|Entrepreneur]]'', found the directory provided a "valuable user experience".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seochat.com/c/a/link-trading-help/high-quality-directories-add-value-web/ |title=High-Quality Directories and How They Add Value to the Web |work=SEO Chat |accessdate=9 July 2017 |quote=Below I am listing selected directories that are still driving value to your website (if you are listed there) but more importantly, provide valuable user experience.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, Shawn Hessinger, an industry-specific author and the executive editor of ''Small Business Trends'', praised the directory as "selective",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hessinger|first1=Shawn|title=Where Can You Advertise for Free? - Small Business Trends|url=https://smallbiztrends.com/2018/04/can-advertise-free.html|website=Small Business Trends|accessdate=19 May 2018|date=24 April 2018|quote=Jasmine Directory is a selective directory that can take up to 24 hours for to decide whether to include your business.}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in a more mixed review, an editor of ''[[TNT (magazine)|TNT]]'' labelled it as "very traditional" and "tad simplistic" with an "old looking interface".&lt;ref name="TNT-Magazine" /&gt; An article published by ''[[The New Indian Express]]'' noted that "while Jasmine Directory's layout it's beginning to age, it still looks fresh and clean."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/business/2018/may/31/a-long-time-ago-in-an-internet-far-far-away-1821985.html |title=A long time ago in an internet far far away... |work=The New Indian Express |date=31 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leo Giosuè from ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'' named Jasmine Directory as "one of the most prominent directories in the industry."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.jpost.com/Jpost-Tech/Business-and-Innovation/Why-Local-Businesses-Need-to-be-Active-Globally-559863 |title=Why Local Businesses Need to be Active Globally? |work=The Jerusalem Post |last=Giosuè |first=Leo |date=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Matt Hodgson, owner of Addme, a SEO company founded in 1996, opines that "when done the right way, directories such as Jasmine Directory are far more reliable than a typical search engine result because they are edited by real people who go through every link to determine whether it provides any relevant information."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abcmoney.co.uk/2018/06/07/28-million-small-businesses-in-america-account-for-54-of-all-u-s-sales/ |title=28 million small businesses in America account for 54% of all U.S. sales |work=ABC Money |date=June 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also gave the directory a grade A, pointing that Jasmine Directory is "more user oriented in so many ways and Google compliant as well."&lt;ref name="addme" /&gt;

In Islam, Jesus is believed to have been the precursor to [[Muhammad]], attributing the name [[Ahmad]] to someone who would follow him. Islam [[Islamic view of the Trinity|rejects the divinity of Jesus]] and teaches that Jesus was not [[Incarnation (Christianity)|God incarnate]], nor the [[Son of God]], and—according to some interpretations of the Quran—the [[crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]], [[Islamic view of Jesus' death|death]] and [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]] is not believed to have occurred, and rather that God saved him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lawson|first=Todd|date=1 March 2009|title=The Crucifixion and the Quran: A Study in the History of Muslim Thought|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=C1cQBwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA14|location=|publisher=Oneworld Publications|page=14|isbn=1851686355}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the earliest Muslim traditions and exegesis quoting somewhat conflicting reports regarding a death and its length, the mainstream Muslim belief is that Jesus did not physically die, but was instead [[ascension of Jesus|raised alive to heaven]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zahniser|first=Mathias|date=30 October 2008|title=The Mission and Death of Jesus in Islam and Christianity (Faith Meets Faith Series)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VxAZBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT55|location=New York|publisher=Orbis Books|page=55|isbn=1570758077}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=iJmcAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT61 Parrinder 1965, p. 61].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Birth of Jesus==
[[File:MaryLineage.JPG|thumb|260px|Jesus' lineage, going back to his great-grandfather]]
{{Main|Nativity of Jesus}}
{{See also|Maryam (sura)|Islamic views of Mary}}
The account of Jesus begins with a prologue narrated several times in the Quran first describing the birth of his mother, Mary, and her service in the [[Jerusalem]] [[temple]], while under the care of the prophet and [[priest]] [[Zechariah (priest)#In Islam|Zechariah]], who was to be the father of [[John the Baptist#Islam|John the Baptist]]. The birth narrative in the Quran for Jesus begins at [[Maryam (surah)|Maryam (19)]] 16-34 and [[al-Imran (surah)|al-Imran (3)]] 45-53.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_qxlAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=fnd&amp;pg=PA18|title=Muslim-Christian Encounters (Routledge Revivals): Perceptions and Misperceptions|first=William Montgomery|last=Watt|date=19 December 2013|publisher=Routledge|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; The birth narrative has been recounted with certain variations and detailed additions by Islamic historians over the centuries.

While Islamic theology affirms Mary as a pure vessel regarding the [[virgin birth of Jesus]], it does not follow the concept of [[Immaculate Conception]] as related to Mary's birth in some Christian traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Cleo McNelly Kearns. (2008), [https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Virgin_Mary_Monotheism_and_Sacrifice.html?id=HzSQ7zjWtcgC&amp;redir_esc=y ''The Virgin Mary, Monotheism and Sacrifice''], New York: Cambridge University Press, p. 254–5&lt;/ref&gt;

===Annunciation===
{{See also|Annunciation}}
Islamic exegesis affirms the virginal birth of Jesus similarly to the Gospel account and occurring in Bethlehem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_qxlAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=fnd&amp;pg=PA19|title=Muslim-Christian Encounters (Routledge Revivals): Perceptions and Misperceptions|first=William Montgomery|last=Watt|date=19 December 2013|publisher=Routledge|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; The narrative of the virgin birth is an announcement to Mary by the angel [[Gabriel]] while Mary is being raised in the [[Second Temple|Temple]] after having been pledged to God by her mother. Gabriel states she is honored over all women of all nations and has brought her glad tidings of a holy son.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Khalidi|first=Tarif|author-link=Tarif Khalidi|date=2001|title=The Muslim Jesus: Sayings and Stories in Islamic Literature |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pE57rmPaM58C&amp;printsec=fnd&amp;pg=PA51|location=Cambridge, Mass., and London|publisher=Harvard University Press|pages=51–94|isbn=0674004779}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[hadith]] narrated by [[Abu Hurairah]] (d. 681), an early [[Sahabah|companion of Muhammad]], quotes Muhammad explaining that both Jesus and Mary were protected from Satan's touch at birth; a quoting of the Quran verse al-Imran (3) 36.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=iJmcAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT19.5 Parrinder 1965, p. 31].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Annunciation (in Islam).jpg|thumb|left|Annunciation in miniature]]
The angel declares the son is to be named Jesus, the Messiah, proclaiming he will be called a great prophet, and is the ''Spirit of God'' and ''Word of God'', who will receive [[Gospel in Islam|al-Injīl]] (Arabic for the [[The gospel|Gospel]]). The angel tells Mary that Jesus will speak in infancy, and when mature, will be a companion to the most righteous. Mary, asking how she could conceive and have a child when no man had touched her, was answered by the angel that God can decree what He wills, and it shall come to pass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=IEUdCgAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA33|title=Images of Jesus Christ in Islam: 2nd Edition|first=Oddbjørn|last=Leirvik|date=25 March 2010|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Because of this, his sojourn was prolonged,''

''A spirit from none other than God,''

:''So that he might raise the dead and bring forth birds from clay.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=al-Arabi|first=Ibn|author-link=Ibn al-Arabi|date=1980|title=Ibn Al Arabi: The Bezels of Wisdom|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p4PeeQGStQkC&amp;pg=PT174|location=London|publisher=SPCK|page=174|isbn=0809123312}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Gentile da Fabriano 037.jpg|thumb|Pseudo-Arabic on the Christ child's blanket, [[Gentile da Fabriano]]]]
The narrative from the Quran continues with Mary, overcome by the pains of childbirth, being provided a stream of water under her feet from which she could drink and a palm tree which she could shake so ripe dates would fall and be enjoyed. After giving birth, Mary carries baby Jesus back to the temple and she is asked by the temple elders about the child. Having been commanded by Gabriel to a vow of silence, she points to the infant Jesus and the infant proclaims:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=IEUdCgAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA33|title=Images of Jesus Christ in Islam: 2nd Edition|first=Oddbjørn|last=Leirvik|date=25 March 2010|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Birth narratives===
[[Ibn Ishaq]] (d. 761 or 767), an [[Arab]] [[historian]] and [[hagiographer]], wrote the account entitled ''Kitab al-Mubtada'' (In the Beginning), reporting that Zechariah is Mary's guardian briefly, and after being incapable of maintaining her, he entrusts her to a carpenter named George. Secluded in a church, she is joined by a young man named Joseph, and they help one another fetching water and other tasks.  The account of the birth of Jesus follows the Quran's narrative, adding that the birth occurred in [[Bethlehem]] beside a palm tree with a manger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Watt|first=William Montgomery|author-link=W. Montgomery Watt|date=1991|title=Muslim-Christian Encounters: Perceptions and Misperceptions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_qxlAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=fnd&amp;pg=PA39|location=London and New York|publisher=Routledge|page=39|isbn=0415054109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[At-Tabari]] (d. 923), a [[Persian people|Persian]] [[scholar]] and historian, contributed to the Jesus birth narrative by mentioning envoys arriving from the king of Persia with gifts (similar to the [[Biblical Magi|Magi from the east]]) for the Messiah; the command to a man called Joseph (not specifically Mary's husband) to take her and the child to Egypt and later return to [[Nazareth]].&lt;ref name="Watt 1991, p. 46"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_qxlAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=fnd&amp;pg=PA46|title=Muslim-Christian Encounters (Routledge Revivals): Perceptions and Misperceptions|first=William Montgomery|last=Watt|date=19 December 2013|publisher=Routledge|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Al-Masudi]] (d. 956), an Arab historian and [[geographer]], reports in his work ''[[The Meadows of Gold]]'' Jesus being born at Bethlehem on Wednesday 24 December (a detail likely received from contemporary Christians) without mentioning the Quranic palm tree.&lt;ref name="Watt 1991, p. 46"/&gt;

[[Ali ibn al-Athir]] (d. 1233), an Arab or Kurdish historian and [[biographer]], reported in ''[[The Complete History|The Perfection of History (al-Kamil)]]'', a work which became a standard for later Muslims, that Joseph the carpenter had a more prominent role, but is not mentioned as a relative or husband of Mary.  Al-Athir writes about how Jesus as a young boy helped to detect a thief and bringing a boy back to life which Jesus was accused of having killed. That work mentions a version of the birth narrative having taken place in Egypt without mention of a manger under the palm tree, but adds that the first version of the birth in the land of Mary's people is more accurate. Al-Athir makes a point believing Mary's pregnancy to have lasted not nine or eight months, but only a single hour. His basis is that this understanding is closer to where the Quran says Mary 'conceived him and retired with him to a distant place' (Maryam (19) 22).&lt;ref name="Watt 1991, p. 48-49"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_qxlAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=fnd&amp;pg=PA48|title=Muslim-Christian Encounters (Routledge Revivals): Perceptions and Misperceptions|first=William Montgomery|last=Watt|date=19 December 2013|publisher=Routledge|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Childhood==
[[File:Maryam.jpg|thumb|Virgin Mary nurtured by a palm tree, as described in the Quran.]]
{{Main|Finding in the Temple}}
{{See also|Flight into Egypt|Infancy Gospel of Thomas}}
The Quran does not include the tradition of the [[Flight into Egypt]], though sūra XXIII, 50 could conceivably allude to it: “And we made the son of Maryam and his mother a sign; and we made them abide in an elevated place, full of quiet and watered with springs”.&lt;ref&gt;A.J. Wensinck and Penelope C. Johnstone, “Maryam”, in ''Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition'', ed. by P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs. Consulted online on 30 September 2018. {{DOI|10.1163/1573-3912_islam_COM_0692}}, {{ISBN|9789004161214}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, narratives similar to the narrative found in the Gospels and non-canonical sources circulated in later Islamic tradition, with some details and elaborations being added over the centuries by Islamic writers and historians. Some narratives have Jesus and family staying [[Flight into Egypt|in Egypt]] up to 12 years.&lt;ref name="Leirvik 2010, p. 59"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=IEUdCgAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA59|title=Images of Jesus Christ in Islam: 2nd Edition|first=Oddbjørn|last=Leirvik|date=25 March 2010|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many moral stories and miraculous events of Jesus' youth are mentioned in ''[[Qisas al-anbiya]]'' (Stories of the Prophets), books composed over the centuries about [[Pre-Islamic Arabia|pre-Islamic]] prophets and heroes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=IEUdCgAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA58|title=Images of Jesus Christ in Islam: 2nd Edition|first=Oddbjørn|last=Leirvik|date=25 March 2010|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Masudi wrote that Jesus as a boy studied the Jewish religion reading from the [[Zabur|Psalms]] and found ''"traced in characters of light"'':

:with Jesus then claiming:

{{quote|''"today the word of God is fulfilled in the son of man''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_qxlAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=fnd&amp;pg=PA46|title=Muslim-Christian Encounters (Routledge Revivals): Perceptions and Misperceptions|first=William Montgomery|last=Watt|date=19 December 2013|publisher=Routledge|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===In Egypt===
{{See also|Infancy Gospel of Thomas}}
Several narratives show some disparity and similarity in Islamic writings about Jesus' early childhood, specifically his time in Egypt with regard to duration and events. Most of the narratives are found in non-canonical Christian sources like, for example, the pre-Islamic Gospel of Thomas. One such disparity is from al-Athir in his ''The Perfection of History'' which contains a birth narrative stating Jesus was born in Egypt instead of Bethlehem.&lt;ref name="Watt 1991, p. 48-49"/&gt;

Some other narratives of Jesus' childhood are popular Middle Eastern lore as highlighted by professor of interfaith studies [[Mahmoud M.

===Mission===
{{See also|Ministry of Jesus|Apostle (Islam)}}
It is generally agreed that Jesus spoke [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], the [[Lingua franca|common language]] of Judea in the first century A.D. and the region at-large.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| encyclopedia=The Eerdmans Bible Dictionary|title=Aramaic|quote=It is generally agreed that Aramaic was the common language of Palestine in the first century AD. Jesus and his disciples spoke the Galilean dialect, which was distinguished from that of Jerusalem (Matt. 26:73)|page=72|isbn=0-8028-2402-1|editor=Allen C. Myers|location=Grand Rapids, MI|publisher=William B. Eerdmans|year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first and earliest view of Jesus formulated in Islamic thought is that of a prophet — a human being chosen by God to present both a judgment upon humanity for worshipping idols and a challenge to turn to the one true God. From this basis, reflected upon all previous prophets through the lens of Muslim identity, Jesus is considered no more than a messenger repeating a repetitive message of the ages. Jesus is not traditionally perceived as divine, yet Muslim ideology is careful not to view Jesus as less than this, for in doing so would be sacrilegious and similar to rejecting a recognized Islamic prophet. The miracles of Jesus and the Quranic titles attributed to Jesus demonstrate the power of God rather than the divinity of Jesus — the same power behind the message of all prophets. Some Islamic traditions believe Jesus' mission was only to the people of Israel and his status as a prophet being confirmed by numerous miracles.&lt;ref&gt;Gregg, Stephen; Barker, Gregory 2010, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gregg, Stephen 2010, p. 90"/&gt;

A second early high image of Jesus is an end-time figure. This concept arises mostly from the Hadith. Muslim tradition constructs a narrative similarly found in Christian theology, seeing Jesus arriving at the end of time and descending upon earth to fight the Antichrist. This narrative is understood to champion the cause of Islam, with some traditions narrating Jesus pointing to the primacy of Muhammad. Most traditions state Jesus will then die a natural death.&lt;ref&gt;Gregg, Stephen; Barker, Gregory 2010, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

A third and distinctive image is of Jesus representing an ascetic figure — a prophet of the heart. Although the Quran refers to the ‘gospel’ of Jesus, those specific teachings of his are not mentioned in the Quran or later religious texts. They are largely absent. The Sufi tradition is where Jesus became revered, acknowledged as a spiritual teacher with a distinctive voice from other prophets, including Muhammad. Sufism tends to explore the dimensions of union with God through many approaches, including asceticism, poetry, philosophy, speculative suggestion, and mystical methods. Although Sufism to the western mind may seem to share similar origins or elements of Neoplatonism, Gnosticism, and Buddhism, the ideology is distinctly Islamic since they adhere to the words of the Quran and pursue imitation of Muhammad as the perfect man.&lt;ref name="Gregg, Stephen 2010, p. 85"&gt;Gregg, Stephen; Barker, Gregory 2010, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preaching===
The Islamic concepts of Jesus' preaching is believed to have originated in [[Kufa]], Iraq, under the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] where the earliest writers of Muslim tradition and scholarship was formulated. The concepts of Jesus and his preaching ministry developed in Kufa was adopted from the early ascetic [[Arianism|Christians of Egypt]] who opposed official church bishopric appointments from Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Khalidi|first=Tarif|author-link=Tarif Khalidi|date=31 May 2001|title=The Muslim Jesus: Sayings and Stories in Islamic Literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pE57rmPaM58C&amp;printsec=fnd&amp;pg=PA31|location=Cambridge, MA|publisher=Harvard University Press|pages=31–36|isbn=0674004779}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest stories, numbering about 85, are found in two major collections of [[Asceticism|ascetic]] literature entitled ''Kitab al-Zuhd wa'l Raqa'iq'' (The Book of the Asceticism and Tender Mercies) by Ibn al-Mubarak (d. 797), and ''Kitab al-Zuhd'' (The Book of Asceticism) by Ibn Hanbal (d. 855). These sayings fall into four basic groups: a) eschatological sayings; b) quasi-Gospel sayings; c) ascetic sayings and stories; d) sayings echoing intra-Muslim polemics.&lt;ref&gt;Khalidi 2001, [https://books.google.com/books?id=pE57rmPaM58C&amp;printsec=fnd&amp;pg=PA31 p. 31].&lt;/ref&gt;

The first group of sayings expand Jesus' [[archetype]] as portrayed in the Quran. The second group of stories, although containing a Gospel core, are expanded with a ''"distinctly Islamic stamp"''. The third group, being the largest of the four, portrays Jesus as a patron saint of Muslim asceticism. The last group builds upon the Islamic archetype and Muslim-centric definition of Jesus and his attributes, furthering esoteric ideas regarding terms such as ''"Spirit of God"'' and ''"Word of God"''.&lt;ref&gt;Khalidi 2001, [https://books.google.com/books?id=pE57rmPaM58C&amp;printsec=fnd&amp;pg=PA32 p. 32-36].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Miracles==
{{main|Miracles of Jesus}}
{{See also|Infancy Gospel of Thomas}}
At least six miracles are attributed to Jesus in the Quran, with many more being added over the centuries by writers and historians. Miracles were attributed to Jesus as signs of his prophethood and his authority, according to educator and professor Ishaq Musa Al-Husayni (d. 1990), an author most known for ''Mudhakkirat Dajaja (Memoirs of a Hen)'' (Cairo: Dar al-Maarif, 1943; 2nd ed. 1967). In ''Christ in the Quran and in Modern Arabic Literature (1960)'', Al-Husayni said it is noteworthy Muhammad attributes no miracles to himself.&lt;ref name="Parrinder 1965, p. 83"&gt;Parrinder 1965, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

These six miracles in the Quran are without detail unlike the Gospel and their non-canonical sources, which include details and mention other attributed miracles.&lt;ref name="Parrinder 1965, p. 83"/&gt; Over the centuries, these six miracle narratives have been elaborated through Hadith and poetry, with religious writings including some of the other miracles mentioned in the Gospel, non-canonical sources, and from lore.&lt;ref name="Leirvik 2010, p. 59-60"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ayoub 1992, p. 145"/&gt;

===Speaking from the cradle===
Speaking from the cradle is mentioned in three places in the Quran: al-Imran (3) 41, 46, al-Maida (5) 109-110 and Maryam (19) 29-30. Part of the narrative has the infant Jesus defending his mother Mary from the accusation of having given birth without a known husband.&lt;ref name="Parrinder 1965, p. 78"&gt;Parrinder 1965, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; Early Islam was unclear about Joseph and his role. Jesus speaks as the angel Gabriel had mentioned at the annunciation: Jesus proclaims he is a servant of God, has been given a book, is a prophet, is blessed wherever he will go, blesses the day he was born, the day he will die, and the day he is raised alive.&lt;ref&gt;Parrinder 1965, p. 75-76.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although this particular narrative is not found in the [[Bible]], the theme of speaking from the cradle is found in the non-canonical pre-Islamic [[Syriac Infancy Gospel]]. That source has Jesus declaring himself the Son of God, the [[Logos|Word]], and affirming what the angel [[Gabriel]] had previously announced to Mary as detailed in the Gospel.&lt;ref name="Parrinder 1965, p. 78"/&gt;

===Creating birds from clay===
The miracle of creating birds from clay and breathing life into them when a child is mentioned in al-Imran (3) 43, 49 and al-Maida (5) 109-110. Although this miracle is also not mentioned the canonical Gospel, the same narrative is found in at least two pre-Islamic sources: the [[Infancy Gospel of Thomas]] and the Jewish [[Toledot Yeshu]], with few variant details between the Quran and these two sources.&lt;ref name="Leirvik 2010, p. 60"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=IEUdCgAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA60|title=Images of Jesus Christ in Islam: 2nd Edition|first=Oddbjørn|last=Leirvik|date=25 March 2010|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Parrinder 1965, p. 83-84.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Healing the blind and the leper===
{{See also|Healing the two blind men in Galilee|Cleansing ten lepers}}
Similar to the [[New Testament]], the Quran mentions Jesus healing the blind and the [[Leprosy|lepers]] in al-Imran (3) 49. Muslim scholar and judge [[al-Baydawi]] (d. 1286) wrote how it was recorded that many thousands of people came to Jesus to be healed, and that Jesus healed these diseases through prayer only.&lt;ref&gt;Parrinder 1965, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; Medieval scholar [[al-Tha`labi]] wrote about how these two particular diseases were beyond medical help, and Jesus' miracles were meant to be witnessed by others as clear signs of his message.&lt;ref name="Leirvik 2010, p. 60"/&gt;

===Power over death===
Jesus is believed to have raised people from the dead, as mentioned in  al-Imran (3) 49. Although no detail is given as to who was raised or the circumstance, at least three people are mentioned in detail in the Gospel (a [[Raising of Jairus' daughter|daughter]] of Jairus, a widow's [[Raising of the son of the widow of Nain|son]] at Nain, and [[Raising of Lazarus|Lazarus]]).&lt;ref&gt;Parrinder 1965, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prescience===
Jesus was able to [[Precognition|predict]], or had [[Prophecy|foreknowledge]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fudge|first=Bruce|date=7 April 2011|title=Qur'anic Hermeneutics: Al-Tabrisi and the Craft of Commentary (Routledge Studies in the Qur'an)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lWrLEup7pJcC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA60|location=United Kingdom|publisher=Routledge|page=60|isbn=0415782007}}&lt;/ref&gt; of what was hidden or unknown to others. One example is Jesus would answer correctly any and every question anyone asked him. Another example is Jesus knew what people had just eaten, as well as what they had stored in their homes.&lt;ref name="Leirvik 2010, p. 59-60"/&gt;

===Table of food from heaven===
{{Main|Feeding the multitude}}
{{See also|Last Supper}}
In the fifth chapter of the Quran, al-Maida (5) 112-115, a narration mentions the disciples of Jesus requesting a table laden with food, and for it to be a special day of commemoration for them in the future. This may be a possible reference to the [[Eucharist]] according to professor of Islamic and Arabic studies [[W. Montgomery Watt]] (d. 2006).&lt;ref name="Watt 1991, p. 24"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_qxlAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=fnd&amp;pg=PA24|title=Muslim-Christian Encounters (Routledge Revivals): Perceptions and Misperceptions|first=William Montgomery|last=Watt|date=19 December 2013|publisher=Routledge|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to professor of comparative religions [[Geoffrey Parrinder]] (d. 2005), it is unclear if this story parallels the Gospel's [[Last Supper]] or the [[feeding the multitude]], but may be tied to the Arabic word ''ʿīd'' (Muslim festival):&lt;ref&gt;Parrinder 1965, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote| ''"One time the disciples said, O Jesus, son of Mary, can your Lord send down for us a table from heaven? He said, Fear God, if you are believers. They said, We want to eat of it, and that our hearts may be at peace, and we may know you have spoken truthfully and be among the witnesses to it. Jesus, son of Mary, said, O God our Lord send down upon us a table from heaven, to be for us a festival, for the first of us and the last of us, and a sign from you: and give provision (of food) to us, for you are the best of providers. God said, I am sending it down for you."''&lt;ref name="Watt 1991, p. 24"/&gt;}}

In a record by the [[Sunnism|Sunni]] exegete [[Tabari]], before the last supper, the threat death of anxious him. Therefore, Jesus invited his disciples for a last supper. After the meal, he washed their hands and performed their ablutions to wipe their hands on his clothing. Afterwards Jesus replied to them: "As for that I have done to you tonight, in that I served you the meal and washed your hands in person, let it be an example for you. Since you indeed consider me to be better than you, do not be haughty in relation to each other but rather expand yourselve for each other as I have expanded myself for you." After instructing the disciples in his teachings, Jesus foretells that one of them would deny him and another betray him. However, in accordance with Islamic denial of crucifixion, just a corpse in semblance of Jesus was caught and crucified and Jesus himself was raised to God.&lt;ref&gt;Neal Robinson ''Christ in Islam and Christianity'' SUNY Press 1991 {{ISBN|978-0-791-40558-1}} p 129&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other miracles===
Many stories and narratives have been developed over the years about Jesus, containing certain inherent lessons or providing meaning due to the lack of detail in the Quran regarding Jesus. Some of these narratives are similar in nature to the [[New Testament]], while some portray Jesus in a very human manner.

Besides some detail summaries of miracles of Jesus mentioned by Muslim writers over the centuries, from adulthood (like walking on water - also found in the Gospel - and causing loaves of bread to come from the ground),&lt;ref name="Parrinder 1965, p. 78"/&gt; some other miracles from childhood include: explaining the Muslim creed fundamentals to a schoolmaster, revealing who the thieves were to a wealthy chief, filling empty jars of something to drink, providing food and wine for a tyrannical king while also proving to this king his power in raising a dead man from the dead, raising a child accidentally killed, and causing the garments from a single-colored vat to come out with various colors.&lt;ref name="Leirvik 2010, p. 59-60"/&gt;

====Healing a royal official's son====
{{Main|Healing the royal official's son}}
Al-Tabari (d. 923) reports a story of an adult Jesus' encounter with a certain king in the region and the healing of his son. The identity of the king is not mentioned while legend suggests [[Philip the Tetrarch]]. The corresponding Bible reference is "the royal official's son."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XCZaP4JLeKkC&amp;pg=PA154|title=The Qur'an and Its Interpreters, Volume II: The House of 'Imran|first=Mahmoud|last=Ayoub|date=14 May 1992|publisher=SUNY Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Greed and truth-telling====
A legendary story of a miracle by a young Jesus, used as a hard-learned lesson popularly found in Middle Eastern lore according to professor Ayoub, has to do with a Jewish man and loafs of bread. Although carrying a polemic tone, the lesson centers on greed with truth-telling weaved into the narration. It is a story found often in children's books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XCZaP4JLeKkC&amp;pg=PA158|title=The Qur'an and Its Interpreters, Volume II: The House of 'Imran|first=Mahmoud|last=Ayoub|date=14 May 1992|publisher=SUNY Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Inherent wisdom====
{{See also|Logos (Islam)|Logos (Christianity)}}
Another legendary miracle story is one regarding Jesus' childhood wisdom. This legend, reported through al-Tabari from ibn Ishaq, talks about Mary sending Jesus to a religious school and the teacher being astonished to find Jesus already knowing the information being taught / discussed.&lt;ref name="Leirvik 2010, p. 59-60"/&gt;

====Food in children's homes====
Another story from al-Tabari tells of a young Jesus playing with the youths of his village and telling them what food their parents were preparing for them at home.&lt;ref name="Leirvik 2010, p. 59-60"/&gt;

According to the details of the narrative, some parents became annoyed and forbade their children to play with Jesus, suspecting he was a magician. As a result, the parents kept their children away from Jesus and gathered their children into a single house. One day, feeling lonely, Jesus went out looking for his friends, and coming upon this house he asked the parents where their children were. The parents responded that the children were not there [lied]. After Jesus asks who, then, is in the house, the parents call Jesus a pig. Jesus then says 'let there be swine in this house' which turns all the children into swine.&lt;ref name="Ayoub 1992"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ayoub|first=Mahmoud|author-link=Mahmoud M. Ayoub|date=14 May 1992|title=The Qur'an and Its Interpreters, Volume II: The House of 'Imran|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XCZaP4JLeKkC&amp;pg=PA145|location=New York|publisher=State University of New York Press|page=145|isbn=0791409945}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scripture==
{{Main|Gospel in Islam}}
{{See also|Ministry of Jesus}}
Muslims believe that God [[Direct revelation|revealed]] to Jesus a new scripture, ''al-Injīl'' (the Gospel), while also declaring the truth of the previous revelations: ''[[Tawrat|al-Tawrat]]'' (the [[Torah]]) and ''[[Zabur|al-Zabur]]'' (the [[Psalms]]). The Quran speaks favorably of ''al-Injīl'', which it describes as a scripture that fills the hearts of its followers with meekness and piety. Traditional Islamic exegesis claiming the biblical message to have been distorted or corrupted (''[[tahrif]]''), is termed ''ta'yin al-mubham'' ("resolution of ambiguity").&lt;ref name="Reynolds 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reynolds|first1=Gabriel Said|last2=|first2=|date=2010|title=On the Qur'anic Accusation of Scriptural Falsification (tahrîf) and Christian Anti-Jewish Polemic|url=https://www3.nd.edu/~reynolds/index_files/scriptural%20falsification.pdf|journal=[[Journal of the American Oriental Society]]|volume=130|issue=2|pages=192|doi=|access-date=3 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This polemic effort has its origins in the medieval period with [[Abd al-Jabbar ibn Ahmad]]'s writings.&lt;ref name="Reynolds 2010, p. 190"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www3.nd.edu/~reynolds/index_files/scriptural%20falsification.pdf|title=Reynolds 2010, p. 190|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding the [[Law of Moses]], the Quran indicates that Jesus never abolished [[Halakha|Jewish laws]] but rather confirmed them, while making partial abrogations only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Phipps|first1=William|title= Muhammad and Jesus: A Comparison of the Prophets and Their Teachings |publisher=[[Bloomsbury Publishing]]|date=May 28, 2018|orig-year=2016|pages=101|chapter=5 Scriptures |chapterurl=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DR_mDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA101|isbn=978-1-4742-8934-4|lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Islam rejects [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]]'s theology{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} of [[Paul the Apostle and Judaism#New Perspectives on Paul|justification]] before God solely by [[Sola fide|faith]] as per [[Protestantism]] or [[Sola gratia|Grace]] as per [[Catholicism]].{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} Jesus' legal perspective did not involve a [[New Covenant Theology|New Covenant]] concerning [[Good works|works]],{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} but to simply modify those existing laws.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} [[Shabir Ally]] considers this understanding to corroborate with the [[Gospel|canonical gospels]] that include [[Matthew 5:17]].{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

According to [[Yusuf al-Qaradawi]] in his book ''[[The Lawful and the Prohibited in Islam]]'', the legal restrictions Jesus abrogated for [[Jews]] where those initially legislated by God as a punishment.&lt;ref name="HH"/&gt; Classical commentaries such as ''[[Tafsir al-Jalalayn]]'' specify they pertained to the consumption of [[List of halal and kosher fish#Kosher|fish]] and [[Kosher animals#Birds|bird]] meat without spikes, or in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=0&amp;tTafsirNo=74&amp;tSoraNo=3&amp;tAyahNo=50&amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;LanguageId=2|title=تفسير Tafsir al-Jalalayn|website=altafsir|accessdate=January 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disciples==
The Quran states that Jesus was aided by a group of [[Disciples of Jesus in Islam|disciples]] who believed in His message. While not naming the disciples, the Quran does give a few instances of Jesus preaching the message to them. According to Christianity, the names of the twelve disciples were [[Saint Peter|Peter]], [[Saint Andrew|Andrew]], [[James, son of Zebedee|James]], [[John the Apostle|John]], [[Philip the Apostle|Philip]], [[Bartholomew]], [[Thomas the Apostle|Thomas]], [[Saint Matthew|Matthew]], [[James, son of Alphaeus|James]], [[Jude the Apostle|Jude]], [[Simon the Zealot|Simon]] and [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]].

The Quran mentions in chapter 3, verses 52-53, that the disciples submitted to the faith of Islam:{{primary source inline|date=July 2017}}
{{quote|When Jesus found Unbelief on their part He said: "Who will be My helpers to (the work of) Allah?" Said the disciples: "We are Allah's helpers: We believe in Allah, and do thou bear witness that we are Muslims.&lt;br&gt;Our Lord! we believe in what Thou hast revealed, and we follow the Messenger; then write us down among those who bear witness."|''Quran Surah Al-Imran 52-53''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|3|52|e=53|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} 
The longest narrative involving Jesus' disciples is when Jesus performs the miracle of bringing a table of food from heaven at their request, for further proof that his preaching is the true message.

==Death==
{{Main|Islamic view of Jesus' death}}
Most Islamic traditions, save for a few, categorically deny that Jesus physically died, either on a cross or another manner. The contention is found within the Islamic traditions themselves, with the earliest Hadith reports quoting the companions of Muhammad stating Jesus having died, while the majority of subsequent Hadith and Tafsir argue in favor of the denial through exegesis and apologetics, becoming the popular (orthodox) view.

Professor and scholar [[Mahmoud M. Ayoub]] sums up what the Quran states despite interpretative arguments:

{{quote|''"The Quran, as we have already argued, does not deny the death of Christ. Rather, it challenges human beings who in their folly have deluded themselves into believing that they would vanquish the divine Word, Jesus Christ the Messenger of God. The death of Jesus is asserted several times and in various contexts."'' (3:55; 5:117; 19:33.)&lt;ref name="Ayoub 1980"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ayoub|first=Mahmoud M.|author-link=Mahmoud M. Ayoub|last2=|first2=|date=April 1980|title=Towards an Islamic Christology II: The Death of Jesus, Reality or Delusion (A Study of the Death of Jesus in Tafsir Literature)|url=|journal=The Muslim World|publisher=Hartford Seminary|volume=70|issue=2|pages=106|doi=10.1111/j.1478-1913.1980.tb03405.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some disagreement and discord can be seen beginning with Ibn Ishaq's (d. 761) report of a brief accounting of events leading up to the crucifixion, firstly stating that Jesus was replaced by someone named Sergius, while secondly reporting an account of Jesus' tomb being located at Medina and thirdly citing the places in the Quran (3:55; 4:158) that God took Jesus up to himself.&lt;ref name="Watt 1991, p. 39-40"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_qxlAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=fnd&amp;pg=PA39|title=Muslim-Christian Encounters (Routledge Revivals): Perceptions and Misperceptions|first=William Montgomery|last=Watt|date=19 December 2013|publisher=Routledge|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An early interpretation of verse 3:55 (specifically ''"I will cause you to die and raise you to myself"''), [[Al-Tabari]] (d. 923) records an interpretation attributed to [[Abd Allah ibn Abbas|Ibn 'Abbas]], who used the literal ''"I will cause you to die"'' (mumayyitu-ka) in place of the metaphorical mutawaffi-ka ''"Jesus died"'', while [[Wahb ibn Munabbih]], an early Jewish convert, is reported to have said "God caused Jesus, son of Mary, to die for three hours during the day, then took him up to himself." Tabari further transmits from Ibn Ishaq: "God caused Jesus to die for seven hours",&lt;ref&gt;Zahniser 2008, page 56&lt;/ref&gt; while at another place reported that a person called Sergius was crucified in place of Jesus. Ibn-al-Athir forwarded the report that it was [[Judas]], the betrayer, while also mentioning the possibility it was a man named Natlianus.&lt;ref name="Watt 1991, p. 47"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_qxlAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=fnd&amp;pg=PA47|title=Muslim-Christian Encounters (Routledge Revivals): Perceptions and Misperceptions|first=William Montgomery|last=Watt|date=19 December 2013|publisher=Routledge|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Al-Masudi]] (d. 956) reported the death of Christ under [[Tiberius]].&lt;ref name="Watt 1991, p. 47"/&gt;

[[Ibn Kathir]] (d. 1373) follows traditions which suggest that a crucifixion did occur, but not with Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;Gregg, Stephen; Barker, Gregory 2010, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; After the event, Ibn Kathir reports the people were divided into three groups following three different narratives; The [[Jacob Baradaeus|Jacobites]] believing ‘God remained with us as long as He willed and then He ascended to Heaven;’ The [[Nestorianism|Nestorians]] believing ‘The son of God was with us as long as he willed until God raised him to heaven;’ and the Muslims believing; ‘The servant and messenger of God, Jesus, remained with us as long as God willed until God raised him to Himself.’&lt;ref&gt;Gregg, Stephen; Barker, Gregory 2010, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another report from Ibn Kathir quotes Ishaq Ibn Bishr, on authority of Idris, on authority of Wahb ibn Munabbih, that ''"God caused him to die for three days, then resurrected him, then raised him."''&lt;ref&gt;Robinson 1991, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ht1hpisBQF0C&amp;printsec=fnd&amp;pg=PA122 p. 122].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ayoub 1980, p. 108.

Quranic commentators seem to have concluded the denial of the crucifixion of Jesus by following material interpreted in Tafsir that relied upon [[Apocrypha|extra-biblical Judeo-Christian sources]], venturing away from the message conveyed in the Quran,&lt;ref&gt;Lawson 2009, [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=C1cQBwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA12 page 12]&lt;/ref&gt; with the earliest textual evidence having originated from a non-Muslim source; a misreading of the Christian writings of [[John of Damascus]] regarding the literal understandings of [[Docetism]] (exegetical doctrine describing spiritual and physical realities of Jesus as understood by men in logical terms) as opposed to their figurative explanations.&lt;ref&gt;Lawson 2009, [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=C1cQBwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA7 page 7].&lt;/ref&gt; John of Damascus highlighted the Quran's assertion that the Jews did not crucify Jesus being very different from saying that Jesus was not crucified, explaining that it is the varied Quranic exegetes in Tafsir, and not the Quran itself, that denies the crucifixion, further stating that the message in the 4:157 verse simply affirms the historicity of the event.&lt;ref&gt;Lawson 2009, [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=C1cQBwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA12 page 12].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Book of the Sage and Disciple|Ja’far ibn Mansur al-Yaman]] (d. 958), [[Abu Hatim Ahmad ibn Hamdan al-Razi]] (d. 935), [[Abu Yaqub al-Sijistani]] (d. 971), [[Mu'ayyad fi'l-Din al-Shirazi]] (d. 1078) and the group [[Ikhwan al-Safa]] also affirm the historicity of the Crucifixion, reporting Jesus was crucified and not substituted by another man as maintained by many other popular Quranic commentators and Tafsir.

In reference to the Quranic quote "We have surely killed Jesus the Christ, son of Mary, the apostle of God", Muslim scholar Mahmoud Ayoub asserts this boast not as the repeating of a historical lie or the perpetuating of a false report, but an example of human arrogance and folly with an attitude of contempt towards God and His messenger(s). Ayoub furthers what modern scholars of Islam interpret regarding the historical death of Jesus, the man, as man's inability to kill off God's Word and the Spirit of God, which the Quran testifies were embodied in Jesus Christ. Ayoub continues highlighting the denial of the killing of Jesus as God denying men such power to vanquish and destroy the divine Word. The words, ''"they did not kill him, nor did they crucify him"'' speaks to the profound events of ephemeral human history, exposing mankind's heart and conscience towards God's will. The claim of humanity to have this power against God is illusory. ''"They did not slay him...but it seemed so to them"'' speaks to the imaginations of mankind, not the denial of the actual event of Jesus dying physically on the cross.&lt;ref&gt;Ayoub 1980, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;

Islamic reformer Muhammad [[Rashid Rida]] agrees with contemporary commentators interpreting the physical killing of Christ's apostleship as a metaphorical interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Ayoub 1980, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Substitution===
It is unclear exactly where the substitutionist interpretation originated, but some scholars consider the theory originating among certain [[heresy|heretical]] Gnostic groups of the second century.&lt;ref name="Leirvik 2010, p. 34"/&gt;

Leirvik finds the Quran and Hadith to have been clearly influenced by the non-canonical ('heretical') Christianity that prevailed in the Arab peninsula and further in Abyssinia.&lt;ref name="Leirvik 2010, p. 66"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=IEUdCgAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA66|title=Images of Jesus Christ in Islam: 2nd Edition|first=Oddbjørn|last=Leirvik|date=25 March 2010|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muslim commentators have been unable to convincingly disprove the crucifixion. Rather, the problem has been compounded by adding the conclusion of their substitutionist theories. The problem has been one of understanding.&lt;ref&gt;Ayoub 1980, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|''"If the substitutionist interpretation (Christ replaced on the cross) is taken as a valid reading of the Qur'anic text, the question arises of whether this idea is represented in Christian sources. According to [[Irenaeus]]' ''[[Adversus Haereses]]'', the Egyptian Gnostic Christian [[Basilides]] (2nd century) held the view that Christ (the divine ''[[nous]]'', intelligence) was not crucified, but was replaced by Simon of Cyrene. However, both [[Clement of Alexandria]] and [[Hippolytus of Rome|Hippolytus]] denied that Basilides held this view. But the substitutionist idea in general form is quite clearly expressed in the Gnostic [[Nag Hammadi]] documents ''[[Apocalypse of Peter]]'' and ''[[Second Treatise of the Great Seth|The Second Treatise of the Great Seth]]''."''&lt;ref name="Watt 1991, p. 39-40"/&gt;}}

==Ascension==
{{Main|Islamic view of Jesus' death}}

Modern Islamic scholars like Sayyid [[Muhammad Husayn Tabataba'i]] interpret the ascension of Jesus as spiritual, not physical. This interpretation is in accord with [[Muʿtazila]] and Shia metaphorical explanations regarding anthropomorphic references to God in the Quran. Although not popular with traditional Sunni interpretations of the depiction of crucifixion, there has been much speculation and discussion in the effort of logically reconciling this topic.&lt;ref&gt;Ayoub 1980, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ascetic Shia writings, Jesus is depicted having "ascended to heaven wearing a woolen shirt, spun and sewed by Mary, his mother. As he reached the heavenly regions, he was addressed, “O Jesus, cast away from you the adornment of the world."&lt;ref&gt;Ayoub 1980, p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second coming==
{{See also|Second Coming#Islam|Islamic eschatology|Hadith of Jesus Praying Behind Mahdi}}

According to Islamic tradition which describes this graphically, Jesus' descent will be in the midst of wars fought by ''[[Mahdi|al-Mahdi]]'' (''lit''. "the rightly guided one"), known in [[Islamic eschatology]] as the redeemer of Islam, against ''[[al-Masih ad-Dajjal]]'' (the Antichrist "[[false messiah]]") and his followers.&lt;ref name="S209"&gt;Sonn (2004) p. 209&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus will descend at the point of a white [[Arcade (architecture)|arcade]], east of [[Damascus]], dressed in yellow robes—his head anointed. He will say prayer behind ''al-Mahdi'' then join him in his war against the Dajjal. Jesus, considered as a Muslim, will abide by the Islamic teachings. Eventually, Jesus will slay the Antichrist, and then everyone who is one of the [[People of the Book]] (''ahl al-kitāb'', referring to Jews and Christians) will believe in him. Thus, there will be one community, that of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|muslim|41|7023|e=7027}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = [[Sahih Muslim]] |language = Arabic| page =193, part2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Ahmad Gunny|2015}}

After the death of ''al-Mahdi'', Jesus will assume leadership. This is a time associated in Islamic narrative with universal peace and justice. Islamic texts also allude to the appearance of ''[[Gog and Magog#Qur.27an|Ya'juj and Ma'juj]]'' (known also as Gog and Magog), ancient tribes which will disperse and cause disturbance on earth. God, in response to Jesus' prayers, will kill them by sending a type of worm in the napes of their necks, and send large birds to carry and clear their corpses from the land.&lt;ref name="S209"/&gt; Jesus' rule is said to be around forty years, after which he will die.

Jesus is described by various means in the Quran. The most common reference to Jesus occurs in the form of ''Ibn Maryam'' (son of Mary), sometimes preceded with another title. Jesus is also recognized as a ''nabī'' (prophet) and ''rasūl'' (messenger) of God. The terms ''`abd-Allāh'' (servant of God), ''wadjih'' ("worthy of esteem in this world and the next") and ''mubārak'' ("blessed", or "a source of benefit for others") are all used in reference to him.&lt;ref name="EoI-Isa"/&gt;

Islam sees Jesus as human, sent as the [[Prophets and messengers in Islam#Prophets and messengers|last]] prophet of Israel to [[Jews]] with the [[Gospel in Islam|Gospel]] scripture, affirming but modifying the [[Mosaic Law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sakura|first1=Muham|title=The Great Tale of Prophet Adam &amp; Prophet Jesus In Islam|publisher=[[United Submitters International]]|date=November 11, 2017|orig-year=December 2015|page=6|chapter=Preface|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UzKDCwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover|lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Akhtar 2017"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Akhtar|first1=Shabbir|title=The Quran and the Secular Mind: A Philosophy of Islam|publisher=[[Routledge]]|date=October 24, 2017|orig-year=October 2007|pages=31|chapter=PART 1 Quranic Islam and the secular mind|chapterurl=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=wa1HRjA0AgEC&amp;pg=PA31|isbn=0-203-93531-4|lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HH"&gt;{{cite book |last1=[[Yusuf al-Qaradawi|Al-Qaradawi]]|first1=Yusuf|title=[[The Lawful and the Prohibited in Islam|The Lawful and the Prohibited in Islam (Al-Halal Wal Haram Fil Islam)]]|publisher=American Trust Publications|date= January 30, 2018|orig-year=January 30, 1999|pages=5|chapter=INTRODUCTION|chapterurl=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=v21NCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA5|lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mainstream traditions have historically rejected any divine notions of Jesus being God, or begotten Son of God, or the [[Trinity]]. Popular theology teaches such beliefs constitute ''[[Shirk (Islam)|shirk]]'' (the "association" of partners with God) and thereby a rejection of his divine oneness (''[[tawhid]]'') as the sole unpardonable sin.&lt;ref name=multiple&gt;See:

*Fasching, deChant (2001) p. 241
*Markham and Ruparell (2001) p. 348&lt;/ref&gt;

A widespread polemic directed to these doctrinal origins are ascribed to [[Paul the Apostle]], regarded by some Muslims as a [[Heresy|heretic]],{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} as well as an evolution across the [[Greco-Roman world]] causing [[Greco-Roman paganism|pagan]] influences to corrupt God's revelation.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} The theological absence of [[Original Sin]] in Islam renders the Christian concepts of [[Atonement in Christianity|Atonement]] and [[Redemption (theology)#Christianity|Redemption]] as redundant.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} Jesus simply conforms to the prophetic mission of his predecessors.&lt;ref name="Gregg, Stephen 2010, p. 90"/&gt;

Jesus is understood to have preached salvation through submission to God's will and worshipping God alone. Islam teaches Jesus will ultimately deny claiming divinity.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} Thus, he is considered to have been a ''Muslim''{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} by the religious definition of the term (i.e., one who submits to God's will), as understood in Islam regarding all other prophets that preceded him.&lt;ref&gt;Khalidi 2001 [https://books.google.com/books?id=pE57rmPaM58C&amp;printsec=fnd&amp;pg=PA75 p. 75]; *Fasching, deChant (2001) p. 241&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Virgin Mary and Jesus (old Persian miniature).jpg|thumb|Jesus and Mary in old [[Persian miniature]].{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}]]

A frequent title of Jesus mentioned is ''[[Messiah|al-Masīḥ]]'', which translates to "the Messiah", as well as [[Christ (title)|Christ]]. Although the Quran is silent on its significance,&lt;ref name="Akhtar 2017, p. 32"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=wa1HRjA0AgEC&amp;pg=PA32|title=The Quran and the Secular Mind: A Philosophy of Islam|first=Shabbir|last=Akhtar|date=31 October 2007|publisher=Routledge|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; scholars{{Who|date=March 2018}} disagree with the [[Messiah#Christianity|Christian concepts]] of the term, and lean towards a [[Messiah in Judaism|Jewish]] understanding. Muslim exegetes explain the use of the word ''masīh'' in the Quran as referring to Jesus' status as the one anointed by means of blessings and honors; or as the one who helped cure the sick, by anointing the eyes of the blind, for example.&lt;ref name="EoI-Isa"/&gt;

Jesus also holds a description from God as both a word and a spirit. Quranic verses assert that he is a Word from God, which is interpreted as a reference to the creating Word uttered at the moment of his conception, identified as "[[Be, and it is|Be]]".{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} Jesus is thus God's Word in that he came into existence through it, rather than being a manifestation of the Word itself,{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} and hence differing from the Christian ''[[Logos (Christianity)|Logos]]''.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

The interpretation behind Jesus as a spirit from God, is seen as his human [[soul]].{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} Some Muslim scholars{{Who|date=March 2018}} occasionally see the spirit as the [[archangel]] [[Gabriel]], but majority consider the spirit to be Jesus himself.&lt;ref&gt;Mufti Shafi Uthmani, Maariful Quran, Q. 19:16-21, Volume 6, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Similitude with Adam===
The Quran emphasizes the creationism of Jesus,&lt;ref name="Akhtar 2017, p. 32"/&gt; through his similitude with [[Adam]] in regards to the absence of human origin.

Islamic exegesis extrapolates a logical inconsistency behind the Christian argument of divine intervention, as such implications would have ascribed divinity to Adam who is understood only as creation.&lt;ref name="Akhtar 2017, p. 32"/&gt; Adam likewise was both created through the Word of God and described as a spirit from him.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} Furthermore, their equation is also depicted numerically, as both of them are referred to by name 25 times each.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

===Precursor to Muhammad===
{{Six Islamic Prophets}}
Muslims believe that Jesus was a precursor to Muhammad, and that he prophesied the latter's coming. This perspective is based on a verse of the Quran wherein Jesus speaks of a messenger to appear after him named "Ahmad".{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Islam associates [[Ahmad]] with Muhammad, both words deriving from the ''[[Ḥ-M-D|h-m-d]]'' [[Semitic root|triconsonantal root]] which refers to praiseworthiness. Muslims assert that evidence of Jesus' pronouncement is present in the [[New Testament]], citing the mention of the [[Paraclete]] whose coming is foretold in the [[Gospel of John]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Muslim commentators claim that the original Greek word used was ''periklutos'', meaning famed, illustrious, or praiseworthy—rendered in Arabic as Ahmad; and that this was replaced by Christians with ''parakletos''.&lt;ref name="EoI-Isa"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_qxlAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=fnd&amp;pg=PA33|title=Muslim-Christian Encounters (Routledge Revivals): Perceptions and Misperceptions|first=William Montgomery|last=Watt|date=19 December 2013|publisher=Routledge|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea is debated, asking if the traditional understanding is supported by the text of the Quran.

Islamic theology claims Jesus had foretold another prophet succeeding him according to [[Sura 61]]:6, with the mention of the name ''Ahmad''. ([[Ahmad]] is an Arabic name from the same [[triconsonantal]] root [[Ḥ-M-D]] = [ح - م - د].) In responding to [[Ibn Ishaq]]'s biography of Muhammad, the [[Prophetic biography|Sirat Rasul Allah]], Islamic scholar [[Alfred Guillaume]] wrote:

{{quote |Coming back to the term "Ahmad", Muslims have suggested that Ahmad is the translation of periklutos, celebrated or the Praised One, which is a corruption of parakletos, the Paraclete of John XIV, XV and XVI.&lt;ref&gt;Liddell and Scott`s celebrated Greek-English Lexicon gives this definition for periklutos: "heard of all round, famous, renowned, Latin inclytus: of things, excellent, noble, glorious".  Rev. James M. Whiton, ed. A Lexicon abridged from Liddell and Scott`s Greek-English Lexicon. New York: American Book Company, N.D. c.1940s, p.549. Periklutos occurs in The Iliad and The Odyssey, and Hesiod`s Theogony.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Thus, while the spirit of Christ avoided crucifixion by ascending unto God, the body that was Jesus was sacrificed on the cross, thereby bringing the [[Old Testament]] to final fulfillment. Thus Quranic passages on the death of Jesus affirm that while the [[Pharisees]] intended to destroy [[the Son of God]] completely, they, in fact, succeeded only in killing [[Son of Man|the Son of Man]], being his ''nasut'' (material being). Meanwhile, [[the Son of God]], being his ''lahut'' (spiritual being) remained alive and undying — because it is [[the Holy Spirit]].&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Islam, ''Jesus'' article. cf. L. Massignon, ''Le Christ dans les Évangiles selon Ghazali'', in REI, 1932, 523-36, who cites texts of the [[Rasa'il Ikhwan al-Safa]], a passage of [[Abu Hatim Ahmad ibn Hamdan al-Razi|Abu Hatim al-Razi]] (about 934), and another of the Isma'ili ''[[da'i]]'' [[Mu'ayyad fid-din al-Shirazi]] (1077).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Quran does not convey the specific teachings of Jesus. What has developed over the years was authored by later followers of Islam. What is found in the Quran about Jesus is that his teaching conformed to the prophetic model: a human sent by God to present both a judgement upon humanity for worshipping idols and a challenge to turn to the one true God. In the case of Jesus, Muslims believe that his mission was to the people of Israel and that his status as a prophet was confirmed by numerous miracles.&lt;ref name="Gregg, Stephen 2010, p. 90"&gt;Gregg, Stephen; Barker, Gregory 2010, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; The Quran's description of specific events at the end of Jesus’ life have continued to be controversial between Christians and Muslims, while the classical commentaries have been interpreted differently to accommodate new information.&lt;ref name="Gregg, Stephen 2010, p. 90"/&gt; Jesus is written about by some Muslim scholars as the perfect man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Little|first=John T.|last2=|first2=|date=3 April 2007|title=Al-Insan Al-Kamil: The Perfect Man According to Ibn Al-Arabi|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1478-1913.1987.tb02785.x/abstract|journal=The Muslim World|publisher=Hartford Seminary|volume=77|issue=1|pages=43–54|doi=10.1111/j.1478-1913.1987.tb02785.x|access-date=30 May 2016|quote="[[Ibn Arabi|Ibn al-'Arabi]] uses no less than 22 different terms to describe the various aspects under which this single Logos may be viewed."}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=|title=Jesus the Messiah in Muslim Thought|last=Schumann|first=Olaf H.|date=2002|publisher=ISPCK/HIM|isbn=8172145225|location=Dehli|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=iJmcAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT6 Parrinder 1965, p. 6].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hadith===
{{See also|Hadith|Hadith of Jesus Praying Behind Mahdi}}
The Hadith are reported sayings of Muhammad and people around him. The Hadith containing Jesus legend have been influenced by the non-canonical ('heretical') Christianity that prevailed in the Arab peninsula and further in Abyssinia.&lt;ref name="Leirvik 2010, p. 66"/&gt; The Hadith developed a canonical status in the third Muslim century as a source of authority for the Muslim community. The Muslim perception of Jesus emerging from the Hadith is of a miraculous, sinless, and eschatological figure, pointing people, again according to the Muslim's perspective of prophethood, to the Muslim faith (Muslim; one who submits to the will of God).&lt;ref&gt;Gregg, Stephen; Barker, Gregory 2010, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hadith have played a very important part shaping Jesus' image among common Muslims, having become further developed when incorporating Hadiths and Tafsirs weaved into great amounts of [[legend]]ary writings and reports.&lt;ref name="Leirvik 2010, p. 59"/&gt; With the Muslim reshaping, the void of Jesus is surprising. What is instead written about is the [[Asceticism|ascetic]] magician, helped by the Holy Spirit. The Gospel is seen as a book to be preached and is only referred to in passing without mentioning actual teachings. Strikingly, the fictitious sayings and supposed teachings of Jesus are given preeminence in Hadith-collections, in Shia Islam, and in Sufi representations of Jesus.&lt;ref name="Leirvik 2010, p. 66"/&gt;

===Sunnism===
In ''Kitab al-Milal wa al-Nihal'', [[al-Shahrastani]] (d. 1153), an influential Persian historian, historiographer, scholar, philosopher and theologian, records a portrayal of Jesus very close to the orthodox tenets while continuing the Islamic narrative:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''The Christians. (They are) the community (''[[ummah|umma]]'') of the Christ, Jesus, son of Mary (peace upon him). He is who was truly sent (as prophet; ''mab'uth'') after Moses (peace upon him), and who was announced in the Torah. To him were (granted) manifest signs and notable evidences, such as the reviving of the dead and the curing of the blind and the leper. His very nature and innate disposition (''[[fitra]]'') are a perfect sign of his truthfulness; that is, his coming without previous seed and his speaking without prior teaching. For all the (other) prophets the arrival of their revelation was at (the age of) forty years, but revelation came to him when he was made to speak in the cradle, and revelation came to him when he conveyed (the divine message) at (the age of) thirty. The duration of his (prophetic) mission (''[[da'wa]]'') was three years and three months and three days.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_qxlAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=fnd&amp;pg=PA68|title=Muslim-Christian Encounters (Routledge Revivals): Perceptions and Misperceptions|first=William Montgomery|last=Watt|date=19 December 2013|publisher=Routledge|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Shiism===
According to Imam [[Ja'far al-Sadiq]], the great grandchild of Muhammad, between [[David]] and Jesus there were 400 years. The religion of Jesus was 'tawhid' (divine unity), 'ikhlas' (purity) and what Noah, Abraham and Moses had professed. The 'Injil' (Gospel) was sent down to him and the pledge that other prophets took was also taken from Jesus: to establish prayer with religion, enjoin the good and forbid the evil, allowing what is allowed and forbidding what has been forbidden. Admonitions and parables were sent down to him in the 'Injil', but there was no law of retribution in it nor precepts of retribution (ahkam al-hudud), and no obligations for inheritance. He was sent what was an alleviation of what was sent down to Moses in the Torah. (see al-Imran 50) Jesus commanded of his followers that they believe in the law of the Torah and the 'Injil'.&lt;ref name = Qaim2007&gt;{{cite book|last1=Qaim|first1=Mahdi Muntazir|title=Jesus Through the Qur’an and Shi’ite Narrations|date=2007|publisher=Tahrike Tarsile Qur'an|location=Queens, New York|isbn=978-1879402140|pages=36–37|edition=Bilingual}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sufism===
Early Sufis adopted the sayings of Jesus in the Sermon on the Mount and an ascetic dimension. The submission and sacrifice Jesus exemplified shows the Muslim is to be set apart from worldly compromises. In poetry and mysticism, Jesus was celebrated as a prophet close to the heart of God achieving an uncommon degree of self-denial.&lt;ref&gt;name="Gregg, Stephen 2010, p. 85"&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the writings developed over the centuries embellished Jesus’ miracles, the lessons of Jesus can be seen as metaphors of the inner life. These rich and diverse presentations of Jesus in Sufi traditions are the largest body of Jesus-texts in any non-Christian tradition.&lt;ref name="Gregg, Stephen 2010, p. 86"&gt;Gregg, Stephen; Barker, Gregory 2010, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|''"A key issue arises for Muslims with the Sufi picture of Jesus: how universally should the ascetic/esoteric approach be applied? For many Muslim poets and scholars the answer is clear: every Muslim is invited to the path of asceticism and inner realization embodied by Jesus. However, whilst all Muslims revere Jesus, most have reservations about the application of his way of life to society. For Muslims the highest pinnacle of human achievement is, after all, Muhammad. Muhammad is revered in part because he promoted the right blend of justice and mercy. In other words, Muslims need both a path that addresses individual spirituality as well as a path that will address the complex issues of community life, law, justice, etc. Jesus is viewed by many Muslims as having lived out only one side of this equation. As a figure of the heart or individual conscience, Jesus is viewed by some to be a limited figure. In more critical Muslim perspectives the Sermon on the Mount is admired but seen as impractical for human society. Perhaps the greatest division amongst Muslims has to do with the relevance of ascetic and esoteric beliefs in the context of strengthening an Islamic society."''&lt;ref name="Gregg, Stephen 2010, p. 86"/&gt;}}

The miraculous birth and life of Jesus becomes a metaphor for [[Rumi]] of the spiritual rebirth that is possible within each human soul. This rebirth is not achieved without effort; one needs to practice silence, poverty, and fasting—themes that were prominent in Jesus’ life according to Islamic traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Gregg, Stephen; Barker, Gregory 2010, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ibn Arabi]] stated Jesus was [[Al-Insān al-Kāmil]], the spirit and simultaneously a servant of God. Jesus is held to be "one with God" in whole coincidence of will, not as a being. Due to the spirit of God dwelling in Jesus, God spoke and acted through him. Yet Jesus is not considered to be God, but a person within God's word and spirit and a manifestation of God's attributes, like a mirror.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=IEUdCgAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA89|title=Images of Jesus Christ in Islam: 2nd Edition|first=Oddbjørn|last=Leirvik|date=25 March 2010|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clinton Bennett ''Understanding Christian-Muslim Relations: Past and Present'' A&amp;C Black 2008 {{ISBN|978-0-826-48782-7}} page 155&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ahmadiyya===

{{Main|Jesus in Ahmadiyya Islam}}
The Ahmadiyya Movement considers Jesus was a prophet and a mortal man, who was crucified and remained on the cross for six hours, until darkness fell. Jesus was taken down from the cross alive and unconscious. He was treated for three days and nights by saint physician Necdemus in a cave like tomb (especially built for [[Joseph of Aramathea]]). Thereafter, Jesus recuperated from his wounds, met his trusted disciples on the Mount of Olives, and left Judea towards the sea of Galilee on his way to Damascus. After his dramatic escape from crucifixion, Jesus traveled to the eastern lands in search of the ten lost tribes of Israel. Finally, he died a natural death in [[Kashmir]], [[India]], as opposed to having been raised up alive to Heaven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wikiahmadiyya.org/history/jesus/death-of-jesus|title=Death of Jesus - WikiAhmadiyya, Islam &amp; Ahmadiyya encyclopedia free online|website=www.wikiahmadiyya.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ascetic literature===
Jesus is widely venerated in Muslim [[Asceticism|ascetic]] and [[mysticism|mystic]] literature, such as in Muslim mystic [[Ghazali|Al-Ghazzali]]'s ''Ihya `ulum ad-Din'' ("The revival of the religious sciences"). These works lay stress upon Jesus' poverty, his preoccupation with worship, his detachment from worldly life and his miracles. Such depictions also include advice and sermons which are attributed to him. Later [[Sufism|Sufic]] commentaries adapted material from Christian gospels which were consistent with their ascetic portrayal. Sufi philosopher [[Ibn Arabi]] described Jesus as "the seal of universal holiness" due to the quality of his faith and "because he holds in his hands the keys of living breath and because he is at present in a state of deprivation and journeying".&lt;ref name="EoI-Isa"/&gt;{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

The [[Gospel of Barnabas]], which is generally agreed to correspond with the one found in the two known manuscripts and is reported to be contained in [[Morisco]] manuscript BNM MS 9653 in [[Madrid]], claims that Jesus predicted the advent of [[Muhammad]]. This was written about 1634 by Ibrahim al-Taybili in [[Tunisia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wiegers|first=G.A.|date=April–June 1995|title=Muhammad as the Messiah: A comparison of the polemical works of Juan Alonso with the Gospel of Barnabas|journal=Biblitheca Orientalis|volume=LII|issue=3/4|pages=274}}&lt;/ref&gt; While describing how the Bible predicts Muhammad, he speaks of the "Gospel of Saint Barnabas where one can find the light" ("y así mismo en Evangelio de San Bernabé, donde se hallará la luz"). The first published account of the Gospel was in 1717, when a brief reference to the Spanish text is found in ''De religione Mohamedica'' by [[Adriaan Reland]];&lt;ref name="Fremaux 1999 14"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Fremaux|first=Michel|author2=Cirillo, Luigi|title=Évangile de Barnabé 2nd Edn revised|year=1999|publisher=Beauchesne|pages=14|isbn=9782701013893}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then in 1718, a much more detailed description of the Italian text by the Irish [[Deism|deist]] [[John Toland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Ragg|first=L &amp; L|title=The Gospel of Barnabas|year=1907|publisher=Oxford|pages=lxv–lxxi|nopp=true|isbn=1-881316-15-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearance==
Based upon several [[Hadith]] narrations of Muhammad, Jesus can be physically described thus (with any differences in Jesus’ physical description being due to Muhammad describing him when seeing him at different occasions, such as during his ascension to Heaven, or when describing Jesus during [[Jesus in Islam#Second coming|Jesus' second coming):]]{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|bukhari|usc=yes|4|54|462}}, {{Hadith-usc|bukhari|usc=no|4|55|607|e=608|expand=no}}, {{Hadith-usc|bukhari|usc=no|4|55|647|e=650|begin=no}}, {{Hadith-usc|bukhari|usc=no|4|55|649|e=650}}, {{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|muslim|1|316|e=317}}, {{Hadith-usc|muslim|1|321|e=322|b=no}}, {{Hadith-usc|muslim|1|325|b=n}}, {{Hadith-usc|muslim|1|328|b=n}}, {{Hadith-usc|muslim|41|7023|b=n}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1430">In [[Finance]], a '''letter of transmittal''' is a type of [[cover letter]] that accompanies a document, such as a financial report or security certificate.

Within [[financial markets]] it is used by a [[Security (finance)|security holder]] to accompany certificates surrendered in an exchange or  [[corporate action]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasdaq.com/investing/glossary/l/letter-of-transmittal |title=Letter of Transmittal |publisher=Nasdaq |accessdate=May 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Transmittal Letter is a [[business letter]] and is formatted accordingly, it should include the recipient's address,  sender's address, distribution list, a salutation and closing. It typically includes why it should receive the reader's consideration, and what the reader should do with it.  The transmittal letter provides the recipient with a specific context in which to place the larger document or certificate and simultaneously gives the sender a permanent record of having sent the material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.mit.edu/course/21/21.guide/l-trans.htm |title=Transmittal Letters |publisher=The Mayfield Handbook of Technical &amp; Scientific Writing |accessdate=May 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aecgameplan.wordpress.com/2013/12/03/gameplan-construction-transmittal/ |title=Gameplan : Construction Transmittal }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Lime Green Icicle Tower''''' is a 2011 glass and steel sculpture by American artist [[Dale Chihuly]].  Housed in the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|Museum of Fine Arts]] (MFA) in Boston, Massachusetts, it has been on display in the Ruth and Carl J. Shapiro Family Courtyard since the 2011 exhibit "Chihuly: Through the Looking Glass".  The sculpture proved so popular during the exhibit that the museum launched a fundraising campaign to purchase the piece.

==Artist==
Chihuly, a [[Seattle]]-based artist, has been described as the greatest glass artist since [[Louis Comfort Tiffany]].&lt;ref name=butoday&gt;{{cite web |date=May 31, 2011 |last=O'Rourke |first=John |url=http://www.bu.edu/today/2011/mfa%E2%80%99s-chihuly-through-the-looking-glass/ |title=MFA’s Chihuly: Through the Looking Glass |work=BU Today |accessdate=October 26, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=exhibit&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mfa.org/exhibitions/chihuly |title=Chihuly: Through the Looking Glass |publisher=Museum of Fine Arts |accessdate=October 26, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to an accident that left him blind in one eye, Chihuly is unable to [[Glassblowing|blow the glass]] himself.  Instead he uses a team of glassblowers from around the world to create his artwork using traditional glassblowing methods.  After molten glass is shaped using a [[Blowpipe (tool)|blowpipe]], Chihuly adds color to the glass while it's still hot.  The glass is then reheated, reshaped, and cooled.&lt;ref name=butoday/&gt;

==Design==
Working with his team of glassblowers, Chihuly designed ''Lime Green Icicle Tower'' specifically for the Shapiro courtyard.&lt;ref name=hackett&gt;{{cite news |last=Hackett |first=Regina |date=April 3, 2011 |title=His glass menagerie |url=http://www.boston.com/ae/theater_arts/articles/2011/04/03/mfa_exhibit_finally_gives_colorful_artist_dale_chihuly_his_moment/ |newspaper=The Boston Globe |accessdate=October 26, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=exhibit/&gt;  The artwork, which measures {{convert|42.5|ft}} high and {{convert|7|ft}} wide, features 2,342 pieces of blown glass and weighs approximately 10,000 pounds.&lt;ref name=mfa&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mfa.org/collections/object/lime-green-icicle-tower-551953 |title=Lime Green Icicle Tower |publisher=Museum of Fine Arts |accessdate=October 26, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=vogel&gt;{{cite news |last=Vogel |first=Carol |date=August 5, 2011 |title=Public Appeal in Boston |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/05/arts/design/the-mets-next-blockbuster-is-expected-to-stay-for-10-years.html |newspaper=The New York Times |page=C23 |accessdate=October 26, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Andrea Shea of [[WBUR-FM]] described the color of the sculpture as [[Kermit the Frog]].&lt;ref name=wbur&gt;{{cite news |last=Shea |first=Andrea |date=July 26, 2011 |title=The MFA Will Keep Its Lime Green Icicle Tower |url=http://www.wbur.org/2011/10/12/green-tower-mfa-2 |publisher=WBUR |accessdate=October 26, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   Journalist John O'Rourke of [[Boston University]] described ''Lime Green Icicle Tower'' as an "exotic, neon-hued palm tree that has taken root in a giant greenhouse" while Judith H. Dobrzynski of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' described it as a "cross between a cactus and a poplar tree."&lt;ref name=butoday/&gt; &lt;ref name=wsj&gt;{{cite news |last=Dobrzynski |first=Judith H. |date=August 6, 2011 |title=Want to Help Purchase a Lime Green Icicle Tower? |url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424053111903341404576482630261594942 |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |accessdate=October 26, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although [[Sebastian Smee]], Pulitzer Prize-winning art critic for ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', is not a fan of Chihuly's work in general, he praised the sculpture.  Smee stated: "I defy anyone not to like it" and the sculpture is "so good it's hard to imagine that [[Malcolm Rogers (curator)|Malcolm Rogers]], the MFA's director, will not find a way to keep it there long term."&lt;ref name=edgers&gt;{{cite news |last=Edgers |first=Geoff |date=July 26, 2011 |title=MFA asks glass tower's admirers to help buy it |url=http://www.boston.com/ae/theater_arts/articles/2011/07/26/mfa_takes_up_collection_to_buy_chihuly_piece/?s_campaign=8315 |newspaper=The Boston Globe |accessdate=October 26, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=smee&gt;{{cite news |last=Smee |first=Sebastian |authorlink=Sebastian Smee |date=April 8, 2011 |title=Glass spectacular |url=http://www.boston.com/ae/theater_arts/articles/2011/04/08/dale_chihuly_exhibit_at_mfa_is_a_glass_spectacular/ |newspaper=The Boston Globe |accessdate=October 26, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibit and acquisition==
Between April and August 2011, "Chihuly: Through the Looking Glass", a collection of Chihuly's work spanning 40 years, was exhibited at the MFA.&lt;ref name=hackett/&gt;&lt;ref name=exhibit/&gt;  Approximately 350,000 people viewed the exhibit, the fifth largest attendance ever for a MFA exhibit.&lt;ref name=wsj/&gt;  ''Lime Green Icicle Tower'' was so popular during the exhibit that attendees inquired if the museum would purchase the sculpture.  Senior curator of the exhibit, Gerald Ward, said: "Pretty much from day one, people almost invariably ask, 'Does this stay, is it permanent, can we keep it here?' It's met with universal acceptance and people are anxious to have it stay."&lt;ref name=edgers/&gt; Museum officials told the public they would need to contribute funds in order for the artwork to stay.&lt;ref name=vogel/&gt;&lt;ref name=shanahan&gt;{{cite news |last1=Shanahan |first1=Mark |last2=Goldstein |first2=Meredith |date=October 13, 2011 |title=Green raised for 'Green' |url=http://www.boston.com/ae/celebrity/articles/2011/10/13/mfa_takes_in_more_than_1m_for_chihuly_icicle/ |newspaper=The Boston Globe |accessdate=October 26, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Director Malcolm Rogers said funds budgeted for museum acquisitions would not be used to purchase the sculpture, stating: "We're offering people an opportunity to play an active role in our future, sending the message that people can make a difference."&lt;ref name=wsj/&gt;  On July 18, museum staff placed a contribution box by the sculpture and contacted museum members asking for donations.  The following week, the museum set up its first mobile contribution program, allowing the public to give $10 by texting "TOWER".&lt;ref name=wsj/&gt;  The museum also set up its first website where people could contribute funds online.&lt;ref name=edgers/&gt;

The fundraising drive was only the third time the MFA had made such a public appeal to purchase artwork.&lt;ref name=vogel/&gt;  The previous times were in 1940, to purchase [[Paul Revere]]'s silver liberty bowl, and 1979-1980, to purchase [[Gilbert Stuart]]'s portraits of [[George Washington|George]] and [[Martha Washington]].  Both of those fundraising drives were successful.&lt;ref name=vogel/&gt;  In October 2011, museum officials announced they had raised the more than $1 million needed to purchase the sculpture.&lt;ref name=shanahan/&gt;  According to museum officials, "thousands of gifts, small and large, were given by first-time visitors and long-time friends, ranging from piggy-bank savings brought in by children to checks written by adults."&lt;ref name=wbur/&gt;  An estimated 1,000 people put money into the contribution box or mailed cash to the museum.  Additional funds were raised by major museum patrons and [[Foundation (United States law)|foundations]], the largest being from a foundation belonging to businessman Donald Saunders and his ex-wife, award-winning actress [[Liv Ullmann]].&lt;ref name=shanahan/&gt;

'''Marlin fishing''' (also called '''billfishing''') is considered by some game fishermen to be a pinnacle of offshore [[game fishing]], due to the size and power of the four [[marlin]] species and their relative rareness. Fishing for [[marlin]] captured the imagination of some sport fishermen in the 1930s, when well-known angler/authors [[Zane Grey]], who fished for black, striped, and blue marlin in the Pacific, and [[Ernest Hemingway]], who fished the [[Florida Keys]], [[Bahamas]] and [[Cuba]] for Atlantic blue marlin and white marlin, wrote extensively about their pursuit and enthused about the sporting qualities of their quarry.

These days a lot of resources are committed to the construction of private and charter billfishing boats to participate in the billfishing tournament circuit. These are expensive purpose-built offshore vessels with powerfully driven deep sea hulls. They are often built to luxury standards and equipped with many technologies to ease the life of the deep sea recreational fisherman, including outriggers, flying bridges and fighting chairs, and state of the art [[fishfinder]]s and navigation electronics.&lt;ref name=Janiskee&gt;Janiskee RL (2008) [https://books.google.com/books?id=ygZ0MPZFONIC&amp;pg=PA202&amp;dq=Billfish&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2DxwT9qmEqvImAWQssGpBg&amp;ved=0CNIBEOgBMB0#v=onepage&amp;q=Billfish&amp;f=false ''Tourism and recreation in the Carolinas''] In: DG Bennett and JC Patton, ''A geography of the Carolinas'', pp. 201–202, Parkway Publishers. {{ISBN|9781933251431}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marlin are part of the [[billfish]] family, of which 10 species are of the most interest to anglers: [[Atlantic blue marlin|Atlantic and Pacific blue marlin]]&lt;!-- probably the same species --&gt;, [[black marlin]], [[white marlin]], [[striped marlin]], [[Atlantic sailfish]], Pacific sailfish, [[longbill spearfish]], [[shortbill spearfish]], and [[swordfish]].

==Blue marlin==
{{see also|Atlantic blue marlin}}

The blue marlin of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans are more widely pursued by sport fishermen than any other marlin species. Their wide distribution in tropical oceanic waters and seasonally into temperate zones makes them available to many anglers, and their potential to reach great sizes and spectacular fighting ability makes them a highly desired catch to some anglers.

===Biology and life history===

Blue marlin are one of the world's largest bony fish and although adult males seldom exceed {{convert|330|lb}}, females may reach far  larger sizes well in excess of {{convert|1000|lb}}. A Pacific blue weighing {{convert|1805|lb}} caught in 1970 by a party of anglers fishing out of Oahu, Hawaii, aboard the charter boat ''Coreene C'' skippered by Capt. Cornelius Choy (this fish often referred to as 'Choy's Monster') still stands as the largest marlin caught on rod and reel. This fish was found to have a yellowfin tuna of over {{convert|155|lb}} in its belly. In the Atlantic, the heaviest sport-fishing capture is Paulo Amorim's {{convert|1402|lb|adj=on}} fish from Vitoria, Brazil.  Commercial fishermen have boated far larger specimens, with the largest blue marlin brought into Tsukiji market in Tokyo supposedly weighing a massive {{convert|2438|lb}}.

Large blue marlin have traditionally been amongst the most highly prized angling captures, and a fish weighing {{convert|1000|lb}}, a "grander", has historically been regarded by blue and black marlin anglers as the benchmark for a truly outstanding catch.  Today, much effort is still directed towards targeting big blue marlin, but smaller blues are also sought by anglers fishing lighter conventional tackle and big-game [[fly fishing]] gear.

[[File:Atlantic blue marlin.jpg|thumb|right|[[Atlantic blue marlin]]]]

Blue marlin occur widely in the tropical oceanic waters of the Atlantic and the Indo-Pacific, with many fish making seasonal migrations into the temperate waters of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres to take advantage of feeding opportunities as those waters in spring and summer.  Warm currents such as the [[Gulf Stream]] in the western Atlantic and the [[Agulhas Current]] in the western Indian Ocean serve as oceanic highways for blue marlin migration, and have a major influence on their seasonal distribution. Blue marlin have a limited ability to [[Thermoregulation|thermoregulate]], and the lower limit of their temperature tolerance is thought to be in the region of about {{convert|20|°C}} although individual fish have been caught in cooler temperatures.  Larger individuals have the greatest temperature tolerance, and blue marlin encountered at the limits of their range tend to be large fish.  This wide distribution brings blue marlin in contact with anglers in many parts of the world.

Blue marlin are eclectic feeders preying on a wide range of prey species and sizes. Scientific examination of blue marlin stomach contents has yielded organisms as small as miniature filefish. Common food items include tuna-like fishes, particularly [[skipjack tuna]] and frigate mackerel (also known as [[frigate tuna]]), [[squid]], [[mackerel]], and scad.  Of more interest to sport fishermen is the upper range of blue marlin prey size. A {{convert|72|in|adj=on}} white marlin has been recorded as being found in the stomach of a {{convert|448|lb}} blue marlin caught at Walker's Cay in the Bahamas, and more recently, during the 2005 White Marlin Open, a white marlin in the {{convert|70|lb|adj=on}} class was found in the stomach of one of the money-winning blues. Shortbill spearfish of {{convert|30|to|40|lb}} have been recorded as feed items by Kona blue marlin fishermen. Yellowfin and bigeye tuna of {{convert|100|lb}} or more have also been found in the stomachs of large blue marlin.

===Fishing techniques===
Fishing styles and gear used in the pursuit of blue marlin vary, depending on the size of blue marlin common to the area, the size of fish being targeted, local sea conditions, and often local tradition. The main methods used by sport fishermen are fishing with [[Fishing lures|artificial lures]], rigged natural [[Fishing bait|baits]], or [[Bait fish|live bait]].

====Natural bait fishing====
The pioneers of blue marlin angling employed natural baits rigged to skip and swim.  Today, rigged baits, particularly [[Spanish mackerel]] and horse [[ballyhoo]] continue to be widely used for blue marlin.  Trolling for blue marlin with rigged baits, sometimes combined with an artificial lure or skirt to make "skirted baits" or "bait/lure combinations", is still widely practiced, especially along the eastern seaboard of the United States and in the [[Bahamas]], the [[Caribbean]], and [[Venezuela]].  Rigged natural baits are also used as "pitch baits" that are deployed after fish are raised to hookless lures or "teasers".

====Artificial lure fishing====
Blue marlin are aggressive fish that respond well to the splash, bubble trail, and action of a well-presented artificial lure.  Trolling with lures is probably the most popular technique used by blue marlin crews today.  [[Hawaii]] is recognized as the birthplace of lure trolling for marlin, with skippers operating from the Kona Coast of the Big Island of Hawaii developing many designs still used today.  The earliest marlin lures were carved from wood, cast in drink glasses, or made from chrome bath towel pipes and skirted with rubber inner tubes or vinyl upholstery material cut into strips. Today, marlin lures are produced in a huge variety of shapes, sizes, and colours, mass-produced by large manufacturers and individually crafted by small-scale, custom makers.

A typical marlin lure is a small ({{convert|7|-|8|in|abbr=on|disp=or}}), medium ({{convert|10|-|12|in|abbr=on|disp=or}}) to large ({{convert|14|in|abbr=on|disp=or}} or more) artificial with a shaped plastic or metal head to which a plastic skirt is attached. The design of the lure head, particularly its face, gives the lure its individual action when trolled through the water. Lure actions range from an active side-to-side swimming pattern to pushing water aggressively on the surface to, most commonly, tracking along in a straight line with a regular surface pop and bubble trail. Besides the shape, weight, and size of the lure head, the length and thickness of skirting, the number and size of hooks, and the length and size of the leader used in lure rigging all influence the action of the lure: how actively it will run and how it will respond to different sea conditions. Experienced anglers often fine-tune their lures to get the action they want.

Lures are normally fished at speeds of {{convert|7.5|to|9.0|kn}}; faster speeds in the {{convert|10|to|15|kn|adj=on}} range are also employed, primarily by boats with slower cruising speeds traveling from spot to spot. These speeds allow quite substantial areas to be effectively worked in a day's fishing. A pattern of four or more lures is trolled at varying distances behind the boat. Lures may be fished either straight from the rod tip ("flat lines"), or from outriggers.

====Live-bait fishing====
Live-bait fishing for blue marlin normally uses small tuna species, with [[skipjack tuna|skipjack]] generally considered the best choice. As trolling speed is limited because baits must be trolled slowly to remain alive, live-baiting is normally chosen where fishing areas are relatively small and easily covered, such as near[[fish aggregating device]] buoys and in the vicinity of steep underwater ledges.

Areas where bottom structure (islands, seamounts, banks, and the edge of the [[continental shelf]]) creates [[upwelling]], which brings deep nutrient-rich water close to the surface, are particularly favoured by blue marlin.

====Atlantic====

In the western Atlantic, blue marlin may be found as far north as George's Bank and the continental shelf canyons off Cape Cod, influenced by the warm current of the Gulf Stream, and as far south as southern Brazil. In the eastern Atlantic, their seasonal range extends northward to the Algarve coast of Portugal and southward to the southern coast of Angola.

Atlantic blue marlin were first consistently caught by sport fishermen in the early 1930s, when anglers from Florida began to explore the Bahamas. Authors such as [[Ernest Hemingway]] and [[S. Kip Farrington]] did much to attract the attention of big-game anglers to the Bahamian islands of [[Bimini]] and Cat Cay. After the Second World War, and especially from the 1960s onwards, anglers began pursuing and finding blue marlin in destinations all over the tropical and subtropical Atlantic.

;Bahamas

[[File:Crest of Bimini.png|thumb|left|The crest of [[Bimini]] in the [[Bahamas]] showing a blue marlin]]

The Bahama Islands have long been popular destinations for fishermen seeking blue marlin.  [[Bimini]], located at the eastern edge of the Gulf Stream, has the longest history of blue marlin fishing in the islands, dating back to the 1930s and 1940s when anglers such as Michael Lerner, Ernest Hemingway, and S. Kip Farrington fished there . From the 1960s, more outlying areas such as [[Walker's Cay]] and the Abaco islands have developed as blue marlin grounds.  The Bahamas is home to one of the most intensely competitive tournament series in marlin fishing, the Bahamas Billfish Championship.

;Bermuda

The banks lying off the hook-shaped island of [[Bermuda]] consistently produce blue marlin. Many Bermudian fish are small specimens in the {{convert|150|to|250|lb|adj=on}} class, but every year much bigger fish in the {{convert|600|lb|adj=on}} and larger class are caught. A {{convert|1352|lb}} giant boated aboard the ''Mako IV'', skippered by Captain Allen DeSilva, in 1995, stands as the largest blue marlin caught in Bermudian waters. This fish is also one of the largest blue marlin ever boated in the Atlantic.

A series of tournaments attracts many top-notch boats and crews from the United States every summer. Visiting boats and crews join a small but well-equipped and experienced fleet of charter vessels.

;Brazil

Blue marlin are fished by sport fishermen operating from several locations along the Atlantic coast of Brazil. Blue marlin have been encountered as far south as [[São Paulo]], and are regularly hooked and caught in annual tournaments held offshore of [[Rio de Janeiro]]. However, the majority of international attention has thus far focused on Canavieiras, the gateway to the Royal Charlotte Bank, an extensive area of bottom structure that holds billfish, tuna, and other pelagics in great numbers; and on Cabo Frio, where an annual tournament has produced several fish weighing in excess of {{convert|1000|lb}}.

The city of [[Vitória, Brazil|Vitória]] is considered one of the finest locations for blue marlin fishing by many anglers. Fishing is a popular activity in Vitória, attracting fishermen from other states and countries due to the large population of [[marlin]] and [[sailfish]] off the coast of [[Espirito Santo]]. Largest of the many big blue marlin caught at Vitória is the [[International Game Fish Association]] all-tackle record, held by Paulo Amorim, who caught a blue marlin that weighed {{convert|636|kg}}.

;Cape Verde Islands
This cluster of islands in the eastern tropical Atlantic has proved to be an outstanding blue marlin fishery since it was first seriously fished in the 1980s. Blue marlin may be caught year-round in [[Cape Verde Islands|Cape Verde]], but the best fishing seems to take place between March and May when large numbers of blue marlin concentrate in island waters. Blues encountered off Cape Verde range widely in size, with many fish of {{convert|100|to|350|lb}} and good numbers of larger fish in the {{convert|400|to|600|lb|adj=on}} class. The biggest catch from Cape Verde waters is a {{convert|1241|lb|adj=on}} fish caught in September 2006 near the island of [[São Vicente, Cape Verde|Saint Vincent]] by angler Barry Silleman fishing with skipper Berno Niebuhr. Incidental catches include [[wahoo]] and large [[yellowfin tuna]].

;Mexico (Atlantic coast)

In the eastern Yucatán, charter boats operating from Cozumel, Isla Mujeres and Playa del Carmen encounter blue marlin in addition to numerous white marlin and sailfish from late March through July, when the waters of the Gulf Stream bring billfish through the area. These blue marlin of the western Caribbean tend to be smaller. While large specimens can top {{convert|500|lb}}, {{convert|250|to|350|lb|adj=on}} fish are far more common.

;Portugal
Although blue marlin are being caught in increasing numbers on the Algarve coast of Portugal, the main centres of blue marlin fishing in Portugal are the oceanic islands of the [[Azores]] and [[Madeira]].

The small port of Horta on [[Faial Island]] is synonymous with blue marlin fishing in the nine-island chain of the [[Azores]]. The season normally begins in late June or early July and continues until weather conditions put an end to the fishery in mid- to late October. Weather conditions can be unpredictable at the end of the season, but in midsummer when the area is dominated by the Azores high, the seas can be very flat.

Although blue marlin can be found close to Faial, boats seeking them often select three banks that serve as productive feeding locations for these fish. The Azores sits in the northern extreme of blue marlin distribution and the fishery is dominated by large fish. Large {{convert|400|to|600|lb|adj=on}} fish are average here and every year fish of {{convert|1000|lb}} and above are encountered. The Azores is home to Atlantic blue marlin records for, amongst others, IGFA {{convert|50|and|80|lb|adj=on}}-line classes.

Blue marlin fishing in [[Madeira]] was pioneered by local anglers in the 1960s and 1970s, and a number of large blue marlin were caught during the 1980s, but the focus for most visiting anglers tended to be sharks and the prolific schools of bigeye tuna.  After the mid-1990s, however, the attention of blue marlin fishermen was drawn to the island after several exceptional captures, including eight fish weighing over {{convert|1000|lb}} in 1994 alone.

Between 1997 and 2000, blue marlin fishing in Madeira, along with the other Atlantic islands, underwent a severe downturn, blamed by many on the strong [[El Niño]] event of 1996–1997.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marlinuniversity.com/madeira_fishing.php&lt;/ref&gt;  From 2001 onwards, conditions began to improve, and the seasons of 2005 and 2006 have seen Madeira return to some of its former glory. June and July appear to be the premier months for blue marlin fishing. A small fleet of charter boats operate out of the small marina in the island's largest town, [[Funchal]].  The most popular fishing grounds are situated on the south coast of the island, sheltered by the high cliffs from the prevailing northeast trade winds. Fishing generally takes place within a few miles of the island and many great fish are caught well within {{convert|2|mi}} of the shoreline. Lure fishing is the most successful method with a wide variety of medium to large artificials from various sources being successful.

;Spain

Although a number of blue marlin have been brought into ports along the Atlantic coast of mainland [[Spain]], the subtropical archipelago of the [[Canary Islands]] is by far the most prolific blue marlin grounds in Spain.  Blue marlin appear seasonally in the Canary Islands between May and October, with some individuals having been caught earlier and later in the year. The average size of blue marlin encountered in the Canary Islands tends to be large, in the {{convert|400|to|600|lb|adj=on}} class, including some very large fish upwards of {{convert|800|lb}}. Smaller fish in the {{convert|200|to|350|lb|adj=on}} class also make an appearance at times.

Sport fishing boats may be chartered from the main islands of [[Lanzarote]], [[Fuerteventura]], and [[Tenerife]]; from the smaller islands of Graciosa and La Gomera; and from [[Puerto Rico de Gran Canaria]] on the island of [[Gran Canaria]], which has historically been the main destination for marlin fishing there and still boasts the largest fleet of charter boats in the islands.  In recent years, [[La Gomera]] has steadily gained attention amongst European and international marlin fishermen with numerous blue marlin catches, including fish over {{convert|1100|lb}}.  Blue marlin are caught both offshore and inside the island's shelf, which often holds abundant schools of [[bait fish]], mainly mackerel and scad.

;United States

The [[Outer Banks]] of [[North Carolina]] have long been known for their blue marlin fishing. Since the early 1950s when Ernal Foster on the ''Albatross I'' made the first charter fishing trips for blue marlin, [[Cape Hatteras]] has been known as an important destination for the sport fisherman. Other important fishing centers include [[Morehead City]], home to the famous Big Rock Blue Marlin Tournament, and [[Oregon Inlet]]. The proximity of the Gulf Stream and of the continental shelf edge in the Cape Hatteras area create a productive combination of current, blue water, and ocean temperature that attracts a wide variety of gamefish including blue marlin.

While the average size of a blue marlin is typically {{convert|250|to|400|lb}}, big fish inhabit these waters. North Carolina was home to the former all-tackle world record Atlantic blue marlin, a {{convert|1128|lb|adj=on}} fish that also stood as the world record for {{convert|80|lb|adj=on}} class tackle for over 17 years. The state record, which stood for many years at {{convert|1142|lb}}, was finally exceeded by a {{convert|1228|lb|adj=on}} blue taken off [[Nags Head, North Carolina|Nags Head]] on August 15, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wral.com/sports/story/3388188/ Angler snares 1,200-pound blue marlin.]&lt;/ref&gt;

;Venezuela

[[Venezuela]]'s [[La Guaira Bank]] has&lt;!-- doesn't "see" anything --&gt; some of the most prolific blue marlin fishing in the Atlantic.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} Blue marlin are present year round with particularly good numbers in spring. Trolling with ballyhoo baits using relatively light tackle, often in the {{convert|30|lb|adj=on}} class, is popular for the variety of billfish species that can make an appearance in these waters.

;Virgin Islands

The island of [[Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands|St Thomas]] in the US Virgin Islands is one of the most renowned blue marlin destinations.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} Full moons from June to October can accompany some intense blue marlin fishing in the area known as the 'North Drop'. Lure fishing, trolling natural baits, and bait and switch are all popular. The former all-tackle world-record Atlantic blue of {{convert|1282|lb}} was boated there.

====Indo-Pacific====

In the Pacific, blue marlin are seasonally found as far north as southern [[Japan]] and as far south as the [[Bay of Plenty]] in the North Island of New Zealand. Blue marlin in the eastern Pacific migrate as far north as Southern California and as far south as northern Peru. The southern limit of their distribution in the eastern Indian Ocean appears to be the waters of Albany and Perth in Western Australia, and in the western Indian Ocean blue marlin have been taken as far south as Cape Town.

Blue marlin have probably been known to Japanese high-seas fishermen for centuries. However, the Pacific blue marlin was not officially considered to be a separate species (though still debated) until 1954; prior to then, Pacific blues were known as "silver marlin" or often confused with black marlin. The capture of a {{convert|1002|lb|adj=on}} Pacific blue marlin by skipper George Parker of Kona, Hawaii, was instrumental in clearing up the identification of Pacific marlin species. Hawaii has continued to be the major center of blue marlin fishing in the Pacific, and Hawaiian blue marlin techniques have been disseminated throughout the Pacific Basin by travelling anglers and crews, influencing blue marlin fisheries as distant as Japan and Australia.

;Australia
Blue marlin range on both the east and west coasts of Australia, with fish being recorded as far south as the Tasmanian east coast and Albany on the west coast.

Notable regions to fish for blue marlin in Australia are off [[Cairns]], southern Queensland from Fraser Island to the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]], [[Port Stephens (New South Wales)|Port Stephens]] and [[Sydney]], the [[New South Wales]] south coast region, Rottnest Island off Perth, and Exmouth and Broome in Western Australia. On the east Australian coast, blue marlin are a popular target for anglers fishing from such ports as Port Stephens, Sydney, and the southern ports of [[Ulladulla]], [[Batemans Bay]], and Bermagui. However, the best scores in terms of numbers of fish have come from boats fishing the Gold Coast.

A blue marlin over {{convert|1000|lb}} has been officially recorded in Australian waters, several blue marlin over {{convert|400|kg}} have been boated or released by Australian anglers; fish larger than a thousand pounds have been hooked, but none so far landed.  The Australian record capture (which is also the ladies' all-tackle world record) weighed just under {{convert|1000|lb}}. Its weight, {{convert|997|lb}}, was caught on {{convert|37|kg|adj=on}} tackle whilst fishing from [[Batemans Bay]] on the Australian New South Wales south coast. Apparently, it took some time for the fish to be weighed, which almost certainly robbed the angler of a fish reaching {{convert|1000|lb}}. This fish was caught in March 1999 by the then 27-year-old female angler Melanie Kisbee fishing from a boat named ''Radiant'', a {{convert|28|ft|adj=on}} Bertram, which was captained by the late Paul Gibson. The fish was caught on a Topgun lure called "Awesome" in blue and pink.

Previous Australian records have been held by a {{convert|417|kg|adj=on}} fish also captured from the port of Batemans Bay during the Tollgate Island Classic, a capture which helped to put Batemans Bay on the map for big blue marlin, and a fish of around {{convert|370|kg}} captured in [[Bermagui, New South Wales|Bermagui]] by angler Wayne Cummings.  A large marlin washed up on a beach in Western Australia weighing {{convert|540|kg}} in June 2013.

Larger blue marlin appear to be captured in years when the water temperate is warmer than usual. On the New South Wales coast, water temperatures of {{convert|24|°C}} brought down the coast by the warmer south east current appear to produce the best blue marlin fishing and the largest blue marlin.  The fishing season in Australia for blue marlin is January to May–June.

Lure fishing, live bait and switch-baiting are all used successfully for blue marlin in Australia.  Blue marlin are targeted by some anglers and are also encountered whilst fishing for the more abundant striped marlin.

;Ecuador
For more than 60 years, the waters of the Humboldt Current which sweep past [[Peru]] and [[Ecuador]] have been fished by sports fishermen. Renowned American anglers Michael Lerner and Kip Farrington visited Chile and Peru in the 1940s, and their encounters with record-breaking broadbill swordfish, striped marlin, and black marlin helped to bring the billfish fisheries of these subtropical Pacific waters to the attention of the international game-fishing elite.

In 1951, a group of mainly American sports fishermen set up the Cabo Blanco Fishing Club at [[Cabo Blanco, Peru|Cabo Blanco]] in the far north of [[Peru]], close to the border with Ecuador. Some of the greatest marlin fishing in the world took place here until the club closed in the 1960s.

Today, the main centres for fishing this area of the Pacific coast are further north, in Ecuador, and the fishery has shifted from the pioneer fishing locations inshore, where black marlin and swordfish were fished by presenting baits to sighted fish, to further offshore for blue marlin, striped marlin, and tuna. Salinas is the most well-known billfishing location, and seasonally offers good fishing for large striped marlin, as well as blue marlin and other gamefish, such as bigeye tuna. The other popular blue marlin destination in the country is Manta, which is usually in season when Salinas is not. A large fleet of sport-fishing vessels operates from both towns. Blues in this area are known to reach large sizes, with the most notable capture being a {{convert|1014|lb|adj=on}} fish boated by local angler Jorge Jurado which formerly held the IGFA {{convert|80|lb|adj=on}}-class record.

;Hawaii
More blue marlin are probably caught by rod and reel in the Hawaiian Islands than anywhere in the world.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} Over 60 fish over {{convert|1000|lb}} have been weighed in Hawaiian waters, including the two largest marlin caught on rod and reel: a {{convert|1805|lb|adj=on}} fish caught from [[Oahu]] by Capt. Cornelius Choy and a {{convert|1656|lb|adj=on}} fish caught off [[Kona District, Hawaii|Kona]] by angler Gary Merriman aboard the ''Black Bart'', skippered by Capt. Bart Miller, in March 1984.

The town of Kona on the lee coast of the island of [[Hawaii]] is internationally known for its blue marlin fishing, the skill and experience of its top skippers (many of whom are also skilled lure makers), and its long-standing Hawaiian International Billfish Tournament. A large fleet of sport-fishing vessels operates from Honokohau Harbor. Blue marlin skippers in the Hawaiian Islands employ both lure-fishing and live-baiting techniques.

;New Zealand
Although a blue marlin weighing over {{convert|1000|lb}} was caught in the Bay of Islands as early as 1968, striped marlin have traditionally been the main billfish species in the New Zealand fishery. However, Pacific blue marlin captures have increased in New Zealand over the last 10 years, and blue marlin are now consistently caught from along the eastern coast of the North Island. The Waihau Bay and Cape Runaway area is particularly well known for blue marlin. Blue marlin encountered in New Zealand tend to be of large average size with most averaging {{convert|300|to|500|lb}}. Larger specimens in the {{convert|600|lb|adj=on}}-plus class are hooked and landed every year.  Most New Zealand blue marlin are taken by lure fishing, with a wide variety of locally made and imported lures being popular.

;Tahiti

In 1930, the American angler Zane Grey boated the first blue marlin weighing over {{convert|1000|lb}}, fishing a few miles south of Mataiea, [[Tahiti]]. Although damaged by a shark bite, this fish weighed in at {{convert|1040|lb}}, a remarkable capture on the primitive fishing tackle of that era.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

Offshore fishing in Tahiti began to develop in earnest in the 1960s, following the establishment of the Haura (marlin) Club of Tahiti in 1962. Today, seven gamefishing clubs exist in the Society Islands. As in Hawaii, the average size of blue marlin in Tahitian waters is in the {{convert|90|to|130|kg|adj=on}} range, but many larger individuals in the {{convert|400|lb|adj=on}} and larger class are boated each year.

;Vanuatu

The island nation of [[Vanuatu]] appears to be the premier destination for blue marlin in the South Pacific and one of the best fisheries for Pacific blues in the world.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} A ratified {{convert|1142|lb|adj=on}} fish was landed in August 2007.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

==Black marlin==
{{main|Black marlin}}
Black marlin (''Makaira indica'') are found in the Indian and Pacific Oceans with some vagrant individuals having been reported from the south Atlantic.

===Fishing techniques===

Black marlin fishing has traditionally conducted with rigged dead baits, both skipping and swimming. In the historic Cabo Blanco fishery, little blind trolling was done; instead, the billfish (striped marlin, black marlin, and swordfish) were sighted cruising or finning on the surface and baited. In the Cairns fishery, a wide variety of baitfish species are used successfully, including kawa kawa and other small tunas, [[queenfish]], and scad. Baits range from {{convert|2|lb|adj=on}} scad to [[dogtooth tuna]] and narrowbarred mackerel of {{convert|20|lb}} and more.

The use of live bait is also popular for targeting both large and small black marlin, and under the right circumstances, is extremely effective, although sharks and other nontargeted gamefish can often be a problem with this method. Small live baits such as slimy mackerel and yellowtail scad are highly effective for juvenile black marlin, and are fished both by slow trolling and drifting. Live-bait techniques for larger black marlin are similar to those used for blue marlin, normally employing bridle-rigged live tunas of {{convert|3|to|25|lb}}. The use of a downrigger has proven to be helpful in positioning baits deeper in the water column.

Artificial lures will catch black marlin of all sizes from {{convert|30|to|40|lb|adj=on}} juveniles to the giant females of {{convert|1200|lb}} and more. The prevalence of lure-damaging bycatch such as wahoo, barracuda, and Spanish (narrowbarred) mackerel in some areas can make lure fishing an expensive proposition. However, the faster pace of lure fishing allows larger areas to be searched effectively, which can be an advantage if the fish seem more dispersed.

===Angling destinations===

;Africa
Bazaruto Archipelago in Mozambique is a premier destination for giant [[black marlin]]. This fishery was discovered in the mid-1950s from the very basic fleet operating from Santa Carolina Island. Until the mid-1970s when the country erupted in a 20-year civil war, many fish over the magical {{convert|1000|lb|adj=on}} barrier were caught. Marlin fishing in the archipelago is making a big comeback, and is probably one of the world's best-kept secrets. Few but good professional operations (mainly from Indigo Bay Island Resort) fish the area for black marlin from September to January, and international anglers are finding the war years left the resource virtually untouched. The all-African record was caught on the north point of Bazaruto in November 1998, a monster fish of {{convert|1298|lb}}. Skip, swim, and live baits are the most traditional methods, but crews have experimented with lures over the past few seasons with great success.
;Australia

In February 1913, Sydney doctor [[Mark Lidwill]], fishing off Port Stephens, brought in the first black marlin ever caught on rod and reel. This fish, which weighed around {{convert|70|lb}}, was the first marlin caught by a sport fisherman in Australia, and is also thought to be the first marlin of any species caught on rod and reel.&lt;ref&gt;http://australianmuseum.net.au/Worlds-first-Black-Marlin-caught-on-Rod-and-Reel/&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the Australian town of [[Cairns]] is considered the world capital of black marlin fishing. The Great Barrier Reef is the only confirmed breeding ground for black marlin, as they synchronize their breeding with the [[myctophid]] breeding aggregations and coral spawns of September, October, and November.  The majority of sport-fishing effort for black marlin off the [[Great Barrier Reef]] takes place from [[Lizard Island]] to Cairns.

The region is unquestionably the best place in the world to catch a black marlin over {{convert|1000|lb}}. Many domestic and international anglers visit the region during the September to November period in the hope of catching the "fish of a lifetime". Black marlin can be caught to a size of {{convert|1200|to|1300|lb}} in this area.

Black marlin travel south along the east Australian coast during the Southern Hemisphere summer, and are fished for by many anglers along the Queensland and New South Wales coasts.  Juvenile black marlin are often found in as shallow as {{convert|20|fathom|m}} or even less, and are available to anglers fishing from small outboard-powered boats.  Port Stephens, the site of the first black marlin capture on rod and reel, is one of the most popular fishing areas for black marlin today, and is the site of the Southern Hemisphere's largest billfish tournament, the Port Stephens Interclub.

;Ecuador
Although most of the marlin captures in Ecuadorian waters today are blue and striped marlin, the black marlin brought this area of the southeast Pacific to fame in the 1950s, when many fish of over {{convert|1000|lb}} were boated by anglers fishing from [[Cabo Blanco, Peru|Cabo Blanco]], a small town in northern Peru, close to the border with Ecuador. The inshore grounds off the high white cliffs became known as 'Marlin Boulevard' for the numbers and size of the black marlin taken there. Greatest of the many granders captured here was the {{convert|1560|lb|adj=on}} black marlin boated by Texas oilman Alfred C. Glassell, Jr., in August 1953.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kleph.com/blog.php?v_blog_id=1&amp;v_blog_entry_id=1199 Interview with Alfred C. Glassell, Jr.] from kleph.com (the blog of freelance journalist C.J. Schexnayder)&lt;/ref&gt;  The Cabo Blanco Fishing Club, where most fishing operations were based, closed down in the late 1960s following a period of political upheaval in Peru. Around the same time, the Peruvian sport fishery also crashed{{tone inline|date=November 2014}} following the overfishing of the primary baitfish, anchoveta.

Black marlin are still found in Peruvian waters, but the main sport-fishing destination in the region nowadays is further north in Salinas, Ecuador. Black marlin are normally outnumbered in catch reports by the more prolific striped and blue marlin, but some big fish continue to be caught. The traditional method of sport fishing is trolling with natural baits, large ballyhoo being commonly used, while searching for finning fish.

;Mexico
Black marlin are consistently, although seldom frequently, caught in [[Cabo San Lucas]] and other Mexican fishing centres. Black marlin, along with blue marlin, are the targets of the biggest-paying marlin tournament in the world, the Bisbee's Black &amp; Blue, which is fished in the waters off Cabo San Lucas in October.&lt;ref&gt;[https://bisbees.com/Tournament/BisbeesBlackAndBlue] The Bisbee's Black &amp; Blue Marlin Jackpot Tournament from bisbees.com&lt;/ref&gt; At present, the offshore structures such as Corbetana Rock and "El Banco" off [[Puerto Vallarta]] appear to offer the best fishing for black marlin in Mexican waters.

The large vessels of the San Diego Long Range fleet have also caught some hefty blacks in the {{convert|600|lb|adj=on}}-plus range while fishing for yellowfin tuna at the Revillagigedos Islands. Black marlin in Mexican waters, as in most other parts of their range, tend to associate with reefs, banks, and similar offshore structures. Slow-trolling live baits such as skipjack tuna over these structures tends to be the most effective way to target black marlin. Downriggers are sometimes used to fish baits deeper.

;Panama
On June 11, 1949, pioneering Panamanian angler Louis Schmidt boated a black marlin that after being cut in half and weighed, tipped the scales at {{convert|1006|lb}}. This fish is believed to be the first black marlin of over {{convert|1000|lb}} caught on rod and reel.

Today, the productive reef areas in Piñas Bay, fished by boats from the famous Tropic Star Lodge, and the many other reefs and islands along the Pacific coast of Panama, particularly Coiba Island in the Gulf of Chiriqui, still have probably the best fishing for black marlin in the Western Hemisphere. Black marlin averaging {{convert|200|to|500|lb}} hunt schools of rainbow runners, black skipjack, and other prey over these structures along with large Pacific sailfish and dorado. Occasional specimens will reach well over {{convert|600|lb}}. Slow trolling with bridle-rigged live skipjack is the predominant technique used to target black marlin by the Tropic Star fleet. At [[Coiba]] Island, the Hannibal Banks is among most productive areas where trolling lures is employed successfully.

==Striped marlin==
{{main|Striped marlin}}
Striped marlin (''Tetrapturus audax'') occur in the Indian and Pacific Oceans.

===Fishing techniques===

====Live bait fishing====

In Mexican hot spots such as Cabo San Lucas and in Southern California, anglers cast live baits such as [[mackerel]] and caballito (scad) to striped marlin that may be sighted feeding or finning on the surface.

Conventional live-bait trolling at slow speeds is also highly effective when concentrations of marlin can be located. Experienced skippers fishing from ports such as [[Bermagui, New South Wales|Bermagui]] on the south coast of New South Wales have in the recent past racked up scores of over 100 striped marlin per season fishing this relatively simple technique at the right time at the right place. Larger baits such as [[kahawai]] and skipjack tuna are often used for the large striped marlin of New Zealand.

Deep-dropping live baits with the aid of sinkers can bring live baits deeper to feeding fish. This tactic is frequently used in Mexico and Australia. It is considered somewhat lowbrow (it has been described as "snapper fishing for marlin"), but is nonetheless highly effective when deep-feeding activity occurs.

===Angling destinations===

;Mexico
More striped marlin are caught recreationally at the Mexican tourist mecca of Cabo San Lucas than anywhere else in the world.  The local fishing banks and offshore grounds are fished by large fleets of local and American sport fishing boats. Striped marlin may be caught year-round in Cabo waters, but the heaviest concentrations seem to show up in late autumn, and good numbers stay around into the spring. On 9 Dec 2007 during the Mini, WCBRT team Reelaxe released a total of 330 striped marlin in the two-day tournament, setting another tournament record for a single team in two days, with a new record of 190 striped marlin in one day. The team consisted of Chris Badsey, Dave Brackmann, Steve Brackmann, Alex Rogers, Jose Espanoza, Mark Clayton, Saul Contrearus, and Dennis Poulton. The top angler was Reelaxe angler Jose Esponoza, with a personal best and tournament record of 59 released striped marlin in a single day. Prior to that, in November 2007, the crew of the sport fishing vessel ''Reelaxe'', fishing on the Finger Bank, set a one-day catch record of 179 striped marlin.

;Australia
Although [[Australia]] is known for its black, and more recently blue, marlin fishery, striped marlin are often found in the subtropical waters of the vast island continent and are a popular target for Australian anglers. The country's largest interclub tournament is held at the Port Stephens area of New South Wales, and has produced several striped marlin records on ultralight and fly tackle. Larger striped marlin in the {{convert|250|to|300|lb|adj=on}}-plus class often show up in the southern part of their range.  Batemans Bay, Ulladulla and Bermagui are where fish of this class can be encountered. Live baiting, with such baits as slimy mackerel and skipjack tuna, and trolling artificial lures are the two most common techniques here, but many top crews have experienced success with fly-rod and light-tackle records using the bait-and-switch technique.

;Ecuador
The [[Galapagos Islands]] are home to great concentrations of striped marlin.  "Sport fishing" is technically prohibited in the Galapagos, but visitors may legally engage in what is known as ''pesca vivencial'', or recreational fishing with licensed local guides.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.savegalapagos.org/galapagos/pesca-vivencial.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; Guides targeting marlin operate from the island of San Cristobal. The warmer "wet" season between December and June is best for higher numbers, but larger striped marlin ({{convert|200|lb|disp=or|adj=on}}-plus range) are caught during the colder late summer months.

Striped marlin are also fished from the Ecuadorian mainland. Salinas in the southern part of the country and Manta further north are the main sport-fishing bases in Ecuador. The cold Humboldt Current from the south meets the equatorial current along the Ecuadorian coastline, and when conditions are right, the combination of current, colour, and temperature breaks amass concentrations of baitfish that attract large striped marlin, as well as larger blue and black marlin, yellowfin, and bigeye tuna.

;Kenya
Striped marlin are one of three marlin species that appear in east African waters. Kenya has the most well-developed sport fishery in this region, and every year, boats from Malindi, Lamu, and Watamu in the north, as well as Shimoni in the south, have excellent striped marlin fishing.

;New Zealand
Marlin fishing in New Zealand waters dates back to the turn of the 20th century. Some of the largest striped marlin, over {{convert|400|lb}}, have been caught in New Zealand. The all-tackle striped marlin record of {{convert|494|lb}} is held here, and striped marlin of over {{convert|300|lb}} are caught in New Zealand waters every year. Some New Zealand anglers, often fishing in small trailerable boats, pursue striped marlin from Houhoura and the North Cape in the far north of the country to as far south as Gisborne, Raglan, and Napier in the south. Lure fishing is a popular fishing technique used by New Zealand marlin fishermen, with many good fish also being taken on live and rigged dead baits.

==White marlin==
[[File:White Marlin in North Carolina 1394318584.jpg|thumb|right|[[White marlin]]]]
{{main|Atlantic white marlin}}

White marlin (''Tetrapturus albidus'') are distributed throughout the tropical and seasonally temperate oceanic waters of the Atlantic. The smallest of the marlin species, with a potential maximum size of around {{convert|220|lb}}, they are sought after not for their size, but for their speed, leaping ability, elegant beauty, and the difficulty that anglers often encounter in baiting and hooking them. They are a premier light-tackle gamefish.

The "hatchet marlin", long thought to be a variant of the white marlin distinguished by dorsal and anal fins with a chopped-off rather than rounded appearance, has recently been confirmed as a separate species in the genus ''Tetrapturus'', the [[roundscale spearfish]].&lt;ref&gt;See Mahmood, S. et al, ''Validity, identification, and distribution of the roundscale spearfish, ''Tetrapturus georgii'' (''Teleostei: Istiophoridae''): morphological and molecular evidence,'' Bulletin of Marine Science, Volume 79, Number 3, November 2006, pp. 483-491(9), available at http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/umrsmas/bullmar/2006/00000079/00000003/art00005&lt;/ref&gt;  Nearly indistinguishable from white marlin, most tournaments treat hatchet marlin catches as white marlin.  Both species are fished for in the same way.

White marlin feed on a variety of schooling baitfish, including sardine, herring, and other clupeoids; squid; mackerel; scad; [[saury]]; and smaller tuna-like fishes, such as frigate and bullet tuna.  Like their close relatives the striped marlin, and sailfish, white marlin will often group together to corral schooling baitfish into a tight group for feeding purposes, a phenomenon commonly referred to as "balling bait".  When this occurs, it is common for two or more fish to be raised to the baits or hooked up simultaneously.

===Angling destinations===

Where environmental conditions (temperature, water colour and clarity) are favourable, white marlin often forage in shallow water well inshore of the continental shelf, taking advantage of the abundant baitfish resources often found in these areas.

;Brazil

Brazil is home to most of the largest white marlin in the International Game Fish Association (IGFA) record books. The IGFA all-tackle record is held by a Brazilian fish of {{convert|181|lb}}.  Areas such as the Charlotte Bank have large numbers of white marlin, as well as blue marlin, sailfish, and other blue-water gamefish such as tuna and dorado.

;United States

[[Cape Hatteras]], Oregon Inlet, and other fishing areas along the coast of [[North Carolina]] benefit from the close proximity of the Gulf Stream. White marlin are often targeted by the skilled charter crews and recreational sport fisherman who fish this area, with August and September often providing some exceptional fishing.

Trolling with natural baits, predominantly ballyhoo, is the most effective method, and rigging and fishing techniques have been continuously refined and perfected over the years by the many skilled crewmen who work these waters.

From around mid-July onwards, white marlin, as well as the other species of Gulf Stream gamefish such as dolphinfish, yellowfin, and bigeye tuna, start showing up in the continental shelf canyons offshore of [[Maryland]], [[Virginia]] and [[Delaware]].  The Jack Spot, an area of bottom structure {{convert|22|mi}} south of [[Ocean City, Maryland|Ocean City]], Maryland, was for many years the most famed white marlin location in the United States. White marlin were first caught here as early as 1934, and in 1939, 171 whites were boated in a single day (July 29) here. The years 1969-1971 had some exceptional white marlin fishing with over 2,000 fish being caught or released per year.  Ocean City is now home to one of the East Coast's premier marlin tournaments, the White Marlin Open.

;Venezuela

The La Guaira Bank off the coast of Venezuela hosts great concentrations of white marlin in season. White marlin can be encountered year-round, but autumn is considered the best time to target them in Venezuelan waters.  Venezuelan anglers such as Aquiles Garcia, Rafael Arnal, Ronnie Morrison, and Ruben Jaen honed their techniques and tackle in these fish-rich waters, and their experiences have contributed to many light-tackle billfishing techniques commonly used today.

==Threats==

The main threat to marlin, along with other [[Highly migratory species|highly migratory]] [[pelagic fish]], is commercial fishing. Billfish of all species are taken as commercial targets and as bycatch in tuna and swordfish fisheries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenpeace.org/international/seafood/red-list-of-species Greenpeace International Seafood Red list] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820034707/http://www.greenpeace.org/international/seafood/red-list-of-species |date=2010-08-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another major threat to marlin are recreational competitions that run using "catch anything" practices, such as [[Longline fishing|longline]] fishing, [[Drift netting|driftnet]] fishing and other indiscriminate methods. There is also insufficient regulation to ensure that fisheries comply with rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://wwf.panda.org/knowledge_hub/endangered_species/swordfish_billfish/|title=Swordfish &amp; Billfish|access-date=2018-11-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hypoxia (environmental)|Hypoxia]] may also be a threat to billfish populations due to the widespread decrease in life-supporting oxygen levels in more and more large areas of our oceans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Breitburg|first=Denise|last2=Levin|first2=Lisa A.|last3=Oschlies|first3=Andreas|last4=Grégoire|first4=Marilaure|last5=Chavez|first5=Francisco P.|last6=Conley|first6=Daniel J.|last7=Garçon|first7=Véronique|last8=Gilbert|first8=Denis|last9=Gutiérrez|first9=Dimitri|date=2018-01-05|title=Declining oxygen in the global ocean and coastal waters|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6371/eaam7240|journal=Science|language=en|volume=359|issue=6371|pages=eaam7240|doi=10.1126/science.aam7240|issn=0036-8075|pmid=29301986}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sportfishingmag.com/invisible-threat-to-billfish|title=Invisible Threat to Billfish|work=Sport Fishing Magazine|access-date=2018-11-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Greenpeace International added the striped marlin, white marlin, Atlantic blue marlin, black marlin, and Indo-pacific blue marlin to its [[:Category:Seafood red list|seafood red list]].

==Conservation==

Founded in 1986 by [[Winthrop P. Rockefeller]], The Billfish Foundation (TBF) is the world's leading nonprofit organization dedicated to conserving billfish and associated species worldwide which helps ensure healthy oceans and strong coastal economies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.billfish.org/ TBF] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060902160105/http://www.billfish.org/ |date=2006-09-02 }} website&lt;/ref&gt; TBF's signature research project is the traditional [[tag and release]] program that uses the efforts of anglers to provide data and research to scientists and fisheries managers. Awareness of the need to conserve billfish stocks worldwide has led to an increasing trend for recreational anglers and skippers to release their catches in as healthy a condition as possible. In some areas of the world, commercial fishing for striped, black, and blue marlin has been banned.

'''Martin Erler''' (c. 1920&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swiss-stamps.us/Tell/T231.pdf ''Tell''.] Vol. XXIII, No. 1, January, 1997, p. 18. [https://www.webcitation.org/6ToD7e119?url=http://www.swiss-stamps.us/Tell/T231.pdf Archived here.]&lt;/ref&gt; - 11 August 2014&lt;ref&gt;"Membership News", ''[[The London Philatelist]]'', Vol. 123, No. 1419, October 2014, p. 353.&lt;/ref&gt;) was a German [[philatelist]] who was an expert on the [[revenue stamps]] of Germany who with John A. Norton (died June 1980&lt;ref&gt;Foreword, ''Catalogue of the Adhesive Revenues of Germany Vol.VII'', ORA-Verlag, Icking, Germany, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;) wrote the only comprehensive catalogue of German revenue stamps.

== Publications ==
The first volumes of the Erler catalogue were based mainly on the author's own collections and a 1961 work by John Norton.&lt;ref&gt;Foreword, ''Catalogue of the Adhesive Revenues of Germany Vol.I'' , ORA-Verlag, Icking, Germany, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; Later volumes were prepared from the author's research and as new items come on to the philatelic market.

Erler also wrote a number of other works on revenue philately on subjects about which little else has been published and contributed many articles to ''The American Revenuer'', the journal of the [[American Revenue Association]].

== Organised philately ==
Erler was a member of the [[Royal Philatelic Society London]] (RPSL) since 1990 and was made a Fellow in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;''The Royal Philatelic Society London 2008–2009 – Membership list'', p. iv.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1991, Erler gave a display to the RPSL on the ''Revenue Stamped Papers in the Wurzburg Area of Northern Bavaria during Napoleonic Times'', which was described by [[Clive Akerman]] as including material of the "utmost rarity".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Revenue Society|The Revenue Journal]]'', Vol. 2, No. 1, June 1991, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Erler has been credited with being one of the individuals who was instrumental in having revenue philately accepted as a distinct competitive class in its own right by the [[Fédération Internationale de Philatélie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5w0scHLsL?url=http://www.fip-revenue.org/Juhani_Olamo.doc |archivedate=26 January 2011 |accessdate=3 February 2011 |publisher=FIP Revenue Commission |url=http://www.fip-revenue.org/Juhani_Olamo.doc |format=doc |title=Obituary for Juhani Olamo |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards ==
Erler won awards for his displays of "The Revenue Stamps of Kurhessen (Hesse-Cassel)" at the ''Bangkok World Philatelic Exhibition''&lt;ref&gt;"Bangkok World Philatelic Exhibition 1993" in ''The London Philatelist'', Vol. 102, No. 1211, December 1993, p. 336.&lt;/ref&gt; and "The Revenue Stamps of the Austro-Hungarian Military Border" at ''Australia 99''.&lt;ref name=fip&gt;[http://www.fip-revenue.org/pag/The%20Results%20of%20Multi-Frame%20Exhibits%20in%20FIP%20Revenue%20Class%201988-2010.pdf The Results of Multi-Frame Exhibits in FIP Revenue Class 1988-2010.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726055156/http://www.fip-revenue.org/pag/The%20Results%20of%20Multi-Frame%20Exhibits%20in%20FIP%20Revenue%20Class%201988-2010.pdf |date=2011-07-26 }} Retrieved 3 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Melinoë''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ɪ|ˈ|l|ɪ|n|oʊ|i}}; {{lang-grc|Μηλινόη}}) is a [[chthonic]] [[nymph]] or goddess invoked in one of the [[Orphic Hymns]] and propitiated as a bringer of nightmares and madness.&lt;ref&gt;Orphic Hymn 70 or 71 (numbering varies), as given by [[:de:Richard Wünsch|Richard Wünsch]], ''Antikes Zaubergerät aus Pergamon'' (Berlin, 1905), p. 26:&lt;br&gt;Μηλινόην καλέω, νύμφην [[Chthonia|χθονίαν]], κροκόπεπλον,&lt;br&gt;ἣν παρὰ Κωκυτοῦ προχοαῖς ἐλοχεύσατο σεμνὴ&lt;br&gt;Φερσεφόνη λέκτροις ἱεροῖς Ζηνὸς Κρονίοιο&lt;br&gt;ᾗ ψευσθεὶς Πλούτων᾽ἐμίγη δολίαις ἀπάταισι,&lt;br&gt;θυμῷ Φερσεφόνης δὲ διδώματον ἔσπασε χροιήν,&lt;br&gt;ἣ θνητοὺς μαίνει φαντάσμασιν ἠερίοισιν,&lt;br&gt;ἀλλοκότοις ἰδέαις μορφῆς τὐπον έκκπροφανοῦσα,&lt;br&gt;ἀλλοτε μὲν προφανής, ποτὲ δὲ σκοτόεσσα, νυχαυγής,&lt;br&gt;ἀνταίαις ἐφόδοισι κατὰ ζοφοειδέα νύκτα.&lt;br&gt;ἀλλἀ, θεά, λίτομαί σε, καταχθονίων Βασίλεια,&lt;br&gt;ψυχῆς ἐκπέμπειν οἶστρον ἐπὶ τέρματα γαίης,&lt;br&gt;εὐμενὲς εὐίερον μύσταις φαίνουσα πρόσωπον.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The name also appears on a metal tablet in association with [[Persephone]].&lt;ref&gt;Edmonds, [https://books.google.com/books?id=_XsN0O_BQ0cC&amp;pg=PA100 p. 100 n. 58]; [[Apostolos Athanassakis|Athanassakis]] and Wolkow, [https://books.google.com/books?id=TTo3r8IHy0wC&amp;pg=PA195 p. 195].&lt;/ref&gt; The hymns are of uncertain date but were probably composed in the 2nd or 3rd century AD. In the hymn, Melinoë has characteristics that seem similar to [[Hecate]] and the [[Erinyes]],&lt;ref&gt;Edmonds, [https://books.google.com/books?id=_XsN0O_BQ0cC&amp;pg=PA84 pp. 84&amp;ndash;85].&lt;/ref&gt; and the name is sometimes thought to be an [[epithet]] of Hecate.&lt;ref&gt;Ivana Petrovic, ''Von den Toren des Hades zu den Hallen des Olymp'' (Brill, 2007), p. 94; W. Schmid and O. Stählin,  ''Geschichte der griechischen Literatur'' (C.H. Beck, 1924, 1981), vol. 2, pt. 2, p. 982; [[Wilhelm Heinrich Roscher|W.H. Roscher]], ''Ausführliches Lexikon der griechischen und römischen Mythologie'' (Leipzig: Teubner, 1890–94), vol. 2, pt. 2, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; The terms in which Melinoë is described are typical of moon goddesses in Greek poetry.

==Name==
''Melinoë'' may derive from Greek ''mēlinos'' (μήλινος), "having the color of [[quince]]", from ''mēlon'' (μῆλον), "tree fruit".&lt;ref&gt;Morand, [https://books.google.com/books?id=AQBEckWmM4AC&amp;pg=PA127 p. 127], citing H. Bannert, ''[[Realencyclopädie der Classischen Altertumswissenschaft|RE]]'' suppl. 15, entry on "Melinoe" (1978), p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; The fruit's yellowish-green color evoked the pallor of illness or death for the Greeks. A name derived from ''melas,'' "black", would be ''melan-'', not ''melin-''.&lt;ref&gt;Morand, p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hymn==
[[File:Adolf Hiremy-Hirschl, Die Seelen des Acheron.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|''The Souls of Acheron'' (1898) by [[Adolf Hirémy-Hirschl]]]]
Following is the translation by [[Apostolos Athanassakis]] and Benjamin M. Wolkow, of the hymn to Melinoe: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;I call upon Melinoe, saffron-cloaked nymph of the earth,&lt;br&gt;whom revered Persephone bore by the mouth of the Kokytos river&lt;br&gt;upon the sacred bed of [[Cronus|Kronian]] Zeus.&lt;br&gt;In the guise of Plouton Zeus and tricked Persephone and through wiley plots bedded her;&lt;br&gt;a two-bodied specter sprang forth from Persephone's fury.&lt;br&gt;This specter drives mortals to madness with her airy apparitions&lt;br&gt;as she appears in weird shapes and strange forms,&lt;br&gt;now plain to the eye, now shadowy, now shining in the darkness&amp;mdash;&lt;br&gt;all this in unnerving attacks in the gloom of night.&lt;br&gt;O goddess, O queen of those below, I beseech you&lt;br&gt;to banish the soul's frenzy to the ends of the earth,&lt;br&gt;show to the initiates a kindly and holy face.&lt;ref&gt;Athanassaki and Wolkow, [https://books.google.com/books?id=TTo3r8IHy0wC&amp;pg=PA57 p. 57].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Birth==
Melinoë is the daughter of Persephone and was fathered by both Zeus and Hades in their Orphic dual-god role &lt;ref&gt; Melinoë is often regarded as being the daughter of both Zeus and Hades as is explained in the hymn's mentioning that Melinoë has traits of both Hades and Zeus. The reason for this is due to the dual-god role that Zeus had with Hades in Orphic Mythology.&lt;/ref&gt;.

A major contributory factor surrounding Melinoe’s birth is the fact that Hades and Zeus were, at times, syncretised with each other&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hermaphrodites, Gynomorphs and Jesus: She-male Gods and the roots of Christianity|last=Hillman|first=David C. A.|publisher=Ronin Publishing|others=Classics Ph.D|year=2013|isbn=1579511716|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Hillman “Hades and Zeus are the very same thing. Persephone and Semele are the very same thing. Dionysus is not just Dionysus, but Zagreus, Iacchos and Dionysus together, as a unity…” (''Hermaphrodites, Gynomorphs and Jesus: She-male Gods and the roots of Christianity'')&lt;/ref&gt;. The Orphics in particular believed that Zeus and Hades were the same deity and portrayed them as such&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Images of Eternal Beauty in Funerary Verse Inscriptions of the Hellenistic Period|last=Wypustek|first=Andrzej|publisher=BRILL|year=2012|isbn=9004233180|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://translate.google.com.au/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=pl&amp;u=https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrzej_Wypustek&amp;prev=search Andrzej Wypustek (Ph.D)] "Votive inscriptions frequently mentioned Pluto but very rarely Hades. Particularly at Eleusis, the Pluto cult was for a deity who, like Persephone and Demeter, was favourably disposed to humans. He was frequently portrayed as a majestic elder with a sceptre, ranch, cornucopia , pomegranate, or drinking vessel in his hand; sometimes he was accompanied by an eagle. His iconography resembled that of Zeus, and especially that of some chthonic personification of the ruler of the gods, above all Zeus Meilichios. We can now go a step further. The nearest equivalent to the contrast between Hades and Pluto as presented in the Theophile epigram can be found in the Orphic Hymns, which are assumed to have originated from the Τελεται of the Dionysiac mystic circles in Asia Minor of the 1st – 3rd centuries. Hymn 41 worships Antaia, i.e. Demeter, the goddess who had searched for her daughter in Hades and discovered her in ‘the sacred bed of the sacred chthonic Zeus’. This formulation in itself is not surprising because the name Zeus (as a synonym for a deity and ruler) was used in reference to Hades-Pluto as the ruler of the underworld. In an interesting, though, sadly, only partly preserved inscription from Appia-Murathanlar in the Tembris Valley (in 3rd century AD Phrygia) the deceased appeals to “Zeus, god of the dead [φθιηένων*], Pluto” to protect his grave. The term “Chthonic Zeus” could, however, mean something more than a mere euphemism for the name Hades. The idea of defining Zeus as χθόνιος, κατα (χθόνιος) ἄλλος or simply Hades had been present in ancient Greek literature from Homer to Nonnos. This was a sort of extension, aspect or ‘shadow’ of the universal power of Zeus in the kingdom of the dead, where he was the judge of the dead and the also the consort of Persephone-Kore.Moreover, he was the provider of riches, Πλουτοδότης; a personification which was abbreviated to Πλούτων. Among other things, he controlled the crops and it was to him (as well as to Demeter) that the farmers turned for the promise of a good harvest. These are hardly well known traditions today. Some scholars maintain that their obscurity is on account of the secret role they played in the mysteries. … Therefore the Orphics worshipped Pluto as the saviour and judge of the deceased, as Zeus χθόνιος. They most likely assumed that Zeus had another embodiment of sorts in the underworld, in Hades. The effect of this assumption was the myth, known to us in several versions, of how Zeus had lain with Persephone (even though she was his daughter). The so-called great Orphic tablet of Thurii refers to the abduction of Persephone by Zeus, who then fathers her son, Dionysus. Their child was revered by the Orphics as Dionysus Zagreus, Dionysus Iacchus, which shows how much importance they attached to the love affair of that particular couple." (''Images of Eternal Beauty in Funerary Verse Inscriptions of the Hellenistic Period'')&lt;/ref&gt;. Zeus was portrayed as having an incarnation in the underworld identifying him as literally being Hades and leading to Zeus and Hades essentially being two representations and different facets of the same god and extended divine power&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Early Greek Myth|last=Gantz|first=Timothy|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|year=1996|isbn=978-0-8018-5360-9|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Timothy Gantz]] "Thus it appears that at times Zeus and Hades represented simply different facets of a single extended divine power.” (''Early Greek Myth'')&lt;/ref&gt;. The Orphic Hymn to Melinoë also references this by mentioning that Persephone was impregnated upon the bed of Zeus Kronion in the Underworld by the River Cocytus. The hymn regarding Zeus taking on the form of Plouton before impregnating Persephone was very much related to the very nature of the way the gods were portrayed and worshiped in the Orphic Religion, as well as be the explanation for why both Hades and Zeus are considered to be the father of Melinoë; moreover it is believed that Persephone's resulting anger is derived from several things: the separation from her mother&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Homeric Hymns|last1=Athanaassakis|first1=Apostolos N|date=|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|year=2004|isbn=0801879833|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Homer's Hymn To Demeter "And he found the Lord inside his palace, seated on a funeral couch, along with his duly acquired bedmate, the one who was much under duress, yearning for her mother, and suffering from the unbearable things inflicted on her by the will of the blessed ones."&lt;/ref&gt;, the loss of her virginity&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Claudian/De_Raptu_Proserpinae/1*.html|title=Claudian's Rape of Proserpina|last=Thayer|first=Bill|website=LacusCurtius|access-date=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Claudian's Rape of Proserpina "Meanwhile Proserpine is borne away in the winged car, her hair streaming before the wind, beating her arms in lamentation and calling in vain remonstrance to the clouds: Â "Why hast thou not hurled at me, father, bolts forged by the Cyclopes' hands?

...

Diodorus Siculus mentions that Persephone had already taken the same choice of maidenhood as Athena and Artemis. 

... 

Other evidence includes the fact that Persephone is connected to the pomegranate, the bee and weaving. These objects all represent parthenogenesis, a form of asexual reproduction which needs no fertilisation; in the Orphic Persephone was weaving a peplos when she got raped, the peplos being another symbol of virginity and asexual conception.

... 

Given that Zeus was also sometimes portrayed as having an incarnation in the underworld that was closely identified with Hades, we can read here that Zeus and Hades were essentially two representations of the same god.

...

The idea of Hades equals Dionysus, and that this dual god impregnated Persephone in the Eleusinian tradition, therefore, is in perfect accord with the story that Zeus impregnated her with Dionysus in Orphic myth, given that Hades equals Zeus, as well. Moreover, what we see from this esoteric complex is that, in seeding Persephone, Zeus/Hades/Dionysus created what Kerenyi perceptively calls “a second, a little Dionysus,” a “subterranean Zeus.” 

This insight, taken in the context of the parthenogenetic theory I have put forth here, allows for a sudden and striking realisation: The male godhead used Persephone as a means not just to procreate, but to self-replicate, to double himself in the way a goddess could do on her own. Because he lacked the power ascribed to the goddess alone-parthenogenetic ability he could only turn to the body of the goddess to emit the next generation of himself. He did so wilfully and without permission." (''Virgin Mother Goddesses of Antiquity'')&lt;/ref&gt;, thus bearing children from that union&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Orphic Hymns|last=Athanaassakis, Wolkow|first=Apostolos N, Benjamin M|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|year=2013|isbn=978-1421408828|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Apostolos N Athanaassakis &amp; Benjamin M Wolkow "In Orphic mythology, he took the form of a snake when he father Dionysus by Persephone. Since Dionysus has the same parentage in the ''Hymns'', it is possible that this act was understood by the initiates to have also produced Melinoë. The snake, as symbol of chthonic powers, would be an appropriate form to produce such an infernal creature, and both Dionysus and Melinoë are connected with madness."&lt;/ref&gt;.

Melinoë is born at the mouth of the [[Cocytus]], one of the rivers of the [[Greek underworld|underworld]], where [[Hermes]] in his [[chthonic|underworld aspect]] as [[psychopomp]] was stationed.&lt;ref&gt;''Hymn to Chthonic Hermes'' (57); Morand, p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Orphic tradition, the Cocytus is one of four underworld rivers.&lt;ref&gt;In other mythological traditions, it had been regarded as a branch of the [[River Styx|Styx]]; Morand, p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although some [[Greek mythology|Greek myths]] deal with themes of incest, in Orphic genealogies lines of kinship, express theological and [[cosmogony|cosmogonical]] concepts, not the realities of human family relations.&lt;ref&gt;Morand, pp. 184–185.&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient Greek ''nymphē'' in the first line can mean "[[nymph]]", but also "bride" or "young woman".&lt;ref&gt;Morand, p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; As an underworld "queen" ''(Basileia)'', Melinoë is at least partially [[syncretism|syncretized]] with Persephone herself.&lt;ref&gt;Morand, p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attributes and functions==
Melinoë is described in the invocation of the Orphic Hymn as ''krokopeplos,'' "clad in saffron" (see ''[[peplos]]''), an epithet in ancient Greek poetry for moon goddesses.&lt;ref&gt;In the ''[[Iliad]]'' (8.1 and 19.1), the dawn goddess [[Eos]] is ''krokopeplos''; Eva Parisinou, "Brightness Personified: Light and Divine Image in Ancient Greece," in ''Personification In The Greek World: From Antiquity To Byzantium'' (Ashgate, 2005), p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; In the hymns, only two goddesses are described as ''krokopeplos,'' Melinoë and Hecate.&lt;ref&gt;Morand, pp. 127, 182; Pierre Brulé, ''La fille d'Athènes: la religion des filles à Athènes à l'époque classique'' (CNRS, 1987), p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt;

Melinoë's connections to Hecate and Hermes suggest that she exercised her power in the realm of the soul's passage, and in that function may be compared to the torchbearer [[Eubouleos]] in the [[mystery religions|mysteries]].&lt;ref&gt;Morand, pp. 182, 185.&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to the hymn, she brings night terrors to mortals by manifesting in strange forms, "now plain to the eye, now shadowy, now shining in the darkness", and can drive mortals insane. The purpose of the hymn is to placate her by showing that the Orphic initiate understands and respects her nature, thereby averting the harm she has the capacity for causing.

The translation of [[Thomas Taylor (neoplatonist)|Thomas Taylor]] (1887) has given rise to a conception of Melinoe as half-black, half-white, representing the duality of the heavenly Zeus and the infernal Pluto. This had been the interpretation of [[Gottfried Hermann]] in his annotated text of the hymns in 1805.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gottfried Hermann]] , ''Orphica'' (Leipzig, 1805), p. 340.&lt;/ref&gt; This duality may be implicit, like the explanation offered by [[Servius]] for why the poplar leaf has a light and dark side to represent [[Leuce (mythology)|Leuke]] ("White"), a nymph loved by Pluto. The Orphic text poses interpretational challenges for translators in this passage.&lt;ref&gt;Hermann, ''Orphica,'' p. 340.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inscriptions==
[[File:Magic tablet from Pergamon (Wünsch, Antikes Zaubergerät).png|thumb|upright=1.4|Bronze tablet (3rd century AD) from Pergamon invoking Melinoë along with Persephone and Leucophryne; the three goddesses pictured are labeled as Dione, Phoebe, and Nyche]]
Melinoë appears on a bronze tablet for use in the kind of private ritual usually known as [[Magic in the Greco-Roman world|"magic"]]. The style of [[Greek alphabet|Greek letters]] on the tablet, which was discovered at [[Pergamon]], dates it to the first half of the 3rd century AD. The use of [[bronze]] was probably intended to drive away malevolent spirits and to protect the practitioner. The construction of the tablet suggests that it was used for [[divination]]. It is triangular in shape, with a hole in the center, presumably for suspending it over a surface.

The content of the triangular tablet reiterates triplicity. It depicts three crowned goddesses, each with her head pointing at an angle and her feet pointing toward the center. The name of the goddess appears above her head: [[Dione (mythology)|Dione]] (ΔΙΟΝΗ), [[Artemis|Phoebe]] (ΦΟΙΒΙΗ), and the obscure Nyche (ΝΥΧΙΗ). ''Amibousa,'' a word referring to the phases of the moon, is written under each goddess's feet. Densely inscribed spells frame each goddess: the inscriptions around Dione and Nyche are ''[[voces magicae]]'', incantatory syllables ("magic words") that are mostly untranslatable. Melinoë appears in a triple invocation that is part of the inscription around Phoebe: ''O Persephone, O Melinoë, O Leucophryne''. Esoteric symbols are inscribed on the edges of the triangle.&lt;ref&gt;Morand, p. 185ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Milah Abraham is led by Ahmad Mushaddeq, who in the 1990s began to believe that he was receiving messages from [[God]], and that he was a successor to [[Muhammad]].&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Atlantic"/&gt; His beliefs became known as Milah Abraham, which accumulated approximately 50,000 followers in [[Indonesia]] and [[Malaysia]].&lt;ref name="Atlantic"/&gt; Mushaddeq’s followers also began a back-to-the-land movement emphasizing [[organic farming]] and agrarian self-sufficiency, known as Gafatar.&lt;ref name="Atlantic"/&gt;

===Persecution===

Gafatar encouraged its followers to sell their possessions and move to more rural farmland in [[Borneo]], in order to avoid persecution by Indonesian authorities.&lt;ref name="Atlantic"/&gt; In January 2016 Gafatar was banned by Indonesian authorities, and a mob destroyed the Gafatar compound in [[West Kalimantan]].&lt;ref name="Atlantic"/&gt; Indonesian authorities detained approximately 7,000 practitioners and began relocation and re-educating them.&lt;ref name="Atlantic"/&gt; More than 25 members were charged with [[blasphemy]].&lt;ref name="Atlantic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

==Beliefs==
Millah Abraham teaches that the major [[Abrahamic religions]], including [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]], have been corrupted by humans, necessitating a sequence of new [[prophets]]. It claims to be the latest installation of the Abrahamic religions.&lt;ref name="Atlantic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

A '''''moe'' book''' (萌え本) is a type of instructional book using cute, young-looking characters – collectively referred to as ''[[Moe (slang)|moe]]'' or ''[[bishōjo]]'' (female) and ''[[bishōnen]]'' (male) – for tutorial purposes, with some illustrated in [[comic book]] format.

==History==

The oldest known moe book was the ''Copyright and Legal Guide for Computer Users'' (コンピュータユーザのための著作権&amp;法律ガイド), published in September 2002.  In ''[[Moeru Eitango Moetan]]'', published in November 2003, full visual was added. English words examples are heavily inspired by [[American Comics Group|ACG]], resulting in over 200,000 books sold.  Later, Shuwa System, Eagle Publishing joined the moe book business.  In February 2006, Enterbrain published ''Moeken'', which explicitly targeted fans of ''moe''. Also, Ikaros started to publish ''moe'' books.

Greene]] and [[Dennis Meissner]] that first appeared in the Fall/Winter 2005 issue of ''[[American Archivist|The American Archivist]]''.&lt;ref name="GM" /&gt;{{rp|208}} The paper argues that traditional [[archival processing]] is too slow and advocates for the use of minimal processing in order to reduce backlogs and provide access to archival collections as quickly as possible.&lt;ref name=GM&gt;{{cite journal |last=Greene |first=Mark A. |author2=Dennis Meissner |title=More Product, Less Process: Revamping Traditional Archival Processing |journal=[[American Archivist]] |volume=68 |year=2005 |pages=208–263|URL=http://www.archivists.org/prof-education/pre-readings/IMPLP/AA68.2.MeissnerGreene.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|208}} The ideology presented in the article, abbreviated as '''MPLP''',  has since been widely adopted in modern archival theory with subsequent praise directed primarily towards the ability to increase user accessibility without prohibiting the option for future processing.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://medium.com/archives-records/the-pros-and-cons-of-mplp-586b0efc8fba |title=The Pros and Cons of 'MPLP'|last=Mersiovsky|first=Kate |date=2014-12-14|website=Archives &amp; Memory |access-date=2018-04-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://siarchives.si.edu/blog/how-much-enough|title=How Much is Enough? |date=August 17, 2010 |publisher=Smithsonian Institution Archives|access-date=2018-04-24|last=Wright |first=Jennifer|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Owens" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bromley" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Moore" /&gt;

== Article summary ==

=== Call to action ===
[[File:Archive boxes.JPG|thumb|Archival storage boxes]]
Greene and Meissner begin the article with a call to action, citing the British report ''[[Best Value and Local Authority Archives]]'', which claims that archival [[cataloging]], arrangement, and description are "not working" and that growing backlogs are "weakening the archival profession".&lt;ref name="GM" /&gt;{{rp|208–9}} The authors hypothesize that "processing projects squander scarce resources", and that it is thus necessary to entirely reframe the discussion about processing rather than simply suggesting a new processing technique.&lt;ref name="GM" /&gt;{{rp|209}} Their methodology included a [[literature review]], an overview of [[National Historical Publications and Records Commission]] (NHPRC) [[grants]], two [[Survey methodology|surveys]], and examination of other relevant studies.&lt;ref name="GM" /&gt;{{rp|209}}

Greene and Meissner discuss what they perceive to be problems with processing and cite a 1998 [[Association of Research Libraries]] (ARL) survey of [[special collections]] units which found that nearly a third of [[manuscript]] collections made up uncatalogued backlogs.&lt;ref name="GM" /&gt;{{rp|210}} 

The authors present a new set of guidelines for arrangement, preservation, and description:

# Expediting the availability of collections to users;
# Assuring ''adequate'' arrangement of materials for users' needs;
# Taking the ''minimum ''steps necessary for physically preserving collection materials;
# Describing materials ''sufficiently'' for use.&lt;ref name="GM" /&gt;{{rp|212–3}}

=== Major findings ===
The authors argue that arrangement at the [[Fonds|''item'' level]] is not necessary and instead emphasize the importance of creating [[Finding aid|finding aids]] for collections instead.&lt;ref name="GM" /&gt;{{rp|214–20}} The authors then discuss the rate at which [[Archivist|archivists]] are able to process collections, citing a 1982 study by [[Karen Temple Lynch]] and [[Thomas E. Lynch]] that put the figure at 12.7 hours per cubic foot.&lt;ref name="GM" /&gt;{{rp|223}} Further citing a study by the [[Billy Graham Center|Billy Graham Center Archives]] that found the cost of processing as high as 15.1 hours and $374 per foot,&lt;ref name="GM" /&gt;{{rp|225–6}} Greene and Meissner lament that with regard to processing, archivists "have utterly failed to come to grips with a critical administrative reality, a reality that eats 90 percent of our direct program expenditures".&lt;ref name="GM" /&gt;{{rp|227}}

The authors propose five major findings from their research:

# Arrangement was still often at the item level;
# Only 51% of repositories were regularly putting [[finding aid|finding aids]] online;
# While most repositories have some preservation considerations, very few do it consistently;
# Repositories were not responding to the challenges presented by backlogs;
# Many of the repositories store their collections in appropriate [[temperature]] and [[relative humidity]] conditions, but still feel the need to remove metal fasteners (which the authors argue is unnecessary).&lt;ref name="GM" /&gt;{{rp|230–1}}

=== Principles for change ===
Recognizing that tradeoffs must be made, Greene and Meissner argue that some preservation concerns must be given up for the sake of providing effective access to users of collections.&lt;ref name="GM" /&gt;{{rp|236–7}} 

They then present their "principles for change" as recommendations for [[Archivist|archivists]]:

* The Golden Minimum: to reach the processing requirements of current and future users at the most basic level.&lt;ref name="GM" /&gt;{{rp|240–1}}
* Arrangement: As opposed to organization of individual items, arranging collections at the [[Fonds|series and folder levels]] simplifies and facilitates research for prospective users.&lt;ref name="GM" /&gt;{{rp|241}}
* Description: to embody the materials, provide context and access information to the user, and reflect the level of arrangement.&lt;ref name="GM" /&gt;{{rp|245–6}}
* Preservation: Modern climate controlled storage can be trusted to preserve materials following minimalist processing. &lt;ref name="GM" /&gt;{{rp|251}}
* Policies: “Unprocessed collections should be presumed open to researchers. Period.”&lt;ref name="GM" /&gt;{{rp|252}}
* Metrics: Consistency must be established at the most basic acceptable level among all aspects of [[archival processing]].&lt;ref name="GM" /&gt;{{rp|252}}

"More Product, Less Process" concludes that because greater funding and resources are not forthcoming, archivists must "change the way we process so that we can, with our existing resources, roughly triple the speed with which we process".&lt;ref name="GM" /&gt;{{rp|254}}  The authors acknowledge the difficulty of their prospective changes, similar issues that [[Librarian|librarians]] face, and the innovative processing work done at institutions including [[Arizona State University]], [[Yale University]], [[Marquette University]], the [[University of Central Florida]], the [[University of Montana]], and the [[Wisconsin Historical Society]].&lt;ref name="GM" /&gt;{{rp|255–6}}

== Influence and reception ==
The minimal processing approach advocated by "More Product, Less Process" has been implemented by many archives and [[library|libraries]], including but not limited to the [[Library of Congress]], the [[University of North Carolina]]'s Wilson Library, and the Academic Health Center Archives at the [[University of Minnesota]].&lt;ref name="Owens"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://blogs.loc.gov/digitalpreservation/2012/08/more-product-less-process-for-born-digital-collections-reflections-on-curatecamp-processing/|title = More Product, Less Process for Born-Digital Collections: Reflections on CurateCamp Processing|date = August 22, 2012|accessdate = August 26, 2014|website = The Signal: Digital Preservation|publisher = [[Library of Congress]]|last = Owens|first = Trevor}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bromley"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://amongotheritems.org/2009/11/more-product-less-process/|title = More Product, Less Process|date = November 1, 2009|accessdate = August 26, 2014|website = Among Other Items|publisher = [[WordPress]]|last = Bromley|first = Ben}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Moore"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://editions.lib.umn.edu/ahcarchives/2006/10/16/more-product-less-process/|title=More product, less process|last=Moore|first=Erik|date=October 16, 2006|website=Academic Health Center History Project|publisher=[[University of Minnesota]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=April 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to Mark Greene's death in 2017,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; the authors continued to expand their original thesis, notably in a 2010 ''[[Journal of Archival Organization]]'' article that amplifies their resource allocation argument and directly rebuts a variety of critics.&lt;ref name="jao"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Meissner, Dennis and Mark A.

The '''''New Oxford American Dictionary''''' ('''''NOAD''''') is a single-volume [[dictionary]] of [[American English]] compiled by American editors at the [[Oxford University Press]].

''NOAD'' is based upon the ''[[New Oxford Dictionary of English]]'' (''NODE''), published in the United Kingdom in 1998, although with substantial editing, additional entries, and the inclusion of illustrations.  It is based on a [[corpus linguistics]] analysis of Oxford's 200 million word database of contemporary [[American English]].

''NOAD'' includes a [[Pronunciation respelling for English|diacritical respelling scheme]] to convey pronunciations, as opposed to the [[Pronunciation respelling for English#International Phonetic Alphabet|Gimson phonemic IPA]] system that is used in ''NODE''.

==Editions==

===First===
Published in September 2001, the first edition was edited by Elizabeth J. Jewell and Frank Abate.

===Second edition===
Published in May 2005, the second edition was edited by [[Erin McKean]].  The edition added nearly 3,000 new words, senses, and phrases.  It was in a large format, with 2096 pages, and was 8½" by 11" in size.  It included a CD-ROM with the full text of the dictionary for [[Palm OS]] devices.

Since 2005 [[Apple Inc.]]'s [[Mac OS X]] operating system has come bundled with a [[Dictionary (software)|dictionary]] application and [[Widget (computing)|widget]] which credits as its source "Oxford American Dictionaries", and contains the full text of ''NOAD2''. The [[Amazon Kindle]] reading device also uses ''NOAD'' as its built-in dictionary, along with a choice for the ''[[Oxford Dictionary of English]]''.

Oxford University Press published ''NOAD2'' in electronic form in 2006 at the OxfordAmericanDictionary.com,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordamericandictionary.com/ OxfordAmericanDictionary.com]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2010, along with the ''Oxford Dictionary of English'', as part of [[OxfordDictionaries.com|Oxford Dictionaries Online]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://oxforddictionaries.com/ OxfordDictionaries.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Third edition===
Published in August 2010, the third edition was edited by Angus Stevenson and Christine A. Lindberg. This edition includes over 2,000 new words, senses, and phrases, and over 1,000(1225) illustrations; hundreds of new and revised explanatory notes, new "Word Trends" feature charts usage for rapidly changing words and phrases.

==&lt;span id="Esquivalience"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Fictitious entry==
The dictionary includes an entry for the word "esquivalience", which it defines as meaning "the willful avoidance of one's official responsibilities".  This is a [[fictitious entry]], intended to protect the copyright of the publication.  The entry was invented by Christine Lindberg, one of the editors of the ''NOAD''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbierma.com/language/column/file/050921.htm |work=Chicago Tribune |title=Dictionary sets a trap with an invented word |author=Nathan Bierma |date=September 21, 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070718224823/http://www.nbierma.com/language/column/file/050921.htm |archivedate=July 18, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the publication of the second edition, a rumor circulated that the dictionary contained a fictitious entry in the letter 'e'. ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' contributing editor Henry Alford combed the section, and discussed several unusual entries he found with a group of American lexicographers. Most found "esquivalience" to be the most likely candidate, and when Alford approached ''NOAD'' editor in chief [[Erin McKean]] she confirmed it was a fake entry, which had been present since the first edition, in order to protect the copyright of the [[CD-ROM]] edition. Of the word, she said "its inherent fakeitude is fairly obvious".&lt;ref name="alford"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/08/29/050829ta_talk_alford | work = New Yorker | title = Not a Word | author = Henry Alford | date = August 29, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="curzan"&gt;{{cite book | title=Fixing English: Prescriptivism and Language History | author=Anne Curzan | isbn=9781107020757 | page=93 | date=8 May 2014 | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fake entry apparently ensnared [[Reference.com|dictionary.com]], which included an entry for it (that has since been removed) which it attributed to ''[[Webster's]] New Millennium Dictionary'', both of which are owned by the private company [[Reference.com|Lexico]].&lt;ref name="alford"/&gt;  Possibly due to its licensing of Oxford dictionaries, [[Google Dictionary]] included the word, listing three meanings and giving usage examples.

The credit instrument normally requires the [[debtor]] to pay [[interest]] and extends for time periods of 30 days or longer.

The appended notes say "the map of the western lands drawn by Columbus"&lt;ref&gt;To The End of the Earth, Jeremy Harwood, Struik Publishers, 2007, {{ISBN|978-1-77007-608-2}}, p.69&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The '''Piri Reis map''' is a [[world map]] compiled in 1513 from military intelligence by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] admiral and cartographer [[Piri Reis]] ({{IPA-tr|piɾi ɾeis|pron}}). Approximately one third of the map survives; it shows the western coasts of [[Europe]] and [[North Africa]] and the coast of [[Brazil]] with reasonable accuracy. Various Atlantic islands, including the [[Azores]] and [[Canary Islands]], are depicted, as is the mythical island of [[Antillia]] and possibly [[Japan]].

The map's historical importance lies in its demonstration of the extent of global exploration of the [[New World]] by approximately 1510, and in its claim to have used a map of [[Christopher Columbus]], otherwise lost, as a source. Piri also stated that he had used ten Arab sources and four Indian maps sourced from the Portuguese. More recently, the map has been the focus of claims for the pre-modern exploration of the [[Antarctica|Antarctic]] coast.

==Description==
The map is the extant western third of a world map drawn on [[gazelle]] skin parchment, with dimensions variously reported as 90&amp;nbsp;cm&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;63&amp;nbsp;cm,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nebenzahl|1990|p=63}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Soucek|first=Svat|authorlink=Svat Soucek|contribution=Piri Re'is|title=[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]|editor1-last=Bosworth|editor1-first=C.

The surviving portion primarily details the western coast of [[Africa]] and the eastern coast of [[South America]]. The map was signed by [[Piri Reis]], an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman-Turkish]] [[admiral]], [[Geography in medieval Islam|geographer]] and [[Cartography|cartographer]], and dated to the month of [[Muharram]] in the [[Islamic calendar|Islamic year]] 919 AH, equivalent to 1513 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stiebing|1984|pp=1–2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hapgood1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hapgood|1966|p=1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It was presented to Ottoman Sultan [[Selim I]] in 1517.&lt;ref name="Kahle621"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;From the preface of Piri's ''Kitab-ı Bahriye'' (1521), as translated in Kahle 1933: "This poor man [Piri Reis] had previously constructed a map which, in comparison with maps hitherto known, displayed many more [and] different details, [and] in which he had included even the newly published maps of the Indian and Chinese Oceans which at that time were totally unknown in the country of Rūm [the Ottoman Empire]; and he had presented it in Cairo to the Turkish Sultan Selim I, who graciously accepted it."&lt;/ref&gt; In the map's [[cartography#Map symbology|legend]], Piri inscribed that the map was based on about twenty charts and [[Mappa mundi|mappae mundi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hapgood|1966|p=2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kahle624"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kahle|1933|p=624}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Inscription 6 on the map reads: "In this age, no one has seen a map like this. The hand of this poor man [Piri Reis] has drawn it and completed it from about twenty charts and mappaemundi. These are charts drawn in the days of Iskender dhu-l Karnian &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Alexander the Great]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, which the inhabited quarter of the world. The Arabs name these charts Jaferya." Translation from {{Harvnb|McIntosh|2000|p=15}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Piri, these maps included eight [[Ptolemaic map]]s, an [[Arab]]ic map of [[India]], four newly drawn [[Portugal|Portuguese]] maps from [[Sindh]], and a map by [[Christopher Columbus]] of the [[West Indies|western lands]]. From Inscription 6 on the map:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
From eight Jaferyas of that kind and one Arabic map of Hind [India], and from four newly drawn Portuguese maps which show the countries of Sind [now in modern day [[Pakistan]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, Hind and Çin [China] geometrically drawn, and also from a map drawn by Qulūnbū [Columbus] in the western region, I have extracted it. By reducing all these maps to one scale this final form was arrived at, so that this map of these lands is regarded by seamen as accurate and as reliable as the accuracy and reliability of the [[Seven Seas]]&lt;ref&gt;In this case, the Seven Seas are the [[South China Sea|Chinese Sea]], the [[Indian Sea]], the [[Persian Gulf]], the [[Caspian Sea]], the Western Sea ([[Atlantic Ocean]]), the [[Red Sea]] and the East African Sea (sea surrounding the [[East Africa]]n island of [[Zanzibar]]), as identified by Piri in ''Kitab-ı Bahriye'' (1521). {{Harvnb|Kahle|1933|p=624}}.&lt;/ref&gt; on the aforesaid maps."&lt;ref&gt;Translation from {{Harvnb|McIntosh|2000|pp=15, 17}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There is some scholarly debate over whether the 20 charts and mappae mundi in Piri's inscriptions includes the eight Ptolemaic maps, the four Portuguese maps, the Arabic map and the Columbus map.&lt;ref name="McIntosh18"&gt;{{Harvnb|McIntosh|2000|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; From one perspective, the number of charts and mappae mundi used by Piri equals 20,&lt;ref name="Kahle624"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Afetinan|Yolaç|1954|pp=24, 31}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kahle|1956|p=106}}.&lt;/ref&gt; while in the other, it could mean a total of 34.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tekeli|1985|p=677}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Afetinan|1987|p=27}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yerci|1989|p=154}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Atil|first=Esin|title=The Age of Sultan Süleyman the Magnificent|year=1987|publisher=[[Harry N. Abrams, Inc.]]|location=New York|page=81}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some have claimed that the source maps were found in the ancient [[Library of Alexandria]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Flem-Ath|first1=Rand|last2=Wilson|first2=Colin|title=The Atlantis Blueprint|year=2000|publisher=[[Little, Brown and Company]]|page=18}}.&lt;/ref&gt; based on Piri's allusions to [[Alexander the Great]], the founder of [[Alexandria]], [[Ptolemy I]], who ruled Alexandria in the 4th century BC, and [[Claudius Ptolemy]], the Greek geographer and cartographer who lived in Alexandria during the 2nd century AD.&lt;ref name="McIntosh18"/&gt; Gregory McIntosh states "Arab writers often confused Claudius Ptolemy, the geographer of the second century C.E., with Ptolemy I, one of Alexander's generals... Piri Reis has undoubtedly made the same error, resulting in his believing the charts and maps were from the time of Ptolemy I instead of Claudius Ptolemy."&lt;ref name="McIntosh17"&gt;{{Harvnb|McIntosh|2000|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The map was discovered serendipitously on 9 October 1929, through the philological work of the German theologian [[Gustav Adolf Deissmann]] (1866–1937). He had been commissioned by the Turkish [[Ministry of National Education (Turkey)|Ministry of Education]] to catalogue the [[Topkapı Palace]] library's non-Islamic items.&lt;ref&gt;A. Gerber, ''Deissmann the Philologist'', Berlin, 2010, 198-201.&lt;/ref&gt; At Deissmann's request to search the palace for old maps and charts, the director Halil Edhem (1861–1938) managed to find some disregarded bundles of material, which he handed over to Deissmann.  Realizing that the map might be a unique find, Deissmann showed it to the orientalist [[Paul Kahle]], who identified it as a map drawn by Piri Reis.&lt;ref&gt;G. A. Deissmann, ''Forschungen und Funde im Serai'', Berlin, 1933, 111-122.&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery caused an international sensation, as it represented the only then known copy of a world map of Christopher Columbus (1451–1506),&lt;ref&gt;P. Lunde, ‘Piri Reis and the Columbus Map’, Aramco World, 43, 3, 1992, 48-59&lt;/ref&gt; and was the only 16th-century map that showed South America in its proper [[Longitude|longitudinal]] position in relation to Africa. Geographers had spent several centuries unsuccessfully searching for a "lost map of Columbus" that was supposedly drawn while he was in the [[West Indies]].&lt;ref name="Hapgood1"/&gt;

After reading about the map's discovery in ''[[The Illustrated London News]]'', [[United States]] [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Henry L. Stimson]] contacted the [[United States Ambassador to Turkey]] [[Charles H. Sherrill (ambassador)|Charles H. Sherrill]] and requested that an investigation be launched to find the Columbus source map, which he believed may have been in Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hapgood|1966|p=211}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In turn, the Turkish government complied with Stimson's request, but they were unsuccessful in locating any of the source maps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hapgood|1966|pp=1–2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Piri Reis map is currently located in the Library of the Topkapı Palace in [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]], but is not usually on display to the public.

The map was depicted on the [[Obverse and reverse|reverse]] of the Turkish 10 million [[Turkish lira|lira]] banknote of 1999-2005&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcmb.gov.tr/yeni/eng/ Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey]  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5hFIaQq0J?url=http://www.tcmb.gov.tr/yeni/eng/ |date=2009-06-03 }}.

==Analysis==
The map is a [[portolan chart]], as shown by the four [[compass rose]]s (two large and two small) from which lines of bearing radiate.&lt;ref name="dutch"/&gt; Some analyses assert that the map is an [[azimuthal equidistant projection]] centered on Cairo, but a 1998 analysis by Steven Dutch of the [[University of Wisconsin Green Bay]] shows a better fit with a point near the intersection of the present-day [[prime meridian]] and the [[equator]].&lt;ref name="dutch"/&gt; There are extensive notes in [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] around the edges of the map, as well as some interior detail which is mostly inaccurate and fanciful.&lt;ref name="dutch"/&gt;

The Iberian peninsula and the coast of Africa are rendered accurately; as for the Americas, the northern portion of the South American coast is also fairly accurate and positioned correctly with respect to Africa.&lt;ref name="dutch"/&gt; Much of the Caribbean is also mapped fairly accurately and appears to reflect Columbus's maps of the area. The area representing North America bears almost no resemblance to its real coastline except for one projection which might be Newfoundland; an island labelled "Antilia" may actually be Nova Scotia, since it has a note attached which refers to the legendary voyages of [[Brendan|Saint Brendan]].&lt;ref name="dutch"/&gt; There is some suggestion that this area may represent the Asian coast. Island groups in the east Atlantic are accurately placed, but are depicted out of scale.&lt;ref name="dutch"/&gt;

Although there are frequent claims for the extreme accuracy of this chart, McIntosh, in comparing the Piri Reis map to several other [[portolan]]-style maps of the era, found that

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Piri Reis map is not the most accurate map of the sixteenth century, as has been claimed, there being many, many world maps produced in the remaining eighty-seven years of that century that far surpass it in accuracy. The [[Diogo Ribeiro|Ribeiro]] maps of the 1520s and 1530s, the [[Abraham Ortelius|Ortelius]] map of 1570, and the [[Edward Wright (mathematician)|Wright]]-[[Emery Molyneux|Molyneux]] map of 1599 (‘the best map of the sixteenth century’) are only a few better-known examples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McIntosh|2000|p=59}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===The Antarctic coast===
There are two major discrepancies from known coastlines: the North American coast mentioned above, and the southern portion of the South American coast. On the Piri Reis map, the latter is shown bending off sharply to the east starting around present-day [[Rio de Janeiro]]. A more popular interpretation of this territory has been to identify this section with the [[Queen Maud Land]] coast of Antarctica. This claim is generally traced to Arlington H. Mallery, a civil engineer and amateur archaeologist who was a supporter of [[pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact]] hypotheses. Though his assertions were not well received by scholars, they were revived in [[Charles Hapgood]]'s 1966 book ''Maps of the Ancient Sea Kings''.&lt;ref name="dutch"/&gt; This book proposed a theory of global exploration by a pre-classical undiscovered civilization based on his analysis of this and other ancient and late-medieval maps. More notoriously, these claims were repeated in [[Erich von Däniken]]'s ''[[Chariots of the Gods]]'' (which attributed the knowledge of the coast to [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrials]]) and [[Gavin Menzies]]'s ''[[1421: The Year China Discovered the World]]'' (which attributed it to supposed Chinese voyages), both of which were roundly denounced by both scholars and debunkers of fringe works.&lt;ref name="dutch"/&gt;

A more sober analysis of these claims was published by Gregory McIntosh, a historian of cartography, who examined the map in depth in his book ''The Piri Reis Map of 1513'' (Athens and London: University of Georgia Press, 2000). He was able to find sources for much of the map in Columbus's writings. Certain peculiarities (such as the appearance of the Virgin Islands in two locations) he attributed to the use of multiple maps as sources; others (such as the errors in North American geography) he traced to the continued confusion of the area with East Asia. As far as the accuracy of depiction of the supposed Antarctic coast is concerned, there are two conspicuous errors. First, it is shown hundreds of kilometres north of its proper location; second, the [[Drake Passage]] is completely missing, with the [[Antarctic Peninsula]] presumably conflated with the Western Patagonian coast. The identification of this area of the map with the frigid Antarctic coast is also difficult to reconcile with the notes on the map which describe the region as having a warm climate.&lt;ref name="dutch"/&gt;

Maps of the period generally depicted a large continent named ''[[Terra Australis Incognita]]'' of highly variable shape and extent. This land was posited by [[Ptolemy]] as a counterbalance to the extensive continental areas in the northern hemisphere; due to a lack of exploration and various misunderstandings, its existence was not fully abandoned until circumnavigation of the area during the [[second voyage of James Cook]] in the 1770s showed that if it existed, it was much smaller than imagined previously. The first confirmed landing on Antarctica was not until 1820, and the coastline of Queen Maud Land did not see significant exploration before Norwegian expeditions began in 1891.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=U.S. Antarctic Program External Panel of the [[National Science Foundation]]|title=Antarctica—Past and Present|url=https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/1997/antpanel/antpan05.pdf|accessdate=6 February 2006|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quest.arc.nasa.gov/antarctica/background/NSF/palmer.html|title=Nathaniel Brown Palmer, 1799-1877|publisher=NASA, U.S. Government|author=Guy G.

It is unclear whether the mapmaker saw South America itself as part of the unknown southern lands (as shown in the [[Miller Atlas]]),&lt;ref&gt;http://xoomer.virgilio.it/dicuoghi/Piri_Reis/PiriReis_eng.htm Diego Cuoghi, Thorough article on Piri Reis and Oronteus maps refuting the Antarctica claims.&lt;/ref&gt; or whether (as Dutch thought) he drew what was then known of the coast with substantial distortion, but in any case, serious scholarship holds that there is no reason to believe that the map is the product of genuine knowledge of the Antarctic coast.&lt;ref name="dutch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uwgb.edu/dutchs/pseudosc/piriries.htm|title=The Piri Reis Map|first=Steven|last=Dutch|accessdate=2013-08-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130813090645/http://www.uwgb.edu/dutchs/PSEUDOSC/PiriRies.HTM|archivedate=2013-08-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7517">The term '''secret police''' (or '''political police''')&lt;ref name="BermanWaller"&gt;Ilan Berman &amp; J. Michael Waller, "Introduction: The Centrality of the Secret Police" in ''Dismantling Tyranny: Transitioning Beyond Totalitarian Regimes'' (Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2006), p. xv.&lt;/ref&gt; refers to [[Intelligence agency|intelligence]], [[Security agency|security]] or [[police]] agencies that engage in covert operations against a government's political opponents. Secret police organizations are characteristic of [[totalitarian]] regimes.&lt;ref&gt;Juan José Linz, ''Totalitarian and Authoritarian Regimes'' (Lynne Rienner, 2000), p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; Used to protect the [[political power]] of an individual dictator or an [[authoritarian]] regime, secret police often, but not always, operate outside the [[law]] and are used to repress dissidents and weaken the [[political opposition]], frequently with violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/secret-police|title=Secret police|work=Cambridge Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Secret police originated in 18th-century Europe after the [[French Revolution]], when such operations were established in an effort to detect any possible conspiracies or revolutionary subversion. The peak of secret-police operations in most of Europe was 1815 to 1860, "when restrictions on voting, assembly, association, unions and the press were so severe in most European countries that opposition groups were forced into conspiratorial activities."&lt;ref name="Goldstein"&gt;Robert Justin Goldstein, ''Political Repression in 19th Century Europe'' (1983; Routledge 2013 ed.)&lt;/ref&gt; The secret police of the [[Austrian Empire]] were particularly notorious during this period.&lt;ref name="Goldstein"/&gt; After 1860, the use of secret police declined due to increasing liberalization, except in autocratic regimes such as the [[Russian Empire]].&lt;ref name="Goldstein"/&gt;

In the [[Russian Empire]], the secret police forces were the [[Third Section]] of the Imperial Chancery and then the [[Okhrana]]. After the [[Russian Revolution]], the [[Soviet Union]] established the [[OGPU]], [[NKVD]], [[NKGB]], [[MVD]], and [[KGB]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephen J. Lee, ''Russia and the USSR, 1855-1991: Autocracy and Dictatorship'' (Routledge, 2006), ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Nazi Germany]], the ''Geheimstaatspolizei'' (Secret State Police, [[Gestapo]]) (1933-1945) was used to eliminate opposition; as part of the [[Reich Main Security Office]], it also was a vital organizer of [[the Holocaust]]. Although the Gestapo had a relatively small number membership (32,000 in 1944), "it maximized these small resources through informants and a large number of denunciations from the local population."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10008218 Gestapo], ''Holocaust Encyclopedia'', [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]].&lt;/ref&gt; After the defeat of the Nazis, the [[East German]] secret police, the [[Stasi]], likewise made extensive use of an extensive network of civilian informers.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Bruce, ''The Firm: The Inside Story of the Stasi'' (Oxford University Press, 2010), pp. 81-83.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functions and methods==
[[Ilan Berman]] and J. Michael Waller describe the secret police as central to totalitarian regimes and "an indispensable device for the consolidation of power, neutralization of the opposition, and construction of a [[single-party state]]."&lt;ref name="BermanWaller"/&gt; In addition to these activities, secret police may also be responsible for tasks not related to suppressing internal dissent, such as gathering foreign intelligence, engaging in counterintelligence, organizing border security, and guarding government buildings and officials.&lt;ref name="BermanWaller"/&gt; Secret police forces sometimes endure even after the fall of a totalitarian regime.&lt;ref name="BermanWaller"/&gt;

[[Arbitrary detention]], abduction and [[forced disappearance]], [[torture]], and [[assassination]] are all tools wielded by secret police "to prevent, investigate, or punish (real or imagined) opposition."&lt;ref&gt;Elna Dragomir, "Police State" in ''The SAGE Encyclopedia of Surveillance, Security, and Privacy'' (ed. Bruce A. Arrigo" SAFE, 2018), pp. 753-56.&lt;/ref&gt; Because secret police typically act with great discretionary powers "to decide what is a crime" and are a tool used to target political opponents, they operate outside the [[rule of law]].&lt;ref&gt;Gerald F. Gaus, ''Justificatory Liberalism: An Essay on Epistemology and Political Theory'' (Oxford University Press, 1996), p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt;

People apprehended by the secret police are often [[arbitrary arrest and detention|arbitrarily arrested and detained]] without due process. While in detention, arrestees may be [[torture]]d or subjected to inhumane treatment. Suspects may not receive a [[public trial]], and instead may be convicted in a [[kangaroo court]]-style [[show trial]], or by a secret tribunal. Secret police known to have used these approaches in history include the secret police of [[East Germany]] (the Ministry for State Security or [[Stasi]]) and [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[PIDE]].&lt;ref&gt;R. J. Stove, ''The Unsleeping Eye: Secret Police and Their Victims''. Encounter Books, San Francisco, 2003. {{ISBN|1-893554-66-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Control==
[[Image:GDR Stasi Dep M 4.jpg|thumb|right|An automated [[Stasi]] machine used to re-glue envelopes after mail had been opened for examination.]]
A single secret service may pose a potential threat to the central political authority. Political scientist Sheena Chestnut Greitens writes that: "When it comes to their security forces, [[autocracy|autocrats]] face a fundamental 'coercing dilemma between empowerment and control. ... Autocrats must empower their security forces with enough coercing capacity to enforce internal order and conduct external defense. Equal important to their survival, however, they must control that capacity, to ensure it is not turned against them."&lt;ref name="Greitens"&gt;Sheena Chestnut Greitens, ''Dictators and their Secret Police: Coercive Institutions and State Violence'' (Cambridge University Press, 2016), pp. 23-25.&lt;/ref&gt; Authoritarian regimes therefore attempt to engage in "coup-proofing" (designing institutions to minimize risks of a coup). Two methods of doing so are increasing fragmentation (i.e., dividing powers among the regime security apparatus to prevent "any single agency from amassing enough political power to carry out a coup") and increasing exclusivity (i.e., purging the regime security apparatus to favor familial, social, or ethnic groups perceived as more loyal).&lt;ref name="Greitens"/&gt;

This view includes the case of "spontaneous standardization processes", to produce [[de facto standard]]s.

==History==
===Early examples===
Standard weights and measures were developed by the [[Indus Valley Civilisation]].&lt;ref name=Iwata2254&gt;Iwata, Shigeo (2008), "Weights and Measures in the Indus Valley", ''Encyclopaedia of the History of Science, Technology, and Medicine in Non-Western Cultures (2nd edition)'' edited by [[Helaine Selin]], pp.&amp;nbsp;2254&amp;ndash;2255, Springer, {{ISBN|978-1-4020-4559-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The centralised weight and measure system served the commercial interest of Indus merchants as smaller weight measures were used to measure luxury goods while larger weights were employed for buying bulkier items, such as food grains etc.&lt;ref name=Kenoyer265/&gt; Weights existed in multiples of a standard weight and in categories.&lt;ref name=Kenoyer265&gt;Kenoyer, Jonathan Mark (2006), "Indus Valley Civilization", ''[[Encyclopedia of India]] (vol. 2)'' edited by Stanley Wolpert, pp.&amp;nbsp;258&amp;ndash;266, Thomson Gale, {{ISBN|0-684-31351-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Technical standard]]isation enabled gauging devices to be effectively used in [[angular measurement]] and measurement for construction.&lt;ref name=Baber_b&gt;Baber, Zaheer (1996), The Science of Empire: Scientific Knowledge, Civilization, and Colonial Rule in India, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|0-7914-2919-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Uniform units of length were used in the planning of towns such as [[Lothal]], [[Surkotada]], [[Kalibangan]], [[Dholavira|Dolavira]], [[Harappa]], and [[Mohenjo-daro]].&lt;ref name=Iwata2254/&gt; The weights and measures of the Indus civilisation also reached [[Persia]] and [[Central Asia]], where they were further modified.&lt;ref name=Iwata2254_quote&gt;In the third millennium BCE the Indus measuring system was further developed in the ancient regions of Iran and Afghanistan -- Iwata, 2254.&lt;/ref&gt; Shigeo Iwata describes the excavated weights unearthed from the Indus civilisation:

{{Quotation|1=A total of 558 weights were excavated from Mohenjodaro, Harappa, and [[Chanhudaro|Chanhu-daro]], not including defective weights. They did not find statistically significant differences between weights that were excavated from five different layers, each measuring about 1.5&amp;nbsp;m in depth. This was evidence that strong control existed for at least a 500-year period. The 13.7-g weight seems to be one of the units used in the Indus valley. The notation was based on the [[Binary numeral system|binary]] and [[decimal]] systems. 83% of the weights which were excavated from the above three cities were cubic, and 68% were made of [[chert]].&lt;ref name=Iwata2254/&gt;}}[[Image:HinduMeasurements.svg|thumb|200px|Hindu units of time—largely of mythological and ritual importance—displayed on a [[logarithmic scale]].]]

===18th century attempts===
[[File:Maudslay screw-cutting lathes of circa 1797 and 1800.png|thumb|[[Henry Maudslay]]'s famous early screw-cutting lathes of circa 1797 and 1800.]]

The implementation of standards in industry and commerce became highly important with the onset of the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the need for high-precision [[machine tool]]s and [[interchangeable parts]].

[[Henry Maudslay]] developed the first industrially practical [[screw-cutting lathe]] in 1800. This allowed for the standardisation of [[screw thread]] sizes for the first time and paved the way for the practical application of [[Interchangeable parts|interchangeability]] (an idea that was already taking hold) to [[Nut (hardware)|nuts]] and [[Screw|bolts]].&lt;ref name="Ping"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.eastwestcenter.org/fileadmin/stored/pdfs/econwp117.pdf|title=A Brief History of Standards and Standardization Organizations: A Chinese Perspective|author=Wang Ping|publisher=EAST-WEST CENTER WORKING PAPERS|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before this, screw threads were usually made by chipping and filing (that is, with skilled freehand use of [[chisel]]s and [[file (tool)|files]]). [[Nut (hardware)|Nuts]] were rare; metal screws, when made at all, were usually for use in wood. Metal bolts passing through wood framing to a metal fastening on the other side were usually fastened in non-threaded ways (such as clinching or upsetting against a washer). Maudslay standardized the screw threads used in his workshop and produced sets of [[Tap and die|taps and dies]] that would make nuts and bolts consistently to those standards, so that any bolt of the appropriate size would fit any nut of the same size. This was a major advance in workshop technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rolt|first=L. T. C.|title=Great Engineers|year=1962|publisher=Bell and Sons}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===National standard===
Maudslay's work, as well as the contributions of other engineers, accomplished a modest amount of industry standardization; some companies' in-house standards spread a bit within their industries.

[[File:JFIScrewThread300.png|thumb|left|Graphic representation of formulae for the pitches of threads of screw bolts]]
[[Joseph Whitworth]]'s screw thread measurements were adopted as the first (unofficial) national standard by companies around the country in 1841. It came to be known as the [[British Standard Whitworth]], and was widely adopted in other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gilbert|first1=K. R.|last2=Galloway|first2=D. F.|year=1978|chapter=Machine Tools|editor-first1=C.|editor-last1=Singer|title=A history of technology|place=Oxford|publisher=Clarendon Press|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Lee|editor-first=S.|year=1900|title=Dictionary of National Biography''|volume=LXI|publisher=Smith Elder|place=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This new standard specified a 55° thread angle and a thread depth of 0.640327''p'' and a radius of 0.137329''p'', where ''p'' is the pitch. The thread pitch increased with diameter in steps specified on a chart. An example of the use of the Whitworth thread is the [[Royal Navy]]'s [[Crimean War]] gunboats. These were the first instance of "mass-production"  techniques being applied to marine engineering.&lt;ref name="Ping" /&gt;

With the adoption of BSW by British [[railway]] lines, many of which had previously used their own standard both for threads and for bolt head and nut profiles, and improving manufacturing techniques, it came to dominate British manufacturing.

[[Unified Thread Standard|American Unified Coarse]] was originally based on almost the same imperial fractions. The Unified thread angle is 60° and has flattened crests (Whitworth crests are rounded). Thread pitch is the same in both systems except that the thread pitch for the {{frac|1|2}}&amp;nbsp;in bolt is 12 threads per inch (tpi) in BSW versus 13 tpi in the UNC.

===National standards body===
By the end of the 19th century, differences in standards between companies, was making trade increasingly difficult and strained. For instance, an iron and steel dealer recorded his displeasure in ''[[The Times]]'': "Architects and engineers generally specify such unnecessarily diverse types of sectional material or given work that anything like economical and continuous manufacture becomes impossible. In this country no two professional men are agreed upon the size and weight of a girder to employ for given work."

The [[BSI Group|Engineering Standards Committee]] was established in London in 1901 as the world's first national standards body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bsigroup.com/upload/Corporate%20Marketing/Financial%20Performance/BSI_Group_Annual_Report_and_Financial_Statements_2010.pdf |title=BSI Group Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010|page=2|format=PDF|accessdate=3 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Robert C McWilliam 2001"&gt;{{cite book|first=Robert C.|last=McWilliam.|title=BSI: The first hundred years|year=2001|publisher=Thanet|place=London|isbn=978-0727730206|url=http://www.icevirtuallibrary.com/content/book/102072}}&lt;/ref&gt; It subsequently extended its standardization work and became the British Engineering Standards Association in 1918, adopting the name British Standards Institution in 1931 after receiving its Royal Charter in 1929. The national standards were adopted universally throughout the country, and enabled the markets to act more rationally and efficiently, with an increased level of cooperation.

After the [[First World War]], similar national bodies were established in other countries. The [[Deutsches Institut für Normung]] was set up in Germany in 1917, followed by its counterparts, the American [[American National Standards Institute|National Standard Institute]] and the French  [[AFNOR|Commission Permanente de Standardisation]], both in 1918.&lt;ref name="Ping" /&gt;

===International standards===
By the mid to late 19th century, efforts were being made to standardize electrical measurement. [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Lord Kelvin]] was an important figure in this process, introducing accurate methods and apparatus for measuring electricity. In 1857, he introduced a series of effective instruments, including the quadrant electrometer, which cover the entire field of electrostatic measurement. He invented the [[current balance]], also known as the ''Kelvin balance'' or ''Ampere balance'' (''SiC''), for the [[accuracy and precision|precise]] specification of the [[ampere]], the [[standardisation|standard]] [[Units of measurement|unit]] of [[electric current]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=David|last=Lindley|title=Degrees Kelvin: A Tale of Genius, Invention, and Tragedy|page=293|isbn=978-0309096188|publisher=National Academic Press|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:crompton.jpg|thumb|left|[[R. E. B. Crompton]] drew up the first international standards body, the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]], in 1906.]]
Another important figure was [[R. E. B. Crompton]], who became concerned by the large range of different standards and systems used by electrical engineering companies and scientists in the early 20th century. Many companies had entered the market in the 1890s and all chose their own settings for [[volt]]age, [[frequency]], [[Electric current|current]] and even the symbols used on circuit diagrams. Adjacent buildings would have totally incompatible electrical systems simply because they had been fitted out by different companies. Crompton could see the lack of efficiency in this system and began to consider proposals for an international standard for electric engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iec.ch/about/history/articles/colonel_crompton.htm |title=Colonel Crompton |publisher=[[International Electrotechnical Commission]] |work=www.iec.ch |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100903145102/http://www.iec.ch/about/history/articles/colonel_crompton.htm |archivedate=September 3, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1904, Crompton represented Britain at the [[International Electrical Congress]], held in connection with [[Louisiana Purchase Exposition]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri|Saint Louis]] as part of a delegation by the [[Institute of Electrical Engineers]]. He presented a paper on standardisation, which was so well received that he was asked to look into the formation of a commission to oversee the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johnson|first1=J.|last2=Randell|first2=W.|year=1948|title=Colonel Crompton and the Evolution of the Electrical Industry|publisher=Longman Green}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1906 his work was complete and he drew up a permanent constitution for the first international standards organization, the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Electrochemical Power Sources|first1=Chris K.|last1=Dyer|first2=Patrick T.|last2=Moseley|first3=Zempachi|last3=Ogumi|first4= David A. J.|last4=Rand|first5=Bruno|last5=Scrosati|publisher=
Newnes|year=2010|page=540|isbn=9780444527455}}&lt;/ref&gt; The body held its first meeting that year in London, with representatives from 14 countries. In honour of his contribution to electrical standardisation, Lord Kelvin was elected as the body's first President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iec.ch/about/history/documents/pdf/IEC_Founding_Meeting_Report_1906.pdf | title=Report of Preliminary Meeting | year=1906 |place=London |pages=46–47 (25–26 in PDF) | work=The minutes from our first meeting | publisher=[[International Electrotechnical Commission]] | accessdate=23 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Memory plaque of founding ISA in Prague cropped.jpg|thumb|Memorial plaque of founding ISA in [[Prague]].]]
The [[ISO|International Federation of the National Standardizing Associations]] (ISA) was founded in 1926 with a broader remit to enhance international cooperation for all technical standards and specifications. The body was suspended in 1942 during [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]].

After the war, ISA was approached by the recently formed United Nations Standards Coordinating Committee (UNSCC) with a proposal to form a new global standards body. In October 1946, ISA and UNSCC delegates from 25 countries met in [[London]] and agreed to join forces to create the new [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO); the new organization officially began operations in February&amp;nbsp;1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/2012_friendship_among_equals.pdf|title=Friendship among equals - Recollections from ISO's first fifty years|publisher=[[International Organization for Standardization]]|year=1997|isbn=92-67-10260-5|pages=15–18|accessdate=26 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, each country or economy has a single recognized National Standards Body (NSB). Examples include [[ABNT]], [[Asociación Española de Normalización y Certificación|AENOR]], [[Association française de Normalisation|AFNOR]], [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]], [[BSI Group|BSI]], [[Dirección General de Normas|DGN]], [[DIN]], [[Instituto Argentino de Normalización y Certificación|IRAM]], [[Japanese Industrial Standards Committee|JISC]], [[Korean Agency for Technology and Standards|KATS]], [[South African Bureau of Standards|SABS]], [[Standardization Administration of China|SAC]], [[Standards Council of Canada|SCC]], [[Swedish Standards Institute|SIS]]. An NSB is likely the sole member from that economy in ISO.

NSBs may be either public or private sector organizations, or combinations of the two. For example, the three NSBs of Canada, Mexico and the United States are respectively the Standards Council of Canada ([[Standards Council of Canada|SCC]]), the General Bureau of Standards ({{lang|es|Dirección General de Normas}}, DGN), and the [[American National Standards Institute]] (ANSI). SCC is a Canadian [[Crown Corporation]], DGN is a governmental agency within the Mexican Ministry of Economy, and ANSI and AENOR are a [[501(c)(3)]] non-profit organization with members from both the private and public sectors. The determinants of whether an NSB for a particular economy is a public or private sector body may include the historical and traditional roles that the private sector fills in public affairs in that economy or the development stage of that economy.

==Usage==
Standards can be:
* [[de facto standard]]s which means they are followed by informal convention or dominant usage.
* [[de jure]] standards which are part of legally binding contracts, laws or regulations.
* Voluntary standards which are published and available for people to consider for use.

The existence of a published standard does not necessarily imply that it is useful or correct. Just because an item is stamped with a standard number does not, by itself, indicate that the item is fit for any particular use. The people who use the item or service (engineers, trade unions, etc.) or specify it (building codes, government, industry, etc.) have the responsibility to consider the available standards, specify the correct one, enforce compliance, and use the item correctly: [[validation and verification]].

Standardization is implemented greatly when companies release new products to market. Compatibility is important for products to be successful; this allows consumers to use their new items along with what they already own.

===Social science===
In the context of social criticism and [[social science]], standardization often means the process of establishing standards of various kinds and improving efficiency to handle people, their interactions, cases, and so forth. Examples include formalization of judicial procedure in court, and establishing uniform criteria for diagnosing mental disease. Standardization in this sense is often discussed along with (or synonymously to) such large-scale social changes as modernization, bureaucratization, homogenization, and centralization of society.

===Information exchange===
In the context of information exchange, standardization refers to the process of developing standards for specific business processes using specific [[formal language]]s. These standards are usually developed in voluntary consensus standards bodies such as the United Nations Center for Trade Facilitation and Electronic Business ([[UN/CEFACT]]), the World Wide Web Consortium [[W3C]], the [[Telecommunications Industry Association]] (TIA), and the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards ([[OASIS (organization)|OASIS]]).

There are many [[specification]]s that govern the operation and interaction of devices and software on the [[Internet]], but they are rarely referred to as standards, so as to preserve that word as the domain of relatively disinterested bodies such as ISO. The [[W3C]], for example, publishes "Recommendations", and the [[IETF]] publishes "[[Request for Comments|Requests for Comments]]" (RFCs). However, these publications are sometimes referred to as standards.

In the context of [[customer service]], standardization refers to the process of developing an international standard that enables organizations to focus on customer service, while at the same time providing recognition of success{{clarify|date=August 2016}} through a third party organization, such as the [[British Standards Institution]]. An international standard has been developed by [[The International Customer Service Institute]].

===Supply and materials management===
In the context of [[supply chain management]] and [[materials management]], standardization covers the process of specification and use of any item the company must buy in or make, allowable substitutions, and [[build or buy]] decisions.

===Defense===
In the context of defense, standardization has been defined by [[NATO]] as ''The development and implementation of concepts, doctrines, procedures and designs to achieve and maintain the required levels of [[:wikt:compatibility|compatibility]], [[interchangeable parts|interchangeability]] or [[commonality]] in the operational, procedural, material, technical and administrative fields to attain interoperability.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebolingroup.com/procurementpower/presentations/Moreno_JuanA.pdf|page=11|title=Interoperabilty and Standardization within NATO|date=8 April 2009|last=Moreno|first=Juan A.|accessdate=23 January 2014|work=NATO Standards Agency|publisher=thebolingroup.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}
The process of standardization can itself be standardized. There are at least four levels of standardization: compatibility, [[interchangeable parts|interchangeability]], [[commonality]] and [[reference]]. These standardization processes create compatibility, similarity, measurement and symbol standards.

There are typically four different techniques for standardization
* Simplification or variety control
* Codification
* [[Value engineering]]
* [[Statistical process control]].

Types of standardization process:
* Emergence as [[de facto standard]]: [[tradition]], market domination, etc.
* Written by a [[Standards organization]]:
** in a closed consensus process: Restricted membership and often having formal procedures for due-process among voting members
** in a full consensus process: usually open to all interested and qualified parties and with formal procedures for due-process considerations&lt;ref&gt;ISO (2016). How does ISO develop standards? Retrieved June 22, 2016 from http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards_development.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
* Written by a government or regulatory body
* Written by a corporation, union, trade association, etc.

==Effects==
Standardization/ Standardisation has a variety of benefits and drawbacks for firms and consumers participating in the market, and on technology and innovation.

===Effect on firms===
The primary effect of standardization on firms is that the basis of competition is shifted from integrated systems to individual components within the system. Prior to standardization a company's product must span the entire system because individual components from different competitors are incompatible, but after standardization each company can focus on providing an individual component of the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shapiro|first=Carl|title=Information Rules: A Strategic Guide to the Network Economy|date=1999|publisher=Harvard Business School Press|location=Boston, Mass|pages=232–233|author2=Hal R. Varian }}&lt;/ref&gt; When the shift toward competition based on individual components takes place, firms selling tightly integrated systems must quickly shift to a modular approach, supplying other companies with subsystems or components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Christensen|first=Clayton M.|title=The Innovator's Solution: Creating and Sustaining Successful Growth|date=2003|publisher=Harvard Business School Press|location=Boston, Mass|page=140|author2=Michael E. Raynor }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effect on consumers===
Standardization has a variety of benefits for consumers, but one of the greatest benefits is enhanced network effects. Standards increase compatibility and interoperability between products, allowing information to be shared within a larger network and attracting more consumers to use the new technology, further enhancing network effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shapiro|first=Carl|title=Information Rules: A Strategic Guide to the Network Economy|date=1999|publisher=Harvard Business School Press|location=Boston, Mass|page=229|author2=Hal R. Varian }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other benefits of standardization to consumers are reduced uncertainty, because consumers can be more certain that they are not choosing the wrong product, and reduced lock-in, because the standard makes it more likely that there will be competing products in the space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shapiro|first=Carl|title=Information Rules: A Strategic Guide to the Network Economy|date=1999|publisher=Harvard Business School Press|location=Boston, Mass|page=230|author2=Hal R. Varian }}&lt;/ref&gt; Consumers may also get the benefit of being able to mix and match components of a system to align with their specific preferences.&lt;ref name="Shapiro 1999 233"&gt;{{cite book|last=Shapiro|first=Carl|title=Information Rules: A Strategic Guide to the Network Economy|date=1999|publisher=Harvard Business School Press|location=Boston, Mass|page=233|author2=Hal R. Varian }}&lt;/ref&gt; Once these initial benefits of standardization are realized, further benefits that accrue to consumers as a result of using the standard are driven mostly by the quality of the technologies underlying that standard.&lt;ref&gt;J. Gregory Sidak, ''The Value of a Standard Versus the Value of Standardization'', 68 BAYLOR L. REV. at 3 (Forthcoming 2016), https://www.criterioneconomics.com/the-value-of-a-standard-versus-the-value-of-standardization.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

Probably the greatest downside of standardization for consumers is lack of variety. There is no guarantee that the chosen standard will meet all consumers' needs or even that the standard is the best available option.&lt;ref name="Shapiro 1999 233"/&gt; Another downside is that if a standard is agreed upon before products are available in the market, then consumers are deprived of the penetration pricing that often results when rivals are competing to rapidly increase market share in an attempt to increase the likelihood that their product will become the standard.&lt;ref name="Shapiro 1999 233"/&gt; It is also possible that a consumer will choose a product based upon a standard that fails to become dominant.&lt;ref&gt;Cowan, Robin. "High Technology and the Economics of Standardization." Paper presented at the International Conference on Social and Institutional Factors Shaping Technological Development: Technology at the Outset, Berlin, Germany, May 27–28, 1991. p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, the consumer will have spent resources on a product that is ultimately less useful to him or her as the result of the standardization process.

===Effect on technology===
Much like the effect on consumers, the effect of standardization on technology and innovation is mixed.&lt;ref&gt;Blind, K. (2013). The impact of standardisation and standards on innovation (NESTA Working Paper 13/15). Retrieved from NESTA website: https://www.nesta.org.uk/sites/default/files/the_impact_of_standardization_and_standards_on_innovation.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the various links between research and standardization have been identified,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Blind |first=K. |last2=Gauch |first2=S. | year=2009 |title=Research and standardisation in nanotechnology: evidence from Germany|journal=The Journal of Technology Transfer|issue=3|volume=34|pages=320–342|url=http://doi.org/10.1007/s10961-008-9089-8 |doi=10.1007/s10961-008-9089-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; also as a platform of knowledge transfer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Blind |first=K. |last2=Mangelsdorf|first2=A.|year=2016|title=Motives to standardize: Empirical evidence from Germany|journal=Technovation|volume=48–49|pages=13–24|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016649721600002X |doi=10.1016/j.technovation.2016.01.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and translated into policy measures (e.g. [http://www.bmwi.de/DE/service,did=746982.html WIPANO]).

Increased adoption of a new technology as a result of standardization is important because rival and incompatible approaches competing in the marketplace can slow or even kill the growth of the technology (a state known as [[market fragmentation]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shapiro|first=Carl|title=Information Rules: A Strategic Guide to the Network Economy|date=1999|publisher=Harvard Business School Press|location=Boston, Mass|page=264|author2=Hal R. Varian }}&lt;/ref&gt; The shift to a modularized architecture as a result of standardization brings increased flexibility, rapid introduction of new products, and the ability to more closely meet individual customer's needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Christensen|first=Clayton M.|title=The Innovator's Solution: Creating and Sustaining Successful Growth|date=2003|publisher=Harvard Business School Press|location=Boston, Mass|pages=131–132|author2=Michael E. Raynor }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The negative effects of standardization on technology have to do with its tendency to restrict new technology and innovation. Standards shift competition from features to price because the features are defined by the standard. The degree to which this is true depends on the specificity of the standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shapiro|first=Carl|title=Information Rules: A Strategic Guide to the Network Economy|date=1999|publisher=Harvard Business School Press|location=Boston, Mass|page=231|author2=Hal R. Varian }}&lt;/ref&gt; Standardization in an area also rules out alternative technologies as options while encouraging others.&lt;ref&gt;Cowan, Robin. "High Technology and the Economics of Standardization." Paper presented at the International Conference on Social and Institutional Factors Shaping Technological Development: Technology at the Outset, Berlin, Germany, May 27–28, 1991. p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1227">A '''subordination agreement''' is a [[legal document]] used to make the [[Cause of action|claim]] of one party junior to (or inferior to) a claim in favor of another.  It is generally used to grant first lien status to a [[lienholder]] who would otherwise be secondary to another party, with the approval of the party that would otherwise have first lien.  Typically a subordination arises when there are two existing mortgages, a first mortgage and a second mortgage, and the mortgagor intends to refinance the first mortgage.  If the holder of the second mortgage does not subordinate the lien of its mortgage to the new mortgage, the new lender will not refinance the first mortgage.  However, the second mortgage holder does not want to release its mortgage and re-file, due to additional costs and priority problems, so it will subordinate its lien to the lien of the replacement mortgage.

{{italic title}}
'''''The Deptford Trilogy''''' (published 1970 to 1975) is a series of inter-related [[novel]]s by [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[novelist]] [[Robertson Davies]].

==Overview==

The trilogy consists of ''[[Fifth Business]]'' ([[1970 in literature|1970]]), ''[[The Manticore]]'' ([[1972 in literature|1972]]), and ''[[World of Wonders (novel)|World of Wonders]]'' ([[1975 in literature|1975]]). The series revolves around a precipitating event: a young boy throws a snowball at another, hitting a pregnant woman instead, who goes into premature labor. It explores the longterm effects of these events on numerous characters. 

The Deptford trilogy has won praise for its narrative voice and its characterizations. The main characters originate from the same small village. Each carries a secret that crosses the lives of the others and drives the plot forward. ''Fifth Business'' is considered one of Davies' best novels. The second novel, ''The Manticore'', won the [[Governor General's Award|Governor-General's Literary Award]] in the [[Governor General's Award for English language fiction|English language fiction category]] in 1972.

The trilogy was named for its setting in the fictional village of Deptford, [[Ontario]]. This is based in part on Davies' native [[Thamesville, Ontario|Thamesville]]. Davies takes the view of different characters in each novel, and expresses each in a different style. The tone and unconventional literary devices of metafiction have led some later critics to suggest the series was a precursor to what has been called "[[Slipstream (genre)|slipstream]]" fiction in the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;Broderick, Damien (2000). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=SdwbFx9Dz8EC&amp;pg=PA33&amp;lpg=PA33 Transrealist Fiction: Writing in the Slipstream of Science]'', p.&amp;nbsp;33.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Fifth Business''==
{{main|Fifth Business}}
''Fifth Business'' is narrated by Dunstable (later Dunstan) Ramsay, who grows up in Deptford, a fictional town in southwestern Ontario, Canada. After World War I, he becomes a teacher and serves for decades at a college. The epistolary novel takes the form of a letter Ramsay writes to the headmaster of Colborne College after his retirement. He feels ill used by an article about him in the school paper. He recalls how, as a boy, he ducked a snowball intended for him. It hit a pregnant woman instead, and she gave birth prematurely. This incident and related events deeply affected Ramsay's life. He tells how he came to terms with his guilt. He also tells of his boyhood friend and enemy, Percy Boyd "Boy" Staunton, who becomes a wealthy businessman and politician.

==''The Manticore''==
{{main|The Manticore}}
''The Manticore'' is the story of Boy Staunton's only son, David, who undergoes [[Jungian psychology|Jungian]] [[psychoanalysis]] in [[Switzerland]]. During his therapy, he tries to understand his father and his relationship to him. The novel is a detailed record of his therapy and his coming to understand his own life. It sheds new light on many of the characters introduced in ''Fifth Business,'' including his father's friend Dunstan Ramsay. He happens to be in Switzerland recuperating from a heart attack.

''The Manticore'' won the [[Governor General's Award|Governor-General's Literary Award]] in the [[Governor General's Award for English language fiction|English language fiction category]] in 1972.

==''World of Wonders''==
{{main|World of Wonders (novel)|l1=World of Wonders}}
''[[World of Wonders (novel)|World of Wonders]]'' tells of Paul Dempster, a boy born prematurely who is befriended by Dunstan Ramsay. He learns to conjure and, as an adult, takes the name of Magnus Eisengrim as he establishes a successful career as a noted [[Magic (illusion)|magician]]. Eisengrim is to portray [[Jean Eugène Robert-Houdin]] in a [[television]] [[film|movie]]. During lulls in the filming, he recounts his life, including obstacles he has overcome. He elaborates on his career as an [[actor]] traveling through [[Canada]] in the early 20th century. Dunstan Ramsay also appears in this novel. More insight is provided into the characters of ''Fifth Business''.

==Key characters==
===Dunstan Ramsay===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Dunstan]] --&gt;
Dunstan Ramsay is the narrator of both ''Fifth Business'' and ''World of Wonders'' (he is not the protagonist in the last novel). He also appears as a major character in ''The Manticore'' and as a supporting character in several other novels by Davies. Ramsay is a gentle schoolmaster with surprising depths and is probably a stand-in for Davies himself. (Since Davies has said that the main business of a writer is to be an enchanter, a weaver of spells, a magician,&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in LaBossiere, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=52tONoFpwooC&amp;pg=PA126 Robertson Davies: A Mingling of Contrarieties]'', p.&amp;nbsp;126.&lt;/ref&gt; Dempster/Eisengrim may stand for Davies.) Ramsay counsels his students to write in "the plain style," as Davies does—to highlight the story rather than the writer.

Ramsay appears in Davies' novels ''[[What's Bred in the Bone]]'' and ''[[The Lyre of Orpheus (novel)|The Lyre of Orpheus]],'' two of his [[The Cornish Trilogy|Cornish trilogy]], and in the later novel ''[[The Cunning Man]]''. Ramsay is not religious but he is fascinated by the lives of the saints. He writes several well-regarded treatises on saints. In the novels he is compared with [[Saint Dunstan]] in his struggle with Satan.

===Magnus Eisengrim===
'''Magnus Eisengrim''' is one of the names taken on by Paul Dempster.  Like several of the main characters in Davies' novel, Paul undergoes a symbolic rebirth which is accompanied by a name change.  It is eventually revealed that this name is derived from that of Isengrin, a wolf in the stories of [[Reynard the Fox]].

On December 28, 1908, Paul was born prematurely after his mother was hit in the head by a snowball thrown by Percy Boyd Staunton. She went insane after the mishap. Paul is raised by his strict and religious father but runs away from home.  He is taken by the World of Wonders troupe, where he is abused but learns the skills of a conjuror. This moment in his life is also significant for his first change in alias, that of Faustus (a name later translated into Faustina, both female assistants to Eisengrim).

After several years, Paul becomes the understudy of a famous, aged English actor. Working as his stunt double, Paul slowly adopts his personality and appearance and almost assumes his persona.

Paul (now known as Magnus Eisengrim) tells this story to his co-workers while they are working on a movie about [[Robert-Houdin]].

'''''Tiny Toon Adventures''''' is an American animated comedy television series that was broadcast from September 14, 1990 through December 6, 1992 as the first collaborative effort of [[Warner Bros. Animation]] and [[Steven Spielberg]]'s [[Amblin Entertainment]] after being conceived in the late 1980s by [[Tom Ruegger]].&lt;ref name=factory&gt;{{cite news|last=Trusdell|first=Brian|title=Focus : Warner's Toon Factory for the 1990s|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-05-28/news/tv-6798_1_tiny-toons/|accessdate=10 May 2011|newspaper=[[The Los Angeles Times]]|date=May 28, 1995|location=USA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The show follows the adventures of a group of young cartoon characters who attend Acme Looniversity to become the next generation of characters from the ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' series.

==Background==

===Premise===
''Tiny Toon Adventures'' is a cartoon set in the fictional town of '''Acme Acres''', where most of the ''Tiny Toons'' and ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' characters live. The characters attend '''Acme Looniversity''', a school whose faculty primarily consists of the mainstays of the classic [[Warner Bros.]] cartoons, such as [[Bugs Bunny]], [[Daffy Duck]], [[Porky Pig]], [[Sylvester the Cat]], [[Wile E. Coyote]] and [[Elmer Fudd]]. In the series, the university is founded to teach cartoon characters how to become funny. The school is not featured in every episode, as not all of its storylines revolve around the school.

Like the [[Looney Tunes]], the series makes use of [[cartoon physics|cartoon violence]] (e.g. anvils falling on someone, liberal use of explosives) and [[slapstick]]. The series parodies and references the current events of the early 1990s and [[Hollywood]] culture. Occasionally, episodes delve into veiled ethical and morality stories of [[ecology]], [[self-esteem]], and [[crime]].

===Characters===
{{Main article|List of Tiny Toon Adventures characters}}
[[Image:Promo tiny toon .jpg|left|thumb|210px|Artwork displaying a majority of the [[List of characters in Tiny Toon Adventures|''Tiny Toon'' cast]].]]
&lt;!--please don't re-add the list to this section; see talk page--&gt;
The series centers on a group of young cartoon characters who attend a school called [[Acme Corporation|Acme]] [[Acme Looniversity|Looniversity]] to be the next generation of ''Looney Tunes'' characters. Most of the Tiny Toons characters were designed to resemble younger versions of Warner Bros.' most popular Looney Tunes animal characters by exhibiting similar traits and looks. The two main characters are both rabbits: [[Buster Bunny]], a blue male rabbit, and [[Babs Bunny]], a pink female rabbit not related to Buster, Plucky Duck, a green male duck, Hamton J. Pig, a pink male pig. Other major characters in the cast are generally nonhuman as well. These include [[Fifi La Fume]], a purple-and-white female skunk; [[Shirley The Loon]], a white female [[loon]]; [[Dizzy Devil]], a purple tasmanian devil; [[Furrball]], a blue cat; [[Sweetie Pie (Tiny Toon Adventures)|Sweetie Pie]], a pink canary; [[Calamity Coyote]], a bluish-gray coyote; [[Little Beeper]], a red-orange roadrunner; and [[Gogo Dodo]], a zany green dodo. Two human characters, [[Montana Max]] and [[Elmyra Duff]], are regarded as the main villains of the series and also are students of Acme Looniversity. As villains, Elmyra is seen as an extreme pet lover while Montana Max is a spoiled rich brat who either owns lots of toys or polluting factories. Supporting characters included [[Li'l Sneezer]], a gray mouse with powerful sneezes; [[Concord Condor]], a purple condor; [[Byron Basset]], a usually sleeping basset hound; [[Bookworm (Tiny Toon Adventures)|Bookworm]], a green worm with glasses; [[Arnold the Pit Bull]], a muscular white pit bull; [[Fowlmouth]], a white rooster with horrid language; [[Barky Marky]], a brown dog, and [[Mary Melody]], a young African American human girl.

Feeding off the characters are the more traditional Looney Tunes such as Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, and Porky Pig among others. Most of the adults teach classes at Acme Looniversity and serve as mentors to the Tiny Toons while others fill secondary positions as needed.

==Production==

===Writers===
The series and the show's characters were developed by series producer, head writer and cartoonist [[Tom Ruegger]], division leader [[Jean MacCurdy]], associate producer and artist Alfred Gimeno and story editor/writer [[Wayne Kaatz]]. Among the first writers on the series were [[Jim Reardon]], [[Tom Minton]], and Eddie Fitzgerald. The character and scenery designers included Alfred Gimeno, Ken Boyer, [[Dan Haskett]], Karen Haskett, and many other artists and directors. The series was actually planned to be a feature film. Once Steven Spielberg was attached, numerous things changed, including the idea of turning the movie into a television series.

"Buster and Babs Go To Hawaii" was co-written by three then-teenage girls who were fans of the show.&lt;ref name=writers&gt;{{cite news|last=Berkman|first=Meredith|title=Adventures among the 'Toons'|url=http://ew.com/ew/article/0,,313220,00.html|accessdate=28 May 2011|newspaper=[[Entertainment Weekly]] issue #51|date=February 1, 1991|location=USA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Casting info===
Voice director [[Andrea Romano]] auditioned over 1,200 voices for the series and chose more than a dozen main voice actors.&lt;ref name="collab"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tiny Toon Adventures - Long-Awaited 'Volume 3' DVD Brings Toons from 2nd, 3rd Season|url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Tiny-Toon-Adventures-Volume-3/17543|publisher=TV Shows on DVD|last=Lambert|first=David|date=September 9, 2012|accessdate=September 28, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120929234612/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Tiny-Toon-Adventures-Volume-3/17543|archivedate=September 29, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The role of Buster Bunny was given to [[Charlie Adler]], who gave the role, as producer [[Tom Ruegger]] said, "a great deal of energy".&lt;ref name="creation"/&gt; The role of Babs Bunny was given to [[Tress MacNeille]]. Writer [[Paul Dini]] said that MacNeille was good for the role because she could do both Babs' voice and the voices of her impressions.&lt;ref name="creation"/&gt; Voice actors [[Joe Alaskey]] and [[Don Messick]] were given the roles of Plucky Duck and Hamton J. Pig, respectively. [[Danny Cooksey]] played Montana Max and, according to [[Paul Dini]], was good for the role because he could do a "tremendous mean voice." Cooksey was also the only voice actor in the cast who was not an adult.&lt;ref name="creation"/&gt; [[Cree Summer]] played the roles of Elmyra Duff and Mary Melody; former ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' cast member [[Gail Matthius]] played Shirley the Loon, and [[Kath Soucie]] had the roles of Fifi La Fume and Li'l Sneezer. Other actors for the series included [[Maurice LaMarche]] as the voice of Dizzy Devil; [[Candi Milo]] as the voice of Sweetie, [[Frank Welker]] as the voice of Gogo Dodo, Furrball, Byron Basset, Calamity Coyote, Little Beeper, Barky Marky, and other voices; and [[Rob Paulsen]] as the voice of Fowlmouth, Arnold the Pit Bull, Concord Condor, and other characters. The legendary voice behind the Looney Tunes, [[Mel Blanc]], was set to reprise his roles as the classic characters, but died in July 1989. His characters were recast by the likes of [[Jeff Bergman]], [[Joe Alaskey]], [[Greg Burson]], and Mel's son, [[Noel Blanc]].

During production of the series' third season, Charlie Adler left the show due to a conflict with the producers. Adler was upset that he had not landed a role in ''[[Animaniacs]]'' while voice actors with smaller roles in ''Tiny Toon Adventures'' like [[Rob Paulsen]], [[Maurice LaMarche]], and [[Frank Welker]] were given starring roles in the new series.&lt;ref name="kennedy"/&gt; [[John Kassir]] replaced Adler for the remainder of the show's run (although Adler would eventually return to voice Buster in the cancelled video game, ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures: Defenders of the Universe]]''). Joe Alaskey, the voice of Plucky Duck, also left ''Tiny Toons'' for financial reasons, but returned when an agreement was reached with the studio.&lt;ref name="kennedy"/&gt;

===Animation===
In order to complete 65 episodes for the first season, [[Warner Bros. Animation]] and [[Amblin Entertainment]] contracted several different [[North American]] and international animation houses. These animation studios included Tokyo Movie Shinsha (now known as [[TMS Entertainment]]), [[Wang Film Productions]], [[AKOM]], [[Freelance Animators New Zealand]], Encore Cartoons, [[StarToons]],&lt;ref name=startoons&gt;{{cite news|last=Owens|first=John|title=Drawing On Experience|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1992-07-05/features/9203010023_1_animation-studios-hanna-barbera-studios-hollywood-cartoon|accessdate=1 October 2011|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=July 5, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kennedy Cartoons]].&lt;ref&gt;Credits from various ''Tiny Toon Adventures'' episodes.{{Clarify|date=January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tokyo Movie Shinsha also animated the series' opening sequence. Some of the Warner Bros. staff disliked working with Kennedy Cartoons due to the animation studio's inconsistent quality, and episodes that they animated were often subject to multiple re-takes. In other cases, such as the debut episode "The Looney Beginning", portions of Kennedy Cartoons-animated episodes were re-animated by another animation studio.&lt;ref name="kennedy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://platypuscomix.net/people/ruegger2.html|title=Platypus Comix interviews......Tom Ruegger! (part II)|last=Paltridge|first=Peter|date=July 2006|work=Platypus Comix|accessdate=2006-08-23}}{{Unreliable source?|date=January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kennedy Cartoons was actually dropped after the end of the series' first season.

''Tiny Toon Adventures'' was made with a higher production value than standard television animation. It had a [[cel]] count that was more than double that of most animated television shows then.&lt;ref name="creation"/&gt; The series had about 25,000 cels per episode instead of the standard 10,000, making it unique in that characters moved more fluidly.&lt;ref name="creation"/&gt; [[Pierre DeCelles]], an animation producer, described storyboarding for the series as "fun but a big challenge because I always had a short schedule, and it's not always easy to work full blast nonstop".

===Music===
During the development of the show [[Steven Spielberg]] said that [[Warner Bros.]] would use a full orchestra, which some thought too expensive and impossible, but they ended up agreeing. [[Warner Bros.]] selected [[Bruce Broughton]] to write the theme tune (for which he would win a [[Daytime Emmy]] along with [[Tom Ruegger]] and [[Wayne Kaatz]], who both worked with Broughton on the lyrics) and serve as [[music supervisor]]. Screen credits for the composers were given based on the amount of music composed for, or composed and reused in, the episode.

Twenty-six other composers were contracted to create original dramatic underscore for each different episode during the series run: Julie and [[Steven Bernstein (musician)|Steve Bernstein]], [[Steven Bramson]], [[Don Davis (composer)|Don Davis]], [[John Debney]], Ron Grant, [[Les Hooper]], Carl Johnson, Elliot Kaplan, Arthur Kempel, Ralph Kessler, Albert Lloyd Olson, [[Hummie Mann]], [[Dennis McCarthy (composer)|Dennis McCarthy]], [[Joel McNeely]], Peter Myers, [[Laurence Rosenthal]], [[William Ross (composer)|William Ross]], [[Arthur B. Rubinstein]], J. Eric Schmidt, David Slonaker, [[Fred Steiner]], [[Morton Stevens]], [[Richard Stone (composer)|Richard Stone]], [[Stephen James Taylor]] and [[Mark Watters]]. The composers conducted their own music. Of these composers, Broughton, Bramson, Davis, Olson, Stone, Taylor and Watters wrote the score to ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures: How I Spent My Vacation]]''.

==Spin-offs==
{{Main article|The Plucky Duck Show|Pinky, Elmyra &amp; the Brain}}
In 1992, ''[[The Plucky Duck Show]]'' was produced as a spin-off for [[Fox Kids]], based on the character Plucky Duck. Except for the premiere episode ''The Return of Batduck'', the show was composed of recycled Plucky-centric episodes from the series.&lt;ref name="spinoff1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Trivia for "The Plucky Duck Show"|publisher=The Internet Movie Database|url=http://imdb.com/title/tt0103513/trivia|accessdate=2007-06-02}}{{Unreliable source?|date=January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, a spin-off entitled ''[[Pinky, Elmyra &amp; the Brain]]'' debuted on [[Kids' WB]]. This series featured the Elmyra character as well as ''[[Pinky and the Brain]]'', two characters who were originally on ''[[Animaniacs]]'' before receiving their own series, also entitled ''[[Pinky and the Brain]]''. ''[[Pinky, Elmyra &amp; the Brain]]'' picks up after ''Pinky'' leaves off where ''[[Pinky and the Brain]]'' become Elmyra's pets after Brain accidentally destroys their original home, ACME Labs, during an experiment. ''[[Pinky, Elmyra &amp; the Brain]]'' lasted for thirteen episodes.

==History==

===Preproduction===
According to writer [[Paul Dini]], ''Tiny Toons'' originated as an idea by [[Terry Semel]], the then-president of [[Warner Bros.]], who wanted to "inject new life into the [[Warner Bros. Animation]] department," and at the same time create a series with junior versions of [[List of Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies characters|Looney Tunes characters]]. Semel proposed that the new series would be a show based on ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' where the characters were either young versions of the original ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' and ''[[Merrie Melodies]]'' characters or new characters as the offsprings of the original characters.&lt;ref name="creation"&gt;{{cite news|last=Miller|first=Bob|title=NEW TOONS ON THE BLOCK: They're attending Acme Looniversity &amp; hoping to graduate as classic cartoon characters|periodical=Comic Scene|issue=15|pages=33–39, 68|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of a series with the basis of younger and junior versions of cartoon characters was common at the time; the era in which ''Tiny Toons'' was produced for had such cartoons as ''[[Muppet Babies]]'', ''[[A Pup Named Scooby-Doo]]'', ''[[Tom &amp; Jerry Kids]]'' and ''[[The Flintstones Kids]]''. [[Warner Bros.]] chose to do the same because Spielberg wanted to make a series similar to ''[[Looney Tunes]]'', as series producer/show-runner Tom Ruegger explained: "Well, I think in [[Warner Bros.]] case, they had the opportunity to work with Steven Spielberg] on a project [...] But he didn't want to just work on characters that [[Chuck Jones]], [[Friz Freleng]], [[Robert McKimson|Bob McKimson]] and [[Bob Clampett]] made famous and created. He wanted to be involved with the creation of some ''new'' characters." The result was a series similar to ''Looney Tunes'' without the use of the same characters.&lt;ref name="creation"/&gt;

On January 20, 1987,&lt;ref name="collab2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,318258,00.html|title=SUFFERIN' SUCCOTASH! IT'S LOONEY TUNES, TAKE TWO|date=September 28, 1990|work=Entertainment Weekly}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Warner Bros. Animation studio approached [[Steven Spielberg]] to collaborate with Semel and [[Warner Bros.]] head of licensing Dan Romanelli on Semel's ideas.&lt;ref name="creation"/&gt; They eventually decided that the new characters would be similar to the ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' characters with no direct relation. However, ''Tiny Toons'' did not go into production then, nor was it even planned to be made for television; the series initially was to be a [[theatrical]] [[feature-length film]].&lt;ref name="collab"/&gt;&lt;ref name="creation"/&gt;

On December 27, 1988, ''Tiny Toons'' was changed from a film to a television series, with [[Jean MacCurdy]] overseeing production of the first 65 episodes.&lt;ref name="creation"/&gt; MacCurdy said that ''Tiny Toons'' was changed to a television series to "reach a broader audience".&lt;ref name="collab"/&gt; For the series, MacCurdy hired [[Tom Ruegger]], who previously wrote cartoons for [[Filmation]] and [[Hanna-Barbera]], to be a producer.&lt;ref name="creation"/&gt; In January 1989, Ruegger and writer [[Wayne Kaatz]] began developing the characters and the setting of "Acme Acres" with Spielberg.&lt;ref name="creation"/&gt;

On January 9, 1989, [[Warner Bros. Animation]] was choosing its voice actors from over 1,200 auditions and putting together its 100-person production staff.&lt;ref name="collab"/&gt; On April 13, 1989, full production of series episodes began with five overseas animation houses and a total budget of $25 million.&lt;ref name="collab"/&gt; The first 65 episodes of the series aired in syndication on 135 stations, beginning in September 1990.&lt;ref name="airdate"&gt;Lenburg, p. 336. Retrieved 2007-11-15.&lt;/ref&gt; During that time, ''Tiny Toons'' was a huge success and got higher ratings than its ''[[The Disney Afternoon|Disney Afternoon]]'' competitors in some affiliates. After a successful run in syndication, Fox attained the rights for season 3. Production of the series halted in late 1992 to make way for ''[[Animaniacs]]'' to air the following year.

===Post-series syndication===
''Tiny Toon Adventures'', along with ''[[Animaniacs]]'', continued to rerun in syndication through the 1990s into the mid-2000s (decade) after production of new episodes ceased.

In the United States, the series re-ran on [[Nickelodeon]] from 1995–1999 and again from 2002–2004, and also aired on [[Kids' WB]] from 1997–2000, [[Cartoon Network]] from 1999–2001 and finally on [[Nicktoons (TV channel)|Nicktoons]] from 2002–2005. On October 27, 2012, the series aired on broadcast television once again on [[Vortexx]] with the special "Tiny Toons' Night Ghoulery" and again on November 24, 2012. The series began airing re-runs on the [[Hub Network]] on July 1, 2013. ''Tiny Toon Adventures'' was one of the few shows carried over when the Hub Network was re-branded as the [[Discovery Family]] on October 13, 2014. Discovery Family stopped airing reruns of ''Tiny Toon Adventures'' in early 2015. ''Tiny Toon Adventures'' returned to Discovery Family on June 6, 2015, but was removed again shortly after.

On January 4, 2018, [[Hulu]] acquired the streaming rights to ''Tiny Toon Adventures'' along with ''[[Pinky And The Brain]]'', ''[[Animaniacs]]'', &amp; ''[[Pinky, Elmyra and the Brain]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Petski|first1=Denise|title=‘Animaniacs’ Reboot Gets Two-Season Straight-To-Series Order At Hulu|url=http://deadline.com/2018/01/animaniacs-steven-spielberg-reboot-straight-to-series-order-hulu-1202235778/|website=Deadline|accessdate=4 January 2018|date=4 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a match in Australia in 1969, Rose was injured and left partially blind in one eye.&lt;ref name=syd/&gt; In the early 1970s, Rose held the [[National Wrestling Alliance]]'s [[NWA Women's World Tag Team Championship]] twice with The Fabulous Moolah.&lt;ref name=god143&gt;Ellison, Lillian.
