Public protesting and demonstrations began one week ahead of the [[2010 G20 Toronto summit]], which took place in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada on 26−27 June. The protests were for various causes, including poverty and anti-capitalism.

Protests mainly consisted of peaceful [[demonstration (people)|demonstration]]s and [[Political rally|rallies]] but also took form of a [[riot]] as a group of protesters using [[black bloc]] tactics caused [[vandalism]] to several businesses in [[Downtown Toronto]]. More than 20,000 police, military, and security personnel were involved in policing the protests, which at its largest numbered 10,000 protesters.&lt;ref&gt;CTV News.

Over 1000 arrests were made, making it the largest [[mass arrest]] in Canadian history.&lt;ref name=globemailjuly2011&gt;{{cite news|title=Toronto police were overwhelmed at G20, review reveals|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/toronto/toronto-police-were-overwhelmed-at-g20-review-reveals/article2073215/|accessdate=24 June 2011|newspaper=The Globe and Mail|date=23 June 2011|first=Adrian|last=Morrow| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110624112511/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/toronto/toronto-police-were-overwhelmed-at-g20-review-reveals/article2073215/| archivedate= 24 June 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the aftermath of the protests, the [[Toronto Police Service]] and the [[Integrated Security Unit]] (ISU) of the G20 Toronto summit were heavily criticized for brutality during the arrests and eventually went under public scrutiny by media and human rights activists. There has been legal action in the form of a  class action lawsuit towards the Toronto police on behalf of all whom were arrested despite the Toronto Police's several attempts to stop court proceedings by appealing the case. As of November 10, 2016 The Supreme Court of Canada ruled that it will not hear the Toronto Police Services Board's appeal and court proceedings may go on.

==Preliminary events==

===Early opposition===
A [[Royal Bank of Canada]] branch in [[Ottawa]] was [[Firebombing|firebombed]] just before dawn on May 18, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/ottawa/story/2010/05/18/ott-glebe-bank-fire.html |title=CBC News – Ottawa – RBC firebombed as protest, group claims |publisher=CBC.ca |date=2010-05-18 |accessdate=2010-06-04| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100522013917/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/ottawa/story/2010/05/18/ott-glebe-bank-fire.html| archivedate= 22 May 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The attackers posted video on [[YouTube]] showing a large fireball igniting inside the bank.  The video then listed the [[manifesto]] of a previously unknown group calling itself the FFFC.  The message stated that the attack against the bank was because of the growing suffering of Vancouver's poor in the shadow of RBC's major sponsorship of the [[2010 Vancouver Olympics]] and [[2010 Winter Paralympics|Paralympics]] in [[Vancouver]] and [[Whistler, British Columbia]] and claimed these events were held "on stolen [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] land."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiImoI0JdPQ YouTube Video] of bank firebombing of Royal Bank Branch, Ottawa, Ontario&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to social issues and [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|aboriginal]] land claims, the video claimed the actions were sparked by environmental and [[deforestation]] related concerns surrounding the [[Athabasca oil sands|Alberta tar sands]] projects in ''"Canada's"'' prairies, in which the video claims RBC is substantially involved and which G8/G20 decisions furthered.&lt;ref name="CTVCharged"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20100519/anarchists-firebomb-bank-100519/20100519?hub= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100524131549/http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20100519/anarchists-firebomb-bank-100519/20100519?hub= |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2010-05-24 |title=Terrorism charges possible in bank firebombing: police – CTV News |publisher=Ctv.ca |date=2010-05-19 |accessdate=2010-06-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The attackers also stated their intention to be present during the [[36th G8 summit|G8]] and the G20 Toronto summits the following month.&lt;ref name="TSun1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Jackson |first=Kenneth |url=http://www.torontosun.com/news/canada/2010/05/19/14005326.html |title=Anarchy among anarchists after firebomb &amp;#124; Canada &amp;#124; News |publisher=Toronto Sun |date=2010-05-19 |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The projected recurrence of such acts of violence and the escalating [[rhetoric]] of anti-summit protest plans caused the G8/G20 [[Integrated Security Unit]] (ISU) to increase its security measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/article/812976--ottawa-firebombing-proves-security-need-clement-says |title=Ottawa firebombing proves security need, Clement says |publisher=thestar.com |date=2010-05-21 |accessdate=2010-06-04 | location=Toronto | first=Gail | last=Swainson}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2010/05/22/wanted-500-extra-police-for-g20-summit/ |title=Wanted: 500 extra police for G20 summit &amp;#124; Posted Toronto &amp;#124; National Post |publisher=News.nationalpost.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The attacks were quickly and widely criticized by the media, politicians, and other protest groups&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=QMI Agency |url=http://www.torontosun.com/comment/editorial/2010/05/19/14012571.html |title=Brainless thugs all about mayhem &amp;#124; Editorial &amp;#124; Comment |publisher=Toronto Sun |date= |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socialistproject.ca/bullet/358.php |title=Socialist Project &amp;#124; The Bullet |publisher=Socialistproject.ca |date= |accessdate=2010-06-04| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100527064005/http://www.socialistproject.ca/bullet/358.php| archivedate= 27 May 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Three suspects were arrested on June 19, 2010; with one, Roger Clement, being convicted in December 2010 while charges against the other two were stayed for lack of evidence.  Clement, a 58-year-old retired federal government employee, formerly working for the Canadian International Development Agency, eventually received a 3½ year prison sentence, that included 6 months for vandalism of another RBC branch in February 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.citytv.com/toronto/citynews/news/national/article/103466--man-who-firebombed-bank-gets-three-year-sentence |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120723071425/http://www.citytv.com/toronto/citynews/news/national/article/103466--man-who-firebombed-bank-gets-three-year-sentence |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-23 |title=Man Who Firebombed Bank Gets Three-Year Sentence |publisher=CityTV |date=2010-12-07 |accessdate=2011-07-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initial estimates of the damage, immediately following the attack, set the price-tag at around $300,000 and projected that the bank would be closed for several weeks.  At the time of Clement's trial, reports stated that the branch was closed for months with total costs of $1,600,000.&lt;ref name="CTVCharged" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TSun1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/TopStories/20101207/bank-fire-bomber-sentence-101207/ |title=Man who firebombed bank sentenced to 3 years |publisher=CTV News |date=2010-12-07 |accessdate=2011-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An individual was arrested for vandalism on May 28, after being caught spray-painting anti–G20 slogans on windows and [[automated teller machine]]s in Downtown Toronto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=QMI Agency |url=http://www.torontosun.com/news/canada/2010/05/28/14168296.html |title=Anti-G20 slogans spray-painted on T.O. banks &amp;#124; Canada &amp;#124; News |publisher=Toronto Sun |date=2010-05-28 |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two individuals were arrested in [[London, Ontario]] after attaching posters to public property encouraging disruption of the G20 summit and canvassing protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/Canada/2010/06/17/14420391.html |title=G20 activists jailed for poster – Canada – Canoe.ca |publisher=Cnews.canoe.ca |date=2008-07-22 |accessdate=2010-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Key groups which organized early in opposition to the summit included [[Canadian Labour Congress]], [[Council of Canadians]], [[Greenpeace]], [[Ontario Coalition Against Poverty]], [[Ontario Federation of Labour]], [[Oxfam]] and the Toronto Community Mobilization Network.&lt;ref&gt;Sheila Whyte.

===Week prior to summit===
[[File:G-20 Toronto June 2010 (2).jpg|left|thumb|An early demonstration on [[Yonge Street]] on June 24 demanding respect of First Nations treaty rights]]
A small rally was conducted on June 17 in the [[Financial District, Toronto|Financial District]] by [[Oxfam Canada]], urging Canada to end [[fossil fuel]] subsidization and take action on world [[poverty]]. The rally also spoofed the summit's high security cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ca.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCATRE65E4RB20100617?pageNumber=1&amp;virtualBrandChannel=0 |title=Toronto G20 protest hints at more to come &amp;#124; Top News &amp;#124; Reuters |publisher=Ca.reuters.com |date=2009-02-09 |accessdate=2010-06-20| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100622091653/http://ca.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCATRE65E4RB20100617?pageNumber=1&amp;virtualBrandChannel=0| archivedate= 22 June 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An anti-poverty protest occurred on June 21, causing traffic congestion.&lt;ref name=toronto1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://toronto.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20100621/lcbo_shut_down_100621/20100621/?hub=TorontoNewHome |title=CTV Toronto – Police ride herd as G20 protesters march the streets – CTV News |publisher=Toronto.ctv.ca |date=2010-04-29 |accessdate=2010-06-22| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100624024104/http://toronto.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20100621/lcbo_shut_down_100621/20100621/?hub=TorontoNewHome| archivedate= 24 June 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 100 protesters marched from [[Allan Gardens]] on [[Sherbourne Street, Toronto|Sherbourne Street]] and continued on [[Yonge Street]], [[Dundas Street (Ontario)|Dundas Street]], and Isabella Street.

The following day, about 200 people from Toronto's [[gay community]] marched through downtown attempting to raise awareness on [[LGBT rights in Canada|homosexual rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/article/827058--gays-lesbians-hold-g20-kiss-in?bn=1 |title=G20 turning downtown Toronto into a ghost town |publisher=thestar.com |date= 2010-06-22|accessdate=2010-06-24 | first1=Jennifer | last1=Yang | first2=Liam | last2=Casey| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100626093646/http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/article/827058--gays-lesbians-hold-g20-kiss-in?bn=1| archivedate= 26 June 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protesters chanted, "We're queer, we're fabulous, we're against the G20."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN2216509620100622 |title=Gay rights protest hits Toronto ahead of G20 |publisher=Reuters |date= 2010-06-22|accessdate=2010-06-24 | first=Pav | last=Jordan| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100626103252/https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN2216509620100622| archivedate= 26 June 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] (CBC) labelled the protests as "peaceful" overall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/toronto/story/2010/06/22/g20-tuesdayprotestors.html |title=CBC News – Toronto – Protests continue in Toronto as G20 nears |publisher=Cbc.ca |date= 2010-06-22|accessdate=2010-06-24| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100625060457/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/toronto/story/2010/06/22/g20-tuesdayprotestors.html| archivedate= 25 June 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first sizable G20 protest, of about 1000 people, took place on June 24 with [[First Nations]] groups and supporters from across Canada demanding respect for [[treaty rights]] from the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/article/827924--first-nations-demonstrators-take-over-downtown-streets?bn=1 |title=First nations demonstrators take over downtown streets |publisher=thestar.com |date= 2010-06-24|accessdate=2010-06-24 | location=Toronto | first=Peter | last=Edwards| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100627143516/http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/article/827924--first-nations-demonstrators-take-over-downtown-streets?bn=1| archivedate= 27 June 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Demonstrations moved from [[Queen's Park (Toronto)|Queen's Park]] to the [[Toronto Eaton Centre]] along [[University Avenue (Toronto)|University Avenue]] and [[Queen Street West]]. Concerns of protesters were Canada's failure to sign the [[United Nations]]' [[Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]] and the fact that no aboriginal chiefs were invited to the summits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/article/827924--canada-flunks-on-indigenous-rights-protesters-say?bn=1 |title=Canada flunks on indigenous rights, protesters say |publisher=thestar.com |date= 2010-06-24|accessdate=2010-06-24 | location=Toronto | first=Peter | last=Edwards}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also on June 24, activist [[Jaggi Singh (activist)|Jaggi Singh]], spokesperson for the group No One Is Illegal, suggested in a news conference that some protesters intended to attempt to breach the security fence in the coming days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/toronto/story/2010/06/24/g20-aboriginal.html--first-nations-demonstrators-take-over-downtown-streets?bn=1 |title=First Nations' G20 protest peaceful |publisher=thestar.com |date=2010-06-24 |accessdate=2010-07-10 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the G20 leaders arrived in Toronto after the G8 summit in [[Huntsville, Ontario]] wrapped up, a large group comprising as many as 10,000 people protested downtown during the afternoon of June 26.&lt;ref name="CBCprotests"&gt;{{cite news|title=G20 protest turns violent|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2010/06/26/g20-saturday-protests.html|accessdate=26 June 2010|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=June 26, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100628031322/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2010/06/26/g20-saturday-protests.html| archivedate= 28 June 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the protest, Jeff Atkinson, spokesperson for the [[Canadian Labour Congress]], said, "We don't want G20 countries to cut stimulus spending until jobs recover." [[Greenpeace International]] director [[Kumi Naidoo]] reasoned that "if G20 governments could spend billions of dollars to rescue banks in trouble, why not find money to help unemployed workers for the environment and for social causes." Sid Ryan of the [[Ontario Federation of Labour]] said in a speech, "It wasn't the workers of the world that caused the financial crisis. We don't want to see a transfer of wealth from the public sector to the private sector."&lt;ref&gt;France 24, "Massive Rally Calls on G20 to Put People Ahead of Banks," http://www.france24.com/en/20100626-massive-rally-calls-g20-put-people-ahead-banks{{dead link|date=September 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to eyewitness accounts, about 200 marchers broke away from the protest route on Queen Street and headed south on Bay Street towards the convention centre, through [[Financial District, Toronto|Financial District]]. The media would describe the break-off as led by the [[black bloc]], with demonstrators covering their bodies and faces in black clothes. Individuals using the same black bloc tactics have been suspected of being responsible for confrontations in other international summit protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=The Canadian Press |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/torontog20summit/article/829168--violent-black-bloc-tactics-on-display-at-g20-protest?bn=1 |title=Violent Black Bloc tactics on display at G20 protest |publisher=thestar.com |date= 2010-06-26|accessdate=2010-06-27 | location=Toronto| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100630071652/http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/torontog20summit/article/829168--violent-black-bloc-tactics-on-display-at-g20-protest?bn=1| archivedate= 30 June 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protesters dispersed to damage buildings and vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://toronto.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20100626/g8-g20-black-bloc-100626/20100626?hub=Toronto |title=CTV Toronto - 'Black Bloc' vandal take over Toronto streets - CTV News |publisher=Toronto.ctv.ca |date=2010-04-29 |accessdate=2010-06-27| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100629065237/http://toronto.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20100626/g8-g20-black-bloc-100626/20100626?hub=Toronto| archivedate= 29 June 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The intent as interpreted by some media was to distract police forces from the security zone so that other protesters could break in, but police maintained their blockades, protecting the fence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=the CNN Wire Staff |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/americas/06/27/canada.g20.protests/index.html?hpt=T1&amp;fbid=mZjulc3NxV6 |title=G-20 protests plagued by violence, vandalism - CNN.com |publisher=Edition.cnn.com |date= 2010-06-28|accessdate=2010-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vandals smashed the windows of various office buildings and stores along [[Yonge Street]], [[Queen Street West]] and [[College Street (Toronto)|College Street]] using hammers, flag poles, umbrellas, chunks of pavement and mailboxes.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite web|author=CBC.ca |url=http://news.ca.msn.com/canada/cbc-article.aspx?cp-documentid=24700313 |title=G20 protest brings violence, arrests - News - MSN CA |publisher=News.ca.msn.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-27| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100629073427/http://news.ca.msn.com/canada/cbc-article.aspx?cp-documentid=24700313| archivedate= 29 June 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conflicts also erupted between purported anarchists and journalists who were recording property destruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/TopStories/20100626/summit-protests-100626/ |title=Police attempt to clear crowds amid G20 unrest - CTV News |publisher=Ctv.ca |date=2010-04-29 |accessdate=2010-06-27| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100630162453/http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/TopStories/20100626/summit-protests-100626/| archivedate= 30 June 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a few hours, many black bloc demonstrators changed into civilian clothes and dissolved into the larger crowd as security forces began to increase in presence.

===Criticism of policing===
On December 7, 2010, Andre Marin, Ontario Ombudsman, issued a report called ''Caught in the Act'', an investigation into the legality of the ''Ontario Public Works Protection Act'', and, more specifically ''Regulation 233/10'', in Marin's words, "...known as the secret security regulation, a little known and widely misunderstood legal measure that was supposed to help the police keep the peace, but in my view wound up contributing to massive violations of civil rights."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://therealnews.com/t2/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=31&amp;Itemid=74&amp;jumival=6125 | title=Toronto G20: Will Police be Held Accountable After Scathing Ombudsman's Report |date=January 22, 2010 |publisher=The Real News| accessdate= 24 January 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:G-20 Toronto June 2010 (6).jpg|thumb|Police were allowed to arrest anyone within five metres of the fence who would neither leave nor identify himself.]]
A group of lawyers requested court injunctions against the [[Toronto Police Service]] from using newly purchased [[Long Range Acoustic Device]]s (LRAD), also known as sound cannons, during protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/toronto/story/2010/06/25/g20-sound-cannon.html |title=CBC News – Toronto – Limited G20 sound cannon use approved |publisher=Cbc.ca |date= 2010-06-25|accessdate=2010-06-26| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100627174237/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/toronto/story/2010/06/25/g20-sound-cannon.html| archivedate= 27 June 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sound cannons have been used in previous summit protests and have the ability to produce sound at ear-piercing volumes, potentially causing [[hearing impairment]].

The ''[[Toronto Star]]'' reported that the [[Executive Council of Ontario]] had implemented a regulation under the provincial Public Works Protection Act on June 2 granting the ISU sweeping powers of arrest within a specific boundary during the summit;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/article/828367--g20-law-gives-police-sweeping-powers-to-arrest-people |title=G20 law gives police sweeping powers to arrest people |publisher=thestar.com |date=2010-02-24 |accessdate=2010-06-24 | location=Toronto | first=Jennifer | last=Yang| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100628022808/http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/article/828367--g20-law-gives-police-sweeping-powers-to-arrest-people| archivedate= 28 June 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; the rule was said to designate the security fence as a [[public works]] and, as such, allow any police officer or guard to arrest any individual failing or refusing to provide identification within five metres of the security zone. The regulation was requested by [[Toronto Police Service]] chief [[Bill Blair (police chief)|Bill Blair]] and debate in the legislature was not required. [[Order in Council|Orders in Council]] such as this one are announced in the ''Ontario Gazette'', but the next issue of that publication was to be published after the order expired on June 28, a week after the summit ended.

Toronto Police Service held press conferences to speak out against inappropriate actions of protesters, including displaying items alleged to have been seized from protesters.

===Adam Nobody===
Protestor Adam Nobody, 27, was arrested in Queen's Park on 26 June. An amateur video uploaded to [[YouTube]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hym0afc03pE&lt;/ref&gt; showed at least a dozen officers surrounding and beating Nobody, who was not armed and did not appear to resist. He suffered a broken nose and cheekbone, and was charged with assaulting police. These charges were eventually dropped, and a [[Special Investigations Unit]] investigation was opened into the incident.  This investigation was closed without any charges laid, because the SIU was unable to identify the officers. They had covered their identification badges, police witnesses all claimed to be unable to identify them, and the arresting officer had written an invalid ID number on Nobody's arrest record.

Police chief Bill Blair insisted that a "forensic examination" had proven the video was "tampered with," removing proof that Nobody was an armed, violent criminal,  but soon retracted this statement admitting he had no evidence to support it. Blair's claims led to increased attention to the case, new witnesses coming forward, and a second video corroborating the first. On 30 November the SIU re-opened its investigation, obtained the co-operation of a police officer who witnessed the incident, and laid charges against Const. Babak Andalib-Goortani. The SIU has the names of other officers involved but has not yet laid charges against them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.thestar.com/news/torontog20summit/article/898432--blair-says-g20-youtube-video-was-tampered-with | location=Toronto | work=The Star | first=Jayme | last=Poisson | title=Blair blasts SIU over findings of 'probable' excessive force | date=2010-11-29| accessdate= 23 December 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.thestar.com/news/torontog20summit/article/901332--chief-blair-apologizes-to-g20-protester-at-centre-of-youtube-video | location=Toronto | work=The Star | first=Jayme | last=Poisson | title=Chief Blair apologizes to G20 protester at centre of YouTube video | date=2010-12-03| accessdate= 23 December 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.thestar.com/news/torontog20summit/article/902664 | location=Toronto | work=The Star | first=Rosie | last=DiManno | title=A second look at G20 police assault | date=2010-12-07| accessdate= 23 December 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/toronto/ontario-police-watchdog-reopens-g20-nobody-arrest-investigation/article1819175/ | location=Toronto | work=The Globe and Mail | first=Adrian | last=Morrow | title=Ontario police watchdog reopens G20 'Nobody' arrest investigation - The Globe and Mail | date=2010-11-30| accessdate= 23 December 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101201044629/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/toronto/ontario-police-watchdog-reopens-g20-nobody-arrest-investigation/article1819175/| archivedate= 1 December 2010| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.thestar.com/news/article/910856--g20-officer-tight-lipped-at-siu-appearance | location=Toronto | work=The Star | first=Jayme | last=Poisson | title=G20 officer tight-lipped at SIU appearance | date=2010-12-22| accessdate= 23 December 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/toronto/story/2010/12/22/charges-siu-g20.html | work=CBC News | title=SIU knows all 3 officers in alleged G20 assault | date=2010-12-22| accessdate= 23 December 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/toronto/how-a-man-named-nobody-became-the-battered-face-of-g20-protests/article1818432/ | location=Toronto | work=The Globe and Mail | first=Joe | last=Friesen | title=How a man named Nobody became the battered face of G20 protests | date=2010-11-30| accessdate= 23 December 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110122173321/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/toronto/how-a-man-named-nobody-became-the-battered-face-of-g20-protests/article1818432/| archivedate= 22 January 2011| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation and charges against police==

=== Babak Andalib-Goortani ===
In 2013, Andalib-Goortani was convicted of assault with a weapon for his role in Nobody's beating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Alyshah |last=Hasham |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2013/09/12/g20_assault_trial_guilty_verdict_for_officer_who_hit_adam_nobody.html |title=G20 assault trial: Guilty verdict for officer who hit Adam Nobody|newspaper=Toronto Star| date= September 12, 2013|accessdate=October 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trial judge, Ontario Court Justice Louise Botham, commented that "a police officer is not entitled to use unlimited force to affect an arrest."&lt;ref name="NtlPost2013"&gt;{{cite web |title=Toronto police officer Babak Andalib-Goortani found guilty of assault with weapon against G20 protester Adam Nobody |url=http://news.nationalpost.com/posted-toronto/toronto-police-officer-babak-andalib-goortani-found-guilty-of-assault-with-weapon-against-g20-protester-adam-nobody |date=September 12, 2013 |publisher=[[National Post]] |accessdate=November 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Botham, who was brought in to Toronto from [[Brampton, Ontario|Brampton]] to hear the case, subsequently sentenced Andalib-Goortani to 45 days in jail.&lt;ref name="CBC2013"&gt;{{cite web |title=G20 assault: Babak Andalib-Goortani gets 45-day sentence |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/g20-assault-babak-andalib-goortani-gets-45-day-sentence-1.2456893 |date=December 9, 2013 |publisher=[[CBC News]] |accessdate=November 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In her ruling, Botham indicated that the sentence was heavy influenced by video of Andalib-Goortani, along with a number of other officers whose disciplinary charges were dismissed, punching, kneeing, kicking, and striking the victim with a baton; stating that the period of incarceration was necessary to uphold the public's faith in the justice system.&lt;ref name="CBC2013"/&gt;

Less than 10 minutes after Botham announced the sentence in her Brampton courtroom, a Toronto court granted bail to Andalib-Goortani pending appeal.&lt;ref name="Sun2013"&gt;{{cite web |author=Shawn Jeffords |title=Toronto cop sentenced to 45 days in jail for Adam Nobody assault  |url=http://www.torontosun.com/2013/12/09/toronto-cop-gets-45-days-in-jail-for-adam-nobody-assault |date=December 9, 2013 |publisher=[[Toronto Sun]] |accessdate=November 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While Andalib-Goortani awaited appeal of that assault conviction, another assault with a weapon charge, for a G20 attack on journalist/blogger Wyndham {{nowrap|Bettencourt-McCarthy}}, was thrown out when the photograph taken a she was about to be hit with the baton, showing a riot-geared officer which another officer was ready to testify was Andalib-Goortani, was ruled inadmissible because the photo had been obtained through an anonymous website posting and the photographer could not be called to testify.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Colin Perkel, The Canadian Press |title=Babak Andalib-Goortani, G20 Cop, Acquitted On 2nd Assault Charge |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2014/09/24/babak-andalib-goortani_n_5875964.html |date=September 24, 2014 |publisher=[[Huffington Post]] |accessdate=November 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Sarah Sweet |title=Cop Acquitted on Charge of Assaulting Former ''Torontoist'' Contributor at G20 Protests — {{resize|Photographic evidence ruled inadmissible.}} |url=http://torontoist.com/2014/09/cop-acquitted-on-charge-of-assaulting-former-torontist-contributor-at-g20-protests/ |date=September 24, 2014 |publisher=[[Torontoist]] |accessdate=November 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Babak Andalib-Goortani acquitted in 2nd G20 incident |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/babak-andalib-goortani-acquitted-in-2nd-g20-incident-1.2776735 |date=September 24, 2014 |publisher=[[CBC News]] |accessdate=November 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== David 'Mark' Fenton ===
In 2014, Toronto Police Superintendent Mark Fenton, was charged with unlawful arrest and discreditable conduct in relation to the [[kettling]] incidents and faced a disciplinary hearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Wendy Gillis |title='Toronto deteriorated into a sense of lawlessness,' says G20 police commander |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/crime/2014/12/17/the_city_of_toronto_deteriorated_says_g20_police_commander_charged_with_misconduct.html |date=December 17, 2014 |publisher=[[Toronto Star]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fenton was one of two major incident commanders, in charge of the Major Incident Command Centre during the summit, and was the one on duty when he ordered the kettling of protestors both at the Novotel on the Esplanade and at Queen and Spadina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Colin Perkel |title=Misconduct case for Toronto police officer in G20 'kettling' put over |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/toronto/misconduct-case-for-toronto-police-officer-in-g20-kettling-put-over/article7035463/ |date=January 8, 2013 |publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]] |accessdate=November 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 25, 2015, more than five years after the Toronto G20 incidents leading to the charges, Fenton was found guilty of two counts of unlawful arrest and one count of discreditable conduct, disciplinary charges under the [[Police Services Act of Ontario|''Police Act'']], in relation to the "kettling" of protestors and passers-by at the intersection of Queen Street and Spadina Avenue and at the Novotel hotel on the Esplanade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Wendy Gillis |title=G20 commander apologizes after being convicted of misconduct |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/crime/2015/08/25/toronto-police-g20-supervisor-found-guilty-of-misconduct.html |date=August 25, 2015 |publisher=[[Toronto Star]] |accessdate=November 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In rendering judgment, retired Ontario judge John Hamilton explained that "Legitimate protesters … had the right not to be subject to arrest for making noise, chanting and sitting in the public street.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Cara McKenna, The Canadian Press |title=More than five years later, senior officer found guilty over mass arrests, ‘kettling’ at 2010 G20 protests |url=http://news.nationalpost.com/news/toronto-g20-officer-david-fenton-charged |date=August 25, 2015 |publisher=[[National Post]] |accessdate=November 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hamilton indicated that he believed Fenton was committed to serving the public, but that he did not properly understand the constitutional right of the public to protest.&lt;ref name="CP24"/&gt;  In addition to the unlawful arrest convictions, Hamilton deemed Fenton guilty of discreditable conduct resultant from keeping people corralled in the streets during a severe thunderstorm while his duty was to protect them from such harsh weather; however he found him not guilty of the same charge in relation to the Novotel because those unlawfully arrested did not suffer similar hardships.&lt;ref name="CP24"&gt;{{cite web |author=Cara McKenna, The Canadian Press |title=T.O. cop found guilty on 3 charges stemming from G20 protests |url=http://www.cp24.com/news/t-o-cop-found-guilty-on-3-charges-stemming-from-g20-protests-1.2531835 |date=August 25, 2015 |publisher=[[CP24]] |accessdate=November 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fenton was found not guilty on charges of unnecessary exercise of authority relating to the treatment of protestors after they were arrested and taken away because another officer of equal rank was in charge of the Prisoner Processing Centre; that officer was never charged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Senior police officer found guilty of 3 charges in G20 disciplinary hearing |url=http://www.reddeeradvocate.com/news/Senior_police_officer_found_guilty_of_3_charges_in_G20_disciplinary_hearing_322858231.html |date=August 25, 2015 |publisher=[[Red Deer Advocate]] |accessdate=November 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding count one (the Novotel Misconduct) Fenton was given a formal reprimand.  Regarding count two (the Queen and Spadina Misconduct) Fenton was sentenced to the forfeiture of 10 vacation days.  Regarding count three (the Queen and Spadina Discreditable Conduct) Fenton was sentenced to the forfeiture of 20 vacation days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ccla.org/cclanewsite/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Fenton-Penalty-Decision_June-15-2016-C1631822xA0E3A.pdf|title=Fenton Penalty Decision|last=Hamilton|first=John|date=June 15, 2016|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1791">'''Abstract particulars''' are [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] entities which are both [[abstract object]]s and [[particular]]s. 

==Examples==
Individual [[number]]s are often classified as abstract particulars because they are neither concrete objects nor [[universals]] — they are particular things which do not themselves occur in [[spacetime|space or time]]. [[Trope theory|Tropes]] are another example of entities cited as abstract particulars.

==History&lt;!--'Abstract particularity' redirects here--&gt;==
The concept of "'''abstract particularity'''"&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; ({{lang-de|abstrakte Besonderheit}}) was introduced in philosophy by [[G. W. F. Hegel]].&lt;ref&gt;Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel: ''[[The Science of Logic]]'', Cambridge University Press, 2010, p. 609. See also: Richard Dien Winfield, ''Hegel's Science of Logic: A Critical Rethinking in Thirty Lectures'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, 2012, p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alexander Aris Myint San Aung''' ({{lang-my|မြင့်ဆန်းအောင်}}&lt;!--The use of the HTML entity is the only way to make sure the Burmese characters display correctly--&gt;, {{IPA-my|mjɪ̰ɴ sʰáɴ àʊɴ|pron}}; born 12 April 1973) is an [[British people|English]] civil rights activist{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}. Alexander Aris is the elder son of [[Aung San Suu Kyi]] and [[Michael Aris]]. He is also a grandson of [[Aung San]], who founded the modern [[Myanmar Army|Burmese army]] and negotiated Burma's [[independence]] from the United Kingdom in 1947 and the pioneer of democracy in Myanmar.

==Early life==
Aris was born on 12 April 1973 in [[London]], United Kingdom, to Aung San Suu Kyi and Michael Aris. His younger brother Kim Aris was born in 1977. His family home was in [[Park Town, Oxford|Park Town]], [[North Oxford]]. In March 1988, his mother returned to Burma in order to nurse her dying mother [[Khin Kyi|Daw Khin Kyi]], the wife of Aung San.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Peter | last=Stanford | title=The pain of Aung Sun Suu Kyi’s sons, parted from their mother for 25 years | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/mother-tongue/9349279/The-pain-of-Aung-Sun-Suu-Kyis-sons-parted-from-their-mother-for-25-years.html | newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | date=22 June 2012 | accessdate=21 April 2014 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140526123324/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/mother-tongue/9349279/The-pain-of-Aung-Sun-Suu-Kyis-sons-parted-from-their-mother-for-25-years.html | archivedate=26 May 2014 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She did not return to Oxford until June 2012, having been placed under house arrest in Burma for political reasons in 1989.

==Education==
Aris was educated at two private schools in his home city of [[Oxford]], in southern England: at [[The Dragon School]], a co-educational preparatory (junior) school, followed by [[Magdalen College School, Oxford|Magdalen College School]], a senior school for boys, which he left in 1990. He graduated from [[Northern Illinois University]] in the United States and received a [[MSc]] in [[Mathematical Sciences]].

==Life after mother's detention==
In 1989, Alexander and his brother Kim were both stripped of their Burmese citizenships by the ruling junta. The two brothers are British nationals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/IL04Ae01.html |title=Myanmar back on a roadmap to nowhere |publisher=Asia Times Online |date=4 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, Alexander's mother Aung San Suu Kyi won the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for her efforts in Burma. At the time, Alexander Aris (age 18) and his brother Kim Aris (age 14) accepted the Prize on their mother's behalf. The Nobel Peace Prize's 1.3 million [[USD]] prize money was used to establish a [[health]] and [[education]] trust for the Burmese people.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, J. E. ''Who's who in contemporary women's writing.'' p. 22. Routledge, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, Alexander Aris has accepted many awards and given many speeches on behalf of his mother. They include accepting The Award of the International Human Rights Law Group; welcoming the arrival of the Olympic Torch in Spain;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.burmalibrary.org/show.php?cat=8 |title=By Aung San Suu Kyi (Statements, Speeches, Writings, Interviews) |publisher=Online Burma/Myanmar Library |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100601092626/http://www.burmalibrary.org/show.php?cat=8 |archivedate=2010-06-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and accepting the Presidential Medal of Freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1059551.stm |title=Clinton honours Burma's Suu Kyi |publisher=[[BBC]] |work=[[BBC News]] |date=7 December 2000 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090622154739/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1059551.stm |archivedate=22 June 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2851">'''All-over painting''' refers to the non-differential treatment of the surface of a work of two-dimensional art, for instance a painting. This concept is most popularly thought of as emerging in relation to the so-called "drip" paintings of [[Jackson Pollock]] and the "automatic writing" or "abstract calligraphy" of [[Mark Tobey]] in the 1950s, though the applicability of the term all-over painting would be wider than that. "All-over painting" is not a formal style of painting and the term does not represent an "[[art movement]]." Some painting under the heading [[color field]] painting displays the "all-over" painting style. Such a painting would fail to treat the top, for instance, differently from the bottom; the left than the right. Uniform treatment of all sections of the surface are the hallmark of all-over painting. All-over paintings would lack a dominant point of interest, or any indication of which way is "up." Some paintings by [[Cy Twombly]] have had this term applied to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O5-alloverpainting.html |title=all-over painting Facts, information, pictures &amp;#124; Encyclopedia.com articles about all-over painting |publisher=Encyclopedia.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enotes.com/oxford-art-encyclopedia/all-over-painting ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091007141533/http://www.enotes.com/oxford-art-encyclopedia/all-over-painting |date=October 7, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artprofessor.com/art-movements/all-over-painting.php |title=All-over Painting |publisher=Artprofessor.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artlex.com/ArtLex/Al.html |title=ArtLex's Al-Am page |publisher=Artlex.com |date=2007-02-16 |accessdate=2012-07-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120705050409/http://www.artlex.com/ArtLex/Al.html |archive-date=2012-07-05 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artnet.com/library/00/0019/t001940.asp |title=Directory of Art Services and Resources |publisher=artnet |date= |accessdate=2012-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''' Amalananda ''' was a South Indian Sanskrit scholar who lived during the reign of [[Mahadeva of Devagiri|Mahadeva]], the Yadava ruler of [[Daulatabad, Maharashtra|Devagiri]] who ruled from 1260 to 1271. Not much is known about his life and background. Anubhavānanda is believed to have been his preceptor.

Amalānanda wrote ''Vedānta Kalpatarū'' sometime before 1297. This book is a commentary on '' [[Bhāmatī]] '' of [[Vācaspati Miśra]] which text in its own turn is a commentary on [[Adi Sankara|Sankara]]’s commentary on the [[Brahma Sutras]] of [[Badarayana]]. His other works are – ''Śastra-darpana'' which is explanations of the Brahma Sutras, and ''Pancapādikā-darpana'' which is a commentary on [[Padmapadacharya|Padmapādācārya]]’s ''Pancapādika''. The language of these works is chaste and the thought-content is serious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of the Hindu World|author=Ganga Ram Garg|publisher=Concept Publishing Company|page=357|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WjDcd0cTFxQC&amp;pg=PA357&amp;lpg=PA357&amp;dq=amalananda+kalpataru&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=YpCNUgEBOq&amp;sig=rUD3jM7MAVlO-Q46VKMFYCPqau8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZonPU_WeONiWuATYyoL4CA&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwCDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=amalananda%20kalpataru&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Vācaspati Miśra, the author of ''Bhāmatī'' lived around 841.  [[Appayya Dikshita]] (1520-1593), son of Rangarājādhvarindra of [[Kanchipuram|Kānci]], and a prolific writer, wrote his ''Kalpataruparimala'', a commentary on Amalānanda’s ''Vedanta-Kalpataru''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=History of Indian Philosophy|author=Surendranath Dasgupta|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=418|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PoaMFmS1_lEC&amp;pg=PA418&amp;lpg=PA418&amp;dq=amalananda+kalpataru&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=89axbSgvBu&amp;sig=2NMgpIB9-9_-E6LFIJ3gl2toiec&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rovPU_bHAc6XuAT73YG4DQ&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwATgU#v=onepage&amp;q=amalananda%20kalpataru&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of Undian Literature Vol.1|author=Amresh Datta|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|pages=217–218|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ObFCT5_taSgC&amp;pg=PA218&amp;lpg=PA218&amp;dq=amalananda+kalpataru&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=mWz-ZuxOw6&amp;sig=yy9ZcL1UkGcRSRdBEcM4LnbBKdU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZonPU_WeONiWuATYyoL4CA&amp;ved=0CBoQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=amalananda%20kalpataru&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sankara explains ''Yadrecchāvadā'', referred to by the [[Shvetashvatara Upanishad]], as the doctrine of accidental effects which are due to chance; Amalānanda explains it as the doctrine that effects are produced at any time depending on definite causes. The same Upanishad mentions nature (''svabhava'') as the cause of the world. Sankara explains it as the natural powers inherent in different things. Amalānanda explains nature as that which exists so long as things exists e.g. breathing as the nature of the living body exists so long as the body exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Outlines of Indian Philosophy|author=Jadunath Sinha|publisher=Pilgrim Books|pages=61, 62|url= https://books.google.com/books/about/Outlines_of_Indian_Philosophy.html?id=99aBngEACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Backmasking.ogg|thumb|Example of a backmasked recording.]]

'''Backmasking''' is a [[sound recording and reproduction|recording]] technique in which a sound or message is recorded backward onto a track that is meant to be played forward. Backmasking is a deliberate process, whereas a message found through [[phonetic reversal]] may be unintentional.

Backmasking was popularised by [[The Beatles]], who used backward instrumentation on their 1966 album ''[[Revolver (Beatles album)|Revolver]]''.&lt;ref name="sullivan"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sullivan |first=Mark |title='More Popular Than Jesus': The Beatles and the Religious Far Right |journal=Popular Music |date=October 1987 |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=313–326 |doi=10.1017/S0261143000002348}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artists have since used backmasking for artistic, comedic and satiric effect, on both analogue and digital recordings. The technique has also been used to censor words or phrases for "clean" releases of [[Profanity|explicit]] songs.

In 1969, rumors of a backmasked message in the Beatles song "[[Revolution 9]]" sparked the [[Paul is dead]] urban legend.&lt;ref name="salon"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.salon.com/2017/06/24/what-exactly-lurks-within-the-backward-grooves-of-stairway-to-heaven/ |title=[Led Zeppelin IV] |last=Erik |first=Davis |date=2005 |work=Salon |publisher=Continuum |isbn=0826416586 |location=New York, NY |language=en-US |oclc=57452450 |access-date=2018-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, Christian groups in the United States alleged that backmasking was being used by prominent [[rock music]]ians for [[satanism|Satanic]] purposes, leading to record-burning protests and proposed anti-backmasking legislation by state and federal governments.&lt;ref&gt;Billiter, Bill (April 28, 1982). "Satanic Messages Played Back for Assembly Panel". ''Los Angeles Times'', page B3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many popular musicians have since been accused of including backmasked messages in their music. However, apparent backmasked messages may in fact be examples of [[pareidolia]] - the brain's tendency to recognize patterns in meaningless data - or coincidental [[phonetic reversal]].&lt;ref name="salon" /&gt;

==History==

===Development===
In 1877, [[Thomas Edison]] invented the [[phonograph]], a device allowing [[sound]] to be [[sound recording and reproduction|recorded and reproduced]] on a rotating cylinder with a [[stylus]] (or "needle") attached to a diaphragm mounted at the narrow end of a horn. [[Emile Berliner]] invented the familiar lateral-cut disc [[gramophone record|phonograph record]] in 1888.

In addition to recreating recorded sounds by placing the stylus on the cylinder or disc and rotating it in the same direction as during the recording, one could hear different sounds by rotating the cylinder or disc backwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Kittler |first=Friedrick |title=The Gramophone |work=Adventures in CyberSound |publisher=[[Australian Centre for the Moving Image]] |url=http://www.acmi.net.au/AIC/PHONO_KITTLER.html |archive-url=http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/13071/20040303-0000/www.acmi.net.au/AIC/PHONO_KITTLER.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2004-03-03 |accessdate=2007-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1878, Edison noted that, when played backwards, "the song is still melodious in many cases, and some of the strains are sweet and novel, but altogether different from the song reproduced in the right way".{{sfn|Blecha|2004|p=48}} The backwards playing of records was advised as training for magicians by occultist [[Aleister Crowley]], who suggested in his 1913 book ''[[Magick (Book 4)]]'' that an [[adept]] "train himself to think backwards by external means", one of which was to "listen to phonograph records, reversed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Crowley |first=Aleister |authorlink=Aleister Crowley |title=[[Magick (Book 4)]] |origyear=1913 |publisher=Weiser |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-87728-919-7 |page=648}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="salon" /&gt; In the movie ''[[Gold Diggers of 1935]]'', the end of the dancing pianos musical number "The Words Are in My Heart" is filmed in [[reverse motion]] with the accompanying instrumental score incidentally being reversed.

[[File:Reel-to-reel recorder tc-630.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tape recorder]]s allowed backward recording in [[recording studio]]s]]

The 1950s saw two new developments in audio technology: the development of ''[[musique concrète]]'', an [[avant-garde]] form of [[electronic music]], which involves [[audio engineering|editing]] together fragments of natural and industrial sounds; and the concurrent spread of the use of [[tape recorder]]s in [[recording studio]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=White |first=Ray |title=Musique Concrète |url=http://whitefiles.org/rws/rx01.htm |publisher = whitefiles.org | accessdate=2007-11-05| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071118094321/http://whitefiles.org/rws/rx01.htm| archivedate= November 18, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; These two trends led to tape music compositions, composed on [[magnetic tape|tape]] using techniques including [[reverse tape effects]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Peters |first=Michael |title=The Birth of Loop: A Short History of Looping Music |url=http://www.loopers-delight.com/history/Loophist.html |publisher=loopers-delight.com|accessdate=2007-03-10| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070328220400/http://www.loopers-delight.com/history/Loophist.html| archivedate= March 28, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Beatles]], who incorporated the techniques of ''concrète'' into their recordings, were responsible for popularizing the concept of backmasking.&lt;ref name="sullivan" /&gt; Singer [[John Lennon]] and producer [[George Martin]] both claimed they discovered the backward recording technique during the recording of 1966's ''[[Revolver (Beatles album)|Revolver]]''; specifically the album tracks "[[Tomorrow Never Knows]]" and "[[I'm Only Sleeping]]", and the single "[[Rain (Beatles song)|Rain]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Mugan |first=Chris |title=Subliminal advertising: The voice within |newspaper=The Independent | location = London |date=October 13, 2006 |url=http://arts.independent.co.uk/music/features/article1847509.ece |accessdate=2007-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lennon stated that, while under the influence of [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]], he accidentally played the tapes for "Rain" in reverse and enjoyed the sound. The following day he shared the results with the other Beatles, and the effect was used first in the [[guitar solo]] for "Tomorrow Never Knows" and later in the [[Coda (music)|coda]] of "Rain".&lt;ref name="stevens"&gt;{{cite book |last=Stevens |first=John |title=The Songs of John Lennon: The Beatles Years |year=2002 |publisher=Berklee Press |isbn=978-0-634-01795-7 |pages=149, 155–156}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Aldridge |first=Alan |title=The Beatles Illustrated Lyrics |year=1991 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |isbn=978-0-395-59426-1 |page=135 |quote=On the end of 'Rain' you hear me singing it backwards. We'd done the main thing at EMI and the habit was then to take the song home and see what you thought a little extra gimmick or what the guitar piece would be. So I got home about five in the morning, stoned out of my head, I staggered up to my tape recorder and I put it on, but it came out backwards, and I was in a trance in the earphones, what is it, what is it. It's too much, you know, and I really wanted the whole song backwards almost, and that was it. So we tagged it on the end.&lt;!-- This quote needs to attributed to the speaker, I assume it was Lennon but have not verified from source --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Martin, the band had been experimenting with changing the speeds of and reversing the "Tomorrow Never Knows" tapes, and Martin got the idea of reversing Lennon's vocals and guitar, which he did with a clip from "Rain". Lennon then liked the effect and kept it.&lt;ref name="ev"&gt;{{cite web |last=Olcott |first=Evan |title=Audio Reversal In Popular Culture |url=http://www.triplo.com/ev/reversal/ |publisher = Triplo Press | accessdate=2006-08-26|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060821143244/http://www.triplo.com/ev/reversal/ |archivedate = August 21, 2006|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Giuliano |first=Geoffrey |first2=Vrnda |last2= Devi |title=Glass Onion: The Beatles in their own words |year=1999 |publisher=Da Capo Press |isbn=978-0-306-80895-1 |page=265 |quote=I'd introduced John to backwards music on 'Rain' when I took his voice and turned it 'round when he was out on a coffee break.

Rain&amp;nbsp;... When the rain comes, they run and hide their heads" ({{Audio-nohelp|Rain backwards.ogg|listen}}; the last line is the reversed first verse of the song).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cross |first=Craig |title=The Beatles: Day-by-Day, Song-by-Song, Record-by-Record | publisher = iUniverse |year=2005 | location = New York |isbn=978-0-595-34663-9 |page=425}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversies===
The Beatles were involved in the spread of backmasking both as a recording technique and as the center of a [[controversy]]. The latter has its roots in an event in 1969, when [[WNIC|WKNR-FM]] DJ [[Russ Gibb]] received a phone call from a student at [[Eastern Michigan University]] who identified himself as "Tom". The caller asked Gibb about a rumor that Beatle [[Paul McCartney]] [[Paul is dead|had died]], and claimed that the Beatles song "[[Revolution 9]]" contained a backward message confirming the rumor. Gibb played the song backwards on his turntable, and heard "Turn me on, dead man&amp;nbsp;... turn me on, dead man&amp;nbsp;... turn me on, dead man&amp;nbsp;...".&lt;ref name="reeve"&gt;{{cite book |last=Reeve |first=Andru J |title=Turn Me On, Dead Man: The Beatles And The "Paul-Is-Dead" Hoax |publisher=AuthorHouse |pages=11–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gibb began telling his listeners about what he called "The Great Cover-up",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Yoakum |first=Jim |title=The Man Who Killed Paul McCartney |journal=[[Gadfly Online|The Gadfly]] |date=May–June 2000 |url=http://www.gadflyonline.com/archive/MayJune00/archive-mccartney.html |accessdate=2007-10-12| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071011195426/http://gadflyonline.com/archive/MayJune00/archive-mccartney.html| archivedate= October 11, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to the original clue were added various others, including the alleged backmasked message "Paul is a dead man, miss him, miss him, miss him", in "[[I'm So Tired]]".&lt;ref name="reeve" /&gt;

The "[[Paul is dead]]" rumor popularized the idea of backmasking in [[popular music]].&lt;ref name="sullivan" /&gt; After Gibb's show, many more songs were found to contain phrases that sounded like known spoken languages when reversed. Initially, the search was done mostly by fans of [[rock music]]; but, in the late 1970s,{{sfn|Blecha|2004|p=49}} during the rise of the [[Christian right]] in the United States,&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news|last=Holden |first=Stephen |title=Serious Issues Underlie a New Album from Styx |publisher=New York Times |date=1983-03-27 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/27/arts/serious-issues-underlie-a-new-album-from-styx.html |accessdate=2007-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[fundamentalist Christian]] groups began to claim that backmasked messages could bypass the [[Consciousness|conscious mind]] and reach the [[unconscious mind]], where they would be unknowingly accepted by the listener.{{sfn|Poundstone|1986|pp= 227–32}} In 1981, Christian DJ Michael Mills began stating on Christian radio programs that [[Led Zeppelin]]'s "[[Stairway to Heaven]]" contained hidden Satanic messages that were heard by the unconscious.&lt;ref name="davis"&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=David |editor-last= Barker |title=33{{fraction|1|3}} Greatest Hits, Volume One |publisher=Continuum |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-8264-1903-3 |chapter=Led Zeppelin IV |last=Davis |first=Erik |pages=212–214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1982, the [[Trinity Broadcasting Network]]'s [[Paul Crouch]] hosted a show with self-described neuroscientist William Yarroll, who argued that rock stars were cooperating with the [[Church of Satan]] to place hidden subliminal messages on records.{{sfn|Denisoff|1988|p=289}} Also in 1982, fundamentalist Christian pastor Gary Greenwald held public lectures on dangers of backmasking, along with at least one mass record-smashing.&lt;ref name="devil"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Vokey |first=John R. |first2=J.

===Legislation===
One result of the furor was the firing of five radio DJs who had encouraged listeners to search for backward messages in their record collections.{{sfn|Blecha|2004|p=49}} A more serious consequence was legislation by the state governments of [[Arkansas]] and [[California]]. The 1983 California bill was introduced to prevent backmasking that "can manipulate our behavior without our knowledge or consent and turn us into disciples of the [[Antichrist]]".{{sfn|Blecha|2004|p=51}} Involved in the discussion on the bill was a [[California State Assembly]] Consumer Protection and Toxic Materials Committee hearing, during which "Stairway to Heaven" was played backwards, and William Yaroll testified.{{sfn|Denisoff|1988|p=290}} The successful bill made the distribution of records with undeclared backmasking an invasion of privacy for which the distributor could be sued.&lt;ref name="devil" /&gt; The Arkansas law passed unanimously in 1983, referenced albums by [[The Beatles]], [[Pink Floyd]], [[Electric Light Orchestra]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]] and [[Styx (band)|Styx]],&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; and mandated that records with backmasking include a warning sticker: "Warning: This record contains backward masking which may be perceptible at a subliminal level when the record is played forward." However, the bill was returned to the state senate by Governor [[Bill Clinton]] and defeated.&lt;ref name="devil" /&gt; House Resolution 6363, introduced in 1982 by Representative [[Bob Dornan]] (R-California), proposed mandating a similar label;{{sfn|Poundstone|1983|pp=200–14}} the bill was referred to the Subcommittee on Commerce, Transportation and Tourism and was never passed.&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|97|HR|6363}} from [[THOMAS]]&lt;/ref&gt; Government action was also called for in the legislatures of Texas and Canada.&lt;ref name="devil" /&gt;

[[File:Compact Disc.jpg|thumb|right|The [[compact disc]] made finding backward messages difficult, causing interest in backmasking to decline.]]

With the advent of [[compact disc]]s in the 1980s, but prior to the advent of sound editing technology for [[personal computer]]s in the 1990s, it became more difficult to listen to recordings backwards, and the controversy died down.&lt;ref name="wsj" /&gt;

===Resurgence===
Although the backmasking controversy peaked in the 1980s, the general belief in subliminal manipulation became more widespread in the United States during the following decade,&lt;ref name="brannon" /&gt; with belief in Satanic backmasking on records persisting into the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first= Kenneth J. |editor-last= Bindas |title=America's Musical Pulse: Popular Music in Twentieth-Century Society|publisher=Praeger |year=1992 |isbn=978-0-275-94306-6 |last=Racocy |first=Rudolf E. |chapter=Introduction: The Importance of Music to People |pages=xvi–xvii}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the development of [[digital audio editor|sound editing software]] with audio reversal features simplified the process of reversing audio,&lt;ref name="wsj" /&gt; which previously could only be done with full fidelity using a professional tape recorder.{{sfn|Poundstone|1986|pp= 227–32}} The [[Sound Recorder (Windows)|Sound Recorder]] utility, included with [[Microsoft Windows]] from [[Windows 95]] to [[Windows XP]], allows one-click audio reversal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Help with Windows Sound Recorder |publisher=Capital Community College |url=http://www.ccc.commnet.edu/dl/dl-help/help-SoundRecorder.htm |accessdate=2007-05-09| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070429121019/http://www.ccc.commnet.edu/DL/dl-help/help-SoundRecorder.htm| archivedate= April 29, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; as does popular [[Open-source software|open source]] sound editing software [[Audacity (audio editor)|Audacity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Audacity: Features |url=http://audacity.sourceforge.net/about/features|publisher = SourceForge.net | accessdate=2007-05-09| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070504192124/http://audacity.sourceforge.net/about/features| archivedate= May 4, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the growth of the [[Internet]], backmasked message searchers used such software to create websites featuring backward music samples, which became a widely used method of exploring backmasking in popular music.&lt;ref name="wsj" /&gt;

In January 2014, the first backmasked video was released as part of a Grammy Awards promotional campaign. A customized video player allowed the user to watch a piece of film accompanied by a music soundtrack both forwards and backwards. The backwards content contained a hidden visual story and the words 'music unleashes you' embedded into the reversed audio track.

[[File:Digital.signal.svg|thumb|right|The switch to [[digital audio]] made recording backmasked messages quicker and easier.]]

Backmasking has been used as a [[sound recording and reproduction|recording]] technique since the 1960s. In the era of [[magnetic tape sound recording]], backmasking required that the source [[reel-to-reel audio tape recording|reel-to-reel]] tape actually be played backwards, which was achieved by first being wound onto the original takeup reel, then reversing the reels so as to use that reel as the source (this would reverse the stereo channels as well). [[Digital audio]] recording has greatly simplified the process.&lt;ref name="radar" /&gt;

Backmasked words are unintelligible noise when played forward, but when played backwards are clear speech.&lt;ref name="robinson" /&gt; Listening to backmasked audio with most [[phonograph|turntables]] requires disengaging the drive and rotating the album by hand in reverse&lt;ref name="seattle" /&gt; (though some can play records backwards).{{sfn|Poundstone|1986|pp= 227–32}} With [[magnetic tape]], the tape must be reversed and spliced back into the cassette.&lt;ref name="seattle" /&gt; [[Compact Disc|Compact disc]]s were difficult to reverse when first introduced, but [[digital audio editor]]s, which were first introduced in the late 1980s and became popular during the next decade,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Portable Digital Audio Workstations (Buyer's Guide) |journal=Theatre Crafts International |date=1997-02-01 |url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/premium/0286/0286-9303362.html |accessdate=2007-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; allow easy reversal of audio from digital sources.&lt;ref name="wsj" /&gt;

===Satanic backmasking===
In the 1973 film ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'', a tape of noises from the possessed victim was discovered to contain a message when the tape was played backwards. This scene might have inspired subsequent copycat musical effects.
Although the Satanic backmasking controversy involved mainly [[classic rock]] songs, whose authors denied any intent to promote [[Satanism]], backmasking has been used by [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] bands to deliberately insert messages in their lyrics or imagery. Bands have utilized Satanic imagery for commercial reasons.{{sfn|Blecha|2004|p=52}} For example, [[thrash metal]] band [[Slayer]] included at the start of the band's 1985 album ''[[Hell Awaits]]'' a deep backmasked voice chanting "Join Us" over and over ({{Audio-nohelp||listen}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jenson |first=K.

When played backwards, the songs "665" and "667" reveal a song about [[Santa Claus]].
[[Marilyn Manson]] used this technique. For example, in the beginning of his song "Tourniquet" when played backwards, his voice is heard saying "This is my lowest point of vulnerability" as explained in his book ''[[The Long Hard Road Out of Hell]]''.

===Aesthetic use===
Backmasking is often used for aesthetics, i.e., to enhance the meaning or sound of a track.{{sfn|Blecha|2004|p=49}} During the [[Judas Priest]] subliminal message trial, lead singer [[Rob Halford]] admitted to recording the words "In the dead of the night, love bites" backwards into the track "Love Bites", from the 1984 album ''[[Defenders of the Faith]]''. Asked why he recorded the message, Halford stated that "When you're composing songs, you're always looking for new ideas, new sounds."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Judas Priest's lead singer testifies |newspaper=New York Times |date=August 1, 1990 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/01/arts/judas-priest-s-lead-singer-testifies.html?sec=health |accessdate=2007-04-20 |agency= Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stanley Kubrick]] used "Masked Ball", an adaptation by [[Jocelyn Pook]] of her earlier work "Backwards Priests" (from the album Flood) featuring reversed [[Romanian language|Romanian]] chanting, as the background music for the [[masquerade ball]] scene in ''[[Eyes Wide Shut]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Mike |last=Zwerin |title=Kubrick's approval sets seal on classical crossover success: Pook's unique musical mix |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/27/style/27iht-pook.t.html |work=[[International Herald Tribune]] | location = Paris |date=October 27, 1999 |accessdate=2012-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of "[[Before I Forget (song)|Before I Forget]]" by [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]], lead singer [[Corey Taylor]]'s voice can be heard saying "...&amp;nbsp;You're wasting it" which is in reference to how [[Rick Rubin]], the producer of their album ''[[Vol. 3: The Subliminal Verses]]'', wanted Taylor to change the chorus vocal melody because he felt it wasn't catchy; however, Taylor stood his ground and the chorus stayed unchanged.&lt;ref&gt;"Corey Taylor Interview at 98 KUPD".

One backmasking technique is to reverse an earlier part of a song.

[[John Lennon]] originally wanted to do so with "[[Rain (The Beatles song)|Rain]]", but objections by producer [[George Martin]] and bandmate [[Paul McCartney]] cut the backward section to 30 seconds.&lt;ref name="stevens" /&gt; [[The Stone Roses]] have made heavy use of this technique in songs including "[[Don't Stop (Stone Roses song)|Don't Stop]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Pomroy |first=Matt |title=The Stone Roses: self-titled |date=October 22, 2002 |publisher=[[PopMatters]] |url=http://www.popmatters.com/music/reviews/s/stoneroses-st.shtml |accessdate=2007-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Guernica (song)|Guernica]]", and "[[Simone (song)|Simone]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |last=Brown |first=Ian |interviewer=Adam Walton |date=February 2, 2000|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/walesmusic/2011/11/ian-brown-stone-roses-interview-2000.shtml|accessdate=2012-01-25|title=I've only served eight weeks, I can't really write a concept album about jail |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20111112003944/http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/walesmusic/2011/11/ian-brown-stone-roses-interview-2000.shtml |archivedate= November 12, 2011 |publisher= BBC |work= Wales Music}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are all backwards versions of other Stone Roses tracks, sometimes overdubbed with new vocals that sound somewhat similar to the initial track when backmasked. Meanwhile, [[Klaatu (band)|Klaatu]] used the reversed vocals from "[[Anus of Uranus]]" (from their first album, ''[[3:47 EST]]'') as the vocals for the song "[[Silly Boys]]" (on their third album, ''[[Sir Army Suit]]''). The lyrics for "Silly Boys" on the lyric sheet from ''Sir Army Suit'' are accordingly printed backwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bradley |first=David |title=Klaatu Identities and Beatles Rumors |url=http://www.klaatu.org/klaatu1.html |date=January 24, 2004 |work=The Official Klaatu Homepage |accessdate=2009-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Danish people|Danish]] band [[Mew (band)|Mew]]'s 2009 album ''[[No More Stories...]]'' contains a track, "New Terrain", which, when listened to in reverse, reveals a new song, entitled "Nervous".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=New Terrain / Nervous |publisher=MewX |date=July 28, 2009 |url=http://www.mewx.info/wp/?p=464 |accessdate=2009-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When done on tape, such use of backmasking is known as ''[[reverse tape effects]]''. One example is [[Matthew Sweet]]'s 1999 album ''[[In Reverse]]'', which includes reversed guitar parts which were played directly onto a tape running in reverse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Simons |first=David |title=Matthew Sweet: Rebuilding the Wall of Sound |journal=[[Guitar Player]] |date=January 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For live concerts, the guitar parts were played live on stage using a backward emulator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Simons |first=David |title=Back on the bus |magazine=Onstage |date=January 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Humorous and parody messages===
[[File:Sox Satanic Subliminals.png|thumb|right|The manual for the popular sound program [[SoX]] includes the "reverse" option "for finding Satanic subliminals"]]

A common use of backmasking is hiding a comedic or parodical message backwards in a song. The [[B-side]] of the 1966 [[Napoleon XIV]] single "[[They're Coming to Take Me Away, Ha-Haaa!]]" is a reversed version of the entire forwards record, titled "!aaaH-aH ,yawA eM ekaT oT gnimoC er'yehT". The forward version reached #3 in the US charts and #4 in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= They're Coming To Take Me Away, Ha-haaa by Napoleon XIV |editor-last= Wiser |editor-first= Carl |work=Songfacts |publisher= songfacts.com |url= http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=675 |accessdate= 2007-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[WWE]] wrestler [[Al Snow]] had a theme song that had backmasking in it. The song was mostly instrumental, but at one point a clearly audible voice can be heard saying a line of gibberish. When the song is played backward, the gibberish is actually saying "I AM THE ONE IN CONTROL". The message played on Al Snow's character as an unstable mad man.

[[The Beatles]] song "[[Free as a Bird]]" was originally composed and recorded in 1977 as a home demo by John Lennon.  In 1995 a studio version of the recording, incorporating contributions from Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, was released as a new single from ''The Beatles Anthology 1'' project, 25 years after their break-up and 15 years after Lennon's death.  In a humorous self-parody and tribute to Lennon, the surviving Beatles inserted a backmasked clip of Lennon saying "Turned out nice again" at the very end of the song.

[[Pink Floyd]] dropped a backmasked message into "[[Empty Spaces]]":
* ''...&amp;nbsp;Congratulations. You have just discovered the secret message. Please send your answer to Old Pink, care of the Funny Farm, Chalfont&amp;nbsp;...''
* ''Roger! Carolyne's on the phone!''
* ''Okay.''

The first line may refer to former lead singer [[Syd Barrett]], who is thought to have suffered a [[nervous breakdown]] years earlier.{{sfn|Patterson|2004|p=186}} The first known instance of Pink Floyd having a backwards message is on the song "[[Bike (song)|Bike]]". When played backward, it produces a nonsense poem.

In [["Weird Al" Yankovic]]'s "Nature Trail to Hell", from 1984's ''[["Weird Al" Yankovic in 3-D]]'', Yankovic's backmasked voice declares that "[[Satan]] eats [[Cheez Whiz]]" ({{Audio-nohelp||listen}}).&lt;ref name="wsj" /&gt; Another early example can be found on [[the J. Geils Band]] track "No Anchovies, Please", from 1980s album ''[[Love Stinks (album)|Love Stinks]]''. The message, disguised as a foreign-sounding language spoken under the narration, is, "It doesn't take a genius to tell the difference between chicken shit and chicken salad."{{sfn|Poundstone|1986|pp= 227–32}}
Belgian act [[Poésie Noire]] included a satirical backmasked message on their 1988 album ''Tetra'' saying "You fucking asshole, play the record in the normal way".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.poesienoire.com/php/matrix.php?action=listall |title= Poésie Noire - The Matrix |work= poesienoire.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tenacious D]] includes the backmasked message "Eat Donkey Crap" at the end of "Karate" from their self-titled first album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Marshall |first=Steve |title=Tenacious D: Tenacious D (Epic) |work= The Night Owl |publisher= thenightowl.com |year=2001 |url=http://www.thenightowl.com/reviews/tenacious.htm |accessdate=2009-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Electric Light Orchestra]] and [[Styx (band)|Styx]], following their involvement in the 1980s backmasking controversy, released songs that parody the allegations made against them. ELO, after being accused of Satanic backmasking on their 1974 album ''[[Eldorado (Electric Light Orchestra album)|Eldorado]]'', included backmasked messages in two songs on their next album, 1975's ''[[Face the Music (Electric Light Orchestra album)|Face The Music]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Michel |first=Rob |title=1974: Electric Light Orchestra: Eldorado |work=Counting Out Time |publisher=Dutch Progressive Rock Page |date=August 2002 |url=http://www.dprp.net/proghistory/index.php?i=1974_03 |accessdate=2007-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Down Home Town]]" begins with a voice twice repeating (in reverse) "Face the mighty waterfall".&lt;ref name="elo"&gt;{{cite web |title=Secret Messages |work=My Electric Light Orchestra Fan Site |publisher=FutureBright |url=http://elo.futurebright.com/Secrets.htm |accessdate=2006-07-27| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060828074741/http://elo.futurebright.com/Secrets.htm| archivedate= August 28, 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; And the opening instrumental "[[Fire On High]]" contains the backmasked message "The music is reversible, but time is not.

Some messages chastise or poke fun at the listener who is playing the song backwards. One such message was included by "Weird Al" Yankovic in "[[I Remember Larry]]", from the 1996 album ''[[Bad Hair Day]]'', on which Yankovic lightly chastises the listener with the backmasked remark, "Wow, [you] must have an awful lot of free time on your hands" ({{Audio-nohelp||listen}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lick |first=Marty "Gumby" |author2="Happy Steve" Chai| title="Weird Al" Yankovic Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Al-oholics Anonymous |url=http://www.al-oholicsanonymous.com/faq/index.html |accessdate=2007-03-17| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070210010935/http://www.al-oholicsanonymous.com/faq/index.html| archivedate= February 10, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the [[The B-52's|B-52's]] song "Detour Through your Mind", from the 1986 LP ''[[Bouncing off the Satellites]]'', contains the message, "I buried my parakeet in the backyard.

[[Devo]]'s hit song "[[Whip It (Devo song)|Whip It]]" has [[Mark Mothersbaugh]] saying "Hey come over here!" when the song is played backwards.

Backmasking was also parodied in a 2001 episode of the television series ''[[The Simpsons]]'' titled "[[New Kids on the Blecch]]." [[Bart Simpson]] joins a [[boy band]] called the Party Posse, whose song "Drop Da Bomb" includes the repeated lyric "Yvan eht nioj." [[Lisa Simpson]] becomes suspicious and plays the song backward, revealing the backmasked message "Join the Navy", which leads her to realize that the boy band was created as a subliminal recruiting tool for the United States Navy.

The [[Futurama]] episode [[Calculon 2.0]] also has a scene where an installation disc is played backward on what looks like an old fashioned gramophone player, with the words "rise from the dead in the name of Satan" coming from it.

===Critical or explicit messages===
[[File:Zappa.jpg|thumb|right|[[Frank Zappa]] used backmasking to avoid censorship.]]

Backmasking has also been used to record statements perhaps too critical or explicit to be used forwards. Frank Zappa used backmasking to avoid censorship of the track "[[Hot Poop]]", from ''[[We're Only in It for the Money]]'' (1968). The released version contains at the end of its side "A" the backmasked message "Better look around before you say you don't care. / Shut your fucking mouth 'bout the length of my hair. / How would you survive / If you were alive / shitty little person?" This profanity-laced verse, originally from the song "Mother People", was censored by Verve Records, so Zappa edited the verse out, reversed it, and inserted it elsewhere in the album as "Hot Poop" (though even in the backward message the word "fucking" is censored).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=We're Only In It for the Money |last=Pacholski |first=Luke |url=http://www.lukpac.org/~handmade/patio/vinylvscds/money.html |publisher=lukpac.org |accessdate=2006-07-29| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060718065134/http://www.lukpac.org/~handmade/patio/vinylvscds/money.html| archivedate= July 18, 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the same album, a modified backmasking can be heard in "[[Harry, You're a Beast]]" with Madge saying, "Don't come in me, in me" repeatedly before she starts crying. In at least one bootleg version of the album, these words are very clear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frank Zappa - Bootleg (We're only in it for the money 1967) Parte2|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAEyXHOY0qk|website=youtube.com|accessdate=1 August 2016|date=Oct 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example is found in [[Roger Waters]]' 1992 album ''[[Amused to Death]]'', on which Waters recorded a backward message, possibly critical of film director [[Stanley Kubrick]], who had refused to let Waters sample a breathing sound from ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Simon |first=Michael |title=Amused To Death Trivia |publisher=Roger Waters International Fan Club |url=http://www.rogerwaters.org/atdtrivia.html |accessdate=2007-03-17 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208094658/http://www.rogerwaters.org/atdtrivia.html |archivedate=February 8, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The message appears in the song "[[Perfect Sense Part 1]]", in which Waters' backmasked voice says, "Julia, however, in light and visions of the issues of Stanley, we have changed our minds. We have decided to include a backward message, Stanley, for you and all the other book burners."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Roger Waters – Perfect Sense |publisher=[[UGO Networks]] |url=http://www.ugo.com/music/backmasked-tracks/?cur=perfect-sense |accessdate=2009-06-13 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120605002334/http://www.ugo.com/music/backmasked-tracks/?cur=perfect-sense |archive-date=June 5, 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Censorship===
A further use of backmasking is to [[censorship|censor]] words and phrases deemed inappropriate on [[radio edit]]s and "[[Expurgation|clean]]" album releases.&lt;ref name="nelson"&gt;{{cite web|last=Nelson |first=Chris |title=Sticker Ban Policy: Family Values Or Consumer Fraud? |publisher=[[VH1]] |date=1998-09-08 |url=http://www.vh1.com/news/articles/501064/19980908/story.jhtml |accessdate=2007-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001091203/http://www.vh1.com/news/articles/501064/19980908/story.jhtml |archivedate=October 1, 2007 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[The Fugees]]' clean version of the album ''[[The Score (Fugees album)|The Score]]'' contains various backmasked [[profanity|profanities]];&lt;ref name="nelson" /&gt; thus, when playing the album backwards, the censored words are clearly audible among the backward gibberish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=mcc |publisher=[[Everything2]] |title=Music that sounds better backward than forward |url=http://everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=677630 |accessdate=2006-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; When used with the word "shit", this type of backmasking results in a sound similar to "ish". As a result, "[[wikt:ish|ish]]" became a [[euphemism]] for "shit".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |editor-last=Rader |editor-first= Walter |work=The Online Slang Dictionary |author= Emily M. |origyear= November 12, 1997 |date= March 5, 2011 |url= http://onlineslangdictionary.com/definition+of/ish |title= Definition of ish: noun |accessdate= 2014-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Britney Spears]]' 2011 song "[[Till The World Ends]]", Spears says "if you want this good shit". However, on the official version, "shit" is reversed, creating the "ish" sound; therefore, the official version says "if you want this good ish". Backmasking is also used to censor the word "[[joint (cannabis)|joint]]" in the video for "[[You Don't Know How It Feels]]" by [[Tom Petty]], resulting in the line "Let's roll another tnioj".&lt;ref name="TomPettySun"&gt;{{cite web

[[Electric Light Orchestra]] was accused of hiding a backward Satanic message in their 1974 album ''[[Eldorado (Electric Light Orchestra album)|Eldorado]]''. The title track, "[[Eldorado (Electric Light Orchestra song)|Eldorado]]", was said to contain the message "He is the nasty one / Christ, you're infernal / It is said we're dead men / Everyone who has the mark will live."{{sfn|Poundstone|1983|pp=200–14}} ELO singer and songwriter [[Jeff Lynne]] responded by calling this accusation (and the related charge of being "devil-worshippers") "[[bollocks|skcollob]]",&lt;ref name="ftm"&gt;{{cite web |title=Electric Light Orchestra Biogs |publisher=Face The Music |url=http://www.ftmusic.com/biogs/elo/elo_biog.html |accessdate=2007-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and stating that the message "is absolutely manufactured by whoever said, 'That's what it said.' It doesn't say anything of the sort."{{sfn|Patterson|2004|p=174}} The group included several backward messages in later albums in response to the accusations.

In 1981, [[Styx (band)|Styx]] was accused of putting the backward message "Satan move through our voices" on the song "[[Snowblind (Styx song)|Snowblind]]", from ''[[Paradise Theatre (album)|Paradise Theatre]]''.&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; Guitarist [[James Young (American musician)|James Young]] called these charges "rubbish,"&lt;ref name="arar"&gt;{{cite news |last=Arar |first=Yardena |title=Satanic records or balderdash: Just what the devil's going on? |newspaper=The Daily Herald | location = Arlington Heights, IL |date=May 26, 1982 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and responded, "If we want to make a statement, we'll do it in a way that people can understand us and not in a way where you have to go out and buy a $400 tape player to understand us." The vinyl reproduction of ''[[Paradise Theatre (album)|Paradise Theater]]'' had laser etching on side one, spelling out Styx at the top, and two ladies facing each other on the sides. But on side two, the side with the song (Snow Blind) it had a black label with a small hole cut out where you could place the eraser side of a pencil, and play the album backwards to hear the backward message.&lt;ref name="kilroy"&gt;{{cite news |last=Hoekstra |first=Dave |title=Styx makes a statement |newspaper=Suburban Sun-Times | location = Chicago |date=April 1, 1983 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, the band released a concept album, ''[[Kilroy Was Here (album)|Kilroy Was Here]]'', satirizing the [[Moral Majority]].

A well-known alleged message is found in rock group [[Led Zeppelin]]'s 1971 song "[[Stairway to Heaven]]". The backwards playing of a portion of the song purportedly results in words beginning with "Here's to my sweet Satan" ({{Audio-nohelp|STH reverse.ogg|listen}}).&lt;ref name="milner"&gt;{{cite web |last=Milner |first=Jeff |title=Jeff Milner's Backmasking Site |url=http://jeffmilner.com/backmasking.htm |publisher = jeffmilner.com |accessdate=2007-03-14| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070314014834/http://jeffmilner.com/backmasking.htm| archivedate= March 14, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Swan Song Records]] issued a statement to the contrary: "Our turntables only play in one direction—forwards."&lt;ref name="davis" /&gt; Led Zeppelin vocalist [[Robert Plant]] denied the accusations in an interview: "To me it's very sad, because 'Stairway To Heaven' was written with every best intention, and as far as reversing tapes and putting messages on the end, that's not my idea of making music."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |last=Plant |first=Robert |subjectlink=Robert Plant |interviewer=J.D.

===Subliminal persuasion===
{{further|Subliminal message}}

====Fundamentalist Christian groups====
Various [[fundamentalist Christian]] groups have declared that Satan—or Satan-influenced musicians—use backmasked messages to subliminally alter behavior. Pastor Gary Greenwald claimed that subliminal messages backmasked into rock music induce listeners towards sex and drug use.{{sfn|Vokey|2005|p=258}} Minister Jacob Aranza wrote in his 1982 book ''Backward Masking Unmasked'' that rock groups "are using backmasking to convey satanic and drug related messages to the subconscious."{{sfn|Blecha|2004|p=49}} Christian DJ Michael Mills argued in 1981 that "the subconscious mind is being successfully affected by the repetition of beat and lyrics—being affected through a subliminal message."&lt;ref&gt;Mills, Michael. [http://blog.wfmu.org/freeform/2007/01/365_days_1_the_.html Hidden and Satanic Messages In Rock Music]. Radio interview, 1981, blog.wfmu.org. [http://blogfiles.wfmu.org/DP/2007/01/001_Michael_Mills_01_Introduction.mp3 Introduction], at 1:22&lt;/ref&gt; Mills has toured America warning Christian parents about subliminal messages in [[rock music]].&lt;ref name="devil" /&gt;

Some Christian websites have claimed that backmasking is widely used for Satanic purposes.&lt;ref name="robinson" /&gt; The web page for Alabama group [[Dial-the-Truth Ministries]] argues for the existence of Satanic backmasking in "[[Stairway to Heaven]]", saying that the song contains the backward message, "It's my sweet Satan&amp;nbsp;... Oh I will sing because I live with Satan."&lt;ref name="watkins" /&gt;

====PMRC====
In 1985, Joe Stuessy testified to the [[United States Congress]] at the [[Parents Music Resource Center]] hearings that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The message [of a piece of heavy metal music] may also be covert or subliminal. Sometimes subaudible tracks are mixed in underneath other, louder tracks. These are heard by the subconscious but not the conscious mind. Sometimes the messages are audible but are backward, called backmasking. There is disagreement among experts regarding the effectiveness of subliminals. We need more research on that.&lt;ref name="pmrc"&gt;{{citation |author= United States Senate |year= 1985 |url= http://www.joesapt.net/superlink/shrg99-529/ |title= Record Labeling: Hearing before the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation |work= United States Senate, Ninety-ninth Congress, First Session on Contents of Music and the Lyrics of Records (September 19, 1985) |location= Washington, DC |publisher= U.S. Government Printing Office |pages= 118–25 |via= Joesapt.net |accessdate= 2007-06-09 |postscript= .}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Stuessy's written testimony stated that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Some messages are presented to the listener backwards. While listening to a normal forward message (often somewhat nonsensical), one is simultaneously being treated to a backwards message (in other words, the lyric sounds like one set of words going forward, and a different set of words going backwards). Some experts believe that while the conscious mind is absorbing the forward lyric, the subconscious is working overtime to decipher the backwards message.&lt;ref name="pmrc" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Court cases====
Serial killer [[Richard Ramirez]], on trial in 1988, stated that [[AC/DC]]'s music, and specifically the song "[[Night Prowler]]" on ''[[Highway to Hell (album)|Highway to Hell]]'', inspired him to commit murder.&lt;ref name="watkins"&gt;{{cite web |last=Watkins |first=Terry |title=Rock Music: The Devil's Advocate |publisher=[[Dial-the-Truth Ministries]] |url=http://www.av1611.org/rock.html |accessdate=2007-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reverse speech]] advocate [[David John Oates]] claimed that "[[Highway to Hell (song)|Highway to Hell]]", on the same album, contains backmasked messages including "I'm the law", "my name is Lucifer", and "she belongs in hell".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Von Ulrich |first=Meyerratken |url=http://www.reversespeech.com/esotera.htm |title=Untitled |work=reversespeech.com |others=Edited by George, Michael, translated from German by Galbraith, Evan |accessdate=2007-03-17 |postscript=. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061230184800/http://www.reversespeech.com/esotera.htm |archivedate=December 30, 2006 |df=mdy }} Originally published in ''Esotera'' magazine (June 1997).&lt;/ref&gt; AC/DC's [[Angus Young]] responded that "you didn't need to play [the album] backwards, because we never hid [the messages].

In 1990, British [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[Judas Priest]] was sued over a [[suicide pact]] made by two young men in [[Nevada]]. The lawsuit by their families claimed that the 1978 Judas Priest album ''[[Stained Class]]'' contained hidden messages, including the forward subliminal words "Do it" in the song "[[Better By You, Better Than Me]]" (a cover version of a [[Spooky Tooth]] song), and various backward subliminal messages. The case was dismissed by the judge for insufficient evidence of Judas Priest's placement of subliminal messages on the record,{{sfn|Vokey|2005|p=261}} and the judge's ruling stated that "The scientific research presented does not establish that subliminal stimuli, even if perceived, may precipitate conduct of this magnitude. There exist other factors which explain the conduct of the deceased independent of the subliminal stimuli."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Sophia |first=Cassiel |title=Subliminal Suicide? |publisher=Metareligion |url=http://www.meta-religion.com/Secret_societies/Conspiracies/Mind_Control/subliminal_suicide.htm |accessdate=2007-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judas Priest members commented that if they wanted to insert subliminal commands in their music, messages leading to the deaths of their fans would be counterproductive, and they would prefer to insert the command "Buy more of our records."&lt;ref&gt;Van Taylor, David. KNPB Channel 5 Public Broadcasting, 1982: ''Dream Deceivers: The Story Behind James Vance Vs. Judas Priest''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Skepticism===
[[Skepticism|Skeptic]] [[Michael Shermer]] claims that the emergence of the "[[Paul is dead]]" phenomenon, including the alleged message at the end of "[[I'm So Tired]]", was caused by faulty perception of a pattern.

Audio engineer Evan Olcott claims that messages by artists including Queen and Led Zeppelin are coincidental [[phonetic reversal]]s, in which the spoken or sung [[phoneme]]s form new combinations of words when listened to backwards.&lt;ref name="ev" /&gt; Olcott states that "Actually engineering or planning a phonetic reversal is next to impossible, and even more difficult when trying to design it with words that fit into a song."&lt;ref name="ev2" /&gt;

In 1985, University of Lethbridge psychologists John Vokey and J. Don Read conducted a study using [[Psalm 23]] from the [[Bible]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s "[[Another One Bites the Dust]]", and other sound passages made up for the experiment. Vokey and Read concluded that if backmasking does exist, it is ineffective. Participants had trouble noticing backmasked phrases when the samples were played forwards, were unable to judge the types of messages (Christian, Satanic, or commercial), and were not led to behave in a certain way as a result of being exposed to the backmasked phrases. Vokey concluded that "we could find no effect of the meaning of engineered, backward messages on listeners' behaviour, either consciously or unconsciously."{{sfn|Vokey|2005|p=260}} Similar results to Vokey and Read's were obtained by D. Averill in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Averill |first=D. |date=September 12, 1982 |title=Did the Devil make you do it? |newspaper =Tulsa World |location = Oklahoma |page=17}} Cited in {{Harvnb|Zusne &amp; Jones|1989|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1988 experiment by T.E.

The finding of backward Satanic messages has been explained as caused by the [[observer-expectancy effect]]. The ''[[Skeptic's Dictionary]]'' states that "you probably won't hear [backmasked] messages until somebody first points them out to you. Perception is influenced by expectation and expectation is affected by what others prime you for."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Carroll |first=Robert Todd |authorlink=Robert Todd Carroll |chapter= Backwards satanic messages (backmasking) |title= The Skeptic's Dictionary |edition= online |date=December 28, 2006 |url=http://www.skepdic.com/backward.html |accessdate=2007-04-18| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070501094630/http://www.skepdic.com/backward.html| archivedate= May 1, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, S.

{{Evidence law}}
The '''burden of proof''' ({{lang-la|onus probandi}}) is the obligation of a [[party (law)|party]] in a [[trial]] to produce the [[evidence]] that will prove the claims they have made against the other party. In a legal dispute, one party is initially presumed to be correct and gets the benefit of the doubt, while the other side bears the burden of proof. When a party bearing the burden of proof meets its burden, the burden of proof switches to the other side. Burdens may be of different kinds for each party, in different phases of litigation. The [[Prima facie|burden of production]] is a minimal burden to produce at least enough evidence for the [[trier of fact]] to ''consider'' a disputed claim.&lt;ref name=CL&gt;''Criminal Law - Cases and Materials'', 7th ed. 2012, [[Wolters Kluwer Law &amp; Business]]; [[John Kaplan (law professor)|John Kaplan]], [[Robert Weisberg]], Guyora Binder, {{ISBN|978-1-4548-0698-1}}, [https://law.stanford.edu/publications/criminal-law-cases-and-materials-7th-edition/]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|16–17}} After litigants have met the burden of production and their claim is being considered by a trier of fact, they have the burden of persuasion, that enough evidence has been presented to persuade the trier of fact that their side is correct. There are different ''standards'' of persuasiveness ranging from a [[preponderance of the evidence]], where there is just enough evidence to tip the balance, to proof beyond a reasonable doubt, as in United States criminal courts.&lt;ref name="CL"/&gt;{{rp|17}}

The burden of proof is always on the person who brings a claim in a dispute. It is often associated with the Latin [[Maxim (philosophy)|maxim]] ''semper necessitas probandi incumbit ei qui agit'', a translation of which in this context is: "the necessity of proof always lies with the person who lays charges."&lt;ref&gt;Transnational principle of law: [http://www.trans-lex.org/966000 Trans-Lex.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

The party that does not carry the burden of proof carries the benefit of assumption of being correct, they are presumed to be correct, until the burden shifts after presentation of evidence by the party bringing the action. An example is in an American [[criminal case]], where there is a [[presumption of innocence]] by the [[defendant]]. Fulfilling the burden of proof effectively captures the benefit of assumption, passing the burden of proof off to another party.

==Definition==
The term "burden of proof" is used to mean two kinds of burdens: The burden of production (or the burden of "going forward with the evidence") and the burden of persuasion.&lt;ref&gt;Barron's Law Dictionary, pp. 55-56 (2nd ed. 1984); Black's Law Dictionary, p. 178 (5th ed. 1979).&lt;/ref&gt;

A "burden of persuasion" or "risk of nonpersuasion"&lt;ref&gt;Barron's Law Dictionary, p. 55 (2nd ed. 1984).&lt;/ref&gt; is an obligation that remains on a single party for the duration of the court proceeding.&lt;ref&gt;Black's Law Dictionary, p. 178 (5th ed. 1979).&lt;/ref&gt; Once the burden has been entirely discharged to the satisfaction of the [[trier of fact]], the party carrying the burden will succeed in its claim. For example, the [[presumption of innocence]] in a criminal case places a legal burden upon the prosecution to prove all elements of the offense (generally beyond a reasonable doubt), and to disprove all the defenses except for [[affirmative defense]]s in which the proof of non-existence of all affirmative defense(s) is not constitutionally required of the prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;''Patterson v. New York'', {{ussc|432|197|1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The burden of persuasion should not be confused with the [[evidential burden]], or burden of production, or duty of producing (or going forward with evidence)&lt;ref&gt;Barron's Law Dictionary, p. 56 (2nd ed. 1984).&lt;/ref&gt; which is an obligation that may shift between parties over the course of the hearing or trial. The evidential burden is the burden to adduce sufficient evidence to properly raise an issue at court.

==Standard of proof in the United States==
Burden of proof refers most generally to the obligation of a party to prove its allegations at trial. In a civil case, the plaintiff sets forth its allegations in a complaint, petition or other pleading. The defendant is then required to file a responsive pleading denying some or all of the allegations and setting forth any [[affirmative defenses|affirmative facts in defense]]. Each party has the burden of proof of its allegations.

===Legal standards for burden of proof===
====Some evidence====
Per ''{{w|Superintendent v. Hill}}'' (1985), in order to take away a prisoner's {{w|good conduct time}} for a disciplinary violation, prison officials need only have "some evidence," i.e., "a modicum of evidence".

Per ''{{w|Thompson v. City of Louisville}}'' (1960), the some evidence standard is required to overrule a jury's finding of guilt in criminal cases.

====Reasonable indications====
"Reasonable indication is substantially lower than probable cause; factors to consider are those facts and circumstances a prudent investigator would consider, but must include facts or circumstances indicating a past, current, or impending violation; an objective factual basis must be present, a mere 'hunch' is insufficient."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hirsch Ballin|first1=Marianne|title=Anticipative Criminal Investigation: Theory and Counterterrorism Practice in the Netherlands and the United States|date=Mar 6, 2012|page=525|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CGExJeGdVF0C&amp;lpg=PA524&amp;ots=Fe-QCWeGvn&amp;dq=%22reasonable%20indications%22%20crime&amp;pg=PA524#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reasonable indication standard is used in interpreting trade law in determining if the United States has been materially injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pak|first1=Nam|title=American Lamb Company v. United States: Application of the Reasonable Indication Standard|journal=Northwest Journal of International Law and Business|date=1988|url=http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/njilb/vol9/iss1/11|accessdate=9 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Reasonable suspicion====
{{Main|Reasonable suspicion}}
Reasonable suspicion is a low standard of proof to determine whether a ''brief'' investigative stop or search by a police officer or any government agent is warranted. It is important to note that this stop or search must be brief; its thoroughness is proportional to, and limited by, the low standard of evidence. A more definite standard of proof (often [[probable cause]]) would be required to justify a more thorough stop/search. In ''[[Terry v. Ohio]]'', {{ussc|392|1|1968}}, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruled that reasonable suspicion requires specific, articulable, and individualized suspicion that crime is afoot. A mere guess or "hunch" is not enough to constitute reasonable suspicion.

An investigatory stop is a seizure under the Fourth Amendment. The state must justify the seizure by showing that the officer conducting the stop had a reasonable articulable suspicion that criminal activity was afoot. The important point is that officers cannot deprive a citizen of liberty unless the officer can point to specific facts and circumstances and inferences therefrom that would amount to a reasonable suspicion. The officer must be prepared to establish that criminal activity was a logical explanation for what he perceived. The requirement serves to prevent officers from stopping individuals based merely on hunches or unfounded suspicions. The purpose of the stop and detention is to investigate to the extent necessary to confirm or dispel the original suspicion. If the initial confrontation with the person stopped dispels suspicion of criminal activity the officer must end the detention and allow the person to go about his or her business. If the investigation confirms the officer's initial suspicion or reveals evidence that would justify continued detention the officer may require the person detained to remain at the scene until further investigation is complete.

====Reasonable to believe====
In ''[[Arizona v. Gant]]'' (2009), the United States Supreme Court defined a new standard, that of "reasonable to believe." This standard applies only to vehicle searches after the suspect has been placed under arrest. The Court overruled ''[[New York v. Belton]]'' (1981) and concluded that police officers are allowed to go back and search a vehicle incident to a suspect's arrest only where it is "reasonable to believe" that there is more evidence in the vehicle of the crime for which the suspect was arrested.

There is still an ongoing debate as to the exact meaning of this phrase. Some courts have said it should be a new standard while others have equated it with the "reasonable suspicion" of the ''Terry'' stop. Most courts have agreed it is somewhere less than probable cause.

====Probable cause====
{{main|Probable cause}}
Probable cause is a relatively low standard of proof, which is used in the United States to determine whether a search, or an arrest, is warranted. It is also used by [[grand jury|grand juries]] to determine whether to issue an [[indictment]]. In the civil context, this standard is often used where plaintiffs are seeking a prejudgement [[remedy (law)|remedy]].

In the criminal context, the U.S. Supreme Court in ''United States v. Sokolow'', {{ussc|490|1|1989}}, determined that probable cause requires "a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found" in deciding whether [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] agents had a reason to execute a search. Courts vary when determining what constitutes a "fair probability": some{{Who|date=August 2012}} say 30%, others 40%, others 51%.

A good illustration of this evidence/intrusiveness continuum might be a typical police/citizen interaction. Consider the following three interactions:
* '''no level of suspicion required''': a consensual encounter between officer and citizen
* '''reasonable suspicion required''': a stop initiated by the officer that would cause a reasonable person not to feel free to leave
* '''probable cause required''': arrest.

====Some credible evidence====
One of the least reliable standards of proof, this assessment is often used in administrative law, and often in [[Child Protective Services]] (CPS) proceedings in some states. The "some credible evidence" standard is used as a legal placeholder to bring some controversy before a trier of fact, and into a legal process. It is on the order of the factual standard of proof needed to achieve a finding of "probable cause" used in ex parte threshold determinations needed before a court will issue a search warrant. It is a lower standard of proof than the "preponderance of the evidence" standard. The standard does not require the fact-finder to weigh conflicting evidence, and merely requires the investigator or prosecutor to present the bare minimum of material credible evidence to support the allegations against the subject, or in support of the allegation; see ''Valmonte v. Bane,'' 18 F.3d 992 (2nd Cir. 1994). In some Federal Appellate Circuit Courts, such as the Second Circuit, the "some credible evidence" standard has been found constitutionally insufficient to protect liberty interests of the parties in controversy at CPS hearings.

====Substantial evidence====
In some appeals from decisions of [[administrative agencies]], the courts apply a "substantial evidence" [[standard of review]] of the agency's factual findings. In the United States, for example, if a [[Social Security Disability Insurance]] claimant is found "not disabled" (and, therefore, ineligible for benefits) by an [[administrative law judge|Administrative Law Judge (ALJ)]] and the claimant appeals, both the Appeals Council (the body within the [[Social Security Administration]] that hears appeals from decisions of ALJs) and the [[United States Federal courts|Federal courts]] (which, in this type of case, will normally hear an appeal only after the claimant has [[exhaustion of remedies|exhausted all administrative remedies]]) will look to see whether the administrative law judge's decision was supported by "substantial evidence" or not. Substantial evidence is "more than a mere scintilla. It means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion."&lt;ref&gt;''See'' ''[[Richardson v. Perales]]'', [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10758399444677950472&amp;q=%22substantial+evidence%22&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,9 402 U.S. 389, 401] (1971), ''quoting from'' ''[[Consolidated Edison Co. v. NLRB]]'', 305 U. S. 197, 229 (1938).&lt;/ref&gt;

This applies to other court decisions. The trier of fact's decision cannot be baseless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courts.ca.gov/12431.htm|website=California Courts|accessdate=10 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===={{vanchor|Preponderance of the evidence}}====
Preponderance of the evidence, also known as '''balance of probabilities''', is the standard required in most [[Civil law (common law)|civil]] cases and in [[family court]] determinations solely involving money, such as [[child support]] under the [[Child Support Standards Act]]. It is also the burden of proof of which the defendant must prove [[affirmative defenses]] or  [[mitigating circumstances]] in civil or criminal court. In civil court, [[aggravating circumstances]] also only have to be proven by a preponderance of the evidence, as opposed to beyond reasonable doubt (as they do in criminal court).

The standard is met if the proposition is [[Probability|more likely]] to be true than not true. The standard is satisfied if there is greater than fifty percent chance that the proposition is true. [[Tom Denning, Baron Denning|Lord Denning]], in ''Miller v. Minister of Pensions'',&lt;ref&gt;''Miller v. Minister of Pensions'' [1947] 2 All ER 372&lt;/ref&gt; described it simply as "more probable than not." Until 1970, this was also the standard used in juvenile court in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;In re Winship, 397 U.S. 358, 90 S.Ct. 1068 (1970)&lt;/ref&gt;

This is also the standard of proof used when determining eligibility of unemployment benefits for a former employee accused of losing the job through alleged misconduct. In most US states, the employer must prove this case with a preponderance of evidence.

Preponderance of the evidence is the standard of proof used for immunity from prosecution under Florida's controversial [[stand-your-ground law]]. The defense must present its evidence in a pre-trial hearing, show that the statutory prerequisites have been met, and then request that the court grant a motion for declaration of immunity. The judge must then decide from the preponderance of the evidence whether to grant immunity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.husseinandwebber.com/stand_your_ground.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104224306/http://www.husseinandwebber.com/stand_your_ground.html |archivedate=2013-11-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a far lower burden than "beyond a reasonable doubt," the threshold a prosecutor must meet at any proceeding criminal trial,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/publicsafety/crime/florida-stand-your-ground-law-yields-some-shocking-outcomes-depending-on/1233133|title=Florida 'stand your ground' law yields some shocking outcomes depending on how law is applied|work=Tampa Bay Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; but higher than the "probable cause" threshold generally required for [[indictment]].

====Clear and convincing evidence====
Clear and convincing evidence is a higher level of burden of persuasion than "preponderance of the evidence". It is employed intra-adjudicatively in administrative court determinations, as well as in [[civil procedure|civil]] and certain [[criminal procedure]] in the United States. For example, a prisoner seeking ''[[habeas corpus]]'' relief from [[Capital punishment in the United States|capital punishment]] must prove his factual innocence by clear and convincing evidence.&lt;ref&gt;''Calderon v. Thompson'', {{ussc|523|538|1998}}. The petitioner, Thomas M. Thompson, a convicted rapist/murderer, was executed on July 14, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

This standard is used in many types of [[Equity (law)|equity]] cases, including [[paternity (law)|paternity]], [[persons in need of supervision]], [[juvenile delinquency]], [[child custody]], the [[probate]] of both wills and [[living wills]], petitions to remove a person from [[life support]] ("[[right to die]]" cases),&lt;ref&gt;See, ''[[Quinlan case#Legal battle|Quinlan v. New Jersey]]'', and ''[[Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Department of Health]]'', 497 U.S. 261 (1990).&lt;/ref&gt; and many similar cases.

Clear and convincing proof means that the evidence presented by a party during the trial must be highly and substantially more probable to be true than not and the trier of fact must have a firm belief or conviction in its factuality. In this standard, a greater degree of believability must be met than the common standard of proof in civil actions, which only requires that the facts as a threshold be more likely than not to prove the issue for which they are asserted.

This standard is also known as "clear, convincing, and satisfactory evidence"; "clear, cognizant, and convincing evidence"; and "clear, unequivocal, satisfactory, and convincing evidence", and is applied in cases or situations involving an equitable remedy or where a presumptive civil liberty interest exists.

====Beyond reasonable doubt====
{{main|Reasonable doubt}}

This is the highest standard used as the burden of proof in Anglo-American jurisprudence and typically only applies in criminal proceedings and when considering [[aggravating circumstances]] in criminal proceedings. It has been described, in negative terms, as a proof having been met if there is no plausible reason to believe otherwise. If there is a real doubt, based upon reason and common sense after careful and impartial consideration of all the evidence, or lack of evidence, in a case, then the level of proof has not been met.

Proof beyond a reasonable doubt, therefore, is proof of such a convincing character that one would be willing to rely and act upon it without hesitation in the most important of one's own affairs. However, it does not mean an absolute certainty. The standard that must be met by the prosecution's evidence in a criminal prosecution is that no other logical explanation can be derived from the facts except that the defendant committed the crime, thereby overcoming the presumption that a person is innocent unless and until proven guilty.

If the trier of fact has no doubt as to the defendant's guilt, or if their only doubts are unreasonable doubts, then the prosecutor has proved the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and the defendant should be pronounced guilty.

The term connotes that evidence establishes a particular point to a moral certainty which precludes the existence of any reasonable alternatives. It does not mean that no doubt exists as to the accused's guilt, but only that no ''reasonable'' doubt is possible from the evidence presented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|55|1971|litigants=Green v The Queen |parallelcite=(1971) 126 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 28 at p. 33 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Further to this notion of moral certainty, where the trier of fact relies on proof that is solely circumstantial, ''i.e.'', when conviction is based entirely on [[circumstantial evidence]], certain jurisdictions specifically require the prosecution's burden of proof to be such that the facts proved must exclude to a moral certainty every reasonable hypothesis or inference other than guilt.

The main reason that this high level of proof is demanded in criminal trials is that such proceedings can result in the deprivation of a defendant's liberty or even in his or her death. These outcomes are far more severe than in civil trials, in which monetary damages are the common remedy.

Another noncriminal instance in which proof beyond a reasonable doubt is applied is [[Conservatorship|LPS conservatorship]].

==Standard of proof in the United Kingdom==
In the three jurisdictions of the UK (Northern Ireland; England &amp; Wales; and Scotland) there are only two standards of proof in trials. (There are others which are defined in statutes, such as those relating to police powers.)

The criminal standard was formerly described as "beyond reasonable doubt". That standard remains, and the words commonly used, though the Judicial Studies Board guidance is that juries might be assisted by being told that to convict they must be persuaded "so that you are sure".

The civil standard is 'the balance of probabilities', often referred to in judgments as "more likely than not".

The civil standard is also used in criminal trials in relation to those defences which must be proven by the defendant (for example, the statutory defence to [[Driving under the influence#United Kingdom|drunk in charge]] that there was no likelihood of the accused driving while still over the alcohol limit&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/52/section/5 s.5 Road Traffic Act 1988]; see [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldjudgmt/jd041014/gen4-1.htm R. vs Sheldrake])&lt;/ref&gt;). However, where the law does not stipulate a reverse burden of proof, the defendant need only raise the issue and it is then for the prosecution to negate the defence to the criminal standard in the usual way (for example, that of self-defence&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/s_to_u/self_defence/#Burden_of_Proof|title=Self-Defence and the Prevention of Crime - The Crown Prosecution Service|author=|date=|website=www.cps.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Prior to the decision of the House of Lords in ''Re B (A Child)'' [2008] UKHL 35&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldjudgmt/jd080611/child-1.htm|title=House of Lords -   In Re B (Children) (Fc)    Appellate Committee    Lord Hoffmann  Lord Scott of Foscote  Lord R|work=parliament.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; there had been some confusion – even at the Court of Appeal – as to whether there was some intermediate standard, described as the 'heightened standard'. The House of Lords found that there was not. As the above description of the American system shows, anxiety by judges to make decisions on very serious matters on the basis of the balance of probabilities had led to a departure from the common law principles of just two standards. [[Baroness Hale]] said:

{{quote|70. ... Neither the seriousness of the allegation nor the seriousness of the consequences should make any difference to the standard of proof to be applied in determining the facts. The inherent probabilities are simply something to be taken into account, where relevant, in deciding where the truth lies.

72. ... there is no logical or necessary connection between seriousness and probability. Some seriously harmful behaviour, such as murder, is sufficiently rare to be inherently improbable in most circumstances. Even then there are circumstances, such as a body with its throat cut and no weapon to hand, where it is not at all improbable. Other seriously harmful behaviour, such as alcohol or drug abuse, is regrettably all too common and not at all improbable. Nor are serious allegations made in a vacuum. Consider the famous example of the animal seen in Regent’s Park. If it is seen outside the zoo on a stretch of greensward regularly used for walking dogs, then of course it is more likely to be a dog than a lion. If it is seen in the zoo next to the lions’ enclosure when the door is open, then it may well be more likely to be a lion than a dog.}}

The task for the tribunal then when faced with serious allegations is to recognise that their seriousness generally means they are inherently unlikely, such that to be satisfied that a fact is more likely than not the evidence must be of a good quality. But the standard of proof remains 'the balance of probabilities'.

==Other standards for presenting cases or defenses==

===Air of reality===
&lt;!-- [[Air of reality]] redirects here --&gt;
{{see also|R v Cinous}}

The "air of reality" is a standard of proof used in [[Canada]] to determine whether a criminal defense may be used. The test asks whether a defense can be successful if it is assumed that all the claimed facts are to be true. In most cases, the burden of proof rests solely on the prosecution, negating the need for a defense of this kind. However, when exceptions arise and the burden of proof has been shifted to the defendant, they are required to establish a defense that bears an "air of reality." Two instances in which such a case might arise are, first, when a ''[[prima facie#Burden of proof|prima facie]]'' case has been made against the defendant or, second, when the defense mounts an [[affirmative defense]], such as the [[insanity defense]].

===Evidentiary standards of proof===
Depending on the legal venue or intra-case hearing, varying levels of reliability of proof are considered dispositive of the inquiry being entertained. If the subject threshold level of reliability has been met by the presentation of the evidence, then the thing is considered legally proved for that trial, hearing or inquest.  For example, in California, several evidentiary presumptions are codified, including a presumption that the owner of legal title is the beneficial owner (rebuttable only by clear and convincing evidence).&lt;ref&gt;Cal. Evid. Code Section 662, available at http://legalmasters.net/practices/real-estate-law/commonly-referenced-real-estate-statutes-and-regulations/california-evidence-code-sections-660-668/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

===Criminal law===
In the [[Western world|West]], [[criminal law|criminal]] cases usually place the burden of proof on the [[prosecutor]] (expressed in the [[List of legal Latin terms|Latin]] [[Brocard (law)|brocard]] '''''[[ei incumbit probatio qui dicit]], non qui negat''''', "the burden of proof rests on who asserts, not on who denies"). This principle is known as the [[presumption of innocence]], and is summed up with "innocent until proven guilty," but is not upheld in all legal systems or [[jurisdiction]]s. Where it is upheld, the accused will be found not guilty if this burden of proof is not sufficiently shown by the prosecution.
&lt;ref name=Bailii&gt;{{cite web|title=Woolmington v DPP [1935] UKHL 1|url=http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/markup.cgi?doc=/uk/cases/UKHL/1935/1.html&amp;query=woolmington&amp;method=boolean}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The presumption of innocence means three things:
* With respect to the critical facts of a case the defendant has no burden of proof whatsoever.&lt;ref&gt;The critical facts of a criminal case are whether the crime charged was committed and whether the defendant is criminally responsible for the commission of the crime.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The state must prove the critical facts of the case to the appropriate level of certainty.
* The jury is not to draw any inferences adverse to the defendant from the fact that he has been charged with a crime and is present in court facing the charges against him.

For example, if the defendant (D) is charged with murder, the prosecutor (P) bears the burden of proof to show the jury that D did indeed murder someone.
* Burden of proof: P
** Burden of production: P has to show some evidence that D had committed murder. The United States Supreme Court has ruled that the Constitution requires enough evidence to justify a rational trier of fact to find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. If the judge rules that such burden has been met, then it is up to the jury itself to decide if they are, in fact, convinced of guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.&lt;ref&gt;''Jackson v. Virginia'', {{ussc|443|307|1979}}.&lt;/ref&gt; If the judge finds there is not enough evidence under the standard, the case must be dismissed (or a subsequent guilty verdict must be vacated and the charges dismissed).
*** e.g. [[witness]], [[forensic evidence]], [[autopsy]] report
*** Failure to meet the burden: the issue will be decided as a matter of law. In this case, D is presumed innocent
** Burden of persuasion: if at the close of evidence, the jury cannot decide if P has established with relevant level of certainty that D had committed murder, the jury must find D not guilty of the crime of murder
*** Measure of proof: P has to prove every element of the offence beyond a reasonable doubt, but not necessarily prove every single fact beyond a reasonable doubt.

However, in [[England and Wales]], the [[Magistrates' Courts Act 1980]], s.101 stipulates that where a defendant relies on some "exception, exemption, proviso, excuse or qualification" in his defence, the legal burden of proof as to that exception falls on the defendant, though only on the balance of probabilities. For example, a person charged with being [[drunk in charge]] of a motor vehicle can raise the defence that there was no likelihood of his driving while drunk.&lt;ref&gt;Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988, s.5(2)&lt;/ref&gt; The prosecution has the legal burden of proof beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant exceeded the legal limit of alcohol and was in control of a motor vehicle. Possession of the keys is usually sufficient to prove control, even if the defendant is not in the vehicle and is perhaps in a nearby bar. That being proved, the defendant has the legal burden of proof on the balance of probabilities that he was not likely to drive.&lt;ref name="herring"&gt;{{cite book |author=Herring, J. |year=2004 |title=Criminal Law: Text, Cases, and Materials |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-876578-9 |pages=58–64 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, such practice in England and Wales was challenged as contrary to the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] (ECHR), art.6(2) guaranteeing right to a fair trial. The [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] held that:&lt;ref name="herring" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''R v. DPP, Ex Parte Kebeline'' [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1999/43.html &lt;nowiki&gt;[1999]&lt;/nowiki&gt; UKHL 43]&lt;/ref&gt;
* A mere evidential burden did not contravene art.6(2);
* A legal / persuasive burden did not necessarily contravene art.6(2) so long as confined within reasonable limits, considering the questions:
** ''What must the prosecution prove to transfer burden to the defendant?''
** ''Is the defendant required to prove something difficult or easily within his access?''
** ''What threat to society is the provision designed to combat?''

In some cases, there is a [[reverse onus]] on the accused.  A typical example is that of a [[Hit and run#Canada|hit-and-run]] charge prosecuted under the Canadian [[Criminal Code (Canada)|''Criminal Code'']].  The defendant is presumed to have fled the scene of a crash, to avoid civil or criminal liability, if the prosecution can prove the remaining essential elements of the offence.

===Civil law===
In [[Civil law (common law)|civil law]] cases, the "burden of proof" requires the plaintiff to convince the trier of fact (whether judge or jury) of the plaintiff's entitlement to the relief sought.  This means that the plaintiff must prove each element of the claim, or cause of action, in order to recover. However, in cases of proving loss of future earning capacity, the plaintiff must prove there is a real or substantial possibility of such a loss occurring.

===Civil cases of the U.S. Supreme Court===
In ''Keyes v. Sch. Dist. No. 1'', {{ussc|413|189|1973}}, the [[United States Supreme Court]] stated: "There are no hard-and-fast standards governing the allocation of the burden of proof in every situation. The issue, rather, 'is merely a question of policy and fairness based on experience in the different situations.'" For support, the Court cited 9 John H. Wigmore, Evidence § 2486, at 275 (3d ed. 1940). In ''Keyes'', the Supreme Court held that if "school authorities have been found to have practised purposeful segregation in part of a school system," the burden of persuasion shifts to the school to prove that it did not engage in such discrimination in other segregated schools in the same system.

In ''Director, Office of Workers' Compensation Programs v. Greenwich Collieries'', {{ussc|512|267|1994}}, the Supreme Court explained that ''burden of proof'' is ambiguous because it has historically referred to two distinct burdens:  the ''burden of persuasion'', and the ''burden of production''.

The Supreme Court discussed how courts should allocate the burden of proof (i.e., the burden of persuasion) in ''Schaffer ex rel. Schaffer v. Weast'', {{ussc|546|49|2005}}. The Supreme Court explained that if a statute is silent about the burden of persuasion, the court will "begin with the ordinary default rule that plaintiffs bear the risk of failing to prove their claims." In support of this proposition, the Court cited 2 J. Strong, McCormick on Evidence § 337, 412 (5th ed. 1999), which states:

{{quote|The burdens of pleading and proof with regard to most facts have been and should be assigned to the plaintiff who generally seeks to change the present state of affairs and who therefore naturally should be expected to bear the risk of failure of proof or persuasion.}}

At the same time, the Supreme Court also recognized "The ordinary default rule, of course, admits of exceptions. ... For example, the burden of persuasion as to certain elements of a plaintiff's claim may be shifted to defendants, when such elements can fairly be characterized as affirmative defenses or exemptions. See, e.g., ''FTC v. Morton Salt Co.'', 334 U.S. 37, 44-45 (1948). Under some circumstances this Court has even placed the burden of persuasion over an entire claim on the defendant. See ''Alaska Dept. of Environmental Conservation v. EPA'', {{ussc|540|461|2004}}." Nonetheless, "[a]bsent some reason to believe that Congress intended otherwise, therefore, [the Supreme Court] will conclude that the burden of persuasion lies where it usually falls, upon the party seeking relief."{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

In [[biology]], '''cell theory''' is the historic [[scientific theory]], now universally accepted, that living organisms are made up of [[Cell (biology)|cell]]s, that they are the basic structural/organizational unit of all organisms, and that all cells come from pre-existing cells. Cells are the basic unit of structure in all organisms and also the basic unit of reproduction. With continual improvements made to [[microscope]]s over time, magnification technology advanced enough to discover cells in the 17th century. This discovery is largely attributed to [[Robert Hooke]], and began the scientific study of cells, also known as [[cell biology]]. Over a century later, many debates about cells began amongst scientists. Most of these debates involved the nature of cellular regeneration, and the idea of cells as a fundamental unit of life. Cell theory was eventually formulated in 1839. This is usually credited to [[Matthias Schleiden]] and [[Theodor Schwann]]. However, many other scientists like [[Rudolf Virchow]] contributed to the theory. It was an important step in the movement away from [[spontaneous generation]].

The three [[:wikt:tenet|tenet]]s to the cell theory are as described below:
# All living organisms are composed of one or more cells.
# The cell is the basic unit of structure and organization in organisms.
# Cells arise from pre-existing cells.

The first of these tenets is disputed, as [[non-cellular life|non-cellular entities]] such as viruses are sometimes considered life-forms.&lt;ref&gt;Villarreal, Luis P. (August 8, 2008) [http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/are-viruses-alive-2004/ Are Viruses Alive?] ''Scientific American''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Microscopes==

[[File:Leeuwenhoek Microscope.png|thumb|Anton van Leeuwenhoek's microscope from the 17th century with a magnification of 300x.

[[File:Hooke-microscope.png|thumb|Robert Hooke's microscope]]
The discovery of the cell was made possible through the invention of the microscope. In the first century BC, Romans were able to make glass, discovering that objects appeared to be larger under the [[glass]]. In Italy during the 12th century, Salvino D’Armate made a piece of glass fit over one eye, allowing for a magnification effect to that eye. The expanded use of lenses in [[eyeglasses]] in the 13th century probably led to wider spread use of [[Optical microscope#Simple microscope|simple microscope]]s ([[magnifying glass]]es) with limited magnification.&lt;ref&gt;Atti Della Fondazione Giorgio Ronchi E Contributi Dell'Istituto Nazionale Di Ottica, Volume 30, La Fondazione-1975, page 554&lt;/ref&gt; [[Optical microscope#Compound microscope|Compound microscope]], which combine an [[Objective (optics)|objective lens]] with an [[eyepiece]] to view a [[real image]] achieving much higher magnification, first appeared in Europe around 1620&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Albert Van Helden|author2=Sven Dupré|author3=Rob van Gent|title=The Origins of the Telescope|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XguxYlYd-9EC&amp;pg=PA24|year=2010|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|isbn=978-90-6984-615-6|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Rosenthal, Spectacles and Other Vision Aids: A History and Guide to Collecting, Norman Publishing, 1996, page 391 - 392&lt;/ref&gt; In 1665, Robert Hooke used a microscope about six inches long with two convex lenses inside and examined specimens under reflected light for the observations in his book ''[[Micrographia]]''. Hooke also used a simpler microscope with a single lens for examining specimens with directly transmitted light, because this allowed for a clearer image.&lt;ref name=Gest /&gt;

Extensive microscopic study was done by [[Anton van Leeuwenhoek]], a draper who took the interest in microscopes after seeing one while on an apprenticeship in Amsterdam in 1648. At some point in his life before 1668, he was able to learn how to grind lenses.  This eventually led to Leeuwenhoek making his own unique microscope. His were a single lens simple microscope, rather than a [[compound microscope]]. This was because he was able to use a single lens that was a small glass sphere but allowed for a magnification of 270x. This was a large progression since the magnification before was only a maximum of 50x. After Leeuwenhoek, there was not much progress for the microscopes until the 1850s, two hundred years later. [[Carl Zeiss]], a German engineer who manufactured microscopes, began to make changes to the lenses used. But the optical quality did not improve until the 1880s when he hired [[Otto Schott]] and eventually [[Ernst Abbe]].&lt;ref name="Unifying Concept"/&gt;

Optical microscopes can focus on objects the size of a [[wavelength]] or larger, giving restrictions still to advancement in discoveries with objects smaller than the wavelengths of [[visible light]]. Later in the 1920s, the [[electron microscope]] was developed, making it possible to view objects that are smaller than optical wavelengths, once again, changing the possibilities in science.&lt;ref name="Unifying Concept" /&gt;

== Discovery of cells ==
[[File:Cork Micrographia Hooke.png|thumb|Drawing of the structure of [[Cork cambium|cork]] by [[Robert Hooke]] that appeared in ''[[Micrographia]]''.]]

The cell was first discovered by [[Robert Hooke]] in 1665, which can be found to be described in his book [[Micrographia]]. In this book, he gave 60 ‘observations’ in detail of various objects under a coarse, compound microscope.&lt;ref name=Gest&gt;{{Cite journal

This came from the Latin word Cella, meaning ‘a small room’ like monks lived in and also Cellulae, which meant the six sided cell of a honeycomb. However, Hooke did not know their real structure or function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Inwood, Stephen |title=The man who knew too much: the strange and inventive life of Robert Hooke, 1635–1703 |publisher=Pan |location=London |year=2003 |page=72 |isbn=0-330-48829-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
What Hooke had thought were cells, were actually empty cell walls of plant tissues. With microscopes during this time having a low magnification, Hooke was unable to see that there were other internal components to the cells he was observing. Therefore, he did not think the "cellulae" were alive.&lt;ref name="Becker, Wayne M.; Kleinsmith, Lewis J. and Hardin, Jeff 2003 1"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Becker, Wayne M. |author2=Kleinsmith, Lewis J. |author3=Hardin, Jeff |page=1|title=The World of the Cell|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UA8OAAAACAAJ|year=2003|publisher=Benjamin/Cummings Publishing Company|isbn=978-0-8053-4854-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; His cell observations gave no indication of the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] and other [[organelle]]s found in most living cells. In Micrographia, Hooke also observed mould, bluish in color, found on leather. After studying it under his microscope, he was unable to observe “seeds” that would have indicated how the mould was multiplying in quantity. This led to Hooke suggesting that spontaneous generation, from either natural or artificial heat, was the cause. Since this was an old [[Aristotelian physics|Aristotelian theory]] still accepted at the time, others did not reject it and was not disproved until [[Anton van Leeuwenhoek|Leeuwenhoek]] later discovers generation is achieved otherwise.&lt;ref name=Gest /&gt;

[[Anton van Leeuwenhoek]] is another scientist who saw these cells soon after Hooke did. He made use of a microscope containing improved lenses that could magnify objects almost 300-fold, or 270x.&lt;ref name="Becker, Wayne M.; Kleinsmith, Lewis J. and Hardin, Jeff 2003 1"/&gt; Under these microscopes, Leeuwenhoek found motile objects. In a letter to [[The Royal Society]] on October 9, 1676, he states that [[motility]] is a quality of life therefore these were living organisms. Over time, he wrote many more papers in which described many specific forms of [[microorganisms]]. Leeuwenhoek named these “animalcules,” which included [[protozoa]] and other unicellular organisms, like [[bacteria]].&lt;ref name="Unifying Concept" /&gt; Though he did not have much formal education, he was able to identify the first accurate description of red blood cells and discovered bacteria after gaining interest in the sense of taste that resulted in Leeuwenhoek to observe the tongue of an ox, then leading him to study "pepper water" in 1676. He also found for the first time the [[sperm cells]] of animals and humans. Once discovering these types of cells, Leeuwenhoek saw that the fertilization process requires the sperm cell to enter the [[egg cell]]. This put an end to the previous theory of [[spontaneous generation]]. After reading letters by Leeuwenhoek, Hooke was the first to confirm his observations that were thought to be unlikely by other contemporaries.&lt;ref name=Gest /&gt;

The cells in animal tissues were observed after plants were because the [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]] were so fragile and susceptible to tearing, it was difficult for such thin slices to be prepared for studying. Biologists believed that there was a fundamental unit to life, but were unsure what this was. It would not be until over a hundred years later that this fundamental unit was connected to cellular structure and existence of cells in animals or plants.&lt;ref name="History of Biology"&gt;{{cite web|last=Robinson|first=Richard|title=History of Biology: Cell Theory and Cell Structure|url=http://www.biologyreference.com/Gr-Hi/History-of-Biology-Cell-Theory-and-Cell-Structure.html#b|publisher=Advameg, Inc.|accessdate=17 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This conclusion was not made until [[Henri Dutrochet]]. Besides stating “the cell is the fundamental element of organization”,&lt;ref&gt;Dutrochet, Henri (1824) [https://books.google.com/books?id=KwQOAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA166,M1 "Recherches anatomiques et physiologiques sur la structure intime des animaux et des vegetaux, et sur leur motilite, par M.H. Dutrochet, avec deux planches"]&lt;/ref&gt; Dutrochet also claimed that cells were not just a structural unit, but also a physiological unit.

In 1804, [[Karl Rudolphi]] and [[Johann Heinrich Friedrich Link|J.H.F. Link]] were awarded the prize for "solving the problem of the nature of cells", meaning they were the first to prove that cells had independent [[cell walls]] by the [[University of Göttingen|Königliche Societät der Wissenschaft]] (Royal Society of Science), Göttingen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mathnat.uni-rostock.de/geschichte/kalenderblatt/kalenderblatt-dezember-2013/ Kalenderblatt Dezember 2013 – Mathematisch-Naturwissenschaftliche Fakultät – Universität Rostock]. Mathnat.uni-rostock.de (2013-11-28). Retrieved on 2015-10-15.&lt;/ref&gt; Before, it had been thought that cells shared walls and the fluid passed between them this way.

[[File:PSM V22 D156 Matthias Jacob Schleiden.jpg|thumb|PSM V22 D156 Matthias Jacob Schleiden| [[Matthias Jakob Schleiden]] (1804–1881)]]
[[File:Schwann Theodore.jpg|thumb|Schwann Theodore| [[Theodor Schwann]] (1810–1882)]]
Credit for developing cell theory is usually given to two scientists: [[Theodor Schwann]] and [[Matthias Jakob Schleiden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sharp |first=L. W. |year=1921 |url=https://archive.org/details/introductiontocy032473mbp |title=Introduction To Cytology |location=New York |publisher=McGraw Hill Book Company Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; While [[Rudolf Virchow]] contributed to the theory, he is not as credited for his attributions toward it. In 1839, Schleiden suggested that every structural part of a plant was made up of cells or the result of cells. He also suggested that cells were made by a crystallization process either within other cells or from the outside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Schleiden, M. J. |year=1839|title= Beiträge zur Phytogenesis|journal=Archiv für Anatomie, Physiologie und wissenschaftliche Medicin|pages=137–176|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/49861#page/347/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this was not an original idea of Schleiden. He claimed this theory as his own, though [[Barthelemy Charles Joseph Dumortier|Barthelemy Dumortier]] had stated it years before him. This crystallization process is no longer accepted with [[#Modern interpretation|modern cell theory]]. In 1839, [[Theodor Schwann]] states that along with plants, animals are composed of cells or the product of cells in their structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Schwann, T. |year=1839|title=Mikroskopische Untersuchungen über die Uebereinstimmung in der Struktur und dem Wachsthum der Thiere und Pflanzen|publisher=Sander|place= Berlin|url=http://www.deutschestextarchiv.de/book/show/schwann_mikroskopische_1839}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a major advancement in the field of biology since little was known about animal structure up to this point compared to plants. From these conclusions about plants and animals, two of the three tenets of cell theory were postulated.&lt;ref name="History of Biology" /&gt;

1. All living organisms are composed of one or more cells

2. The cell is the most basic unit of life

Schleiden's theory of free cell formation through crystallization was refuted in the 1850s by [[Robert Remak]], [[Rudolf Virchow]], and [[Albert Kolliker]].&lt;ref name="Unifying Concept"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1038/8964| pmid = 10559875| year = 1999| last1 = Mazzarello| first1 = P.| journal = Nature Cell Biology| volume = 1| issue = 1| url = http://newburyparkhighschool.net/barra/classes/bio_cp/handout_cell%20theory%20reading_students.doc| pages = E13–5| title = A unifying concept: the history of cell theory| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150603062810/http://newburyparkhighschool.net/barra/classes/bio_cp/handout_cell%20theory%20reading_students.doc| archivedate = 2015-06-03| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1855, Rudolf Virchow added the third tenet to cell theory. In Latin, this tenet states ''Omnis cellula e cellula''.&lt;ref name="History of Biology" /&gt;  This translated to:

3. All cells arise only from pre-existing cells

However, the idea that all cells come from pre-existing cells had in fact already been proposed by Robert Remak; it has been suggested that Virchow plagiarized Remak and did not give him credit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Silver|year=1987|title=Virchow, the heroic model in medicine: health policy by accolade|journal=[[American Journal of Public Health]]|volume=77|issue=1|pmid=3538915|pmc=1646803|doi=10.2105/AJPH.77.1.82|first1=GA|pages=82–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Remak published observations in 1852 on cell division, claiming Schleiden and Schawnn were incorrect about generation schemes. He instead said that [[binary fission]], which was first introduced by Dumortier, was how reproduction of new animal cells were made. Once this tenet was added, the classical cell theory was complete.

== Modern interpretation ==
The generally accepted parts of modern cell theory include:

# All known living things are made up of one or more cells&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe&lt;/ref&gt;
# All living cells arise from pre-existing cells by division. 
# The cell is the fundamental unit of structure and function in all living organisms.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;
# The activity of an organism depends on the total activity of independent cells.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}
# Energy flow ([[metabolism]] and [[biochemistry]]) occurs within cells.&lt;ref name="modern Cell Theory" /&gt;
# Cells contain [[DNA]] which is found specifically in the chromosome and [[RNA]] found in the cell nucleus and cytoplasm.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;
# All cells are basically the same in chemical composition in organisms of similar species.&lt;ref name="modern Cell Theory" /&gt;

== Modern version ==
The modern version of the cell theory includes the ideas that:
*Energy flow occurs within cells.&lt;ref name="modern Cell Theory"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://biology.about.com/od/biologydictionary/g/celltheory.htm | title=The modern version of the Cell Theory | accessdate=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Heredity information ([[DNA]]) is passed on from cell to cell.&lt;ref name="modern Cell Theory" /&gt;
*All cells have the same basic chemical composition.&lt;ref name="modern Cell Theory" /&gt;

== Opposing concepts in cell theory: history and background ==

The cell was  first discovered by Robert Hooke in 1665 using a microscope. The first cell theory is credited to the work of [[Theodor Schwann]] and [[Matthias Jakob Schleiden]] in the 1830s. In this theory the internal contents of cells were called [[protoplasm]] and described as a jelly-like substance, sometimes called living jelly. At about the same time, [[colloidal chemistry]] began its development, and the concepts of [[bound water]] emerged. A [[colloid]] being something between a [[solution]] and a [[Suspension (chemistry)|suspension]], where [[Brownian motion]] is sufficient to prevent [[sedimentation]].
The idea of a [[semipermeable membrane]], a barrier that is permeable to [[solvent]] but impermeable to solute [[molecules]] was developed at about the same time. The term [[osmosis]] originated in 1827 and its importance to [[physiological]] phenomena realized, but it wasn’t until 1877, when the [[botanist]] [[Pfeffer]] proposed the [[History of cell membrane theory|membrane theory]] of [[cell physiology]]. In this view, the cell was seen to be enclosed by a thin surface, the [[plasma membrane]], and cell water and solutes such as a [[potassium]] [[ion]] existed in a physical state like that of a [[dilute solution]]. In 1889 Hamburger used [[hemolysis]] of [[erythrocytes]] to determine the permeability of various solutes. By measuring the time required for the cells to swell past their elastic limit, the rate at which solutes entered the cells could be estimated by the accompanying change in cell volume. He also found that there was an apparent nonsolvent volume of about 50% in red blood cells and later showed that this includes water of hydration in addition to the protein and other nonsolvent components of the cells.

===Evolution of the membrane and bulk phase theories===

Two opposing concepts developed within the context of studies on [[osmosis]], permeability, and electrical properties of cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ling|first=Gilbert N.|title=In search of the physical basis of life|date=1984|publisher=Plenum Press|location=New York|isbn=0306414090}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first held that these properties all belonged to the plasma membrane whereas the other predominant view was that the [[protoplasm]] was responsible for these properties.
The [[History of cell membrane theory|membrane theory]] developed as a succession of ad-hoc additions and changes to the theory to overcome experimental hurdles. Overton (a distant cousin of Charles Darwin) first proposed the concept of a lipid (oil) plasma membrane in 1899. The major weakness of the [[lipid membrane]] was the lack of an explanation of the high permeability to water, so Nathansohn (1904) proposed the mosaic theory. In this view, the membrane is not a pure lipid layer, but a mosaic of areas with lipid and areas with semipermeable gel. Ruhland refined the mosaic theory to include pores to allow additional passage of small molecules. Since membranes are generally less permeable to [[anions]], [[Leonor Michaelis]] concluded that [[ions]] are [[adsorbed]] to the walls of the pores, changing the permeability of the pores to ions by [[electrostatic repulsion]]. Michaelis demonstrated the [[membrane potential]] (1926) and proposed that it was related to the distribution of ions across the membrane.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Michaelis|first1=L.|title=Contribution to the Theory of Permeability of Membranes for Electrolytes|journal=The Journal of General Physiology|volume=8|issue=2 |pages=33–59|year=1925|pmid=19872189|pmc=2140746|doi=10.1085/jgp.8.2.33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harvey and Danielli (1939) proposed a [[lipid bilayer]] membrane covered on each side with a layer of protein to account for measurements of surface tension. In 1941 Boyle &amp; Conway showed that the membrane of frog muscle was permeable to both {{chem|K|+}} and {{chem|Cl|-}}, but apparently not to {{chem|Na|+}}, so the idea of electrical charges in the pores was unnecessary since a single critical pore size would explain the permeability to {{chem|K|+}}, {{chem|H|+}}, and {{chem|Cl|-}} as well as the impermeability to {{chem|Na|+}}, {{chem|Ca|+}}, and {{chem|Mg|2+}}.
Over the same time period, it was shown (Procter &amp; Wilson, 1916) that gels, which do not have a semipermeable membrane, would swell in dilute solutions. [[Jacques Loeb|Loeb]] (1920) also studied [[gelatin]] extensively, with and without a membrane, showing that more of the properties attributed to the plasma membrane could be duplicated in [[gels]] without a membrane. In particular, he found that an electrical potential difference between the gelatin and the outside medium could be developed, based on the {{chem|H|+}} concentration. Some criticisms of the membrane theory developed in the 1930s, based on observations such as the ability of some cells to swell and increase their surface area by a factor of 1000. A lipid layer cannot stretch to that extent without becoming a patchwork (thereby losing its barrier properties. Such criticisms stimulated continued studies on protoplasm as the principal agent determining cell permeability properties. In 1938, Fischer and Suer proposed that water in the protoplasm is not free but in a chemically combined form—the protoplasm represents a combination of protein, salt and water—and demonstrated the basic similarity between swelling in living tissues and the swelling of gelatin and [[fibrin]] gels. Dimitri Nasonov (1944) viewed proteins as the central components responsible for many properties of the cell, including electrical properties.
By the 1940s, the bulk phase theories were not as well developed as the membrane theories. In 1941, Brooks &amp; Brooks published a monograph, "The Permeability of Living Cells", which rejects the bulk phase theories.

===Emergence of the steady-state membrane pump concept===

With the development of [[radioactive tracers]], it was shown that cells are not impermeable to {{chem|Na|+}}. This was difficult to explain with the membrane barrier theory, so the sodium pump was proposed to continually remove {{chem|Na|+}} as it permeates cells. This drove the concept that cells are in a state of [[dynamic equilibrium]], constantly using energy to maintain [[ion gradient]]s. In 1935, [[Karl Lohmann]] discovered [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and its role as a source of energy for cells, so the concept of a metabolically-driven [[sodium pump]] was proposed.
The tremendous success of [[Alan Lloyd Hodgkin|Hodgkin]], [[Andrew Huxley|Huxley]], and [[Bernard Katz|Katz]] in the development of the membrane theory of cellular membrane potentials, with differential equations that modeled the phenomena correctly, provided even more support for the membrane pump hypothesis.
 
The modern view of the plasma membrane is of a fluid lipid bilayer that has protein components embedded within it. The structure of the membrane is now known in great detail, including 3D models of many of the hundreds of different proteins that are bound to the membrane.
These major developments in cell physiology placed the membrane theory in a position of dominance and stimulated the imagination of most physiologists, who now apparently accept the theory as fact—there are, however, a few dissenters.[citation needed]
===The reemergence of the bulk phase theories===

In 1956, Afanasy S. Troshin published a book, ''The Problems of Cell Permeability'', in Russian (1958 in German, 1961 in Chinese, 1966 in English) in which he found that permeability was of secondary importance in determination of the patterns of equilibrium between the cell and its environment. Troshin showed that cell water decreased in solutions of galactose or urea although these compounds did slowly permeate cells. Since the membrane theory requires an impermanent solute to sustain cell shrinkage, these experiments cast doubt on the theory. Others questioned whether the cell has enough energy to sustain the sodium/potassium pump. Such questions became even more urgent as dozens of new metabolic pumps were added as new chemical gradients were discovered.

In 1962, [[Gilbert Ling]] became the champion of the bulk phase theories and proposed his association-induction hypothesis of living cells.

[[File:Prokaryote cell.svg|thumb|right| [[Prokaryote]] cell.]]
[[File:Endomembrane system diagram en (edit).svg|thumb|Endomembrane system diagram en| Eukaryote cell.]]
Cells can be subdivided into the following subcategories:

# ''[[Prokaryote]]s'': Prokaryotes are relatively small cells surrounded by the plasma membrane, with a characteristic cell wall that may differ in composition depending on the particular organism.&lt;ref name=w11&gt;Wolfe, p.&amp;nbsp;11&lt;/ref&gt; Prokaryotes lack a [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] (although they do have circular or linear [[DNA]]) and other membrane-bound [[organelle]]s (though they do contain [[ribosome]]s). The [[protoplasm]] of a prokaryote contains the chromosomal region that appears as [[fibrous]] deposits under the microscope, and the [[cytoplasm]].&lt;ref name=w11/&gt; [[Bacteria]] and [[Archaea]] are the  two [[domain (biology)|domains]] of prokaryotes.
# ''[[Eukaryote]]s'': Eukaryotic cells are also surrounded by the plasma membrane, but  on the other hand, they  have distinct nuclei bound by a [[nuclear membrane]] or envelope. Eukaryotic cells also contain membrane-bound organelles, such as  ([[mitochondria]], [[chloroplasts]], [[lysosomes]], rough and smooth [[endoplasmic reticulum]], [[vacuoles]]).&lt;ref name=w13&gt;Wolfe, p.&amp;nbsp;13&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, they possess organized chromosomes which store genetic material.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

Animals have evolved a greater diversity of cell types in a [[multicellular]] body (100–150 different cell types), compared
with 10–20 in plants, fungi, and protoctista.&lt;ref&gt;Margulis, L. &amp; Chapman, M.J. (2009). Kingdoms and Domains: An Illustrated Guide to the Phyla of Life on Earth ([4th ed.]. ed.). Amsterdam: Academic Press/Elsevier. p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Character evolution''' is the process by which a [[Character (biology)|character]] or [[Phenotypic trait|trait]] (a certain body part or property of an organism) evolves along the branches of an evolutionary tree. Character evolution usually refers to single changes within a lineage that make this lineage unique from others. These changes are called character state changes and they are often used in the study of evolution to provide a record of common ancestry. Character state changes can be phenotypic changes, [[nucleotide]] substitutions, or [[amino acid]] substitutions. These small changes in a species can be identifying features of when exactly a new lineage diverged from an old one.  
[[File:Current location in evolution.png|thumb|184x184px|A phylogenetic tree]]

==Phylogenetics==
In the study of [[phylogenetics]] or [[cladistics]], researchers can look at the characters shared by a collection of species and then group them into what is called a [[clade]].  The term clade was coined in 1957 by the biologist [[Julian Huxley]] to refer to the result of [[cladogenesis]], a concept Huxley borrowed from [[Bernhard Rensch]].&lt;ref name=Huxley&gt;{{cite journal | last = Huxley | first = J. S. | year =1957 |  title = The three types of evolutionary process | journal=Nature | volume=180 | pages=454–455 | doi=10.1038/180454a0| bibcode=1957Natur.180..454H }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A clade is by definition [[monophyletic]], meaning it contains one ancestor (which can be an organism, a [[population]], or a [[species]]) and all its descendants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Phylogenetic Systematics | year = 1966 | last = Hennig | first = Willi | publisher = University of Illinois Press, Urbana}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Code of Phylogenetic Nomenclature.

== Natural Selection ==
[[File:Darwins first tree.jpg|thumb|Charles Darwin's first sketch of an evolutionary tree]]
Natural Selection is the process by which organisms that are better adapted to their environment are selected to survive and reproduce more offspring. Natural selection selects for the phenotype or the characteristics of an organism that gives the organism a reproductive advantage in which it becomes the gene pool of a population. In addition, mutations also arise in the genome of an individual organism and offspring(s) can inherit such mutations. This genetic variation allows more organisms to adapt to a changing environment.

==Maximum Parsimony==
It is often the case in the study of phylogenies that the vast majority of organisms of interest are long [[extinction|extinct]].  It is therefore a matter of speculation to reconstruct what ancestral organisms existed long before the present time, and how the evolutionary process led from one organism to another, and which present-day organisms are most closely related. Character evolution and the character state changes that drive this type of evolution are what help researchers construct these trees in a fashion referred to as [[maximum parsimony]].  When talking about phylogenetics, maximum parsimony refers to a method of inferring a phylogenetic tree in a way that minimizes the number of implied character state transformations in the observed data (hence ''maximally parsimonious''). The basic ideas were presented by James S. Farris &lt;ref name="Farris1970"&gt;Farris, J. S.  (1970). Methods for computing Wagner trees.  ''Systematic Zoology''  19, 83-92.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1970.

Although fairly effective, maximum parsimony (like any method of phylogenetic inference) may not recover the true course of evolution for a given feature. For a number of reasons, two organisms can possess a trait not present in their last common ancestor.  The phenomena of [[convergent evolution]], [[parallel evolution]], and [[atavism|evolutionary reversals]] (collectively termed ''homoplasy'') are evolutionary forces that may disrupt the effectiveness of the maximum parsimony method of inferring phylogenetic relationships.  However, Rindal and Brower &lt;ref name="Rindal and Brower2010"&gt;Rindal, E. and Brower A.V.Z. (2010) Do model‐based phylogenetic analyses perform better than parsimony? A test with empirical data. ''Cladistics'' 27, 331-334.&lt;/ref&gt; showed that the vast majority of the time, parsimony and model-based phylogenetic analyses of the same data sets gave results that were not significantly different from one another, implying that if parsimony is producing false hypotheses of relationships due to homoplasy, then the Maximum Likelihood or Bayesian methods are doing so as well.

== Theory of Inheritance of Acquired Characteristics ==
[[File:Jean-baptiste lamarck.jpg|thumb|128x128px|Jean-Baptise Lamarck, the creator of the theory of inheritance of acquired characteristics]]
Lamarck is best known for his ''Theory of Inheritance of Acquired Characteristics'' in 1801. His theory states that the characteristics an organism acquires throughout its life in order to adapt to its environment are passed down to its offspring. For example, Lamarck believed that the long necks of giraffes evolved as generations of giraffes reached for ever higher leaves of a tree. Their offspring and later generations inherited the resulting long necks.

'''''Children Are the Victims of Adult Vices''''' is a group of [[bronze sculpture]]s created by [[Russian people|Russian]] artist [[Mihail Chemiakin]]. The sculptures are located in a park in [[Bolotnaya Square]], [[Balchug]], {{convert|2000|ft|abbr=off}} south of the [[Moscow Kremlin]] behind the [[British Ambassador to Russia|British Ambassador's]] residence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author = Yablokova, Oksana | url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-45469973.html |title=Moscow to Raise Monument to People's Sins |date=29 June 2001| publisher = ''[[The Moscow Times]]'' (via [[Highbeam Research]]) |accessdate= 12 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The sculptures are of thirteen figures, which depict adult [[vice]]s, such as alcoholism, drug addiction, and prostitution, that affect children.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/monitoring/media_reports/1426475.stm|title=Moscow divided over vices statue|date=6 July 2001| publisher = [[BBC News]] |accessdate=26 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The figures are perceptibly closing in on two unaware playmates, a girl and a boy, with the centrepiece figure being 'Indifference'.

The sculpture was commissioned by then-Mayor [[Yuri Luzhkov]] and sponsored by the state-owned oil company [[Rosneft]].  It was unveiled in 2001 amid some controversy. Some Muscovites worried that the graphic imagery would frighten children.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pravoslavie.ru/guest/abramenkova.htm|title="ПАМЯТНИК ПОРОКАМ" ШЕМЯКИНА С ТОЧКИ ЗРЕНИЯ ПСИХОЛОГА (an interview with doctor of psychological sciences Vasilevnoy Abramenkovoy)| last=Shishova| first=Tatiana|date=5 December 2001|publisher=www.pravoslavie.ru|language=Russian|accessdate= 26 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Chemiakin said that, "[The sculpture] ... was conceived and carried out by me as a symbol and a call to fight for the salvation of present and future generations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.log-in.ru/articles/560/|title=The children –  victims of adult vices|last=Darina|first=Nikonov|publisher=www.log-in.ru|language=Russian|accessdate= 26 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Creativity''' (formerly known as '''The Church of the Creator''' and '''World Church of the Creator''') is a [[Naturalistic pantheism|pantheistic]] [[white separatism|white separatist]], [[White supremacy|white supremacist]], [[Anti-Semitism|antisemitic]], [[Anti-Christian sentiment|anti-Christian]] [[Religion|religion]] which has been classified as a [[Neo-Nazism|Neo-Nazi]] [[hate group]] by the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/creativity-movement|website=Southern Poverty Law Center|accessdate=10 February 2017|title=The Creativity Movement}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded in [[Lighthouse Point, Florida]] by [[Ben Klassen]] as the Church of the Creator in 1973. The worldview of Creativity is purported to be based on the "survival, expansion and advancement of the White race",&lt;ref&gt;https://www.adl.org/education/resources/profiles/creativity-movement&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.latimes.com/1993-12-12/magazine/tm-915_1_hate-groups&lt;/ref&gt; according to the "external laws of nature, the experience of history, on logic and common sense"&lt;ref&gt;Race Over Grace: The Racialist Religion of the Christian Identity Movement&lt;/ref&gt; and members of the movement believe in a "racial holy war"&lt;ref&gt;https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/creativity-movement-0&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/1999/church-creator-timeline&lt;/ref&gt; between the "white and non-White races" (including [[Jews]], [[black people]] and non-white people of "mixed race").&lt;ref&gt;http://www.religioustolerance.org/wcotc.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F3/297/662/505536/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hate Crimes: Causes, Controls, and Controversies, page 147&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;DOMESTIC TERRORISM AND INCIDENT MANAGEMENT: Issues and Tactics, page 121&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Encyclopedia of Cults, Sects, and New Religions, page 218&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The New White Nationalism in America: Its Challenge to Integration, page 41&lt;/ref&gt;

Creativity is promoted by two organizations: the Creativity Alliance (CA – also known as the Church of Creativity) and the Creativity Movement (TCM). The groups have common origins.&lt;ref name="Michael"&gt;{{cite book

==Name==
Adherents of Creativity are known as ''Creators''. The church was originally founded as the ''Church of the Creator'' by Ben Klassen in 1973. [[Matthew F. Hale]] in 1996 formed a separate group known as the ''World Church of the Creator'' which largely supplanted the original Ben Klassen Church. The World Church of the Creator which – as of 2003 – has devolved into ''The Creativity Movement''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.adl.org/education/resources/profiles/creativity-movement&lt;/ref&gt; 

Rights to use the name "Church of the Creator" was lost by Hale in the United States to the [[Church of the Creator]], an unaffiliated religious organization based in [[Ashland, Oregon]], in a trademark-infringement case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Chicago Tribune |date=May 3, 2000 |quote=[4] The names "Creativity" and "Creator" are derived from the foreword of the first edition of ''Nature's Eternal Religion'' by Ben Klassen. It states, "We call our religion Creativity, and members thereof, Creators, because, we believe these words, in essence, best describe the characteristic soul of the White Race."A church based in Oregon filed a trademark-infringement lawsuit Tuesday in federal court in Chicago against the World Church of the Creator, led by white supremacist Matthew Hale of Downstate East Peoria. |title=Church Sues Hale's Group Over Trademark |url = http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2000-05-03/news/0005030331_1_white-supremacist-matthew-hale-world-church-trademark |accessdate=March 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Klassen |first=Ben |chapter=Foreword |title=[[Nature's Eternal Religion]] |location = Lighthouse Point, FL |publisher=Ken Klassen |page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Membership in the Creativity movement is restricted to persons whose genetic heritage is "wholly or predominantly" from Europe or members of the white race, regardless of where they reside.&lt;ref name="World Church of the Creator"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/wcotc3.htm |title=World Church of the Creator |website=Religioustolerance.org |date= |accessdate=2017-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "Creator" does not refer to a [[Creator deity|supernatural being]], but to adherents of Creativity and the White Race (which is credited with the creation of civilization).

Following the demise of the World Church of the Creator after Hale's arrest in 2003, there formed two distinct groups known as The Creativity Movement and the Creativity Alliance/Church of Creativity. The two groups are not known to interact with one another.

==Beliefs==
Creators are taught to hate non-whites and to avoid interacting with them socially. Creators are also expected to refute [[homosexuality]], [[miscegenation]], whining or complaining, and superstition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.creativitymovement.org/creator_library/english/lwb-3.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=March 27, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419014254/http://www.creativitymovement.org/creator_library/english/lwb-3.html |archivedate=April 19, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Creativity has sixteen race-based commandments and five fundamental beliefs which members regard as based on the "external laws of nature, the experience of history, on logic and common sense". These include the belief that "race is their religion", that the white race is "nature's finest", belief that race-loyalty is transcendent and that the "survival, expansion and advancement" of the white race on Earth is the "highest virtue".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/wcotc1.htm |title=World Church of the Creator |website=Religioustolerance.org |date= |accessdate=2016-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; They believe that [[Culture of the United States|American culture]] is becoming "more decadent," as evidenced by "black crimes, the growing acceptance of homosexuality, interracial marriage, increasing drug use, and the lack of racial identity among white people".&lt;ref name="religioustolerance1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/wcotc1.htm |title=World Church of the Creator |publisher=Religioustolerance.org |date= |accessdate=2016-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Anti-Defamation League]], members believe that [[Jewish people]] are working towards the enslavement of all races, and in particular the "mongrelization of the white race". Creators are encouraged to recite the "five fundamentals" daily.{{cn|date=September 2018}} Klassen encouraged Creators to refer to [[Black people]] as "[[nigger]]s" and openly opposed white supremacists who used more polite terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Baofu |first1 = Peter|year = 2009 |title = The Future of Post-Human Creative Thinking |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=fPcYBwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA4&amp;pg=PA225#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |publisher = Cambridge Scholars Publishing |pages = 225-226 |access-date = 2017-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the early 2000s, they were encouraged to move to [[Central Illinois]] in order to establish a Creativity bastion.&lt;ref name="World Church of the Creator"/&gt; 

Creativity promotes a religious diet and health doctrine, called the 14 Points of Salubrious Living (a form of [[Raw veganism|raw-food veganism]]), although it is not a religious requirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Klassen |first=Ben |title=The Little White Book: Fundamentals of the White Racial Religion Creativity for Daily Reading and Affirmation of the White Faith |editor=Victor Wolf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=September 2018}}

===Heaven, hell and the supernatural===
Creativity is a non-supernatural religion which rejects the [[supernatural]] while affirming a pantheist&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publiceye.org/racism/white-supremacy.html |title=The Website of Political Research Associates |website=PublicEye.org |date= |accessdate=2016-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; view of nature, asserting that "everything is in nature" and defining it as "the whole cosmos, the total universe, including its millions of natural laws through space and time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Klassen |first=Ben |chapter= The Laws of Nature Are Eternal |title=[[Nature's Eternal Religion]] |location = Lighthouse Point, FL |publisher=Ken Klassen }}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Klassen, "A Creator is not superstitious and disdains belief in the supernatural. He will waste no time giving credence to, or playing silly games with imaginary spooks, spirits, gods and demons." Creators do not believe in a supernatural afterlife believing "immortality" to be genetic and memorial with a [[Eternal oblivion|cessation of consciousness]] at death. They believe that they should view [[Biological process|life]] and [[death]] on Earth in a "rational, fearless manner," concentrating on life's positive aspects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.creativitymovement.org/creator_library/english/wmb-59.html | title = Life, Death and Immortality | publisher = Creativity movement}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Racial socialism===
The Southern Poverty Law Center classifies Creativity's ideology as [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]],&lt;ref name=SPLC&gt;{{cite web |title=The Creativity Movement | url =http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-files/groups/the-creativity-movement-0 |work=splcenter.org |publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center |accessdate=March 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Klassen, Creativity is not a rehash of Nazism and he listed eight differences between his political ideology and that of the Nazis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Little White Book | author = Ben Klassen | date = 1991 | publisher = Church of the Creator | chapter = 13. Creativity Unique}}&lt;/ref&gt; He adopted the phrase "racial socialism" to describe his political ideology. Klassen was critical of [[democracy]] and advocated [[meritocracy]], believing that effective leaders should rule. Under racial socialism, "whites would work together toward common goals but without the massive economic planning in the style of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Gosplan]]." &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book |last=Michael |first=George |title = Theology of Hate: a History of the World Church of the Creator |publisher = University Press of Florida |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-8130-3350-1}}{{Page needed|date = January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He supported a limited [[market economy]], believing that social and economic activities should be in the best interests of white people. Klassen criticized "leftist proclivities" to recruit from the white working class: "All [white] members of the national or racial community ... had an important role to play."&lt;ref name = "ReferenceA" /&gt;

Klassen urged Creators to "work feverishly and aggressively to organize politically, to distribute literature on behalf of the White Race, to promote and foster White solidarity, and to get control of the government and the political machinery of the state by legal means if possible. If this is not possible by legal means, then we must resort to the same means as our forefathers used two hundred years ago to defend their liberty, their property, their homes and their families."{{cn|date=February 2017}}

===Activism===
Creativity advocates [[proselytism]]. Its goal is to place 10 million copies of two books, ''Nature's Eternal Religion'' and ''The White Man's Bible'', into the hands of white people as part of its belief in "gird[ing] up for total war".{{cn|date=February 2017}} It teaches the [[white genocide conspiracy theory]] in support of its perception that shifting population demographics is leading to [[miscegenation]].&lt;ref name="Hate Crimes"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Perry|first1=Barbara|title=Hate Crimes|date=2009|publisher=Praeger Publishers|location=Westport, Connecticut|isbn=978-0-275-99569-0|pages=The Victims of Hate Crime 37, Hate Crime Offenders 31}}&lt;!--|accessdate=24 October 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to the [[Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance]], the Creativity Movement opposes illegal activity and violence, believing it to be counterproductive.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; The church's member handbook threatens expulsion from the church for members who commit crimes or encourage others to do so. Despite this, the church has been connected to multiple religiously and racially inspired violent crimes.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/wcotc2.htm |title=World Church of the Creator |work=ReligiousTolerance.org |publisher=Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance |date= |accessdate=2016-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Creators view "racial holy war" (Rahowa) as a [[religious war]] of racial self-defense.&lt;ref name="religioustolerance.org"&gt;{{cite web |last=Robinson |first=B. A. |url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/wcotc3.htm |title=The Creativity Movement: Church Practices |work=ReligiousTolerance.org |publisher=Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance |accessdate=March 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''White Man's Bible'' calls for readers to, "use any means, legal or otherwise, available to us for our own survival," leading to the hunting down and eliminating of "tormentors".&lt;ref name="fbi"/&gt;

==Practices==
{{primary|section|date=March 2018}}
===Holidays===
The religion has several holidays. Creators are encouraged to observe them, spending time with their families and friends of the religion:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://creativityalliance.com/creator-calendar/ |title=Creator Calendar – Creativity Alliance |website=Creativityalliance.com |date= |accessdate=2016-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ceremonies===
{{anchor|Religious ceremonies}}
Creativity has four sacraments: marriage, pledging for children, confirmation, and eulogizing the dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author = Ben Klassen |title=The Little White Book | publisher = Church of the Creator | date = 1991 | chapter = 25. The Creator Wedding Ceremony," "26. The Creator Child Pledging Ceremony," "27. Ceremony of Confirmation ," "28. The Saying of Goodbyes to our Departed Brethren }}&lt;/ref&gt; All ceremonies are performed by church ministers. At a wedding, the bride and groom exchange vows before Nature. The pledging ceremony is ideally conducted a week after a child's birth, with both parents pledging to raise their child as a "loyal member of the White Race and faithful to the church." The confirmation ceremony may be performed on or after a child's 13th birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Robinson, B. A |url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/wcotc3.htm |title=The Creativity Movement |website=religioustolerance.org |publisher= |accessdate=July 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ministers===
{{anchor|Ordained ministers}}
On a now-defunct website, Klassen stated that anyone could be an ordained minister in his church, provided they were "a legitimate White Man or Woman over the age of 16."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pacreator.com/US/index.php?option%3Dcom_content%26view%3Darticle%26id%3D69%26Itemid%3D79 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=October 26, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426080729/http://www.pacreator.com/US/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=69&amp;Itemid=79 |archivedate=April 26, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prospective ministers must demonstrate worthiness and pass written and oral examinations. The written exams consist of 150 questions (requiring a one-paragraph response to each) and an essay. Applicants are encouraged to request recommendations from three established ministers, and the final requirement is the signing of an [[oath]].&lt;ref name="religioustolerance.org"/&gt;

==Books==
{{anchor|Religious texts|''White Man's Bible''}}
Creativity's founding text is ''Nature's Eternal Religion'', which was written by Klassen in 1973. The book proposes that white people are the "supreme act of creation", and only white people are capable of divine creativity.&lt;ref name=fbi&gt;{{Citation | url = https://www.fbi.gov/stats-services/publications/terror_99.pdf | title = Terrorism in the United States | year = 1999 | place = US | publisher = Justice Department, FBI | page = 4 | format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first book critiques [[Christianity]], including the [[Christian Bible]]. Many biblical stories, including those of [[Adam and Eve]], [[Jonah]] and the whale and the [[resurrection of Jesus]], are considered historically unlikely. The [[historicity of Jesus]] is also questioned, with Klassen saying that he can find no independent evidence of his existence.&lt;ref name=compass&gt;{{cite news |title= World Church of Creator founded in 1973 | url= http://helenair.com/news/national/article_5773df3b-088c-5698-85d6-b1cf64811cf5.html |newspaper= Helena Independent Record |date= March 27, 2004 |accessdate=December 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Creativity, Christianity is a violent religion which has killed 1,000 fellow Christians for every Christian killed by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]].&lt;ref name="religioustolerance1"/&gt; Adherents do not believe in the existence of [[Jesus]], rejecting Christian teachings as a "suicidal poison" that was created by Jews and foisted on the white race. They reject the exhortation to love one's enemies, believing that enemies should be hated. Creators also reject the [[Golden Rule]], saying that it does not make "good sense" and at a "closer look" it is a "completely unworkable principle."&lt;ref name="religioustolerance1"/&gt;

Klassen published other books on his white supremacist philosophy, including ''The White Man's Bible'', which called for violence against any perceived threats to white people.&lt;ref name=fbi/&gt;

=={{anchor|Early years}}History==
Creativity was formed in 1973, when Klassen self-published ''Nature's Eternal Religion''. He attempted to recruit neo-Nazis into the church because, apart from disagreements over religion, there was no fundamental conflict between church doctrine and [[Nazism|National Socialism]]. Klassen developed a rapport with [[National Alliance (United States)|National Alliance]] leader [[William Luther Pierce]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Michael | first = George | title = Theology of Hate: a History of the World Church of the Creator | page = 62}}&lt;/ref&gt; he met Pierce twice in 1975, and they maintained an "on and off" relationship for the next 18 years. According to Klassen, he "never did understand the logic of what [Pierce] called his [[Cosmotheism]] religion ... it has not been of any significance as far as our common goal of promoting White racial solidarity was concerned."{{cn|date=February 2017}} In ''Trials, Tribulations, and Triumphs'', Klassen called Pierce "a great man and an outstanding intellectual thinker, and ... one of us."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Klassen | first = Ben | title = Trials, Tribulations, and Triumphs | page = 219}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, Klassen established a Creativity headquarters in [[Otto, North Carolina]]. Although his family expected resistance from local residents, Klassen wrote: "We were not quite prepared for the viciousness of the onslaught by the local paper." Opposition grew, and a May 13, 1982 ''Franklin Press'' headline read: "Pro-Hitler, anti-Christ Leader Headquarters Here".&lt;ref&gt;Trials, Tribulations, and Triumphs&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp | needed = yes | date =July 2013}}

Several years after Klassen's 1993 death, white supremacist Matthew Hale founded the New Church of the Creator (later the World Church of the Creator).

They were stopped by police, who were suspicious that their vehicle had been stolen. According to the report, while being escorted to a nearby police station they detonated a smoke bomb and attempted to escape. Police discovered their abandoned vehicle five miles away; Grobbelaar and  White ambushed them.

===Ron McVan===
Ron McVan, co-founder of the [[Wotansvolk]] [[Neo-völkisch movements|neo-völkisch]] pagan group, was once affiliated with the Church of the Creator for two years as its second-in-command;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.adl.org/learn/ext_us/lane.html |title=David Lane |website=Archive.adl.org |date= |accessdate=2016-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; McVan contributed articles and artwork to its periodical, ''Racial Loyalty'', and was a martial-arts instructor for the church. Although Klassen and McVan shared anti-Christian beliefs, McVan sought a more spiritual approach and felt that Creativity needed spirituality. He moved to the Pacific Northwest and founded Wotan's Kindred in [[Portland, Oregon]] in 1992, saying that the group was rooted in the "genetic character and collective identity" of the white race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goodrick-Clarke|first=Nicholas|authorlink=Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke|title=Black Sun: Aryan Cults, Esoteric Nazism, and the Politics of Identity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xaiaM77s6N4C&amp;pg=PA274|year=2003|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=978-0-8147-3155-0|page=274}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaplan|first=Jeffrey|authorlink=Jeffrey Kaplan (academic)|title=Encyclopedia of White Power: A Sourcebook on the Radical Racist Right|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nNWbbhUYv8oC&amp;pg=PA201|year=2000|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=978-0-7425-0340-3|page=201}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gardell|first=Mattias|authorlink=Mattias Gardell|title=Gods of the Blood: The Pagan Revival and White Separatism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FIwwWSSL5JIC&amp;pg=PA222|year=2003|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=0-8223-3071-7|page=222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===William Christopher Gibbs===
William Christopher Gibbs, a Church of Creativity adherent in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and a member of the Creativity Alliance, was arrested for possession of the biological toxin [[Ricin#Chemical or biological warfare agent|ricin]]. Gibbs went to a hospital after he accidentally got the ricin on his hands while experimenting with it.&lt;ref name="Gibbs"&gt;{{cite web|last=Cleary |first=Tom |url=http://heavy.com/news/2017/02/william-christopher-gibbs-georgia-white-supremacist-ricin-poison-photos-facebook-church-creativity/ |title=William Christopher Gibbs: 5 Fast Facts You Need to Know |website=Heavy.com |date=2017-02-09 |accessdate=2017-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On September 21, 2018, a Federal judge ordered Gibbss' release from Federal custody because of a technicality: ricin had been inexplicably dropped from the list of illegal biological toxins which are known as "select agents" due to changes in the 2004 law and edits to regulations in 2005. The judge did not rule out the possibility that Gibbs could be potentially convicted under another Federal law.  Gibbs continued to be incarcerated in the [[Fannin County, Georgia]] jail under a misdemeanor charge of reckless conduct which stemmed from his 2017 arrest and a probation violation connected to a 2010 conviction for burglary.&lt;ref&gt;Joyner, Chris (October 2, 2018) [https://www.myajc.com/news/crime--law/ricin-charges-dropped-against-georgia-white-supremacist/0GWcj07MLSMvcthfnApsWM/ "Ricin charges dropped against Georgia white supremacist"] ''[[Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly before and during McCarty's leadership, Creativity was plagued with legal problems; members were arrested for conspiracy, unlawful firearms possession and their association with the July 1993 firebombing of an [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]] building in [[Tacoma, Washington]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19930730&amp;slug=1713586|title=Business {{!}} FBI Says Bombing Of Naacp Just A Start -- Suspects Planned Racial Rampage, Court Papers Allege {{!}} Seattle Times Newspaper|website=community.seattletimes.nwsource.com|access-date=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; McCarty struggled to keep the group unified. The lawsuit filed by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), seeking damages related to the May 1991 murder of Harold Mansfield, Jr. by Creator George Loeb, finally led to a March 1994 court ruling which fined the Church of the Creator $1,000,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.adl.org/learn/ext_us/wcotc.html|title=You are being redirected...|website=archive.adl.org|access-date=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court also ruled that Klassen's property sale to Pierce shortly before his suicide was collusion to deny payment to Mansfield's family, ordering Pierce to return his $85,000 profit from the resale of the property. With the church unable to pay the outstanding balance, the SPLC sued for its dissolution to settle the remaining damages and McCarty readily agreed.&lt;ref&gt;Florida Department of State, Document # 237320644&lt;/ref&gt;

===Creativity Movement===
[[File:Trademarked logo of the creativity movement.jpg|thumb|alt=Letter W, crown and halo inside a black circle|Creativity Movement logo]]
Matthew F. Hale founded the New Church of the Creator in 1996 – later renamed the World Church of the Creator. Hale's World Church of the Creator was a new and separate group rather than a direct successor to Ben Klassen's Church of the Creator. Until his arrest in 2003, Hale was the only Pontifex Maximus of the now defunct World Church of the Creator. The current group known as The Creativity Movement is a [[white power skinhead]] oriented direct successor to Hale's World Church of the Creator.

==Leafletting campaigns==
In March 2015, leaflets were posted on doors in southern [[Liverpool]] in the United Kingdom saying: "The white race is nature’s finest". Cailen Cambeul, Creativity minister and then Pontifex Maximus for the Creativity Alliance, said that he was responsible for their distribution. Complaints were made to the police by local councilors. Sarah Jennings of the local [[Green Party of England and Wales|Green Party]] denounced Creativity as a "fringe group of blatant racists".&lt;ref name="Echo" /&gt; According to Cambeul, "Any politician claiming disgust at our flyers and seeking to make political gains via our 100-percent-legal message is partaking in an opportunistic abuse of power at the expense of innocent people exercising their rights to speak out against the injustices of a politically correct world."&lt;ref name=Echo&gt;{{cite news|title=Leaflet claiming "the white race is nature's finest" slammed after being delivered in south Liverpool|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/leaflet-claiming-the-white-race-8907506|accessdate=24 March 2015|publisher=Liverpool Echo|date=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Determinism''' is the philosophical idea that all events, including moral choices, are determined completely by previously existing causes. Determinism is at times understood to preclude free will because it entails that humans cannot act otherwise than they do. It can also be called as [[hard determinism]] from this point of view. [[Hard determinism]] is a position on the relationship of determinism to free will. The theory holds that the universe is utterly rational because complete knowledge of any given situation assures that unerring knowledge of its future is also possible.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/topic/determinism Determinism] Encyclopedia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt; Some philosophers suggest variants around this basic definition.&lt;ref name=Doyle&gt;A list of a dozen varieties of determinism is provided in {{cite book |title=Free Will: The Scandal in Philosophy |author=Bob Doyle |pages=145–146 ''ff'' |isbn=0983580200 |year=2011 |publisher=I-Phi Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SeA_gFfHMgoC&amp;pg=PA145}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deterministic theories throughout the history of philosophy have sprung from diverse and sometimes overlapping motives and considerations. The opposite of determinism is some kind of [[indeterminism]] (otherwise called nondeterminism). Determinism is often contrasted with [[free will]].&lt;ref name=Franklin&gt;For example, see {{cite book |title=Freewill and determinism: a study of rival conceptions of man |author=Richard Langdon Franklin |year=1968 |publisher=Routledge &amp; K. Paul |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=51wIAQAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Determinism often is taken to mean ''causal determinism'', which in physics is known as cause-and-effect. It is the concept that [[Event (philosophy)|event]]s within a given [[paradigm]] are bound by [[causality]] in such a way that any state (of an object or event) is completely determined by prior states. This meaning can be distinguished from other varieties of determinism mentioned below.

Other debates often concern the scope of determined systems, with some maintaining that the entire universe is a single determinate system and others identifying other more limited determinate systems (or [[multiverse]]). Numerous historical debates involve many philosophical positions and varieties of determinism. They include debates concerning determinism and free will, technically denoted as [[compatibilistic]] (allowing the two to coexist) and [[incompatibilistic]] (denying their coexistence is a possibility). Determinism should not be confused with [[Self-determination_theory|self-determination]] of human actions by reasons, motives, and desires. Determinism rarely requires that perfect [[prediction]] be practically possible.

==Varieties==
"Determinism" may commonly refer to any of the following viewpoints:

[[File:Bled (9664110474).jpg|thumb|right|140px|Many philosophical theories of determinism frame themselves with the idea that reality follows a sort of predetermined path.]]
* Causal determinism is "the idea that every event is necessitated by antecedent events and conditions together with the laws of nature".&lt;ref name="SEPcausaldeterminism"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Hoefer |first=Carl | title=Causal Determinism | encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2009 edition) |date=Apr 1, 2008 |editor=Edward N. Zalta, ed |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2009/entries/determinism-causal/}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, causal determinism is a broad enough term to consider that "one's deliberations, choices, and actions will often be necessary links in the causal chain that brings something about. In other words, even though our deliberations, choices, and actions are themselves determined like everything else, it is still the case, according to causal determinism, that the occurrence or existence of yet other things depends upon our deliberating, choosing and acting in a certain way".&lt;ref name="SEPmoralresponsibility"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Eshleman |first=Andrew |editor=Edward N. Zalta, ed |title=Moral Responsibility | encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy| edition=Winter 2009 |date=Nov 18, 2009 | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2012/entries/moral-responsibility/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Causal determinism proposes that there is an unbroken chain of prior occurrences stretching back to the origin of the universe. The relation between events may not be specified, nor the origin of that universe. Causal determinists believe that there is nothing in the universe that is uncaused or [[causa sui|self-caused]]. [[Historical determinism]] (a sort of [[path dependence]]) can also be synonymous with causal determinism. Causal determinism has also been considered more generally as the idea that everything that happens or exists is caused by antecedent conditions.&lt;ref name=StanfordIncompatibilism&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/incompatibilism-arguments/ Arguments for Incompatibilism (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of nomological determinism, these conditions are considered events also, implying that the future is determined completely by preceding events&amp;mdash;a combination of prior states of the universe and the laws of nature.&lt;ref name="SEPcausaldeterminism"/&gt; Yet they can also be considered metaphysical of origin (such as in the case of theological determinism).&lt;ref name="SEPmoralresponsibility"/&gt;
** {{anchor|Nomological determinism}} Nomological determinism is the most common form of causal determinism. It is the notion that the past and the present dictate the future entirely and necessarily by rigid natural laws, that every occurrence results inevitably from prior events. Nomological determinism is sometimes illustrated by the [[thought experiment]] of [[Laplace's demon]].&lt;ref name=laplace&gt;
[[Laplace]] posited that an omniscient observer knowing with infinite precision all the positions and velocities of every particle in the universe could predict the future entirely. For a discussion, see {{cite book |title=The Big Questions: A Short Introduction to Philosophy |author1=Robert C. Solomon |author2=Kathleen M. Higgins |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ekh2AKqXdqgC&amp;pg=PA232 |page=232 |isbn=0495595152 |publisher=Cengage Learning |chapter=Free will and determinism|year=2009 |edition=8th}} Another view of determinism is discussed by {{cite book |title=The Structure of Science: Problems in the Logic of Scientific Explanation |author=Ernest Nagel |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u6EycHgRfkQC&amp;pg=PA285 |pages =285–292 |chapter=§V: Alternative descriptions of physical state |quote=a theory is deterministic if, and only if, given its state variables for some initial period, the theory logically determines a unique set of values for those variables for any other period. |isbn=0915144719 |year=1999 |publisher=Hackett |edition=2nd }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Nomological determinism is sometimes called 'scientific' determinism, although that is a misnomer. Physical determinism is generally used synonymously with nomological determinism (its opposite being [[Indeterminism|physical indeterminism]]).
** [[Necessitarianism]] is closely related to the causal determinism described above. It is a [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] principle that denies all mere possibility; there is exactly one way for the world to be. [[Leucippus]] claimed there were no uncaused events, and that everything occurs for a reason and by necessity.&lt;ref&gt;Leucippus, Fragment 569 - from Fr. 2 Actius I, 25, 4&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Predeterminism]] is the idea that all events are determined in advance.&lt;ref name="McKewan"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=McKewan |first=Jaclyn |editor=H. James Birx"|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Time: Science, Philosophy, Theology, &amp; Culture |title=Predeterminism |year=2009 |publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc. |doi=10.4135/9781412963961.n191 |pages=1035–1036|chapter=Evolution, Chemical |isbn=9781412941648 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Oxford Dictionaries |title=Predeterminism |url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/predeterminism |accessdate=20 December 2012 |date=April 2010 |publisher=Oxford Dictionaries}}.

In the case of predeterminism, this chain of events has been pre-established, and human actions cannot interfere with the outcomes of this pre-established chain. Predeterminism can be used to mean such pre-established causal determinism, in which case it is categorised as a specific type of determinism.&lt;ref name="McKewan" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://philosophy.lander.edu/ethics/notes-determinism.html |title=Some Varieties of Free Will and Determinism |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |work=Philosophy 302: Ethics |publisher=philosophy.lander.edu |accessdate=19 December 2012| quote=Predeterminism: the philosophical and theological view that combines God with determinism.

A weaker version holds that, though not predestined to happen, everything that happens has been eternally known by virtue of the divine foreknowledge of an omniscient divinity. If this divinity is also omnipotent, as in the case of the Judeo-Christian religions, this weaker version is hard to distinguish from the previous one because, though able to prevent what happens and knowing that it is going to happen, God lets it happen. To this, advocates of free will reply that God permits it to happen in order to make room for the free will of humans.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second form, weak theological determinism, is based on the concept of divine foreknowledge&amp;mdash;"because [[God]]'s omniscience is perfect, what God knows about the future will inevitably happen, which means, consequently, that the future is already fixed".&lt;ref name=Huyssteen2003&gt;{{cite book|author=Wentzel Van Huyssteen|title=Encyclopedia of science and religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HIcYAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=22 December 2012|volume=1|year=2003|publisher=Macmillan Reference|isbn=978-0-02-865705-9|page=217|chapter=theological determinism|quote=Theological determinism constitutes a fifth kind of determinism.

Either way, the consequence is that everything that happens becomes God's action, and determinism is closely linked to divine action and God's omnipotence. According to the second type of theological determinism, God has perfect knowledge of everything in the universe because God is omniscient. And, as some say, because God is outside of time, God has the capacity of knowing past, present, and future in one instance. This means that God knows what will happen in the future. And because God's omniscience is perfect, what God knows about the future will inevitably happen, which means, consequently, that the future is already fixed.}}&lt;/ref&gt; There exist slight variations on the above categorisation. Some claim that theological determinism requires [[predestination]] of all events and outcomes by the divinity (i.e. they do not classify the weaker version as 'theological determinism' unless libertarian free will is assumed to be denied as a consequence), or that the weaker version does not constitute 'theological determinism' at all.&lt;ref name=VanArragon2010&gt;{{cite book|author=Raymond J.

We might think of God here as the all-powerful movie director who writes script and causes everything to go accord with it. We should note, as an aside, that there is some debate over what would be sufficient for theological determinism to be true.

* Logical determinism or ''Determinateness'' is the notion that all propositions, whether about the past, present, or future, are either [[Law of excluded middle|true or false]]. Note that one can support causal determinism without necessarily supporting logical determinism and vice versa (depending on one's views on the nature of [[time]], but also [[randomness]]). The problem of free will is especially salient now with logical determinism: how can choices be free, given that propositions about the future already have a truth value in the present (i.e. it is already determined as either true or false)? This is referred to as the [[problem of future contingents]]. [[File:Iimatyas.jpg|thumb|right|140px|Adequate determinism focuses on [[quantum mechanics|the fact that]], even without a full understanding of microscopic physics, we can predict the distribution of 1000 coin tosses.]]
** Often synonymous with logical determinism are the ideas behind spatio-temporal determinism or [[Eternalism (philosophy of time)|eternalism]]: the view of special relativity. [[J. J. C. Smart]], a proponent of this view, uses the term "tenselessness" to describe the simultaneous existence of past, present, and future. In physics, the "block universe" of [[Hermann Minkowski]] and [[Albert Einstein]] assumes that time is a fourth dimension (like the three spatial dimensions). In other words, all the other parts of time are real, like the city blocks up and down a street, although the order in which they appear depends on the driver (see [[Rietdijk–Putnam argument]]).
* Adequate determinism is the idea that [[quantum indeterminacy]] can be ignored for most macroscopic events. This is because of [[quantum decoherence]]. Random quantum events "average out" in the [[Expected value|limit of large numbers]] of particles (where the laws of quantum mechanics asymptotically approach the laws of classical mechanics).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informationphilosopher.com/freedom/adequate_determinism.html The Information Philosopher website], "Adequate Determinism", from the site: "''We are happy to agree with scientists and philosophers who feel that quantum effects are for the most part negligible in the macroscopic world. We particularly agree that they are negligible when considering the causally determined will and the causally determined actions set in motion by decisions of that will.''"&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stephen Hawking]] explains a similar idea: he says that the microscopic world of [[quantum mechanics]] is one of determined probabilities. That is, quantum effects rarely alter the predictions of [[classical mechanics]], which are quite accurate (albeit still [[Uncertainty principle|not perfectly certain]]) at larger scales.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Grand Design (book)|Grand Design]] (2010), page 32: "the molecular basis of biology shows that biological processes are governed by the laws of physics and chemistry and therefore are as determined as the orbits of the planets.", and page 72: ''"Quantum physics might seem to undermine the idea that nature is governed by laws, but that is not the case. Instead it leads us to accept a new form of determinism: Given the state of a system at some time, the laws of nature determine the probabilities of various futures and pasts rather than determining the future and past with certainty."'' (emphasis in original, discussing a [[Many worlds interpretation]])&lt;/ref&gt; Something as large as an [[cell (biology)|animal cell]], then, would be "adequately determined" (even in light of quantum indeterminacy).
* The [[many-worlds interpretation]] accepts the linear causal sets of sequential events with adequate consistency yet also suggests constant forking of causal chains creating "multiple universes" to account for multiple outcomes from single events.&lt;ref&gt;Kent, Adrian. "One world versus many: the inadequacy of Everettian accounts of evolution, probability, and scientific confirmation." Many worlds (2010): 307–354.&lt;/ref&gt;  Meaning the causal set of events leading to the present are all valid yet appear as a singular linear time stream within a much broader unseen conic probability field of other outcomes that "split off" from the locally observed timeline.  Under this model causal sets are still "consistent" yet not exclusive to singular iterated outcomes.  The interpretation side steps the exclusive retrospective causal chain problem of "could not have done otherwise" by suggesting "the other outcome does exist" in a set of parallel universe time streams that split off when the action occurred.  This theory is sometimes described with the example of agent based choices but more involved models argue that recursive causal splitting occurs with all particle wave functions at play.&lt;ref&gt;Vaidman, Lev. "Many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics." (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;  This model is highly contested with multiple objections from the scientific community.

==Philosophical connections==

===With nature/nurture controversy===
[[File:JuliusOttoGrimm-Sculpture.jpg|thumb|140px|Nature and nurture interact in humans. A scientist looking at a sculpture after some time does not ask whether we are seeing the effects of the starting materials or of environmental influences.]]
Although some of the above forms of determinism concern human behaviors and [[cognition]], others frame themselves as an answer to the debate on [[nature and nurture]]. They will suggest that one factor will entirely determine behavior. As scientific understanding has grown, however, the strongest versions of these theories have been widely rejected as a [[Fallacy of the single cause|single-cause fallacy]].&lt;ref name="melo-martin"&gt;{{cite journal |author=de Melo-Martín I|title=Firing up the nature/nurture controversy: bioethics and genetic determinism |journal=J Med Ethics|volume=31 |issue=9|pages=526–30 |year=2005 |pmid=16131554 |pmc=1734214|doi=10.1136/jme.2004.008417|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other words, the modern deterministic theories attempt to explain how the interaction of both nature ''and'' nurture is entirely predictable. The concept of [[heritability]] has been helpful in making this distinction.

[[Biological determinism]], sometimes called [[genetic determinism]], is the idea that each of human behaviors, beliefs, and desires are fixed by human genetic nature.

[[Behaviorism]] involves the idea that all behavior can be traced to specific causes—either environmental or reflexive. [[John B. Watson]] and [[B. F. Skinner]] developed this nurture-focused determinism.

[[Cultural determinism]] or [[social determinism]] is the nurture-focused theory that the culture in which we are raised determines who we are.

[[Environmental determinism]], also known as climatic or geographical determinism, proposes that the physical environment, rather than social conditions, determines culture. Supporters of environmental determinism often{{quantify|date=August 2014}} also support [[Behaviorism|Behavioral determinism]]. Key proponents of this notion have included [[Ellen Churchill Semple]], [[Ellsworth Huntington]], [[Thomas Griffith Taylor]] and possibly [[Jared Diamond]], although his status as an environmental determinist is debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;

===With particular factors===
[[File:Using Mobile Phone 0251.JPG|thumb|right|150px|A technological determinist might suggest that technology like the mobile phone is the greatest factor shaping human civilization.]]
Other 'deterministic' theories actually seek only to highlight the importance of a particular factor in predicting the future. These theories often use the factor as a sort of guide or constraint on the future. They need not suppose that complete knowledge of that one factor would allow us to make perfect predictions.

[[Psychological determinism]] can mean that humans must act according to reason, but it can also be synonymous with some sort of [[Psychological egoism]]. The latter is the view that humans will always act according to their perceived best interest.

[[Linguistic determinism]] claims that our language determines (at least limits) the things we can think and say and thus know. The [[Sapir–Whorf hypothesis]] argues that individuals experience the world based on the grammatical structures they habitually use.

[[Economic determinism]] attributes primacy to economic structure over politics in the development of human history. It is associated with the [[dialectical materialism]] of [[Karl Marx]].

[[Technological determinism]] is a reductionist theory that presumes that a society's technology drives the development of its social structure and cultural values.

===With free will===
{{Main article|Free will}}
[[File:DeterminismXFreeWill.svg|thumb|right|300px|A table showing the different positions related to free will and determinism]]
Philosophers have debated both the truth of determinism, and the truth of free will. This creates the four possible positions in the figure. [[Compatibilism]] refers to the view that [[free will]] is, in some sense, compatible with determinism. The three [[incompatibilist]] positions, on the other hand, deny this possibility. The [[hard incompatibilism|hard incompatibilists]] hold that both determinism and free will do not exist, the [[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|libertarianists]] that determinism does not hold, and free will might exist, and the [[hard determinism|hard determinists]] that determinism does hold and free will does not exist.

The standard argument against free will, according to philosopher [[J. J. C. Smart]] focuses on the implications of determinism for 'free will'.&lt;ref&gt;J. J. C. Smart, "Free-Will, Praise and Blame,"''Mind'', July 1961, p.293-4.&lt;/ref&gt; However, he suggests free will is denied whether determinism is true or not. On one hand, if determinism is true, all our actions are predicted and we are assumed not to be free; on the other hand, if determinism is false, our actions are presumed to be random and as such we do not seem free because we had no part in controlling what happened.

In his book, ''[[The Moral Landscape]]'', author and neuroscientist [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]] also argues against free will. He offers one thought experiment where a mad scientist represents determinism. In Harris' example, the mad scientist uses a machine to control all the desires, and thus all the behavior, of a particular human. Harris believes that it is no longer as tempting, in this case, to say the victim has "free will". Harris says nothing changes if the machine controls desires at random - the victim still seems to lack free will. Harris then argues that we are also the victims of such unpredictable desires (but due to the unconscious machinations of our brain, rather than those of a mad scientist). Based on this introspection, he writes "This discloses the real mystery of free will: if our experience is compatible with its utter absence, how can we say that we see any evidence for it in the first place?"&lt;ref&gt;Sam Harris, The Moral Landscape (2010), pg.216, note102&lt;/ref&gt; adding that "Whether they are predictable or not, we do not cause our causes."&lt;ref&gt;Sam Harris, The Moral Landscape (2010), pg.217, note109&lt;/ref&gt; That is, he believes there is compelling [[evidence of absence]] of free will.

===With the soul===
Some determinists argue that [[materialism]] does not present a complete understanding of the universe, because while it can describe determinate interactions among material things, it ignores the [[mind]]s or [[Soul (spirit)|soul]]s of conscious beings.

A number of positions can be delineated:

# Immaterial souls are all that exist ([[Idealism]]).
# Immaterial souls exist and exert a non-deterministic causal influence on bodies. (Traditional free-will, [[interactionist dualism]]).&lt;ref&gt;By 'soul' in the context of (1) is meant an [[Wiktionary:autonomy|autonomous]] immaterial agent that has the power to control the body but not to be controlled by the body (this theory of determinism thus conceives of conscious agents in [[Mind-body dualism|dualistic]] terms). Therefore the soul stands to the activities of the individual agent's body as does the creator of the universe to the universe. The creator of the universe put in motion a deterministic system of material entities that would, if left to themselves, carry out the chain of events determined by ordinary causation. But the creator also provided for souls that could exert a causal force analogous to the primordial causal force and alter outcomes in the physical universe via the acts of their bodies. Thus, it emerges that no events in the physical universe are uncaused. Some are caused entirely by the original creative act and the way it plays itself out through time, and some are caused by the acts of created souls. But those created souls were not created by means of physical processes involving ordinary causation. They are another order of being entirely, gifted with the power to modify the original creation. However, determinism is not necessarily limited to matter; it can encompass energy as well. The question of how these immaterial entities can act upon material entities is deeply involved in what is generally known as the [[mind-body problem]]. It is a significant problem which philosophers have not reached agreement about&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/freewill/ Free Will (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]&lt;/ref&gt;
# Immaterial souls exist, but are part of deterministic framework.
# Immaterial souls exist, but exert no causal influence, free or determined ([[epiphenomenalism]], [[occasionalism]])
# Immaterial souls do not exist — there is no [[mind-body problem|mind-body]] [[dichotomy]], and there is a [[Materialism|Materialistic]] explanation for intuitions to the contrary.

===With ethics and morality===
Another topic of debate is the implication that Determinism has on [[Ethics|morality]]. [[Hard determinism]] (a belief in determinism, and not free will) is particularly criticized for seeming to make traditional moral judgments impossible. Some philosophers, however, find this an acceptable conclusion.

Philosopher and incompatibilist [[Peter van Inwagen]] introduces this thesis as such:

Argument that [[Free Will]] is Required for Moral Judgments
# The moral judgment that you shouldn't have done X implies that you should have done something else instead
# That you should have done something else instead implies that there was something else for you to do
# That there was something else for you to do implies that you could have done something else
# That you could have done something else implies that you have free will
# If you don't have free will to have done other than X we cannot make the moral judgment that you shouldn't have done X.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=van Inwagen|first=Peter|title=The Powers of Rational Beings: Freedom of the Will|year=2009|publisher=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a compatibilist might have an issue with Inwagen's process because one can not change the past like his arguments center around. A compatibilist who centers around plans for the future might posit:
# The moral judgment that you should not have done X implies that you can do something else instead
# That you can do something else instead implies that there is something else for you to do
# That there is something else for you to do implies that you can do something else
# That you can do something else implies that you have free will for planning future recourse
# If you have free will to do other than X we can make the moral judgment that you should do other than X, and punishing you as a responsible party for having done X that you know you should not have done can help you remember to not do X in the future.

== History ==
Determinism has been established by the Greek philosophers, during the 7th and 6th centuries BC by the Presocratics Heraclitus, Leucippus and mainly by the Stoics with the universal causal determinism and Aristotle. Some of the main philosophers who have dealt with this issue are [[Marcus Aurelius]], [[Omar Khayyám]], [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[Baruch Spinoza]], [[Gottfried Leibniz]], [[David Hume]], [[Baron d'Holbach]] (Paul Heinrich Dietrich), [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]], [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], [[William James]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Albert Einstein]], [[Niels Bohr]], [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] and, more recently, [[John Searle]], [[Sam Harris]], [[Ted Honderich]], and [[Daniel Dennett]].

Mecca Chiesa notes that the [[probabilistic]] or selectionistic determinism of [[B.F. Skinner]] comprised a wholly separate conception of determinism that was not [[Mechanism (philosophy)|mechanistic]] at all. Mechanistic determinism assumes that every event has an unbroken chain of prior occurrences, but a selectionistic or probabilistic model does not.&lt;ref&gt;Chiesa, Mecca (2004) ''Radical Behaviorism: The Philosophy &amp; The Science''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ringen | first1 = J.

===Western tradition===
In the West, some elements of determinism have been expressed in Greece from the 6th century BC by the Presocratics Heraclitus&lt;ref&gt;Stobaeus ''Eclogae'' I 5 ([[Heraclitus]])&lt;/ref&gt;  and Leucippus.&lt;ref&gt;Stobaeus ''Eclogae'' I 4 ([[Leucippus]])&lt;/ref&gt; The first full-fledged notion of determinism appears to originate with the [[Stoics]], as part of their theory of universal causal determinism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Susanne Bobzien]] ''Determinism and Freedom in Stoic Philosophy'' (Oxford 1998) chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting philosophical debates, which involved the confluence of elements of Aristotelian Ethics with Stoic psychology, led in the 1st-3rd centuries CE in the works of [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]] to the first recorded Western debate over determinism and freedom,&lt;ref&gt;Susanne Bobzien ''The Inadvertent Conception and Late Birth of the Free-Will Problem'' (Phronesis 43, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; an issue that is known in theology as the [[Argument from free will|paradox of free will]]. The writings of [[Epictetus]] as well as [[Middle Platonist]] and early Christian thought were instrumental in this development.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Frede]] ''A Free Will: Origins of the Notion in Ancient Thought'' (Berkeley 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; The Jewish philosopher [[Moses Maimonides]] said of the deterministic implications of an omniscient god:&lt;ref&gt;Though Moses Maimonides was not arguing against the existence of God, but rather for the incompatibility between the full '''exercise''' by God of his [[omniscience]] and genuine human [[free will]], his argument is considered by some as affected by Modal Fallacy. See, in particular, the article by Prof. Norman Swartz for ''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', [http://www.iep.utm.edu/f/foreknow.htm Foreknowledge and Free Will] and specifically [http://www.iep.utm.edu/f/foreknow.htm#section6 Section 6: The Modal Fallacy]&lt;/ref&gt; "Does God know or does He not know that a certain individual will be good or bad? If thou sayest 'He knows', then it necessarily follows that [that] man is compelled to act as God knew beforehand he would act, otherwise God's knowledge would be imperfect.…"&lt;ref name=maimonides&gt;''The Eight Chapters of Maimonides on Ethics (Semonah Perakhim)'', edited, annotated, and translated with an Introduction by Joseph I. Gorfinkle, pp. 99–100. (New York: AMS Press), 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;

Determinism in the West is often associated with [[Newtonian physics]], which depicts the physical matter of the universe as operating according to a set of fixed, knowable laws. The "billiard ball" hypothesis, a product of Newtonian physics, argues that once the initial conditions of the universe have been established, the rest of the history of the universe follows inevitably. If it were actually possible to have complete knowledge of physical matter and all of the laws governing that matter at any one time, then it would be theoretically possible to compute the time and place of every event that will ever occur (''[[Laplace's demon]]''). In this sense, the basic particles of the universe operate in the same fashion as the rolling balls on a billiard table, moving and striking each other in predictable ways to produce predictable results.

Whether or not it is all-encompassing in so doing, Newtonian mechanics deals only with caused events, e.g.: If an object begins in a known position and is hit dead on by an object with some known velocity, then it will be pushed straight toward another predictable point. If it goes somewhere else, the Newtonians argue, one must question one's measurements of the original position of the object, the exact direction of the striking object, gravitational or other fields that were inadvertently ignored, etc. Then, they maintain, repeated experiments and improvements in accuracy will always bring one's observations closer to the theoretically predicted results. When dealing with situations on an ordinary human scale, Newtonian physics has been so enormously successful that it has no competition. But it fails spectacularly as velocities become some substantial fraction of the [[speed of light]] and when interactions at the atomic scale are studied. Before the discovery of [[Introduction to quantum mechanics|quantum]] effects and other challenges to Newtonian physics, "uncertainty" was always a term that applied to the accuracy of human knowledge about causes and effects, and not to the causes and effects themselves.

[[Newtonian mechanics]] as well as any following physical theories are results of observations and experiments, and so they describe "how it all works" within a tolerance. However, old western scientists believed if there are any logical connections found between an observed cause and effect, there must be also some absolute natural laws behind. Belief in perfect natural laws driving everything, instead of just describing what we should expect, led to searching for a set of universal simple laws that rule the world. This movement significantly encouraged deterministic views in western philosophy,&lt;ref&gt;Swartz, Norman (2003) The Concept of Physical Law / Chapter 10: Free Will and Determinism ( https://www.sfu.ca/philosophy/physical-law/)&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the related theological views of [[Classical Pantheism]].

=== Eastern tradition ===
{{Original research section|date=December 2010}}
The idea that the entire universe is a [[deterministic system (philosophy)|deterministic system]] has been articulated in both Eastern and non-Eastern religion, philosophy, and literature.

In ''[[I Ching]]'' and [[Philosophical Taoism]], the ebb and flow of favorable and unfavorable conditions suggests the path of least resistance is effortless (see [[wu wei]]).

In the philosophical schools of India, the concept of precise and continual effect of laws of [[Karma]] on the existence of all sentient beings is analogous to western deterministic concept. Karma is the concept of "action" or "deed" in Indian religions. It is understood as that which causes the entire cycle of cause and effect (i.e., the cycle called saṃsāra) originating in ancient India and treated in Hindu, Jain, and Sikh. Karma is considered predetermined and deterministic in the universe, and in combination with the decisions (free will) of living beings, accumulates to determine futuristic situations that the living being encounters. See [[Karma in Hinduism]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

=== Generative processes ===
{{Main article|Emergence}}
Although it was once thought by scientists that any indeterminism in quantum mechanics occurred at too small a scale to influence biological or neurological systems, there is indication that [[nervous system]]s are influenced by quantum indeterminism due to [[chaos theory]]{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}. It is unclear what implications this has for the problem of [[free will]] given various possible reactions to the problem in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1142/S0219635206001112 | last=Lewis | first=E.R. |author2=MacGregor, R.J. | year=2006 | title=On Indeterminism, Chaos, and Small Number Particle Systems in the Brain | journal=[[Journal of Integrative Neuroscience]] | volume=5 | issue=2 | pages=223–247 |url=http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~lewis/LewisMacGregor.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many biologists don't grant determinism: Christof Koch argues against it, and in favour of [[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|libertarian free will]], by making arguments based on generative processes ([[emergence]]).&lt;ref name=Koch&gt;{{cite book |last1=Koch |first1=Christof |authorlink1=Christof Koch |editor1-first=Nancy|editor1-last=Murphy |editor2-first=George |editor2-last=Ellis |editor3-first=Timothy|editor3-last=O'Connor |title=Downward Causation and the Neurobiology of Free Will |url= |date=September 2009 |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] |location=New York, USA|isbn=978-3-642-03204-2 |pages= |chapter=Free Will, Physics, Biology and the Brain}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other proponents of emergentist or [[emergence|generative philosophy]], [[cognitive science]]s and [[evolutionary psychology]], argue that a certain form of determinism (not necessarily causal) is true.&lt;ref name= "Kenrick"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kenrick | first1 = D.

[[File:Gospers glider gun.gif|thumb|right|120px|In [[Conway's Game of Life]], the interaction of just four simple rules creates patterns that seem somehow "alive".]]

As an illustration, the strategy board-games [[chess]] and [[Go (game)|Go]] have rigorous rules in which no information (such as cards' face-values) is hidden from either player and no [[randomness|random]] events (such as dice-rolling) happen within the game. Yet, chess and especially Go with its extremely simple deterministic rules, can still have an extremely large number of unpredictable moves. When chess is simplified to 7 or fewer pieces, however, endgame tables are available that dictate which moves to play to achieve a perfect game.  This implies that, given a less complex environment (with the original 32 pieces reduced to 7 or fewer pieces), a perfectly predictable game of chess is possible.  In this scenario, the winning player can announce that a checkmate will happen within a given number of moves, assuming a perfect defense by the losing player, or fewer moves if the defending player chooses sub-optimal moves as the game progresses into its inevitable, predicted conclusion. By this analogy, it is suggested, the experience of free will emerges from the interaction of finite rules and deterministic parameters that generate nearly infinite and practically unpredictable behavioural responses. In theory, if all these events could be accounted for, and there were a known way to evaluate these events, the seemingly unpredictable behaviour would become predictable.&lt;ref name= "Kenrick"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Nowak"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Axtell"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Epstein"/&gt; Another hands-on example of generative processes is [[John Horton Conway]]'s playable [[Conway's Game of Life|Game of Life]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bitstorm.org/gameoflife/ John Conway's Game of Life]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nassim Nicholas Taleb|Nassim Taleb]] is wary of such models, and coined the term "[[ludic fallacy]]".

=== Compatibility with the existence of science ===
Certain [[philosophy of science|philosophers of science]] argue that while causal determinism in which everything including the brain/mind is subject to the laws of causality is compatible with minds capable of science, fatalism and predestination is not. These philosophers make the distinction that causal determinism means that each step is determined by the step before and therefore allows sensory input from observational data to determine what conclusions the [[brain]] reaches, while fatalism in which the steps between do not connect an initial cause to the results would make it impossible for observational data to correct false hypotheses. This is often combined with the argument that if the brain had fixed views and the arguments were mere after-constructs with no causal effect on the conclusions, science would have been impossible and the use of arguments would have been a meaningless waste of energy with no persuasive effect on brains with fixed views.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Popper: Conjectures and refutations&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mathematical models ===
Many [[mathematical models]] of physical systems are deterministic. This is true of most models involving [[differential equations]] (notably, those measuring rate of change over time). Mathematical models that are not deterministic because they involve randomness are called [[stochastic]]. Because of [[sensitive dependence on initial conditions]], some deterministic models may appear to behave non-deterministically; in such cases, a deterministic interpretation of the model may not be useful due to [[numerical instability]] and a finite amount of [[accuracy and precision|precision]] in measurement. Such considerations can motivate the consideration of a stochastic model even though the underlying system is governed by deterministic equations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Werndl | first1 = Charlotte | year = 2009 | title = Are Deterministic Descriptions and Indeterministic Descriptions Observationally Equivalent? | doi = 10.1016/j.shpsb.2009.06.004 | journal = Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics | volume = 40 | issue = 3| pages = 232–242 | bibcode = 2009SHPMP..40..232W | arxiv = 1310.1615 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Werndl, Charlotte (2009).

=== Quantum and Classical Mechanics ===

====Day-to-day physics====
{{further information|Macroscopic quantum phenomena}}
Since the beginning of the 20th century, [[quantum mechanics]]—the physics of the extremely small—has revealed previously concealed aspects of [[Phenomenon|event]]s. Before that, [[classical mechanics|Newtonian physics]]—the physics of everyday life—dominated. Taken in isolation (rather than as an [[approximation]] to quantum mechanics), Newtonian physics depicts a universe in which objects move in perfectly determined ways. At the scale where humans exist and interact with the universe, Newtonian mechanics remain useful, and make relatively accurate predictions (e.g. calculating the trajectory of a bullet). But whereas in theory, [[Universality (philosophy)|absolute knowledge]] of the forces accelerating a bullet would produce an absolutely accurate prediction of its path, modern quantum mechanics casts reasonable doubt on this main thesis of determinism.

Relevant is the fact that [[certainty]] is never absolute in practice (and not just because of David Hume's [[problem of induction]]). The equations of Newtonian mechanics can exhibit sensitive dependence on initial conditions. This is an example of the [[butterfly effect]], which is one of the subjects of [[chaos theory]]. The idea is that something even as small as a butterfly could cause a chain reaction leading to a hurricane years later. Consequently, even a very small error in knowledge of initial conditions can result in arbitrarily large deviations from predicted behavior. Chaos theory thus explains why it may be practically impossible to [[predict]] real life, whether determinism is true or false. On the other hand, the issue may not be so much about human abilities to ''predict'' or attain ''certainty'' as much as it is the nature of reality itself. For that, a closer, scientific look at nature is necessary.

====[[Quantum realm]]====
Quantum physics works differently in many ways from Newtonian physics. Physicist [[Aaron D. O'Connell]] explains that understanding our universe, at such small scales as atoms, requires a different logic than day-to-day life does. O'Connell does not deny that it is all interconnected: the scale of human existence ultimately does emerge from the quantum scale. O'Connell argues that we must simply use different models and constructs when dealing with the quantum world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.ted.com/2011/06/02/struggling-with-quantum-logic-qa-with-aaron-oconnell/ "Struggling with quantum logic: Q&amp;A with Aaron O'Connell]&lt;/ref&gt; Quantum mechanics is the product of a careful application of the [[scientific method]], [[logic]] and [[empiricism]]. The [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]] is frequently confused with the [[observer effect (physics)|observer effect]]. The uncertainty principle actually describes how precisely we may measure the position and momentum of a particle at the same time &amp;mdash; if we increase the accuracy in measuring one quantity, we are forced to lose accuracy in measuring the other. "These uncertainty relations give us that measure of freedom from the limitations of classical concepts which is necessary for a consistent description of atomic processes."&lt;ref name="Heisenberg1930"&gt;{{cite book |first=Werner |last=Heisenberg |authorlink=Werner Heisenberg|year=1949 |title=Physikalische Prinzipien der Quantentheorie |trans-title=Physical Principles of Quantum Theory |location=Leipzig |publisher=Hirzel/University of Chicago Press |page=4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NzMBh4ZxKJsC&amp;pg=PA4|isbn=9780486601137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Double-slit experiment results Tanamura 2.jpg|thumb|right|Although it is not possible to predict the trajectory of any one particle, they all obey determined probabilities which do permit some prediction.]]
This is where [[statistical mechanics]] come into play, and where physicists begin to require rather unintuitive mental models: A particle's path simply cannot be exactly specified in its full quantum description. "Path" is a classical, practical attribute in our every day life, but one that quantum particles do not meaningfully possess. The probabilities discovered in quantum mechanics do nevertheless arise from measurement (of the perceived path of the particle). As [[Stephen Hawking]] explains, the result is not traditional determinism, but rather determined probabilities.&lt;ref name=GDesign&gt;[[The Grand Design (book)|Grand Design]] (2010), page 32: ''"the molecular basis of biology shows that biological processes are governed by the laws of physics and chemistry and therefore are as determined as the orbits of the planets...so it seems that we are no more than biological machines and that free will is just an illusion"'', and page 72: ''"Quantum physics might seem to undermine the idea that nature is governed by laws, but that is not the case. Instead it leads us to accept a new form of determinism: Given the state of a system at some time, the laws of nature determine the probabilities of various futures and pasts rather than determining the future and past with certainty."'' (discussing a [[Many worlds interpretation]])&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, a quantum particle may indeed trace an exact path, and the probability of finding the particles in that path is one (certain to be true). In fact, as far as prediction goes, the quantum development is at least as predictable as the classical motion, but the key is that it describes [[wave function]]s that cannot be easily expressed in ordinary language. As far as the thesis of determinism is concerned, these probabilities, at least, are quite determined. These findings from quantum mechanics have found many [[Quantum mechanics#Applications|applications]], and allow us to build [[transistors]] and [[lasers]]. Put another way: personal computers, Blu-ray players and the internet all work because humankind discovered the determined probabilities of the quantum world.&lt;ref name="WhatIsItGoodFor?"&gt;[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=everyday-quantum-physics Scientific American, "What is Quantum Mechanics Good For?"]&lt;/ref&gt; None of that should be taken to imply that other aspects of [[quantum mechanics]] are not still [[Interpretations of quantum mechanics|up for debate]].

On the topic of predictable probabilities, the [[double-slit experiment]]s are a popular example. [[Photon]]s are fired one-by-one through a double-slit apparatus at a distant screen. Curiously, they do not arrive at any single point, nor even the two points lined up with the slits (the way you might expect of bullets fired by a fixed gun at a distant target). Instead, the light arrives in varying concentrations at widely separated points, and the distribution of its collisions with the target can be calculated reliably. In that sense the behavior of light in this apparatus is deterministic, but there is no way to predict where in the resulting [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] pattern any individual [[photon]] will make its contribution (although, there may be ways to use [[weak measurement]] to acquire more information without violating the [[Uncertainty principle]]).

Some (including [[Albert Einstein]]) argue that our inability to predict any more than probabilities is simply due to ignorance.&lt;ref&gt;[[Albert Einstein]] insisted that, "I am convinced God does not play dice" in a private letter to [[Max Born]], 4 December 1926, [http://www.alberteinstein.info/db/ViewDetails.do?DocumentID=38009 Albert Einstein Archives] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819045822/http://www.alberteinstein.info/db/ViewDetails.do?DocumentID=38009 |date=19 August 2010 }} reel 8, item 180&lt;/ref&gt; The idea is that, beyond the conditions and laws we can observe or deduce, there are also hidden factors or "[[Hidden variable theory|hidden variable]]s" that determine ''absolutely'' in which order photons reach the detector screen. They argue that the course of the universe is absolutely determined, but that humans are screened from knowledge of the determinative factors. So, they say, it only appears that things proceed in a merely probabilistically determinative way. In actuality, they proceed in an absolutely deterministic way.

[[John S. Bell]] criticized Einstein's work in his famous [[Bell's Theorem]], which proved that quantum mechanics can make statistical predictions that would be violated if local hidden variables really existed. A number of experiments have tried to verify such predictions, and so far they do not appear to be violated. Improved continue to verify the result, including the 2015 "[[Bell test experiments#Hensen et al..2C Giustina et al..2C Shalm et al. .282015.29: .22loophole-free.22 Bell tests|Loophole Free Test]]" that plugged all known sources of error and the 2017 "[[Bell test experiments#Johannes Handsteiner et al. .282017.29: .22Cosmic Bell Test.22 - Measurement Settings from Milky Way Stars|Cosmic Bell Test]]" that based the experiment cosmic data streaming from different directions toward the Earth, precluding the possibility the sources of data could have had prior interactions. However, it is possible to augment quantum mechanics with non-local hidden variables to achieve a deterministic theory that is in agreement with experiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Jabs | first=Arthur | year=2016 | title= A conjecture concerning determinism, reduction, and measurement in quantum mechanics | doi= 10.1007/s40509-016-0077-7 | journal= Quantum Studies: Mathematics and Foundations | volume= 3 | issue= 4 | pages=279–292| arxiv=1204.0614 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An example is the [[Bohm interpretation]] of quantum mechanics. Bohm's Interpretation, though, violates special relativity and it is highly controversial whether or not it can be reconciled without giving up on determinism.

More advanced variations on these arguments include [[Quantum contextuality]], by Bell, [[Simon B. Kochen]] and [[Ernst Specker]] in which argues that hidden variable theories cannot be "sensible," which here means that the values of the hidden variables inherently depend on the devices used to measure them.

This debate is relevant because it is easy to imagine specific situations in which the arrival of an electron at a screen at a certain point and time would trigger one event, whereas its arrival at another point would trigger an entirely different event (e.g. see [[Schrödinger's cat]] - a thought experiment used as part of a deeper debate).

Thus, quantum physics casts reasonable doubt on the traditional determinism of classical, Newtonian physics in so far as reality does not seem to be absolutely determined. This was the subject of the famous [[Bohr–Einstein debates]] between Einstein and [[Niels Bohr]] and there is [[Interpretations of quantum mechanics#Comparison|still no consensus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bishop |first1=Robert C. |editor1-first=Robert |editor1-last=Kane |title=The Oxford Handbook of Free Will |edition=Second |year=2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford, New York |isbn=9780195399691 | oclc=653483691 |page=90 |chapter=Chaos, Indeterminism, and Free Will |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=kzcFDsWg0GEC&amp;pg=PA90 |quote=The key question is whether to understand the nature of this probability as epistemic or ontic. Along epistemic lines, one possibility is that there is some additional factor (i.e., a hidden mechanism) such that once we discover and understand this factor, we would be able to predict the observed behavior of the quantum stoplight with certainty (physicists call this approach a "hidden variable theory"; see, e.g., Bell 1987, 1–13, 29–39; Bohm 1952a, 1952b; Bohm and Hiley 1993; Bub 1997, 40–114, Holland 1993; see also the preceding essay in this volume by Hodgson). Or perhaps there is an interaction with the broader environment (e.g., neighboring buildings, trees) that we have not taken into account in our observations that explains how these probabilities arise (physicists call this approach decoherence or consistent histories&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;). Under either of these approaches, we would interpret the observed indeterminism in the behavior of stoplights as an expression of our ignorance about the actual workings. Under an ignorance interpretation, indeterminism would not be a fundamental feature of quantum stoplights, but merely epistemic in nature due to our lack of knowledge about the system. Quantum stoplights would turn to be deterministic after all.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baggott|first1=Jim E.|title=Beyond Measure: Modern Physics, Philosophy, and the Meaning of Quantum Theory|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, New York|isbn=0-19-852536-2|oclc=52486237|page=203|chapter=Complementarity and Entanglement|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=uVdjwsqrgz8C&amp;pg=PA203&amp;dq=scientific+consensus+determinism+bell+theorem&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4v8PUaL5MarK0QWk8oCwBw&amp;ved=0CFgQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=scientific%20consensus%20determinism%20bell%20theorem&amp;f=false|quote=So, was Einstein wrong? In the sense that the EPR paper argued in favour of an objective reality for each quantum particle in an entangled pair independent of the other and of the measuring device, the answer must be yes. But if we take a wider view and ask instead if Einstein was wrong to hold to the realist's belief that the physics of the universe should be objective and deterministic, we must acknowledge that we cannot answer such a question. It is in the nature of theoretical science that there can be no such thing as certainty. A theory is only 'true' for as long as the majority of the scientific community maintain a consensus view that the theory is the one best able to explain the observations. And the story of quantum theory is not over yet.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adequate determinism (see [[Determinism#Varieties|Varieties]], above) is the reason that Stephen Hawking calls [[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|Libertarian free will]] "just an illusion".&lt;ref name="GDesign"/&gt; see [[Free will]] for further discussions on this topic.

====Other matters of quantum determinism====
{{essay|section|date=November 2017}}
{{unsourced section|date=August 2018}}
[[File:HEUraniumC.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Chaotic radioactivity is the next explanatory challenge for physicists supporting determinism.]]
All uranium found on earth is thought to have been synthesized during a [[supernova]] explosion that occurred roughly 5 billion years ago. Even before the laws of quantum mechanics were developed to their present level, the [[radioactivity]] of such elements has posed a challenge to determinism due to its unpredictability. One gram of [[uranium-238]], a commonly occurring radioactive substance, contains some 2.5 x 10&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt; atoms. Each of these atoms are identical and indistinguishable according to all tests known to modern science. Yet about 12600 times a second, one of the atoms in that gram will decay, giving off an [[alpha particle]]. The challenge for determinism is to explain why and when decay occurs, since it does not seem to depend on external stimulus. Indeed, no extant theory of physics makes [[testable]] predictions of exactly when any given atom will decay. At best scientists can discover determined probabilities in the form of the element's [[half life]].

The time dependent [[Schrödinger equation]] gives the first time [[derivative]] of the [[quantum state]]. That is, it explicitly and uniquely predicts the development of the [[wave function]] with time.
::&lt;math&gt;i\hbar\frac{\partial\psi(x,t)}{\partial t} = - \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{\partial^2\psi(x,t)}{\partial x^2}+V(x)\psi&lt;/math&gt;
So if the wave function itself is reality (rather than probability of classical coordinates), then the unitary evolution of the wave function in quantum mechanics, can be said to be deterministic. But the unitary evolution of the wave function is not the entirety of quantum mechanics.

Asserting that quantum mechanics is deterministic by treating the wave function itself as reality might be thought to imply a [[Universal wavefunction|single wave function for the entire universe]], starting at the origin of the universe. Such a "wave function of everything" would carry the probabilities of not just the world we know, but every other possible world that could have evolved. For example, large voids in the distributions of [[galaxy|galaxies]] are believed by many cosmologists to have originated in quantum fluctuations during the big bang. (''See'' [[cosmic inflation]], [[primordial fluctuations]] and [[large-scale structure of the cosmos]].)

However, neither the posited reality nor the proven and extraordinary accuracy of the wave function and quantum mechanics at small scales can imply or reasonably suggest the existence of a single wave function for the entire universe. Quantum mechanics breaks down wherever gravity becomes significant, because nothing in the wave function, or in quantum mechanics, predicts anything at all about gravity. And this is obviously of great importance on larger scales.

Gravity is thought of as a large-scale force, with a longer reach than any other. But gravity becomes significant even at masses that are tiny compared to the mass of the universe.

A wave function the size of the universe might successfully model a universe with no gravity. Our universe, with gravity, is vastly different from what quantum mechanics alone predicts. To forget this is a colossal error.

[[Objective collapse theory|Objective collapse theories]], which involve a dynamic (and non-deterministic) collapse of the wave function (e.g. [[Ghirardi–Rimini–Weber theory]], [[Penrose interpretation]], or [[causal fermion system]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s) avoid these absurdities. The theory of [[causal fermion system]]s for example, is able to unify [[quantum mechanics]], [[general relativity]] and [[quantum field theory]], via a more fundamental theory that is non-linear, but gives rise to the linear behaviour of the wave function and also gives rise to the non-linear, non-deterministic, wave-function collapse. These theories suggest that a deeper understanding of the theory underlying quantum mechanics shows the universe is indeed non-deterministic at a fundamental level.

An '''election petition''' refers to the procedure for challenging the result of a [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliamentary]] election.

== Outcomes ==

When a petition is lodged against an election return, there are 4 possible outcomes:&lt;ref name="british-electoral-facts"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The election is declared '''void'''. The result is quashed and a writ is issued for a new election
# The election is held to have been '''undue''': the original return is quashed, and another candidate is declared to have been elected.
# The election is '''upheld''', and the member returned is found to have been duly elected.
# The petition is '''withdrawn'''. This may occur when the petitioner fails to attend a hearing, or when Parliament is dissolved before the petition process is complete

== History ==

Controverted elections had been originally tried by [[Select Committee (Westminster System)|select committees]], afterwards by the Committee of Privileges and Elections, and ultimately by the whole [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]], with scandalous partiality, but under the [[Parliamentary Elections Act 1770|Grenville Act of 1770]] (10 Geo III. c. 16), and other later acts, by select committees, so constituted as to form a more judicial tribunal. The influence of party bias, however, too obviously prevailed until 1839, when [[Robert Peel]] introduced an improved system of nomination, which distinctly raised the character of election committees; but a tribunal constituted of political partisans, however chosen, was still open to jealousy and suspicion, and at length, in 1868, the trial of election petitions was transferred to judges of the superior courts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Election |volume=7 |page=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; to whose determination the House gives effect, by the issue of new writs or otherwise. The House, however, still retains and exercises its jurisdiction in all cases not relegated, by statute, to the judges.

Petitions, which resulted in the election in a constituency being held void used to be common after every general election, but are now rare.

When an election was held void the House of Commons could seat another candidate, order a new writ issued to fill the vacancy or leave the writ unissued for a time, thus suspending the representation of a constituency. As the tolerance of corrupt elections became less during the 18th and 19th centuries, [[boroughs]] found to be corrupt could be punished by either changing the area and the qualifications for voting or disenfranchising the constituency completely.

Such mechanism also exists in [[Hong Kong]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.hk/blis_pdf.nsf/6799165D2FEE3FA94825755E0033E532/20514755D63B308D482575EF0017DD1E?OpenDocument&amp;bt=0 ]{{dead link|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; then a British colony, Australia and New Zealand or other (ex-)[[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] nations.

==Cases==
{{main article|List of UK Parliamentary election petitions}}

In 1961, [[Tony Benn]] was disqualified from taking up his seat after a [[by-election]] by an [[election court]] because he held a peerage.

In 1982, [[Seamus Mallon]] was disqualified from taking his seat in the [[Northern Ireland Assembly (1982)|Northern Ireland Assembly]] as he was a member of [[Seanad Éireann]], the upper chamber of the parliament of the [[Republic of Ireland]], at the time of his election.&lt;ref name=key&gt;{{cite web| url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1399874/Key-players.html | title = Key players | accessdate = 2010-05-29 | date = 2001-10-25 | publisher = ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent example of an election being held void was when the 1997 election of [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Winchester (constituency)|Winchester]], [[Mark Oaten]], ([[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]]) was contested by the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] candidate [[Gerry Malone]]. Oaten had won the seat by two votes, with 55 [[ballot paper]]s had been rejected by the [[returning officer]] because they had not been stamped properly. Malone lodged an election petition in the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] to contest the outcome. The petition was dealt with by special case in which Oaten joined. On 6 October 1997 Lord Justice Brooke ruled that the election was void: by a 1974 precedent the failure to stamp the ballots may have been the result of polling station staff forgetting, and had they been counted, Malone would have had a majority of two over Oaten.

Two election petitions were lodged after the General Election on 6 May 2010. The defeated Independent Rodney Connor, who lost in [[Fermanagh and South Tyrone (UK Parliament constituency)|Fermanagh and South Tyrone]] by four votes has lodged a petition seeking a recount with scrutiny,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/roundup/articles/2010/06/03/391563-connor-asks-high-court-for-election-recount/ |title=Connor asks High Court for election recount |last=Saunderson |first=Sarah |publisher=The Impartial Reporter |date=3 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eoni.org.uk/election_petition.pdf |title=Election petition submitted to the High Court of Northern Ireland |publisher=Electoral Office for Northern Ireland |accessdate=15 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721204432/http://www.eoni.org.uk/election_petition.pdf |archivedate=21 July 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the case began on 13 September 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eoni.org.uk/notice_of_election_court.pdf |title=Notice of Election Court |publisher=Electoral Office for Northern Ireland |accessdate=15 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721204403/http://www.eoni.org.uk/notice_of_election_court.pdf |archivedate=21 July 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12607">In [[United States constitutional law]], '''false statements of fact''' are an [[United States free speech exceptions|exception from protection]] of free speech under the [[First Amendment of the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]. In [[United States law]], a false statement of fact will not be exempt from some civil or criminal penalty, if a law has imposed one. This exception has evolved over time from a series of Supreme Court cases that dealt with issues such as [[libel]], [[slander]], and statutes which barred fraudulent solicitation of charitable donations.

A major limiting factor to this concrete First Amendment exception are statements made against public figures. In ''[[New York Times v. Sullivan]]'' (1964), the Court strongly suggested that even "deliberate lies" could not be punished if made against the government. Since that decision, many cases that have dealt with this rule have struggled to define the line of who actually is a 'public figure'. The Supreme Court has also extended this doctrine to non-political figures who are simply famous or well known in the media.

==Overview of the legal rule==
===Theoretical basis for exception===

The [[United States Supreme Court]] first articulated the basis for excluding false statements of fact from First Amendment protection in ''[[Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc.]]'' (1974). In that case, a monthly newspaper was sued by a policeman's attorney. The newspaper "contained serious inaccuracies" about the attorney; namely, that he was supporting the police system as a goal to entrench a Communist conspiracy in the United States.&lt;ref name=GERTZ/&gt; They held that a civil jury award against the newspaper was constitutional because "there is no constitutional value in false statements of fact".&lt;ref name=GERTZ/&gt; Justice [[Lewis F. Powell, Jr.|Powell]], in writing the [[majority opinion|decision of the Court]] reasoned that false statements do not "advance society's interest in 'uninhibited, robust, and wide-open debate'". Even though he conceded that some false statements were inevitable, that did not mean that a system of liability meant to deter such behavior was impermissible.&lt;ref name=VREMEDY/&gt; Society had some interest in ensuring that debate covered truthful matters, as a key element of public participation in a democracy.&lt;ref name=VFW/&gt;

===Basic substantive rule===

The legal rule itself – how to apply this exception – is complicated, as it is often dependent on ''who'' said the statement and ''which actor'' it was directed towards.&lt;ref name=VTHEORY/&gt; The analysis is thus different if the government or a public figure is the target of the false statement (where the speech may get more protection) than a private individual who is being attacked over a matter of their private life.&lt;ref name=DUN/&gt; Thus, a key starting point in the analysis will discuss the 'manner' and 'context' in which the statements were made.&lt;ref name=VRULE/&gt;

Professor [[Eugene Volokh]] of [[UCLA Law]] characterizes this context analysis as divided into five different areas. First, false statements of fact can lead to civil liability if they are "said with a sufficiently culpable mental state".&lt;ref name=VRULE/&gt; This possibly includes conscious lies about [[Stolen Valor Act|military service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cohen|2009|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second category is a subset of the first: ''knowingly'' false statements ([[false statement|deliberate lies]]).&lt;ref name=VRULE/&gt; This includes things like [[libel]] and [[slander]]. These sorts of statements are specifically punishable because they contain malice.&lt;ref name=VPOLICY/&gt; A third category are "negligently" false statements, which may "lead to [some] liability".&lt;ref name=VRULE/&gt; A fourth included set includes statements that only have a "provable false factual connotation" – that is, implicit statements of fact. The example Volokh uses is the statement that "Joe deserves to die" which in the ''context'' of a murder could be made to be a factual statement.&lt;ref name=VFW/&gt;

The fifth category is one that is not as firmly set by precedent: false statements, even deliberate lies, against the government may be protected.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; While some "[[sedition|seditious libel]]" may be able to be punished, political statements are likely protected.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cohen|2009|pp=5, 34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Remedies===

Punitive damages are sometimes available against an individual who made a public false statement of fact. Such damages are contingent on the plaintiff demonstrating "actual malice" (intent to do harm) in the [[litigation|lawsuit]].&lt;ref name=VREMEDY/&gt; Criminal liability, although uncommon, can be made although they are usually subject to the same limitations imposed on civil suits in terms of elements to be proven.&lt;ref&gt;[[Garrison v. Louisiana]], 379 U.S. 64 (1964).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Categories of analysis==
===Public officials/public concern===
False statements that are on matters of public concern and that defame public figures are unprotected if either the speaker has knowledge that his statements are false, there is a negligence in the statement, or there is "actual malice" to inflict harm.&lt;ref name=VFW/&gt; The "actual malice" test comes from the Supreme Court's decision ''[[New York Times v. Sullivan]]'' (1964). That case concerned an allegation of libel by L.B. Sullivan, a supervisor of the Montgomery, Alabama police department. Sullivan argued that a full-page advertisement in the New York Times incorrectly asserted that his police department let civil rights violations against blacks occur.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; The Court held that even if the advertisement was incorrect, the fact that there was no intent to harm Sullivan by the newspaper ("actual malice") meant that the lawsuit could not proceed.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; This specific standard of [[mens rea]] is specifically to be used in cases where such speech comments on a matter of public concern.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Camp|2005|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The basis for this ruling was the Court's fear that "a rule compelling the critic of official conduct to guarantee the truth of all his factual assertions" would lead to "self-[[censorship]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[New York Times v. Sullivan]], 376 U.S. at 279 (1964).&lt;/ref&gt; This determination altered the theory of the 'false statements' free speech exception. Even if a false statement generally would be harmful for public discourse, the Court quoted [[John Stuart Mill]] in arguing a false statement in this context would bring "the clearer perception and livelier impression of truth, produced by its collision with error".&lt;ref&gt;[[New York Times v. Sullivan]], 376 U.S. at 280 (1964).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Definition of public figures====

The Supreme Court has struggled to define who exactly is a public figure, but over fifty years of cases, a framework has become defined. The first grouping of public figures are government officials.&lt;ref name=VFW/&gt; The test of which government figures was articulated in the Court's ruling in ''[[Rosenblatt v. Baer]]'' (1966). In ''Rosenblatt'', the Court said that government positions subject to this rule were those in which the "public has an independent interest in the qualifications and performance of the person who holds it, beyond the general public interest in the qualifications and performance of all government employees".&lt;ref name=BAER/&gt; Additionally, a court must question whether the "employee's position is one which would involve public scrutiny and discussion of the person holding it".&lt;ref name=BAER/&gt; Along with government officials, the Supreme Court held in ''[[Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc.]]'' (1974) that people who "have assumed an influential role in ordering society" are considered public figures.&lt;ref name=GERTZ/&gt; This is the same for people who have "achieved...pervasive fame or notoriety" or who have "voluntarily injected themselves or been drawn into a particular public controversy".&lt;ref&gt;[[Time, Inc. v. Firestone]], 424 U.S. 448 (1976).&lt;/ref&gt; This has even been held to include [[Jerry Falwell]], a major religious figure in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hustler Magazine v. Falwell]], 485 U.S. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Issues "of public concern"====
The leading case on what an issue "of public concern" is ''[[Dun &amp; Bradstreet v. Greenmoss Builders]]'' (1985). In ''Dun &amp; Bradstreet'', the Supreme Court considered whether a credit reporting service which distributed fliers to their only five subscribers qualified as an action of "public concern". As it was "hardly and unlikely to be deterred by incidental state regulation", the Court concluded it did not qualify.&lt;ref name=DUN/&gt; This decision did not provide strong guidance on the issue.&lt;ref name=PCV/&gt;

This vague area of law in regards to false statements of fact can lead to a variety of arguments over what is relevant or has public importance.&lt;ref name=PCV/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Monitor Patriot Co. v. Roy]], 401 U.S. 265 (1971).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Private individuals/public concern===
In ''[[Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc.]]'' (1974), the Supreme Court considered an article published in a magazine published by the [[John Birch Society]]. The article contained inaccuracies about a private individual, in this case the attorney for a policeman. The Court held that because plaintiff Gertz had not "thrust himself into the vortex of this public issue", the newspaper could not be freed from liability of their false statements.&lt;ref name=GERTZ/&gt; That standard of being put into the public spotlight was used in ''[[Snyder v. Phelps]]'' (2010), which permitted false statements about a dead [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] because those comments were in the midst of a public debate about war.&lt;ref&gt;[[Snyder v. Phelps]] (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

In cases which fall into this category, "actual malice" is the standard for a plaintiff to gain compensation at a trial.&lt;ref name=GERTZ/&gt;&lt;ref name="VPOLICY"/&gt;

===Private individuals/private concern===
The most ambiguous area of analysis for false statements of fact are cases that involve private individuals and speech about a private concern.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Volokh|2008|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most likely, a standard of strict liability would attach to speech under this section.&lt;ref name=VFW/&gt; Broadly speaking, this category includes speech that doesn't fit the limits of the "false statements of fact" free speech exception, meaning that such speech is not protected.&lt;ref name=GERTZ/&gt;

'''Forced circumcision''' refers to [[circumcision]] of [[man|males]] who have not given their [[consent]] to the procedure. In a [[Bible|biblical]] context, the term is used especially in relation to [[Paul the Apostle]] and his [[polemic]]s against the [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity|forced circumcision of gentile Christians]].&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Dunn, ''Paul and the Mosaic Law'', p. 265; Tomson, "Transformations of Post-70 Judaism," p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; Among adults, forced circumcisions have occurred in a wide range of situations, most notably in the [[Forced conversion to Islam|compulsory conversion of non-Muslims to Islam]]&lt;ref&gt;"Although the Qur'an speaks against forced conversion, such conversions of Christians and Jews took place under Muslim rule until the early decades of the twentieth century." Lerner, ''Religion, Secular Beliefs and Human Rights'', p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt; and the forced circumcision of [[Teso people|Teso]], [[Turkana people|Turkana]] and [[Luo people of Kenya and Tanzania|Luo]] men in [[Kenya]], as well as the abduction of [[South Africa]]n teenage boys to so-called circumcision schools ("bush schools").&lt;ref&gt;On occurrences of forced circumcision in Kenya, see Glazier, ''Land and the Uses of Traditions'', p. 25; Wamwere, ''I Refuse to Die'', p. 149, passim; Karimi and Ochieng, ''The Kenyatta Succession'', p. 13; Rutten and Owuor, "Weapons of mass destruction"; Kagwanja, "Courting genocide." Regarding the situation in South Africa, see Ndangam, ''Lifting the Cloak'', pp. 211-213; Meintjies, ''Manhood at a Price''; Mayatula and Mavundla, "A review on male circumcision procedures"; Crowly and Kesner, "Ritual Circumcision."&lt;/ref&gt; In South Africa, custom allows uncircumcised [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]]-speaking men past the age of circumcision (i.e., 25 years or older) to be overpowered by other men and forcibly circumcised.&lt;ref&gt;Funani, ''Circumcision among the Ama-Xhosa'', p. v.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and contemporary forced circumcision==

===Hasmonean Kingdom (140 BCE–37 BCE)===
{{see also|Hasmonean Kingdom}}
[[1 Maccabees]] relates the story of how [[Mattathias]] (ca. 166 BC) forcibly circumcised the sons of [[Jews|Jewish]] parents who had abandoned the rite.&lt;ref&gt;"And Mattathias and his friends went around and tore down the altars; they forcibly circumcised all the uncircumcised boys that they found within the borders of Israel " (1 Macc. 2:45-46, New Revised Standard Version).&lt;/ref&gt; Forced circumcision of Gentiles by Jews is attested from the second century BC onwards. In 125 BC [[John Hyrcanus]] conquered [[Edom]], which the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] called Idumea; and the Idumeans were converted to Judaism. As reported by [[Josephus]], circumcision was required of the Idumeans as a token of their acceptance of Judaism:

{{blockquote|Hyrcanus took also Dora and Marissa, cities of Idumea, and subdued all the Idumeans; and permitted them to stay in that country, if they would circumcise their genitals, and make use of the laws of the Jews; and they were so desirous of living in the country of their forefathers, that they submitted to the use of circumcision, and the rest of the Jewish ways of living; at which time therefore this befell them, that they were hereafter no other than Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'' XIII 9:1, 254 ff; see, e.g., Cohen, ''The Beginnings of Jewishness'', pp. 110-111; Taus, ''Torah for Today'', p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Scholars disagree on the interpretation of the sources. For example, Steven Weitzman believes the Idumeans were forcibly circumcised for political, not religious, reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Weitzman, "Forced Circumcision."&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Shaye J. D. Cohen]], "[[Ptolemy]]'s claim, that the Idumaeans were compelled to be circumcised and to adopt Jewish ways, is a simplified account of what these urban Idumaeans experienced."&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, "Religion, Ethnicity, and Hellenism," p. 216&lt;/ref&gt;
During the short reign of Hyrcanus' eldest son, [[Aristobulus I]] (104-103 BC), the [[Hasmonean]]s gained control of [[Galilee]]. In this case, too, sources indicate that the residents were subjected to forced circumcision.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Fiensy, ''New Testament Introduction'', p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Archaeology|Archaeological]] evidence suggests that, during this period, Gentiles fled from Galilee to avoid being forcibly circumcised.&lt;ref&gt;Charlesworth, "Why Evaluate Twenty-five Years," pp. 10-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman Empire===
{{see also|History of the Jews in the Roman Empire}}
Greeks and Romans regarded circumcision as a mutilation of the [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Phallic sexuality|male genitalia]], but the practice is little discussed in [[Latin literature|Roman literary sources]] until the second century of the Christian era.&lt;ref&gt;Juvenal 14.103–104; [[Tacitus]], ''Historia'' 5.5.1–2; Martial 7.30.5, 7.35.3–4, 7.82.5–6, 11.94; Margaret Williams, "Jews and Jewish Communities in the Roman Empire," in ''Experiencing Rome: Culture, Identity and Power in the Roman Empire'' (Routledge, 2000), p. 325; Mary Smallwood, ''The Jews under Roman Rule: From Pompey to Diocletian'' (Brill, 1976), p. 431; Jack N. Lightstone, "Roman Diaspora Religion," in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'' (Blackwell, 2007), p. 362.&lt;/ref&gt; There was a [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity|circumcision controversy in Early Christianity]] but this was resolved at the [[Council of Jerusalem]] c.50 which made it clear that circumcision of gentile converts to Christianity was not required.&lt;ref&gt;Acts 15: 5-21&lt;/ref&gt; Josephus (who changed his allegiance from the Jews to the Roman [[Flavians]]) reports that two Roman officers who had taken refuge with Galileans during the war with Rome (early 67 AD) were put under pressure to convert to Judaism. Josephus, declaring that "every one should worship God in accordance with the dictates of his own conscience," claims to have saved the two Gentiles from forced circumcision.&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''Life'' 23 §113; see also Goodman, "Galilean Judaism," p. 602; Donaldson, ''Paul and the Gentiles'', p. 323.&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[First Roman-Jewish War]], a head tax, the [[Fiscus Judaicus]], was levied against all Jews. According to [[Suetonius]], [[Domitian]] (c.90) also applied this tax to those who were circumcisied, even if they claimed they were not Jews. [[Titus Flavius Clemens (consul)]] was put to death in 95 for adopting Jewish customs. In 96 [[Nerva]] relaxed the Jewish tax as applying only to those who professed to be Jews. Sometime between 128 and 132 AD, the emperor [[Hadrian]] seems to have temporarily banned circumcision, on pain of death.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Schäfer, ''The History of the Jews in the Greco-Roman World'' (Routledge, 1983, 2003), p. 150, and ''Judeophobia: Attitudes toward Jews in the Ancient World'' (Harvard University Press, 1997), p. 103, pointing out this depends on a single note on the ban as a cause for the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]] in the ''[[Historia Augusta]]'', the historical credibility of which is often cast in doubt. [[Cassius Dio]] mentions nothing about circumcision in his account of the revolt. See also Smallwood, ''The Jews under Roman Rule'', pp. 430–431, who thinks the ban makes more sense as a punitive measure after the revolt, since it "ran completely counter to the long established Roman policy of guaranteeing Jewish religious liberty."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Antoninus Pius]] exempted Jews from the ban,&lt;ref&gt;Schäfer, ''The History of the Jews'', p. 150; Smallwood, ''The Jews under Roman Rule'', p. 467.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Ancient Egyptian religion|Egyptian priests]],&lt;ref&gt;Smallwood, ''The Jews under Roman Rule'', p. 470.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Origen]] (d. ''ca.'' 253) says that in his time only Jews were permitted to practice circumcision.&lt;ref&gt;Schäfer, ''Judeophobia'', p. 103. Smallwood, ''The Jews under Roman Rule'', p. 469, takes Origen as meaning that circumcision was "a solely Jewish rite" by his time.&lt;/ref&gt; Legislation under [[Constantine I|Constantine]], the first Christian emperor, freed any slave who was subjected to circumcision; in the year 339, circumcising a slave became punishable by death.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Schäfer, ''The History of the Jews'', p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Greco-Roman writers view circumcision as an identifying characteristic of Jews, they believed the practice to have originated in Egypt,&lt;ref&gt;Several Greco-Roman writers, such as [[Strabo]], regarded the Jews as of Egyptian descent, in what was apparently their understanding of [[the Exodus]]: Schäfer, ''Judeophobia'', pp. 93–94.&lt;/ref&gt; and recorded it among peoples they identified as [[Pre-Islamic Arabia|Arab]], [[Syria (Roman province)|Syrian]], [[Phoenicians|Phoenician]], [[Colchis|Colchian]], and [[History of Ethiopia#Classical Antiquity|Ethiopian]]; circumcision was a marker of "the Other".&lt;ref&gt;Smallwood, ''The Jews under Roman Rule'', p. 430; Schäfer, ''Judeophobia'', pp. 93–94.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jewish diaspora|Diaspora Jews]] might circumcise their male slaves as well as [[Conversion to Judaism|adult male converts]] and Jewish male infants.&lt;ref&gt;Lightstone, "Roman Diaspora Judaism," p. 363.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Catherine Hezser, it is an open question whether Jews of [[late antiquity]] refrained from forcibly circumcising their Gentile slaves and whether Romans avoided selling their slaves to Jews in reaction to the prohibition.&lt;ref&gt;Hezser, ''Jewish Slavery in Antiquity'', p. 42; see also Hezser, "Slaves and Slavery."&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mishnah]] (compiled about 200 AD) is silent on this point, whereas the [[Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael|Mekhilta de-Rabbi Ishmael]] (written at the end of the fourth century or later) suggests that Jews might indeed possess uncircumcised slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Schorsch, ''Jews and Blacks'', p. 378, n. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asia and North Africa===
Forced conversions, involving forced circumcision, are echoed in a vast body of [[scholarly method|scholarly]] literature spanning the entire history of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Lerner, ''Religion, Secular Beliefs, and Human Rights'', p. 142; Ye'or, ''The Decline of Eastern Christianity'', pp. 88-91; Stark, ''God's Battalions'', p. 28; Clarence-Smith, ''Islam'', p. 39, passim; Misra, ''Identity and Religion'', p. 91, passim.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars conclude that, during the [[Umayyad conquest of North Africa|Islamic conquest of the Middle East and North Africa]], forced conversion to Islam through violence or threat of violence did not play a key role. However, [[tax]]es and regulations requiring the holders of prestigious positions to become Muslims have been regarded as a form of forced conversion.&lt;ref&gt;Firestone, ''An Introduction to Islam'', p. 58; see also Misra, ''Identity and Religion'', p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt;

====South Asia====
In the aftermath of the [[Battle of Pollilur|1780 Battle of Pollilur]], 7,000 British soldiers were held imprisoned by [[Hyder Ali|Haidar Ali]] and Tipu Sultan in the fortress of [[Srirangapatna|Seringapatnam]]. Of these, more than 300 were forcibly circumcised.&lt;ref&gt;Darby, ''A Surgical Temptation'', pp. 32-33; see also Oddy, ''Religion in South Asia'', p. 42, passim.&lt;/ref&gt; Cromwell Massey, who kept a secret diary during his captivity, wrote: "I lost with the foreskin of my yard all those benefits of a Christian and Englishman which were and ever shall be my greatest glory."&lt;ref&gt;Colley, ''Captives'', p. 288.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adolescence|Adolescent]] captives were, in addition to being circumcised, made to wear female clothes. James Bristow, a teenage [[artillery]]man, revenged himself by circumcising [[dog]]s, believing that this would harm the religious feelings of the Muslim warders. The prospect of punishment did not deter him, because "compelling us to undergo an abhorred operation [was] so base and barbarous an act of aggression, that it was impossible to reflect on it with temper."&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence, ''Captives of Tipu'', p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Scurry]], also a prisoner of war, confirms in his book, ''The Captivity, Sufferings, and Escape of James Scurry'' (1824), that English soldiers, [[Mangalorean Catholics]], and other prisoners were forcibly circumcised.&lt;ref name=Bowring&gt;{{cite book

In 1784, when Tipu returned from [[Mangalore]], he brought back tens of thousands of Mangalorean Catholics from [[Kanara]] and subjected them to forced circumcision.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Naravane, ''Battles'', p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; A Hindi idiom 'Mar-mar ke Musalman bana' (meaning 'make Muslim by repeated beating') can be traced to originate from forcible conversion of Hindus.

According to Kativa Daiya, during the 1947 [[partition of India]] "[f]orced circumcision, shaving facial and head hair (for [[Sikh]] men), and shaving off the Hindu [[Brahmin]]'s traditional, short, plaited hair (on an otherwise bald head) were routine Muslim conversion tactics for men and boys."&lt;ref&gt;Daiya, ''Violent Belongings'', pp. 69-70.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Asia News'' reported in 2004 that the Justice and Peace Commission of Lahor spoke out against young non-Muslim men in [[Pakistan]] being converted and circumcised against their will.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asianews.it/news-en/Christian-minorities-in-Pakistan:-little-freedom-and-rising-Islamic-pressure-1583.html |title=Christian minorities in Pakistan: little freedom and rising Islamic pressure |date=9 March 2004 |publisher=AsiaNews.it |accessdate=5 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the ''Gulf Times'' discussed a case of forced circumcision of [[Nepal]]ese boys in [[Mumbai]] in the context of sex trade in large Indian cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

====Iraq====
[[Iraq]]i [[Mandaeism|Mandaeans]], residing almost exclusively in [[Baghdad]] and [[Basra]], do not circumcise.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Lupieri, ''The Mandaeans''.&lt;/ref&gt; However, their religious sensitivity on this issue has not prevented hostile rulers from subjecting Mandaean men and boys to forced circumcision.&lt;ref&gt;Buckley, ''The Great Stem of Souls'', pp. 149-150.&lt;/ref&gt; Mandaean communities, especially after the invasion of Iraq, have been subject to "murder, kidnapping, rape, forced conversion, forced circumcision and destruction of religious property."&lt;ref&gt;Nickerson et al., "The impact of fear"; see also Nickerson et al., "Fear of Cultural Extinction."&lt;/ref&gt;

In Iraq in 2003, shortly after the fall of the Saddam regime, the thirty-five families who made up the Mandean community in Fallujia were ordered at gunpoint to adopt Islam; the men were forcibly circumcised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arabwashingtonian.org/english/article.php?issue=4&amp;articleID=71 |title=The Rape of Basra: Cleansing the Iraqi Mandaeans |author=C.G.

Those who resisted were summarily executed." |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623041759/http://www.arabwashingtonian.org/english/article.php?issue=4&amp;articleID=71 |archivedate=23 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 the US Committee on International Religious Freedom heard testimony reporting: "Forced conversion is happening in an alarming degree. Boys are being kidnapped, forcibly circumcised - a major sin in the Mandaean religion - and forcibly converted to Islam."&lt;ref&gt;Testimony of Dr Suhaib Nashi at the [[United States Commission on International Religious Freedom]] Hearing on Threats to Iraq's Communities of Antiquity, 25 July 2007; see [http://www.uscirf.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1268&amp;Itemid=114 USCIRF press release], "USCIRF Hearing: Threats to Iraq's Communities of Antiquity," July 25, 2007 (issued by Judith Ingram).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, after the exodus of the [[Christianity in Iraq|Christians]] from [[Mosul]] and the [[Yazidi|Yazidi's]] from [[Sinjar Mountains|Mount Sinjar]], it was reported that forced circumcisions were taking place conducted by the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|Islamic State]] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.tunisiadaily.com/2014/08/16/irak-circoncisions-de-chretiens-et-700-femmes-yazidies-vendues-a-150-dollars-piece/&lt;/ref&gt;

====Anatolia====

=====The Ottoman Empire=====
There are accounts of Christian boys abducted and forcibly circumcised even in the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques, ''The Albanians'', p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1829, 9 year old Greek boy Alexandros Kitos and other young boys were kidnapped by Ottoman soldiers and sold into slavery in Egypt, all were circumcised against their will.&lt;ref&gt;The Greek War of Independence the struggle for freedom from Ottoman oppression pg. 110&lt;/ref&gt;

It is well established that, before and during the [[Armenian Genocide]], forced conversions (involving forced circumcisions) of [[Armenia]]n boys and men were frequent.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Bobelian, ''Children of Armenia'', pp. 28-29.&lt;/ref&gt; "In many cases young Armenian children were spared from deportation by local Turks who took them from their families. The children were coerced into denouncing Christianity and becoming Muslims, and were then given new Turkish names. For Armenian boys the forced conversion meant they each had to endure painful circumcision as required by Islamic custom."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historyplace.com/worldhistory/genocide/armenians.htm |title=Armenians in Turkey 1915-1918 1,5000,000 |year=2000 |publisher=The History Place |accessdate=5 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Turkey====
During the [[Istanbul Pogrom]] in September 1955, "many [[Greece|Greek]] men, including at least one [[priest]], were subjected to forced circumcision."&lt;ref&gt;Zayas, "The Istanbul Pogrom"; see also Vryonis, ''The Mechanism of Catastrophe'', pp. 224-226, passim.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the pogrom, the Greek minority eventually emigrated from [[Turkey]]. In 2002 there was a report that non-Muslim army recruits in Turkey had been threatened with forced circumcision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.armenian.ch/gsa/Docs/faae02.pdf |title=Armenians in Turkey Today: A critical assessment of the situation of the Armenian minority in the Turkish Republic |author=Dr Tessa Hofmann |date=October 2002 |publisher= The EU Office of Armenian Associations of Europe|accessdate=3 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cases are documented where Syro-Orthodox men serving in the Turkish military forces have been threatened with forced circumcision.&lt;ref&gt;Carlier, ''Who Is a Refugee'', pp. 128-129, 132.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, a young Christian Turk, fleeing from forced circumcision in the Turkish military forces, was granted [[Asylum in Germany|asylum in]] [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;Zabus, ''Between Rites and Rights'', p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Yazidi]] (not all of whom are circumcised) in Turkey have for years been subjected to direct state persecution, including compulsory religious instruction at school, forced conversion, forced circumcision, and mistreatment during military service.&lt;ref&gt;Carlier, ''Who Is a Refugee'', p. 150, n. 203; see also Jwaideh, ''The Kurdish National Movement'', p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999 there was a report of the forced circumcision of Yedizi men in Turkish Kurdistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.let.uu.nl/~martin.vanbruinessen/personal/publications/Violence.htm#_ftn5 |title=The nature and uses of violence in the Kurdish conflict |author=Martin van Bruinessen, Utrecht University |date=July 1999 |work=Paper presented at the International colloquium "Ethnic Construction and Political Violence", organized by the Fondazione Giangiacomo Feltrinelli, Cortona, July 2–3, 1999 |publisher=Universiteit Utrecht |accessdate=3 October 2010 |quote=The Yezidi religious minority has suffered similar but perhaps even more severe forms of oppression than the Christian communities.

John Rawlins had sailed for 23 years without incident when, in 1621, he and his crew were kidnapped by pirates from the [[Barbary Coast]] of North Africa. Rawlins later reported that, after being taken to Algiers, two younger men were "by force and torment ... compelled ... to turn Turks," which means that they were forcibly circumcised.&lt;ref&gt;Fuller, "John Rawlins"; see also DiPiero, ''White Men Aren't'', p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; By organizing a successful [[mutiny]], he was able to return home in 1622.
The Portuguese Friar Jaono dos Sanctos claimed that, annually in Algiers in the 1620s, more than nine hundred Christian slaves were converted to Islam, "besides about fifty boys yearly circumcised against their wills."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Davis, ''Christian Slaves, Muslim Masters'', p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Maluku Islands=====
Thousands of Christians were forcibly circumcised in the [[Maluku Islands|Moluccas]] from December 1999 to January 2001.&lt;ref&gt;Lipton, ''Religious Freedom in Asia'', p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; The Sydney Morning Herald reported in detail on this, stating that "almost all" of 3,928 villagers forced to convert to Islam were circumcised.  Razors and knives were reused, causing infections.&lt;ref name="murdoch-smh"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of those circumcised, Kostantinus Idi, reported: "I could not escape," he said. "One of them held up my foreskin between pieces of wood while another cut me with a razor ...the third man held my head back, ready to pour water down my throat if I screamed. But I couldn't help but scream and he poured the water. I kept screaming aloud and vomited. I couldn't stand the pain." He further reported that one of the clerics urinated on his wound, saying it would stop infection. The Sydney Morning Herald reported that the forced conversions and forced circumcisions had been condemned by moderate Muslim leaders who said they were contrary to Islamic teachings. The local governor had also investigated the incidents.&lt;ref name="murdoch-smh"/&gt;

[[Marco Polo]], in his ''Travels'', relates how a Christian king of [[Ethiopia]] took revenge on the Sultan of Aden, who had forcibly circumcised a [[bishop]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Travels of Marco Polo'', Book 3, Chapter 35; see also Strickland, ''Saracens, Demons, &amp; Jews'', p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Kenya====
In Kenya, most tribes circumcise. Luo men from Western Kenya are a significant exception, for which reason they have regularly been subjected to forced circumcision.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Glazier, ''Land and the Uses of Traditions'', p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2002, following a violent incident in [[Butere/Mumias District]], a district commissioner instructed the police to "crack down on traditional surgeons involved in forcible circumcision."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cirp.org/news/thenation08-23-02/|title=Man Forcibly Circumcised As Crowd Watches|last=|first=|date=2002-08-23|website=|publisher=''The Nation'', Nairobi, Kenya|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2010-10-07|quote=&lt;p&gt;A man was yesterday forcibly circumcised by traditional surgeons in Mumias-Butere District as police watched helplessly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr John Otieko... was cornered by a mob ... stripped naked, frog-marched to a nearby river and covered with clay ... then brought to Mayoni trading centre ... to be circumcised as an excited crowd watched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Efforts by four traffic police officers who were manning a roadblock on the highway a few metres away from the scene failed when the crowd started stoning them. The victim was then left bleeding at the scene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;District Commissioner Ernest Munyi expressed shock at the incident and told police to crack down on traditional surgeons involved in forcible circumcision.&lt;/p&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2005, the [[Kenyan Human Rights Commission]] announced that it would seek prosecutions against politicians for inciting such violence. In one instance, a cabinet minister had said, "Those who are not circumcised should be taken for a circumcision ceremony." The Commission said this amounted to an incitement to violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In late January 2008, a disputed election in which circumcision became an issue between President Mwai Kibaki, a Kikuyu and opposition candidate Raila Odinga, a Luo, "the fact that Odinga was uncircumcised became an issue: He was seen by some Kikuyus as a 'child' unfit to rule because he had not passed through circumcision and initiation." Post-election violence reportedly "focused on tribal animosities", and included several cases of forced circumcision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In September 2010, at Malaba, West Kenya, a 21-year-old Teso man was lured to a hotel, drugged, smeared with fermented millet flour and was being led away by several Bukusu to be circumcised when the police intervened. The Teso man, who agreed to a medical circumcision, condemned the Bukusu youths for trying to impose their culture on the Teso. Three weeks previously, village neighbours in Aedomoru sub location in Teso north armed themselves with clubs and prevented a 35-year-old man from being forcibly circumcised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 1999, a woman who was feared throughout the Vaal Triangle district of South Africa, controlled a gang of kidnappers that abducted young people, forcibly circumcising the boys and extorting ransoms from their parents for their release. A local police officer said as many as 10 teenagers had been snatched every day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In December 2004, 45-year-old Nceba Cekiso was caught and circumcised against his will. The report in the ''[[Cape Argus]]'' noted, &lt;blockquote&gt;"Xhosa culture allows people to forcibly circumcise boys deemed to be past the age of initiation... Forcing people do undergo the ancient ritual ... has, in recent times, caused concern among human rights organisations... (In) one instance two Rastafarians objected to the procedure on religious grounds. The incident has sparked a debate on whether or not traditionalists should still be allowed to force people against their will into the bush to undergo initiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Despite being medically circumcised, a Christian Xhosa was forcibly recircumcised by his father and community leaders in 2007. He laid a charge of unfair discrimination on the grounds of his religious beliefs, seeking an apology from his father and the Congress of Traditional Leaders of South Africa. In the settlement that was reached, and which was made an order of the Equality Court, the Congress of Traditional Leaders accepted the right of adult males to choose whether to attend traditional circumcision schools according to their religious beliefs. It apologised for the comments made by its former chairman encouraging the ostracism of teenagers who refused to undergo traditional circumcision. The judge declared, "What is important in terms of the Constitution and law is that no one can be forced to submit to circumcision without his consent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

====Sudan====
There is ample evidence that, for years, Christians of [[Khartoum]] and elsewhere in [[Sudan]] have been forcefully converted to Islam, and that Christian men and boys have been forcibly circumcised.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/3df4bea71c.html "Sudan: Reports of Catholic residents of Khartoum or elsewhere in Sudan being forcefully converted to Islam"], Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada, 19 October 2001, and references therein; see also Akol, ''Burden of Nationality'', pp. 25-72. According to the ''Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2000'', February 2001 (United States Department of State, Washington, DC), non-Muslim Sudanese boys kidnapped off the streets have undergone forced circumcision in government camps and juvenile houses; see {{cite web

====Uganda====
In 1885, [[Mwanga II of Buganda|Kabaka Mwanga]] ordered the murders of Bishop [[James Hannington]] and many local Christians. During the following period, Islamization led to several Christians being forcibly circumcised.&lt;ref&gt;Otiso, ''Culture and Customs of Uganda'', p. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt;

As discussed by [[anthropology|anthropologist]] Suzette Heald and other scholars, the [[Gisu people|Gisu]] (alternatively, Bagishu) of [[Uganda]] "take pride in not tolerating uncircumcised men." For this reason, in Gisu society, any boy or man who has been able to escape ritual circumcision (called "imbalu") faces the prospect of being forcibly circumcised.&lt;ref&gt;Heald, ''Manhood and Morality'', p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Voice of America, referring to the same practice, reports: "Among the Bagishu, uncircumcised men are treated with contempt; they are not allowed in society and in most cases they are seen as failing to get local women for marriage. This is supported by all the Bagishu including women who often report uncircumcised men to tribal elders. It's considered traditional that no male is to escape the ritual regardless of where he lives, what he does or what kind of security he has."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Australia===
Traditional circumcision is still practised in some tribal areas of [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., DeMello, ''Encyclopedia'', p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; Linguist and anthropologist Peter Sutton, commenting on forced circumcision and the absence of law enforcement in remote settlements, claims that Australian law has been applied in a patchy way: "Involuntary circumcision has long been widely accepted as being de facto outside the scope of Australian law."&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, ''The Politics of Suffering'', p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; Late in 1996, 34-year-old Irwin Brookdale was drinking with a group of [[Australian Aborigines]] on the banks of a river in far north Queensland. After he passed out, a woman in the group felt down his pants, found that he was not circumcised and called on her companions to "make a man out of him." They attempted to circumcise him with a broken beer bottle. Brookdale ended up in hospital, one of his assailants was convicted of unlawful wounding and Brookdale was awarded A$10,000 compensation for nervous shock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

====Breakup of Yugoslavia====
The [[breakup of Yugoslavia]], according to Milica Z. Bookman, "was extremely violent, producing some two million refugees, over 100,000 killed, and evidence of gang rape, impaling, dismemberment and forced circumcision."&lt;ref&gt;Bookman, "War and Peace."&lt;/ref&gt;

The US Department of State reported that Muslim and Mujahedin irregular troops  "had routinely performed crude, disfiguring, nonmedical circumcisions on Bosnian Serb soldiers." One 18-year-old Bosnian Serb soldier "was so brutally circumcised that eventually the entire organ required amputation."&lt;ref&gt;''Fourth Report on War Crimes in the Former Yugoslavia: Part II—Torture of Prisoners'', US Department of State Dispatch, vol. 3, no. 52, 28 December 1992, quoted in Kohlmann, ''Al-Qaida's Jihad in Europe'', p. 30.

'''Formal sociology''' is a [[scientific approach]] to sociology developed by [[Georg Simmel]] and [[Leopold von Wiese]].&lt;ref&gt;Formal Sociology: The Sociology of Georg Simmel (Schools of Thought in Sociology), Larry Ray, Edward Elgar Pub, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; In his studies, Simmel was more focused on forms of social interactions rather than content. This is why his approach to sociology became labeled as formal sociology. In formal sociology, one formal concept can be applied to understand various events. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://socio.ch/sim/work.htm|title=Georg Simmel: Work|website=socio.ch|access-date=2018-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; From Simmel's point of view, one form of a social phenomenon is always associated with many formal events. The aim of formal sociology is to reveal that although the process of social interaction may be very complex, the social forms of these interactions can be isolated and may even be found to be identical. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

He achieved wide recognition in his day and—while primarily influential within the [[Continental philosophy|continental]] tradition of philosophy—has become increasingly influential in the [[Analytic philosophy|analytic]] tradition as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2014/entries/hegel/|title=Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|first=Redding|last=Paul|authorlink=Paul Redding|date=13 February 1997|publisher=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Hegel remains a divisive figure, his canonical stature within [[Western philosophy]] is universally recognized.

Hegel's principal achievement was his development of a distinctive articulation of [[idealism]], sometimes termed ''[[absolute idealism]]'',&lt;ref&gt;This term is actually quite rare in Hegel's writings. It does not occur anywhere in ''The Science of Logic'' (though he comes close in a remark on p. 124 of the [2010] di Giovanni translation, GW 21.142). In the ''Encyclopedia'' presentation of his logic it can be found only at §45R. Greraets, Suchting and Harris note in the introduction to their translation of this later text that the term is more strongly associated with English movement in that later part of the 19th century (Hackett: 1991, xiii).&lt;/ref&gt; in which the dualisms of, for instance, mind and nature and [[Subject (philosophy)|subject]] and [[Object (philosophy)|object]] are overcome. His philosophy of spirit conceptually integrates psychology, the state, history, art, religion and philosophy. His account of the [[master–slave dialectic]] has been highly influential, especially in 20th-century France.&lt;ref&gt;Overwhelmingly due to [[Alexandre Kojève]]'s influential lectures published as ''Introduction à la lecture de Hegel'' (Paris, 1947), selections translated into English by James Nichols as ''Introduction to the Reading of Hegel'' (New York, 1969). See, for instance, Aimé Patri, "Dialectique du Maître et de l’Esclave", Le Contrat Social, V, No. a (July–August 196r), 234, cited in Editor's Introduction (vii) on the extent of their influence.&lt;/ref&gt; Of special importance is his concept of spirit (''[[Geist]]'', sometimes also translated as "mind") as the historical manifestation of the logical concept and the [[Aufheben|"sublation"]] (''Aufhebung'', integration without [[Reduction (philosophy)|elimination or reduction]]) of seemingly contradictory or opposing factors: examples include the apparent opposition between nature and [[Freedom of will|freedom]] and between [[immanence]] and [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcendence]]. Hegel has been seen in the 20th century as the originator of the [[thesis, antithesis, synthesis]] triad,&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert C. Solomon]], ''In the Spirit of Hegel'', Oxford University Press, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; but as an explicit phrase it originated with [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]].&lt;ref name=Fichte&gt;"Review of ''[[Aenesidemus (book)|Aenesidemus]]''" ([http://www.gleichsatz.de/b-u-t/trad/fichte/jgf-aenesidemus.html "Rezension des Aenesidemus"], ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Allgemeine Literatur-Zeitung|de}}'', February 11–12, 1794). Trans. Daniel Breazeale. In {{cite book| last1=Breazeale|first1=Daniel|last2=Fichte|first2=Johann|title=Fichte: Early Philosophical Writings|date=1993|publisher=Cornell University Press|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hegel has influenced many thinkers and writers whose own positions vary widely.&lt;ref&gt;"One of the few things on which the analysts, pragmatists, and existentialists agree with the dialectical theologians is that Hegel is to be repudiated: their attitude toward Kant, Aristotle, Plato, and the other great philosophers is not at all unanimous even within each movement; but opposition to Hegel is part of the platform of all four, and of the Marxists, too." [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]], [http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/us/kaufmann.htm "The Hegel Myth and Its Method"] in ''From Shakespeare to Existentialism: Studies in Poetry, Religion, and Philosophy'', Beacon Press, Boston, 1959 (pp.&amp;nbsp;88–119).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Barth]] described Hegel as a "Protestant [[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]]"&lt;ref&gt;"Why did Hegel not become for the Protestant world something similar to what Thomas Aquinas was for Roman Catholicism?" (Karl Barth, ''Protestant Thought from Rousseau to Ritschl: Being the Translation Of Eleven Chapters of Die Protestantische Theologie im 19. Jahrhundert'', 268 Harper, 1959).&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] wrote that "all the great philosophical ideas of the past century—the philosophies of [[Karl Marx|Marx]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], German [[existentialism]], and [[psychoanalysis]]—had their beginnings in Hegel."&lt;ref&gt;Maurice Merleau-Ponty (trans.

[[File:Stuttgart-Hegel-Birthplace-2006-04-09a.jpg|thumb|left|The birthplace of Hegel in [[Stuttgart]], which now houses the Hegel Museum]]
He was born on August 27, 1770 in [[Stuttgart]], capital of the [[Duchy of Württemberg]] in southwestern Germany. Christened Georg Wilhelm Friedrich, he was known as Wilhelm to his close family. His father, Georg Ludwig, was ''Rentkammersekretär'' (secretary to the revenue office) at the court of [[Karl Eugen, Duke of Württemberg]].&lt;ref name=pinkard/&gt;{{rp|2–3, 745}} Hegel's mother, Maria Magdalena Louisa (née Fromm), was the daughter of a lawyer at the High Court of Justice at the Württemberg court. She died of a "bilious fever" (''Gallenfieber'') when Hegel was thirteen. Hegel and his father also caught the disease, but they narrowly survived.&lt;ref&gt;Pinkard, ''Hegel: A Biography'', p. 3, incorrectly gives the date as September 20, 1781, and describes Hegel as aged eleven. Cf. the index to Pinkard's book and his "Chronology of Hegel's Life", which correctly give the date as 1783 (pp. 773, 745); see also [[:de:Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel#Studien und Interessen|German Wikipedia]].&lt;/ref&gt; Hegel had a sister, Christiane Luise (1773–1832); and a brother, Georg Ludwig (1776–1812), who was to perish as an officer in Napoleon's Russian campaign of 1812.&lt;ref name=pinkard/&gt;{{rp|4}}

At the age of three, he went to the German School. When he entered the Latin School two years later, he already knew the [[first declension]], having been taught it by his mother. In 1776, he entered Stuttgart's ''[[gymnasium illustre]]'' and during his adolescence read voraciously, copying lengthy extracts in his diary. Authors he read include the poet [[Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock]] and writers associated with the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], such as [[Christian Garve]] and [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]]. His studies at the ''Gymnasium'' were concluded with his ''[[Abitur]]rede'' ("graduation speech") entitled "The abortive state of art and scholarship in Turkey"&lt;ref name=pinkard/&gt;{{rp|16}} ("den verkümmerten Zustand der Künste und Wissenschaften unter den Türken").&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Rosenkranz]], ''Hegels Leben'', Duncker und Humblot, 1844, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Tübingen (1788–1793) ====
At the age of eighteen, Hegel entered the [[Tübinger Stift]] (a Protestant seminary attached to the [[University of Tübingen]]), where he had as roommates the poet and philosopher [[Friedrich Hölderlin]] and the philosopher-to-be [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cambridge Companion to Hegel |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N1ohAwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover | editor=[[Frederick C. Beiser|Beiser, Frederick C.]] |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=1993 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=N1ohAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT419&amp;dq=%22Hegel%22%22Tübinger+Stift.+1789–1790+shares+a+roomwith+Hölderlin+and+Schelling+and+forms+friendship+with+them%22 419]| id={{ISBN|1-13982495-3}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sharing a dislike for what they regarded as the restrictive environment of the Seminary, the three became close friends and mutually influenced each other's ideas. All greatly admired Hellenic civilization and Hegel additionally steeped himself in [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and Lessing during this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harris|first=H.S.|title=Phenomenology and System|date=1995|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; They watched the unfolding of the [[French Revolution]] with shared enthusiasm. Schelling and Hölderlin immersed themselves in theoretical debates on [[Kantian philosophy]], from which Hegel remained aloof. Hegel at this time envisaged his future as that of a ''Popularphilosoph'', i.e. a "man of letters" who serves to make the abstruse ideas of philosophers accessible to a wider public; his own felt need to engage critically with the central ideas of Kantianism did not come until 1800. 

Although the violence of the [[Reign of Terror]] in 1793 dampened Hegel's hopes, he continued to identify with the moderate [[Girondin]] faction and never lost his commitment to the principles of 1789, which he would express by drinking a toast to the [[storming of the Bastille]] every fourteenth of July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Good |first1=James Allan |title=A Search for Unity in Diversity: The "Permanent Hegelian Deposit" in the Philosophy of John Dewey |date=2006 |publisher=Lexington Books |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==== Bern (1793–1796) and Frankfurt (1797–1801) ====
Having received his theological certificate (''[[consistory (Protestantism)|Konsistorial]]examen'') from the Tübingen Seminary, Hegel became ''Hofmeister'' (house tutor) to an aristocratic family in [[Bern]] (1793–1796). During this period, he composed the text which has become known as the ''[[Life of Jesus (Hegel)|Life of Jesus]]'' and a book-length manuscript titled "The Positivity of the Christian Religion". His relations with his employers becoming strained. Hegel accepted an offer mediated by Hölderlin to take up a similar position with a wine merchant's family in [[Frankfurt]], where he moved in 1797. Here, Hölderlin exerted an important influence on Hegel's thought.&lt;ref name=pinkard/&gt;{{rp|80}} While in Frankfurt, Hegel composed the essay "Fragments on Religion and Love".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www3.documenta.de/research/assets/Uploads/Hegel-Fragment-on-Love.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131008103100/http://www3.documenta.de/research/assets/Uploads/Hegel-Fragment-on-Love.pdf |archivedate=2013-10-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1799, he wrote another essay entitled "The Spirit of Christianity and Its Fate",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sunypress.edu/pdf/60921.pdf The Spirit of Christianity and Its Fate"]&lt;/ref&gt; unpublished during his lifetime.

Also in 1797, the unpublished and unsigned manuscript of "[[The Oldest Systematic Program of German Idealism]]" was written. It was written in Hegel's hand, but thought to have been authored by either Hegel, Schelling, Hölderlin, or an unknown fourth person.&lt;ref name="Hammermeister"&gt;Kai Hammermeister, ''The German Aesthetic Tradition'', Cambridge University Press, 2002, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Career years ===
==== Jena, Bamberg and Nuremberg (1801–1816) ====
In 1801, Hegel came to [[Jena]] with the encouragement of his old friend Schelling, who held the position of Extraordinary Professor at the [[University of Jena|University]] there. Hegel secured a position at the University as a ''[[Privatdozent]]'' (unsalaried lecturer) after submitting an [[inaugural dissertation]] on the orbits of the planets.&lt;ref&gt;The title of Hegel's thesis was ''Dissertatio Philosophica de Orbitis Planetarium'' (''Philosophical Dissertation on the Orbits of the Planets''); published, with a German translation by Wolgang Neuser, as ''Dissertatio Philosophica de Orbitis Planetarium / Philosophische erörterung über die Planetenbahnen'', Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the year, Hegel's first book ''[[The Difference Between Fichte's and Schelling's Systems of Philosophy]]'' was completed. He lectured on "Logic and Metaphysics" and gave joint lectures with Schelling on an "Introduction to the Idea and Limits of True Philosophy" and held a "Philosophical Disputorium". In 1802, Schelling and Hegel founded a journal, the ''Kritische Journal der Philosophie'' (''Critical Journal of Philosophy''), to which they each contributed pieces until the collaboration was ended when Schelling left for [[Würzburg]] in 1803.

In 1805, the University promoted Hegel to the position of Extraordinary Professor (unsalaried) after he wrote a letter to the poet and minister of culture [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe]] protesting at the promotion of his philosophical adversary [[Jakob Friedrich Fries]] ahead of him.&lt;ref name=pinkard&gt;{{cite book|last=Pinkard|first=Terry|title=Hegel: A Biography|date=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-49679-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|223}} Hegel attempted to enlist the help of the poet and translator [[Johann Heinrich Voß]] to obtain a post at the newly renascent [[University of Heidelberg]], but he failed; to his chagrin, Fries was later in the same year made Ordinary Professor (salaried) there.&lt;ref name=pinkard/&gt;{{rp|224–25}}

[[File:Hegel-and-Napoleon-in-Jena-1806.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|"Hegel and Napoleon in Jena" (illustration from ''Harper's Magazine'', 1895), whose meeting became proverbial due to Hegel's notable use of ''[[Weltseele]]'' ("world-soul") in reference to Napoleon ("the world-soul on horseback", ''{{lang|de|die Weltseele zu Pferde}}'')&lt;ref&gt;Note that ''Weltseele zu Pferde'' is a shortened paraphrase of Hegel's words in the letter. The letter was not published in Hegel's time, but the expression was attributed to Hegel anecdotally, appearing in print from 1859 (L. Noack, ''Schelling und die Philosophie der Romantik'', 1859, [https://books.google.ch/books?id=7NO__b_nwrsC&amp;pg=PA153 p. 153]). It is used without attribution by [[Meyer Kayserling]] in his ''Sephardim'' (1859:103), and is apparently not recognized as a reference to Hegel by the reviewer in ''Göttingische gelehrte Anzeigen'' 2 (1861) [https://books.google.ch/books?id=4zBFAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA770  p. 770], who notes it disapprovingly, as one of Kayserling's "bad jokes" (''schlechte Witze''). The phrase become widely associated with Hegel later in the 19th century, e.g. G. Baur in ''Reden gehalten in der Aula der Universität Leipzig beim Rectoratswechsel am 31. October 1874'' (1874), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=INxiAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA36#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 36].&lt;/ref&gt;]]
With his finances drying up quickly, Hegel was now under great pressure to deliver his book, the long-promised introduction to his System. Hegel was putting the finishing touches to this book, ''[[The Phenomenology of Spirit]]'', as Napoleon engaged Prussian troops on 14 October 1806 in the [[Battle of Jena]] on a plateau outside the city. On the day before the battle, Napoleon entered the city of Jena. Hegel recounted his impressions in a letter to his friend [[Friedrich Immanuel Niethammer]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;I saw the Emperor – this world-soul [''[[Weltseele]]''] – riding out of the city on reconnaissance. It is indeed a wonderful sensation to see such an individual, who, concentrated here at a single point, astride a horse, reaches out over the world and masters it.&lt;ref&gt;''{{lang|de|den Kaiser – diese Weltseele – sah ich durch die Stadt zum Rekognoszieren hinausreiten; es ist in der Tat eine wunderbare Empfindung, ein solches Individuum zu sehen, das hier auf einen Punkt kontentriert, auf einem Pferde sitzend, über die Welt übergreift und sie beherrscht.}}''Hegel, letter of  13 October 1806  to F. I. Niethammer,  no. 74 (p. 119) in ''Briefe von und an Hegel'' ed. Hoffmeister, vol. 1 (1970), cited after H. Schnädelbach in Wolfgang Welsch, Klaus Vieweg (eds.), ''Das Interesse des Denkens: Hegel aus heutiger Sicht'', Wilhelm Fink Verlag (2003),  [https://books.google.ch/books?id=NrkPdUO5VRsC&amp;pg=PA233  p. 223]; trans. Pinkard (2000:228).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Pinkard (2000) notes that Hegel's comment to Niethammer "is all the more striking since at that point he had already composed the crucial section of the ''Phenomenology'' in which he remarked that the [[French Revolution|Revolution]] had now officially passed to another land (Germany) that would complete 'in thought' what the Revolution had only partially accomplished in practice".&lt;ref&gt;Pinkard (2000:228f).&lt;/ref&gt; Although Napoleon chose not to close down Jena as he had other universities, the city was devastated and students deserted the university in droves, making Hegel's financial prospects even worse. The following February, Hegel's landlady Christiana Burkhardt (who had been abandoned by her husband) gave birth to their son Georg Ludwig Friedrich Fischer (1807–1831).&lt;ref name=pinkard/&gt;{{rp|192}}

In March 1807, Hegel moved to [[Bamberg]], where Niethammer had declined and passed on to Hegel an offer to become editor of a newspaper, the ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Bamberger Zeitung|de}}''. Unable to find more suitable employment, Hegel reluctantly accepted. Ludwig Fischer and his mother (whom Hegel may have offered to marry following the death of her husband) stayed behind in Jena.&lt;ref name=pinkard/&gt;{{rp|238}}

In November 1808, Hegel was again through Niethammer, appointed headmaster of a ''Gymnasium'' in [[Nuremberg]], a post he held until 1816. While in Nuremberg, Hegel adapted his recently published ''Phenomenology of Spirit'' for use in the classroom. Part of his remit being to teach a class called "Introduction to Knowledge of the Universal Coherence of the Sciences", Hegel developed the idea of an encyclopedia of the philosophical sciences, falling into three parts (logic, philosophy of nature and philosophy of spirit).&lt;ref name=pinkard/&gt;{{rp|337}}

In 1811, Hegel married Marie Helena Susanna von Tucher (1791–1855), the eldest daughter of a Senator. This period saw the publication of his second major work, the ''Science of Logic'' (''Wissenschaft der Logik''; 3 vols., 1812, 1813 and 1816), and the birth of his two legitimate sons, [[Karl von Hegel|Karl Friedrich Wilhelm]] (1813–1901) and Immanuel Thomas Christian (1814–1891).

==== Heidelberg and Berlin (1816–1831) ====
Having received offers of a post from the Universities of [[University of Erlangen-Nuremberg|Erlangen]], [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin]] and [[Heidelberg University|Heidelberg]], Hegel chose Heidelberg, where he moved in 1816. Soon after, his illegitimate son Ludwig Fischer (now ten years old) joined the Hegel household in April 1817, having thus far spent his childhood in an orphanage&lt;ref name=pinkard/&gt;{{rp|354–55}} as his mother had died in the meantime.&lt;ref name=pinkard/&gt;{{rp|356}}

Hegel published ''The Encyclopedia of the Philosophical Sciences in Outline'' (1817) as a summary of his philosophy for students attending his lectures at Heidelberg.

[[File:Friedrich Hegel mit Studenten Lithographie F Kugler.jpg|thumb|Hegel with his Berlin students&lt;br&gt;Sketch by Franz Kugler]]
In 1818, Hegel accepted the renewed offer of the chair of philosophy at the University of Berlin, which had remained vacant since [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]]'s death in 1814. Here, Hegel published his ''Philosophy of Right'' (1821). Hegel devoted himself primarily to delivering his lectures; and his lecture courses on aesthetics, the philosophy of religion, the philosophy of history and the history of philosophy were published posthumously from lecture notes taken by his students. His fame spread and his lectures attracted students from all over Germany and beyond.

In 1819–1827, he made several trips to [[Weimar]] (twice), where he met Goethe, [[Brussels]], the [[Northern Netherlands]], [[Leipzig]], [[Vienna]] through [[Prague]] and [[Paris]].&lt;ref name="Siep xxii"&gt;Ludwig Siep, ''Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit'', Cambridge University Press, 2014, p. xxi.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hegel was appointed [[Rector (academia)|Rector]] of the University in October 1829, but his term as Rector ended in September 1830. Hegel was deeply disturbed by the riots for reform in Berlin in that year. In 1831, [[Frederick William III of Prussia|Frederick William III]] decorated him with the [[Order of the Red Eagle]], 3rd Class for his service to the Prussian state.&lt;ref name="Siep xxii"/&gt; In August 1831, a [[cholera]] epidemic reached Berlin and Hegel left the city, taking up lodgings in [[Kreuzberg]]. Now in a weak state of health, Hegel seldom went out. As the new semester began in October, Hegel returned to Berlin with the (mistaken) impression that the epidemic had largely subsided. By November 14, Hegel was dead. The physicians pronounced the cause of death as cholera, but it is likely he died from a different gastrointestinal disease. He is said to have uttered the last words "And he didn't understand me" before expiring.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Davies, ''[[Europe: A History]]'', 1996, p. 687.&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance with his wishes, Hegel was buried on November 16 in the [[Dorotheenstadt cemetery]] next to Fichte and [[Karl Wilhelm Ferdinand Solger]].

Hegel's son Ludwig Fischer had died shortly before while serving with the Dutch army in [[Jakarta|Batavia]] and the news of his death never reached his father.&lt;ref name=pinkard/&gt;{{rp|548}} Early the following year, Hegel's sister Christiane committed suicide by drowning. Hegel's remaining two sons—[[Karl von Hegel|Karl]], who became a historian; and {{Interlanguage link multi|Immanuel Hegel|de|3=Immanuel Hegel|lt=Immanuel}}, who followed a theological path—lived long and safeguarded their father's ''[[Nachlaß]]'' and produced editions of his works.

== Philosophical work ==
{{Hegelianism}}

=== Freedom ===
Hegel's thinking can be understood as a constructive development within the broad tradition that includes [[Plato]] and [[Immanuel Kant]]. To this list, one could add [[Proclus]], [[Meister Eckhart]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], [[Plotinus]], [[Jakob Böhme]], and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]. What all these thinkers share, which distinguishes them from [[materialists]] like [[Epicurus]] and [[Thomas Hobbes]] and from [[empiricists]] like [[David Hume]], is that they regard freedom or self-determination both as real and as having important [[ontology|ontological]] implications for soul or mind or divinity. This focus on freedom is what generates Plato's notion (in the ''[[Phaedo]]'', ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' and ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'') of the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] as having a higher or fuller kind of reality than inanimate objects possess. While [[Aristotle]] criticizes Plato's "Forms", he preserves Plato's cornerstones of the ontological implications for self-determination: ethical reasoning, the soul's pinnacle in the hierarchy of nature, the order of the cosmos and an assumption with reasoned arguments for a prime mover. Kant imports Plato's high esteem of individual sovereignty to his considerations of moral and noumenal freedom as well as to God. All three find common ground on the unique position of humans in the scheme of things, known by the discussed categorical differences from animals and inanimate objects.

In his discussion of "Spirit" in his ''Encyclopedia'', Hegel praises Aristotle's ''[[On the Soul]]'' as "by far the most admirable, perhaps even the sole, work of philosophical value on this topic".&lt;ref&gt;par. 378&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''[[The Phenomenology of Spirit|Phenomenology of Spirit]]'' and his ''[[Science of Logic]]'', Hegel's concern with Kantian topics such as freedom and morality and with their ontological implications is pervasive. Rather than simply rejecting Kant's dualism of freedom versus nature, Hegel aims to subsume it within "true infinity", the "Concept" (or "Notion": ''Begriff''), "Spirit" and "ethical life" in such a way that the Kantian duality is rendered intelligible, rather than remaining a brute "given".

The reason why this subsumption takes place in a series of concepts is that Hegel's method in his ''Science of Logic'' and his ''Encyclopedia'' is to begin with basic concepts like "Being" and "Nothing" and to develop these through a long sequence of elaborations, including those already mentioned. In this manner, a solution that is reached in principle in the account of "true infinity" in the ''Science of Logic'''s chapter on "Quality" is repeated in new guises at later stages, all the way to "Spirit" and "ethical life" in the third volume of the ''Encyclopedia''.

In this way, Hegel intends to defend the germ of truth in Kantian dualism against reductive or eliminative programs like those of materialism and empiricism. Like Plato, with his dualism of soul versus bodily appetites, Kant pursues the mind's ability to question its felt inclinations or appetites and to come up with a standard of "duty" (or, in Plato's case, "good") which transcends bodily restrictiveness. Hegel preserves this essential Platonic and Kantian concern in the form of infinity going beyond the finite (a process that Hegel in fact relates to "freedom" and the "ought"),&lt;ref name=miller&gt;See ''Science of Logic'', trans. Miller [Atlantic Highlands, NJ: Humanities, 1989]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|133–136, 138}} the universal going beyond the particular (in the Concept) and Spirit going beyond Nature. Hegel renders these dualities intelligible by (ultimately) his argument in the "Quality" chapter of the "Science of Logic". The finite has to become infinite in order to achieve reality. The idea of the absolute excludes multiplicity so the subjective and objective must achieve synthesis to become whole. This is because as Hegel suggests by his introduction of the concept of "reality",&lt;ref name=miller/&gt;{{rp|111}} what determines itself—rather than depending on its relations to other things for its essential character—is more fully "real" (following the Latin etymology of "real", more "thing-like") than what does not. Finite things do not determine themselves because as "finite" things their essential character is determined by their boundaries over against other finite things, so in order to become "real" they must go beyond their finitude ("finitude is only as a transcending of itself").&lt;ref name=miller/&gt;{{rp|145}}

The result of this argument is that finite and infinite—and by extension, particular and universal, nature and freedom—do not face one another as two independent realities, but instead the latter (in each case) is the self-transcending of the former.&lt;ref name=miller/&gt;{{rp|146}} Rather than stress the distinct singularity of each factor that complements and conflicts with others—without explanation—the relationship between finite and infinite (and particular and universal and nature and freedom) becomes intelligible as a progressively developing and self-perfecting whole.

=== Progress ===
The mystical writings of [[Jakob Böhme]] had a strong effect on Hegel.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jon Mills (psychologist)|Jon Mills]], ''The Unconscious Abyss: Hegel's Anticipation of Psychoanalysis'', SUNY Press, 2002, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Böhme had written that the [[Fall of Man]] was a necessary stage in the [[evolution]] of the [[universe]]. This evolution was itself the result of God's desire for complete self-awareness. Hegel was fascinated by the works of Kant, Rousseau and [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe]] and by the [[French Revolution]]. Modern philosophy, culture and society seemed to Hegel fraught with contradictions and tensions, such as those between the subject and object of knowledge, mind and nature, [[Philosophy of self|self]] and [[Other (philosophy)|Other]], freedom and authority, knowledge and faith, or the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and [[Romanticism]]. Hegel's main philosophical project was to take these contradictions and tensions and interpret them as part of a comprehensive, evolving, rational unity that in different contexts he called "the absolute Idea" (''[[Science of Logic]]'', sections 1781–1783) or "absolute knowledge" (''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]'', "(DD) Absolute Knowledge").

According to Hegel, the main characteristic of this unity was that it evolved through and manifested itself in [[contradiction]] and negation. Contradiction and negation have a dynamic quality that at every point in each domain of [[reality]]—[[consciousness]], history, philosophy, art, nature and society—leads to further development until a [[rationality|rational]] unity is reached that preserves the contradictions as phases and sub-parts by lifting them up (''[[Aufheben|Aufhebung]]'') to a higher unity. This whole is mental because it is mind that can comprehend all of these phases and sub-parts as steps in its own process of comprehension. It is rational because the same, underlying, [[logic]]al, developmental order underlies every domain of reality and is ultimately the order of self-conscious rational thought, although only in the later stages of development does it come to full self-consciousness. The rational, self-conscious [[wikt:whole|whole]] is not a thing or [[being]] that lies outside of other existing things or minds. Rather, it comes to completion only in the philosophical comprehension of individual existing human minds who through their own understanding bring this developmental process to an understanding of itself. Hegel's thought is revolutionary to the extent that it is a philosophy of absolute negation—as long as absolute negation is at the center, systematization remains open, and makes it possible for human beings to become subjects.&lt;ref name="Schroeder2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven Schroeder|title=Between Freedom and Necessity: An Essay on the Place of Value|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JfT6aQvkVfAC&amp;pg=PA104|accessdate=2012-12-17|year=2000|publisher=Rodopi|isbn=978-90-420-1302-5|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Mind" and "Spirit" are the common English translations of Hegel's use of the German "[[Geist]]". Some{{Who|date=December 2012}} have argued that either of these terms overly "psychologize" Hegel,{{citation needed|date=February 2007}} implying a kind of disembodied, solipsistic consciousness like [[ghost]] or "soul". Geist combines the meaning of spirit—as in god, ghost, or mind—with an intentional force. In Hegel's early philosophy of nature (draft manuscripts written during his time at the University of Jena), Hegel's notion of "Geist" was tightly bound to the notion of "[[Aether (classical element)|Aether]]", from which Hegel also derived the concepts of [[space]] and [[time]], but in his later works (after Jena) he did not explicitly use his old notion of "Aether" anymore.&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Gruner: "Hegel's Aether Doctrine", [[VDM Publishing|VDM Publ]]., 2010, {{ISBN|978-3-639-28451-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Central to Hegel's [[Conception (idea)|conception]] of [[knowledge]] and mind (and therefore also of reality) was the notion of [[Identity (philosophy)|identity]] in [[Subtraction|difference]]—that is, that mind [[Externalization|externalizes]] itself in various forms and [[object (philosophy)|object]]s that stand outside of it or opposed to it; and that through recognizing itself in them, is "with itself" in these external manifestations so that they are at one and the same time mind and other-than-mind. This notion of identity in difference, which is intimately bound up with his conception of contradiction and negativity, is a principal feature differentiating Hegel's thought from that of other philosophers.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}

=== Civil society ===
{{see also|Civil society}}
Hegel made the distinction between civil society and state in his ''[[Elements of the Philosophy of Right]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/preface.htm|title=Hegel's Philosophy of Right: Preface|first=|last=Hegel, G. W. F.|website=www.marxists.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this work, civil society (Hegel used the term "''bürgerliche Gesellschaft''" though it is now referred to as ''Zivilgesellschaft'' in German to emphasize a more inclusive community) was a stage in the [[dialectical|dialectical relationship]] that occurs between Hegel's perceived opposites, the macro-community of the [[State (polity)|state]] and the micro-community of the family.&lt;ref&gt;Pelczynski, A.Z.; 1984; 'The Significance of Hegel's separation of the state and civil society' pp1-13 in Pelczynski, A.Z. (ed.); 1984; ''The State and Civil Society''; Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Broadly speaking, the term was split, like Hegel's followers, to the [[political left]] and [[political right|right]]. On the left, it became the foundation for [[Karl Marx]]'s civil society as an [[base and superstructure|economic base]];&lt;ref name="glob"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Zaleski | first = Pawel | authorlink = | title = Tocqueville on Civilian Society. A Romantic Vision of the Dichotomic Structure of Social Reality | journal = Archiv für Begriffsgeschichte | volume = 50 | issue = | pages = | publisher = Felix Meiner Verlag | location = | year = 2008 | url = | doi = | id = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; to the right, it became a description for all non-state (and the state is the peak of the objective spirit) aspects of society, including culture, society and politics. This liberal distinction between [[political society]] and [[civil society]] was followed by [[Alexis de Tocqueville]].&lt;ref name="glob" /&gt; In fact, Hegel's distinctions as to what he meant by civil society are often unclear. For example, while it seems to be the case that he felt that a civil society such as the German society in which he lived was an inevitable movement of the dialectic, he made way for the crushing of other types of "lesser" and not fully realized types of civil society as these societies were not fully conscious or aware—as it were—as to the lack of progress in their societies. Thus, it was perfectly legitimate in the eyes of Hegel for a conqueror such as Napoleon to come along and destroy that which was not fully realized.

=== State ===
Hegel's State is the final culmination of the embodiment of freedom or right (''Rechte'') in the ''[[Elements of the Philosophy of Right]].'' The State subsumes family and civil society and fulfills them. All three together are called "ethical life" (''[[Sittlichkeit]]''). The State involves three "[[wikt:moment#Noun|moments]]". In a Hegelian State, citizens both know their place and choose their place. They both know their obligations and choose to fulfill their obligations. An individual's "supreme duty is to be a member of the state" (''Elements of the Philosophy of Right'', section 258). The individual has "substantial freedom in the state". The State is "objective spirit" so "it is only through being a member of the state that the individual himself has objectivity, truth, and ethical life" (section 258). Furthermore, every member both loves the State with genuine patriotism, but has transcended mere "team spirit" by reflectively endorsing their citizenship. Members of a Hegelian State are happy even to sacrifice their lives for the State.

=== Heraclitus ===
According to Hegel, "[[Heraclitus]] is the one who first declared the nature of the infinite and first grasped nature as in itself infinite, that is, its essence as process. The origin of philosophy is to be dated from Heraclitus.

According to Hegel, Heraclitus's "obscurity" comes from his being a true (in Hegel's terms "speculative") philosopher who grasped the ultimate philosophical truth and therefore expressed himself in a way that goes beyond the abstract and limited nature of common sense and is difficult to grasp by those who operate within common sense. Hegel asserted that in Heraclitus he had an antecedent for his logic: "[...] there is no proposition of Heraclitus which I have not adopted in my logic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Justus | last=Hartnack |others=Lars Aagaard-Mogensen (trans.) | title=An Introduction to Hegel's Logic | year=1998 | publisher=Hackett Publishing | isbn=0-87220-424-3| pages=16–17}} Hartnack quotes Hegel, ''Lectures on the History of Philosophy'', Volume I.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hegel cites a number of fragments of Heraclitus in his ''Lectures on the History of Philosophy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Hegel, G. W. F. | title=Vorlesungen über die Geschichte der Philosophie | year=1979 | pages=319–343 | url=http://www.zeno.org/Philosophie/M/Hegel,+Georg+Wilhelm+Friedrich/Vorlesungen+%C3%BCber+die+Geschichte+der+Philosophie/Erster+Teil%3A+Griechische+Philosophie/Erster+Abschnitt.+Von+Thales+bis+Aristoteles/Erstes+Kapitel.+Von+Thales+bis+Anaxagoras/D.+Philosophie+des+Heraklit | accessdate=2008-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; One to which he attributes great significance is the fragment he translates as "Being is not more than Non-being", which he interprets to mean the following: &lt;blockquote&gt;''Sein und Nichts sei dasselbe''&lt;br&gt;Being and non-being are the same.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Heraclitus does not form any abstract nouns from his ordinary use of "to be" and "to become" and in that fragment seems to be opposing any identity A to any other identity B, C and so on, which is not-A. However, Hegel interprets not-A as not existing at all, not nothing at all, which cannot be conceived, but indeterminate or "pure" [[being]] without [[particular]]ity or specificity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Frederick Charles | last=Copleston | pages=Chapter X | year=2003 | publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group | isbn=0-8264-6901-9 | nopp=true | title=A History of Philosophy: Volume 7: 18th and 19th century German philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pure being and pure non-being or nothingness are for Hegel pure abstractions from the reality of becoming and this is also how he interprets Heraclitus. This interpretation of Heraclitus cannot be ruled out, but even if present is not the main gist of his thought.

For Hegel, the inner movement of reality is the process of God thinking as manifested in the evolution of the universe of nature and thought; that is, Hegel argued that when fully and properly understood, [[reality]] is being [[Idealism|thought]] by God as manifested in a person's comprehension of this process in and through philosophy. Since human thought is the image and fulfillment of God's thought, God is not [[Ineffability|ineffable]] (so incomprehensible as to be unutterable), but can be understood by an analysis of thought and reality. Just as humans continually correct their concepts of reality through a [[dialectic|dialectical process]], so God himself becomes more fully manifested through the dialectical process of becoming.

For his god, Hegel does not take the logos of Heraclitus but refers rather to the [[nous]] of [[Anaxagoras]], although he may well have regarded them the same as he continues to refer to god's plan, which is identical to God. Whatever the nous thinks at any time is actual [[Substance theory|substance]] and is identical to limited being, but more remains to be thought in the substrate of non-being, which is identical to pure or unlimited thought.

The universe as becoming is therefore a combination of being and non-being. The particular is never complete in itself, but to find completion is continually transformed into more comprehensive, complex, self-relating particulars. The essential nature of being-for-itself is that it is free "in itself;" that is, it does not depend on anything else such as matter for its being. The limitations represent fetters, which it must constantly be casting off as it becomes freer and more self-determining.&lt;ref&gt;The notable Introduction to ''Philosophy of History'' expresses the historical aspects of the dialectic.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Hegel began his philosophizing with commentary on the Christian religion and often expresses the view that he is a Christian, his ideas of God are not acceptable to some Christians even though he has had a major influence on 19th- and 20th-century theology.

=== Religion ===
As a graduate of a Protestant seminary, Hegel's theological concerns were reflected in many of his writings and lectures.&lt;ref&gt;"[T]he task that touches the interest of philosophy most nearly at the present moment: to put God back at the peak of philosophy, absolutely prior to all else as the one and only ground of everything." (Hegel, "How the Ordinary Human Understanding Takes Philosophy as displayed in the works of Mr. Krug", ''Kritisches Journal der Philosophie'', I, no. 1, 1802, pages&amp;nbsp;91–115)&lt;/ref&gt; Hegel's thoughts on the person of [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] stood out from the theologies of the Enlightenment. In his posthumously published ''[[Lectures on the Philosophy of Religion]], Part 3'', Hegel is shown as being particularly interested with the demonstrations of God's existence and the ontological proof.&lt;ref&gt;Jon Bartley Stewart. 2008. ''[[Johan Ludvig Heiberg (poet)|Johan Ludvig Heiberg]]: Philosopher, Littérateur, Dramaturge, and Political Thinker.'' Museum Tusculanum Press. p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; He espouses that "God is not an abstraction but a concrete God&amp;nbsp;[...] God, considered in terms of his eternal Idea, has to generate the Son, has to distinguish himself from himself; he is the process of differentiating, namely, love and Spirit". This means that Jesus as the Son of God is posited by God over against himself as other. Hegel sees both a relational unity and a metaphysical unity between Jesus and God the Father. To Hegel, Jesus is both divine and human. Hegel further attests that God (as Jesus) not only died, but "[...]&amp;nbsp;rather, a reversal takes place: God, that is to say, maintains himself in the process, and the latter is only the death of death. God rises again to life, and thus things are reversed".

The philosopher [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] has argued that there was great stress on the sharp criticisms of traditional Christianity appearing in Hegel's so-called early theological writings. Kaufmann admits that Hegel treated many distinctively Christian themes and "sometimes could not resist equating" his conception of spirit (Geist) "with God, instead of saying clearly: in God I do not believe; spirit suffices me".&lt;ref&gt;Walter Kaufmann, ''Hegel: Reinterpretation, Texts, and Commentary'', Garden City, New York: Doubleday &amp; Company, 1965, pp. 276–77&lt;/ref&gt; Kaufmann also points out that Hegel's references to God or to the divine—and also to spirit—drew on classical Greek as well as Christian connotations of the terms. Kaufmann goes on:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In addition to his beloved Greeks, Hegel saw before him the example of Spinoza and, in his own time, the poetry of Goethe, Schiller, and Hölderlin, who also liked to speak of gods and the divine. So he, too, sometimes spoke of God and, more often, of the divine; and because he occasionally took pleasure in insisting that he was really closer to this or that Christian tradition than some of the theologians of his time, he has sometimes been understood to have been a Christian.&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]], ''Hegel: Reinterpretation, Texts, and Commentary'', Garden City, New York: Doubleday &amp; Company, 1965, p. 277&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Hegel himself, his philosophy was consistent with Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Jon Bartley Stewart. 2008. Johan Ludvig Heiberg: Philosopher, Littérateur, Dramaturge, and Political Thinker. Museum Tusculanum Press. p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; This led Hegelian philosopher, jurist and politician {{Interlanguage link multi|Carl Friedrich Göschel|de}} (1784–1861) to write a treatise demonstrating the consistency of Hegel's philosophy with the Christian doctrine of the immortality of the human soul. Göschel's book on this subject was titled ''Von den Beweisen für die Unsterblichkeit der menschlichen Seele im Lichte der spekulativen Philosophie: eine Ostergabe'' (Berlin: Verlag von Duncker und Humblot, 1835).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reader.digitale-sammlungen.de/de/fs1/object/display/bsb10043317_00005.html|title=MDZ-Reader  - Band  - Von den Beweisen für die Unsterblichkeit der menschlichen Seele im Lichte der spekulativen Philosophie / Göschel, Carl Friedrich|website=reader.digitale-sammlungen.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In the 1870s and 1880s, Rev. T. R. Vickroy and Susan E. Blow - who were both minor associates of the St. Louis Hegelians - independently of each other translated various chapters from Göschel's book into English, and had their translations published in ''The Journal of Speculative Philosophy''. ''The Journal of Speculative Philosophy'' (in print from 1867-1893) was the official journal of the St. Louis Philosophical Society. The St. Louis Philosophical Society - the organization which served as the hub of the St. Louis Hegelians - had been co-founded in January 1866 by 2 disciples of Hegel in America, William Torrey Harris (1835-1909) and [[Henry Conrad Brokmeyer]] (1826-1906). Rev. Thomas Rhys Vickroy (December 27, 1833 - April 19, 1904), a minister of the Methodist Episcopal Church, had been the first president (1866-1871) of Lebanon Valley College in Annville, Lebanon County, Pennsylvania. While President at Lebanon Valley College, Vickroy also held various professorships there. For example, one year he was Professor of Philosophy and the Greek Language and Literature, and another year he was Professor of Belles-Lettres and Philosophy. Susan Elizabeth Blow (June 7, 1843 - March 27, 1916) was an educator who in 1873 opened the first successful public kindergarten in the U. S. - in the Des Peres School, in the Carondelet neighborhood of St. Louis, Missouri.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jon Bartley Stewart. 2008. ''Johan Ludvig Heiberg: Philosopher, Littérateur, Dramaturge, and Political Thinker''. Museum Tusculanum Press. p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;

Hegel seemed to have an ambivalent relationship with [[Magic (supernatural)|magic]], [[myth]] and [[Paganism]]. He formulates an early philosophical example of a [[disenchantment]] narrative, arguing that Judaism was responsible both for realizing the existence of ''Geist'' and, by extension, for separating nature from ideas of spiritual and magical forces and challenging [[polytheism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Josephson-Storm | first = Jason | title = The Myth of Disenchantment: Magic, Modernity, and the Birth of the Human Sciences | location = Chicago | publisher = University of Chicago Press | date = 2017 |page = 85-6 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ5yDgAAQBAJ | isbn = 0-226-40336-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Hegel's manuscript "[[The Oldest Systematic Program of German Idealism]]" suggests that Hegel was concerned about the perceived decline in myth and enchantment in his age, and that he therefore called for a "new myth" to fill the cultural vacuum.&lt;ref&gt;Josephson-Storm (2017), p. 85-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Works ==
Hegel published four works during his lifetime:&lt;br&gt;
(1) ''[[The Phenomenology of Spirit]]'' (or ''The Phenomenology of Mind''), his account of the evolution of consciousness from sense-perception to absolute knowledge, published in 1807.

(2) ''[[Science of Logic]]'', the logical and [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] core of his philosophy, in three volumes (1812, 1813 and 1816, respectively), with a revised first volume published in 1831.

(3) ''[[Encyclopedia of the Philosophical Sciences]]'', a summary of his entire philosophical system, which was originally published in 1816 and revised in 1827 and 1830.

(4) ''[[Elements of the Philosophy of Right]]'', his political philosophy, published in 1820.

During the last ten years of his life, Hegel did not publish another book, but thoroughly revised the ''Encyclopedia'' (second edition, 1827; third, 1830).&lt;ref&gt;W. Kaufmann (1980), ''Discovery of the Mind 1: Goethe, Kant and Hegel'', p. 203&lt;/ref&gt; In his political philosophy, he criticized [[Karl Ludwig von Haller]]'s reactionary work, which claimed that laws were not necessary. He also published some articles early in his career and during his Berlin period. A number of other works on the [[philosophy of history]], [[Philosophy of religion|religion]], [[aesthetics]] and the [[history of philosophy]] were compiled from the lecture notes of his students and published posthumously.

{{see also|Hegelianism}}
There are views of Hegel's thought as a representation of the summit of early 19th-century Germany's movement of philosophical [[idealism]]. It would come to have a profound impact on many future philosophical schools, including schools that opposed Hegel's specific [[dialectical idealism]], such as [[existentialism]], the [[historical materialism]] of Marx, [[historism]] and [[British idealism|British Idealism]].

Hegel's influence was immense both within philosophy and in the other sciences. Throughout the 19th century many chairs of philosophy around Europe were held by Hegelians and [[Søren Kierkegaard]], [[Ludwig Feuerbach]], [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]]—among many others—were all deeply influenced by, but also strongly opposed to many of the central themes of Hegel's philosophy. Scholars continue to find and point out Hegelian influences and approaches in a wide range of theoretical and/or learned works, such as [[Carl von Clausewitz]]'s ''magnum opus'' on strategic thought, ''[[On War]]'' (1831).&lt;ref&gt;Cormier, Youri. [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07075332.2013.859166?tab=permissions#.U9etAfldXGA "Hegel and Clausewitz: Convergence on Method, Divergence on Ethics"], ''International History Review'', Volume 36, Issue 3, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; After less than a generation, Hegel's philosophy was suppressed and even banned by the [[Prussia]]n [[right-wing]] and was firmly rejected by the [[left-wing]] in multiple official writings.

After the period of [[Bruno Bauer]], Hegel's influence did not make itself felt again until the philosophy of British Idealism and the 20th-century Hegelian [[Western Marxism]] that began with [[György Lukács]]. The more recent movement of [[communitarianism]] has a strong Hegelian influence.

=== Reading Hegel ===
Some of Hegel's writing was intended for those with advanced knowledge of philosophy, although his ''Encyclopedia'' was intended as a textbook in a [[university]] [[course (education)|course]]. Nevertheless, Hegel assumes that his readers are well-versed in [[Western philosophy]]. Especially crucial are [[Aristotle]], [[Immanuel Kant]] and Kant's immediate successors, most prominently [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]] and [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]]. Those without this background would be well-advised to begin with one of the many general introductions to his thought. As is always the case, difficulties are magnified for those reading him in translation. In fact, Hegel himself argues in his ''Science of Logic'' that the German language was particularly conducive to philosophical thought.&lt;ref&gt;Hegel, G.W.F. ''Science of Logic''. trans. George di Giovanni. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. 2010. p.12&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Walter Kaufmann, the basic idea of Hegel's works, especially the ''Phenomenology of Spirit'', is that a philosopher should not "confine him or herself to views that have been held but penetrate these to the human reality they reflect". In other words, it is not enough to consider propositions, or even the content of consciousness; "it is worthwhile to ask in every instance what kind of spirit would entertain such propositions, hold such views, and have such a consciousness. Every outlook in other words, is to be studied not merely as an academic possibility but as an existential reality".&lt;ref&gt;W. Kaufmann (1966), ''Hegel: A Reinterpretation'', Anchor, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; Kaufmann has argued that as unlikely as it may sound, it is not the case that Hegel was unable to write clearly, but that Hegel felt that "he must and should not write in the way in which he was gifted".&lt;ref&gt;W. Kaufmann, 1966, ''Hegel: A Reinterpretation'', p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Left and right Hegelianism ===
Some historians have spoken of Hegel's influence as represented by two opposing camps. The [[Right Hegelians]], the allegedly direct disciples of Hegel at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität]], advocated a [[Protestant]] orthodoxy and the [[political conservatism]] of the post-[[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] Restoration period. The [[Young Hegelians|Left Hegelians]], also known as the Young Hegelians, interpreted Hegel in a [[revolutionary]] sense, leading to an advocation of [[atheism]] in religion and [[liberal democracy]] in politics.

In more recent studies, this paradigm has been questioned.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Löwith]], ''From Hegel to Nietzsche: The Revolution in Nineteenth-Century Thought'', translated by David E. Green, New York: Columbia University Press, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; No Hegelians of the period ever referred to themselves as "Right Hegelians", which was a term of insult originated by [[David Strauss]], a self-styled Left Hegelian. Critiques of Hegel offered from the Left Hegelians radically diverted Hegel's thinking into new directions and eventually came to form a disproportionately large part of the literature on and about Hegel.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

The Left Hegelians also influenced Marxism, which inspired global movements, encompassing the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]], the [[Chinese Revolution (1949)|Chinese Revolution]] and myriad revolutionary practices up until the present moment.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

20th-century interpretations of Hegel were mostly shaped by [[British idealism]], [[logical positivism]], [[Marxism]] and [[Fascism]]. According to [[Benedetto Croce]], the [[Italian Fascist]] [[Giovanni Gentile]] "holds the honor of having been the most rigorous neo-Hegelian in the entire history of Western philosophy and the dishonor of having been the official philosopher of Fascism in Italy".&lt;ref&gt;[[Benedetto Croce]], ''Guide to Aesthetics'', Translated by Patrick Romanell, "Translator's Introduction", The Library of Liberal Arts, The Bobbs–Merrill Co., Inc., 1965&lt;/ref&gt; However, since the fall of the Soviet Union a new wave of Hegel scholarship arose in the West without the preconceptions of the prior schools of thought. {{Interlanguage link multi|Walter Jaeschke|de}} and [[Otto Pöggeler]] in Germany as well as Peter Hodgson and [[Howard Kainz]] in the United States are notable for their recent contributions to post-Soviet Union thinking about Hegel.

=== Triads ===
{{main|Thesis, antithesis, synthesis}}
In previous modern accounts of Hegelianism (to undergraduate classes, for example), especially those formed prior to the Hegel renaissance, Hegel's [[dialectic]] was most often characterized as a three-step process, "[[thesis, antithesis, synthesis]]"; namely, that a "thesis" (e.g. the [[French Revolution]]) would cause the creation of its "antithesis" (e.g. the [[Reign of Terror]] that followed) and would eventually result in a "synthesis" (e.g. the [[constitutional state]] of free citizens). However, Hegel used this classification only once and he attributed the terminology to Kant. The terminology was largely developed earlier by Fichte. It was spread by [[Heinrich Moritz Chalybäus]] in accounts of Hegelian philosophy and since then the terms have been used as descriptive of this type of framework.

The "thesis–antithesis–synthesis" approach gives the sense that things or ideas are contradicted or opposed by things that come from outside them. To the contrary, the fundamental notion of Hegel's dialectic is that things or ideas have internal contradictions. From Hegel's point of view, analysis or comprehension of a thing or idea reveals that underneath its apparently simple identity or unity is an underlying inner contradiction. This contradiction leads to the dissolution of the thing or idea in the simple form in which it presented itself and to a higher-level, more complex thing or idea that more adequately incorporates the contradiction. The triadic form that appears in many places in Hegel (e.g. being–nothingness–becoming, immediate–mediate–concrete and abstract–negative–concrete) is about this movement from inner contradiction to higher-level integration or unification.

For Hegel, reason is but "speculative", not "dialectical".&lt;ref&gt;''Hegel and Language'', edited by Jere O'Neill Surber. [https://books.google.com/books?id=HFpQHr07IAkC&amp;pg=PA238 p. 238].&lt;/ref&gt; Believing that the traditional description of Hegel's philosophy in terms of thesis–antithesis–synthesis was mistaken, a few scholars like [[Raya Dunayevskaya]] have attempted to discard the triadic approach altogether. According to their argument, although Hegel refers to "the two elemental considerations: first, the idea of freedom as the absolute and final aim; secondly, the means for realising it, i.e. the subjective side of knowledge and will, with its life, movement, and activity" (thesis and antithesis), he does not use "synthesis", but instead speaks of the "Whole": "We then recognised the State as the moral Whole and the Reality of Freedom, and consequently as the objective unity of these two elements". Furthermore, in Hegel's language the "dialectical" aspect or "moment" of thought and reality, by which things or thoughts turn into their opposites or have their inner contradictions brought to the surface, what he called ''[[Aufheben|Aufhebung]]'', is only preliminary to the "speculative" (and not "synthesizing") aspect or "moment", which grasps the unity of these opposites or contradiction.

It is widely admitted today that the old-fashioned description of Hegel's philosophy in terms of thesis–antithesis–synthesis is inaccurate. Nevertheless, such is the persistence of this misnomer that the model and terminology survive in a number of scholarly works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gustav E. Mueller|editor=Jon Stewart|title=The Hegel Myths and Legends|url=|accessdate=|year=1996|publisher=Northwestern University Press|isbn=0-8101-1301-5|page=301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Renaissance ===
In the last half of the 20th century, Hegel's philosophy underwent a major renaissance. This was due to (a) the rediscovery and re-evaluation of Hegel as a possible philosophical progenitor of Marxism by philosophically oriented Marxists; (b) a resurgence of the historical perspective that Hegel brought to everything; and (c) an increasing recognition of the importance of his [[dialectical method]]. [[György Lukács]]' ''[[History and Class Consciousness]]'' (1923) helped to reintroduce Hegel into the Marxist canon. This sparked a renewed interest in Hegel reflected in the work of [[Herbert Marcuse]], [[Theodor W. Adorno]], [[Ernst Bloch]], [[Raya Dunayevskaya]], [[Alexandre Kojève]] and [[Gotthard Günther]] among others. In ''[[Reason and Revolution]]'' (1941), [[Herbert Marcuse]] made the case for Hegel as a revolutionary and criticized [[Leonard Trelawny Hobhouse]]'s thesis that Hegel was a totalitarian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Paul | last=Robinson | title=The Freudian Left: Wilhelm Reich, Geza Roheim, Herbert Marcuse | year=1990 | publisher=Cornell University Press | isbn=0-87220-424-3| page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hegel renaissance also highlighted the significance of Hegel's early works, i.e. those written before ''[[The Phenomenology of Spirit]]''. The direct and indirect influence of Kojève's lectures and writings (on ''The Phenomenology of Spirit'' in particular) mean that it is not possible to understand most French philosophers from [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] to [[Jacques Derrida]] without understanding Hegel.&lt;ref&gt;French philosopher [[Vincent Descombes]] introduced the term "post-Kojèvian discourse" to designate the period of French philosophy after the 1930s (Vincent Descombes, ''Modern French Philosophy'', Cambridge University Press, 1980, pp. 158–9).&lt;/ref&gt; American [[neoconservative]] [[political science|political theorist]] [[Francis Fukuyama]]'s controversial book ''[[The End of History and the Last Man]]'' (1992) was heavily influenced by Kojève.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Howard | last=Williams |author2=David Sullivan |author3=Gwynn Matthews  | title=Francis Fukuyama and the End of History | year=1997 | publisher=University of Wales Press | isbn=0-7083-1428-7 | pages=70–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Swiss theologian [[Hans Küng]] has also advanced contemporary scholarship in Hegel studies.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Beginning in the 1960s, Anglo-American Hegel scholarship has attempted to challenge the traditional interpretation of Hegel as offering a metaphysical system: this has also been the approach of [[Z. A. Pelczynski]] and [[Shlomo Avineri]]. This view, sometimes referred to as the "non-metaphysical option", has had a decided influence on many major English language studies of Hegel in the past forty years.

Late 20th-century literature in Western [[Theology]] that is friendly to Hegel includes works by such writers as [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] (1966), [[Dale M. Schlitt]] (1984), [[Theodore Geraets]] (1985), [[Philip M. Merklinger]] (1991), [[Stephen Rocker]] (1995) and [[Cyril O'Regan]] (1995).

Two prominent American philosophers, [[John McDowell]] and [[Robert Brandom]] (sometimes referred to as the "[[University of Pittsburgh|Pittsburgh]] Hegelians"), have produced philosophical works exhibiting a marked Hegelian influence. Each is avowedly influenced by the late [[Wilfred Sellars]], also of Pittsburgh, who referred to his seminal work ''Empiricism and the Philosophy of Mind'' (1956) as a series of "incipient ''Méditations Hegeliennes''" (in homage to [[Edmund Husserl]]'s 1931 work, ''[[Cartesian Meditations|Méditations cartésiennes]]'').

Beginning in the 1990s after the fall of the Soviet Union, a fresh reading of Hegel took place in the West. For these scholars, fairly well represented by the Hegel Society of America and in cooperation with German scholars such as Otto Pöggeler and Walter Jaeschke, Hegel's works should be read without preconceptions. Marx plays little-to-no role in these new readings. Some American philosophers associated with this movement include [[Lawrence Stepelevich]], [[Rudolf Siebert]], Richard Dien Winfield and [[Theodore Geraets]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

=== Criticism ===
Criticism of Hegel has been widespread in the 19th and the 20th centuries. A diverse range of individuals including [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], [[Karl Marx]], [[Søren Kierkegaard]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Bertrand Russell]], [[G. E. Moore]], [[Eric Voegelin]] and [[A. J. Ayer]] have challenged Hegelian philosophy from a variety of perspectives. Among the first to take a critical view of Hegel's system was the 19th-century German group known as the [[Young Hegelians]], which included Feuerbach, Marx, Engels and their followers. In Britain, the Hegelian [[British idealism]] school (members of which included [[Francis Herbert Bradley]], [[Bernard Bosanquet (philosopher)|Bernard Bosanquet]] and in the United States [[Josiah Royce]]) was challenged and rejected by [[analytic philosophy|analytic]] philosophers Moore and Russell. In particular, Russell considered "almost all" of Hegel's doctrines to be false.&lt;ref&gt;B. Russell, ''History of Western Philosophy'', chapter 22, paragraph 1, p. 701.&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding Hegel's interpretation of history, Russell commented: "Like other historical theories, it required, if it was to be made plausible, some distortion of facts and considerable ignorance".&lt;ref&gt;Russell, 735.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Logical positivism|Logical positivists]] such as Ayer and the [[Vienna Circle]] criticized both Hegelian philosophy and its supporters, such as Bradley.

Hegel's contemporary Schopenhauer was particularly critical and wrote of Hegel's philosophy as "a pseudo-philosophy paralyzing all mental powers, stifling all real thinking".&lt;ref&gt;On the Basis of Morality.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1820, Schopenhauer became a lecturer at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]] and he scheduled his lectures to coincide with those of Hegel, whom Schopenhauer had also described as a "clumsy charlatan".&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer, Arthur. Author's preface to "On The Fourfold Root of the Principle of sufficient reason. Page 1. [[:s:On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason|On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, only five students ended up attending Schopenhauer's lectures so he dropped out of [[academia]]. Kierkegaard criticized Hegel's "absolute knowledge" unity.&lt;ref&gt;Søren Kierkegaard Concluding Unscientific Postscriptt&lt;/ref&gt; The physicist and philosopher [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] also criticized the obscure complexity of Hegel's works, referring to Hegel's writing as an "unclear thoughtless flow of words".&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig Boltzmann, ''Theoretical physics and philosophical problems: Selected writings'', p. 155, [[D. Reidel]], 1974, {{ISBN|90-277-0250-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar vein, Robert Pippin notes that some view Hegel as having "the ugliest prose style in the history of the German language".&lt;ref&gt;Robert B. Pippin, ''Hegel's Idealism: The Satisfaction of Self-Consciousness (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1989), 5&lt;/ref&gt; Russell wrote in ''[[A History of Western Philosophy]]'' (1945) that Hegel was "the hardest to understand of all the great philosophers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|title=A History of Western Philosophy|date=1972|page=730}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karl Popper]] wrote that "there is so much philosophical writing (especially in the Hegelian school) which may justly be criticized as meaningless verbiage".&lt;ref&gt;Karl Popper, ''Conjectures and Refutations: The Growth of Scientific Knowledge'' (New York: Routledge, 1963), 94.&lt;/ref&gt; Popper also makes the claim in the second volume of ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]'' (1945) that Hegel's system formed a thinly veiled justification for the [[Absolute monarchy|absolute rule]] of [[Frederick William III of Prussia|Frederick William III]] and that Hegel's idea of the ultimate goal of history was to reach a [[sovereign state|state]] approximating that of 1830s [[Prussia]]. Popper further proposed that Hegel's philosophy served not only as an inspiration for [[communism|communist]] and [[fascism|fascist]] totalitarian governments of the 20th century, whose dialectics allow for any belief to be construed as rational simply if it could be said to exist. Kaufmann and [[Shlomo Avineri]] have criticized Popper's theories about Hegel.&lt;ref&gt;See for instance Walter Kaufmann (1959), [http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/us/kaufmann.htm ''The Hegel Myth and Its Method'']&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Isaiah Berlin]] listed Hegel as one of the six architects of modern [[authoritarianism]] who undermined [[liberal democracy]], along with Rousseau, [[Claude Adrien Helvétius]], Fichte, [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Saint-Simon]] and [[Joseph de Maistre]].&lt;ref&gt;Berlin, Isaiah, ''Freedom and Betrayal: Six Enemies of Human Liberty'' (Princeton University Press, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

Voegelin argued that Hegel should be understood not as a philosopher, but as a "sorcerer", i.e. as a [[mysticism|mystic]] and [[Hermeticism|hermetic]] thinker.&lt;ref&gt;Voegelin, Eric (1972). "On Hegel—A Study in Sorcery", in  J. T. Fraser, F. Haber &amp; G. Muller (eds.), ''The Study of Time''. Springer-Verlag. 418--451 (1972)&lt;/ref&gt; This concept of Hegel as a hermetic thinker was elaborated by Glenn Alexander Magee,&lt;ref&gt;Magee, Glenn Alexander (2001), ''Hegel and the Hermetic Tradition'', Ithaca: Cornell University Press&lt;/ref&gt; who argued that interpreting Hegel's body of work as an expression of mysticism and hermetic ideas leads to a more accurate understanding of Hegel.&lt;ref&gt;"I do not argue that merely that we ''can'' understand Hegel as a Hermetic thinker, just as we can understand him as a German or a Swabian or an idealist thinker. Instead, I argue that we ''must'' understand Hegel as a Hermetic thinker, if we are to truly understand him at all." Magee 2001, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an FBI Intelligence Assessment from 2006, the [[FBI Counterterrorism Division]] provides an overview of white supremacist infiltration of law enforcement and mentions that use of the term came to the agency's attention in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=FBI Counterterrorism Division|title=White Supremacist Infiltration of Law Enforcement|url=http://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/402521/doc-26-white-supremacist-infiltration.pdf|accessdate=31 January 2017|date=17 October 2006|quote=(U/LES) Since coming to law enforcement attention in late 2004, the term ''ghost skins'' has gained currency among white supremacists to describe those who avoid overt display of their beliefs to blend into society and covertly advance white supremacist causes. One internet posting described this effort as a form of role-playing in which "to create the character, you must get inside the mind of the person you are trying to duplicate."* Such role playing has an application to ad-hoc and organized law enforcement infiltration. At least one white supremacist group has reportedly encouraged ghost skins to seek positions in law enforcement for the capability of alerting skinhead crews of pending investigative action against them.&lt;br/&gt;(U/LES) Leaders in the white supremacist movement have advocated confronting suspected infiltrators and to instruct them to provide their FBI handlers with low level information that will minimally impact the group's activities. Another as yet undocumented infiltration strategy is for members to "walk in" to law enforcement agencies and offer information to determine an agency's interest in the organization.&lt;br/&gt;*(U) http://www.nukeisrael.com/ghost%20skin.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ghost Aryan Skin Warrior|url=http://nukeisrael.com/ghost%20skin.htm|accessdate=31 January 2017|date=4 February 2005|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050204162439/http://nukeisrael.com/ghost%20skin.htm|archivedate=4 February 2005|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FBI report on Police infiltration ...

'''"Good cop/bad cop" routine''', also called '''joint questioning''' or '''friend and foe''',&lt;ref&gt;See the declassified [[CIA]] ''Human Resource Exploitation Training Manual'' (1983), pp. 26-27. [http://www.gwu.edu/%7Ensarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB122/CIA%20Human%20Res%20Exploit%20H0-L17.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; is a psychological tactic used in [[negotiation]] and [[interrogation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Working Together but in Opposition: An Examination of the "Good-Cop/Bad-Cop" Negotiating Team Tactic |date= March 2000 |volume= 81 |issue= 2 |pages= 155–177 |journal= Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes |url= http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749597899928790 |accessdate= 24 January 2015 |authors= Susan Brodt &amp; Marla Tuchinsky |doi=10.1006/obhd.1999.2879}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Good cop/bad cop" tactics involve a team of two interrogators who take apparently opposing approaches to the subject. The interrogators may interview the subject alternately or may confront the subject at the same time.

==Technique==
The "bad cop" takes an aggressive, negative stance towards the subject, making blatant accusations, derogatory comments, threats, and in general creating [[antipathy]] between the subject and himself. This sets the stage for the "good cop" to act sympathetically, appearing supportive and understanding, and in general showing [[sympathy]] for the subject. The good cop will also defend the subject from the bad cop. The subject may feel they can cooperate with the good cop either out of [[Trust (social sciences)|trust]] or out of fear of the bad cop. They may then seek protection by and trust the good cop and provide the information the interrogators are seeking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=sBvHPS8iNI4C&amp;lpg=PA389&amp;dq=good%20cop%20bad%20cop%20tactic&amp;pg=PA389#v=onepage&amp;q=good%20cop%20bad%20cop%20tactic&amp;f=false |title= Promoting Community Change: Making it Happen in the Real World |publisher= Cengage Learning |year= 2010 |author= Mark Homan |isbn= 0840031955 |accessdate= 24 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This technique also has its disadvantages in that it can be easily identified and the "bad cop" may alienate the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-1ZX88iEZIYC&amp;lpg=PA114&amp;ots=l82ixe-HCU&amp;dq=good%20cop%20bad%20cop%20tactic&amp;pg=PA115#v=onepage |title= Mastering Business Negotiation |year= 2011 |publisher= John Wiley &amp; Sons |authors= Roy J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4887">'''Henrik Plenge Jakobsen''' (born 1967 in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]]) is a Danish [[conceptual art]]ist, who works in a variety of media, from [[sculpture]] and [[installation art]] to [[performance art]] and public intervention.

He has studied at the [[Royal Danish Academy of Art]], Copenhagen, Denmark, from 1987–94, [[École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts]] and Institut des Hautes Etudes en Art plastique, [[Paris|Paris, France]], from 1992-93.

Henrik Plenge Jakobsen lives in Copenhagen.

== Work ==
Plenge Jakobsens project is socio-critical in the sense that he examines and discusses political, economical, cultural and social structures forming the foundation of modern life. Like the [[Situationist International|Situationists]], he is interested in finding a meaningful art form capable of defining a place in the public space, while directly making use of everyday institutions. His project does not seek to cannibalize reality but to incorporate reality into the work itself. His work is radical exactly because it insists on the work’s real presence rather than interrogating the foundation of reality. For Plenge Jakobsen, art and reality are not separate spheres that can be temporarily forced together. Existing in the world, art represents one of the realities that constitute life.
Henrik Plenge Jakobsens work can be described as a configuration of visual elements in spatial arrangements, often involving an additional element of action or performance. Many of his works combine sculptural elements and objects in a plastic display positioned between sculpture and installation. Differing from the theatrical and systemic, “total” form of classic [[installation art]]. Plenge Jakobsens installation stratagems are based on a more unrestrained, flexible arrangement in which the room is merely an arbitrary architectural frame rather than a meaningful collaborator.&lt;ref&gt;Marianne Torp: ''All that is Solid Melts into Air'', Henrik Plenge Jakobsen: ''J’accuse'', Pork Salad Press, 2006, pp. 4-13&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12189">The '''identity of indiscernibles''' is an [[ontology|ontological]] principle that states that there cannot be separate [[object (philosophy)|object]]s or [[entity|entities]] that have all their [[property (philosophy)|properties]] in common. That is, entities ''x'' and ''y'' are identical if every [[predicate (logic)|predicate]] possessed by ''x'' is also possessed by ''y'' and vice versa; to suppose two things indiscernible is to suppose the same thing under two names. It states that no two distinct things (such as [[snowflake]]s) can be exactly alike, but this is intended as a metaphysical principle rather than one of natural science. A related principle is the indiscernibility of identicals, discussed below.

A form of the principle is attributed to the German philosopher [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]].  It is one of his two great metaphysical principles, the other being the [[principle of sufficient reason]]. Both are famously used in his arguments with [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] and [[Samuel Clarke|Clarke]] in the [[Leibniz–Clarke correspondence]]. Because of its association with Leibniz, the principle is sometimes known as '''Leibniz's law'''. 

Some philosophers have decided, however, that it is important to exclude certain predicates (or purported predicates) from the principle in order to avoid either triviality or contradiction. An example (detailed below) is the predicate that denotes whether an object is equal to ''x'' (often considered a valid predicate). As a consequence, there are a few different versions of the principle in the philosophical literature, of varying logical strength—and some of them are termed "the strong principle" or "the weak principle" by particular authors, in order to distinguish between them.&lt;ref name=Forrest2008&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last=Forrest | first=Peter | title=The Identity of Indiscernibles | encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | date=Fall 2008 |editor=Edward N. Zalta | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2008/entries/identity-indiscernible/ |accessdate=2012-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Willard Van Orman Quine]] thought that the failure of [[substitutivity]] in intensional contexts (e.g., "Sally believes that ''p''" or "It is necessarily the case that ''q''") shows that [[modal logic]] is an impossible project.&lt;ref&gt;Quine, W. V. O. "Notes on Existence and Necessity." ''The Journal of Philosophy'', Vol.&amp;nbsp;40, No.&amp;nbsp;5 (March 4, 1943), pp. 113–127&lt;/ref&gt; [[Saul Kripke]] holds that this failure may be the result of the use of the [[disquotational principle]] implicit in these proofs, and not a failure of substitutivity as such.&lt;ref name="belief"&gt;Kripke, Saul. "A Puzzle about Belief". First appeared in, ''Meaning and Use''. ed., A.&amp;nbsp;Margalit. Dordrecht: D.&amp;nbsp;Reidel, 1979. pp. 239–283&lt;/ref&gt;

The identity of indiscernibles has been used to motivate notions of [[Quantum contextuality|noncontextuality]] within quantum mechanics.

Associated with this principle is also the question as to whether it is a [[logical]] principle, or merely an [[empirical]] principle.

==Identity and indiscernibility==
There are two principles here that must be distinguished (equivalent versions of each are given in the language of the predicate calculus).&lt;ref name=Forrest2008 /&gt; Note that these are all [[Second-order logic|second-order]] expressions. Neither of these principles can be expressed in [[first-order logic]] (are [[nonfirstorderizability|nonfirstorderizable]]).

#The indiscernibility of identicals
#*For any ''x'' and ''y'', if ''x'' is identical to ''y'', then ''x'' and ''y'' have all the same properties.
#*:&lt;math&gt;\forall x \, \forall y \, [x=y \rightarrow \forall P(Px \leftrightarrow Py)]&lt;/math&gt;
#The identity of indiscernibles

Principle 1 doesn't entail [[reflexive relation|reflexivity]] of = (or any other relation ''R'' substituted for it), but both properties together entail [[Symmetric relation|symmetry]] and [[Transitive relation|transitivity]] (see proof box). Therefore, Principle 1 and reflexivity is sometimes used as a (second-order) [[Axiomatic system|axiomatization]] for the equality relation.

Principle 1 is taken to be a [[logical truth]] and (for the most part) uncontroversial.&lt;ref name=Forrest2008 /&gt; Principle&amp;nbsp;2, on the other hand, is controversial; [[Max Black]] famously argued against it.

The above formulations are not satisfactory, however: the second principle should be read as having an implicit side-condition excluding any predicates that are equivalent (in some sense) to any of the following:{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}
#"is identical to ''x''"
#"is identical to ''y''"
#"is not identical to ''x''"
#"is not identical to ''y''"
If all such predicates are included, then the second principle as formulated above can be trivially and uncontroversially shown to be a [[tautology (logic)|logical tautology]]: if ''x'' is non-identical to ''y'', then there will always be a putative "property" that distinguishes them, namely "being identical to ''x''".

On the other hand, it is incorrect to exclude all predicates that are [[materially equivalent]] (i.e., [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingent]]ly equivalent) to one or more of the four given above. If this is done, the principle says that in a universe consisting of two non-identical objects, because all distinguishing predicates are materially equivalent to at least one of the four given above (in fact, they are each materially equivalent to two of them), the two non-identical objects are identical—which is a contradiction.

==Critique==
===Symmetric universe===
[[Max Black]] has argued against the identity of indiscernibles by counterexample. Notice that to show that the identity of indiscernibles is false, it is sufficient that one provides a [[Model theory|model]] in which there are two distinct (numerically nonidentical) things that have all the same properties. He claimed that in a symmetric universe wherein only two symmetrical spheres exist, the two spheres are two distinct objects even though they have all their properties in common.&lt;ref&gt;''Metaphysics: An Anthology''. eds. J. Kim and E. Sosa, Blackwell Publishing, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Black's argument appears significant because it shows that even relational properties (properties specifying distances between objects in space-time) fail to distinguish two identical objects in a symmetrical universe. Per his argument, two objects are, and will remain, equidistant from the universe's plane of symmetry and each other. Even bringing in an external observer to label the two spheres distinctly does not solve the problem, because it violates the symmetry of the universe.

===Indiscernibility of identicals===
As stated above, the principle of indiscernibility of identicals—that if two objects are in fact one and the same, they have all the same properties—is mostly uncontroversial. However, one famous application of the indiscernibility of identicals was by [[René Descartes]] in his ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]''. Descartes concluded that he could not doubt the existence of himself (the famous ''[[Cogito ergo sum|cogito]]'' argument), but that he ''could'' doubt the existence of his body.

This argument is criticized by some modern philosophers on the grounds that it allegedly derives a conclusion about what is true from a premise about what people know.  What people know or believe about an entity, they argue, is not really a characteristic of that entity. A response may be that the argument in the ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]'' is that the inability of Descartes to doubt the existence of his mind is part of his mind's [[essence]]. One may then argue that identical things should have identical essences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books/p/princeton?id=8sN_sdfBpGIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;cd=1&amp;source=gbs_ViewAPI&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=Between Two Worlds: A Reading of Descartes's Meditations | first=John Peter | last=Carriero | publisher=Princeton University Press | year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous counterexamples are given to debunk Descartes' reasoning via ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'', such as the following argument based on a [[secret identity]]:

#Entities ''x'' and ''y'' are identical if and only if any predicate possessed by ''x'' is also possessed by ''y'' and vice versa.
#Clark Kent is Superman's secret identity; that is, they're the same person (identical) but people don't know this fact.
#[[Lois Lane]] thinks that [[Clark Kent]] cannot fly.
#Lois Lane thinks that [[Superman]] can fly.
#Therefore Superman has a property that Clark Kent does not have, namely that Lois Lane thinks that he can fly.
#Therefore, Superman is not identical to Clark Kent.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.calstatela.edu/faculty/dpitt/Egos.pdf | title=Alter Egos and Their Names | first=David | last=Pitt | journal=The Journal of Philosophy | volume=98 | issue=10 | date=October 2001 | pages=531–552, 550 | doi=10.2307/3649468 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060508170350/http://www.calstatela.edu/faculty/dpitt/Egos.pdf | archivedate=2006-05-08 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Since in proposition&amp;nbsp;6 we come to a contradiction with proposition&amp;nbsp;2, we conclude that at least one of the premises is wrong. Either:
#* Leibniz's law is wrong; or
#* A person's knowledge about ''x'' is not a predicate of ''x''; or
#* The application of Leibniz's law is erroneous; the law is only applicable in cases of monadic, not polyadic, properties; or
#* What people think about are not the actual objects themselves; or
#* A person is capable of holding conflicting beliefs.
:::Any of which will undermine Descartes' argument.&lt;ref name="belief" /&gt;

[[File:Paris - Playing chess at the Jardins du Luxembourg - 2966.jpg|thumb|Intellect is often referred to the rational and logical side of the human mind.]]&lt;!-- NOTE TO EDITORS: See talk page: this mini-article is an attempt to provide a suitable target for the many current and future article text links to "Intellect". It is not appropriate to leave them as "links to disambiguation page". It may be non-standard, but seems appropriate in this case where experts in the field cannot agree which article is really "Intellect". --&gt;

'''Intellect''' is a term used in studies of the [[human]] [[mind]], and refers to the ability of the mind to come to correct conclusions about what is [[truth|true]] or [[reality|real]], and about how to [[problem solving|solve problems]]. Historically the term comes from the Greek philosophical term ''nous'', which was translated into Latin as ''[[wikt:intellectus|intellectus]]'' (derived from the verb ''intelligere'', "to understand", from ''inter'', "between" and ''legere'', "to choose"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Colman|first1=Andrew M.|title=A dictionary of psychology|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford [etc.]|isbn=9780191726828|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and into French and then English as ''[[wikt:intelligence#French|intelligence]]'' (other than ''intellect''). Intellect is in fact considered as a branch of [[intelligence]] (see [[#Intellect vs intelligence|Intellect vs intelligence]]).

Discussion of the intellect can be divided into two broad areas. In both of these areas, the terms "intellect" and "intelligence" have continued to be used as related words.

* In philosophy, especially in [[classical philosophy|classical]] and [[medieval philosophy]] the intellect or ''[[nous]]'' is an important subject connected to the question of how humans can [[knowledge|know things]]. Especially during [[late antiquity]] and the [[Middle Ages]], the intellect was often proposed as a concept which could reconcile philosophical and scientific understandings of [[nature (philosophy)|nature]] with [[monotheism|monotheistic]] religious understandings, by making the intellect a link between each human [[Soul (spirit)|soul]], and the divine intellect (or intellects) of the [[cosmos]] itself. (During the Latin Middle Ages a distinction developed whereby the term "intelligence" was typically used to refer to the incorporeal beings which governed the celestial spheres in many of these accounts.&lt;ref name=Davidson&gt;{{Citation|title=Alfarabi, Avicenna, and Averroes, on Intellect|last=Davidson|first=Herbert|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1992}} page 6.&lt;/ref&gt;) Also see: [[passive intellect]] and [[active intellect]].
* In modern [[psychology]] and [[neuroscience]], intelligence and intellect are used as terms describing mental ability (or [[Theory of multiple intelligences|abilities]]) that allow people to [[understanding|understand]]. A distinction is sometimes made whereby intellect is considered to be related to "facts" in contrast to intelligence concerning "feelings".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-consciousness-question/201205/intellect-and-intelligence|title=Intellect and Intelligence|website=Psychology Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intellect refers to the cognition and rational mental processes gained through external input rather than internal.

A person who uses intelligence (thought and reason) and [[critical thinking|critical]] or [[Logic|analytical]] reasoning in either a [[profession]]al or a [[Individual capacity|personal capacity]] is often referred to as an [[intellectual]].

== Intellect vs intelligence ==
Intellect is often considered to be a branch of [[intelligence]] reflecting mainly its logical and rational side.

Because of the lack of [[emotion]]al and sensitive engagement, intellect is sometimes considered to be strictly limited to [[fact]]s and not going beyond mere raw knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.dhyanapeetam.org/article/instinct-intellect-intelligence-intuition#gsc.tab=0|title = Instinct, intellect, intelligence, intuition|date = |accessdate = 29 October 2015|website = Nithyananda Sangha|publisher = |last = Sangha|first = Nithyananda}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, intellect can carry a high level of complexity and thus avoid linear and formal logic patterns by referring to such mental processes as, for example, [[fuzzy logic]] and [[dialectical logic]].&lt;ref&gt;Rowan, John (1989). ''The Intellect''. SAGE Social Science Collections.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development of intellect&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Psychology of Knowledge, Development of the Intellect|url = http://augustinianparadigm.com/psychology_of_knowledge.htm|website = augustinianparadigm.com|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; ==
[[Experience]] plays a crucial role in the formation of intellect. Through solving life problems people can reach intellectual enlightenment and improve their [[behavior]]al patterns to act more reasonably and appropriately in the future. Therefore, intellectual development is encouraged by the feeling of dissatisfaction gained from particular situation’s outcome and the emanating search for better solutions. Only experience can provide people with genuine and thoughtful [[understanding]] of [[reality]], which consequently contributes to intellectual development.

Understanding is built upon creating a [[conceptual model|model]] of the reality through human [[perception]] and [[cognition|cognitive reflection]]. The process of finding solutions to life problems enriches human mental “database” of reality attributes. When acquiring the most accurate understanding of the surrounding world, the model mirrored in human [[mind]] becomes very similar or identical to the reality and that is when the intellect releases its full potential.

Intellect that reaches its maturity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=chief|first1=Gary R. VandenBos, editor in|title=APA dictionary of psychology|date=2006|publisher=American Psychological Association|location=Washington, DC.|isbn=978-1-59147-380-0|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; is referred as self-management. At this state intellect can encounter every problem it faces and not only change itself in the most efficient manner, but also alter the reality in the most desirable way. Overall, success and [[failure]] turn to depend primarily on the extent of intellectual capabilities.
[[File:Guilford model.jpg|thumb|349x349px|Intellect structure by J.P.Guilford]]

== Intellect structure ==
According to [[J. P. Guilford|J.P.Guilford]], intellect consists of three key parameters: operations, contents and products. Each parameter contains specific elements, which are independent and therefore should be measured individually and considered as autonomous units of human intellect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Structure of Intellect (J.P. Guilford)|url = http://www.instructionaldesign.org/theories/intellect.html|website = www.instructionaldesign.org|accessdate = 2015-10-28|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Operations are represented by [[cognition]], [[memory]], [[divergent thinking|divergent]] and [[convergent thinking|convergent production]], and [[evaluation]]. Content can be figural, [[symbol]]ic, [[semantics|semantic]] and behavioral. Products are divided into units, classes, [[Relation of Ideas|relations]], systems, transformations and implications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Guilford's 'structure of intellect' model|url = http://homepages.which.net/~gk.sherman/mbaaaaab.htm|website = homepages.which.net|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Intellect in therapy ==
[[Intellectualization]] is a therapeutic method, which is based on avoiding emotional penetration through intense intellectual focus. When exercising this technique, the problem that can cause psychological disturbance is approached from rational, cool and scientific attitude. It is one of the [[defense mechanisms]] described by [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] that blocks [[feeling]]s to prevent human [[psyche (psychology)|psyche]] from [[anxiety]] and [[Stress (psychological)|stress]].
	
The principle that shapes intellectualization involves Freud’s concept of [[Id, ego and super-ego]]. [[Ego psychology|Ego]] is a conscious part of [[Personality|human personality]], Id refers to unconscious, “dark” side of human nature driven by animal instincts, and super-ego is a controlling mechanism that adjusts people’s actions and behavior to social norms and expectations. The purpose of intellectualization is to isolate Id and make conscious aspects of life the only object of reflection and consideration. Therefore, this defense mechanism aims to protect ego from unconscious processes, which are often impossible to handle and control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Teaching Psychology - Defense Mechanisms|url = http://www.healthguidance.org/entry/13951/1/Teaching-Psychology--Defense-Mechanisms.html|website = www.healthguidance.org|accessdate = 2015-10-25|last = Lemouse, M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the ways to launch intellectualization is to use [[jargon]] and complex [[Scientific terminology|scientific terms]] instead of regularly used words. A common example is saying “carcinoma” instead of “cancer” if a doctor wants to mitigate the effect of announcing the disease by driving patient’s attention away from the illness and approaching it more systematically to avoid emotional outburst.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Intellectualization: isolation from emotions!(A Psychological Tranquilizer) {{!}} Mindful Cogitations|url = http://abhakhetarpal.in/blog/intellectualization-isolation-from-emotions|website = abhakhetarpal.in|accessdate = 2015-10-26|last = Khetarpal, A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, intellectualization is sometimes criticized because of its disregard of feelings. That subsequently leads to the full denial of [[intuition]], which sometimes contributes to [[Decision-making|decision-making process]]. Moreover, the absence of emotional stimuli can deprive people from [[motivation]] and therefore lead to dissatisfaction and [[Depression (mood)|melancholy]]. Furthermore, “emotional constipation” threats human [[Creativity|creativity capabilities]] by replacing them with more matter-of-fact solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = On Finding Out How We Don't Know Ourselves in Therapy and Counselling.

The '''International Movement Writing Alphabet''' (IMWA) is a set of symbols that can be used to describe and record movement. Its creator, Valerie Sutton, also invented ''MovementWriting'', which employs IMWA in four general application areas: [[SignWriting]] for [[sign language]], [[DanceWriting]] as a form of [[dance notation]], MimeWriting for classic [[mime]], and SportsWriting for [[ice skating]] and [[gymnastics]].

==Identification numbers==
The IMWA has more than 27,000 elements that are represented by unique identification numbers. Each identification number specifies six attributes—{{clarify span|category, group, symbol, variation, fill, and rotation|date=April 2014}}—as dash-separated values. The symbol is specified with a three-digit value whereas all other attributes use a two-digit value (e.g., 01-01-001-01-01-01).

There are eight categories: hand, movement, face, head, upper body, full body, space, and punctuation.{{clarify|date=April 2014}}

There are 40 groups{{clarify|date=April 2014}}. The {{clarify span|keyboard design and symbol palette|date=April 2014}} are based on the 40 groups.

==History==
[[File:Explaining ase Wikipedia at SDPL jeh.jpg|thumb|Valerie Sutton]]
The IMWA was originally designed for describing sign language and consequently was named ''Sutton's Sign Symbol Sequence'' (SSS) by its inventor, Valerie Sutton. The original symbol set, SSS-95, was limited in size due to memory constraints in personal computers at the time. The SSS-99 symbol set expanded the number of symbols, and the SSS-2002 set was the first to use the current identification numbering system. The final version, SSS-2004, was renamed ''International Movement Writing Alphabet'' (SSS-IMWA) to reflect its usefulness in applications beyond sign language.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1333">In [[mathematics]], in the field of  [[differential geometry]], an '''Iwasawa manifold''' is a compact quotient of a 3-dimensional complex [[Heisenberg group]] by a [[cocompact]], [[Discrete group|discrete]] subgroup.  An 
Iwasawa manifold is a [[nilmanifold]], of real dimension 6.

Iwasawa manifolds give examples where the first two terms ''E''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''E''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of the [[Frölicher spectral sequence]] are not isomorphic. 

As a [[complex manifold]], such an Iwasawa manifold is an important example of
a compact complex manifold which does not admit any [[Kähler metric]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2396">A '''Jones diagram''' is a type of [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian graph]] developed by [[Loyd A. Jones]] in the 1940s, where each axis represents a different [[Variable (mathematics)|variable]]. In a Jones diagram opposite directions of an axis represent different quantities, unlike in a Cartesian graph where they represent positive or negative [[sign (mathematics)|signs]] of the same quantity. The Jones diagram therefore represents four variables. Each quadrant shares the vertical axis with its horizontal neighbor, and the horizontal axis with the vertical neighbor. For example, the top left quadrant shares its vertical axis with the top right quadrant, and the horizontal axis with the bottom left quadrant. The overall system response is in [[quadrant (plane geometry)|quadrant]] I; the variables that contribute to it are in quadrants II through IV.

==Jones diagrams in photography==

A common application of Jones diagrams is in [[photography]], specifically in displaying sensitivity to light with what are also called "[[tone reproduction]] diagrams". These diagrams are used in the design of photographic systems ([[photographic film|film]], [[photographic paper|paper]], etc.) to determine the relationship between the light a viewer would see at the time a photo was taken to the light that a viewer would see looking at the finished photograph.

The Jones diagram concept can be used for variables that depend successively on each other. Jones's original diagram used eleven quadrants{{how|date=May 2013}} to show all the elements of his photographic system.

A '''late fee''', also known as an ''overdue fine'', ''late fine'', or ''past due fee'', is a charge fined against a client by a company or organization for not paying a bill or returning a rented or borrowed item by its due date. Its use is most commonly associated with businesses like creditors, video rental outlets and [[library|libraries]]. Late fees are generally calculated on a per day, per item basis.

Organizations encourage the payment of late fees by suspending a client's borrowing or rental privileges until accumulated fees are paid, sometimes after these fees have exceeded a certain level.

Late fees are widely regarded as an [[annoyance]]. In 2005, video rental chain [[Blockbuster Video]] capitalized on this perception with a major [[advertising campaign]] that touted a revision of its rental policy as "The End of Late Fees".

More recently, in 2006, [[Rogers Video]] has used the same technique, except only for movies, and without any [[restocking fee]] (due to movies costing much less than video games).

Late fees charged by banks, landlords, and utilities have been heavily criticized as a penalty against the poor, and attempts have been made in some places to outlaw them completely or place caps on them. The argument against them is that the poor will inevitably be forced to pay them as they cannot earn the money to pay their bills by the due date. These people will be forced to pay even higher fees for the same services, and will find making future timely payments to their creditors even more difficult.

Late fees are issued to people who do not pay on time and don't honor a lease or obligation that they are responsible for.

A special use of the term late fee is additional postage that was once required by Post Offices to allow inclusion of a letter or package in the outgoing mail dispatch although having been posted later than the normal closing time for mail. Often a special Late Fee Box was provided.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4236">In [[topology]], a branch of [[mathematics]], the '''loop space''' Ω''X'' of a [[pointed space|pointed topological space]] ''X'' is the space of (based) loops in ''X'', maps from the [[circle]] ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; to ''X'', equipped with the [[compact-open topology]]. Two loops can be multiplied by concatenation. With this operation, the loop space is an [[A-infinity operad|''A''&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;-space]]. That is, the multiplication is [[homotopy|homotopy coherently]] [[associative property|associative]].

The set of path components of Ω''X'', i.e. the set of based homotopy of based loops in ''X'', is a group, the [[fundamental group]] ''&amp;pi;''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'').

The '''iterated loop spaces''' of ''X'' are formed by applying Ω a number of times.

There is an analogous construction for [[topological spaces]] without basepoint. The '''free loop space''' of a [[topological space]] ''X'' is the space of maps from the circle ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; to ''X'' with the [[compact-open topology]]. The free loop space of ''X'' is often denoted by &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{L}X&lt;/math&gt;. 
 
As a functor, the free loop space construction is [[right adjoint]] to [[cartesian product]] with the circle, while the loop space construction is right adjoint to the [[reduced suspension]]. This adjunction accounts for much of the importance of loop spaces in [[stable homotopy theory]]. (A related phenomenon in computer science is [[currying]], where the cartesian product is adjoint to the [[hom functor]].) Informally this is all referred to as [[Eckmann–Hilton duality]].

== Eckmann–Hilton duality ==
The loop space is dual to the [[Suspension (topology)|suspension]] of the same space; this duality is sometimes called [[Eckmann–Hilton duality]]. The basic observation is that
:&lt;math&gt;[\Sigma Z,X] \approxeq [Z, \Omega X]&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;[A,B]&lt;/math&gt; is the set of homotopy classes of maps &lt;math&gt;A \rightarrow B&lt;/math&gt;,
and &lt;math&gt;\Sigma A&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Suspension (topology)|suspension]] of A, and &lt;math&gt;\approxeq&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[natural transformation|natural]] [[homeomorphism]].  This homeomorphism is essentially that of [[currying]], modulo the quotients needed to convert the products to reduced products.

In general, &lt;math&gt;[A, B]&lt;/math&gt; does not have a group structure for arbitrary spaces &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;. However, it can be shown that &lt;math&gt;[\Sigma Z,X]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;[Z, \Omega X]&lt;/math&gt; do have natural group structures when &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; are [[Pointed space|pointed]], and the aforesaid isomorphism is of those groups.

:&lt;math&gt;\pi_k(X) \approxeq \pi_{k-1}(\Omega X)&lt;/math&gt;

This follows, since the [[homotopy group]] is defined as &lt;math&gt;\pi_k(X)=[S^k,X]&lt;/math&gt;, and the spheres can be obtained via suspensions of each-other: that is, &lt;math&gt;S^k=\Sigma S^{k-1}&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;ref&gt;[http://topospaces.subwiki.org/wiki/Loop_space_of_a_based_topological_space Topospaces wiki - Loop space of a based topological space]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mahābhūta''' is [[Sanskrit]] and [[Pāli]] for "great element."&lt;ref&gt;Or, more literally, "Great Natures." See Rhys Davids &amp; Stede (1921–25), p. 507, [http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.2:1:3646.pali entry for "Bhūta."]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hinduism==
{{Further|The 36 tattvas}}

In Hinduism's sacred literature, the "great" or "gross" elements (''mahābhūta'') are fivefold: space (or "ether"), air, fire, water and earth.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [[Monier-Williams]] Sanskrit Dictionary where ''Mahābhūta'' is defined as: "a great element, gross el[ement] (of which 5 are reckoned, viz. ether, air, fire, water, earth ..., as distinguished from the subtle el[ement] or ''Tanmātra''...)."  Monier-Williams (1899), p. 798, entry for "Mahā-," retrieved 24 Dec 2008 from "U. Cologne" at http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MWScan/MWScanpdf/mw0798-mahApheTkArIya.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=India through the ages|last=Gopal|first=Madan|year= 1990| page= 79|editor=K.S. Gautam|publisher=Publication Division, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For instance, the [[Taittiriya Upanishad|{{IAST|Taittirīya Upaniṣad}}]] describes the five "sheaths" of a person (Sanskrit: ''[[purusha|puru{{IAST|ṣ}}a]]''), starting with the grossest level of the five evolving great elements:
:From this very self (''[[Atman (Hinduism)|{{IAST|ā}}tman]]'') did space come into being; from space, air; from air, fire; from fire, the waters, from the waters, the earth; from the earth, plants; from plants, food; and from food, man.... Different from and lying within this man formed from the essence of food is the self (''{{IAST|ā}}tman'') consisting of lifebreath....  Different from and lying within this self consisting of breath is the self (''{{IAST|ā}}tman'') consisting of mind.... Different from and lying within this self consisting of mind is the self (''{{IAST|ā}}tman'') consisting of perception.... Different from and lying within this self consisting of perception is the self (''{{IAST|ā}}tman'') consisting of bliss....&lt;ref&gt;[[Taittiriya Upanishad|TU]] 2.1–2.5, trans. Olivelle (1996), pp. 185–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Shvetashvatara Upanishad|{{IAST|Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad}}]], God is identified as the source of the great elements:
:Some wise men say it is inherent nature, while others say it is time – all totally deluded.  It is rather the greatness of God present in the world by means of which this wheel of ''[[brahman]]'' goes around.  Who always encompasses this whole world – the knower, the architect of time, the one without qualities, and the all-knowing one – it is at his command that the work of creation, to be conceived of as earth, water, fire, air, and space, unfolds itself.&lt;ref&gt;[[Shvetashvatara Upanishad|SU]] 6.1–6.2, trans. Olivelle (1996), p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt;

The same Upanishad also mentions, "When earth, water fire, air and akasa arise, when the five attributes of the elements, mentioned in the books on yoga, become manifest then the yogi's body becomes purified by the fire of yoga and he is free from illness, old age and death." (Verse 2.12).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bharatadesam.com/spiritual/upanishads/svetasvatara_upanishad.php Shvetashvatara Upanishad]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhism==
In Buddhism, the four Great Elements (Pali: ''cattāro mahābhūtāni'') are earth, water, fire and air.  Mahābhūta is generally synonymous with '''catudhātu''', which is Pāli for the "Four Elements."&lt;ref&gt;Note that the Pāli word ''dhātu'' is used in multiple contexts in the [[Pali canon|Pāli canon]].  For instance, Bodhi (2000), pp. 527–8, identifies four different ways that ''dhātu'' is used including in terms of the "eighteen elements" and, as in this article, in terms of "the four primary elements."&lt;/ref&gt;  In early [[Buddhism]], the Four Elements are a basis for understanding that leads one through unbinding of 'Rupa' or materiality to the supreme state of pure 'Emptiness' or Nirvana.

===Definitions===

In the [[Pali canon]],&lt;ref&gt;These elaborations on the elements can be found in the [[Majjhima Nikaya]] discourses nos. 28, 62, 140.  See below for more information.&lt;/ref&gt; the most basic elements are usually identified as four in number but, on occasion, a fifth and, to an even lesser extent, a sixth element may be also be identified.

====Four primary elements====

In canonical texts, the four Great Elements refer to elements that are both "external" (that is, outside the body, such as a river) and "internal" (that is, of the body, such as blood).  These elements are described as follows:

*'''Earth element''' (''pru{{IAST|ṭ}}havī-dhātu'')&lt;br&gt;Earth element represents the quality of solidity or attractive forces. Any matter where attractive forces are in prominence (solid bodies) are called earth elements. Internal earth elements include head hair, body hair, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bone, organs, intestinal material, etc.&lt;ref&gt;The traditional list of body parts associated with the earth element are the first 19 of 31 body parts – from head hair to feces – identified in the Pali Canon with the contemplation of [[Patikulamanasikara]], with the catch all phrase of "or whatever else internal, within oneself, is hard, solid, &amp; sustained" (trans. [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.028.than.html Thanissaro, 2003b)] added.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Water (or liquid) element''' (''āpa-dhātu'')&lt;br&gt;Water element represents the quality of Liquidity or relative motion. Any matter where relative motion of particles is in prominence are called water elements. Internal water elements include bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, nasal mucus, urine, semen, etc.&lt;ref&gt;The traditional list of water-element body parts are the latter twelve of 31 body parts – from bile to urine – identified in [[Patikulamanasikara]] contemplations, with the catch all phrase of "or whatever else internal, within oneself, is liquid, watery, &amp; sustained" (trans. [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.028.than.html Thanissaro, 2003b)] added.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Fire element''' (''teja-dhātu'')&lt;br&gt;Fire element represents the quality of heat or energy. Any matter where energy is in prominence are called fire elements. Internal fire elements include those bodily mechanisms that produce physical warmth, ageing, digestion, etc.
*'''Air (or wind) element''' (''vāyu-dhātu'')&lt;br&gt;Air element represents the quality of expansion or repulsive forces. Any matter where repulsive forces are in prominence are called air elements. Internal air elements includes air associated with the pulmonary system (for example, for breathing), the intestinal system ("winds in the belly and ... bowels"), etc.

Any entity that carry one or more of these qualities (attractive forces, repulsive forces, energy and relative motion) are called matter (''rupa''). The material world is considered to be nothing but a combination of these qualities arranged in space (''akasa''). The result of these qualities are the inputs to our five senses, color (''warna''), smell (''ghandda''), taste (''rasa'') and sensation of body (''ojha''). The matter that we perceive in our mind are just a mental interpretation of these qualities.

====Fifth and sixth elements====

In addition to the above four elements of underived matter, two other elements are occasionally found in the Pali Canon:&lt;ref&gt;The "space element" is encountered more frequently in the canonical discourses than is the "consciousness element."  Examples of discourses that include both of these latter elements are [[Digha Nikaya|DN]] 33 (Walshe, 1995, p. 500, para. 16), [[Majjhima Nikaya|MN]] 140 [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.140.than.html (Thanissaro, 1997c)], and [[Samyutta Nikaya|SN]] 27.9 [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn27/sn27.001-010.than.html#sn27.009 (Thanissaro, 1994).]&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Space element''' (''ākāsa-dhātu'')&lt;br&gt;Internal space elements includes bodily orifices such as the ears, nostrils, mouth, anus, etc.
{{see also|Prayer flag#Colour and order}}

*'''Consciousness element''' (''[[Vijñāna|viññā{{IAST|ṇ}}a]]-dhātu'')&lt;br&gt;Described as "pure and bright" (''parisuddha{{IAST|ṃ}} pariyodāta{{IAST|ṃ}}''), used to cognise the three feelings (''[[vedana]]'') of pleasure, pain and neither-pleasure-nor-pain, and the arising and passing of the sense contact (''[[phassa]]'') upon which these feelings are dependent.

According to the [[Abhidhamma Pitaka]], the "space element" is identified as "secondary" or "derived" (''upādā'').&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton (2001), pp. 5, 35 ''n''. 9.  For more information regarding "primary/underived" and "secondary/derived" matter, see the article [[Rupa (Buddhism)|Rupa]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sensory qualities, not substances===

[[Rūpa]] (matter) means both materiality and sensibility—it signifies, for example, a tactile object both insofar as that object is tactile and that it can be sensed. Rūpa is never a materiality which can be separated or isolated from cognizance; such a non-empirical category is incongruous in the context of early Buddhism. Rūpa is not a substratum or substance which has sensibility as a property. It functions in early Buddhist thought as perceivable physicality. Matter, or rūpa, is defined in its function; what it does, not what it is.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Lusthaus, ''Buddhist Phenomenology: A Philosophical Investigation of Yogācāra Buddhism and the Chʼeng Wei-shih Lun.'' Routledge, 2002, page 183.&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the four great elements are conceptual abstractions drawn from the sensorium. They are sensorial typologies, and are not metaphysically materialistic.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Lusthaus, ''Buddhist Phenomenology: A Philosophical Investigation of Yogācāra Buddhism and the Chʼeng Wei-shih Lun.'' Routledge, 2002, page 184.&lt;/ref&gt; They are not meant to give an account of matter as constitutive of external, mind-independent reality.&lt;ref&gt;Noa Ronkin, ''Early Buddhist Metaphysics the Making of a Philosophical Tradition.'' Routledge, 2005, page 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soteriological uses===

The Four Elements are used in [[Buddhist]] texts to both elucidate the concept of suffering (''[[dukkha]]'') and as an object of meditation. The earliest Buddhist texts explain that the four primary material elements are the sensory qualities solidity, fluidity, temperature, and mobility; their characterisation as earth, water, fire, and air, respectively, is declared an abstraction – instead of concentrating on the fact of material existence, one observes how a physical thing is sensed, felt, perceived.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dan Lusthaus]], "What is and isn't Yogacara." He specifically discusses early Buddhism as well as Yogacara. {{cite web|url=http://www.acmuller.net/yogacara/articles/intro-uni.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100331102337/http://www.acmuller.net/yogacara/articles/intro-uni.htm |archivedate=31 March 2010 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Understanding suffering====

The Four Elements pertinence to the Buddhist notion of suffering comes about due to:

:* The Four Elements are the primary component of "form" (''[[rūpa]]'').

:* "Form" is first category of the "Five Aggregates" (''[[khandhas]]'').

:* The Five Aggregates are the ultimate basis for suffering (''dukkha'') in the "[[Four Noble Truths]]."

Schematically, this can be represented in reverse order as:

:Four Noble Truths → Suffering → Aggregates → Form → Four Elements

Thus, to deeply understand the Buddha's Four Noble Truths, it is beneficial to have an understanding of the Great Elements.

====Meditation object====

In the [[Mahasatipatthana Sutta]] ("The Greater Discourse on the Foundations of Mindfulness," [[Digha Nikaya|DN]] 22), in listing various bodily meditation techniques, the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] instructs:

:"...Just as if a skilled butcher or his assistant, having slaughtered a cow, were to sit at a crossroads with the carcass divided into portions, so a monk reviews this very body ... in terms of the elements: 'There are in this body the earth-element, the water-element, the fire-element, the air-element.' So he abides contemplating body in body internally...."&lt;ref&gt;Walshe (1995), p. 338.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Visuddhimagga's well-known list of forty meditation objects (''[[Kammaṭṭhāna|kamma{{IAST|ṭṭ}}hāna]]''), the great elements are listed as the first four objects.

[[B. Alan Wallace]] compares the Theravada meditative practice of "attending to the emblem of consciousness" to the practice in [[Mahamudra]] and [[Dzogchen]] of "maintaining the mind upon non-conceptuality", which is also aimed at focusing on the nature of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;B. Alan Wallace, ''The bridge of quiescence: experiencing Tibetan Buddhist meditation.'' Carus Publishing Company, 1998, page 257.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{distinguish|text=the [[Mau-Mau Uprising]] in Kenya (1952–1960) or the [[Maji Maji Rebellion]] in German East Africa (1905–1907). For other uses of the term maimai, see [[Maimai (disambiguation)]]}}
[[File:Mai Mai Katanga.jpg|thumb|Mai-Mai fighters surrendering their weapons to United Nations personnel in Northern Katanga, 2006]]
The term '''Mai-Mai''' or '''Mayi-Mayi''' refers to any kind of community-based militia group active in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (DRC), formed to defend their local territory against other armed groups. Most were formed to resist the invasion of [[Rwanda]]n forces and Rwanda-affiliated Congolese rebel groups, but some may have formed to exploit the war for their own advantage by [[looting]], [[cattle rustling]] or [[banditry]].

Groups that fall under the umbrella term "Mai-Mai" include armed forces led by warlords, traditional tribal elders, village heads, and politically motivated resistance fighters.  Because Mai Mai have had only the most tenuous internal cohesion, different Mai-Mai groups allied themselves with a variety of domestic and foreign government and guerrilla groups at different times. The term Mai-Mai does not refer to any particular movement, affiliation or political objective but to a broad variety of groups.

Mai-Mai were particularly active in the eastern Congolese provinces bordering Rwanda, [[North Kivu]] and [[South Kivu]] (the "[[Kivus]]"), which were under the control of the Rwanda-allied [[Banyamulenge]]-dominated rebel faction, the [[Rally for Congolese Democracy–Goma]] (RCD-Goma). While militias have long been common in the Kivus, particularly among the minority [[Batembo]] and [[Babembe]] ethnic groups, the recent wars and conflicts caused large numbers of town dwellers to form Mai-Mai. Although the Mai-Mai, either as a group or as individual groups, were not party to the 1999 [[Lusaka Accord]] meant to end the war, they remained one of the most powerful forces in the conflict and the lack of cooperation from some groups has been problematic for the peace process.

==Mai-Mai in North and South Kivu==
[[File:Zaire 97 kivus.jpg|thumb|The East-central DRC, showing Kivu]]
According to a 2001 UN report, 20,000 to 30,000 Mai-Mai were active in the two Kivu provinces.  The two most powerful and well-organized Mai-Mai groups in the Kivus were led by Generals Padiri and Dunia, but now it is another ''Mai-Mai'' group which is called [[Mai-Mai Yakutumba]] which was organized in 2007 by General Yakutumba, ex-Mai-Mai in 2001. They were reported to have received aid from the government of the Democratic Republic of Congo and are widely viewed by other Mai Mai groups as the leaders, though not the commanders, of the Kivu Mai-Mai.  A number of smaller Mai-Mai groups, such as the [[Mudundu 40]]/[[Front de Résistance et de Défense du Kivu]] (FRDKI) and [[Mouvement de Lutte contre l'Agression au Zaïre]]/[[Forces Unies de Résistance Nationale contre l'Agression de la Républíque Démocratique du Congo]] (MLAZ/FURNAC), were reported to cooperate with the [[Rwanda]]n military and [[Rally for Congolese Democracy–Goma]] (RCD-Goma).

Walikale and Masisi north of Goma were the centres of Mai-Mai activity in North Kivu.  In South Kivu, there have historically been concentrations around [[Walungu]] and [[Bunyakiri]] south of [[Lake Kivu]], around [[Uvira]] and [[Mwenaga]] at the northern end of [[Lake Tanganyika]], further south around [[Fizi]], and around [[Shabunda]], between the Rwandan border and Kindu.

A Mai-Mai leader, Colonel Mayele, was arrested by UN forces in October 2010, allegedly being the leader behind mass rapes in the Walikale region of North Kivu province.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/world/2010/1007/1224280566201.html Congo rebel chief arrested over mass rape – The Irish Times – Thu, Oct 07, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mai-Mai in Katanga==
{{Main|Mai-Mai Kata Katanga}}
A former leader of the Mai-Mai, [[Gédéon Kyungu Mutanga]], turned himself over to [[MONUC]] troops in May 2006. He was found guilty of numerous war crimes between October 2003 and May 2006 and was sentenced to death by the Kipushi Military Tribunal in [[Katanga Province]] on 6 March 2009.&lt;ref name="RO060309"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.radiookapi.net/index.php?i=53&amp;a=22549| title=Kipushi : Kyungu Mutanga alias Gédéon condamné à la peine capitale| work=[[Radio Okapi]]| date=2009-03-06|accessdate = 2009-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; He escaped from prison in September 2011 and formed the [[Mai-Mai Kata Katanga]] ("Secede Katanga").&lt;ref name=bbc1&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-23422038|title=Katanga: Fighting for DR Congo's cash cow to secede|publisher=bbcnews.com|accessdate=12 September 2013|date=11 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other Mai-Mai groups==

There was a large Mai-Mai presence in [[Maniema]], in particular around [[Kindu]] and [[Kalemie]].  [[Province Orientale]] also hosts a number of Mai-Mai, but these groups were apparently involved in long-standing ethnic disputes.

''Mai-Mai Gedeon'' is also commanded by Gedeon Kyungu Mutanga and loosely tied to his Mai-Mai Kata Katanga.&lt;ref name=bbc1/&gt; The ''Corak Kata Katanga'' also known as the Co-ordination for a Referendum on Self-determination for Katanga, composed mainly of former Katanga Tigers, a separatist group active in the 1960s.&lt;ref name=bbc1/&gt; They claim to be behind the attack on the Katanga airport in February 2011. It is unclear to what extent all these groups are co-ordinated.&lt;ref name=bbc1/&gt; 

==Mai-Mai and the mountain gorillas==

In May 2007, Mai-Mai killed two [[wildlife officer]]s in [[Virunga National Park]] and threatened to kill [[mountain gorilla]]s if the government retaliated. The Mai-Mai are also suspected of the killings of nine mountain gorillas, with the use of machetes, and automatic weapons. In an October 2012 incident, Mai-Mai killed two park staff and a soldier, while three soldiers were injured. From 1990 to 2018 some 170 Virunga Rangers have died in such attacks, according to the WWF.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wwf.panda.org/wwf_news/?206549/WWF-Deeply-Saddened-By-Death-Of-Virunga-Park-Protectors WWF deeply saddened by death of Virunga park protectors (''WWF'' article)]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Six Virunga Park Rangers were reported to have been killed in Virunga National Park. Five rangers and a driver were killed in an ambush and a sixth ranger was injured in the Central section of the vast reserve on Monday April 9 2018. Officials suspected the attacks were by the Mai-Mai. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/weather/2018/apr/09/six-virunga-park-rangers-killed-in-drc-wildlife-sanctuary&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bürokratopoly ==
Bürokratopoly is an educational tabletop game. Its author Martin Böttger used to satirize the East German state in the early 1980s. The game spread in the political underground. Over 30 years after its development it was remade and optimized as a teaching aid for use in history class. Bürokratopoly captures an authentic perspective on East Germany in game form and provokes discussions of democracy, politics and human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bürokratopoly - Ein Lehrspiel aus der DDR|trans-title=|periodical=www.buerokratopoly.de|publisher=|url=http://www.buerokratopoly.de/|format=|accessdate=2016-01-16|last=DDR-Museum|date=2014|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

India's '''National Voluntary Guidelines on Social, Environmental and Economic Responsibilities of Business (NVGs)'''&lt;ref name="NVG"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.mca.gov.in/Ministry/latestnews/National_Voluntary_Guidelines_2011_12jul2011.pdf|title= National Voluntary Guidelines on Social, Environmental and Economic Responsibilities of Business (NVGs)|publisher=Ministry of Corporate Affairs|year=2011|accessdate=2014-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; were released by the [[Ministry of Corporate Affairs (India)|Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA)]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mca.gov.in/ |title=Ministry of Corporate Affairs, Government of India |publisher=mca.gov.in |date= |accessdate=2014-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; in July 2011 by Mr. Murli Deora, the former Honourable Minister for Corporate Affairs. The national framework on Business Responsibility is essentially a set of nine principles that offer businesses an Indian understanding and approach to inculcating '''responsible business''' conduct.

“Responsible Business” conduct refers to the commitment of businesses to operating in an economically, socially and environmentally sustainable manner while balancing the demands of shareholders and other interest groups. It’s about managing risks and impacts, which affect business’ ability to meet its objectives. The NVGs are formulated with the objective of creating positive framework conditions to advance the role of business in economic growth which is socially and environmentally sustainable, while also ensuring enhanced competitiveness and integration into the global markets.

The NVGs serves as a guidance document for businesses of all size, ownership, sector, and geography to achieve the [[triple bottom line]]. In 2012, subsequent to the release of the NVGs the [[Securities and Exchange Board of India| Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI)]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sebi.gov.in/sebiweb/ |title=Securities and Exchange Board of India |publisher=sebi.gov.in |date= |accessdate=2014-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; a market regulator, mandated the Annual Business Responsibility Reporting (ABRR), a reporting framework based on the NVGs.

The NVGs are unique, not just in what they represent, which is “an India specific comprehensive understanding of business responsibility”, but also in the way they have been formulated. The “process” was premised on widespread intensive stakeholder consultations to bring out the commonly agreed elements of business responsibility in keeping with India’s unique developmental challenges and priorities.

==Background==

{{Empty section|date=May 2014}}

==Drafting process==

The NVGs are the revised version of the CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) Voluntary Guidelines 2009, released in December, 2009 by the Honourable President of India, Smt. Pratibha Patil at the India Corporate Week organised by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA). The CSR Voluntary Guidelines served as a statement of intent by the Government of India to encourage businesses to adopt responsible business practices. The CSR Guidelines provided for review and elaboration which was undertaken by the Indian Institute of Corporate Affairs, a think-tank and capacity development institution set up by the MCA.

The Guidelines Drafting Committee (GDC), appointed by the MCA in 2009, started its work on the new mandate for review and elaboration of the 2009 Guidelines. The process was completed in October 2010 and the final draft was presented to the MCA on 3 November 2010. The revised guidelines were the National Voluntary Guidelines on Social, Environmental and Economic Responsibilities of Business. Stakeholders consulted during the period recommended that since the Guidelines look at a comprehensive framework of responsible business action the title of the Guideline must depict the understanding and hence they were called the NVGs. These were released by the MCA on 8 July 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pib.nic.in/newsite/erelease.aspx?relid=73107 |title=National Voluntary Guidelines on Social, Environmental &amp; Economic Responsibilities of Business Released - Press Information Bureau, Government of India - Press Release |publisher=pib.nic.in |date=2011-07-08 |accessdate=2014-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Drafting committee ===
The GDC comprised experts and practitioners from diverse stakeholder groups such as industry associations, regulatory bodies, sector experts, government, financial institutions, etc. It consisted of eleven members who were supported by an anchor team. The drafting process involved extensive consultations, conducted across cities and regions in India: Bangalore (South), New Delhi (North), Kolkata (East) and Mumbai (West). In addition to consultations, written feedback was also solicited. The Indian Institute of Corporate Affairs (IICA),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iica.in/ |title=Indian Institute of Corporate Affairs - Partners in Knowledge, Governance, Transformation |publisher=Iica.in |date= |accessdate=2014-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.india-briefing.com/news/india-releases-voluntary-national-responsibility-guidelines-4925.html/ |title=India Releases Voluntary National Responsibility Guidelines - India Briefing News |publisher=India-briefing.com |date=2011-07-21 |accessdate=2014-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; led the entire process. It worked towards developing a consensus on various ideas and perspectives that emerged from various stakeholder groups. The Guidelines were also published on the MCA website for public comments.

The brief before the GDC was to develop these guidelines to provide a distinctively 'Indian'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://india.carbon-outlook.com/content/national-voluntary-guidelines-india-inc-csr-responsible-business |title=National Voluntary Guidelines for India Inc.: from CSR to Responsible Business &amp;#124; India Carbon Outlook &amp;#124; Tracking Actions Towards a Low Carbon Economy |publisher=India Carbon Outlook |date=2011-05-19 |accessdate=2014-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  approach on business responsibility (BR), which is also aligned with international norms and frameworks.

== Business responsibility ==

Since the 1990s, liberalisation and deregulation have boosted the development of the private sector making it the forerunner of economic growth. Frenetic expansion and growth of the private sector has also therefore thrown up challenges necessitating proactive action towards making it sustainable and equitable. Encouraged by the Prime Minister’s ten Point Charter, the MCA, in the recent past, has sharpened its focus on encouraging businesses to play a proactive role in ensuring sustainable and inclusive growth.

While Indian business traditionally stuck to corporate philanthropy, today business leaders understand that practicing responsible business is of strategic importance to their growth, longevity and competitiveness. The NVGs are an embodiment of an integrated and comprehensive understanding of responsible business. The Guidelines encourage and enable businesses to go beyond compliance and embrace sustainability as part of their business ethos. The nine principles and the corresponding indicators encompass all the elements of what constitutes responsible business conduct. It also delineates the fundamentals of implementing the NVGs.

These are:

#Leadership: the commitment and role of leadership, 
#Integration: the weaving in of the principles and core elements into the very DNA of the business, 
#Engagement: continuous engagement with relevant stakeholders,
#Reporting: measuring the impact of business activities on all the nine principles and communicating these to their  stakeholders.

==Corporate social responsibility in India==

Traditionally, [[Corporate Social Responsibility|Corporate Social Responsility (CSR)]] has been widely practiced by Indian corporates - taking the form of philanthropic activities. The new CSR legislation under section 135 of the [[Companies Act, 2013|Companies Act 2013]] requires companies of a certain size to spend 2% of their net profit &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2013/08/13/companies-bill-csr-idINDEE97C02Q20130813 |title=Companies bill would require firms to spend 2 percent profits on poor |publisher=reuters.com |date=2013-08-13 |accessdate=2014-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; on activities as prescribed under schedule VII, which are primarily aimed at community development. The canvas of CSR remains narrow and de-linked from the core-business activities of a company. However, the more progressive businesses view the legislation as opportunity to address the developmental challenges of India through sustainable innovations and creation of shared value. Principle 8 of the NVGs expounds on this very concept, while also acknowledging the need for community development as articulated under the new CSR law. Principle 8 of the NVGs on “inclusive and equitable growth” focuses on encouraging business action on national development priorities, including community development initiatives and strategic CSR&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://greencleanguide.com/2011/10/02/csr-voluntary-guidelines/ |title=CSR Voluntary Guidelines by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, Government of India &amp;#124; For the Changing Planet |publisher=Greencleanguide.com |date=2011-10-02 |accessdate=2014-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on the shared value concept.

==Principles on responsible business==

The NVGs are an aspirational and comprehensive guideline to encourage responsible business behaviour in India. The NVGs, a set of 9 principles,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.sustainabilityoutlook.in/content/library/national-voluntary-guidelines-social-environmental-and-economic-responsibilities-bus |title=National Voluntary Guidelines for the Social, Environmental and Economic Responsibilities of Business (NVG-SEE) 2011 |publisher=sustainabilityoutlook.in |date=2012-01-24 |accessdate=2014-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; cover a broad array of social, economic, environmental and governance issues and developmental priorities. To actualise the principles a corresponding set of core elements have also been developed. The NVGs also offer guidance on implementation, through its four integral actions – leadership, integration, engagement and reporting. The annexes articulate the business case for adopting the NVGs, existing legislation relevant to the various principles and a set of resources. A special section has been dedicated on the applicability of the principles for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), to ensure inclusivity irrespective of scale.

=== The nine principles ===
[[File:The NVG Package.png|thumbnail|right|The NVG Package]]

:: '''Principle 1:''' ''Businesses should conduct and govern themselves with ethics, transparency and accountability
:: '''Principle 2:''' ''Businesses should provide goods and services that are safe and contribute to sustainability throughout their life cycle
:: '''Principle 3:''' ''Businesses should promote the wellbeing of all employees
:: '''Principle 4:''' ''Businesses should respect the interests of, and be responsive towards all stakeholders, especially those who are disadvantaged, vulnerable and marginalised
:: '''Principle 5:''' ''Businesses should respect and promote human rights
:: '''Principle 6:''' ''Businesses should respect, protect, and make efforts to restore the environment
:: '''Principle 7:''' ''Businesses, when engaged in influencing public and regulatory policy, should do so in a responsible manner
:: '''Principle 8:''' ''Businesses should support inclusive growth and equitable development
:: '''Principle 9:''' ''Businesses should engage with and provide value to their customers and consumers in a responsible manner

==Adopting the guidelines==

The NVGs help Indian businesses at multiple levels. They enable businesses to create value, encourage healthy labour practices, minimise operational risks, attract and retain customers, motivate investments and financial markets and stimulate growth. Overall, the NVGs enable companies to leave a positive footprint on the environment and society while remaining competitive. The private sector is the economic engine of India. Poverty alleviation, job-creation, innovation at grassroots, protection of scarce resources are not only impacts of sustainable businesses but cater to nation building. With globalisation and a varied range of stakeholders demanding answers, responsible business action is gaining traction.

While the business case was considered to be the biggest motivation for adoption of the guidelines, the guidelines also underscore the importance of ‘values/ethics’ in business conduct as a driver to pursue sustainable management practices as a means to reaching sustainable development goals.

== Annual Business Responsibility Report ==

Following the release of the NVGs, the MCA reconstituted the GDC as the Disclosures Framework Committee with two additional members and tasked it with develop a disclosure framework based on the NVGs. The disclosure framework, 'Annual Business Responsibility Report' (ABRR), was formulated by the Disclosure Framework Committee to ensure wider evidence based uptake of the NVGs. The ABRR is a reporting format that requires principle-wise (NVGs) disclosure by businesses. This reporting framework helps Indian companies implement the NVGs and communicate the same to its stakeholders. It is designed on an ‘Apply or Explain’ methodology and aims at assisting companies to re-examine their processes and align them with the ethos of the NVGs.

The ‘Apply-or-Explain’ principle is an enabling measure that encourages companies to do three things:
#Disclose the current status of sustainability driven performance at whatever stage that may be.
#Disclose reasons for non-adoption of any of the principles, which may include non-applicability as per their understanding, or future plans of implementation.
#Ideally undertake a process of review to identify and manage sustainability gaps and risks in line with the future outlook of the company.

The ABRR reports can be accessed on the website of the National Stock Exchange and the Bombay Stock Exchange. The 100 companies that report are currently the top listed companies based on market capitalization at BSE and NSE. 98 companies have filed their Business Responsibility Reports (BRRs) on the websites of the National and Bombay Stock Exchanges. A linkage document was also developed and launched internationally at the GRI ([[Global Reporting Initiative]]) Conference on Sustainability in Amsterdam 2013.  The document serves as a tool for businesses to map their performance against the NVGs, ABRR and GRI G3&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.globalreporting.org/network/regional-networks/gri-focal-points/focal-point-india/Pages/default.aspx |title=GRI Focal Point India |publisher=globalreporting.org |date= |accessdate=2014-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csridentity.com/india/gri.asp |title=GRI in India |publisher=csridentity.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Securities and Exchange Board Of India directive==

The Guidelines were released by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, Government of India on 8 July 2011. Soon after, on 24 November 2011, a Board resolution was passed by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), wherein they mandated the top 100 listed companies to report on their Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) performance through a Business Responsibility Report (BRR),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/web/sebi-asks-for-business-responsibility-reports/ |title=Sebi asks for business responsibility reports |publisher=The Indian Express |date=2012-08-15 |accessdate=2014-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}}&lt;ref name="SEBI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ckinetics.com/publications/Preparedness_of_India_inc_for_NVG.pdf |title=Preparedness of Indian Public Equities for Business Sustainability (Environmental, Social and Governance) Disclosure and Reporting |publisher=Ckinetics.com |accessdate=2014-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2012-09-14/news/33844340_1_business-responsibility-annual-reports-national-voluntary-guidelines |title=Thanks to SEBI, shareholders will have access to critical information from the next fiscal - Economic Times |publisher=Articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; which would then form a part of their annual report/filings.

==Future plans==
SEBI encourages all companies to adopt the ABRR.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="46455">'''Native American civil rights''' are the [[civil rights]] of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] in the United States.  Native Americans are citizens of their [[federally recognized tribes|clanic nations]] as well as the United States and those clanic nations are characterized under U.S.&amp;nbsp;law as "domestic dependent nations", a special relationship that creates a particular tension between rights retained via [[tribal sovereignty]] and rights that individual Natives obtained as [[U.S.&amp;nbsp;citizen]]s. This status creates tension today, but was far more extreme before Native people were uniformly granted U.S.&amp;nbsp;citizenship in 1924. Assorted laws and policies of the United States government, some tracing to the pre-Revolutionary [[European colonization of the Americas|colonial period]], denied basic [[human rights]]—particularly in the areas of cultural expression and travel—to indigenous people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanindiantah.com/history/cron_1871_1934.html|title=American Indian Civics Project: 1871 to 1924- Allotment and Assimilation|work=americanindiantah.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716021641/http://americanindiantah.com/history/cron_1871_1934.html|archivedate=2011-07-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though it is difficult to summarize the [[Classification of indigenous peoples of the Americas|many tribes and peoples]] Native to the land that is now owned by the US, there are some rights that nearly all Native Americans are still actively pursuing. These include the protection of rights to voting and the resistance of assimilation to European American practices and beliefs. Many tribes that live on reservations are currently facing the destruction of surrounding environments and water sources, depressed economies, [[violence against women]], and drug and alcohol addiction crises.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/13-native-american-issues_us_55b7d801e4b0074ba5a6869c|title=13 Issues Facing Native People Beyond Mascots And Casinos|last=NoiseCat|first=Julian Brave|date=2015-07-30|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2018-10-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pre-contact with Europeans ==
Before colonization, millions of Native people lived in what is now considered North and South America. Indigenous peoples cultures, origins, religions, and languages are vastly diverse. The [[Oral history|histories]] of the tribes who have survived the [[Genocide of indigenous peoples#Colonialism and genocide in the Americas|genocide of Native Americans]] have mostly survived through [[Oral storytelling|oral story telling]] traditions.

Religious practices among Natives, pre-colonialism range from individual prayers, rituals, and offerings to large intertribal ceremonies. [[Pre-Columbian era|Precontact]] religion was often closely tied to the land, the environment.&lt;ref name="JUtter"&gt;Utter, Jack. ''American Indians: Answers to Today's Questions''. 2nd edition. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 2001. p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; These concerns include the omnipresent, invisible universal force, and "the three 'life crises' of birth, puberty, and death," spiritual beings, revelations, human intercessors into the spirit world, and ceremonies that renew communities.&lt;ref name="JUtter" /&gt;

== 1585-1786: Initial meetings ==
In [[1585]], a tribe on the eastern coast of North America interacted with the first English person to travel to the continent, [[Richard Grenville]]. The Native people were hospitable and receptive to Grenville. Yet, when one Native stole a small silver cup from him, Grenville sacked and burned down the entire village in revenge.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The People's History of the united States|last=Zinn|first=Howard|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2003|isbn=9780061965586|location=New York City|pages=12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1607, decades after this initial interaction, the English established [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]], the first permanent English settlement on North America, in the middle of the [[Powhatan Confederacy|Powhatan confederacy]] in what is now [[Virginia]]. [[Powhatan (Native American leader)|Powhatan]], the leader, did not attack the English as they settled, though the English attacked the Powhatans upon meeting them.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

In the winter of 1609 through 1610, Jamestown residents had little food or effective shelter as they experienced the [[Starving Time]]. The Powhatan people integrated and cared for the English who left Jamestown to live with them, as they were much more prepared for the harsh winter.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In the summer, when the governor of Jamestown requested that Powhatan return the runaways, he offered vague comments that the English considered rude, but showed no intention to bring them back. In response, the English terrorized a local village, killing about 15 Powhatan, burning the houses down, cutting the corn supply, and kidnapping and murdering the queen and her children.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Powhatans had never seen this magnitude of hatred before Jamestown's establishment; as the chief roughly said in a letter to [[Captain John Smith]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;I have seen two generations of my people die...I know the difference between peace and war better than any man in my country... Why will you take by force what you may have quietly by love? Why will you destroy us who supply you with food? What can you get by war? We can hide our provisions and run into the woods; then you will starve for wronging your friends. Why are you jealous of us? We are unarmed, and willing to give you what you ask, if you come in a friendly manner, and not so simple as not to know that is it much better to eat good meat, sleep comfortably, live quietly with my wives and children, laugh and be merry with the English, and trade for their copper and hatchets, than to run away from them, and to lie cold in the wood, feed on acorns, roots and such trash, and be so hunted that I can neither eat nor sleep... Take away your guns and swords, the cause of all our jealousy, or you my all die in the same manner.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Christianization and assimiliation===
English Europeans believed that their god was the only god to exist or that people were allowed to believe in. Many of them belived that it was their sacred duty to convert Native Americans as a religious practice to save their souls. The Christian Europeans who made the journey to the Americas believed it to be their duty to Christianize the Native people.&lt;ref&gt;Sale 27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Green, Leslie C. and Plive Patricia Dickason. ''The Law of Nations and the New World.'' pg. 173&lt;/ref&gt;  They felt it was their calling by God. Spaniards practiced Christianization in the New World using [[Pope Alexander VI]]'s papal bull, ''[[Inter caetera]]''. allowed rulers to "bring under their sway [non-Christian] 'countries and islands' discovered by Columbus, along with 'their residents and inhabitants, and to bring them to the Catholic faith.'"

The missionaries developed "praying towns" to create "orderly Christian communities filled with model converts who were living and working under the watchful eye of a priest or pastor".&lt;ref&gt;Ronda, James P. and Axtell, James. Indian Missions. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1978. p.29&lt;/ref&gt; Within these communities converts to the Christian faith would be placed in a separate area from the remainder of the tribe in order to prevent regression back to their Native beliefs. Missionaries such as [[John Eliot (missionary)|John Eliot]], a puritan, and [[Isaac McCoy]], a Baptist, led the way in the spread of their beliefs within these types of towns and amongst the Natives. These towns led the way to the future separation of the Natives from the remainder of society in [[Indian reservation|Native reservations]].

== 1787-1899:Creating the Constitution ==

==1900-1945==
=== Criticizing colonialism ===
Native peoples have been active in educating nonnatives on the cultures, histories, and experiences of their tribes since the beginning of colonization. Chief [[Plenty Coups]] of the [[Crow Nation|Crow Nation in Montana]] and [[Alfred Kiyana]] of the [[Mesquakie Settlement]] in Iowa spoke to historians, [[anthropologist]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, and journalists through translators to criticize the idea of "American progress" and to express pride and faith in the identities of their own cultures.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Native North American Almanac|last=Champagne|first=Duane|publisher=Gale Group|year=2001|isbn=0787616559|location=Farmington Hills, MI|pages=597-618}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Eastman]], a Mdewakanton and Wahpeton Sioux and physician, published books and articles in [[English language|English]] for American people to show that it is not savage that Native people celebrate what [[Mourning dove|Mourning Dove]] called the "ancient way". In 1902, [[Gertrude Bonnin]] told the ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]'' that the traditions of her tribe, the [[Yankton Dakota]] Sioux, were not only equal to European Americans, but that their values were superior.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Involvement with US politics ===
In 1903, [[Charles Eastman]], a [[Santee Dakota|Santee Dakotan]] and Native representative, was requested by [[Theodore Roosevelt]] to help Sioux people choose [[English name|English names]] in order to protect their lands from being taken. Lands registered with the birth and natural names of Natives were often lost due to confusion the United States government employees had with filling paperwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h3898.html|title=Ohiyesa, or Charles A. Eastman|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=2018-10-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States government]] has a strong history making deals with Native Americans and not keeping them.Thomas Bishop, a [[Snohomish people|Snohomish]] man, recorded his elders' memories of U.S. promises and compared them to the actual texts in [[Native American treaties|treaties]]. He published a piece based on these discrepancies in 1915 titled "An Appeal to the Government to Fulfill Sacred Promises Made 61 Years Ago." Following this, he and other citizens of [[Pacific Northwest tribes]] organized all the [[Tulalip]] agency [[Indian reservation|reservations]] and several off-reservation communities into the [[Northwestern Federation of American Indians]] with the goal of redeeming promises made in treaties.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Post World War II: 1946-1959 ==
Many [[Native Americans and World War II|Native Americans]] aided the United States in [[World War II]]. Veterans came back from serving, only to find that the US government and American people would not recognize their contributions to the war effort. This encouraged Natives to begin moving towards activism that was more focused on [[Tribal sovereignty in the United States|tribal sovereignty]] and [[self-determination]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Advocacy groups, such as the [[National Congress of American Indians]] (NCAI), which was founded in 1944, began representing tribal interests to the public and to [[United States Congress|Congress]]. The NCAI's founding members came from a wide variety of professionals including veterans, anthropologists, lawyers, elected state and federal officials, and a professional baseball player, George Eastman, and half of them had previously served on [[Indian Rights Association]]-chartered tribal councils. At least four of them were also members of the [[Society of American Indians]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Civil Rights Movement: 1960-1968 ==
In 1961, the [[National Indian Youth Council]] formed in pursuit of  "a greater Indian America". The organization members were young and had grown out of a summer program that brought students from all around the US to [[Boulder, Colorado]] and introduced to the [[Southwest Regional Indian Youth Council]] so that they could learn about the Native state of affairs. The organizations' members, people such as [[Clyde Warrior]], [[Melvin Thom]], [[Vine Deloria Jr.]], and [[Hank Adams]], rejected beliefs that Natives were unable to help themselves or that they needed to adopt American society as their own. They were seen as an upset to norms in the Native community, as they were much younger than other recognized leaders of Native civil rights movements. They emphasized [[Direct action|direct protest action]] and pursued [[federal recognition]] of several then-[[Unrecognized tribe|unrecognized Native nations]]. They also organized the first conference where unrecognized Native community members, tribal chiefs, and US chairpersons shared a public stage.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Indian Civil Rights Act (1968)===
With the passage of the [[Indian Civil Rights Act]] (ICRA) in 1968, also called the Indian Bill of Rights, Native Americans were guaranteed many civil rights they had been fighting for.&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. McCarthy, Civil Rights in Tribal Courts; The Indian Bill of Rights at 30 Years, 34 IDAHO LAW REVIEW 465 (1998).&lt;/ref&gt; The ICRA supports the following:&lt;ref&gt;(Sokolow)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Right to [[free speech]], [[Freedom of press|press]], and [[Freedom of assembly|assembly]]
* Protection from unreasonable search and seizure
* Right of criminal defendant to a speedy trial, to be advised of the charges, and to confront any adverse witnesses
* Right to hire an attorney in a criminal case
* Protection against self incrimination
* Protection against [[cruel and unusual punishment]], excessive bail, incarceration of more than one year and/or a fine in excess of $5,000 for any one offense
* Protection from [[double jeopardy]] or ''[[ex post facto]]'' laws
* Right to a [[jury trial]] for offenses punishable by imprisonment
* Equal protection under the law and [[due process]]

Other civil rights such as [[sovereignty]], hunting and fishing, and voting are still issues facing Native people today.

== Contemporary movements (1969-present) ==
There has been increased dialogue around the controversy of using Native American symbols such as for school or team mascots. Concerns are that the use of the symbols distort Native American history and culture and often stereotype in offensive ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/american_indian_quarterly/v032/32.2hemmer.html|title=The American Indian Quarterly|last=Hofmann|first=Sudie|pages=156–177|volume=29, Number 1&amp;2, Winter/Spring 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After years of unequal schooling, the [[National Indian Education Association]] (NIEA) was formed to fight for equal education for Native Americans in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;http://seamonkey.ed.asu.edu/~mcisaac/emc598geold97/Spring97/5/eshel5.htm&lt;/ref&gt; 

Native American advocates went to the [[United Nations]] to seek laws that protected the rights of Native people to own their own media, and for the prosecution of those who persecuted their journalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.proquest.com|title=ProQuest - Databases, EBooks and Technology for Research|work=proquest.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religious rights ==

===Religion after Euro-American contact===
Over the last five centuries, "Christianity has made enormous inroads into Native society."&lt;ref name="JUtter2"&gt;Utter, Jack. p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; Many religious Native Americans today voluntarily practice Christianity, both Protestantism and Roman Catholicism, or a combination of Christianity and Native religion.&lt;ref name="JUtter2"/&gt; There was both voluntary and forced conversion; however, not all tribes embraced Christianity, nor did all members of tribes.

"Euro-American contact and interactions contributed much to Indian marginality and the disruption and destruction of traditional customs and even the aboriginal use of psychoactive substances. This process was noted in the 1976 Final Report to the American Indian Policy Review Commission, Task Force Eleven: Alcohol and Drug Abuse.&lt;ref&gt;French, Laurence Armand. ''Addictions &amp; Native Americans.'' Westport, CT: Greenwood Publishing Group, 2000. p 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Indian Religious Freedom Act]] was passed in 1978. It allowed freedom of religion except for some restrictions on use of ceremonial items as the eagle feathers or bones (a protected species) or [[peyote]] (considered a restricted drug by the federal government);&lt;ref&gt;Enumeration of areas of conflict from Francis Paul Prucha. ''The Great Father: The United States Government and the American Indians, Volume 2''. Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1984, p. 1127&lt;/ref&gt; however, other laws provide for ceremonial use of these by Native American religious practitioners.

One example of Christianity's influence on Native American religion is the prominence of the figure of Jesus Christ in peyote ceremonies of the [[Native American Church]],&lt;ref&gt;Woodhead, Linda. ''Religions in the Modern World: Traditions and Transformations.'' New York: Routledge, 2002. p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt; which is a [[Syncretism|syncretic]] religion.

Many indigenous religions arose in response to colonization. These include the [[Longhouse Religion]], which arose at the end of the 18th century, and the [[Ghost Dance]], [[Four Mothers Society]], [[Indian Shaker Church]], [[Kuksu religion]], and others in the 19th century.

===Suppression during the Progressive Era===
During the [[Progressive Era]] from the 1890s to the 1920s, a "quasi-theocracy" reigned in what federal policymakers called "Indian Country"; they worked hand-in-hand with churches to impose Christianity upon Native Americans "as part of the government's civilizing project".&lt;ref name="BDuthu"&gt;Duthu, N. Bruce. ''American Indians and the Law''. New York: Viking, 2008. p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Keeping in the vein of the colonialists before them, Progressive-Era policymakers found no need to separate religious endeavors concerning Native Americans from Native political policy.&lt;ref name=FHoxie&gt;Hoxie, Frederick E., ed. Talking Back to Civilization: Indian Voices from the Progressive Era. Boston: Bedford. 2001. p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; The government provided various religious groups with funds to accomplish Native American conversion. It was during this time that the government "discouraged or imposed bans on many forms of traditional religious practices, including the [[Sun Dance]], use of [[peyote]] in ceremonial settings and observance of [[potlatch]] rituals."&lt;ref name="BDuthu"/&gt; The [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] (BIA), or the "Indian Office", as it was then called, played a role in the Christianization of Native Americans. Their boarding schools, often staffed by missionaries, removed Native children from the tribe and away from the influence of their cultures.&lt;ref name="BDuthu"/&gt;

In order to pacify Christians, "some tribal religious practitioners modified elements of their traditional practices".&lt;ref name="BDuthu2"&gt;Duthu, N. Bruce. ibid. p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of the Sun Dance, "a ceremony of renewal and spiritual reaffirmation", some tribes "omit[ted] the element of self-sacrifice (many participants observed the ritual of skin piercing), reduced the number of days for the ceremony from eight to two and otherwise emphasized the ceremony's social, rather than religious, features".&lt;ref name="BDuthu2"/&gt; In the past, tribes have also moved religious days to coincide with national U.S.&amp;nbsp;holidays.

Until 1935, Native American people could be fined and sent to prison for practicing certain traditional religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/wicazo_sa_review/v021/21.2talbot.html|title=Wicazo Sa Review|last=Talbot|first=Steve|pages=7–39|volume=21, Number 2, Fall 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary Native American religious issues===
Established in 1918, the Native American Church "emphasiz[ed] the importance of monogamy, sobriety, and hard work".&lt;ref&gt;Hoxie, Frederick E. ibid. p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Today, it serves as an intertribal, multilingual network. The Native American Church has had a long struggle with the government of America due to their ancient and deeply spiritual religious practice using [[peyote]]. Peyote is a psychoactive substance that is found on a cactus and it is used for healing practices and in religious ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;Young, William A. Quest for Harmony. Seven Bridges P, LLC, 2001. p. 313&lt;/ref&gt; The use of this subject is highly debated due to the outbreaks of drug use especially the psychoactive ones among Americans today. Leaders of the Native American Church argue that the use of peyote allows for a direct connection with gods and that peyote is not taken simply for its psychoactive effects. It is taken in the manner that one might take the sacraments of Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, Catherine M. ''Ritual: Perspectives and Dimensions.'' Oxford University Press: New York, 1997. p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; "Peyote is not habit forming and 'in the controlled ambiance of a peyote meeting it is in no way harmful'" Rather it is considered a unifying influence on the Native American life because it provides the "basis for Indian friendships, rituals, social gatherings, travel, marriage, and more. It has been a source of healing and means of expression for a troubled people. And it has resulted in one of the strongest pan-Indian movements among American Indians".&lt;ref&gt;Young, William A. Quest for Harmony. Seven Bridges P, LLC, 2001. p. 302&lt;/ref&gt;

For years the government has been debating the subject of peyote use.  In 1949 peyote use was condemned by the [[American Medical Association]] because findings in their study led them to believe that it was habit-forming drug. Congress then attempted to regulate the use of peyote in 1963 with little success, but under the [[Drug Abuse Control Act]] in 1965 it was on the list of forbidden psychedelic drugs. Under this act it did not place this on Native American peyotists who were using it for religious practice, though some suffered still under the hands of the state governments for having it in their possession. State laws differed from the United States government standards with states outlawing the use of peyote.&lt;ref&gt;Young, William A. Quest for Harmony. Seven Bridges P, LLC, 2001. p. 324&lt;/ref&gt; "By 1970, of the seventeen states that still had anti-peyote laws, only five did not provide exemptions for Indians to use peyote ritually." These were amended under the pressure from the [[Native American Church]] member if the members showed proof that they were at least 25&amp;nbsp;percent Native American. The states laws were generally similar to those of [[South Dakota]], which says that "when used as a sacrament in services of the Native American Church in a natural state which is unaltered except for drying or curing or slicing", peyote use is permitted.&lt;ref&gt;La Barre, Weston. The Peyote Cult. Archon Books, 1973. p. 265&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978 the [[American Indian Religious Freedom Act]] there was mention of protection for peyote users, but this did not change the fact that they could still be charged. Because it is an "established religion of many centuries' history...not a 20th&amp;nbsp;century [[cult]] nor a fad subject to extinction at a whim",&lt;ref&gt;Botsford and EchoHawk 1996, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; it continues to be somewhat protected under the law.

==Sovereignty==
{{Main|Tribal sovereignty in the United States}}
All [[Native American tribes]] are under the U.S. government just as other minority groups. However, unlike other minority groups who are immigrants to the United States, Native Americans are indigenous to American land and have therefore sought and gained [[sovereignty]].&lt;ref name="Wildenthal, Bryan H 2003"&gt;Wildenthal, Bryan H. Native American sovereignty on trial: a handbook with cases, laws, and documents. Santa Barbara, California. ABC-CLIO, Inc., 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Native sovereignty is made complex by the fact that the British (in colonial times) and American government also co-exist in the same country.&lt;ref name="airpi2005"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.airpi.org/index.html |title=American Indian Policy Center |access-date=2008-12-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225175315/http://www.airpi.org/index.html |archive-date=2008-12-25 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Native American "government" is not government in the western sense of authority and control, but is more like leadership over a community.&lt;ref name="airpi2005"/&gt;  It is difficult to describe Native American government in a definite manner due to the fact that there are many different Native tribes with different forms of governing. As of January 2016, there are 566 [[Federally recognized tribes|federally recognized]]&amp;nbsp;Native American tribes.&lt;ref name="Wildenthal, Bryan H 2003" /&gt; During the colonial period, Native American sovereignty was upheld by the negotiation of treaties between British proprietor and Native American tribes. Treaties are agreements between two sovereign governments, and, therefore, the treaties made were made under the understanding that the tribes had equal sovereignty to the sovereignty of the colonial governments. The signing of treaties ended with the [[Indian Appropriations Act#1871|Indian Appropriations Act of 1871]], which preserved the same rights and privileges, but changed recognition to "domestinanic dependent nations" rather than independent nations.

==Fishing and hunting rights==
Although Native Americans lost the battle for their lands, the US government eventually conceded hunting and fishing rights both within the reservations and on old tribal land that had been sold to and settled. The reserved rights doctrine allowed for tribes to hunt and fish, along with any other rights, as long as they were not specifically denied in a treaty. This angered hunters and fishers who had restrictions placed on them by the government and they protested against the Natives' right to fish and hunt off of reservations. 

As the United States government pushed to colonize as much of North America as they could, they began making treaties with tribes, so that they may have reservations of land. One particular treaty with the [[Yakama]] in the Northwest guarantees that the tribe has the rights to "taking fish at all usual and accustomed places in common with the citizens of the Territory".&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Washington v. Washington State Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel Association|volume=443|page=658|pin=|year=1979}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the 1890s, Lineas and Audubon Winans operated a state-licensed fishing mill in [[Celilo Falls|Celio Falls]], an important place for fishing to not only the Yakama, but also the [[Umatilla people|Umatilla]] and the [[Nez Perce people|Nez Perce]]. The Winans decided to develop a [[fish wheel]] to catch [[salmon]] by the tons, which would deplete the river of fish for the Natives very quickly. In addition, the Winans purchased land that made it impossible for Native people to approach the river at all. The Yakama took this case to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] in ''[[United States v. Winans]]'' (1905) and won the rights to fish and to have treaties interpreted by the US government as the members of tribes would have interpreted them at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Duthu, N. Bruce (2008). ''American Indians and the Law: The Penguin Library of American Indian History'' p.101. Penguin Group (USA). {{ISBN|0-670-01857-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

State agencies pointed out that conservation efforts were possibly compromised by the Native Americans' habits; however the Supreme Court upheld the privilege with certain cases, such as ''[[Antoine v. Washington]]'' (1975), even going so far as to appropriate for Native Americans the right to hunt and fish on all of their old grounds whether or not they were currently privately owned, and to prevent private owners from erecting obstacles to exercising this right. The largest amount of opposition and resentment towards Native Americans' fishing and hunting rights stems from the Pacific Northwest.&lt;ref&gt;Law Encyclopedia. West's Encyclopedia of American Law. Copyright © 1998 by The Gale Group, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1988, the United States government passed a federal [[Indian Gaming Regulatory Act]], which provides the legislative basis for protecting Native lands for their community health and economic growth.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Traveling rights==
During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the U.S.&amp;nbsp;government attempted to control the travel of Native Americans off Native reservations.  Since Native Americans did not obtain U.S. citizenship until 1924, they were considered wards of the state and were denied various basic rights, including the right to travel.&lt;ref&gt;''Heartbeat of the People:  Music and Dance of the Northern Pow-Wow'', Browner&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Bureau of Indian Affairs]] (BIA) discouraged off-reservation activities, including the right to hunt, fish, or visit other tribes. As a result, the BIA instituted a "pass system" designed to control movement of the Natives.  This system required Natives living on reservations to obtain a pass from a Native agent before they could leave the reservation.&lt;ref&gt;In a Barren Land:  American Indian Dispossession and Survival, Marks&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition, agents were often ordered to limit the number of passes they issued for off-reservation travel. The reasons cited for this limitation were that Natives with passes often overstayed the time limits imposed, and many times Natives left without requesting passes.  When this occurred, the military was frequently called to force the Natives to return their reservations. For example, in April 1863, Superintendent J.&amp;nbsp;W.&amp;nbsp;Perit Huntington forced 500&amp;nbsp;Native Americans to return from the [[Willamette Valley]] who had violated the pass system, and estimated that up to 300&amp;nbsp;Natives were still in the area without US authorization.&lt;ref&gt;''Indians of the Pacific Northwest'', Elizabeth von Aderkas&lt;/ref&gt;

While attempting to implement this pass system, the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) received numerous complaints regarding Natives who traveled without permission. Many complained that Native Americans were killing game merely for the sport and were taking the hides. Other settlers complained that Natives overstayed their visits at neighboring reservations while neglecting their farming duties at home. For example, in December, 1893, Governor [[John E. Osborne]] of [[Wyoming]] wrote a letter to the BIA protesting that Natives from [[Fort Hall Indian Reservation|Fort Hall]], [[Lemhi Shoshone|Lemhi]], [[Wind River Indian Reservation|Wind River]], and [[Crow Indian Reservation|Crow Reservations]] were leaving illegally. In response, the commissioner sent a note to all Native agents stating that Natives who disobeyed the pass system would be arrested and punished by state officials.&lt;ref&gt;''The Northern Shoshoni'', Madsen, 134&lt;/ref&gt; Additional rules were also implemented at this time.  For example, the Native agents were now required to notify other reservations of the departure time of Natives, names of Natives, and the route they intended to follow.&lt;ref&gt;Harvard University, U.S. Office of Indian Affairs, 67&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to these concerns, many settlers were unhappy with the travel of Native Americans on the railroads. For example, the [[Central Pacific Railroad]] in [[Nevada]] had granted Natives the privilege of riding on the roof and flatbeds of rail cars without tickets, in exchange for the right-of-way through their reservations.&lt;ref&gt;As Long as the River Shall Run, Knack, 103,&lt;/ref&gt; Other railroad lines, including the Carson and the Colorado allowed free railroad travel to the Natives. [[Paiute]]{{disambiguation needed|date=April 2018}} Natives, for example, frequently rode the trains to their traditional hunting and fishing grounds. "Paiutes would pack up their gathering baskets and hop on the rails, take off a day or two to gather seeds, and bring their harvest back home again, on the car roofs. Men and women used free passes to travel into town or to ranches farther in the hinterlands for jobs."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''As Long as the River Shall Run'', Knack, 103&lt;/ref&gt; Angry Native agents, who wanted the Paiutes to stay under their jurisdiction, wrote letters urging the BIA to stop this free travel. According to one Native agent, "The injurious effects of this freedom from restraint, and continual change of place, on the Indian, can not be overestimated."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

The loss of the right to free movement across the country was difficult for Native Americans, especially since many tribes traditionally traveled to hunt, fish, and visit other tribes.  The passage of the [[Indian Citizenship Act]] in 1924 granted citizenship to all Natives born in America.  As a result, Native Americans were finally granted free travel in the United States. At the present time, Native Americans who live on reservations are free to travel as they wish.

== Voting ==
In the 18th century, starting when the Constitution was created, There was a struggle to define what the Native tribes relationship was with the United States. Article;1, Section;2 of the Constitution states that Natives are not under any control of the United States, and therefore cannot be taxed. (Daniel, Susan M. Olson, and Jennifer L. Robinson. Native Vote).&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, 2007. pg. 1&lt;/ref&gt; The Constitution also stated that Congress has the power to "regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among several states, and with Indian tribes" as stated in Article;I, Section;8. 

The [[Marshall Trilogy]] in 1831 helped define sovereignty by stating that the Cherokee nation was a distinct political society but a domestic dependent nation and one that "resembles that of a ward to a guardian".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Cherokee Nation v. Georgia]]'' (1831)&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Native Americans' relationship to the U.S.&amp;nbsp;government was similar to that of people in an occupied land under the control of a foreign power.&lt;ref name="McCool 2"&gt;McCool 2&lt;/ref&gt; This definition meant that Native people did not have a right to vote. Further clarification was made when in 1856 Attorney General [[Caleb Cushing]] stated, "Indians are the subjects of the United States, and therefore are not, in mere right of home-birth, citizens of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Official Opinions of the Attorneys General 1856, 749–50&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McCool 2" /&gt;

In 1817 the Cherokee became the first Native Americans recognized as U.S.&amp;nbsp;citizens. Under Article&amp;nbsp;8 of the 1817 Cherokee treaty, "Upwards of 300&amp;nbsp;Cherokees (Heads of Families) in the honest simplicity of their souls, made and election to become American citizens."&lt;ref name="McLoughlin"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth&amp;nbsp;Amendment]] and the first civil rights act were passed in 1866 regarding the role of African-Americans in the United States, citizenship of Natives was defined as well. The Civil Rights Act of 1866 states, "That all persons born in the United States, and not subject to any foreign power, excluding Indians not taxed, are hereby declared to be citizens of the United States".&lt;ref name="McCool 3"&gt;McCool 3&lt;/ref&gt; The country at this time was not necessarily ready for Natives to become citizens. Senator [[Jacob Howard]] of Michigan commented, "I am not yet prepared to pass a sweeping act of naturalization by which all the Indian savages, wild or tame, belonging to a tribal relation, are to become my fellow-citizens and go to the polls and vote with me…".&lt;ref name="CG 1866, 2895"&gt;Congressional Globe 1866, 2895&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McCool 3" /&gt; This sentiment is also shown through a Senate floor debate regarding the Fourteenth Amendment where [[James Rood Doolittle]] of Wisconsin stated, "…all those wild Natives to be citizens of the United States, the Great Republic of the world, whose citizenship should be a title as proud as that of king, and whose danger is that you may degrade that citizenship."&lt;ref name="CG 1866, 2892"&gt;Congressional Globe 1866, 2892&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McCool 3" /&gt; One of his other concerns was that because of the substantial number of Natives at the time, their numbers would be able to overwhelm the power of the white vote.&lt;ref name="McCool 3" /&gt; As Doolittle argued, "there is a large mass of the Indian population who are clearly subject to the jurisdiction of the United States who ought not to be included as citizens of the United States…the word "citizen," if applied to them, would bring in all the Digger Indians of California".&lt;ref name="CG 1866, 2892" /&gt;

While not all Natives were granted citizenship at that time under a blanket law, there were some special considerations made to grant individual Natives citizenship. This in turn gave them the right of suffrage. For example, a treaty involving the United States and the [[Lakota people]] demonstrates this. In 1868 Article&amp;nbsp;6 of the [[Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868)|Treaty of Fort Laramie]] stated that Natives could gain citizenship by "receiving a patent for land under the foregoing provisions… and be entitled to all the privileges and immunities of such citizens, and shall, at the same time retain all [their] rights to benefits accruing to Indians under this treaty".&lt;ref name="McCool 5"&gt;McCool 5&lt;/ref&gt; The advantage of this was that the Natives could become citizens yet still maintain their status and rights as Natives.&lt;ref name="McCool 5" /&gt;

Even for signatory Native Nations to the Fort Laramie Treaty, however, it was made clear though that just because a few Natives were citizens, it did not mean that they all in turn had the right to vote. In 1884, when John Elk, a Native who lived in [[Omaha, Nebraska]], attempted to register in local elections, he was refused a ballot. When he took the case to Supreme Court and through the ''[[Elk v. Wilkins]]'' trial, he was ruled against under the circumstances that Natives did not fall under the Fourteenth Amendment.&lt;ref name="McCool 6"&gt;McCool 6&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Dawes Act]] in 1887 continued to pave the pathway for Native citizenship in that members of certain Native American tribes who accepted an allotment of land was considered a citizen.&lt;ref name="McCool 6" /&gt; The goal was for Natives to, through assimilation, "adopt the habits of civilized life".&lt;ref&gt;Keyssar, Alexander. The Right to Vote. New York: Basic Books, 2000. pg. 165&lt;/ref&gt; This movement certainly convinced a lot of Natives to gain citizenship. This is seen through President [[Theodore Roosevelt]]'s statement on the allotment policy in which he reported that by 1901, 60,000&amp;nbsp;Natives had already become citizens of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Roosevelt 1901, 6672&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McCool 6" /&gt;

Piece by piece, more acts were created that added Natives to the citizenship rolls.&lt;ref name="McCool 6"/&gt; When the Native Territory (what is now Oklahoma) was abolished in 1907, all Natives who lived in that territory were made citizens through the [[Oklahoma Enabling Act]].&lt;ref name="McCool 6" /&gt;

Furthermore, after [[World War&amp;nbsp;I]], any Native who had fought with [[honorable discharge]] was also considered a citizen through the Act of November 6, 1919.&lt;ref name="McCool 7"&gt;McCool 7&lt;/ref&gt; As Native Vote states, "The underlying assumption of this act was that these particular Indians had demonstrated that they had become part of the larger Anglo culture and were no longer wholly Indian".&lt;ref name="McCool 7" /&gt;

By the early 1920s, Congress was considering a bill to make the remainder of Native Americans citizens in their aim to have them "adopt Anglo culture".&lt;ref name="McCool 7"/&gt; This finally was stated with the [[Indian Citizenship Act]] which was created on June 2, 1924. This act showed progress in that Natives would not have to give up being a Native to be a citizen of the United States. This included being an enrolled member of a tribe, living on a federally recognized reservation, or practicing his or her culture.&lt;ref name="McCool 7" /&gt; However, this did not create the right to vote automatically.

There remained instances in many states that still prevented Natives from voting, even though they were citizens of the United States. For example, the attorney general of [[Colorado]] in 1936 declared that Natives could not vote because they were not citizens of the state.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen 1942, 158&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McCool 9&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, states found ways around voting in other ways. Because the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]] 1870 barred states from limiting voting on account of race, states found other ways – residency: claiming that Native Americans were not residents of the state if they resided on reservations, self-termination: one must first abandon their tribal ties in order to vote, taxation: Natives who do not need to pay taxes cannot vote, guardianship: the claim that Native Americans were incompetent and "wards of the state", and on the lack of ability to read English.&lt;ref name="McCool 19"&gt;McCool 19&lt;/ref&gt;

With [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]] and the need for more soldiers through the draft, Congress reaffirmed Native people's citizenship with the Nationality Act of 1940.&lt;ref name="ITCA 2"&gt;ITCA 2&lt;/ref&gt; However, when some 25,000 veterans returned home after the war, they realized that even though they had put their lives on the line for their country, they were still not allowed to vote.&lt;ref name="ITCA 2" /&gt;

In 1965 the [[Voting Rights Act]] (VRA) put an end to individual states' claims on whether or not Natives were allowed to vote through a federal law. Section&amp;nbsp;2 of the VRA states that, "No voting qualification or prerequisite to voting, or standard, practice, or procedure, shall be imposed or applied by any State or political subdivision to deny or abridge the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color".&lt;ref&gt;McCool 22&lt;/ref&gt; Further sections describe the measures taken if violations to this act are discovered.

However, efforts by states and municipalities to disenfranchise Native Americans are ongoing, such that there have been about 74&amp;nbsp;cases brought by or on behalf of Natives under the VRA or the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth]] or Fifteenth Amendment since 1965.&lt;ref&gt;McCool 45&lt;/ref&gt; These in the most part have proved to be successful to upholding the rights of Native Americans as citizens of the United States. Most of these cases are centered on states that have large reservations, or Native populations, such as New Mexico, Arizona and Oklahoma.

== Land rights ==
{{main|Aboriginal title in the United States}}
One of the major issues surrounding land ownership rights of the Native American Nations is for what they are and are not allowed to use their land.

A typical example of the struggle faced involved the [[Seneca Nation]] of [[New York State]]. On April 18, 2007, the Seneca Nation laid claim to a stretch of [[Interstate&amp;nbsp;90]] that crosses the [[Cattaraugus Reservation]] by revoking the 1954 agreement that granted the [[Interstate Highway System]] and [[New York State Thruway Authority]] permission to build the highway through the territory. The move was a direct shot at New York Governor [[Eliot Spitzer]]'s attempts to collect taxes on Seneca territory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buffalonews.com/101/story/57227.html Buffalo News story]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Senecas had previously made the same claim in a lawsuit which they lost because of the state's assertion of sovereign immunity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.upstate-citizens.org/Seneca-v-NYS-tway.pdf |title=United States Court of Appeals - Seneca Nation v. State of New York |access-date=2008-09-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808172704/http://www.upstate-citizens.org/Seneca-v-NYS-tway.pdf |archive-date=2007-08-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Magistrate Heckman's Report and Recommendation it was noted that the State of New York asserted its immunity from suit against both counts of the complaint (one count was the challenge regarding the state's acquisition of [[Grand Island, New York|Grand Island]] and other smaller islands in the [[Niagara River]] and another count challenging the thruway easement).  The United States was permitted to intervene on behalf of the Seneca Nation and the [[Tonawanda Band of Seneca Indians]]. The United States was then directed to file an amended complaint that "clearly states the relief sought by the United States in this action". In this amended complaint the United States did not seek any relief on behalf of the Seneca Nation relative to the thruway easement. By not seeking such relief in its amended complaint the United States of America permitted the action relative to the thruway easement to be subject to dismissal based on New York's immunity from suit under the [[Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eleventh Amendment]] to the United States Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.upstate-citizens.org/Tway-RR-and-Dist-Ct-decisions.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  On May 4, the Seneca Nation threatened to do the same with [[Interstate 86 (east)|Interstate&amp;nbsp;86]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salamancapress.com/site/tab1.cfm?newsid=18301123&amp;BRD=2725&amp;PAG=461&amp;dept_id=562848&amp;rfi=6 Salamanca Press article]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"There is no doubt that had he succeeded in his attempt to enter Syria he would have joined IS and that he would have fought for them. He eventually admitted that this had been his plan and he admitted that he wanted to fight in what he believes is a holy war against the western oppressors. He is described by his mother as "meek, mild and easily influenced", but following his conversion he grew increasingly distant from his immediate family.

In [[lexical semantics]], '''opposites''' are words lying in an inherently incompatible binary relationship, like the opposite pairs ''big : small'', ''long : short'', and ''precede : follow''. The notion of incompatibility here refers to the fact that one word in an opposite pair [[Logical consequence|entails]] that it is not the other pair member. For example, something that is ''long'' entails that it is not ''short''. It is referred to as a 'binary' relationship because there are two members in a set of opposites. The relationship between opposites is known as '''opposition'''. A member of a pair of opposites can generally be determined by the question ''What is the opposite of &lt;u&gt;&amp;nbsp;X&amp;nbsp;&lt;/u&gt;?''

The term '''antonym''' (and the related antonymy) is commonly taken to be synonymous with opposite, but antonym also has other more restricted meanings. Graded (or gradable) antonyms are word pairs whose meanings are opposite and which lie on a continuous spectrum (hot, cold). Complementary antonyms are word pairs whose meanings are opposite but whose meanings do not lie on a continuous spectrum (''push'', ''pull''). [[Relational antonym]]s are word pairs where opposite makes sense only in the context of the relationship between the two meanings (''teacher'', ''pupil''). These more restricted meanings may not apply in all scholarly contexts, with Lyons (1968, 1977) defining antonym to mean gradable antonyms, and Crystal (2003) warns that antonymy and antonym should be regarded with care.

==General discussion==
Opposites are simultaneously different and similar in meaning. Typically, they differ in only one dimension of meaning, but are similar in most other respects, including similarity in grammar and positions of semantic abnormality. Additionally, not all words have an opposite. Some words are non-opposable. For example, animal or plant species have no binary opposites (other than possible sex opposites such as lion/lioness, etc.); the word [[platypus]] therefore has no word that stands in opposition to it (hence the unanswerability of ''What is the opposite of &lt;u&gt;platypus&lt;/u&gt;?'').

Other words are opposable but have an [[accidental gap]] in a given language's [[lexicon]]. For example, the word ''devout'' lacks a lexical opposite, but it is fairly easy to conceptualize a parameter of devoutness where ''devout'' lies at the positive pole with a missing member at the negative pole. Opposites of such words can nevertheless sometimes be formed with the prefixes ''un-'' or ''non-'', with varying degrees of naturalness. For example, the word ''undevout'' appears in Webster's dictionary of 1828, while the pattern of ''non-person'' could conceivably be extended to ''non-platypus''. Conversely, some words appear to be a prefixed form of an opposite, but the opposite term does not exist, such as ''inept,''  which appears to be ''in-'' + *''ept;'' such a word is known as an [[unpaired word|unpaired]] word￼￼. 

Opposites may be viewed as a special type of incompatibility.&lt;ref&gt;Incompatibility can be compared to [[exclusive disjunction]] in logic.&lt;/ref&gt; Words that are incompatible create the following type of [[entailment]] (where ''X'' is a given word and ''Y'' is a different word incompatible with word X):&lt;ref&gt;There are four types of entailment useful to lexical semantics:
* '''unilateral entailment''': ''It's a fish'' unilaterally entails ''It's an animal''. (It is unilateral, i.e. one-directional, because ''It's an animal'' does not entail ''It's a fish'' since ''it'' could be a dog or a cat or some other animal.)
* '''[[logical equivalence]]''' (or multilateral entailment): ''The party commenced at midnight'' entails ''The party began at midnight'' AND ''The party began at midnight'' also entails ''The party commenced at midnight''.
* '''contrariety''': The sentences 'X is blue all over' and 'X is red all over' are contraries since both cannot be simultaneously true. On the Aristotelian square of opposition, the A and E type propositions ('All As are Bs' and 'No As are Bs', respectively) are contraries of each other. Propositions that cannot be simultaneously false (e.g. 'Something is red' and 'Something is not red') are said to be '''subcontraries'''.
* '''contradiction''': ''It's dead'' entails ''It's not alive'' AND ''It's not alive'' entails ''It's dead'' AND ''It's alive'' entails ''It's not dead'' AND ''It's not dead'' entails ''It's alive''. ''It's dead'' and ''It's alive'' are said to be in a contradictory relation.&lt;/ref&gt;

: sentence ''A is &lt;u&gt;&amp;nbsp;X&amp;nbsp;&lt;/u&gt;'' &amp;nbsp;entails&amp;nbsp; sentence ''A is not &lt;u&gt;&amp;nbsp;Y&amp;nbsp;&lt;/u&gt;'' &lt;ref&gt;Stated differently, if the proposition expressed by the sentence ''A is &lt;u&gt;&amp;nbsp;X&amp;nbsp;&lt;/u&gt;'' is TRUE, then the proposition expressed by the sentence ''A is not &lt;u&gt;&amp;nbsp;Y&amp;nbsp;&lt;/u&gt;'' is also TRUE.&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of an incompatible pair of words is ''cat : dog'':

: ''It's &lt;u&gt;a cat&lt;/u&gt;'' &amp;nbsp;entails&amp;nbsp; ''It's not &lt;u&gt;a dog&lt;/u&gt;'' &lt;ref&gt;It is assumed here that ''it'' has the same [[referent]].&lt;/ref&gt;

This incompatibility is also found in the opposite pairs ''fast : slow'' and ''stationary : moving'', as can be seen below:

: ''It's &lt;u&gt;fast&lt;/u&gt;'' &amp;nbsp;entails&amp;nbsp; ''It's not &lt;u&gt;slow&lt;/u&gt;'' &lt;ref&gt;It is also assumed here the reference point of comparison for these adjectives remains the same in both sentences. For example, a rabbit might be fast compared to turtle but slow compared to a sport car. It is essential when determining the relationships between the lexical meaning of words to keep the situational context identical.&lt;/ref&gt;
: ''It's &lt;u&gt;stationary&lt;/u&gt;'' &amp;nbsp;entails&amp;nbsp; ''It's not &lt;u&gt;moving&lt;/u&gt;''

Cruse (2004) identifies some basic characteristics of opposites:

* binarity
* inherentness
* patency
'''

== Antonyms ==
An antonym is one of a pair of words with opposite meanings. Each word in the pair is the antithesis of the other. A word may have more than one antonym. There are three categories of antonyms identified by the nature of the relationship between the opposed meanings. Where the two words have definitions that lie on a continuous spectrum of meaning, they are gradable antonyms. Where the meanings do not lie on a continuous spectrum and the words have no other lexical relationship, they are complementary antonyms. Where the two meanings are opposite only within the context of their relationship, they are relational antonyms.

=== Gradable antonyms ===
A gradable antonym is one of a pair of words with opposite meanings where the two meanings lie on a continuous spectrum. Temperature is such a continuous spectrum so ''hot'' and ''cold'', two meanings on opposite ends of the spectrum, are gradable antonyms. Other examples include: ''heavy'' : ''light'', ''fat'' : ''skinny'', ''dark'' : ''light'', ''young'' : ''old'', ''early'' : ''late'', ''empty'' : ''full'', ''dull'' : ''interesting''.

=== Complementary antonyms ===
A complementary antonym, sometimes called a binary or contradictory antonym (Aarts, Chalker &amp; Weiner 2014), is one of a pair of words with opposite meanings, where the two meanings do not lie on a continuous spectrum. There is no continuous spectrum between ''odd'' and ''even'' but they are opposite in meaning and are therefore complementary antonyms. Other examples include: ''mortal'' : ''immortal'', ''exit'' : ''entrance'', ''exhale'' : ''inhale'', ''occupied'' : ''vacant''.

=== Relational antonyms ===
A [[Converse (semantics)|relational antonym]] is one of a pair of words with opposite meanings, where opposite makes sense only in the context of the relationship between the two meanings. There is no lexical opposite of ''teacher'', but ''teacher'' and ''pupil'' are opposite within the context of their relationship. This makes them relational antonyms. Other examples include: ''husband'' : ''wife'', ''doctor'' : ''patient'', ''predator'' : ''prey'', ''teach'' : ''learn'', ''servant'' : ''master'', ''come'' : ''go'', ''parent'' : ''child''.

== Opposite ==
Some [[planned language]]s abundantly use such devices to reduce vocabulary multiplication.
[[Esperanto vocabulary#Affixes|Esperanto]] has ''mal-'' (compare ''bona'' = "good" and ''malbona'' = "bad"), [[Damin]] has ''kuri-'' (''tjitjuu'' "small", ''kuritjitjuu'' "large") and [[Newspeak]] has ''un-'' (as in ''ungood'', "bad").

===Directional opposites===
* ''antipodals''
* ''pseudo-opposites''
* ''reversives''
* [[Converse (semantics)|''converses'']] (or ''relational opposites'' or ''relational antonyms''), pairs in which one describes a relationship between two objects and the other describes the same relationship when the two objects are reversed, such as ''parent'' and ''child'', ''teacher'' and ''student'', or ''buy'' and ''sell''.

==Auto-antonyms==
An [[auto-antonym]] is a word that can have opposite meanings in different contexts or under separate definitions:
* [[enjoin]] (to prohibit, issue [[injunction]]; to [[General order|order]], [[wikt:command|command]])
* [[wiktionary : fast#Adjective|fast]] (moving quickly; fixed [[wiktionary : firmly|firmly]] in place)
* [[wiktionary : cleave|cleave]] (to [[wiktionary : split|split]]; to [[wiktionary : adhere|adhere]])
* [[wiktionary : sanction|sanction]] ([[punishment]], prohibition; permission)
* [[wiktionary:stay|stay]] ([[wiktionary : remain|remain]] in a specific place, postpone; [[wiktionary : guide|guide]] direction, movement)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2596">'''Perceptual psychology''' is a subfield of [[cognitive psychology]]{{cn|date=February 2018}} that is concerned specifically with the pre-conscious innate aspects of the human cognitive system: [[perception]]. 

A pioneer of this field was [[James J. Gibson]]. A major study was that of [[affordance]]s, i.e. the perceived utility of objects in, or features of, one's surroundings. According to Gibson, such features or objects were perceived as affordances and not as separate or distinct objects in themselves. This view was central to several other fields as software [[user interface]] and [[usability engineering]], [[environmentalism]] in psychology, and ultimately to [[political economy]] where the perceptual view was used to explain the omission of key inputs or consequences of economic transactions, i.e. resources and wastes.

[[Gerard Egan]] and Robert Bolton explored areas of interpersonal interactions based on the premise that people act in accordance with their perception of a given situation. While behaviour is obvious, a person's thoughts and feelings are masked. This gives rise to the idea that the most common problems between people are based on the assumption that we can guess what the other person is feeling and thinking. They also offered methods, within this scope, for effective communications. This includes: [[reflective listening]], assertion skills, [[conflict resolution]] etc. Perceptual psychology is often used in therapy to help a patient better their problem-solving skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wells-Moran|first=Jolyn|title=Cognitive Psychology|url=http://psychologydegree.lifetips.com/tip/130454/cognitive-psychology/cognitive-psychology/cognitive-psychology.html|publisher=lifetips|accessdate=2011-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nativism vs. empiricism ==
Nativist and empiricist approaches to perceptual psychology have been researched and debated to find out which is the basis in the development of perception. Nativists believe humans are born with all the perceptual abilities needed. This is the favored of the theories on perception. Empiricists hold that humans are not born with perceptual abilities, but instead must learn them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Perceptual Psychology: Nativism Vs.

The '''problem of other minds''' is a philosophical problem traditionally stated as the following [[Epistemology|epistemological]] challenge raised by the [[Skepticism|skeptic]]: given that I can only observe the [[behavior]] of others, how can I know that others have [[mind]]s?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/other-minds/|first=Alec|last=Hyslop|title=Other Minds|editor1-last=Zalta|editor1-first=Edward N.|editor2-last=Nodelman|editor2-first=Uri|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Center for the Study of Language and Information, Stanford University|issn=1095-5054|date=14 January 2014|accessdate=May 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a central tenet of the philosophical idea known as [[solipsism]]; the notion that for any person only one's own mind is known to exist. Solipsism maintains that no matter how sophisticated someone's behavior is, behavior on its own does not guarantee the presence of mentality.

Most [[economic model]]s rest on a number of assumptions that are not entirely realistic.  For example, agents are often assumed to have perfect information, and markets are often assumed to clear without friction.  Or, the model may omit issues that are important to the question being considered, such as [[externalities]]. Any analysis of the results of an economic model must therefore consider the extent to which these results may be compromised by inaccuracies in these assumptions, and there is a growing literature debunking economics and economic models.

== Restrictive, unrealistic assumptions ==

Provably unrealistic assumptions are pervasive in neoclassical economic theory (also called the "standard theory" or "neoclassical paradigm"), and those assumptions are inherited by simplified models for that theory. (Any model based on a flawed theory, cannot transcend the limitations of that theory.) [[Joseph Stiglitz]]' 2001 Nobel Prize lecture reviews his work on [[Information asymmetry|information asymmetries]],&lt;ref name="stiglitz"&gt;Joseph E. Stiglitz. 2001 Nobel Prize lecture: {{cite web|title=Information and the change in the paradigm of economics| 
url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/2001/stiglitz-lecture.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; which contrasts with the assumption, in standard models, of "perfect information".  Stiglitz surveys many aspects of these faulty standard models, and the faulty policy implications
and recommendations that arise from their unrealistic assumptions.

Economic models can be such powerful tools in understanding some economic relationships that it is easy to ignore their limitations. One tangible example where the limits of economic models allegedly collided with reality, but were nevertheless accepted as "evidence" in public policy debates, involved models to simulate the effects of NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement.  James Stanford published his examination of 10 of these models.&lt;ref&gt;James Stanford.  "Continental Economic Integration: Modeling the Impact on Labor," Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, Mar 1993, V526 pp. 92–110&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James Stanford. 1993. {{cite web|title=Free Trade and the Imaginary Worlds of Economic Modelers |url=http://www.pcdf.org/1993/45stanfo.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fundamental issue is circularity:  embedding one's assumptions as foundational "input" axioms in a model, then proceeding to "prove" that, indeed, the model's "output" supports the validity of those assumptions. Such a model is consistent with similar models that have adopted those same assumptions. But is it consistent with reality? As with any scientific theory, empirical validation is needed, if we are to have any confidence in its predictive ability.

If those assumptions are, in fact, fundamental aspects of empirical reality, then the model's output will correctly describe reality (if it is properly "tuned", and if it is not missing any crucial assumptions).  But if those assumptions are not valid for the particular aspect of reality one attempts to simulate, then it becomes a case of "GIGO" – Garbage In, Garbage Out".

James Stanford outlines this issue for the specific [[Computable general equilibrium|Computable General Equilibrium]] ("CGE") models that were introduced as evidence into the public policy debate,  by advocates for NAFTA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Robert |last=Aponte |title=NAFTA and Mexican Migration to Michigan and the U.S. |url=http://www.jsri.msu.edu/upload/working-papers/wp25.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rick Crawford. 1996. {{Citation|title=Computer-assisted Crises|

&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the prominence of Stiglitz' 2001 Nobel prize lecture, the use of arguably misleading neoclassical models persisted in 2007, according to these authors:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Projected Benefits of the Doha Round Hinge on Misleading Trade Models |url=http://www.newschool.edu/cepa/publications/policynotes/Doha%20Policy%20Note%20Final%2003_12_07.pdf }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The working paper,
"Debunking the Myths of Computable General Equilibrium Models",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Debunking the Myths of Computable General Equilibrium Models |url=http://www.newschool.edu/cepa/publications/workingpapers/SCEPA%20Working%20Paper%202008-1%20Kahn.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325161535/http://www.newschool.edu/cepa/publications/workingpapers/SCEPA%20Working%20Paper%202008-1%20Kahn.pdf |archivedate=March 25, 2009 }}
SCEPA Working Paper 01-2008.
&lt;/ref&gt;
provides both a history, and a readable theoretical analysis
of what CGE models are, and are not.  In particular, despite their name,
CGE models use neither the Walrass general equilibrium,
nor the Arrow-Debreus General Equilibrium frameworks.
Thus, CGE models are highly distorted simplifications of theoretical frameworks—collectively called "the neoclassical economic paradigm"—which—themselves—were largely discredited by Joseph Stiglitz.

In the "Concluding Remarks" (p.&amp;nbsp;524) of his 2001 Nobel Prize lecture, Stiglitz examined why the neoclassical paradigm—and models based on it—persists, despite his publication, over a decade earlier, of some of his seminal results showing that Information Asymmetries invalidated core Assumptions of that paradigm
and its models:

In the aftermath of the 2007–2009 global economic meltdown, the profession's alleged attachment to unrealistic models is increasingly being questioned and criticized.  After a weeklong workshop, one group of economists released a paper highly critical of their own profession's allegedly unethical use of unrealistic models. Their ''Abstract'' offers an indictment of fundamental practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Colander | first1 = D. | last2 = Goldberg | first2 = M. | last3 = Haas | first3 = A. | last4 = Juselius | first4 = K. | last5 = Kirman | first5 = A. | last6 = Lux | first6 = T. | last7 = Sloth | first7 = B. | doi = 10.1080/08913810902934109 | title = The Financial Crisis and the Systemic Failure of the Economics Profession | journal = Critical Review | volume = 21 | issue = 2–3 | page = 249 | year = 2009 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Omitted details ==

{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2017}}
A great danger inherent in the simplification required to fit the entire economy into a model is omitting critical elements. Some economists believe that making the model as simple as possible is an [[art|art form]], but the details left out are often contentious. For instance:
* Market models often exclude [[externality|externalities]] such as [[pollution]]. Such models are the basis for many [[environmentalist]] attacks on mainstream [[economist]]s. It is said that if the social costs of externalities were included in the models their conclusions would be very different, and models are often accused of leaving out these terms because of economist's pro-[[free market]] bias.
* In turn, [[environmental economics]] has been accused of omitting key financial considerations from its models. For example, the returns to [[solar power]] investments are sometimes modelled without a [[discount factor]], so that the present [[utility]] of solar energy delivered in a century's time is precisely equal to gas-power station energy today.
*  [[Financial modeling|Financial models]] can be oversimplified by relying on historically unprecedented [[arbitrage]]-free markets, probably underestimating the [[kurtosis|chance of crises]], and under-pricing or under-planning for [[risk]].
*It  is possible that any missing variable as well as errors in values of included variables can lead to erroneous results.
* [[Model risk]]: There is a significant amount of model risk inherent in the current mathematical modeling approaches to economics that one must take into account when using them. A good economic theory should be built on sound economic principles tested on many free markets, and proven to be valid. However, empirical facts have been alleged to indicate that the principles of economics hold only under very limited conditions that are rarely met in real life, and there is no scientific testing methodology available to validate hypotheses. Decisions based on economic theories that are not scientifically possible to test can give people a false sense of precision, and that could be misleading, leading to build up logical errors.
*[[Natural economics]]:  Economics is concerned with  both  'normal' and  'abnormal' economic conditions. In an objective scientific study one is not restricted by the normality assumption in describing actual economies, as much empirical evidence shows that some "anomalous" behavior can persist for a long time in real markets e.g., in market "bubbles" and market "herding".

'''René Descartes''' ({{IPAc-en|d|eɪ|ˈ|k|ɑːr|t}}, {{small|UK also}} {{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|eɪ|k|ɑːr|t}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/descartes "Descartes"] entry in ''[[Collins English Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-fr|ʁəne dekaʁt|lang}}; [[Latinisation (literature)|Latinized]]: '''Renatus Cartesius'''; [[Adjective|adjectival form]]: "Cartesian";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Colie |first=Rosalie L. |title=Light and Enlightenment |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1957 |page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; 31 March 1596 – 11 February 1650) was a French [[philosopher]], [[Mathematics|mathematician]], and [[scientist]]. A native of the Kingdom of France, he spent about 20 years (1629–49) of his life in the [[Dutch Republic]] after serving for a while in the [[Dutch States Army]] of [[Maurice, Prince of Orange|Maurice of Nassau]], [[Prince of Orange]] and the [[Stadtholder]] of the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]]. He is generally considered one of the most notable intellectual figures of the [[Dutch Golden Age]].&lt;ref&gt;Nadler, Steven: ''The Philosopher, the Priest, and the Painter: A Portrait of Descartes''. (Princeton University Press, 2015, {{ISBN|9780691165752}})&lt;/ref&gt; 

Descartes' ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]'' (1641) continues to be a standard text at most university philosophy departments. Descartes' influence in mathematics is equally apparent; the [[Cartesian coordinate system]] (see [[#Mathematical legacy|below]]) was named after him. He is credited as the father of [[Analytic geometry|analytical geometry]], the bridge between algebra and geometry, used in the discovery of infinitesimal [[calculus]] and [[Mathematical analysis|analysis]]. Descartes was also one of the key figures in the [[Scientific Revolution]].

Descartes refused to accept the authority of previous philosophers. He frequently set his views apart from those of his predecessors. In the opening section of the ''[[Passions of the Soul]]'', an [[Early modern period|early modern]] treatise on emotions, Descartes goes so far as to assert that he will write on this topic "as if no one had written on these matters before". His best known philosophical statement is "[[Cogito, ergo sum|I think, therefore I am]]" ({{lang-fr|link=no|Je pense, donc je suis}}; {{lang-la|link=no|Ego cogito, ergo sum}}), found in ''[[Discourse on the Method]]'' (1637; written in French and Latin) and ''[[Principles of Philosophy]]'' (1644; written in Latin).&lt;ref&gt;This idea had already been proposed by the Spanish philosopher [[Gómez Pereira]] a hundred years ago in the form: "I know that I know something, anyone who knows exists, then I exist" (''nosco me aliquid noscere, &amp; quidquid noscit, est, ergo ego sum''). See: Gómez Pereira, ''Antoniana Margarita'': "De Immortalitate Animae", 1749 [1554], p. 277; Santos López, Modesto (1986). "Gómez Pereira, médico y filósofo medinense". In: ''Historia de Medina del Campo y su Tierra, volumen I: Nacimiento y expansión'', ed. by Eufemio Lorenzo Sanz, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many elements of his philosophy have precedents in late [[Aristotelianism]], the [[Neostoicism|revived Stoicism]] of the 16th century, or in earlier philosophers like [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]]. In his [[natural philosophy]], he differed from the [[Scholasticism|schools]] on two major points: first, he rejected the splitting of [[Matter|corporeal substance]] into matter and form; second, he rejected any appeal to [[Teleology|final ends]], divine or natural, in explaining natural phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Carlson |first=Neil R. |title=Physiology of Behavior |publisher=Pearson: Allyn &amp; Bacon |year=2001 |location=Needham Heights, Massachusetts |page=8 |url= |id= |isbn=0-205-30840-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his theology, he insists on the absolute freedom of God's act of creation.

Descartes laid the foundation for 17th-century continental [[rationalism]], later advocated by [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], and opposed by the [[Empiricism|empiricist]] school of thought consisting of [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]], [[John Locke|Locke]], [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]], and [[David Hume|Hume]]. Leibniz, Spinoza&lt;ref&gt;R. H. Moorman, [http://www.faculty.umb.edu/gary_zabel/Courses/Spinoza/Texts/The%20Influence%20of%20Mathematics%20on%20the%20Philosophy%20of%20Spinoza.pdf "The Influence of Mathematics on the Philosophy of Spinoza"], ''National Mathematics Magazine'', Vol. 18, No. 3. (Dec., 1943), pp. 108–115.&lt;/ref&gt;, and Descartes were all well versed in mathematics as well as philosophy, and Descartes and Leibniz contributed greatly to science as well.

René Descartes was born in La Haye en Touraine (now [[Descartes, Indre-et-Loire]]&lt;!--Indre-et-Loire did not exist before 1790--&gt;), France, on 31 March 1596.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/41497065|title=Math and Mathematicians: The History of Math Discoveries Around the World|last=Bruno|first=Leonard C.|date=2003|origyear=1999|publisher=U X L|others=Baker, Lawrence W.|year=|isbn=0787638137|location=Detroit, Mich.|pages=99|oclc=41497065}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother, Jeanne Brochard, died soon after giving birth to him, and so he was not expected to survive.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Descartes' father, Joachim, was a member of the [[Parlement of Brittany]] at [[Rennes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rodis-Lewis |first=Geneviève |chapter=Descartes' Life and the Development of His Philosophy |editor-last=Cottingham |editor-first=John |editor-link=John Cottingham |title=The Cambridge Companion to Descartes |year=1992 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-36696-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Prhr9FBdQ_MC |page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; René lived with his grandmother and with his great-uncle. Although the Descartes family was Roman Catholic, the Poitou region was controlled by the Protestant Huguenots.&lt;ref&gt;[http://all-history.org/world_literature/descartes1.htm All-history.org]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1607, late because of his fragile health, he entered the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[Prytanée National Militaire|Collège Royal Henry-Le-Grand]] at [[La Flèche]],&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/41497065|title=Math and Mathematicians: The History of Math Discoveries Around the World|last=Bruno|first=Leonard C.|date=2003|origyear=1999|publisher=U X L|others=Baker, Lawrence W.|year=|isbn=0787638137|location=Detroit, Mich.|pages=100|oclc=41497065}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clarke (2006), p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; where he was introduced to mathematics and physics, including Galileo's work.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Porter |first1=Roy |authorlink=Roy Porter |title=The Greatest Benefit to Mankind: A Medical History of Humanity from Antiquity to the Present |edition=paperback edition, 135798642 |year=1999 |origyear=1997 |publisher=Harper Collins |location=Great Britain |isbn=0006374549 |page=217 |chapter=The New Science}}&lt;/ref&gt; After graduation in 1614, he studied for two years (1615–16) at the [[University of Poitiers]], earning a ''[[Baccalauréat]]'' and ''[[Licentiate (degree)|Licence]]'' in [[Canon law|canon]] and [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] in 1616,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; in accordance with his father's wishes that he should become a lawyer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last2=Kaufmann |first2=Walter |last=Baird |first=Forrest E. |title=From Plato to Derrida |publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall |year=2008 |location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey |pages=373–377 |url= |id= |isbn=0-13-158591-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From there he moved to Paris.

In ''[[Discourse on the Method]]'', Descartes recalls,
&lt;blockquote&gt;I entirely abandoned the study of letters. Resolving to seek no knowledge other than that of which could be found in myself or else in the great book of the world, I spent the rest of my youth traveling, visiting courts and armies, mixing with people of diverse temperaments and ranks, gathering various experiences, testing myself in the situations which fortune offered me, and at all times reflecting upon whatever came my way so as to derive some profit from it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Given his ambition to become a professional military officer, in 1618, Descartes joined, as a [[mercenary]], the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[Dutch States Army]] in Breda under the command of [[Maurice, Prince of Orange|Maurice of Nassau]],&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; and undertook a formal study of [[military engineering]], as established by [[Simon Stevin]]. Descartes, therefore, received much encouragement in Breda to advance his knowledge of mathematics.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In this way, he became acquainted with [[Isaac Beeckman]],&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; the principal of a [[Dordrecht]] school, for whom he wrote the ''Compendium of Music'' (written 1618, published 1650). Together they worked on [[free fall]], [[catenary]], [[conic section]], and [[Hydrostatics|fluid statics]]. Both believed that it was necessary to create a method that thoroughly linked mathematics and physics.&lt;ref name="Durandin"&gt;Guy Durandin (1970. ''Les Principes de la Philosophie. Introduction et notes.'' Librairie Philosophique. Paris: J. Vrin.&lt;/ref&gt;

While in the service of the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] Duke [[Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria|Maximilian of Bavaria]] since 1619,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Descartes.html History.mcs.st-and.ac.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; Descartes was present at the [[Battle of White Mountain|Battle of the White Mountain]] outside [[Prague]], in November 1620.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/642395/Battle-of-White-Mountain Battle of White Mountain], Britannica Online Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt;

===Visions===
According to [[Adrien Baillet]], on the night of 10–11 November 1619 ([[St. Martin's Day]]), while stationed in [[Neuburg an der Donau]], Descartes shut himself in a room with an "oven" (probably a ''Kachelofen'' or [[masonry heater]]) to escape the cold. While within, he had three dreams&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/41497065|title=Math and mathematicians : the history of math discoveries around the world|last=Bruno|first=Leonard C.|date=2003|origyear=1999|publisher=U X L|others=Baker, Lawrence W.|year=|isbn=0787638137|location=Detroit, Mich.|pages=101|oclc=41497065}}&lt;/ref&gt; and believed that a divine spirit revealed to him a new philosophy. However, it is likely that what Descartes considered to be his second dream was actually an episode of [[exploding head syndrome]].&lt;ref name="Otaiku2018"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Otaiku AI | year = 2018 | title = Did René Descartes have Exploding Head Syndrome? | url = | journal = J Clin Sleep Med. | volume =  14| issue = 4| pages =  675–8| doi = 10.5664/jcsm.7068 | pmid = 29609724 | pmc = 5886445 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon exiting, he had formulated [[analytical geometry]] and the idea of applying the mathematical method to philosophy. He concluded from these visions that the pursuit of science would prove to be, for him, the pursuit of true wisdom and a central part of his life's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Durant |first1=Will |authorlink1=Will Durant |last2=Durant |first2=Ariel |authorlink2=Ariel Durant |title=[[The Story of Civilization: Part VII, the Age of Reason Begins]] |year=1961 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |location=New York |isbn=0-671-01320-3 |page=637}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clarke (2006), pp. 58–59.&lt;/ref&gt; Descartes also saw very clearly that all truths were linked with one another so that finding a fundamental truth and proceeding with logic would open the way to all science. Descartes discovered this basic truth quite soon: his famous "[[Cogito, ergo sum|I think, therefore I am]]".&lt;ref name="Durandin"/&gt;

===France===
In 1620 Descartes left the army. He visited [[Basilica della Santa Casa]] in Loreto, then visited various countries before returning to France, and during the next few years spent time in Paris. It was there that he composed his first essay on method: ''Regulae ad Directionem Ingenii'' ([[Rules for the Direction of the Mind]]).&lt;ref name="Durandin"/&gt; He arrived in [[The Hague|La Haye]] in 1623, selling all of his property to invest in [[Bond (finance)|bonds]], which provided a comfortable income for the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Shea, William R., The Magic of Numbers and Motion, Science History Publications, U.S.A., 1991, pg. 94; Gaukroger, S. Descartes an intellectual biography, pg. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; Descartes was present at the [[siege of La Rochelle]] by [[Cardinal Richelieu]] in 1627.&lt;ref&gt;WR Shea, The Magic of Numbers and Motion, pg 128 citing Baillet&lt;/ref&gt; In the fall of the same year, in the residence of the papal nuncio [[Giovanni Francesco Guidi di Bagno|Guidi di Bagno]], where he came with [[Marin Mersenne|Mersenne]] and many other scholars to listen to a lecture given by the alchemist Nicolas de Villiers, Sieur de Chandoux on the principles of a supposed new philosophy,&lt;ref&gt;Nicolas de Villiers, Sieur de Chandoux, ''Lettres sur l'or potable suivies du traité De la connaissance des vrais principes de la nature et des mélanges et de fragments d'un Commentaire sur l'Amphithéâtre de la Sapience éternelle de Khunrath'', Textes édités et présentés par Sylvain Matton avec des études de Xavier Kieft et de Simone Mazauric. Préface de Vincent Carraud, Paris, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Cardinal [[Pierre de Bérulle|Bérulle]] urged him to write an exposition of his own new philosophy in some location beyond the reach of the inquisition.&lt;ref&gt;A.C.Grayling, Descartes in his times, 2005, pgs 130 to 140&lt;/ref&gt;

===Netherlands===
[[File:Westermarkt 6, Descarteshuis (links).JPG|thumb|In [[Amsterdam]], Descartes lived on Westermarkt 6 (Descarteshuis, on the left).]]

Descartes returned to the Dutch Republic in 1628.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In April 1629 he joined the [[University of Franeker]], studying under [[Adriaan Metius]], living either with a Catholic family, or renting the [[Sjaerdemaslot]], where he invited in vain a French cook and an optician.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} The next year, under the name "Poitevin", he enrolled at the [[Leiden University]] to study mathematics with [[Jacobus Golius]], who confronted him with [[Pappus's hexagon theorem]], and [[astronomy]] with [[Martin van den Hove|Martin Hortensius]].&lt;ref&gt;[[A. C. Grayling]], ''Descartes: The Life of René Descartes and Its Place in His Times'', Simon and Schuster, 2006, pp. 151–152&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1630 he had a falling-out with Beeckman, whom he accused of plagiarizing some of his ideas. In Amsterdam, he had a relationship with a servant girl, Helena Jans van der Strom, with whom he had a daughter, [[Francine Descartes|Francine]], who was born in 1635 in [[Deventer]]. She died of scarlet fever at the age of 5.

Unlike many moralists of the time, Descartes was not devoid of passions but rather defended them; he wept upon Francine's death in 1640.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Durant |first=Will and Ariel |title=The Story of Civilization: Par VII, the Age of reason Begins |year=1961 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |location=New York |isbn=0-671-01320-3 |page=638}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Descartes said that he did not believe that one must refrain from tears to prove oneself a man." [[Russell Shorto]] postulated that the experience of fatherhood and losing a child formed a turning point in Descartes' work, changing its focus from medicine to a quest for universal answers.&lt;ref&gt;Russell Shorto, Descartes' Bones: A Skeletal History of the Conflict Between Faith and Reason {{ISBN|978-0-385-51753-9}} (New York, Random House, 14 October 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite frequent moves,&lt;ref&gt;While in the Netherlands he changed his address frequently, living among other places in Dordrecht (1628), [[Franeker]] (1629), Amsterdam (1629–30), [[Leiden]] (1630), Amsterdam (1630–32), Deventer (1632–34), Amsterdam (1634–35), [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] (1635–36), Leiden (1636), [[Egmond aan den Hoef|Egmond]] (1636–38), [[Santpoort]] (1638–1640), Leiden (1640–41), Endegeest (a castle near [[Oegstgeest]]) (1641–43), and finally for an extended time in [[Egmond-Binnen]] (1643–49).&lt;/ref&gt; he wrote all his major work during his 20-plus years in the Netherlands, where he managed to revolutionize mathematics and philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;He had lived with [[Henricus Reneri]] in Deventer and Amsterdam, and had met with [[Constantijn Huygens]] and Vopiscus Fortunatus Plempius; Descartes was interviewed by Frans Burman at Egmond-Binnen in 1648. [[Henricus Regius]], [[Jan Jansz de Jonge Stampioen|Jan Stampioen]], [[Frans van Schooten]], [[Comenius]] and [[Gisbertus Voetius]] were his main opponents.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1633, [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] was condemned by the [[Catholic Church]], and Descartes abandoned plans to publish ''[[The World (Descartes)|Treatise on the World]]'', his work of the previous four years. Nevertheless, in 1637 he published part of this work&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/41497065|title=Math and mathematicians : the history of math discoveries around the world|last=Bruno|first=Leonard C.|date=2003|origyear=1999|publisher=U X L|others=Baker, Lawrence W.|year=|isbn=0787638137|location=Detroit, Mich.|pages=103|oclc=41497065}}&lt;/ref&gt; in three essays: "Les Météores" (The Meteors), "[[Dioptrique|La Dioptrique]]" (Dioptrics) and "La Géométrie" (Geometry), preceded by an introduction, his famous ''Discours de la méthode'' (Discourse on the Method).&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In it, Descartes lays out four rules of thought, meant to ensure that our knowledge rests upon a firm foundation.

{{Quote|The first was never to accept anything for true which I did not clearly know to be such; that is to say, carefully to avoid precipitancy and prejudice, and to comprise nothing more in my judgment than what was presented to my mind so clearly and distinctly as to exclude all ground of doubt.}}In ''La Géométrie'', Descartes exploited the discoveries he made with [[Pierre de Fermat]], having been able to do so because his paper, Introduction to Loci, was published posthumously in 1679.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Pierre-de-Fermat|title=Pierre de Fermat {{!}} Biography &amp; Facts|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-11-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This later became known as Cartesian Geometry.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;[[File:René Descartes 1644 Principia philosophiae.jpg|thumb|''Principia philosophiae'', 1644]]

Descartes continued to publish works concerning both mathematics and philosophy for the rest of his life. In 1641 he published a metaphysics work, ''Meditationes de Prima Philosophia'' (Meditations on First Philosophy), written in Latin and thus addressed to the learned. It was followed, in 1644, by ''Principia Philosophiæ'' (Principles of Philosophy), a kind of synthesis of the ''Discourse on the Method'' and ''Meditations on First Philosophy''. In 1643, Cartesian philosophy was condemned at the University of Utrecht, and Descartes was obliged to flee to the Hague, and settled in [[Egmond-Binnen]].

Descartes began (through Alfonso Polloti, an Italian general in Dutch service) a long correspondence with [[Elisabeth of the Palatinate|Princess Elisabeth of Bohemia]], devoted mainly to moral and psychological subjects. Connected with this correspondence, in 1649 he published ''Les Passions de l'âme'' (Passions of the Soul), that he dedicated to the Princess. In 1647, he was awarded a pension by King [[Louis XIV of France]], though it was never paid.&lt;ref name="Descartes, René 2009"&gt;Descartes, René. (2009). Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica 2009 Deluxe Edition. Chicago: Encyclopædia Britannica.&lt;/ref&gt; A French translation of ''Principia Philosophiæ'', prepared by Abbot Claude Picot, was published in 1647. This edition Descartes also dedicated to Princess Elisabeth. In [[Principles of Philosophy#Preface to the French edition|the preface to the French edition]], Descartes praised true philosophy as a means to attain wisdom. He identifies four ordinary sources to reach wisdom and finally says that there is a fifth, better and more secure, consisting in the search for first causes.&lt;ref&gt;Blom, John J., Descartes.

[[File:Vasterlanggatan 68 portal March 2007.JPG|thumb|The rear of the "von der Lindeska huset" on Västerlånggatan 68]]

By 1649, Descartes had become famous throughout Europe for being one of the continent's greatest philosophers and scientists.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; That year, [[Christina, Queen of Sweden|Queen Christina of Sweden]] invited Descartes to her court in to organize a new scientific academy and tutor her in his ideas about love. She was interested in and stimulated Descartes to publish the "[[Passions of the Soul]]", a work based on his correspondence with Princess Elisabeth.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite web |last=Smith |first=Kurt |title=Descartes' Life and Works |work=[[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |date=Fall 2010 |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes-works/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Descartes accepted, and moved to Sweden in the middle of winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/41497065|title=Math and mathematicians : the history of math discoveries around the world|last=Bruno|first=Leonard C.|date=2003|origyear=1999|publisher=U X L|others=Baker, Lawrence W.|year=|isbn=0787638137|location=Detroit, Mich.|pages=103–4|oclc=41497065}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a guest at the house of [[Pierre Chanut]], living on [[Västerlånggatan]], less than 500 meters from [[Tre Kronor (castle)|Tre Kronor]] in [[Stockholm]]. There, Chanut and Descartes made observations with a [[Evangelista Torricelli|Torricellian]] barometer, a tube with [[mercury (element)|mercury]]. Challenging [[Blaise Pascal]], Descartes took the first set of barometric readings in Stockholm to see if [[atmospheric pressure]] could be used in forecasting the weather.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islandnet.com/~see/weather/almanac/arc2009/alm09jun.htm Islandnet.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/modernmeteorolog00mete/modernmeteorolog00mete_djvu.txt Archive.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

Descartes apparently started giving lessons to Queen Christina after her birthday, three times a week, at 5 a.m, in her cold and draughty castle. Soon it became clear they did not like each other; she did not like his [[Mechanical philosophy#Descartes and the mechanical philosophy|mechanical philosophy]], nor did he appreciate her interest in [[Ancient Greek]]. &lt;!--Mid January Christina left the city for three weeks.--&gt; By 15 January 1650, Descartes had seen Christina only four or five times.

==Philosophical work==
{{Further|Cartesianism}}

Initially, Descartes arrives at only a single first principle: I think. Thought cannot be separated from me, therefore, I exist (''Discourse on the Method'' and ''Principles of Philosophy''). Most famously, this is known as ''cogito ergo sum'' (English: "I think, therefore I am"). Therefore, Descartes concluded, if he doubted, then something or someone must be doing the doubting, therefore the very fact that he doubted proved his existence.  "The simple meaning of the phrase is that if one is skeptical of existence, that is in and of itself proof that he does exist."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ten books: Chosen by Raj Persuade|publisher=The [[British Journal of Psychiatry]]|url=http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/content/full/181/3/258}}&lt;/ref&gt; These two first principles—I think and I exist—were later confirmed by Descartes's clear and distinct perception (delineated in his Third Meditation): that I clearly and distinctly perceive these two principles, Descartes reasoned, ensures their indubitability.

Descartes concludes that he can be certain that he exists because he thinks. But in what form? He perceives his body through the use of the senses; however, these have previously been unreliable. So Descartes determines that the only indubitable knowledge is that he is a ''thinking thing''. Thinking is what he does, and his power must come from his essence. Descartes defines "thought" (''cogitatio'') as "what happens in me such that I am immediately conscious of it, insofar as I am conscious of it". Thinking is thus every activity of a person of which the person is immediately [[Consciousness|conscious]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=René |last=Descartes |year=1644 |title=The Principles of Philosophy (IX)}}&lt;/ref&gt; He gave reasons for thinking that waking thoughts are distinguishable from [[dream argument|dreams]], and that one's mind cannot have been "hijacked" by an [[evil demon]] placing an illusory external world before one's senses.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

{{quote|And so something that I thought I was seeing with my eyes is in fact grasped solely by the faculty of judgment which is in my mind.}}

In this manner, Descartes proceeds to construct a system of knowledge, discarding [[perception]] as unreliable and, instead, admitting only [[deductive reasoning|deduction]] as a method.&lt;ref name="Preface"/&gt;

===Dualism===

Descartes, influenced by the [[automaton]]s on display throughout the city of Paris, began to investigate the connection between the mind and body, and how the two interact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://people.whitman.edu/~herbrawt/classes/339/Descartes.pdf |title='A Brute to the Brutes?': Descartes' Treatment of Animals |last=Cottingham |first=John |author-link=John Cottingham |access-date=24 February 2018 |work=Whitman People |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; His main influences for [[Mind-body dualism|dualism]] were [[theology]] and [[physics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |jstor=20013943|title=What Moves the Mind: An Excursion in Cartesian Dualism |last=Watson |first=Richard A. |author-link=Richard Watson (philosopher) |date=January 1982 |journal=[[American Philosophical Quarterly]] |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=73–81 |publisher=[[University of Illinois Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory on the dualism of mind and body is Descartes' signature doctrine and permeates other theories he advanced. Known as [[Cartesian dualism]] (or Mind-Body Dualism), his theory on the separation between the mind and the body went on to influence subsequent Western philosophies. In ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]'', Descartes attempted to demonstrate the existence of [[God]] and the distinction between the human soul and the body. Humans are a union of mind and body;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= The Cambridge Companion to Descartes’ Meditations|author=David Cunning |publisher= Cambridge University Press|year=2014 |isbn=9781107729148|pages=277}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus Descartes' dualism embraced the idea that mind and body are distinct but closely joined. While many contemporary readers of Descartes found the distinction between mind and body difficult to grasp, he thought it was entirely straightforward. Descartes employed the concept of ''modes'', which are the ways in which substances exist. In ''[[Principles of Philosophy]]'', Descartes explained, "we can clearly perceive a substance apart from the mode which we say differs from it, whereas we cannot, conversely, understand the mode apart from the substance". To perceive a mode apart from its substance requires an intellectual abstraction,&lt;ref name="David Cunning 2014 278"&gt;{{Cite book|title= The Cambridge Companion to Descartes’ Meditations|author=David Cunning |publisher= Cambridge University Press|year=2014 |isbn=9781107729148|pages=278}}&lt;/ref&gt; which Descartes explained as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The intellectual abstraction consists in my turning my thought away from one part of the contents of this richer idea the better to apply it to the other part with greater attention. Thus, when I consider a shape without thinking of the substance or the extension whose shape it is, I make a mental abstraction.&lt;ref name="David Cunning 2014 278"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Descartes two substances are really distinct when each of them can exist apart from the other. Thus Descartes reasoned that God is distinct from humans, and the body and mind of a human are also distinct from one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= The Cambridge Companion to Descartes’ Meditations|author=David Cunning |publisher= Cambridge University Press|year=2014 |isbn=9781107729148|pages=279}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that the great differences between body (an extended thing) and mind (an un-extended, immaterial thing) make the two ontologically distinct. But that the mind was utterly indivisible: because "when I consider the mind, or myself in so far as I am merely a thinking thing, I am unable to distinguish any part within myself; I understand myself to be something quite single and complete."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= The Cambridge Companion to Descartes’ Meditations|author=David Cunning |publisher= Cambridge University Press|year=2014 |isbn=9781107729148|pages=280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Meditations'' Descartes discussed a piece of [[wax]] and exposed the single most characteristic doctrine of Cartesian dualism: that the universe contained two radically different kinds of substances—the mind or soul defined as [[Thought|thinking]], and the body defined as matter and unthinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Descartes: An Analytic and Historical Introduction|author=Georges Dicker |publisher= OUP USA|year=2013 |isbn=9780195380323|pages=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian philosophy]] of Descartes' days held that the universe was inherently purposeful or theological. Everything that happened, be it the motion of the [[star]]s or the growth of a [[tree]], was supposedly explainable by a certain purpose, goal or end that worked its way out within nature. Aristotle called this the "final cause", and these final causes were indispensable for explaining the ways nature operated. With his theory on dualism Descartes fired the opening shot for the battle between the traditional Aristotelian science and the new science of [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]] and [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] which denied the final cause for explaining nature. Descartes' dualism provided the philosophical rationale for the latter and he expelled the final cause from the physical universe (or ''res extensa''). For Descartes the only place left for the final cause was the mind (or ''res cogitans''). Therefore, while Cartesian dualism paved the way for modern [[physics]], it also held the door open for religious beliefs about the immortality of the [[soul]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Descartes: An Analytic and Historical Introduction|author=Georges Dicker |publisher= OUP USA|year=2013 |isbn=9780195380323|pages=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Descartes' dualism of mind and matter implied a concept of human beings. A human was according to Descartes a composite entity of mind and body. Descartes gave priority to the mind and argued that the mind could exist without the body, but the body could not exist without the mind. In ''Meditations'' Descartes even argues that while the mind is a substance, the body is composed only of "accidents".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Descartes: An Analytic and Historical Introduction|author=Georges Dicker |publisher= OUP USA|year=2013 |isbn=9780195380323|pages=301}}&lt;/ref&gt; But he did argue that mind and body are closely joined:&lt;ref name="Georges Dicker 2013 303"&gt;{{Cite book|title= Descartes: An Analytic and Historical Introduction|author=Georges Dicker |publisher= OUP USA|year=2013 |isbn=9780195380323|pages=303}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Nature also teaches me, by the sensations of pain, hunger, thirst and so on, that I am not merely present in my body as a pilot in his ship, but that I am very closely joined and, as it were, intermingled with it, so that I and the body form a unit. If this were not so, I, who am nothing but a thinking thing, would not feel pain when the body was hurt, but would perceive the damage purely by the intellect, just as a sailor perceives by sight if anything in his ship is broken.&lt;ref name="Georges Dicker 2013 303"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Descartes' discussion on embodiment raised one of the most perplexing problems of his dualism philosophy: What exactly is the relationship of union between the mind and the body of a person?&lt;ref name="Georges Dicker 2013 303"/&gt; Therefore, Cartesian dualism set the agenda for philosophical discussion of the [[mind–body problem]] for many years after Descartes' death.&lt;ref&gt;Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy (online): Descartes and the Pineal Gland.&lt;/ref&gt; Descartes was also a [[Rationalism|rationalist]] and believed in the power of [[Innatism|innate ideas]].&lt;ref name="Eric Shiraev 2010 88"&gt;{{Cite book|title= A History of Psychology: A Global Perspective: A Global Perspective|author=Eric Shiraev |publisher= SAGE|year=2010 |isbn=9781412973830|pages=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Descartes argued the theory of [[innate knowledge]] and that all humans were born with knowledge through the higher power of God. It was this theory of innate knowledge that later led philosopher [[John Locke]] (1632–1704) to combat the theory of [[empiricism]], which held that all knowledge is acquired through experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |jstor=27532614 |title=John Locke's Contributions to Education |last=Baldwin |first=Bird T. |date=April 1913 |publisher=[[The Johns Hopkins University Press]] |journal=[[The Sewanee Review]] |access-date=|volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=177–187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Descartes on physiology and psychology===
In ''The Passions of the Soul'' written between 1645 and 1646 Descartes discussed the common contemporary belief that the human body contained animal spirits. These animal spirits were believed to be light and roaming fluids circulating rapidly around the nervous system between the brain and the muscles, and served as a metaphor for feelings, like being in high or bad spirit. These animal spirits were believed to affect the human soul, or [[passions]] of the soul. Descartes distinguished six basic passions: wonder, love, hatred, desire, joy and sadness. All of these passions, he argued, represented different combinations of the original spirit, and influenced the soul to will or want certain actions. He argued, for example, that fear is a passion that moves the soul to generate a response in the body. In line with his dualist teachings on the separation between the soul and the body, he hypothesized that some part of the brain served as a connector between the soul and the body and singled out the [[pineal gland]] as connector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= A History of Psychology: A Global Perspective: A Global Perspective|author=Eric Shiraev |publisher= SAGE|year=2010 |isbn=9781412973830|pages=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; Descartes argued that signals passed from the ear and the eye to the pineal gland, through animal spirits. Thus different motions in the gland cause various animal spirits. He argued that these motions in the pineal gland are based on God's will and that humans are supposed to want and like things that are useful to them. But he also argued that the animal spirits that moved around the body could distort the commands from the pineal gland, thus humans had to learn how to control their passions.&lt;ref name="Eric Shiraev 2010 87"&gt;{{Cite book|title= A History of Psychology: A Global Perspective: A Global Perspective|author=Eric Shiraev |publisher= SAGE|year=2010 |isbn=9781412973830|pages=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Descartes advanced a theory on automatic bodily reactions to external events which influenced 19th-century [[reflex]] theory. He argued that external motions such as touch and sound reach the endings of the nerves and affect the animal spirits. Heat from fire affects a spot on the skin and sets in motion a chain of reactions, with the animal spirits reaching the brain through the central nervous system, and in turn animal spirits are sent back to the muscles to move the hand away from the fire.&lt;ref name="Eric Shiraev 2010 87"/&gt; Through this chain of reactions the automatic reactions of the body do not require a thought process.&lt;ref name="Eric Shiraev 2010 88"/&gt;

Above all he was among the first scientists who believed that the soul should be subject to scientific investigation. He challenged the views of his contemporaries that the soul was [[Divinity|divine]], thus religious authorities regarded his books as dangerous. Descartes' writings went on to form the basis for theories on [[emotion]]s and how [[Cognition|cognitive]] evaluations were translated into affective processes. Descartes believed that the brain resembled a working machine and unlike many of his contemporaries believed that mathematics and mechanics could explain the most complicated processes of the mind. In the 20th century [[Alan Turing]] advanced [[computer science]] based on [[Mathematical and theoretical biology|mathematical biology]] as inspired by Descartes. His theories on reflexes also served as the foundation for advanced [[Physiology|physiological theories]] more than 200 years after his death. The physiologist [[Ivan Pavlov]] was a great admirer of Descartes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= A History of Psychology: A Global Perspective|author=Eric Shiraev |publisher= SAGE|year=2010 |isbn=9781412973830|pages=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Descartes' moral philosophy===
For Descartes, [[ethics]] was a science, the highest and most perfect of them. Like the rest of the sciences, ethics had its roots in metaphysics.&lt;ref name="Preface"/&gt; In this way, he argues for the existence of God, investigates the place of man in nature, formulates the theory of mind-body dualism, and defends [[free will]]. However, as he was a convinced rationalist, Descartes clearly states that reason is sufficient in the search for the goods that we should seek, and [[virtue]] consists in the correct reasoning that should guide our actions. Nevertheless, the quality of this reasoning depends on knowledge, because a well-informed mind will be more capable of making good [[choices]], and it also depends on mental condition. For this reason, he said that a complete moral philosophy should include the study of the body. He discussed this subject in the correspondence with [[Elisabeth of the Palatinate|Princess Elisabeth of Bohemia]], and as a result wrote his work ''The Passions of the Soul'', that contains a study of the [[Psychosomatic medicine|psychosomatic]] processes and reactions in man, with an emphasis on emotions or passions.&lt;ref name="Blom"&gt;Blom, John J., Descartes. His moral philosophy and psychology. New York University Press. 1978. {{isbn|0-8147-0999-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; His works about human passion and emotion would be the basis for the philosophy of his followers (see [[Cartesianism]]), and would have a lasting impact on ideas concerning what literature and art should be, specifically how it should invoke emotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Scientific Revolution A Brief History with Documents|last=Jacob|first=Margaret C.|publisher=Bedford/St. Martin's|year=2009|isbn=0312653492|location=Boston|pages=16, 17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Humans should seek the [[summum bonum|sovereign good]] that Descartes, following [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]], identifies with virtue, as this produces a solid [[Blessing|blessedness]] or [[pleasure]]. For [[Epicurus]] the sovereign good was pleasure, and Descartes says that, in fact, this is not in contradiction with Zeno's teaching, because virtue produces a spiritual pleasure, that is better than bodily pleasure. Regarding [[Aristotle]]'s opinion that happiness depends on the goods of fortune, Descartes does not deny that this good contributes to happiness but remarks that they are in great proportion outside one's own control, whereas one's mind is under one's complete control.&lt;ref name="Blom"/&gt; The moral writings of Descartes came at the last part of his life, but earlier, in his ''Discourse on the Method'' he adopted three maxims to be able to act while he put all his ideas into doubt. This is known as his [[Discourse on the Method#Part III: Morals, and Maxims accepted while conducting Method|"Provisional Morals"]].

=== Descartes on religious beliefs ===
[[File:Descartes3.jpg|thumb|right|René Descartes at work]]
In the third and fifth ''Meditation'', he offers an [[Ontological argument|ontological proof]] of a benevolent God (through both the ontological argument and [[trademark argument]]). Because God is benevolent, he can have some faith in the account of reality his senses provide him, for God has provided him with a working mind and [[Sensory nervous system|sensory system]] and does not desire to deceive him. From this supposition, however, he finally establishes the possibility of acquiring knowledge about the world based on deduction ''and'' perception. Regarding [[epistemology]], therefore, he can be said to have contributed such ideas as a rigorous conception of [[foundationalism]] and the possibility that [[reason]] is the only reliable method of attaining knowledge. He, nevertheless, was very much aware that experimentation was necessary to verify and validate theories.&lt;ref name="Preface"/&gt;

In his ''Meditations on First Philosophy'' Descartes sets forth two proofs for God's existence. One of these is founded upon the possibility of thinking the "idea of a being that is supremely perfect and infinite," and suggests that "of all the ideas that are in me, the idea that I have of God is the most true, the most clear and distinct."&lt;ref&gt;Descartes, Rene "Meditations on First Philosophy, 3rd Ed., Translated from Latin by: Donald A. Cress&lt;/ref&gt; Descartes considered himself to be a devout Catholic&lt;ref name="books.google.be" /&gt;&lt;ref name="KrR-5EKLSQMC p. 207" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gh_BAAAQBAJ p. 107" /&gt; and one of the purposes of the ''Meditations'' was to defend the Catholic faith. His attempt to ground theological beliefs on reason encountered intense opposition in his time, however: [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]] regarded Descartes' views as rationalist and mechanist, and accused him of [[deism]]: "I cannot forgive Descartes; in all his philosophy, Descartes did his best to dispense with God. But Descartes could not avoid prodding God to set the world in motion with a snap of his lordly fingers; after that, he had no more use for God," while a powerful contemporary, [[Martin Schoock]], accused him of [[Atheism|atheist]] beliefs, though Descartes had provided an explicit critique of atheism in his ''Meditations''. The Catholic Church prohibited his books in 1663.&lt;ref name="Descartes, René 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edward C. Mendler, ''False Truths: The Error of Relying on Authority, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;
{{check quotation}}
Descartes also wrote a response to [[Philosophical skepticism|external world scepticism]]. Through this method of scepticism, he does not doubt for the sake of doubting but to achieve concrete and reliable information. In other words, certainty. He argues that sensory [[perception]]s come to him involuntarily, and are not willed by him. They are external to his senses, and according to Descartes, this is evidence of the existence of something outside of his mind, and thus, an external world. Descartes goes on to show that the things in the external world are material by arguing that God would not deceive him as to the ideas that are being transmitted, and that God has given him the "propensity" to believe that such ideas are caused by material things. Descartes also believes a substance is something that does not need any assistance to function or exist. Descartes further explains how only God can be a true “substance”. But minds are substances, meaning they need only God for it to function. The mind is a thinking substance. The means for a thinking substance stem from ideas.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/descarte/|title=Descartes, Rene {{!}} Internet Encyclopaedia of Philosophy|website=www.iep.utm.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Descartes and natural science===
Descartes is often regarded as the first thinker to emphasize the use of reason to develop the [[natural science]]s.&lt;ref&gt;

{{quote|Thus, all Philosophy is like a tree, of which Metaphysics is the root, Physics the trunk, and all the other sciences the branches that grow out of this trunk, which are reduced to three principals, namely, Medicine, Mechanics, and Ethics. By the science of Morals, I understand the highest and most perfect which, presupposing an entire knowledge of the other sciences, is the last degree of wisdom.}}
In his ''Discourse on the Method'', he attempts to arrive at a fundamental set of principles that one can know as true without any doubt. To achieve this, he employs a method called hyperbolical/metaphysical doubt, also sometimes referred to as [[methodological scepticism]]: he rejects any ideas that can be doubted and then re-establishes them in order to acquire a firm foundation for genuine knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Rebecca |last=Copenhaver |title=Forms of skepticism |url=http://www.lclark.edu/~rebeccac/forms.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050108095032/http://www.lclark.edu/~rebeccac/forms.html |archivedate=8 January 2005 |accessdate=15 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Descartes built his ideas from scratch. He relates this to architecture: the top soil is taken away to create a new building or structure. Descartes calls his doubt the soil and new knowledge the buildings. To Descartes, Aristotle's foundationalism is incomplete and his method of doubt enhances foundationalism.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2016/entries/descartes-epistemology/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Newman|first=Lex|date=2016-01-01|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Winter 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Descartes on animals===
Descartes denied that animals had reason or intelligence. He argued that animals did not lack sensations or perceptions, but these could be explained mechanistically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Animal Consciousness'', No. 2. Historical background| publisher=Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy|date=23 December 1995|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consciousness-animal/#hist|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas humans had a soul, or mind, and were able to feel [[pain]] and [[anxiety]], animals by virtue of not having a soul could not feel pain or anxiety. If animals showed signs of distress then this was to protect the body from damage, but the innate state needed for them to [[Suffering|suffer]] was absent. Although Descartes' views were not universally accepted they became prominent in Europe and North America, allowing humans to treat animals with impunity. The view that animals were quite separate from humanity and merely [[machine]]s allowed for the maltreatment of animals, and was sanctioned in law and societal norms until the middle of the 19th century. The publications of [[Charles Darwin]] would eventually erode the Cartesian view of animals. Darwin argued that the continuity between humans and other species opened the possibilities that animals did not have dissimilar properties to suffer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Charles Darwin: The Shaping of Evolutionary Thinking|author=Lance Workman |publisher= Palgrave Macmillan|year=2013 |isbn= 9781137313232|pages=177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical impact==
===Emancipation from Church doctrine===
[[File:DescartesMeditations.png|thumb|Cover of ''Meditations'']]

Descartes has often been dubbed the father of modern [[Western philosophy]], the thinker whose approach has profoundly changed the course of Western philosophy and set the basis for [[modernity]].&lt;ref name="Russell2004p516"&gt;[[Bertrand Russell]] (2004) [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ey94E3sOMA0C&amp;pg=PA516 ''History of western philosophy''] pp.511, 516–7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger [1938] (2002), p. 76 quotation: {{quote|Descartes... that which he himself founded... modern (and that means, at the same time, Western) metaphysics.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first two of his ''Meditations on First Philosophy'', those that formulate the famous [[Cartesian doubt|methodic doubt]], represent the portion of Descartes' writings that most influenced modern thinking.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tad Schmaltz|Schmaltz, Tad M.]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=pIYcUBCOrNgC&amp;pg=PA27 ''Radical Cartesianism: The French Reception of Descartes''] p.27 quotation: {{quote|The Descartes most familiar to twentieth-century philosophers is the Descartes of the first two ''Meditations'', someone proccupied with hyperbolic doubt of the material world and the certainty of knowledge of the self that emerges from the famous cogito argument.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that Descartes himself didn't realize the extent of this revolutionary move.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roy Wood Sellars]] (1949) [https://books.google.com/books?id=y1wNAAAAIAAJ ''Philosophy for the future: the quest of modern materialism''] quotation: {{quote|Husserl has taken Descartes very seriously in a historical as well as in a systematic sense [...] [in ''The Crisis of the European Sciences and Transcendental Phenomenology'', Husserl] finds in the first two Meditations of Descartes a depth which it is difficult to fathom, and which Descartes himself was so little able to appreciate that he let go "the great discovery" he had in his hands.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In shifting the debate from "what is true" to "of what can I be certain?," Descartes arguably shifted the authoritative guarantor of truth from God to humanity (even though Descartes himself claimed he received his visions from God)—while the traditional concept of "truth" implies an external authority, "certainty" instead relies on the judgment of the individual.

In an [[Anthropocentrism|anthropocentric]] revolution, the human being is now raised to the level of a subject, an agent, an [[Emancipation|emancipated]] being equipped with autonomous reason. This was a revolutionary step that established the basis of modernity, the repercussions of which are still being felt: the emancipation of humanity from Christian [[revelation]]al truth and [[Catholic Church|Church doctrine]]; humanity making its own law and taking its own stand.&lt;ref name="Heidegger1938emancipated"&gt;Martin Heidegger [1938] (2002) ''The Age of the World Picture'' quotation: {{quote|For up to Descartes...a particular ''sub-iectum''...lies at the foundation of its own fixed qualities and changing circumstances.

This anthropocentric perspective of Descartes' work, establishing human reason as autonomous, provided the basis for the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]'s emancipation from God and the Church. According to Martin Heidegger, the perspective of Descartes' work also provided the basis for all subsequent [[anthropology]].&lt;ref name="Heidegger19382002p75"&gt;Heidegger [1938] (2002), p. 75 quotation: {{quote|With the interpretation of man as ''subiectum'', Descartes creates the metaphysical presupposition for future anthropology of every kind and tendency.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Descartes' philosophical revolution is sometimes said to have sparked modern [[anthropocentrism]] and [[subjectivism]].&lt;ref name="Russell2004p516"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Isadore Schwart [https://books.google.com/books?id=Wt4XDLEpjWYC&amp;pg=PA95 ''China and Other Matters''] p.95 quotation: {{quote|...&amp;nbsp;the kind of anthropocentric subjectivism which has emerged from the Cartesian revolution.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles B.

One of Descartes' most enduring legacies was his development of [[analytic geometry|Cartesian or analytic geometry]], which uses algebra to describe geometry. He "invented the convention of representing unknowns in equations by ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'', and knowns by ''a'', ''b'', and ''c''". He also "pioneered the standard notation" that uses [[Subscript and superscript|superscripts]] to show the powers or exponents; for example, the 2 used in x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to indicate x squared.&lt;ref&gt;René Descartes, ''Discourse de la Méthode'' (Leiden, Netherlands): Jan Maire, 1637, appended book: ''La Géométrie'', book one, [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b86069594/f383.image page 299.] From page 299: ''" ... Et ''aa'', ou ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, pour multiplier ''a'' par soy mesme; Et ''a''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, pour le multiplier encore une fois par ''a'', &amp; ainsi a l'infini ; ... "'' ( ... and ''aa'', or ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, in order to multiply ''a'' by itself; and ''a''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, in order to multiply it once more by ''a'', and thus to infinity ; ... )&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tom Sorell, ''Descartes: A Very Short Introduction'' (2000). New York: Oxford University Press. p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; He was first to assign a fundamental place for algebra in our system of knowledge, using it as a method to automate or mechanize reasoning, particularly about abstract, unknown quantities. European mathematicians had previously viewed geometry as a more fundamental form of mathematics, serving as the foundation of algebra. Algebraic rules were given geometric proofs by mathematicians such as [[Luca Pacioli|Pacioli]], [[Gerolamo Cardano|Cardan]], [[Niccolò Fontana Tartaglia|Tartaglia]] and [[Lodovico Ferrari|Ferrari]]. Equations of [[Degree of a polynomial|degree]] higher than the third were regarded as unreal, because a three-dimensional form, such as a cube, occupied the largest dimension of reality. Descartes professed that the abstract quantity ''a&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' could represent length as well as an area. This was in opposition to the teachings of mathematicians, such as [[François Viète|Vieta]], who argued that it could represent only area. Although Descartes did not pursue the subject, he preceded [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] in envisioning a more general science of algebra or "universal mathematics," as a precursor to [[Mathematical logic|symbolic logic]], that could encompass logical principles and methods symbolically, and mechanize general reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;[[Morris Kline]], ''Mathematical Thought from Ancient to Modern Times'' (1972). New York: Oxford University Press. pp. 280–281&lt;/ref&gt;

Descartes' work provided the basis for the [[calculus]] developed by [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] and Leibniz, who applied infinitesimal calculus to the [[Tangent#Analytical approach|tangent line problem]], thus permitting the evolution of that branch of modern mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jan |last=Gullberg |authorlink=Jan Gullberg |year=1997 |title=Mathematics From The Birth of Numbers |publisher=W. W. Norton |isbn=0-393-04002-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; His [[Descartes' rule of signs|rule of signs]] is also a commonly used method to determine the number of positive and negative roots of a polynomial.

The beginning to Descartes' interest in physics is accredited to the amateur scientist and mathematician [[Isaac Beeckman]], who was at the forefront of a new school of thought known as [[mechanical philosophy]]. With this foundation of reasoning, Descartes formulated many of his theories on mechanical and geometrical physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2017/entries/descartes-physics/|last=Slowik|first=Edward|title=Descartes' Physics|publisher=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy Archive|date=22 August 2017|editor=Edward N. Zalta|accessdate=1 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Descartes discovered an early form of the law of conservation of mechanical [[momentum]] (a measure of the motion of an object), and envisioned it as pertaining to motion in a straight line, as opposed to perfect circular motion, as [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] had envisioned it. He outlined his views on the universe in his ''[[Principles of Philosophy]]''.

Descartes also made contributions to the field of [[optics]]. He showed by using geometric construction and the [[law of refraction]] (also known as Descartes' law or more commonly [[Snell's law]]) that the angular radius of a [[rainbow]] is 42 degrees (i.e., the angle subtended at the eye by the edge of the rainbow and the ray passing from the sun through the rainbow's centre is 42°).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tipler |first=P. A. and G. Mosca |year=2004 |title=Physics For Scientists And Engineers |publisher=W. H. Freeman |isbn=0-7167-4389-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also independently discovered the [[Specular reflection|law of reflection]], and his essay on optics was the first published mention of this law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=2008 |encyclopedia=Encarta |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761555262/Rene_Descartes.html#s3 |title=René Descartes |publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=15 August 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070907142158/http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761555262/Rene_Descartes.html |archivedate=7 September 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influence on Newton's mathematics===
Current opinion is that Descartes had the most influence of anyone on the young Newton, and this is arguably one of Descartes' most important contributions. Newton continued Descartes' work on cubic equations, which freed the subject from the fetters of the Greek perspectives. The most important concept was his very modern treatment of independent variables.&lt;ref&gt;''Contemporary Newtonian Research'', edited by Z. Bechler, p. 109-129, ''Newton the Mathematician'', by Daniel T. Whiteside, Springer, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary reception===
Although Descartes was well known in academic circles towards the end of his life, the teaching of his works in schools was controversial. Henri de Roy ([[Henricus Regius]], 1598–1679), Professor of Medicine at the University of Utrecht, was condemned by the Rector of the University, [[Gisbertus Voetius|Gijsbert Voet]] (Voetius), for teaching Descartes' physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cottingham |first=John |author-link=John Cottingham |first2=Dugald |last2=Murdoch |first3=Robert |last3=Stoothof |title=The Philosophical Writings of Descartes |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=T5cSfRS4m5QC&amp;pg=PA293 |chapter=Comments on a Certain Broadsheet |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=1984 |page=293 |isbn=9780521288071}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 1618. ''Musicae Compendium''. A treatise on music theory and the aesthetics of music written for Descartes' early collaborator, Isaac Beeckman (first posthumous edition 1650).
* 1626–1628. ''Regulae ad directionem ingenii'' (''[[Rules for the Direction of the Mind]]''). Incomplete. First published posthumously in Dutch translation in 1684 and in the original Latin at Amsterdam in 1701 (''R. Des-Cartes Opuscula Posthuma Physica et Mathematica''). The best critical edition, which includes the Dutch translation of 1684, is edited by Giovanni Crapulli (The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff, 1966).
* 1630–1631. ''La recherche de la vérité par la lumière naturelle'' (''The Search for Truth'') unfinished dialogue published in 1701.
* 1630–1633. ''Le Monde'' (''[[The World (Descartes)|The World]]'') and ''L'Homme'' (''Man''). Descartes' first systematic presentation of his natural philosophy. ''Man'' was published posthumously in Latin translation in 1662; and ''The World'' posthumously in 1664.
* 1637. ''Discours de la méthode'' (''[[Discourse on the Method]]''). An introduction to the ''Essais'', which include the ''Dioptrique'', the ''Météores'' and the ''Géométrie''.

* 1641. ''Meditationes de prima philosophia'' (''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]''), also known as ''Metaphysical Meditations''. In Latin; a second edition, published the following year, included an additional objection and reply, and a ''Letter to Dinet''. A French translation by the Duke of Luynes, probably done without Descartes' supervision, was published in 1647. Includes six [[Meditations on First Philosophy#Objections and replies|Objections and Replies]]. 
* 1644. ''Principia philosophiae'' (''[[Principles of Philosophy]]''), a Latin textbook at first intended by Descartes to replace the Aristotelian textbooks then used in universities. A French translation, ''Principes de philosophie'' by Claude Picot, under the supervision of Descartes, appeared in 1647 with a letter-preface to Princess Elisabeth of Bohemia.
* 1647. ''Notae in programma'' (''Comments on a Certain Broadsheet''). A reply to Descartes' one-time disciple Henricus Regius.
* 1648. ''La description du corps humain'' (''[[The Description of the Human Body]]''). Published posthumously by Clerselier in 1667.
* 1648. ''Responsiones Renati Des Cartes...'' (''Conversation with Burman''). Notes on a Q&amp;A session between Descartes and Frans Burman on 16 April 1648. Rediscovered in 1895 and published for the first time in 1896. An annotated bilingual edition (Latin with French translation), edited by Jean-Marie Beyssade, was published in 1981 (Paris: PUF).
* 1649. ''Les passions de l'âme'' (''[[Passions of the Soul]]''). Dedicated to Princess [[Elisabeth of the Palatinate]].
* 1657. ''Correspondance'' (three volumes: 1657, 1659, 1667). Published by Descartes' literary executor [[Claude Clerselier]]. The third edition, in 1667, was the most complete; Clerselier omitted, however, much of the material pertaining to mathematics.

In January 2010, a previously unknown letter from Descartes, dated 27 May 1641, was found by the Dutch philosopher Erik-Jan Bos when browsing through [[Google Search|Google]]. Bos found the letter mentioned in a summary of autographs kept by [[Haverford College]] in [[Haverford, Pennsylvania]]. The college was unaware that the letter had never been published. This was the third letter by Descartes found in the last 25 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Vlasblom |first=Dirk |url=http://www.nrc.nl/international/article2492445.ece/Unknown_letter_from_Descartes_found |title=Unknown letter from Descartes found |newspaper=[[NRC.nl]] |date=25 February 2010 |access-date=30 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161108023903/http://vorige.nrc.nl/international/article2492445.ece/Unknown_letter_from_Descartes_found |archive-date=8 November 2016 |language=nl |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |language=nl |url=http://www.nrc.nl/wetenschap/article2491995.ece/Hoe_Descartes_in_1641_op_andere_gedachten_kwam |title=Hoe Descartes in 1641 op andere gedachten kwam |last=Vlasblom |first=Drik |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027192606/http://vorige.nrc.nl/wetenschap/article2491995.ece/Hoe_Descartes_in_1641_op_andere_gedachten_kwam |archive-date=27 October 2016 |newspaper=[[NRC.nl]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''right to protest''' is a human right arising out of a number of recognized [[human rights]]. While no human rights instrument or national constitution grants the absolute right to [[protest]], such a right to protest may be a manifestation of the right to [[freedom of assembly]], the right to [[freedom of association]], and the right to [[freedom of speech]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourrights.org.uk/your-rights/chapters/the-right-of-peaceful-protest/the-historic-right-of-peaceful-protest/the-historic-right-of-peaceful-protest.shtml|title=The Historic Right to Peaceful Protest|date=19 September 2006|publisher=YourRights.org.uk ([[Liberty (advocacy group)|Liberty]])|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430160441/http://www.yourrights.org.uk/your-rights/chapters/the-right-of-peaceful-protest/the-historic-right-of-peaceful-protest/the-historic-right-of-peaceful-protest.shtml|archivedate=30 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;Additionally, protest and restrictions on protest have lasted as long as governments have.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt183q56g|title="The Right to Peaceful Protest" in Your Rights: The Liberty Guide to Human Rights|last=Cooper|first=Jo|date=2005|publisher=Pluto Press|year=|isbn=9780745322766|editor-last=Addis|editor-first=Megan|edition=8|location=|pages=|editor-last2=Morrow|editor-first2=Penelope}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many international treaties contain clear articulations of the right to protest and it is crucial for individuals who are interested in protesting to stay up to date and aware. Such agreements include the 1950 [[European Convention on Human Rights]], especially Articles 9 to 11; and the 1966 [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], especially Articles 18 to 22. Articles 9 enunciates the "right to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;[https://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Convention_ENG.pdf Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms] and/or ''[https://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CCPR.aspx International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]'' Office of the United Nations High Commissioner of Human Rights&lt;/ref&gt; Article 10 enunciates the "right to freedom of expression."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Article 11 enunciates the "right to freedom of association with others, including the right to form and to join trade unions for the protection of his interests."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; However, in these and other agreements the rights of freedom of assembly, freedom of association, and freedom of speech are subject to certain limitations. For example, the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] contains prohibitions on "[[propaganda]] of war" and advocacy of "national, racial or religious [[hatred]]"; and it allows the restriction of the freedom to assembly if it is necessary "in a democratic society in the interests of national security or public safety, public order, the protection of public health or morals or the protection of the rights and freedoms of others." (Articles 20 and 21)&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; It is important for people interested in protest to note that different places have passed their own clarification of these rights.

Protesting, however, is not necessarily violent or a threat to the interests of national security or public safety. Nor is it necessarily [[civil disobedience]], because most protest does not involve violating the laws of the state. Also, since it is an expression of a universal right, choosing to lawfully protest is not a violation of state laws. Protests, even campaigns of [[nonviolent resistance]] or [[civil resistance]], can often have the character (in addition to using nonviolent methods) of positively supporting a democratic and constitutional order. This can happen, for example, when such resistance arises in response to a military [[coup d'état]];&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;[[Adam Roberts (scholar)|Adam Roberts]], "Civil Resistance to Military Coups", ''[[Journal of Peace Research]]'', Oslo, vol. 12, no. 1, 1975, pp. 19-36.&lt;/ref&gt; or in the somewhat similar case of a refusal of the state leadership to surrender office following defeat in an election. During points of widespread tension or controversy within a society, it is important for government institutions to recognize this right. A democracy's ability to preserve its citizen's right to protest is a result of that democracy's "political health."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Shooting sports''' is a collective group of [[competitive sport|competitive]] and [[recreation]]al [[sport]]ing activities involving proficiency tests of accuracy, precision and speed in [[shooting]], using various types of [[ranged weapon]]s, mainly referring to [[small arms|man-portable]] [[guns]] ([[firearm]]s and [[airgun]]s, in forms such as [[handgun]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nssf.org/shooting/handgun/ Handgun Sports • NSSF | National Shooting Sports Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt; [[rifle]]s&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nssf.org/shooting/rifle/ Rifle Sports • NSSF | National Shooting Sports Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[shotgun]]s&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nssf.org/shooting/shotgun/ Shotgun Sports • NSSF | National Shooting Sports Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt;) and [[bow and arrow|bows]]/[[crossbow]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.archery360.com/archery-101/ Archery 101 by Archery 360]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://worldarchery.org/Archery Archery | World Archery]&lt;/ref&gt;

Different disciplines of shooting sports can be categorized by equipment, shooting distances, [[shooting target|targets]], [[time limit]]s and degrees of [[sport of athletics|athleticism]] involved. Shooting sports may involve both team and individual competition, and team performance is usually assessed by summing the scores of the individual team members.

== History ==
The [[National Rifle Association of the United Kingdom]] (NRA) was founded in 1860 to raise the funds for an annual national rifle meeting "for the encouragement of Volunteer Rifle Corps and the promotion of Rifle-shooting throughout Great Britain".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.researchpress.co.uk/wimbledon/wimbledon.htm "Volunteers &amp; The NRA"], researchpress.co.uk {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120423040445/http://www.researchpress.co.uk/wimbledon/wimbledon.htm |date=April 23, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For similar reasons, concerned over poor marksmanship during the [[American Civil War]], veteran Union officers Col. William C. Church and Gen. George Wingate formed the [[National Rifle Association]] of America in 1871 for the purpose of promoting and encouraging rifle shooting on a "scientific" basis.&lt;ref name="Australia"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ssaa.org.au/|title={{!}} Sporting Shooters' Association of Australia (SSAA)|last=Australia|first=Sporting Shooter's Association of|website=ssaa.org.au|access-date=2016-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1872, with financial help from New York state, a site on Long Island, the Creed Farm, was purchased for the purpose of building a rifle range. Named [[Creedmoor Rifle Range|Creedmoor]], the range opened in 1872, and became the site of the first [[National Matches]] until New York politics forced the NRA to move the matches to [[Sea Girt, New Jersey]]. The popularity of the [[National Matches]] soon forced the event to be moved to its present, much larger location: [[Camp Perry]]. In 1903, the U.S. Congress created the [[National Board for the Promotion of Rifle Practice]] (NBPRP), an advisory board to the Secretary of the Army, with a nearly identical charter to the NRA. The NBPRP (now known as the [[Civilian Marksmanship Program]]) also participates in the National Matches at Camp Perry.&lt;ref name="olympic.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.olympic.org/shooting-equipment-and-history|title=Shooting Equipment and history - Olympic Sport History|website=www.olympic.org|access-date=2016-08-12|date=2018-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Washington DC Girls' Rifle Team.jpg|right|thumb|Girls' rifle team at Central High, Washington, DC. November 1922.]]

In 1903, the NRA began to establish rifle clubs at all major colleges, universities, and military academies. By 1906, youth programs were in full swing with more than 200 boys competing in the [[National Matches]]. Today, more than one million youth participate in shooting sports events and affiliated programs through groups such as [[4-H]], the [[Boy Scouts of America]], the [[American Legion]], U.S. [[Jaycees]], [[NCAA]], The [[USA High School Clay Target League]], the Scholastic Clay Target Program, [[National Guard Bureau]], [[ROTC]], and [[JROTC]].

[[France|French]] pistol champion and founder of the modern Olympics, [[Pierre de Coubertin]], participated in many of these early competitions. This fact certainly contributed to the inclusion of five shooting events in the [[1896 Summer Olympics|1896 Olympics]]. Over the years, the events have been changed a number of times in order to keep up with technology and social standards. the targets that formerly resembled humans or animals in their shape and size have are now a circular shape in order to avoid associating the sport with any form of violence. At the same time, some events have been dropped and new ones have been added. The 2004 Olympics featured three shooting disciplines (rifle, pistol, and shotgun) where athletes competed for 51 medals in 10 men's and 7 women's events—slightly fewer than the previous Olympic schedule.&lt;ref name="Australia"/&gt;

In the Olympic Games, the shooting sport has always enjoyed the distinction of awarding the first medals of the Games. Internationally, the [[International Shooting Sport Federation]] (ISSF) has oversight of all Olympic shooting events worldwide, while National Governing Bodies (NGBs) administer the sport within each country.

Having originally established shooting as an organized sport in the USA, the NRA was the obvious choice to administer the United States participation in the Olympic games. The NRA dutifully managed and financially supported international and conventional shooting sports (i.e., [[National Matches]]) for over 100 years until the formation of [[USA Shooting]].

== Gun shooting sports ==
[[File:Bullet coming from S&amp;W.jpg|thumb|right|[[High-speed photography]] of the smoke of burnt [[smokeless powder|gunpowder]] and a [[.38 Special]] bullet fired out of a [[Smith &amp; Wesson Model 686]] revolver.]]
Gun shooting sports are shot with either [[firearm]]s or [[air gun]]s, which can be either [[handgun]]s, [[rifle]]s and/or [[shotgun]]s.

Handguns are handheld [[small arms]] designed to be shot off-hand without needing a [[shoulder stock]]. The two main subtypes of handguns are [[pistol]]s and [[revolver]]s. They are much more convenient to carry in general, but usually have a shorter effective range and less [[accuracy]] compared to [[long gun]]s such as rifles. In shooting sports, revolvers and [[semi-automatic pistol]]s are the most commonly used.

A [[rifle]] is a [[long gun]] with a [[rifling|rifled]] [[gun barrel|barrel]], and requires the use of both hands to hold and brace against the shoulder via a [[stock (firearms)|stock]] in order to shoot steadily. They generally have a longer range and greater accuracy than handguns, and are popular for hunting. In shooting sports, [[bolt action rifle|bolt action]] or [[semi-automatic rifle]]s are the most commonly used.

A [[shotgun]] is similar to a rifle but often [[smoothbore]] and larger in [[caliber]], and typically fires either a [[shotgun shell|shell]] containing many smaller scattering sub-projectiles called [[shot (pellet)|shots]], or a single large projectile called a [[slug (projectile)|slug]]. In shooting sports, shotguns are more often [[double-barreled shotgun#Barrel configuration|over/under]]-type [[break action]] or [[semi-automatic shotgun]]s, and the majority of shotgun events are included in [[clay pigeon shooting]].

=== Bullseye shooting ===
[[File:Target 223 Savage 10FP 25 shot.jpg|thumb|right|A round [[shooting target]] with several hits in the center, which is called "bullseye".]]
''[[Bullseye shooting]]'' is a term used to describe several pistol and rifle shooting disciplines where the objective is to achieve as many points as possible by hitting a round shooting target as close to the middle as possible with slow precision fire. These disciplines place a large emphasis on precision and accuracy through sight picture, breath and trigger control.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} Fixed and relatively long time limits give the competitors time to concentrate for a perfect shot. An example of bullseye shooting is the [[International Shooting Sport Federation|ISSF]] pistol and rifle disciplines, but there are also many other national and international disciplines which can be classified as bullseye shooting. The shooting distances are typically given in round numbers, such as 10 15, 25, 50, 100, 200 or 300 meters depending on firearm type and discipline. Competitions are usually shot from permanent [[shooting range]]s and with the same target arrangement and distance from match to match. Usually the competitors each have their own [[shooting target]] and shoot beside each other simultaneously. Because of the relatively simple match format, beginners are often recommended bullseye shooting in order to learn the fundamentals of marksmanship.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} Bullseye shooting is part of the [[Summer Olympic Games]], and a considerable amount of training is needed to become proficient.

==== Bullseye shooting with handguns ====
* The six [[ISSF shooting events]] with pistols (four Olympic events plus two events not included in the Olympics program but are contested in World Cups and World Championships), its roots date back to the first modern Olympic Games in 1896, consist of both precision slow-fire and rapid-fire target shooting from distances of 10, 25, and 50 meters. The pistols are unique in appearance compared to normal guns and each events has its own pistols designed specifically for the job. Shooters must use one hand only to shoot at small "bullseye" target downrange. In the UK (except for Northern Ireland), it is no longer possible to practice for some of the Olympic events following the [[Firearms (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 1997]], legislation brought in after the [[Dunblane Massacre]].
* The [[International Military Sports Council|CISM]] Rapid Fire match is similar to the ISSF [[25 m Rapid Fire Pistol]] event.
* [[NRA Precision Pistol]], also called conventional pistol shooting, is a bullseye shooting where up to 3 handguns of differing calibers are used. Its history is almost as old as ISSF events. Shooters must fire the pistol one-handed at 6- and 8-inch bullseye targets placed 25 and 50 yards downrange respectively.
* [[Precision Pistol Competition]] (PPC), was originally a police shooting program started in 1960 by the [[National Rifle Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |year=2015 |title=NRA Law Enforcement Division: Police Pistol Combat Competition |url=http://ppc.nra.org/ppc.aspx |website=ppc.nra.org |publisher=National Rifle Association of America |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==== Bullseye shooting with rifles ====
* Four position [[small bore]] is a popular sport in the U.S.&lt;ref name="olympic.org"/&gt;
* The six rifle [[ISSF shooting events]] (including three Olympic events) consist of long-time target shooting from distances of {{convert|10|or|50|or|300|m}}.&lt;ref name="olympic.org"/&gt;
* [[Gallery rifle shooting]] is popular in the UK and was introduced as a substitute for many pistol shooting disciplines following the 1997 [[Gun politics in the United Kingdom|handgun ban]].
* [[High Power Rifle]] (also known as "Across the Course" or 'traditional' High power) in the United States is a format that shoots 3-position (standing, kneeling, or sitting, and prone) at 200, 300, and 600 yards. The term "Across the Course" is used because the match format requires the competitors to shoot at different distances to complete the course of fire.
* Military [[Service Rifle shooting]] is a shooting discipline that involves the use of rifles that are used by military forces and law-enforcement agencies, both past and present use. Ex-military rifles, sniper rifles (both past and present) and civilian versions of current use service rifles are commonly used in the Military Service Rifle shooting competitions. It is popular in the United States and culminates each year with the National Matches being held at [[Camp Perry]], Ohio. Some countries have outlawed civilian shooting at human-silhouette targets; silhouette targets are not used in the National Match Course of Fire. Bullseye targets are used. High Power Rifle competition often is held at the same events as Service Rifle, such as the U.S. national championships each year at Camp Perry. High Power competitors generally are civilians using whatever rifles they prefer within the rules, whereas Service Rifle entrants are limited to current or previous U.S. armed forces weapons. Although according to NRA rules only certain matches allow optical sights, normally those conducted at ranges over 600 yards.
* [[Project Appleseed]] is a rifle marksmanship program by The Revolutionary War Veterans Association that teaches both rifle marksmanship and oral history regarding the American Revolutionary War. It shoots 3-position (standing, sitting, and prone) at 25 meters at reduced scale targets, simulating shooting at 100, 200, 300, and 400 yards. The techniques taught easily apply to transitioning to [[High Power Rifle]].
* Full bore and small bore rifle shooting in the United Kingdom.
* [[Three positions|Three position]] airgun competitions, popular in the [[United States]].

* Nordic Handgun Field-Shooting competitions are shot with pistol and revolver in different classes depending on equipment,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pistolskytteforbundet.se/om-pistolskytte/faltskjutning Swedish: Svenska Pistolskytteförbundet-Om pistolskytte-Fältskjutning]&lt;/ref&gt; with classes up from small-bore .22 LR to large-bore [[.500 S&amp;W Magnum]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://haugesund-pistolklubb.no/?page_id=283 Norwegian: Litt om feltskyting – Haugesund Pistolklubb (''English: A little about field shooting - Haugesund Pistol Club'')]&lt;/ref&gt; Matches are held outdoor throughout the year with varied [[shooting target]]s and distances, and are arranged by the [[Norwegian Shooting Association]] (NSF), the [[Danish Gymnastics and Sports Associations]] (DGI Shooting) and the [[Swedish Pistol Shooting Association]] (SPSF).

&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==== Field shooting with rifles ====
* Nordic Rifle Field-Shooting&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sandvikensskyttegille.se/fs_info.php Swedish: Fältskytte gevär förklarat | Sandvikens Skyttegille]&lt;/ref&gt; are shot with either small-bore .22 LR cartridge at 100 meters, or [[intermediate cartridge|intermediate]] (such as [[.223 Remington]] or [[6mm BR]]) or battle rifle cartridges (such as the [[6.5×55mm]], [[.308 Winchester]] or the [[.30-06 Springfield]]) at distances from 100 to 650 meters. With 200 and 300 meters being ordinary shooting distance in Nordic Bullseye Rifle-Shooting, those targets placed well beyond 300 meters in Rifle Field-Shooting means that the competition format also can be classified as a [[long range shooting]] discipline. Matches are usually held in the winter season with varied targets, and are arranged by the [[National Rifle Association of Norway]] (DFS), the [[Danish Gymnastics and Sports Associations]] (DGI Shooting) and the [[Swedish Shooting Sport Association]] (SvSF). 
* [[Precision rifle competition]]s, like the [[Precision Rifle Series]] (PRS), is both a field and long range shooting discipline where rifles with intermediate or battle rifle cartridges are shot in the terrain at varying distances from about 10 to 1000 meters.
* [[Field Target]] is an outdoor [[air gun]] discipline originating in the United Kingdom, but gaining popularity worldwide.

=== Rapid fire ===
==== Rapid fire with handguns ====
* [[The Bianchi Cup]], a fusion of [[International Practical Shooting Confederation|IPSC]] (without the "run and gun" element) and bullseye shooting (except shot with two hands and going prone whenever rules allow it) where accuracy under tight time limits in four simulated scenarios, known as the "Event(s)", is the basis of this competition. Shooters must start with gun in the holster on every strings of fire and distances range from 10 to 50 yards.
* [[Fast draw]], also known as quick draw, a form of pistol action shooting from North America, based on the romanticized art of the gunslingers in the American Old West, using traditional single action revolvers. But unlike Cowboy action shooting, Fast Draw is done with special blanks or wax bullets. While some competitions are strictly against the clock, with the fastest time winning, many are set up as head to head single or double elimination matches.

==== Rapid fire with rifles ====
* The [[International Military Sports Council|CISM]] Rapid Fire match is a sped-up version of the ISSF [[300 m Standard Rifle]] event.
* [[Felthurtigskyting]] (literally Field Rapid Shooting) and [[Stangskyting]] are a type of variable rapid-fire rifle competitions popular in Scandinavia.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Clay target ===
[[Clay pigeon shooting]] are shotgun disciplines shot at flying [[shooting target|clay pigeon targets]].

* The three Shotgun ISSF/ Olympic shooting events are all are based on quick reaction to clay targets thrown by a machines called "Traps".
** [[Skeet shooting|Skeet]]: Targets are either thrown in singles or doubles from two throwers called "traps" placed 40 meters apart.&lt;ref name ="topend"&gt;[http://www.topendsports.com/sport/shooting-sports.htm Topend Sports | About Shooting Sports]&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Trap shooting|Trap and Double Trap]]: Either one (trap) or two targets (double trap) are thrown from 15 meters in front of the shooter.&lt;ref name ="topend"/&gt;
* The [[Fédération Internationale de Tir aux Armes Sportives de Chasse]] (FITASC) [[Compak Sporting]] is a type of shotgun sport shooting similar to sporting clays, trap and skeet.
* Other shotgun sports with (at least partial) international recognition include [[Sporting Clays (shooting)|Sporting Clays]], [[Down-The-Line]]/ATA and [[Five stand]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Running target ===
[[Running target shooting]] refers to a number of disciplines involving a shooting target—sometimes called a [[boar]], [[moose]], or [[deer]]—that is made to move as if it is a running animal. Events of this type include:

* [[ISSF 10 meter running target]]
* [[ISSF 10 meter running target mixed]]
* [[ISSF 50 meter running target]]
* [[ISSF 50 meter running target mixed]]
* [[Running moose shooting|Running moose]], popular in Scandinavia both as a sport and hunting exercise. Competitions in Sweden are held at 80 meters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jagareforbundet.se/en/utbildning/jagarexamen/the-hunters-exam-huntsman-examination/swedish-hunting-examination/ "jagareforbundet.se"]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Running deer shooting|Running deer]], also somewhat popular in Scandinavia and Great Britain.

=== Practical shooting ===
[[Practical shooting]], also known as [[action shooting]] or [[dynamic shooting]], is a generic term applicable to shooting sports where speed is of equal importance as precision. Many of the disciplines involve movement, and when using handguns they are often drawn from a [[handgun holster|holster]].
* The [[International Practical Shooting Confederation]] (IPSC) is the oldest and largest sanctioning body within practical shooting. IPSC is sometimes considered the "Formula One" of shooting sports, and is shot with handguns, rifles and shotguns. While the [[United States Practical Shooting Association]] (USPSA) is the U.S. regional affiliate of IPSC, many of USPSA's rules differ slightly from those used internationally. IPSC was developed by former police and civilian marksmen and later used as a basis for modern military and police exercises. It is a variation where the shooter often moves during shooting, and hits scored and shooting time are equally important. Stage procedure is generally not dictated (freestyle) and the shooter is allowed to determine the order and manner in which he or she engages the targets.
* [[International Defensive Pistol Association]] (IDPA) is an action shooting sport that uses semi-automatic handguns and revolvers with a strong emphasis on concealed shooting. Many aspects of stage engagement are dictated to competitors and penalties are given to competitors whom the safety officer determines attempted to gain a competitive advantage or engaged in a forbidden action with a "guilty mind" - that he knowingly failed to do right.
* [[Multigun]] are practical shooting events where each of the stages generally require the competitor to use and transition between a combination of rifles, handguns, and/ or shotguns&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=DeJesus |first=Ivey |date=January 8, 2015 |title=A pistol, rifle and shotgun sport part of the lineup at NRA's Great American Outdoor Show |url=http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2015/01/nra_guns_great_american_outdoo.html |publisher=PA Media Group |location= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or other types of firearms. 3-Gun has a lot in common with ordinary IPSC/USPSA matches, having courses of fire where the shooter must move through different stages and engage targets in a variety of different positions.
* [[Steel Challenge]] is a speed shooting championship solely about shooting steel targets as fast as possible, and is governed by the Steel Challenge Shooting Association (SCSA). There are eight standardized courses of fire, and a special "stop plate" must be shot last to stop the timer.
* [[International Confederation of Revolver Enthusiasts]] (ICORE) is an international community which promotes action shooting competitions with revolvers. Founded in 1991, the sport has elements from the Bianchi Cup, IPSC, and the Steel Challenge.&lt;ref name="AboutICORE"&gt;[http://www.icore.org/About_ICORE.html ICORE History and Information]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[IPSC Action Air]] follows the same principle of [[International Practical Shooting Confederation|IPSC]], using [[airsoft]] instead of real firearms. The ranges, paper targets and poppers are scaled down to suit airsoft, and the sport enjoys popularity in countries such as [[Taiwan]], [[Hong Kong]], and [[Japan]] where civilian ownership of real firearms are either illegal or extremely difficult to obtain.
* [[Bowling pin shooting]] (primarily shot with handguns) has the competitors race against one another to knock standard bowling pins from a table in the shortest elapsed time.
* [[ActionAirgun]] is an indoor action shooting sport using semi-automatic airsoft pistols and courses of fire downloaded from a central hub. Shooters upload shooting times to a website to resolve competitions.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Long range ===
[[Long range shooting]] is a term used to describe shooting disciplines held at such distances that sight adjustment based from judging atmospherical conditions become critical.

* [[Fullbore target rifle|Fullbore target shooting]] is concerned with shooting at targets at ranges of 300–1200 yards. The sport is internationally governed by [[International Confederation of Fullbore Rifle Associations|ICFRA]], and is popular in the UK, USA, Germany and Commonwealth countries. Similar disciplines called bullseye and field shooting are popular in Scandinavia, although fired at shorter distances.
** [[Palma rifle|Palma]] is an ICFRA fullbore competition format that dates from 1876, featuring long-range rifle shooting, out to 1,000 yards. The first Palma match was contested by teams from the U.S., Australia, Canada, Scotland and Ireland (with muzzle loaded rifles at that time). The matches continued to the late 1920s, and the trophy was eventually lost in Washington DC around the outbreak of WW2. The match was revived in the modern era in 1966 in Canada, and continues between teams from around the world. The PALMA bolt action rifles are 7.62mm NATO caliber (Winchester .308) and fire Match Grade ammunition using a 155 grain bullet using micrometer aperature (iron) sights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=  Palma USA|url=http://www.palma.org/palma-basics |accessdate=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last two International Long-range Target Rifle Matches were held in Australia in 2011 and the U.S. in 2015, were won by Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;http://competitions.nra.org/documents/pdf/compete/nat-trophy/tro-090.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[F-Class (shooting sport)|F-Class]] is another ICFRA fullbore competition format shot with Fullbore Target Rifles at ranges up to 1000 yards, the rifles being fitted with telescopic sights and the use of fore-end and butt rests being permitted. This is a fast-growing variant of Fullbore Target Rifle. The 'F' honours George Farquharson, the Canadian inventor of F-Class.
*[[Precision Rifle Competition]]s, a relatively new long range competition format which seeks to find a balance between speed and precision, often involving movement and shooting from unusual positions with a time limit, at both known and unknown distances.
**National Rifle League (NRL) is a [[501(c)(3) organization|501(c)(3)]] [[non-profit organization]] dedicated to the growth and education of precision rifle shooting in the United States.  Their match format allows any caliber between .224 to .308 and not to exceed {{convert|3200|ft/s|m/s}}, involving at least 50 shooters with each firing minimum 140 rounds in at least 12 individual stages, over the course of at least two days.  Since its debut in 2017, currently 11 clubs from eight states are involved in the league.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nationalrifleleague.org/clubs/clubs_shooters/|title=Participating Clubs/Matches|publisher=National Rifle League}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**National Rifle League 22 (NRL22) is a sub-league under the National Rifle League dedicated to [[.22 Long Rifle]] [[Rimfire ammunition|rimfire]] rifles.  It was established to address the fact that most localities do not have access to 1000 yard ranges, but nearly all localities have 100-yard ranges and most shooters own .22 rifles.  Their championship match consist of minimum 170 rounds fired in at least 15 individual stages.  Currently 68 clubs from 31 states in the US participate in NRL22 matches, with addition to two overseas clubs from UK and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nrl22.org/clubs/|title=Clubs|publisher=NRL 22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* T-Class Shooting Sport Competitions. Practical sniping with precision rifle systems is a shooting sport, which gains tremendous popularity worldwide over a short period of time. It concentrates on shooting onto static or dynamic targets of various distances (known and unknown), from different positions, under artificially created, but realistic stressful circumstances. It proves to be extremely interesting both for implementation and observation, due to its demanding level of difficulty. [http://t-class.org The International T-Class Confederation] (ITCC) is a non-profit organization, which is founded in 2014 for the purpose of promotion of the T-Class shooting sport internationally, with headquarters residing in Bulgaria. It offers a Set of Rules for designing and managing T-Class Competitions.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Benchrest ===
[[Benchrest shooting]] is concerned with shooting small groups with the rifleman sitting on a chair (bench) and the rifle supported from a table. Of all shooting disciplines, this is the most demanding equipment-wise. Depending on equipment class, international benchrest competitions are governed by either the [[World Benchrest Shooting Federation]] or [[World Rimfire and Air Rifle Benchrest Federation]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Metallic silhouette ===
[[Metallic silhouette]] competitors shoot at animal-shaped steel silhouettes (chickens, pigs, turkeys and rams) that must be knocked down to score. Banks of 5 targets are placed at up to 500 meters, with distance and size of target determined by firearm class. Classes include Handguns, Small Bore Rifle (Hunter, Silhouette), High Power Rifle (Hunter, Silhouette), air rifle and black powder rifle. Handguns used in the Unlimited Categories are rifle-like in appearance; [[Thompson Contender]], [[Remington XP-100]], and other pistols are chambered in rifle calibers with the power, [[aerodynamic]] efficiency, and [[external ballistics]] required for precise shooting at 200 meters. There are silhouette categories appropriate for virtually all types of adjustable sight pistols and rifles, only excluding high-velocity armor-piercing rounds that would damage targets. Targets for open sighted guns are placed between 25 and 200 meters, and are designed to provide a usable size of the hit zone of about 1.5 [[milliradian]]s (or 5 [[minutes of arc]]).

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Western ===
* [[Cowboy action shooting]] (CAS), almost identical to USPSA and IDPA stage design but with Western cowboy themed props, shot with long guns and revolvers of the same era. Mere act of shooting itself is not enough. Competitors must choose and go by a cowboy nickname or alias and are required to look the part by donning authentic cowboy and cowgirl garments.
* [[Cowboy mounted shooting]], also called Western Mounted Shooting or simply Mounted Shooting, is a competitive equestrian sport involving the riding of a [[horse]] to negotiate a shooting pattern. Rule sets vary between shooting sport organizations, it can be based on the [[historical reenactment]] of historic shooting events held at [[Wild West Shows]] in the late 19th century. Modern events use [[blank ammunition]] instead of live rounds, certified to break a target balloon within twenty feet.&lt;ref name="Taffin2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Taffin|first=John|authorlink=John Taffin|title=Single Action Sixguns|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0vrK2zj7V3cC&amp;pg=PA299|date=28 September 2005|publisher=Krause Publications|location=Iola, Wisconsin|isbn=978-1-4402-2694-6|pages=299–300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Para shooting ===
[[Paralympic shooting]], also known as "shooting Para sport", is an adaptation of shooting sports for competitors with disabilities. Paralympic shooting first appeared in the [[Summer Paralympics]] at the [[1976 Summer Paralympics|1976 Toronto Games]]. Para shooting is internationally governed by the [[International Paralympic Committee]]. To help establish fair competition, a shooting classification called [[Para-shooting classification]] in place for the [[Paralympic Games]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Competitions using factory and service firearms ===
[[Shooting competitions for factory and service firearms]], usually called Service Rifle, Service Pistol, Production, Factory or Stock, describe a set of disciplines or equipment classes where the types of permitted firearms are subject to [[type approval]] and few aftermarket modifications are permitted. Thus the terms refer to permitted equipment and modifications rather than the type of shooting format itself. The names Service Rifle and Service Pistol stem from that the equipment permitted for these types of competitions traditionally were based on [[service rifle|standard issue]] firearms used by one or several armed forces and civilian versions of these, while the terms Production, Factory and Stock often are applied to more modern disciplines with similar restrictions on equipment classes. Factory and service classes are often ''restrictive'' in nature, and the types of firearms permitted are usually rugged, versatile and affordable. In comparison, more expensive custom competition equipment are popular in more ''permissive'' equipment classes. Both types of equipment classes can be found within many disciplines, such as [[bullseye shooting|bullseye]], [[field shooting|field]], [[practical shooting|practical]] and [[long range shooting]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Plinking ===
[[Plinking]] refers to informal [[target shooting]] done for pleasure or practice typically at non-standard targets such as [[tin can]]s, [[Log (wood)|log]]s, [[carton]]s, [[fruit]]s, or any other homemade or naturally occurring objects like rocks or tree branches. The primary appeals of plinking as a sport are the broad variety of easily available locations, minimal costs, freedom in practice styles, and more relaxing and less restrictive shooting experience.

The flexibility of target choice is also why plinking is popular. A small, three-dimensional target in an outdoors setting is much more akin to a real-world [[hunting]] and [[varminting]] scenario, presenting a better simulated opportunity to practice shooting skills. A plinking target will also often react much more positively to a hit than a [[shooting target#paper or electronic|paper target]] used in formal competitions, either audibly with a sharp impact sound (hence the name "plink") or visually by bouncing, splattering or falling over. [[Steel target]]s used for formal [[action shooting|action]] and [[long range shooting]] competitions are also popular for plinking due to the ease of setting up and confirming good hits.

== Bow shooting sports ==
=== Archery ===
[[Archery|Modern competitive archery]] involves shooting [[arrow]]s at a target for accuracy from a set distance or distances. A person who participates in archery is typically called an archer or a bowman, and a person who is fond of or an expert at archery is sometimes called a toxophilite. The most popular competitions worldwide are called [[target archery]]. Another form, particularly popular in Europe and America, is [[field archery]], which generally is shot at targets set at various distances in a wooded setting. There are also several other lesser-known and historical forms, as well as archery novelty games. Note that the tournament rules vary from organization to organization. [[World Archery Federation]] rules are often considered normative, but large non-WA-affiliated archery organizations do exist with different rules. Competitive archery in the United States is governed by USA Archery and National Field Archery Association (NFAA), which also certifies instructors. [[Run archery]] is a shooting discipline connecting archery with running.

=== Crossbow ===
{{main article|Match crossbow}}
The [[International Crossbow Shooting Union]] (''Internationale Armbrustschützen Union'' or IAU) was founded in [[Landshut]], [[Germany]] on June 24, 1956 as the world governing body for [[crossbow]] target shooting. The IAU supervises World, Continental and International crossbow shooting championships in 3 disciplines; 30 m Match-crossbow, 10 m Match-crossbow and Field-crossbow shooting. IAU World Championships take place every two years with Continental Championships on intervening years. Other International and IAU-Cup events take place annually.&lt;ref name="olympic.org"/&gt;

== Athletic shooting sports==
* [[Modern pentathlon]] is a [[Summer Olympic]] [[Olympic sport|sport]] includes timed shooting with an [[air pistol]] as the first of its five parts.
* [[Biathlon]] is a [[Winter Olympic]] sport combining [[cross-country skiing (sport)|cross-country skiing]] (normally freestyle skate skiing) and shooting with .22 LR rifles.&lt;ref name="olympic.org"/&gt; In Scandinavia the discipline is simply known as "Ski Shooting" (Swedish: ''skidskytte'', Danish: ''skiskydning'', Norwegian: ''skiskyting'').
* Summer biathlon, with skiing replaced by running, popular in [[Germany]].
* Ski Field Shooting (Norwegian: ''DFS skifeltskyting'') is a Norwegian discipline arranged by the [[National Rifle Association of Norway]] which is based on the origins of modern biathlon. It is normally held in a classic (in-track) format, but competitions can also be held in a freestyle skate skiing format. Furthermore, the shooting is done with fullbore calibers and usually in the field from temporary shooting ranges. The discipline is considered as a near precursor to modern biathlon.
* Field running (Norwegian: ''DFS skogsløp'') is a Norwegian discipline arranged by the [[National Rifle Association of Norway]] combining running with shooting. It is considered the summer edition of Ski Field Shooting. Running distances are usually between 2 and 3 kilometers with 2 to 3 shooting series.
* [[Target sprint]] combines medium-range run (3 × 400 m) and [[airgun]] shooting.
* [[Military patrol]] was a team [[winter sport]] in which athletes competed in cross-country skiing, [[ski mountaineering]] and [[rifle shooting]]. It was usually contested between countries or [[military unit]]s. 
* [[Underwater target shooting]] is a combined [[underwater sports|underwater]] and shooting sport that tests a competitors’ ability to accurately use a [[speargun]] via a set of individual and team events conducted in a [[swimming pool]] using [[free diving]] or Apnoea technique.

== Confrontational shooting sports ==
Confrontational shooting sports is a set of relatively new [[team sport]]s using non-lethal ranged weapons that are safe enough to shoot at other people. Previously such games were not possible due to safety concerns since bows and guns are generally too lethal and dangerous for human targets, but the development of newer [[airgun]] and [[infrared]] technologies allowed for the development of safe confrontational disciplines. While initially only for sport and recreations, professional sport competitions are now held. These type of games are also used for tactical [[gunfight]] training by military and law enforcement agencies to some extent.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

=== Paintball ===
[[Paintball]] is a competitive sport in which players from opposing teams eliminate opponents out of play by hitting them with round, breakable, [[dye]]-filled [[oil]] and [[gelatin]] pellets ("paintballs"), shot from gas-powered [[air gun|air weapon]]s called [[paintball marker]]s. It can be played on indoor or outdoor fields scattered with natural or artificial terrain, which players use for tactical [[cover (military)|cover]]. Paintball game types vary, but can include [[capture the flag]], elimination, ammunition limits, defending or attacking a particular point or area, or capturing objects of interest hidden in the playing area. Depending on the variant played, games can last from seconds to hours, or even days in scenario play. The game is developed in the 1980s and now is regularly played at a formal sporting level with organized competition involving major tournaments, professional teams and players.
* [[NXL|National Xball League]] is the [[United States]]' professional paintball circuit. The league consists of a Professional Division, consisting of the best players the sport has to offer, that extends down to the beginner ranks of "Division 5" for those newer to the tournament atmosphere. The league hosts five national events across the country in places such as [[Las Vegas]], [[Dallas]], [[Nashville]], [[Cleveland]], [[Chicago]], [[Atlantic City]] and [[Orlando]] throughout the year, starting in March and ending their season in early November. The league's largest event each year is the season finale known as the World Cup, with the 2016 World Cup hosted 3,554 players from 35 countries.
* [[NCPA (paintball)|National Collegiate Paintball Association]] is an all-volunteer, [[non-profit organization]] created by United States college players. The goal of the NCPA is to promote the positive aspects of the sport in an intercollegiate manner. The NCPA consists of two distinct classes which competes separately — Class AA is an open-class division where any college may enter and compete in regional and national tournaments. Class A is a closed-class division where only certain colleges may compete after securing a bid in the previous season, and represents the best talent of college paintball and includes universities such as [[Drexel University]], [[University of Maryland]], [[Illinois State University]], [[Purdue University]], [[University of Connecticut]], [[Penn State University]] and 10 other teams across three conferences all fighting for a national title. The association's 2007 playoff tournament was aired on [[Fox Sports Net]]'s digital cable college sports network, [[Fox College Sports]].

=== Airsoft ===
[[Airsoft]] is a competitive sport similar in concept to paintball, in which participants from opposing teams eliminate opponents by hitting each other with [[airsoft pellet|solid round plastic pellet]]s launched from low-powered [[smoothbore]] [[air gun]]s called [[airsoft gun]]s. It is different to paintball in that airsoft pellets do not visibly mark the targets like paintballs, and thus the sport relies heavily on an [[honor system]] where a hit player has the ethical duty to call himself out of play, regardless of whether anyone else sees it happen. Most airsoft guns are also magazine-fed (unlike the commonly top-mounting pellet loader of paintball markers) with mounting platforms compatible with real firearm accessories, and tend to more closely resemble real guns in appearance, making them more popular for [[MilSim|military simulation]] and [[historical reenactment]]s. The greater toughness of airsoft pellets also allows the use of better powerplants and apparatus such as [[hop-up (airsoft)|hop-up device]] for improved [[external ballistics]], making the gameplay more accurately resemble real gunfights. They are also much cheaper for casual players to participate than paintball.

Airsoft gameplay varies in style and composition just like paintball and is played in both indoor and outdoor courses. Situations on the field frequently involve the use of real-life [[military tactic]]s to achieve objectives, and it is not uncommon for participants to emulate the uniforms and equipment of real military and police organizations for a sense of realism. Games are normally supervised (and sometimes umpired) by trained on-site administrators, and players' airsoft guns are usually checked through a [[chronograph]] to enforce power output restrictions.

There are currently no formal national or international [[Sports governing body|governing bodies]] for the airsoft sport. Competitive tournaments are usually organized by private clubs or among enthusiasts and [[professional]]/[[semi-professional]] teams (often referred to as "clans"), with rules and restrictions varying from event to event.

=== Laser tag ===
[[Laser tag]] (despite the name, [[laser]] is actually not used due to [[laser safety|safety concern]]s) is a [[tag (game)|tag game]] played with gun-shaped [[infrared]] illuminators and sensors worn on the body of the players. Since its birth in 1979, laser tag has evolved in both indoor and outdoor games, each with gameplay styles such as annihilation, [[capture the flag]], domination, VIP protection, (usually [[sci-fi]]) [[role playing]], etc. When compared to [[paintball]] and [[airsoft]], laser tag is painless and very safe because it involves no [[projectile]] impacts, and indoor games may be considered less physically demanding because most indoor venues prohibit running or roughhousing.
* Zone Laser Tag World Championships were international tournaments among professional/semi-professional teams from North American, Europe and Australia, hosted every few years since 2003.
* Bi-lateral international championships have included USA vs. Australia and Australia vs. South Africa.
* National tournaments in various countries including Australia, USA, Sweden, Finland, UK, etc.
* Private club-level events such as TagCon (annual in UK and USA), Tagfest (annual in USA), Dropzone (annual in UK), LaserStorm (annual in Australia), etc.

=== Archery Tag ===
[[Archery Tag]] is a form of combat archery sport where participants shoot one another using a bow with arrows with large [[foam]] tips. The game's rules closely resemble [[dodgeball]]. The game begins with a number of arrows in the center of the arena. At the whistle, players race to collect them, before firing them at one another across the playing field. A player is eliminated if struck by an arrow, and a player can bring an eliminated teammate back into play by catching an arrow. To avoid injury, participants wear [[Mask#Protective|protective facemask]]s and use bows with less than {{convert|30|lb|kg}} draw weight. It was invented in 2011 by John Jackson of [[Ashley, Indiana]], and experienced a boost in popularity from the ''[[Hunger Games]]'' books and [[The Hunger Games (film series)|film series]], which feature a bow-wielding protagonist [[Katniss Everdeen]]. Jackson staged Archery Tag games at local premieres of the films. By 2014, Jackson had licensed the game to 170 locations, mostly in the [[United States]], but also in [[Russia]], [[Peru]] and [[Saudi Arabia]].

[[Battle gaming]] variants of Archery Tag also exist, such as [[Dagorhir]], [[Amtgard]], [[Belegarth]] and [[Darkon Wargaming Club|Darkon]], where archers are pitted among [[melee]] players welding [[foam weapon]]s to simulate [[medieval]] battles.

{{technical|date=October 2018}}
'''Standpoint theory''' is a theory for analyzing [[inter-subjective]] [[discourse]]s. This body of work concerns the ways that authority is rooted in individuals' knowledge (their [[perspective (cognitive)|perspective]]s), and the power that such authority exerts.

Standpoint theory's most important concept is that an individual's own perspectives are shaped by his or her social and political experiences. Standpoints are multifaceted rather than essentializing: while  Hispanic women may generally share some perspectives, particularly with regard to ethnicity or sex, they are not defined solely by their participation in these categories. The amalgamation of a person's many experienced dimensions form a standpoint—a [[point of view (philosophy)|point of view]]—through which that individual sees and understands the world.

Standpoint theorists emphasize the utility of a naturalistic''',''' or everyday experiential, concept of knowing (i.e., [[epistemology]]).  One's standpoint (whether reflexively considered or not)  shapes which concepts are intelligible, which claims are heard and understood by whom, which features of the world are perceptually salient, which reasons are understood to be relevant and forceful, and which conclusions credible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sprague|first=Joey|title=The standpoint of art/criticism|url=http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?vid=3&amp;hid=13&amp;sid=e26ca1ca-8c19-4976-ad8a-7d7af38f55a0%40sessionmgr15&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=aph&amp;AN=66905263}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Standpoint theory supports what feminist theorist [[Sandra Harding]] calls [[strong objectivity]], or the notion that the perspectives of [[marginalized]] and/or oppressed individuals can help to create more objective accounts of the world. Through the outsider-within phenomenon, these individuals are placed in a unique position to point to patterns of behavior that those immersed in the dominant group culture are unable to recognize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Allen|first=Brenda J.|title=Feminist Standpoint Theory: a Black Woman's Review of Organizational Socialization|journal=Communication Studies|year=1996|volume=47|issue=4|pages=257–271|doi=10.1080/10510979609368482}}&lt;/ref&gt; Standpoint theory gives voice to the marginalized groups by allowing them to challenge the status quo as the outsider within. The status quo representing the dominant white male position of privilege.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Buzzanell|first=Patrice M.|title=A Feminist Standpoint Analysis of Maternity and Maternity Leave for Women with Disabilities|journal=Women and Language|year=2003|volume=26|issue=2|pages=53–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The predominant culture in which all groups exist is not experienced in the same way by all persons or groups. The views of those who belong to groups with more social power are validated more than those in marginalized groups. Those in marginalized groups must learn to be [[bicultural]], or to "pass" in the [[dominant culture]] to survive, even though that perspective is not their own.&lt;ref name="DeFranciscoVictoria"&gt;DeFrancisco, Victoria P. ''Communicating Gender Diversity: A Critical Approach''. Thousand Oaks: Sage Publications, INC., 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The original inspirations for standpoint theory can be seen in the works of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], a [[German idealism|German idealist]] philosopher, who studied the different standpoints between slaves and masters in 1807.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, J.T. (2008). Critical feminist theories. In L.A. Baxter &amp; D.O. Braithwaite (Eds.), Engaging theories in interpersonal communication: Multiple perspectives (pp. 323-334). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed that the master-slave relationship is about people's belonging positions, and the groups affect how people receive knowledge and power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Griffin|first=Em|title=A First Look at COMMUNICATION THEORY: Standpoint Theory|year=2009|publisher=McGraw-Hill Higher Education|pages=441–453}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Marx]] also discussed how the position of a worker shapes his or her knowledge.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} From these two scholars' studies, Nancy Hartsock examined standpoint theory by using relations between men and women. She published "The Feminist Standpoint: Developing Ground for a Specifically Feminist Historical Materialism" in 1983. Hartsock used Hegel's ideas of masters and slaves and Marx's ideas of class and [[capitalism]] as an inspiration to look into matters of sex and gender.

Contemporary standpoint theory often focuses on the social positions such as gender, [[Race (classification of humans)|race]], class, [[culture]], and economic status.&lt;ref&gt;Wallance, R. A., and A. Wolf (1995). ''Contemporary Sociological Theory: Continuing the classical tradition''. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; Standpoint theory seeks to develop a particular [[feminist epistemology]], that values the experiences of women and minorities as a source for knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;McCann and Kim, ''Feminist Theory Reader: Local and global perspectives'', 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Prominent standpoint theorists include [[Dorothy E. Smith|Dorothy Smith]], [[Nancy Hartsock]], [[Donna Haraway]], [[Sandra Harding]], [[Alison Wylie]], Lynette Hunter and [[Patricia Hill Collins]].

==Key concepts==
Generally, standpoint theory gives insight into specific circumstances only available to the members of a certain collective standpoint. According to Michael Ryan, "the idea of a collective standpoint does not imply an essential overarching characteristic but rather a sense of belonging to a group bounded by a shared experience."&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Social Theory'', 789.&lt;/ref&gt;. Kristina Rolin states that "the assumption of essentialism is that all women share the same socially grounded perspective in virtue of being women, the assumption of automatic epistemic privilege is that epistemic advantage accrues to the subordinate automatically, just in virtue of their occupying a particular social position."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rolin|first=Kristina|date=2009|title=Standpoint Theory as a Methodology for the Study of Power Relations|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/20618192|journal=Hypatia|volume=24|issue=4|pages=218–226}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to this approach:
* A standpoint is a place from which [[human beings]] view the [[world]].
* A standpoint influences how the people adopting it [[social construct|socially construct]] the world.
* A standpoint is a mental position from which things are viewed.
* A standpoint is a position from which objects or principles are viewed and according to which they are compared and judged.
* The inequalities of different social groups create differences in their standpoints.
* All standpoints are partial; so (for example) [[Standpoint feminism]] coexists with other standpoints.

==Applications==

Since standpoint theory focuses on marginalized populations, it is often applied within fields that focus on these populations. Standpoint has been referenced as a concept that should be acknowledged and understood in the [[Social Work]] field, especially when approaching and assisting clients.&lt;ref&gt;Swigonski, M. E. (1993). "Feminist Standpoint Theory and the Questions of Social Work Research". ''Affilia'', 8(2), 171–183.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many marginalized populations rely on the welfare system to survive.  Unfortunately, those who structure the welfare system typically have never needed to utilize its services before.  Standpoint theory has been presented as a method to improving the [[welfare]] system by recognizing suggestions made by those within the welfare system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Edmonds-Cady | first1 = C | year = 2009 | title = Getting to the grassroots: Feminist standpoints within the welfare movement | url = | journal = Journal of Sociology and Social Welfare | volume = 36 | issue = 2| pages = 11–33 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Africa, standpoint theory has catalyzed a social movement where women are introduced to the radio in order to promote awareness of their experiences and hardships and to help these women heal and find closure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gatua | first1 = M. W. | last2 = Patton | first2 = T. O. | last3 = Brown | first3 = M. R. | year = 2010 | title = Giving voice to invisible women: "FIRE" as model of a successful women's community radio in Africa | url = | journal = Howard Journal of Communications | volume = 21 | issue = 2| pages = 164–181 | doi=10.1080/10646171003727441}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example dealing with Africa is slavery and how slavery differed greatly depending on if one was the slave or the master. If there were any power relationships there could never be a single perspective. No viewpoint could ever be complete, and there is no limit to anyone's perspective.

Asante and Davis’s (1989) study of interracial encounters in the workplace found that because of different cultural perspectives, approaching organizational interactions with others with different beliefs, assumptions, and meanings often leads to miscommunication. Brenda Allen stated in her research that, "Organizational members' experiences, attitudes, and behaviors in the workplace are often influenced by race-ethnicity"&lt;ref&gt;Allen, B. J. (1995). "'Diversity' and organizational communication". ''Journal of Applied Communication Research'', 23, 145.&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul Adler and John Jermier suggest that management scholars should be aware of their standpoints. They write that those studying management should "consciously choose [their] standpoints and take responsibility for the impact (or lack of impact) of [their] scholarship on the world"&lt;ref&gt;Adler, Paul, and John Jermier. 2005. "Developing a field with more soul: Standpoint theory and public policy research for management scholars". ''The Academy of Management Journal'' 48 (6): 942.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Jermier argued that all parts of a research study- identifying the problem, theorizing research questions, gathering and analyzing data, drawing conclusions, and the knowledge produced are there to some extent because of the researcher’s standpoint. This caused him to question what standpoint to adopt in the management of scientists. To avoid falling into limitations of the status quo and certain standpoints, he said that "the view from below has greater potential to generate more complete and more objective knowledge claims." He continues to say that, “if our desire is to heal the world, we will learn more about how the root mechanisms of the world work and about how things can be changed by adopting the standpoints of those people and other parts of nature that most deeply suffer its wounds.”&lt;ref&gt;Jermier, J.M. 1998. "Critical perspectives on organizational control". ''Administrative Science Quarterly'', 43: 235–256.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Standpoint feminism}}
Feminist standpoint theorists make three principal claims: (1) Knowledge is socially situated. (2) Marginalized groups are socially situated in ways that make it more possible for them to be aware of things and ask questions than it is for the non-marginalized.  (3) Research, particularly that focused on power relations, should begin with the lives of the marginalized.&lt;ref name=Bowell&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bowell|first1=T.|title=Feminist Standpoint Theory|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/fem-stan/|website=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Feminist standpoint theorists such as Dorothy Smith, Patricia Hill Collins, Nancy Hartsock, and Sandra Harding claimed that certain socio-political positions occupied by women (and by extension other groups who lack social and economic privilege) can become sites of epistemic privilege and thus productive starting points for enquiry into questions about not only those who are socially and politically marginalized, but also those who, by dint of social and political privilege, occupy the positions of oppressors. This claim was specifically generated by Sandra Harding and as such, "Starting off research from women's lives will generate less partial and distorted accounts not only of women's lives but also of men's lives and of the whole social order."&lt;ref name="Griffin_b"&gt;Griffin, E. M. (2009). ''A first look at communication theory'' (7th edn). New York, NY: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; This practice is also quite evident when women enter into professions that are considered to be male oriented. [[Londa Schiebinger]] states, "While women now study at prestigious universities at about the same rate as men, they are rarely invited to join the faculty at top universities...The sociologist [[Harriet Zuckerman]] has observed that 'the more prestigious the institution, the longer women wait to be promoted.' Men, generally speaking, face no such trade-off."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schiebinger|first=Londa|title=Has feminism changed science?|year=1999|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=United States of America|pages=33–53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Standpoint feminists have been concerned with these dualisms for two related reasons. First, dualisms usually imply a hierarchical relationship between the terms, elevating one and devaluing the other.&lt;ref name=WestTurner&gt;West, R., and H. L. Turner (2004). ''Communication Theory. Analysis and Application''.&lt;/ref&gt; He also said that when we suggest that decisions should be made rationally, not emotionally, for example, we are showing that reason holds a higher value in our culture than does emotion. Also, related to this issue is the concern that these dualisms often become gendered in our culture. In this process, men are associated with one extreme and women with the other. In the case of reason and emotion, women are identified with emotion. Because our culture values emotion less than reason, women suffer from this association. Feminist critics are usually concerned with the fact that dualisms force false dichotomies (partition of a whole) onto women and men, failing to see that life is less either/or than both/and, as [[relational dialectics theory]] holds.

==Criticisms==
Critics argue that standpoint theory, despite challenging essentialism, relies itself on essentialism, as it focuses on the dualism of subjectivity and objectivity.&lt;ref name=WestTurner /&gt; In regards to feminist standpoint theory: though it does dispel many false generalizations of women, it is argued that focus on social groups and social classes of women is still inherently essentialist. Generalizations across the entire female gender can be broken into smaller more specific groups pertaining to women's different social classes and cultures, but are still generalized as distinct groups, and thus marginalization still occurs. West and Turner stated that an author by the name of Catherine O'Leary (1997) argued that although standpoint theory has been helpful in reclaiming women's experiences as suitable research topics, it contains a problematic emphasis on the universality of this experience, at the expense of differences among women's experiences.&lt;ref name=WestTurner /&gt;

Another main criticism of Harding and Wood's standpoint theory is the credibility of strong objectivity vs. subjectivity. Standpoint theorists argue that standpoints are relative and cannot be evaluated by any absolute criteria, but make the assumption that the oppressed are less biased or more impartial than the privileged.&lt;ref name="Griffin_b" /&gt; This leaves open the possibility of an overbalance of power, in which the oppressed group intentionally or unintentionally becomes the oppressor. Intentional overbalance of power, or revenge, can manifest as justification for extremism and militarism, which can sometimes be seen in more extreme forms of feminism.

While the beginnings of standpoint theory are based on the critical paradigm from a Marxist view of social class oppression, a feminist philosophy developed in the 1970s and 1980s and the main focus has been on the feministic side. Other groups, as of now, need to be included into the theory and a new emphasis needs to be made toward other marginalized or muted groups. These groups envelop minorities, culturally different and the disabled or those that have a disability. When Harding and Wood conceived Standpoint theory they did not understand, when they defined it as a feminist view, that there are different cultures existing in the same social group. Many researchers are unsure of the idea of it having essentialism, as essentialism refers to the practice of generalizing all groups as though they were, in essence, the same.” Early standpoint theorists sought to understand the way in which the gendered identity of knowers affected their epistemic resources and capacities”&lt;ref name="Wylie" /&gt;{{rp|48}}. These other muted or marginalized groups have a more realistic approach to standpoint theory as they have different experiences than those that are in power and even within those muted groups differences defined by different cultures of people can have an altered standpoint. This view gives a basis that in part Standpoint Theory has a central principle of the inversion thesis and Joshua St. Pierre defined this as "the inversion thesis gives epistemic authority to those marginalized by systems of oppression insofar as these people are often better knowers than those who benefit from oppression. Put simply: social dispossession produces epistemic privilege."

Part of standpoint theory’s return to favor comes from a re-articulation of its methodology, aims, and limitations that directly answer the criticisms mentioned above.

Wylie has perhaps provided the most succinct articulation of second-wave standpoint theory. For her, a standpoint does not mark out a clearly defined territory such as “women” within which members have automatic privilege but is a rather a posture of epistemic engagement. Responding to the claim that the situated knowledge thesis reifies essentialism, Wylie thus argues that it is "an open (empirical) question whether such structures obtain in a given context, what form they take, and how they are internalized or embodied by individuals".&lt;ref name="Wylie" /&gt;{{rp|62}} Identities are complex and cannot be reduced to simple binaries. Likewise, she argues that the criticism of automatic privilege is falters insofar as a standpoint is never given, but is achieved. (St. Pierre)&lt;ref name="Wylie"&gt;Wylie, Alison. 2012. "Feminist Philosophy of Science: Standpoint Matters." Presidential Address delivered to the Pacific Division APA, in ''Proceedings and Addresses of the American Philosophical Association'', 86.2: 47–76.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''strategic lawsuit against public participation''' ('''SLAPP''') is a [[lawsuit]] that is intended to [[censorship|censor]], [[intimidate]], and silence critics by burdening them with the cost of a [[legal defense]] until they abandon their criticism or opposition.&lt;ref name="onthemedia_01"&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://www.onthemedia.org/2010/apr/02/slapp-back/transcript/
 |title=SLAPP Back: Transcript
 |date=April 2, 2010
 |website=[[On The Media]]
 |publisher=[[WNYC]] ([[National Public Radio]], [[PBS]])
 |first= Nazanin |last=Rafsanjani
 |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such lawsuits have been made illegal in many jurisdictions on the grounds that they impede [[freedom of speech]].

In the typical SLAPP, the [[plaintiff]] does not normally expect to win the lawsuit. The plaintiff's goals are accomplished if the [[defendant]] succumbs to fear, intimidation, mounting [[legal costs]], or simple exhaustion and abandons the criticism. In some cases, repeated frivolous litigation against a defendant may raise the cost of [[directors and officers liability insurance]] for that party, interfering with an organization's ability to operate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2013/05/16/whacked-by-lawsuit-costs-old-city-civic-association-disbands/ |first=John |last=McDevitt |title=Whacked By Lawsuit Costs, Old City Civic Association Disbands |website=KYW-TV, CBS |location=Philadelphia |date=May 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A SLAPP may also intimidate others from participating in the debate. A SLAPP is often preceded by a [[legal threat]].

There is a difficulty in that plaintiffs do not present themselves to the court admitting that their intent is to censor, intimidate, or silence their critics. Hence, the difficulty in drafting SLAPP legislation, and in applying it, is to craft an approach which affords an early termination to invalid abusive suits, without denying a legitimate day in court to valid [[good faith]] claims. Thus, anti-SLAPP laws target tactics used by SLAPP plaintiffs. Common anti-SLAPP laws include measures such as penalties for plaintiffs who file lawsuits ruled frivolous and special procedures where a defendant may ask a judge to consider that a lawsuit is a SLAPP (and usually subsequently dismiss the suit).

Anti-SLAPP laws occasionally come under criticism from those who believe that there should not be barriers to the [[right to petition]] for those who sincerely believe they have been wronged, regardless of ulterior motives. Nonetheless, anti-SLAPP laws are generally considered to have a favorable effect, and many lawyers have fought to enact stronger laws protecting against SLAPPs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://digitalcommons.lmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2214&amp;context=llr |title=California's Anti-Slapp Legislation: A Summary of and Commentary on Its Operation and Scope |first=Kathryn W. |last=Tate |journal=[[Loyola of Los Angeles Law Review]] |volume=33 |pages=801–886 |date=April 1, 2000 |accessdate=July 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==
SLAPPs take various forms. The most common used to be a civil suit for [[defamation]], which in the [[English common law]] tradition was a [[tort]]. The [[common law of libel]] dates to the early 17th century and, unlike most English law, is [[reverse onus]], meaning that once someone alleges a statement is libelous, the burden is on the defendant to prove that it is not. In England and Wales, the [[Defamation Act 2013]] removed most of the uses of defamation as a SLAPP by requiring the proof of special damage. Various abusive uses of this law including [[political libel]] (criticism of the political actions or views of others) have ceased to exist in most places, but persist in some jurisdictions (notably [[British Columbia]] and [[Ontario]]) where political views can be held as defamatory.

A common feature of SLAPPs is [[forum shopping]], wherein plaintiffs find courts that are more favourable towards the claims to be brought than the court in which the defendant (or sometimes plaintiffs) live.&lt;ref name=Sheldrick2014&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sheldrick |first1=Byron |title=Blocking Public Participation: The Use of Strategic Litigation to Silence Political Expression |date=2014 |publisher=Wilfrid Laurier University Press |isbn=978-1-55458-930-2 |page=50 |url=https://books.google.com?id=dbNlAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA50 |accessdate=November 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other widely mentioned elements of a SLAPP are the actual effectiveness at silencing critics, the timing of the suit, inclusion of extra or spurious defendants (such as relatives or hosts of legitimate defendants), inclusion of plaintiffs with no real claim (such as corporations that are affiliated with legitimate plaintiffs), making claims that are very difficult to disprove or rely on no written record, ambiguous or deliberately mangled wording that lets plaintiffs make spurious allegations without fear of [[perjury]], refusal to consider any settlement (or none other than cash), characterization of all offers to settle as insincere, extensive and unnecessary demands for [[discovery (law)|discovery]], attempts to identify [[anonymity|anonymous or pseudonymous]] critics, appeals on minor points of law, demands for broad rulings when appeal is accepted on such minor points of law, and attempts to run up defendants' costs even if this clearly costs more to the plaintiffs.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

Several jurisdictions have passed anti-SLAPP laws, designed to quickly remove cases out of court. In many cases, the plaintiff is also required to pay a penalty for bringing the case, known as a SLAPP-back.

== History ==
The [[acronym]] was coined in the 1980s by [[University of Denver]] professors [[Penelope Canan]] and [[George W. Pring]].&lt;ref name="pring_canan_01"&gt;{{cite book |title=SLAPPs: Getting Sued for Speaking Out |isbn=978-0-375-75258-2 |last=Pring |first=George W. |last2=Canan |first2=Penelope |publisher=Temple University Press |pages=8–9 |year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was originally defined as "a lawsuit involving communications made to influence a governmental action or outcome, which resulted in a civil complaint or counterclaim filed against nongovernment individuals or organizations on a substantive issue of some public interest or social significance." The concept's originators later dropped the notion that government contact had to be about a public issue to be protected by the [[Right to petition in the United States|Right to Petition]] the Government, as provided in the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]. It has since been defined less broadly by some states, and more broadly in one state (California) where it includes suits about speech on any public issue.&lt;ref name="ccp_425_16_01"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.casp.net/california-anti-slapp-first-amendment-law-resources/statutes/c-c-p-section-425-16 |title=(California) Code of Civil Procedure – Section 425.16 |publisher=California Anti-SLAPP Project |year=2009 |origyear=Ratified 1992, last amended 2009 |quote=The Legislature finds and declares that it is in the public interest to encourage continued participation in matters of public significance, and that this participation should not be chilled through abuse of the judicial process.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original conceptualization proffered by Canan and Pring emphasized the right to petition as protected in the United States under the US Constitution's specific protection in the First Amendment's fifth clause. It is still definitional: SLAPPs refer to civil lawsuits filed against those who have communicated to government officialdom (in its entire constitutional apparatus). The Right to Petition, granted by [[Edgar the Peaceful]], King of England in the 10th century, antedates the [[Magna Carta]] in terms of its significance in the development of democratic institutions. As currently conceived, the right claims that democracy cannot properly function in the presence of barriers between the governed and the governing.&lt;ref name="right_to_petition_01"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3486&amp;context=flr |journal=[[Fordham Law Review]] |volume=66 |issue=6 |date=January 1, 1998 |title=The Vestigial Constitution: The History and Significance of the Right to Petition |first=Gregory A. |last=Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kingsengland.co.uk/queen-mary-ii-of-stuart-1689%E2%80%931694.html |title=Queen Mary II of Stuart (1689–1694) |website=Kings of England |year=2010 |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morrone'', 590 N.Y.S.2d 649, 656 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1992).

== Jurisdictional variations ==

=== Australia ===
In the [[Australian Capital Territory]], the Protection of Public Participation Act 2008 protects conduct intended to influence public opinion or promote or further action in relation to an issue of public interest. A party starting or maintaining a proceeding against a defendant for an improper purpose may be ordered to pay a financial penalty to the Territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.act.gov.au/a/2008-48/20111212-50372/pdf/2008-48.pdf |title=Protection of Public Participation Act 2008 |website=Parliamentary Counsel's Office |location=Australian Capital Territory |date=12 December 2011 |accessdate=July 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canada ===
Some [[political libel]] and [[forum shopping]] incidents, both common in Canada, have been called SLAPPs, because such suits load defendants with costs of responding in unfamiliar jurisdictions or at times (typically elections) when they are extremely busy and short of funds. Both types of suits are unusual to Canada, so there is little academic concern nor examination of whether political subject matter or remote forums are a clear indicator of SLAPP.

==== British Columbia ====
One of the first cases in Canada to be explicitly ruled a SLAPP was ''Fraser v. Saanich'' (see [1999] B.C.J. No. 3100 (B.C. S.C.)) (QL), where the British Columbia Supreme Court struck out the claim of a hospital director against the District of Saanich, holding that it was a meritless action designed to silence or intimidate the residents who were opposed to the plaintiff's plan to redevelop the hospital facilities.

Following the decision in ''Fraser v. Saanich'', the ''Protection of Public Participation Act'' went into effect in British Columbia in April 2001. The legislation was repealed in August 2001. There was extensive debate on its merits and the necessity of having hard criteria for judges and whether this tended to reduce or increase process abuse. The debate was largely formed by the first case to discuss and apply the Protection of Public Participation Act (PPPA), ''Home Equity Development v. Crow''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.courts.gov.bc.ca/jdb-txt/sc/02/11/2002bcsc1138.htm |title=Home Equity Development v. Crow, et al (2002 BCSC 1138) |website=British Columbia Superior Courts |accessdate=May 23, 2015 |date=July 30, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The defendants' application to dismiss the action against them was dismissed. The defendants failed to meet the burden of proof required by the PPPA, that the plaintiffs had no reasonable prospect of success. While it was not the subject of the case, some felt that the plaintiffs did not bring their action for an improper purpose, and the suit did not inhibit the defendants in their public criticism of the particular project, and that the Act was therefore ineffective in this case.

Since the repeal, BC activists especially the [[BCCLA]] have argued repeatedly for a broad understanding of SLAPP and a broad interpretation of judicial powers especially in intervener applications in BC and other common law jurisdictions and when arguing for new legislation to prevent SLAPPs. The activist literature contains extensive research on particular cases and criteria. The [[West Coast Environmental Law]] organization agrees and generally considers BC to lag other jurisdictions.&lt;ref name="WCELJune2010"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wcel.org/resources/environmental-law-alert/bc-trails-quebec-ontario-protecting-public-chilling-lawsuits |title=BC trails Quebec, Ontario in protecting public from chilling lawsuits |date=June 6, 2010 |website=West Coast Environmental Law Association |accessdate=July 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Nova Scotia ====
A [[private member's bill]] introduced in 2001 by [[Graham Steele]] (NDP, [[Halifax Fairview]]) proposed a "Protection of Public Participation Act" to dismiss proceedings or claims brought or maintained for an improper purpose, awarding punitive or exemplary damages (effectively, a SLAPP back) and protection from liability for communication or conduct which constitutes public participation. The bill did not progress beyond first reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nslegislature.ca/legc/bills/58th_2nd/1st_read/b061.htm |title=Protection of Public Participation Act |website=Nova Scotia legislature |date=May 23, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ontario ====
In Ontario, the decision in ''Daishowa v. Friends of the Lubicon'' (see [1996] O.J. No. 3855 Ont. Ct. Gen. Div.) (QL) was also instructive on SLAPPs. A motion brought by the corporate plaintiff Daishowa to impose conditions on the defendant Friends of the Lubicon Indian Band that they would not represent Daishowa's action as a SLAPP was dismissed.

By 2010, the Ontario Attorney-General issued a major report which identified SLAPP as a major problem&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.attorneygeneral.jus.gov.on.ca/english/anti_slapp/ |title=Anti-SLAPP Advisory Panel |website=Ministry of the Attorney General |date=June 2013 |accessdate=January 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but initially little or nothing was done.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lawiscool.com/2011/10/06/renewing-the-debate-on-anti-slapp-legislation-in-ontario/ |title=Renewing the Debate on Anti-SLAPP Legislation in Ontario |website=Law is Cool |date=October 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2013, the Attorney General introduced legislation to implement the recommendations of the report; that bill was re-introduced after the [[Ontario general election, 2014|2014 election]]. {{asof|2014}}, Bill 83, the Protection of Public Participation Act (2014), has been referred to the Standing Committee on Social Policy and is not yet law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ontla.on.ca/web/bills/bills_detail.do?BillID=2810 |title=Bills &amp; Lawmaking – Current Parliament – Bill 83, Protection of Public Participation Act, 2014 |website=Legislative Assembly of Ontario |accessdate=January 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill proposes a mechanism for an order to dismiss strategic lawsuits which attack free expression on matters of public interest, with full costs (but not punitive damages) and on a relatively short timeframe, if the underlying claims have no reasonable prospect of success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rabble.ca/columnists/2014/08/protecting-public-debate-through-anti-slapp-legislation |title=Protecting public debate through anti-SLAPP legislation |first=Shelina |last=Ali |date=August 28, 2014 |website=[[rabble.ca]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2015, Ontario passed the Protection of Public Participation Act, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.ontario.ca/mag/en/2015/10/protection-of-public-participation-act.html |title=Protection of Public Participation Act |date=October 28, 2015 |website=Ministry of the Attorney General |accessdate=January 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Quebec ====
Québec's then Justice Minister, Jacques Dupuis, proposed an anti-SLAPP bill on June 13, 2008.&lt;ref name="ulcc_slapp_01"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ulcc.ca/en/poam2/SLAPP%20Report.pdf |title=Strategic Lawsuits against Public Participation (SLAPPs) (and other abusive lawsuits) |last=Pelletier |first=Vincent |website=Uniform Law Conference of Canada, Civil Section (English &amp; French) |date=August 2008 |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The bill was adopted by the [[National Assembly of Quebec]] on June 3, 2009. As of September 2013, Quebec's amended Code of Civil Procedure is the only anti-SLAPP mechanism in force in Canada.

This bill was invoked in Ontario (and then [[Supreme Court of Canada]] docket 33819) in the case of Les Éditions Écosociété Inc., [[Alain Deneault]], [[Delphine Abadie]] and [[William Sacher]] vs. [[Banro]] Inc., in which the publisher Écosociété pleaded (supported by the [[BCCLA]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bccla.org/othercontent/Ecosociete_BCCLA_argument.pdf |title=Les Editions Ecosociete Inc., Alain Deneault, Delphine Abadie and William Sacher v.

The court denied the request, ruling that the Ontario court did have jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Lexum-scc|2012|18}}&lt;/ref&gt; A separate 2011 decision in Quebec Superior Court had ruled that [[Barrick Gold]] had to pay $143,000 to the book's three authors and publisher, Les Éditions Écosociété Inc., to prepare their defence in a "seemingly abusive" strategic lawsuit against public participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cautbulletin.ca/en_article.asp?ArticleID=3342 |title=Noir Canada Defamation Lawsuit Settled, Publication of Book Stopped |website=Canadian Association of University Teachers Bulletin |accessdate=January 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the Québec ruling, a book ''Noir Canada'' documenting the relationship between Canadian mining corporations, armed conflict and political actors in Africa was never published as part of a settlement which, according to the authors, was only made for the sole purpose of resolving the three-and-a-half-year legal battle.

The Quebec law is substantially different in structure than that of California&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.citmedialaw.org/legal-guide/anti-slapp-law-california |title=Anti-SLAPP Law in California |website=Digital Media Law Project |accessdate=January 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; or other jurisdictions, however as Quebec's Constitution generally subordinates itself to [[international law]], the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] applies. That treaty only permits liability for arbitrary and unlawful speech. The ICCPR has also been cited, in the BC case Crookes v. Newton, as the standard for balancing free speech versus reputation rights. The Supreme Court of Canada in October 2011, ruling in that case, neither reiterated nor rescinded that standard.

There is no federal anti-SLAPP law, but legislation for one has been previously introduced such as the [[SPEAK FREE Act of 2015]].

It has been argued that the lack of uniform protection against SLAPPs has encouraged [[forum shopping]]; proponents of federal legislation have argued that the uncertainty about one's level of protection has likely magnified the [[chilling effect]] of SLAPPs.&lt;ref name=PPP&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.anti-slapp.org/slappdash-faqs-about-slapps/ |title=FAQS about SLAPPS |website=Public Participation Project |accessdate=June 26, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160403051530/http://www.anti-slapp.org/slappdash-faqs-about-slapps |archivedate=April 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2009, Rep. [[Steve Cohen]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]–Tennessee) introduced the Citizen Participation Act in the U.S. House.&lt;ref name="cohen_hr_4364"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-h4364/text |title=H.R.4364 – Citizen Participation Act of 2009 (As introduced in House Dec. 16, 2009) |website=Open Congress for the 112th United States Congress |publisher=Participatory Politics Foundation and Sunlight Foundation |accessdate=June 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This marks the first time the Congress has considered federal anti-SLAPP legislation, though the Congress enacted the [[SPEECH Act]] on the closely related issue of ''[[libel tourism]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Obama Signs Libel Tourism Law |first=Andrew |last=Albanese |date=August 12, 2010 |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publisher-news/article/44148-obama-signs-libel-tourism-law.html |magazine=[[Publishers Weekly]] |accessdate=June 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like many state anti-SLAPP laws, H.R. 4364 would allow the defendant of a SLAPP to have the suit quickly dismissed and to recover fees and costs.

==== California ====
California has a unique variant of anti-SLAPP legislation. In 1992 California enacted Code of Civil Procedure §&amp;nbsp;425.16, a [[statute]] intended to frustrate SLAPPs by providing a quick and inexpensive defense.&lt;ref name ="ccp_425_16_01" /&gt; It provides for a special motion that a [[defendant]] can file at the outset of a lawsuit to strike a [[complaint]] when it arises from conduct that falls within the rights of [[petition]] or [[free speech]]. The statute expressly applies to any writing or speech made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a legislative, executive, or judicial proceeding, or any other official proceeding authorized by law, but there is no requirement that the writing or speech be promulgated directly to the official body. It also applies to speech in a public forum about an issue of public interest and to any other petition or speech conduct about an issue of public interest.

To win on an anti-SLAPP (special motion to strike) motion, the defendant in the alleged SLAPP action must first show that the lawsuit is based on claims related to [[United States Constitution|constitutionally protected activities]], typically [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights such as [[free speech]], and typically seeks to show that the claim lacks any basis of genuine substance, legal underpinnings, evidence, or prospect of success. If this is demonstrated then the [[legal burden|burden]] shifts to the plaintiff to affirmatively present evidence demonstrating a reasonable probability of succeeding in their case by showing an actual wrong would exist as recognized by law, if the facts claimed were borne out.

The filing of an anti-SLAPP motion stays all [[Discovery (law)|discovery]]. This feature acts to greatly reduce the cost of litigation to the anti-SLAPP defendant, and can make beating the motion extremely difficult for the plaintiff, because they effectively must prove their case has at least a basis of visible legal merit and is not merely [[vexatious]], prior to discovery.

If the special motion is denied, the order denying the motion is immediately appealable. Defendants prevailing on an anti-SLAPP motion (including any subsequent appeal) are entitled to a mandatory award of reasonable attorney's fees. After an anti-SLAPP motion has been filed, a plaintiff cannot escape this mandatory fee award by amending its complaint. More than 300 published court opinions have interpreted and applied California's anti-SLAPP law.&lt;ref name="casp_cases_california_01"&gt;{{cite web

==== Washington State ====
In May 2015, the Washington Supreme Court struck down the state’s 2010 anti-SLAPP statute.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=e34a54bc-3ce7-4e0c-b714-9a4db8e59ae3&lt;/ref&gt;

== Balancing the right of access to the courts ==
The SLAPP penalty stands as a barrier to access to the courts by providing an early penalty to claimants who seek judicial redress. In recent years, the courts in some states have recognized that enforcement of SLAPP legislation must recognize and balance the constitutional rights of both litigants. It has been said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Since [[Magna Carta]], the world has recognized the importance of justice in a free society. "To no one will we sell, to no one will we refuse or delay, right or justice." (Magna Carta, 1215.) This nation's founding fathers knew people would never consent to be governed and surrender their right to decide disputes by force, unless government offered a just forum for resolving those disputes.&lt;ref name="social_contract_from_hobbes_to_rawls_01"&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The right to bring grievances to the courts, in good faith, is protected by state and federal constitutions in a variety of ways. In most states, the right to trial by jury in civil cases is recognized. The right to cross-examine witnesses is considered fundamental to the American judicial system. Moreover, the first amendment protects the right to petition the government for a redress of grievances. The "right to petition extends to all departments of the Government. The right of access to the courts is indeed but one aspect of the right of petition."&lt;ref name="california_motor_transport_v_trucking_unlimited"&gt;{{cite web

Because "the right to petition is 'among the most precious of the liberties safeguarded by the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]],' ... the right of access to the courts shares this 'preferred place' in [the United States'] hierarchy of constitutional freedoms and values."&lt;ref name="harrison_v_springdale_water_and_sewer"&gt;{{cite web

In ''Palazzo v. Alves'', the Supreme Court of Rhode Island stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;By the nature of their subject matter, anti-SLAPP statutes require meticulous drafting. On the one hand, it is desirable to seek to shield citizens from improper intimidation when exercising their constitutional right to be heard with respect to issues of public concern. On the other hand, it is important that such statutes be limited in scope lest the constitutional right of access to the courts (whether by private figures, public figures, or public officials) be improperly thwarted. There is a genuine double-edged challenge to those who legislate in this area.&lt;ref name="palazzo_v_ives_944_a2d_144"&gt;{{cite web

The most challenging balancing problem arises in application to SLAPP claims which do not sound (give rise to a claim) in [[tort]]. The [[common law]] and [[constitutional law]] have developed in the United States to create a high substantive burden to tort and tort-like claims which seek redress for [[public speech]], especially public speech which addresses matters of public concern. The common law in many states requires the pleader to state accurately the content of [[libel]]ous words. Constitutional law has provided substantive protection which bars recovery against a first amendment defense except upon clear and convincing evidence that there has been deliberate or reckless falsehood. For this reason, ferreting out the [[bad faith]] SLAPP claim at an early stage of litigation should be accomplished with relative ease. Extension of the SLAPP penalties to factually complex cases, where the substantive standard of proof at common law is lower presents special challenges.

A Minnesota Supreme Court case, ''Middle-Snake-Tamarac Rivers Watershed Dist. v. Stengrim'', 784 N.W.2d 834 (Minn. 2010) establishes a two-step process to determine whether SLAPP procedure should be applied. The decision arises in the context of an effort to enforce a settlement agreement between a local government and an opponent of a flood control project. The landowner had accepted a significant monetary settlement in settlement of his opposition to land acquisition. The landowner agreed as part of the settlement to address no further challenges to the project. When the local government sued the landowner for breach of settlement, the landowner contended that enforcement of the settlement was a strategic lawsuit against public participation. The Supreme Court rejected that claim and affirmed the District Court's denial of SLAPP relief, holding "The District Court properly denied a motion to dismiss where the underlying claim involved an alleged breach of a settlement agreement that potentially limited the moving party's rights to public participation." The Supreme Court explained:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Preexisting legal relationships, such as those based on a settlement agreement where a party waives certain rights, may legitimately limit a party’s public participation. It would be illogical to read sections 554.01-.05 as providing presumptive immunity to actions that a moving party may have contractually agreed to forgo or limit.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Under the Minnesota approach, as a preliminary matter, the moving party must meet the burden of showing that the circumstances which bring the case within the purview of SLAPP protection exists. Until that has been accomplished, no clear and convincing burden has been shifted to the responding party.

* Morris vs Johnson et al. October 22, 2012 ONSC 5824 (CanLII): During the final weeks of the 2010 municipal election in Aurora, Ontario a group town councilors and the incumbent Mayor agreed to use town funds in order to launch what was later referenced as a private lawsuit fronted by the Mayor, seeking $6M, against both named and anonymous residents who were critical of the local government. After the mayor and a number of councilors lost the election the new town council cut public funding for the private lawsuit and they issued a formal apology to the defendants. Almost one year after the town cut funding and after Morris lost a Norwich motion, Morris discontinued her case. The discontinuance cost decision delivered by Master Hawkins reads, per para. 32 (Ontario Superior court of Justice court file no.10-CV-412021): "Because I regard this action as SLAPP litigation designed to stifle debate about Mayor Morris' fitness for office, commenced during her re-election campaign, I award Johnson and Hogg special enhanced costs as was done in Scory v. Krannitz 2011 BCSC 1344 per Bruce J. at para. 31 (B.C.S.C)." Morris subsequently sued the town for $250,000 in the spring of 2013 in order to recover her legal costs for the period after the town cut funding of her case. Almost one and a half years after the final ruling in the Morris defamation case (i.e. the second Master Hawkins cost ruling delivered in January 2013) and approximately one year after suing the town, Morris amended her statement of claim to note that her legal costs were actually $27,821.46 and not the $250,000 as noted in the initial statement of claim. Morris then attempted to move the case to small claims court after the town had already spent over $150,000 in preparing its defense. As of the summer of 2015 the case is ongoing.

=== Estonia ===
In 2016, the real-estate investment company Pro Kapital Ltd sued urbanist Teele Pehk who expressed her opinion about the company's development plans in Kalasadam area in [[Tallinn]], Estonia. The accusations were based on an interview given for the article "The battle for the Estonian coastline", published by the monthly newspaper ''[[The Baltic Times]]''. Initially, instead of clarifying the questionable quotes in the article with the ''Baltic Times''{{'}} editors, Pro Kapital sent a legal demand to Pehk demanding that she publish a pre-written explanation and pay €500 to cover their legal advice expenses. Pehk provided proof to the lawyer that she had not lied to the journalist of ''The Baltic Times'', and the newspaper published a clarification online that Pehk's words were misinterpreted. Few months later Pro Kapital sued Pehk for damaging their reputation by spreading lies about the detailed plan of the Kalasadam area. Teele Pehk had been involved with the detailed plan of Kalasadam since 2011, as a member of the neighbourhood association Telliskivi selts and caretaker of the Kalarand beach, situated on the edge of Kalasadam area.

Half a year into the court case, Pro Kapital began negotiations and settled with a compromise before the court hearing. Pro Kapital paid for Pehk's legal costs and both parties agreed not to disparage each other in the future. Teele Pehk is still active in Tallinn urban development and continues to spread the word about SLAPP.

This first SLAPP case in Estonia took place at the end of the 12-year process of planning the Kalasadam area, which over the years had witnessed exceptionally high public interest regarding the planned residential development and most importantly, the public use of the seaside and the beach. The planning system in Estonia allows anyone to express their opinion, present suggestions or objections to any detailed plan. Many Estonian civic organisations were raising concerned voices about the case and the Chancellor for Justice of Estonia condemned that practice many times in public appearances.

In 2006, [[Oricon]] Inc., Japan's music chart provider, sued freelance journalist Hiro Ugaya due to his suggesting in an article for business and culture magazine ''[[Cyzo]]'' that the company was fiddling its statistics to benefit certain management companies and labels, specifically [[Johnny and Associates]].

He was found guilty in 2008 by the [[Tokyo District Court]] and ordered to pay one million [[Japanese yen|yen]], but he appealed and won. Oricon did not appeal later. His 33-month struggle against Oricon and his research on SLAPPs through his self-expense trip in the United States was featured on the [[Tokyo Broadcasting System|TBS]] program [[Japan News Network|''JNN'']] ''Reportage'', titled as "Legal Intimidation Against Free Speech: What is SLAPP?"&lt;ref&gt;"JNN Reportage – Legal Intimidation Against Free Speech: What is SLAPP?"

=== Norway ===

In 2018, [[Lovdata]], a foundation which publishes judicial information, sued two people amongst the volunteers in the [[rettspraksis.no]] project. Up until 2008, Lovdata was considered a government agency and had unlimited access to the supreme court servers. Based on this access, Lovdata has established a [[de facto]] monopoly on Norwegian supreme court rulings. When rettspraksis.no published supreme court decisions, Lovdata sued [[Håkon Wium Lie]] and [[Fredrik Ljone]], two of the volunteers. Although court decisions are not protected by copyright in Norway, Lovdata claimed that rettspraksis.no had used advanced crawlers to copy Lovdata's database. In less than 24 hours, Lovdata was able to close the rettspraksis.no site and the judge also ordered the volunteers to pay Lovdata's legal fees. Also, rettspraksis.no was not allowed to appear in court to explain that their source for the legal decision is a CD deposited in the National Library by Lovdata itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

* In an effort to prevent four women from filing any Public Records Requests without first getting permission from a judge, or from filing future lawsuits, the Congress Elementary School District filed the lawsuit [[Congress Elementary School District v. Warren, et. al.]] on January 28, 2010. [[The Goldwater Institute]], a think tank based in [[Phoenix, Arizona]], represented the four defendants. The school district said that it has been harassed so often by Warren that it was not able to functionally educate its students. Toni Wayas, the school district's superintendent, claimed "that it had, time and time again, complied with the requests" The Goldwater Institute argued that the school district had been in violation of state laws mandating government transparency in the past. Investigations in 2002 and 2007 by the state Ombudsman and Attorney General uncovered violations of the state's open meeting law by the Attorney General's Office. According to Carrie Ann Sitren of the Goldwater Institute, this was "a clear attempt to silence people in the community who have been critical of the board's actions, and have made good-faith attempts to ensure the district is spending taxpayer money wisely." None of the records requested were private or confidential, and thus, should have been readily available to be released to the public, according to the assistant state Ombudsman.&lt;ref name="congress_school_district_v_warren"&gt;{{cite news

'''''The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity: Twelve Lectures''''' ({{lang-de|Der Philosophische Diskurs der Moderne: Zwölf Vorlesungen}}) is a 1985 book by [[Jürgen Habermas]], in which the author reconstructs and deals in depth with a number of philosophical approaches to the critique of modern [[reason]] and the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] "project" since [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], including the work of 20th century philosophers [[Max Horkheimer]], [[Theodor Adorno]], [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Michel Foucault]], [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Cornelius Castoriadis]] and [[Niklas Luhmann]]. The work is regarded as an important contribution to [[Frankfurt School|Frankfurt School critical theory]]. It has been characterized as a critical (largely negative) evaluation of the concept of [[world disclosure]] in modern philosophy.&lt;ref name="Kompridis" /&gt;

An English translation by [[Frederick G. Lawrence]] was published in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;See [https://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=inauthor:%22J%3Frgen+Habermas%22The+Philosophical+Discourse+of+Modernity%22%22Frederick+G.+Lawrence%22 occurrences] on [[Google Books]].&lt;/ref&gt;  A French translation by Christian Bouchindhomme and Rainer Rochlitz was published in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;Jürgen Habermas, ''Le Discours philosophique de la modernité : Douze conférences'' (Paris: Gallimard, 1988).  {{ISBN|978-2-07-074632-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==

Habermas presents an outline of the “cultural self-understanding of modernity” as it emerged in Europe during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and attempts to retrieve the “historical context of Western rationalism” in which modernity or modernization (more narrowly conceived in terms of social and economic transformation)&lt;ref&gt;Habermas summarizes this transformation in the following way: “…the concept of modernization refers to a bundle of processes that are cumulative and mutually reinforcing: to the formation of [[Capital (economics)|capital]]… the development of the [[forces of production]]… the establishment of a centralized state power and the formation of national identities; to the proliferation of rights of political participation, of urban forms of life, and of formal schooling; to the [[secularization]] of values and norms.” ''Philosophical Discourse'', 2.&lt;/ref&gt; was originally understood as both a process of [[disenchantment]] and [[Social alienation|alienation]] ''as well as'' the “historical objectification of rational structures.”&lt;ref&gt;Habermas, Jurgen, ''The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity''. Tr. by Frederick Lawrence. Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press, 1987. 2&lt;/ref&gt; This presentation prepares the ground for the larger argument of the book, namely, that by losing sight of the “cultural impulse of modernity,” and abandoning the project of modernity as a whole, European intellectuals on both ends of the political spectrum have ignored the emancipatory dimension of the European [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], and thereby have renounced the only means of developing a consistent and [[immanent critique]] of modernity itself.

Modernity is defined by Habermas as a set of problems related to the issue of time, problems produced by the transformation of European society in accordance with what Hegel called the “principle of [[subjectivity]],” the notion of individual autonomy as the essence of man.&lt;ref&gt;‘In modernity… religious life, state, and society as well as science, morality, and art are transformed into just so many embodiments of the principle of subjectivity.” ''Philosophical Discourse'', 18.&lt;/ref&gt; This freedom from all forms of external [[authority]], which includes [[nature]] as well as [[tradition]], means that the subject “has to create its normativity out of itself;”&lt;ref&gt;Habermas, ''Philosophical Discourse'', 7&lt;/ref&gt; because it is free, it cannot accept any value or law that it does not recognize as its own. Subjectivity, in other words, is defined by “the right to criticism: the principle of the modern world requires that what anyone is to recognize shall reveal itself to him as something entitled to recognition."&lt;ref&gt;Habermas, ''Philosophical Discourse'',17&lt;/ref&gt; Insofar as the subject wills only those laws that recognizes as rational, laws which are “self-proscribed and self-obligated,” the subject wills only itself, or, in Hegel terms, it “wills the Will:” “The [[Will (philosophy)|Will]] is Free only when it does not will anything alien, extrinsic, foreign to itself (as long as it does so, it is dependent), but wills itself alone&amp;nbsp;– wills the Will. This is the absolute Will&amp;nbsp;– the volition to be free.”&lt;ref&gt;G.W.F Hegel, ''The Philosophy of History'', trans. J. Sibree, Buffalo: Prometheus Books. 1991, 442.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Habermas, Nietzsche undertakes a critique of “subject-centered reason,” of modern forms of knowledge and [[ethics]], from a standpoint that only appears to be “[[genealogical]],” that is, situated, historically, outside of modernity and Enlightenment thinking in an archaic, Dionysian era of myth, prior to the formation of modern subjectivity in the renunciation of instinct or “life.” He sees Nietzsche’s argument that all moral and cognitive claims (along with the rational subject) are the historical products of a power forced inward by its inability to discharge itself not as being based on a genealogy of modernity, but rather as a critique of the modern cognitive and practical subject from the perspective of an equally modern [[aesthetics]] (which Nietzsche “transposes,” according to Habermas, “into the archaic”), elevating the “judgment of taste of the art critic into a model for value judgment.” Nietzsche's critique of subject, in other words, is based on a modern aesthetic experience&amp;nbsp;– in particular, the “painful de-differentiation, a de-delimitation of the individual, a merging with amorphous nature within and without”&amp;nbsp;– which presupposes the modern subject itself. What appears, then, in Nietzsche as the historical “other” reason is in fact a version of [[Kantian aesthetics]] shorn of any claim of intersubjective validity.

[[File:Signing of the EOA.jpg|thumb|280px|President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] signs the Poverty Bill (also known as the Economic Opportunity Act) while press and supporters of the bill look on, August 20, 1964]]
The '''War on Poverty''' is the unofficial name for legislation first introduced by [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] during his [[State of the Union address]] on Wednesday, January 8, 1964. This legislation was proposed by Johnson in response to a national [[poverty]] rate of around nineteen percent.  The speech led the [[United States Congress]] to pass the [[Economic Opportunity Act]], which established the [[Office of Economic Opportunity]] (OEO) to administer the local application of federal funds targeted against poverty.

As a part of the [[Great Society]], Johnson believed in expanding the federal government's roles in education and health care as [[poverty reduction]] strategies.&lt;ref&gt;These justifications and aspects of the war on poverty are discussed in Weisbrod, Burton, ed. ''The Economics of Poverty: An American Paradox'', Prentice-Hall, 1965&lt;/ref&gt;  These policies can also be seen as a continuation of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]], which ran from 1933 to 1937, and the [[Four Freedoms]] of 1941. Johnson stated, "Our aim is not only to relieve the symptom of poverty, but to cure it and, above all, to prevent it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rector|first1=Robert|last2=Sheffield|first2=Rachel|title=The War on Poverty After 50 Years|url=http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2014/09/the-war-on-poverty-after-50-years|accessdate=May 13, 2015|publisher=The Heritage Foundation|date=September 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legacy of the War on Poverty policy initiative remains in the continued existence of such federal programs as [[Head Start (education)|Head Start]], [[Volunteers in Service to America]] (VISTA), [[TRIO (program)|TRiO]], and [[Job Corps]].

Deregulation, growing criticism of the [[welfare state]], and an ideological shift to reducing federal aid to impoverished people in the 1980s and 1990s culminated in the [[Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act]] of 1996, which President [[Bill Clinton]] claimed, "ended welfare as we know it."

==Major initiatives==
* [[The Economic Opportunity Act of 1964]] which created the [[Community Action Program]], [[Job Corps]] and [[AmeriCorps VISTA|Volunteers in Service to America (VISTA)]], centerpiece of the "war on poverty" – August 20, 1964
* [[Food Stamp Act of 1964]] – August 31, 1964&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/rules/Legislation/about.htm|title=A Short History of SNAP – Food and Nutrition Service|website=usda.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Elementary and Secondary Education Act]] – April 11, 1965
* [[Social Security Amendments of 1965|Social Security Act 1965]] (Created Medicare and Medicaid) – July 19, 1965

The [[Office of Economic Opportunity]] was the agency responsible for administering most of the War on Poverty programs created during Johnson's Administration, including [[Volunteers in Service to America|VISTA]], [[Job Corps]], [[Head Start Program|Head Start]], [[legal aid|Legal Services]] and the [[Community Action Program]]. The OEO was established in 1964 and quickly became a target of both left-wing and right-wing critics of the War on Poverty. Directors of the OEO included [[Sargent Shriver]], [[Bertrand Harding]], and [[Donald Rumsfeld]].

The OEO launched Project Head Start as an eight-week summer program in 1965.  The project was designed to help end poverty by providing preschool children from low-income families with a program that would meet emotional, social, health, nutritional, and psychological needs.  Head Start was then transferred to the [[Office of Child Development]] in the [[United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare|Department of Health, Education, and Welfare]] (later the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services]]) by the [[Richard Nixon|Nixon Administration]] in 1969.

President Johnson also announced a second project to follow children from the Head Start program. This was implemented in 1967 with [[Project Follow Through]], the largest educational experiment ever conducted.&lt;ref&gt;Maloney, M. (1998). Teach Your Children Well. Cambridge, MA: Cambridge Center for Behavioral Studies.&lt;/ref&gt;

The policy trains disadvantaged and at-risk youth and has provided more than 2 million disadvantaged young people with the integrated academic, vocational, and social skills training they need to gain independence and get quality, long-term jobs or further their education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fattah.house.gov/national-job-resources/|title=Congressman Chaka Fattah: National Job Resources |website=house.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Job Corps continues to help 70,000 youths annually at 122 Job Corps centers throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.new-corp.org/Partners/partnerships.html|title=Partnerships – Partners|website=new-corp.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Besides vocational training, many Job Corps also offer [[GED]] programs as well as [[high school]] diplomas and programs to get students into [[college]].

[[File:Number in Poverty and Poverty Rate 1959 to 2011. United States..PNG|thumb|400px|Number in Poverty and Poverty Rate: 1959 to 2015. United States.]]
In the decade following the 1964 introduction of the war on poverty, poverty rates in the U.S. dropped to their lowest level since comprehensive records began in 1958: from  17.3% in the year the Economic Opportunity Act was implemented to 11.1% in 1973. They have remained between 11 and 15.2% ever since.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.census.gov/prod/2010pubs/p60-238.pdf Table B-1 page 56]&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note, however, that the steep decline in poverty rates began in 1959, 5 years before the introduction of the war on poverty (see figure 4 below).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/hhes/www/poverty/data/historical/people.html|title=Poverty|website=census.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 'absolute poverty line' is the threshold below which families or individuals are considered to be lacking the resources to meet the basic needs for healthy living; having insufficient income to provide the food, shelter and clothing needed to preserve health. Poverty among Americans between ages 18–64 has fallen only marginally since 1966, from 10.5% then to 10.1% today. Poverty has significantly fallen among Americans under 18 years old from 23% in 1964 down to less than 17%, although it has risen again to 20% in 2009.&lt;ref name="Data Across States"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://datacenter.kidscount.org/data/acrossstates/Trend.aspx?order=a&amp;loc=1&amp;ind=43&amp;dtm=322&amp;tf=11%2c12%2c13%2c14%2c15%2c16%2c17%2c18%2c35%2c38 |title=Children in poverty – Data Across States |publisher=KIDS COUNT Data Center, [[Annie E. Casey Foundation]] |location=Baltimore |date=September 2011 |accessdate=August 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most dramatic decrease in poverty was among Americans over 65, which fell from 28.5% in 1966 to 10.1% today.

In 2004, more than 35.9 million, or 12% of Americans including 12.1 million children, were considered to be living in poverty with an average growth of almost 1 million per year. According to the [[Cato Institute]], a libertarian think tank, since the Johnson Administration, almost $15 trillion has been spent on welfare, with poverty rates being about the same as during the Johnson Administration.&lt;ref name="Matt Cover"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://cnsnews.com/news/article/study-more-half-trillion-dollars-spent-welfare-poverty-levels-unaffected |title=Study: More Than Half a Trillion Dollars Spent on Welfare But Poverty Levels Unaffected |first=Matt |last=Cover |website=[[Cybercast News Service|CNSNews.com]] |publisher=[[Media Research Center]] |location=Alexandria, VA |date=June 25, 2012 |accessdate=August 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2013 study published by [[Columbia University]] asserts that without the [[social safety net]], the poverty rate would have been 29% for 2012, instead of 16%.&lt;ref&gt;Zachary A. Goldfarb (December 9, 2013). [https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/study-us-poverty-rate-decreased-over-past-half-century-thanks-to-safety-net-programs/2013/12/09/9322c834-60f3-11e3-94ad-004fefa61ee6_story.html Study: U.S. poverty rate decreased over past half-century thanks to safety-net programs]. ''[[The Washington Post]]''. Retrieved January 15, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[OECD]] data from 2012, the poverty rate before taxes and [[Transfer payment|transfers]] was 28.3%, while the poverty rate after taxes and transfers fell to 17.4%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.compareyourcountry.org/inequality?cr=usa&amp;cr1=oecd&amp;lg=en&amp;page=1 Compare your country: Income distribution and poverty]. [[OECD]]. Retrieved January 18, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The OEO was dismantled by President Nixon in 1973, though many of the agency's programs were transferred to other government agencies.

According to the ''Readers' Companion to U.S. Women's History'',

&lt;blockquote&gt;Many observers point out that the War on Poverty's attention to Black America created the grounds for the backlash that began in the 1970s. The perception by the white middle class that it was footing the bill for ever-increasing services to the poor led to diminished support for welfare state programs, especially those that targeted specific groups and neighborhoods. Many whites viewed Great Society programs as supporting the economic and social needs of low-income urban minorities; they lost sympathy, especially as the economy declined during the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Mankiller"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Mankiller|editor1-first=Wilma|editor2-last=Mink|editor2-first=Gwendolyn|editor3-last=Navarro|editor3-first=Marysa|editor4-last=Smith|editor4-first=Barbara|editor5-last=Steinem|editor5-first=Gloria|title=The Reader's Companion to U.S. Women's History|url=http://www.credoreference.com/entry/5867648/|accessdate=6 May 2009|year=1998|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|location=Boston, MA|isbn=9780395671733|page=720|chapter=Great Society/War on Poverty}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[United States Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare]] under President [[Jimmy Carter]], [[Joseph A. Califano, Jr.]] wrote in 1999 in an issue of the ''[[Washington Monthly]]'' that:&lt;ref name="Califano"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/1999/9910.califano.html |title=What Was Really Great About The Great Society: The truth behind the conservative myths |first=Joseph A., Jr. |last=Califano |website=[[Washington Monthly]] |date=October 1999 |accessdate=May 21, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140326175845/http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/1999/9910.califano.html |archivedate=March 26, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In waging the war on poverty, congressional opposition was too strong to pass an income maintenance law. So LBJ took advantage of the biggest automatic cash machine around: Social Security. He proposed, and Congress enacted, whopping increases in the minimum benefits that lifted some two million Americans 65 and older above the poverty line. In 1996, thanks to those increased minimum benefits, Social Security lifted 12 million senior citizens above the poverty line&amp;nbsp;... No Great Society undertaking has been subjected to more withering conservative attacks than the Office of Economic Opportunity. Yet, the War on Poverty was founded on the most conservative principle: Put the power in the local community, not in Washington; give people at the grassroots the ability to stand tall on their own two feet. Conservative claims that the OEO poverty programs were nothing but a waste of money are preposterous&amp;nbsp;... Eleven of the 12 programs that OEO launched in the mid-'60s are alive, well and funded at an annual rate exceeding $10 billion; apparently legislators believe they're still working.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Reception and critique==
{{See also|Criticisms of welfare}}

President Johnson's "War on Poverty" speech was delivered at a time of recovery (the poverty level had fallen from 22.4% in 1959 to 19% in 1964 when the War on Poverty was announced) and it was viewed by critics as an effort to get the United States Congress to authorize [[social welfare]] programs.&lt;ref name="NASWDC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.naswdc.org/pubs/news/2011/01/poverty-imperative.asp |title=Social Work's Poverty Imperative|website=NASWDC |first=Elizabeth J.|last=Clark|date=January 2011|accessdate=May 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some economists, including [[Milton Friedman]], have argued that Johnson's policies actually had a negative impact on the economy because of their interventionist nature, noting in a [[PBS]] interview that "the government sets out to eliminate poverty, it has a war on poverty, so-called "poverty" increases. It has a welfare program, and the welfare program leads to an expansion of problems. A general attitude develops that government isn't a very efficient way of doing things."&lt;ref name="Friedman"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/fmc/interviews/friedman.htm |title=First Measured Century: Interview: Milton Friedman |publisher=[[PBS]] |first=Milton |last=Friedman |date=August 9, 2002 |accessdate=May 21, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020808213817/http://www.pbs.org/fmc/interviews/friedman.htm |archivedate=August 8, 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Adherents of this school of thought recommend that the best way to fight poverty is not through government spending but through economic growth.&lt;ref name="Yale"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.law.yale.edu/documents/pdf/Priest_poverty_inequality_and_economic_growth_simple_principles.pdf|title=Poverty, Inequality and Economic Growth: Simple Principles|publisher=[[Yale University]] |first=George L.|last=Priest|date=April 11, 2013 |accessdate=May 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FEE2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fee.org/the_freeman/detail/does-welfare-diminish-poverty#axzz2TxBdA4VP|title=Does Welfare Diminish Poverty? |website=Foundation for Economic Freedom |first=Howard|last=Baetjer Jr.|date=April 2003 |accessdate=May 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Yoo"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spectacle.org/0403/loo.html|title=Libertarianism and Poverty |website=The Ethical Spectacle |first=Dennis |last=Loo |date=April 2003 |accessdate=May 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prof. [[Tony Judt]], the late historian, said in reference to the earlier proposed title of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act that "a more Orwellian title would be hard to conceive" and attributed the decline in the popularity of the [[Great Society]] as a policy to its success, as fewer people feared hunger, sickness, and ignorance. Additionally, fewer people were concerned with ensuring a minimum standard for all citizens and [[social liberalism]].&lt;ref name="Tony Judt"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2009/dec/17/what-is-living-and-what-is-dead-in-social-democrac/?pagination=false |title=What Is Living and What Is Dead in Social Democracy? |website=[[The New York Review of Books]] |location=New York |first=Tony |last=Judt |authorlink=Tony Judt |date=December 17, 2009 |accessdate=August 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Conservative]] Research Fellow at [[the Independent Institute]] James L. Payne followed this line of thinking when he wrote that "the war on poverty was a costly, tragic mistake [because]...abolishing poverty did not seem far-fetched to the activists&amp;nbsp;... [and] it was a perspective that led to intolerance&amp;nbsp;... The simple economic theory of poverty led to a single underlying principle for welfare programs&amp;nbsp;... In adopting the handout approach for their programs, the war-on-poverty activists failed to notice&amp;nbsp;– or failed to care&amp;nbsp;– that they were ignoring over a century of theory and experience in the social welfare field&amp;nbsp;... The war-on-poverty activists not only ignored the lessons of the past on the subject of handouts; they also ignored their own experience with the poor."&lt;ref name="FEE"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fee.org/the_freeman/detail/why-the-war-on-poverty-failed#axzz2TxBdA4VP |title=Why the War on Poverty Failed Handouts Provide the Wrong Incentives|publisher=[[Foundation for Economic Education]] |first=James L.|last=Payne |date=January 1, 1999 |accessdate=May 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economist [[Thomas Sowell]] also criticized the War on Poverty's programs, writing "The black family, which had survived centuries of slavery and discrimination, began rapidly disintegrating in the liberal welfare state that subsidized unwed pregnancy and changed welfare from an emergency rescue to a way of life."&lt;ref name=Sowell&gt;[https://townhall.com/columnists/thomassowell/2004/08/17/a-painful-anniversary-n1190382 A painful anniversary]. [[Thomas Sowell]], Townhall.com, 17 August 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Others took a different tack. In 1967, in his book ''[[Where Do We Go from Here: Chaos or Community?]]'' [[Martin Luther King]] "criticized Johnson's War on Poverty for being too piecemeal", saying that  programs created under the "war on poverty" such as "housing programs, job training and family counseling" all had "a fatal disadvantage [because] the programs have never proceeded on a coordinated basis...[and noted that] at no time has a total, coordinated and fully adequate program been conceived."&lt;ref name="The Nation"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thenation.com/article/dr-martin-luther-kings-economics-through-jobs-freedom |title=Dr. Martin Luther King's Economics: Through Jobs, Freedom |website=[[The Nation]] |first=Mark |last=Engler |date=January 15, 2010 |accessdate=May 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his speech on April 4, 1967 at Riverside Church in New City, King connected the war in Vietnam with the "war on poverty":

&lt;blockquote&gt;There is at the outset a very obvious and almost facile connection between the war in Vietnam and the struggle I, and others, have been waging in America. A few years ago there was a shining moment in that struggle. It seemed as if there was a real promise of hope for the poor&amp;nbsp;–both black and white&amp;nbsp;– through the poverty program. There were experiments, hopes, new beginnings. Then came the buildup in Vietnam and I watched the program broken and eviscerated as if it were some idle political plaything of a society gone mad on war, and I knew that America would never invest the necessary funds or energies in rehabilitation of its poor so long as adventures like Vietnam continued to draw men and skills and money like some demonic destructive suction tube. So I was increasingly compelled to see the war as an enemy of the poor and to attack it as such. Perhaps the more tragic recognition of reality took place when it became clear to me that the war was doing far more than devastating the hopes of the poor at home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Rev. Martin Luther King |title=Beyond Vietnam: A Time to Break Silence |url=http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/45a/058.html|website=hartford-hwp.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This criticism was repeated in his speech at the same place later that month when he said that "and you may not know it, my friends, but it is estimated that we spend $500,000 to kill each enemy soldier, while we spend only fifty-three dollars for each person classified as poor, and much of that fifty-three dollars goes for salaries to people that are not poor. So I was increasingly compelled to see the war as an enemy of the poor, and attack it as such."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/pacificaviet/riversidetranscript.html|title=Social Activism Sound Recording Project |publisher=berkeley.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next year, King started the [[Poor People's Campaign]] to address the shortcomings of the "war on poverty" and to "demand a check" for suffering African-Americans which was carried on briefly after his death with the construction and maintenance of an encampment, Resurrection City, for over six weeks.&lt;ref name="PBS"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/race/ |title=The Two Nations of Black America|publisher=[[PBS]] |first=Henry Louis|last=Gates |date=February 10, 1998 |accessdate=May 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Years later, a writer in ''The Nation'' remarked that "the war on poverty has too often been a war on the poor themselves," but that much can be done.&lt;ref name="MHP"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thenation.com/blog/172054/what-real-war-poverty-looks|title=What a Real 'War on Poverty' Looks Like|website=[[The Nation]] |first=James|last=Cersonsky |date=January 3, 2013 |accessdate=May 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, the former executive officer of the Task Force on Poverty Hyman Bookbinder addressed such criticisms of the "war on poverty" in an op-ed in ''The New York Times''. He wrote that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Today, the ranks of the poor are again swelling&amp;nbsp;... These and other statistics have led careless observers to conclude that the war on poverty failed. No, it has achieved many good results. Society has failed. It tired of the war too soon, gave it inadequate resources and did not open up new fronts as required. Large-scale homelessness, an explosion of teen-age pregnancies and single-parent households, rampant illiteracy, drugs and crime – these have been both the results of and causes of persistent poverty. While it is thus inappropriate to celebrate an anniversary of the war on poverty, it is important to point up some of the big gains&amp;nbsp;... Did every program of the 60's work? Was every dollar used to its maximum potential? Should every Great Society program be reinstated or increased? Of course not&amp;nbsp;... First, we cannot afford not to resume the war. One way or another, the problem will remain expensive. Somehow, we will provide for the survival needs of the poorest: welfare, food stamps, beds and roofs for the homeless, Medicaid. The fewer poor there are, the fewer the relief problems. Getting people out of poverty is the most cost-effective public investment."&lt;ref name="task force"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/20/opinion/did-the-war-on-poverty-fail.html|title=Did the War on Poverty Fail?|work=[[The New York Times]] |first=Hyman|last=Bookbinder|date=August 20, 1989|accessdate=May 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In March 3, 2014, as Chairman of the Budget Committee of the House of Representatives, [[Paul Ryan]] released his "[[The War on Poverty: 50 Years Later]]" report, asserting that some of 92 federal programs designed to help lower-income Americans have not provided the relief intended and that there is little evidence that these efforts have been successful.&lt;ref name="WOPReportDocument"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://budget.house.gov/waronpoverty/|title=The War on Poverty: 50 Years Later|publisher=Budget Committee of the House of Representatives|accessdate=March 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the core of the report are recommendations to enact cuts to welfare, child care, college Pell grants and several other federal assistance programs.&lt;ref name="WOP_report"&gt;{{cite news|last=Mascaro|first=Lisa|title=Rep.

For conservatives, this suggests that federal programs have actually decreased poverty. For liberals, it lessens the supposed need to expand existing programs or to create new ones."&lt;ref name="WOPReportDocument"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WOP_report"/&gt; Several economists and social scientists whose work had been referenced in the report said that Ryan either misunderstood or misrepresented their research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/03/04/Economists-Say-Paul-Ryan-Misrepresented-Their-Research |title=Economists Say Paul Ryan Misrepresented Their Research |last1=Garver |first1=Rob |date=March 4, 2014 |website=The Fiscal Times |accessdate=March 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Washtub-bass-Kianti-Ecolove.png|180px|thumb|A small washtub bass being played]]
The '''washtub bass''', or '''gutbucket''', is a stringed instrument used in [[American folk music]] that uses a metal washtub as a resonator.  Although it is possible for a washtub bass to have four or more strings and [[tuning peg]]s, traditional washtub basses have a single string whose pitch is adjusted by pushing or pulling on a staff or stick to change the tension.

The washtub bass was used in [[jug band]]s that were popular in some [[African American]] communities in the early 1900s. In the 1950s, [[UK|British]] [[Skiffle music|skiffle]] bands used a variant called a [[tea chest bass]], and during the 1960s, US folk musicians used the washtub bass in jug band-influenced music.

Variations on the basic design are found around the world, particularly in the choice of resonator.  As a result, there are many different names for the instrument including the "gas-tank bass", "barrel bass", "box bass" (Trinidad), "bush bass" (Australia), "babatoni" ([[South Africa]]), "[[tingotalango]]" (Cuba), "[[:it:bidofono|tulòn]]" (Italy), "laundrophone" and others.

The hallmarks of the traditional design are simplicity, very low cost and do-it-yourself construction, leading to its historical association with lower economic classes. These factors also make it quite common for modern-day builders to promote modifications to the basic design, such as adding a [[finger board]], pedal, [[electronic pickup]], [[drumhead]], or making the staff immovable.

==History==
[[Image:ElectricInbindiBass.jpg|180px|thumb|left|Electric "inbindi" bass which is amplified by a public address system]]
[[Ethnomusicologist]]s trace the origins of the instrument to the [[Ground bow|'ground bow' or 'ground harp']] - a version that uses a piece of bark or an animal skin stretched over a pit as a resonator.  The ''ang-bindi'' made by the [[Baka people (Congo and Sudan)|Baka people]] of the Congo is but one example of this instrument found among tribal societies in Africa and Southeast Asia, and it lends its name to the generic term ''inbindi'' for all related instruments.  Evolution of design, including the use of more portable resonators, has led to many variations, such as the ''[[dan bau]]'' (Vietnam) and ''[[Ektara|gopichand]]'' (India), and more recently, the "electric one-string", which amplifies the sound using a pickup.

The washtub bass is sometimes used in a [[jug band]], often accompanied by a [[washboard (musical instrument)|washboard]] as a [[percussion instrument]].  Jug bands, first known as "spasm bands", were popular especially among African-Americans around 1900 in New Orleans and reached a height of popularity between 1925 and 1935 in Memphis and Louisville.

At about the same time, European-Americans of Appalachia were using the instrument in "old-timey" folk music. A musical style known as "gut-bucket blues" came out of the jug band scene, and was cited by [[Sam Phillips]] of [[Sun Records]] as the type of music he was seeking when he first recorded [[Elvis Presley]].

According to [[Willie "The Lion" Smith]]'s autobiography, the term "gutbucket" comes from "Negro families" who all owned their own pail, or bucket, and would get it filled with the makings for [[chitterlings]]. The term "gutbucket" came from playing a lowdown style of music.&lt;ref name="Music on My Mind"&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith|first=Willie the Lion|title=Music on My Mind: The Memoirs of an American Pianist, Foreword by Duke Ellington|year=1964|page=11|publisher=Doubleday &amp; Company Inc. |location=New York City|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In English [[Skiffle music|skiffle]] bands, [[Australia]]n and [[New Zealand]] [[bush band]]s and [[South Africa]]n [[kwela]] bands, the same sort of bass has a [[tea-chest bass|tea chest]] as a resonator.  [[The Quarrymen]], [[John Lennon]] and [[Paul McCartney]]'s band before [[the Beatles]], featured a tea-chest bass, as did many young bands around 1956.

A folk music revival in the U.S. in the early 1960s re-ignited interest in the washtub bass and jug band music.  Bands included [[Mother McCree's Uptown Jug Champions (album)|Mother McCree's Uptown Jug Champions]], which later became The [[Grateful Dead]], and the Jim Kweskin Jug Band, which featured [[Fritz Richmond]] on bass.

==Tea chest bass==
[[Image:Rhoener Saeuwaentzt Guenther.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Tea chest bass]]
A '''tea chest bass''' is a variation of the washtub bass that uses a [[tea chest]] as the resonator for an upright stringed [[bass (instrument)|bass]].  The instrument is made from a pole, traditionally a broomstick, placed into or alongside the chest. One or more strings are stretched along the pole and plucked.

In Europe, particularly England and Germany, the instrument is associated with [[skiffle]] bands. In Australia it was traditionally used to provide deep sounds for "[[bush band]]s", though most such groups today use [[electric bass]] or [[double bass]]. It was commonly called a "bush bass".

==Other variations==
Other variations on the basic design are found around the world, particularly in the choice of resonator, for example:
* "gas-tank bass"
* "barrel bass"
* "box bass" ([[Trinidad]])
* "bush bass" ([[Australia]])
* "babatoni" ([[South Africa]])
* "dumdum" ([[Zimbabwe]])
* "dan bau" ([[Vietnam]])
* "sanduku" ([[Zanzibar]])
* "tingotalango" ([[Cuba]])
* "[[:it:bidofono|tulòn]]" ([[Italy]])
