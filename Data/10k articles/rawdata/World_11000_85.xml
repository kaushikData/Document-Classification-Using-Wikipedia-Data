      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1317">The '''Abbey of San Caprasio in Aulla''' is a church, formerly part of a monastery, in [[Aulla]], region of [[Tuscany]], Italy. The monastery was established by the [[Benedictine order]] as a hostel on the pilgrimage route to Rome, and originally titled Santa Maria, in 1077 it was dedicated to [[San Caprasio]], the patron of the town and a patron saint of pilgrims.

Documents cite the founding of the abbey within a fortification held by Adalberto I, Marquis of Tuscany.  It later was linked to the [[Malaspina family]] and also contested by the Vescovi Conti of [[Luni, Italy|Luni]]. The abbey was powerful by the early 13th-century, owning various parishes and land in the area. The church was reconstructed in 1070 into the present layout, but has undergone many reconstructions over the centuries. It now serves as a museum and a hostel affiliated with the local parish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sancaprasio.it/home.html San Caprasio] official site.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Angola Telecom''' is a [[telecommunications]] and [[Internet service provider]] of [[Angola]]. Angola Telecom is an ''empresa publica'', i.e. wholly owned by the Angolan state.

[[Subsidiaries]] of Angola Telecom include: 
*'''Infrasat''', offering satellite telecommunications services.
*'''Angola Cables''', offering international access for data and voice.
*'''TVCabo''', offering broad band cable service for television and radio broadcasting.
*'''Multitel''', a portal offering a wide range of internet services.
*'''ELTA''', Empresa de Listas Telefonicas de Angola, an online [[telephone directory]].
*'''Movicel''', offering mobile telecommunications services.

Angola Telecom created the [[mobile phone]] provider [[Movicel]] as subsidiary, but holds since 2010 only a minority part of the shares of Movicel.

In 2010 Angola Telecom began a program of restructuring led by a team of international consultants. In 2014, Bloomberg reported that the company was on track to produce its first net profit in over 8 years. However, the economic collapse fueled by the devaluation of crude oil has likely erased any gains achieved thus far.  *[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-02-19/angola-telecom-targets-2015-profit-after-state-answers-911-call.html/ Bloomberg Article]

'''Apodoulou''' ({{lang-el|Αποδούλου}}) is the archaeological site of an ancient [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] mansion or ceremonial building.

==Geography==
Apodoulou overlooks the [[Libyan Sea]].

Altitude: 450m above sea level

==Archaeology==
Apodoulou was first excavated by [[Spyridon Marinatos]] in 1934.

The area was inhabited from Late [[Neolithic]] times to the [[Minoan pottery|Late Minoan]] period, and the building was in use in the [[Minoan pottery|Middle Minoan III]] period.  The site has yielded [[Linear A]] inscriptions on a basin and fragments of a stone cylindrical jar, as well as a small golden axe.

400m north of Apodoulou is a Late Minoan vaulted tomb.  Four sarcophagus were found here and are on exhibit at the [[Archaeological Museum of Rethymno]].

'''BVN''' (''Het beste van Vlaanderen en Nederland'',  "The best of Flanders and the Netherlands"), is a [[satellite television|satellite]] and [[cable television]] channel providing [[Netherlands|Dutch]] and [[Flanders|Flemish]] [[public television|public-service television]] to viewers around the world.

It is a joint venture by the public broadcasting company of the Netherlands, [[Netherlands Public Broadcasting|Nederlandse Publieke Omroep]] (NPO); and that of the Flemish part of Belgium, the [[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroep]] (VRT).

BVN has grown to become a major international channel with worldwide coverage.

==History==
The channel started in 1996 as '''Zomer-TV''' (Summer-TV), an operation aimed at making Dutch-language programming available to Dutch and Flemish holidaymakers abroad.

All of its programming originally came from the Netherlands (the abbreviation BVN at first standing for ''het Beste Van Nederland'', "the best of the Netherlands") but this was later adapted, once the [[Flemish Region]] of Belgium began contributing both financially and with output from the schedules of VRT,  to ''het Beste van Vlaanderen en Nederland'': "the best of Flanders and the Netherlands".

[[Radio Nederland Wereldomroep]] (RNW) was involved as a founding partner, but left in 2012.

In March 2007 BVN changed its scheduling from three 8-hour programming blocks to two 12-hour blocks: this provided more room for the inclusion in the schedules of such popular shows as [[De Wereld Draait Door]] (VARA)

==Access==
There are three main access methods: 
* ''Satellite'' - A range of [[Satellite television|satellites]] carry BVN, often as a [[free-to-air]] channel. User need to be within the "footprint" of a satellite that carries the channel, and have a suitable dish and receiver.
* ''Cable'' - [[Cable television]] providers in many places have BVN as one of the available channels
* ''Internet'' - The BVN service is now also available worldwide as a [[Streaming media|streaming service]] [http://www.bvn.tv/bvnlive "BVNLIVE"] over the Internet ([[geo-blocking|except from IP addresses]] in the Netherlands and Belgium)

==Programming==
All programmes are replayed during the second 12-hour block, running from 0100 to 1300 CET daily.

===News and current affairs===
BVN broadcasts daily news bulletins from [[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroeporganisatie|VRT]] and [[Nederlandse Omroep Stichting|NOS]]. The 1pm and 7pm editions of VRT's ''Het Journaal'' are transmitted on a short time delay at 1300 and 1905 [[Central European Time|CET]] from Sunday to Friday. The 1900 bulletin is broadcast from 1915 on Saturdays. The main 2000 bulletin from ''[[NOS Journaal]]'' is broadcast at 2030 CET and features a specially produced international weather forecast (''BVN-Weer''). A short bulletin is also carried at 1600 CET on weekdays and at 1605 on weekends.

Current affairs output on weekdays consists of the magazine programme ''[[EénVandaag]]'' (One Today) at 1830 CET, ''Nieuwsuur'' (Newshour, which incorporates an NOS Journaal bulletin) and ''Terzake'' (To The Point) at around midnight CET. ''EénVandaag'' is produced by independent pillar broadcasters ([[AVROTROS]]) while ''Nieuwsuur'' is co-produced by NOS and the NTR. ''Terzake'' is produced by VRT.

On Sundays, BVN carries a delayed broadcast of VRT's current affairs magazine ''De Zevende Dag'' (The Seventh Day) at 1330 CET followed by the political talk show ''[[Buitenhof (TV series)|Buitenhof]]'' at 1530.

Topical debate and entertainment programmes also feature in the schedule including ''De wereld draait door'' (The World Keeps Turning) at 1940 CET and ''Pauw'' or ''Jinek'' at around 2350 CET. Both programmes are off-air during the Summer and are produced by BNN-VARA subsidiary [[Omroepvereniging VARA|VARA]].

===Sport===
NOS produces 15 minutes sports news bulletins called ''Sportjournaal'' on weekdays along with ''Studio Sport'', a longer sports news and highlights programme on Saturday nights. The sports magazine show ''Holland Sport'' is broadcast periodically on Saturday afternoons. During the football season, [[Eredivisie]] highlights are broadcast in NOS's ''Studio Sport'' on Saturday nights &amp; Sunday evenings.

VRT's sports coverage is featured daily within short sports bulletins on ''Het Journaal'' at 1300 and 1900. On Sundays throughout the year, the 1910 ''Het Journaal'' bulletin is shortened to 20 minutes to allow for a half-hour round-up entitled ''Sportweekend'' to follow at 1930. During the football season, the 1300 bulletin on Sunday features an extended goals round-up from the [[Belgian First Division A|Jupiler League]] (Belgian First Division).

===Children===
BVN features a daily block of children's programming, consisting of new and archived programming from various pillar broadcasters in the Netherlands, [[Omroep NTR|NTR]], the [[Netherlands Public Broadcasting|NPO]] children's television stations [[Z@PP|Z@pp]] as well [[Z@ppelin]]  and the VRT children's television station, [[Ketnet]].

Dedicated news and current affairs output for children is also broadcast at weekends, including a weekly current affairs programme ''Schooltv-weekjournaal'', on Saturdays and a news review, ''NOS Jeugdjournaal Overzicht'' (NOS Youth Journal Overview), on Sundays.

===Features and entertainment===
BVN's daily schedule features entertainment, documentaries and features output.

Programming includes documentary series ''Spoorloos'' (Without a Trace), the quiz show ''Blokken'' (Blocks) and the long running sitcom ''Thuis'' (Home) as well as various music specials.

===Drama===
BVN broadcasts a number of popular drama series and serials including ''Klem'' (Stuck) and ''Flikken Rotterdam'' (Rotterdam Cops).

During the summer, BVN transmits movies from the Netherlands and Flanders on Saturday nights.

'''Bill Mack''' (born June 4, 1932  in [[Shamrock, Texas]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rockabilly.nl/artists/bmack.htm Bill Mack, The Midnight Cowboy] Retrieved 2018-04-18.&lt;/ref&gt; is an American [[country music]] singer, songwriter, and radio host.

For many years, Mack was best known as the host of ''The Country Roads Show'', (later ''U.S. 1 Trucking Show'', and later still, ''Midnight Cowboy Trucking Show'') the overnight country music show on [[WBAP (AM)|WBAP]], a [[Clear-channel stations|clear channel]] station in Fort Worth. Mack's show catered primarily to [[truck drivers]] who traveled during the late-night hours. Its opening theme music was an instrumental rendition of ''Orange Blossom Special'', performed by [[Felix Slatkin]] and his orchestra.

Because of WBAP's clear channel signal range via [[skywave]] at night, Mack's show was heard over most of the continental United States. Mack began his show in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rather|first1=Dan|title=Haul or High Water|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iN-a0cvsQ|website=YouTube|publisher=Dan Rather Reports|accessdate=21 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He briefly took his show to [[Mexico|Mexican]] "[[border blaster]]" station [[XERF]], but returned to WBAP when an agreement for Mack to do his show from his Fort Worth home fell through.

In addition, Mack hosts the [[broadcast syndication#Radio syndication|syndicated]] radio show ''Country Crossroads,'' heard on more than 800 stations across the country, and a similar [[cable television]] show on [[FamilyNet]]. He also hosts the ''Overdrive Top Ten Countdown,'' a weekly one-hour [[country music]] countdown geared toward truckers, in [[Radio syndication|syndication]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etrucker.com/apps/news/article.asp?id=17779]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mack left WBAP to join [[XM Satellite Radio]] on its [[Open Road (XM)|Open Road]] channel (XM 171). Two of the other main personalities on Open Road, [[Dave Nemo]] and [[Dale Sommers|Dale "The Truckin' Bozo" Sommers]], were Mack's primary competitors before all three left their [[AM radio]] stations to join XM.  Mack's radio program was heard weekdays on XM channel 13 from 12 Noon to 3 PM Eastern, and rebroadcast from Midnight to 3 AM Eastern.
On April 29, 2011 Mack announced that Sirius/XM had terminated his contract to make room for a merger of two of the channels [[The Roadhouse (sirius) |The Roadhouse]] and [[Willie's Place (Sirius)|Willie's Place]] into one channel and that this was his final show.

Mack was succeeded on his WBAP show by [[Eric Harley]], and the show has since been renamed the ''[[Midnight Radio Network]].''

In the country music industry, Mack is also a songwriter. His best-known song is "[[Blue (Bill Mack song)|Blue]]," one of [[LeAnn Rimes]]' biggest hits. The song won Mack the [[Grammy Award for Best Country Song]] in 1997. Mack also wrote "[[Drinking Champagne|Drinkin' Champagne]]," which has been recorded by numerous artists.

'''Cassinga Day''' is a national public holiday in [[Namibia]] remembering the [[Cassinga Massacre]]. Commemorated annually on [[4 May]], the date "remembers those (approximately 600)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.namibian.com.na/index.php?id=29057 Let's Review Our National Holidays] in The Namibian, 27 April, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; killed in 1978 when the [[South African Defence Force]] attacked a [[South West Africa People's Organization|SWAPO]] base at [[Cassinga]] in southern [[Angola]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecommonwealth.org/YearbookInternal/138840/society/ The Commonwealth Yearbook] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927000000/http://www.thecommonwealth.org/YearbookInternal/138840/society/ |date=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Commemorations are marked yearly by ceremonies at [[Heroes' Acre (Namibia)|Heroes' Acre]], outside of [[Windhoek]]. These ceremonies are attended by many important national political figures, including incumbent [[President of Namibia|President]] [[Hage Geingob]] and former [[List of Presidents of Namibia|President]]s [[Hifikepunye Pohamba]] and [[Sam Nujoma]] (as of 2016).&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2006-09/21/content_5119906.htm Namibian national reconciliation policy] in Xinhua News Agency, 21 September, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==4 May 1978==
In the morning of May 4, 1978, the South African Defence Force ran an air strike on camp ''Cassinga'' near the village of [[Cassinga]], followed by a deployment of [[paratroopers]]. The camp was inhabited by exiled SWAPO sympathisers and their families. 165 men, 294 women and 300 children died in this attack. Later the same day the nearby camp ''Vietnam'' in the village of Tchetequela was also attacked. {{As of|2016}} the graves are unmarked but the [[Government of Namibia|Namibian government]] plans to erect a memorial site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title=Remembering Cassinga Day | last=Muraranganda | first=Elvis | newspaper=[[New Era (Namibia)|New Era]] | date=3 May 2016 | page=3 | url=https://www.newera.com.na/2016/05/03/remembering-cassinga-day/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of Gibraltar}}
The '''Commonwealth Party''' was a [[political party]] in [[Gibraltar]]. It was the first party to contest an election after the [[Association for the Advancement of Civil Rights]] (AACR). It was led by [[Juan Jose Triay]].

It was founded in 1956 to contest the elections to the [[Gibraltar Legislative Council|Legislative Council]] of that year, where it obtained a seat (4 to the AACR, and 2 independents), for Juan Jose Triay. In the elections to the [[Gibraltar City Council|City Council]], three months later (on 5 December 1956) the Commonwealth Party got two out of ten seats, for [[Guy Stagnetto]] and [[Louis Bruzon]] (besides 5 for the AACR, and 3 independents).

However, in 1957 Juan Jose Triay resigned from the Legislative Council in protest at the silence adopted by the other members of the Council on the [[Spain|Spanish]] [[visa (document)|visa]] restrictions issue. In the [[by-election]], the Commonwealth Party candidate, [[Alfred Vasquez]] was not elected and the party disbanded.

The '''Consorcio de Compensacion de Seguros''' is a compulsory Government catastrophic risk [[insurance]] in [[Spain]]. It is an insurance tax charged on prescribed classes of insurance issued by private [[insurer]]s, providing cover against a series of extraordinary perils and "[[Political risk insurance|political risks]]”

Note: This Government scheme covers direct physical damage only. It is expected that a company ensures their commercial [[insurance policy]] covers them against any resulting Business Interruption losses if necessary.

==Sources==

http://www.isn-inc.com/countryinfo/spain.aspx

There are regulations concerning payment of the Consorcio [[tax]] within a certain time of the inception date of the policy. The [[timeline]]s are very strict – payment of the tax should be made to the Consorcio office within 7 days (of inception of the policy) for a new risk, and within 30 days for a renewal.

The '''Corte Capitanale''' is a former [[courthouse]] in [[Mdina]], [[Malta]], which currently serves as a [[city hall]]. It was built in the [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] style between 1726 and 1728, to designs of the French architect [[Charles François de Mondion]]. The building is linked to [[Palazzo Vilhena]], but it has its own entrance and façade.

==History==
The Corte Capitanale was built between 1726 and 1728 along with the rest of [[Palazzo Vilhena]], the [[List of Grand Masters of the Knights Hospitaller|Grand Master]]'s official residence in Mdina. The building was mainly a [[courthouse]], but it also served as the seat of the ''Capitano della Verga''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Foreign and Commonwealth Office Collection|date=1877|title=Statement of all the property transferred to the military and naval authorities from the year 1816 to the end of 1875 with appendix|url=http://dl.docslide.com.br/download/e996ebc0c594ab2c075bf51082e0afbad1243ef61bd876d9ae865c8b12de9684c8f9fccc78f865b350321ff1cdf352c6957a84cdc5c65fd94ac0c0b365bad1f9y3fwCsiz24XCetjkf22h8s%2FKaj0I4xb%2FgkFlqUAHAVSYhM40YeP668ASgtqXSjsjDbOjBw5weyvCKHdsXgIMP%2FQQYWihmzZLujG3HetnnZeq9uIE4woKeLhdOJosFg4r|publisher=University of Manchester|jstor=60231726|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Palazzo Vilhena interior.jpeg|thumb|left|Stairway with the doors of the courtrooms]]
Its linking to the palace was a symbolic gesture to convey the fact that the courts were under the jurisdiction of the [[Knights Hospitaller|Order of St. John]]. The courthouse was also linked to the Bishop's Palace through a now-blocked underground passage, indicating the Church's role in the courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mdina - page two|url=http://romeartlover.tripod.com/Malta18.html|website=romeartlover.tripod.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150112182043/http://romeartlover.tripod.com/Malta18.html|archivedate=12 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building remained a courthouse until 1818.&lt;ref name=roughguides/&gt;

Today, the Corte Capitanale is Mdina's [[city hall]], being the seat of the city's [[Local councils of Malta|local council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Contact Details|url=http://lc.gov.mt/Page.aspx?catid=26&amp;pid=204&amp;lid=1|website=lc.gov.mt|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151130191834/http://lc.gov.mt/Page.aspx?catid=26&amp;pid=204&amp;lid=1|archivedate=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The council considers the building as inadequate, and in 2012 it requested to move its premises to the [[Banca Giuratale (Mdina)|Banca Giuratale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mdina Council wants to use Banca Giuratale|url=http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2012-02-20/news/mdina-council-wants-to-use-banca-giuratale-306085/|work=[[The Malta Independent]]|date=20 February 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151128194714/http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2012-02-20/news/mdina-council-wants-to-use-banca-giuratale-306085/|archivedate=28 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not regularly open to the public, but the main hall is occasionally open with temporary historical or cultural exhibitions.&lt;ref name=roughguides&gt;{{cite book|last1=Borg|first1=Victor Paul|title=The Rough Guide to Malta &amp; Gozo|date=2002|publisher=Rough Guides|isbn=9781858286808|page=127|url=https://books.google.com.mt/books?id=o1QO1Tk-FsMC&amp;pg=PA127#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building was included on the Antiquities List of 1925.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Protection of Antiquities Regulations 21st November, 1932 Government Notice 402 of 1932, as Amended by Government Notices 127 of 1935 and 338 of 1939. |url=https://www.mepa.org.mt/file.aspx?f=2627 |website=[[Malta Environment and Planning Authority]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160419101304/https://www.mepa.org.mt/file.aspx?f=2627 |archivedate=19 April 2016 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now a Grade 1 national monument and it is listed on the [[National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands]].&lt;ref name=nicpmi&gt;{{cite web|title=Corte Capitanale|url=http://www.culturalheritage.gov.mt/filebank/inventory/01185.pdf|website=National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands|date=28 December 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151129201925/http://www.culturalheritage.gov.mt/filebank/inventory/01185.pdf|archivedate=29 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
[[File:Herald's Loggia.jpg|thumb|left|Herald's Loggia]]
The Corte Capitanale is built in the [[French Baroque architecture|French Baroque style]]. The façade is decorated by superimposed [[Tuscan order|Tuscan]] and [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] pilasters, and a [[cornice]] along roof level. A balcony is located above the main doorway, and it is decorated with allegorical statues of [[Justice]] and [[Mercy]]. The inscription ''Legibus et Armis'' (by using laws and arms) is inscribed below the centrepiece of the façade.&lt;ref name=nicpmi/&gt;

The courthouse incorporates some prison cells and dungeons, which had been built in the 16th century.&lt;ref name=nicpmi/&gt; The building is also linked to a [[loggia]] known as Herald's Loggia, from which [[town crier]]s used to announce decrees to the people. The loggia also predates the courthouse, and it is believed to date to the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Herald's Loggia|url=http://www.culturalheritage.gov.mt/filebank/inventory/01196.pdf|website=National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151130212516/http://www.culturalheritage.gov.mt/filebank/inventory/01196.pdf|archivedate=30 November 2015|date=28 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Coz Ov Moni - The First Pidgen Musical Film in the World''''' is a 2010 [[Musical film|musical]] film produced by the [[FOKN BOIS]] and directed by independent [[Ghana]]ian filmmaker King Luu.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mediafritiq.com/2013/10/20/coz-ov-moni-fokn-bois/ |title=Coz Ov Moni: FOKN BOIS|publisher=MediAfritiQ|accessdate=2011-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film is a musical entirely spoken in [[Ghanaian Pidgin English]], but subtitles are shown.

== Synopsis ==
On a normal morning in Gbese, [[Accra]], the FOKN BOIS (rapping duo M3NSA and Wanlov the Kubolor) wake up and plan to go clubbing with some lady friends after chasing an evasive debtor for their money. After getting the money, they set off to blow it off on food, partying and women with hilarious and dramatic consequences. While going through the day, the story highlights real struggles of ordinary young Ghanaians in modern Ghana in spite of the strong elements of humour. Their free-spirited and seemingly conceited attitude makes them a few enemies as the day progresses resulting in a dramatic ending.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.modernghana.com/music/12192/3/a-tale-from-the-premier-of-cos-ov-moni.html |title=A tale from the premier of Coz Ov Moni|publisher=Modern Ghana|accessdate=2011-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.afropop.org/wp/12268/fokn-bois-the-cutting-edge-of-satire-in-african-hip-hop-pt-2/ |title=FOKN Bois: The Cutting Edge of Satire in African Hip Hop|publisher=Afro Pop Worldwide|accessdate=2011-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eileithyia Cave''' (also the Cave of Eileithyia) was a [[Neolithic]],&lt;ref&gt;Greek religion By Walter Burkert [https://books.google.com/books?id=sxurBtx6shoC&amp;pg=PA25&amp;dq=Eileithyia+Cave+Neolithic#v=onepage&amp;q=Eileithyia%20Cave%20Neolithic&amp;f=false Page 25] {{ISBN|0-674-36281-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] and [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] [[sacred cave]] dedicated to the goddess of childbirth, [[Eileithyia]], on the island of [[Crete]].

'''The foreign policy of Ukraine''' is the strategic approach [[Ukraine]] takes to its [[Foreign relations of Ukraine|relations with foreign nations]], cooperation with [[international organization]]s, the promotion of its [[national interests]] and the protection of the rights of its citizens and [[Ukrainian diaspora|diaspora]] abroad.

The strategic goals of Ukraine's foreign policy include [[European integration|European]] and [[NATO|Euro-Atlantic integration]], forming a relationship of strategic partnership with the [[United States of America]], [[European Union]], and the [[Russian Federation]], cooperation with member countries of the [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]] and [[GUAM Organization for Democracy and Economic Development|GUAM]], active engagement with the [[UN]] and other international organizations, effective participation in the global economy with the maximum protection of national interests, and the transformation of Ukraine into a [[regional power]].

Ukraine's foreign policy is guided by a number of key priorities.

'''&lt;big&gt;Ukraine - Russia in 2018&lt;/big&gt;'''

According to a sociological survey conducted by the All-Russia Center for the Study of Public Opinion in February 2018, 40% of Russians surveyed assess Russia's relations with Ukraine as tense, and 22% as hostile. At the same time, 40% of respondents believe that friendly, allied relations will eventually recover.

Four years after the change of power in Ukraine, about three-quarters of Russians (72%) follow the events, including 17% reported that they closely monitor the situation (this proportion is significantly higher among the older generation of 36% aged 60+ and 21% aged 45-59 years, than among young people, 2% among 18-34 year olds).

If the citizens of the Russian Federation estimated February 2014 as a revolution, a coup d'etat (26%), less often as a planned provocation (8%) or a catastrophe for the country (8%), the current state of affairs is seen as a mess (16%) , civil war (12%), crisis (8%).

From the events that occurred as a result of the Maidan, Ukraine lost - most Russians (75%) think that more than half of them are in all socio-demographic groups. The fact that those events did not change anything by their very nature, 13% converge and only 2% believe that Ukraine won.

Current relations between Ukraine and Russia are characterized by 40% of Russians as tense (this share is highest among young people, 47% in the group from 18 to 24 years), 22% - as hostile (the respondents are more likely to think aged 45 to 60, 26%), 13% consider them to be cool and 11% neutral. Almost half of the respondents believe that during the last year the relations between the two countries did not become either better or worse (49%), in the opinion of each third they only worsen (34%).

Prospects for the restoration of ties between Ukraine and Russia are assessed more positively by the Russians: 40% are sure that friendly, allied relations will be restored (46% are more optimistic about this estimate, 35% share this opinion among women), almost 38% that sooner or later the interaction of our countries will normalize, but one in 10 respondents (10%) will never be, never believes in the restoration of relations.

'''Latham Island''', known locally as '''Fungu Kizimkazi''', Fungu Mbaraka is a small, relatively isolated island in the [[Zanzibar Archipelago]], [[Tanzania]] which is historical under the Government of Zanzibar since 1898.

==History==
The island has several local names in addition to Fungu Kizimkazi, the most Notable of which are Fungu la Mbarak after the Arab who had the right to collect wreckage there in the reign of seyid Barghash who was the (Sultan of Zanzibar), Shungu Mbili and Shan jove. The island was featured on an early sixteenth century Portuguese map (Ingrams, n.d) but it derives its present name from the East Indian man Latham which rediscovered it in 1758.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 1796284|title = Latham Island: An Ecological Note|journal = The Geographical Journal|volume = 136|issue = 2|pages = 247–251|last1 = Gwynne|first1 = M. D|last2 = Parker|first2 = I. S. C|last3 = Wood|first3 = D. G|year = 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Zanzibar Administration on the Island==
The island was annexed to Zanzibar on 19 October 1898 when British First Minister Sir Lloyd Mathews under the order of the Sultan of Zanzibar visited the island, planted the Zanzibar Flag, and declared it to be under the administration of Zanzibar. Lloyd Mathews arrived on the island on 18 October 1898 with the warship HHS Barawa alongside Captain Arthur Agnew, Zanzibar Port Officer, and Dr. Alfred Andrew Spurrier, a Medical Officer.

Following the Plantation of Zanzibar Flag on 19 October 1898, [[21-gun salute|21-gun salutes]] were performed as a military honor and the island was officially annexed to the Sultan's authority. An iron house {{Definition needed|date=August 2018}} was built; its corner stone was laid and written with "LATHAM ISLAND, FUNGU KIZIMKAZI UNDER ZANZIBAR SOVEREIGNTY".

==Geography==
Latham Island is a flat coral island located {{convert|60|km|0|abbr=on}} south-east of [[Unguja]] and {{convert|66|km|0|abbr=on}} east of [[Dar es Salaam]]. It is roughly {{convert|300|m|ft|abbr=out}} long and {{convert|300|m|ft|abbr=out}} wide, and has an area of {{convert|0.03|km2|2|abbr=out}}. The island is surrounded by a fringing [[reef]] and is oceanic, as it lies off the continental shelf and is surrounded by deep water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mahongo|first=Shigalla|title=The Tanzanian National Sea Level Report|url=http://www.gloss-sealevel.org/publications/documents/tanzania2006.pdf|accessdate=16 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bird Life International|url=http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/sitefactsheet.php?id=6990|accessdate=16 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecology==
The island is an important breeding ground for various bird species, namely the [[masked booby]], [[greater crested tern]], [[sooty tern]] and the [[brown noddy]]. Latham is also thought to be of importance for nesting turtles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bird Life International|url=http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/sitefactsheet.php?id=6990|accessdate=16 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dispute==
 Although the Island is under Zanzibar territorial water, controversy has emerged over the ownership of the Latham Island between Zanzibar and Tanzania Mainland, the Island is ruled by the United Republic of Tanzania and not under the Zanzibar jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spearblog.com/2011/10/21/dogtooth-world-record-denied/&lt;/ref&gt; Some members of the House of Representatives in Zanzibar and Opposition leaders have been complaining about ownership of the Blocks and Latham Island.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailynews.co.tz/index.php/home-news/50728-who-owns-latham-island&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2981">The '''Military Air Transport Command''' (French: Commandement du transport aérien militaire (COTAM)) was a command of the [[French Air Force]]. It was formed in February 1962 from the ''Groupement d'Unités Aériennes Spécialisées'' and disbanded on 11 March 1994, when it became Commandement de la Force Aérienne de Projection (CFAP). Larousse Encyclopedia Online says the headquarters was at [[Vélizy – Villacoublay Air Base]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.larousse.fr/encyclopedie/ville/V%C3%A9lizy-Villacoublay_78140/148487&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure 1985==
In 1985, the Air Force had four major flying commands, among which was the Military Air Transport Command.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Isby |first1=David |last2=Kamps |first2=Charles |year=1985 |title=Armies of NATO's Central Front |url= |location=London |publisher=Jane's Publishing Company |pages=168–170 |isbn=0-7106-0341-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; CoTAM counted 28 squadrons:
Ten fixed-wing transport squadrons included:
*ET 1/60
*ET 3/60
*[[:fr:Escadron de transport 1/61 Touraine]]
*ET 2/61
*ET 3/61
*ET 1/63
*ET 2/63
*ET 1,2,/64
*ET 3/64 (Transall NG) (Évreux)
*ET 1/65 (Villacoublay)
*ET 2/65 (Villacoublay)
The remainder were helicopter and liaison squadrons, at least five of which were overseas, including six Escadrons de Transport Outre Mer (Overseas Transport Squadrons):
*[[:fr:Escadron d'hélicoptères 1/67 Pyrénées]] (Cazeux Air Base)
*EH 2/67 ([[Metz]])
*EH 3/67 (Villacoublay)
*EH 4/67 ([[Apt, Vaucluse|Apt]])
*EH 5/67 (Istres)
*Escadron de Transport Outre Mer 50 ([[Réunion]]) 
*Escadron de Transport Outre Mer 52 ([[Nouméa]], New Caledonia)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.traditions-air.fr/unit/escadron/ETOM5200.htm&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Escadron de Transport Outre Mer 55 ([[Léopold Sédar Senghor International Airport]], Dakar, Senegal)
*ETOM 58 ([[Fort-de-France]])
*ETOM 82 (Papette)
*ETOM 88 ([[Djibouti]])
*CIEH 341 (Chambéry, moved later to [[Toulouse]]-Francazal)
*ELA 41 (Metz)
*ELA 43 (Bordeaux)
*ELA 44 (MS.760 Paris, Broussard, Nord 262) (Aix)
*ELAS 1/44 at [[Solenzara Air Base]], Corsica)

==Senior leader transport==
The acronym COTAM was used to designated flights carrying important French leaders:
* '''[[Cotam Unité|COTAM 0001]]''' : [[President of the French Republic]].
* '''[[Cotam Deux|COTAM 0002]]''' : [[Prime Minister of France]].
* COTAM 0003 : [[Minister of Defence (France)]].
* COTAM 0004 - 0009 : High ministerial authorities.
* COTAM 0010 - 0099 : high authorities of the state.

While the acronym of the French military air command is now CFAP, the abbreviation COTAM continues to be used as a call sign of French military transport aircraft.

[[image:ncube2.jpg|thumb|The Norwegian satellite nCUBE2.]]

'''nCube''' was a series of two [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[satellite]]s, built by students at several Norwegian universities and university colleges. Due to problems during launch (nCube-1) and deployment into orbit (nCube-2), neither of the satellites became operational.

Both satellites were built to the [[CubeSat]] pico-satellite standard, which defined their mass and size (10&amp;nbsp;cm [[cube]]). This standard allows one or more cube satellites to be launched by '[[Piggyback (transportation)|piggyback]]ing' with a larger satellite.  In this way the smaller satellites get a cheap ride into orbit.

The goal of the nCube satellites was to stimulate interest in science and increase competence in space technology among students and educational institutions. Moreover, enhance co-operation between educational institutions and industry and exchange of knowledge between educational institutions in north and south of [[Norway]].

The second goal was to communicate with [[amateur radio]] ground stations, and to test a space-born [[Automatic Identification System|AIS]] receiver for tracking ships and [[reindeer]].

As of 2013 NTNU is developing a 2U CubeSat called [[NUTS-1]].

The '''National Fascist Movement''' ({{lang-ro|Mișcarea Națională Fascistă}}, MNF) was a [[Romania]]n political movement formed in 1923 by the merger of the [[National Romanian Fascia]] and the [[National Italo-Romanian Cultural and Economic Movement]]. 

With its roots in an avowedly pro-[[Italy|Italian]] group, the MNF also became close supporters of the Italian model of [[Fascism]] - although the movement also admired the methods of ''[[Action Française]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hist.academic.claremontmckenna.edu/jpetropoulos/ironguard/chronology.htm Chronology of Romanian Fascism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051124060223/http://hist.academic.claremontmckenna.edu/jpetropoulos/ironguard/chronology.htm |date=2005-11-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement did not enjoy the success that it had hoped for, largely because of its attachment to foreign influences, and it was ultimately superseded by the [[Iron Guard]], which offered a more domestic form of fascism.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11872">In [[political science]], '''Noopolitik''', formed by a combination of the Greek words νόος ''nóos'' ("knowledge") and  πολιτικός ''politikós'' (πολίτης ''polítēs'' "citizen", from πόλις ''pólis'' "city"), is the network-based [[geopolitics]] of knowledge. The term was invented by defense experts [[John Arquilla]] and [[David Ronfeldt]] in a 1999 [[RAND corporation]] study and often appears in connection with that of ''[[smart power]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Ernest J. III ''Hard Power, Soft Power, Smart Power'' The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science March 2008 vol. 616 no. 1 110–124&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nye, Joseph S. ''The Future of Power'' Public Affairs 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Difference with Realpolitik==
Noopolitics is an informational strategy of manipulating international processes through the forming in the general public, by means of [[mass media]], of positive or negative attitudes to the external or internal policies of a state or block of states, to create a positive or negative image of ideas and promulgated moral values.&lt;ref name="baichik"&gt;(Baichik A.V., Nikonov S.B.  Noopolitik as global information strategy // Vestnik St.Petersburg University, Ser. 9. 2012. Issue. I. p.&amp;nbsp;207-213&lt;/ref&gt;

Noopolitik differs from [[realpolitik]].  Although realpolitik is commonly equated with [[hard power]], and seemingly noopolitik with [[soft power]], both are broader in their embodiment of a form of organization.  Specifically, realpolitik is not limited to hard power and [[coercion]], but embodies a hierarchical form of organization.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}  Likewise, noopolitik is not limited to reliance on knowledge and soft power, but embodies a networked form of organization.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

==Versus Foucault's ''Biopolitics''==
[[Tiziana Terranova]] (2007) describes the use of the term 'noopolitics' by Maurizio Lazzarato (2004). "'Noopolitics' supplements the [[biopolitics]] of the species described by [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]]" (Terranova 2007, 139). "Against the militarization of communication accomplished by new techniques of power, it is possible to think about the constitution of such publics as counter-weapons, which work by expressing, inventing and creating possible worlds where the moment of resistance (the 'no' by which one refuses to watch, listen or believe) is the starting point for an affirmative activity" (Terranova 2007, 140). Noyer &amp; Juanals (2008) have also discussed Noopolitik as a means of [[social control]].&lt;ref&gt;La stratégie américaine du contrôle continu De la « Noopolitik » (1999) à « Byting Back » (2007) : une création de concepts et de dispositifs de contrôle des populations Jean-Max Noyer, Brigitte Juanals (03/01/2008) [http://archivesic.ccsd.cnrs.fr/docs/00/29/22/07/PDF/Noopolitik_Byting_Back5.pdf HAL]&lt;/ref&gt; especially in connection with RAND's [[Byting back]] program which was published as research into [[counter insurgency]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin C. Libicki, David C. Gompert, David R. Frelinger, Raymond Smith ''Byting Back -- Regaining Information Superiority Against 21st-Century Insurgents'' RAND Counterinsurgency Study -- Volume 1 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the knowledge economy and the BRICS==

While the term initially appeared in association with the concept of the US [[Revolution in Military Affairs]], Noopolitik has also come to describe an interest in the [[knowledge economy]] and in particular [[innovation]] and [[Research and development|R&amp;D]] to leverage growth and political reach in [[international relations]]. Thus Noopolitik may be defined as the use of innovation and knowledge to leverage political intercourses by other means at the international level. Such "knowledge race" may be either a means of asserting political independence or of generating a sudden gap in the geopolitical [[Lateral Pressure Theory|balance of power]]. The attitude of the People's Republic of China and the [[ANZUS]] in the Pacific Ocean has been described as such by {{ill|Idriss J. Aberkane|fr|Idriss Aberkane}} (2011).
{{cquote| Therefore, comparable to the [[Geographical Pivot of History|Heartland]], the [[Pacific Ocean|“Heartocean”]] inevitably disputed by powers of which none may prevail alone in the future without a decisive innovation will become the scene of a commensurate [[The Great Game|Great Game]] with the two same grand stakes. This will be the fate (or doom) of multilateralism on the one side and the global knowledge race on the other. (...). As stated by Seth Cropsey (2010) commenting on China’s noopolitik move of deploying new [[DF-21|anti-ship missiles]]&lt;ref&gt;Fox News.com Aug. 6th 2010 Chinese 'Carrier-Killer' Missile Could Reshape Sea Combat [link | http://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2010/08/06/chinese-carrier-killer-missile-game-changer-expert-says/]&lt;/ref&gt; in the ocean “keeping the Pacific pacific”.&lt;ref&gt;Seth Cropsey Keeping the Pacific pacific.

[http://www.e-ir.info/?p=7854   Brzezinski on a US Berezina: anticipating a new, New World Order] e-International Relations Mar 31st 2011&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===For the People's Republic of China===
Professor Li Xiguang of [[Tsinghua University]] described the stakes of [[Smart power]] for the People's Republic of China in a 2010 article on Noopolitik in the [[Global Times]]

{{cquote| Soft power is the power of making people love you. Hard power is the ability to making people fear you. Over the last 500 years, all the world powers gained their hegemony through hard power, but the US has gained its hegemony through combining hard power and soft power, both striking at and assimilating its opponents.
The US has built its soft power by making its values and political system, such as the US interpretation and definition of democracy, freedom and human rights, into supposedly universal values.&lt;ref&gt;Li Xinguang ''Soft power's reach depends on friendly Internet'' The Global Times Nov 2nd 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

{{ill|Idriss J. Aberkane|fr|Idriss Aberkane}} analyzes Noopolitik as a defining stance of the [[People's Republic of China]]'s economic policy&lt;ref&gt;Aberkane, Idriss J. [http://www.e-ir.info/?p=9445  An Optimistic Memo on the Chinese Noopolitik: 2001-2011] [[e-International Relations]] jun. 14 2011&lt;/ref&gt; in which he concludes "''Maintaining “Leap and Bound” creativity could be an efficient way for China to neutralize popular frustration. What must be acknowledged is that the PRC has moved from a “growth panacea” policy, to a policy of “knowledge panacea.” This best sums up its Noopolitik.''"

{{cquote| Emphasizing China’s deeply-rooted desire for technological independence, Segal&lt;ref&gt;Segal, A. (2010) China’s Innovation Wall : Beijing’s Push for Homegrown technology. Foreign Affairs Sept 28 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; refers to the PRC’s efforts as an “Innovation Wall,” which is the willingness to innovate as independently as possible from the rest of the world to simply and systematically leap ahead of any other country. Needless to say, the scope of the rising [[fog of war]] in world economic and R&amp;D competition is particularly daunting for the Euro-Atlantic community. The Chinese phrase for national innovation [[zizhu chuangxin]] was notably coined in a 2006 state report titled “Guidelines on National Medium- and Long-Term Program for Science and Technology Development.” If China decides to foster an innovation of its own, and the ideas were published in Mandarin language journals it would provide a barrier against other linguistic communities, and a thicker fog of war might rise in knowledge-based [[Economic Warfare|economic warfare]].}}

==Oldest==

The oldest recorded [[parliament]] still in existence is the ''[[Althing]]'', the ruling legislative body of [[Iceland]]. It was founded in 930 and originally consisted of 39 local chieftains. Abolished in 1800 it was restored by [[Denmark]] in 1843.

The oldest continuous parliament is the ''[[Tynwald]]'' of the [[Isle of Man]]. Its exact formation date is generally believed to be 979 but some sources suggest that its origins lie in the early 9th century, which would predate even the ''Althing''.&lt;ref name="GBOR96"&gt;{{cite book | last = McWhirter | first = Norris
  | title = [[Guinness Book of Records]]  | publisher = Guinness Publishing
  | year = 1996  | pages = 182  | isbn = 0-85112-646-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first recorded legislative body on record is the bicameral ''[[ukkim]]'' found in [[Erech]] in [[Iraq]] that was founded in around 2800 BC.&lt;ref name="GBOR96"/&gt;{{rp|182}}

==Largest==

The largest legislative assembly is the [[People's Republic of China|Chinese]] [[National People's Congress]], which consists of around 3000 indirectly elected members.

==Women's suffrage==
{{main|Women's suffrage}}

The first administration to introduce the [[suffrage]] of women into its constitution was [[Pitcairn Islands]] in 1838, although it had no legal standing. [[South Australia]] introduced female suffrage in 1861 and the Territory of [[Wyoming]] allowed women the vote in 1869, with the [[Isle of Man]] following in 1881.

The first country to allow women the vote was [[New Zealand]] in 1893.

{{Business administration}}

In [[organizational studies]], '''resource management''' is the efficient and effective development of an organization's resources when they are needed. Such resources may include financial resources, inventory, human skills, production resources, or [[information technology]] (IT).

In the realm of [[project management]], processes, techniques and philosophies as to the best approach for allocating resources have been developed.  These include discussions on functional vs. cross-functional [[resource allocation]] as well as processes espoused by organizations like the [[Project Management Institute]] (PMI) through their [[Project Management Body of Knowledge]] (PMBOK) methodology of project management. Resource management is a key element to activity resource estimating and project human resource management. Both are essential components of a comprehensive project management plan to execute and monitor a project successfully.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge, Third Edition|year=2004|publisher=Project Management Institute (PMI)|location=Newtown Square, Pennsylvania|isbn=1-930699-45-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge, Fourth Edition|year=2008|publisher=Project Management Institute (PMI)|location=Newtown Square, Pennsylvania|isbn=978-1-933890-51-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; As is the case with the larger discipline of [[project management]], there are [[list of resource management software|resource management software]] tools available that automate and assist the process of resource allocation to projects and portfolio resource transparency including [[supply and demand]] of resources.  The goal of these tools typically is to ensure that: (i) there are employees within our organization with required specific [[skill set]] and desired profile required for a project, (ii) decide the number and skill sets of new employees to hire, and (iii) allocate the workforce to various projects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bizmerlin.com/resource_management_process.php Resource Management Process]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[https://meisterplan.com/project-portfolio-management/resource-management/ Resource Management Method]&lt;/ref&gt;Within professional services and consulting organizations, the effectiveness of these tools and processes is typically monitored by measuring billable [[utilization rate]].

==Corporate Resource Management Process==


Large organizations usually have a defined corporate resource management process which mainly guarantees that resources are never over-allocated across multiple projects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pmhut.com/modern-project-management Modern Project Management]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pdware.com/ Enterprise Resource Management]&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Drucker wrote of the need to focus resources, abandoning a less promising initiatives for every new project taken on, as fragmentation inhibits results. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Growing in Turbulent Times'|url=http://www.projectauditors.com/Papers/Growing_a_Company/Growing_in_Turbulent_Times.html |author=Frank Parth}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Techniques==

One resource management technique is [[resource leveling]]. It aims at smoothing the stock of resources on hand, reducing both excess inventories and shortages.

The required data are: the [[Demand (economics)|demand]]s for various resources, forecast by time period into the future as far as is reasonable, as well as the resources' configurations required in those demands, and the [[Supply (economics)|supply]] of the resources, again forecast by time period into the future as far as is reasonable.

The goal is to achieve 100% [[utilization]] but that is very unlikely, when weighted by important metrics and subject to constraints, for example: meeting a minimum service level, but otherwise minimizing [[cost]].  A Project Resource Allocation Matrix (PRAM) is maintained to visualize the resource allocations against various projects.

The principle is to invest in resources as stored capabilities, then unleash the capabilities as demanded.

A dimension of resource development is included in resource management by which investment in resources can be retained by a smaller additional investment to develop a new capability that is demanded, at a lower investment than disposing of the current resource and replacing it with another that has the demanded capability.

In [[Habitat conservation|conservation]], resource management is a set of practices pertaining to maintaining natural systems integrity.  Examples of this form of management are [[Air#Air pollution|air resource]] management, [[soil conservation]], [[forestry]], [[wildlife]] management and [[water resource]] management.  The broad term for this type of resource management is [[natural resource management]] (NRM).

In addition, we can use [[Ishikawa diagram]] to analyze Man, Money, Material and Machine needed.

Galtellì was an episcopal see in 1138, when [[Pope Innocent II]] made it a suffragan of the [[archdiocese of Pisa]]; later, it was directly subject to the [[Holy See]]. In 1495, it was suppressed by Alexander VI, and its territory united to the diocese of Cagliari. In 1787, at the request of King [[Victor Emmanuel III]], it was re-established, but the bishop continued to live at [[Nuoro]]. Among its bishops was Fra [[Arnolfo de Bissalis]] (1366).

The '''Second Battle of Blida''' was a battle between France and the local Algerian popular forces. It began on 17 November 1830 and ended eight days later on 25 November. After the failure of [[July Monarchy|France]] in the [[First Battle of Blida]], [[Louis-Auguste-Victor, Count de Ghaisnes de Bourmont|de Burman]] was relieved of his duties and General [[Bertrand Clausel]] was appointed on 17 November 1830 for a major campaign on [[Blida]] and [[Médéa]]. [[Bertrand Clausel]] conducted a massive campaign with 17,000 soldiers to invade [[Blida]] and [[Médéa]].&lt;ref&gt;Histoire de l'Algérie ancienne et moderne (Ancient and Modern History of Algeria) [https://books.google.dz/books?id=ilH0gaYdal8C&amp;pg=PA581 (read online)]&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Battle ==
The inhabitants of [[Blida]] refused to allow the French army into the city and a fierce battle broke out in which hundreds were killed or wounded. The French army burned the orchards surrounding the city and the inhabitants were forced to flee into the mountains. Before his departure from Blida, General [[Bertrand Clausel]] left a French garrison under the command of Colonel Roulhières&lt;ref&gt;Joseph et Caroline ou le berger de la Sologne. Histoire Veritable, Volumes 1-2 [https://books.google.dz/books?id=M0qKUbFc4_UC&amp;pg=PA128 (read online)]&lt;/ref&gt; and headed towards [[Médéa]]. He was ambushed by the Popular Resistance in a mountainous strait near [[Mouzaïa]], and 27 French soldiers were killed. Before General  Clausel returned from Médéa, the French garrison in [[Blida]] managed to eliminate a French contingent of 100 soldiers near [[Boufarik]] on 25 November 1830.{{clarify |date=October 2017 |reason= Confusing/contradictory; possible mistake.}} In the face of a great resistance, General Clausel was forced to take over [[Médéa]] and withdraw completely from [[Blida]].

[[File:Oliva in Bar.jpg|thumb|Stara Maslina]]
'''Stara Maslina''' is one of the world's oldest olive trees, located near [[Stari Bar]] ([[Bar, Montenegro|City of Bar]]) in [[Montenegro]]. The tree is said to be over 2,000 years old. It is a popular tourist attraction in the country.

A side of the tree is completely burnt. According to popular folklore, a few men were playing cards next to the tree. During their game, one member accidentally threw a lit match onto the tree, and it soon went up in flames.
