[[Image:Andean States1.PNG|thumb|Orange= Geographically and politically&lt;br&gt;Blue= Geographically]]

The '''Andean states''' ({{lang-es|Estados Andinos}}) are a group of nations in [[South America]] connected by the [[Andes]] mountain range. "Andean States" is sometimes used to refer to all seven countries that the Andes runs through, regions with a shared culture primarily spread during the times of the [[Inca Empire]] (such as the [[Quechua language]] and [[Andean cuisine]]), or it can be used in a geopolitical sense to designate countries in the region that are members of the [[Andean Community]] trade group and have a local (as opposed to European) cultural orientation.

The Andes extend through the western part of South America in following countries:

* {{flag|Colombia}}
* {{flag|Venezuela}}
* {{flag|Ecuador}}
* {{flag|Peru}}
* {{flag|Bolivia}}
* {{flag|Argentina}} (not considered to be geopolitically an Andean State)
* {{flag|Chile}} (not considered to be geopolitically an Andean State)

When grouped as "the Andean states", the emphasis is on the mountainous regions of these countries. For example, the Argentine ''[[pampas]]'' are not part of the Andean region, but western Argentina along with Chile is part of the Andean region. Venezuela, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador and Bolivia are part of the Andean Community (a trade grouping), and each contains [[Amazon Rainforest]] and Amazonian indigenous people as well as Andean mountains.

[[File:Bussluse 05-04-06 01.jpg|thumb|A bus trap in [[Denmark]]]]
[[File:Skejby Busvej 05.JPG|thumb|A bus trap in northern Aarhus, Denmark]]
A '''bus trap''' is a metal grate placed over a ditch or pit in the road with tines (sides) spaced far enough apart that small-diameter-wheeled (narrower axle) vehicles fall in between the tines but close enough that larger-diameter-wheeled vehicles, such as buses, may pass.  Cycles may cross broader sided examples.

Different versions exist for restricting access.  The tines cross the path of the road, not parallel with the road direction.  Small-wheeled vehicles bottom out in between the tines, preventing the vehicle from continuing over the obstacle.

==Deprecation and preferred alternatives==
Many domestic vehicles exist in the 21st century wide enough to navigate bus traps effectively; wide-axle SUVs and 4x4s. Police cars and in some cases motorbikes are hindered by bus traps. Most cities favour other means of keeping cars out of bus-only areas, such as:
*fines backed up with camera enforcement
*a controlled barrier &amp;mdash; may use [[radio-frequency identification]]
*a rising clearly marked bollard kept in a default risen state (Rfid)  &amp;mdash; may use [[radio-frequency identification]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1264">'''Candyn''' (also spelled ''Candin'' or ''Candy'') was a supposed remote east-Asian island around the turn of the 15th century.

On the 1457 [[Genoese map]] there is an island of ''Candia'', with a report of a "large fish" being captured and brought back to [[Venice]].

It can be found on [[Erdapfel|Martin Behaim's globe]] in 1492, where he described it as being: "foot against foot with respect to our land, and when it is day with us they have night" (in other words, in the [[antipodes]]).

It appeared on the 1507 map of [[Johannes Ruysch]], the [[Waldseemüller map]], and the [[Johannes Schöner globe]].

It may be identified with [[Odoric of Pordenone|Odoric's]] island of "Dondin".

Although speculation has linked it with [[Ceylon]] or [[Indonesia|Indonesian]] islands, no positive determination has been made matching Candyn with any known physical location.

Parts of Valencia (Spanish) and Catalonia ([[Occitan language|Occitan]]) are not Catalan-speaking.

The "Catalan Countries" have been at the centre of both cultural and political projects since the late 19th century. Its mainly cultural dimension became increasingly politically charged by the late 1960s and early 1970s, as [[Francoism]] began to die out in Spain, and what had been a cultural term restricted to connoisseurs of Catalan [[philology]] became a divisive issue during the [[Spanish Transition]] period, most acrimoniously in Valencia during the 1980s. Modern linguistic and cultural projects include the [[Institut Ramon Llull]] and the [[Fundació Ramon Llull]], which are run by the governments of the Balearic Islands, Catalonia and Andorra, the General Council of the Pyrénées-Orientales, the city council of Alghero and the Network of Valencian Cities. Politically, it involves a [[Pan-nationalism|pan-nationalist]] project to unite the Catalan-speaking territories of Spain and France, often in the context of [[Catalan independence]]. The political project does not enjoy wide support, particularly outside Catalonia, where it is viewed as an expression of Catalan expansionism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HpKVwFYoxGgC&amp;pg=PT38|page=37|title=El catalán: una lengua de Europa para compartir|first=Vicent de|last=Melchor|first2=Albert|last2=Branchadell|publisher=Univ. Autònoma de Barcelona|year=2002|isbn=8449022991}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "Catalan Countries" is itself controversial, and Valencian nationalists avoid using it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ricós|first1=F.|title=Oltra: 'No usamos 'països catalans' nunca, a no ser en nuestros actos, con amigos'|url=http://www.lasprovincias.es/politica/201508/17/oltra-usamos-paisos-catalans-20150817001125-v.html|accessdate=3 January 2017|work=Las Provincias|date=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Different meanings==
[[File:Linguistic map Southwestern Europe.gif|thumb|right|300px]] 
''Països Catalans'' has different meanings depending on the context. These can be roughly classified in two groups: linguistic or political, the political definition of the concept being the widest, since it also encompasses the linguistic side of it.

As a linguistic term, ''Països Catalans'' is used in a similar fashion to the English [[Anglosphere]], the French [[Francophonie]], the Portuguese [[Lusofonia]] or the Spanish [[Hispanophone]] territories. However, it is not universally accepted, even as a linguistic concept, in the territories it purports to unite.

As a political term, it refers to a number of political projects&lt;ref&gt;Arnau Gonzàlez i Vilalta (2006) [http://www.recercat.net/bitstream/2072/3597/1/ICPS252.pdf The Catalan Countries Project (1931–1939)]. Department of Contemporany History, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona.&lt;/ref&gt; as advocated by supporters of [[Catalan independence]]. These, based on the linguistic fact, argue for the existence of a common national identity that would surpass the limits of each territory covered by this concept and would apply also to the remaining ones. These movements advocate for "political collaboration"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bloc.ws/index.php/bloc/extended-local/ponncia_destatuts_aprovada_al_iv_congrs_nacional_del_bloc/global/ Statutes of Valencian Nationalist Bloc] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080628131059/http://www.bloc.ws/index.php/bloc/extended-local/ponncia_destatuts_aprovada_al_iv_congrs_nacional_del_bloc/global/ |date=28 June 2008 }}. Bloc.ws. Retrieved on 12 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; amongst these territories. This often stands for their union and political independence.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080122061053/http://www.esquerra.cat/partit/projecte-politic Political project of Republican Left of Catalonia]. Esquerra.cat. Retrieved on 12 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence of the opposition these political projects have received –notably in some of the territories described by this concept&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2005/10/23/espana/1130104217.html El Gobierno valenciano, indignado por la pancarta de 'països catalans' exhibida en el Camp Nou – españa –]. Elmundo.es (24 October 2005). Retrieved on 12 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; – some cultural institutions avoid the usage of ''Països Catalans'' in some contexts, as a means to prevent any political interpretation; in these cases, equivalent expressions (such as ''Catalan-speaking countries'') or others (such as ''the linguistic domain of Catalan language'') are used instead.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070222112904/http://www.llull.cat/llull/estatic/eng/quisom/catala.shtm Catalan, the language of eleven million Europeans].

==Component territories==
{{Catalan-speaking world|image=[[Image:Extensió de la llengua catalana als Països Catalans.png|225px|Map of catalan language domain]] |caption= Map of [[Catalan language]] domain|expanded=Divisions}}
Catalan and its variants are spoken in:

* the Spanish [[Autonomous Communities]] of
**[[Catalonia]]&amp;nbsp;– even though in the ''[[comarca]]'' of [[Val d'Aran]], [[Occitan language|Occitan]] is considered the language proper to that territory;
**[[Aragon]], in a Catalan-speaking area named "''[[La Franja]]''" ("The Strip");
**the [[Balearic Islands]] and
**as ''[[Valencian]]'', in the [[Valencian Community]], with the exception of some western and southern territories where Spanish is the only language spoken;
***[[Carche]],  small Valencian-speaking area in the Spanish autonomous community of [[Region of Murcia|Murcia]] where some of its 600 inhabitants still speak Valencian due to immigration during the 19th century;
*[[Andorra]], a European sovereign state where Catalan is the [[national language|national]] and only [[official language]].
* most of the French department of the [[Pyrénées-Orientales]], also called ''[[Pays (France)|Le Pays Catalan]]'' (The Catalan Country) in French or ''Catalunya (del) Nord'' ([[Northern Catalonia]]) in Catalan;
* the Italian city of [[Alghero]], in the island of [[Sardinia]], where [[Alguerese|a variant of Catalan]] is spoken.

Catalan is the official language of Andorra, co-official with Spanish and Occitan in Catalonia, co-official with Spanish in the Balearic Islands and the Valencian Community—with the [[names of the Catalan language|denomination]] of ''Valencian'' in the latter—and co-official with Italian in the city of Alghero. It is also part of the recognized minority languages of Italy along with [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]], also spoken in Alghero.

It is not official in Aragon, Murcia or the Pyrénées-Orientales, even though on 10 December 2007 the [[General Council of the Pyrénées-Orientales]] officially recognized Catalan, along with French, as a language of the department.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080207072824/http://www.cg66.fr/culture/patrimoine_catalanite/catalanite/charte.html Charte en faveur du Catalan]. cg66.fr&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the Catalan language was declarated ''llengua pròpia'' (with the [[Aragonese language]]) of [[Aragon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boa.aragon.es/cgi-bin/BOAE/BRSCGI?CMD=VEROBJ&amp;MLKOB=478436853737 |title=LEY 10/2009, de 22 de diciembre, de uso, protección y promoción de las lenguas propias de Aragon. |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=29 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural dimension==
There are several endeavors and collaborations amongst some of the diverse government and cultural institutions involved. One such case is the [[Ramon Llull Institute]] (IRL), founded in 2002 by the [[Govern de les Illes Balears|government of the Balearic Islands]] and the [[Generalitat de Catalunya|government of Catalonia]]. Its main objective is to promote the Catalan language and culture abroad in all its [[Catalan dialects|variants]], as well as the works of writers, artists, scientists and researchers of the regions which are part of it. The [[Xarxa Vives d'Universitats]] (Vives Network of Universities), an association of universities of Catalonia, Valencia, the Balearic Islands, Northern Catalonia and Andorra founded in 1994, was incorporated into the IRL in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=La Xarxa Vives s'incorpora als òrgans de govern de l'Institut Ramon Llull|url=http://www.vives.org/premsa/2008-05-22.php|accessdate=13 June 2017|publisher=Xarxa Vives d'Universitats|date=22 May 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529000552/http://www.vives.org/premsa/2008-05-22.php|archivedate=29 May 2008|language=ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2008, in order to extend the collaboration to institutions from all across the "Catalan Countries", the IRL and the government of [[Andorra]] (which formerly had enjoyed occasional collaboration, most notably in the [[Frankfurt Book Fair]] of 2007) created the [[Ramon Llull Foundation]] (FRL), an international cultural institution with the same goals as the IRL.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.3cat24.cat/noticia/267235/ociicultura/Neix-la-Fundacio-Ramon-Llull Neix la Fundació Ramon Llull]. 3cat24.cat (31 March 2008).

==Political dimension==
The political projects that centre on the Catalan Countries have been described as a "hypothetical and future union" of the various territories.&lt;ref name="Jordà Sánchez"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=A contracorriente: el independentismo de las Islas Baleares (1976-2011)|page=22|first=Joan Pau|last=Jordà Sánchez|first2=Miquel|last2=Amengual i Bibiloni|first3=Antoni|last3=Marimon Riutort|issue=35|year=2014|journal=Historia Actual Online|issn=1696-2060|url=http://www.historia-actual.org/Publicaciones/index.php/haol/article/view/1093/944|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases it involves the Spanish autonomous communities of Catalonia, Valencia and the Balearics.&lt;ref name=Resina/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hargreaves/&gt; The 2016 electoral programme of Valencian parties [[Coalició Compromís|Compromís]] and [[Podemos (Spanish political party)|Podemos]] spoke of a "federation" between the Valencian Community, the Balearic Islands and Catalonia.

Many in Spain see the concept of the ''Països Catalans'' as regional exceptionalism, counterpoised to a centralizing Spanish and French [[national identity]]. Others see it as an attempt by a Catalonia-proper-centered nationalism to lay a hegemonic claim to Valencia, the Balearic Islands or Roussillon, where the prevailing feeling is that they have their own respective historical personalities, not necessarily related to Catalonia's. The Catalan author and journalist Valentí Puig described the term as "inconvenient", saying it has generated more reactions against it than adhesions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.joanducros.net/corpus/Valenti%20Puig.html Valenti Puig] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050224203610/http://www.joanducros.net/corpus/Valenti%20Puig.html |date=24 February 2005 }}.

Thus, in many parts of the territories designated by some as ''Països Catalans'', Catalan nationalist sentiment is uncommon or nonexistent. For example, in the [[Valencian Community]] case, the ''[[Esquerra Repúblicana del País Valencià]]'' (ERPV) is the most relevant party explicitly supportive of the idea but its representation is limited to a total of four local councilors elected in three municipalities&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070820211928/http://www.pre.gva.es/pls/argos_elec/DMEDB_ElecComunidades.informeElecDetallado?aNComuId=17&amp;aNNumElec=1&amp;aVTipoElec=L&amp;aVFechaElec=2007&amp;aVLengua=v Valencia local elections 2007 accessed 27 July 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; (out of a total of 5,622 local councilors elected in the 542 Valencian municipalities).

There are other parties which consider this term only in its cultural or linguistical fact, not believing in national-political unity, as in the case of the Bloc Nacionalista Valencià. The Valencian Nationalist Bloc ({{lang-ca-valencia|Bloc Nacionalista Valencià, Bloc}} or ''BNV''; {{IPA-ca|ˈblɔɡ nasionaˈlista valensiˈa|IPA}}) is the largest [[Valencian nationalism|Valencian nationalist]] party in the [[Valencian Country]], Spain. The Bloc's main aim is, as stated in their guidelines, "to achieve full national sovereignty for the [[Valencian people]], and make it legally declared by a Valencian sovereign Constitution allowing the possibility of association with the countries which share the same language, history and culture".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bloc.ws/index.php/bloc/extended-local/ponncia_destatuts_aprovada_al_iv_congrs_nacional_del_bloc/global/ Bloc Nacionalista Valencià] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080628131059/http://www.bloc.ws/index.php/bloc/extended-local/ponncia_destatuts_aprovada_al_iv_congrs_nacional_del_bloc/global/ |date=28 June 2008 }}.

Some of the most vocal defenders or promoters of the "Catalan Countries" concept (such as [[Joan Fuster]], [[Josep Guia]] or [[Vicent Partal]]) were Valencian.

The subject became very controversial during the politically agitated [[Spanish Transition]] in what was to become the Valencian Community, especially in and around the city of [[Valencia]]. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, when the Spanish [[Autonomous Communities]] system was taking shape, the controversy reached its height. Various Valencian [[right-wing]] politicians (originally from [[Unión de Centro Democrático]]) fearing what was seen as an annexation attempt from Catalonia, fueled a violent [[Anti-Catalanism|Anti-Catalanist]] campaign against local supporters of the concept of the ''Països Catalans'', which even included a handful of unsuccessful attacks with explosives against authors perceived as flagships of the concept, such as Joan Fuster or Manuel Sanchis i Guarner. The concept's revival during this period was behind the formation of the fiercely opposed and staunch anti-Catalan [[blaverism|blaverist]] movement, led by [[Unió Valenciana]], which, in turn, significantly diminished during the 1990s and the 2000s as the ''Països Catalans'' controversy slowly disappeared from the Valencian political arena.

This confrontation between politicians from [[Catalonia]] and [[Valencian Community|Valencia]] very much diminished in severity during the course of the late 1980s and, especially, the 1990s as the [[Generalitat Valenciana|Valencian Community's regional government]] became consolidated. Since then, the topic has lost most of its controversial potential, even though occasional clashes may appear from time to time, such as controversies regarding the broadcasting of [[TV3 (Catalonia)|Catalan television]] in Valencia—[[Nou (TV channel)|and vice versa]]—or the usage by Catalan official institutions of terms which are perceived in Valencia as Catalan nationalistic, such as ''Països Catalans'' or ''País Valencià'' (''Valencian Country'').

A 2004 poll in Valencia found that a majority of the population in this region considered Valencian to be a different language to Catalan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lavanguardia.com/cultura/20041209/51262801790/casi-el-65-de-los-valencianos-opina-que-su-lengua-es-distinta-al-catalan-segun-una-encuesta-del-ci.html|title=Casi el 65% de los valencianos opina que su lengua es distinta al catalán, según una encuesta del CIS|work=La Vanguardia|date=19 December 2004|accessdate=13 June 2017|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the Spanish newspaper ''[[ABC (newspaper)|ABC]]'' reported that the Catalan government of Artur Mas had spent millions of euros to promote Catalanism in Valencia over the previous three years.&lt;ref name=abc2&gt;{{cite news|last1=Caparrós|first1=Alberto|title=Mas inyecta cuatro millones en dos años para fomentar el catalanismo en Valencia|url=http://www.abc.es/local-comunidad-valenciana/20150503/abci-subvenciones-valencia-201505031747.html|accessdate=2 May 2017|work=ABC|date=3 May 2015|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As for the other territories, there are no political parties even mentioning the ''Països Catalans'' as a public issue neither in Andorra, nor in ''la Franja'', Carche or Alghero. In the Balearic islands, support for parties related to Catalan nationalism is around 10% of the total votes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070704221446/http://contingutsweb.parlamentib.es/juntaelectoral/7/Resultats%20Parlament%20Illes%20Balears.pdf Eleccions al Parlament de les Illes Balears]. contingutsweb.parlamentib.es (8 June 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Reversely, the [[Popular Party (Spain)|Popular Party]] –which is a staunch opponent of whatever political implications for the ''Països Catalans'' concept– is the majority party in Valencia and the Balearic islands.

Even though the topic has been largely absent from the political agenda as of late, in December 2013 the [[Balearic regional election, 2011|regional Parliament of the Balearic islands]] passed an official declaration&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=El Ple aprova defensar l'autonomia del Parlament|url=http://www.parlamentib.es/ca/webdocs/NoticiaPIB.aspx?id=806|website=Parlament de les Illes Balears|accessdate=17 June 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213090318/http://www.parlamentib.es/ca/webdocs/NoticiaPIB.aspx?id=806|archivedate=13 December 2013|language=ca|date=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; in defence of its autonomy and in response to a prior declaration by the [[Catalan parliament|Catalan regional Parliament]] which included reference to the term in question. In the declaration of the Balearic islands parliament, it was stated that the so-called "''Països Catalans'' do not exist and the Balearic islands do not take part in any 'Catalan country' whatsoever".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=El Parlament balear aprova que 'els Països Catalans no existeixen'|url=http://politica.e-noticies.cat/el-parlament-balear-aprova-que-els-paisos-catalans-no-existeixen-81327.html|website=e-notícies|accessdate=17 June 2017|language=ca|date=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2014, the ex-mayor of Alghero, Carlo Sechi, dubbed the official delegations of the Catalan Generalitat and Omnium Cultural in that city as [[colonialist]] and as an attempt of interfering with Algherese matters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naciodigital.cat/noticia/71523/exalcalde/alguer/acusa/omnium/generalitat/colonialisme L'exalcalde de l'Alguer acusa Òmnium i la Generalitat de «colonialisme - Nació Digital]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Spanish Constitution of 1978]] contains a clause forbidding the formation of federations amongst [[autonomous communities]]. Therefore, if it were the case that the ''Països Catalans'' idea gained a majority democratic support in future elections, a constitutional amendment would still be needed for those parts of the ''Països Catalans'' lying in Spain to create a common legal representative body, even though in the addenda to the Constitution there is a clause allowing an exception to this rule in the case of [[Navarre]], which can join the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] should the people choose to do so.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070711205000/http://www.constitucion.es/constitucion/lenguas/ingles.html Constitución Española en inglés]. constitucion.es&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The term ''Països Catalans'' was first documented in 1876 in ''Historia del Derecho en Cataluña, Mallorca y Valencia. Código de las Costumbres de Tortosa, I'' (History of the Law in Catalonia, Majorca and Valencia. Code of the Customs of Tortosa, I) written by the Valencian Law historian Benvingut Oliver i Esteller.

The term was both challenged and reinforced by the use of the term "Occitan Countries" from the Oficina de Relacions Meridionals (Office of Southern Relations) in Barcelona by 1933. Another proposal which enjoyed some popularity during the Renaixença was "Pàtria llemosina" (Limousine Fatherland), proposed by [[Víctor Balaguer]] as a federation of Catalan-speaking provinces; both these coinages were based on the theory that Catalan is a dialect of [[Occitan language|Occitan]].

None of these names reached widespread cultural usage and the term nearly vanished until it was rediscovered, redefined and put in the center of the identity cultural debate by [[Valencian Community|Valencian]] writer [[Joan Fuster]]. In his book ''[[Nosaltres, els valencians]]'' (''We, the Valencians'', published in 1962) a new political interpretation of the concept was introduced; from the original, meaning roughly ''Catalan-speaking territories'', Fuster developed a political inference closely associated to [[Catalan nationalism]]. This new approach would refer to the Catalan Countries as a more or less unitary nation with a shared culture which had been divided by the course of history, but which should logically be politically reunited. Fuster's preference for ''Països Catalans'' gained popularity, and previous unsuccessful proposals such as ''Comunitat Catalànica'' (''Catalanic Community'') or ''Bacàvia''&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070311171157/http://www.avl.gva.es/accessible/gabinet/premsa.asp?id=128 L'Acadèmia aprova per unanimitat el Dictamen sobre els principis i criteris per a la defensa de la denominació i l'entitat del valencià]. Acadèmia Valenciana de la Llengua&lt;/ref&gt; (after Balearics-Catalonia-Valencia) diminished in use.

Today, the term is politically charged, and tends to be closely associated with [[Catalan nationalism]] and supporters of [[Catalan independence]]. The idea of uniting these territories in an independent state is supported by a number of political parties, [[Republican Left of Catalonia|ERC]] being the most important in terms of representation (21 members in the [[Parliament of Catalonia]]) and [[Popular Unity Candidacy|CUP]] (10 members). [[Republican Left of the Valencian Country|ERPV]], PSAN (currently integrated in [[Catalan Solidarity for Independence|SI]]), [[Estat Català]] also support this idea to a greater or lesser extent.

The '''Commercial Revolution''' consisted in the creation of a European economy based on trade, which began in the 11th century and lasted until it was succeeded by the [[Industrial Revolution]] in the mid-18th century. Beginning with the [[Crusades]], Europeans rediscovered  [[spices]],  [[silk]]s, and other commodities rare in Europe. This development created a new desire for trade, and trade expanded in the second half of the [[Middle Ages]]. Newly forming European [[State (polity)|states]], through [[Age of Discovery|voyages of discovery]], were looking for alternative trade routes in the 15th and 16th centuries, which allowed the European powers to build vast, new [[international trade]] networks. Nations also sought new sources of wealth and practiced [[mercantilism]] and [[colonialism]]. The Commercial Revolution is marked by an increase in general commerce, and in the growth of financial services such as banking, insurance, and investing.

==Origins of the Commercial Revolution==
The term itself was used by Karl Polanyi in his ''The Great Transformation: "''Politically, the centralized state was a new creation called forth by the Commercial Revolution...".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Great Transformation: The Political and Economic Origins of Our Time|last=Polanyi|first=Karl|publisher=Beacon Press|year=1944/2001|isbn=978-0-8070-5643-1|location=Boston|pages=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later the economic historian [[Roberto Sabatino Lopez]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Robert Lopez |title=The Commercial Revolution of the Middle Ages |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=[New York] |year=1976 |pages=56–147 |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; used it to shift focus away from the English [[Industrial Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ejvind Damsgaard Hansen |title=European Economic History |publisher=Copenhagen Business School Press |location=[Copenhagen] |year=2001 |page=47 |isbn=87-630-0017-2 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his best-known book, ''The Commercial Revolution of the Middle Ages'' (1971, with numerous reprints), Lopez argued that the key contribution of the medieval period to [[European history]] was the creation of a commercial economy between the 10th and the 14th century, centered at first in the Italo-Byzantine eastern [[Mediterranean]], but eventually extending to the [[Italian city-states]] and over the rest of Europe. This kind of economy ran from approximately the 14th century through the 18th century.&lt;ref name="the_basics_of_economics"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = O'Connor | first1 = David Kevin | title = The basics of economics | year = 2004 | publisher = Greenwood Press | location = Westport, Conn.  | isbn = 978-0-313-32520-5|page = 48 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walt Whitman Rostow]] placed the beginning "arbitrarily" in 1488, the year the first European sailed around the [[Cape of Good Hope]].&lt;ref name="how_it_all_began_a04-107"&gt;{{Cite book  | last= Rostow | first= Walt Whitman  | title= How it all began : origins of the modern economy | year = 1975 | publisher = Methuen | location = London  | isbn = 978-0-416-55930-9 | page = 107 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most historians, including scholars such as Robert S.

===Maritime Republics and Communes===
{{see also|Maritime Republics|Medieval communes}}

[[File:Venezianische Kolonien.png|thumbnail|The [[Venetian Empire]].]]
[[Italy]] first felt huge economic changes in Europe from the 11th to the 13th centuries. Typically there was:
* a rise in population―the population doubled in this period (the demographic explosion)
* an emergence of huge cities (Venice, Florence and Milan had over 100,000 inhabitants by the 13th century in addition to many others such as [[Genoa]], [[Bologna]] and [[Verona]], which had over 50,000 inhabitants)
* the rebuilding of the great cathedrals
* substantial migration from country to city (in Italy the rate of urbanization reached 20%, making it the most urbanized society in the world at that time)
* an agrarian revolution
* the development of commerce

In recent writing on the city states, American scholar [[Rodney Stark]] emphasizes that they married responsive government, Christianity and the birth of capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;Stark, Rodney, ''The Victory of Reason'', New York, Random House, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  He argues that Italy consisted of mostly independent towns, who prospered through commerce based on early capitalist principles and kept both direct Church control and imperial power at arm's length.

Cambridge University historian and political philosopher Quentin Skinner&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, Quentin, ''The Foundations of Modern Political Thought'', vol I: ''The Renaissance''; vol II: ''The Age of Reformation'', Cambridge University Press, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; has pointed out how [[Otto of Freising]], a German bishop who visited central Italy during the 12th century, commented that Italian towns had appeared to have exited from feudalism, so that their society was based on merchants and commerce. Even northern cities and states were also notable for their [[merchant republics]], especially the [[Republic of Venice]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin, J. and Romano, D., Venice Reconsidered, Baltimore, Johns Hopkins University, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;  Compared to absolutist monarchies or other more centrally controlled states, the Italian communes and commercial republics enjoyed relative political freedom conducive to academic and artistic advancement. Geographically, and because of trade, Italian cities such as Venice became international trading and banking hubs and intellectual crossroads.

Harvard historian [[Niall Ferguson]]&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, Niall, ''The Ascent of Money: The Financial History of the World''.  Penguin, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; points out that Florence and Venice, as well as several other Italian city-states, played a crucial innovative role in world financial developments, devising the main instruments and practices of banking and the emergence of new forms of social and economic organization.

It is estimated that the per capita income of northern Italy nearly tripled from the 11th century to the 15th century. This was a highly mobile, demographically expanding society, fueled by the rapidly expanding [[Renaissance]] commerce.

In the 14th century, just as the Italian Renaissance was beginning, Italy was the economic capital of Western [[Europe]]: the Italian States were the top manufacturers of finished woolen products. However, with the [[Bubonic Plague]] in 1348, the birth of the English woolen industry and general warfare, Italy temporarily lost its economic advantage. However, by the late 15th century Italy was again in control of trade along the Mediterranean Sea. It found a new niche in luxury items like ceramics, glassware, lace and silk as well as experiencing a temporary rebirth in the woolen industry.

During the 11th century in northern Italy a new political and social structure emerged: the city-state or [[medieval commune|commune]]. The civic culture which arose from this ''[[urbs]]'' was remarkable. In some places where communes arose (e.g. Britain and France), they were absorbed by the monarchical state as it emerged.  They survived in northern and central Italy as in a handful of other regions throughout Europe to become independent and powerful city-states. In Italy the breakaway from their feudal overlords occurred in the late 12th century and 13th century, during the [[Investiture Controversy]] between the Pope and the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]: [[Milan]] led the Lombard cities against the Holy Roman Emperors and defeated them, gaining independence ([[battle of Legnano|battles of Legnano]], 1176, and [[battle of Parma|Parma]], 1248; see [[Lombard League]]).

Similar town revolts led to the foundation of city-states throughout medieval Europe, such as in Russia ([[Novgorod Republic]], 12th century), in Flanders ([[Battle of Golden Spurs]], 14th century) in Switzerland (the towns of the [[Old Swiss Confederacy]], 14th century), in Germany (the [[Hanseatic League]], 14th–15th century), and in [[Prussia]] ([[Thirteen Years' War (1454–66)|Thirteen Years' War]], 15th century).

Some Italian city-states became great military powers very early on. Venice and Genoa acquired vast naval empires in the Mediterranean and Black Seas, some of which threatened those of the growing Ottoman Empire.  During the [[Fourth Crusade]] (1204), Venice conquered a quarter of the Byzantine Empire.

The [[Maritime Republics]] were one of the main products of this new civic and social culture based on commerce and exchange of knowledge with other areas of the world outside western Europe. The [[Republic of Ragusa]] and the [[Republic of Venice]], for example, had important trade communications with the Muslim and Hindu world and this helped the initial development of the Italian [[Renaissance]].

By the late 12th century, a new and remarkable society had emerged in Northern Italy; rich, mobile, expanding, with a mixed aristocracy and urban ''borghese'' ([[:wikt:burgher|burgher]]) class, interested in urban institutions and republican government. But many of the new city-states also housed violent factions based on family, confraternity and brotherhood, who undermined their cohesion (for instance the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines]]).

[[Image:Italy 1494 shepherd.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Italy in 1494, after the [[Peace of Lodi]]]]

By 1300, most of these republics had become princely states dominated by a [[Signore]]. The exceptions were [[Republic of Venice|Venice]], [[Florence]], [[Lucca]], and a few others, which remained republics in the face of an increasingly monarchic Europe. In many cases by 1400 the Signori were able to found a stable dynasty over their dominated city (or group of regional cities), obtaining also a nobility title of sovereignty by their formal superior, for example in 1395 [[Gian Galeazzo Visconti]] bought for 100,000 gold [[Florin (Italian coin)|florins]] the title of [[Duke of Milan]] from the emperor [[Wenceslaus, King of the Romans|Wenceslaus]].

In the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, [[Milan]], [[Venice]], and [[Florence]] were able to conquer other city-states, creating regional states. The 1454 [[Peace of Lodi]] ended their struggle for hegemony in Italy, attaining a [[balance of power in international relations|balance of power]] and creating the conditions for the artistic and intellectual changes produced by the [[Italian Renaissance]].

==Colonialism and Mercantilism==
{{details|Mercantilism}} {{details|Age of Discovery}}
[[Image:Portuguese discoveries and explorationsV2en.png|thumb|300px|[[Portuguese discoveries]] and explorations from 1415 to 1543: first arrival places and dates; main Portuguese [[spice trade]] routes in the [[Indian Ocean]] (in blue); territories of the [[Portuguese Empire]] under the rule of [[King John III of Portugal|King John III]] (1521–1557) (in green).]] The deterioration of the climate that brought about the end of the medieval warm period (or medieval weather anomaly) caused an economic decline at the beginning of the 14th century (see [[Great Famine of 1315–17|Great Famine]]).  However, demographic expansion continued until the arrival of the [[Black Death]] epidemic in 1347, when ca. 50% of the European population was killed by the plague. The economic effects of a labor shortage actually caused wages to rise, while agricultural yields were once again able to support a diminished population. By the beginning of the 15th century, the economic expansion associated with the Commercial Revolution in earlier centuries returned in full force, aided by improvements in navigation and cartography.

Geopolitical, monetary, and technological factors drove the Age of Discovery. During this period (1450-17th century), the European economic center shifted from the Islamic [[Mediterranean]] to Western Europe (Portugal, Spain, France, the Netherlands, and to some extent England). This shift was caused by the successful [[circumnavigation]] of [[Africa]], which opened up sea-trade with the east: after Portugal's [[Vasco da Gama]] rounded the [[Cape of Good Hope]] and landed in [[Kozhikode|Calicut]], [[India]] in May 1498, a new path of eastern trade was possible, ending the monopoly of the Ottoman Turks and the Italian city-states.&lt;ref name=Columbia1&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/65/ga/Gama-Vas.html Gama, Vasco da. The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition. Columbia University Press.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214112314/http://www.bartleby.com/65/ga/Gama-Vas.html |date=2009-02-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The wealth of the [[Indies]] was now open for the Europeans to explore; the [[Portuguese Empire]] was one of the early European empires to grow from spice trade.&lt;ref name=Columbia1/&gt; Following this, Portugal became the controlling state for trade between east and west, followed later by the Dutch city of [[Antwerp]]. Direct maritime trade between [[Europe]] and China started in the 16th century, after the Portuguese established the settlement of [[Goa]], India in December 1510, and  thereafter that of [[Macau]] in southern China in 1557. Since the English came late to the transatlantic trade,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Fisk, John | publisher=Houton, Mifflin, and Company |page=14|year=1900 | title=Old Virginia and Her Neighbours }}&lt;/ref&gt; their commercial revolution was later as well.

===Geopolitical factors===
In 1453, the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] took over [[Constantinople]], which cut off (or significantly increased the cost of) overland trade routes between Europe and the [[Far East]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=New York: the World's Capital City, Its Development and Contributions to Progress |chapter=Chapter 1 |author=Rankin, Rebecca B., Cleveland Rodgers |publisher=Harper |year=1948}}&lt;/ref&gt; so alternative routes had to be found. English laws were changed to benefit the navy, but had commercial implications in terms of farming. These laws also contributed to the demise of the [[Hanseatic League]], which traded in northern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Growth of English Industry and Commerce in Modern Times | author= [[William Cunningham (economist)|Cunningham, William]]| page= 26 | year=1892 | publisher = University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the [[Reconquista]], the Spanish had a warrior culture ready to conquer still more people and places, so Spain was perfectly positioned to develop their [[Spanish Empire|vast overseas empire]].&lt;ref name="isbn0-449-90496-2"&gt;{{cite book |author=Weatherford, J. McIver |author-link=J. McIver Weatherford |title=Indian givers: how the Indians of the Americas transformed the world |publisher=Fawcett Columbine |location=New York |year=1988 |page=231 |isbn=0-449-90496-2 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Rivalry between the European powers produced intense competition for the creation of colonial empires, and fueled the rush to sail out of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Diamond | first1 = Jared M. | title = Guns, germs, and steel: the fates of human societies | year = 1997 | publisher = W.W. Norton | location = New York  | isbn = 0-393-03891-2 | pages =  }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Monetary factors===
The need for silver coinage also affected the desire for expanded exploration as silver and gold were spent for trade to the Middle and Far East. The Europeans had a constant deficit in that silver and gold coin only went one way: out of Europe, spent on the very type of trade that they were now cut off from by the Ottomans.

Another issue was that European mines were exhausted of silver ore and gold. What ore remained was too deep to recover, as water would fill the mine, and technology was not sufficiently advanced enough to successfully remove the water to get to the ore or gold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www-geology.ucdavis.edu/~cowen/~GEL115/115CH7.html | title=Exploiting the Earth | accessdate=2007-10-17 | author=Cowen, Richard | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009180929/http://www-geology.ucdavis.edu/~cowen/~GEL115/115CH7.html | archivedate=2007-10-09 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second argument is that trade during the youth of the Commercial Revolution blossomed not due to explorations for bullion (gold and silver coinings) but due to a new found faith in gold coinage. Italian city-states such as Genoa and Florence (where the first gold coins began to be minted in 1252) and kingdoms such as the Kingdom of Sicily routinely received gold through such trading partners as Tunisia and Senegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lopez|first1=Robert S.|title=Back to Gold, 1252|journal=The Economic History Review|date=1956|volume=9|issue=2|pages=219–240|doi=10.2307/2591743}}&lt;!--|accessdate=6 November 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; A new, stable and universally accepted coinage that was both compatible with traditional European coinage systems and serviced the increased demand for currency to facilitate trade made it even more lucrative to carry out trade with the rest of the world.

===Technological factors===
[[File:OrteliusWorldMap1570.jpg|thumb|In 1570 (May 20) Gilles Coppens de Diest at [[Antwerp]] published 53 maps created by [[Abraham Ortelius]] under the title ''[[Theatrum Orbis Terrarum]]'', considered the "first modern atlas".  Latin editions, besides Dutch, French and German editions appeared before the end of 1572; the atlas continued to be in demand till about 1612. This is the world map from this atlas.]]
From the 16th to 18th centuries, Europeans made remarkable maritime [[innovation]]s. These innovations enabled them to expand overseas and set up colonies, most notably during the 16th and 17th centuries. They developed new [[sail]] arrangements for ships, skeleton-based shipbuilding,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Marcus Rautman |title=Daily life in the Byzantine Empire |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=Westport, Conn |year=2006 |page=150 |isbn=0-313-32437-9 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Western “galea” (at the end of the 11th century), sophisticated navigational instruments, and detailed [[chart]]s and maps.
After Isaac Newton published the ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'', navigation was transformed, because sailors could predict the motion of the moon and other [[celestial object]]s using Newton's theories of motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Family Magazine| page=436 | year=1838 | publisher=Redfield &amp; Lindsay}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 1670, the entire world was measured using essentially modern latitude instruments. In 1676, the British Parliament declared that navigation was the greatest scientific problem of the age and in 1714 offered a substantial [[Longitude Prize|financial prize]] for the solution to finding longitude. This spurred the development of the [[marine chronometer]], the [[lunar distance method]] and the invention of the [[octant (instrument)|octant]] after 1730.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Haven, Kendall F. |title=100 Greatest Science Inventions of All Time |publisher=Libraries Unlimited |location=Littleton, Colo |year= 2006|page=69 |isbn= 1-59158-264-4 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 18th century, navigators replaced their prior instruments with octants and sextants.

===Important people===
Significant contributors to European exploration include Prince [[Henry the Navigator]] of Portugal, who was the first of the Europeans to venture out into the Atlantic Ocean, in 1420. Others are [[Bartolomeu Dias]], who first rounded the [[Cape of Good Hope]]; [[Vasco da Gama]], who sailed directly to India from Portugal; [[Ferdinand Magellan]], the first to circumnavigate the Earth; [[Christopher Columbus]], who significantly encountered the Americas; [[Jacques Cartier]], who sailed for France, looking for the [[Northwest Passage]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Jacques Cartier, his life and voyages |last = Pope | first = Joseph | publisher= Printed by A.S. Woodburn | year = 1890 | page = 49}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others.

===Key Features===
The economy of the [[Roman Empire]] had been based on [[Roman currency|money]], but after the Empire's fall, money became scarce; power and wealth became strictly land based, and local [[fief]]s were self-sufficient. Because trade was dangerous and expensive, there were not many traders, and not much trade. The scarcity of money did not help;&lt;ref name="webster"&gt;{{cite book |author=Webster, Hutton |title=Medieval and Modern History|pages= |publisher=D.C. Heath &amp; Co |year=1919 |location= Boston}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the European economic system had begun to change in the 14th century, partially as a result of the [[Black Death]], and the [[Crusades]].&lt;ref name="lewis"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lewis, Archibald|title=Nomads and Crusaders: AD 1000-1368.|date=January 1988|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-20652-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Banks, stock exchanges, and insurance became ways to manage the risk involved in the renewed trade. New laws came into being.{{clarify |date=July 2016 |reason= Which laws, and in which countries?}} Travel became safer as nations developed. Economic theories{{clarify |date=July 2016 |reason= Which theories?}} began to develop in light of all of the new trading activity. The increase in the availability of money led to the emergence of a new economic system, and new problems to go with it.{{clarify|date=July 2016}} The Commercial Revolution is also marked by the formalization of pre-existing, informal methods of dealing with trade and commerce.

===Inflation===
{{details|Price revolution}}
[[File:Potosì 8 reales 1768 131206.jpg|thumb|right|[[Potosí]] (Bolivia) [[silver]] 8 reales, Carlos III, 1768]]
[[File:doubloon.jpg|thumb|right|Spanish gold [[doubloon]] stamped as minted in 1798]]
[[Habsburg Spain|Spain]] legally amassed approximately 180 [[ton]]s of [[gold]] and 8200 tons of [[silver]] through its endeavors in the [[New World]], and another unknown amount through smuggling,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Walton, Timothy R. |title=The Spanish Treasure Fleets |publisher=Pineapple Press (FL) |location= |year= 1994|page=85 |isbn=1-56164-049-2 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; spending this money to finance wars and the arts. The spent silver, suddenly being spread throughout a previously cash starved Europe, caused widespread [[inflation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Tracy, James D. |title=Handbook of European History 1400-1600: Late Middle Ages, Renaissance, and Reformation |publisher=Brill Academic Publishers |location=Boston |year= 1994|page=655 |isbn=90-04-09762-7 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inflation was worsened by a growing population but a static production level, low employee salaries and a rising cost of living. This problem, combined with [[underpopulation]] (caused by the [[Black Death]]), affected the system of [[agriculture]]. The landholding aristocracy suffered under the inflation, since they depended on paying small, fixed wages to peasant tenants that were becoming able to demand higher wages.&lt;ref name = "Cunningham"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Growth of English Industry and Commerce in Modern Times | author= Cunningham, William| page= 15 | year=1892 | publisher = University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The aristocracy made failed attempts to counteract this situation by creating short-term leases of their lands to allow periodic revaluation of rent. The [[manorial system]] (manor system of lord and peasant tenant) eventually vanished, and the landholding [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrats]] were forced to sell pieces of their land in order to maintain their style of living.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Danbom, David B. |title=Born in the Country: A History of Rural America (Revisiting Rural America) |publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press |location=Baltimore |year=2006 |page=4 |isbn=0-8018-8459-4 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such sales attracted the rich [[bourgeois]] (from the French word referring to this dominant class, emerging with commerce), who wanted to buy land and thereby increase their social status.  Former "common lands" were fenced by the landed bourgeois, a process known as "[[enclosure]]" which increased the efficiency of raising livestock (mainly sheep's wool for the [[textile industry]]). This "enclosure" forced the peasants out of rural areas and into the cities, resulting in [[urbanization]] and eventually the [[industrial revolution]].

On the other hand, the increase in the availability of silver coin allowed for commerce to expand in numerous ways. Inflation was not all bad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Weatherford, J. McIver |author-link=J.

===Banks===
{{details|History of banking}}
[[Image:Matsys the moneylender.jpg|left|thumb|''The Moneylender and his Wife'' (1514)&lt;br/&gt; Oil on panel, 71 x 68 cm [[Musée du Louvre]], Paris]]
Various legal and religious developments in the late Middle Ages allowed for development of the modern banking system at the beginning of the 16th century. [[Interest]] was allowed to be charged, and [[Profit (economics)|profits]] generated from holding other people's money.

Banks in the Italian Peninsula had great difficulty operating at the end of the 14th century, for lack of silver and gold coin.&lt;ref name="isbn0-521-37590-8"&gt;{{cite book |author=Spufford, Peter |title=Money and its Use in Medieval Europe |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |year= 1993|page=349 |isbn=0-521-37590-8 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, by the later 16th century, enough bullion was available that many more people could keep a small amount hoarded and used as [[Capital (economics)|capital]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Growth of English Industry and Commerce in Modern Times | author= Cunningham, William| page= 14 | year=1892 | publisher = University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to this extra available money, northern European banking interests came along; among them was the [[Fugger]] family. The Fuggers were originally mine owners, but soon became involved in banking, charging interest, and other financial activities. They dealt with everyone, from small-time individuals, to the highest nobility. Their banks even loaned to the emperors and kings, eventually going [[bankrupt]] when their clients defaulted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Brechin, Gray A.|author-link=Gray Brechin|title=Imperial San Francisco: urban power, earthly ruin |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |year=1999 |pages= |isbn=0-520-22902-9 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This family, and other individuals, used Italian methods which outpaced the [[Hanseatic League]]'s ability to keep up with the changes occurring in northern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Growth of English Industry and Commerce in Modern Times | author= Cunningham, William| page= 24 | year=1892 | publisher = University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antwerp had one of the first money exchanges in Europe, a [[Exchange (organized market)|Bourse]], where people could change currency. After the [[Siege of Antwerp (1584-1585)]], the majority of business transactions were moved to Amsterdam. The [[Bank of Amsterdam]], following the example of a private [[Stockholm]] corporation, began issuing [[paper money]] to lessen the difficulty of trade, replacing metal (coin and bullion) in exchanges. In 1609 the ''[[Amsterdamsche Wisselbank]]'' (Amsterdam Exchange Bank) was founded which made Amsterdam the financial center of the world until the [[Industrial Revolution]]. In a notable example of crossover between stock companies and banks, the [[Bank of England]], which opened in 1694, was a joint-stock company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Keyser, Henry |title=The law relating to transactions on the stock exchange |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=1850 |page=1 |isbn= |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Banking offices were usually located near centers of trade, and in the late 17th century, the largest centers for commerce were the ports of [[Amsterdam]], [[London]], and [[Hamburg]]. Individuals could participate in the lucrative [[East India]] trade by purchasing bills of credit from these banks, but the price they received for commodities was dependent on the ships returning (which often did not happen on time) and on the cargo they carried (which often was not according to plan). The commodities market was very volatile for this reason, and also because of the many wars that led to cargo seizures and loss of ships.

===Managing risk===
Trade in this period was a risky business: war, weather, and other uncertainties often kept merchants from making a profit, and frequently an entire cargo would disappear all together. To mitigate this risk, the wealthy got together to share the risk through stock: people would own shares of a venture, so that if there was a loss, it would not be an all consuming loss costing the individual investor everything in one transaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Day, Clive |title=A History of Commerce | page=144 | publisher = Longmans, Green, and Co |year= 1914}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other ways of dealing with the risk and expense associated with all of the new trade activity include insurance and [[Joint-stock company|joint stock companies]] which were created as formal institutions. People had been informally sharing risk for hundreds of years, but the formal ways they were now sharing risk was new.&lt;ref name="isbn0-19-829508-1"&gt;{{cite book |author=Michie, R. C. |title=The London Stock Exchange: a history |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=1999 |page=34 |isbn=0-19-829508-1 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though the ruling classes would not often directly assist in trade endeavors, and individuals were unequal to the task,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Fisk, John | publisher=Houton, Mifflin, and Company |page=182|year=1900 | title=Old Virginia and Her Neighbours }}&lt;/ref&gt; rulers such as [[Henry VIII of England]] established a permanent Royal Navy, with the intention of reducing piracy, and protecting English shipping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Lindsay, William S. | title=History of Merchant Shipping and ancient commerce |publisher=Sampson Low, Marston, Low, and Searle | location=London |year=1872 |page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Joint stock companies and stock exchanges====
[[Image:Royal Exchange 1760.jpg|thumb|Plan of the London Royal Exchange in 1760]]
[[Stock exchange]]s were developed as the volume of stock transactions increased.  The London [[Royal Exchange (London)|Royal Exchange]] established in 1565 first developed as a securities market, though by 1801 it had become a stock exchange.&lt;ref name="isbn0-19-829508-1"/&gt;

Historian [[Fernand Braudel]] suggests that in [[Cairo]] in the 11th-century Muslim and Jewish merchants had already set up every form of [[trade association]] and had knowledge of every method of credit and payment, disproving the belief that these were invented later by Italians.  In 12th century [[France]] the ''courratiers de change'' were concerned with managing and regulating the debts of agricultural communities on behalf of the banks. Because these men also traded with debts, they could be called the first [[stockbroker|broker]]s.  In late 13th century [[Bruges]] commodity traders gathered inside the house of a man called ''Van der Beurse'', and in 1309 they became the "Bruges Beurse", institutionalizing what had been, until then, an informal meeting. The idea quickly spread around [[Flanders]] and neighboring counties and "Beurzen" soon opened in [[Ghent]] and [[Amsterdam]].&lt;ref name="common_sense_aint_common"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Shane Darrisaw | first1 = H. | title = Common Sense Ain't Common: A guide for positioning yourself to take full advantage of your credit and financial opportunities! | date =  | publisher = AuthorHouse | location =  | isbn = 1-4343-7559-5 | page = 86 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"In the middle of the 13th century [[Venice|Venetian]] bankers began to trade in [[Government debt|government securities]]. In 1351 the Venetian government outlawed spreading rumors intended to lower the price of government funds."&lt;ref name="common_sense_aint_common"/&gt; Bankers in [[Pisa]], [[Verona]], [[Genoa]] and [[Florence]] also began trading in government securities during the 14th century.  This practice was only possible, because these independent city states were not ruled by a duke but a council of influential citizens. The Dutch later started [[Joint-stock company|joint stock companies]], which let [[shareholder]]s invest in business ventures and get a share of their profits - or losses. In 1602, the [[Dutch East India Company]] issued the first shares on the [[Amsterdam Stock Exchange]]. It was the first company to issue stocks and bonds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | last = Chambers  | first = Clem | title = Who needs stock exchanges? | url = http://www.exchange-handbook.co.uk/index.cfm?section=articles&amp;action=detail&amp;id=60613 | publisher = Mondo Visione | date =  | accessdate = 25 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Amsterdam Stock Exchange]] (or Amsterdam Beurs) is also said to have been the first stock exchange to introduce continuous trade in the early 17th century.  The Dutch "pioneered [[Short (finance)|short selling]], [[Options strategies|option trading]], debt-equity swaps, [[merchant bank]]ing, unit [[Trust law|trusts]] and other [[Speculation|speculative instruments]], much as we know them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | last = Sayle | first = Murray | title = LRB · Murray Sayle: Japan goes Dutch | url = http://www.lrb.co.uk/v23/n07/sayl01_.html | publisher = ''London Review of Books'' XXIII.7 | date = 5 April 2001 | accessdate = 25 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Insurance companies====
[[image:Insurance Contact 2.jpg|thumb|right|A sample insurance contract. Documents such as this helped traders survive losses.]]
Insurance companies were another way to mitigate risk. [[Insurance]] in one form or another has been around as far back as there are records.  What differed about insurance going into the 16th and 17th centuries was that these informal mechanisms became formalized.

[[Lloyd's of London]] came into being in 1688 in English coffee shops that catered to sailors, traders, and others involved in trade. Lloyd's coffeehouse published a newspaper, which gave news from various parts of the world, and helped the underwriters of the insurance at the coffeehouse to determine the risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title= The History of Lloyd's and of Marine Insurance in Great Britain| author= Martin, Frederick|year=1876|publisher = MacMillan and Company, London|pages=65–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This innovation was one of many that allowed for the categorization of risk. Another innovation was the use of ship catalogs and classifications.

Other forms of insurance began to appear as well. After the [[Great Fire of London]], [[Nicholas Barbon]] began to sell fire insurance in 1667.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.london-fire.gov.uk/about_us/our_history/key_dates.asp |title=London Fire Brigade – History, key dates (Our history) |accessdate=2007-10-27 |work= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080618055617/http://www.london-fire.gov.uk/about_us/our_history/key_dates.asp |archivedate=2008-06-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laws were changed to deal with insurance issues, such as ''[[Ordinance of Marine|l'Ordonnance de la Marine]]'' (by Colbert in 1681).&lt;ref name="isbn1-84542-013-6"&gt;{{cite book |author=Smits, Jan |title=Elgar Encyclopedia of Comparative Law (Elgar Original Reference) |publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing |location= |year= 2006|page=315 |isbn=1-84542-013-6 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic theory===
{{details|History of Economic Thought}}

As the economy grew through the Commercial Revolution, so did attempts to understand and influence it. [[Economic theory]] as a separate subject of its own came into being as the stresses of the new global order brought about two opposing theories of how a nation accumulates wealth: [[mercantilism|mercantilistic]] and [[free-trade]] policies. Mercantilism inflamed the growing hostilities between the increasingly centralized European powers as the accumulation of precious metals by governments was seen as important to the prestige and power of a modern nation.  This involvement in accumulating gold and silver (among other things) became important in the development of the [[nation-state]].  Governments' involvement in trade affected the [[nobility]] of western European nations, because increased wealth by non-nobles threatened the nobility's place in society.

===Trade monopolies===
Governments became involved in trade directly through the granting of royal trade monopolies. For example, [[Walter Raleigh]] had been granted a trade monopoly by [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]], for the export of [[broadcloth]] and wine.&lt;ref name="isbn0-7656-0730-1"&gt;{{cite book |author=Markham, Jerry W. |title=A financial history of the United States |publisher=M.E. Sharpe |location=Armonk, N.Y. |year=2001 |page=22 |isbn=0-7656-0730-1 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ironically, competition between colonial powers led to their granting of trade monopolies to the [[East India Company|East India Companies]].

===Triangular trade===
A [[triangular trade]] occurred in this period: between Africa, North America, and England; and it worked in the following way: Slaves came from Africa, and went to the Americas; raw materials came from the Americas and went to Europe; from there, finished goods came from Europe and were sold back to the Americas at a much higher price.

Because of the [[Population history of American indigenous peoples#Depopulation from disease|massive die-off]] of the indigenous people, the [[Atlantic Slave Trade]] was established to import the labor required for the extraction of resources (such as gold and silver) and farming.

==Law==
Laws began to change to deal with commerce, both internationally, and locally within individual countries.

In France, for example, the [[Ordinance of Marine]] of Louis XIV was published under the auspices of Colbert in 1691, and was the first complete code of maritime and commercial law; and "when we consider the originality and extent of the design and the ability with which it is executed, we shall not hesitate to admit that it deserves to be ranked among the noblest works that legislative genius and learning have ever accomplished."
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = The law of insurance: a treatise on the law of insurance, including fire, life, accident, marine, casualty, title, credit and guarantee insurance in every form|
first =Charles Burke | last = Elliott|
publisher=Bobbs-Merrill| year = 1907| page = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In England, the [[Navigation Acts]] were among the British effort to regulate trade.

==Effects==
The Commercial Revolution, coupled with other changes in the [[Early Modern Period]], had dramatic effects on the globe. [[Christopher Columbus]] and the [[conquistador]]s, through their travels, were indirectly responsible for the [[Population history of American indigenous peoples#Depopulation from disease|massive depopulation]] of South America. They were directly responsible for destroying the civilizations of the [[Inca]], [[Aztec]], and [[Maya civilization|Maya]] in their quest to build the Spanish Empire. Other Europeans similarly affected the peoples of North America as well.

An equally important consequence of the Commercial Revolution was the [[Columbian Exchange]]. Plants and animals moved throughout the world due to human movements. For example, [[Yellow fever]], previously unknown in North and South America, was imported through water that ships took on in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Bergman | first = Leslie | title = History of colonization in South America | url = http://academic.sun.ac.za/forlang/bergman/real/mission/h_s-am.htm | publisher = Stellenbosch University, Stellenbosch, South Africa | date =  | accessdate = 25 October 2009 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100524174317/http://academic.sun.ac.za/forlang/bergman/real/mission/h_s-am.htm | archivedate = 24 May 2010 | df =  }}

Stellenbosch, South Africa's Department of Modern Foreign Languages's Historical Background article ''South America'' says: "Yellow fever was an uninvited "guest" brought to the Americas on the slave ships from West Africa. Yellow fever is caused by a virus spread by the bite of a species of mosquito native to West Africa, the ''[[aedes aegypti]]''. This mosquito was accidentally carried across the Atlantic in water barrels on the slave ships. Yellow fever struck communities from New York to Rio de Janeiro, but ''aedes aegypti'' flourished in tropical zones. The mosquito, and with it yellow fever, spread rapidly throughout the Amazon River valley. The disease was so lethal to Europeans, who had little immunity to it, that mass settlement of the Amazon region was not possible until present times."&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Cocoa bean|Cocoa]] (chocolate), [[coffee]], [[maize]], [[cassava]], and [[potato]]es moved from one hemisphere to the other.

For more than 2000 years, the [[Mediterranean Sea]] had been the focus of European trade with other parts of the world. After 1492, this focus shifted to the Atlantic Ocean by routes south around the [[Cape of Good Hope]], and by trans-Atlantic trade.

Another important change was the increase in population. Better food and more wealth allowed for larger families. The [[human migration|migration]] of peoples from Europe to the Americas allowed for European populations to increase as well. [[Population growth]] provided the expanding labor force needed for [[industrialization]].

Another important outcome of Europe's commercial revolution was a foundation of wealth needed for the [[industrial revolution]].&lt;ref name="how_it_all_began_a04-225"&gt;{{Cite book  | title = How it all began: origins of the modern economy | year = 1975 | publisher = Methuen | location = London  | isbn = 0-416-55930-1 | page = 225  | last= Rostow | first= Walt Whitman }}&lt;/ref&gt; Economic prosperity financed new forms of [[Western culture|cultural]] expression during this period.

'''Croatian Nobles Square''' ({{lang-hr|Trg hrvatskih velikana}}) is one of the central squares in [[Zagreb]]. It was designed in 1923 urban plan as entry to the then new eastern part of the town. Draškovićeva street is on the western side of the square, Martićeva street begins on the north side, while a road and tram line go through the middle of the square to the Rački street and [[Square of the Victims of Fascism]].

==About==
Area of present-day square wasn't urbanized until the end of the First World War and was used as a fairground.

The square is formed by two symmetrically placed monumental palaces that were constructed in 1927; first is the Palace of the Exchange (work of architect [[Viktor Kovačić]]), today used by the [[Croatian National Bank]], and the second Palace (work of the architect [[Aladar Baranyai]]), today used by the State Office for Croats Abroad.

The western side of the square consists of a four-store terraced houses that go along the Draškovićeva street. At the corner of the Jurišićeva street is 1929 residential-office-commercial building (work by modernist architect [[Bela Auer]]), and next to it is a 1931 building (work by architect Paul Deutsch). On the north side of the square on the corner of Draškovićeva street is a 1928 commercial and residential building Janeković (work by architect [[Hugo Ehrlich]]). Next to it is a series of buildings that continue to Martićeva street.

In 1995, square was decorated with two large triangular fountains in front of the building of the Croatian National Bank and the State Office for Croats Abroad (work of architect Mihajlo Kranjc).

==Former names==
Being one of the most prominent squares in Zagreb its name was often changed in accordance to political circumstances of the time:
*1928&amp;ndash;1940 ''Trg burze'' ([[Exchange (organized market)|Exchange]] Square)
*1941&amp;ndash;1945 ''Trg münchenskih žrtava'' (Square of [[Beer Hall Putsch|Munich victims]])
*1946&amp;ndash;1989 ''Trg Jože Vlahovića'' ([[Joža Vlahović]] Square)
*1990&amp;ndash;2000 ''Trg burze'' ([[Exchange (organized market)|Exchange]] Square)
*2001&amp;ndash;present ''Trg hrvatskih velikana '' (Croatian Nobles Square)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1853">The '''religious capital''' or '''ecclesiastical capital''' of a region is a place considered pre-eminent by the adherents of a particular religion within that region. This is most often significant for the region's predominant religion or [[state religion]], if any. The administrative headquarters of an organised religion may be centralised in a particular location; for example, [[Rome]] for the [[Catholic Church]], or [[Salt Lake City]] for [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]. In an [[episcopal polity|episcopal]] church, the site of the [[cathedral]] of the [[primate (bishop)|primate bishop]] of an area may be considered its ecclesiastical capital; for example, [[Armagh]] is the seat of the [[Primacy of Ireland|primate of All Ireland]] in both the Catholic church and the Anglican church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discovernorthernireland.com/Armagh-the-Ecclesiastical-Capital-of-Ireland-A1008|title=Armagh, the Ecclesiastical Capital of Ireland|publisher=Northern Ireland Tourist Board|accessdate=7 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other places may be considered religious capitals by being centres of learning, such as [[Qom]] for [[Shia Islam]] in [[Iran]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aawsat.com/english/news.asp?section=2&amp;id=18021|title=Qom and Tehran: Two Different Attitudes and Directions|last=Mohajerani|first=Ataollah|date=6 September 2009|work=Asharq Alawsat|accessdate=7 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; or places of [[pilgrimage]], such as [[Varanasi]] for [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4784056.stm|title=The religious capital of Hinduism|last=Majumdar|first=Debabani|date=7 March 2006|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=7 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Erik Achille Marie Swyngedouw''' ({{IPA-nl|ˈeːrɪk ˈsʋɪŋɣədʌu|pron}}; born 30 July 1956) is professor of geography at the [[University of Manchester]] in the School of Environment, Education and Development and a member of the Manchester Urban Institute. 

==Background==
Born in Dutch-speaking [[Belgium]] and fluent in Dutch, English, French, and Spanish, he graduated from Sint-Jozefscollege, [[Hasselt]] in 1974. He graduated with an MSc in Agricultural Engineering from the [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven|Catholic University of Leuven]] in 1979, with a thesis focussed on agrarian change in the community of [[Heers]]. His 1985 Master in Urban and Regional Planning was also from Leuven. He earned his PhD with a thesis entitled "The production of new spaces of production" under the supervision of the renowned Marxist geographer [[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]] at [[Johns Hopkins University]] in 1991. From 1988 until 2006 Swyngedouw taught at the [[University of Oxford]], latterly as professor of geography and was a fellow of [[St Peter's College, Oxford|St. Peter's College]]. He is currently Professor of Human Geography at the [[University of Manchester]], England. He is also visiting professor at the [[University of Ghent]], Belgium. He has worked and taught in the USA, France, Belgium, Spain, Germany, Ecuador, and Greece&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cades.be%2Fckfinder%2Fuserfiles%2Ffiles%2FSwyngedouwCV.docx] {{dead link|date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarship==
Swyngedouw has committed his studies to [[political economy|political economic]] analysis of contemporary capitalism, producing several major works on economic [[globalisation]], [[regional development]], finance, and [[urbanisation]]. His interests have also included [[political ecology|political-ecological themes]], and the transformation of nature, urban governance, politics of scale, notably water issues, in Ecuador, Spain, the UK, and elsewhere in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sed.manchester.ac.uk/geography/staff/swyngedouw_erik.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090825053821/http://www.sed.manchester.ac.uk/geography/staff/swyngedouw_erik.htm |archivedate=25 August 2009 |df=dmy-all }} &lt;/ref&gt; His recent work focuses on the democratic politics and the strategies and tactics of new political movements, and the political ecology of desalination. He has published over 100 academic papers in leading academic journals in geography and cognate disciplines and in scholarly books.

The '''extreme points of Norway''' include the [[geographic coordinate system|coordinates]] that are farther north, south, east or west than any other location in [[Norway]]; and the highest and the lowest altitudes in the country. The northernmost point is [[Rossøya]] on [[Svalbard]], the southernmost is [[Pysen]] in [[Mandal, Norway|Mandal]], the easternmost is [[Kræmerpynten]] on Svalbard, and the westernmost is [[Høybergodden]] on [[Jan Mayen]].&lt;ref name=statkart&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.statkart.no/?module=Articles;action=Article.publicShow;ID=11577 |title=Ytterpunkter for kongeriket Norge |author=[[Norwegian Mapping Authority]] |accessdate=7 February 2009 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Does not cover the Antarctic claims --&gt; The highest peak is [[Galdhøpiggen]], standing at {{convert|2469|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} [[above mean sea level]], while the lowest elevation is sea level at the coast.&lt;ref name=ciano&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/no.html |title=Norway |author=[[Central Intelligence Agency]] |date=5 February 2009 |accessdate=7 February 2009 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--High and low, Norway--&gt;

The [[Norwegian Antarctic Territory]]—consisting of [[Queen Maud Land]], [[Peter I Island]] and [[Bouvet Island]]—are not part of the Kingdom of Norway. Norway administrates the claims based on the [[Antarctic Treaty System]]; therefore they are sometimes considered part of a wider definition of Norway.&lt;ref name=ssb&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ssb.no/aarbok/geografi.html |title=Oversikt over geografiske forhold |author=[[Statistics Norway]]  |year=2008 |accessdate=7 February 2009 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Defines the kingdom and biland--&gt; If included, the Norwegian Antarctic Territory accounts the southernmost, easternmost, westernmost and highest extreme points.&lt;ref name=lov&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lovdata.no/all/tl-19300227-003-0.html |title=Lov om Bouvet-øya, Peter I's øy og Dronning Maud Land m.m.

The latitude and longitude are expressed in [[minute of arc|degrees, minutes and seconds]], in which an "N" value refers to the northern hemisphere, and an "S" value refers to the southern hemisphere. Similarly, a "E" longitude value refers to the eastern hemisphere, and a "W" refers to the western hemisphere. The extreme points of latitude and longitude are published by the [[Norwegian Mapping Authority]], while the elevations are published by the [[World Fact Book]]. Both make use of the [[World Geodetic System]] (WGS) 84, a [[geodetic reference system]].

==Latitude and longitude==
[[File:Knivskjellodden 2005-07-18.JPG|thumb|Knivskjellodden is the northernmost point of Norway proper]]

For the Kingdom of Norway, the northernmost point is [[Rossøya]], just north of [[Nordaustlandet]] on the Svalbard archipelago, bordering the [[Barents Sea]]. The southernmost point is Pysen in Mandal bordering [[Skagerrak]]—the only latitude and longitude extreme point that is in Norway proper. The easternmost location is [[Kræmerpynten]] on Svalbard, bordering the Barents Sea, while the westernmost point is Høybergodden on Jan Mayen, bordering the [[Greenland Sea]].&lt;ref name=statkart /&gt;

All four latitude and longitude extreme points are bordering the sea; due to the geographic nature of the coastline, all extremities are located on islands. Therefore, extreme points of the Norwegian mainland are also included in the list. The northernmost point is [[Knivskjellodden]], located in [[Magerøya]] in [[Finnmark]]. The northernmost mainland point is [[Cape Nordkinn]], located in [[Lebesby]], Finnmark; this is also the northernmost location of mainland Europe. Both border the Barents Sea. The southernmost location of Norway proper is Pysen, while the southernmost mainland location is [[Lindesnes]]; both border Skagerrak. The easternmost point is [[Hornøya (Finnmark)|Hornøya]], with [[Kibergsneset]] being the easternmost mainland location. Both are in [[Vardø]] in Finnmark. The westernmost location is [[Holmebåen]] in [[Solund]], [[Sogn og Fjordane]], while the westernmost mainland location is [[Vardetangen]] in [[Austrheim]], [[Hordaland]]. Both border the [[North Sea]].&lt;ref name=statkart /&gt;

If Antarctica is included, the southernmost point is the [[South Pole]]. All seven Antarctic claims meet there, so this point borders all other six territories. The easternmost point is the border between Queen Maud Land and the [[Australian Antarctic Territory]], which follows the [[45th meridian east]].&lt;ref name=lov /&gt; The westernmost point is [[Peter I Island]]. As the only Antarctic claim that is not a sector, it borders the [[Amundsen Sea]].&lt;ref name=peter&gt;{{cite web |url=http://geonames.usgs.gov/pls/gnispublic/f?p=gnispq:5:::NO::P5_ANTAR_ID:11653 |title=Peter I Island |author=[[Geographic Names Information System]] |date= |accessdate=7 February 2009 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Peter I Island--&gt;

At 256 feet, '''Fall Creek Falls''' is the highest free-fall waterfall east of the [[Mississippi River]]. The falls are located near Spencer, Tennessee in [[Fall Creek Falls State Park]]. A short trail leads from the parking lot atop the plateau down to the base of the gorge, giving access to the waterfall's plungepool. When water flow is sufficient, [[Coon Creek Falls]] shares a plungepool.

[[File:EritreaOMC.png|thumb|Eritrea's cities, towns and highest peaks]]
[[File:Un-eritrea.png|thumb|right|250px|UN map of Eritrea]]
[[Eritrea]] is located in the [[Horn of Africa]] and is bordered on the northeast and east by the [[Red Sea]], on the west and northwest by [[Sudan]], on the south by [[Ethiopia]], and on the southeast by [[Djibouti]]. The country has a high central plateau that varies from {{convert|1,800|to(-)|3,000|m|ft|0|sp=us}} [[above sea level]]. A coastal plain, western lowlands, and some 350 islands comprise the remainder of Eritrea's land mass. Eritrea has no year-round rivers.

== Climate ==
[[File:Eritrea map of Köppen climate classification.svg|thumb|Climate zones of Eritrea]]
The climate of Eritrea is shaped by its diverse topography and its location within the tropics. 
The diversity in landscape and topography in the highlands and lowlands of Eritrea result in the diversity of climate across the 
country. The highlands  have temperate climate throughout out the year. The climate of most lowland zones is arid and semiarid. The distribution of rainfall and vegetation types varies markedly throughout the country. Eritrean climate varies on the basis of seasonal and altitudinal differences. Based on variations in temperature Eritrea can be broadly divided into three major climate zones: a temperate zone, a subtropical climate zone and a tropical climate zone.&lt;ref name=Mussie&gt;{{cite book|author=Mussie Tesfagiorgis G.|title=Eritrea|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f0R7iHoaykoC&amp;pg=PA10 |year=2010 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-1-59884-232-6 |pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eritrea can be divided into three major climate zones : the central highlands, the coastal region, and the western lowlands. Each has a different climate pattern. According to [[Köppen climate classification]], Eritrea have either a [[hot semi-arid climate]] (''BSh'') or a [[hot desert climate]] (''BWh''), although temperatures are much moderated at the highest elevations.&lt;ref name=Mussie/&gt;

In the central highlands, the hottest month is usually May to June with highs around 27&amp;nbsp;°C (80.6&amp;nbsp;°F) to 30&amp;nbsp;°C (86&amp;nbsp;°F). Winter is between December and February with lows at night that can be near freezing point. [[Asmara]] itself enjoys a pleasant climate all year round, although it can be quite cold at night in winter. There are two rainy seasons: the short rains in March and April and the main rains from late June to the beginning of September.
Over there, the climate is usually sunny and dry as sunshine durations turn around 3,000 h and averages annual rainfall hover around 500&amp;nbsp;mm (19.68&amp;nbsp;in).&lt;ref name=Mussie/&gt;
 
On the coast along the [[Red Sea]], the summertime is long, from June to September and extremely hot with averages high temperatures ranging from 40&amp;nbsp;°C (104&amp;nbsp;°F) to 46&amp;nbsp;°C (114.8&amp;nbsp;°F), and it's even hotter in Denkalia. The wintertime is nearly non-existent and averages high temperatures remain above 28&amp;nbsp;°C (82.4&amp;nbsp;°F) during the least hot month of the year and averages low temperatures exceed 20&amp;nbsp;°C (68&amp;nbsp;°F). The rainy season along the coast north of [[Denkalia]] falls during the winter months but rainy days still remain scarce ; rainfall is even more rare in Denkalia Region. The climate is always sunny and dry in this zone and cloudy days are rare.&lt;ref name=Mussie/&gt;

In the western lowlands, the high temperatures are comparable to those on the coast in the hottest months of April until June. December is the coolest month with averages low temperatures falling as low as 15&amp;nbsp;°C (59&amp;nbsp;°F). The rainy seasons are the same as for the highlands.&lt;ref name=Mussie/&gt;

{{hatnote|This article describes the [[geography]] of [[Grenada]].}}
'''Grenada''' is a [[Caribbean Sea|Caribbean]] [[island]] (one of the [[Grenadines]]) between the Caribbean Sea and [[Atlantic Ocean]], north of [[Trinidad and Tobago]].  It is located at {{coord|12|07|N|61|40|W|}}.  There are no large inland bodies of water on the island, which consists entirely of the state of Grenada.  The coastline is 121&amp;nbsp;km long.

The island has 15 constituencies and speaks English. It is volcanic in origin and its topography/landscape is mountainous.

[[Natural resource]]s include [[timber]], tropical [[fruit]] and deepwater [[harbor]]s.

Grenada and its largely uninhabited outlying territories are the most southerly of the Windward Islands. The Grenadine Islands chain consists of some 600 islets; those south of the [[Martinique Channel]] belong to Grenada, while those north of the channel are part of the nation of St. Vincent and the Grenadines. Located about 160 kilometers north of Venezuela, at approximately 12° north latitude and 61° west longitude, Grenada and its territories occupy a small area of 433 square kilometers. Grenada, known as the Spice Isle because of its production of nutmeg and mace, is the largest at 310 square kilometers, or about the size of Detroit. The island is oval shaped and framed by a jagged southern coastline; its maximum width is thirty-four kilometers, and its maximum length is nineteen kilometers. [[St. George's, Grenada|St. George's]], the capital and the nation's most important harbor, is favorably situated near a lagoon on the southwestern coast. Of all the islands belonging to Grenada, only two are of consequence: Carriacou, with a population of a few thousand, and its neighbor Petit Martinique, roughly 40 kilometers northeast of Grenada and populated by some 700 inhabitants.

Part of the volcanic chain in the Lesser Antilles arc, Grenada and its possessions generally vary in elevation from under 300 meters to over 600 meters above sea level. Grenada is more rugged and densely foliated than its outlying possessions, but other geographical conditions are more similar. Grenada's landmass rises from a narrow, coastal plain in a generally north-south trending axis of ridges and narrow valleys. [[Mount Saint Catherine (Grenada)|Mount St. Catherine]] is the highest peak at 840 meters.

Although many of the rocks and soils are of volcanic origin, the volcanic cones dotting Grenada are long dormant. The only known active volcano in the area is [[Kick 'em Jenny]], just north between Grenada and Carriacou. Some of the drainage features on Grenada remain from its volcanic past. There are a few crater lakes, the largest of which is Grand Etang. The swift upper reaches of rivers, which occasionally overflow and cause flooding and landslides, generally cut deeply into the conic slopes. By contrast, many of the water courses in the lowlands tend to be sluggish and meandering.

== Climate == 
 
The Grenadan climate is tropical, tempered by northeast [[trade winds]].  The land is [[volcano|volcanic]] in origin with [[mountain]]s in the interior.  The lowest point is at [[sea level]], and the highest is {{convert|840|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} on [[Mount Saint Catherine, Grenada|Mount Saint Catherine]].
 
The abundance of water is primarily caused by the tropical, wet climate. Yearly precipitation, largely generated by the warm and moisture-laden northeasterly trade winds, varies from more than {{convert|3500|mm|in|1|sp=us}} on the windward mountainsides to less than {{convert|1500|mm|in|1|sp=us}} in the lowlands. The greatest monthly totals are recorded throughout Grenada from June through November, the months when tropical storms and hurricanes are most likely to occur. Rainfall is less pronounced from December through May, when the equatorial low-pressure system moves south. Similarly, the highest humidities, usually close to 80 percent, are recorded during the rainy months, and values from 68 to 78 percent are registered during the drier period. Temperatures averaging {{convert|29|°C|1}} are constant throughout the year, however, with slightly higher readings in the lowlands. Nevertheless, diurnal ranges within a 24-hour period are appreciable: between {{convert|26|and|32|°C|°F|1}} during the day and between {{convert|19|and|24|°C|°F|1}} at night.

'''Gimbal''' is a [[Santa Monica]], [[California|CA]]-based mobile advertising, location [[solution]]s, and data company. The company develops technology that allows its customers to deliver custom content to audiences either via [[advertising]] or [[push notifications]].

Gimbal consists of two formerly independent companies: The Mobile Majority and Gimbal, Inc. In December 2016, Gimbal, Inc. was acquired by Santa Monica-based The Mobile Majority,&lt;ref name=sdut&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/business/sd-fi-gimbal-beacons-20161205-story.html|title= Qualcomm spin-off Gimbal acquired by LA mobile ad firm |website=sandiegouniontribune.com|date=2016-12-05|accessdate=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in April 2017 the company changed its name to Gimbal.

== History ==

Gimbal was originally part of San Diego-based chip manufacturer [[Qualcomm]], and launched its first products as Qualcomm Retail Solutions.&lt;ref name=fiercewireless&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.fiercewireless.com/story/qualcomm-spins-gimbal-beacon-technology-separate-company/2014-05-01|title= Qualcomm spins off Gimbal beacon technology into a separate company|publisher=fiercewireless.com |date=2014-05-01|accessdate=2015-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the early customers was the [[Sacramento Kings]] basketball team, who used beacon technology to send mobile offers and communications to fans attending games at the team's arena.&lt;ref name="nba.com"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.nba.com/kings/news/sacramento-kings-implementing-cutting-edge-technology-enhance-fan-experience-0
|title= Sacramento Kings Implementing Cutting-Edge Technology to Enhance the Fan Experience|publisher=nba.com |date=2014-04-17|accessdate=2015-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2014, Qualcomm announced that it was spinning off the business unit to outside investors, which included individuals as well as the i-Hatch LBS Fund, a fund created with investments from companies including [[Zebra Technologies]], [[Anschutz Entertainment Group|AEG]] and [[SK Group#Member companies|SK Planet]].&lt;ref name="fiercewireless"/&gt;&lt;ref name=vrworld&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.vrworld.com/2014/05/28/qualcomm-spins-gimbal-business-unit/|title= Qualcomm Spins off Gimbal Business Unit into Gimbal, Inc.|publisher=VR World|date=2014-05-28|accessdate=2015-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Qualcomm reportedly kept a substantial but non-controlling interest. The transaction was completed in May, and Rocco Fabiano was named the company's first CEO.&lt;ref name=sdunion1&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/2014/oct/16/Gimbal-qualcomm-apple-ibeacon-privacy-Padres/|title= Gimbal betting on beacons |publisher=San Diego Union Tribune|date=2014-10-16|accessdate=2015-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In October, baseball and football teams were using Gimbal's technology to communicate with fans, including giving messages about shorter concession lines at the stadiums.&lt;ref name="sdunion1"/&gt;  Also that month, a pilot advertising program in New York City launched where beacons were installed in phone booths, to reach pedestrians.  The program was shut down because the installer, New York based transit advertising company [[Titan (transit advertising company)|Titan]], now Sidewalk Labs, a subsidiary of [[Google]], had not received the necessary approvals from the City.&lt;ref name=wsj&gt;{{cite web|url=
https://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2014/10/07/new-york-city-shuts-down-unauthorized-sensors/|title= New York City Shuts Down Unauthorized Sensors  |publisher=Wall Street Journal|date=2014-10-07|accessdate=2015-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2015, the company announced firmware to turn any Bluetooth LE device into a beacon.&lt;ref name=fiercewireless2&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.fiercewireless.com/tech/story/gimbal-wants-turn-bluetooth-le-devices-beacons/2015-06-04|title= Gimbal wants to turn Bluetooth LE devices into beacons |publisher=fiercewireless.com|date=2015-06-04|accessdate=2015-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July, Jeff Russakow became the company's new CEO, and Rocco Fabiano, who had led the transition of Gimbal out of Qualcomm, assumed the role of Chairman.&lt;ref name=fierceretail&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.fierceretail.com/mobileretail/story/gimbal-names-new-ceo/2015-07-28|title=Gimbal names new CEO|publisher=fierceretail.com |date=2015-07-28|accessdate=2015-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By then, Gimbal reportedly  had the largest deployment of Bluetooth beacons in the US.&lt;ref name="fierceretail"/&gt; Also in July, the company introduced a low cost, [[USB]]-powered Bluetooth beacon to add beacon functionality to devices with USB ports, such as vending machines.&lt;ref name=geomarketing&gt;{{cite web|url=https://geomarketing.com/gimbals-smaller-battery-free-beacons-connect-directly-to-cash-registers |title=Gimbal’s Smaller Battery-Free Beacons Connect Directly To Cash Registers  |publisher=geomarketing.com |date=2015-07-08 |accessdate=2018-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August, the company announced a partnership with '''do it outdoors''', a mobile media company, to create a fleet of roving proximity ads.&lt;ref name=mediapost&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/256436/gimbal-partners-with-do-it-outdoors-media-to-promo.html?edition=85416|title= Gimbal Partners With Do It Outdoors Media To Promote Beacon Tech|publisher=mediapost.com |date=2014-08-18|accessdate=2015-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Consumers with the correct app on their phone and within 50 meters of a beacon would receive push notifications.&lt;ref name="mediapost"/&gt;

In December 2016, Gimbal was acquired by Santa Monica-based The Mobile Majority, reportedly in order to better target consumers with mobile advertising campaigns.&lt;ref name=sdut/&gt;  The Mobile Majority then changed its name to Gimbal.

== Products ==
{{refimprove|section|date=June 2018}}
Gimbal products include the following:

*Mobile Advertising Platform - A technology that builds and serves mobile ads across mobile apps and websites
*Location Management Platform - A mobile engagement platform combining location geofences and proximity beacons with software, hardware, analytics tools and a management portal
*Gimbal Beacons - The company markets beacons with its own beacon technology and also supports Apple's [[iBeacon]] technology, both which use Bluetooth Smart [[Bluetooth Low Energy]] technology.  A low cost USB-powered beacon is called the U-Series 5.&lt;ref name=geomarketing/&gt;  The company also licenses its technology [[firmware]] for integration into third party Bluetooth-enabled devices.
*Integration services - Gimbal offers integration services with other marketing platforms including [[Marketo]] and [[Adobe Marketing Cloud]].

== Markets ==
The company targets four areas with its beacon technology:

* Venues - Stadiums, arenas, concert halls and other venues deploy beacons to create personalized mobile experiences for fans.&lt;ref name=urbanairship&gt;{{cite web|url= http://urbanairship.com/blog/2014/10/16/us-open-app-serves-up-beacon-and-location-targeted-messages|title= US Open App Serves up Beacon and Location-Targeted Messages|publisher=urbanairship.com |date=2014-10-16|accessdate=2015-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Retailers - Beacons are used by retailers to engage and educate shoppers, and traffic analytics can offer additional market intelligence.&lt;ref name=pymnts&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.pymnts.com/news/social-commerce/2015/how-one-beacon-platform-bridges-retails-digital-and-physical-world/#.Vd9QXZeVLTo|title= How Gimbal Connects Retail’s Digital And Physical World|publisher=pymnts.com |date=2015-05-05|accessdate=2015-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Advertising - Beacons are used to send targeted ads to local shoppers.&lt;ref name="mediapost"/&gt;
* Solution Providers - Gimbal offers a software development kit [[software development kit|SDK]] for developers who want to add beacons to third party applications.&lt;ref name=slashgear&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.slashgear.com/shazam-gimbal-partner-for-location-based-music-suggestions-12364122/|title= Shazam, Gimbal partner for location-based music suggestions|publisher=slashgear.com |date=2015-01-12|accessdate=2015-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Privacy concerns ==
Gimbal's technology has raised security concerns related to customer privacy.  Unlike GPS, which isn't very accurate, and doesn't work indoors or in dense cities, beacons have more precise location sensing capabilities.  Analysts have been quoted as saying that wider adoption of the technology requires addressing these concerns.&lt;ref name="sdunion1"/&gt;  In interviews, the company described how it was addressing these concerns, by only allowing their beacons to work with Gimbal-enabled apps that consumers download to their smartphones. Unlike some other beacon technology, it was reported that Gimbal's beacons will not connect to a phone that isn't running a specific app.  The company also announced that they have developed a rolling encrypted code to ensure only users with the correct privileges can see the beacon's information,&lt;ref name="sdunion1"/&gt; and that their technology is [[TRUSTe]]-certified.  The company also sits on the board advisory committee for the Washington, DC-based [[Future of Privacy Forum]], an organization with the stated mission to promote responsible data practices.&lt;ref name="fiercewireless2"/&gt;

The '''history of navigation''' is the history of [[seamanship]], the art of directing [[Marine vessel|vessels]] upon the open sea through the establishment of its position and course by means of traditional practice, geometry, astronomy, or special instruments. A few people have excelled as seafarers, prominent among them the [[Austronesians]], their descendants the [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]], [[Micronesian people|Micronesians]], and [[Polynesians]], the [[Indus Valley Civilization|Harappans]], the [[Phoenicians]], the [[ancient Greeks]], the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], the [[Arabs]], the ancient [[Tamils|Indians]], the [[Norsemen|Norse]], the [[Chinese people|Chinese]], the [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]], the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]], the [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic Germans]], the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]], the [[Spanish people|Spanish]], the [[English people|English]], the [[French people|French]], the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] and the [[Danes]].
==Antiquity==&lt;!-- Up to 600 AD per article --&gt;
===Pacific Ocean===
{{Main article|Polynesian navigation}}

Navigation in the Pacific began at some point between about 3000 and 1000 BC, by [[Austronesians]] from [[Taiwan]]. By about 900 BC their descendants had spread more than 6,000 kilometers across the Pacific, reaching [[Tonga]] and [[Samoa]]. In this region, a distinctive [[Polynesian culture]] developed. Within the next few centuries Polynesians reached [[New Zealand]], [[Easter Island]] and possibly [[South America]].

Polynesian navigators used a range of tools and methods, including observation of birds, star navigation, and use of waves and swells to detect nearby land. Songs, mythological stories, and star charts were used to help people remember important navigational information. 

===Mediterranean===
Sailors navigating in the Mediterranean made use of several techniques to determine their location, including staying in sight of land and understanding of the winds and their tendencies. [[Minoans]] of [[Crete]] are an example of an early Western civilization that used celestial navigation. Their palaces and mountaintop [[sanctuaries]] exhibit architectural features that align with the rising sun on the [[equinoxes]], as well as the rising and setting of particular stars.&lt;ref&gt;Bloomberg, 1678:793&lt;/ref&gt; The Minoans made sea voyages to the island of [[Santorini|Thera]] and to [[Egypt]].&lt;ref name="Bloomberg, 1997:77"&gt;Bloomberg, 1997:77&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these trips would have taken more than a day's sail for the Minoans and would have left them traveling by night across open water.&lt;ref name="Bloomberg, 1997:77"/&gt; Here the sailors would use the locations of particular stars, especially those of the constellation [[Ursa Major]], to orient the ship in the correct direction.&lt;ref name="Bloomberg, 1997:77"/&gt;

Written records of navigation using stars, or [[celestial navigation]], go back to [[Homer]]'s [[Odyssey]] where [[Calypso (mythology)|Calypso]] tells [[Odysseus]] to keep the Bear (Ursa Major) on his left hand side and at the same time to observe the position of the [[Pleiades]], the late-setting [[Boötes]] and the [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]] as he sailed eastward from her island [[Ogygia]] traversing the Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;Homer, Odyssey, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hom.+Od.+5.270&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0136 273-276]&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Greeks|Greek]] poet [[Aratus]] wrote in his ''Phainomena'' in the third century BC detailed positions of the constellations as written by [[Eudoxus of Cnidus|Eudoxos]].&lt;ref name="Bloomberg, 1997:72"&gt;Bloomberg, 1997:72&lt;/ref&gt; The positions described do not match the locations of the stars during Aratus' or Eudoxos' time for the Greek mainland, but some argue that they match the sky from [[Crete]] during the [[Bronze Age]].&lt;ref name="Bloomberg, 1997:72"/&gt; This change in the position of the stars is due to the [[Polar motion|wobble of the Earth]] on its axis which affects primarily the [[pole stars]].&lt;ref name="Taylor, 1971:12"&gt;Taylor, 1971:12&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1000 BC the constellation [[Draco (constellation)|Draco]] would have been closer to the [[North Pole]] than [[Polaris]].&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, 1971:10&lt;/ref&gt; The pole stars were used to navigate because they did not disappear below the horizon and could be seen consistently throughout the night.&lt;ref name="Taylor, 1971:12"/&gt;

By the third century BC the Greeks had begun to use the Little Bear, [[Ursa Minor]], to navigate.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, 1971:43&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1st century AD [[Marcus Annaeus Lucanus|Lucan]] writes of [[Pompey]] who questions a sailor about the use of stars in navigation. The sailor replies with his description of the use of [[circumpolar stars]] to navigate by.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, 1971:46-47&lt;/ref&gt; To navigate along a degree of latitude a sailor would have needed to find a circumpolar star above that degree in the sky.&lt;ref name="Bilic, 2009:126"&gt;Bilic, 2009:126&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Apollonius of Perga|Apollonius]] would have used [[β Draconis]] to navigate as he traveled west from the mouth of the [[Alpheus River]] to [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]].&lt;ref name="Bilic, 2009:126"/&gt;

The voyage of the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] navigator [[Pytheas|Pytheas of Massalia]] is a particularly notable example of a very long, early voyage.&lt;ref name="eb703"&gt;Chisholm, 1911:703.&lt;/ref&gt;  A competent astronomer and geographer,&lt;ref name="eb703"/&gt; Pytheas ventured from Greece through the strait of Gibraltar to Western Europe and the British Isles.&lt;ref name="eb703"/&gt;  Pytheas is the first known person to describe the [[Midnight Sun]],&lt;ref&gt;The theoretical existence of a Frigid Zone where the nights are very short in summer and the sun does not set at the summer solstice was already known. Similarly reports of a country of perpetual snows and darkness (the country of the [[Hyperboreans]]) had been reaching the Mediterranean for some centuries. Pytheas is the first known scientific visitor and reporter of the arctic.&lt;/ref&gt; [[polar ice]], [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes]] and possibly [[Stonehenge]].  Pytheas also introduced the idea of distant "[[Thule]]" to the geographic imagination and his account is the earliest to state that the moon is the cause of the tides.

[[Nearchos]]'s celebrated voyage from [[India]] to [[Susa]] after [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]]'s expedition in India is preserved in [[Arrian]]'s account, the [[Indica (Arrian)|Indica]]. Greek navigator [[Eudoxus of Cyzicus]] explored the Arabian Sea for [[Ptolemy VIII Physcon|Ptolemy VIII]], king of the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] [[Ptolemaic dynasty]] in [[Egypt]]. According to [[Poseidonius]], later reported in [[Strabo]]'s ''[[Geographica (Strabo)|Geography]]'', the [[Monsoon|monsoon wind system]] of the Indian Ocean was first sailed by Eudoxus of Cyzicus in 118 or 116 BC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/2C*.html#3.4 Strabo's Geography - Book II Chapter 3], LacusCurtius.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nautical chart]]s and textual descriptions known as sailing directions have been in use in one form or another since the sixth century BC.&lt;ref name="bow2"&gt;Bowditch, 2003:2.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nautical charts using stereographic and orthographic projections date back to the second century BC.&lt;ref name="bow2"/&gt;

In 1900, the [[Antikythera mechanism]] was recovered from [[Antikythera wreck]]. This mechanism was built around 1st century BC.

The [[Phoenicia]]ns and their successors, the [[Carthage|Carthaginians]], were particularly adept sailors and learned to voyage further and further away from the coast in order to reach destinations faster.  One tool that helped them was the [[Sounding line|sounding weight]].  This tool was bell shaped, made from stone or lead, with [[tallow]] inside attached to a very long rope.  When out to sea, sailors could lower the sounding weight in order to determine how deep the waters were, and therefore estimate how far they were from land.  Also, the tallow picked up sediments from the bottom which expert sailors could examine to determine exactly where they were.  The Carthaginian [[Hanno the Navigator]] is known to have sailed through the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] c. 500 BC and explored the Atlantic coast of Africa.  There is general consensus that the [[exploration|expedition]] reached at least as far as [[Senegal]].&lt;ref&gt;Donald Harden, ''The [[Phoenicia]]ns'', Penguin Books, Harmondsworth, page 168&lt;/ref&gt;  There is a lack of agreement whether the furthest limit of Hanno's explorations was [[Mount Cameroon]] or Guinea's 890-metre (2910-foot) Mount Kakulima.&lt;ref&gt;B.H. Warmington, op. cit., page 79&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asia===
In the [[South China Sea]] and Indian Ocean, a navigator could take advantage of the fairly constant monsoon winds to judge direction.&lt;ref name="eb284"&gt;Chisholm, 1911:284.&lt;/ref&gt;  This made long one-way voyages possible twice a year.&lt;ref name="eb284"/&gt;

The [[Caliphate|Arab Empire]] significantly contributed to [[navigation]], and had [[trade route|trade network]]s extending from the Atlantic Ocean and [[Mediterranean Sea]] in the west to the Indian Ocean and China Sea in the east,&lt;ref name=Labib&gt;Subhi Y. Labib (1969), "Capitalism in Medieval Islam", ''The Journal of Economic History'' '''29''' (1), p. 79-96.&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from the [[Nile]], [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]], navigable rivers in the Islamic regions were uncommon, so transport by sea was very important. [[Islamic geography]] and navigational sciences made use of a magnetic [[compass]] and a rudimentary instrument known as a [[Kamal (navigation)|kamal]], used for [[celestial navigation]] and for measuring the [[altitude]]s and [[latitude]]s of the [[star]]s. The kamal itself was simple to construct. It was a rectangular piece of either bone or wood which had a string with 9 consecutive knots attached to it. Another instrument available, developed by the Arabs as well, was the quadrant. Also a celestial navigation device, it was originally developed for astronomy and later transitioned to navigation.&lt;ref&gt;ThinkQuest: Library, “Early Navigational Instruments,” http://library.thinkquest.org/C004706/contents/1stsea/nap/page/n-2.html# {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110808175410/http://library.thinkquest.org/C004706/contents/1stsea/nap/page/n-2.html |date=2011-08-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  When combined with detailed maps of the period, sailors were able to sail across oceans rather than skirt along the coast. Muslim sailors were also responsible for the use and development of the [[lateen]] sails{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} and large three-[[Mast (sailing)|masted]] [[merchant vessel]]s to the Mediterranean. The origins of the [[caravel]] ship, developed and used for long-distance travel by the Portuguese, and later by the rest of Iberians, since the 15th century, also date back to the ''qarib'' used by [[al-Andalus|Andalusian]] explorers by the 13th century.&lt;ref name=Hobson&gt;John M. Hobson (2004), ''The Eastern Origins of Western Civilisation'', p. 141, [[Cambridge University Press]], {{ISBN|0521547245}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The sea lanes between [[History of India|India]] and neighboring lands were the usual form of trade for many centuries, and are responsible for the widespread influence of [[Indian culture]] to the societies of Southeast Asia. Powerful navies included those of the [[Maurya]], [[Satavahana]], [[Chola]], [[Vijayanagara]], [[Kalinga (historical kingdom)|Kalinga]], [[Maratha]] and [[Mughal Empire]].

[[Vikings]] used polarization and the [[Sunstone (medieval)|Sunstone]] to allow navigation of their ships by locating the Sun even in a completely overcast sky. This special [[mineral]] was talked about in several 13th – 14th-century written sources in [[Iceland]], some centuries after the carbon-dated, early-11th-century Norse settlement of [[L'Anse aux Meadows]] in northernmost [[Newfoundland]] had been briefly established.&lt;ref name="L'Anse"&gt;{{Cite news |first=Lorraine |last=Boissoneault |url=http://daily.jstor.org/anse-aux-meadows-and-the-viking-discovery-of-north-america/ |title=L'Anse Aux Meadows &amp; the Viking Discovery of North America|date=23 July 2015 |newspaper=JSTOR Daily}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In China between 1040 and 1117, the [[magnetic compass]] was being developed and applied to navigation.&lt;ref&gt;Li Shu-hua, “Origine de la Boussole 11. Aimant et Boussole,” ''Isis'', Vol. 45, No. 2. (July 1954), p.181&lt;/ref&gt;  This let masters continue sailing a course when the weather limited visibility of the sky.  The true mariner's compass using a pivoting needle in a dry box was invented in Europe no later than 1300.&lt;ref name="eb284"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frederic C. Lane, “The Economic Meaning of the Invention of the Compass,” ''The American Historical Review'', Vol. 68, No. 3. (April 1963), p.615ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nautical charts called [[portolan charts]] began to appear in [[Italy]] at the end of the 13th century.&lt;ref name="eb285"&gt;Chisholm, 1911:285.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, their use did not seem to spread quickly: there are no reports of the use of a nautical chart on an English vessel until 1489.&lt;ref name="eb285"/&gt;

The commercial activities of [[Portuguese Empire|Portugal]] in the early 15th century marked an epoch of distinct progress in practical navigation for Europeans.&lt;ref name="eb284"/&gt;  These exploration and trade expeditions sent out by [[Henry the Navigator|Infante Henrique (later called "Henry the Navigator")]] led first to the discovery of [[Porto Santo Island]] (near Madeira) in 1418, rediscovery of the [[Azores]] in 1427, the discovery of the [[Cape Verde]] Islands in 1447 and [[Sierra Leone]] in 1462.&lt;ref name="eb284"/&gt;  Combined with the empirical observations gathered in oceanic seafaring, mapping winds and currents, Portuguese explorers took the lead in the long distance oceanic navigation,&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Maxwell, Naked tropics: essays on empire and other rogues, p. 16, Routledge, 2003, {{ISBN|0-415-94577-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; opening later, at the beginning of the 16th century, a network of ocean routes covering the Atlantic, the Indian and the western Pacific oceans, from the North Atlantic and [[South America]], to [[Japan]] and [[Southeast Asia]].

The Portuguese discovered the two large [[volta do mar]] (meaning literally ''turn of the sea'' but also ''return from the sea'') currents and trade winds of North and of South [[Atlantic ocean]] (approximately in the first half and in the late 15th century respectively), that paved the way to reach the New World and return to Europe, as well as to circumnavigate Africa in western open sea, in future voyages of discovery, avoiding contrary winds and currents.

King [[John II of Portugal]] continued this effort, forming a committee on navigation.&lt;ref name="eb284"/&gt;  This group computed tables of [[Solar declination|the sun's declination]] and improved the [[mariner's astrolabe]], believing it a good replacement for the [[cross-staff]].&lt;ref name="eb284"/&gt;  These resources improved the ability of a navigator at sea to judge his [[latitude]].&lt;ref name="eb284"/&gt; [[Crown of Castile|Castilian]] Jew [[Abraham Zacut]], the author of an exceptional treatise on astronomy/astrology in Hebrew, with the title ''Ha-jibbur Ha-gadol'', fled to Portugal in 1492. He published in the printing press of [[Leiria]] in 1496, the book ''Biur Luhoth'', or in Latin ''Almanach Perpetuum'', which was soon translated into Latin and Spanish. In this book were the astronomical tables (ephemerides) for the years 1497 to 1500, which may have been instrumental, together with the [[Mariner's astrolabe|new astrolabe]], made of metal and not wood as before{{citation needed|reason=I would swear I have seen medieval astrolabes made of metal.|date=August 2016}} (created and perfected at the beginning of the Portuguese discoveries), to [[Vasco da Gama]] and [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]] in their voyages to [[India]] (also passing through South America) around the open Atlantic ocean (including the Southwest Atlantic) and in the [[Indian Ocean]]. Nevertheless, the Portuguese had to hire local pilots in the Indian Ocean for several decades to guide their ships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.academia.edu/23492680/T%C3%A1buas_Solares_na_n%C3%A1utica_portuguesa_dos_s%C3%A9culos_XV_e_XVI|title=D'Aquém, d'Além e d'Ultramar.

In the 15th and 16th centuries, the [[Crown of Castile]] and then the "unified" [[Spanish Empire|Crown of ''Spain'']] was also in the vanguard of European global exploration and colonial expansion. The Spanish Crown opened trade routes across the oceans, specially the transatlantic expeditions of [[Christopher Columbus]] on behalf of Castile, from 1492. The Crown of Castile, under [[Charles I of Spain]], also sponsored the first expedition of [[Circumnavigation|world circumnavigation]] in 1521. The enterprise was led by Portuguese navigator [[Ferdinand Magellan]] and completed by the Spanish Basque [[Juan Sebastián Elcano]]. The trips of exploration led to trade flourishing across the Atlantic Ocean between Spain and America and across the Pacific Ocean between Asia-Pacific and [[Mexico]] via the [[Philippines]]. Later, [[Andrés de Urdaneta]] discovered the northern Pacific`s ''volta do mar'' return voyage.

The compass, a cross-staff or astrolabe, a method to correct for the altitude of [[Polaris]] and rudimentary nautical charts were all the tools available to a navigator at the time of [[Christopher Columbus]].&lt;ref name="eb284"/&gt;  In his notes on Ptolemy's geography, [[Johannes Werner]] of Nurenberg wrote in 1514 that the cross-staff was a very ancient instrument, but was only beginning to be used on ships.&lt;ref name="eb285"/&gt;

Prior to 1577, no method of judging the ship's speed was mentioned that was more advanced than observing the size of the vessel's [[bow wave]] or the passage of sea foam or various floating objects.&lt;ref name="may"&gt;May, William Edward, ''A History of Marine Navigation'', G. T. Foulis &amp;amp; Co. Ltd., Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, 1973, {{ISBN|0-85429-143-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1577, a more advanced technique was mentioned: the [[chip log]].&lt;ref name="eb284"/&gt;  In 1578, a patent was registered for a device that would judge the ship's speed by counting the revolutions of a wheel mounted below the ship's waterline.&lt;ref name="eb284"/&gt;

Accurate time-keeping is necessary for the determination of longitude.&lt;ref name="eb285"/&gt;  As early as 1530, precursors to modern techniques were being explored.&lt;ref name="eb285"/&gt;  However, the most accurate clocks available to these early navigators were water clocks and sand clocks, such as [[hourglass]].&lt;ref name="eb285"/&gt;  Hourglasses were still in use by the [[Royal Navy]] of Britain until 1839 for the timing of [[Watchstanding|watches]].&lt;ref name="eb285"/&gt;

Continuous accumulation of navigational data, along with increased exploration and trade, led to increased production of volumes through the Middle Ages.&lt;ref name="bow2"/&gt; "Routiers" were produced in France about 1500; the English referred to them as "rutters."&lt;ref name="bow2"/&gt; In 1584 Lucas Waghenaer published the ''Spieghel der Zeevaerdt'' (''The Mariner's Mirror''), which became the model for such publications for several generations of navigators.&lt;ref name="bow2"/&gt; They were known as "Waggoners" by most sailors.&lt;ref name="bow2"/&gt;

In 1537, [[Pedro Nunes]] published his ''Tratado da Sphera''. In this book he included two original treatises about questions of navigation. For the first time the subject was approached using mathematical tools. This publication gave rise to a new scientific discipline: "theoretical or scientific navigation".

In 1545, [[Pedro de Medina]] published the influential ''Arte de navegar''. The book was translated into French, Italian, Dutch and English.&lt;ref name="eb285"/&gt;

In 1569, [[Gerardus Mercator]] published for the first time [[Mercator 1569 world map|a world map]] in such a [[cartographic projection]] that [[Loxodrome|constant-rhumb trajectories]] were plotted as straight lines. This [[Mercator projection]] would be widely used for [[nautical chart]]s from the 18th century onward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brotton|first1=Jerry|title=A History of the World in Twelve Maps|date=2012|publisher=Penguin UK|isbn=9781846145704|pages=chapter 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1594, [[John Davis (English explorer)|John Davis]] published an 80-page pamphlet called ''The Seaman's Secrets'' which, among other things describes [[Great circle|great circle sailing]].&lt;ref name="eb287"/&gt;  It's said that the explorer [[Sebastian Cabot (explorer)|Sebastian Cabot]] had used great circle methods in a crossing of the North Atlantic in 1495.&lt;ref name="eb287"/&gt;  Davis also gave the world a version of the [[backstaff]], the [[backstaff#Davis quadrant|Davis quadrant]], which became one of the dominant instruments from the 17th century until the adoption of the [[sextant]] in the 19th century.

In 1599, [[Edward Wright (mathematician)|Edward Wright]] published ''[[Certaine Errors in Navigation]]'', which for the first time explained the mathematical basis of the [[Mercator projection]], with calculated mathematical tables which made it possible to use in practice.  The book made clear why only with this projection would a constant bearing correspond to a straight line on a chart. It also analysed other sources of error, including the risk of parallax errors with some instruments; and faulty estimates of latitude and longitude on contemporary charts.

In 1599/1600, Edward Wright's World Chart of 1599 was the first map under the Mercator projection drawn by an Englishman for English navigation. The map prominently displays the Queen Elizabeth I Privy Seal; the only one of her realm to carry her private seal.  The Molyneux 1592 globe is the only other cartography with her Privy Seal. Both identify "Nova Albion", the land Captain Francis Drake claimed for his Queen during his 1577-1580 circumnavigation, above the 40th parallel.

In 1631, [[Pierre Vernier]] described his newly invented [[Quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]] that was accurate to one minute of arc.&lt;ref name="eb287"&gt;Chisholm, 1911:287.&lt;/ref&gt;  In theory, this level of accuracy could give a line of position within a nautical mile of the navigator's actual position.

In 1635, [[Henry Gellibrand]] published an account of yearly change in [[magnetic variation]].&lt;ref name="eb288"&gt;Chisholm, 1911:288.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1637, using a specially built [[sextant (astronomical)|astronomical sextant]] with a 5-foot radius, Richard Norwood measured the length of a nautical mile with chains.&lt;ref name="eb289"&gt;Chisholm, 1911:289.&lt;/ref&gt;  His definition of 2,040 yards is fairly close to the modern [[International System of Units]] (SI) definition of 2,025.372 yards.  Norwood is also credited with the discovery of [[magnetic dip]] 59 years earlier, in 1576.&lt;ref name="eb289"/&gt;

In 1714 the British ''[[Board of Longitude|Commissioners for the discovery of longitude at sea]]'' came into prominence.&lt;ref name="eb290"&gt;Chisholm, 1911:290.&lt;/ref&gt;  This group, which existed until 1828, offered grants and rewards for the solution of navigational problems.&lt;ref name="eb290"/&gt;  Between 1737 and 1828, the commissioners disbursed some £101,000.&lt;ref name="eb290"/&gt;  The government of the United Kingdom also offered significant rewards for navigational accomplishments in this era, such as £20,000 for the discovery of the [[Northwest Passage]] and £5,000 for the navigator that could sail within a degree of latitude of the [[North Pole]].&lt;ref name="eb290"/&gt; A widespread manual in the 18th century was ''Navigatio Britannica'' by [[John Barrow (historian)|John Barrow]], published in 1750 by [[March &amp; Page]] and still being advertised in 1787.&lt;ref&gt;ODNB entry for John Barrow (fl. 1735–1774): [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/1543 Retrieved 18 July 2011.

[[Isaac Newton]] invented a reflecting quadrant around 1699.&lt;ref&gt;Newton, I., “Newton's Octant” (posthumous description), Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, vol. 42, p. 155, 1742&lt;/ref&gt;   He wrote a detailed description of the instrument for [[Edmond Halley]], which was published in 1742. Due to this time lapse, credit for the invention has often been given instead to [[John Hadley]] and [[Thomas Godfrey (inventor)|Thomas Godfrey]]. The octant eventually replaced earlier [[cross-staff]]s and [[Davis quadrant]]s,&lt;ref name="eb290"/&gt;  and had the immediate effect of making latitude calculations much more accurate.

A highly important breakthrough for the accurate determination of longitude came with the invention of the [[marine chronometer]]. The 1714 [[longitude prize]] offer for a method of determining longitude at sea, was won by [[John Harrison]], a Yorkshire carpenter. He submitted a project in 1730, and in 1735 completed a clock based on a pair of counter-oscillating weighted beams connected by springs whose motion was not influenced by gravity or the motion of a ship. His first two sea timepieces H1 and H2 (completed in 1741) used this system, but he realised that they had a fundamental sensitivity to [[centrifugal force]], which meant that they could never be accurate enough at sea.
Harrison solved the precision problems with his much smaller H4 chronometer design in 1761. H4 looked much like a large five-inch (12&amp;nbsp;cm) diameter pocket watch. In 1761, Harrison submitted H4 for the £20,000 longitude prize.  His design used a fast-beating balance wheel controlled by a temperature-compensated spiral spring.  These features remained in use until stable [[electronic oscillator]]s allowed very accurate portable timepieces to be made at affordable cost. In 1767, the [[Board of Longitude]] published a description of his work in ''The Principles of Mr. Harrison's time-keeper''.

In 1757, [[John Bird (astronomer)|John Bird]] invented the first [[sextant]].This replaced the Davis quadrant and the octant as the main instrument for navigation. The [[sextant]] was derived from the octant in order to provide for the [[lunar distance method]].  With the lunar distance method, mariners could determine their longitude accurately.  Once chronometer production was established in the late 18th century, the use of the chronometer for accurate determination of longitude was a viable alternative.&lt;ref name="eb290"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Roberts"&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Scientists at [[Applied Physics Laboratory|Johns Hopkins University's Applied Physics Laboratory]] took a series of measurements of ''Sputnik'''s [[doppler shift]] yielding the satellite's position and velocity.&lt;ref name="ah-gps"/&gt;  This team continued to monitor ''Sputnik'' and the next satellites into space, ''Sputnik II'' and ''Explorer I''.  In March 1958 the idea of working backwards, using known satellite orbits to determine an unknown position on the Earth's surface began to be explored.&lt;ref name="ah-gps"/&gt;  This led to the ''TRANSIT'' satellite navigation system.&lt;ref name="ah-gps"/&gt;  The first ''TRANSIT'' satellite was placed in polar orbit in 1960.&lt;ref name="ah-gps"/&gt;  The system, consisting of 7 satellites, was made operational in 1962.&lt;ref name="ah-gps"/&gt;  A navigator using readings from three satellites could expect accuracy of about 80 feet.&lt;ref name="ah-gps"/&gt;

On July 14, 1974 the first prototype Navstar GPS satellite was put into orbit, but its clocks failed shortly after launch.&lt;ref name="ah-gps"/&gt;  The ''Navigational Technology Satellite 2'', redesigned with cesium clocks, started to go into orbit on June 23, 1977.&lt;ref name="ah-gps"/&gt;  By 1985, the first 11-satellite GPS Block I constellation was in orbit.&lt;ref name="ah-gps"/&gt;

Satellites of the similar Russian [[GLONASS]] system began to be put into orbit in 1982, and the system is expected to have a complete 24-satellite constellation in place by 2010.&lt;ref name="ah-gps"/&gt;  The [[European Space Agency]] expects to have its [[Galileo (satellite navigation)|Galileo]] with 30 satellites in place by 2011/12 as well.&lt;ref name="ah-gps"/&gt;

==Integrated bridge systems==
Electronic integrated bridge concepts are driving future navigation system planning.&lt;ref name="bow1"&gt;Bowditch, 2002:1.&lt;/ref&gt; Integrated systems take inputs from various ship sensors, electronically display positioning information, and provide control signals required to maintain a vessel on a preset course.&lt;ref name="bow1"/&gt; The navigator becomes a system manager, choosing system presets, interpreting system output, and monitoring vessel response.&lt;ref name="bow1"/&gt;

'''ISO 3166-2:GD''' is the entry for [[Grenada]] in [[ISO 3166-2]], part of the [[ISO 3166]] [[standardization|standard]] published by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), which defines [[code]]s for the names of the principal [[country subdivision|subdivision]]s (e.g., [[province]]s or [[state (administrative division)|state]]s) of all [[country|countries]] coded in [[ISO 3166-1]].

Currently for Grenada, ISO 3166-2 codes are defined for [[parishes of Grenada|6 parishes and 1 dependency]].

Each code consists of two parts, separated by a hyphen. The first part is {{mono|GD}}, the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] code of Grenada. The second part is two digits:
* 01&amp;ndash;06: parishes (all on the island of Grenada)
* 10: dependency ([[Carriacou and Petite Martinique]], in the southern part of the [[Grenadines]])

==Current codes==
Subdivision names are listed as in the ISO 3166-2 standard published by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA).

}}

The '''Indonesian throughflow''' (ITF) is an ocean current with importance for global climate since it provides a low-latitude pathway for warm, fresh water to move from the [[Indopacific|Pacific to the Indian Ocean]] and this serves as the upper branch of the [[thermohaline circulation|global heat conveyor belt]].  Higher [[ocean surface topography]] in the western Pacific than in the Indian Ocean drives upper [[thermocline]] water from the North Pacific through the western route of the [[Makassar Strait]] to either directly exit through the [[Lombok Strait]] or flow eastward into the [[Banda Sea]]. Weaker flow of saltier and denser South Pacific water passes over the Lifamatola Passage into the Banda Sea, where these water masses are mixed due to tidal effects, [[Ekman spiral|Ekman pumping]], and heat and fresh water flux at the ocean surface.  From the Banda Sea the ITF exits [[Timor Sea|Timor]], [[Ombai Strait|Ombai]], and Lombok passages.

The location and topography of the channels that make up the ITF are shown in the Figure.   Lombok Strait is 300m deep and roughly 35&amp;nbsp;km wide and the currents vary between 0.286&amp;nbsp;m/s (0.6&amp;nbsp;mi/hr) eastward to 0.67&amp;nbsp;m/s westward and average 0.25&amp;nbsp;m/s westward.  Currents in Ombai vary between 0.12&amp;nbsp;m/s eastward to 0.16&amp;nbsp;m/s westward, averaging 0.11&amp;nbsp;m/s westward and are funneled within the 1250m deep and 35&amp;nbsp;km wide passage.   Timor passage, which is 1890 m deep by 160&amp;nbsp;km wide, is the widest of the exit pathways and averages only 0.02&amp;nbsp;m/s.  From 2004–2006, 11 [[mooring (oceanography)|moorings]] were deployed across the entrance and exit regions of the ITF and were positioned to accurately measure each passage’s contribution as part of the International Nusantara Stratification and Transport (INSTANT) program.  Flow in through Makassar (11.6 Sv, 1 [[Sverdrup|Sv]] = 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; m³/s) and Lifamatola (1.1 Sv) sums to 12.7 Sv.  Total outflow transport corresponds to 15.0 Sv (varying from 10.7 to 18.7 Sv) and is made up of Lombok (2.6 Sv), Ombai (4.9 Sv) and Timor (7.5 Sv) contributions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marine.csiro.au/~cow074/SPRINTALL_JGR.pdf Sprintall, J., S.E. Wijffels, R. Molcard, and I. Jaya, Direct estimates of the Indonesian Throughflow entering the Indian Ocean: 2004-2006, Journal of Geophysical Research-Oceans, 114, 19, 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt; Heat Transport of the Indonesian Throughflow is 1.087 PW (1 PW=10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; Watt).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.igu.in/10-4/2vivek.pdf “Heat transport through Indonesian throughflow by Vivek Kumar Pandey and Avinash Chand Pandey in J. Ind. Geophys. Union ( October 2006 ) Vol.10, No.4, pp.273-277”]. (PDF) ITF heat transport result from POM Model.&lt;/ref&gt;   

Circulation and transport within the Indonesian Seas varies along with large-scale monsoon flow.  During June to August, southeasterlies of the [[Monsoon#Southwest_monsoon|southwest monsoon]] predominate over Indonesia and drive strong Ekman divergence (southwestward flow in the Southern Hemisphere thus increasing ITF to 15 Sv) whereas from December to February, [[Monsoon#Australia|Northwest Monsoon]] westerlies serve to directly reduce the ITF .  During monsoon transitions, strong westerly winds in the eastern Indian Ocean force equatorial downwelling [[Kelvin waves]] (eastward moving, eastward flow) that propagate through the Indonesian passages as [[Kelvin_waves#Coastal_Kelvin_wave|coastally trapped Kelvin waves]] and serve to reduce the ITF flow with a minimum in April of 9 Sv.  Another way to think about it is that downwelling on the Indian Ocean side increases sea level and so reduces the normal Pacific-to-Indian pressure head reducing the flow. 

Global-scale, ocean waves such as equatorial/coastal Kelvin and [[Rossby_wave#Oceanic_waves|Rossby waves]] drive interannual variation of the ITF with an amplitude of roughly +/-3 Sv.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, A., S.E. Wijffels, J. Sprintall, R. Molcard, and P.R. Oke, Pathways of intraseasonal variability in the Indonesian Throughflow region, Dynamics of Atmospheres and Oceans, 50 (2), 174-200, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  Western-central Pacific westerly winds from [[El Nino]] force westward moving-equatorial Rossby waves and eastward currents that hit eastern New Guinea and propagate around the west coast as coastal Kelvin waves and down through the ITF along the west Australia Shelf coast serving to reduce the ITF. Upwelling (i.e. reduced sea level) associated with Rossby waves on the Pacific side reduces the Pacific-to-Indian pressure gradient and reduces the ITF. Interannual variability of Indian Ocean westerlies act in the same manner as the seasonal equatorial Kelvin waves to reduce the normal westward ITF flow as well.

An important feature of the Indonesian Throughflow is that because the water in the western equatorial Pacific Ocean has a higher temperature and lower [[salinity]] than the water in the Indian Ocean, the Throughflow transports large amounts of relatively warm and fresh water to the Indian Ocean. When the Indonesian Throughflow (through Lombok Strait, Ombai and the Timor Passages) enters the Indian Ocean it is [[Advection|advected]] towards [[Africa]] within the [[South Equatorial Current|Indian South Equatorial Current]]. There it eventually exits the Indian Ocean with the [[Agulhas Current]] around [[South Africa]] into the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. So the Indonesian Throughflow transports a significant amount of Pacific Ocean heat into the southwest Indian Ocean, which is approximately {{convert|10000|km|mi|abbr=on}} away from the Lombok Strait.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csiro.au/files/mediaRelease/mr1995/mr95123.htm Indonesian Throughflow - Marine Research] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605125700/http://www.csiro.au/files/mediaRelease/mr1995/mr95123.htm |date=2011-06-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jean Baptiste François Joseph de Warren''' or '''John Warren''' (21 September 1769 – 9 February 1830) was an army captain and later Lieutenant Colonel with Her Majesty's 33rd regiment of foot, [[East India Company]] in India, surveyor and amateur astronomer. While working as a surveyor in the [[Great Trigonometrical Survey]] he rediscovered what became the [[Kolar Gold Fields]] and in later life he documented Indian astronomy and time keeping traditions in his book ''Kala Sankalita''.

== Biography ==
[[File:Warren_pendulum.jpg|thumb|upright|left|1812 experiments with pendulums]]
Warren was born at [[Livorno]], Italy, the fourth child of Count Henry Hyacinthe de Warren and Christine Walburge de Meuerers. Their ancestors included Guillaume de Warren, first count of Warren and Surrey. He moved to London in 1793 and tried to work as an artist but failed. He then moved to Calcutta on 10 December 1793 and attempted to become an indigo planter but failed. He bought commission as an ensign in the army and fought in Mysore under [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Arthur Wellesley]] against [[Tipu Sultan]]. After the victory against Tipu, and in view of his "addiction to mathematical studies" he was appointed to assist the Mysore Survey under [[William Lambton]]. He conducted additional experiments during Lambton's initial baseline trials in Bangalore to examine the effects of refraction on measurements. He also examined the effects of humidity by constructing a hygrometer that made use of the beards of a local grass called Panimooloo ''[[Heteropogon contortus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=An account of experiments made in the Mysore country, in the year 1804, to investigate the effects of terrestrial refraction| author=Warren, John| journal=Transactions of the Asiatic Society| volume=9| year=1809|pages=1-23|url= https://archive.org/stream/asiaticresearche09asia#page/n12/mode/1up/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While surveying the region near Malur, Warren heard about gold deposits and examined the old mines in the Kolar region that had been abandoned as being too low in yield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal= Asiatic Society of Bengal|volume=3| title=Observations on the Golden Ore, found in the Eastern Province of Mysore in the year 1802| author=Warren, Lieut. John|pages=463-474 | year=1834 |url=https://archive.org/stream/journalofasiatic03asia#page/463/mode/1up/}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a proponent for the use of milestones and he put in 262 markers at his own expense between Srirangapatnam and Naickenchero and between Bangalore and Balamangalam. Warren held the post of Company Astronomer and was a superintendent of the surveying school at Madras. During his term at the surveying school he was charged of embezzling money and was forced to return an excess of 3860 pagodas (100 pagodas per year per student was the norm but Warren was drawing 1200 per year) due to complaints from a student.&lt;ref name=fa&gt;{{cite journal| title= French astronomers in India during the 17th - 19th centuries| author=Kochhar, R. K.| journal= Journal of the British Astronomical Association| volume= 101| issue=2| pages= 95-100| bibcode= 1991JBAA..101...95K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Warren was acting director at the [[Madras Observatory]] from February 1805 to October 1811 and in this period he established the longitude of Madras, a figure that was used in the trigonometrical survey and for nearly a century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= An account of astronomical observations taken at the Honourable Company's Observatory, near Fort St. George in the East Indies, in the years 1806 and 1807| author=Warren, Captain John| pages=513-525|url= https://archive.org/stream/asiaticresearche10asia_0#page/512/mode/2up/| volume=10| year=1811| journal=Asiatic Researches}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1812 he published the results of measurements of the periods of pendulums and compared them with measurements from other parts of the world and came to the conclusion that the departure from predicted values was due to heterogeneity in the geology of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Warren, John |year=1812| title= An account of experiments made at the observatory near Fort St. George, for determining the length of the simple pendulum beating seconds of time at that place; to which are added comparisons of the said experiments, with others made in different parts of the globe, and some remarks on the ellipticity of the Earth, as deduced from these operations|pages=293-308|url= https://archive.org/stream/asiatickresearc03indigoog#page/n315/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt;In 1814 he returned to France with his son Edouard. He was reinstated into the French army with the rank of Lieut-Colonel and was made Chevalier of St Louis. He became a corresponding member of the 'le Bureau des Longitudes'. Leaving his son to study in France, he returned to settle in Pondicherry and work on a book on the methods of timekeeping and calendar making in southern India. The book, ''Kala Sankalita'', begun in 1814 was finally published in 1825. Among the calculations that Warren documented was the computation of lunar eclipses by a Pondicherry-based calendar maker who used shells placed on the ground and coded formulae.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Tamil Astronomy: A Study in the History of Astronomy in India| author=Neugebauer, O.| journal=Osiris | volume=10| year=1952| pages=252-276| jstor=301816}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1824 he was made Chevalier of the Legion of Honour.&lt;ref name=fa /&gt;

Warren died in Pondicherry on 9 February 1830 and a book on his life was written by his son Edouard - ''L'Inde Anglaise en 1843''.&lt;ref name=fa /&gt;

The club spent its entire existence playing top-flight football (from 1946 to 1991 in the [[Yugoslav First League]], from 1991 onwards in the [[Prva HNL]]).

This list details the club's achievements in all major competitions, and the top scorers for each season (note that only goals scored in league matches are taken into account). Players in '''bold''' were also top league scorers that season.

===1946–1991===
Following the club's formation as the municipal [[Sports club|multi-sports club]] FD Dinamo in June 1945 the club's first competitive success was winning the first post-war Zagreb municipal championship held in January and February 1946 and then finishing as runners-up behind [[HNK Hajduk Split|Hajduk Split]] in the [[SR Croatia]] regional championship which doubled as a qualifying tournament for the [[1946–47 Yugoslav First League]] (officially called "First Federal League", {{lang-hr|Prva savezna liga}}), the first edition of the post-war national top level. Dinamo soon established themselves as one of the so-called "Big Four" of Yugoslav football (along with Hajduk Split, [[FK Partizan|Partizan]] and [[Red Star Belgrade|Red Star]]), a quartet of teams who dominated the game in [[SFR Yugoslavia]], by finishing runners-up in 1947, and winning league titles in [[1947–48 Yugoslav First League|1948]], [[1953–54 Yugoslav First League|1954]] and [[1957–58 Yugoslav First League|1958]] and were never relegated from top level until leaving the league in 1991 following Croatia's independence. During the Yugoslav era Dinamo won four league titles and seven [[Yugoslav Cup]]s. They were only the third Yugoslav side to play in an UEFA-sponsored competition when they appeared in the [[1958–59 European Cup]] (after Partizan in 1955 and Red Star in 1956).

The club's most successful period was between 1960 and 1969, during which they reached the Yugoslav Cup finals six times (winning four) but failed to clinch a single league title (finishing runners-up five times). The club also had two successful campaigns in the [[Inter-Cities Fairs Cup]] during this period, reaching the final in [[1963 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup Final|1963]] and [[1967 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup Final|1967]] and winning the latter by beating [[England]]'s [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]]. This was the only European silverware won by any Yugoslav club until Red Star Belgrade won the [[1990–91 European Cup]] 24 years later. The club's second "golden age" came between 1980 and 1986, when Dinamo reached another five cup finals (winning two) and won the [[1981–82 NK Dinamo Zagreb season|1981–82 league]] title, their first league win in 24 years.

In the Yugoslav era three Dinamo players were top league scorers on four occasions: [[Franjo Wölfl]] in 1947 and 1948, [[Dražan Jerković]] in 1962 (who also went on to become joint top scorer at the [[1962 FIFA World Cup]] that year) and [[Snješko Cerin]] in 1982. Cerin went on to become the club's most prolific scorer in the period with a total of 103 league goals for Dinamo between 1976 and 1986. The most successful managers were [[Milan Antolković]] who led the club to three cup finals (1960, 1963 and 1963 - winning the first two) and the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup final in 1963; and [[Miroslav Blažević]] who led the club to the 1981–82 league win and three cup finals (1982, 1983 and 1986 - winning only the 1983 edition).

===1992–present===
Following the [[1990–91 Yugoslav First League]] Croatian clubs abandoned the league amid the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]] and joined the present-day [[Croatian football league system]] as the country declared independence. Dinamo Zagreb were thus founding members of the [[Prva HNL]] (1. HNL). Affected by the ongoing [[Croatian war of Independence|war in Croatia]] the league's inaugural season was shortened and held over the course of only one calendar year from February to June 1992. During the season the club took part in European competitions on account of qualification secured at the end of the 1990–91 Yugoslav season as Dinamo had finished runners-up in the league and qualified for the [[1991–92 UEFA Cup]]. Due to the ongoing war Croatian clubs had to host their European games abroad so Dinamo played their UEFA Cup first round fixture against [[Trabzonspor]] in [[Klagenfurt]], [[Austria]]. The following 1992–93 season no Croatian club was allowed to enter European competitions as the [[Croatian Football Federation]], the league's governing body, was not yet recognized by [[UEFA]] and officially became its affiliate as late as June 1993.

Amid political turmoil in the early 1990s club's officials began claiming direct lineage to pre-WWII Zagreb-based clubs [[Građanski Zagreb]] and [[HAŠK]] and in order to reflect this Dinamo were renamed "HAŠK Građanski" in June 1991. They finished fifth in the inaugural 1. HNL season and reached the [[Croatian Football Cup|Croatian Cup]] final which they lost to minnows [[NK Inter Zaprešić|Inker Zaprešić]]. In February 1993 the club were renamed "Croatia Zagreb". They won five league titles and three domestic cups and participated in the 1998–99 and 1999–2000 [[UEFA Champions League]] group stages carrying that name before reverting to "Dinamo Zagreb" in February 2000.

==Notes==
*{{note label|draws|A|A}} Between the 1988–89 and 1991–92 seasons drawn games went to penalties with only the shootout winners gaining the point. Figures in brackets in the drawn games column represent points won in such shootouts.
*{{note label|scorers|B|B}} Includes only goals scored in league matches. Players indicated in '''bold''' were also top league scorers that season.
*{{note label|1952 season|C|C}} The [[1952 Yugoslav First League]] was shortened and completed over a period of three and a half months, beginning on 2 March and ending on 22 June. The reason for the changes was a desire to start the next season in the fall of 1952, thus implementing the fall–spring format that had become a norm all across Europe by this time. The clubs were initially divided into two groups of six teams each, where everyone within a given group played each other twice (home and away). After ten rounds Dinamo topped their group and qualified for the four-team championship group in the second stage in which four best-placed teams from preliminary groups played each other twice. Eventually Dinamo finished fourth, six points behind winners [[HNK Hajduk Split|Hajduk Split]]. The statistics for the 1952 season thus show season totals and not just the final standings in the second stage group.
*{{note label|cups|D|D}} In the 1955–56 and 1974–75 seasons the [[Yugoslav Cup]] was not held. On both occasions the cup edition was skipped for rescheduling purposes as the Yugoslav FA had decided to move the date of cup finals from 29 November (or [[Republic Day#November 29 in former Yugoslavia (1945–1990)|Republic Day]], the anniversary of the establishment of communist Yugoslavia) to on or around 25 May (or [[Youth Day#Yugoslavia|Youth Day]], a national holiday which doubled as the official celebration of [[Josip Broz Tito]]'s birthday).
*{{note label|1986-87 season|E|E}} Due to the match-fixing scandal in the 1985–86 season, ten clubs had started the [[1986–87 Yugoslav First League]] season with a deduction of 6 points, among them Dinamo Zagreb. [[FK Vardar|Vardar]], who had not been deducted any points, won the title and participated in the [[1987–88 European Cup]], with Dinamo originally finishing eighth in the league. After post-season legal proceedings the situation was resolved in July 1987 with a court ruling which nullified the deductions and which meant that the title was given back to Partizan and that Dinamo finished the season in sixth place.&lt;ref name="yugoteams"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesj/joeg-ec.html|title=Yugoslav teams in Eurocups|last=Miladinovich|first=Misha|date=16 December 1999|publisher=Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation|accessdate=1 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="yugochamps"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesj/joegchamp.html|title=Yugoslavia/Serbia (and Montenegro) - List of Champions|last=Stokkermans|first=Karel|date=21 May 2010|publisher=Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation|accessdate=1 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1813">'''The Lloyd Center for the Environment''' is a non-profit organization that provides educational programs on aquatic environments in southeastern [[New England]] in the [[United States]].  

The Lloyd Center’s {{convert|55|acre|m2}} of [[estuary]] and maritime forest in South [[Dartmouth, Massachusetts]], was donated to the Dartmouth Natural Resources Trust in 1978 by Karen Lloyd as a living memorial to her mother, Katharine Nordell Lloyd. Lloyd Center programming began in 1981.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lloydcenter.org/history/ |title=History |publisher=Lloyd Center for the Environment |accessdate=December 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five walking trails offer scenic views of the [[Slocum River]], [[Buzzards Bay]], [[Demarest Lloyd State Park]], [[Mishaum Point]], and [[Cuttyhunk]] Island.  The [[Chaypee]] Woods Trail snakes its way through stone walls that hearken back to farming days when dairy cattle, ducks, and chickens were raised there.  Steep steps and slopes mix with the vistas of the [[salt marsh]], oak-hickory forest, freshwater [[wetlands]], [[Kettle (geology)|kettleholes]], [[moraine]], and a Native American [[midden]] site.

[[File:TRIO HUGUES.jpg|thumb|Anonymous Piedmontese 19th century, ''Trio Hugues'': (from left) [[Costantino Nigra]] – famous politician – Felice Hugues and Luigi Hugues.]]
{{Music of Italy}}

'''Luigi Hugues'''  (27 October 1836 – 5 March 1913) was an [[Italy|Italian]] academic [[geographer]] and accomplished amateur [[musician]]. He is best known today as a composer and arranger of virtuoso works for the [[flute]], and for his contributions to the teaching and history of geography.

Hughes was born in [[Casale Monferrato]], today in the [[Province of Alessandria]], [[Piedmont]]. He trained originally as an [[engineer]], and taught in various technical institutes before becoming professor of geography within the Faculty of Letters at the [[University of Turin]] in 1897.

Luigi Hughes died in Casale Monferrato at the age of 76. ''Viale Luigi Hugues'', a street in [[Turin]], is named in his honour.

Although Hugues’ musical works are recognized for their instrumental virtuosity, they are not always taken entirely seriously. Flautist and teacher [[Fenwick Smith]] refers to their “brilliance and vacuity” and writes of the ''Grand Concert Fantasy on Verdi’s Ballo in Maschera'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;“With a flutist’s knowledge of the instrument, which permits him to conjure more notes per square inch than Verdi ever dreamed of, and with the Italians’ sure sense of drama, Hugues has concocted a paragon among potboilers.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RECITAL 1981—Program Notes for "A Romantic Musical Entertainment"|url=http://www.fenwicksmith.com/1981.html|author=Fenwick Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Image:Ukok Plateau.jpg|thumb|400px|[[Ukok Plateau]], one of the last remnants of the mammoth steppe&lt;ref name=pavelkova2014/&gt;]]
During the [[Last Glacial Maximum]], the '''mammoth steppe''' was the Earth’s most extensive [[biome]]. It spanned from [[Spain]] eastwards across Eurasia to [[Canada]] and from the [[List of islands in the Arctic Ocean|arctic islands]] southwards to [[China]].&lt;ref name=adams1990/&gt;&lt;ref name=guthrie1990/&gt;&lt;ref name=sher1997/&gt;&lt;ref name=alvarez2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=zimov2012/&gt; It had a cold, dry climate,&lt;ref name=guthrie2001/&gt;&lt;ref name=zimov2012/&gt; the vegetation was dominated by palatable high-productivity grasses, herbs and willow shrubs,&lt;ref name=guthrie1990/&gt;&lt;ref name=zimov2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=sher2005/&gt; and the animal biomass was dominated by the [[bison]], [[horse]], and the [[woolly mammoth]].&lt;ref name=guthrie2001/&gt; This ecosystem covered wide areas of the northern part of the globe, thrived for approximately 100,000 years without major changes, and then suddenly became all but extinct about 12,000 years ago.&lt;ref name=guthrie2001/&gt;

== Naming ==
At the end of the 19th century, [[Alfred Nehring]] (1890)&lt;ref name=nehring1890/&gt; and [[Jan Czerski]] (Iwan Dementjewitsch Chersky, 1891)&lt;ref name=chersky1891/&gt; proposed that during the [[last glacial period]] a major part of northern Europe had been populated by large [[herbivore]]s and that a steppe climate had prevailed there.&lt;ref name=blinnikov2011/&gt; In 1982, the scientist R. Dale Guthrie coined the term "mammoth steppe" for this paleoregion.&lt;ref name=guthrie1982/&gt;&lt;ref name=blinnikov2011/&gt;

== Origin of the mammoth steppe ==
The [[last glacial period]], commonly referred to as the 'Ice Age', spanned from 126,000 [[YBP]]–11,700 YBP&lt;ref name=ics2016/&gt; and was the most recent [[glacial period]] within the [[Quaternary glaciation|current ice age]] which occurred during the last years of the [[Pleistocene]] era.&lt;ref name=ipcc2007/&gt; It reached its peak during the [[last glacial maximum]], when [[ice sheet]]s commenced advancing from 33,000 years BP and reached their maximum positions 26,500 years BP. Deglaciation commenced in the Northern Hemisphere approximately 19,000 years BP, and in Antarctica approximately 14,500 years BP, which is consistent with evidence that it was the primary source for an abrupt rise in the sea level at that time.&lt;ref name=clark2009/&gt;

During the peak of the last glacial maximum, a vast mammoth steppe stretched from Spain across [[Eurasia]] and over the [[Bering land bridge]] into Alaska and the [[Yukon]] where it was stopped by the [[Wisconsin glaciation]]. This land bridge existed because more of the planet's water was locked up in ice than now and therefore the sea levels were lower. When the sea levels began to rise this bridge was inundated around 11,000 years BP.&lt;ref name=scott1996/&gt;

During glacial periods, there is clear evidence for intense aridity due to water being held in glaciers and their associated effects on climate.&lt;ref name=hopkins1982/&gt;&lt;ref name=vrba1995/&gt;&lt;ref name=guthrie2001/&gt; The mammoth steppe was like a huge 'inner court' that was surrounded on all sides by moisture-blocking features: massive continental glaciers, high mountains, and frozen seas. These kept rainfall low and created more days with clear skies than are seen today, which increased evaporation in the summer leading to aridity, and radiation of warmth from the ground into the black night sky in the winter leading to cold.&lt;ref name=guthrie2001/&gt; This is thought to have been caused by seven factors:

#The driving force for the core Asian steppe was an enormous and stable high-pressure system north of the [[Tibetan Plateau]].
#Deflection of the larger portion of the Gulf Stream southward, past southern Spain onto the coast of Africa, reduced temperatures (hence moisture and cloud cover) that the [[North Atlantic Current]] brings to Western Europe.
#Growth of the Scandinavian ice sheet created a barrier to North Atlantic moisture.
#Icing over of the North Atlantic sea surface with reduced flow of moisture from the east.
#The winter (January) storm track seems to have swept across Eurasia on this axis.
#Lowered sea levels exposed a large continental shelf to the north and east producing a vast northern plain which increased the size of the continent to the north.
#North American glaciers shielded interior Alaska and the Yukon Territory from moisture flow. These physical barriers to moisture flow created a vast arid basin or protected 'inner court' spanning parts of three continents.&lt;ref name=guthrie2001/&gt;

Animal biomass and plant productivity of the mammoth steppe were similar to today's African [[savannah]].&lt;ref name=zimov2012/&gt; There is no comparison to it today.&lt;ref name=guthrie2001/&gt;&lt;ref name=zimov2012/&gt;

=== Plants ===
The paleo-environment changed across time,&lt;ref name=guthrie2006/&gt; a proposal that is supported from mammoth dung samples found in northern [[Yakutia]].&lt;ref name=vangeel2008/&gt; During Pleniglacial [[interstadial]]s, [[alder]], [[birch]], and [[pine]] trees survived in northern Siberia, however during the [[Last Glacial Maximum]] only a treeless steppe vegetation existed. At the onset of the Late Glacial Interstadial (15,000–11,000 BP), global warming resulted in shrub and dwarf birch in northeastern Siberia, which was then colonized by open woodland with birch and [[spruce]] during the [[Younger Dryas]] (12,900–11,700 YBP). By the Holocene (10,000 YBP), patches of closed [[larch]] and pine forests developed.&lt;ref name=vangeel2008/&gt; Past researchers had once assumed that the mammoth steppe was very unproductive because they had assumed that its soils had a very low carbon content; however, these soils ([[yedoma]]) were preserved in the [[permafrost]] of Siberia and Alaska and are the largest reservoir of organic carbon known. It was a highly productive environment.&lt;ref name=zimov2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=kirby2015/&gt; The vegetation was dominated by palatable high-productivity grasses, herbs and [[willow]] shrubs.&lt;ref name=guthrie1990/&gt;&lt;ref name=zimov2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=sher2005/&gt;

=== Animals ===
{{further|Woolly mammoth|Woolly rhinoceros}}
The mammoth steppe was dominated in biomass by bison, horse, and the woolly mammoth, and was the center for the evolution of the Pleistocene woolly fauna.&lt;ref name=guthrie2001/&gt; On [[Wrangel Island]], the remains of [[woolly mammoth]], [[woolly rhinoceros]], [[horse]], [[bison]] and [[musk ox]] have been found. [[Reindeer]] and small animal remains do not preserve, but reindeer excrement has been found in sediment.&lt;ref name=zimov2012/&gt; In the most arid regions of the mammoth steppe that were to the south of Central Siberia and Mongolia, woolly rhinoceros were common&lt;ref name=garrut2001/&gt;&lt;ref name=zimov2012/&gt; but woolly mammoths were rare.&lt;ref name=kuzmin2001/&gt;&lt;ref name=zimov2012/&gt; Reindeer live in the far north of Mongolia today and historically their southern boundary passed through Germany and along the steppes of eastern Europe,&lt;ref name=syroechkovskii1986/&gt;&lt;ref name=zimov2012/&gt; indicating they once covered much of the mammoth steppe.&lt;ref name=zimov2012/&gt; Mammoths survived on the [[Taimyr Peninsula]] until the Holocene.&lt;ref name=sher2005/&gt;&lt;ref name=zimov2012/&gt; A small population of mammoth survived on [[St. Paul Island, Alaska]], up until 3750&amp;nbsp;BC,&lt;ref name=veltre2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=enk2009/&gt; and the small&lt;ref name=tikhonov2003/&gt; mammoths of Wrangel Island survived until 1650&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref name=arslanov1998/&gt;&lt;ref name=vartanyan1995/&gt; Bison in Alaska and the Yukon, and horses and muskox in northern Siberia, have survived the loss of the mammoth steppe.&lt;ref name=zimov2012/&gt; One study has proposed that a change of suitable climate caused a significant drop in the mammoth population size, which made them vulnerable to hunting from expanding human populations. The coincidence of both of these impacts in the Holocene most likely set the place and time for the extinction of the woolly mammoth.&lt;ref name=nogues2008/&gt;

== Decline of the mammoth steppe ==
The mammoth steppe had a cold, dry climate.&lt;ref name=guthrie2001/&gt;&lt;ref name=zimov2012/&gt; During the past interglacial warmings, forests of trees and shrubs expanded northwards into the mammoth steppe, when northern Siberia, Alaska and the Yukon ([[Beringia]]) would have formed a mammoth steppe refugium. When the planet grew colder again, the mammoth steppe expanded.&lt;ref name=zimov2012/&gt; This ecosystem covered wide areas of the northern part of the globe, thrived for approximately 100,000 years without major changes, and then suddenly became extinct about 12,000 years ago.&lt;ref name=guthrie2001/&gt;

There are two theories about the decline of the mammoth steppe.

=== Climate change ===
The Climatic Hypothesis assumes that the vast mammoth ecosystem could have only existed within a certain range of climatic parameters. At the beginning of the [[Holocene]] 10,000 years ago, mossy forests, tundra, lakes and wetlands displaced mammoth steppe. It has been assumed that in contrast to other previous interglacials the cold dry climate switched to a warmer wetter climate that, in turn, caused the disappearance of the grasslands and their dependent megafauna.&lt;ref name=guthrie1990/&gt;

The extinct steppe bison (''Bison priscus'') survived across the northern region of central eastern Siberia until 8000 years ago. A study of the frozen mummy of a steppe bison found in northern [[Yakutia]], Russia indicated that it was a pasture grazer in a habitat that was becoming dominated by shrub and tundra vegetation. Higher temperature and rainfall led to a decrease in its previous habitat during the early Holocene, and this led to population fragmentation followed by extinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.quaint.2015.11.084|title=The Yukagir Bison: The exterior morphology of a complete frozen mummy of the extinct steppe bison, Bison priscus from the early Holocene of northern Yakutia, Russia|journal=Quaternary International|year=2016|last1=Boeskorov|first1=Gennady G.|last2=Potapova|first2=Olga R.|last3=Protopopov|first3=Albert V.|last4=Plotnikov|first4=Valery V.|last5=Agenbroad|first5=Larry D.|last6=Kirikov|first6=Konstantin S.|last7=Pavlov|first7=Innokenty S.|last8=Shchelchkova|first8=Marina V.|last9=Belolyubskii|first9=Innocenty N.|last10=Tomshin|first10=Mikhail D.|last11=Kowalczyk|first11=Rafal|last12=Davydov|first12=Sergey P.|last13=Kolesov|first13=Stanislav D.|last14=Tikhonov|first14=Alexey N.|last15=Van Der Plicht|first15=Johannes|volume=406|pages=94–110|bibcode=2016QuInt.406...94B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 a study looked at the environmental conditions across Europe, Siberia and the Americas from 25,000–10,000 YBP. The study found that prolonged warming events leading to deglaciation and maximum rainfall occurred just prior to the transformation of the rangelands that supported megaherbivores into widespread wetlands that supported herbivore-resistant plants. The study proposes that moisture-driven environmental change led to the megafaunal extinctions, and that Africa's trans-equatorial position allowed rangeland to continue to exist between the deserts and the central forests; therefore fewer megafauna species became extinct there.&lt;ref name=rabanus2017/&gt;

=== Human predation ===
The Ecosystem Hypothesis assumes that the vast mammoth ecosystem extended over a range of many regional climates and was not affected by climate fluctuations. Its highly productive grasslands were maintained by animals trampling any mosses and shrubs, and actively transpiring grasses and herbs dominated. At the beginning of the Holocene the rise in precipitation was accompanied by increased temperature, and so its climatic aridity did not change substantially. As a result of human hunting, the decreasing density of the animals was not enough to maintain the grasslands, leading to an increase in forests, shrubs and mosses with further animal reduction due to loss of feed. The mammoth continued to exist on isolated [[Wrangel Island]] until a few thousand years ago, and some of the other megafauna from that time still exist today, which indicates that something other than climate change was responsible for [[Quaternary extinction event|megafaunal extinctions]].&lt;ref name=zimov2012/&gt;

Remains of mammoth that had been hunted by humans 45,000 YBP have been found at [[Yenisei River|Yenisei Bay]] in the central Siberian Arctic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.aad0554|pmid=26816376|title=Early human presence in the Arctic: Evidence from 45,000-year-old mammoth remains|journal=Science|volume=351|issue=6270 |pages=260–3|year=2016|last1=Pitulko|first1=V.

== Last remnants ==

During the Holocene, the arid-adapted species became extinct or were reduced to minor habitats.&lt;ref name=guthrie2001/&gt; Cold and dry conditions similar to the last glacial period are found today in the eastern [[Altai-Sayan region|Altai-Sayan]] mountains of Central Eurasia,&lt;ref name=frenzel1992/&gt;&lt;ref name=pavelkova2014/&gt; with no significant changes occurring between the cold phase of the Pleistocene and the Holocene.&lt;ref name=agadjanian2005/&gt;&lt;ref name=pavelkova2014/&gt; Recent paleo-biome reconstruction&lt;ref name=tarasov1999/&gt;&lt;ref name=tarasov2000/&gt;&lt;ref name=pavelkova2014/&gt; and pollen analysis&lt;ref name=jankovska2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=kunes2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=pelankova2009/&gt;&lt;ref name=pavelkova2014/&gt; suggest that some present-day Altai-Sayan areas could be considered the closest analogy to the mammoth steppe environment.&lt;ref name=pavelkova2014/&gt; The environment of this region is considered to have been stable for the past 40,000 years. The Eastern part of the Altai-Sayan region forms a Last Glacial refugium. In both the Last Glacial and modern times, the eastern Altai-Sayan region has supported large herbivore and predator species adapted to the steppe, desert and alpine biomes where these biomes have not been separated by forest belts. None of the surviving Pleistocene mammals live in temperate forest, taiga, or tundra biomes. The areas of [[Ukok plateau|Ukok-Sailiugem]] in the southern [[Altai Republic]], and [[Khar-Us Lake|Khar Us Nuur]] and Uvs Nuur ([[Ubsunur Hollow]]) in western Mongolia, have supported [[reindeer]] and [[saiga antelope]] since the glacial period.&lt;ref name=pavelkova2014/&gt;

[[Image:PK fields by water1.jpg|thumb|right|375px|A market garden on an outlying island of [[Hong Kong]]]]
A '''market garden''' is the relatively small-scale production of [[fruit]]s, [[vegetable]]s and [[flower]]s as [[cash crop]]s, frequently [[Sales|sold]] directly to [[consumer]]s and [[restaurant]]s.  The diversity of [[agriculture|crops]] grown on a small area of [[Landform|land]], typically, from under one [[acre]] (0.4 ha) to a few acres, or sometimes in [[greenhouse]]s distinguishes it from other types of [[farming]]. Such a farm on a larger scale is sometimes called a '''truck farm'''.

A market garden is a [[business]] that provides a wide range and steady supply of fresh [[produce]] through the local [[growing season]]. Unlike large, industrial [[farm]]s, which practice [[monoculture]] and mechanization, many different crops and varieties are grown and more [[manual labour|manual labor]] and [[gardening]] techniques are used. The small output requires selling through such local fresh produce outlets as on-farm stands, [[farmers' market]]s, [[community-supported agriculture]] subscriptions, restaurants and independent produce stores. Market gardening and orchard farming are closely related to [[horticulture]], which concerns the growing of fruits and vegetables.

==History==
[[Image:Bachman greenhouse.jpg|thumb|right|325px|[[Cucumber]]s reach to the ceiling in a greenhouse in [[Richfield, Minnesota]], where market gardeners grew a wide variety of produce for sale in Minneapolis. ca. 1910]]

Traditionally, "market garden" was used to contrast farms devoted to raising vegetables and [[berries]], a specialized type of farming, with the larger branches of grain, dairy, and orchard fruit farming; agricultural historians continue to thus use the term.  Such operations were not necessarily small-scale.  Indeed, many were very large, commercial farms that were called "gardens" not because of size, but because English-speaking farmers traditionally referred to their vegetable plots as "gardens": in English whether in common parlance or in [[anthropological]] or historical scholarship, husbandry done by the [[Hoe (tool)|hoe]] is customarily called "gardening" and husbandry done by the [[plough]] as "farming" regardless of the scale of either.  A "market garden" was simply a vegetable plot, the produce of which the farmer used to sell as opposed to use to feed his or her family.   Market gardens are necessarily close to the markets, i.e. cities, that they serve.

The word 'truck' in Truck farms does not refer to the transportation truck, which is derived from Latin for wheel, but rather from the old north French word ''troquer'', which means "barter" or "exchange". The use for vegetables raised for market can be traced back to 1784 and truck farms to 1866.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=truck Online Etymology Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business==
Selling to the wholesale market usually earns 10–20% of the retail price, but direct-to-consumer selling earns 100%. Although highly variable, a conventional farm may return a few hundred to a few thousand dollars (US) per acre ($0.03/m² to $0.30/m²) but an efficient market garden can earn in the $10,000–15,000 per acre ($3/m² to $5/m²) range, or even higher. However, the size of a market garden has a practical upper bound based on this model, but with conventional farming can farm vast areas because access to a direct market is not a requirement.

Larger market gardens often sell to such local food outlets as [[supermarket]]s, [[food cooperative]]s, [[community-supported agriculture]] programs, [[farmers' market]]s, [[fresh food]] [[wholesaler]]s, and any other higher-volume channels that benefit from buying a range of vegetables from a single supplier, their freshness allowing for a premium over the revenue from the supermarkets and frequently other local suppliers.  A larger market garden can by mixed crop production maintain a sales alternative to the wholesale [[commodity]]-style channels often used by farms that specialize in high volumes of a limited number of crops.

Relying on cities for markets, however, can have drawbacks. For example, in [[England]], south [[Sussex]] was famous for growing [[tomato]]es for the [[London]] market that were delivered by [[train]]. The arrival of [[railway]]s in the 19th century at first stimulated growth of market gardens in certain areas by providing quick access to the city, but it eventually allowed [[commuting]] residents to move there and turn many market garden areas into [[suburb]]s. [[Urban sprawl]] still eats up farmland in urban regions. Buying the rights to develop farmland from the farmers solved this problem in [[Suffolk County, New York]].

[[Image:Chinese gardener, ca. 1893 121707.jpg|thumb|250px|Chinese market gardener in [[Australia]], ca. 1893]]

==Social role==
In some more affluent countries, including [[Australia]] and the [[United States]], market gardening is rated as a high social utility occupation. It is typically taken up by recent immigrant groups for one or two generations, until they can accumulate capital, language and trade skills. The succession of dominant market garden groups in Australia, for example, was – from the early 19th century Anglo-Celtic, people from German-speaking countries, Chinese [after the peak of the [[gold rush]]es in mid-late 19th century], then southern European migrants from Italy, Malta and [[Yugoslavia]] [before it disintegrated], then southeast Asian migrant and refugee communities following the Vietnam War, such as the Vietnamese and Cambodians.

Involvement in a market garden lets immigrant groups who otherwise have few marketable skills apart from their labour, become actively involved in the market economy. Benefits are that it does not rely on education or language, it adapts well to providing work for extended family groups, and in large market growing regions even wider community support networks. Sharing of knowledge and experience within communities reduces risks, and supports a network of other trades such as carriers, market agents, and heavy machinery contractors, and contract farm labour. Market-gardening land is typically relatively cheap and allows immigrants to purchase land, often with an accompanying residence, far more readily than in urban settings. However, like all agriculture it risks crop failure, market collapse and competition from industrialised broad-acre farming and 'fresh-frozen' imported produce. Other risks are from hazards such as [[pesticide]] use, especially where the market gardeners are not trained in their use or able to read product information. Another consequence is marginalisation of the succeeding generation where they are relied upon as the fittest and strongest to succeed in continuing the farm rather than pursue other ambitions and opportunities.

==Alternative lifestyle==
Market gardening has in recent decades become an alternative business and [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] choice for individuals who wish to "[[Back-to-the-land movement|return to the land]]", because the [[business model]] and niche allow a smaller start-up [[investment]] than conventional commercial farming, and generally offers a viable market (in microeconomics basic or staple foods are considered as necessities and have highly inelastic demand curves meaning that consumers will buy them in relatively constant quantities even if prices or incomes vary), especially with the recent popularity of [[organic food|organic]] and [[local food]]. It is in some instances considered [[hobby farm]]ing, although market gardening is a recognized type of farming with a distinct business model that can be significantly profitable and [[sustainable business|sustainable]]. There is a spectrum with overlap from with the efforts of [[amateur]] gardeners who sometimes sell from home or at markets, as an extension of their pastime, to fully commercial market gardening as the main or sole income stream. The latter requires the most discipline and business sense. Successful practitioners who have written books about it include [[Eliot Coleman]] and [[Jean-Martin Fortier]].

==In contemporary America==
[[File:20150319-OC-LSC-0608 (16247565064).jpg|thumb|A garden with edible plants for use in a culinary school in [[Lawrenceville, Georgia]]]]
An example of a market garden operation in [[North America]] might involve one [[farmer]] working full-time on two acres (8,000 m²). Most work is done with hand and light power tools, and perhaps a small [[tractor]]. Some 20 different crops are planted throughout the season. Hardier [[plant]]s, like [[pea]]s, [[spinach]], [[radish]], [[carrot]]s and [[lettuce]] are seeded first, in earlier Spring, followed by main season crops, like [[tomato]]es, [[potato]]es, [[maize|corn]], [[bean]]s, [[cucumber]], [[onion]]s, and [[squash (fruit)|summer squash]]. A further planting timed for [[harvest]] in the cooler [[autumn|Fall]] conditions might include more spinach and carrots, [[squash (fruit)|winter squash]], [[cabbage]], and [[rutabaga]]. Harvesting is done at least weekly, by hand, sometimes with part-time help, and produce is sorted, washed and sold fresh at the local farmers' market, and from an on-farm stand. A [[pick-up truck]] is used for short distance transport of crops and other farm materials. The workflow is a steady cycle of planting and harvesting right through the growing season, and usually comes to an end in the cold winter months.

A somewhat larger market garden operation, ranging from 10 to 100 acres (40,000 to 400,000 m²), may be referred to as intensive mixed vegetable production, although the essential business and farming tasks are the same. Such operations are often run by a full-time farmer or farm family, and a few full-time employees. The tractor is relied upon for many tasks, and manual labor requirements, particularly for setting [[Transplant (botanical)|transplant]]s and harvesting, are often significant, with crews of 10, 20 or more people employed seasonally. This has led in the U.S. to groups of "transient" or "migrant" workers who follow the harvest seasons to different farms across the country. In cooler climates, [[greenhouse]]s are generally used to produce transplants, and sometimes greenhouse production is extended through winter or with [[hydroponics]]. Harvest and [[post-harvest handling]] are more sophisticated at the larger scale, with some mechanized harvest and processing equipment, walk-in coolers, and refrigerated delivery vehicles.

'''Midžor''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Миџор}}, {{IPA-sh|mîdʒɔr|pron}}) or '''Midzhur''' ({{lang-bg|Миджур}}) is a peak in the [[Balkan Mountains]], situated on the border between [[Serbia]] and [[Bulgaria]]. At {{convert|2169|m|ft|0}}, it is the highest peak of the Western [[Balkan Mountains]], as well as the highest of [[Serbia]] outside [[Kosovo]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The highest peak of Serbia is officially [[Đeravica]] in the [[Prokletije]] mountain range at {{convert|2656|m|ft|0}}, but is located in [[Kosovo]]. If Kosovo is not included, than Midžor is the highest peak of Serbia.&lt;br/&gt;{{Kosovo-note}}&lt;/ref&gt; Midžor is the 12th highest peak in the Balkan Mountains.

==Bulgaria==
In Bulgaria, the peak is called Midzhur.

Since the early 1990s, it has been accessible to tourists from both sides; previously, access was forbidden due to the peak being in the border area. Due to those restrictions, the nature around the peak has been preserved untouched. On the Bulgarian side, the peak is reachable from the villages of [[Chuprene]] and [[Gorni Lom]] in [[Vidin Province]].

===Chuprene===
From [[Chuprene]] there are two possibilities for climbing. There is a 17&amp;nbsp;km dirt road following the river Chprenska to the Gorski Ray refuge (1,450 m) or a 9&amp;nbsp;km foot track following the river Manastirska.

From the refuge there is a marked track which passes through the [[Chuprene biosphere reserve]] and leads to the main summit on a saddle between the peaks Replyanska Tsarkva (1,969 m) and Ostra Chuka (1967 m). To the south east through the peaks Ostra Chuka and Oba (2,033 m) the track reaches a saddle from where the [[Lom River]] and the [[Trgoviški Timok|Timok]] flow out at border stone 336. From there the peak can be climbed from the north-western slope.

===Gorni Lom===
At 7&amp;nbsp;km from the village of [[Gorni Lom]] is located the Gorni Lom refuge (840 m). There is also another refuge upstream called Mudzhur. There are steep tracks from there leading to the saddle between Oba and the peak at border stone 336 from where the both tracks from the two villages merge.

===Economy===

The source of the [[Lom River]] is at the foot of the peak. A cascade of small hydroelectric power plants is in operation on the river near the peak and four more are under construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Balabanov |first=G. |title=This is Bulgaria |publisher= |location=Sofia |language=Bulgarian, English |isbn=954-91672-1-6 |year=2005 |page=51 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chuprene biosphere reserve which is under the protection of [[UNESCO]] is situated to the west of the peak. It is one of the last sanctuaries in Bulgaria where the [[Capercaillie]] nests.

A special permission from a border police office (such as the ones in [[Sofia]], [[Dragoman]], [[Chiprovtsi]], etc.) is required in order to ascend to the peak.

==Serbia==
In Serbia the peak is known as Midžor.

The extreme peak of the western mountain is north of the village of [[Topli Dol]], located in the centre of Serbian [[Stara Planina]], between [[Tri Čuke]] (1936 m) on the SE side and [[Babin Zub]] (1758 m) on the SW side. The massif of the Midžor peak is substantial. Its western, eastern, and southern slopes are grassy and not so steep, while its northern side is rocky and very steep. This side is also the most attractive and very popular among rock climbers.

It is the highest peak in Serbia outside of [[Kosovo]], and the 24th highest in the whole of Serbia if Kosovo is included.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;See: [[List of mountains in Serbia#Peaks over 2000 meters]]&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a hotel called "Babin Zub" on the slopes. There are no fees or permits needed to enter the Serbian Stara Planina.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.summitpost.org/mountain/rock/199677/Mid-or.html Midžor]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6190">'''Natural heritage''' refers to the sum total of the elements of biodiversity, including flora and fauna ,
ecosystems and geological structures.

Heritage is that which is ''inherited'' from past generations, maintained in the present, and bestowed to future generations.&lt;ref&gt; Ann Marie Sullivan, Cultural Heritage &amp; New Media: A Future for the Past, 15 J. MARSHALL REV. INTELL. PROP. L. 604 (2016) https://repository.jmls.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1392&amp;context=ripl&lt;/ref&gt; The term "natural heritage", derived from "natural inheritance", pre-dates the term "[[biodiversity]]." It is a less scientific term and more easily comprehended in some ways by the wider audience interested in [[Conservation (ethic)|conservation]]. 

The term was used in this context in the United States when [[Jimmy Carter]] set up the Georgia Heritage Trust &lt;ref&gt;http://maps.csc.noaa.gov/RoisDatabaseEntry/lawDetails.jsp?lawID=107{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} The creation of the Heritage Trust Commission, Georgia Heritage Trust Act, Official Code of Georgia (O.C.G.A.)

 By James F. Cook, {{ISBN|0-86554-954-0}}, 2005 Mercer University Press&lt;/ref&gt; It would appear that Carter picked the term up from [[Lyndon Johnson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2007-07-11-lady-bird-obit_N.htm | work=USA Today | title=Lady Bird Johnson dies at 94 | first=Kathy | last=Kiely | date=2009-01-22 | accessdate=2010-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; who used it in a 1966 Message to [[United States Congress|Congress]].  (He may have gotten the term from his wife [[Lady Bird Johnson]] who was personally interested in conservation.)  President Johnson signed the [[Wilderness Act|Wilderness Act of 1964]]. 

The term "Natural Heritage" was picked up by the Science Division of [[The Nature Conservancy]] (TNC) when, under Robert E. Jenkins, Jr., it launched in 1974 what ultimately became the network of state natural heritage programs -- one in each state, all using the same [[methodology]] and all supported permanently by state governments because they scientifically document conservation priorities and facilitate science-based environmental reviews. When this network was extended outside the United States, the term "Conservation Data Center (or Centre)" was suggested by Guillermo Mann and came to be preferred for programs outside the US{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}.  Despite the name difference, these programs, too, use the same core methodology as the 50 state natural heritage programs. In 1994 The network of natural heritage programs formed a membership association to work together on projects of common interest: the Association for Biodiversity Information (ABI). In 1999, Through an agreement with The Nature Conservancy, ABI expanded and assumed responsibility for the scientific databases, information, and tools developed by TNC in support of the network of natural heritage programs. In 2001, ABI changed its name to [[NatureServe]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.natureserve.org/about-us/our-history NatureServe History], The history of the Virginia-based conservation non-profit NatureServe.&lt;/ref&gt; NatureServe continues to serve as the hub of the NatureServe Network, a collaboration of 86 governmental and non-governmental programs including natural heritage programs and conservation data centers located in the United States, Canada, and Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.natureserve.org/natureserve-network About the NatureServe Network]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal status==

An important site of natural heritage or [[cultural heritage]] can be listed as a [[World Heritage Site]] by the [[World Heritage Committee]] of [[UNESCO]].  The UNESCO programme, catalogues, names, and conserves sites of outstanding cultural or natural importance to the common heritage of humanity.  As of March 2012, there are 936 World Heritage Sites: 725 cultural, 183 natural, and 28 mixed properties, in 153 countries.

The 1972 UNESCO World Heritage Convention established that biological resources, such as plants, were the [[common heritage of mankind]] or as was expressed in the preamble: "need to be preserved as part of the world heritage of mankind as a whole.". These rules probably inspired the creation of great public banks of genetic resources, located outside the source-countries.

New global agreements (e.g., the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]]), now give sovereign national rights over biological resources (not property). The idea of static  conservation of biodiversity is disappearing and being replaced by the idea of dynamic conservation, through the notion of resource and  innovation.

The new agreements commit countries to conserve biodiversity, develop resources for sustainability and share the benefits resulting from their use. Under new rules, it is expected  that [[bioprospecting]] or collection of natural products has to be allowed by  the biodiversity-rich country, in exchange for a share of the  benefits.

In 2005, the [[World Heritage Marine Programme]] was established to protect marine areas with Outstanding Universal Values.

'''Permaculture''' is a set of design principles centered around [[Systems thinking|whole systems thinking]] simulating or directly utilizing the patterns and [[resilience|resilient]]{{dn|date=November 2018}} features observed in natural [[ecosystem]]s. It uses these principles in a growing number of fields from [[regenerative agriculture]], [[rewilding (conservation biology)|rewilding]] to [[Community resilience|community]] and [[Organization|organizational]] design and development.

With its system of applied education, research and citizen- led [[Design thinking|design]] permaculture has grown a popular web of global networks and developed into a global [[social movement]]{{cn|date=November 2018}}.

The term permaculture was developed and coined by [[David Holmgren]], then a graduate student at the Tasmanian College of Advanced Education's Department of Environmental Design, and [[Bill Mollison]], senior lecturer in Environmental Psychology at University of Tasmania, in 1978. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Permaculture One|last=Holmgren and Mollison|first=|publisher=Transworld Publishers|year=1978|isbn=0552980757|location=|pages=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''permaculture'' originally referred to "permanent agriculture",{{Sfn | King | 1911}}&lt;ref&gt;Paull , John (2011) [https://www.academia.edu/9148622/The_making_of_an_agricultural_classic_Farmers_of_Forty_Centuries_or_Permanent_Agriculture_in_China_Korea_and_Japan_1911-2011 The making of an agricultural classic: Farmers of Forty Centuries or Permanent Agriculture in China, Korea and Japan, 1911-2011], Agricultural Sciences, 2 (3), pp. 175-180.&lt;/ref&gt; but was expanded to stand also for "permanent culture", as it was understood that social aspects were integral to a truly sustainable system as inspired by [[Masanobu Fukuoka]]’s [[natural farming]] philosophy.

It has many branches that include, but are not limited to, [[ecological design]], [[ecological engineering]], [[regenerative design]], [[environmental design]], and [[construction]]. Permaculture also includes [[integrated water resources management]] that develops [[sustainable architecture]], and regenerative and self-maintained [[habitat]] and agricultural systems modelled from natural ecosystems.{{Sfn | Hemenway | 2009 | p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=gxW0MGXha6cC&amp;pg=PA5  5]}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Mars | first = Ross| title= The Basics of Permaculture Design|publisher=Chelsea Green |year=2005|isbn=978-1-85623-023-0|page=1|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=MWb6i-G6QAkC&amp;pg=PA1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mollison has said: "Permaculture is a philosophy of working with, rather than against nature; of protracted and thoughtful observation rather than protracted and thoughtless labor; and of looking at plants and animals in all their functions, rather than treating any area as a [[Monocropping|single product system]]."&lt;ref&gt;Mollison, B. (1991). ''Introduction to permaculture''. Tasmania, Australia: Tagari.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 12 principles of permaculture most commonly referred to are first described by David Holmgren in his book ''Permaculture: Principles and Pathways Beyond Sustainability'' (2002). They include: Observe and Interact, Catch and Store Energy, Obtain a Yield, Apply Self Regulation and Accept Feedback, Use and Value Renewable Resources and Services, Produce No Waste, Design From Patterns to Details, Integrate Rather Than Segregate, Use Small and Slow Solutions, Use and Value Diversity, Use Edges and Value the Marginal, and Creatively Use and Respond to Change.

==History==
Several individuals revolutionized the branch of permaculture. In 1929, [[Joseph Russell Smith]] added an antecedent term as the subtitle for ''Tree Crops: A Permanent Agriculture'', a book which sums up his long experience experimenting with fruits and nuts as crops for human food and animal feed.&lt;ref name = jrsjs&gt;{{cite book | first1=Joseph Russell |last1=Smith |first2=John |last2=Smith | title=Tree Crops: A permanent agriculture| publisher=Island Press | year= 1987|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=0PQvqpVnFbAC&amp;lpg=PP1 | isbn = 978-1-59726873-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Smith saw the world as an inter-related whole and suggested mixed systems of trees and crops underneath. This book inspired many individuals intent on making agriculture more sustainable, such as [[Toyohiko Kagawa]] who pioneered [[forest farming]] in [[Japan]] in the 1930s.{{Sfn | Hart| 1996|p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=N01940btQAQC&amp;lpg=PA41  41]}}

In Australian P.A. Yeomans' 1964 book ''Water for Every Farm'', he supports the definition of permanent agriculture, as one that can be sustained indefinitely. Yeomans introduced both an observation-based approach to land use in Australia in the 1940s and the Keyline Design as a way of managing the supply and distribution of water in the 1950s.

Holmgren noted [[Stewart Brand]]’s works as an early influence to permaculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Essence of Permaculture | url = http://www.holmgren.com.au/frameset.html?http://www.holmgren.com.au/html/Writings/weeds.html | first = David | last = Holmgren | publisher = Holmgren Design Services | accessdate = 10 September 2011 | year = 2006 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080526225318/http://www.holmgren.com.au/frameset.html?http%3A%2F%2Fwww.holmgren.com.au%2Fhtml%2FWritings%2Fweeds.html | archivedate = 26 May 2008 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other early influences include [[Ruth Stout]] and [[Esther Deans]], who pioneered [[no-dig gardening]], and [[Masanobu Fukuoka]] who, in the late 1930s in Japan, began advocating [[no-till]] orchards and gardens and [[natural farming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The One-Straw Revolution by Masanobu Fukuoka |first=Bill |last=Mollison |newspaper=[[Nation Review]] |date= 15–21 September 1978 |page= 18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bill Mollison 01.jpg|thumb|[[Bill Mollison]] in 2008.]]
In the late 1960s, Bill Mollison and David Holmgren started developing ideas about stable agricultural systems on the southern Australian island state of [[Tasmania]]. Dangers of the rapidly growing use of industrial-agricultural methods sparked these ideas.&lt;ref name="Permaculture 1991"&gt;''Introduction to Permaculture'', 1991, Mollison, p.v&lt;/ref&gt; In their view, these methods were highly dependent on non-renewable resources, and were additionally poisoning land and water, reducing [[biodiversity]], and removing billions of tons of [[topsoil]] from previously fertile landscapes. They responded with a design approach called ''permaculture.'' This term was first made public with their publication of their 1978 book ''Permaculture One''.&lt;ref name="Permaculture 1991"/&gt;

Among some of the more recognizable names who received their original training within Mollison's PDC system would include [[Geoff Lawton]] and [[Toby Hemenway]], each of whom have more than 25 years experience teaching and promoting permaculture as a sustainable way of growing food. [[Simon J Fjell]] was a Founding Director of the Permaculture Institute in late 1979 and a teacher of the first Permaculture Design Course, having first met Mollison in 1976. He has since worked internationally and is currently listing a major social enterprise on NASDAQ.

By the early 1980s, the concept had broadened from agricultural systems design towards [[Sustainable habitat|sustainable human habitats]]. After ''Permaculture One'', Mollison further refined and developed the ideas by designing hundreds of permaculture sites and writing more detailed books, such as ''Permaculture: A Designers Manual''. Mollison lectured in over 80 countries and taught his two-week Permaculture Design Course (PDC) to hundreds of students. {{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Mollison "encouraged graduates to become teachers themselves and set up their own institutes and demonstration sites. This multiplier effect was critical to permaculture’s rapid expansion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last1 = Lillington| first1 = Ian| last2 = Holmgren | first2 = David |last3=Francis|first3=Robyn|last4=Rosenfeldt|first4= Robyn|title= The Permaculture Story: From ‘Rugged Individuals’ to a Million Member Movement|url= https://www.pipmagazine.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/what-is-permaculture.pdf | format = PDF | work =Pip Magazine|accessdate=9 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The permaculture movement also spread throughout Asia and Central America, with Hong Kong-based Asian Institute of Sustainable Architecture (AISA),&lt;ref&gt;[https://daforum.wordpress.com/aisa/ Asian Institute of Sustainable Architecture (AISA)]&lt;/ref&gt; Rony Lec leading the foundation of the Mesoamerican Permaculture Institute (IMAP)&lt;ref&gt;[http://imapermaculture.org Mesoamerican Permaculture Institute (IMAP)]&lt;/ref&gt; in Guatemala and Juan Rojas co-founding the Permaculture Institute of El Salvador.&lt;ref&gt;[http://permacultura.com.sv Permaculture Institute of El Salvador]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Core tenets and principles of design==
The three core tenets of permaculture are:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Greenblott | first1 = Kara | first2 = Kristof | last2 = Nordin | year = 2012 | title = Permaculture Design for Orphans and Vulnerable Children Programming: Low-Cost, Sustainable Solutions for Food and Nutrition Insecure Communities | place = Arlington, VA | publisher = USAID | series = AIDS Support and Technical Assistance Resources, AIDSTAR-One | number = Task Order 1 | url = http://www.aidstar-one.com/focus_areas/ovc/resources/technical_briefs/permaculture_for_OVC}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn | Mollison | 1988 | p =2}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Permaculture: Principles &amp; Pathways Beyond Sustainability |last=Holmgren |first=David |year=2002 |publisher=Holmgren Design Services |isbn = 0-646-41844-0 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Care for the earth''': Provision for all life systems to continue and multiply. This is the first principle, because without a healthy earth, [[human]]s cannot flourish.
* '''Care for the people''': Provision for people to access those resources necessary for their existence
* '''Fair share''': By governing our own needs, we can set resources aside to further the above principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Permaculture: a Designer's Manual |last=Mollison |first=Bill |year=1988 |publisher=Tagari Press |isbn = 0-908228-01-5 |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This includes returning waste back into the system to recycle into usefulness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mollison|first=Bill|title=Permaculture: A Quiet Revolution | type = interview |url=http://www.scottlondon.com/interviews/mollison.html|work= Scott London |accessdate= 17 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third ethic is  referred to as Fair Share, which reflects that each of us should take no more than what we need before we reinvest the surplus.

Permaculture design emphasizes patterns of [[landscape]], function, and species assemblies.  It determines where these elements should be placed so they can provide maximum benefit to the local environment. Permaculture maximizes useful connections between components and [[synergy]] of the final design. The focus of permaculture, therefore, is not on each separate element, but rather on the relationships created among elements by the way they are placed together; the whole becomes [[Emergence|greater than the sum of its parts]]. Permaculture design therefore seeks to minimize [[waste]], human labor, and energy input by building systems, and maximizes benefits between design elements to achieve a high level of [[synergy]]. Permaculture designs evolve over time by taking into account these relationships and elements and can evolve into extremely complex systems that produce a high density of food and materials with minimal input.&lt;ref name="Edible Forest Gardening"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edibleforestgardens.com/|title=Edible Forest Gardening}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The design principles, which are the conceptual foundation of permaculture, were derived from the science of [[systems ecology]] and study of pre-industrial examples of [[sustainable]] land use. Permaculture draws from several disciplines including [[organic farming]], [[agroforestry]], [[integrated farming]], [[sustainable development]], and [[applied ecology]].&lt;ref name="David Holmgren 1997"&gt;{{cite web | title = Weeds or Wild Nature | url = http://holmgren.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/23_weeds_or_wild_nature.pdf | first = David | last = Holmgren |publisher= Permaculture International Journal |accessdate= 10 September 2011 |year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Permaculture has been applied most commonly to the design of housing and landscaping, integrating techniques such as [[agroforestry]], [[natural building]], and [[rainwater harvesting]] within the context of permaculture design principles and theory. {{FACT|date=January 2018}}

==Theory==
===Twelve design principles===
Twelve Permaculture design principles articulated by David Holmgren in his ''Permaculture: Principles and Pathways Beyond Sustainability'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://holmgren.com.au/product/principles/ |title=Permaculture: Principles and Pathways Beyond Sustainability |publisher=Holmgren Design |accessdate= 21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Observe and interact'': By taking time to engage with nature we can design solutions that suit our particular situation.
# ''Catch and store energy'': By developing systems that collect resources at peak abundance, we can use them in times of need.
# ''Obtain a yield'': Ensure that you are getting truly useful rewards as part of the work that you are doing.
# ''Apply self-regulation and accept feedback'': We need to discourage inappropriate activity to ensure that systems can continue to function well.
# ''Use and value [[renewable]] resources and services'': Make the best use of nature's abundance to reduce our consumptive behavior and dependence on non-renewable resources.
# ''Produce no waste'': By valuing and making use of all the resources that are available to us, nothing goes to waste.
# ''Design from patterns to details'': By stepping back, we can observe patterns in nature and society. These can form the backbone of our designs, with the details filled in as we go.
# ''Integrate rather than segregate'': By putting the right things in the right place, relationships develop between those things and they work together to support each other.
# ''Use small and slow solutions'': Small and slow systems are easier to maintain than big ones, making better use of local resources and producing more sustainable outcomes.
# ''Use and value diversity'': Diversity reduces vulnerability to a variety of threats and takes advantage of the unique nature of the environment in which it resides.
# ''Use edges and value the marginal'': The interface between things is where the most interesting events take place. These are often the most valuable, diverse and productive elements in the system.
# ''Creatively use and respond to change'': We can have a positive impact on inevitable change by carefully observing, and then intervening at the right time.

===Layers===
[[File:Claire Gregorys Permaculture garden.jpg|thumb|238px|Suburban permaculture garden in [[Sheffield]], UK with different layers of vegetation]]
Layers are one of the tools used to design functional ecosystems that are both sustainable and of direct benefit to humans. A mature ecosystem has a huge number of relationships between its component parts: trees, [[understory]], [[ground cover]], [[soil]], [[fungi]], insects, and animals.  Because plants grow to different heights, a diverse community of life is able to grow in a relatively small space, as the vegetation occupies different layers.  There are generally seven recognized layers in a [[forest gardening|food forest]], although some practitioners also include [[fungi]] as an eighth layer.&lt;ref name="tcpermaculture.com"&gt;{{Citation | url = http://tcpermaculture.com/site/2013/05/27/nine-layers-of-the-edible-forest-garden/ | title = Nine layers of the edible forest garden | date = 27 May 2013 | publisher = TC permaculture}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
# The [[canopy (biology)|canopy]]: the tallest trees in the system. Large trees dominate but typically do not saturate the area, i.e. there exist patches barren of trees.
# [[Understory]] layer: trees that flourish in the dappled light under the canopy.
# [[Shrub layer]]: a diverse layer of woody perennials of limited height. Includes most berry bushes.
# [[Herbaceous layer]]: Plants in this layer die back to the ground every winter (if winters are cold enough, that is). They do not produce woody stems as the Shrub layer does. Many culinary and medicinal herbs are in this layer. A large variety of beneficial plants fall into this layer. May be annuals, biennials or perennials.
# Soil surface/[[Groundcover]]: There is some overlap with the [[Herbaceous layer]] and the [[Groundcover layer]]; however plants in this layer grow much closer to the ground, grow densely to fill bare patches of soil, and often can tolerate some foot traffic. [[Cover crop]]s retain soil and lessen [[erosion]], along with [[green manure]]s that add nutrients and [[organic matter]] to the soil, especially [[Nitrogen fixation|nitrogen]].
# [[Rhizosphere (ecology)|Rhizosphere]]: Root layers within the soil. The major components of this layer are the soil and the organisms that live within it such as plant roots and [[rhizomes]] (including [[root crop]]s such as [[potato]]es and other edible [[tuber]]s), fungi, insects, nematodes, worms, etc.
# Vertical layer: climbers or [[vine]]s, such as [[runner bean]]s and [[lima bean]]s (vine varieties).&lt;ref name="tcpermaculture.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution-url = http://permacultureschool.ca/food-forests/seven-layers-of-a-forest/ | title = Food forests | contribution = Seven layers of a forest | publisher = Permaculture school | place = [[Canada|CA]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Guilds===
A guild is a group of species where each provides a unique set of diverse functions that work in conjunction or harmony. There are many forms of guilds, including guilds of plants with similar functions that could interchange within an ecosystem, but the most common perception is that of a mutual support guild. Mutual support guilds are groups of [[plant]]s, [[animal]]s, [[insect]]s, etc. that work well together. Plants may be grown for food production, draw nutrients from deep in the soil through tap roots, are nitrogen-fixing [[legumes]], attract [[beneficial insects]], and repel harmful insects. When grouped together in a mutually beneficial arrangement, these plants form a guild.  See Dave Jacke's work on edible forest gardens for more information on other guilds, specifically resource-partitioning and community-function guilds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Simberloff|first1=D|last2=Dayan|first2=T|title=The Guild Concept and the Structure of Ecological Communities|journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics|volume=22|page=115|year=1991|doi=10.1146/annurev.es.22.110191.000555}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-70591/community-ecology | work = Encyclopædia Britannica | title = Guilds | accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Williams|first1=SE|last2=Hero|first2=JM|title=Rainforest frogs of the Australian Wet Tropics: guild classification and the ecological similarity of declining species|journal=Proceedings: Biological Sciences | publisher = The Royal Society|volume=265|issue=1396|pages=597–602|year=1998|pmid=9881468|pmc=1689015|doi= 10.1098/rspb.1998.0336}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Edge effect===
The [[edge effect]] in ecology is the effect of the juxtaposition, or placing contrasting [[natural environment|environments]] on an ecosystem. Permaculturists argue that where vastly differing systems meet, there is an intense area of productivity and useful connections. An example of this is the coast; where the land and the sea meet, there is a particularly rich area that meets a disproportionate percentage of human and animal needs.  This idea is played out in permacultural designs by using spirals in herb gardens, or creating ponds that have wavy undulating shorelines rather than a simple circle or oval (thereby increasing the amount of edge for a given area).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://deepgreenpermaculture.com/permaculture/permaculture-design-principles/10-edge-effect/|title=10. Edge Effect|date=3 April 2013|newspaper=Deep Green Permaculture|language=en-US|access-date=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zones===
[[File:Permaculture Zones.svg|thumb|Permaculture zones 0-5]]

Zones intelligently organize design elements in a human environment based on the frequency of human use and plant or animal needs. Frequently manipulated or harvested elements of the design are located close to the house in zones 1 and 2.  Manipulated elements located further away are used less frequently. Zones are numbered from 0 to 5 based on positioning.{{Sfn | Burnett, Graham, ''Permaculture A Beginners Guide', Spiralseed, 2001 p.26}}
; Zone 0: The house, or home center.  Here permaculture principles would be applied in terms of aiming to reduce energy and water needs, harnessing natural resources such as sunlight, and generally creating a harmonious, sustainable environment in which to live and work.  Zone 0 is an informal designation, which is not specifically defined in [[Bill Mollison]]’s book.
; Zone 1: The zone nearest to the house, the location for those elements in the system that require frequent attention, or that need to be visited often, such as salad crops, [[herb]] plants, soft fruit like [[Strawberry|strawberries]] or [[Raspberry|raspberries]], [[greenhouse]] and [[cold frame]]s, propagation area, [[Vermicompost|worm compost]] bin for kitchen waste, etc. [[Raised bed gardening|Raised beds]] are often used in zone 1 in [[Urban agriculture|urban areas]].
; Zone 2: This area is used for siting [[perennial]] plants that require less frequent maintenance, such as occasional [[weed control]] or [[pruning]], including currant bushes and orchards, pumpkins, sweet potato, etc.  This would also be a good place for [[beehive]]s, larger scale [[compost]]ing bins, etc.
; Zone 3: The area where main-crops are grown, both for domestic use and for trade purposes. After establishment, care and maintenance required are fairly minimal (provided [[mulch]]es and similar things are used), such as watering or weed control maybe once a week.
; Zone 4: A semi-wild area. This zone is mainly used for [[forage]] and collecting wild food as well as production of timber for construction or firewood.
; Zone 5: A wilderness area. There is no human intervention in zone 5 apart from the observation of natural [[ecosystem]]s and cycles. Through this zone we [[Biological pest control|build up a natural reserve of bacteria, moulds and insects]] that can aid the zones above it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://edepot.wur.nl/115721 | title = Permacultuur course | publisher = WUR | place = [[Netherlands|NL]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===People and permaculture===
Permaculture uses observation of nature to create regenerative systems, and the place where this has been most visible has been on the landscape. There has been a growing awareness though that firstly, there is the need to pay more attention to the peoplecare ethic, as it is often the dynamics of people that can interfere with projects, and secondly that the principles of permaculture can be used as effectively to create vibrant, healthy and productive people and communities as they have been in landscapes.

===Domesticated animals===
[[List of domesticated animals|Domesticated animals]] are often incorporated into site design, ensuring the efficiency and productivity of the system.{{Sfn | Mollison| 1988|p =5| ps =: ‘[[Deer]], [[rabbit]]s, [[sheep]], and [[herbivorous]] [[fish]] are very useful to us, in that they convert unusable herbage to acceptable human food. Animals represent a valid method of storing inedible vegetation as food.’}}Animals, domestic or wild are a critical component of any wild or designed sustainable ecosystem. Research indicates that without the animal’s participation and contribution, ecological integrity is diminished or impossible.&lt;ref name="permaculture.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.permaculture.org/resources/backyard-animals/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217221136/http://www.permaculture.org/resources/backyard-animals/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=17 December 2014|title=Backyard Animals {{!}} Permaculture Institute|website=www.permaculture.org|language=en-US|access-date=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the activities that contribute to the system include: foraging to cycle nutrients, clear fallen fruit, weed maintenance, spreading seeds, and pest maintenance. The nutrients are cycled by animals, transformed from their less digestible form (such as grass or twigs) into more nutrient-dense manure.&lt;ref name="permaculture.org"/&gt;

Several animals can be incorporated into a permaculture system, including cows, goats, chickens, geese, turkey, rabbits, and worms. A more specific explanation of how the animals can be used is seen in the chicken design. Chickens can be used to scratch over the soil, thus breaking down the top soil and using the fecal matter as manure creating a sustainable system. However, in the domestication of these animals, the complexity and elegance lie in an effectiveness and efficiency of the design, including factors like timing and habits to specific areas of a farm. For example, animals require daily attention in a way that is much more demanding than plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://permaculturenews.org/2016/03/07/permaculture-animals-as-a-discipline-to-the-system/|title=Permaculture Animals as a Discipline to the System|date=7 March 2016|website=The Permaculture Research Institute|access-date=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common practices==
===Agroforestry===
[[Agroforestry]] is an integrated approach of permaculture, which uses the interactive benefits from combining trees and shrubs with crops or livestock. It combines agricultural and [[forestry]] technologies to create more diverse, productive, profitable, healthy and sustainable land-use systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nac.unl.edu |title=USDA National Agroforestry Center (NAC) |publisher=UNL |date=1 August 2011 |accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In agroforestry systems, trees or shrubs are intentionally used within agricultural systems, or [[non-timber forest product]]s are cultured in forest settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usda.gov/documents/OC/FactSheet_final_8-1-11.pdf|title=USDA Agroforestry Strategic Framework|last=|first=|date=1 August 2011|website=|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture|access-date=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Forest gardening]] is a term permaculturalists use to describe systems designed to mimic natural forests.  Forest gardens, like other permaculture designs, incorporate processes and relationships that the designers understand to be valuable in natural ecosystems.  The terms forest garden and food forest are used interchangeably in the permaculture literature.  Numerous permaculturists are proponents of forest gardens, such as Graham Bell, [[Patrick Whitefield]], Dave Jacke, Eric Toensmeier and [[Geoff Lawton]]. Bell started building his forest garden in 1991 and wrote the book ''The Permaculture Garden'' in 1995, Whitefield wrote the book ''How to Make a Forest Garden'' in 2002, Jacke and Toensmeier co-authored the two volume book set ''Edible Forest Gardening'' in 2005, and Lawton presented the film ''Establishing a Food Forest'' in 2008.&lt;ref name="Edible Forest Gardening"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://permaculture.mediamice.net/?page_id=26|work=Permaculture|title=Graham Bell’s Forest Garden|publisher=Media mice|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308060346/http://permaculture.mediamice.net/?page_id=26|archivedate=8 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher = Transition culture | url=http://transitionculture.org/2009/02/11/film-review-%E2%80%9Cestablishing-a-food-forest-the-permaculture-way-series/| date = 11 February 2009 | title= Establishing a Food Forest | type = film review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tree Gardens, such as Kandyan tree gardens, in South and Southeast Asia, are often hundreds of years old.  It is not self-evident whether these tree gardens derived initially from experiences of cultivation and forestry, as is the case in agroforestry, or whether they derived from an understanding of forest ecosystems, as is the case for permaculture systems.  Many studies of these systems, especially those that predate the term permaculture, consider these systems to be forms of agroforestry.  Permaculturalists may obscure the distinction of permaculture and agroforestry when they include existing and ancient systems of polycropping as examples of food forests.

Food forests and agroforestry are parallel approaches that sometimes lead to similar designs.

===Hügelkultur===
[[Hügelkultur]] is the practice of burying large volumes of wood to increase soil water retention. The porous structure of wood acts as a sponge when decomposing underground. During the rainy season, masses of buried wood can absorb enough water to sustain crops through the dry season.&lt;ref&gt;Wheaton, Paul. [http://www.richsoil.com/hugelkultur/ "Raised garden beds: hugelkultur instead of irrigation"] Richsoil. Retrieved 15 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; This technique has been used by permaculturalists [[Sepp Holzer]], [[Toby Hemenway]], [[Paul Wheaton]], and [[Masanobu Fukuoka]].{{Sfn | Hemenway | 2009 | pp = 84–85}}&lt;ref&gt;Feineigle, Mark. [http://permaculture.org.au/2012/01/04/hugelkultur-composting-whole-trees-with-ease/#more-6825 "Hugelkultur: Composting Whole Trees With Ease"]. Permaculture Research Institute of Australia. Retrieved 15 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural building===
A [[natural building]] involves a range of [[building]] systems and materials that place major emphasis on sustainability.  Ways of achieving sustainability through natural building focus on durability and the use of minimally processed, plentiful or [[renewable resource]]s, as well as those that, while [[Recycling|recycled]] or salvaged, produce healthy living environments and maintain indoor air quality.

The basis of natural building is the need to lessen the [[natural environment|environmental]] impact of buildings and other supporting systems, without sacrificing comfort, health, or [[aesthetics]]. Natural building primarily utilizes abundantly available natural materials (e.g., clay, rock, sand, straw, wood, reeds), and draws heavily on traditional architectural strategies from various climates across the world.  In addition to relying on natural building materials, the emphasis on the architectural design is heightened. The orientation of a building, the utilization of local climate and site conditions, the emphasis on natural ventilation through design, fundamentally lessen operational costs and positively impact the environment. Building compactly and minimizing the [[ecological footprint]] is common, as are on-site handling of energy acquisition, on-site water capture, alternate sewage treatment, and water reuse.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Most materials are sourced regionally, locally, or even on-site. Straw bales, and various earthen masonry techniques such as adobe bricks, cob (or monolithic adobe), rammed earth and clay-straw infill are common choices for wall material. Roofing coverings often used include sod or "living" roofs, thatch, and wooden shakes or shingles. Rubble trench foundations are popular, as they do not require concrete; likewise, dry-stacked or lime mortared stem walls are common. Natural builders also regularly combine different wall systems in a single building, making best use of different materials' thermal or water resistant properties, for example, where they are most needed in the structure.

===Rainwater harvesting===
[[Rainwater harvesting]] is the accumulating and storing of rainwater for reuse before it reaches the [[aquifer]].&lt;ref name="Rainwater harvesting"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://aramo.de/rain.html |title= Rainwater harvesting |year= 2012 |place= [[Germany|DE]] |publisher= Aramo |accessdate= 19 August 2015 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://archive.is/20130606063516/http://aramo.de/rain.html |archivedate= 6 June 2013 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been used to provide [[drinking water]], water for [[livestock]], water for [[irrigation]], as well as  other typical uses. Rainwater collected from the roofs of houses and local institutions can make an important contribution to the availability of drinking water. It can supplement the subsoil water level and increase urban greenery. Water collected from the ground, sometimes from areas which are especially prepared for this purpose, is called [[stormwater harvesting]].{{citation needed |date=June 2012}}

[[Greywater]] is [[wastewater]] generated from domestic activities such as laundry, dishwashing, and bathing, which can be recycled on-site for uses such as landscape irrigation and [[constructed wetland]]s. Greywater is largely sterile, but not potable (drinkable). Greywater differs from water from the toilets, which is designated [[sewage]] or [[Blackwater (waste)|blackwater]] to indicate it contains [[human waste]]. Blackwater is septic or otherwise toxic and cannot easily be reused. There are, however, continuing efforts to make use of blackwater or human waste. The most notable is for composting through a process known as humanure; a combination of the words human and manure. Additionally, the methane in humanure can be collected and used similar to natural gas as a fuel, such as for heating or cooking, and is commonly referred to as biogas. Biogas can be harvested from the human waste and the remainder still used as humanure.  Some of the simplest forms of humanure use include a composting toilet or an outhouse or dry bog surrounded by trees that are heavy feeders which can be coppiced for wood fuel. This process eliminates the use of a standard toilet with plumbing.{{Citation needed |date=August 2015}}

===Sheet mulching===
In agriculture and [[gardening]], mulch is a protective cover placed over the soil. Any material or combination can be used as mulch, such as stones, leaves, cardboard, wood chips, gravel, etc., though in permaculture mulches of organic material are the most common because they perform more functions.  These include absorbing rainfall, reducing evaporation, providing nutrients, increasing organic matter in the soil, feeding and creating habitat for soil organisms, suppressing weed growth and seed germination, moderating diurnal temperature swings, protecting against frost, and reducing erosion. [[Sheet mulching]] is an agricultural no-dig gardening technique that attempts to mimic natural processes occurring within [[forest]]s. Sheet mulching mimics the leaf cover that is found on forest floors. When deployed properly and in combination with other Permacultural principles, it can generate healthy, productive and low maintenance ecosystems.&lt;ref name="agroforestry"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.agroforestry.net/pubs/Sheet_Mulching.html |title=Sheet Mulching: Greater Plant and Soil Health for Less Work |publisher=Agroforestry |date=3 September 2011 |accessdate=21 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021210053204/http://www.agroforestry.net/pubs/Sheet_Mulching.html |archivedate=10 December 2002 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "mason"&gt;{{Citation | title = Sustainable Agriculture | first = J | last = Mason | publisher = Landlinks | year = 2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed |date=August 2015}}

Sheet mulch serves as a "nutrient bank," storing the nutrients contained in organic matter and slowly making these nutrients available to plants as the organic matter slowly and naturally breaks down. It also improves the soil by attracting and feeding [[earthworms]], [[woodlouse|slaters]] and many other soil micro-organisms, as well as adding [[humus]]. Earthworms "till" the soil, and their [[worm castings]] are among the best fertilizers and [[soil conditioner]]s. Sheet mulching can be used to reduce or eliminate non-desired plants by starving them of light, and can be more advantageous than using [[herbicide]] or other methods of control. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stratton|first1=Margie Lynn|last2=Barker|first2=Allen|last3=Ragsdale|first3=James|title=Sheet composting overpowers weeds in restoration project|journal=BioCycle|date=April 2000|volume=41|issue=4|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intensive rotational grazing===
Grazing has long been blamed for much of the destruction we see in the environment. However, it has been shown that when grazing is modeled after nature, the opposite effect can be seen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prince Charles sends a message to IUCN's World Conservation Congress|url=http://www.iucn.org/knowledge/multimedia/video/?10774/Prince-Charles-sends-a-message-to-IUCNs-World-Conservation-Congress|work=International Union for Conservation of Nature|accessdate=6 April 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315111928/http://www.iucn.org/knowledge/multimedia/video/?10774%2FPrince-Charles-sends-a-message-to-IUCNs-World-Conservation-Congress|archivedate=15 March 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Undersander|first=Dan|title=Grassland birds: Fostering habitat using rotational grazing|url=http://learningstore.uwex.edu/assets/pdfs/a3715.pdf|publisher=University of Wisconsin-Extension|accessdate=5 April 2013|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also known as cell grazing, [[managed intensive rotational grazing]] (MIRG) is a system of grazing in which ruminant and non-ruminant herds or flocks are regularly and systematically moved to fresh pasture, range, or forest with the intent to maximize the quality and quantity of forage growth. This disturbance is then followed by a period of rest which allows new growth. MIRG can be used with cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, chickens, rabbits, geese, turkeys, ducks, and other animals depending on the natural [[ecological community]] that is being mimicked. [[Sepp Holzer]] and [[Joel Salatin]] have shown how the disturbance caused by the animals can be the spark needed to start [[ecological succession]] or prepare ground for planting. [[Allan Savory]]'s [[holistic management]] technique has been likened to "a permaculture approach to [[rangeland management]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Meat: A Benign Extravagance | first=Simon | last= Fairlie | publisher= Chelsea Green | year= 2010 |isbn= 978-1-60358325-1 | pages = 191–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bradley|first=Kirsten|title=Holistic Management: Herbivores, Hats, and Hope|url=http://milkwood.net/2010/04/27/holistic_management_herbivores_hats_and_hope/|publisher=Milkwood|accessdate=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One variation on MIRG that is gaining rapid popularity is called eco-grazing. Often used to either control invasives or re-establish native species, in eco-grazing the primary purpose of the animals is to benefit the environment and the animals can be, but are not necessarily, used for meat, milk or fiber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Munching sheep replace lawn mowers in Paris| url= http://www.straitstimes.com/breaking-news/world/story/munching-sheep-replace-lawn-mowers-paris-20130404| work= The Sunday Times | date =  4 April 2013 |accessdate=7 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Ash|first=Andrew|others=et al.|title=The Ecograze Project – developing guidelines to better manage grazing country|format=[[Portable document format|PDF]]|url=http://www.cse.csiro.au/publications/2002/Ecograzepart1.pdf|isbn=0-9579842-0-0|publisher=CSIRO|accessdate=7 April 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120410052228/http://www.cse.csiro.au/publications/2002/Ecograzepart1.pdf|archivedate=10 April 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McCarthy|first=Caroline|title=Things to make you happy: Google employs goats|url= http://news.cnet.com/things-to-make-you-happy-google-employs-goats/?tag=mncol;title | work = CNET | accessdate =7 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gordon|first=Ian|title=A systems approach to livestock/resource  interactions in tropical pasture systems|url=http://www.be-troplive.be/betroplive/pdf/20121205_944831251_2%20iain%20gordon.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203081104/http://www.be-troplive.be/betroplive/pdf/20121205_944831251_2%20iain%20gordon.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=3 February 2014|work=The James Hutton Institute|accessdate=7 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Littman|first= Margaret|title= Getting your goat: Eco-friendly mowers | url = http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-07-26/classified/sc-home-0725-garden-goat-20110726_1_goats-invasive-plants-gardeners |work=Chicago Tribune News|accessdate=7 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stevens|first=Alexis|title= Kudzu-eating sheep take a bite out of weeds|url=http://www.ajc.com/news/news/local/kudzu-eating-sheep-take-a-bite-out-of-weeds/nQwKL/ |work= The Atlanta Journal-Constitution|accessdate=7 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Klynstra|first=Elizabeth|title= Hungry sheep invade Candler Park|url=http://www.cbsatlanta.com/story/19864571/100-sheep|work=CBS Atlanta|accessdate=7 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Keyline design===
[[Keyline design]] is a technique for maximizing the beneficial use of water resources of a piece of land developed in Australia by farmer and engineer [[P. A. Yeomans]]. The ''Keyline'' refers to a specific [[topography|topographic feature]] linked to water flow which is used in designing the drainage system of the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | type = video | url = http://www.permaculture.co.uk/videos/creating-permaculture-keyline-water-systems-don-tipping | title = Creating Permaculture Keyline Water Systems | first = Don | last = Tipping | place = UK | publisher =Beaver State Permaculture | date= 4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The essential factor in this system, the Keyline, is a level or sloping line extending in both directions from a point or divides the two types of relationship, always in the same vertical interval, that a valley bears to its ridges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Keyline plan|last=Yeomas|first=P.A|publisher=Authour|year=1954|isbn=|location=Australia|pages=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fruit tree management===
Some proponents of permaculture advocate no, or limited, pruning. One advocate of this approach is [[Sepp Holzer]] who used the method in connection with [[Hügelkultur]] [[berms]].  He has successfully grown several varieties of fruiting trees at altitudes (approximately {{convert |9000|ft|m}}) far above their normal altitude, temperature, and snow load ranges.  He notes that the Hügelkultur berms kept or generated enough heat to allow the roots to survive during alpine winter conditions.  The point of having unpruned branches, he notes, was that the longer (more naturally formed) branches bend over under the snow load until they touched the ground, thus forming a natural arch against snow loads that would break a shorter, pruned, branch.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

[[Masanobu Fukuoka]], as part of early experiments on his family farm in Japan, experimented with no-pruning methods, noting that he ended up killing many fruit trees by simply letting them go, which made them become convoluted and tangled, and thus unhealthy.&lt;ref name="Natural Way Farming-Pruning"&gt;{{Citation | last = Masanobu | first = Fukuoka | origyear = 1985 | edition = rev | year = 1987 | title = The Natural Way of Farming – The Theory and Practice of Green Philosophy | publisher = Japan Publications | place = Tokyo | page = 204}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn | Fukuoka | 1978 | pp = 13, 15–18, 46, 58–60}}{{Page needed |date=August 2015}} Then he realised this is the difference between natural-form fruit trees and the process of change of tree form that results from abandoning previously-pruned unnatural fruit trees.&lt;ref name = "Natural Way Farming-Pruning" /&gt;{{Sfn | Fukuoka | 1978}}{{Page needed |date=August 2015}}  He concluded that the trees should be raised all their lives without pruning, so they form healthy and efficient branch patterns that follow their natural inclination. This is part of his implementation of the [[Tao]]-philosophy of [[Wu wei|Wú wéi]] translated in part as no-action (against nature), and he described it as no unnecessary pruning, nature farming or "do-nothing" farming, of fruit trees, distinct from non-intervention or literal no-pruning.

Permaculture helps generate plans that are easy and cheap when it comes to production. Permaculture allows creativity and innovation in farming. The action of permaculture looks and all becoming consciously involved in the process of producing and ensuring abundant food nearby, problem on malnutrition caused by the world hunger problem will inevitably lessen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kasarinlan|first=|year=2011|title=Permaculture as Alternative Agriculture|url=http://www.journals.upd.edu.ph/index.php/kasarinlan/article/viewFile/3511/pdf_149|journal=Philippine|volume=26|pages=422–434|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Permaculture principles in action are powerful forces to help right the environmental wrongs of the last two centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.solscape.co.nz/permaculture-sustainability/|title=Permaculture and Sustainability - Solscape|work=Solscape|access-date=6 April 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trademark and copyright issues==
There has been contention over who, if anyone, controls legal rights to the word ''permaculture'': is it [[trademark]]ed or [[copyright]]ed? If so, who holds the legal rights to the use of the word? For a long time Bill Mollison claimed to have copyrighted the word, and his books said on the [[copyright page]], "The contents of this book and the word PERMACULTURE are copyright." These statements were largely accepted at face value within the permaculture community. However, copyright law does not protect names, ideas, concepts, systems, or methods of doing something; it only protects the expression or the description of an idea, not the idea itself. Eventually Mollison acknowledged that he was mistaken and that no copyright protection existed for the word ''permaculture''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Permaculture Papers 5: time of change and challenge — 2000-2004 | url = http://pacific-edge.info/the-permaculture-papers-5-time-of-change-and-challenge-%E2%80%94-2000-2004/ | first = Russ | last = Grayson | publisher= Pacific edge |accessdate=8 September 2011 |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Mollison's US based Permaculture Institute sought a [[service mark]] (a form of trademark) for the word ''permaculture'' when used in educational services such as conducting classes, seminars, or workshops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Trademark Electronic Search System (TESS)| url = http://tess2.uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=doc&amp;state=4005:o81il1.2.1 |author= [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] |publisher= US Department of Commerce |accessdate=8 September 2011|year= 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The service mark would have allowed Mollison and his two Permaculture Institutes (one in the US and one in Australia) to set enforceable guidelines regarding how permaculture could be taught and who could teach it, particularly with relation to the PDC, despite the fact that he had instituted a system of certification of teachers to teach the PDC in 1993. The service mark failed and was abandoned in 2001. Also in 2001 Mollison applied for trademarks in Australia for the terms "Permaculture Design Course"&lt;ref name="IPA"&gt;{{cite web | title = Result | url = http://pericles.ipaustralia.gov.au/atmoss/Falcon.Result |publisher =[[IP Australia]] |accessdate=8 September 2011| year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Permaculture Design".&lt;ref name ="IPA"/&gt; These applications were both withdrawn in 2003. In 2009 he sought a trademark for "Permaculture: A Designers’ Manual"&lt;ref name="IPA"/&gt; and "Introduction to Permaculture",&lt;ref name="IPA"/&gt; the names of two of his books. These applications were withdrawn in 2011. There has never been a trademark for the word ''permaculture'' in Australia.&lt;ref name="IPA" /&gt;

==Criticisms==
===General criticisms===
In 2011, Owen Hablutzel argued that "permaculture has yet to gain a large amount of specific mainstream scientific acceptance," and that "the sensitiveness to being perceived and accepted on scientific terms is motivated in part by a desire for permaculture to expand and become increasingly relevant."

In his books ''Sustainable Freshwater Aquaculture'' and ''Farming in Ponds and Dams'', Nick Romanowski expresses the view that the presentation of aquaculture in Bill Mollison's books is unrealistic and misleading.&lt;ref name="Romanowski2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nick Romanowski|title=Sustainable Freshwater Aquaculture: The Complete Guide from Backyard to Investor|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eOCHj_b16jgC|year=2007|publisher=UNSW Press|isbn=978-0-86840-835-4|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agroforestry===
Greg Williams argues that forests cannot be more productive than farmland because the net productivity of forests declines as they mature due to [[ecological succession]].&lt;ref name="Williams 2001"&gt;{{cite news| work=Whole Earth | title= Gaia’s Garden: A Guide to Home-Scale Permaculture | first=Greg | last= Williams | year= 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of permaculture respond that this is true only if one compares data between woodland forest and climax vegetation, but not when comparing farmland vegetation with woodland forest.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} For example, ecological succession generally results in a forest's productivity rising after its establishment only until it reaches the ''woodland state'' (67% tree cover), before declining until ''full maturity''.&lt;ref name="Edible Forest Gardening" /&gt;

{{Law enforcement in the United Kingdom}}

A '''police area''' is the area for which a [[territorial police force]] in the [[United Kingdom]] is responsible for [[policing]].  

Every location in the [[United Kingdom]] has a designated territorial police force with statutory responsibility for providing policing services and enforcing criminal law, which is set out in the various police areas below.  [[Special police forces]] and other non territorial constabularies do not have police areas and their respective specialist areas of responsibility are shared with the relevant geographic territorial police force.  Ultimately the Chief Officer of a territorial police force has primacy over all law enforcement within his police area even if it is within the remit of a special police force such as the [[British Transport Police]] on the railway infrastructure or the [[Ministry of Defence Police]] on MOD property.

==History==
The [[Metropolitan Police District]] was the first example of a police area - when it was created, all other police forces were responsible for one [[county]] or [[county borough]] only. Police areas were introduced with the passage of the [[Police Act 1964]] and [[Police (Scotland) Act 1967]], when a number of small (mainly county borough) police forces were merged with county ones. 

The current system of police areas in England and Wales is set out by [http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&amp;title=police+act&amp;Year=1996&amp;searchEnacted=0&amp;extentMatchOnly=0&amp;confersPower=0&amp;blanketAmendment=0&amp;sortAlpha=0&amp;TYPE=QS&amp;PageNumber=1&amp;NavFrom=0&amp;parentActiveTextDocId=2729388&amp;ActiveTextDocId=2729393&amp;filesize=3454 Section 1] of the [[Police Act 1996]].

There are 43 police areas in [[England and Wales]], most of which are defined by [http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&amp;title=police+act&amp;Year=1996&amp;searchEnacted=0&amp;extentMatchOnly=0&amp;confersPower=0&amp;blanketAmendment=0&amp;sortAlpha=0&amp;TYPE=QS&amp;PageNumber=1&amp;NavFrom=0&amp;parentActiveTextDocId=2729388&amp;ActiveTextDocId=2729538&amp;filesize=295 Schedule 1] of the 1996 act. They may be altered by order of the [[Home Secretary]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&amp;title=police+act&amp;Year=1996&amp;searchEnacted=0&amp;extentMatchOnly=0&amp;confersPower=0&amp;blanketAmendment=0&amp;sortAlpha=0&amp;TYPE=QS&amp;PageNumber=1&amp;NavFrom=0&amp;parentActiveTextDocId=2729388&amp;ActiveTextDocId=2729443&amp;filesize=4564 Section 32, Police Act 1996]&lt;/ref&gt; The two other areas, the Metropolitan Police District and the City of London police area, are defined by [http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&amp;title=London+Government+Act+1963&amp;searchEnacted=0&amp;extentMatchOnly=0&amp;confersPower=0&amp;blanketAmendment=0&amp;sortAlpha=0&amp;TYPE=QS&amp;PageNumber=1&amp;NavFrom=0&amp;parentActiveTextDocId=548283&amp;ActiveTextDocId=548358&amp;filesize=2697 Section 76] of the [[London Government Act 1963]] and the City of London Police Act 1839 respectively.

Northern Ireland and Scotland each have only one territorial police force: the [[Police Service of Northern Ireland]] (PSNI) and [[Police Scotland|Police Service of Scotland]].

A '''prairie remnant''' commonly refers to grassland areas in the [[Western United States|Western]] and [[Midwestern United States]] and [[Canada]] that remain to some extent [[remnant natural area|undisturbed by European settlement]]. Prairie remnants range in levels of degradation but nearly all contain at least some semblance of the [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] local [[plant community|plant assemblage]] of a particular region. Prairie remnants have become increasingly threatened due to the threats of agricultural, urban and suburban development, pollution, [[Fire_ecology#Some_examples_of_fire_in_different_ecosystems|fire]] suppression, and the incursion of invasive species.&lt;ref name=packard1997&gt;{{cite book |editor-last1=Packard |editor-first1=Stephen |editor-link1=Stephen Packard |editor-last2=Mutel |editor-first2=Cornelia F.|editor-link2=Cornelia Mutel |date=1997 |title=The Tallgrass Restoration Handbook: For Prairies, Savannas, and Woodlands |publisher=Island Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=greenberg2004&gt;{{cite book |title=A Natural History of the Chicago Region |last=Greenberg |first=Joel |authorlink=Joel Greenberg |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OXA1VVOSUg4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=A+Natural+History+of+the+Chicago+Region&amp;hl=en&amp;src=bmrr&amp;ei=qendTdPdB5GCsQOx3fGiBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=warren%20woods&amp;f=false |year=2004 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-30649-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prairie remnants in restoration ecology ==
Prairie remnants offer valuable varieties of rare species thus providing excellent opportunities for [[restoration ecology]] projects. Many restoration projects are simply recreations of prairie habitats, but restoring prairie remnants provides the preservation of more complete ecological structures that were naturally created after the end of the last ice age. Remnants can also serve as platforms for additional surrounding [[ecological restoration]] activities.&lt;ref name=greenberg2004/&gt;

== Tallgrass prairies in North America ==
It has been estimated that 99% of [[tallgrass prairie]] habitats in North America have been destroyed mainly due to conversion to agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fws.gov/refuge/Crescent_Lake/what_we_do/resource_management/prairies.html Crescent Lake Wildlife Refuge, Nebraska] U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service, Retrieved 29 November 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Tallgrass prairies are generally composed of a mixture of native grasses, sedges, and forbs but are usually dominated by grasses.

== Shortgrass prairies in North America ==
The [[shortgrass prairie]] is an ecosystem located in the [[Great Plains]] of North America. The prairie includes lands to the west as far as the eastern foothills of the [[Rocky Mountains]] and extends east as far as [[Nebraska]] and north into [[Saskatchewan]]. The prairie stretches through parts of Alberta, Wyoming, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Kansas, and passes south through the high plains of Colorado, Oklahoma, Texas, and New Mexico.

He led a commercial expedition from Bristol in 1457–58 to break the Italian monopoly on trade to the Eastern [[Mediterranean]].&lt;ref&gt;E. M. Carus-Wilson, ‘The overseas trade of Bristol in the fifteenth century’ in E. Power and M. M. Postan, ''Studies in English Trade in the Fifteenth Century'', (London, 1933), pp. 225-30&lt;/ref&gt; If he had been successful, it would have allowed [[England]] to gain direct access to both the Oriental spices that entered Europe via the [[Ottoman Empire]] and to [[alum]] from [[Chios]].&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Jenks, ''Robert Sturmy's Commercial Expedition to the Mediterranean (1457/8)'' (Bristol Record Society Publications, Vol. 58, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; His three-ship voyage was backed by powerful interests in England, but opposed by the Italian merchants who controlled most of Europe's long-distance trade and banking at this time. In the event, the ships succeeded in conducting their trade but were then set upon by [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]]-backed pirates on their return home. At the end of what was reported to be a three-day running battle, the Bristol fleet was captured off [[Malta]] with the loss of 128 men, including Sturmy.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Jenks, ‘Sturmy, Robert (d. 1458)’, ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2008 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/52221, accessed 7 Jan 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; The financial losses, which were claimed  to amount to £6,000, were to lead to the arrest of the entire Genoese community in England and the seizure of their assets. Such an extreme reaction is less surprising when it is considered that, relative to the size of the contemporary English economy, the losses would be equivalent to c. £750 million today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hdl.handle.net/1983/598 E. T. Jones, 'Preface' to Stuart Jenks (ed.), ''Robert Sturmy’s Commercial Expedition To The Mediterranean'']&lt;/ref&gt; The effect was thought to stymie English ambitions in the Mediterranean for at least half-a-century, although it may also have helped to persuade Bristol merchants to turn their attention to [[Atlantic]] exploration. These westwards voyages included the expeditions to try to locate the island of [[Hy-Brazil]] in the 1480s, as well as [[John Cabot|John Cabot's]] expeditions of 1496-98, which resulted in the European discovery of [[North America]] in 1497.

'''Sally Eden''' (1967–2016) was a British [[geographer]] and Professor of [[Human geography]] at the [[University of Hull]].

==Scholarly contributions==
Sally Eden’s research and writing focuses on important and significant questions about how society understands and manages the environment, including issues of sustainable consumption, [[Sustainable living|green lifestyles]], environmental action and forms of public engagement with the environment. In a series of research projects she examined how scientific knowledge about the environment is used within and outside of government, how river restoration projects are designed and justified and how ordinary people get involved with and make sense of how environments are managed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.aag.org/2016/10/in-memoriam-sally-eden/|title=In Memoriam Sally Eden |publisher=American Association of Geographers|accessdate=13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her writing she has developed carefully critical lines of analysis and argument drawing on concepts from human geography but also science and technology studies and environmental politics. Much of her work has been drawn together in the book ‘Environmental Publics’ (Routledge 2017) which from the starting point that ‘the public’ is not one thing and their engagements with the environment take multiple forms, provides a fascinating account of how environmental publics know, participate, consume, enjoy, campaign, vote and work.

The '''Solomon Islands''' are an [[archipelago]] in the western [[South Pacific Ocean]], located northeast of Australia. They are in the [[Melanesia]] subregion and [[bioregion]] of Oceania. The archipelago forms much of the territory of [[Solomon Islands]], while the northwestern islands are within the [[Autonomous Region of Bougainville]], in eastern [[Papua New Guinea]]. It forms the eastern boundary of the [[Solomon Sea]].

==Geography==
The Solomon Islands consist of both [[High island|volcanic island]]s of varying activity and of [[coral atoll]]s. [[Bougainville Island]] is the largest in the archipelago.

===Climate===
The climate of the islands is tropical, however temperatures do not greatly fluctuate due to the [[heat sink]] of the surrounding ocean. Daytime temperatures are normally {{Convert|25|to|32|C}} and {{Convert|13|to|15|C}} at night. From April to October (the dry season), the southeast trade winds blow, gusting at times up to {{Convert|30|knot|round=5}} or more.

November to March is the wet season, caused by the northwest monsoon, and is typically warmer and wetter. Cyclones arise in the Coral Sea and the area of the Solomon Islands, but they usually veer toward Vanuatu and New Caledonia or down the coast of Australia.

==History==
{{see also|History of Solomon Islands|History of Bougainville}}

===Prehistory===
It is believed that [[East Papuan languages|Papuan]]-speaking settlers began to arrive around 30,000 BCE from [[New Ireland (island)|New Ireland]]. It was the furthest humans went in the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] until [[Austronesia]]n speakers arrived c. 4000 BCE, also bringing cultural elements such as the [[outrigger canoe]].&lt;ref name=Kirch&gt;[[Patrick Vinton Kirch|Kirch, Patrick Vinton]] (2002). [https://books.google.com/books?id=qQ0ApgIOPtEC&amp;pg=PP1 ''On the Road of the Winds: An Archaeological History of the Pacific Islands'']. Berkeley, California: University of California Press. {{ISBN|0-520-23461-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is between 1200 and 800 BCE that the ancestors of the [[Polynesia]]ns, the [[Lapita]] people, arrived from the [[Bismarck Archipelago]] with their characteristic [[ceramic]]s.&lt;ref name=Kirch/&gt; Most of the languages spoken today in the Solomon Islands derive from this era, but some thirty languages of the pre-Austronesian settlers survive ''(see [[East Papuan languages]]).''

===European period===
The first European to visit the islands was the Spanish navigator [[Álvaro de Mendaña de Neira]], coming from the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]] to the [[Spanish East Indies]] in 1568. The people of Solomon Islands had engaged in [[headhunting]] and [[cannibalism]] before the arrival of the Europeans.&lt;ref&gt;"''[https://books.google.com/books?id=YM18gG16Z7YC&amp;pg=PA103 From primitive to postcolonial in Melanesia and anthropology]''". Bruce M. Knauft (1999). [[University of Michigan Press]]. p.103. {{ISBN|0-472-06687-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Missionaries began visiting the Solomons in the mid-19th century. They made little progress at first, because "[[blackbirding]]", the often brutal recruitment and relocation of labourers for the sugar plantations in [[Queensland]] and [[Fiji]], led to a series of reprisals and massacres. In 1885 the Germans declared a protectorate over the northern islands, to form the [[German Solomon Islands|German Solomon Islands Protectorate]]. The evils of the labour trade prompted the United Kingdom to declare a protectorate over the southern islands in June 1893, the [[British Solomon Islands Protectorate]].

In 1900, under the [[Treaty of Berlin (1899)|Treaty of Berlin]], the Germans transferred a number of their Solomon Islands to the [[British Solomon Islands Protectorate]]. The remaining German Solomon Islands, at the extreme northwest of the archipelago, were retained by Germany until they fell to Australia early on in [[World War I]]. After the war the [[League of Nations]] formally mandated those islands to Australia along with the rest of [[German New Guinea]], becoming Australian New Guinea.

During [[World War II]], the [[Territory of Papua]] and the Mandated [[Territory of New Guinea]] were within the [[Australian New Guinea Administrative Unit]] (1942–1946). After the war the Australian Territory of New Guinea was administered separately from the neighbouring Territory of Papua until the year 1949 when the two territories were formally united into the [[Territory of Papua and New Guinea]].

===Independence===
The [[Territory of Papua and New Guinea]] became independent from Australia in the year 1975 as the modern state of [[Papua New Guinea]]. The [[Autonomous Region of Bougainville]] of Papua New Guinea was established in the northern Solomon Islands in 2000.

Following the independence of neighbouring Papua New Guinea from Australia in 1975, the [[British Solomon Islands]] gained self-government in 1976. Independence for the [[Solomon Islands]] nation was granted on 7 July 1978.

==Demographics==
The population of the Solomons is mostly [[Melanesian]], although minority [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] and Micronesian communities exist. There has also been a large influx of Chinese immigrants.

===Language===
{{main|Languages of the Solomon Islands}}
Around 60 to 70 languages are spoken in the [[Solomon Islands]]. Many [[Melanesian languages]] (predominantly of the [[Southeast Solomonic languages|Southeast Solomonic group]]) and [[Polynesian languages]] are native to the area. Immigrant populations speak [[Micronesian languages]]. English is an official language in both areas of the archipelago. There are three families of [[Papuan languages|Papuan languages]] native to the archipelago: the [[North Bougainville languages]], [[South Bougainville languages]], and the [[Central Solomon languages]].

===Religion===
The predominant religion on the islands is Christianity, with the largest denomination being the [[Anglican Church of Melanesia]].

==Governance==
Governance of the Solomon Islands archipelago is split between the state of [[Solomon Islands]] and the [[Autonomous Region of Bougainville]] in Papua New Guinea. Both countries are constitutional monarchies and [[Commonwealth realm]]s. Bougainville is considering independence from Papua New Guinea.

The field reflects a desire to give the generalities and broad-based approach of “[[sustainability]]” a stronger analytic and scientific underpinning as it "brings together scholarship and practice, global and local perspectives from north and south, and disciplines across the natural and social sciences, engineering, and medicine".&lt;ref&gt;Clark, W.C., &amp; Dickson, N. M. 2003. Sustainability science: The emerging research program. ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA'' 100(14): 8059-8061.&lt;/ref&gt; Ecologist [[William C. Clark]] proposes that it can be usefully thought of as "neither 'basic' nor 'applied' research but as a field defined by the problems it addresses rather than by the disciplines it employs" and that it "serves the need for advancing both knowledge and action by creating a dynamic bridge between the two".&lt;ref&gt;Clark, W.C. 2007. "Sustainability Science: A room of its own". ''Proceedings of the National Academy of  Science'' 104: 1737-1738; published online on February 6, 2007, 10.1073/pnas.0611291104&lt;/ref&gt;

The field is focused on examining the interactions between human, environmental, and engineered systems to understand and contribute to solutions for complex challenges that threaten the future of humanity and the integrity of the life support systems of the planet, such as climate change, [[biodiversity loss]], pollution and land and water degradation.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.earthsystemgovernance.net/conceptual-foundations/?page_id=73 Sustainability Science]". ''Task Force on Conceptual Foundations''. [[Earth System Governance Project]]. earthsystemgovernance.net. Retrieved 2017-07-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sustainability science, like [[sustainability]] itself, derives some impetus from the concepts of [[sustainable development]] and [[environmental science]].&lt;ref name="ensci.iastate.edu"&gt;[http://www.ensci.iastate.edu Environmental Science: Iowa State University&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Sustainability science provides a critical framework for sustainability&lt;ref&gt;Komiyama, H., Takeuchi, K. 2006. Sustainability science: building a new discipline. Sustainability Science 1:1–6.&lt;/ref&gt; while [[sustainability measurement]] provides the evidence-based quantitative data needed to guide [[sustainability governance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.accaglobal.com/publicinterest/activities/research/reports/sustainable_and_transparent/rr-078 |title=Sustainability Accounting in UK Local Government |publisher=The Association of Chartered Certified Accountants |accessdate=2008-06-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411231334/http://www.accaglobal.com/publicinterest/activities/research/reports/sustainable_and_transparent/rr-078 |archivedate=2008-04-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Consensual definition of sustainability science is as elusive as the definition of "sustainability" or "sustainable development". In an overview presented on its website in 2008 the Sustainability Science Program at [[Harvard University]] described the field in the following way, stressing its [[interdisciplinarity]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;'Sustainability science' is problem-driven, interdisciplinary scholarship that seeks to facilitate the design, implementation, and evaluation of effective interventions that foster shared prosperity and reduced poverty while protecting the environment. It is defined by the problems it addresses rather than the disciplines it employs. It thus draws as needed from multiple disciplines of the natural, social, medical and engineering sciences, from the professions, and from the knowledge of practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cid.harvard.edu./sustsci/overview.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081119091925/http://www.cid.harvard.edu./sustsci/overview.html|archive-date=November 19, 2008 |title=Overview |work=Sustainable Science Program |publisher=Harvard University |access-date=2017-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; [[Susan Kieffer|Susan W. Kieffer]] and colleagues, in 2003, suggested, more specifically, that sustainability science is: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;...&amp;nbsp;the cultivation, integration, and application of knowledge about Earth systems gained especially from the holistic and historical sciences (such as geology, ecology, climatology, oceanography) coordinated with knowledge about human interrelationships gained from the social sciences and humanities, in order to evaluate, mitigate, and minimize the consequences, regionally and worldwide, of human impacts on planetary systems and on societies across the globe and into the future&amp;nbsp;– that is, in order that humans can be knowledgeable Earth stewards.&lt;ref&gt;Kieffer, S.W., Barton, P., Palmer, A.R., Reitan, P.H., &amp; Zen, E. 2003. "Megascale events: Natural disasters and human behavior". Geological Society of America Abstracts with programs: 432.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It has been noted that the new paradigm &lt;blockquote&gt;...&amp;nbsp;must encompass different magnitudes of scales (of time, space, and function), multiple balances (dynamics), multiple actors (interests) and multiple failures (systemic faults).&lt;ref&gt;Reitan, P. 2005. Sustainability science – and what’s needed beyond science. Sustainability: Science, Practice, &amp; Policy 1(1):77-80.

Others take a much broader view of sustainability science, emphasizing the need to analyze the root causes of the fundamental unsustainability of the prevailing economic system, such as the emphasis on growth as key to solving political and social problems and advancing society's well-being. In a 2012 article entitled "Sustainability Science Needs to Include Sustainable Consumption," published in Environment: Science and Policy for Sustainable Development, Halina Brown argues that sustainability science must include the study of the sociology of material consumption and the structure of consumerist society, the role of technology in aggravating the unsustainable social practices, as well as in solving the problems they create, the macroeconomic theories that presuppose economic growth as a necessary condition for advancing societal well-being, and others.&lt;ref name="Brown 2012 20–25"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=Halina Szejnwald|title=Sustainability Science Needs to Include Sustainable Consumption|journal=Environment: Science and Policy for Sustainable Development|date=24 January 2012|volume=54|issue=1|pages=20–25|doi=10.1080/00139157.2012.639598|url=http://www.environmentmagazine.org/Archives/Back%20Issues/2012/January-February%202012/science-needs_Full.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Broad objectives==
The case for making research and development an important component of sustainable development strategies was embraced by many international scientific organizations in the mid-1980s, promoted by the Brundtland Commission's report ''[[Our Common Future]]'' in 1987, and noted in the ''[[Agenda 21]]'' plan that emerged from the ''[[United Nations Conference on Environment and Development]]'' in 1992 and further developed at the ''[[World Summit on Sustainable Development]]'', held in Johannesburg in 2002.

The topics of the following sub-headings indicate recurring themes that are addressed in the literature of sustainability science.&lt;ref&gt;Kauffmann, Joanne 2009. Advancing sustainability science: report on the International Conference on Sustainability Science (ICSS) 2009. ''Sustainability Science'' '''4''': 233-242.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 a compendium of basic papers in this new discipline was published as ''Readings in Sustainability Science and Technology'', edited by [[Robert Kates]], with a preface by William Clark.&lt;ref name="hks.harvard.edu"&gt;Kates, Robert W., ed. (2010). ''Readings in Sustainability Science and Technology''. CID Working Paper No. 213. Center for International Development, Harvard University. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University, December 2010. [https://www.hks.harvard.edu/centers/cid/publications/faculty-working-papers/cid-working-paper-no.-213 Abstract] and [https://www.hks.harvard.edu/content/download/69257/1249838/version/1/.../213.pdf PDF file] available on the Harvard Kennedy School website; retrieved 2017-07-16.&lt;/ref&gt; The 2012 Commentary by Halina Brown extensively expands the scope of that seminal publication.&lt;ref name="Brown 2012 20–25"/&gt; This is work in progress. The 2012 Encyclopedia of Sustainability Science and Technology was created as a collaboration of over 1000 scientists to provide peer-reviewed entries covering sustainability research and policy evaluations of technology.&lt;ref&gt;Meyers, R. (2012). Encyclopedia of sustainability science and technology. New York: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Knowledge structuring of issues===
Knowledge structuring has been identified as an essential first step in the effort to acquire a comprehensive view of sustainability issues which are both complex and interconnected. This is needed as a response to the requirements of academia, industry and government.

===Coordination of data===
The key research and data for sustainability are sourced from many scientific disciplines, topics and organisations. A major part of knowledge structuring will entail building up the tools that provide an “overview” of what is known. Sustainability science can construct and coordinate a framework within which the vast amount of data can be easily accessed.

===Interdisciplinary approaches===
The attempt, by sustainability science, to understand the integrated “whole” of planetary and human systems requires cooperation between scientific, social and economic disciplines, public and private sectors, academia and government. In short it requires a massive global cooperative effort and one major task of sustainability science is to assist integrated cross-disciplinary coordination.

'''Talish-i Gushtasbi''' ([[persian language|Persian]]: تالش گشتاسبی) is the historical name of the northern [[Talysh people|Talysh]] area, presently a part of the [[Republic of Azerbaijan]]. During the Abbasid Caliphate, there was a (partially equivalent) region called Gushtasfi ([[persian language|Persian]]: گشتاسفی). People of northern Talysh are of [[Iran]]ian stock and speak a northwestern [[Iranian language]] called [[Talysh language|Talysh]]. The chief cities of the area are [[Talesh, Iran|Talesh]], [[Lankaran]], [[Lerik, Azerbaijan|Lerik]], [[Masally]] and [[Astara, Azerbaijan|Astara]].

[[Peru]] requires its residents to register their [[motor vehicle]]s and display '''[[vehicle registration plate]]s'''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldlicenseplates.com/world/SA_PERU.html&lt;/ref&gt; Current plates are [[Vehicle_registration_plates_of_the_United_States#Designs_and_serial_formats|North American standard]] 6 × 12 inches (152 × 300 mm).

All vehicles are required to display plates on the front and back. Peculiarly, taxis in Peru are also required to display the characters of the license plates on each side of the vehicle. This is done with actual a large [[decal]].

==1974 - 1995 Series==
The first letter of these plates indicated the vehicle type, and the chart below shows the letters assigned to each type. The second letter indicated the region (or province for the City of Lima) where the vehicle was registered. The second chart below shows these codes.

==1995 - 2009 Series==
Plates issued during the years 1995 - 2009 continued to use the same format that was begun in 1975. The first letter continued to indicate the vehicle type, and the second letter indicated the region or province. These plates were black characters on a yellow background and they continued to use the same format, ABC-123, until all combinations in a region or province were exhausted. When complete, the old series was followed by plates with black characters on a white background, but they used the format AB-1234.

==2010 Series==
[[File:Peru_license_plate_dimensions_2010.png|400px|thumb|right|2010 license plate dimensions]]
The redesign of the Peruvian plates included many changes. The national flag of Peru is displayed in color, without the shield, in the upper left hand corner. The word Peru is centered at the top in all capital letters. There is a holographic label at the top right with the plate number and nanotext, and any attempt to remove it will cause its destruction. The background to the plate has reflective sheeting which contains a high security seal (watermark). At the lower left of the plate a security serial number is laser engraved into the plate. In the background of the center of the plate is a three-dimensional interwoven sine wave. The plates are made of aluminum and are 150 mm tall by 300 mm wide except for motorcycles which are 110 mm tall by 190 mm wide. The holographic seal is also smaller on the motorcycle plates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite act |title = Supreme Decree |number = 017-2008-MTC |date = 19 April 2008 |article = 9 |article-type = Annex IV, Article}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Region and province codes===
The new series of plates began to be issued in January 2010. The first character of the plate continued to designate the region or province, but the letters were reassigned to different regions. With the new plate colors representing the vehicle type, the second character no longer represented the vehicle type.&lt;ref name=AnnexIII&gt;{{Cite act |title = Supreme Decree |number = 017-2008-MTC |date = 19 April 2008 |article = 9 |article-type = Annex II, Article}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regular Series plates===
The second character of these plates first takes on a numerical value of 1 to 9 (in order) followed by the number 0, and then the letters of the alphabet in alphabetical order.&lt;ref name=Art9&gt;{{Cite act |title = Supreme Decree |number = 017-2008-MTC |date = 19 April 2008 |article = 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;   All vehicles now are issued the so-called "third plate" which is a windshield sticker that includes an RFID chip. The RFID chip allows the police to electronically verify the registration of the vehicle with a hand-held reader. The third plate cannot be removed from the windshield without it being destroyed.&lt;ref name=AnnexIII /&gt;

===Papal visit===
[[File:Matrícula pontificia Perú.png|200px|thumb|right|Plate issued for the Pope's visit to Perú in 2018]]
For the visit of the Roman Catholic Pope, Francis, from 18-21 January 2018, special license plates were created. These plates have all of the same security features as regular plates, but the coloring, yellow and white which are the official colors of the Holy See, the lettering, and the use of the coat of arms of the Vatican, are unique to these plates. Three license plates of the style shown here were produced. Additionally, there were 30 Exhibition plates issued for the Papal delegation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://peru21.pe/lima/papa-francisco-peru-significan-siglas-placa-papamovil-392304 |title=¿Qué significan las siglas 'SCV' de la placa del 'Papamóvil'? |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=17 January 2018 |website=Perú21  |publisher= |access-date=30 September 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://rpp.pe/economia/economia/papa-francisco-los-papamoviles-ya-cuentan-con-placa-de-rodaje-y-soat-noticia-1100242 |title=Papa Francisco: Los "Papamóviles" ya cuentan con placa de rodaje y SOAT |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=18 January 2018 |website=Mediakit Grupo RPP |publisher= |access-date=30 September 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Åland Islands''' or '''Åland''' ({{lang-sv|Åland}}, {{IPA-sv|ˈoːland|IPA}}; {{lang-fi|Ahvenanmaa}}) is an [[archipelago]] [[province]] at the entrance to the [[Gulf of Bothnia]] in the [[Baltic Sea]] belonging to [[Finland]]. It is [[Federacy|autonomous]], [[Demilitarized zone|demilitarised]] and is the only [[Monolingualism|monolingually]] [[Swedish language|Swedish-speaking]] region in Finland. It is the smallest [[Regions of Finland|region of Finland]], constituting 0.49% of its land area and 0.50% of its population.

Åland comprises [[Fasta Åland]] on which 90% of the population resides&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osterholm.info/aland/index.html|title=The Aland Islands|date=9 May 2012|website=Osterholm.info|accessdate=26 October 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509120701/http://www.osterholm.info/aland/index.html|archivedate=9 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a further 6,500 [[Skerry|skerries]] and islands to its east.&lt;ref name="readersnatural"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Natural Wonders of the World|publisher=Reader's Digest Association, Inc|year=1980|isbn=0-89577-087-3|editor-last=Scheffel|editor-first=Richard L.|location=United States of America|pages=3|quote=|editor-last2=Wernet|editor-first2=Susan J.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fasta Åland is separated from the coast of [[Sweden]] by {{convert|38|km|mi|0}} of open water to the west. In the east, the Åland archipelago is [[Geographic contiguity|contiguous]] with the Finnish [[Archipelago Sea]]. Åland's only land border is located on the uninhabited skerry of [[Märket]], which it shares with Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;An account of the border on Märket and how it was redrawn in 1985 appears in ''Hidden Europe Magazine'', 11 (November 2006) pp. 26–29, {{ISSN|1860-6318}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Åland's autonomous status means that those provincial powers normally exercised by representatives of the central Finnish government are largely exercised by [[Government of Åland|its own government]].

== Autonomy ==
{{see also|Special member state territories and the European Union}}

The autonomous status of the islands was affirmed by a decision made by the [[League of Nations]] in 1921 following the [[Åland Islands dispute]]. It was reaffirmed within the treaty admitting Finland to the [[European Union]]. By law, Åland is politically neutral and entirely demilitarised, and residents are exempt from [[conscription]] to the [[Finnish Defence Forces]]. The islands were granted extensive autonomy by the [[Parliament of Finland]] in the Act on the Autonomy of Åland of 1920, which was later replaced by new legislation by the same name in 1951 and 1991. The [[constitution of Finland]] defines a "[[constitution of Åland]]" by referring to this act. Åland remains exclusively Swedish-speaking by this act.&lt;ref name="FINLEX"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.finlex.fi/en/laki/kaannokset/1991/en19911144.pdf |title=Act on the Autonomy of Åland  |date=1991 |website=Finlex |publisher= |access-date= 25 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In connection with Finland's admission to the European Union, a protocol was signed concerning the Åland Islands that stipulates, among other things, that provisions of the [[European Community Treaty]] shall not force a change of the existing restrictions for foreigners (i.e., persons who do not enjoy "home region rights"—{{lang|sv|hembygdsrätt}}—in Åland) to acquire and hold real property or to provide certain services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurooppatiedotus.fi/public/download.aspx?ID=123677&amp;GUID=%7B2534ca4e-598b-4ae6-b067-76c3b3715642%7D |title=Åland in the European Union |page=7  |date=2013 |website=Europe Information |publisher=Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland |access-date= 25 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
Åland's original name was in the [[Proto-Norse language]] *{{lang|non|Ahvaland}} which means "land of water". In Swedish, this first developed into {{lang|sv|Áland}} and eventually into {{lang|sv|Åland}}, literally "river land"—even though rivers are not a prominent feature of Åland's geography. The [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and [[Estonian language|Estonian]] names of the island, {{lang|fi|Ahvenanmaa}} and {{lang|et|Ahvenamaa}} ("[[perch]] land"), are seen to preserve another form of the old name.&lt;ref&gt;Virrankoski, Pentti (2001). {{lang|fi|Suomen historia. Ensimmäinen osa}}. SKS. {{ISBN|951-746-321-9}}. p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another theory suggests that the Finnish {{lang|fi|Ahvenanmaa}} would be the original name of the archipelago, from which the Swedish {{lang|sv|Åland}} derives.&lt;ref name="Hulden"&gt;Lars Hulden (2001)  ''Finlandssvenska bebyggelsenamn''; Svenska litteratursällskapet i Finland. {{ISBN|951-583-071-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The official name, {{lang|sv|Landskapet Åland}}, means "the Region of Åland"; {{lang|sv|landskap}} is [[cognate]] to English "landscape".

== History ==
{{main|History of the Åland Islands}}
[[File:Geographisch delineation öffver Ålandh.jpg|thumb|Swedish Map of Åland from before 1667 with shipping lanes, harbors, churches and various boundaries marked]]

Members of the [[Neolithic]] [[Comb Ceramic]] culture started settling the islands some 7000 years ago, after the islands had begun to re-emerge from the sea after being pushed down by the weight of the continental ice of the [[Last glacial period|latest ice age]]. Two neolithic cultures met on Åland: Comb Ceramic culture and later [[Pit–Comb Ware culture|Pit-Comb Ware culture]] which spread from the west.{{source?|date=September 2018}}&lt;ref name="MUSEUM"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alandsmuseum.ax/en/historiens-aland/ |title=åland, the history |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website= |publisher=Aland Museum |access-date=2016-01-15 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stone Age]] and [[Bronze Age]] people obtained food by hunting seals and birds, fishing, and gathering plants. They also started agriculture early on. In the [[Iron Age]], contacts to Scandinavia were increasing. From the [[Vikings|Viking age]] there are over 380 documented burial sites and six castle ruins.&lt;ref name="MUSEUM"/&gt;

The Åland Islands formed part of the territory ceded to [[Russian Empire|Russia]] by [[Sweden]] under the [[Treaty of Fredrikshamn]] in September 1809. As a result, they became part of the semi-[[Autonomous entity|autonomous]] [[Grand Duchy of Finland]]. During this process, Sweden failed to secure a provision that the islands not be fortified. The issue was important not only for Sweden but also for the United Kingdom, which was concerned that a military presence on the islands could threaten Britain's military and commercial interests.

In 1832, Russia started to fortify the islands with the great fortress of [[Bomarsund, Åland|Bomarsund]]. A combined British and French force of warships and marines captured and destroyed the fortress in 1854 as part of the [[Baltic theatre of the Crimean War|campaign in the Baltic]] during the [[Crimean War]]. The [[Treaty of Paris (1856)|1856 Treaty of Paris]] demilitarised the entire Åland archipelago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1918/03/24/121603852.pdf|title=Uneasy Sweden and the Menace of Prussianism; An Analysis of the Scandinavian Situation in View of Kaiser's Reported Ambition to Make the Baltic a German Lake|website=Query.nytimes.com|accessdate=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Finnish Civil War]], in 1918, [[Invasion of Åland#The Swedish invasion|Swedish troops intervened]] as a [[peacekeeping]] force between the Russian troops stationed on the islands and [[Whites (Finland)|"White"]] and [[Finnish Socialist Workers' Republic|"Red"]] Finnish troops who came from Finland over the frozen sea. (Historians{{who|date=July 2015}} point out that Sweden may have in reality planned to occupy the islands.) Within weeks, the Swedish troops gave way to [[Baltic Sea Division|German troops]] who [[Invasion of Åland#The German invasion|occupied Åland]] by request of the "White" (conservative) [[Senate of Finland]].

[[File:Historical province of Åland in Finland.png|left|upright|thumb|Åland (blue) with historical and modern provinces of Finland (yellow) juxtaposed.]]

After 1917 the residents of the islands worked towards having them ceded to Sweden. In 1919 [[Åland status referendum, 1919|a petition]] for secession from Finland and integration with Sweden was signed by 96.4% of the voters on the islands, with over 95% in favour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sudd.ch/event.php?lang=en&amp;id=ax011919|title=Åland-Inseln (Finnland), ??. Juni 1919 : Anschluss an Schweden [in German]|first=Beat Müller, beat (at-sign) sudd (dot)|last=ch|website=Sudd.ch|accessdate=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swedish nationalist sentiments had grown strong particularly as a result of the anti-Swedish tendencies in Finland and Finnish nationalism fueled by Finland's struggle to retain its autonomy and resistance against [[Russification of Finland|Russification]]. The [[Finland's language strife|conflict between the Swedish-speaking minority and the Finnish-speaking majority]] on the mainland, prominent in Finnish politics since the 1840s, contributed to the apprehension of the Åland population about its future in Finland.

Finland, however, declined to cede the islands and instead offered them an autonomous status. Nevertheless, the residents did not approve the offer, and the dispute over the islands was submitted to the [[League of Nations]]. The latter decided that Finland should retain [[sovereignty]] over the province but that the Åland Islands should be made an autonomous territory. Thus Finland was obliged to ensure the residents of the Åland Islands the right to maintain the Swedish language, as well as their own culture and local traditions. At the same time, an international treaty established the neutral status of Åland, prohibiting the placing of military installations or forces on the islands.&lt;ref name=ELGAN&gt;{{cite book |last=Elgán |first=Elisabeth |date=2015 |title=Historical Dictionary of Sweden |url= |location= |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |page=26 |isbn= 9781442250710  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The combination of disappointment about insufficient support from Sweden in the League of Nations, Swedish disrespect for Åland's demilitarised status in the 1930s, and some feelings of a shared destiny with Finland during and after [[World War II]] has changed the islanders' perception of Åland's relation to Finland from "a Swedish province in Finnish possession" to "an autonomous part of Finland".&lt;ref&gt;The recognition of states: law and practice in debate and evolution, Thomas D. Grant, illustrated, Greenwood Publishing Group, 1999, {{ISBN|0-275-96350-0}}, {{ISBN|978-0-275-96350-7}}, pp. 129–30&lt;/ref&gt; The islanders enjoyed safety at sea during World War II, as their merchant fleet sailed for both the Allied countries and Germany. Consequently, Åland shipping was not generally attacked as each side rarely knew which cargo was being carried to whom.

Finland marked the 150th anniversary of demilitarisation of the Åland Islands by issuing a high-value commemorative coin, the €5 [[Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Finland)#2006 coinage|150th Anniversary of Demilitarisation of Åland Islands commemorative coin]], minted in 2006. The obverse depicts a pine tree, very typical in the Åland Islands. The reverse design features a boat's stern and rudder, with a dove perched on the tiller, a symbol of 150 years of peace.

== Politics ==
{{main|Politics of Åland}}
[[File:Ålands lagting.jpg|thumb|The [[Parliament of Åland]].]]
[[File:Alands.jpg|thumb|The Åland Islands during the [[Crimean War]]. It was here that the [[Battle of Bomarsund]] was fought.]]

The Åland Islands are governed according to the Act on the Autonomy of Åland and international treaties. These laws guarantee the islands' autonomy from Finland, which has ultimate sovereignty over them, as well as a demilitarised status. The [[Government of Åland]], or {{lang|sv|Landskapsregering}}, answers to the [[Parliament of Åland]], or {{lang|sv|Lagting}}, in accordance with the principles of [[parliamentary system|parliamentarism]].&lt;ref name="FINLEX"/&gt;

Åland has its own flag and has issued its own postage stamps since 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alandstamps.com/en/products/stamps/product-catalogue-1984-2014 |title=Product catalogue |website=Aland Stamps |access-date=10 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It runs its own police force, and is an associate member of the [[Nordic Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurotrib.com/story/2007/11/7/53338/0615 |title=The 2007 Session of the Nordic Council |date=2007 |website=European Tribune |publisher= |access-date=10 February 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The islands are demilitarised, and the population is exempt from [[conscription]]. Although Åland's autonomy preceded the creation of the [[regions of Finland]], the autonomous government of Åland also has responsibility for the functions undertaken by Finland's regional councils. [[Åland Post]] provides postal services to the islands, and is a member of the [[Small European Postal Administration Cooperation]]. The islands are considered a separate "nation" for [[amateur radio]] purposes and have their own [[call sign]] [[ITU prefix|prefix]] granted by Finland, &lt;code&gt;OH0&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;OF0&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;OG0&lt;/code&gt; (last character is zero).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rsgb.org/main/operating/licensing-novs-visitors/international-prefixes/ |title=International Prefixes |publisher=Radio Society of Great Britain |access-date= 10 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though Åland is economically dependent on Finland, independence movement gains wide popularity among people. {{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

The Åland Islands are guaranteed representation in the [[Parliament of Finland|Finnish parliament]], to which they elect one representative. Åland also has a different system of political parties from the mainland (see [[List of political parties in Finland]]).

[[Homeschooling]], which was effectively banned in Sweden in 2011, is allowed by the Finnish government. Due to the islands' proximity to Sweden and because the islands are Swedish speaking, a number of Swedish homeschooling families have moved from the Swedish mainland to Åland, including Jonas Himmelstrand, the chairman of the Swedish association for homeschooling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Allt fler hemundervisare flyttar till Åland |url=http://www.alandstidningen.ax/nyheter/allt-fler-hemundervisare |website=Ålandstidningen |accessdate=12 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Administration ==
[[File:Aland Islands License Plate.jpg|thumb|An Åland license plate.]]

The State Department of Åland represents the Finnish central government and performs many administrative duties. It has a somewhat different function from the other Regional Administrative Agencies, owing to its [[Wiktionary:autonomy|autonomy]]. Before 2010, the state administration was handled by the [[Åland State Provincial Office]].

Åland has its own postal administration but still uses the Finnish five-digit [[List of postal codes in Finland|postal code]] system, using the number range 22000–22999, with the prefix AX. The lowest numbered postal code is for the capital Mariehamn, AX 22100, and the highest AX 22950 for Jurmo.

== Geography ==
{{main|Geography of Åland}}
[[File:Topographic map of Åland.svg|thumb|Geographical features and municipalities of the Åland Islands.]]
[[File:SoedraLinjen 15.jpg|thumb|left|Sheep grazing on a small island.]]

The Åland Islands occupy a position of strategic importance, as they command one of the entrances to the port of [[Stockholm]], as well as the approaches to the [[Gulf of Bothnia]], in addition to being situated near the [[Gulf of Finland]].

The Åland archipelago includes nearly three hundred habitable islands, of which about eighty are inhabited; the remainder are merely some 6,200 [[skerry|skerries]] and desolate rocks.&lt;ref name="readersnatural" /&gt; The archipelago is connected to [[Åboland]] archipelago in the east ({{lang-fi|Turunmaan saaristo}}, {{lang-sv|Åbolands skärgård}})—the archipelago adjacent to the southwest coast of Finland. Together they form the [[Archipelago Sea]]. To the West from Åland is the [[Sea of Åland]] and to the North is the [[Bothnian Sea]].

The surface of the islands is generally rocky and the soil thin due to glacial stripping at the end of the most recent ice age.&lt;ref name="readersnatural" /&gt; The islands also contain many meadows that are home to many different kinds of insects, such as the [[Glanville fritillary]] butterfly. There are several harbours.

The islands' landmass occupies a total area of {{convert|1527|km2|mi2|0}}.&lt;ref name="Statfin"&gt;{{cite web|title=Statistical Yearbook of Finland 2016|page=505|accessdate=2017-02-07|url=http://www.stat.fi/tup/julkaisut/tiedostot/julkaisuluettelo/yyti_stv_201600_2016_16179_net.pdf|format=PDF|website=Stat.fi|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211080945/http://www.stat.fi/tup/julkaisut/tiedostot/julkaisuluettelo/yyti_stv_201600_2016_16179_net.pdf|archivedate=11 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ninety percent of the population live on [[Fasta Åland]], which is also the site of the capital town of [[Mariehamn]]. Fasta Åland is the largest island in the archipelago. Its area is difficult to estimate due to its irregular shape and coastline, but estimates range from 740 square kilometres&lt;ref name="readersnatural" /&gt; to 879 square kilometres&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EsWT8Ukcq48C&amp;pg=PA251&amp;lpg=PA251&amp;dq=size+of+fasta+aland&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=FAuxJjaCsZ&amp;sig=hJgG0MlOq_0LYhMo7wcJJ1ml3ys&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjQlLav9P7RAhXDKWMKHZJPBSs4ChDoAQgZMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=aland&amp;f=false|title=Biodiversity and Climate Change: Reports and Guidance Developed Under the Bern Convention|last=Europe|first=Council of|date=2012-01-01|publisher=Council of Europe|year=|isbn=9789287170590|location=|pages=251|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to over 1,010 square kilometres, depending on what is included or excluded.

During the Åland Islands dispute, the parties sought support from different maps of the islands. On the Swedish map, the most densely populated main island dominated, and many [[skerry|skerries]] were left out. On the Finnish map, many smaller islands or skerries were, for technical reasons, given a slightly exaggerated size. The Swedish map made the islands appear to be closer to the mainland of Sweden than to Finland; the Finnish map stressed the continuity of the archipelago between the main island and [[mainland Finland]], while a greater gap appeared between the islands and the archipelago on the Swedish side. One consequence is the often repeated number of "over 6,000" skerries that was given authority by the outcome of the arbitration.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

== Climate ==
Åland has a [[humid continental climate]] that is influenced by its maritime position, especially in summer. While summers are cooler than on both the Swedish and Finnish mainland, winters see little difference to the adjacent parts of Sweden and are only narrowly milder than in mainland Finland.

== Economy ==
[[File:SoedraLinjen 05.jpg|thumb|left|Ferry port in {{ill|Överö|sv}}, [[Föglö]].]]
Åland's economy is heavily dominated by shipping, trade and [[Tourism in Åland|tourism]]. Shipping represents about 40% of the economy, with several international carriers owned and operated off Åland. Most companies aside from shipping are small, with fewer than ten employees. Farming and fishing are important in combination with the food industry. A few high-profile technology companies contribute to a prosperous economy. Wind power is rapidly developing, aiming at reversing the direction in the cables to the mainland in coming years. In December 2011, wind power accounted for 31.5% of Åland's total electricity usage.{{Citation needed|date= January 2017}}

The main ports are [[Mariehamn]] (south), [[Berghamn (Åland)|Berghamn]] (west) and [[Långnäs]] on the eastern shore of the Main Island.

Mariehamn served as the base for the last large oceanic commercial sailing-ships in the world. Their final tasks involved bringing Australian wheat to Great Britain, a trade which Åland shipowner [[Gustaf Erikson]] kept going until 1947. The ships latterly made only one round-trip from South Australia to Britain per year, (the [[grain race]]), after each marathon voyage going back to Mariehamn to lay up for a few months. The ship [[Pommern (ship)| ''Pommern'']], now a museum in Mariehamn, was one of these last vessels.

The abolition of tax-free sales on ferry boats travelling between destinations within the [[European Union]] made Finland demand an exception for the Åland Islands on the [[European Union value added tax#EU VAT area|European Union value-added tax rules]]. The exception allows for maintained tax-free sales on the ferries between Sweden and Finland (provided they stop at Mariehamn or Långnäs) and at [[Mariehamn Airport |the airport]], but has also made Åland a different tax-zone, meaning that tariffs must be levied on goods brought to the islands.

Unemployment was 3.9% in January 2014&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.asub.ax/files/arblos_01_2014.pdf |title= Archived copy |accessdate= 2014-08-12 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140812104216/http://www.asub.ax/files/arblos_01_2014.pdf |archivedate= 12 August 2014 |df= dmy-all }} &lt;/ref&gt;

The Finnish State also collects taxes, duties and fees in Åland. In return, the Finnish Government places a sum of money at the disposal of the Åland Parliament. The sum is 0.5% of total Government income, excluding Government loans. If the sum paid to the Finnish state exceeds 0.5%, then any amount above goes back to the Parliament of Åland as "diligence money".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.lagtinget.ax/text.con?iPage=32&amp;m=167|title= Lagtingets uppgifter|date= 22 October 2015|website= Lagtinget.ax|accessdate= 26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 the amount of taxes paid by Åland Islanders comprised 0.7% of the total taxes paid in Finland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ambetsverket.ax/files/d_10_11_04_1_201211_skattegorelsebeslut_2010.pdf|title = Wayback Machine|date= 13 March 2013|website= Web.archive.org|accessdate= 26 October 2017|deadurl= bot: unknown|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130313205638/http://www.ambetsverket.ax/files/d_10_11_04_1_201211_skattegorelsebeslut_2010.pdf|archivedate= 13 March 2013|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Eurostat]], {{as of | 2006 | lc = on}} Åland was the 20th-wealthiest of the EU's 268 regions, and the wealthiest in Finland, with a GDP per inhabitant 47% above the EU mean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_OFFPUB/KS-CD-07-001-13/EN/KS-CD-07-001-13-EN.PDF|title= Wayback Machine|date= 20 August 2012|website= Web.archive.org|accessdate= 26 October 2017|deadurl= bot: unknown|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120820071236/http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_OFFPUB/KS-CD-07-001-13/EN/KS-CD-07-001-13-EN.PDF|archivedate= 20 August 2012|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Ahvenanmaa on EU:n 20. vaurain alue |url= http://www.hs.fi/talous/artikkeli/Ahvenanmaa+on+EUn+20+vaurain+alue/1135243664753 |work= [[Helsingin Sanomat]]|date= 19 February 2009|accessdate= 19 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ethnicity and language ===
{{see also|Languages of Åland}}
Most inhabitants speak [[Swedish language|Swedish]] (the sole [[official language]]) as their [[first language]]: 90.2% in 2009, while 5.0% spoke [[Finnish language|Finnish]]. The language of instruction in publicly financed schools is Swedish (In the rest of Finland, bilingual municipalities provide schooling both in Finnish and in Swedish). (See [[Åland Swedish]] for information about the dialect.)

The issue of the ethnicity of the Ålanders, and the correct linguistic classification of their language, remains somewhat sensitive and controversial. They may be considered either ethnic [[Swedes]] or [[Swedish-speaking population of Finland|Swedish-speaking Finns]], but their language is closer to the [[Uppländska dialect]] of Sweden than to [[Finland Swedish]]. See [[Languages of Sweden]].

[[Finnish nationality law#Ålandic provincial right of domicile|Regional citizenship or the right of domicile]] ({{lang|sv|hembygdsrätt}}) is a prerequisite for voting, standing as a candidate for the Legislative Assembly, or owning and holding real estate situated in unplanned areas of Åland.&lt;ref name="FINLEX"/&gt;

=== Religion ===
[[File:Jomala church 2 retouched.jpg|thumb|right|The [[St. Olaf's Church, Jomala]], is the oldest in Finland.]]
The majority of the population, 74.5%, belongs to the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://pxnet2.stat.fi/PXWeb/pxweb/en/StatFin/StatFin__vrm__vaerak/statfin_vaerak_pxt_007.px/ Key figures on population by region in 1990 to 2017] Statistics Finland&lt;/ref&gt; The Åland islands contain Finland's oldest Christian churches, including [[St. Olaf's Church, Jomala]], which dating from the late 13th century is likely to be the oldest in Finland. The Åland Islands' largest church is the [[Church of St. George, Sund|Church of St. George]] in  [[Sund, Åland|Sund]], dating from shortly after.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.muuka.com/finnishpumpkin/churches/aland/church_aland.html|title=Churches in Åland|website=Muuka.com|accessdate=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
