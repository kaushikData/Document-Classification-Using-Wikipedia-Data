The '''A508''' is a short A-class road for north/south journeys in south central [[England]], forming the route from [[Market Harborough]] in [[Leicestershire]], via [[Northampton]], to [[Old Stratford]], just outside [[Milton Keynes]]. 

The road begins in the centre of Market Harborough and crosses into [[Northamptonshire]] just outside the town.  Crossing the [[A14 road (Great Britain)|A14]] at [[Kelmarsh]], it continues on through the centre of Northampton, merging with the [[A5199 road|A5199]] as it enters the town. Through Northampton the road repeatedly switches between being a dual carriageway and a single carriageway.

From there, it merges briefly with the [[A45 road (Great Britain)|A45]] until it crosses the [[M1 motorway|M1]] at junction 15.  Resuming its identity, it continues through [[Roade]], [[Grafton Regis]] and rural south Northamptonshire, reaching the [[A5 road (Great Britain)|A5]] and the [[A422 road|A422]] at [[Old Stratford]], a Northamptonshire village which adjoins [[Milton Keynes]].

The '''Bock''' ({{lang-lb|Bockfiels}}) is a [[promontory]] in the north-eastern corner of [[Luxembourg City]]'s old historical district. Offering a natural fortification, its rocky cliffs tower above the [[Alzette|River Alzette]] which surrounds it on three sides. It was here that [[Siegfried of Luxembourg|Count Siegfried]] built his Castle of ''Lucilinburhuc'' in 963, providing a basis for the development of the town which became [[Luxembourg City|Luxembourg]]. Over the centuries, the Bock and the surrounding defences were reinforced, attacked and rebuilt time and time again as the armies of the [[Burgundians]], [[House of Habsburg|Habsburgs]], Spaniards, [[Prussia]]ns and French vied for victory over one of Europe's most strategic strongholds, the [[Fortress of Luxembourg]]. Warring did not stop until the [[Treaty of London (1867)|Treaty of London]] was signed in 1867, calling for the demolition of the fortifications. Ruins of the old castle and the vast underground system of passages and galleries known as the [[casemate]]s continue to be a major tourist attraction.

==History==
{{Main article|History of Luxembourg}}
[[File:Siegfried I of Luxembourg.jpg|thumb|right|Count Siegfried of Luxembourg]]
[[File:Luxembourg Bock cliff.JPG|thumb|left|200px|The Bock cliff with loop-holes for the cannons]]    
It was in 963 that [[Siegfried of Luxembourg|Count Siegfried]], in search of a site from which he could defend his properties, obtained the Bock and its surroundings from [[St. Maximin's Abbey, Trier|St Maximin's Abbey]] in [[Trier]] in exchange for the land he owned at [[Feulen]] in the [[Ardennes]] to the north. The [[Roman Empire|Romans]], then the [[Franks]], had probably already inhabited the Bock although there is only scant archeological evidence of their presence.&lt;ref name="Kreins"&gt;Jean-Marie Kreins, "Histoire du Luxembourg", ''Presses universitaires de France'', 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onsstad.lu/uploads/media/ons_stad_76-2004_20-26.pdf Isabelle Yegles-Becker, "La naissance d'une ville"], ''Onsstad.lu'' {{Fr icon}} Retrieved 25 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; There are however traces of a 4th-century Roman watchtower close to the point in the Fish Market where two major Roman roads used to cross, one from [[Reims]] to [[Trier]] and the other from [[Metz]] to [[Liège]].&lt;ref name="Kartheiser"&gt;Josiane Kartheiser, "Luxembourg: Die Stadt - La Ville - The City", Editions Guy Binsfeld. {{ISBN|3-88957-068-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:De Bock 1867.jpg|thumb|right|Photograph of the four Bock gates (c. 1867)]]
The first historical mention of the Bock is indeed in connection with a watchtower or fortification on the Roman road from [[Reims]] to [[Trier]]  which, in 723, was ceded by [[Charles Martel]], Duke of the Franks, to the Abbey of St Maximin in Trier. Two centuries later, Count Siegfried, who had properties "in [[Feulen]], [[Hosingen]] and [[Mondercange|Monnerich]] in the ''[[Woëvre|Pagus Wabrensis]]'', in [[Saarburg|Sarreburg]], [[Bernkastel-Wittlich|Berncastel]] and [[Roussy-le-Village|Roussy]] in the ''[[Moselle|Pagus Mosellanus]]''", was looking for a location for a castle able to withstand any onslaught which would serve as a central point for his holdings. After failing to obtain a site near the [[Stavelot|Abbey of Stavelot]], now in the Belgian province of [[Liège (province)|Liège]], he approached the Abbot of St Maximin's for the purchase of the property high up on the Bock cliff above the Alzette River, described as a "castle by name Lucilinburhuc" (''castellum quod dicitur Lucilinburhuc''). It therefore seems as if there was already a castle on the site before Siegfried became interested in it and that it was not Siegfried who called it Lucilinburhuc. After the consent of [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto I]] had been obtained, the deed was signed by Viker, Abbot of St Maximin's, on 7 April 963. Siegfried acquired the site in exchange for some of his properties at Feulen.&lt;ref&gt;John Allyne Gade, "Luxembourg in the Middle Ages", Luxembourg: E. J. Brill, 1951, 251 pp. Online access [https://books.google.com/books?id=f78UAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA50&amp;dq=luxembourg+lucilinburhuc&amp;hl=da&amp;ei=rbagTKy2KtKtOOGPtZsM&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=bock&amp;f=false here]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Luxembourg plan Matteus Seuter.jpg|thumb|right|Map of Luxembourg by Matteus Seuter (c. 1730)]]
Over the centuries, Siegfried's fortified castle on the Bock was considerably enlarged and protected with additional walls and defences. In 987, the castle chapel was built at the nearby [[Fishmarket|Fish Market]]. Today's [[Saint Michael's Church, Luxembourg|St Michael's Church]] stands on the same site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ont.lu/cult-fr-18-225.html "Patrimoine religieux"], ''ONT Luxembourg''. {{Fr icon}}. Retrieved 27 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  Under [[Conrad I, Count of Luxembourg|Conrad I]], the castle became the residence of the [[Counts of Luxembourg]]. It was damaged, destroyed, captured and rebuilt on several occasions as the [[Burgundians]] (1473), the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburgs]] (1477), and the Spaniards (1555) attacked and took the fortress.&lt;ref name="Kartheiser"/&gt;

As time passed, the fortifications needed to be adapted to new methods of war based on increasingly strong firepower. During the 1640s under the Spaniards, the Swiss engineer Isaac von Treybach significantly reworked the defences. The Bock was also strengthened with three forts, the Large Bock, Middle Bock and Small Bock (from west to east), separated from each other by cuts in the rock and linked by bridges. As a result, little remained of the medieval castle.&lt;ref name="fortified-places"&gt;[http://www.fortified-places.com/luxembourg/ "Luxembourg"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150222023008/http://www.fortified-places.com/luxembourg/ |date=2015-02-22 }}, ''Fortified Places''. Retrieved 28 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

A little later in 1684, on behalf of [[Louis XIV]], [[Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban|Vauban]] succeeded in capturing the city of Luxembourg during a month-long siege under which the Bock fortifications were completely flattened.&lt;ref name="fortified-places"/&gt; Thereafter Vauban, perhaps the most competent fortification engineer of his day, undertook major additions to the defences, realizing that underground passages and chambers were just as important as the surface installations. The Large Bock, connected to the old town by the Pont du Château, was further reinforced. Enclosed by a wall 12&amp;nbsp;m (39&amp;nbsp;ft) high, it was the major component of the new fortress.&lt;ref name="ssmn"&gt;[http://www.ssmn.public.lu/itineraires_culturels/itineraire_culturel_forteresse/wenzel/bock/index.html "Le Bock",] ''Service des sites et monuments nationaux''. {{Fr icon}} Retrieved 25 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Huelen Zant tower, Luxembourg City.JPG|thumb|right|The fake "Hollow Tooth" ruin]]
In addition to these structures, the Bock also included a system of [[casemate]]s which originated in the cellars of the medieval castle. In 1744, during the Austrian period, these underground passages were considerably enlarged by [[Wilhelm Reinhard von Neipperg|General Neipperg]]. The main passage. which still remains, is 110 m long and up to 7 m wide. Branches leading off on either side were equipped with no less than 25 cannon slots, 12 to the north and 13 to the south, offering considerable firepower. In the event of war, the Bock casemates, covering an area of 1,100 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, could be used as barracks for several hundred soldiers. Water was supplied from a well 47 m deep.&lt;ref name="ssmn"/&gt;

Thanks to its defences, in 1794 during the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], the city held out against a French [[Siege of Luxembourg (1794–95)|siege]] for seven months. When the garrison finally surrendered, the walls were still unbreached. This led the French politician and engineer [[Lazare Carnot]] to call the Luxembourg fortress "the best in the world, apart from [[Gibraltar]]".&lt;ref name="Kreins"/&gt; As a result, it has often been called the Gibraltar of the North.

The fortifications were finally demolished under the terms of the [[Treaty of London (1867)|Treaty of London]] in 1867. The demolition took 16 years and cost the enormous sum of 1.5 million gold francs.

==Pont du château==
[[File:Luxembourg_BW_2016-09-15_12-25-26.jpg|thumb|right|The Pont du château]]
The two-storey bridge connecting the Bock to the old town was an important component of the fortifications. Technically, it is a rather curious structure. Built in 1735 by the Austrians, it provides no less than four ways of crossing between the cliffs: the road over the top, a passage by way of the four upper arches, a spiral staircase up through the main arch and a tunnel under the road at the bottom.&lt;ref name="ssmn"/&gt;

==Famous visitors==

Over the years, the Bock casemates have received several famous visitors.&lt;ref name="lcto casemates"&gt;[http://www.lcto.lu/public/digimails/The_Casemates_UNESCO_world_heritage_2010/index.html "The casemates UNESCO world heritage"], ''Luxembourg: the city''. Retrieved 27 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; These include:
*[[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Joseph II of Austria]] (1781);
*[[Napoleon Bonaparte]] (1804);
*[[Prince Henry of the Netherlands (1820–1879)|Prince Henry of the Netherlands]] (1868);
*[[Charlotte, Grand Duchess of Luxembourg|Grand Duchess Charlotte of Luxembourg]] (1936);
*[[Henri, Grand Duke of Luxembourg|Grand Duke Henri of Luxembourg]] and his wife [[Maria Teresa, Grand Duchess of Luxembourg|Grand Duchess Maria Teresa]] (2000).

==The legend of Melusina==
There have reportedly been people that have seen [[Melusine]] in the waters nearby.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.luxembourg.co.uk/legends.html "Luxembourg legends"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125005806/http://www.luxembourg.co.uk/legends.html |date=November 25, 2010 }}, ''Luxembourg Tourist Office in London''.

The '''Central African mangroves''' [[ecoregion]] consists of the largest area of [[mangrove]] swamp in [[Africa]], located on the coasts of West Africa, mainly in [[Nigeria]].

==Location and description==
These mangroves are found in fertile rivermouths and lagoons and contain trees up to 45m tall. Most are in [[Niger Delta mangroves|Nigeria]], with important areas [[Cameroon]] and [[Equatorial Guinea]]/[[Gabon]] and patches in [[Ghana]], [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], and northern [[Angola]].  The largest area in the region is on the delta of the [[Niger River]] on the [[Gulf of Guinea]], while others include the eastern side of the [[Cross River (Nigeria)|Cross River]] delta in Nigeria and Cameroon, the [[Wouri estuary]] in Cameroon, and the [[Muni River]] estuary on the border of Equatorial Guinea and Gabon. As well as being home to much wildlife the mangroves hold rivers in place, filter the waters and create build-ups of nutrient rich soil on the banks. Mangroves thrive in humid tropical climates where the sea is warm, and where high tides flood into the rivers. Therefore, there is less on the coast of the Congo, where the [[Benguela Current]] brings cool seas, but there are patches here and further south in Angola.

==Flora==
There are five main species of mangrove trees in the ecoregion: red mangrove (''[[Rhizophora mangle]]''), ''[[Rhizophora racemosa]]'', and ''[[Rhizophora harrisonii]]'', black mangrove (''[[Avicennia germinans]]'') and white mangrove (''[[Laguncularia racemosa]]''), while the palm ''[[Nypa fruticans]]'' has been introduced from Asia.

==Fauna==
The rich communities of oysters, crabs, invertebrates and the great variety of fish sheltering and spawning in the mangroves sustain animal life including monkeys, [[African manatee]] (''Trichechus senegalensis''), and turtles like the [[African softshell turtle]] (''Trionyx triunguis''). Birds include breeding waterbirds such as [[striated heron]] and [[reed cormorant]] and large flocks of others during migration.

==Services related to mangrove==
Example of services related mangrove services include regulatory, provisional, cultural and supportive[2].

==Threats and preservation==
Nigeria is the most densely populated country in Africa, which puts a strain on the largest remaining areas of these fertile coastal habitats. Much has been cleared for urban and industrial development, such as the oil refineries of the Niger Delta which have also caused the rivers and swamps to become polluted.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/the-niger-delta-the-curse-of-the-black-gold-882384.html&lt;/ref&gt; Urban areas in originally mangrove areas include [[Lagos]] in Nigeria and Douala in Cameroon. Other strains on the ecoregion include clearance for salt panning and agriculture.  However mangrove is a resilient habitat and small clumps of mangrove remain in isolation all along the coast of west and central Africa. Protected areas include [[Douala Edéa Wildlife Reserve]] in Cameroon and [[Songor Lagoon]] in Ghana, while the [[Keta]] Lagoon, also in Ghana, is a [[Ramsar site]].

The '''Clayton J. Lloyd International Airport''' {{airport codes|AXA|TQPF}} (formerly known as the '''Anguilla Wallblake Airport''') is a small [[international airport]] located on the island of [[Anguilla]], a [[British Overseas Territory]] in the [[Caribbean]].  It is located very close to [[The Valley, Anguilla|The Valley]], the island's capital. Wallblake Airport is also a featured airport in one of the [[Microsoft Flight Simulator X#Demo versions|Flight Simulator X game demos]]. It has a small terminal with no jetways and is the only airport in Anguilla.

The airport became known as the "Clayton J. Lloyd International Airport" on 4 July 2010.  Its namesake was the first Anguillan aviator and founded the first Anguillan air service, Air Anguilla, which was later renamed [[Valley Air Service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/wallblake-airport-renamed-clayton-j-lloyd-international-airport-98956504.html|title=Wallblake Airport Renamed Clayton J.

'''Diver navigation''', termed "underwater navigation" by [[Scuba diving|scuba divers]],&lt;ref name = UKDivers/&gt; is a set of techniques—including observing natural features, the use of a compass, and surface observations—that divers use to  [[Navigation|navigate]] [[underwater]]. [[Free-diving|Free-divers]] do not spend enough time underwater for navigation to be important, and [[Surface supplied diving|surface supplied divers]] are limited in the distance they can travel by the length of their [[Surface-supplied diving#Diver's umbilical|umbilicals]] and are usually directed from the surface control point. On those occasions when they need to navigate they can use the same methods used by scuba divers.

Although it is considered a basic skill, it is normally only taught to a limited degree as part of basic Open Water certification.  Most North American [[List of diver certification organizations|diver training agencies]] only teach significant elements of underwater navigation as part of the [[Advanced Open Water Diver]] certification program.

Underwater navigation is usually a core component of most, if not all, advanced recreational diver training.  In the [[Professional Association of Diving Instructors|PADI]] Advanced Open Water Diver course, it is one of the two mandatory skills (together with [[Deep diving]]) which must be taken alongside three elective skills.&lt;ref name="PADI" /&gt;

Training agencies promote underwater navigation as a skill (despite the fact that it is less popular than other [[Recreational diving#Specialties|recreational diving specialties]]){{cn|date=October 2017}} on the basis that it:
* builds diver confidence
* saves energy by minimising excess swimming
* makes dive planning more effective
* keeps [[buddy diving|dive buddies]] together
* reduces air consumption

Underwater compass navigation is a component of the [[scuba diving|scuba-based]] [[underwater sports|underwater sport]], [[underwater orienteering]].&lt;ref name="CMAS-ori" /&gt;

==Navigation techniques==

Underwater navigation in [[recreational diving]] is broadly split into two categories.  ''Natural navigation'' techniques, and ''orienteering'', which is navigation focused upon the use of an underwater [[compass|magnetic compass]].&lt;ref name=Cumming2011 /&gt;

Natural navigation, sometimes known as [[pilotage]], involves orienting by naturally observable phenomena, such as sunlight, water movement, bottom composition (for example, sand ripples run parallel to the direction of the wave front, which tends to run parallel to the shore), bottom contour and noise.  Although natural navigation is taught on courses, developing the skills is generally more a matter of experience.&lt;ref name=UKDivers&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Orienteering, or compass navigation, is a matter of training, practice and familiarity with the use of underwater compasses, combined with various techniques for reckoning distance underwater, including kick cycles (one complete upward and downward sweep of a kick), time, air consumption and occasionally by actual measurement. Kick cycles depend on the diver's finning technique and equipment, but are generally more reliable than time, which is critically dependent on speed, or air consumption, which is critically dependent on depth, work rate, diver fitness, and equipment drag. Techniques for direct measurement also vary, from the use of calibrated distance lines or surveyor's tape measures, to a mechanism like an [[impeller log]], to pacing off the distance along the bottom with the arms.&lt;ref name="CMAS-ISA 3-star" /&gt;

Many skilled underwater navigators use techniques from both of these categories in a seamless combination, using the compass to navigate between landmarks over longer distances and in poor visibility, while making use of the generic oceanographic indicators to help stay on course and as a check that there is no mistake with the bearing, and then recognising landmarks and using them with the remembered topography of a familiar site to confirm position.&lt;ref name="CMAS-ISA 3-star" /&gt;

===Navigation using natural features===

====Landmarks====
{{Main|Piloting (navigation)}}
Recognisable topographical features may be remembered or noted and used identify position and direction. This is particularly useful if the visibility is sufficient to see the next landmark on the route before leaving the last. Landmarks are ordinarily considered permanent or semi-permanent features, such as ridges, boulders, wrecks or clumps of weed, but use can also be made of temporary marks such as anchor cables, [[shot line]]s, [[Diving equipment#Special equipment for underwater work not carried by the diver|jackstay]]s and [[guide line]]s.&lt;ref name="CMAS-ISA 3-star" /&gt;

====Depth and depth variation====
The slope of the bottom is often a reliable indicator of the direction toward the shore, particularly when the bottom is of soft or loose material, and is not broken up greatly by rocky outcrops. This information can be checked for reliability on a sufficiently detailed chart of the area. Contours of depth running roughly parallel to the coastline indicate a slope dipping directly away from the shore, and can be used to maintain a sense of distance and orientation relative to the shore. In some places where the bottom is composed of predominantly rocky outcrops the slope may be in any direction and is not a reliable indicator of direction.&lt;ref name="CMAS-ISA 3-star" /&gt;

====Angle of the sun, changes in light level====
If circumstances of depth and water clarity allow the position of the sun to produce sufficient variation in brightness, this may indicate the direction of the sun, and be used as a cue to orientation. The effect is greater if the sun is relatively low in the sky, the water is clean, the depth fairly shallow and the surface fairly smooth.&lt;ref name="CMAS-ISA 3-star" /&gt;

In some circumstances the diver can look up at the surface, to see in which direction the land lies. These cues will not give any precise information about position, but will allow the diver to keep a mental picture of where he or she is and is going.&lt;ref name="CMAS-ISA 3-star" /&gt;

====Current, wave and surge direction====
[[Ocean current|Current]] direction can be useful as an orientation cue as long as the direction of the current is known. In rivers it tends to be fairly consistent and reliable, though localised eddies may occur. In the sea it may depend on weather conditions and local topography, as well as the state of the [[tide]]. In estuaries and harbours the currents will usually be predominantly tidal, so the state of the tide must be known, as the difference in direction between ebb and flow is usually about 180°.&lt;ref name="CMAS-ISA 3-star" /&gt;

[[Glossary of underwater diving terminology#surge|Wave surge]] direction is essentially the same as wave direction, but may be felt at depths where the wave direction is no longer visible. It is useful if the offshore wave direction relative to the shore is known and does not change appreciably during the dive. In shallow water the wave crests will often be parallel to the shore. The important difference is that waves can be seen to travel in a definite direction, whereas surge is a back and forth motion, allowing a possible 180° error.&lt;ref name="CMAS-ISA 3-star" /&gt;

====Ripple patterns on a sand bottom====
A regular and distinct ripple pattern on a sand, mud or gravel bottom is an indication that it has been affected by wave action. The surge of the wave at depth causes the particles to be moved backwards and forwards in the direction the waves are travelling. This movement produces a ripple pattern on the bottom which is an indication of the wave direction on the surface. The ripple crests will be approximately parallel to the crests of the waves that formed them. It is however possible for the surface waves to change direction, and due to shorter wavelength, not reach the bottom to change the ripple pattern. When this is the case there will be no surge at the bottom. If there is a surge at the bottom, and the ripple crests are perpendicular the direction of the surge, then the wave crests will be parallel to the ripple crests. Ripple crests, like surge, may be interpreted with a 180° error.&lt;ref name="CMAS-ISA 3-star" /&gt;

====Dip and strike of bedrock====
Many rock formations have characteristic angles known as [[Strike and dip|dip and strike]]. Dip is the slope of the strata from the horizontal, and strike is the general direction of the strata in the horizontal plane (very roughly). These characteristics will usually be similar in the rocks above and below the water in a locality, so they can be used to estimate direction. Ridges above and below water are often parallel, and gullies and valleys may well extend under water for considerable distances.&lt;ref name="CMAS-ISA 3-star" /&gt;

====Ecological variations====
Different areas may for a wide variety of reasons have different ecologies. A diver who is familiar with an area can use the diversity variations and patterns to provide orientation cues.

There is often variation of [[ecological zone|ecological zoning]] with depth, but a diver is expected to be aware of the depth all the time anyway. In some places the seaward side of big rocks may have different species from the shoreward face because of the greater exposure to wave action.&lt;ref name="CMAS-ISA 3-star" /&gt;

[[Sea fans]] and [[sponges]] are [[filter feeders]], and may grow into a fan shape at right angles to the usual current or surge direction, to get the maximum volume of water flowing past them.&lt;ref name="CMAS-ISA 3-star" /&gt;

===Compass navigation===

====How a compass works====
The [[magnetic compass]] indicates the local direction of the ambient [[magnetic field]], which is usually that of the Earth. This is usually a reliable and consistent feature and is very useful as a navigational aid as it is not affected by visibility, pressure, or the presence of water.&lt;ref name="CMAS-ISA 3-star" /&gt;

An important concept is that the compass card should not turn, even though it appears to always “swing” to magnetic north. The housing that holds the compass card turns around the card, which remains pointing in the same direction ([[Magnetic North]]) all the time.  There are occasions when the card does turn, but this is when it has been stuck or the compass is turned over, and the card is unable to remain aligned with the magnetic field.&lt;ref name="CMAS-ISA 3-star" /&gt;

====True or geographic north====
[[True north]] is the geometrically accurate direction along the surface of the earth toward the North pole of the planet’s axis of rotation.
The lines of [[longitude]] on maps are in true North/South directions.&lt;ref name="CMAS-ISA 3-star" /&gt;

====Magnetic north and variation====
The Earth has a magnetic field which is not quite in line with the geographic directions. The difference between the magnetic and true directions is known as [[Magnetic variation|Variation]]. It differs from place to place and changes with time. Large scale charts and maps will usually include a [[compass rose]] showing variation.&lt;ref name="CMAS-ISA 3-star" /&gt;

====Compass north and deviation====
The compass will indicate the magnetic field direction at the place where it happens to be at the time. If there are influences other than the [[Magnetosphere|Earth’s magnetic field]], these may change the direction indicated by the compass. These effects are called [[magnetic deviation|deviation]], and can be caused by a whole range of things. Any [[ferromagnetic|magnetic]] object or [[electrical current]] will have an influence, some more than others. The current in a [[dive computer]] is too small to affect the compass, even when quite near, but the hull of a ship or overhead power lines may make a difference even several meters away. It is difficult and often impossible to correct for all possible deviations, but it is worth checking a dive compass for deviation caused by dive equipment. It has been known for regulators to cause deviation, [[steel]] [[Scuba tank|cylinders]] can cause deviation, and powerful lights may be a problem. A [[diver propulsion vehicle]] with an [[electric motor]] is also a potential problem for those who use them, though divers have been known to navogate adequately using compasses mounted on the handgrip of a DPV. A magnetic clip used to secure equipment to the diver's harness has a powerful magnet in both parts, and should not be used to hold the compass, as the part attached to the compass will produce a serious error.&lt;ref name="CMAS-ISA 3-star" /&gt;

Deviation may be checked by comparing the compass bearing as measured with a known magnetic bearing measured by a compass with no deviation. Deviation may vary with different directions and for accurate work it is necessary to make up a table of deviations. This is done for ships, but for diving it is generally not worth the trouble. Bearings of one diver's compass may vary from those of another diver even if they have both been read correctly. The difference should not be large, but it can result in being off course and not finding something. A compass is a magnet, and will affect another compass nearby, so they can not be checked by putting them together.&lt;ref name="CMAS-ISA 3-star" /&gt;

====Dip====
The magnetic field of the earth is tilted from the horizontal. The angle is called [[magnetic dip|dip]] and varies with place, so compasses can be corrected for different zones. This is a factory process. A compass made for the northern parts of the northern hemisphere will tilt badly in the southern hemisphere, in some cases to the extent that it will jam if held horizontal.&lt;ref name="CMAS-ISA 3-star" /&gt;

===Guidelines===
{{main article|Distance line}}
[[File:Cave diver running a reel.jpg|thumb|right|A cave diver running a distance line into the overhead environment to facilitate a safe exit]]
Also known as cave lines, distance lines, penetration lines and jackstays. These are permanent or temporary lines laid by divers to mark a route, particularly in caves, wrecks and other areas where the way out from an overhead environment may not be obvious.&lt;ref name="Exley" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Guideline 2" /&gt; Guidelines are also useful in the event of [[silt out]].&lt;ref name="Guideline 3" /&gt;

Distance lines are wound on to a spool or a [[reel]].&lt;ref name="Guideline 1" /&gt; The length of the distance line used is dependent on the plan for the dive. An open water diver using the distance line only for a [[surface marker buoy]] may only need 50 metres / 165 feet, whereas a cave diver may use multiple reels of lengths from 50&amp;nbsp;ft (15&amp;nbsp;m) to 1000+&amp;nbsp;ft (300&amp;nbsp;m).{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Reels for distance lines may have a locking mechanism, ratchet or adjustable drag to control deployment of the line and a winding handle to help keep slack line under control and rewind line. Lines are used in open water to deploy [[surface marker buoy]]s and [[decompression buoy]]s and link the buoy on the surface to the submerged diver, or may be used to allow easy return navigation to a point such as a [[Diving shot|shotline]] or boat anchor.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The material used for any given distance line will vary based on intended use, [[nylon]] being the material of choice for cave diving.&lt;ref name="Guideline 1"/&gt; A common line used is 2&amp;nbsp;mm (0.08&amp;nbsp;inch) [[polypropylene]] line when it does not matter if the line is buoyant.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The use of guideline for navigation requires careful attention to laying and securing the line, line following, marking, referencing, positioning, teamwork, and communication.&lt;ref name="Guideline 3"/&gt;

====Line markers====
{{main article|Line marker}}
[[Image:Line arrow.jpg|thumb|alt= |A line arrow on a cave's main guideline pointing to the exit]]
[[File:Cave diving line markers secure.svg|thumb|alt= |Illustration showing typical cave line markers and how they are attached to the line for security.
{{bulleted list

In [[cave diving|cave]] (and occasionally wreck) diving, '''line markers''' are used for orientation as a visual and tactile reference on a permanent guideline. Directional markers (commonly arrows), are also known as line arrows or Dorff arrows, and point the way to an exit. Line arrows may mark the location of a "jump" location in a cave when two are placed adjacent to each other. Two adjacent arrows facing away from each other, mark a point in the cave where the diver is equidistant from two exits. Arrow direction can be identified by feel in low visibility. Non-directional markers ("cookies") are purely personal markers that mark specific spots, or the direction of one's chosen exit at line intersections where there are options. Their shape does not provide a tactile indication of direction as this could cause confusion in low visibility. One important reason to be adequately trained before cave diving is that incorrect marking can confuse and fatally endanger not only oneself, but also other divers.&lt;ref name="Keiren 2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Riordan /&gt;

===Direction by surface control personnel===
In some circumstances divers may be directed by their surface control personnel. This requires a method of [[Diver communications|communication]] between the surface team and the diver.
Both [[Diver communications#Voice communications|voice]] communications and [[Diver communications#Rope signals|line signals]] may be used to direct the movement of the diver and to provide other information.
Surface direction may be used in scuba diving when [[Ice diving|diving under ice]] or conducting an [[Underwater searches#Searches directed from the surface|underwater search]], and in [[surface supplied diving]] for both these purposes and at any other time that it is useful or convenient for the dive controller to direct the movement of the diver. Surface direction is most useful when the surface personnel have a better idea of where the diver is relative to where he or she needs to be than the diver has, which can happen when the visibility is poor, or when the diver is following a search pattern controlled by the surface controller.&lt;ref name="CMAS-ISA 3-star" /&gt;

==Surface navigation for diving==
[[File:Cocked hat on chart.jpg|thumb|Cocked hat on chart showing navigational error]]
Surface applications for compass navigation include marking a position and finding the position using compass bearings. At least two position lines are required to fix a position, as only direction can be found using a compass. When two bearings are used a large angle between the bearings will minimize error. The angle should preferably be between 60 and 120 degrees, and near 90 degrees would be ideal. Three bearings are better as they will also give an indication of probable accuracy when plotted on a chart. The "cocked hat" or triangle where the lines intersect, shows the probable location of the position measured, and a small triangle indicates a small probable error. The angle between the three bearings should preferably be in the order of 60 or 120 degrees where available landmarks allow. In all cases landmarks should be as close to the diver as possible and spread over a large arc for best accuracy.&lt;ref name="CMAS-ISA 3-star" /&gt;

==Equipment==

Various pieces of equipment are available to assist divers navigating underwater.
* [[Magnetic compass]]es, set either in a diver's console or wrist mounted.  Various forms exist.
* Scuba sextant, or Nav-finder, to enable a diver to plot an ongoing course during a dive.
* Compass boards
* Hand-held sonar
* Cave and wreck reels and line
* Jump spools
Periodically reports are issued suggesting the development of underwater [[Global positioning system|GPS]] technology, but no system is currently available on market.  It is generally thought that the difficulty of locating satellite by signals from underwater at present is not capable of being overcome by existing technology.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Construction====

The typical diving compass is made from a card with graduation in degrees, mounted on a pivot in a transparent housing filled with fluid which damps the movement and prevents pressure collapse of the housing. It may be wrist mounted, console mounted or carried some other way. It is desirable that the compass can operate accurately at significant tilt angles without sticking.&lt;ref name="CMAS-ISA 3-star" /&gt;

On the card there is a magnet which will interact with the ambient magnetic field so as to align itself and the card with the field provided it is free to rotate. There will be other marks on the housing which are intended to be aligned with the direction of travel of the user, so the offset of the card to the housing will indicate the direction of the magnetic field and the orientation of the user.&lt;ref name="CMAS-ISA 3-star" /&gt;

Important features of a diving compass are that it can easily be read in dim light, the card or needle does not easily jam if the housing is tilted slightly, and that it can be securely attached to the diver's arm or equipment and does not get lost. It is useful for any straps to be adjustable while wearing gloves, and any clips that may attached should be non-magnetic.&lt;ref name="CMAS-ISA 3-star" /&gt;

The strap should be long enough to go round the diver's wrist over the diving suit glove, and if it is slightly elastic it will stay in place when the suit compresses.&lt;ref name="CMAS-ISA 3-star" /&gt;

There may be a movable bezel which can be set to record a course and to help set a reciprocal course.&lt;ref name="CMAS-ISA 3-star" /&gt;

There are also electronic compasses which can provide a digital or analogue display These are based on [[magnetometer#Fluxgate magnetometer|magnetometer]] technology. Several models of [[dive computer]] incorporate a compass function, but this may not be accessible at the same time as the primary decompression information, and may be limited in their precision of display information.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

====Direct and Indirect reading compasses====
There are two ways in which a compass may be marked, which influence the way you would read them. These are known as direct reading compasses and indirect reading compasses. Both provide the same information to the same level of accuracy. Both types may have graduations on the card which can be read through a side window to give the bearing directly.&lt;ref name="CMAS-ISA 3-star" /&gt;

The '''direct reading compass''' has graduations on the housing which read anti-clockwise round the face, with zero on the far side. 
The effect of this configuration is that if the housing is aligned with a direction, the north point of the card or needle will point directly towards the number representing the bearing. No further effort is needed on the part of the operator, you just find the number the arrow points at and read off the bearing. 
The bezel has no graduations, it is just a marker to align the card.&lt;ref name="CMAS-ISA 3-star" /&gt;

The '''indirect reading compass''' has graduations on the bezel. These graduations are clockwise round the face, and the zero mark coincides with the notch. To take a bearing the compass must first be aligned with the direction, then the bezel must be turned so that the notch aligns with the north point of the card or needle, and the bearing can then be read at the far side of the compass.&lt;ref name="CMAS-ISA 3-star" /&gt;

====Electronic compasses====

{{further|flux-gate compass|Dive computer}}
Flux-gate compasses are built into several models of dive computer as an extra function. They may require calibration when powered up, but calibration usually lasts as long as the processor is running. They are usually insensitive to tilt as there are no moving parts to jam. The display varies, and may not be as intuitive as for a mechanical compass needle or card arrangement. They can often be calibrated to account for local deviation and give true direction. The nearby presence of a magnetic compass can cause large error, but they are not greatly affected by other electronic compasses, as can be seen from the images.&lt;ref name="iX3M" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Perdix" /&gt;

Some digital cameras for underwater use also have a built in flux-gate compass (such as the Olympus TG series) which can be used for navigation as well as for recording the direction of a photograph.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

'''Flaten''' is a [[lake]] in southern [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]], located just north of Lake [[Drevviken]].  The name is also used for the surrounding area and the [[nature reserve]] created there in 2007.&lt;ref name="Flaten-naturreservat"&gt;Flaten blir naturreservat&lt;/ref&gt;

Flaten has the best water quality of all lakes around the Swedish capital and is highly popular for bathing and angling.  The surrounding area is dominated by forests, with [[allotment (gardening)|allotment-gardens]] and some industrial activities located north of the lake.  [[Algal bloom]] occasionally occurs in spring.&lt;ref name="Flaten"&gt;Flaten&lt;/ref&gt;

== Catchment area ==
The undulating wooded grounds of the catchment area are considered as of significant natural value and, through the location within a nature reserve and proximity to Stockholm, also of significant recreational value.  A scenic ravine is found by the southern end of the lake while most nearby settlements are located north of it.  The arrea is used for various open-air activities including walking, bathing, camping, canoeing, and fishing.&lt;ref name="vattenprogram-11.1" /&gt;
The area is a fine example of the [[fissure-valley landscape]] prevalent in the entire [[Stockholm County]], featuring elevated flat rocks separated by valleys with oaks and spruces, some of which can be several hundreds years old.  In the catchment area are also three allotment-gardens and the residential area [[Skarpnäck borough|Skarpnäck]].  A bathe is located on the eastern shore.&lt;ref name="vattenprogram-11.3"&gt;Vattenprogram, p 11.3-11.4&lt;/ref&gt;  The catchment area for [[groundwater]] is much larger than that for stormwater.&lt;ref name="vattenprogram-11.6"&gt;Vattenprogram, p 11.6&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Environmental influence ===
In summer, when the lake is stratified, bottom layers suffer of oxygen depletion causing release of [[phosphorus]].  Treatment with [[aluminium chloride]] in 2000, however, greatly reduced the amount of leaking phosphorus.  Most of the [[surface runoff]] reaching Flaten comes from a ditch (''Flatendiket'') stretching a kilometre to empty in the northern end of the lake where two [[sedimentation]] basins reduces the amount of pollutants reaching the lake.  The ditch also receives [[stormwater]] from local settlements rich in nutrients and from the only road in the catchment area which contains metals and [[Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon|PAH]]s.  Occasionally, the ditch therefore transports waste water to the lake which the available [[Caisson (engineering)|caisson]]s mostly fails to treat properly.  However, pipes from the bathe lead to a local sewage disposal plant, and, additionally, the catchment area was reduced by some 20 per cent in 1978 when stormwater from the graveyard [[Skogskyrkogården]] was guided past the lake, which decreased pollution but also increased [[lake retention time]].&lt;ref name="vattenprogram-11.3" /&gt;

== Flora and fauna ==
In summers, [[phytoplankton]] [[algae]] are dominated by [[cyanobacteria]] and some [[carapace]] [[flagellate]]s.  Other species have been abundant, but today only a single nitrogen fixating algae is present in the lake.  During winters and springs, ''[[Planktothrix agardhii]]'' adopt a red colour which occasionally colours the lake in shades of red and brown. Larger [[zooplankton]] include [[water flea]]s (''[[Bosmina]]'') and [[copepod]]s (''[[Daphnia]]''); and smaller species, [[rotifer]]s, seem to have increased during the later part of the 1990s.  An inventory of [[aquatic plant]]s in 1997 resulted in a list of 13 species, most commonly [[Isoetes echinospora|spring quillwort]], [[awlwort]], [[shoreweed]], and [[needle spike-rush]].  The shores of Flaten are covered with [[Myrica gale|bog-myrtle]]. [[Trailing plant]]s have occasionally been abundant near the bathe.&lt;ref name="vattenprogram-11.6" /&gt;

A documentation of lake bed fauna in 1997 registered 68 species, of which fourteen were freshwater [[Gastropoda|gastropods]] commonly found around Stockholm and five were [[dragonfly|dragonflies]].  Notable catches included [[Valvata piscinalis|European stream valvata]] (''Valvata piscinalis'') and [[duck mussel]].  Common fishes are [[perch]], [[Rutilus|roach]], and [[Abramis bjoerkna|silver bream]], with bigger variations in population for [[carp bream]], [[northern pike]], [[tench]], [[common bleak|bleak]], [[ruffle]], and [[zander]] (notwithstanding attempts to introduce the latter).  [[Crayfish]] have been successfully introduced. Thirteen breeding bird pairs were documented in 1994 of which the [[black-throated diver]] is considered the most important, even though the species is sensitive to interference so breeding might be challenging. Four of five [[amphibian]]s with a natural habitat in the Stockholm area are found by the lake, as were four species of [[bat]]s.&lt;ref name="vattenprogram-11.6" /&gt;

The [[Paraná Basin]] is a large [[sedimentary basin]] situated in the central-eastern part of [[South America]]. About 75% of its areal distribution occurs in [[Brazil]], from [[Mato Grosso]] to [[Rio Grande do Sul]] states. The remainder area is distributed in eastern Paraguay, northeastern [[Argentina]] and northern [[Uruguay]]. The shape of the depression is elliptical and covers an area of about {{convert|1500000|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}, of which 110,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; are in Paraguay.&lt;ref name=Fuldfa/&gt; The basin developed during the [[Paleozoic]] and the [[Mesozoic]] with a [[sedimentary]] record comprising [[rock (geology)|rock]]s from the [[Ordovician]] right up to the [[Cretaceous]], thus spanning the time interval between 460 and 66 million years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Renne |first=Paul R. |last2=Deino |first2=Alan L. |last3=Hilgen |first3=Frederik J. |last4=Kuiper |first4=Klaudia F. |last5=Mark |first5=Darren F. |last6=Mitchell |first6=William S. |last7=Morgan |first7=Leah E. |last8=Mundil |first8=Roland |last9=Smit |first9=Jan |title=Time Scales of Critical Events Around the Cretaceous-Paleogene Boundary |journal=Science |date=7 February 2013 |volume=339 |issue=6120 |pages=684–687 |doi=10.1126/science.1230492 |pmid=23393261 |url=http://www.cugb.edu.cn/uploadCms/file/20600/20131028144132060.pdf |bibcode=2013Sci...339..684R}}&lt;/ref&gt; The maximum thickness of the infill reaches 7,000&amp;nbsp;m in its central area and is composed of [[sedimentary]] and [[igneous]] rocks.&lt;ref name="Carta Bacia do Paraná"&gt;Milani, E.

The Paraná Basin is a typical [[craton|intra-cratonic]] flexural basin, although during the Paleozoic it was a [[Bay|gulf]] that opened to the southwest. The basin genesis is related to the [[convergent boundary|convergence]] between the former [[Gondwana]] [[supercontinent]] and the [[oceanic crust]] of the former [[Panthalassa]] ocean. The basin formed, at least during the Paleozoic [[orogenesis]] of the Gondwanides, a [[foreland basin]].&lt;ref name="Carta Bacia do Paraná"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Paraná Basin"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Melo, J. H.

The [[Paraná River]], that forms Paraguay's eastern boundary, flows along the central axis of the Paraná Basin and drains the modern basin.

===Chaco Basin===
{{main|Chaco Basin}}
The [[Gran Chaco|Chaco]] region that makes up the northwestern half (~60%) of Paraguay is a modern [[foreland basin]]&lt;ref name=Cleb&gt;Clebsch Kuhn, Carlos Alfredo. 1991.

==Volcanic Provinces==
{{see also|Asunción Rift}}
===Alto Paraguay volcanics===
In [[Alto Paraguay Department]] 240 Ma old alkaline volcanic rocks underlies younger sediments. In the 1970s these rocks were studied for their potential to host valuable [[phosphate]] and [[uranium]] minerals.&lt;ref name=alk&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=0vxnCKlQOXMC&amp;pg=PA33&amp;lpg=PA33&amp;dq=paraguay+anticline&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=vdBXz8O1lQ&amp;sig=iSyj6NCdXfzqlSRKxU-MqD9trlU&amp;hl=sv#v=onepage&amp;q=paraguay%20anticline&amp;f=false  Alkaline Magmatism in Paraguay: A Review]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paraná Igneous Province===
In a strip along [[Paraná River]] [[tholeiitic]] basalts belonging to the [[Paraná Traps]] makes up most of the bedrock and overlies earlier sediments of the [[Paraná Basin]]. These tholeiites were erupted in the [[Cretaceous|Early Cretaceous]] in association with the initial opening of the [[South Atlantic]]. The Cretaceous volcanism did also created minor outcrops of potassic alkaline volcanics in a [[graben]] structure developed between [[Asunción]] and [[Villarrica, Paraguay|Villarrica]] and in [[Amambay Department]]. Cretaceous volcanism did also left small units of sodic alkaline rocks in [[Misiones Department]] in southern Paraguay.

'''The Hejaz''' ({{IPAc-en|h|iː|ˈ|dʒ|æ|z}}; {{lang-ar|ٱلْـحِـجَـاز|al-Ḥijāz|lit=the Barrier}}), is a region in the west of present-day [[Saudi Arabia]]. The region is so called as it separates the land of the [[Najd]] in the east from the land of [[Tihamah]] in the west. It is also known as the "Western Province."&lt;ref name=Mackey&gt;Mackey, p. 101. “The Western Province, or the Hijaz[...]&lt;/ref&gt; It is bordered on the west by the [[Red Sea]], on the north by [[Jordan]], on the east by the Najd, and on the south by [['Asir Region]].&lt;ref name="MWGD2001"&gt;{{cite book |title=Merriam-Webster's Geographical Dictionary |last= |first= |coauthors= |year=2001 |isbn=0 87779 546 0 |page=479 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Co_VIPIJerIC&amp;pg=PA479 |accessdate=17 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its largest city is [[Jeddah]], but it is probably better known for the [[Islam]]ic [[Holy city|holy cities]] of [[Mecca]]&lt;ref name="Cite quran|48|22|e=29|s=ns"&gt;{{cite quran|48|22|e=29|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Medina]].&lt;ref name="Cite quran|9|25|e=129|s=ns"&gt;{{cite quran|9|25|e=129|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cite quran|33|09|e=73|s=ns"&gt;{{cite quran|33|09|e=73|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cite quran|63|1|e=11|s=ns"&gt;{{cite quran|63|1|e=11|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the site of the two [[holiest sites in Islam]], the Hejaz has significance in the [[Arab]] and Islamic historical and political landscape.

=== Prehistoric or ancient times ===
[[File:Al Ula (6708283401).jpg|thumb|The city of [[Al-`Ula]] in 2012. The city's archaeological sector is in the foreground.]]

One or possibly two [[megalith]]ic [[dolmen]] have been found in the Hijaz.&lt;ref name="Scheltema2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gajus Scheltema|title=Megalithic Jordan: an introduction and field guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aqUbAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=5 October 2012|year=2008|publisher=ACOR|isbn=978-9957-8543-3-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hejaz includes both the ''[[Mahd adh Dhahab|Mahd adh-Dhahab]]'' ("Cradle of the Gold") ({{coord|23|30|13|N|40|51|35|E|}}) and a water source, now dried out, that used to flow {{convert|600|mi}} north east to the Persian Gulf via the [[Wadi Al-Rummah]] and [[Wadi Al-Batin]] system. Archaeological research led by of [[Boston University]] and the University of Qassim indicates that the river system was active in 8000&amp;nbsp; BCE{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} and 2500–3000&amp;nbsp;BCE.&lt;ref name=Sullivan2014&gt;{{cite news |last1=Sullivan |first1=Walter |title=Science Watch; Signs of Ancient River |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/30/science/science-watch-signs-of-ancient-river.html |accessdate=2014-06-25 |work=The New York Times |date=1993-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Madain Saleh (6725073553).jpg|thumb|[[Mada'in Saleh|''Al-Ḥijr'' or ''Madā’in Ṣāliḥ]]'' ("Cities of [[Saleh]]"), 2012]]

Saudi Arabia's first [[World Heritage Site]] that was recognized by the [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] is that of [[Al-Hijr Archaeological Site|Al-Hijr]]. The name "Al-Ḥijr" ("The Land of Stones" or "The Rocky Place") occurs in the [[Quran]],&lt;ref name="Cite quran|15|80|e=84|s=ns"&gt;{{cite quran|15|80|e=84|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the site is known for having structures carved into rocks, similar to [[Petra]].&lt;ref name="LonelyPlanet2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name=unesco&gt;{{cite web |title=Al-Hijr Archaeological Site (Madâin Sâlih) |publisher=UNESCO |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1293 |accessdate=2014-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction of the structures is credited to the people of [[Thamud]].

After the disappearance of Thamud from Mada'in Saleh, it came under the influence of other people, such as the [[Nabataeans]], whose capital was Petra.

==== Era of Abraham and Ishmael ====
According to Arab and Islamic sources, the civilization of Mecca started after [[Abraham in Islam|Ibrāhīm]] ([[Abraham]]) brought his son Ismā‘īl ([[Ishmael]]) and wife [[Hagar in Islam|Hājar]] ([[Hagar]]) here, for the latter two to stay. Some people from the tribe of [[Jurhum]] settled with them, and Isma'il reportedly married two women, one after divorcing another, at least one of them from this tribe, and helped his father to construct or re-construct the ''[[Ka‘bah]]'' ('Cube'),&lt;ref name="Cite quran|2|127|t=y|s=ns"&gt;{{Cite quran|2|127|t=y|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cite quran|3|96|t=y|s=ns"&gt;{{Cite quran|3|96|t=y|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cite quran|22|25|e=37|s=ns"&gt;{{Cite quran|22|25|e=37|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; which would have social, religious, political and historical implications for the site and region.&lt;ref name="Lings"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lings |first=Martin |authorlink=Martin Lings |title=[[Muhammad: His Life Based on the Earliest Sources]] |publisher=Islamic Texts Society |year=1983 |isbn=978-0-946621-33-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Glasse"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Glassé |first=Cyril |title=Kaaba |work=The Concise Encyclopedia of Islam |publisher=[[HarperSanFrancisco]] |year=1991 |url=https://books.google.com/books?redir_esc=y&amp;id=dlPuAAAAMAAJ |isbn=0060631260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, in Arab or Islamic belief, the tribe of [[Quraysh]] would descend from Isma'il [[Patronymic#Arabic|ibn]] Ibrahim, be based in the vicinity of the Ka'bah,&lt;ref name="Cite quran|106|1|e=4|s=ns"&gt;{{cite quran|106|1|e=4|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; and include [[Muhammad]] ibn [[Abdullah ibn Abdul-Muttalib]] ibn [[Hashim ibn Abd Manaf]]. From the Period of ''[[Jahiliyyah|Jāhiliyyah]]'' ('Ignorance') to the days of Muhammad, the often-warring Arab tribes would cease their hostilities during the time of [[Hajj|Pilgrimage]], and go on pilgrimage to Mecca, as inspired by Ibrahim.&lt;ref name="Cite quran|22|25|e=37|s=ns"/&gt; It was during such an occasion that Muhammad met some Medinans who would allow him to [[Hegira|migrate]] to Medina, to escape [[Persecution of Muslims by the Meccans|persecution by his opponents in Mecca]].&lt;ref name="Ishaq"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Ibn Ishaq |first=Muhammad |title=Ibn Ishaq's Sirat Rasul Allah – The Life of Muhammad Translated by A.

==== Era of Muhammad ====
{{Main|Muhammad in Islam}}
[[File:MasjidNabawi.jpg|thumb|[[Masjid al-Nabawi|Muhammad's Mosque]] in [[Medina]], his place-of-residence after the ''[[Hegira|Hijrah]]'' ({{lang-ar|هِـجْـرَة}}, Migration) from Mecca, 2010]]

As the land of Mecca&lt;ref name="Cite quran|48|22|e=29|s=ns"/&gt; and Medina,&lt;ref name="Cite quran|9|25|e=129|s=ns"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cite quran|33|09|e=73|s=ns"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cite quran|63|1|e=11|s=ns"/&gt; the Hijaz was where Muhammad was born, and where he founded a Monotheistic ''[[Ummah]]'' (Community) of followers, bore [[Sabr|patience]] with his foes or struggled against them, migrated from one place to another, [[Sunnah|preached or implemented]] his beliefs, lived and died. Given that he had both followers and enemies here, a number of battles or [[List of expeditions of Muhammad|expeditions]] were carried out in this area, like those of ''[[Battle of the Trench|al-Aḥzāb]]'' ("the Confederates"), [[Battle of Badr|Badr]]&lt;ref name="Cite quran|3|110|e=128|s=ns"&gt;{{cite quran|3|110|e=128|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Battle of Hunayn|Ḥunayn]]. They involved both Meccan [[Sahabah|companions]], such as [[Hamzah ibn Abdul-Muttalib]], [[Ubaydah ibn al-Harith]] and [[Sa`d ibn Abi Waqqas]], and Medinan companions.&lt;ref name="Cite quran|9|25|e=129|s=ns"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mubarakpuri, The Sealed Nectar"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Haykal 1976"/&gt;&lt;ref name="buk55774"&gt;{{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes|5|57|74}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pre-badr&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/60tV4Irei?url=http://www.witness-pioneer.org/vil/Books/SM_tsn/ch4s4.html Witness Pioneer "Pre-Badr Missions and Invasions"]&lt;/ref&gt; The Hijaz fell under Muhammad's influence as he emerged victorious over his opponents, and was thus a part of his empire.&lt;ref name="Lings"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ishaq"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Firestone1990"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tabari1987/&gt;&lt;ref name="EOIATMW"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Muhammad |work=Encyclopedia of Islam and the Muslim world |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Holt (1977) p, 57"&gt;Holt (1977), p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lapidus (2002), pp. 31–32"&gt;Lapidus (2002), pp. 31–32&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Subsequent history ===
Due to the presence of the two holy cities in the Hijaz, the region was ruled by numerous empires. The Hijaz was at the center of the [[Rashidun Caliphate]], in particular whilst its capital was Medina from 632 to 656 [[Common Era|ACE]]. The region was then under the control of regional powers such as [[Egypt]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]], throughout much of its later history.

==== Brief independence ====
{{Main|Kingdom of Hejaz}}

In 1916, [[Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca|Sharif Hussein ibn Ali]] proclaimed himself King of an independent Hejaz, as a result of the [[McMahon–Hussein Correspondence]]. The ensuing [[Arab Revolt]] overthrew the Ottoman Empire. In 1924, however, Ibn Ali's authority was replaced by that of [[Ibn Saud]] of the Najd.

==== In modern Saudi Arabia ====
{{Main|Regions of Saudi Arabia}}

At first, Ibn Saud ruled the two as separate units, though they became known as the [[Kingdom of Hejaz and Nejd]]. Later they were formally combined as the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

== Geography ==
[[File:Taif Mountains (8355942584).jpg|thumb|[[Hijaz mountains|Mountains]] near [[Ta'if]], 2012]]

The region is located along the [[Red Sea Rift]]. It is also known for its darker, more [[volcano|volcanic]] [[sand]]. Depending on the previous definition, the Hejaz includes the high mountains of [[Sarawat]], which topographically separate the Najd from Tehamah. [[Bdellium]] plants are also abundant in the Hijaz.

== International standard resort ==
As a component of [[Saudi Vision 2030]], a beach resort is proposed to be built on the [[Red Sea]] between the towns of [[Umluj]] ({{coord|25.0500|N|37.2651|E}}) and [[Al-Wajh]] ({{coord|26.2366|N|36.4689|E}}), in the northern section of the Hejazi coast.

== People of the Hejaz ==
People of Hejaz, who feel particularly connected to the holy places of Mecca and Medina, have probably the most strongly articulated identity of any regional grouping in Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref name="beranek1"/&gt;

The people of Hejaz have never fully accommodated to Saudi rule and their [[Wahhabi]] religion. They continue to be [[Sunni]] of [[Maliki]] [[rite]] with a [[Shia]] minority in the cities of Medina, Mecca and Jeddah. Many consider themselves more cosmopolitan because Hejaz was for centuries a part of the great empires of Islam from the [[Umayyads]] to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Riedel |first=Bruce |title=Brezhnev in the Hejaz |journal=The National Interest |year=2011 |volume=115 |url=http://www.relooney.info/SI_Milken-Arabia/0-Important_14.pdf |accessdate=April 23, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131115051640/http://www.relooney.info/SI_Milken-Arabia/0-Important_14.pdf |archivedate=November 15, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ISO 3166-2:HU''' is the entry for [[Hungary]] in [[ISO 3166-2]], part of the [[ISO 3166]] [[standardization|standard]] published by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), which defines [[code]]s for the names of the principal [[country subdivision|subdivision]]s (e.g., [[province]]s or [[state (administrative division)|state]]s) of all [[country|countries]] coded in [[ISO 3166-1]].

Currently for Hungary, ISO 3166-2 codes are defined for [[counties of Hungary|1 capital city, 19 counties, and 23 cities with county rights]]. The capital of the country [[Budapest]] has special status equal to the counties, while the cities with county rights, often called urban counties, have extended powers but are technically not independent of the counties.

Each code consists of two parts, separated by a hyphen. The first part is {{mono|HU}}, the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] code of Hungary. The second part is two letters.

==Current codes==
Subdivision names are listed as in the ISO 3166-2 standard published by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA).

[[File:ManchesterCity With Ferris.jpg|thumb|Inner city Manchester, England, 2007]]

In the [[United Kingdom]] the term "inner city" has been used as a euphemism for lower-income residential districts in the [[city center]] and nearby areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/higher/geography/human/urban/revision/4/|title=BBC - Higher Bitesize Geography - Urban : Revision, Page4|author=|date=|website=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sociologists sometimes turn this euphemism into a formal designation, applying the term "inner city" to such residential areas, rather than to geographically more [[Central business district|central commercial districts]]. Some inner city areas of American cities have undergone [[gentrification]], especially since the 1990s.&lt;ref name=governing&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Files/Programs/Metro/state_of_metro_america/metro_america_chapters/metro_america_race.pdf|title=''State of Metropolitan America'', Part II, "Race and Ethnicity"|p=62|author=|date=|website=brookings.edu|accessdate=7 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100530113853/http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Files/Programs/Metro/state_of_metro_america/metro_america_chapters/metro_america_race.pdf|archive-date=30 May 2010|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}} ([[Brookings Institution]]) and its analysis in {{cite web|last=Gurwitt|first=Rob|url=http://www.governing.com/topics/politics/Atlanta-and-the-Urban.html|title=Atlanta and the Urban Future|date=July 2008|work=[[Governing (magazine)|Governing]]|accessdate=April 5, 2010}} — see example in [[Demographics of Atlanta#Race and ethnicity|Demographics of Atlanta: Race and ethnicity]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The [[Lednice]]-[[Valtice]] Cultural Landscape''' (also '''Lednice-Valtice Area''' or '''Lednice-Valtice Complex''', {{lang-cs|Lednicko-valtický areál}}) is a [[Cultural landscape|cultural-natural landscape]] complex of {{convert|283.09|km²}} in the [[Lednice]] and [[Valtice]] areas of the [[South Moravian Region]], near [[Břeclav]] in the [[Czech Republic]].

The Lednice-Valtice Area is registered in the list of monuments protected as [[World Heritage Sites]] (WHS) by [[UNESCO]]. It is adjacent to the [[Pálava Landscape Protected Area]] (Pálava Biosphere Reserve), a WHS registered by UNESCO several years before. The close proximity of two [[cultural landscape]]s protected by UNESCO is unique.

== History==
The [[House of Liechtenstein]] acquired a castle in Lednice in 1249, which marked the beginning of their settlement in the area. It remained the  principal Liechtenstein residence for 700 years, until 1939 and World War II.  

===17th—19th centuries===
The [[Duke of Liechtenstein|Dukes of Liechtenstein]] transformed their properties into one large and designed private park between the 17th and 20th centuries. During the 19th century, the Dukes continued transforming the area as a large traditional [[English landscape garden|English landscape park]]. The [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] and [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival style]] architecture of their [[chateau]]x are married with smaller buildings and a landscape that was fashioned according to the English principles of landscape architecture.&lt;br/&gt;

In 1715 these two chateaux (castles) were connected by a [[avenue (landscape)|landscape alée]] and road, later renamed for the poet [[Petr Bezruč]].  The Lednice Ponds (''Lednické rybníky'') are situated between the villages of Valtice, Lednice, and Hlohovec; as are the ''Mlýnský'', ''Prostřední'', ''Hlohovecký'', and ''Nesyt'' Ponds. A substantial part of the cultural landscape complex is covered in [[pine]] forests, known as the "Pine−wood"(''Boří les''), and in areas adjacent to the [[Dyje|River Dyje]] with [[riparian forest]]s.

===20th century===
In the 20th century the region became part of new [[Czechoslovakia]]
The Liechtenstein family opposed the annexation of Czech territory in the fascist [[Sudetenland]] by [[Nazi Germany]], and as a consequence their properties were confiscated by the Nazis, and the family then relocated to [[Vaduz]] in 1939. After World War II the family made several legal attempts for restitution of the properties. However, they had passed post-war into ownership by the new communist [[Czechoslovakia]]. Of course its [[Communist]] government did not support returning large estates to exiled aristocratic landowners. 

After the Czechoslovakian [[Velvet Revolution]] in 1989, the Liechtenstein descendants again renewed legal attempts for restitution, which were denied by the Czech state, the present day owner of the properties. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The former Liechtenstein possessions of Lednice-Valtice |url=http://www.minorsights.com/2014/09/Czech-Lednice-Valtice.html|publisher=Minor Sights|accessdate=4 October 2014|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
The principal elements are:
* Chateau Valtice and its contiguous town/village of [[Valtice]].
* Chateau [[Lednice Castle]] and its contiguous village of [[Lednice]].
* The village of [[Hlohovec (Břeclav District)|Hlohovec]].

===Pavilions and follies===
In addition to the castles, there are many large to small residential [[pavilion]]s located throughout the designed landscape, often serving as chateau or hunting lodges.&lt;ref&gt;The term ''zámeček'' ({{lang-de|Schlösschen}}, literally a ''small château'') — is usually translated here as a "[[manor house]]" — or a "[[hunting lodge]]" ({{lang-cs|lovecký zámeček}}, {{lang-de|Jagdschlösschen}}), if it served for [[hunting]].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Preservation ==
The garden [[Folly (architecture)|follies]] and the [[Conservatory (greenhouse)|conservatory]] of Lednice Park were listed in the [[1998 World Monuments Watch]] by the [[World Monuments Fund]], for their deteriorating condition resulting from insufficient financial resources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wmf.org/project/lednice-and-valtice-cultural-landscape World Monuments Fund&amp;nbsp;– Lednice and Valtice Cultural Landscape]&lt;/ref&gt; The Fund had previously studied the preservation of Lednice and Valtice Castles, and after 1998 it helped fund restoration of the Valtice Rendezvous folly as a demonstration project with support from [[American Express]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20A1FF938580C768EDDAF0894D0494D81 Elaine Louie, New York Times, "Saving Endangered Art and Architecture," June 25, 1998.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Two have ended in failure, causing the death of the entire crew: [[STS-51-L]] ([[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|the ''Challenger'' disaster]]) in 1986, and [[STS-107]] ([[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|the ''Columbia'' disaster]]) in 2003. ([[Apollo 1]] in 1967 lost three crew members but never launched.)

===Future===

On May 7, the [[Obama Administration]] announced the launch of an independent review of planned U.S. human space flight activities with the goal of ensuring that the nation is on a vigorous and sustainable path to achieving its boldest aspirations in space. The review was conducted by a panel of experts led by [[Norman Augustine]], the former CEO of [[Lockheed Martin]], who served on the President's Council of Advisers on Science and Technology under both Democrat and Republican presidents.

The "[[Review of United States Human Space Flight Plans Committee|Review of United States Human Space Flight Plans]]" was to examine ongoing and planned National Aeronautics and Space Administration ([[NASA]]) development activities, as well as potential alternatives and present options for advancing a safe, innovative, affordable, and sustainable human space flight program in the years following Space Shuttle retirement. The panel worked closely with NASA and sought input from the [[United States Congress]], [[the White House]], the public, industry, and international partners as it developed its options. It presented its results on October 22, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/358006main_OSTP%20Press%20Release.pdf OSTP Press Release Announcing Review (pdf, 50k)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = No to NASA: Augustine Commission Wants to More Boldly Go|url = http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2009/10/no-nasa-augusti.html|accessdate = 2015-07-14|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130513130114/http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2009/10/no-nasa-augusti.html|archivedate = 2013-05-13|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2010, Obama announced his proposal to cancel the Constellation Program as part of the 2011 Economic Projects. Constellation was officially cancelled by the [[NASA Authorization Act of 2010|NASA Budget Authorization Act]] on 11 October 2010.

NASA brought the [[Orion MPCV]] back to life from the defunct Constellation Program and successfully test launched the first capsule on December 5, 2014 aboard [[EFT-1]].  After a near perfect flight traveling 3600 miles above Earth, the spacecraft was recovered for study.  NASA plans to use the Orion crew vehicle to send humans to deep space locations such as the Moon, Near Earth Asteroids, and Mars starting in the 2020s.  Orion will be powered by NASA's new heavy lift vehicle, the [[Space Launch System]] (SLS), which is currently under development.  Orion's next flight, along with the first SLS flight, is slated to launch in December 2019, with the designation of [[Exploration Mission 1]].  This mission will send an uncrewed Orion capsule around the Moon.  It will be succeeded by [[Exploration Mission 2]], sending a crewed Orion spacecraft to an undetermined location in the early 2020s.

There are no legally incorporated [[political parties]] in the [[Marshall Islands]], but there are unofficial groupings:

&lt;!--:''The general rule on naming applies. That means: the parties are named in the English translation and the original native name is placed on the first line of the article unless the native form is more commonly used in English than the English form.

The following is a list of presidents of the entertainment division for the [[American Broadcasting Company]] (ABC).  Prior to the mid 1970s, the role was essentially filled under the title '''Vice presidents of Programs'''.

|Notes
|-
|[[James T. Aubrey]]
|March 1957 – April 28, 1958
|As vice president in charge of programs (a title he gained before March 1957), he brought to the air what he recalled as "wild, sexy, lively stuff, things that had never been done before," shows such as ''[[Maverick (television program)|Maverick]]'', a western with [[James Garner]], and ''[[77 Sunset Strip]]'', a detective show with [[Efrem Zimbalist Jr.]] (However, by the time ''Strip'' went on the air in October 1958, Aubrey had already left the network.) Oulahan and Lambert said Aubrey scheduled "one lucrative show after another ... and for the first time the third network became a serious challenge to NBC and CBS." Among the successes he scheduled were ''[[The Donna Reed Show]]'', a domestic comedy; ''[[The Rifleman]]'', a western with [[Chuck Connors]]; and ''[[The Real McCoys]]'', a rural comedy with [[Walter Brennan]] and [[Richard Crenna]].
|-
|[[Thomas W. Moore]]
|1956–1957
|Among the shows aired during this time were ''[[The Real McCoys]]'', ''[[77 Sunset Strip]]'', ''[[My Three Sons]]'', ''[[The Flintstones]]'', ''[[Ben Casey]]'', and ''[[The Untouchables (1959 TV series)|The Untouchables]]''. While he was network president, the network added, among other shows, ''[[McHale's Navy]]'', ''[[Peyton Place (TV series)|Peyton Place]]'', ''[[The Addams Family (1964 TV series)|The Addams Family]]'' and ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]''.
|-
|[[Edgar Scherick]]
|June 1963–1966
|In June 1963, Scherick became Vice President of Programming for the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC Television Network]], where he created many popular shows including ''[[Bewitched]]'', ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'', ''[[That Girl]]'', ''[[The Hollywood Palace]]'', and ''[[Peyton Place (TV series)|Peyton Place]]''.
|-
|[[Leonard Goldberg]]
|1966–1969
|
|-
|[[Martin Starger]]
|1969–1972; 1972–1975
|He led ABC during its boom period in the 1970s, pioneering the creation of television shows such as ''[[ABC Movie of the Week]]'', ''[[Marcus Welby, M.D.]]'' and ''[[Happy Days]]''.  He also pushed the limits of television broadcast presiding over pioneering [[miniseries]] and specials such as ''[[Roots (1977 miniseries)|Roots]]'' and ''[[Rich Man, Poor Man (miniseries)|Rich Man, Poor Man]]''.  
|-
|[[Barry Diller]]
|1973–1974
|He was hired as an [[Personal assistant|assistant]] by [[Elton Rule]], then west coast head of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], who was promoted to network President at the same time Diller went to work for him in 1964, taking him on to New York City. Diller was soon placed in charge of negotiating broadcast rights to feature films. He was promoted to Vice President of Development in 1965. In this position, Diller created the ''[[ABC Movie of the Week]]'', pioneering the concept of the [[Television movie|made-for-television movie]] through a regular series of 90-minute films produced exclusively for television.&lt;ref name="Karol2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Karol|first=Michael|title=The ABC Movie of the Week Companion: A Loving Tribute to the Classic Series|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lIpxL04mqN8C&amp;pg=PR19|accessdate=October 10, 2010|date=June 2005|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=978-0-595-35836-6|page=XIX}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
|[[Fred Silverman]]
|1975–1978
|Silverman was named president of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC Entertainment]] in 1975,&lt;ref&gt;Smith-Shomade, Beretta E. (January 10, 2013) &lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;"[https://books.google.com/books?id=EV0jAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA20&amp;lpg=PA20&amp;dq=fred+silverman+mash&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=uttOpC72lK&amp;sig=FHHeYScBQ_tPaYty0sanuxIAQRg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=dkH0U6TTL4fg8gGE-4CADw&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=fred%20silverman%20mash&amp;f=false Watching While Black]".&lt;/span&gt; 
Rutgers University Press, p. 21, 280 pages. Retrieved August 20, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; putting him in the awkward position of saving ''[[Happy Days]]'', the very show that ''Good Times'' had brought to the brink of cancellation. Silverman succeeded in bringing ''Happy Days'' to the top of the ratings and generating a hit spin-off from that show, ''[[Laverne &amp; Shirley]]''. At ABC, Silverman also [[Greenlight|greenlit]] other popular series such as ''[[The Bionic Woman]]'' (a ''[[The Six Million Dollar Man|Six Million Dollar Man]]'' spin-off), ''[[Family (1976 U.S. TV series)|Family]]'', ''[[Charlie's Angels]]'', ''[[Donny &amp; Marie (1976 TV series)|Donny &amp; Marie]]'', ''[[Three's Company]]'', ''[[Eight Is Enough]]'', ''[[The Love Boat]]'', ''[[Soap (TV series)|Soap]]'', ''[[Fantasy Island]]'', ''[[Good Morning America]]'', long form pioneer ''[[Rich Man, Poor Man (miniseries)|Rich Man, Poor Man]]'' and the award-winning miniseries, ''[[Roots (1977 miniseries)|Roots]]''. These moves brought ABC's long-dormant ratings from third place to first place. However, Silverman was criticized during this period for relying heavily on escapist fare (it was Silverman who conceived the infamous ''[[The Brady Bunch Hour]]'' with [[Sid and Marty Krofft]] in late 1976) and for bringing T&amp;A or "[[jiggle TV]]" to the small screen with numerous ABC shows featuring buxom, attractive, and often scantily-clad young women (such as the popular ''[[Battle of the Network Stars]]''). [[ABC Daytime]] had mediocre ratings, so in order to increase them, Silverman hired [[Gloria Monty]] to produce the ailing ''[[General Hospital]]''. He gave Monty thirteen weeks to increase the serial's ratings or it would be cancelled. He later expanded ''General Hospital'' and ''[[One Life to Live]]'' to a full hour, and created a 3{{frac|1|2}} hour afternoon serial block. Among game shows, Silverman introduced Goodson-Todman's ''[[Family Feud]]'' to the network. During Silverman's time at ABC, he overhauled the network's [[Saturday-morning cartoon]] output, dumping [[Filmation]] (which had produced the failed ''[[Uncle Croc's Block]]'') and replacing it with content from Hanna-Barbera, including a continuation of ''Scooby-Doo''. ABC abandoned the [[wiping]] of video-taped programs under Silverman's watch in 1978, as CBS had done while he was at that network.

|[[Anthony Thomopoulos]]
|1978–1983
|His big break came in 1973, when Barry Diller hired him on at ABC to oversee prime-time programming. He was noted, among other things, for the tough position he took in dealing with the contract holdout of [[Suzanne Somers]] on the hit ABC show ''[[Three's Company]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Tom Shales]], [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-263644.html "Behind 'Three's Company,' Somers and Smoke"], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', May 12, 2003 {{subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and for his quick cancellation of the 1982 cult favorite ''[[Police Squad!]]'', explaining that the show had been cancelled because, among other reasons, "it required constant attention".&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Holsapple, [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=VuEhAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=9l4EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6972%2C221691 "Do Viewers Need Help With 'Police Squad?'], ''[[Pittsburgh Press]]'', July 1, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steve Weinstein, [http://articles.latimes.com/1990-03-04/entertainment/ca-2833_1_doctor "Never Ready for Prime Time? : 'Doctor, Doctor' is the latest wild and crazy comedy to find the going tough on network TV"], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', March 4, 1990."&lt;/ref&gt;  
|-
|[[Lewis Erlicht]] 
|1983 – November 1985
|After seeing [[Emmanuel Lewis]] in a [[Burger King]] commercial, ABC's programming chief, Lew Erlicht, wanted to give the actor his [[Webster (TV series)|own series]]. At this time, ''Another Ballgame'' creator Stu Silver desired to develop an original show based on the lead characters portrayed by [[Katharine Hepburn]] and [[Spencer Tracy]] in the film ''[[Woman of the Year]]'' and saw [[Alex Karras]] and [[Susan Clark]]'s on-screen chemistry as being strikingly reminiscent of this. The network felt the need to cast Lewis in a project quickly, before he grew another inch (like child actor [[Gary Coleman]], who was also small for his age, Lewis would end up at 4'3".) With the number of comedy pilots ABC had greenlit for that fall's schedule, it was likely that Lewis would not be able to get his own series and timeslot unless he was worked into already-existing comedy projects. So, among others shows, co-producers on ''Another Ballgame'' were approached about working Lewis into the show. Stars Karras and Clark liked the idea of the sudden marriage and instant adoption of a young black boy, and the Webster character was thus created. ''[[Moonlighting (TV series)|Moonlighting]]'' was created by [[Glenn Gordon Caron]], one of the producers of the similar ''[[Remington Steele]]'', when he was approached by Erlicht. Erlicht liked the work Caron had done on ''[[Taxi (TV series)|Taxi]]'' and ''[[Remington Steele]]'' and wanted a detective show featuring a major star in a leading role who would appeal to an upscale audience. Caron wanted to do a romance, to which Erlicht replied "I don't care what it is, as long as it's a detective show.”

{{Politics of Malta}}
Since June 30, 1993, '''[[Malta]]''' has been subdivided into 68 localities, governed by '''local councils''', {{lang-mt|kunsilli lokali}}, meaning [[municipalities]] or [[borough]]. These form the most basic form of local government and there are no intermediate levels between it and the national level. The levels of the 6 districts (5 on the main island) and of the 3 regions (2 on the main island) serve statistical purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://daneshnamehicsa.ir/userfiles/file/Resources/18-3)%20Europa/Malta_EN.pdf |title=Report|date= |website=daneshnamehicsa.ir }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Local Councils Act (Chapter 363 of the Laws of Malta), Art. 3:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.justiceservices.gov.mt/DownloadDocument.aspx?app=lom&amp;itemid=8833&amp;l=1|title=Report|website=justiceservices.gov.mt}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
(1)  Every locality shall have a Council which shall have all such functions as are granted to it by this Act&lt;br&gt;
...&lt;br&gt;
(5) Each locality shall be referred to by the name as designated in the Second Schedule and any reference to that locality shall be by the name so designated.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''M6 Toll''', also called the '''Birmingham North Relief Road''' ('''BNRR''') (and sometimes named on slip roads as the Midland Expressway), connects [[M6 motorway|M6]] Junction 3a at the Coleshill Interchange to M6 Junction 11A at [[Wolverhampton]] with {{convert|27|mi}} of six-lane motorway. 

The M6 Toll is the only major [[Toll roads in Great Britain|toll road]] in Great Britain, and has two payment plazas, [[Great Wyrley]] Toll Plaza for northbound and [[Weeford]] Toll Plaza for southbound. The northbound toll plaza is situated between junctions T6 and T7, and the southbound between junctions T4 and T3. The weekday cash cost is £6.40 for a car and £11.00 for a [[Heavy Goods Vehicle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.m6toll.co.uk/pricing/pricing-guide/|title=M6toll pricing guide|publisher=M6toll|accessdate=7 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The M6 Toll is part of the (unsigned in the UK) [[international E-road network|E-road]] [[European route E05|E05]] and is subject to the same regulations and policing as other motorways in the UK. It has one service station along its 27-mile stretch, [[Norton Canes services]].

==History==

===Planning and construction===
Proposals for a new publicly funded motorway were circulated in 1980.&lt;ref name="M6T_About"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.m6toll.co.uk/about/project.asp|title=M6 Toll – Overview|work=M6 Toll|accessdate=24 January 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080211200131/http://www.m6toll.co.uk/about/project.asp|archivedate=11 February 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally called the Birmingham North Relief Road (BNRR) and designed to alleviate the increasing congestion on the [[M6 motorway|M6]] through [[Birmingham]] and the [[Black Country]] in England. This was the busiest section of the M6, carrying up to 180,000 vehicles per day when it was designed to carry only 72,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = M6 Toll - four years on | publisher = [[BBC Online]] | date = 30 November 2007 | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/birmingham/content/articles/2007/11/30/m6_toll_have_your_say_feature.shtml | accessdate = 5 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Five alternative routes were put for consultation in 1980 and a preferred route was published in 1986. In 1989 there was a public inquiry relating to a publicly funded motorway.&lt;ref name=M6T_About/&gt;

In 1989 it was announced that it would be built privately and a competition took place which was won by Midland Expressway Ltd in 1991.&lt;ref name=M6T_About/&gt; The contract was for a 53-year concession to build and operate the road as an early form of [[public private partnership]] with the operator paying for the construction and recouping its costs by setting and collecting tolls, allowing for a 3-year construction period followed by 50 years of operation. At the end of this period the infrastructure would be returned to the Government. Toll rates are set at the discretion of the operator at six-monthly intervals and there is no cap on the rates charged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldha nsrd/pdvn/lds05/text/50614w04.htm |title=Lords Hansard text |date=14 June 2005 |accessdate=30 September 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160116183303/http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldha |archivedate=16 January 2016 }} &lt;/ref&gt;

There was a second public inquiry from relating to the new scheme in 1994–1995 and a decision to go ahead in 1997. A legal challenge was made by the "Alliance against BNRR" which was cleared in 1998.&lt;ref name=M6T_About/&gt;

MEL contracted out the construction of the road to a consortium of major contractors [[Carillion]], [[Alfred McAlpine]], [[Balfour Beatty]] and [[AMEC]] (together known as CAMBBA).&lt;ref name=M6T_About/&gt;

Site clearance started in 2000, construction work began in mid-2002 and the road opened in December 2003.&lt;ref name=M6T_About/&gt; When creating the surface of the road 2.5 million [[Mills &amp; Boon]] novels were pulped and mixed into the [[Asphalt concrete|tarmac]] to help the surface absorbency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/west_midlands/3330245.stm|title=M6 Toll built with pulped fiction|date=3 December 2003|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=24 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2003 freight operators indicated that they planned to keep their vehicles on the heavily congested M6 through Birmingham rather than send them on the new motorway due to high fees. The [[AA Motoring Trust]] said it welcomed the decision to make lorries pay a premium rate explaining that "Car drivers find lorries intimidating and they frequently hold up traffic on motorways when overtaking each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://driving.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/driving/article1068918.eceLorry |title=drivers to bypass toll road|date=3 August 2003|author=Ben Webster|work=[[The Times]]|accessdate=24 January 2008 | location=London}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The road was partially opened on 9 December 2003 for traffic entering from local junctions, then fully opened on 14 December 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/staffordshire/3346931.stm|title=M6 Toll figures 'encouraging'|date=24 December 2003|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=24 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First year of operation===
On 10 January 2004, five weeks after opening, a short section of the road near [[Sutton Coldfield]] was reduced to one lane to allow for repairs to an uneven surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icbirmingham.icnetwork.co.uk/0100news/0100localnews/content_objectid=13923135_method=full_siteid=50002_headline=-M6-Toll-branded-big-flop-name_page.html |title=M6 Toll branded big flop |date=6 February 2004 |work=icBirmingham |accessdate=24 January 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208191617/http://icbirmingham.icnetwork.co.uk/0100news/0100localnews/content_objectid%3D13923135_method%3Dfull_siteid%3D50002_headline%3D-M6-Toll-branded-big-flop-name_page.html |archivedate=8 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 July 2004 prices for heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) were reduced from £10 to £6 to encourage them to use the route "for a trial period".&lt;ref name=Aug13/&gt;

===Traffic levels===
In December 2004, one year after opening, Friends of the Earth issued a press release expressing concern that faced with lower than expected traffic numbers, Midland Expressway were trying to attract new traffic-generating developments to greenbelt and greenfield sites in the M6 Toll Corridor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foe.org.uk/resource/press_releases/first_anniversary_of_m6_to_08122004.html |title=First Anniversary of M6 Toll Opening |date=9 December 2004 |publisher=Friends of the Earth |accessdate=24 January 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050514063135/http://www.foe.org.uk/resource/press_releases/first_anniversary_of_m6_to_08122004.html |archivedate=14 May 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in April 2005 the [[Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors]] reported that there was strong interest in the commercial property market place around the M6 Toll "zone of influence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rics.org/lostproperty/Jennifer+Deletions/m6toll010405.htm |title=The M6 Toll: 12 Months On |date=1 May 2005 |author=John de Kanter |publisher=Royal Institute for Chartered Surveyors |accessdate=24 January 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080504075553/http://www.rics.org/lostproperty/Jennifer%2BDeletions/m6toll010405.htm |archivedate= 4 May 2008 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2005 the Macquarie Infrastructure Group reported that traffic figures were "disappointing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newratings.com/analyst_news/article_814169.html|title= MIG M6 April Traffic Disappointing – GSJBW |date=23 May 2005|work=new ratings|accessdate=24 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2005 the Highways Agency confirmed in its own "one year" study showing that usage had settled at around 50,000 vehicle per day (lower than the predicted 74,000) but that traffic volumes on the M6 had reduced slightly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/documents/one_year_after_study.pdf |title=one year after study |publisher=Highways Agency |date=11 August 2005 |accessdate=24 January 2008 |format=PDF |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5lNKToGIN?url=http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/documents/one_year_after_study.pdf |archivedate=18 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2008, traffic levels started to fall. Traffic in the first quarter of 2009 was 39,000 vehicles-per-day (Monday-Friday figures),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.m6toll.co.uk/about-us/traffic-figures/2009/17-04-09/ |title= M6 Toll Q1 2009 Traffic Figures}}&lt;/ref&gt; but recovered to reach 54,000 in the second quarter of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.m6toll.co.uk/about-us/traffic-figures/latest-reports/april-june-2015/ |title=M6 Toll Q2 2015 Traffic Figures |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018162141/https://www.m6toll.co.uk/about-us/traffic-figures/latest-reports/april-june-2015/ |archivedate=18 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a 5% discount for using a tag. Leasing of one tag currently costs £1.00/month. In addition, a monthly administrative fee of £2.00 is charged if the user wishes to receive a postal statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://secure.m6toll.co.uk/account/tags.asp?mainmenuid=5 |title=M6 Toll – Overview – Tags |publisher=M6 Toll |date=18 February 2009 |accessdate=18 February 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070628191410/https://secure.m6toll.co.uk/account/tags.asp?mainmenuid=5 |archivedate=28 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exit/entry at some of the intermediate junctions away from the main toll booths entails a reduced toll, typically £1 less than the full fee.

===M6 Expressway===
There was a proposal to build a new toll motorway, called the M6 Expressway running from the end of the M6 Toll to [[Knutsford]], where much of the traffic leaves the M6 for [[Manchester]]. It was announced on 20 July 2006 that this proposal had been abandoned due to excessive costs and anticipated construction problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gnn.gov.uk/Content/Detail.asp?ReleaseID=215626&amp;NewsAreaID=2 |title=Decision on M6 upgrade announced |date=20 July 2006 |accessdate=30 September 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313184117/http://www.gnn.gov.uk/Content/Detail.asp?ReleaseID=215626&amp;NewsAreaID=2 |archivedate=13 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collection===
Tolls can be paid by one of four means: automated coin payments, payment at a staffed toll booth, automated [[credit card|credit]]/[[debit card]] payments or in advance via an M6 Toll tag. Not all methods are available at all toll gates; each of the toll gates features an electronic sign showing the payment methods available at the time.

Vehicles are classified electronically at the toll booths according to their number of wheels, number of axles and height at first axle. Thus vehicles with trailers are charged extra and some large models of [[Four wheel drive|4x4]] are classified as vans.

Failure to pay the toll for using the motorway is a civil offence; anyone attempting to do so will be issued with an unpaid toll notice and required to send payment. If it is not paid within two days a £10 administration charge is added, plus further costs will be added if the toll is still unpaid after 14 days.

An M6 Toll tag is an [[electronic toll collection]] device attached to a vehicle's windscreen, which records the vehicle's passage through [[toll plaza]]s on the M6 Toll.

Each tag can only be used with the registered [[Registration plate|number plate]] and has a unique account. All accounts on the M6 Toll are pre-paid, and must contain a positive balance, sufficient to cover the cost of the vehicle's toll, in order for the vehicle to be allowed through the toll gate. If the balance is sufficient, the tag will beep once and the barrier at the toll gate will automatically raise. If the balance is low (fewer than three journeys remaining), the tag will beep twice. If the balance of the account cannot cover the cost of the toll, the barrier will remain closed and an alternative method of payment must be used.
Balances can be topped up automatically once a month using [[Direct Debit]] or [[credit card]], or by [[cheque]].

The tags contain a microchip which uses [[radio-frequency identification]] (RFID) technology. Physically, the tag resembles a [[Dartford Crossing#Charges and DART-Tag|DART-Tag]], as used to pay the tolls on the [[Dartford Crossing]]. The two systems do not interoperate.

==Midland Expressway Ltd==
The contract to build and operate the M6 Toll was won by Midland Expressway Ltd (MEL) in 1991.&lt;ref name=M6T_About/&gt; In 2005 MEL reported an operating profit of around £16&amp;nbsp;million. Total revenue was £45&amp;nbsp;million, with staff and other operating costs amounting to £11.4&amp;nbsp;million and depreciation of £17.4&amp;nbsp;million. Taking into account net interest costs of around £43&amp;nbsp;million, that leaves an overall loss of £26.5&amp;nbsp;million in 2005 – their first full financial year.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://tollroadsnews.info/artman/publish/article_1266.shtml |title=M6Toll traffic returning after toll increase last summer |date=13 February 2006 |accessdate=30 September 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928025300/http://tollroadsnews.info/artman/publish/article_1266.shtml |archivedate=28 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of June 2005, MEL was 100% owned by [[Macquarie Infrastructure Group]] (MIG) of Australia, which operated several tolled roads in Australia and North America. Long term debt was £819&amp;nbsp;million as of 30 June 2005. Disappointing traffic figures for 2005 led to a price rise in June, and MIG Chief Executive Steve Allen commented in the Australian newspaper ''[[The Age]]'', "What we need is to slow down the M6".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/business/morgan-takes-the-chair-at-biodiem/2005/08/26/1124562983424.html|title=Morgan takes the chair at BioDiem|date=26 August 2005|accessdate=30 September 2007 | location=Melbourne | work=The Age}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Business leaders in [[Staffordshire]], now effectively closer to London, welcomed the opening of the road, saying that it would make it easier to do business there.&lt;ref name="head to head"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3303629.stm|title=Head to head: M6 toll road|date=9 December 2003|accessdate=30 September 2007 | work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2006 the decision to not increase tolls was put down to disappointing traffic levels and led to a reduction in value for the owner.&lt;ref name="June2006"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/Business/MIGs-toll-decision-leads-to-downgrade/2006/05/23/1148150241558.html|title=MIG's toll decision leads to downgrade|date=23 May 2006|accessdate=30 September 2007 | work=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 MIG was split into two, and the M6 Toll is now managed by Macquarie Atlas Roads.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macquarie.com/mgl/com/mqa/asset-portfolio MQA Macquarie Atlas Roads: Asset portfolio]. Retrieved 24 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The road was put up for sale in 2016 and was sold to [[IFM Investors]] in June 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-40285221|title=M6 Toll is sold to investment group IFM|date=15 June 2017|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|accessdate=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==

===Design===
The M6 Toll lacks a proper link with the [[M54 motorway|M54]], which joins the M6 1.5&amp;nbsp;miles/2.5&amp;nbsp;km south of the northern end of the M6 Toll. Plans are afoot to link them eventually&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbrd.co.uk/futures/m54-link-to-m6toll/|title=M54 link to M6 Toll|date=23 January 2012|accessdate=24 July 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120510060612/http://www.cbrd.co.uk/futures/m54-link-to-m6toll/|archivedate=10 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/projects/11814.aspx |title=M54 to M6 / M6 (Toll) Link Road |publisher=Highways Agency |accessdate=24 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but for the time being traffic between the two has to use either the slow and often congested [[A460 road|A460]] to M54 J1, or go from M54 J2 via the [[A449]] and [[A5 road (Great Britain)|A5]] to M6 J12 – an extra 4&amp;nbsp;miles/7&amp;nbsp;km. It is unclear why access to/from the M54, which provides a link to the West Midlands from [[Shropshire]] and much of [[Wales]], was not considered a priority when the toll road was being built;{{fact|date=October 2016}}  indeed, the M6 Toll did not appear on the M54's junction signs (at J2) until early 2009, more than 5 years after the road was opened.

Since the M6 Toll was designed primarily to speed journeys between the North West and the South East of England (by bypassing Birmingham), it offers no relief to traffic travelling to and from the South West region of the country, which has to continue using the "old" M6 in order to access the M5.  The default lanes on the southbound M6 direct drivers onto the M6 Toll, making it easy for traffic bound for the South West, and indeed Birmingham itself, to accidentally enter the toll road, which will not only cost them the toll but will also take them severely off course.

===Misleading signage===

Soon after the opening of the M6 Toll new signage directed drivers making local journeys onto the toll road. As well as incurring toll charges, the new routes were longer than the original routes leading to accusations that this was just a ploy to increase traffic on the M6 Toll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abd.org.uk/local/m6_toll.htm |title=Association of British Drivers |accessdate=20 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101212060415/http://abd.org.uk/local/m6_toll.htm |archivedate=12 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar accusations have been made about traffic signs on the M6 that announce "M6 TOLL CLEAR", even when the M6 is also clear, that are under the control of Midland Expressway Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/birmingham/travel/m6toll_comments_page.shtml|title=BBC Birmingham|accessdate=20 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; These issues are mentioned on the M6 Toll FAQ pages, with explanations which emphasise that all drivers using the road are still liable to pay the toll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.m6toll.co.uk/about-us/faq/|title=M6 Toll FAQ|accessdate=14 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protest during planning and construction===
Environmental campaigners opposed the road, from its inception. While the road was being built some advocates of direct action dug tunnels under Moneymore Cottage and two large underground bunkers in an adjacent wood named the Greenwood Camp. The camp was in the path of the road in order to frustrate and delay the work. Peter Faulding, a confined space rescue specialist from Specialist Group International who removed Swampy the anti-roads protester from the A30 protest and from the Newbury Bypass tunnels, was brought in to safely remove a number of protesters tunnelled deep underground. The tunnels were very complex and on different levels in Moneymore Cottage. Operation Encompass as it was called by the police was run by the Under sheriff of Staffordshire Mr John James, the eviction operation ran for fourteen days enabling construction to begin.
     
[[Friends of the Earth]] claimed that the road would not relieve much traffic from the [[West Midlands conurbation]] as most users using the M6 in that area began or ended their journeys within the conurbation and so the M6 Toll would offer no advantage to them. Their campaign co-ordinator for the West Midlands, Chris Crean, said that although the £900&amp;nbsp;million cost of the road had been borne by private companies, the money should have been spent on public transport.&lt;ref name="head to head"/&gt;

==Features==
[[File:M6 Toll plaza, Great Wyrley.jpg|thumb|right|Toll plaza for northbound traffic at [[Great Wyrley]]]]
The M6 Toll has few junctions, and some have limited access to discourage local traffic. Like modern toll roads in continental Europe, the M6 Toll still uses [[toll plaza]]s.

The construction of the motorway threatened the restoration of the [[Lichfield Canal]], which cut across the motorway's route. The Lichfield and Hatherton Canals Restoration Trust campaigned and raised funds to build an [[Lichfield Canal Aqueduct|aqueduct]] to carry the canal over the motorway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.m6toll.co.uk/about/environment.asp |title=Stress Free Motoring – Not found |publisher=M6toll |date= |accessdate=31 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207132342/http://www.m6toll.co.uk/about/environment.asp |archivedate=7 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The aqueduct has been finished but the canal has yet to reach it, giving it an odd appearance, known to some local residents as "The Climbing Lemming Bridge".

The motorway's only [[motorway service station|service station]] is situated at [[Norton Canes services|Norton Canes]], between junctions T6 and T7.

==Junctions==
The towns, cities and roads listed are those given on road signs on the motorway as the junction is approached.

The southernmost section of the M6 Toll, south of Junction T1, is shared by traffic using the M42. Vehicles using only this five-mile section are not charged a toll.

==Statutory instruments==
Each [[motorway]] in England requires that a legal document called a [[statutory instrument (UK)|statutory instrument]] be published, detailing the route of the road, before it can be built. The dates given on these statutory instruments relate to when the document was published, and not when the road was built. Provided below is a list (possibly incomplete) of the statutory instruments relating to the M6 Toll.

[[File:Yttre Masthamnen 2011.jpg|thumb|right|Yttre Masthamnen, view to the west with [[Ersta klippan]] and a [[Viking Line]] ship in the background.]]
'''Masthamnen''' and '''Yttre Masthamnen''' are the eastern extension of the [[Stadsgården|Stadsgårdshamnen]] in [[Södermalm]], [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]]. The [[wharf]] area, which is owned by the corporation [[Stockholms Hamnar]], is about 600 metres long, and is mostly located between [[Londonviadukten]] and [[Fåfängan]] on one side and [[Saltsjön]] on the other, it stretches from [[Varvsbranten]] in the west to the mouth of the [[Danvikskanalen]] channel in the east. Today, Masthamnen serves the [[Viking Line]] [[Baltic Sea cruiseferries|cruiseferries]] while Yttre Masthamnen serves international [[cruiseferry|cruiseferries]].

==Etymology==
A "mast harbour" (''masthamn'') was an area in a [[harbour]], surrounded with a [[palisade]], where lumber used for masts was stored.&lt;ref&gt;[http://g3.spraakdata.gu.se/saob/ Svenska Akademins ordbok], entry "masthamn"&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Masthamnen got its current name in 1925. The naming board of the city of Stockholm states: "A map from 11 January 1774 over the area, established as a permission to use the cliff for businessman Fredrik Lundin [...] shows the situation of the mast harbour previously located by the western end of the cliff face." Even on a drawing of the Stockholm ship docks from 1745 can ''"masthamnen"'' be seen mentioned.&lt;ref&gt;Stockholms gatunamn (1986), pp. 217-218&lt;/ref&gt; The "cliff face" referred to Fåfängan and Fredrik Lundin constructed his mansion and his villa ''Fåfängan'' there. The mansion is still there, nowadays located in the wharf area.

Together with the need to expand Stadsgårdshamnen, work on the ship docks could no longer continue, [[Tegelviken]] was reconstructed, and the new Stadsgårdshamnen and its exit to [[Folkungagatan, Stockholm|Folkungagatan]] was inaugurated in August 1910. In the 1940s, the area for Yttre Masthamnen was developed, partly on a filled part of Saltsjön. On a Stockholm map from 1940 there are three narrow areas named ''Hamnarbetaren'', ''Skeppslasten'' and ''Vinschen''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stockholmskallan.se/index.php?sokning=2&amp;action=visaPost&amp;karta=true&amp;fritext=zoom&amp;epok=1900-talet&amp;start=0&amp;mediaId=10311&amp;post=0 Stockholmskällan, Stockholm map from 1940] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110223220453/http://www.stockholmskallan.se/index.php?sokning=2 |date=2011-02-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current situation==
[[File:Viking Line terminal Stockholm.jpg|thumb|right|Viking Line's ''[[MS Mariella]]'' in Masthamnen.]]
[[File:Emerald Princess Masthamnen 2011b.jpg|thumb|right|The cruiseferry ''[[MS Emerald Princess]]'' in Yttre Masthamnen.]]
Stadsgården, together with Masthamnen, is an important harbour for cruiseferry traffic. Masthamnen's western part and the Londonviadukten area now (2011) serve Viking Line cruiseferries. Yttre Masthamnen is the only central location in Stockholm where large cruiseferries can anchor. Stockholms Hamnar has two wharf places here. Outside travel season, the area is poorly used and is spotted with large [[asphalt]] areas with parking places for [[lorry|lorries]] and containers. The construction board of the city of Stockholm has made a detailed plan which gives Viking Line the right to retain the buildings that have had temporary building permissions until the year 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[http://insyn.stockholm.se/exploatering/document/2008-06-12/Dagordning/19/19.pdf Law revision about Masthamnen, service announcement 2008-05-22, pp. 2-3]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Masthamnen development project==
The [[Danvikslösen]] project contains a plan to rebuild the [[Saltsjöbanan]] to match the double track standard of the [[Tvärbanan]]. The current plan is to widen the current track, with a new station south of Londonviadukten. The Danvikslösen project has presented several development proposals, containing drawings by [[Jan Inghe-Hagström]] (1944-2005), a former plan architect in the municipality of Stockholm, [[White arkitekter]] and [[Rosenbergs Arkitekter]]. Of the proposals, White arkitekter was seen to have the best connection to the rest of north-eastern Södermalm. Their proposals include a proposal to cover Londonviadukten with a roof. According to a rough cost analysis, covering Londonviadukten with a roof should cost about 250 million [[Swedish krona|kronor]]. Other costs have not been studied.&lt;ref&gt;[http://insyn.stockholm.se/exploatering/document/2008-06-12/Dagordning/19/19.pdf Law revision about Masthamnen, service announcement 2008-05-22, pp. 5-9]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Microtubing''' or ''spaghetti tubing'' is a very fine plastic tubing used in [[drip irrigation]], typically in [[garden]]s and  [[greenhouse]]s, with a small inside diameter which may be 0.05" or smaller.  

Microtubing is inserted directly into the supply tubing, usually without any fittings.  The flow is regulated by the inside diameter of the tube and the length of tubing used.  The smaller the diameter and the longer the tube, the greater the friction loss, thus reducing the pressure and flow.  The end of the tube may have a plastic or lead weight to hold the tube in a pot.  

Microtubing is one of the oldest products made for drip irrigation, having been manufactured for about fifty years.  It has largely been replaced by other drip irrigation products such as [[Drip irrigation#Emitter|emitter]]s, [[Irrigation sprinkler|microsprinkler]]s, and [[drip tape]].

The district of '''Moruga''' lies on the central south coast of [[Trinidad]] at the western end of the [[Trinity Hills]]. It is in [[Victoria County, Trinidad and Tobago]], and is served by the [[Princes Town Regional Corporation]].

[[File:Moruga - Village on the south coast of Trinidad, West Indies.jpg|thumb|left|Moruga - Village on the south coast of Trinidad, West Indies. Main occupations are agriculture and fishing.

[[File:Moruga coastline.jpg|thumb|left|Moruga coastline. The south coast of the island of Trinidad is subject to severe coastal erosion. The soft sandstone rocks are constantly battered by rough seas. Stacks, arches, sand spits and lagoons are common coastal features along this coastline.]]

The village is close to Trinidad's oil reserves, and that and fishing are the area's main economies with some of the residents of the community working in [[Princes Town]] and [[San Fernando, Trinidad and Tobago|San Fernando]]. It is somewhat of a rural dormitory district for these larger urban areas.

Moruga was in the national news in 1998 when a historic bridge near the town collapsed as a van was being driven over it (there were no fatalities).

The main communities within the Moruga district (heading south from Princes Town) are Indian Walk, Fifth Company, Preau (St Mary's), Cachipe, Rock River, Basse Terre, Bois Jean Jean, Grand Chemin, La Lune and Marac, with the last three communities located on the coast. Basse Terre has the largest population and Grand Chemin is the location of the major government buildings such as the local police station, library and public health facility. Moruga Proper hosts the Moruga museum, a small museum depicting the history of Moruga and Trinidad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://morugamuseum1.wordpress.com/ | title=Moruga Museum | publisher=Moruga Museum | accessdate=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Moruga is said to be the place where [[Christopher Columbus]] landed when he "discovered" Trinidad.

The communities near to the sea are noted nationwide as the locations of good sea-bathing spots such as La Retrait (off Lanse Mitan Road), which is the site of the popular "Ash Wednesday cool-down".

The '''NUTS codes of [[Greece]]''' are part of the [[Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics]], an official nomenclature of the [[European Commission]] used by [[Eurostat]] for statistical purposes.

==Changes==

In 2011, the NUTS1 code of Greece was changed from GR to EL. GR1 was changed to EL5, GR2 to EL6, GR3 to EL3 and GR4 to EL4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Eurostat]]|title=History of NUTS|url=http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/nuts/history|accessdate=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The change became official per [[European Commission]] regulation No. 31/2011. With regard to the transmission of data to [[Eurostat]], the new codes entered into force by 1 January 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[European Commission]]|title=Commission Regulation (EU) No. 31/2011 of 17 January 2011|work=[[Official Journal of the European Union]]|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2013:342:0001:0057:EN:PDF|date=18 January 2011|accessdate=9 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Kallikratis programme|Kallikrates territorial reform]], the NUTS regions of Greece were redefined. With the region of [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]] being reclassified as part of [[Voreia Ellada]] (''Northern Greece'', former EL1), and the region of [[Thessaly]] in exchange going to [[Kentriki Ellada]] (''Central Greece'', former EL2), new NUTS1 codes have been assigned to both regions. Apart from that, a number of third-level divisions have been changed. The changes became official in December 2013 by [[European Commission]] regulation No. 1319/2013. With regard to the transmission of data to [[Eurostat]], the new codes entered into force by 1 January 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[European Commission]]|title=Commission Regulation (EU) No. 1319/2013 of 9 December 2013|work=[[Official Journal of the European Union]]|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2013:342:0001:0057:EN:PDF|date=18 December 2013|accessdate=9 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nepal Mandala''' ([[Devanagari]]: नेपाल मण्डल) is an ancient confederation on the [[Indian subcontinent]], marked by cultural, religious and political boundaries which lies in present-day central [[Nepal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Prajapati|first=Subhash Ram|editor-first=Subhash Ram |editor-last=Prajapati |title=The Masked Dances of Nepal Mandal|publisher=Thimi: Madhyapur Art Council|year=2006|chapter=Nepal Mandal|isbn=99946-707-0-0}} Pages 9-11.&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of the [[Kathmandu Valley]] and surrounding areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= Dhungel|first=Ramesh K. |title= Anguished Cry of a Defeated Ruler: A Raga Song Composed by Ranajit Malla |url= https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:i102tgni8nYJ:himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/journals/contributions/pdf/CNAS_34_01_07.pdf+cry+of+an+anguished+ruler&amp;hl=en&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESjrQkDc0dQoGNZbIJTVIzhlZSg-C9ZbEuvvuDLK2R78Qaiy3utDzrEILgumdmKQLmYhxIn-DOmbYmrgH0_NAkHp9XLjjn8DrTplTax_CJnhfv2yphDqW1hTmJiFGOfSMFA69Nqg&amp;sig=AHIEtbRx36zDXqiVOmhoA2LyxHrn2cc1YA |accessdate=22 February 2013|newspaper= Contributions to Nepalese Studies |date= January 2007}} Pages 95-102.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Slusser, Mary (1982). ''Nepal Mandala: A Cultural Study of the Kathmandu Valley.'' Princeton University. {{ISBN|978-0-691-03128-6}}. Page vii.&lt;/ref&gt; The rule of the indigenous [[Newar]]s in Nepal Mandala ended with its conquest by the [[Gorkha Kingdom]] and the rise of the [[Shah dynasty]] in 1768.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Pundits: British Exploration Of Tibet And Central Asia |first= Derek J.|last= Waller |publisher= University Press of Kentucky |location= |year= 2004|isbn=9780813191003|pages= |page=171 |accessdate= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Outline History of Nepal, Nepal consisted of three kingdoms during the early medieval period: [[Khas]] in the west, Karnatak in the south and Nepal Mandala in the center and Kirat in the east.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | url = http://www.hseb.edu.np/content/docs/teachingmannualhistoryxi.pdf| title = Outline History of Nepal| work = | publisher =Higher Secondary Education Board| date=| accessdate = 5 April 2012}} Page 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bhaktapur]] was the capital of Nepal Mandala until the 15th century when three capitals, including [[Kathmandu]] and [[Patan, Nepal|Lalitpur]], were established.&lt;ref&gt;Michael, Thomas and Cuhaj, George (2009). ''Standard Catalog of World Gold Coins.'' Krause Publications. {{ISBN|9781440204241}}. Page 1062.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural area==

The extent of Nepal Mandala has been traditionally defined by the locations of 64 [[Hindu]] and 24 [[Buddhist]] pilgrimage sites. The Hindu shrines consist of 64 Shiva [[linga]]s scattered from Brahmeswar in [[Nuwakot, Bagmati|Nuwakot]] district in the west to Bhimeswar in [[Dolakha District]] in the east.

The 24 Buddhist pilgrimage sites are spread from the [[Trishuli River]] in the west to Dolalghat in the east. When seen as an ordered pattern, they form the picture of the [[mandala]] of [[Chakrasamvara]], the principal deity of [[Vajrayana]] Buddhism. Nepal Mandala was conceived on the basis of the Chakrasamvara Mandala.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Vajracharya| first = Naresh Man| authorlink = | coauthors = | url = http://www.aioiyama.net/lrc/papers/cbhnm-ppr-4.htm| title = Buddhism in Nepal and Nepal Mandala| work = | publisher =| date=| accessdate = 2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Francis Buchanan-Hamilton]] has written in ''An Account of the Kingdom Of Nepal'' published in 1819 that four pilgrimage spots marked the boundaries of Nepal Proper: Nilkantha (an eight-day journey north from Kathmandu), Nateswar (three days to the south), Kaleswar (two days to the west) and Bhimeswar (four days to the east).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hamilton| first = Francis Buchanan | authorlink = | coauthors = | url = http://www.gutenberg.org/files/30364/30364-h/30364-h.htm#page251| title = An Account of the Kingdom Of Nepal and of the Territories Annexed to This Dominion by the House of Gorkha| work = | publisher = Edinburgh: Longman| year=1819| accessdate = 4 June 2012}} Page 192.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political area==

The term mandala also means a country,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Subedi | first = Abhi | authorlink = | coauthors = | url = http://www.mtnforum.org/sites/default/files/pub/6724.pdf| title = Travel as Theatre in Nepal Mandala | work = Contributions to Nepalese Studies| publisher = | date= January 2002| accessdate = 16 April 2012}} Page 173.&lt;/ref&gt; and it has been used to represent traditional political formations such as federation of kingdoms. The area comprising Kathmandu, [[Lalitpur District, Nepal|Lalitpur]], [[Bhaktapur]] and Dolakha during the [[Malla (Nepal)|Malla]] period is generally known as Nepal Mandala.

According to the Outline History of Nepal, Nepal Mandala was situated between the Khas and Simraungarh kingdoms. The [[Khas]] kingdom extended from [[Garhwal Kingdom|Garhwal]] in the west to the [[Trishuli River]] in the east, and from [[Lake Manasarovar]] in the north to the [[Terai]] in the south. Karnataka, also called Simraungarh, was situated in the Terai.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | url = http://www.hseb.edu.np/content/docs/teachingmannualhistoryxi.pdf| title = Outline History of Nepal| work = | publisher =Higher Secondary Education Board| date=| accessdate = 6 April 2012}} Page 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Western travelers in the late 18th century have written that Nepal's borders extended to [[Tibet]] in the north, the nation of the [[Kirata]] in the east, the kingdom of Makwanpur in the south&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Giuseppe| first = Father| authorlink = | coauthors = | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=vSsoAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA307&amp;cad=4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false| title = Account of the Kingdom of Nepal| work = Asiatick Researches| publisher = London: Vernor and Hood| year=1799| accessdate = 9 March 2012}} Page 308.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Trishuli River in the west which separated it from the kingdom of Gorkha.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kirkpatrick| first = Colonel| authorlink = | coauthors = | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ijxAAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false| title = An Account of the Kingdom of Nepaul| work = | publisher = London: William Miller| year=1811| accessdate = 9 March 2012}} Page 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1661, Jesuit Fathers [[Johann Grueber]] and [[Albert d'Orville]] travelled from Tibet to India through Nepal. They mentioned in their report that they passed through "Cuthi", the first town in the kingdom of "Necbal" (Nepal), and arrived in "Cadmendu" (Kathmandu), the capital of "Necbal". From "Cadmendu", a journey of five days brings one to "Hedouda", a market town in the kingdom of "Maranga".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Levi| first = Sylvain| authorlink = | coauthors = | url = https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:C8hQgCDo-QUJ:himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/journals/ancientnepal/pdf/ancient_nepal_25_05.pdf+kuti+necbal&amp;hl=en&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESi1sCufbZ0miDrM87qYQinPM-tdnLbKdy_9dVkkHEDDtBrFP0WMe5YCb8ugsjinxRuW5wg8jKoxs34VWa0NrMQE-EIVTF4XkqE_fBaCIaehWaSTSd667Yba6th7UQufXvovZL_H&amp;sig=AHIEtbSJJa1YFxA2dpP--Pxsz3HtiKVAQA| title = Nepal| work = | publisher = | year=| accessdate = 14 March 2012}} Page 50.&lt;/ref&gt; The town of Hedouda is known as [[Hetauda]] today.

==The inhabitants==

The oldest inhabitants of Nepal Mandala are the Newars who are of multiple racial strains that combined over millennia. Newar civilization is a blend of different cultures that came together in Nepal Mandala.&lt;ref&gt;Tamot, Kashinath (2006). ''Nepal Mandala.'' Lalitpur: Nepal Mandala Research Guthi. {{ISBN|99946-987-5-3}}. Page 11.&lt;/ref&gt; According to sociologists, the people of Nepal gradually became known as Newar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Fatalism and Development: Nepal's Struggle for Modernization |first= Dor Bahadur |last= Bista |publisher= Orient Blackswan |location= |year= 1991|isbn=9788125001881|pages= |page=40 |accessdate=24 August 2013 |url= https://books.google.com.np/books?id=JzFROpFVYRAC&amp;dq=nepal+newar+dor+bahadur+bista&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The Buddhist text ''Manjushrimula Kalpa'' has mentioned Manadeva (reigned 464-506 AD) as being the king of Nepal Mandala. The term Nepal Mandala also appears in the popular Buddhist text ''[[Swayambhu Purana]]''. It occurs in a stone inscription at Gyaneswar, Kathmandu dating from the eighth century during the reign of [[Licchavi (kingdom)|Licchavi]] king Jayadeva II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shrestha|first=Rajendra|title=Various Communities of Historical Nepal Mandala and Newa: Autonomous State|url=|accessdate=|newspaper=Jheegu Swanigah (Special Issue)|date=7 November 2010}} Page 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term Nepal Mandala has been used through the centuries in stone and copper inscriptions and the colophons of manuscripts when mentioning the dedicator's address. It is also referred to during important Buddhist ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;Gutschow, Niels (1997). "The Kathmandu Valley, Nepal Mandala: Definition of time and space" in ''The Nepalese caitya: 1500 years of Buddhist votive architecture in the Kathmandu Valley.''

'''New Suburbanism''' is an [[urban design]] movement which intends to improve on existing [[Suburb|suburban]] or [[exurban]] designs.&lt;ref name="The New Suburbanism: A Realist's Guide to the American Future"&gt;[http://www.southbaycities.org/files/12.05%20Kotkin%20New%20Suburbanism%20Report.pdf ]{{dead link|date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Suburbanists seek to establish an alternative between a dichotomy of the centripedal city and centrifugal suburb,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/23290105?uid=3739256&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21101999752763|title=The Emerging 'Silicon Savanna': From Old Urbanism to New Suburbanism|author=STEPHEN MARSHALL|date=1978|volume=32|pages=267–280|publisher=Alexandrine Press|accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; by features such as rear-loading garages and walking-focused landscaping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barternews.com/new_suburbanism_growing_in_southern_california.htm |title=New Suburbanism Growing In Southern California |publisher=Barternews.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The design strategy for New Suburbanism differs from the traditional postwar suburban development. In contrast to post-war suburbanism where the homebuyer had few options in regards to [[Personalization|customization]], new suburban communities feature customization through packages and add-ons as well as larger homes in denser communities. Postwar suburban developments have since filled in with homes and businesses began emerging there, outside of the city-center. This created new communities, not just suburban housing.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lewis|first=Paul and Marc Tsurumaki, David J. Lewis.|date=2003|title=New Suburbanism|url=http://newprairiepress.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1384&amp;context=oz|journal=Oz|volume=25|pages=34–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Suburban sprawl]] is associated with negative effects because it often takes over farm land, disrupts ecosystems, has low-density housing, and car-dependent communities. Suburban sprawl continues to grow as over 70% of Americans choose to live in such communities.&lt;ref&gt;Fannie-Mae-Foundation. ''Downtown housing as an urban redevelopment tool: hope or hype (panel discussion).'' Housing Policy Debate, 10 (1997), pp. 477–505. Retrieved: 3 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Planners are currently seeking to make the suburbs more [[Sustainability|sustainable]] and New Suburbanism offers a solution. This planning approach seeks to redesign suburban communities by making them more-dense, equitable, and environmentally sustainable while still keeping housing and design preferences of the consumer in mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Atkninson-Palombo|first=Carol|date=2010|title=New housing construction in Phoenix: Evidence of "new suburbanism"?|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264275109001073|journal=Cities|volume=27|pages=77–86|doi=10.1016/j.cities.2009.10.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Locations==
*Plum Creek in [[Kyle, Texas]]

==Comparison to New Urbanism==
[[New Urbanism]] is a style of planning a new neighborhood that focuses on designing aspects that create more [[community engagement]], whereas New Suburbanism is the improving of an existing suburban neighborhood.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

New urbanism, though a small movement, is more successful than New Suburbanism, as NS only has 1 location and NU has hundreds.

'''Nikolai Mikhaylovich Albov''' ({{lang-ru|Николай Михайлович Альбов}}, 15 October 1866, Pavlovo, Gorbatov region, [[Nizhny Novgorod Governorate]], [[Imperial Russia]], — 6 December 1897, [[La Plata]], [[Argentina]]) was a [[Imperial Russia|Russian]] [[botanist]] and [[geographer]]. He made his mark first as an explorer of the [[Caucasus]], to which he made several extensive trips financed by the Swiss Botanist Society, and later, after having moved to [[Argentina]] in 1895, of the Southern regions of South America. He is credited with being arguably the first European explorer to have traveled extensively over [[Patagonia]] and [[Tierra del Fuego]] and (writing in Russian and French), described its flora.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ashipunov.info/shipunov/school/books/lipshits1947_russkie_botaniki_1.djvu Альбов, Николай Михайлович].

Pago Pago Harbor is surrounded and sheltered by mountains such as Mount Alava, [[Mount Matafao]] and [[Rainmaker Mountain]] (Mount Pioa).&lt;ref&gt;http://americansamoaport.as.gov/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tsunami==
[[Fagatogo]] was struck by a [[tsunami]] on 29 September 2009, causing damage and [[rock slide]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gcQYRcaxXR6t5UcX_WlbD_qBAmQwD9B16T6G0]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091003024511/https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gcQYRcaxXR6t5UcX_WlbD_qBAmQwD9B16T6G0 |date=October 3, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A significant amount of [[debris]] and [[oil]] were dumped into Pago Pago Harbor during the [[2009 Samoa earthquake and tsunami]], which devastated communities along the harbor's coastline, including [[Pago Pago]].&lt;ref name=samoanews&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title=Coral Reef Advisory tsunami report focuses on extensive marine and coastal debris |url=http://www.samoanews.com/viewstory.php?storyid=9718&amp;edition=1254909600 |work=[[Samoa News]]|publisher=|date=2009-10-07 |accessdate=2009-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Debris including cars, household items, and boats were thrown into the harbor by the force of the wave.&lt;ref name=samoanews/&gt;  According to the 14-page American Samoan government report, ''Post-Tsunami Coastal Resource Damage Assessment'', "The inner section of Pago Pago Harbor is severely [[polluted]] and will require an extensive cleanup program with a significant amount of manpower ... The destruction is everywhere."&lt;ref name=samoanews/&gt;

An [[oil spill]] approximately 40 feet wide occurred at the mouth of Pago Pago Harbor as a result of the tsunami.&lt;ref name=samoanews/&gt;  Barrels containing fuel were thrown into the harbor by the tsunami and washed up on shore.&lt;ref name=samoanews/&gt;

It is suggested that one must avoid eating any fish or invertebrate caught in Pago Pago Harbor because they are contaminated with heavy metals and other pollutants.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Population density''' (in [[agriculture]]: [[Stock (disambiguation)|standing stock]] and [[standing crop]]) is a measurement of [[population]] per unit area or unit volume; it is a quantity of type [[number density]]. It is frequently applied to [[living organisms]], and most of the time to [[human]]s. It is a key geographical term.&lt;ref name=about&gt;Matt Rosenberg [http://geography.about.com/od/populationgeography/a/popdensity.htm Population Density]. Geography.about.com. March 2, 2011. Retrieved on December 10, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In simple terms population density refers to the number of people living in an area per kilometer square.

== Biological population densities ==
Population density is population divided by total land area or water volume, as appropriate.&lt;ref name=about/&gt;

Low densities may cause an [[extinction vortex]] and lead to further reduced fertility. This is called the [[Allee effect]] after the scientist who identified it. Examples of the causes in low population densities include:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eoearth.org/article/Minimum_viable_population_size Minimum viable population size]. Eoearth.org (March 6, 2010). Retrieved on December 10, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|List of countries and territories by population density}}
For [[human]]s, population density is the number of people per unit of area, usually quoted per square kilometer or square mile (which may include or exclude, for example, areas of water or glaciers). Commonly this may be calculated for a [[county]], [[list of cities by population density|city]], [[country]], another [[territory (country subdivision)|territory]] or the [[Earth|entire world]].

The [[world's population]] is around 7,500,000,000&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.census.gov/main/www/popclock.html U.S. &amp; World Population Clocks]. Census.gov. Retrieved on December 10, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Earth]]'s total area (including land and water) is 510,000,000 square kilometers (197,000,000 sq. mi.).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/xx.html World]. CIA World Handbook&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the worldwide human population density is around 7,500,000,000 ÷ 510,000,000 = 14.7 per km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (38 per sq. mi). If only the Earth's land area of 150,000,000  km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (58,000,000 sq. mi.) is taken into account, then human population density is 50 per km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (129 per sq. mile). This includes all continental and island land area, including [[Antarctica]]. If Antarctica is also excluded, then population density rises to over 55 people per km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (over 142 per sq. mile).&lt;ref name=about/&gt; However, over half{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} of the Earth's land mass consists of areas inhospitable to human habitation, such as deserts and high mountains, and population tends to cluster around seaports and fresh-water sources. Thus, this number by itself does not give any helpful measurement of human population density.

Several of the most densely populated territories in the world are [[city-state]]s, [[microstate]]s and [[Dependent territory|dependencies]].&lt;ref name=unpop&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/wpp2008/wpp2008_text_tables.pdf | title=World Population Prospects, Table A.1| version=2008 revision | format=PDF | publisher=United Nations | author=Department of Economic and Social Affairs Population Division | year=2009 | accessdate= March 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Monaco government uses a smaller surface area figure resulting in a population density of 18,078 per km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; These territories have a relatively small area and a high [[urbanization]] level, with an economically specialized [[city]] population drawing also on rural resources outside the area, illustrating the difference between high population density and [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]]

The potential to maintain the agricultural aspects of deserts is extremely limited as there is not enough precipitation to support a sustainable land. The population in these areas are extremely low. Therefore cities in the Middle East, such as Dubai, have been increasing in population and infrastructure growth at a fast pace. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/41320143|title=Desert regions : population, migration, and environment|last=1923-2009.|first=Portnov, B. A. (Boris Adolʹfovich) Hare, A. Paul (Alexander Paul),|date=1999|publisher=Springer|year=|isbn=3540657800|location=|pages=|oclc=41320143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cities with high population densities are, by some, considered to be overpopulated, though this will depend on factors like quality of housing and infrastructure and access to resources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalissues.org/issue/198/human-population Human Population]. Global Issues. Retrieved on December 10, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the most densely populated cities are in [[Southeast Asia]], though [[Cairo]] and [[Lagos]] in [[Africa]] also fall into this category.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.citymayors.com/statistics/largest-cities-density-125.html The largest cities in the world by land area, population and density]. Citymayors.com. Retrieved on December 10, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

City population and especially area are, however, heavily dependent on the definition of "urban area" used: densities are almost invariably higher for the central city area than when suburban settlements and the intervening rural areas are included, as in the areas of [[urban agglomeration|agglomeration]] or [[metropolitan area]], the latter sometimes including neighboring cities. For instance, [[Milwaukee]] has a greater population density when just the inner city is measured, and the surrounding suburbs excluded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wisconline.com/greenmap/milwaukee/population.html The Population of Milwaukee County]. Wisconline.com. Retrieved on December 10, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In comparison, based on a world population of seven billion, the world's inhabitants, as a loose crowd taking up ten square feet (one square metre) per person ([[Jacobs Method]]), would occupy a space a little larger than [[Delaware]]'s land area.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

=== Other methods of measurement ===

Although arithmetic density is the most common way of measuring population density, several other methods have been developed to provide a more accurate measure of population density over a specific area.
* '''Arithmetic density''': The total number of people / area of land (measured in square miles or square kilometers)
* '''[[Physiological density]]''': The total population / area of [[arable land]]
* '''Agricultural density''': The total ''rural'' population / area of [[arable land]]
* '''Residential density''': The number of people living in an urban area / area of residential land
* '''[[Urban density]]''': The number of people inhabiting an urban area / total area of urban land
* '''Ecological optimum''': The density of population that can be supported by the natural resources

[[ZIMS]] project was a large global collaboration with 600 people contributing under the leadership of [[Hassan Syed]], CIO of Species360 (2003-2010)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://myemail.constantcontact.com/ISIS-Newsletter.html?soid=1104174981805&amp;aid=8B6O6fKGs2I|title=ISIS Newsletter|website=myemail.constantcontact.com|access-date=2018-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The ZIMS database contains information on 21,000 species, 6.8 million animals, and 75 million medical records. It also includes.&lt;ref name="factsheet" /&gt; Members use the basic biologic information (age, sex, parentage, place of birth, circumstance of death, etc.) collected in the system to care for and manage their animal collections (including demographic and genetic management in many cases). It is also used for ex situ breeding programs and supporting conservation research and programs. 

Since its founding in 1973, the group has been a Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) pursuing wild animal conservation goals. Species360 works in partnership with zoo associations around the world.

Species360 and the [[Central Zoo Authority of India]] (CZA) have a five-year memorandum of understanding with a primary goal of migrating the majority of the zoos in India into the ZIMS database.

The organization has staff and representatives in [[Amsterdam]] (the Netherlands), [[New Delhi]] (India), [[Jerusalem]] (Israel), [[Odense]] (Denmark), and [[Istanbul]] (Turkey) with headquarters in [[Minnesota]] (USA).

==Centralized database==
Modern zoos and aquariums often are "gene banks" for [[endangered species]]. In some cases, species which have become extinct in the wild and have been bred in zoos are eventually returned to the wild. Examples include the [[black-footed ferret]], [[California condor]], [[Przewalski's horse]], [[red wolf]], [[Micronesian kingfisher]] (not yet reintroduced), and the [[Arabian oryx]]. Individual zoos generally do not have the space to maintain a viable species population (which for many mammals and birds requires 500+ animals in order to maintain sufficient genetic diversity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tudge |first=Colin |title=Last Animals at the Zoo: How Mass Extinction Can Be Stopped |publisher=Island Press |location=Washington, DC |year=1992 |isbn=1-55963-158-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;), so maintaining genetic diversity requires coordination between many zoos. Scientific expertise on husbandry, nutrition, veterinary care and so on is spread throughout the zoos and aquaria of the world. Breeding and population management relies on accurate information about animals in all member institutions, especially [[Pedigree (animal)|pedigree]] history (parentage) and [[demography]] (births and deaths).

Species360 records are accepted by international regulatory bodies such as [[CITES]].  Roughly three-quarters of [[Association of Zoos and Aquariums]] (AZA) members in North America are members, and the [[European Association of Zoos and Aquaria]] (EAZA) requires its members to join. The [[World Association of Zoos and Aquariums|World Association of Zoos and Aquaria's]] (WAZA) Conservation Strategy Guidelines strongly recommend that all zoo and aquaria join and participate in data sharing via ZIMS.&lt;ref&gt;WAZA [http://www.waza.org/files/webcontent/1.public_site/5.conservation/conservation_strategies/turning_the_tide/Aquarium%20strategy%20EN.pdf 2009 Conservation Strategy].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Software==
; ZIMS (Zoological Information Management System) for Husbandry: A web-based record-keeping system used by zoos, aquariums and zoological associations to capture and organize husbandry information. also includes best-practices and collaboration opportunities among members.

; ZIMS for Medical: a web-base module used to capture and organize:  A web-based record-keeping system used by zoos, aquariums and zoological associations to capture and organize veterinary information .

; SPARKS: Single Population Analysis &amp; Records Keeping System: supports [[studbook]] management and species analysis, and is for use by studbook keepers.

; EGGS: is egg clutch management software for a single facility, and augments records for egg-laying species in both ARKS4 and SPARKS.

; ZIMS – Zoological Information Management System's, husbandry module and medical module: is the next generation Species360 software. Release 1 was delivered in March 2010 and was updated in 2012 to a greatly improved user interface. Release 1 covers functionality regarding basic inventory of animals, detailed individual animal information, and general institutional information such as staff, enclosure data and life support system design and maintenance.  Release 2 features veterinary medical features currently offered via the MedARKS application. Release 3 will incorporate the SPARKS and Poplink Studbook functionalities.  The ZIMS application is the world’s first and only real-time, unified global database for animals in zoos and aquariums.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.species360.org/about-us/mission-history/ |title=Mission &amp; History |year=2016 |publisher=Species360 |accessdate=2016-10-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

; LearnZIMS – the educational version of ZIMS: is made available for licensing to educational organizations teaching animal husbandry, zoo and aquarium science.  This version of ZIMS mirrors the standard ZIMS application, but does not include the global database of animal records.  LearnZIMS uses a fictitious dataset to teach application functionality and to demonstrate the types of data that are collected in the global database.&lt;ref&gt;[http://training.species360.org/learnzims/ LearnZIMS educational license] of the ZIMS application.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1973,  Ulysses Seal and Dale Makey proposed the ''International Species Information System'' (ISIS) as an international database to help zoos and aquariums accomplish long-term conservation management goals. It was founded in 1974 with an initial membership of 51 zoos in North America and Europe, and its membership has increased every year since.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;  Grants and endorsements were provided by the [[Association of Zoos and Aquariums]] (AZA), the [[American Association of Zoo Veterinarians]] (AAZV) and other zoological associations. The founders also raised development funding from private foundations and the [[United States Department of the Interior]]. For the first 30 years, the [[Minnesota Zoological Garden|Minnesota Zoo]] hosted the program on their grounds.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

Since 1989, the organisation has been incorporated as a non-profit entity under an international Board of Trustees elected by subscribing member institutions.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; In 2016, the organization was renamed as Species360, due to the ISIS being an acronym for the [[Islamic State of Iraq and Syria]], a terrorist organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite website |url=https://www.species360.org/2016/07/whats-in-a-name/ |title=What’s in a name? |date=July 18, 2016 |website=Species360 |accessdate=2017-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sub-prefectures map Côte d'Ivoire.jpg|thumb|left|Sub-prefectures of Ivory Coast. The sub-prefecture boundaries are dotted lines. The green dots indicate the location of the settlement that is the seat of each sub-prefecture. The grey zones are areas of the country not governed by sub-prefectures.]]
'''Sub-prefectures of Ivory Coast ''' ({{lang-fr|sous-préfectures de Côte d'Ivoire}}) are the fourth-level administrative [[subdivisions of Ivory Coast|subdivisions]] of the country. There are currently 510 sub-prefectures. They were created in 2011, when the administrative subdivisions of Ivory Coast were reorganised.

In Ivory Coast, there are 14 first-level [[Districts of Ivory Coast|districts]] (including two autonomous districts) sub-divided into 31 [[Regions of Ivory Coast|regions]], which are sub-divided into 108 [[Departments of Ivory Coast|departments]] ({{lang-fr|départements}}), which are further sub-divided into 510 sub-prefectures. The sub-prefectures contain more than 8000 villages nationwide. Where needed, multiple villages have been combined into 197 [[Communes of Ivory Coast|communes]]. The two autonomous districts are not divided into regions, but they do contain one or more departments as well as sub-prefectures and communes.

Two areas of the country are not subdivided into sub-prefectures. First, the urban portion the Autonomous District of Abidjan—constituting Abidjan City proper—contains no sub-prefectures, only communes, although the more rural areas of the Autonomous District of Abidjan are divided into sub-prefectures. Second, the portion of the [[Comoé National Park]] that is located in [[Zanzan District]] is not divided into sub-prefectures.

==Organisation==
Each sub-prefecture is headed by a sub-prefect, who is appointed by the council of ministers (cabinet) of the national government.&lt;ref name = loi2014-451&gt;[http://faolex.fao.org/docs/pdf/ivc146379.pdf Loi n° 2014-451 du 05 août 2014 portant orientation de l'organisation générale de l'Administration Territoriale].&lt;/ref&gt; The sub-prefecture implements the programmes passed down by the department and works directly with the mayors and heads of villages to ensure cooperation and standardisation throughout the sub-prefecture.&lt;ref name = loi2014-451/&gt;

==Sub-prefectures by district, region and department==
Below is a list of sub-prefectures organized by district, region and department. Population figures in parentheses are based on the 2014 RGPH census.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geohive.com/cntry/coteivoire_ext.aspx GeoHive - Cote d'Ivoire extended population statistics]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Susan Jane Smith''', MA, DPhil (Oxon), [[Fellow of the British Academy|FBA]], [[Fellow of the Academy of Social Sciences|FAcSS]], [[Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh|FRSE]] is a British [[geographer]] and academic. Since 2009, she has been [[Mistress (college)|Mistress]] of [[Girton College, Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cam.ac.uk/news/girton-elects-new-mistress Girton elects new Mistress] from Cambridge University News and Events, 4 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.varsity.co.uk/archive/693.pdf Varsity issue 693] page 3&lt;/ref&gt;  Smith previously held the [[Ogilvie Chair of Geography]] at the [[University of Edinburgh]] from 1990–2004 and until 2009 was a professor of geography at [[Durham University]], where she played a key role in establishing the [[Institute of Advanced Study (Durham)|Institute of Advanced Study]]. On 1 October 2011, she was conferred the title of Honorary Professor of Social and Economic Geography in the [[Department of Geography, University of Cambridge|Department of Geography]] at the [[University of Cambridge]] for five years,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/reporter/2011-12/weekly/6243/section4.shtml#heading2-9 Cambridge University Reporter Vol cxlii No 8: Notices by the General Board]&lt;/ref&gt; which has since been renewed until 2021.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Honorary Professors|url=http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/reporter/2016-17/special/04/section7.shtml#heading2-16|website=Cambridge University Reporter, Special No.4, 23 December 2016|publisher=University of Cambridge|accessdate=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She studied at [[Oxford University]], reading Geography at [[St Anne's College, Oxford|St Anne's College]] and completing her DPhil at [[Nuffield College]]. She held Research Fellowships at [[St Peter's College, Oxford]], at [[Brunel University]] and at the [[University of Glasgow]]. 

Smith's research is concerned with the challenge of inequality, addressing themes such as residential segregation, housing for health, and fear of crime. Her current work focuses on inequalities in the housing market &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.geog.cam.ac.uk/people/s.smith/|title=Department of Geography, Cambridge » Susan Smith|website=www.geog.cam.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In 2010, Smith gave the [[Tanner Lectures on Human Values]] at Cambridge University with the title "Care-full markets – Miracle or Mirage?" which examined—from a perspective of the [[ethics of care]]—the [[moral economy]] of the housing market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cam.ac.uk/news/the-2010-tanner-lectures|title=The 2010 Tanner Lectures|publisher=Cambridge University|date=3 November 2010|accessdate=5 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her work combines qualitative and quantitative approaches, and she is interested in an array of participatory techniques. In collaboration with Dr. Mia Gray and the Menagerie Theatre Company, Smith has developed a project on 'public choices in times of austerity', an experiment in dramatizing the findings of a study in Interactive Forum Theatre style.

Smith plays [[euphonium]] with the [[City of Cambridge Brass Band]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cambridgeband.co.uk/members.htm|website=City of Cambridge Brass Band|title=Meet the Band|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160324135259/http://www.cambridgeband.co.uk/members.htm|archive-date=2016-03-24|access-date=2016-05-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ghana telephone numbering plan''' is the [[Telephone numbering plan|system used for assigning]] [[telephone numbers]] in [[Ghana]]. It is regulated by the [[National Communications Authority]], which holds responsibility for [[telecommunications]].

Since 1 May 2010, all fixed-line numbers and mobile numbers have 9 national (significant) numbers after the '0' trunk code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vodafone.com.gh/Personal/Fixed-Line/New-Fixed-Line-Numbers.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100721214659/http://www.vodafone.com.gh/Personal/Fixed-Line/New-Fixed-Line-Numbers.aspx |archivedate=2010-07-21 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Mobile numbering plan==
Due to the unreliability of fixed-line infrastructure in Ghana, mobile phones are more widely used.  Competition among the various mobile carriers has spurred growth with a subscriber penetration rate of 98% in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200903180804.html|title=Ghana: Mobile Phone Subscription Hits 98 Percent Market Penetration|last=Dowuona|first=Samuel|date=2009-03-18|work=Ghanaian Chronicle (Accra)|access-date=2018-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The poor call quality of mobile phones, however, means that more people hold more than one mobile phone, usually with two or more different carriers.

The various mobile carriers in Ghana have each been assigned a network code.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4739">'''Walter Christaller''' (April 21, 1893 &amp;ndash; March 9, 1969), was a [[Germany|German]] [[geographer]] whose principal contribution to the discipline is [[Central Place Theory]],&lt;ref&gt;Christaller, Walter (1933): ''Die zentralen Orte in Süddeutschland''. Gustav Fischer, Jena.&lt;/ref&gt; first published in 1933. This groundbreaking theory was the foundation of the study of cities as systems of cities, rather than simple hierarchies or single entities.

==Life==
Walter Christaller was born to Erdmann Gottreich and [[Helene Christaller]], an author of Christian-themed children's novels at Berneck (today part of [[Altensteig]] in [[Germany]]. His paternal grandfather [[Johann Gottlieb Christaller]] was a [[linguist]] and a [[Christian missionary]] in [[West Africa]].&lt;ref name="nndb"&gt;{{cite web|title=Walter Christaller|url=http://www.nndb.com/people/546/000180006/|publisher=NNDB|accessdate=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grunsky F. [https://www.ecse.rpi.edu/~schubert/Christaller/Literatur--Erdmann-Gottreich-Christaller--Biographien.pdf Nachruf auf Erdmann Gottreich Christaller], 1922.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before 1914, Christaller began studies in philosophy and political economics and subsequently served in the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]] during [[World War I]]. He was [[Homeschooling|homeschooled]] and educated at the [[University of Heidelberg|Universities of Heidelberg]] and [[University of Munich|Munich]]. In the 1920s, he pursued a variety of occupations. In 1929, he resumed graduate studies, which led to his famous dissertation on Central Place Theory, which he published as the ''Die zentralen Orte in Süddeutschland'' (The Central Places in [[Southern Germany]]), in 1933.&lt;ref name="nndb" /&gt;

In the late 1930s, he held a short-lived academic appointment at the University of Freiburg-in-Breisgau. He was never a Nazi and was even noticed for some brawls with Nazi students.&lt;ref&gt;Bunge W (1977) “Walter Christaller was not a Fascist”, ''Ontario Geography'', p.80 sqq.  ; Hottes R (1982) “W Christaller : ein Überblick über Leben und Werk.” ''Geographisches Taschenbuch'', Wiesbaden pp 59-69.&lt;/ref&gt; He moved into government service, for [[Himmler]]'s SS-Planning and Soil Office, during the [[Second World War]]. Christaller's task was to draw up plans for reconfiguring the economic geography of Germany's eastern conquests ([[Generalplan Ost]]), primarily in Czechoslovakia and Poland but also, if successful, Russia itself. Christaller was given special charge of planning occupied Poland, and he did so by using his central place theory as an explicit guide.
&lt;ref&gt;Rössler, Mechtild (1989): Applied geography and area research in Nazi society: central place
theory and planning, 1933-1945. ''Environment and Planning D: Society and Space 7'', 419-431; Trevor Barnes &amp; Claudio Minca (2013), ''Nazi Spatial Theory: The Dark Geographies of Carl Schmitt and Walter Christaller''. Annals of the Association of American Geographers 103 (3), 669–687. ; - Fahlbusch, M, M Rössler und D Siegrist (1989) “Geographie und Nazionalsozialismus”, ''Urbs et Regio, 51, kasseler Schriften zur Geographie u. Plannung.'' ; - Marchand B (1999) “Nazionalsozialismus und Grossstadtfeindschaft”, ''Die Alte Stadt'', 1/99, S39-50. ; - Müller R-D (1991)''Hitlers Ostkrieg und die deutsche Siedlungspolitik'', Fischer Vlg, Frankfurt am Main. ; - Wasser B (1993) ''Himmlers Raumplanung im Osten, Der Generalplan Ost in Polen'', Birkhaüser Verlag, Basel, Schweiz, 347 S.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, he joined the [[Communist Party of Germany]] and became politically active. In addition, he devoted himself to the [[tourism geography|geography of tourism]]. Since 1950, his Central Place Theory has been used to restructure municipal relationships and boundaries in the [[Federal Republic of Germany]], and the system is still in place today.

In 1950, Christaller, together with Paul Gauss and Emil Meynen, founded the German Association of Applied Geography (DVAG).&lt;ref&gt;Wardenga, Ute / Henniges, Norman / Brogiato, Heinz Peter und Schelhaas, Bruno: ''Der Verband deutscher Berufsgeographen. Eine sozialgeschichtliche Studie zur Frühphase des DVAG''. (= forum ifl 16), Leipzig 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Walter Christaller Award for Applied Geography is named after him.&lt;ref name="nndb" /&gt; 

He died in [[Jugenheim]], Germany on March 9, 1969.&lt;ref name="nndb" /&gt;
