      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17242">'''Aftertaste''' is the [[taste]] intensity of a [[food]] or [[Drink|beverage]] that is perceived immediately after that food or beverage is removed from the mouth.&lt;ref name="neely"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Neely|first1=G.|last2=Borg|first2=G.|title=The Perceived Intensity of Caffeine Aftertaste: Tasters Versus Nontasters|journal=Chemical Senses|date=1999|volume=24|issue=1|pages=19–21|doi=10.1093/chemse/24.1.19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aftertastes of different foods and beverages can vary by intensity and over time, but the unifying feature of aftertaste is that it is perceived ''after'' a food or beverage is either swallowed or spat out. The [[Neuroscience|neurobiological]] mechanisms of taste (and aftertaste) [[signal transduction]] from the taste receptors in the mouth to the brain have not yet been fully understood. However, the primary taste processing area located in the [[insular cortex|insula]] has been observed to be involved in aftertaste perception.&lt;ref name ="james"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=James|first1=G. A.|last2=Li|first2=X.|last3=DuBois|first3=G. E.|last4=Zhou|first4=L.|last5=Hu|first5=X. P.|title=Prolonged insula activation during perception of aftertaste|journal=NeuroReport|date=2009|volume=20|issue=3|pages=245–250|doi=10.1097/WNR.0b013e32831d2441}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Temporal taste perception==
Characteristics of a food's aftertaste are quality, intensity, and duration.&lt;ref name="neely" /&gt; Quality describes the actual taste of a food and intensity conveys the magnitude of that taste. Duration describes how long a food's aftertaste sensation lasts. Foods that have lingering aftertastes typically have long sensation durations.

Because taste perception is unique to every person, descriptors for taste quality and intensity have been standardized, particularly for use in scientific studies.&lt;ref name = "just"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Just|first1=T.|last2=Pau|first2=H. W.|last3=Engel|first3=U.|last4=Hummel|first4=T.|title=Cephalic phase insulin release in healthy humans after taste stimulation?|journal=Appetite|date=2008|volume=51|issue=3|pages=622–627|doi=10.1016/j.appet.2008.04.271}}&lt;/ref&gt; For taste quality, foods can be described by the commonly used terms "sweet", "sour", "salty", "bitter", "umami", or "no taste". Description of aftertaste perception relies heavily upon the use of these words to convey the taste that is being sensed after a food has been removed from the mouth.

The description of taste intensity is also subject to variability among individuals. Variations of the [[Borg scale|Borg Category Ratio Scale]] or other similar metrics are often used to assess the intensities of foods.&lt;ref name="neely" /&gt;&lt;ref name="just" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Valentová|first1=H.|last2=Skrovánková|first2=S.|last3=Panovská|first3=Z.|last4=Pokorný|first4=J.|title=Time–intensity studies of astringent taste|journal=Food Chemistry|date=2002|volume=78|issue=1|pages=29–37|doi=10.1016/S0308-8146(01)00330-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scales typically have categories that range from either zero or one through ten (or sometimes beyond ten) that describe the taste intensity of a food. A score of zero or one would correspond to unnoticeable or weak taste intensities, while a higher score would correspond to moderate or strong taste intensities. It is the prolonged moderate or strong taste intensities that persist even after a food is no longer present in the mouth that describe aftertaste sensation.

Foods that have distinct aftertastes are distinguished by their temporal profiles, or how long their tastes are perceived during and after consumption. A sample testing procedure to measure a food's temporal profile would entail first recording the time of onset for initial taste perception when the food is consumed, and then recording the time at which there is no longer any perceived taste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=DuBois|first1=G. E.|last2=Lee|first2=J. F.|title=A simple technique for the evaluation of temporal taste properties|journal=Chemical Senses|date=1983|volume=7|issue=3–4|pages=237–247|doi=10.1093/chemse/7.3-4.237}}&lt;/ref&gt; The difference between these two values yields the total time of taste perception. Match this with intensity assessments over the same time interval and a representation of the food's taste intensity over time can be obtained. With respect to aftertaste, this type of testing would have to measure the onset of taste perception from the point after which the food was removed from the mouth.

===Variability of human taste perception===
The categorization of people into "[[Supertaster|tasters]]" or "nontasters" based on their sensitivity to the bitterness of [[propylthiouracil]] and the expression of [[fungiform papillae]] on their tongues has suggested that the variations from person-to-person observed in taste perception are genetically based.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Duffy|first1=V. B.|last2=Davidson|first2=A. C.|last3=Kidd|first3=J. R.|last4=Kidd|first4=K. K.|last5=Speed|first5=W. C.|last6=Pakstis|first6=A. J.|last7=Reed|first7=D. R.|last8=Snyder|first8=D. J.|last9=Bartoshuk|first9=L. M.|title=Bitter Receptor Gene (''TAS2R38''), 6-''n''-Propylthiouracil (PROP) Bitterness and Alcohol Intake|journal=Alcoholism: Clinical &amp; Experimental Research|date=2004|volume=28|issue=11|pages=1629–1637|doi=10.1097/01.ALC.0000145789.55183.D4|pmc=1397913}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt; If so, then sensations of aftertaste could also be affected by the activities of specific genes that affect an individual's perception of different foods. For example, the intensity of the aftertaste sensations "nontasters" experienced after caffeine consumption was found to diminish faster than the sensations "tasters" experienced.&lt;ref name="neely" /&gt; This may imply that because of their taste bud profiles, "tasters" may be more sensitive to the tastes of different foods, and thus experience a more persistent sensation of those foods' tastes.

==Taste receptor dynamics==
Because a lingering taste sensation is intrinsic to aftertaste, the molecular mechanisms that underlie aftertaste are presumed to be linked to either the continued or delayed activation of receptors and signaling pathways in the mouth that are involved in taste processing. The current understanding of how a food's taste is communicated to the brain is as follows:&lt;ref name ="reed" &gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reed|first1=D. R.|last2=Tanaka|first2=T.|last3=McDaniel|first3=A. H.|title=Diverse tastes: Genetics of sweet and bitter perception|journal=Physiology &amp; Behavior|date=2006|volume=88|issue=3|pages=215–226|doi=10.1016/j.physbeh.2006.05.033|pmc=1698869}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Chemicals in food interact with receptors on the [[taste receptor|taste receptor cells]] located on the tongue and the roof of the mouth. These interactions can be affected by temporal and spatial factors like the time of receptor activation or the particular taste receptors that are activated (sweet, salty, bitter, etc.).
# The [[chorda tympani]] (cranial nerve VII), the [[glossopharyngeal nerve]] (cranial nerve IX), and the [[vagus nerve]] (cranial nerve X) carry information from the taste receptors to the brain for cortical processing.

In the context of aftertaste, the combination of both receptor-dependent and receptor-independent processes have been proposed to explain the signal transduction mechanisms for foods with distinct aftertastes, particularly those that are bitter.&lt;ref name="peri"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peri|first1=I.|last2=Mamrud-Brains|first2=H.|last3=Rodin|first3=S.|last4=Krizhanovsky|first4=V.|last5=Shai|first5=Y.|last6=Nir|first6=S.|last7=Naim|first7=M.|title=Rapid entry of bitter and sweet tastants into liposomes and taste cells: implications for signal transduction.|journal=American Journal of Physiology. Cell Physiology|date=2000|volume=278|issue=1|pages=C17–25|pmid=10644507|doi=10.1152/ajpcell.2000.278.1.c17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The receptor-dependent process is the same as what was described above. However, the receptor-independent process involves the diffusion of bitter, [[Amphiphile|amphiphilic]] chemicals like [[quinine]] across the taste receptor cell membranes. Once inside the taste receptor cell, these compounds have been observed to activate intracellular [[G protein|G-proteins]] and other proteins that are involved in signaling pathways routed to the brain.&lt;ref name="peri" /&gt; The bitter compounds thus activate both the taste receptors on the cell surface, as well as the signaling pathway proteins in the intracellular space. Intracellular signaling may be slower than taste cell receptor activation since more time is necessary for the bitter compounds to diffuse across the cell membrane and interact with intracellular proteins. This delayed activation of intracellular signaling proteins in response to the bitter compounds, in addition to the extracellular receptor signaling is proposed to be related to the lingering aftertaste associated with bitter foods.&lt;ref&gt;Naim M, Nir S, Spielman AI, Noble AC, Peri I, et al. Hypothesis of receptordependent and receptor-independent mechanisms for bitter and sweet taste transduction: implications for slow taste onset and lingering aftertaste. In: Given P, Parades D, editors. Chemistry of Taste: Mechanisms, Behaviors, and Mimics ACS Symposium Series. Vol. 825. Washington, DC: Am. Chem. Soc; 2002. pp. 2–17.&lt;/ref&gt; The combination of both mechanisms leads to an overall longer response of the taste receptor cells to the bitter foods, and aftertaste perception subsequently occurs.

==Processing in the cerebral cortex==
The primary taste perception areas in the cerebral cortex are located in the insula and regions of the [[Postcentral gyrus|somatosensory cortex]]; the [[nucleus of the solitary tract]] located in the brainstem also plays a major role in taste perception.&lt;ref name ="reed" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shepherd|first1=G. M.|title=Smell images and the flavour system in the human brain|journal=Nature|date=2006|volume=444|issue=7117|pages=316–321|doi=10.1038/nature05405}}&lt;/ref&gt; These regions were identified when human subjects were exposed to a taste stimulus and their cerebral blood flow measured with [[magnetic resonance imaging]]. Although these regions have been identified as the primary zones for taste processing in the brain, other cortical areas are also activated during eating, as other sensory inputs are being signaled to the cortex.

For aftertaste, much is unclear about the cortical processing related to its perception. The first neuroimaging study to evaluate the temporal taste profile of [[aspartame]], an artificial sweetener, in humans was published in 2009.&lt;ref name ="james" /&gt; In it, the insula was observed to be activated for a longer period of time than other sensory processing areas in the brain when the aftertaste profile of aspartame was measured. Subjects were administered a solution of aspartame for a specific amount of time before being instructed to swallow the solution. Functional magnetic resonance images of the blood flow in the subjects' brains were recorded before and after they swallowed the aspartame solution. Before swallowing, the [[amygdala]], somatosensory cortex, [[thalamus]], and [[basal ganglia]] were all activated. After swallowing, only the insula remained activated and the response of the other brain regions was not evident. This suggests that the insula may be a primary region for aftertaste sensation because it was activated even after the aspartame solution was no longer present in the mouth. This finding aligns with the insula's identification as a central taste processing area and simply expands its function. An explanation for less activation of the amygdala was that because it is a reward center in the brain, less reward would be experienced by the subjects during prolonged exposure to the aspartame solution.

==Distinguishing aftertaste and flavor==
[[Flavor]] is an emergent property that is the combination of multiple sensory systems including [[olfaction]], taste, and [[Somatosensory system|somatosensation]].&lt;ref name="stevenson"&gt;Stevenson, R.J. (2009). The psychology of flavour. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; How the flavor of a food is perceived, whether it is unpleasant or satisfying, is stored as a memory so that the next time the same (or a similar) food is encountered, the previous experience can be recalled and a decision made to consume that food. This process of multisensory inputs to the brain during eating, followed by learning from eating experiences is the central idea of flavor processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Small|first1=D. M.|last2=Prescott|first2=J.|title=Odor/taste integration and the perception of flavor|journal=Experimental Brain Research|date=2005|volume=166|issue=3–4|pages=345–357|doi=10.1007/s00221-005-2376-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Verhagen|first1=J. V.|last2=Engelen|first2=L.|title=The neurocognitive bases of human multimodal food perception: Sensory integration|journal=Neuroscience &amp; Biobehavioral Reviews|date=2006|volume=30|issue=5|pages=613–650|doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2005.11.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Richard Stevenson mentions in ''The Psychology of Flavour'' that people often do not realize that a food's flavor can be described by the food's smell, taste, or texture. Instead, he claims, people perceive flavor as a "unitary percept", in which a descriptor for either taste or smell is used to describe a food's flavor.&lt;ref name="stevenson" /&gt; Consider the terms that are used to describe the flavors of foods. For instance, a food may ''taste'' sweet, but often its flavor is described as such while not considering its smell or other sensory characteristics. For example, honey ''tastes'' sweet so its smell is associated with that descriptor, and ''sweet'' is also used to describe its flavor. In fact, sweetness is one of the four basic taste qualities and only comprises part of a food's flavor.

Unlike flavor, aftertaste is a solely gustatory event that is not considered to involve any of the other major senses. The distinction of being based on one (aftertaste) versus multiple (flavor) sensory inputs is what separates the two phenomena.

==Foods with distinct aftertastes==
===Artificial sweeteners===
Low-calorie artificial sweeteners like [[saccharin]] and [[Acesulfame potassium|acesulfame-K]] are known for their bitter aftertastes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kuhn|first1=C.|last2=Bufe|first2=B.|last3=Winnig|first3=M.|last4=Hofmann|first4=T.|last5=Frank|first5=O.|last6=Behrens|first6=M.|last7=Lewtschenko|first7=T.|last8=Slack|first8=J. P.|last9=Ward|first9=C. D.|last10=Meyerhof|first10=W.|title=Bitter Taste Receptors for Saccharin and Acesulfame K|journal=Journal of Neuroscience|date=2004|volume=24|issue=45|pages=10260–10265|doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1225-04.2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, GIV3727 (4-(2,2,3-trimethylcyclopentyl) butanoic acid), a chemical that blocks saccharin and acesulfame-K activation of multiple bitter [[taste receptor]]s has been developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Slack|first1=J. P.|last2=Brockhoff|first2=A.|last3=Batram|first3=C.|last4=Menzel|first4=S.|last5=Sonnabend|first5=C.|last6=Born|first6=S.|last7=Galindo|first7=M. M.|last8=Kohl|first8=S.|last9=Thalmann|first9=S.|last10=Ostopovici-Halip|first10=L.|last11=Simons|first11=C. T.|last12=Ungureanu|first12=I.|last13=Duineveld|first13=K.|last14=Bologa|first14=C. G.|last15=Behrens|first15=M.|last16=Furrer|first16=S.|last17=Oprea|first17=T. I.|last18=Meyerhof|first18=W.|title=Modulation of Bitter Taste Perception by a Small Molecule hTAS2R Antagonist|journal=Current Biology|date=2010|volume=20|issue=12|pages=1104–1109|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2010.04.043}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the study, the addition of the bitter taste [[receptor antagonist]] GIV3727 to the saccharin and acesulfame-K solutions resulted in significantly lower taste intensity ratings when compared to the solutions that were not treated with GIV3727. This suggests that GIV3727 inhibits the normal functions of the bitter taste receptors because saccharin and acesulfame-K's bitter aftertastes were not observed. The ability to inhibit activation of the bitter taste receptors can have far-reaching effects if the bitter aftertastes of not only these two artificial sweeteners but also other foods, beverages, and even pharmaceuticals can be minimized.

===Wine===
In [[wine tasting]] the aftertaste or ''finish'' of a wine, is an important part of the evaluation.&lt;ref name ="wine" &gt;Stone, H, &amp; L., J. (2004). Sensory evaluation practices. Amsterdam: Elsevier Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; After tasting a wine, a taster will determine the wine's aftertaste, which is a major determinant of the wine's quality. The aftertaste of a wine can be described as bitter, persistent, short, sweet, smooth, or even non-existent. Included in assessing the aftertaste of a wine is consideration of the aromas still present after swallowing. High quality wines typically have long finishes accompanied by pleasant aromas.&lt;ref name="wine" /&gt; By assessing the combination of olfactory and aftertaste sensations, wine tasting actually determines not only the aftertaste profile of a wine, but its flavor profile as well.

Aired in New York City at 9:45am ET on the [[DuMont Television Network]]'s flagship station [[WABD]] (some sources say the show aired 12noon to 12;15pm ET).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=kbx7AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT52&amp;lpg=PT52&amp;dq=alice+burrows+the+needle+shop&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jyqSkOosYV&amp;sig=05nDjzLG5lCLl-OGoTxL-PiAxbQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ruwhVYSABNjboASd9YDoAg&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=alice%20burrows%20the%20needle%20shop&amp;f=false Marsha Cassidy, ''What Women Watched: Daytime Television in the 1950s'' (University of Texas Press, 2005)]&lt;/ref&gt; The show was a 15-minute daytime music program starring [[Amanda Randolph]], who hosted the program and sang.

The program is significant as one of the first regularly scheduled television show to feature an [[African-American]] woman as host. On the program, Randolph sang songs ranging from spirituals to [[boogie woogie]]. According to the book ''The Forgotten Network'' (2004), DuMont began offering 4.5 hours of morning and afternoon programming to affiliates in January 1949, but it is not clear which program these included. The program and several other WABD daytime shows seem to appear in [[Pittsburgh]] television schedules (on station WDTV) during 1949,&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=6MhRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=hWoDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4800%2C3549198 ''Pittsburgh Post-Gazette'' (January 17, 1949)]&lt;/ref&gt; so the program may have been shown on a network level.

According to the April 30, 1949, edition of newspaper ''Pittsburgh Courier'', the program also featured guest appearances, the first of which was [[Etta Moten]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fultonhistory.com/Newspapers%2023%2FPittsburgh%20PA%20Courier%2FPittsburgh%20PA%20Courier%201949%2FPittsburgh%20PA%20Courier%201949%20-%200429.pdf Pittsburgh Courier, April 30 1949] at Old Fulton NY Post Cards&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the book ''What Women Watched: Daytime Television in the 1950s'' (University of Texas Press, 2005) by Marsha Cassidy, the DuMont daytime schedule beginning in January 1949 was:

*10-10:30am   ''[[Johnny Olson's Rumpus Room]]''
*10:30-11am  ''Welcome, Neighbors''
*11am-12noon  ''[[The Stan Shaw Show]]''
*12noon-12:15pm   ''Amanda''
*12:15-12:30pm  ''Man in the Street''
*12:30-12:45pm  ''[[Camera Headlines]]''
*12:45-1pm   ''Fashions in Song''
*1-1:30pm   ''[[Okay, Mother]]''
*2:30-3pm  ''[[Inside Photoplay]]'' (''The Wendy Barrie Show'')
*3-3:15pm  ''[[The Needle Shop]]''
*3:15-3:30pm  ''Vincent Lopez Speaking'' (''[[The Vincent Lopez Show]]'')

==Reception==
The program aired as part of the DuMont experiment in [[daytime television]]. While not the first with daytime programming, DuMont's WABD was the first station to offer a schedule that started in the morning and ended after the evening programs; prior to this, daytime programming was occasional with schedules heavy on test patterns.

''Billboard'' magazine gave a very mixed review of the line-up, but ''Amanda'' was one of several program on the schedule they liked, with the magazine saying that the songs were "well-sung" and that "the gal is by far the most entertaining part of the early stretch".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Sw4EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PT18&amp;dq=%22amanda%22+lass+well-sung+7-10&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zuFCVP5ih8iYBaS4gOAC&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22amanda%22%20lass%20well-sung%207-10&amp;f=false ''Billboard'' (November 13, 1948)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preservation status==
As with most DuMont program, no episodes are known to exist. Kinescopes of daytime television of the 1940s are exceptionally rare, as are [[kinescope]]s of local programming (since kinescopes were intended for time-delay purposes, all U.S. stations saw little need to record local programming, and this would remain the case for years).

Although DuMont's main stations very occasionally made kinescopes of their local programming (there are more surviving WABD local kinescopes from the late-1940s/1950s than there are for many other stations of the period), most of the local programming is lost. DuMont's archives are alleged to have been dumped into the New York City waterway system and have never been recovered.

'''Axonometry''' is a graphical procedure belonging to [[descriptive geometry]] that generates a planar image of a three-dimensional object. The term "axonometry" means "to measure along axes", and indicates that the dimensions and scaling of the coordinate axes play a crucial role. The result of an axonometric procedure is a uniformly-scaled [[parallel projection]] of the object. In general, the resulting parallel projection is [[oblique projection|oblique]] (the rays are not perpendicular to the image plane); but in special cases the result is [[orthographic projection|orthographic]] (the rays are perpendicular to the image plane), which in this context is called an '''orthogonal axonometry'''.

In technical drawing and in architecture, axonometric perspective is a form of two-dimensional representation of three-dimensional objects  whose goal is to preserve the impression of volume or of relief. Sometimes also called rapid perspective or artificial perspective, it differs from conical perspective and does not represent what the eye actually sees: in particuliar parallel lines remain parallel and distant objects are not reduced in size. It can be considered a conical perspective conique whose center has been pushed out to infinity, i.e. very far from the object observed.

The term ''axonometry'' is used both for the graphical procedure described below, as well as the image ''produced'' by this procedure.
 
''Axonometry'' should not be confused with ''[[axonometric projection]]'', which in English literature usually refers to ''orthogonal axonometry''.

== Principle of axonometry ==
[[File:Axonom-def.svg|thumb|The point &lt;math&gt;\overline P&lt;/math&gt; is the projection of a point &lt;math&gt;P=(x,y,z)&lt;/math&gt; onto the projection plane ''Π''. The foreshortenings are &lt;math&gt;v_x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;v_y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v_z&lt;/math&gt;.]]
[[Pohlke's theorem]] is the basis for the following procedure to construct a scaled parallel projection of a three-dimensional object:{{sfn|Graf|1961|p=144}}{{sfn|Stärk|1978|p=156}}
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select projections of the coordinate axes, such that all three coordinate axes are not collapsed to a single point or line. Usually the z-axis is vertical.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select for these projections the [[foreshortening]]s, &lt;math&gt;v_x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;v_y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v_z&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;v_x,v_y,v_z &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The projection &lt;math&gt;\overline P&lt;/math&gt; of a point &lt;math&gt;P=(x,y,z)&lt;/math&gt; is determined in three steps (the result is independent of the order of these steps):
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;starting at the point &lt;math&gt;\overline O&lt;/math&gt;, move by the amount &lt;math&gt;v_x\cdot x&lt;/math&gt; in the direction of &lt;math&gt;\overline x&lt;/math&gt;, then&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;move by the amount &lt;math&gt;v_y\cdot y&lt;/math&gt; in the direction of &lt;math&gt;\overline y&lt;/math&gt;, then&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;move by the amount &lt;math&gt;v_z\cdot z&lt;/math&gt; in the direction of &lt;math&gt;\overline z&lt;/math&gt; and finally&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mark the final position as point &lt;math&gt;\overline P&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

In order to obtain undistorted results, select the projections of the axes and foreshortenings carefully (see below). In order to produce an [[orthographic projection]], only the projections of the coordinate axes are freely selected; the foreshortenings are fixed (see [[:de:orthogonale Axonometrie]]).{{sfn|Graf|1961|p=145}}

== The choice of the images of the axes and the forshortenings ==

[[File:Axo-parameter-gen.svg|thumb|Parameters and notations]]

'''Notation:'''
* &lt;math&gt;\alpha:&lt;/math&gt; angle between &lt;math&gt;\overline{z}&lt;/math&gt;-axis and &lt;math&gt;\overline{x}&lt;/math&gt;-axis
* &lt;math&gt;\beta:&lt;/math&gt; angle between &lt;math&gt;\overline{z}&lt;/math&gt;-axis and  &lt;math&gt;\overline{y}&lt;/math&gt;-axis
* &lt;math&gt;\gamma:&lt;/math&gt; angle between &lt;math&gt;\overline{x}&lt;/math&gt;-axis and &lt;math&gt;\overline{y}&lt;/math&gt;-axis.

The '''angles''' can be chosen so that &lt;math&gt;0^\circ&lt;\alpha+\beta&lt;360^\circ\ .&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The '''forshortenings''': &lt;math&gt;0&lt;\; v_x,\; v_y,\; v_z\ .&lt;/math&gt;

Only for suitable choices of angles and forshortenings does one get undistorted images. The next diagram shows the images of the unit cube for various angles and forshortenings and gives some hints for how to make these personal choices.

[[File:Axonometry-var14.svg|600px|frame|none|Various axonometric images of a unit cube. (The image plane is  parallel to the y-z-plane.)&lt;br /&gt;
The left and the far right images look more like prolonged cuboids instead of a cube.]]

[[File:Haus-karo-axonometrie.svg|thumb|Axonometry (cavalier perspective) of a house on checked pattern paper.]] 
In order to keep the drawing simple, one should choose simple forshortenings, for example &lt;math&gt;1.0&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;0.5&lt;/math&gt;.

If two forshortenings are equal, the projection is called '''dimetric'''.&lt;br /&gt;
If the three forshortenings are equal, the projection is called '''isometric'''.&lt;br /&gt;
If all forshortenings are different, the projection is called '''trimetric'''.

The parameters in the diagram at right (e.g. of the house drawn on graph paper) are: &lt;math&gt;\alpha=135^\circ, \beta =90^\circ,\ v_y=v_z=1,\; v_x=1/\sqrt{2}\ .&lt;/math&gt; Hence it is a ''dimetric'' axonometry. The image plane is parallel to the y-z-plane and any planar figure parallel to the y-z-plane appears in its true shape.

== Special axonometries ==

[[File:Axo-parameter-spec.svg|600px|frame|none|Parameters of special axonometries.]]

=== Engineer projection ===
In this case {{sfn|Graf|1961|p=155}}{{sfn|Stärk|1978|p=168}}
* the ''forshortenings'' are: &lt;math&gt;v_x=0.5, \ v_y=v_z=1\ &lt;/math&gt; (dimetric axonometry) and
* the ''angles'' between the axes are: &lt;math&gt; \alpha=132^\circ,\ \beta=97^\circ \ .&lt;/math&gt;
These angles are marked on many German [[set square]]s.

Advantages of an engineer projection: 
* simple forshortenings, 
* a uniformly scaled orthographic projection with scaling factor 1.06, 
* the contour of a sphere is a circle (in general, an ellipse) .
For more details: see [[:de:Axonometrie]].

=== Cavalier perspective, cabinet perspective ===
* image plane parallel to y-z-plane.
In the literature the terms "cavalier perspective" and "cabinet perspective" are not uniformly defined. The above definition is the most general one. Often, further restrictions are applied.{{sfn|Graf|1961|p=95}}{{sfn|Stärk|1978|p=159}} For example: 
:cabinet perspective: additionally choose &lt;math&gt;\alpha=135^\circ&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v_x=0.5&lt;/math&gt; (dimetric),
:cavalier perspective: additionally choose &lt;math&gt;\alpha=135^\circ&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v_x=1&lt;/math&gt; (isometric).

=== Birds eye view, military projection ===
* image plane parallel to x-y-plane. 
:military projection: additionally choose &lt;math&gt;v_z=1&lt;/math&gt; (isometric).
Such axonometries are often used for city maps, in order to keep horizontal figures undistorted.

=== Isometric axonometry ===
[[File:Axo-iso-beisp.svg|thumb|standard isometry: cube, cuboid, house and sphere]]
(Not to be confused with an [[isometry]] between metric spaces.)

For an '''isometric axonometry''' all forshortenings are equal. The angles can be chosen arbitrarily, but a common choice is &lt;math&gt;\alpha=\beta=\gamma=120^\circ&lt;/math&gt;.

For the '''standard isometry''' or just '''isometry''' one chooses:
* &lt;math&gt;v_x=v_y=v_z=1&lt;/math&gt; (all axes undistorted) 
* &lt;math&gt;\alpha=\beta=\gamma=120^\circ\ .&lt;/math&gt;

The advantage of a standard isometry: 
* the coordinates can be taken unchanged, 
* the image is a scaled orthographic projection with scale factor &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{1.5}=1.225&lt;/math&gt;. Hence the image has a good impression and the contour of a sphere is a circle.  
* Some computer graphic systems (for example, [[xfig]]) provide a suitable raster (see diagram) as support.
In order to prevent scaling, one can choose the unhandy forshortenings
* &lt;math&gt;v_x=v_y=v_z=\sqrt{2/3}&lt;/math&gt; (instead of 1)
and the image is an (unscaled) orthographic projection.

[[File:Axo-examples.svg|frame|none|500px|various axonometries of a tower&lt;br /&gt;
milit. proj.: &lt;math&gt;v_z=0.5\ ,&lt;/math&gt; caval. proj.: &lt;math&gt;v_x=0.5\ ,&lt;/math&gt; isom. axonom.: &lt;math&gt;v=1&lt;/math&gt;]]

== Circles in axonometry ==
A parallel projection of a circle is in general an ellipse. An important special case occurs, if the circle's plane is parallel to the image plane&amp;ndash;the image of the circle is then a congruent circle. In the diagram, the circle contained in the front face is undistorted. If the image of a circle is an ellipse, one can map four points on orthogonal diameters and the surrounding square of tangents and in the image parallelogram fill-in an ellipse by hand. A better, but more time consuming method consists of drawing the images of two perpendicular diameters of the circle, which are conjugate diameters of the image ellipse, determining the axes of the ellipse with [[Rytz's construction]] and [[ellipse#drawing ellipses|drawing the ellipse]].
&lt;gallery widths="200" heights="200"&gt;
Axonometrie-kreise-c.svg|Cavalier perspective: circles
File:Kugel-vogelp.svg|Military projection: sphere
&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Spheres in axonometry ==
In a general axonometry of a sphere the image contour is an ellipse. 
The contour of a sphere is a circle only in an ''orthogonal'' axonometry. But, as the engineer projection and the standard isometry are scaled orthographic projections, the contour of a sphere is a circle in these cases, as well. As the diagram shows, an ellipse as the contour of a sphere might be confusing, so, if a sphere is part of an object to be mapped, one should choose an orthogonal axonometry or an engineer projection or a standard isometry.

[[Silver]] was important in [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] society as it was the most precious metal right after [[gold]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cormack|first1=Robin|title=Byzantium Art|date=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-284211-4|pages=63–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Byzantine silver''' was prized in both the secular and domestic realms. Aristocratic homes had silver dining ware, and in churches silver was used for crosses, liturgical vessels such as the [[paten]]s and [[chalice]]s required for every [[Eucharist]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Silver was also used as a medium in pagan mythological scenes and objects such as the [[Sevso Treasure]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Silver pieces, especially [[Household silver|silver]]ware, continued to be rendered in the classical style into the seventh century.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York.|frame]]Silver items were also controlled stamped, sometimes up to five times on a single piece, many such pieces are dated between the fourth and eighth centuries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; During the reign of [[Heraclius]] (r. 610-41 AD), the production of silverware halts, which coincides with the State confiscating valuable metals to help replenish the treasury during the [[Greco-Persian Wars|Persian War]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Silver items began to regularly buried, such as the [[Kaper Koraon Treasure|Stuma Treasure]] of 56 objects found in Syria during 1908, dated between 540 and 640 and attributed to the village church of [[Sergius and Bacchus|St Sergios]] at Kaper Koraon.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Sion Treasure from Lycia consists of 71 pieces with 30 pieces stamped between 550 and 565 AD &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; See [[Byzantine coinage|Byzantine Coins]] for currency and monetary information.

== Bowls ==

[[File:Byzantine_-_Silver_Cup_-_Walters_57631.jpg|left|thumb|This bowl, which could have been used for hand washing or baptism.  [[Walters Art Museum]], Baltimore, Maryland.]]
During the nineteenth century two silver bowls were discovered in Estonia that date to the late fifth or early sixth century period of which the Byzantine Emperor [[Anastasius I Dicorus|Anastasius I]] reigned 491-518 AD.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Quast, Tamla|first1=Dieter, Ulle|title=Two Fifth Century Ad Byzantine Silver Bowls from Estonia|journal=Estonian Journal of Archeology|date=2010|volume=14.2|issue=December|pages=99–101}}&lt;/ref&gt; The silver bowl deemed the “Kriimani” bowl, for the location in which it was found, has a rim of 15.5&amp;nbsp;cm with a height of 9&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Two beaded bands border the rim of the bowl. Silver analysis shows 93-95% Silver, 3.5-5% Copper, and traces of Gold and Platinum.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The second bowl, referred to as the “Varnja Bowl,” was discovered in 1895 near the village of Varnja.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Varnja bowl also has two beaded bands that circle the rim, and it is also stamped similar to the Kriimani  bowl.

== Crosses ==

Crosses were also lavishly adorned with precious materials and biblical scenes during the Byzantine period. Scholars refer to a cross called “The Work of Mark,” due to the monks inscriptions on the cross.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hetherington|first1=Paul|title=The Work of Mark|journal=Apollo|date=2010|issue=March|pages=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cross is dated at late tenth or early eleventh century.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This cross is 47&amp;nbsp;cm high, 26&amp;nbsp;cm wide, and very ornamented meaning it was probably used in processions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The iron core of the cross is encased in silver. Points projecting from the four arms of the cross would all have had small silver-gilt balls, which can be seen on other such crosses.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Traces of gilding where the balls would have been provide further evidence. On one side across the central arm are three roundels forming a deesis, which shows [[Jesus|Christ]] as a central figure holding a book of gospels in his left hand and blessing with his right.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] is shown bowing on Christ’s left while [[St John the Baptist]] bows on his right &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The roundel on the top arm portrays the Archangel Michael, while the bottom roundel portrays a figure titled [[Theodore the Martyr|St Theodore]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This side is heavily embossed with silver-gilt, and has a vine scroll and beaded border.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The reverse side does not have such borders.

The reverse has a black medium used in conjunction with the partial gilding of niello, which is an enamel type substance, in this case mixed with sulphur and silver.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The roundels portray saints with the top of the cross showing the evangelist St John Theologos. The arm roundels show [[St Peter]] on the left and [[St Paul]] on the right.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The fourth roundel shows [[St Basil]] in bishops robes.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The middle of the scene has Virgin Mary and her child with a standing portrait of [[St Constantine, Thorpe Constantine|St Constantine]] above them decorated in his robe.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The Virgin Mary has [[St Demetrius]] on the left, St Procopius on her right, and the last saint shown is St Nikitas.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; All saints are identified by the engraving of their names above them. An inscription of a semicircular area just 3&amp;nbsp;cm wide and embedded into the front of the cross, before the tang projects, reads “‘The work of the Faithful Mark’” &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
	 
Similar crosses are known of such as the cross of Adrianople. This cross has frontal images of Christ and the Virgin Mary, along with archangels [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]] and [[Gabriel]] on the cross arms.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The reverse side shows church fathers, and the donor’s name is inscribed as [[Sisinnios Triphyllios|Sisinnios]], which dates the cross to the final years of the tenth century.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

Another cross, in the [[Cleveland Museum of Art]], is dated to the eleventh century due to its comparison of portraits with imperial portraits on coins and seal of that time.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Distribution of silver-gilt relief decoration and niello are the same on both sides.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Plates ==
Silver pieces, and especially plates, such as the [[Missorium of Theodosius I]] of 338 AD are engraved and styled similary to the set of nine plates showing the Life of [[King David|David]] stamped between 613 and 630 AD.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Kaiseraugst [[Achilles]] Plate has the closest similarity to the [[David Plates]] in regards to late antique silver.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leader|first1=Ruth|title=The David Plates Revisited: Transforming the Secular in Early Byzantium|journal=Art Bulletin|date=2000|volume=82|issue=September|pages=421–422}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Achilles Plate was buried with a large hoard of domestic silver during the fourth century inside the walls of the Rhine frontier fort of [[Agusta Rarica]], which was discovered in the early 1960s.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The Achiles Plate has the signature of Pausylyps of [[Thessalanike]] which places its manufacturing in the eastern Byzantine empire.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This is reinforced with the similar control stamps on the David Plates.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The large octagonal plate has decoration around its rim, and in the center a medallion shows a series of scenes of Achilles’ life before the [[Trojan War]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The Achilles Plate shows a narrative of eleven scenes on one plate.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The David Plates and the Achilles Plate show a tradition of late antique silver working that produced many objects between the fourth and seventh centuries with scenes from traditional Grecco-Roman mythology.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The David Plates and Achilles Plate are very decorative, and would have been used as show pieces.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

[[File:Shandwick02.jpg|thumb|Clach a' Charridh, Landward side]]
The '''Clach a' Charridh''' or '''Shandwick Stone''' is a Class II [[Pictish stones|Pictish stone]] located near [[Shandwick]] on the [[Tarbat peninsula]] in [[Easter Ross]], [[Scotland]]. 

[[Image:Scotland Highlands Shandwick Stone.jpg|thumb|250px|left]]
==Carving==
It is a Class II stone, with the [[cross]] facing the seaward side, and the secular scene facing inland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://her.highland.gov.uk/SingleResult.aspx?uid=%27MHG8539%27| title=The Shandwick Stone| publisher=Highland Council: Historic Environment Record| accessdate=18 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter contains six panels, the first (from top to bottom) being a standard Pictish double-disc, the second being a [[Pictish Beast]] and the third being a possible hunting scene, with warriors depicted alongside an eagle, a boar, and various other creatures. The bottom three panels consist of woven patterns. The stone is now encased in a glass cover room.

==History==
The Gaelic name (''Clach a’ Charaidh'') means ‘stone of the grave-plots’. A burial ground here was recorded in 1889 as last used during the cholera epidemic of 1832 and ploughed under about 1885.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://her.highland.gov.uk/SingleResult.aspx?uid='THG7'| title=The Pictish Trail| publisher=Highland Council: Historic Environment Record| accessdate=18 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She is the elder sister of actress and presenter [[Mel Giedroyc]].

==Early life==
Giedroyc grew up in [[Leatherhead]], [[Surrey]]. Her father is Michal Giedroyc, a historian of [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|Polish-Lithuanian]] descent from the princely [[Giedroyć family]], who came to England in 1947; he died in December 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/register/obituary-michal-giedroyc-393jhqtjq|title=Michal Giedroyc|work=The Times|date=29 January 2018|accessdate=29 January 2018}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother, Rosy, is of English descent.&lt;ref name="Stanford"&gt;{{cite news|last=Stanford|first=Peter|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/features/7514874/My-fathers-Siberian-prison-hell.html|title=My father's Siberian prison hell|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=25 March 2010|accessdate=29 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She attended [[Bristol University]], where she first began to make films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author-last=Downs|author-first=Jacqueline|chapter=Coky Giedroyc|editor1-last=Allon|editor1-first=Yoram|editor2-last=Cullen|editor2-first=Del|editor3-last=Patterson|editor3-first=Hannah|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OJAcf31BweQC&amp;pg=PA111|title=Contemporary British &amp; Irish Directors|location=London|publisher=Wallflower Press|year=2001|page=111|isbn=9781903364215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Giedroyc has directed several films, including ''[[Women Talking Dirty]]'' and ''[[Stella Does Tricks]]''; she is best known for her work directing television dramas, which have included ''[[Wuthering Heights (2009 television serial)|Wuthering Heights]]'', ''[[The Virgin Queen (TV serial)|The Virgin Queen]]'', ''[[Oliver Twist (2007 TV miniseries)|Oliver Twist]]'', ''[[Fanny Cradock|Fear of Fanny]]'', ''[[Carrie's War#Film, TV or theatrical adaptations|Carrie's War]]'', and three episodes of ''[[Blackpool (TV serial)|Blackpool]]''.

In 2007 she was nominated, with [[Paula Milne]] and Paul Rutman, for a [[British Academy Television Awards#Categories|Best Drama Serial]] [[British Academy Television Award|BAFTA Award]] for ''[[The Virgin Queen (TV serial)|The Virgin Queen]]''. In 2010, her directing work for the [[BBC]] television series ''[[The Nativity (2010 TV series)|The Nativity]]'' was praised by critics, although the story portrayed some controversial elements that caused debate between Christians due to its modern dramatisations of the birth of Christ.

Giedroyc directed ''[[A Study in Pink]]'', originally filmed as a 60-minute pilot for the television series ''[[Sherlock (TV series)|Sherlock]]'', which was written by [[Steven Moffat]]. The BBC decided not to broadcast the episode because they wished to change the broadcast length to 90 minutes. However, the pilot was released on the DVD of the first series, and it proved to be slightly different from the final version. She has also directed BBC's ''[[The Hour (BBC TV series)|The Hour]]'' and ''[[What Remains (TV series)|What Remains]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/mediapacks/whatremains/|title=A new thrilling four-part whodunit written by Tony Basgallop for BBC One|work=BBC|date=14 August 2013|accessdate=27 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Giedroyc directed two episodes of the 2014 [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] horror television series ''[[Penny Dreadful (TV series)|Penny Dreadful]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.casarotto.co.uk/assets/x/51853.pdf|title=PJ Dillon, Director of Photography|publisher=Casarotto}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pjdillon.com/|title=PJ Dillon: Latest News|publisher=PJDillon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 December 2015, Giedroyc directed the live television production of ''[[The Sound of Music]]'', starring [[Kara Tointon]] as Maria, and her sister [[Mel Giedroyc]] as Frau Schmidt. The two-and-a-half-hour [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]] transmission was the first musical to be broadcast live on national television in the UK, and had a cast and crew of more than 400 and 177 costumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/dec/15/as-itv-prepares-for-the-sound-of-music-live-are-we-watching-tvs-future|title=As ITV prepares for The Sound of Music Live, are we watching TV's future?|date=15 December 2015|publisher=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, it was announced Giedroyc would direct ''[[How to Build a Girl]]'', based upon the novel of the same name by [[Caitlin Moran]], who also wrote the film's screenplay alongside [[John Niven]]. [[Beanie Feldstein]], [[Alfie Allen]], [[Paddy Considine]], [[Sarah Solemani]], Laurie Kynaston, [[Joanna Scanlan]], [[Arinze Kene]], [[Frank Dillane]], Tadhg Murphy and Ziggy Heath will star in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2018/05/lady-bird-beanie-feldstein-caitlin-moran-how-to-build-a-girl-cannes-1202385582/|title=‘Lady Bird’s Beanie Feldstein To Lead ‘How To Build A Girl’ – Cannes|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|first1=Andreas|last1=Wiseman|first2=Nancy|last2=Tartaglione|date=May 8, 2018|accessdate=July 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2018/07/beanie-feldstein-how-to-build-a-girl-paddy-considine-lionsgate-alfie-allen-sarah-solemani-caitlin-moran-1202426923/|title=Beanie Feldstein Comedy ‘How To Build A Girl’ Adds Cast, Lionsgate With Shoot Under Way|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|first=Andreas|last=Wiseman|date=July 16, 2018|accessdate=July 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Giedroyc married her first husband at 21, and had a son before divorcing. She remarried in 1998 to [[Bowyer-Smyth baronets#Smith, later Smyth, later Smijth, later Bowyer-Smijth, later Bowyer-Smyth baronets, of Hill Hall (1661)|Sir Thomas Weyland Bowyer-Smyth, 15th Baronet]], a BAFTA-winning production designer, with whom she has two children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stanford|first1=Peter|title=Problems like Maria’s|url=http://www.thetablet.co.uk/features/2/7567/0//problems-like-maria-s|website=The Tablet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''conjectural portrait''' is a [[portrait]] made of a historical figure for whom no authentic contemporary portrait is available.  The depiction, then, may be variously informed by [[primary source|written accounts]] of [[Human physical appearance|physical appearance]], conjecture based on the subject's culture and background, and/or the artist's conception of the subject's [[Moral character|inner essence]].

==Iconic portraits==
Certain conjectural portraits have become [[iconography|iconic]] of their subjects, and are widely recognizable as such, with few being aware that they are not authentic portraits.  For example, portraits of [[Christopher Columbus]] and [[Joan of Arc]] are widely recognized.

'''''Deadly Voyage''''' is a 1996 &lt;!--US-UK--&gt; television film directed by [[John Mackenzie (film director)|John Mackenzie]] and written by [[Stuart Urban]]. Produced by Union Pictures and John Goldschmidt's Viva Films for joint distribution to [[BBC Films]] and [[HBO]]. It was first film made by [[HBO Pictures|HBO NYC Productions]] under HBO Pictures banner when HBO Showcase was reconstructed. It tells the true story of [[Kingsley Ofosu]], the sole survivor of a group of nine African [[stowaway]]s discovered aboard the cargo ship ''MC Ruby'' in 1992 and subsequently murdered by that ship's crew. 

==Plot==
Aboard the cargo ship ''MC Ruby'', docked in New York City, six stowaways burst from one of the containers being unloaded.  They flee from the ship, but are apprehended by dock workers and the [[New York Police Department|New York police]]. The ''MC Ruby''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] crew watches the detention with some amusement, but the ship's captain and his [[first mate]], Ion Plesin, are displeased, aware that the [[illegal immigrant]]s will cost the shipping company hundreds of thousands of [[US dollar|dollars]] in fines.  In response, company representative Andreas Vlachos arrives to oversee future operations and warn that the crew will be liable for any more such fines.

Later, the ''MC Ruby'' is docked in [[Ghana]], where dock worker [[Kingsley Ofosu]] plans to some day stow away aboard a cargo ship to pursue a better life for himself and his pregnant wife in the United States. Upon winning a [[lottery]], he decides that the time is right, as he can use the money to get on his feet upon his arrival. Ofosu, his brother and six other men slip aboard the ''MC Ruby'' and hide in its cargo holds. With the ship behind schedule, Plesin has only one hour to conduct a stowaway search prior to departure.  The hasty endeavour fails to turn up Ofosu's group and the ship sails, bound for France, prior to sailing on to New York.

Ofosu's group encounters another stowaway, who had boarded the ship in [[Cameroon]]. The men jovially discuss the vocations they intend to pursue in the United States. Later, their water container breaks, forcing them to leave the cargo area to forage for water. They leave evidence of their presence, which the crew discovers. To prevent Vlachos from learning that the stowaway search had failed, the captain has Plesin assemble a small team to conduct a secret search.

The search finds the stowaways and Plesin discusses the predicament with the captain. Given the illegal immigrant fines, they cannot bring the stowaways into port. However, they also cannot alter course to drop the men off somewhere, as Vlachos would then find out about them. Plesin and his small search team hide the Africans in the ship's anchor hold without food or water.  When they object, they find Plesin unsympathetic to their desire to escape poverty.  He points out that if the stowaways' presence becomes known, he and his men will be fired, and any other jobs they can find in Ukraine will pay even less than the meager wages earned by Ofosu on the docks in Ghana.  Yuri, one of Plesin's men, takes pity and secretly delivers them a little water, but he is powerless to do more. As the stowaways suffer, Ofosu laments that he has led the group to their deaths.

The captain acquiesces to Plesin's plan to kill the stowaways. Plesin's team takes the men from the hold in small groups. The team brings each group to another area, murders the men, and throws their bodies overboard. Yuri tries to stop the massacre, but the others overpower and subdue him. Ofosu and his brother are the last two to be brought out, but they surmise what is about to occur and make a run for it, heading in different directions.  As they do, Plesin's team shoots Ofosu's brother, catches him and throws him overboard as Ofosu watches. Ofosu flees to the main cargo hold to hide and is able to elude further searches for him. While in the cargo hold, Ofosu stashes a picture of himself and his wife inside one of the cocoa sacks.

Plesin's men are concerned about their inability to locate the final stowaway, but they reason that all Western countries despise [[Black people|black]] immigrants and thus no one will be motivated to take action against them. They also expect to be able to secure him upon reaching port when he tries to exit the ship. However, once the ship docks, Ofosu is able to escape to shore and make it to the police before Plesin's men can catch him.

The next day, French authorities board the ''MC Ruby'' to investigate Ofosu's story. Plesin first denies that there had been any stowaway, but the authorities search the ship's hold and find Ofosu's picture in the cocoa sack. Plesin's final play is to acknowledge the killings but to suggest that he and his men had done France a favour by preventing undesirable blacks from entering the country illegally. The police are unimpressed by this rationale and immediately arrest Plesin and his men, along with the captain.

The film ends with Ofosu on the phone with his wife, hearing the cries of his newborn son, whom he pledges to name after his brother. An epilogue notes that the captain and first mate were convicted of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. Three other crew members were also convicted and received 20-year sentences, while one crew member was acquitted. Kingsley Ofosu was living in France and hoping to have his wife and child join him.

==Cast==
*[[Omar Epps]] as [[Kingsley Ofosu]]
*[[Joss Ackland]] as the ship's captain
*[[Sean Pertwee]] as Ion Plesin
*[[David Suchet]] as Andreas Vlachos
(US) [[Peace Corps]] volunteers in Ghana were recruited as extras to play the ship's crew members, although many of these scenes do not appear in the final production.

==Production==
When the trial of the crew members made international headlines, multiple film companies approached Ofosu to purchase the rights to his story. He eventually struck a deal with Union Pictures and Viva Films.  The Union Pictures/Viva Films production was to be distributed to and financed by HBO and the BBC.&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite news |last=Davies |first=Nick |date=3 December 2007 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/dec/03/immigration.uk |title=The cruellest voyage |work=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The screenplay for ''Deadly Voyage'' was written by [[Stuart Urban]], who used interviews with Ofosu as his primary source material. Urban was also originally slated to direct, but when he took ill, [[John Mackenzie (film director)|John Mackenzie]] was brought in to replace him.  The movie was filmed in England and in [[Ghana]].&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;{{cite news |date=12 October 1996 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/4704975/I-cry-when-I-see-this-film.html |title=I cry when I see this film |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Producer John Goldschmidt noted that the Ghana portion of the shoot was particularly challenging, with weather that was extremely hot and humid and multiple crew members coming down with [[malaria]] or [[dysentery]].  There were also many logistical problems, as Ghana lacked an infrastructure conducive to executing [[principal photography]] for a major motion picture.  Goldschmidt said that the original plan had been to film in South Africa, since that country was more "geared up for this sort of thing", being a location often used for major films set in Africa.  However, the decision was made to film in Ghana for the sake of authenticity, and despite the difficulties, Goldschmidt felt that that genuineness shone through in the finished work.&lt;ref name=telegraph /&gt;

[[Omar Epps]], the film's star, spoke a bit more positively about his experience in Ghana.  He said that he was able to spend a good deal of time with Ofosu in preparing for the role.  Epps also said that he had learned to speak a little bit of [[Twi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=French |first=Howard W. |date=14 January 1996 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/14/arts/television-into-africa-to-tell-an-unlikely-tale-of-survival.html?pagewanted=all |title=Television: into Afric to tell an unlikely tale of survival |work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Ofosu expressed doubt that he had received fair compensation from Union Pictures for the film.  He said that he had received US$67,500, but that that sum had been based on an estimate of the film's total production costs, of which he was to receive 1.5%.  Ofosu claimed he'd never been given an accounting of the final production costs to determine if he was owed more.  He also said that he was to receive 10% of the movie's net profits and, but that he had never seen any payment along those lines.&lt;ref name=guardian /&gt; Union Pictures (which had gone bankrupt by that time) co-producer Bradley Adams pointed the finger at HBO and the BBC, saying that he also had never seen any accounting of profits or total budget figures from the two companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Adams |first=Bradley |date=6 December 2007 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/dec/06/bbc.mainsection |title=Letters: What happened after Deadly Voyage |work=[[The Guardian]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Newspaper reviews of ''Deadly Voyage'' were largely positive.  Noting that its depictions of [[man's inhumanity to man]] were somewhat distressing to watch, the ''[[South Florida Sun-Sentinel]]'' labelled it an "effective film".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Jicha |first=Tom |date=9 June 1996 |title=Hate, death stalk refugees in ship's hold |publisher=''[[South Florida Sun-Sentinel]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Daytona Beach News-Journal]]'' called it a "well-crafted drama" made all the more disturbing by the fact that observering Ofosu's true story was much like watching a fictional thriller film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Callea |first= Donna |date=15 June 1996 |title=Deadly Voyage, a chilling film |work=[[The Daytona Beach News-Journal]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Kansas City Star]]'' branded it a "tough, provocative [[docudrama]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Duffy|first= Mike |date=15 June 1996 |title=Deadly Voyage is gritty drama |publisher=[[Kansas City Star]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The New York Times]]'', however, was more critical, offering that the film was "not a great movie" and declaring that most of its characters were "little more than stick figures".  Nonetheless, the paper did see the movie as "nightmarishly harrowing", calling it a "searing descent into human cruelty", and praising the performances of Epps and Pertwee as the film's primary protagonist and antagonist respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=O'Connor |first=John J. |date=14 June 1996 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/14/arts/tv-weekend-9-african-stowaways-and-a-homicidal-crew.html?pagewanted=1 |title=TV Weeknd; 9 African Stowaways And a Homicidal Crew |work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{DISPLAYTITLE:''Deus ex machina''}}
[[File:Medea rappresentation (2009) 07.JPG|thumb|''Deus ex machina'' in classical theatre: Euripides' ''[[Medea (play)|Medea]]'', performed in 2009 in Syracuse, Italy]]

'''''Deus ex machina''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈdeʊs ɛks ˈmaː.kʰɪ.naː|lang}}: {{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|eɪ|.|ə|s|_|ɛ|k|s|_|ˈ|m|ɑː|k|iː|n|ə}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|iː|ə|s|_|ɛ|k|s|_|ˈ|m|æ|k|ᵻ|n|ə}};&lt;ref&gt;''[[Random House Dictionary]]''&lt;/ref&gt; plural: ''dei ex machina''; English ‘god from the machine’) is a [[plot device]] whereby a seemingly unsolvable problem in a story is suddenly and abruptly resolved by an unexpected and seemingly unlikely occurrence, typically so much as to seem contrived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary | title=deus ex machina | dictionary=Merriam-Webster | accessdate=23 Apr 2018 | url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/deus%20ex%20machina}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.britannica.com/art/deus-ex-machina | title=Deus ex machina | website=Encyclopaedia Britannica | accessdate=23 Apr 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its function can be to resolve an otherwise irresolvable plot situation, to surprise the audience, to bring the tale to a [[happy ending]], or act as a comedic device.

==Origin of the expression==
''Deus ex machina'' is a Latin [[calque]] {{ety|gre|''ἀπὸ μηχανῆς θεός'' (apò mēkhanês theós)|god from the machine}}.&lt;ref&gt;One of the earliest occurrences of the phrase is in fragment 227 of [[Menander]]: ἀπὸ μηχανῆϛ θεὸς ἐπεφάνηϛ "You are by your epiphany a veritable god from the machine", as quoted in ''The Woman Possessed with a Divinity'', as translated in ''Menander: The Principal Fragments'' (1921) by [[:de:Francis Greenleaf Allinson|Francis Greenleaf Allinson]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was coined from the conventions of [[Greek tragedy]], where a machine is used to bring actors playing gods onto the stage. The machine could be either a crane (''[[mechane]]'') used to lower actors from above or a riser that brought actors up through a trapdoor. Preparation to pick up the actors was done behind the ''[[Skene (theatre)|skene]]''. The idea was introduced by [[Aeschylus]] and was used often to resolve the conflict and conclude the drama. Although the device is associated mostly with Greek tragedy, it also appeared in comedies.&lt;ref name="machine"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chondros |first1=Thomas G. |last2=Milidonis |first2=Kypros|last3=Vitzilaios |first3=George |last4=Vaitsis|first4=John |title="Deus-Ex-Machina" reconstruction in the Athens theater of Dionysus |journal=Mechanism and Machine Theory |date=September 2013 |volume=67 |pages=172–191 |doi=10.1016/j.mechmachtheory.2013.04.010}}&lt;!--|accessdate=15 December 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient examples===
[[Aeschylus]] used the device in his ''[[The Eumenides|Eumenides]]'', but it was with [[Euripides]] that it became an established stage machine. More than half of Euripides' extant [[tragedy|tragedies]] employ a ''deus ex machina'' in their resolution, and some critics claim that Euripides, not Aeschylus, invented it.&lt;ref&gt;Rehm (1992, 72) and Walton (1984, 51).&lt;/ref&gt; A frequently cited example is Euripides' ''[[Medea (play)|Medea]]'', in which the ''deus ex machina'', a dragon-drawn chariot sent by the sun god, is used to convey his granddaughter [[Medea]], who has just committed murder and [[infanticide]], away from her husband [[Jason]] to the safety and civilization of Athens. In ''[[Alcestis (play)|Alcestis]]'', the [[eponymous]] heroine agrees to give up her own life in order to spare the life of her husband, Admetus. At the end, [[Heracles]] shows up and seizes Alcestis from [[Thanatos|Death]], restoring her to life and to Admetus.

[[Aristophanes]]' play ''[[Thesmophoriazusae]]'' parodies Euripides' frequent use of the crane by making Euripides himself a character in the play and bringing him on stage by way of the ''mechane''.

The effect of the device on Greek audiences was a direct and immediate emotional response. Audiences would have a feeling of wonder and astonishment at the appearance of the gods, which would often add to the moral effect of the drama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cunningham |first1=Maurice P.|title=Medea ΑΠΟ ΜΗΧΑΝΗΣ|journal=Classical Philology |date=July 1954 |volume=49 |issue=3 |pages=151–160 |jstor = 265931 |doi = 10.1086/363788 }}&lt;!--|accessdate=28 September 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern theatrical examples===
[[Shakespeare]] used the device in ''[[As You Like It]]'', ''[[Pericles, Prince of Tyre]]'', ''[[Cymbeline]]''  and ''[[The Winter's Tale]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Rehm (1992, 70).&lt;/ref&gt; It was also used in John Gay's ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]'' where the author uses a character to break the action and rewrite the ending as a reprieve of the hanging of MacHeath. Both in Shakespeare's and Gay's plays the ''deus ex machina'' happens with breaking the dramatic illusion often in the form of an episodic narrator exposing the play itself and laying bare the author. This is different from the use of the ''deus ex machina'' in the ancient examples with the ending coming from a participant in the action in the form of a god. It is natural for the gods to be considered participants and not outside sources because of their privileged position and power. It is these attributes that allow the Greek gods to believably wrap up and solve the series of events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dunn|first1=Francis M|title=Tragedy's End : Closure and Innovation in Euripidean Drama: Closure and Innovation in Euripidean Drama |date=1996 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the politically turbulent 17th and 18th&amp;nbsp;centuries, the ''deus ex machina'' was sometimes used to make a controversial thesis more palatable to the powers of the day. For example, in the final scene of [[Molière]]'s ''[[Tartuffe]]'' the heroes are saved from a terrible fate by an agent of the compassionate, all-seeing [[Louis XIV|king]] — the same king that held Molière's career and livelihood in his hands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novelguide.com/a/discover/dfs_18/dfs_18_00023.html "Tartuffe: Novel Guide"]. 2003. Retrieved 2&amp;nbsp;November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot device==
[[Aristotle]] was the first to use a Greek term equivalent to the Latin phrase ''deus ex machina'' as a term to describe the technique as a device to resolve the plot of tragedies.&lt;ref name=machine /&gt; It is generally deemed undesirable in writing and often implies a lack of creativity on the part of the author. The reasons for this are that it does not pay due regard to the story's internal logic (although it is sometimes deliberately used to do this) and is often so unlikely that it challenges [[suspension of disbelief]], allowing the author to conclude the story with an unlikely, though perhaps more palatable, ending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.cn.edu/kwheeler/lit_terms_D.html |title=Literary Terms and Definitions: D |author= Dr. L. Kip Wheeler |accessdate=2008-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples===
In H. G. Wells's ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'', the Martians, who have destroyed everything in their path and apparently triumphed over humanity, are killed by bacteria.&lt;ref name=Greenwood&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Westfahl |editor1-first=Gary |title=The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy: Themes, Works, and Wonders, Volume 1 |date=2005 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |isbn=0313329516 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=SQMQQyIaACYC&amp;pg=PA195 195] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the novel ''[[Lord of the Flies]]'', the rescue of the savage children by a passing navy officer (which author [[William Golding]] called a "gimmick") is viewed by some critics as a ''deus ex machina''. The abrupt ending conveys the terrible fate that would have afflicted the children (in particular Ralph) if the officer had not arrived at that moment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=William Golding's Lord of the Flies |editor-last=Bloom |editor-first=Harold |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j1ZJcFqQ7V8C&amp;pg=PA67&amp;lpg=PA67&amp;dq=Lord+of+the+Flies,+deus+ex+machina |pages=67–68 |chapter=Grief, grief, grief: ''Lord of the Flies'' |first=Lawrence S. |last=Friedman |publisher=Infobase Publishing |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[J. R. R. Tolkien]] referred to the [[Eagle (Middle-earth)|Great Eagles]] that appear in several places in ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' as "a dangerous 'machine'."&lt;ref&gt;J. R. R. Tolkien, letter 210 as quoted [http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Eagles here]&lt;/ref&gt;. This was in a letter refusing permission to a film adapter to have the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] transported by eagles rather than traveling on foot. He felt that the eagles had already been overused as a plot device. For example, in ''[[The Hobbit]]'', the eagles save [[Bilbo Baggins]], [[Gandalf]], and the dwarves from the goblins and wargs, then help turn the tide of the [[Battle of the Five Armies]], and in ''[[The Return of the King]]'' they save [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] and [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] from certain death on Mount Doom. In the [[Harvard Lampoon]]'s parody [[Bored of the Rings]], the eagles are referred to as 'Deus ex Machina Airlines.'

''Deus ex machina'' was also used by [[Charles Dickens]] in ''[[Oliver Twist]]'', when in the very peak of climax, Rose Maylie turns out to be the long-lost sister of Agnes, and therefore Oliver's aunt; and she marries her long-time sweetheart Harry, allowing Oliver to live happily with his saviour, Mr. Brownlow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Glossary of Literary Terms |editor-last=Abrams |editor-first=MH |url=http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/glossary-of-literary-terms-m-h-abrams/1100175018?ean=9780495898023 |pages=44–45 |publisher=Harcourt Brace &amp; Company, USA |year=1993 |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The ''deus ex machina'' device has many criticisms attached to it, mainly referring to it as inartistic, too convenient, and overly simplistic. On the other hand, champions of the device say that it opens up ideological and artistic possibilities.&lt;ref name="ghosts"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Breton |first1=Rob |title=Ghosts in the Machina: Plotting in Chartist and Working-Class Fiction |journal=Victorian Studies |date=Summer 2005 |volume=47 |issue=4 |pages=557–575 |doi=10.1353/vic.2006.0003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient criticism===
[[Antiphanes (comic poet)|Antiphanes]] was one of the device's earliest critics. Antiphanes believed that the use of the ''deus ex machina'' was a sign that the playwright was unable to properly manage the complications of his plot. 
{{quote|when they don't know what to say

and have completely given up on the play

just like a finger they lift the machine

and the spectators are satisfied.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Handley |first1=Miriam |title=Shaw's response to the deus ex machina: From the Quintessence of Ibsenism to ''Heartbreak House'' |publisher=Theatre: Ancient &amp; Modern, January 1999 Conference |accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Another critical reference to the device can be found in [[Plato]]'s dialogue ''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'', 425d, though it is made in the context of an argument unrelated to drama.

[[Aristotle]] criticized the device in his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', where he argued that the resolution of a plot must arise internally, following from previous action of the play:&lt;ref&gt;Janko (1987, 20)&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|In the characters too, exactly as in the structure of the incidents, [the poet] ought always to seek what is either necessary or probable, so that it is either necessary or probable that a person of such-and-such a sort say or do things of the same sort, and it is either necessary or probable that this [incident] happen after that one. It is obvious that the solutions of plots too should come about as a result of the plot itself, and not from a contrivance, as in the ''Medea'' and in the passage about sailing home in the ''[[Iliad]]''. A contrivance must be used for matters outside the drama — either previous events which are beyond human knowledge, or later ones that need to be foretold or announced. For we grant that the gods can see everything. There should be nothing improbable in the incidents; otherwise, it should be outside the tragedy, e.g., that in [[Sophocles]]' ''[[Oedipus Rex|Oedipus]]''. |''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' |(1454a33–1454b9) }}

Aristotle praised Euripides, however, for generally ending his plays with bad fortune, which he viewed as correct in tragedy, and somewhat excused the intervention of a deity by suggesting that "astonishment" should be sought in tragic drama:&lt;ref&gt;''Poetics'' 11.5, Penguin (1996, 45).&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Irrationalities should be referred to what people say: That is one solution, and also sometimes that it is not irrational, since it is probable that improbable things will happen.}}

Such a device was referred to by [[Horace]] in his ''[[Ars Poetica (Horace)|Ars Poetica]]'' (lines 191–2), where he instructs poets that they should never resort to a "god from the machine" to resolve their plots "unless a difficulty worthy of a god's unraveling should happen" [''nec deus intersit, nisi dignus uindice nodus inciderit; nec quarta loqui persona laboret''].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/learning/essay/237830?page=3 |title=Ars Poetica by Horace |date=21 September 2017 |website=Poetry Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern criticism===
Following Aristotle, Renaissance critics continued to view the ''deus ex machina'' as an inept plot device, although it continued to be employed by Renaissance dramatists.

Towards the end of the 19th century, [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] criticized [[Euripides]] for making tragedy an optimistic [[genre]] via use of the device, and was highly skeptical of the "Greek cheerfulness", prompting what he viewed as the plays' "blissful delight in life".&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche (2003, 85).&lt;/ref&gt; The ''deus ex machina'' as Nietzsche saw it was symptomatic of [[Socrates|Socratic]] culture, which valued knowledge over [[Apollonian and Dionysian|Dionysiac]] music and ultimately caused the death of tragedy:&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche (2003, 84–86).&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote| But the new non-Dionysiac spirit is most clearly apparent in the ''endings'' of the new dramas. At the end of the old tragedies there was a sense of metaphysical conciliation without which it is impossible to imagine our taking delight in tragedy; perhaps the conciliatory tones from another world echo most purely in ''[[Oedipus at Colonus]]''. Now, once tragedy had lost the genius of music, tragedy in the strictest sense was dead: for where was that metaphysical consolation now to be found? Hence an earthly resolution for tragic dissonance was sought; the hero, having been adequately tormented by fate, won his well-earned reward in a stately marriage and tokens of divine honour. The hero had become a gladiator, granted freedom once he had been satisfactorily flayed and scarred. Metaphysical consolation had been ousted by the ''deus ex machina''.|Friedrich Nietzsche}}
Nietzsche argued that the ''deus ex machina'' creates a false sense of consolation that ought not to be sought in phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche (2003, 80).&lt;/ref&gt; His denigration of the plot device has prevailed in critical opinion.
 
In [[Arthur Woollgar Verrall]]'s publication ''Euripides the Rationalist'' (1895), he surveyed and recorded other late 19th century responses to the device. He recorded that some of the critical responses to the term referred to it as 'burlesque', 'coup de théâtre', and 'catastrophe'. Verrall notes that critics have a dismissive response to authors who deploy the device in their writings. He comes to the conclusion that critics feel that the ''deus ex machina'' is evidence of the author's attempt to ruin the whole of his work and prevent anyone from putting any importance on his work.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

However, other scholars have looked at Euripides' use of ''deus ex machina'' and described its use as an integral part of the plot designed for a specific purpose. Often Euripides' plays would begin with gods, so it is argued that it would be natural for the gods to finish the action. The conflict throughout Euripides' plays would be caused by the meddling of the gods and therefore would make sense to both the playwright and the audience of the time that the gods would resolve all conflict that they began.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Abel |first1=D. Herbert |title=Euripides' Deus ex Machina: Fault or Excellence |journal=The Classical Journal |date=December 1954 |volume=50 |issue=3 |pages=127–130 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Half of Euripides' eighteen extant plays end with the use of ''deus ex machina'', therefore it was not simply a device to relieve the playwright of the embarrassment of a confusing plot ending. This device enabled him to bring about a natural and more dignified dramatic and tragic ending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Flickinger |first1=Roy Caston |title=The Greek Theatre and its Drama |date=1926 |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago, Illinois}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other champions of the device believe that it can be a spectacular agent of subversion. It can be used to undercut generic conventions and challenge cultural assumptions and the privileged role of tragedy as a literary/theatrical model.&lt;ref name=ghosts /&gt;

Some 20th-century revisionist criticism suggests that ''deus ex machina'' cannot be viewed in these simplified terms, and contends that the device allows mortals to "probe" their relationship with the divine.&lt;ref name="Rehm 1992, 71"&gt;Rehm (1992, 71).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rush Rehm]] in particular cites examples of Greek tragedy in which the ''deus ex machina'' complicates the lives and attitudes of characters confronted by the deity, while simultaneously bringing the drama home to its audience.&lt;ref name="Rehm 1992, 71" /&gt; Sometimes, the unlikeliness of the ''deus ex machina'' plot device is employed deliberately. For example, comic effect is created in a scene in ''[[Monty Python's Life of Brian]]'' when Brian, who lives in [[Judea]] at the time of [[Christ]], is saved from a high fall by a passing [[ancient astronauts|alien space ship]].&lt;ref&gt;James Berardinelli, James.

'''Didacticism''' is a philosophy that emphasizes instructional and informative qualities in [[literature]] and other types of [[art]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/2940819/Whats_Wrong_with_Didacticism What’s Wrong with Didacticism?] Academia.edu, Retrieved 30 Oct 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://coursesite.uhcl.edu/HSH/Whitec/terms/D/didactic.htm Didactic Literature or Didacticism], [[University of Houston–Clear Lake]], Retrieved 30 Oct 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The term has its origin in the [[Ancient Greek]] word διδακτικός (''didaktikos''), "related to [[education]] and teaching", and signified learning in a fascinating and intriguing manner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://repository.upenn.edu/dissertations/AAI8315998/ RELIGIOUS AWAKENING STORIES IN LATE MEDIEVAL JAPAN: THE DYNAMICS OF DIDACTICISM], Retrieved 30 Oct 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Didactic art was meant both to entertain and to instruct. Didactic plays, for instance, were intended to convey a moral theme or other rich truth to the audience.&lt;ref&gt;[http://literarydevices.net/didacticism/ Didacticism in Morality Plays], Retrieved 30 Oct 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uncp.edu/home/canada/work/allam/general/glossary.htm#d Glossary of Literary Terms] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103044158/http://www.uncp.edu/home/canada/work/allam/general/glossary.htm |date=2013-11-03 }}, The University of North Carolina at Pembroke, Retrieved 30 Oct 2013&lt;/ref&gt; An example of didactic writing is [[Alexander Pope]]'s ''[[An Essay on Criticism]]'' (1711), which offers a range of advice about critics and criticism. An example of didactism in music is the chant ''[[Ut queant laxis]]'', which was used by [[Guido of Arezzo]] to teach [[Solfège|solfege]] syllables.

Around the 19th century the term ''didactic'' came to also be used as a criticism for work that appears to be overburdened with instructive, factual, or otherwise educational information, to the detriment of the enjoyment of the reader (a meaning that was quite foreign to Greek thought). [[Edgar Allan Poe]] called didacticism the worst of "heresies" in his essay ''[[The Poetic Principle]]''.

==Examples==
Some instances of didactic literature include:
* ''[[Works and Days]]'', by [[Hesiod]] (c.&amp;nbsp;700 BC) 
* ''[[On Horsemanship]]'', by [[Xenophon]] (c.&amp;nbsp;350 BC)

The '''Driehaus Architecture Prize''', fully named '''''The Richard H. Driehaus Prize at the University of Notre Dame''''', is a global award to honor a major contributor in the field of contemporary [[Vernacular architecture|vernacular]] and [[classical architecture]], commonly referred to as [[New Classical architecture]]. The Driehaus Prize was conceived as an alternative to the predominantly modernist [[Pritzker Prize]].

It was initiated by [[Investment management|fund manager]] and philanthropist [[Richard Driehaus]] and established in 2003 by the ''Richard H. Driehaus Charitable Lead Trust''. It is presented annually through the classical-teaching [[Notre Dame School of Architecture|School of Architecture]] at the [[University of Notre Dame]] in [[Indiana]], [[United States]].

The most recent prize winners of 2018 are Marc Breitman and Nada Breitman-Jakov, who received the award during a ceremony on March 24 in [[Chicago]].&lt;ref name="2018winner"&gt;{{cite web|title=Marc Breitman and Nada Breitman-Jakov: 2018 Richard H.

The jury also awards the [[Henry Hope Reed Award]] (given in conjunction with the Driehaus Prize) to an individual working outside the practice of architecture, who has supported the cultivation of the traditional city, its architecture and art through writing, planning or promotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Driehaus Prize Nomination Process|url=http://architecture.nd.edu/about/driehaus-prize/nomination-process/|publisher=University of Notre Dame School of Architecture|accessdate=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2018 Reed Award is given to the German chair of the Society for Rebuilding [[Neumarkt (Dresden)|Dresden's New Market]] (GHND),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neumarkt-dresden.de Neumarkt Dresden Society GHND]&lt;/ref&gt; Torsten Kulke.&lt;ref name="reed2018"&gt;{{cite web|title=Henry Hope Reed Award Recipient 2018: GHND chair Torsten Kulke|url=https://architecture.nd.edu/news-events/events/henry-hope-reed-award/recipients/torsten-kulke/|publisher=University of Notre Dame|accessdate=22 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Award==
The Driehaus Prize is awarded to a living [[architect]] whose work embodies the principles of traditional and classical architecture and [[urbanism]] in contemporary society, and reflects what the jury considers positive cultural, environmental and artistic impacts.  The award itself is a bronze miniature of the [[Choragic Monument of Lysicrates]], known as the first use of the [[Corinthian order]] on the outside of a building.&lt;ref&gt;[http://architecture.nd.edu/about/driehaus-prize/chroegic-monument/ Choragic Monument, bronze miniature for Driehaus Prize] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20140329225714/http://architecture.nd.edu/about/driehaus-prize/chroegic-monument/ |date=2014-03-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The award includes a monetary prize of US$200,000.

The award jury annually selects an architect who has greatly influenced the field of traditional and classical architecture. The jury travels together to a city of architectural significance, exploring it together, and taking the city’s urban fabric as a backdrop for its deliberations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Driehaus Prize Jury|url=http://architecture.nd.edu/about/driehaus-prize/jury/|publisher=University of Notre Dame School of Architecture|accessdate=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The jury has included notable architects and educators such as [[Adele Chatfield-Taylor]] (since 2004, President Emerita of the [[American Academy in Rome]]), [[Robert S. Davis]] (since 2009, developer and co-founder of [[Seaside, Florida]]), [[Paul Goldberger]] (since 2006, former architecture critic for ''[[The New Yorker]]''), [[Léon Krier]] (since 2005, inaugural Driehaus Prize recipient), [[Witold Rybczynski]] (since 2011, architecture critic and professor of urbanism at the [[University of Pennsylvania]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pier Carlo Bontempi Named 2014 Driehaus Laureate - Jury|url=http://www.archdaily.com/456165/pier-carlo-bontempi-named-2014-driehaus-laureate/|work=ArchDaily|accessdate=29 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Demetri Porphyrios]] (since 2013, is a [[Greece|Greek]] architect and author who practices architecture in [[London]] as principal of the firm Porphyrios Associates),&lt;ref name="Dame"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://architecture.nd.edu/news-events/events/driehaus-prize/jury/|title=Jury // School of Architecture // University of Notre Dame|last=Dame|first=Marketing Communications: Web // University of Notre|website=School of Architecture|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk]] (since 2017, founder of DPZ).&lt;ref name="Dame"/&gt;

In 2012, [[Charles, Prince of Wales]] accepted The Richard H. Driehaus Prize at the University of Notre Dame Patronage Award during a ceremony Jan. 27 at [[St James's Palace]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dame|first1=Marketing Communications: Web // University of Notre|title=Prince Charles honored for his architectural patronage|url=https://news.nd.edu/news/prince-charles-honored-for-his-architectural-patronage/|website=Notre Dame News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Driehaus, the founder, chief investment officer and chairman of Driehaus Capital Management in Chicago, established the award program through Notre Dame in 2003 because of its reputation as a national leader in incorporating the ideals of traditional and classical architecture into the task of modern urban development. In 2007, Driehaus announced that he would increase the prize monies given out annually through the Driehaus Prize and the Reed Award to a combined $250,000. The two prizes represent the most significant recognition for classicism in the contemporary built environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Driehaus Prize and Henry Hope Reed Award Double to a Combined $250,000|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/driehaus-prize-and-henry-hope-reed-award-double-to-a-combined-250000-58770782.html|publisher=PR Newswire|accessdate=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Freemium Isn't Free'''" is the sixth episode in the [[South Park (season 18)|eighteenth season]] of the American animated television series ''[[South Park]]''. The 253rd episode overall, it was written and directed by series co-creator and co-star [[Trey Parker]]. The episode premiered on [[Comedy Central]] in the United States on November 5, 2014. The episode lampoons the popularity of [[freemium]] mobile apps such as ''[[The Simpsons: Tapped Out]]''&lt;ref name="Crave Online"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tamburro|first1=Paul|title=South Park Trashes "Freemium" Games Like The Simpsons: Tapped Out|url=http://www.craveonline.com/gaming/articles/785185-south-park-trashes-freemium-games-like-simpsons-tapped|website=[[CraveOnline]]|date=November 6, 2014|accessdate=July 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DVD commentary"/&gt; and ''[[Family Guy: The Quest for Stuff]]''.&lt;ref name="DVD commentary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="polygon.com"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kuchera|first1=Ben|title=South Park's free-to-play jokes were based on a Family Guy game|url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/11/12/7203487/south-park-freemium-family-guy|website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=November 12, 2014|accessdate=May 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The episode links [[addiction]] to freemium games to other addictions, including [[alcoholism]] and [[gambling addiction]], and their possible genetic predisposition.

The episode was nominated for the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program]] at the [[67th Primetime Emmy Awards]].

==Plot==
[[List of students at South Park Elementary#Jimmy Valmer|Jimmy]] runs into [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] at school and tells him about the newest game, a mobile app (which closely resembles the game ''Family Guy: The Quest for Stuff''&lt;ref name="polygon.com"/&gt;) based on [[List of recurring South Park characters#Terrance and Phillip|Terrance and Phillip]], and encourages Kyle to download it, since it is free. As Kyle plays, he discovers that the game offers freemium upgrades. In [[Canada]], the Prince of Canada and the Minister of Mobile Gaming are amazed at the profits they are getting, when Terrance and Phillip enter, angry that their likenesses have been used to make a game without consulting them and how it is not free, since it charges premiums. The Prince and Minister disclose they have purposefully created a boring game based on the concept of [[role-playing video game|mobile RPGs]], and that everyone is doing it.

[[Randy and Sharon Marsh]] yell at [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] for spending $489 on the app. Randy worries that Stan may have a gambling problem due to [[List of South Park families#Grampa Marsh|Grampa Marvin Marsh]] having [[compulsive gambling]] issues, as Sharon accuses Randy of having his own compulsive issues with alcohol. Terrance and Phillip begrudgingly accept that since everyone is making boring games and getting [[micropayment]]s for them, then it must be acceptable. Stan is visited by Kyle, [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]], and [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] because Stan skipped school just to play. They realize that Jimmy told them all about the game. Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny confront Jimmy and make him admit that he is being paid to push the game to others. Terrance and Phillip raise concerns about people spending too much money on micropayments, so the Prince and the Minister agree to fund a campaign to play the game in moderation, much like [[alcohol advertising|alcohol industry advertisements]] do. Randy takes Stan to see Marvin, who is addicted to a [[slot machine]], and then confronts Stan and Marvin about their obsessive personalities, as Marvin retorts that Randy is obsessive about alcohol. Stan and Grampa agree to stop their addictive spending.

Jimmy confesses that he has been pushing the game like a drug dealer because he is addicted to another freemium game, and compares freemium games to drug addictions.  Stan gets multiple text alerts about the game and cannot stop himself from playing again, now having charged over $26,000, while Randy's alcohol consumption increases. Stan goes to Kyle, Cartman, Kenny, and Jimmy for help. Jimmy encourages Stan to seek out a higher power for help, much like [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] and other similar [[twelve-step program]]s. Kyle makes a convoluted plan to tell people how Canada has been hiring pushers to get people addicted, but Cartman instead just [[tweet (Twitter)|tweets]] the information, and it starts [[Twitter#Trending topics|trending]]. Terrance and Phillip again are angered, as the Minister reveals that he had always planned to exploit the addictive nature of people with the game. Stan prays for help, but is visited by [[Satan]], who explains to him what addictions are.

As Terrance and Phillip continue to listen to the Minister explain his plan, the Minister reveals himself to be the Canadian devil, Beelzaboot (a [[portmanteau]] of [[beelzebub]] and the [[Canadian raising]] pronunciation of "about"). Satan realizes that the game is from Canada, so he possesses Stan, then heads to Canada to battle Beelzaboot. Satan defeats Beelzaboot, and Stan is returned to South Park unharmed. The Prince vows to never produce any more freemium games. While Stan and Marvin play board games to counter their addictive natures, Randy offers to place bets on the outcome.

==Production==
[[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]] called "Freemium Isn't Free" their favorite episode of the season.&lt;ref name="The Magic Bush Commentary"&gt;{{cite serial|title= [[South Park (season 18)|South Park: Season 18]]|episode=[[The Magic Bush]]|series=[[South Park]]|last=Parker|first=Trey|authorlink=Trey Parker|last2=Stone|first2=Matt|authorlink2=Matt Stone|network=[[Comedy Central]]|airdate=September 24 – December 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the DVD audio commentary for this episode, they discussed how the episode formed. Parker and Stone had been pitched by several different companies on the idea of creating a freemium mobile game based on the ''South Park'' franchise. They were unsure about actually creating the game because they thought the types of games freemium games usually result in were "pretty offensive" in shamelessly asking for money so they decided to do a "shit load of research". During this time, they decided to go ahead and make an episode that revolves around freemium games. The research Parker and Stone did was originally only for fully understanding freemium games but because they had decided to make this episode, the research was very beneficial for the episode.&lt;ref name="DVD commentary"&gt;{{cite serial|title=[[South Park (season 18)|South Park: Season 18]]|episode= Freemium Isn't Free|series=[[South Park]]|last=Parker|first=Trey|authorlink=Trey Parker|last2=Stone|first2=Matt|authorlink2=Matt Stone|network=[[Comedy Central]]|airdate=September 24 – December 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The episode generally received above average reviews from critics. The episode received a B− rating from ''[[The A.V. Club]]''{{'}}s Josh Modell, though he felt that it "dragged a lot".&lt;ref name="A.V. Club Review"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Modell|first1=Josh|title=Review: South Park: "Freemium Isn't Free"|url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/south-park-freemium-isnt-free-211498|website=[[The A.V. Club]]|accessdate=November 6, 2014|date=November 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[IGN]]'s contributor Max Nicholson gave the episode a 7.5 out of 10, commenting that "it took awhile for this episode to  get off the ground, but once it did, it was pretty entertaining".&lt;ref name="IGN Review"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nicholson|first1=Max|title=South Park: "Freemium Isn't Free" Review|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/06/south-park-freemium-isnt-free-review|website=[[IGN]]|accessdate=November 6, 2014|date=November 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Chris Longo from [[Den of Geek]] only gave the episode 2 out of 5 stars, calling the episode, along with the previous week's episode "[[The Magic Bush]]", "the two weakest episodes of the season".&lt;ref name="Den of Geek Review"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Longo|first1=Chris|title=South Park: Freemium Isn't Free Review|url=http://www.denofgeek.us/tv/south-park/241048/south-park-freemium-isn-t-free-review|website=[[Den of Geek]]|accessdate=November 7, 2014|date=November 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Gaiety Theatre''' is a [[public hall]] in [[Naka-ku, Yokohama|Naka-ku]], [[Yokohama]], Japan. It was built in 1866 by [[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[merchant]] MJB Noordhoek Hegt behind his office at Settlement plot 68. An amateur dramatic club was organized and performed at the public hall. Hegt rented the hall at a very reasonable price for the dramatic club's performances but it soon proved to be too small and was also being used for many other activities so, in 1870, another small theater was built on Honmachi Street and became the original Gaiety Theatre.

This theatre also proved to be too small for the expanding audiences and in 1885 a new building was built on the crest of the Bluff at 256 [[Yamate]] and most performances moved to this new building. A touring theatre company led by George Crichton Miln gave some of the first full performances in Japan of [[Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] plays in English at the Gaiety Theatre in 1891.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wells|first1=Stanley|title=Shakespeare For All Time|date=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0-19-516093-2|page=335}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1908 this building was renamed as the Yamanote Gaiety Theatre, completely replaced the small Gaiety Theatre on Honmachi Street. Performances continued at this location until the Gaiety Theatre was completely destroyed in the [[1923 Great Kantō earthquake]].

The Gaiety Theatre was not rebuilt after the earthquake and dramatic performances in Yokohama were all but forgotten. In 1980, Iwasaki Gakuen Academy built a museum at 256 Yamate to commemorate the school's 50th anniversary. During construction of this museum bricks from the original Gaiety Theater were discovered and used in the construction. The museum includes theatre space which available for public use and displays of props and clothing used for performances at the original Gaiety Theatre.

'''Gazi''' ({{Lang-el|Γκάζι}}, {{IPA-el|ˈga.zi|pron}}; formerly Γκαζοχώρι ''Gazochori'' or Φωταέριο ''Fotaerio'') is a [[neighborhood]] of [[Athens]], [[Greece]]. It surrounds the old Athens [[gasworks]], which is the industrial museum and exhibition space [[Technopolis (Gazi)|"Technopolis"]], widely known as Gazi, next to [[Kerameikos|Keramikos]] and close to the [[Acropolis]].

==History==

The old [[gasworks]] was founded in 1857. Around 1910, several [[brothel]]s were set up in the area, a fact which led to brothels in general being referred to as 'Gazi'.

During the mid-20th century, small dwellings with few rooms and large gardens began to spring up around the gasworks. These were generally home to large, poor families from Athens. Gazi was a deprived area but despite this, there was no associated high crime rate. The area was mainly inhabited by crate makers.

In 1967, due to difficuly socioeconomic conditions in [[northern Greece]], many [[Muslim minority of Greece|Muslim]] families established a presence in the area, working at the gasworks.

Over the years, numerous garages, paint shops, tinsmiths and spare parts shops opened up in the area.

==Modern era==

Most of the brothels, which the area was known for in the past, have moved north to [[Omonoia Square|Omonoia]].

To this day, there is a heavy Muslim presence in the area. A 'multicultural' school exists in the area, the 87th Elementary School of Athens, with a student body comprising 70% [[Islam|Muslim]], 20% [[Greek Orthodox]] and 10% [[Albanian communities in Greece|Albanian]] and [[Romanians in Greece|Romanians]].

Gazi is home to the [[Technopolis (Gazi)|Technopolis]] of [[Athens]], that spreads in an area of about 30,000 m2, an industrial museum of modern architecture.

Since the start of the 21st century, Gazi has been home to numerous [[gay bar|gay]] and lesbian bars and several new clubs, cafeterias and restaurants in general, establishing itself as an [[entertainment district]].

[[Kerameikos metro station]] on [[Line 3 (Athens Metro)|Line 3]] of the [[Athens Metro]] is adjacent to the Technopolis of Gazi.

The '''Herrerian style''' ({{lang-es|estilo herreriano}} or ''arquitectura herreriana'') of [[architecture]] was developed in [[Spain]] during the last third of the 16th century under the reign of [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] (1556-1598), and continued in force in the 17th century, but transformed by the [[Baroque]] current of the time. It corresponds to the third and final stage of the [[Spanish Renaissance]] architecture, which evolved into a progressive purification ornamental, from the initial [[plateresque]] to classical [[Purism (architecture)|purism]] of the second third of the 16th century and total nudity decorative that introduced the Herrerian style.

It originated with the construction of the [[El Escorial|Monastery of El Escorial]] ([[San Lorenzo de El Escorial]], [[Community of Madrid]]) and, more specifically, with the reorganization of the project made by [[Cantabria]]n architect [[Juan de Herrera]] (1530-1597), after the death of [[Juan Bautista de Toledo]] (1515-1567), author of the first design.

Its main representatives are the mentioned Herrera, who the style owes its name, and [[Francisco de Mora]] (1553-1610), disciple of the anterior and architect of the [[Lerma Ducal Palace|Ducal Palace of Lerma]] ([[Lerma, Burgos|Lerma]], [[Province of Burgos]]), other key works of Herrerian architecture.

== Features ==

The Herrerian architecture, or Herrerian style is characterized by its [[Geometry|geometric]] rigor, the mathematical relation between the various architectural features, the clean volumes, the dominance of the wall over the span and the almost total absence of decoration, which is why in time was called '''desornamentaded style'''. Is also known as '''escorial style''', referring to the building that serves as best example for the architectural style.

The Herrerian buildings are noted for its severe horizontality, achieved through the balance of forms, preferably cubic, which are arranged symmetrically in the structure. Usually have wooden roofs covered with [[slate]] in the exterior and side towers, tipped with pointed toes pyramidal spire, which introduce an element of verticality, while helping to reinforce the sense of grandeur and elevation.

At other cases, not looking both the horizontal and the bulkiness, which is reached through the geometrical design of the various architectural elements. This is the case of the model used in the construction of parish churches, with great facades, quadrangular towers and heavy [[buttress]]es.

It is, in most cases, works of great size, imposing in its environment and impress with its austere and monumental air.

In regard to decorative applications, these reduce the use of basic geometric shapes such as [[sphere]]s and [[pyramid]]s. From a [[Sociology|sociological]] standpoint, this sobriety is a response to [[Protestantism]], in line with the guidelines set by the [[Council of Trent]] (1545-1563).

== Historical development ==

The Herrerian style was the official architecture of the [[Habsburg Spain|Habsburg]]s, from the reign of [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]]. The sociopolitical impact meant the construction of the [[El Escorial|Monastery of El Escorial]] (1563-1584) facilitated its expansion. To this contributed also the fact that [[Juan de Herrera]] was appointed in 1579 Inspector of Monuments of the Crown.

The style spread through first in the [[comarcas of Madrid]] of the [[Sierra de Guadarrama]], located within the catchment area of the Monastery of El Escorial, through two ways: works directly funded by the Royal Family and those promoted by the Guadarraman municipalities.

The first category covers infrastructure such as the [[Puente Nuevo (Galapagar)|Puente Nuevo]], in [[Galapagar]], and buildings for private use by [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]], as the Casa Veleta, also in the same town, and the [[Real Aposento de Torrelodones]], both disappeared. Were built for comfort the movements of the King from [[Madrid]] to the [[Real Sitio de San Lorenzo de El Escorial y El Escorial|Real Sitio de El Escorial]].

In [[El Escorial, Madrid|El Escorial Town]], the Crown encouraged the development of various urban planning and the construction of the [[Iglesia de San Bernabé (El Escorial)|Church of San Bernabé]], by Francisco de Mora, one of the contributors to Herrera in the works of the Royal Monastery.

The Royal Family also approved the granting of benefits to those municipalities to proceed with the renovation of its main public and religious buildings. The result of this measure is the currently Herrerian aspect of the parish churches of [[Valdemorillo]] and [[Navalagamella]], both of [[medieval]] origin.

The Herrerian style quickly spread throughout [[Spain]] and [[Americas|America]]. Some representative works are the [[Cathedral of Valladolid]] and the [[Puente de Segovia (Madrid)|Puente de Segovia]] ([[Madrid]]), both designed by [[Juan de Herrera]]; the church of the [[Monasterio de Uclés]] ([[Uclés]], Cuenca Province), by [[Francisco de Mora]]; the [[Church of San Sebastián (Villacastín)|Church of San Sebastián]] ([[Villacastín]], Segovia Province), attributed to [[Rodrigo Gil de Hontañón]]; the [[Colegiata de San Luis]] ([[Villagarcía de Campos]], Valladolid Province), by the same author; and the [[College of Our Lady of Antigua]] ([[Monforte de Lemos]], Lugo Province) by Simón de Monasterio.

Special mention deserves the [[Ducal Palace of Lerma|Ducal Palace]] of Lerma (Burgos Province), by [[Francisco de Mora]] that began in 1601. Led to the adoption of the emerging Herrerian style  by the emerging [[Baroque]] trends of the time and the establishment of a palatial architecture model, which was repeated throughout the 17th century.

Most civic buildings erected in [[Madrid]] during the reign of [[Philip III of Spain|Philip III]] and [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip IV]] continued the architectural guidelines of that palace. This is the case of the [[Palace of the Councils, Madrid|Palacio de los Concejos]], the [[Santa Cruz Palace, Madrid|Palacio de Santa Cruz]] and the [[Plaza de la Villa|Casa de la Villa]], all of baroque bill, but with notable Herrerian reminiscent.

The influence of Herrerian style is also visible in the expansion that, separately, had its distinctive spire pyramidal or "madrilian spire", with slate roofs. This item was adopted by many constructions after to 16th and 17th century, mainly in the bell towers and [[dome]]s of the churches, and in many civil constructions.

The 18th and 19th century meant the decline of this architectural movement. In the 20th century came to pick up, during the [[Francoist Spain|dictatorship of Francisco Franco]]. The Plaza de la Moncloa, in [[Madrid]], chaired by [[Spanish Air Force|Air Force]] headquarters, among many large constructions of the time, symbolizes the resurgence of Herrerian architecture.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9705">{{Other uses|In Medias Res (disambiguation)}}
A narrative work beginning '''''in medias res''''' ({{IPA-la|ɪn mɛdiaːs reːs|classical}}&lt;!-- n assimilated to labial of next word --&gt;, lit. "into the middle of things"&lt;!--in+acc (preposition) "into", medias (adjective, acc plural, from medius) "middle", res (noun, acc plural, from res) "things"--&gt;) opens in the midst of the plot (cf. ''[[ab ovo]]'', ''[[ab initio]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/284369/in-medias-res |title= In medias res |publisher= ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' |accessdate= July 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, [[Exposition (narrative)|exposition]] is bypassed and filled in gradually, either through dialogue, [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]] or description of past events. For example, ''[[Hamlet]]'' begins after the death of Hamlet's father. Characters make reference to King Hamlet's death without the plot's first establishment of said fact. Since the play focuses on Hamlet and the revenge itself more so than the motivation, Shakespeare utilizes ''in medias res'' to bypass superfluous exposition.

Works that employ ''in medias res'' often, though not always, will subsequently use flashback and [[nonlinear narrative]] for exposition of earlier events in order to fill in the [[backstory]]. For example, in Homer's ''[[Odyssey]]'', we first learn about Odysseus's journey when he is held captive on Calypso's island. We then find out, in Books IX through XII, that the greater part of Odysseus's journey precedes that moment in the narrative. On the other hand, Homer's ''[[Iliad]]'' has relatively few flashbacks, although it opens in the thick of the [[Trojan War]].

== First use of the phrase ==
The Roman lyric poet and satirist [[Horace]] (65–8 BC) first used the terms '''''ab ōvō''''' ("from the egg") and '''''in mediās rēs''''' ("into the middle of things") in his ''[[Ars poetica]]'' ("Poetic Arts", c. 13 BC), wherein lines 147&amp;ndash;149 describe the ideal [[epic poetry|epic poet]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Horace |authorlink=Horace  |title=Ars poetica   |url=http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/horace/arspoet.shtml  |language=Latin |quote=nec '''gemino''' bellum Troianum orditur '''ab ovo'''; / semper ad eventum festinat et '''in medias res''' / [...] auditorem rapit}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Nor does he begin the [[Trojan War]] ''from the egg'',
but always he hurries to the action, and snatches the listener ''into the middle of things''. . . .|}}

The "egg" reference is to the [[mythology|mythological]] origin of the [[Trojan War]] in the birth of [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] and [[Clytemnestra]] from the double egg laid by [[Leda (mythology)|Leda]] following her seduction by [[Zeus]] in the guise of a [[swan]].

== Literary history ==

Probably originated in [[oral tradition]], the narrative technique of beginning a story ''in medias res'' is a stylistic convention of [[epic poetry]], the exemplars in Western literature being the ''Iliad'' and the ''Odyssey'' (both 7th century BC), by [[Homer]].&lt;ref name="Murray"&gt;Murray, Christopher John (2004). ''Encyclopedia of the Romantic Era, 1760-1850''. [[Taylor &amp; Francis]]. p. 319. {{ISBN|1-57958-422-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the technique features in the Indian ''[[Mahābhārata]]'' (c. 8th century BC – c. 4th century AD). 

The [[Classics|classical-era]] poet [[Virgil]] (Publius Vergilius Maro, 70–19 BC) continued this literary narrative technique in the ''[[Aeneid]]'', which is part of the Greek literary tradition of imitating [[Homer]].&lt;ref name="Murray"/&gt; Later works featuring ''in medias res'' include the stories "[[Sinbad the Sailor]]" and "[[The Three Apples]]" from the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' (c. 9th century),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights|first=David|last=Pinault|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=1992|isbn=90-04-09530-6|pages=86–94|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the German ''[[Nibelungenlied]]'' (12th century), the Spanish ''[[Cantar de Mio Cid]]'' (c. 14th century), the Italian ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' (1320) by [[Dante Alighieri]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Complete Danteworlds: A Reader's Guide to the Divine Comedy|last=P.

''Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy: The Inferno''. Barron's Educational Series. p. 24. {{ISBN|0-7641-9107-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern novelists known to extensively employ ''in medias res'' in conjunction with flashbacks include [[William Faulkner]] and [[Toni Morrison]].

[[Edgar Allan Poe]]’s [[The Tell-Tale Heart]] is written in medias res.

== Cinematic history ==
It is typical for [[film noir]] to begin ''in medias res''; for example, a private detective will enter the plot already in progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = The Philosophy of Film Noir|first = Deborah|last=Knight|editor1-first = Mark T. |editor1-last = Conard |editor2-first = Robert |editor2-last = Porfirio |publisher = University Press of Kentucky |year = 2007|isbn = 978-0-8131-9181-2 |page = 208}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Crossfire (film)|Crossfire]]'' (1947) opens with the murder of Joseph Samuels. As the police investigate the crime, the story behind the murder is told via flashbacks.&lt;ref name="MayerMcDonnell2007"&gt;

Occasionally, adaptations of source material may employ ''in medias res'' while the original version did not.

'''Italian Baroque''' (or ''Barocco'') is a stylistic period in Italian history and art that spanned from the late [[16th century]] to the early [[18th century]].

==History==
The early 17th century marked a time of change for those of the [[Roman Catholic]] religion, a symbolization of their strength as a congregation and the intelligence of their creative minds. In response to the [[Protestant Reformation]] of the earlier 16th century, Roman Catholics embarked on a program of restoration, a new way of living that became known as the [[Counter Reformation]]. The purpose of the Counter Reformation was aimed at remedying some of the abuses challenged by the Protestants earlier in the century.&lt;ref name="Varriano, 1986"&gt;John Varriano, ''Italian Baroque and Rococo Architecture'', New York:  Oxford University Press, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; Within the church, a renewed Catholic culture was imposed on Italian society. It started with the [[Council of Trent]], imposed by Pope Paul III, a commission of cardinals who came together to address issues of the Catholic Church and regain faith among worshipers.&lt;ref name="Blakemore, 1997"&gt;Blakemore, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in guidelines established by the Church for the commissioning work of artists to communicate biblical truths and ideals.

==Secular construction==
New secular construction resulted from the establishment of pioneering religious orders. Between 1524 and 1575, the [[Barnabite]], [[Jesuit]], [[Oratory of Saint Philip Neri|Oratorian]] and [[Theatine]] orders came into being, and as their influence spread, more and more new churches began being built. By 1725, there were 323 churches in Rome alone, serving a permanent population of fewer than 150,000 people.&lt;ref name="Varriano, 1986"/&gt; Because of this rapid growth in church building, it became the responsibility of these religious orders to spread the word of Catholicism to the population. Religious books were increasingly being printed in Venice for distribution to the clergy and literate worshipers, passed out during mass and offering continuous reminders of the presence of Christ on everyday life.&lt;ref name="Holmes, 1997"&gt;Holmes, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

Churches had now become a place for encouragement- spaces of expansive beauty and decoration.

{{quote|text=They provided exciting imagery that contrasted greatly with the iconoclastic inclinations of the Protestant Reformation led by Martin Luther”.&lt;ref name="Blakemore, 1997"/&gt;}}

The Roman Church realized the power that art could have to inspire and, therefore, they became preoccupied with extravagance and display. Their intent was to overwhelm viewers, catch their attention, and make them want to see more. Entering a [[Baroque]] church where visual space, music and ceremony were combined was a powerful device for securing loyalty of congregations. The bigger and more beautiful the space, the more people wanted to go. Complex geometry, curving and intricate stairway arrangements and large-scale sculptural ornamentation offered a sense of movement and mystery within the space.

[[Il Gesù]] was the first of many Counter-Reformation churches built in Rome; serving as the mother church of the new Jesuit order. Designed by [[Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola]], the church of Il Gesù soon became the prototype for the Baroque churches that the Jesuit order built or rebuilt during the Counter-Reformation era.&lt;ref name="Stokstad, 2005"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Marilyn  Stokstad |title=Art History. ''3rd Edition|location= New Jersey|publisher= Prentice Hall|year= 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interior of the Gesu was a study of the grandeur that Roman classicism could offer when combined with simplicity in large scale. High windows puncture the nave’s barrel vault, as a ring of windows in the drum of the dome bring beams of natural light into the interior, creating a dramatic contrast of light and darkness in relatively dim space.&lt;ref name="Blakemore, 1997"/&gt;

The plan of Il Gesù became the standard for churches for years to come; a breakaway from the ideal central-plan church of the Renaissance into something new. The Latin Cross variation created a greater sense of spatial unification within the space. In his design for the church of Il Gesù, Vignola broadened the nave and made the transepts and side chapels smaller, creating a better and brighter focal point for the main space and allowing more room for the congregation at mass.&lt;ref name="Stokstad, 2005"/&gt; The cultural patronage of the pope in Rome was an extreme case of diversity in comparison with surrounding Italian city-states. The pope served his role as not only the head of the Catholic Church, but as the acting ruler for the city. He [the pope] controlled what was built and who was commissioned to build it.

In 1605, at the very beginning of his pontificate, Pope Paul V commissioned [[Carlo Maderno]] to redesign  [[St. Peter's Basilica]]. It was at the age of 72, in 1546, when [[Michelangelo]] first took hold of the unfinished rebuilding project started by Bramante.&lt;ref name="Holmes, 1997"/&gt; When Michelangelo died, the construction of the, then, Greek-cross section surrounding the Papal altar and the tomb of Peter had been completed only as far as the top of the drum. The dome then became completed, with some modifications, by [[Giacomo della Porta]] in 1590.&lt;ref&gt;Blakemore, 1997, p.143&lt;/ref&gt; It was the continuous debates over the religious and aesthetic benefits of keeping the Greek-cross plan or enhancing the space by extending it into Latin-cross plan that led Paul V to boldly commission for Maderno’s services. Maderno’s  initial projects, including the long nave addition, which created a new Latin-Cross solution upon the ground plan, the façade and the portico, became an instantly recognizable image of Rome and the heart and spirit of Catholic Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Charpentrat| first = Pierre | authorlink = | title = Living Architecture: Baroque| publisher = Oldbourne| year = 1967 | oclc = 59920343 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To settle the problem of excess open space within the updated basilica, Pope Urban VII commissioned Gian Lorenzo [[Bernini]] to design the internal space. Bernini became responsible for much of the internal appearance of the basilica, notably the baldacchino (1624–33) erected over the dome of St. Peter. It acts as a main focal point in the space, combining both sculpture and architecture into a unified art piece. Complex in form and ornate with sculpture, the baldacchino serves as a great example of the Baroque ‘style’, massive and ornate, glorifying the church and the Catholic religion.

This space is an example of ''quadratura'', an attempt to create an illusion through architecture, painting, and sculpture. Painting and sculpture create an illusion of never-ending height and dramatic composition.

==Interiors==
[[Pietro da Cortona]] was one of the painters of the 17th century who employed this illusionist way of painting. Among his most important commissions were the frescoes he painted for the [[Palazzo Barberini|Palace of the Barberini family]]. Pietro da Cortona’s compositions were the largest decorative frescoes executed in Rome since the work of Michelangelo at the [[Sistine Chapel]].&lt;ref name="Holmes, 1997"/&gt;  Harold Osborne, author of ''The Oxford Companion of Art'', comments on his work the ‘Divine Providence’ completed for the Barberini palace:

{{quote|text=This, his most famous painting, is a triumph of illusionism for the centre of the ceiling appears open to the sky and the figures seen from below appear to come down into the room as well as soar out of it”.&lt;ref name="Blakemore, 1997"/&gt;}}

Stucco became one of the overall key characteristics of Baroque interiors, enhancing wall spaces, niches, and ceilings.

It was the reverence for the church that provided funding for more and more building projects which, in turn, brought even more worshipers into the city –as many as five times the permanent population during a [[Holy Year]]. With this boom in tourism, a continuing job opportunity arose for the citizens of Rome. The construction industry in Rome soon became the largest employer in the city.

Throughout Italy inspiring architects received training on-the-job. In most parts of Italy, local architects satisfied building needs, but in Rome architects were specifically commissioned either by the Papal state or family dynasties to work on their projects.&lt;ref name="Varriano, 1986"/&gt; Families associated with the papacy, including the [[Barberini]], [[Borghese]], [[House of Chigi|Chigi]] and [[Pamphili]], were extremely well off and, in turn, some of the richest and grandest villas were constructed for them. Competition between these ruling families meant they rivaled each other in the elaborateness of the detailing in their homes as well as in the churches they supported.&lt;ref name="Blakemore, 1997"/&gt;

The hot climate of Italy influenced the choosing of materials and planning of architecture. For flooring, tile, marble and stone were used; terrazzo flooring, created by chips of marble case into cement, was also sometimes used in interiors. All of these materials helped cool the space. Consideration of geographic location was also examined during construction planning. For example, on average, Sicily receives 1,000 more hours of sunshine each year than Turin.&lt;ref name="Varriano, 1986"/&gt; The facades in Sicilian-built architecture seem extremely massive in comparison to contemporary ones in the Italian mainland. Regional variations like this can be seen throughout Italy, including Rome.

The role of furniture in Roman interiors was to emphasize social status and to simply add a decorative element to the interior. Carving was the preferred method of decorating furniture; while walnut was the primary furniture wood.&lt;ref name="Blakemore, 1997"/&gt; Emphasis for furniture was on carved and turned members, which were elaborately placed on high-back armchairs and tables.

Spatial relationships for the interior in the age of the Baroque changed from the block structure of the Renaissance to more open planning. Grand proportions were typical in Baroque interiors. The salone was given high priority, again with an emphasis on exaggerated decoration, this time incorporating accents into the room at different heights. Niches, entablatures, pediments and wall reliefs created dynamics within the space.

This '''list of books about skepticism''' is a skeptic's library of works centered on [[scientific skepticism]], [[religious skepticism]], [[critical thinking]], [[scientific literacy]], and refutation of claims of the [[paranormal]]. It also includes titles about [[atheism]], [[irreligion]], books for "young skeptics" and related subjects. It is intended as a starting point for research into these areas of study.

Collections in the realm of skepticism, science literacy, and [[freethought]] exist both online and in brick-and-mortar libraries. The complete works of [[Robert G. Ingersoll]] are available online at both the Secular Web&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Robert Green Ingersoll Complete Works|url=http://www.infidels.org/library/historical/robert_ingersoll/|publisher=Secular Web|accessdate=13 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as part of the [[Internet Archive]] project&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Works of Robert G Ingersoll (1900)|url=https://archive.org/details/worksofrobertgin12inge|publisher=Internet Archive|accessdate=13 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Drew University Library hosts a collection of pamphlets by and about Mr. Ingersoll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Heise|first=Jennifer|title=Robert G.

'''''Lobster Trap and Fish Tail''''', a [[mobile (sculpture)|mobile]] by [[United States|American]] artist [[Alexander Calder]], is located at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[United States]]. It is one of Calder's earliest hanging mobiles and "the first to reveal the basic characteristics of the genre that launched his enormous international reputation and popularity."&lt;ref name="lipman"&gt;Lipman, Jean; Franc, Helen Margaret (1976). ''Bright stars: American painting and sculpture since 1776.'' Dutton, {{ISBN|978-0-525-07147-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The sculpture was commissioned by the Advisory Committee for the stairwell of the museum when the new building opened in 1939.&lt;ref name="morgan"&gt;Morgan, Ann Lee (2007). ''The Oxford dictionary of American art and artists, '' p. 73. Oxford University Press US, {{ISBN|978-0-19-512878-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fabricated in [[Roxbury, Connecticut]], the painted steel wire and sheet aluminum sculpture is 8' 6" (260 cm) x 9' 6" (290 cm) in diameter. The sculpture suggests the movement of underwater life.&lt;ref name="moyle"&gt;Moyle, Peter B.; Moyle, Marilyn A. (1992). Fish imagery in art 28: Calder's ''Lobster Trap and Fish Tail''. ''Environmental Biology of Fishes'',  Volume 35, Number 2, 204 {{doi|10.1007/BF00002194}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Calder became a leading exponent of [[kinetic art]], combining his engineering training with his studies of art in New York and Paris. According to a review in the ''[[New York Sun]]'', "There, he became enthralled with the [[biomorphic]] [[surrealism]] of [[Joan Miró]] as well as the powerful [[choreography]] of [[modern dance]] pioneer [[Martha Graham]]."&lt;ref name=finkelstein&gt;Finkelstein, Allix (September 28, 2007). [http://www.nysun.com/arts/intimate-at-moma/63563/ Intimate at MoMA.] ''[[New York Sun]]''&lt;/ref&gt; After experimenting with motorized sculptures, Calder began creating works that moved and floated when touched or exposed to air currents. Calder composed motion with works like ''Lobster Trap and Fish Tail'', "harnessing the performative potential of the mechanical sciences."&lt;ref name=finkelstein/&gt;

The '''''Madonna and Child with Two Angels''''' is a painting by the Italian [[Renaissance]] master [[Sandro Botticelli]], dating to c. 1468-1469. It is now in the [[Museo Nazionale di Capodimonte]], in [[Naples]].&lt;ref&gt;Legouix, 32&lt;/ref&gt;

The work was once attributed to [[Filippino Lippi]], master of Botticelli. The composition essentially derives from Botticelli's master (and [[Filippino Lippi]]'s father) [[Filippo Lippi]].&lt;ref&gt;Legouix, 32&lt;/ref&gt;  The faces and other details suggest around the same period of the ''[[Fortitude (Botticelli)|Fortitude]]'' and the other juvenile Madonnas of the Italian painter. The composition is similar to [[Verrocchio]]'s ''[[The Virgin and Child with Two Angels (Andrea del Verrochio)|Madonna of the Milk]]'', probably dating to a year or two earlier.

In 1968, her mother died of cancer aged 57. After Binchy's father died in 1971, she sold the family house and moved to a [[bedsit]] in Dublin.&lt;ref name="Tel o"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/books-obituaries/9440604/Maeve-Binchy.html|title=Maeve Binchy| work=The Daily Telegraph|date=31 July 2012|accessdate=31 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Israel====
Her parents were Catholics and Binchy attended a [[Convent school#Catholic tradition|convent school]].&lt;ref name="Lynott, Laura"/&gt; However, a trip to Israel profoundly affected both her career and her faith.  As she confided in a Q&amp;A with ''Vulture'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;In 1963, I worked in a Jewish school in Dublin, teaching French with an Irish accent to kids, primarily Lithuanians. The parents there gave me a trip to Israel as a present. I had no money, so I went and worked in a [[kibbutz]] – plucking chickens, picking oranges. My parents were very nervous; here I was going out to the Middle East by myself. I wrote to them regularly, telling them about the kibbutz. My father and mother sent my letters to a newspaper, which published them. So I thought, It's not so hard to be a writer. Just write a letter home. After that, I started writing other travel articles.&lt;ref name="Maeve Binchy Filmography"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ebiri, Bilge"&gt;{{cite news|journal=Vulture|date=14 November 2008|title= Maeve Binchy on 'The Hard Core' and Her Uplifting Next Novel About Heart Failure|author=Ebiri, Bilge |url=http://www.vulture.com/2008/11/maeve_binchy.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One Sunday, attempting to locate where the [[Last Supper]] is supposed to have occurred, she climbed a mountainside to a cavern guarded by a Brooklyn-born Israeli soldier. She wept with despair. The soldier asked, "What'ya expect, ma'am – a Renaissance table set for 13?" She replied, "Yes! That's just what I did expect." This experience caused her to renounce her Catholic faith, and eventually become an atheist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Mary|last=Kenny|authorlink=Mary Kenny|url=http://www.independent.ie/opinion/comment/mary-kenny-maeve-binchy-shunned-the-dark-side-3187635.html|title=Maeve Binchy shunned the dark side|newspaper=[[Irish Independent]]|date=1 August 2012|accessdate=1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Marriage====
Binchy, described as "six feet tall, rather stout, and garrulous",&lt;ref name="Schudel, Matt"/&gt; although she actually grew to 6'1",&lt;ref name="dudgeon"/&gt; confided to [[Gay Byrne]] of ''[[The Late Late Show (Ireland)|The Late Late Show]]'' that, growing up in Dalkey, she never felt herself to be attractive; "as a plump girl I didn't start on an even footing to everyone else".&lt;ref name="Lynch, Donal"&gt;{{cite news|author=Lynch, Donal|date=5 August 2012|title=Donal Lynch: Maeve stirred up love with a long spoon . . .

She continued, "I felt very lonely, the others all had a love waiting for them and I didn't."&lt;ref name="Lynch, Donal"/&gt;

She ultimately encountered the love of her life,&lt;ref name="Lynch, Donal"/&gt; however; when recording a piece for ''Woman's Hour'' in London she met [[Children's literature|children's]] author [[Gordon Snell]], then a freelance producer with the [[BBC]].  Their friendship blossomed into a cross-border romance, with her in Ireland and him in London, until she eventually secured a job in London through ''[[The Irish Times]]''.&lt;ref name="Lynch, Donal"/&gt; She and Snell married in 1977 and, after living in London for a time, moved to Ireland. They lived together in Dalkey, not far from where she had grown up, until Binchy's death.&lt;ref name="official"/&gt; The following was her view of her husband, quoted in ''The Irish Times'' after her death: {{cquote|(A) writer, a man I loved and he loved me and we got married and it was great and is still great. He believed I could do anything, just as my parents had believed all those years ago, and I started to write fiction and that took off fine. And he loved Ireland, and the fax was invented so we writers could live anywhere we liked, instead of living in London near publishers.&lt;ref name=irish_times_death/&gt;}}

====Letter to the president====
Files in [[National Archives of Ireland|Ireland's National Archives]], released to the public in 2006, feature a request from Maeve Binchy to President [[Cearbhall Ó Dálaigh]] asking if he could "receive" her. She wrote, "I know you are extremely busy but I often see in the paper that you 'received' so-and-so and was wondering very simply could I be received too." This request came while she was working for ''The Irish Times'' in London in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2006/1230/1167401848160.html?via=rel|title=Maeve Binchy sought meeting with President|newspaper=[[The Irish Times]]|date=30 December 2006|accessdate=30 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health===
In 2002, Binchy "suffered a health crisis related to a heart condition", which inspired her to write ''Heart and Soul''. The book about (what Binchy terms) "a heart failure clinic"&lt;ref name="Maeve Binchy Filmography"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ebiri, Bilge"/&gt; in [[Dublin]] and the people involved with it, reflects many of her own experiences and observations in the hospital.&lt;ref name="Maeve Binchy Filmography"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ebiri, Bilge"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=4 August 2012|title=Maeve Binchy Dead: Bestselling Irish Author Dies|journal=Huffington Post|author=Barr, Robert |date=30 July 2012|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/31/maeve-binchy-dead-irish-author-obituary_n_1721938.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of her life, Binchy had the following message on her official website: "My health isn't so good these days and I can't travel around to meet people the way I used to. But I'm always delighted to hear from readers, even if it takes me a while to reply."&lt;ref name=bbc_death/&gt;

===Death===
Binchy died on 30 July 2012. She was 73 and had suffered from various maladies, including painful [[osteoarthritis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/republic-of-ireland/author-maeve-binchy-dies-at-72-16191773.html|title=Author Maeve Binchy dies|newspaper=[[The Belfast Telegraph]]|date=31 July 2012|accessdate=31 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the arthritis she had a hip operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Anne|last=McHardy|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jul/31/maeve-binchy?intcmp=239|title=Maeve Binchy obituary|newspaper=The Guardian|date=31 July 2012|accessdate=31 July 2012|quote=Twenty years later, I was writing about arthritis and Maeve was an obvious contact.

Shortly before her death, Binchy told ''The Irish Times'': "I don't have any regrets about [[The Road Not Taken (poem)|any roads I didn't take]]. Everything went well, and I think that's been a help because I can look back, and I do get great pleasure out of looking back&amp;nbsp;...

Despite being an atheist, Binchy was given a traditional Requiem Mass which took place at the Church of the Assumption, in her hometown of Dalkey.

==Work==

===Journalism===
''The New York Times'' reports: Binchy's "writing career began by accident in the early 1960s, after she spent time on a kibbutz in Israel. Her father was so taken with her letters home that "he cut off the ‘Dear Daddy’ bits,” Ms. Binchy later recounted, and sent them to an Irish newspaper, which published them."&lt;ref name="Fox, Margalit"/&gt; Donal Lynch observed of her first paying journalism role: the ''Irish Independent'' "was impressed enough to commission her, paying her £16, which was then a week-and-a-half's salary for her."&lt;ref name="Lynch, Donal"/&gt;
 
In 1968, Binchy joined the staff at ''The Irish Times'', and worked there as a writer, columnist, the first Women's Page editor&lt;ref name="Lynch, Donal"/&gt; then the London editor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/northern-ireland/obituary-maeve-binchy-witty-observant-and-a-largerthanlife-16192449.html|accessdate=4 August 2012 |journal=Belfast Telegraph |title=Obituary: Maeve Binchy – witty, observant, and larger-than-life|date=2 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; later reporting for the paper from London before returning to Ireland.&lt;ref name="Fox, Margalit"/&gt;

Binchy's first published book is a compilation of her newspaper articles titled ''My First Book''. Published in 1970, it is now out of print. As Binchy's bio posted at Read Ireland describes: "The Dublin section of the book contains insightful case histories that prefigure her novelist's interest in character. The rest of the book is mainly humorous, and particularly droll is her account of a skiing holiday, 'I Was a Winter Sport.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Read Ireland|title=Maeve Binchy|url=http://www.readireland.ie/aotm/Binchy.html|accessdate=4 August 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130217192356/http://www.readireland.ie/aotm/Binchy.html|archivedate=17 February 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Binchy, Maeve|publisher=Dublin: The Irish Times, Ltd.|isbn=9780950341835|title=My First Book|year=1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature===
In all, Binchy published 16 novels, four short-story collections, a play and a novella.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/popular-irish-author-maeve-binchy-dies-72-article-1.1125516?pgno=1|title=Popular Irish author Maeve Binchy dies at 72 |author=Associated Press |date=31 July 2012 |accessdate=18 October 2012 |publisher=[[New York Daily News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 17th novel, ''[[A Week in Winter]]'', was published posthumously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://books.usatoday.com/book/spend-a-comforting-'week-in-winter-with-maeve-binchy/r850376|title=Spend a comforting 'Week in Winter' with Maeve Binchy|first=Mary|last=Cadden|date=13 February 2013|accessdate=30 August 2015|work=[[USA Today]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her literary career began with two books of short stories: ''Central Line'' (1978) and ''Victoria Line'' (1980). She published her debut novel ''[[Light a Penny Candle]]'' in 1982. In 1983, it sold for the largest sum ever paid for a first novel: £52,000. The timing was fortuitous, as Binchy and her husband were two months behind with the mortgage at the time.&lt;ref name="Books Obituaries: Maeve Binchy"&gt;{{cite news|journal=The Telegraph|title=Books Obituaries: Maeve Binchy|accessdate=4 August 2012|date=31 July 2012|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/books-obituaries/9440604/Maeve-Binchy.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the prolific Binchy – who joked that she could write as fast as she could talk – ultimately became one of Ireland's richest women.&lt;ref name="Books Obituaries: Maeve Binchy"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |journal=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=4 August 2012|title=Maeve Binchy dies; author of popular Irish literature was 72 (Maeve Binchy, a former teacher and journalist, didn't publish her first novel until the year she turned 42.

Most of Binchy's stories are set in Ireland, dealing with the tensions between urban and rural life, the contrasts between England and Ireland, and the dramatic changes in Ireland between World War II and the present day. Her books have been translated into 37 languages.&lt;ref name=bbc_death&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-19057922|title=Author Maeve Binchy dies aged 72|work=[[BBC News]]|date=31 July 2012|accessdate=31 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While some of Binchy's novels are complete stories (''[[Circle of Friends (novel)|Circle of Friends]]'', ''Light a Penny Candle''), many others revolve around a cast of interrelated characters (''[[The Copper Beech]]'', ''[[Silver Wedding (novel)|Silver Wedding]]'', ''[[The Lilac Bus]]'', ''[[Evening Class (novel)|Evening Class]]'', and ''[[Heart and Soul (Binchy novel)|Heart and Soul]]'').  Her later novels, ''[[Evening Class (novel)|Evening Class]]'', ''[[Scarlet Feather]]'', ''[[Quentins]]'', and ''[[Tara Road]]'', feature a cast of recurring characters.

Binchy announced in 2000 that she would not tour any more of her novels, but would instead be devoting her time to other activities and to her husband, Gordon Snell. Five further novels were published before her death: ''[[Quentins]]'' (2002), ''[[Nights of Rain and Stars]]'' (2004), ''[[Whitethorn Woods]]'' (2006), ''[[Heart and Soul (Binchy novel)|Heart and Soul]]'' (2008), and ''[[Minding Frankie]]'' (2010).&lt;ref name="official" /&gt; Her final novel, ''[[A Week in Winter]]'', was published posthumously in 2012.&lt;ref name="Fox, Margalit"/&gt;&lt;ref name=LAT&gt;{{cite news|journal=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=4 August 2012|title=Maeve Binchy dies; author of popular Irish literature was 72|date=1 August 2012|author=Times staff and wire reports|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/aug/01/local/la-me-maeve-binchy-20120801}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 a collection of 36 unpublished short stories that she had written over a period of decades was published under the title ''Chestnut Street''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/2014/04/26/302901315/for-binchy-fans-one-last-trip-down-chestnut-street|title=For Binchy Fans, One Last Trip Down 'Chestnut Street'|first=Bobbi|last=Dumas|date=April 26, 2014|accessdate=September 1, 2014|work=[[National Public Radio]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/maeve-binchy-chestnut-street-paved-with-gems-1.1771079|title=Maeve Binchy: Chestnut Street paved with gems|first=Anna|last=Carey|date=April 29, 2014|accessdate=September 1, 2014|work=The Irish Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maeve Binchy has the ability to allow readers to picture the world in which she creates, her ability to do this is the reason why she is one of the top five Irish writers.  She also is one of very few authors who portray the Catholic church in a positive light.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kenny|first=Mary|year=2004|title=Irish catholic values in the work of Maeve Binchy|jstor=30095714|journal=An Irish quarterly review|volume=93|pages=427–435}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ThomasSchweicker2.jpg|thumb|Self portrait by mouth and foot artist [[Thomas Schweicker]] (1540–1602)]]
'''Mouth and foot painting''' is a technique to create [[drawing]]s, [[painting]]s and other works of art by maneuvering brushes and other tools with the mouth or foot. The technique is mostly used by artists who through illness, accident or congenital disability have no use of their hands. The [[Association of Mouth and Foot Painting Artists of the World|Association of Mouth and Foot Painting Artists]] (AMFPA) is a worldwide organization representing these artists.&lt;ref name="vdmfkhist"&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=https://www.vdmfk.com/en/about.html|website=www.vdmfk.com|publisher=[[Association of Mouth and Foot Painting Artists of the World]]|accessdate=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The brushes and tools that are used are ordinary artist's implements, but they may be modified in length or width.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Artist Mouthpiece|url=https://www.arttreehouse.com/store/content/artist-mouthpiece|website=www.arttreehouse.com|publisher=The Art Treeshouse|accessdate=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clayton|first1=Jon|title=My Specialist Equipment|url=http://www.jkcmouthartist.com/?page_id=100|website=www.jkcmouthartist.com|publisher=Jon Clayton|accessdate=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mirror"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Dominic|title=Paralysed artist paints amazing portrait of Thierry Henry's legendary goal celebration using only his mouth|date=25 July 2015|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/paralysed-artist-paints-amazing-portrait-6135328|website=www.mirror.co.uk|publisher=[[Daily Mirror]]|accessdate=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mouth painters hold the brush in their mouth or between their teeth and maneuver it with their tongue and cheek muscles.&lt;ref name="sun"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Battle|first1=Bella|title=Incredible paintings are a work of mouth art|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/4103893/Mouth-artist-Steve-Chambers-50-paints-with-the-brush-between-his-lips.html|website=www.thesun.co.uk|publisher=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]|date=2 February 2012|accessdate=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper or [[canvas]] is usually mounted vertically on an [[easel]].

[[File:Loza nemanjica.jpg|thumb|Nemanjić family tree from [[Visoki Dečani]] (ca. 1350).]]
The '''[[Nemanjić dynasty]]''' is depicted in a family tree [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]] in several specimen of [[Byzantine art]] [[fresco]]es in medieval [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbian Orthodox]] monasteries. The scheme is known as the '''Nemanjić family tree''' (''loza Nemanjića'').{{sfn|Vizantološki institut|2007|p=311}} Examples include those of [[Gračanica monastery|Gračanica]] (1321), [[Patriarchal Monastery of Peć|Peć]] (ca. 1335), [[Visoki Dečani]] (ca. 1350), and [[Matejče Monastery|Matejić]] (ca. 1360).{{sfn|Đurić|1978}}

The Nemanjić family tree is also preserved from engravings, such as those of Studenica (1733), and [[Hristofor Žefarović]] (1741).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.srpsko-nasledje.rs/sr-l/1998/05/article-10.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Old King's Head Hotel''' is a hotel and [[public house]] at 48–50 Lower Bridge Street, on the corner of Castle Street, [[Chester]], [[Cheshire]], England.  It is recorded in the [[National Heritage List for England]] as a designated Grade&amp;nbsp;II* [[Listed building#England and Wales|listed building]].&lt;ref name=nhl&gt;{{NHLE |num= 1376307|desc= The Old Kings Head Hotel, Chester|accessdate= 30 October 2011|mode=cs2|ps=none}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The building was constructed in about 1208.&lt;ref name=nhl/&gt;  It was the town house for Peter the Clerk, the administrator of [[Chester Castle]].&lt;ref name=lang&gt;{{Citation |editor1-last= Langtree|editor1-first= Stephen|editor2-last= Comyns|editor2-first= Alan| year = 2001| title = 2000 Years of Building: Chester's Architectural Legacy| publication-place = Chester| place = | publisher = Chester Civic Trust| pages = | page = 63| format = | id = | isbn = 0-9540152-0-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It initially contained a section of the [[Chester Rows]], but these were enclosed during the alterations made between the 15th and early 17th&amp;nbsp;centuries.  The latest of these alterations were made for [[Randle Holme#Randle Holme I (1570/71–1655)|Randle Holme&amp;nbsp;I]].&lt;ref name=nhl/&gt;  The building was restored in 1935,&lt;ref name=nhl/&gt; and again during the 1960s.&lt;ref name=lang/&gt;

==Architecture==

It is basically a [[timber framing|timber-framed]] building, part of which has been refaced with yellow [[sandstone]], and with brick that has been painted or [[Cement render|rendered]]. The roofs are [[slate]]d.   The building is in three storeys, of which the upper storey facing Lower Bridge Street is [[jettying|jettied]].  Both faces have three [[bay (architecture)|bays]].

'''Parkett''' is an international magazine specializing in art. The magazine will cease publication in Summer 2017 with its 100th issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Brian Boucher|title=Parkett Ceases Print Magazine After 33 Years|url=https://news.artnet.com/art-world/parkett-ceases-print-magazine-33-years-870326|accessdate=3 April 2017|work=Artnet|date=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication==
Published three times per year in English and German by its publishing house in Zurich, Switzerland, with an additional editorial office in New York, Parkett has a circulation of 12,000 and is read by some 30,000 readers in 40 countries, one third of them in North America.&lt;ref name="parkettart.com"&gt;[http://www.parkettart.com/set_aboutus.htm About us] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091118034107/http://www.parkettart.com/set_aboutus.htm |date=2009-11-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Founded in the early 1980s with the idea of fostering an open dialogue between the artistic communities of Europe and America, ''Parkett'' is based in Zurich, with an office also in New York.  The magazine's goal has been to actively and directly collaborate with important international artists whose oeuvre is explored in several essays by leading writers and critics in both German and English. Each artist featured also creates a special signed and numbered work exclusive to Parkett. By 2010, ''Parkett'' had published more than 80 volumes with some 180 monographs and over 1500 in-depth texts making it one of the most comprehensive libraries on contemporary art worldwide. Critics, curators, art historians, and other commentators join in the conversation contained within its pages. Many write on the collaborating artists; some write opinions under a variety of topic headings that recur issue to issue; others write on additional artists and ideas. The result is more of a curated event-between-covers than a typical art magazine with reviews and news items.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2001/parkett/|title=Interactives - Exhibitions - 2001 - Collaborations with Parkett|work=MoMA|accessdate=20 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To celebrate the fortieth issue of ''Parkett'', in June 1994 the editors presented a special thematic issue asking what beauty will look like after it reemerges from Postmodernism? And how, when contemporary life demands so many different things from contemporary art, do we strike a balance between history and presence, politics and humor? Taking the children's game of Snakes and Ladders as a guiding metaphor, the gala issue offers six mini-collaborations: Holland Cotter on [[Francesco Clemente]]; [[Boris Groys]] on [[Peter Fischli and David Weiss]]; David Rimanelli and Max Weechsler on [[Gunther Förg]]; [[Gordon Burn]] on [[Damien Hirst]]; Joan Simon on [[Jenny Holzer]]; and [[Gilbert Lascault]] on [[Rebecca Horn]]. Also in this issue, [[Dave Hickey]] wrote on magic, [[Vik Muniz]] on apparitions, Jeff Perrone on boards and borders, and [[G. Roger Denson]] on nomadic critical theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artbook.com/3907509900.html|title=Parkett No. 40/41 Snakes &amp; Ladders|work=Artbook|accessdate=20 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, on the occasion of ''Parkett'''s retrospective, the Museum of Modern Art in New York staged the exhibition, "Parkett - 20 Years of Artists' Collaborations", replete with a catalog raisonné of all artists' editions.  A book from the Kunsthaus Zurich exhibition in 2004 features unpublished artists sketches, documents, interviews, photographs and statements on the history and the making of Parkett since 1984. Exhibitions of Parkett's artists' editions have also been held in Cologne (Ludwig Museum), Frankfurt (Portikus), Copenhagen (Louisiana Museum), Tokyo (Hillside Forum), Geneva (Centre d'Art Contemporain), London (Whitechapel Art Gallery), and Zurich (Kunsthaus).&lt;ref name="parkettart.com"/&gt;

'''Protest art''' is a broad term that refers to creative works that concern or are produced by [[activists]] and [[social movements]].  There are also contemporary and historical works and currents of thought that can be characterized in this way.

Social movements produce such works as the signs, banners, posters, and other printed materials used to convey a particular cause or message.  Often, such art is used as part of demonstrations or acts of [[civil disobedience]].  These works tend to be ephemeral, characterized by their portability and disposability, and are frequently not authored or owned by any one person.  The various [[peace symbols]], and the [[raised fist]] are two examples that highlight the democratic ownership of these signs.

Protest art also includes (but is not limited to) performance, site-specific installations, graffiti and street art, and crosses the boundaries of art genres, media, and disciplines.
While some protest art is associated with trained and professional artists, an extensive knowledge of art is not required to take part in protest art.  Protest artists frequently bypass the art-world institutions and commercial gallery system in an attempt to reach a wider audience.  Furthermore, protest art is not limited to one region or country, but is rather a method that is used around the world. 

There are many politically charged pieces of [[fine art]] — such as [[Picasso]]'s ''[[Guernica (Picasso)|Guernica]]'', some of [[Norman Carlberg]]'s [[Vietnam war]]-era work, or [[Susan Crile]]'s images of torture at [[Abu Ghraib]].

==History==
It is difficult to establish a history for protest art because many variations of it can be found throughout history. While many cases of protest art can be found during the early 1900s, like Picasso's Guernica in 1937, the last thirty years{{When|date=February 2011}} has experienced a large increase in the number of artists adopting protest art as a style to relay a message to the public.

[[Image:WarProtestSign.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A piece of protest art featuring a [[parody]] of the logo of the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]].]]
As awareness of social justices around the world became more common among the public, an increase in protest art can be seen. Some of the most critically effective artworks of the recent period{{When|date=February 2011}} were staged outside the gallery, away from the museum and in that sense, protest art has found a different relationship to the public.

==Activist art==
Activist art represents and includes aesthetic, sociopolitical, and technological developments that have attempted to challenge and complicate the traditional boundaries and hierarchies of culture as represented by those in power.  Like protest art, activist art practice emerged partly out of a call for art to be connected to a wider audience, and to open up spaces where the marginalized and disenfranchised can be seen and heard.

Activist art incorporates the use of public space to address socio-political issues and to encourage community and public participation as a means of bringing about social change.  It aims to affect social change by engaging in active processes of representation that work to foster participation in dialogue, raise consciousness, and empower individuals and communities.  The need to ensure the continued impact of a work by sustaining the public participation process it initiated is also a challenge for many activist artists.  It often requires the artist to establish relationships within the communities where projects take place.

If social movements are understood as “repeated public displays” of alternative political and cultural values,&lt;ref&gt;Reed, T.V., The art of protest : culture and activism from the civil rights movement to the streets of Seattle.  (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2005) xiv.&lt;/ref&gt; then activist art is significant in articulating such alternative views.  Activist art is also important to the dimension of culture and an understanding of its importance alongside political, economical, and social forces in movements and acts of social change.  One should be wary of conflating activist art with political art, as doing so obscures critical differences in methodology, strategy, and activist goals.

===Historical basis in art and politics===
Activist art cites its origins from a particular artistic and political climate.  In the art world, performance art of the late 1960s to the 70s worked to broaden aesthetic boundaries within [[visual arts]] and traditional [[theatre]], blurring the rigidly construed distinction between the two.  The transient, interdisciplinary, and hybrid nature of performance art allowed for audience engagement.  The openness and immediacy of the medium invited public participation, and the nature of the artistic medium was a hub for media attention.

Emerging forms of [[feminism]] and feminist art of the time was particularly influential to activist art.  The idea that “the personal is the political,” that is, the notion that personal revelation through art can be a political tool,&lt;ref&gt;Suzanne Lacy, ed.  Mapping the Terrain: New Genre Public Art.  (Seattle: Bay Press Inc., 1995) 27&lt;/ref&gt; guided much activist art in its study of the public dimensions to private experience.  The strategies deployed by feminist artists parallel those by artists working in activist art.  Such strategies often involved “collaboration, dialogue, a constant questioning of aesthetic and social assumptions, and a new respect for audience” and are used to articulate and negotiate issues of self-representation, empowerment, and community identity.

[[Conceptual Art]] sought to expand aesthetic boundaries in its critique of notions of the art object and the commodity system within which it is circulated as currency.  Conceptual artists experimented with unconventional materials and processes of art production.  Grounded by strategies rooted in the real world, projects in conceptual art demanded viewer participation and were exhibited outside of the traditional and exclusive space of the art gallery, thus making the work accessible to the public.  Similarly, collaborative methods of execution and expertise drawn from outside the art world are often employed in activist art so as to attain its goals for community and public participation.  Parallel to the emphasis on ideas that conceptual art endorsed, activist art is process-oriented, seeking to expose embedded power relationships through its process of creation.

In the political sphere, the militancy and identity politics of the period fostered the conditions out of which activist art arose.

===Strategy and practice===
In practice, activist art may often take the form of temporal interventions, such as performance, media events, exhibitions, and installations.  It is also common to employ mainstream media techniques (through the use of billboards, posters, advertising, newspaper inserts…etc.).  By making use of these commercial distributive channels of commerce, this technique is particularly effective in conveying messages that reveal and subvert its usual intentions.

The use public participation as a strategy of activating individuals and communities to become a “catalyst for change” is important to activist art.  In this context, participation becomes an act of self-expression or self-representation by the entire community.  Creative expression empowers individuals by creating a space in which their voices can be heard and in which they can engage in a dialogue with one another, and with the issues in which they have a personal stake.

The Artist and Homeless Collaborative is an example of a project that works with strategies of public participation as a means of individual and community empowerment.  It is an affiliation of artists, arts professionals and women, children and teenagers living in NYC shelters, the A &amp; HC believe that their work in a collaborative project of art-making offers the residents a “positive experience of self-motivation and helps them regain what the shelter system and circumstances of lives destroy: a sense of individual identity and confidence in human interaction.”&lt;ref&gt;Wolper,Andrea. ''Making Art, Reclaiming Live: The Artist and Homeless Collaborative''. (Seattle: Bay Press Inc., 1995) 252-253&lt;/ref&gt; The process of engaging the community in a dialogue with dominant and public discourses about the issue of homelessness is described in a statement by its founder, Hope Sandrow: “The relevancy of art to a community is exhibited in artworks where the homeless speak directly to the public and in discussion that consider the relationship art has to their lives.  The practice of creating art stimulates those living in shelters from a state of malaise to active participation in the artistic process”&lt;ref&gt;Wolper,Andrea. ''Making Art, Reclaiming Live: The Artist and Homeless Collaborative''. (Seattle: Bay Press Inc., 1995) 253&lt;/ref&gt;

The A &amp; HC came into being at a time when a critique of the makers, sellers, and consumers of art that addressed social concerns became increasingly pronounced.  Critics argued that the very works of art whose purpose was to provoke political, social and cultural conversation were confined within the exclusive and privileged space of galleries museums, and private collections.  By contrast, the A &amp; HC was an attempt to bridge the gap between art production and social action, thus allowing for  the work subjects that were previously excluded and silenced to be heard.

==Resistance art==
Resistance art is art used as a way of showing their opposition to powerholders.  This includes art that opposed such powers as the German Nazi party, as well as that opposed to [[apartheid in South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://library.thinkquest.org/18799/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311083452/http://library.thinkquest.org/18799/ |archivedate=2012-03-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Willie Bester]] is one of South Africa's most well known artists who originally began as a resistance artist.  Using materials assembled from garbage, Bester builds up surfaces into relief and then paints the surface with oil paint.  His works commented on important black South African figures and aspects important to his community.  South African resistance artists do not exclusively deal with race nor do they have to be from the townships.  Another artist, Jane Alexander, has dealt with the atrocities of apartheid from a white perspective.  Her resistance art deals with the unhealthy society that continues in post-apartheid South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Sue Williamson, Resistance Art in South Africa (1989)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collections==
The [[Center for the Study of Political Graphics]] archive currently contains more than 85,000 posters and has the largest collection of post-World War II social justice posters in the United States and the second largest in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Sheff, Harry. "The Center for the Study of Political Graphics". Utne Reader. Retrieved 4 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Many university libraries have extensive collections including the Joseph A. Labadie Collection at University of Michigan documents the history of social protest movements and marginalized political communities from the 19th century to the present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Joseph A.

== Background ==
The material for the ''Précis'' had been previously been part of a history that Voltaire spent twenty years working on and which included ''[[Essai sur les mœurs et l'esprit des nations]]'' (''Essay on the customs and spirit of the nations'') and ''[[The Age of Louis XIV]]''. The ''Precis'' was introduced in 1762 as an appendix within this larger work, but later published separately.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OXXlCgQR4V8C|title=The Age of Voltaire: The Story of Civilization|last=Durant|first=Will|last2=Durant|first2=Ariel|date=2011|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=9781451647662|page=800|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://voltairefoundation.wordpress.com/2015/05/11/battles-on-and-off-the-field/|title=Battles on and off the field|last=|date=2015-05-11|website=Voltaire Foundation|access-date=2016-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Content ==
Voltaire comments on the trial of [[Thomas Arthur, comte de Lally]]; a case he had been following closely. Lally had been a successful military officer, and personally known to Voltaire. When Lally was involved at a military defeat, relinquishing the Indian town of [[Pondicherry]] to the English, his fellow officers blamed him. On his return to France, Lally was imprisoned without charge, put on trial in which he was denied a lawyer, and finally executed.&lt;ref name="davidson"/&gt; In his account of the case, Voltaire wrote, "His character made him detested by all who had to do with him. But that is not a reason for cutting off a man's head. The briefs both for and against him, which I have read attentively, contain nothing but insults, and not the least proof."&lt;ref name="davidson"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davidson|first1=Ian|title=Voltaire in Exile|date=2004|publisher=Atlantic books|isbn=1843540878|pages=159–164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Precis'' also praises the courage of the Corsicans in defending against the French at the [[Battle of Ponte Novu]]. Voltaire writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The principal weapon of the Corsicans was their courage. This courage was so great that in one of these battles, near a river named Golo, they made a rampart of their dead in order to have the time to reload behind them before making a necessary retreat […] Bravery is found everywhere, but such actions aren’t seen except among free people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historytoday.com/sebastien-r-le-morillon/rethinking-napoleon%E2%80%99s-roots|title=Rethinking Napoleon’s Roots|last=Le Morillon|first=Sebastien R.|date=30 November 2015|website=History Today|publisher=|access-date=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Retting''' is a process employing the action of micro-organisms and moisture  on plants to dissolve or rot away much of the cellular tissues and [[pectin]]s surrounding [[Bast fibre|bast-fibre]] bundles, and so facilitating separation of the [[Fiber|fibre]] from the stem.&lt;ref name=EncycBrit&gt;retting. (2009). In Encyclopædia Britannica. Retrieved June 03, 2009, from Encyclopædia Britannica Online:http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/500159/retting&lt;/ref&gt; It is used in the production of fibre from plant materials such as [[flax]] and [[hemp]] stalks and [[coir]] from [[coconut]] husks.

==Water retting==
The most widely practised method of retting, water retting, is performed by submerging bundles of stalks in water. The water, penetrating to the central stalk portion, swells the inner cells, bursting the outermost layer, thus increasing absorption of both moisture and decay-producing bacteria. Retting time must be carefully judged; under-retting makes separation difficult, and over-retting weakens the fibre. In double retting, a gentle process producing excellent fibre, the stalks are removed from the water before retting is completed, dried for several months, then retted again.&lt;ref name=EncycBrit/&gt;

''Natural water retting'' employs stagnant or slow-moving waters, such as ponds, bogs, and slow streams and rivers. The stalk bundles are weighted down, usually with stones or wood, for about 8 to 14 days, depending upon water temperature and mineral content.&lt;ref name=EncycBrit/&gt;

''Tank retting'', by contrast, employs vats usually made of concrete, requires about four to six days, and is feasible in any season. In the first six to eight hours, called the leaching period, much of the dirt and colouring matter is removed by the water, which is usually changed to assure clean fibre. Waste retting water, which requires treatment to reduce harmful toxic elements before its release, is rich in plant minerals, such as nitrates, and can be used as liquid fertilizer.&lt;ref name=EncycBrit/&gt;

==Dew retting==
[[File:Flax field Fecamp 01.JPG|thumb|Dew retting of flax in France.]]
This is a common method in areas with limited water resources. It is most effective in climates with heavy night time dews and warm daytime temperatures. The harvested plant stalks are spread evenly in grassy fields, where the combined action of bacteria, sun, air, and dew produces fermentation, dissolving much of the stem material surrounding the fibre bundles. Within two to three weeks, depending upon climatic conditions, the fibre can be separated. Dew-retted fibre is generally darker in color and of poorer quality than water-retted fibre.&lt;ref name=EncycBrit/&gt;

== After retting ==

The retted stalks, called straw, are dried in open air or by mechanical means, and are frequently stored for a short period to allow "curing" to occur, facilitating fibre removal. Final separation of the fibre is accomplished by a breaking process in which the brittle woody portion of the straw is broken, either by hand or by passing through rollers, followed by the [[scutching]] operation, which removes the broken woody pieces (shives) by beating or scraping. Some machines combine breaking and scutching operations. Waste material from the first scutching, consisting of shives and short fibres, is usually treated a second time. The short fibre ([[tow]]) thus obtained is frequently used in paper manufacture, and the shives may serve as fuel to heat the retting water or may be made into wallboard.&lt;ref name=EncycBrit/&gt;

The '''Royal Danish Theatre''' ('''RDT''', [[Danish language|Danish]]: '''''{{lang|da|Det Kongelige Teater}}''''') is both the national Danish performing arts institution and a name used to refer to its old purpose-built venue from 1874 located on [[Kongens Nytorv]] in [[Copenhagen]]. The theatre was founded in 1748, first serving as the theatre of the king, and then as the theatre of the country. The theatre presents [[opera]], the [[Royal Danish Ballet]], [[European classical music|classical music]] concerts (by the [[Royal Danish Orchestra]], which dates back to 1448), and [[drama]] in several locations.

The Royal Danish Theatre organization is under the control of the [[Danish Ministry of Culture]], and its objectives are to ensure the staging of outstanding performances that do justice to the various stages which it controls.

'''Steven B. Smith''' (born 1946 in [[Wallace, Idaho]]), is an [[underground art]]ist and [[poet]] from [[Cleveland, Ohio]]. He published ''[[ArtCrimes]]'', a zine influenced by the [[beat poetry|beats]].&lt;ref name="Utter" /&gt; Smith's art and poetry uses cultural themes as found objects with a [[Dadaism|Dadaist]] influence.&lt;ref name="Norman"&gt;Norman, Sally. [http://agentofchaos.com/review1984_d.html "Spiritual Fulfillment,"] ''Dialogue Magazine'' (Sept., 1984).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Litt"&gt;Litt, Steven. [http://agentofchaos.com/review1992.html "Aggressive Nastiness Jabs At Viewer,"] ''The Plain Dealer'' (May 27, 1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

His life is pockmarked with colorful episodes such as stealing cars when he was thirteen, getting kicked out of the [[U.S. Naval Academy]], armed robbery, and prison.&lt;ref name="Sparks" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tranberg" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Utter2"&gt;Utter, Douglas Max. [http://agentofchaos.com/prisonbreak.html "Over the Wall: The Restless Steven B. Smith Is Moving On,"] ''Cleveland Free Times'' (Mar. 15, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==

Smith was born in Wallace, Idaho, to Pappy Smith and Florence E. "Mother Dwarf" Smith. He was raised in Paradise Prairie, twenty miles outside of [[Spokane, Washington]]. He stole thirteen cars when he was thirteen.&lt;ref name="Sparks" /&gt;

In 1968 Smith was one of thirteen [[Midshipmen|middies]] ousted by the Naval Academy for smoking [[Marijuana|pot]].&lt;ref name="Barnes"&gt;Barnes, Bart. [http://agentofchaos.com/review1968.html "13 Middies Ousted In Marijuana Case,"] ''The Washington Post'' (Feb. 21, 1968).&lt;/ref&gt; He haggled a deal with the government upon discharge; they agreed to pay for his education.&lt;ref name="Sparks" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tranberg" /&gt; He went on to receive a bachelor's degree in English and philosophy with a 3.8 GPA from [[Loyola College in Maryland]].&lt;ref name="Cullinan"&gt;Cullinan, Helen. [http://agentofchaos.com/review1993.html "Angry Young Artist Has Mellowed With Age,"] ''The Plain Dealer'' (Sept. 30, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith married into an East Coast [[Nobility|blue-blood]] family in 1969.&lt;ref name="Sparks" /&gt; In 1970, he was arrested for armed robbery. [http://agentofchaos.com/prisonbreak.html] Smith lived in Baltimore and other cities before coming to Cleveland in 1977&lt;ref name="Cullinan" /&gt; in pursuit of another man's wife.&lt;ref name="Sparks" /&gt; She then divorced her husband and decided to marry someone other than Smith.&lt;ref&gt;Putre, Laura. [http://agentofchaos.com/review1996.html "Blurb,"] ''The Scene'' (Apr. 26, 1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art==

Smith's [[Assemblage art|art assemblages]] started when one day, instead of painting a key on a canvas, he picked it up and pasted it onto the canvas.&lt;ref&gt;Heaton, Michael. [http://agentofchaos.com/heaton_030418.html "Nothing can save your life like a really good art attack,"] ''The Plain Dealer'' (Apr. 18, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith's art uses iconic baubles with the effect of cheapening and attacking cultural themes.&lt;ref name="Norman" /&gt; The work has been characterized as "difficult and uncompromising,"&lt;ref name="Sparks2"&gt;Sparks, Amy Bracken. [http://agentofchaos.com/review1988.html "A Place to Call Home,"] ''Cleveland Edition'' (Sept. 8, 1988).&lt;/ref&gt; and "repellent and grotesque," with roots from the [[dadaist]] collages of [[Kurt Schwitters|Schwitters]] and [[Rauschenberg]].&lt;ref name="Litt" /&gt;

Materials used include rusted wire, shattered glass, obscene imagery, dead mice, the artificial leg of a dead drug dealer and sometimes other people's art.&lt;ref name="Norman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sparks" /&gt; His work is washed in blue "corrosion," a mix of [[Liquitex|matte medium]], copper powder, and salt.&lt;ref&gt;Green, Frank. [http://agentofchaos.com/review1994.html "Alchemy In Reverse,"] ''The Cleveland Free Times'' (Apr. 20, 1994).&lt;/ref&gt; Another reviewer says Smith's use of oxidized copper makes his works appear to be fetched from the bottom of the sea.&lt;ref name="Utter2" /&gt;

Smith uses cultural themes as found objects.&lt;ref name="Norman" /&gt; "I deal in symbolic juxtapositions of the odd and unwanted," Smith says. "My materials consist of cultural castoffs, sociological implications and the refuse known as suburban thought. My goals are simple; erase your labels; learn to look about ... Learn to see dead frog and rust and thus re-see yourself."&lt;ref name="Cullinan" /&gt; He says, "My art is a collaboration with the pieces."&lt;ref name="Sparks" /&gt;

After the death of his brother Cat (Vincent Smith), Smith started exhibiting his brother's remains at his shows, leaving some of the ashes behind after each exhibit.&lt;ref name="Bly" /&gt;

==Notoriety==

Smith first gained notoriety with a piece — ''American Ego'' — in the People's Art Show at CSU. His piece was a four-by-three grid of [[Instant film|Polaroid]] snapshots, nude photos of himself in compromising positions with the American flag.&lt;ref&gt;Neff, James. [http://agentofchaos.com/review1984.html "Must Be Profound,"] ''The Plain Dealer'' (Dec. 3, 1984)&lt;/ref&gt; This piece won the "most outrageous" award at the show.&lt;ref name="Cullinan" /&gt;

Next, three pieces of his art were censored from a show at [[Tri-C]] West. Smith agreed to the removal as long as a "censored" notice was put on the wall in place of the missing art. The opening night poetry reading was reassigned to a remote conference room. During the reading Smith discovered that Tri-C neglected to post the notes. He wrote "CENSORED" on the wall with a ball point pen. Poet [[Daniel Thompson (poet)|Daniel Thompson]] decided to read in the original gallery, and mouthed the words to his poem silently as a Tri-C co-director sanded the words off the wall.&lt;ref&gt;Cullinan, Helen. [http://agentofchaos.com/review1986.html "Censorship Charges Mar Tri-C West Show"] ''Cleveland Plain Dealer'' (May 1, 1986).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==

Smith worked longest as a computer programmer, which helped support ''[[ArtCrimes]]'' and his art. He frequently contracted with [[BP]]. Previous occupations include sailor, milk man, life insurance salesman, avant garde theater manager, newspaper film and music critic, woman's shoe salesmen, prison cook, carnival laborer, and church janitor. He's also worked at [[Bethlehem Steel]].&lt;ref name="Sparks" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tranberg" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cullinan" /&gt;

Smith's "resume" was published in an article from 2000:

==Cleveland Warehouse District==

Smith and his friend and frequent collaborator S. Judson Wilcox were two early "urban pioneers": artists who settled the [[The Warehouse District|Warehouse District]] in Cleveland in 1981.&lt;ref name="Morton"&gt;Morton, Elizabeth. [http://agentofchaos.com/review1987_b.html "Art Behind Bars,"] ''Dialogue Magazine'' (July 1987).&lt;/ref&gt; Artists, musicians and renegades moved there to revel in Cleveland's industrial beauty.&lt;ref name="Sparks" /&gt; The warehouse district was a haven.&lt;ref name="Cullinan" /&gt;

Smith and Wilcox had an "Art Behind Bars" installation in the district with mannequins, Mickey Mouse, and neon tube calliope.&lt;ref name="Morton" /&gt;

Smith's brother "Cat" moved into the warehouse with him.&lt;ref name="Litt" /&gt; Cat Smith's collages were dead ringers for Schwitters'.&lt;ref name="Sparks" /&gt;

Smith and Cat's spot in the warehouse became a gathering spot for other artists in the building, and scene, including S. Judson Wilcox, Melissa Jay Craig (AKA "Field Marshal May Midwest"), Jeff Chiplis, Laszlo Gyorki, Ken Nevadomi, Randy Rigutto, Jay Clements, and Beth Wolfe.&lt;ref name="Sparks" /&gt; Guests were offered keepsakes of miniature toy soldiers, babies in plastic bubbles, or poetry.&lt;ref&gt;Sparks, Amy Bracken.  [http://agentofchaos.com/review1998.html "Howling at the Edge of a Renaissance: SPACES and Alternative Art in Cleveland, 1978-1998,"] Performance Art Festival catalogue (Sept. 1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

SPACES Gallery was located on the first floor, making the warehouse the [[de facto]] epicenter of creative activity.&lt;ref name="Sparks" /&gt;

Cat was a troubled man who eventually committed suicide.&lt;ref name="Litt" /&gt; After he died, Smith heard a beeping in his studio. He couldn't figure out where the beeping came from, and thought it was the soul of his dead brother. He then found a worn-out smoke detector at the bottom of a huge pile in his studio.&lt;ref name="Sparks" /&gt;

In another installation with Wilcox, Smith used a bag of his dead brother's ashes. He claimed to have a pact with Cat. The first to die would be included in an exhibition of the other's work.&lt;ref&gt;Cullinan, Helen. [http://agentofchaos.com/review1988_a.html "Ashes to Ashes, Poet to Artist,"] ''The Cleveland Plain Dealer''
(July 1988).&lt;/ref&gt; In one of the exhibitions at SPACES gallery, Smith put Cat's ashes on a pedestal. The bag was punctured by a friend and ashes spilled onto the pedestal and the floor.&lt;ref name="Sparks" /&gt;

==''ArtCrimes''==
{{main|ArtCrimes}}
Before making visual art, Smith crafted unique journals into which he'd juxtapose images and poetry and journal entries.&lt;ref name="Sparks"&gt;Sparks, Amy Bracken. [http://agentofchaos.com/surreal_thing.html "Surreal Thing: Eccentric Artist and Collector Steve Smith Bares All,"] ''Free Times'' (Mar. 15-21, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt; Smith wrote clever, punning poetry and read it all over town. (His poetry is described as "a stream-of-consciousness assault on reason and order" and "a cross between Dada and [[Jack Kerouac]].")&lt;ref name="Tranberg" /&gt; Smith used his art and poetry to make political statements, and he also participated in a couple legendary "regional art terrorist" raids in the [[Flats District (Cleveland)|Flats]].&lt;ref name="Sparks"/&gt;

Starting in 1986, Smith published the Cleveland [[Underground art|cult underground publication]] ''[[ArtCrimes]]'', a zine full of images and poems which also shared his disrespect for authority. ''ArtCrimes'' took on the spirit of Smith's journals, like a sketchbook that's been passed around to dozens of different artists.&lt;ref name="Tranberg"&gt;Tranberg, Dan. [http://agentofchaos.com/plaindealer_acarticle_0802.html "Art Matters: Underground publication carries on as a quiet force,"] ''The Plain Dealer'' (August 2, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bly"&gt;Bly, Lyz. [http://agentofchaos.com/dwarf/review050511.html "Capturing the Smiths: Mother Dwarf's collages evoke an often painful family history,"] ''Cleveland Free Times'' (May 11, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; The zine was influenced by the [[beat (music)|beats]],&lt;ref name="Utter"&gt;Utter, Douglas Max.

Smith's Farewell ''ArtCrimes'' Is His Best Ever,"] ''Cleveland Free Times'' (August 9, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; and was consistent with the style of publications from the days of [[Kerouac]], [[Gregory Corso|Corso]], and [[Allen Ginsberg|Ginsberg]].

Contributors included everyone from [[Charles Bukowski|Bukowski]] and [[Jack Micheline|Micheline]] to people's pets. Ohio poets and artists included the likes of [[Daniel Thompson (poet)|Daniel Thompson]], Maj Ragain, Amy Bracken Sparks, Ben Gulyas, Chris Franke, [[Harvey Pekar]], [[Gary Dumm]], [[Masumi Hayashi (photographer)|Masumi Hayashi]] and Ken Nevadomi.&lt;ref name="Budimir"&gt;Budimir, Milenko. [http://agentofchaos.com/budimir_0606.html "Crimes-free Cleveland:  The city’s agent of chaos takes on a new mission,"] ''Northern Ohio Live'' (June 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; One reviewer postulated that ''ArtCrimes'' was the most significant publication of the Cleveland underground art scene in recent history.&lt;ref name="Utter" /&gt;

==Tremont==

The affordability of Cleveland neighborhoods periodically caused mass migrations of artists. In the 1980s, Smith was one of the urban pioneers to move into the Warehouse District.&lt;ref name="Morton" /&gt; In '85, he was one of many artists who moved from the warehouses to [[Tremont, Cleveland|Tremont]], in the typical pattern where artists move into undesirable but inexpensive neighborhoods, fixing up old buildings in which to live and work.&lt;ref name="Sparks2" /&gt;

Shortly after Smith's move to Tremont, Cat committed suicide. Pappy Smith died shortly after, and Mother Dwarf (Florence E. Smith) left Las Vegas to come to live with Smith.&lt;ref name="Sparks" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bly" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sparks3"&gt;Sparks, Amy Bracken. [http://agentofchaos.com/review1993_b.html "A Most Common Name, A Most Unusual Family,"] ''The Cleveland Free Times'' (Aug. 11, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt; Mother Dwarf began her art career producing collages for ''[[ArtCrimes]]''.&lt;ref name="Bly" /&gt; Smith and his mother's life together became a mother-son artistic collaboration.&lt;ref name="Utter2" /&gt;

Smith nearly died in 1991 from alcohol, and has been sober since then.&lt;ref name="Sparks3" /&gt; One notable drunken episode was after an art auction. He'd bid loudly on every piece offered. He took a walk home with Mother Dwarf. He passed a fence of barking dogs, and started to howl "in communion." He leaned up over the dogs and they bit his scalp. The next day, Smith asked Mother Dwarf why he was covered in blood. "You mean..." she said, "You don't remember the dogs?"&lt;ref name="Sparks" /&gt;

==Recent==

In an interview in 2000, Smith claimed his voice was raspy "because I don't talk to anyone anymore." He'd become a recluse whose doormat said "Go Away."&lt;ref name="Sparks" /&gt; He said, "I had to learn silence. People only remember the old days when I shocked people with what I said or made or did. But there's a lot of beauty in the things I've done."&lt;ref name="Sparks" /&gt;

In 2005 Smith's life hit a series of highs and lows. His mother died, he fell in love, he retired, and then discovered he had throat cancer. He published the final issue of ''[[ArtCrimes]]'' in 2006.&lt;ref name="Tranberg2"&gt;Tranberg, Dan. [http://agentofchaos.com/tranberg060505.html "Art Matters With Dan Tranberg: Emigrating artist Steven Smith holds 'liquidation sale' exhibit,"] ''The Plain Dealer'' (May 5, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith is a [[documentarian]]. His journals are not the only documentation of his life. He continues with his 2500-page website agentofchaos.com.&lt;ref name="Utter2" /&gt;

Smith married poet Lady K in 2006. They began their relationship shortly after the death of Mother Dwarf in 2005.&lt;ref name="Utter2" /&gt; In 2006 Smith and his wife sold their home, gave away all of their possessions, and moved to Europe.&lt;ref name="Tranberg2" /&gt;

{{nihongo|'''The Association of Japanese Animation''' ('''AJA'''; |日本動画協会|Nippon Douga Kyoukai}} is an industry group consisting of 52 affiliate  animation production companies.

== AJA's Duties ==

AJA's scope of duties are to work on various issues concerning the Japanese animation industry, which most members are a part of.

Most of AJA's members are small to medium-sized companies, hence the need for AJA to unite together to overcome some of the bigger problems, such as infringement of intellectual properties, rampant piracy and illegal file sharing has risen following the introduction and widespread adoption of P2P networking software.

Besides the aforementioned, AJA also serves to resolve conflicts, and provide improvements of the general production environment, talents and oversea operations.

AJA also releases annual reports on the anime industry. According to the 2017 report, overseas markets expanded 1.5 times the previous year to a record high. In terms of contracts, China placed first while the United States dropped to 4th place&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://aja.gr.jp/english/japan-anime-data|title=Anime Industry Data  {{!}}  日本動画協会|work=The Association of Japanese Animations|access-date=2018-04-16|language=ja-JP}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Events ==

AJA also organises events to promote the work of their members to the major distributor of licenses of other regions, R1 (US), R3 (SEA), R2 (UK), R4 (Aus) and so on, in bid to promote Japanese animation to the world.

One of their events is the biggest [[anime]] (Japanese animation) related event in Japan, the [[Tokyo International Anime Fair]].

Since April 2014, the AJA took leadership of {{nihongo|'''''Young Animator Training Project'''''|若手アニメーター育成プロジェクト|Wakate Animētā Ikusei Purojekuto}} an annual project first launched in 2010 by the [[Japanese Animation Creators Association]] and funded by the Japanese government's [[Agency for Cultural Affairs]] in order to support training animators. The project features a series of animated shorts produced by various animation studios each year. It has since been renamed {{nihongo|'''Anime Mirai'''|アニメミライ}}.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2014/06/23-1/anime-mirai-accepting-proposals-through-june-27th&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The House of the Dead''''' ({{lang-ru|Записки из Мёртвого дома}}, ''Zapiski iz Myortvogo doma'') is a semi-autobiographical [[novel]] published in 1860–2&lt;ref&gt;The first part was published in 1860 and the second one in 1862. The novel's first complete appearance was in book form in 1862.&lt;/ref&gt; in the journal ''[[Vremya (magazine)|Vremya]]''&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Frank, Introduction to The House of the Dead and Poor Folk, Barnes and Noble, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; by Russian author [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]], which portrays the life of convicts in a [[Siberia]]n prison camp. The novel has also been published under the titles '''''Memoirs from the House of The Dead''''', '''''Notes from the Dead House''''' (or '''''Notes from a Dead House'''''), and '''''Notes from the House of the Dead'''''. The book is a loosely-knit collection of facts, events and [[philosophy|philosophical]] discussion organised by "theme" rather than as a continuous story. Dostoevsky himself spent four years in exile in such a camp following his conviction for involvement in the [[Petrashevsky Circle]]. This experience allowed him to describe with great authenticity the conditions of prison life and the characters of the convicts.

==Background==
After his [[mock execution]] on 22 December 1849, Dostoevsky's life was spared in exchange for four years of imprisonment in one of Siberia’s ''[[katorga]]'' labor camps. Though he often was met with hostility from the other prisoners due to his noble status of ''[[dvoryanin]]'', his views on life changed. After his time in the camps Dostoevsky returned to write ''The House of the Dead''. The novel incorporates several of the horrifying experiences he witnessed while in prison. He recalls the guards’ brutality and relish performing unspeakably cruel acts, the crimes that the convicted criminals committed, and the fact that blended amid these great brutes were good and decent individuals.&lt;ref&gt;"Fyodor Dostoevsky." ''Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online''. Encyclopædia Britannica, 2011. Web. 23 Oct.2011&lt;/ref&gt;
However, he is also astonished at the convicts’ abilities to commit murders without the slightest change in conscience. It was a stark contrast with his own heightened sensitivity. During this time in prison he began experiencing the epileptic seizures that would plague him for the rest of his life. ''House of the Dead'' led Dostoevsky to include the theme of murder in his later works, a theme not found in any of his works preceding ''House of the Dead''.&lt;ref&gt;Dostoyevsky, Fedor. ''Memoirs From the House of the Dead''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1956. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot summary==
The narrator, Aleksandr Petrovich Goryanchikov, has been sentenced to penalty deportation to Siberia and ten years of hard labour for murdering  his wife. Life in prison is particularly hard for Aleksandr Petrovich, since he is a "gentleman" and suffers the malice of the other prisoners, nearly all of whom belong to the peasantry. Gradually Goryanchikov overcomes his revulsion at his situation and his fellow convicts, undergoing a [[spiritual awakening|spiritual re-awakening]] that culminates with his release from the camp.  It is a work of great humanity; Dostoevsky portrays the inmates of the prison with sympathy for their plight, and also expresses admiration for their energy, ingenuity and talent. He concludes that the existence of the prison, with its absurd practices and savage corporal punishments is a tragic fact, both for the prisoners and for Russia.

==Characters==
Many of the characters in the novel were very similar to the real-life people that Dostoevsky met while in prison. While many of the characters do mirror real-life people, he has also made some of the characters appear more interesting than their real-life counterparts.

==Reception==
''The House of the Dead'' was Dostoevsky’s only work that [[Leo Tolstoy]] revered.&lt;ref name="Rayfield"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Rayfield |first1=Donald |title=The House of the Dead by Daniel Beer review – was Siberia hell on earth? |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/29/house-of-dead-siberian-exile-under-tsars-daniel-beer-review |accessdate=24 August 2018 |work=The Guardian |date=29 Sep 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations==
In 1927–1928, [[Leoš Janáček]] wrote an [[opera]]tic version of the novel, with the title ''[[From the House of the Dead]]''. It was his last opera.

Together the Miracle Project worked side by side with this group of individuals to put together a performance (comedy/music) to be performed in front of an audience on board Royal Caribbean's Freedom of the Seas.  Practices were held daily where the individuals learned songs, parts, created instruments, and interacted with one another to put together a performance of their lifetime!  With the help of some great staff and amazing individuals the show was a success!

'''''The Painted Veil''''' is a 2006 American [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] directed by [[John Curran (director)|John Curran]]. The screenplay by [[Ron Nyswaner]] is based on the 1925 [[The Painted Veil (novel)|novel of the same title]] by [[W. Somerset Maugham]]. [[Edward Norton]], [[Naomi Watts]], [[Toby Jones]], [[Anthony Wong Chau Sang]] and [[Liev Schreiber]] appear in the leading roles.

This is the third [[film adaptation]] of the Maugham book, following [[The Painted Veil (1934 film)|a 1934 film]] starring [[Greta Garbo]] and [[Herbert Marshall]] and a 1957 version called ''[[The Seventh Sin]]'' with [[Bill Travers]] and [[Eleanor Parker]].

==Plot==
On a brief trip back to [[London]], earnest, bookish [[Microbiology|bacteriologist]] Walter Fane ([[Edward Norton]]) is dazzled by Kitty Garstin ([[Naomi Watts]]), a vain London socialite. He proposes; she accepts ("only to get as far away from [her] mother as possible"), and the couple [[honeymoon]] in [[Venice]]. They travel on to Walter's medical post in [[Shanghai International Settlement|Shanghai]], where he is stationed in a government lab studying [[infectious diseases]]. They find themselves ill-suited, with Kitty much more interested in parties and the social life of the British [[expatriate]]s.

Kitty meets Charles Townsend ([[Liev Schreiber]]), a married British vice consul, and the two engage in a clandestine affair. When Walter discovers his wife's infidelity, he seeks to punish her by threatening to divorce her on the grounds of [[adultery]], if she doesn't accompany him to a small village in a remote area of [[Republic of China (1912-49)|China]]. He has volunteered to treat victims of an unchecked [[cholera]] [[epidemic]] sweeping through the area. Kitty begs to be allowed to divorce him quietly, but he refuses, stating "Why should I put myself through the smallest trouble for you?" She hopes Townsend will leave his wife Dorothy and marry her. When she proposes this possibility to Charles, he declines to accept, despite earlier claiming to love Kitty.

She is compelled to travel to the mountainous inland region with her husband. They embark upon an arduous, two-week-long overland journey, which would be considerably faster and much easier if they traveled by river, but Walter is determined to make Kitty as unhappy and uncomfortable as possible. Upon their arrival in Mei-tan-fu, she is distressed to discover they will be living in near-squalor, far removed from everyone except their cheerful neighbor Waddington, a British deputy commissioner living with Wan Xi (Lu Yan), a young Chinese woman, in relative opulence.

Walter and Kitty barely speak to each other and, except for a cook and a Chinese soldier assigned to guard her, she is alone for long hours. After visiting an orphanage run by a group of French nuns, Kitty volunteers her services, and she is assigned to work in the music room. She is surprised to learn from the Mother Superior that her husband loves children, especially babies. In this setting, she begins to see him in a new light as she learns what a selfless and caring person he can be. When he sees her with the children, he in turn realizes she is not the shallow, selfish person he thought her to be. As Walter's anger and Kitty's unhappiness subside, their marriage begins to blossom in the midst of the epidemic crisis. She soon learns she is pregnant, but is unsure who the father is. Walter – in love with Kitty again – assures her it doesn't matter.

The cholera epidemic takes many victims. As Walter and the locals are starting to get it under control, due to his importation of clean water through a system of aqueducts (as the local people did not understand water-borne infectious disease&lt;ref&gt;[[John Snow (physician)]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=August 2015}}) cholera-carrying refugees from elsewhere pour into the area, forcing Walter to set up a camp outside town. He contracts the disease and Kitty lovingly nurses him, but he dies, and she is devastated. Bereft and pregnant, she leaves China.

Five years later, Kitty appears well-dressed and happy in London shopping with her young son Walter. They meet Townsend by chance on the street, and he suggests that Kitty meet with him. Asking young Walter his age, he realizes from the reply that he might be the boy's father. Kitty rejects his overtures and walks away. When her son asks who Townsend is, she replies "No one important, darling".

==Production==

===Development===
Prior to 1999, producer Sara Colleton sought to develop a script for ''The Painted Veil''. The script was frequently redrafted, being written to be close to the source material, to take liberties with the source material, and to create a [[feminism|feminist]] version. Actor [[Edward Norton]] became involved with the project in 1999.&lt;ref name=encore&gt;{{cite news | author=Charles McGrath | url= | title=Another Encore for the Most Adaptable of Authors | publisher=The New York Times | date=2006-12-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Norton explained his attraction to the project, "It's very much a story about people getting beyond the worst in themselves and figuring out how to look at each other honestly, forgive each other for their failings and get to a better place... When I read it, I was very affected by it because in it I saw my own failings."&lt;ref name=passion&gt;{{cite news | author=Terry Armour | url= | title=Edward Norton concentrates his passion on performing | publisher=Chicago Tribune | date=2006-12-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The actor suggested casting [[Naomi Watts]] for the role of Kitty, which did not happen until Watts proved herself a bankable star with her performances in ''[[Mulholland Drive (film)|Mulholland Drive]]'' (2001) and ''[[21 Grams]]'' (2003).  When Watts joined the project, she recommended director [[John Curran (director)|John Curran]], with whom she had collaborated on the 2004 film ''[[We Don't Live Here Anymore]]''.  The director's expertise with ''We Don't Live Here Anymore'' convinced Watts and Norton that he would be capable of depicting the dysfunctional relationship in ''The Painted Veil''.&lt;ref name=encore/&gt;  The project began development at producers [[Bob Yari]] and [[Mark Gordon]]'s Stratus Film Company, but when Stratus executive Mark Gill left to start [[Warner Independent Pictures]], he brought the project with him.  Gill began production of the film in partnership with Yari. Gill was later fired before the film's completion by [[Warner Bros.]] production president Jeff Robinov, which later led to the film's [[#Marketing|marketing difficulties]].&lt;ref name=trying&gt;{{cite news | author=John Horn | url= | title=Trying to Get People to See 'Veil' | publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=2006-12-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yari and Warner Independent Pictures collaborated with a Chinese partner who was granted approval over the script and the finished film. The partnership permitted a budget of $19 million for ''The Painted Veil''. When the Chinese production company reviewed the film, it was unhappy with the depiction of the Chinese uprising and the cholera victims, requesting that the scenes be revised. Norton and Curran expressed concerns that their studio accepted the censorship too quickly, with the director threatening to remove his name from the film. Their pressure resulted in limiting cuts from the film to only 38 seconds' worth.&lt;ref name=trying/&gt;

===Writing===
Screenwriter [[Ron Nyswaner]] and Norton collaborated on the screenplay for the film.  The 1925 novel by author [[W. Somerset Maugham]] was considered one-dimensional, so Norton altered the story so the character Walter Fane had a more enhanced role.  The character was also rewritten to make his peace with his wife Kitty, leading to them falling in love with each other.  Norton explained, "I like to think that we didn't change the book so much as liberate it.  We just imagined it on a slightly bigger scale, and made external some of what is internal in the novel."  Norton described the novel as "almost unremittingly bleak" and believed that the author had thought that British colonials were unlikely to change.  The actor explained of the change to the story, "I went on the assumption that if you were willing to allow Walter and Kitty to grow... you had the potential for a love story that was both tragic and meaningful."&lt;ref name=encore/&gt;  Norton considered ''The Painted Veil'' to be in the spirit of films like ''[[Out of Africa (film)|Out of Africa]]'' (1985) and ''[[The English Patient (film)|The English Patient]]'' (1996), seeing it as "rooted in really looking at the way that men and women hurt each other".&lt;ref name=passion/&gt;

Director [[John Curran (director)|John Curran]] suggested setting the film during 1925, when the events of the [[Chinese nationalism|Chinese nationalist]] movement were taking place. Norton, who had studied Chinese history at [[Yale University]], agreed with the suggestion. To detail scenes from the time period, Curran, Norton, and Nyswaner relied on excerpts from historian [[Jonathan Spence]]'s 1969 book ''To Change China'', which covered the inept efforts of Western advisers during these years. Norton described the character Walter Fane served as "the proxy for the arrogance of Western rationalism", explaining about Fane's confusion at the lack of gratitude for his help, "Walter means well, but he's the folly of empire, and that adds a whole new dimension to what happens in the story. It's a metaphor for the way empires get crushed."&lt;ref name=encore/&gt;

===Filming===
Filming took place on location in [[Shanghai, China]]. The director did not want to build a set for the cholera-stricken village, instead seeking out an untouched parcel of land in China. He found Huang Yao Ancient Town (黄姚古镇 - huáng yáo gǔ zhèn) in [[Guangxi]] Zhuang Autonomous Region, which served as the location for the village. The director described the location, "Even the Chinese crew members were amazed at the place we found... It was like going back in time." According to Nyswaner, a large amount of time of the film production was spent negotiating with the Chinese government for the completion of the film, as there were disagreements over issues in the script.&lt;ref name=encore/&gt; Most of the film was shot in [[Guangxi]]. Director John Curran commented, "We wanted this movie to be distinctly Chinese. We didn’t want it to look like a film that you could shoot in [[Canada]] or [[Mexico]] or [[Italy]]." After a search of location in [[Hunan]] province, the scouts chose the location in Guangxi  for the film. Line producer Antonia Barnard states that initially the film, like the novel, was going to be set in Hong Kong; however, the crew realized Hong Kong of the time period would be difficult to replicate, thus the story was altered so it would take place in Shanghai; the crew shot "Shanghai for Shanghai in the period, and shot London scenes in Shanghai as well."

===Music===
The official soundtrack is composed by [[Alexandre Desplat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.soundtrackinfo.com/title/tracks.asp?paintedveil | title=The Painted Veil (2006) | publisher=[[the SoundtrackINFO Project]] | accessdate=2011-01-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marketing==
The film's post-production schedule was initially slated to conclude in late summer 2006, but did not finish until November.  According to Laura Kim, the marketing and publicity head of [[Warner Independent Pictures]], the delay slowed award and media recognition for the film. Other studios were duplicating DVDs of their films for awards organizations, so ''The Painted Veil'' was unable to get first priority in processing. When ''The Painted Veil'' experienced a limited release in the [[United States]] on December 20, 2006 in the cities of [[Los Angeles]] and [[New York City]], the meager marketing campaign for the film was criticized. The lack of attention caused half a dozen people associated with the film to complain about how [[Warner Independent Pictures]] was conducting the marketing campaign. Film critic [[Rex Reed]] of ''[[The New York Observer]]'' wrote, "Nobody can understand why Warner Independent Pictures is keeping this movie such a secret; it is filled with Oscar possibilities that should be shouted from the rooftops."&lt;ref name=trying/&gt;

The firing of Mark Gill, one of the initial producers of ''The Painted Veil'' who brought it to Warner Independent Pictures, was cited as a reason for the small scale of the film's marketing campaign. Director [[John Curran (director)|John Curran]] explained about the move to Warner Independent, "Any transition is not going to be ideal. When the guy who has gotten you on board is gone, you're kind of exposed." Others also criticized the studio for not providing a large enough marketing budget, pointing out that the previous year's ''[[Good Night, and Good Luck]]'' had a more successful campaign with television and newspaper ads. ''The Painted Veil'' was eventually able to expand to 23 more markets on December 29, 2006, with additional cities on January 5, 2007. Warner Independent also hosted 80 screenings of ''The Painted Veil'' in Los Angeles, New York, [[San Francisco]], and [[London]], as well as to various Hollywood guilds, to promote the film.&lt;ref name=trying/&gt;

==Release==

===Box office===
''The Painted Veil'' initially had a [[limited release]] in four theaters in the [[United States]] on December 20, 2006, grossing $51,086 over the opening weekend.  The film gradually expanded its showings in the United States and [[Canada]], peaking at 287 theaters on the weekend of January 26, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=weekend&amp;id=paintedveil.htm | title=The Painted Veil (2006) - Weekend Box Office Results | publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]] | accessdate=2007-12-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Painted Veil'' ultimately grossed $8,060,487 in the United States and Canada and $14,525,904 in other territories for a worldwide total of $22,586,391.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=paintedveil.htm | title=The Painted Veil (2006) | accessdate=2007-12-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical reception===
On the film review aggregate website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], ''The Painted Veil'' has received a 74% 'fresh' rating based on 143 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/painted_veil/ | title=The Painted Veil | publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | accessdate=2007-12-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the similar website [[Metacritic]], the film has received a metascore of 69 out of 100 based on 33 reviews, considered generally favorable reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/paintedveil | title=Painted Veil, The (2006): Reviews | publisher=[[Metacritic]] | accessdate=2007-12-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manohla Dargis of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said the story seems "so unlikely for modern adaptation, particularly when, as is the case here, it hasn’t been refitted with a contemporary hook or allegory for audiences who wouldn’t know Maugham from [[Edna Ferber]]. Instead, as nicely directed by John Curran and adapted to the screen by Ron Nyswaner, this version of the story lulls you by turning Maugham’s distaff [[bildungsroman]] into a fine romance. Even better, the new film gives us ample opportunity to spend time with Ms. Watts, whose remarkable talent helps keep movie faith and love alive, even in the tinniest, tiniest vehicles . . . An inveterate stealer and masticator of scenes, Mr. Norton is very fine here, especially early on, before his billing gets the better of the story and he begins riding around heroically on horseback . . . Whether through craft or constitution, [he] invests Walter with a petty cruelty that makes his character’s emotional thaw and Kitty’s predicament all the more poignant."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dargis |first=Manohla |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2006/12/20/movies/20veil.html |title='&amp;#39;New York Times'&amp;#39; review |publisher=Movies.nytimes.com |date=2006-12-20 |accessdate=2010-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carina Chocano of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' said the film "has all the elements in place to be a great epic, but it fails to connect, to paraphrase Maugham's contemporary [[E.M. Forster]], the prose with the passion. It's impeccable, but leaves you cold."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calendarlive.com/printedition/calendar/cl-et-painted20dec20,0,7424259.story |title='&amp;#39;Los Angeles Times'&amp;#39; review |publisher=Calendarlive.com |date=2006-12-20 |accessdate=2010-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Travers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' rated the film three out of four stars and commented, "If you're suspecting this third movie version of W. Somerset Maugham's 1925 novel may carry the infectious dullness of prestige filmmaking, rest easy . . . the film is a [[period piece]] propelled by emotions accessible to a modern audience . . . ''The Painted Veil'' has the power and intimacy of a timeless love story. By all means, let it sweep you away."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/the-painted-veil-20061212 |title='&amp;#39;Rolling Stone'&amp;#39; review |publisher=Rollingstone.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meghan Keane of the ''[[New York Sun]]'' said the film "may at times threaten to fall into an abyss of sentimentality, and it has moments that seem mere transitions to propel the plot, but it manages a charming historic portrait without insulting the audience's intelligence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nysun.com/arts/letting-love-blossom-in-the-face-of-disease/45494/ |title='&amp;#39;New York Sun'&amp;#39; review |publisher=Nysun.com |date=2006-12-20 |accessdate=2010-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Todd McCarthy of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' thought the story "feels remote and old-school despite a frankness the two previous film versions lacked." He added, "Present scripter Ron Nyswaner makes some solid fundamental decisions, beginning with the telescoping down to the barest minimum the London-set opening . . . All the same, the film is still dominated by the stuffy, repressed personality of Fane, whose emotional stonewalling of his wife produces a stifling of Kitty's naturally more vivacious, if common, personality. Despite the extremes of human experience on view, there is a certain blandness to them as they play out, a sensation matched by the eye-catching but picture-postcard-like presentation of the settings . . . Even the ultra-capable Norton and Watts aren't fully able to galvanize viewer interest in their narrowly self-absorbed characters."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mccarthy |first=Todd |url=http://www.variety.com/awardcentral_review/VE1117932311.html?nav=reviews07&amp;categoryid=2352&amp;cs=1&amp;p=0 |title='&amp;#39;Variety'&amp;#39; review |publisher=Variety.com |date=2006-12-14 |accessdate=2010-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and honors==
Composer [[Alexandre Desplat]] won the 2006 [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hfpa.org/browse/year/2006 | title=The 64th Annual Golden Globe Awards (2007) | publisher=[[Hollywood Foreign Press Association]] | accessdate=2007-12-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Desplat also won an award for Best Original Score from the [[Los Angeles Film Critics Association]] for both ''The Painted Veil'' and ''[[The Queen (2006 film)|The Queen]]'' (2006).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lafca.net/Home/News/2006_lafca_awards_winners.html | title=2006 LAFCA Awards | publisher=[[Los Angeles Film Critics Association]] | accessdate=2007-12-05 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071011132335/http://lafca.net/Home/News/2006_lafca_awards_winners.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ron Nyswaner]] won the [[National Board of Review Awards 2006|National Board of Review Award for Best Adapted Screenplay]] and was nominated for the [[Independent Spirit Award for Best Screenplay]] but lost to [[Jason Reitman]] for ''[[Thank You for Smoking (film)|Thank You for Smoking]]''.

[[Edward Norton]] was nominated for the [[Independent Spirit Award for Best Male Lead]] but lost to [[Ryan Gosling]] in ''[[Half Nelson (film)|Half Nelson]]''. The [[San Diego Film Critics Society]] honored him for his work in this and ''[[The Illusionist (2006 film)|The Illusionist]]'' and ''[[Down in the Valley (film)|Down in the Valley]]''.

The [[London Film Critics' Circle]] nominated Toby Jones Best British Supporting Actor of the Year.

'''This is the Public Domain''' is an [[art]] project designed to look at the difficulty in demarcating a piece of land as part of the international commons for [[perpetuity]] within the United States.&lt;ref name= "This is the Public Domain mute mag"&gt;[http://www.metamute.org/en/This-is-the-Public-Domain/ 'This is the Public Domain' ''Mute Magazine'' May 9, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cca.rca.ac.uk/publicsmog/documents/PressRelease_publicsmog.pdf Press release from the Royal College of Art]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
''This is the Public Domain'' was created by [[San Francisco]] based artist [[Amy Balkin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artsandecology.org.uk/magazine/artworks/project-1 "This is the Public Domain in Arts &amp; Ecology magazine]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, Balkin purchased {{convert|2.5|acre|m2}} of land in Tehachapi, California&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artofcommonspace.org/site/75/325.html Haring Woods Associates]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cca.edu/calendar/1163 California College of the Arts]&lt;/ref&gt; with the intention of giving them to a "global everyone." As a means of doing this, Balkin looked into a number of legal strategies within the constraints of [[property law|property]] and [[copyright law]].

==Legal Tactics==
Those working to create ''This is the [[Public Domain]]'' have attempted a number of legal strategies to achieve their goal.&lt;ref name= "This is the Public Domain"&gt;[http://thisisthepublicdomain.org This is the Public Domain website]&lt;/ref&gt; The first was attempting to [[copyright]] and then enter into the public domain the land within the project's boundaries as a [[conceptual art]]work. However, the artists involved learned that one can only give away the rights of works which can be reproduced. In order to deal with this limitation, a bench was created and the land was declared an extension of said bench.

The second was to enter the land into the public domain by putting the land into a [[land trust|trust]] and then distributing the [[license]] which allows people to occupy or modify the land. Included in the license is that the land must either be licensed for universal use or for no one's use. Redistribution of this license is allowed, but modification is not.

The final three strategies appear to be theoretical. One is the creation of a bearer corporation which controls the land. The upside to this from the artists' perspective is that the land would have strong legal protection, but they question whether [[corporation|corporate]] control is the proper way to achieve it. Another is creating a Limited Common Property Regime. This is seen as acceptable if one can include the entire world as members of the regime, but they have doubts about whether or not that would be possible. The final is creating a land trust. However, this would require [[private ownership]], and thus is likely to be rejected.

'''Valeria Miani''' (1563 – 1620) was a female playwright noted for her works Celina, a Tragedy, and Amorosa Speranza. Miani married Domenico Negri in 1593, with whom she had five children, Isabetta, Isabella, Lucretia, Guilio, and Anzolo.&lt;ref name="Celinda.3"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miani Negri|first1=Valeria|last2=Finucci|first2=Valeria|last3=Kisacky|first3=Julia|title=Celinda, A Tragedy|date=2010|publisher=Center for Reformation and Renaissance|location=Toronto, Ontario|isbn=978-0772720757|edition=1st|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miani is known for being the first woman to publish a tragedy prior to the 18th century.&lt;ref name="Celinda1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miani Negri|first1=Valeria|last2=Finucci|first2=Valeria|last3=Kisacky|first3=Julia|title=Celinda, A Tragedy|date=2010|publisher=Center for Reformation and Renaissance|location=Toronto, Ontario|isbn=978-0772720757|edition=1st|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, she was the third woman in Italy to write in the newly popular genre, the [[pastoral]]. Miani's works explored themes such as [[cross-dressing]], death and punishment, female virtue, and female resilience.&lt;ref name="Satyr6"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rees|first1=Katie|title=SATYR SCENES IN EARLY MODERN PADUA: VALERIA MIANI'S AMOROSA SPERANZA AND FRANCESCO CONTARINI'S FIDA NINFA.|journal=Italianist|date=2014|volume=34|issue=1|pages=23–53|doi=10.1179/0261434013Z.00000000062}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Miani was born in the year 1563, most likely in the northern Italian city of [[Padua]].&lt;ref name="Satyr6"/&gt;

===Family===
While it is unknown who Miani's mother was, Miani's father was Vidal Miani, a practicing Paduan lawyer. In addition to earning an income by practicing law, he also taught law, and rented rooms to students.&lt;ref name="Celinda2.4"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miani Negri|first1=Valeria|last2=Finucci|first2=Valeria|last3=Kisacky|first3=Julia|title=Celinda, A Tragedy|date=2010|publisher=Center for Reformation and Renaissance|location=Toronto, Ontario|isbn=978-0772720757|edition=1st|pages=9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is written record of Miani having two siblings, a brother who was a priest and  a sister named Cornelia. Miani most likely had more siblings, as there would have been another son who would be the heir in the family. It would have been unlikely in this time period for a family to have their only son enter into the clergy, and have no son to continue the family line.&lt;ref name="Celinda2.4"/&gt;

===Education===
[[File:Leggi de gli Academici Ricovrati.jpg|thumb|The image used in the Ricovrati's emblem.]]
There is no written record of where Miani attended school. However, many young girls in this century were educated in convents, so it is possible that Miani was educated in a convent as well.&lt;ref name="Satyr6"/&gt; Miani did however, have contact with the Ricovrati of Padua, a society made up of intellectuals, and both foreign and domestic professors.&lt;ref name="Academy"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Academy – Historical Facts|url=http://www.accademiagalileiana.it/The-Academy-historical-Facts.html?lang=en|website=www.accademiagalileiana.it|publisher=Accademia Galileiana di Scienze Lettere ed Arti in Padova|accessdate=1 May 2016|language=en|date=1 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=May 2016}} This academy was founded in 1599, and was the first academy to be established in Padua. Among its 25 founders was [[Galileo Galilei]], famed Italian astronomer and philosopher. Decades after Valeria Miani had contact with the Ricovrati, the academy became known for its wide acceptance of women into its membership.&lt;ref name="Muse2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cox|first1=Virginia|title=The prodigious muse : women's writing in counter-reformation Italy|date=2011|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore|isbn=978-1-4214-0032-7|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not known however, if the Ricovrati allowed women to become members in Miani's time, and if so, whether or not Miani was a member.

==Marriage and family==

Miani got married on September 22, 1593, at the age of 30. Her husband was Domenico Negri, a man whose occupation is unknown.&lt;ref name="Satyr6"/&gt; The formal ceremony was at the [[Church of the Eremitani]], while the marriage contract was signed in the groom's home city of [[Venice]].{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} Compared to other women of a similar background in Italy during this time period, this was considered late in a woman's life to get married.&lt;ref name="Celinda2.4"/&gt; While this may have been late for a typical woman of Miani's background, it was not for women of Miani's occupation. Other female writers during this century were married late in their life as well. Venetian writer and poet [[Moderata Fonte]] married at the age of 27, while Venetian author and women's rights activist [[Lucrezia Marinella]] married at the age of 35.&lt;ref name="Celinda2.4"/&gt; Negri's death occurred sometime between the years 1612 and 1614. Following the time of his death, Miani no longer published anything else, seemingly ending her writing career.

Miani and her husband are known to have five children.&lt;ref name="Celinda.3"/&gt; Their three daughters were Lucretia, Isabella, and Isabetta, and their two sons were Guilio ad Anzolo.

==Death==
Very little is known regarding the death of Valeria Miani. While it is known that she died in the year 1620, a specific date is not given.&lt;ref name="Celinda4"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miani Negri|first1=Valeria|last2=Finucci|first2=Valeria|last3=Kisacky|first3=Julia|title=Celinda, A Tragedy|date=2010|publisher=Center for Reformation and Renaissance|location=Toronto, Ontario|isbn=978-0772720757|edition=1st|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The place of her death is not known either, though it is likely that she passed somewhere in her home country of Italy.

==Works==

===Amorosa Speranza===

[[File:AmorosaSperanza.jpg|thumb|The cover of Valeria Miani Negri's Amorosa Speranza]]
Miani's first [[pastoral]] drama, Amorosa Speranza was published in 1604.&lt;ref name="Amorosa"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miani Negri|first1=Valeria|title=Amorosa speranza fauola pastorale della molto mag|date=1604|publisher=Francesco Bolzetta|location=Venetia}}&lt;/ref&gt; It took Miani six years to have her play published, having submitted it to her publisher in 1598. Her publisher and editor Francesco Bolzetta had the play in his possession for years before he decided to put it into print.&lt;ref name="Celinda3"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miani Negri|first1=Valeria|last2=Finucci|first2=Valeria|last3=Kisacky|first3=Julia|title=Celinda, A Tragedy|date=2010|publisher=Center for Reformation and Renaissance|location=Toronto, Ontario|isbn=978-0772720757|edition=1st|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bolzetta was the primary publisher for the Ricovrati of Padua, the same academy which Miani was in contact with.&lt;ref name="Female6"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rees|first1=Katie|title=Female-Authored Drama in Early Modern Padua: Valeria Miani Negri|journal=Italian Studies|date=2008|volume=63|issue=1|pages=41–61|doi=10.1179/007516308X270128}}&lt;/ref&gt; By publishing Amorosa Speranza, Miani became the third woman in Italy to have ever published a nonreligious play. The play Amorosa Speranza appears to have not been written for print, but rather for performance. Multiple times during the play the performer addresses the audience, even so much as having the prologue of the performance primarily spoken to the audience.&lt;ref name="Female6"/&gt; The plot of Amorosa Speranza revolves around the life of the virtuous sprite Venelia, who has been abandoned by her husband following their wedding night. Venezia struggles throughout the play to rid herself of the unwanted advances of two shepherds, Alliseo, and Isandro.&lt;ref name="Female6"/&gt;

In Amorosa Speranza, Miani shields her two main characters from the satyrs and their deviance by having a third nymph be the one to outsmart and trick the satyr. By this third nymph deceiving the satyr who would want to do her harm, she is emphasizing the independence and autonomy that her female characters have within the story.&lt;ref name="Satyr6"/&gt;

===Celinda, A Tragedy===

Miani's second published work, Celinda, a Tragedy, was published seven years after Amorosa Speranza, in 1611. The publishing of this play marked the first known tragedy written and published by an Italian woman.&lt;ref name="Female6"/&gt; Just as Amorosa Speranza was, Celinda, a Tragedy was published by the official publisher for the Ricovrati, Francesco Bolzetta.&lt;ref name="Satyr6"/&gt; During the time when Celinda was published, the tragedy genre was exploding in popularity, with approximately 60 new tragedies published in 1611.&lt;ref name="Muse2"/&gt; While Celinda enjoyed popularity in print, there is no record of it ever making it to the stage.&lt;ref name="Celinda.3"/&gt; This was due in part to the fact that audiences considered tragedies bad omens to watch. Additionally, these performances were very expensive to put on, due to the cost of hiring actors, and having to recreate the bloody and violent imagery detailed in the play. The plot of Celinda, a Tragedy follows the story of the title character, 15 year old princess Celinda, and her prohibited relationship with Persian prince Autilio.&lt;ref name="Celinda.3"/&gt; Despite the fact that the two meet under false pretenses, with Autilio disguised as a woman, they fall in love. The entirety of the play details the horror and tragedy that befalls the two young lovers, complete with suicide and vendettas, both common motifs in the tragedy genre.&lt;ref name="Female6"/&gt;

The VDID is an [[Professional association|association]] of [[Germans|German]] designers founded to promote the exchange of [[knowledge]], [[idea]]s, professionalism, [[friendship]], and support to all members to assist in the everyday working environment and [[career]] of industrial designers. The VDID works as a [[mediation|mediator]] between industry and designers, as well as [[politics]] and the [[economy]]. This organization is a sister organization to the [[Industrial Designers Society of America]] (IDSA) through the [[International Council of Societies of Industrial Design]]&lt;ref name="ICSID"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.icsid.org/ |title=ICSID Site |access-date=2009-09-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090906041307/http://www.icsid.org/ |archive-date=2009-09-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (ICSID).

==History==
Seven professional industrial designers that later were referred to in [[publications]] and in the media as the "7", joined together to found the VDID in 1959. These seven designers are Professor Arno Votteler, Professor [[Hans Erich Slany]], Hans-Theo Baumann,&lt;ref name="Baumann"&gt;[http://www.kettererkunst.com/bio/hans-theo-baumann-1924.shtml Hans-Theo Baumann Biography on Ketterer Kunst]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Baumann2"&gt;[http://www.art-directory.info/design/hans-theo-baumann-1924/index.shtml Baumann Biography on Art Director Design]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herbert Hirche]],&lt;ref name="Hirche2"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.architonic.com/1003961 |title=Herbert Hirche works |access-date=2009-07-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090510153659/http://www.architonic.com/1003961 |archive-date=2009-05-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[:de:Günter Kupetz|(de)Günter Kupetz]], Rainer Schütze, and [[:de:Peter Raacke|(de)Peter Raacke]]. They believed that designers needed an association to promote professional advocacy, support them in both legal and educational issues, and to represent the [[profession]] to the [[general public|public]]. Around that same time they joined the ICSID as a full member. VDID also works closely with the German Fashion and Textile Design Association (VDMD)&lt;ref name="VDMD"&gt;[http://www.vdmd.de/de/ VDMD Site]&lt;/ref&gt; under the umbrella of the German Designer Association (DDV).&lt;ref name="DDV"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.vdid.de/index_vdid.html |title=DDV Site |access-date=2009-07-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090312053226/http://www.vdid.de/index_vdid.html |archive-date=2009-03-12 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibitions, Meetings, Contests and Design Awards==
The VDID promotes many other organizations within Germany and all of [[Europe]] by promoting exhibits, awards, and contests within the profession of [[industrial design]]. To accomplish this, there are [[regional]] as well as [[nation]]al meetings held regularly. The VDID sponsors such events as visiting the [[Porsche]] Museum, lectures on [[rapid prototyping]], and [[lecture]] series by well known designers. While they support many competitions, these two are specific to the VDID:
* VDID Student Design Competition
* VDID Paper AB Competition

It was declared [[treasure trove|treasure]] and valued at £350,000—the highest reward granted under the [[Treasure Act 1996]] up to the time.

The hoard consists of two sets of jewellery of a very high purity of [[gold]] dating from 75–25 BCE. Although, the items pre-date the [[Roman conquest of Britain]] in 43 CE, the manufacturing technology was Roman rather than Celtic. The total weight of the items is nearly {{convert|1160|g|oz|abbr=on}}.

The find was described as "the most important discovery of Iron Age gold objects" for fifty years;&lt;ref name="tar2000"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncmd.co.uk/docs/treasurereport2000.pdf|title=Treasure Annual Report 2000|publisher=[[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]]|pages=16–18;133|year=2001|accessdate=2010-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the items were probably an "expensive", "[[diplomatic gift]]".&lt;ref name="times"/&gt; The brooches alone were "the third discovery of its kind from [[Great Britain|Britain]]".

The Winchester Hoard is now housed at the [[British Museum]] in London.

==Discovery and valuation==
The hoard was discovered near Winchester over a series of trips to a farmer's ploughed field in September, October, and December, 2000&lt;ref name="tar2000"/&gt; by retired florist&lt;ref name="times"/&gt;&lt;ref name="guard"/&gt; and amateur metal detectorist Kevan Halls.&lt;ref name="bm"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_prb/t/the_winchester_hoard.aspx|title=The Winchester hoard|publisher=[[British Museum]]|accessdate=2010-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first discovery, which was of the brooches,&lt;ref name="soc"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.le.ac.uk/has/ps/past/past38.html|title=Prehistoric Society - Past No. 38|date=August 2001|publisher=[[The Prehistoric Society]]|work=Newsletter Number 38|accessdate=2010-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="club"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fieldclub.hants.org.uk/publications/news43/arch43d.html|title=Conference report - Hampshire in the Iron Age: A Special Place?|author=Ainsworth, Kay|year=2005|publisher=Hampshire Field Club &amp; Archaeological Society|work=Newsletter 43 - Spring 2005|accessdate=2010-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; was reported to the [[Portable Antiquities Scheme]], and archaeologists attached to the British Museum were able to excavate the find site to ascertain the historical context of the find.&lt;ref name="bm"/&gt; No evidence of a settlement or temple, by way of architectural remnants, was found.&lt;ref name="bm"/&gt;&lt;ref name="soc"/&gt; It was more likely that the hoard was buried "on top of a small hill... covered with trees".&lt;ref name="bm"/&gt;

The hoard was declared [[treasure trove|treasure]] following a [[Inquests in England and Wales|coroner's inquest]], and later valued at £350,000,&lt;ref name="times"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tar2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="art"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artfund.org/artwork/8057/winchester-hoard|title=Winchester Hoard by Iron Age|publisher=[[The Art Fund]]|accessdate=2010-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was shared between finder and landowner under the [[Treasure Act 1996]] – the highest reward granted under that Act at that time.&lt;ref name="times"/&gt; It was also the first time the context of a find was investigated by the British Museum in conjunction with said Act.&lt;ref name="soc"/&gt;

==Items discovered==
The hoard contains two sets of gold jewellery;&lt;ref name="tar2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="club"/&gt; each includes a [[torc]], a pair of [[brooch]]es, or [[fibula]]e,&lt;ref name="soc"/&gt; linked by a chain (of which only one chain was found), and a [[bracelet]] (of which one was broken in half). They were all made with a very high gold content – between 91% and 99% – determined by [[X-ray fluorescence]] tests at the British Museum.&lt;ref name="tar2000"/&gt; The total weight of the hoard is {{convert|1158.8|g| oz|abbr=on}} (37.25 [[troy]] ounces).&lt;ref name="tar2000"/&gt; It is dated from 75–25 BC,&lt;ref name="bm"/&gt; which places it in the Late [[British Iron Age]].

All of the brooches are of a bow type, with two being further classified as ''Knotenfibeln'' ("interlace fibulas"),&lt;ref name="tar2000"/&gt; typical of [[La Tène style]]&lt;ref name="soc"/&gt; The chain is of gold wire, interlinked, with a hook at either end to attach to each pair of brooches. The bracelets are, or were in the case of the broken one, [[penannular|ring shaped]]. The ends of the torcs exhibit some ornamentation ([[Granulation (jewellery)|granulation]]), and in the case of the smaller one, [[filigree]]. Both granulation and filigree had been attached by diffusion [[solder]]ing.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/archaeology/excavations_techniques/fact_files_02.shtml|title=Hidden Treasure Fact Files|author=Faulkner, Dr Neil|date=11 May 2009|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=2010-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the torcs is larger than the other, so it is assumed that each was intended for different sexes,&lt;ref name="bm"/&gt; and that the items had been worn.&lt;ref name="times"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tar2000"/&gt;

==Significance==
The find was called "the most important discovery of Iron Age gold objects"&lt;ref name="tar2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bm"/&gt; since the [[Snettisham Hoard]], over fifty years previously.&lt;ref name="club"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; The objects were also described as "unique", "very unusual"&lt;ref name="tar2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="club"/&gt; and even "iconic".&lt;ref name="times"/&gt;

Given that gold brooches from the Iron Age are more rare than silver ones—in fact, this was only the third discovery of its kind from Britain, and one of "less than a dozen" from Northern Europe&lt;ref name="tar2000"/&gt;—it was possible to date the hoard more accurately by these.&lt;ref name="tar2000"/&gt; However, the torcs were unusual in that no others of this type had been found from Iron Age Britain,&lt;ref name="soc"/&gt; indeed Europe, up until then. The design was close to typical Iron Age torcs, but were made "using [[Roman empire|Roman]] or [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic Greek]] technology",&lt;ref name="guard"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tar2000"/&gt; although this was several years before the Roman conquest of Britain in 43 AD – in other words, the execution was beyond the manufacturing knowledge of the [[Celts]],&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; and a link between Britain, Rome and Greece before such historical events.&lt;ref name="times"/&gt;&lt;ref name="guard"/&gt; Moreover, social changes in Hampshire and [[West Sussex]] in the first century BC were highlighted.&lt;ref name="soc"/&gt;

The dichotomy of Roman craftmanship against "[[Barbarian]] taste"&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; was further reinforced by Dr Jeremy Hills, who compiled both the British Museum and Treasure Annual Report for the hoard,&lt;ref name="tar2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bm"/&gt; by stating, "I would have liked them to have been made in Britain, but they weren't... They're massive, chunky and showy. No self-respecting Greek or Roman would have worn anything as gaudy".&lt;ref name="times"/&gt;

It was determined that the hoard was not associated with [[grave goods]], and was not part of a hoard associated with a settlement or religious location. It may, instead, have been a personal collection or [[votive offering]].&lt;ref name="bm"/&gt; Hills further conjectured that "[t]hey were a very expensive gift, a major diplomatic gift",&lt;ref name="times"/&gt; and that in doing so the Romans were "winning friends and influencing them", ultimately "conquering them that way".&lt;ref name="times"/&gt; Ingratiating themselves with pro-Roman tribal kings, the Romans would have found it easier to quell internal unrest, thus making the recipients "puppet rulers beholden to the superpower of their age".&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;

Who the recipient, or indeed the giver, of the "gift" was is still unknown. However, it could have a link to the [[Gaul]] [[turncoat]], [[Commius]], who eventually became king of the [[Atrebates]] after fleeing a position as aide to [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]] which he took up in 56 BC.&lt;ref name="times"/&gt;

==Display==
The hoard is now housed in Room 50&lt;ref name="bm"/&gt; of the British Museum in London and was part of the ''Buried Treasure: Finding Our Past'' exhibition (November 2003 — November 2005).&lt;ref&gt;The exhibition travelled from London to  the [[National Museum Cardiff]], the [[Manchester Museum]], the [[Hancock Museum]] in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], and the [[Norwich Castle]] Museum.&lt;/ref&gt; Among other items in the exhibition were the [[Mildenhall Treasure]], the [[Lewis chessmen]], and the [[Ringlemere Cup]].&lt;ref name="buried"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/museum_in_london/london_exhibition_archive/archive_buried_treasure.aspx|title=Buried Treasure: Finding Our Past|publisher=[[British Museum]]|accessdate=2010-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2003, [[BBC Two]] screened a documentary on the discovery of the hoard.&lt;ref name="times"/&gt;
