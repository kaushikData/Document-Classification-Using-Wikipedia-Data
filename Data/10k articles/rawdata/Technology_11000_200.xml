'''Acacia Research Corporation''' is an American company based in [[Newport Beach, California]], that works to license patents and perform relevant legal action such as dealing with [[patent infringement]].

Acacia is sometimes referred to as a [[Patent troll|non-practicing entity]] because the company derives revenue from licenses and lawsuits rather than from building products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Troll Toll How "patent assertion entities" stifle innovation.

'''Adolf Zethelius''' (born ''Erik Adolf Zethelius''; 19 February 1781{{snd}}7 March 7, 1864) was a [[Swedes|Swedish]] [[silversmith]] and [[industrialist]] and owner of the Swedish [[ironworks]] [[Surahammar]]s bruk and [[Nyby bruk]].

==Silversmith==
The [[Globus cruciger|orb]], [[sceptre]] and [[anointing horn]] which are part of the [[Norwegian Royal Regalia]] were commissioned by King [[Charles XIV John|Charles John]] and made by Zethelius in Stockholm  for the King's [[coronation]] as [[King of Norway]] in 1818.&lt;ref&gt;Trondheim Cathedral – [https://info.ovf-nett.no/id/27217.0 The Norwegian Royal Regalia] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415172931/https://info.ovf-nett.no/id/27217.0 |date=April 15, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Works by Zethelius are also exhibited at [[Nationalmuseum]] and [[Hallwyl Palace]] in [[Stockholm]].

==Industrialist==
Zethelius acquired the manor house Nyby, near [[Torshälla]], from his father-in-law [[Eric Nordewall]], and in 1829 founded the [[ironworks]] [[Nyby bruk]] on the site.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nordisk familjebok]], ''Adolf Zethelius''&lt;/ref&gt;

Zethelius had the [[manor house]] of [[Surahammars herrgård]] constructed 1856–1858.&lt;ref&gt;Svensk Silversmide, Andrén, Hellner, Hernmarck &amp; Holmquist, Stockholm 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aldrin''' is an [[organochlorine compound|organochlorine]] [[insecticide]] that was widely used until the 1990s, when it was banned in most countries. It is a colourless solid. Before the ban, it was heavily used as a pesticide to treat seed and soil.  Aldrin and related "cyclodiene" pesticides (a term for pesticides derived from [[Hexachlorocyclopentadiene]]) became notorious as [[persistent organic pollutant]]s.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;Robert L. Metcalf "Insect Control" in Ullmann’s Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry" Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2002. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a14_263}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
Aldrin is produced by combining [[hexachlorocyclopentadiene]] with [[norbornadiene]] in a [[Diels-Alder reaction]] to give the adduct.&lt;ref name="Tedder"&gt;{{cite book |first=A. H. | last=Jubb |year=1975
  | title=Basic Organic Chemistry, Part 5 Industrial products | publisher=Wiley
  | location=London | isbn=0-471-85014-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:AldrinSynthesis.png|thumbnail|left|470px|Synthesis of aldrin via a [[Diels-Alder reaction]]]]{{clear|left}}

Similarly, an [[isomer]] of aldrin, known as '''isodrin''', is produced by reaction of hexachloronobornadiene with [[cyclopentadiene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1039/JR9610004809 | title = 946. Cyclisations and rearrangements in the isodrin?aldrin series | year = 1961 | last1 = Bird | first1 = C. W. | last2 = Cookson | first2 = R. C. | last3 = Crundwell | first3 = E. | journal = Journal of the Chemical Society (Resumed) | pages = 4809 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aldrin is named after the German chemist [[Kurt Alder]], one of the coinventors of this kind of reaction.  An estimated 270 million kilograms of aldrin and related cyclodiene pesticides were produced between 1946 and 1976.

In soil, on plant surfaces, or in the digestive tracts of insects, aldrin oxidizes to the [[epoxide]] [[dieldrin]], which is more strongly insecticidal.

==Environmental impact and regulation==
Like related polychlorinated pesticides, aldrin is highly lipophilic.  Its solubility in water is only 0.027&amp;nbsp;mg/L, which exacerbates its persistence in the environment.  It was banned by the [[Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants]].  In the U.S., aldrin was cancelled in 1974. The substance is banned from use for plant protection by the [[European Union|EU]].&lt;ref name=bnpuk&gt;{{cite web

  | date = 
  | url = http://www.pesticides.gov.uk/approvals.asp?id=55
  | doi =
  | accessdate = 1 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Safety and environmental aspects==
Aldrin has rat {{LD50}} of 39 to 60&amp;nbsp;mg/kg (oral in rats).  For fish however, it is extremely toxic, with an [[LC50]] of 0.006 – 0.01 for [[trout]] and [[bluegill]].&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt;

In the US, aldrin is considered a potential occupational carcinogen by the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] and the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]]; these agencies have set an occupational exposure limit for dermal exposures at 0.25&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; over an eight-hour time-weighted average.&lt;ref name=pocket&gt;{{cite web

  | coauthors = 
  | title = Aldrin

  | url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npg/npgd0016.html
  | doi =
  | accessdate = 13 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Further, an [[IDLH]] limit has been set at 25&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, based on acute toxicity data in humans to which subjects reacted with convulsions within 20 minutes of exposure.&lt;ref name=idlh&gt;{{cite web
  | last = [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]

It is classified as an [[List of extremely hazardous substances|extremely hazardous substance]] in the United States as defined in Section 302 of the U.S. [[Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act]] (42 U.S.C. 11002), and is subject to strict reporting requirements by facilities which produce, store, or use it in significant quantities.&lt;ref name="gov-right-know"&gt;{{Cite journal | publisher = [[United States Government Publishing Office|Government Printing Office]] | title = 40 C.F.R.: Appendix A to Part 355—The List of Extremely Hazardous Substances and Their Threshold Planning Quantities | url = http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2008/julqtr/pdf/40cfr355AppA.pdf | edition = July 1, 2008 | accessdate = October 29, 2011 | postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''beer tower''', also known as a '''portable [[beer tap]], a tabletop beer dispenser, a triton dispenser''' or a '''giraffe''', is a [[beer]] dispensing device, usually found in [[Bar (establishment)|bars]], [[pub]]s and [[Restaurant|restaurants]]. The idea behind beer towers is that several patrons in a group can serve themselves the amount of beer they want without having to order individually.

The device comes in a variety of sizes, most often double to triple the size of standard beer pitchers that hold around {{Convert|48-60|USoz|liter}} of beer.&lt;ref name="boston1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.boston.com/yourtown/news/allston_brighton/2011/03/boston_licensing_officials_ban.html | title=Boston licensing officials suspend use of large, portable "beer towers" | publisher=Boston.com | date=29 March 2011 | accessdate=24 April 2014 | author=Rocheleau, Matt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early versions came in the shape of a four-foot tall plastic cylinder attached to a beer tap at the bottom. Current models sometimes have several dispensing valves, to allow for simultaneous dispense. 

Chilling of the beer is usually achieved with ice chambers or with freezable ice packs, which may be internal (traditional) or external (for increased hygiene when handling). 

The actual dispense mechanism is usually in the form of a simplified [[beer tap]] or a bespoke [https://patents.google.com/patent/US8973787 patented pouring mechanism.].

==History==
[[File:Beer tower.jpg|thumb|A beer tower in Warsaw, Poland]]
The ancestor of the modern beer tower was called a '''portable keg tap''' or a '''picnic tap''', since the device was mostly used at outdoor events, such as picnics. They were significantly larger than modern beer towers. The method involved manually pumping air into the beer container; the resulting pressure within the container would force the beer out the tap. There was also a variant with lager beer barrels that stood upright, allowing [[gravity]] to force the beer out the tap, which is the principle of the modern day system.

==Usage==

===Southeast Asia and Australia===

The beer tower is popular in bars and clubs throughout Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, and the Philippines. Since 2012, the beer tower has appeared in Australian bars after first being used in Queensland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/questnews/city/beer-towers-draw-big-business-in-brisbane/story-fni9r0jy-1226700819554 | title=Beer towers draw big business in Brisbane | publisher=Courier Mail | date=21 August 2013 | accessdate=24 April 2014 | author=Tutty, Jacinda}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===

In March 2011, Boston licensing officials forbade bars from serving beer in beer towers. The officials required licensed alcohol serving businesses to request permission to use these beverage dispensers.&lt;ref name="boston1" /&gt;

===India===

Self-service tabletop beer dispensers have been in use in India at least since 2017. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.brewer-world.com/2017/05/27/dispensing-beer-triton-way/|title=Dispensing Beer the Triton Way - Brewer World Magazine|website=www.brewer-world.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14725">'''Bus encoding''' refers to converting/encoding a piece of data to another form before launching on the [[bus (computing)|bus]]. While bus encoding can be used to serve various purposes like reducing the number of pins, compressing the data to be transmitted, reducing cross-talk between bit lines, etc., it is one of the popular techniques used in system design to reduce dynamic power consumed by the [[system bus]].&lt;ref name="RTL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="devdasmalik"/&gt; Bus encoding aims to reduce the [[Hamming distance]] between 2 consecutive values on the bus. Since the activity is directly proportional to the Hamming distance, bus encoding proves to be effective in reducing the overall activity factor thereby reducing the dynamic power consumption in the system.

In the context of this article, a system can refer to anything where data is transferred from one element to another over bus (viz. [[System on a Chip]] (SoC), a computer system, an [[embedded system]] on board, etc.).

== Motivation ==
Power consumption in electronic systems is a matter of concern today for the below reasons:
# ''Battery-operated devices'': Due to ubiquity of battery operated devices and the need to maximize the duration between two subsequent charging of the battery, it is necessary that the system consumes as less power (and energy) as possible.
# ''Environmental constraints'': In an attempt to protect the environment, we need to conserve the usable energy. Since the energy consumed by electronic systems is increasing drastically, minimizing the energy consumption of electronic systems is critical to save the environment.
# ''Power dissipation'': As per the [[Moore's law]], semiconductor devices have been packing more and more transistors in smaller amount of area. This leads to higher power dissipation per unit area and makes packaging and thermal cooling system design complex and costly. Hence, low power electronic systems are needed to tackle this issue.

The dynamic power dissipated by an electronic circuit is directly proportional to the activity factor and the load capacitance as seen by the output of the logic gate. In case of a bus, the load capacitance is usually high since bus needs to be connected to multiple modules and routed longer and the activity factor is also high. Due to higher value of load capacitance and activity factor, in a typical system, bus power consumption can contribute up to 50% of the total power consumption. Bus encoding aims to reduce this power by reducing the amount of activity (number of toggles) in the bus lines. While the kind of bus encoding to be used for a particular system can be best determined when the target application and environmental constraints about the system are known apriori, described below are some bus encoding techniques which can help reduce bus power for most systems. Hence bus encoding is important for any electronic system design.

== Examples of bus encoding to achieve low power==
Following are some of the implementations to use bus encoding for reducing dynamic power consumption in different scenarios:
# ''[[Gray encoding]]'':&lt;ref name="massoud"/&gt; The address lines of a bus in most of the computing systems increase in consecutive numerical values due to [[Locality of reference|spatial locality]]. If we use regular binary coding for the bus, we are not assured of minimal Hamming distance between 2 consecutive addresses. Using Gray codes for encoding the address lines will lead to a Hamming distance of 1 between any 2 consecutive address bus values (as long as spatial locality holds). There are variations to this scheme named Shifted Gray encoding to reduce the delay overhead.&lt;ref name="Shifted_Gray"/&gt;
# ''Sequential addressing or T0 codes'':&lt;ref name="Zero-Transition_1997"/&gt; In case of address bus, due to spatial locality that exists in programs, most of the transitions involve changing the address to the next consecutive value. A possible encoding scheme is to use an additional line, INC, in the bus indicating whether the current transition is the next increment address or not. If it is not a consecutive address, then the receiver can use the value on the bus. But if it is a consecutive address, the transmitter need not change the value in the bus, but just assert the INC line to 1. In such case, for a continuous addressing scheme, there is no transition at all on the bus, leading to a bus activity factor of 0.
# ''Number representation'': Let us consider an example of a system which gets one of its data from a sensor. Most of the times, the sensor may be measuring some noise and for this example, let us consider that the values being measured are (0) and (-1) alternatively. For a 32-bit data bus, value 0 translates to 0x00000000 (0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000) while (-1) translates to 0xFFFFFFFF (1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111) in a 2’s complement representation. We see that the Hamming distance in this case is 32 (since all 32-bits are changing their state). Instead, if we encode the bus to use signed integer representation (MSB is sign bit), we can represent 0 as 0x00000000 (0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000) and -1 as 0x80000001  (1000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0001) . In this case, we see that the Hamming distance between the numbers is just 2. Hence by using a 2’s complement to signed arithmetic encoding, we are able to reduce the activity from a factor of 32 to 2.
# ''[[Inversion encoding]]'':&lt;ref name="Stan_1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Inversion"/&gt; This is another implementation of bus encoding where an additional line named INV is added to the bus lines. Depending on the value of the INV line, the other lines will be used with or without inversion. e.g. if INV line is 0, the data on the bus is sampled as it is but if INV line is 1, the data on the bus is inverted before any processing on it. Referring to the example used in 3, instead of using a signed integer representation, we could continue using 2’s complement and achieve the same activity reduction using inversion encoding. So, 0 will be represented as 0x00000000 with INV=0 and -1 will be represented as 0x00000000 with INV=1. Since INV=1, receiver will invert the data before consuming it, thereby converting it to 0xFFFFFFFF internally. In this case, only 1 bit (INV bit) is changed over bus leading to an activity of factor 1. In general, in inversion encoding, the encoder computes the Hamming distance between the current value and next value and based on that, determines whether to use INV=0 or INV=1.
# ''Value cache'':&lt;ref name="Yang"/&gt; This is another form of Bus encoding, primarily used for external (off-chip) Busses. A dictionary (value cache) is maintained at both the sender and receiver end about some of the commonly shared data patterns. Instead of passing the data patterns each time, the sender just toggles one bit indicating which entry from value cache to be used at the receiver end. Only for values which are not present in the value cache, the complete data is sent over the bus. There has been various modified implementations of this technique with an intent to maximize the hits for the value cache, but the underlying idea is the same.&lt;ref name="Basu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lin"/&gt;
# ''Other techniques'' like sector-based encoding,&lt;ref name="Sector"/&gt; variations of inversion coding, have also been proposed. There has been work on using bus encodings which lower the leakage power consumption as well along with reducing the crosstalk with minimal impact on path delays.&lt;ref name="Deogun"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Khan"/&gt;

== Implementation method ==
In case of SoC designs, bus encoding schemes can be best implemented in RTL by instantiating dedicated encoders and decoders over the bus. Another way it could be implemented is by passing hint to the synthesis tool either as a trace of the simulation&lt;ref name="VLSI"/&gt; or by using synthesis pragma to define the type of encoding needed.

On board, a small low power IC can be deployed in between the master and slave modules on the bus to implement the encoding and decoding functions.

== Properties of the encoding function ==
The bus encoding/decoding function must be a [[bijection]]. This essentially requires encoding function to possess below behavior:&lt;ref name="massoud"/&gt;
# Every data to be launched on the bus must have a unique encoded value and every encoded value must uniquely decode to the same original value.
# It must be possible to encode and decode all the values which can be generated by the source.

== Trade-off / analysis ==
* While adding of bus encoding reduces the activity factor over the bus and leads to reduction in dynamic power, addition of encoders and decoders around the bus causes additional circuitry to be added to the design, which also consume certain amount of dynamic power. We must factor this while computing the power savings.
* The additional circuitry will also increase the leakage power of the design/circuit/system/SoC. If the base activity factor of the system bus is not very high, bus encoding may not be a very viable option since it will degrade overall energy consumption due to higher leakage power.
* If the bus timing is in the critical data path, adding of additional circuitry in the path will degrade the timing path and may prove detrimental. This analysis needs to be done carefully to determine what kind of bus encoding to use.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7821">'''CMX Editing Systems''' (also known as CMX Systems) was a company founded jointly by [[CBS]] and [[Memorex]]; with help from many individuals such as Ronald Lee Martin, who later became a head of [[Universal Studios]]; that developed some of the very first computerized systems for [[linear editing|linear]] and [[non-linear editing|non-linear]] editing of [[videotape]] for [[post production]].  The company's name,  CMX, stood for '''C'''BS, '''M'''emorex, and e'''X'''perimental.

[[Image:CMX-IMG_9559.JPG|right|thumb|250px|CMX keyboard]]

Headquartered in [[Sunnyvale, California]], the company pioneered in integrating computers with videotape editing, starting in 1971 with the [[CMX 600]], the first non-linear video editing system.  The 600 was designed primarily for [[off-line editing]], by creating both a [[rough cut]] edit of a video program, along with an [[edit decision list]], or EDL.  It stored its video &amp; audio content on [[disk pack]] drives supplied by Memorex for instant [[random access]] of the video content.  The 600 was paired with the CMX-200, which took the edit decision list created by the 600, and automatically controlled several [[VTR]]s to auto-assemble the final program.  The 600 was controlled using a [[Digital Equipment Corporation|Digital]] [[PDP-11]] minicomputer, and the 200 used a [[Teletype Model 33]] terminal to input EDLs from the 600.

CMX also developed the CMX-300 in 1972, a system used for [[online editing]] (and CMX's first online product).  It was a computer-controlled linear editing system, with support for up to four VTRs, and also included and controlled a simple video mixer for wipes and fades.  The edits were input to the 300 (and displayed) using a [[Digital Equipment Corporation|Digital]] [[VT-05]] terminal.

CMX would later develop more advanced systems such as the 340 in 1976, and the CMX Edge, which could be used for both on and off-line editing.

CMX was sold to [[John Herbert Orr]]'s company Orrox in 1974, and then moved its headquarters to [[Santa Clara, California]].  It was then later purchased by [[Chyron Corporation|Chyron]], and remained under its ownership until 1998, when Chyron announced that it would discontinue all CMX products.

During the mid-1980s, CMX hardware comprised 90% of all video editing systems used for post-production video editing.

The CMX keyboard control style was used as a basis of several other editing systems, including [[Grass Valley (company)|Grass Valley]], Calaway and Strassner Editing Systems.

==Models==
* CMX-200 - A [[Teletype Model 33|Teletype]] driven auto-assembly system released in 1971. It was used to load the [[Edit decision list|edit lists]] produced by the CMX-600 to control source and record [[Quadruplex videotape|Quad VTRs]] and built the program.
* CMX-300 - Introduced at [[NAB Show|NAB]] 1972, it was CMX's first [[Edit decision list|EDL]]-based online editor. It could control up to four VTR's (generally [[Quadruplex videotape|2" Quadruplex VTR's]]) with a simple audio mixer and video switcher.

I consisted in a DEC [[PDP-11]] computer, [[Disk pack|disk packs]] and a console for the editor/operator. Each 29 MB [[Hard disk drive platter|disc platter]] held  5 minutes of half resolution black &amp; white moving images, audio and what would later become [[SMPTE timecode]]. The CMX 600 output was [[Punched tape|punch tape]] designed to be used by the CMX 200 linear online assembly system.

* OMNI-500 - A scaled-down version of the OMNI 1000. It used the same platform but was limited to the control 5 devices concurrently.
* OMNI-1000 - An entirely redesign hardware platform that could control up to 10 devices concurrently including analog and digital [[Video tape recorder|VTR]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s and [[Tape recorder|ATR]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, [[Vision mixer|video switchers]] (with their effects timeline separately), and video post production [[Mixing console|audio mixers]]. It had a color [[Graphical user interface|GUI]] and was develop on an early version of [[X Window System|X-Windows]]. The OMNI series editors had their jog know integrated into the keyboard.
* OMNI-1000E - It featured an enhanced keyboard that included assignable dials with mini-display along with an integrated 3.5" floppy disk unit above the jog knob.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11498">'''Caswell-Massey''', founded in 1752, is the first [[fragrance]] and [[personal care]] product company in America. Originally, Caswell Massey started as an [[apothecary]] shop in [[Newport, Rhode Island]], by a [[Scotland|Scottish]]-born doctor named William Hunter.&lt;ref&gt;“Caswell-Massey Timetable”, by Wermuth/Reed Associates; part of company archives.&lt;/ref&gt; The main product categories include fine-fragrance, soap, bath &amp; body products, men's shaving products and [[toiletries]], other assorted [[apothecary]]-style personal care accessories. Its products are preferred favorites of notable historical figures such as: [[John F. Kennedy|JFK]], [[George Washington]], [[Cole Porter]], [[Alla Nazimova]], [[John Denver]], and [[The Rolling Stones]].

The company is regarded as the fourth-oldest continuously operating company in America and the oldest American consumer [[brand]] in operation. The current motto of is "America's Original".

==1752&amp;ndash;1755==
Dr. William Hunter established ''Dr. Hunters Dispensary'' in Newport in 1752. Caswell Massey began as an apothecary shop selling medical supplies. Hunter gave the first lectures on anatomy and surgery in the Colonies in 1755. During that time, he also invented [[orange soda]] to help his customers take the medicines sold in his apothecary shop.

==1789&amp;ndash;1800==
[[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]], [[Rhode Island]], at the time, was a destination for the social elite to buy European-style luxuries. While selling medical products, Dr. Hunter also began selling cosmetic, personal care, and hygiene products and developed a business in medicinal essential oils, such as [[lavender]] and [[verbena]]. He also imported fragrances from Europe, and blended 20 of his own different colognes, numbered One through Twenty; Dr. Hunter's Cologne Number Six was often purchased by [[George Washington]] and was given as a gift by the President to the [[Marquis de Lafayette]], and thereby became very popular among many politicians and intellectuals in early American society after Independence. During the same time, White Rose perfume was introduced for women, and became a favorite of [[Dolly Madison]], who was rumored to bathe in the perfume. The shop was also known for its very high-quality [[castille soap]], which was purchased by [[Lewis and Clark]] for their Western expedition.

==1800&amp;ndash;1840==
For approximately the first three-quarters of a century the apothecary shop changed owners in the traditional way; each retiring pharmacist handing over the keys to his [[apprentice]]. Dr. William Hunter was followed by his son, also William Hunter; then followed by Charles Feke, who in turn was followed by Rowland Hazard in 1822. Hazard took Philip Caswell into partnership and the name became Hazard &amp; Caswell. In 1833 following Rowland Hazard’s death the company became Caswell &amp; Hazard. In the same year, the first Caswell-Hazard branch opened in New York City.

==1840&amp;ndash;1906==
A fragrance called Jockey Club was introduced in 1840. The company during that time also continued to expand its line to include other apothecary products including cucumber night cream, oatmeal soaps, goats milk soaps, and other items. In the 1850s, Hazard formed a partnership with Phillip Caswell, and later in 1867, was joined by both John R. Caswell (Phillips Brother) and J. Hazard (Rowland's Brother or son?).

Phillip Caswell resigned from the partnership in 1872, and sold his shares to Rowland Hazard; John Caswell set up shops and continued the business in parallel to the Hazard business during this time, and a lawsuit was undertaken in 1876 over the rights to be the successor of both the 'Caswell' name and the 'Established 1780 AD' trademark, as well as the books of formulations, Caswell was triumphant in the suit, proving in the court records that in fact, they had sold the physical shops and the shop fixtures and stock in labels, but not the rights to the name or the formulations.

It is unclear, but it appears that the Hazards were given the exclusive right to claim the 'Established 1780 AD' mark; but in fact, Caswell also succeeded on this point, as it was later established that the business was in fact established by Dr. Hunter in 1752 and not by Feke in 1780 - that had merely been the aforementioned ruse that was used to prevent the firm from being confiscated under disloyalty to the new American government. The company took its present name, Caswell-Massey, when then-owner John Rose Caswell formed a partnership with New York businessman William Massey in 1876. With rightful ownership of the original formulations of Dr. Hunter and a new partnership with William Massey, a Canadian doctor, the firm rightly claimed the 'Established 1752' trademark and provenance for their brand. In that year the company operated two stores, one in Newport and one in New York City. John R. Caswell and William Massey continued to operate in New York City and Newport, RI, until 1906 when the business was incorporated as the Caswell-Massey Company under the guidance of George C. Lyon and John C. Knight of the Hall &amp; Lyon Company of Providence, Rhode Island; the business continued to grow to ten stores, but was reduced to two stores by 1915.

==1906&amp;ndash;1936==
During the early to mid-1900s, the apothecary business expanded its service to provide 'custom' perfumes and fragrances as private stock for its most notable customers. Customers who used this service were interviewed on their tastes in food, music, and lifestyle, and given five fragrances to try. After a period of time, their favorite fragrance was selected and five variants of that fragrance were created. After a final period of wearing these, the customer's signature fragrance was refined and bottled and could be ordered on demand. This was an expensive service at the time, costing customers up to $200 per ounce. 

Customers to the Caswell-Massey stores during this time included many notable New Yorkers, as well as Broadway stars such as Alla Nazimova, and New York elite such as the Astors and Vanderbilts;&lt;ref&gt;Caswell-Massey products can be found on display in the Vanderbilt Mansion in Hyde Park, New York&lt;/ref&gt; George Gershwin, Judy Garland, Katharine Hepburn and Greta Garbo.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;“''The Amazing World of Caswell-Massey''”, Cosmopolitan Magazine, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; In 1926 a store was opened on Lexington (the 48th in New York City), in what was then the Barclay Hotel, later [[InterContinental New York Barclay Hotel]]. ( It remained the company’s flagship store until 2010 when the Barclay's Hotel was closed for renovations). 

In 1936, Ralph Taylor and his younger brother Milton Taylor bought the company.  Ralph had been working for Caswell-Massey for twenty years since 1916 when a 13-year-old Ralph Taylor was hired to sweep the shop and clean bottles in the basement.  Unlike the previous owners, the Taylors retained the name Caswell-Massey, which had acquired a worldwide reputation during the 60 years under Caswell as one of the most important fragrances and soap brands in the world.

==1940&amp;ndash;1953==
In 1941, Caswell-Massey introduced Tricorn cologne and expanded its notoriety among the New York elite. The company's cold cream was a popular product for many [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] stars, and luminaries such as [[Cole Porter]] who wore the new Tricorn cologne.

==1960&amp;ndash;1988==
During the second half of the century, clients included United States President [[John F. Kennedy]], who wore Caswell Massey's Jockey Club cologne; his wife, [[Jacqueline Onassis]] (who bought [[avocado oil]]), and pop culture figures who shopped from the company's famously hand-illustrated direct mail catalog and who frequented the company's [[Lexington Avenue]] Store. Patrons at the Lexington &amp; 48th street store included [[Debbie Harry]], [[Joni Mitchell]], [[John Denver]], and the [[Rolling Stones]]. In the 1980s, the company expanded across the United States and added several overseas stores&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;. 

Caswell-Massey was managed by the Taylor family from 1936–1989. Milton's older son Adam joined the company in 1974 and soon rose to be president, and younger son Joshua joined in 1979. When they started working at Caswell-Massey, the company had only one store. However, the new younger Taylor blood injected fresh energy into the enterprise, and over the next ten years they added 20 more retail stores and about a dozen franchise stores, spread throughout the US and Canada.
Also during that time frame, Josh oversaw and overhauled the extensive product lines and assortments offered by the company, and introduced or re packaged 600 Caswell-Massey branded products, and together with the retail store expansion the company grew ten times in sales.

Josh created and introduced Greenbriar cologne in 1984.

==1988&amp;ndash;2007==
The Taylors sold the company to private owners in 1988; at the time, the company had over 28 stores in the US; the company continued with modest growth under new owners for several years before taking a downturn due to rising competition from mall competitors such as [[Crabtree &amp; Evelyn]] (founded in 1972) and [[Bath &amp; Body Works]] (founded in 1990) which offered similar products, albeit with less history. In 1999, after struggling for several years, Anne Robinson lead a buyout of the company. Under Anne Robinson's leadership, the company experienced a brief turnaround and celebrated its 250th anniversary in 2002. Modest growth and international business continued for the company. Anne Robinson departed the company in 2003. After trading hands between various investors, the company was purchased by its current ownership in 2007.

==Re-branding &amp; re-launch==
As of 2017, the company remains privately owned and operated in America, headquartered in [[Edison, New Jersey]], and New York City. The company re-branded in 2017 which included the launch of a new website and new catalog. Updated formulas of their "Heritage" men’s colognes and their "Centuries" collection have been re-released. Caswell also re-launched its essential oil business in collaboration with MKG Bio Alchemy, and is planning 2018 releases of new men's and women's fragrances in collaboration with the world-renowned [[New York Botanical Garden|New York Botanical Gardens]] and the [[International Flavors &amp; Fragrances|International Flavors and Fragrances]], Inc. Caswell Massey plans to re-release some of its private stock fragrances, such as "Marem": a fragrance originally created for silent film star [[Alla Nazimova]] in 1914, and "Supernatural Number 6": the fragrance favorite of [[George Washington]].

Caswell Massey continues to formulate and produce original, unique products that maintains a loyal client base. All of its fragrance and personal care items are still made in America, many using the original formulations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2360">In [[electronics]] and [[telecommunication]], '''coupling''' is the desirable or undesirable transfer of energy from one [[Transmission medium|medium]], such as a metallic wire or an [[optical fiber]], to another medium.

Coupling is also the transfer of electrical energy from one circuit segment to another.  For example, energy is transferred from a [[power supply|power source]] to an [[electrical load]] by means of [[conductive coupling]], which may be either [[resistor|resistive]] or [[wire|hard-wire]].&amp;nbsp; An AC potential may be transferred from one circuit segment to another having a DC potential by use of a [[capacitor]].&amp;nbsp; Electrical energy may be transferred from one circuit segment to another segment with different [[Characteristic impedance|impedance]] by use of a transformer.  This is known as impedance matching.  These are examples of [[capacitive coupling|electrostatic]] and [[electrodynamic induction|electrodynamic]] inductive coupling.

==Types of coupling==

Electrical conduction:
* [[wire|Hard-wire]] conduction
* [[resistor|Resistive]] conduction
* [[Wireless energy transfer#Electrical conduction|Natural conductor]]

Electromagnetic induction:
* Electrodynamic induction — Commonly called [[inductive coupling]], also magnetic coupling.
* Electrostatic induction — Commonly called [[capacitive coupling]].
* [[Evanescent wave coupling]]

Electromagnetic radiation:
* [[Radio waves]] — Wireless telecommunications.
* [[Electromagnetic interference]] (EMI) — Sometimes called radio frequency interference (RFI), is unwanted coupling. [[Electromagnetic compatibility]] (EMC) requires techniques to avoid such unwanted coupling, such as [[electromagnetic shielding]].
* [[Microwave power transmission]]

Other kinds of energy coupling:
* [[Acoustic coupler]]

'''CuproBraze''' is a [[Copper in heat exchangers|copper-alloy heat exchanger]] technology for harsh temperature and pressure environments such as those in the latest generations of cleaner [[diesel engine]]s mandated by global [[environmental regulations]].&lt;ref&gt;Vehicle radiators: Can CuproBraze turn copper into a bona fide contender?; American Metal Market September 2008; http://dl.dropbox.com/u/46572847/Perspectives-radiators.pdf{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Partanen, 2011"&gt;Partanen, Juho (2011). Hot property: Heat exchangers that optimize product reliability, decrease lifecycle costs and improve profitability are just the ticket for increasing the lifespan and performance of off-highway machinery; Industrial Vehicle Technology; March 2011; http://viewer.zmags.com/services/DownloadPDF{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The technology, developed by the International Copper Association (ICA), is licensed free of charge to heat exchanger manufacturers around the world.

Applications for CuproBraze include [[charge air cooler]]s, [[radiator]]s, [[oil cooler]]s, [[climate control]] systems, and heat transfer cores.&lt;ref name="Duensing, 2006"&gt;Duensing, Lauren (2006) Develop efficient heat-transfer systems, Modern Metals, March 2006. http://www.cuprobraze.com/pdf/inthenews_moder-metals.pdf{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Partanen, 2011" /&gt; CuproBraze is particularly suited for charge air coolers and radiators in [[capital intensive]] industries where [[machinery]] must operate for long periods of time under harsh conditions without premature failures. For these reasons, CuproBraze is being specified for [[off-road vehicle]]s, [[truck]]s, [[bus]]es, industrial [[engine]]s, [[Electric generator|generator]]s, [[locomotive]]s, and [[military equipment]]. The technology is also amenable for light trucks, [[SUV]]s and [[passenger rail car|passenger cars]] with special needs.&lt;ref name="AEI, 2005" &gt;Asia Hot on New Cooling Technology: Cooling Systems: New engine requirements mean manufacturers are changing to copper and brass for cooling systems; Automotive Engineering International, February 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Duensing, 2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CuproBraze, Brochure"&gt;CuproBraze®: Advanced heat-exchanger technology http://www.cuprobraze.com/pdf/CuproBrazeBrochure.pdf{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

CuproBraze is replacing soldered copper/brass plate fin, soldered copper brass serpentine fin, and brazed aluminium serpentine fin in demanding applications.&lt;ref name="Partanen, 2011" /&gt;

Aluminium heat exchangers are viable and economical for [[car]]s, light [[truck]]s, and other light-duty applications. However, they are not amenable for environments characterized by high operating [[temperature]]s, [[humidity]], [[vibration]], [[salt]]y [[corrosive]] [[air]], and [[air pollution]]. In these environments, the additional [[tensile strength]], durability, and [[corrosion resistance]] that CuproBraze provides are useful.&lt;ref name="Partanen, 2011" /&gt;

The CuproBraze technology uses [[brazing]] instead of [[soldering]] to join copper and brass radiator components. The heat exchangers are made with [[annealing (metallurgy)|anneal]]-resistant [[copper]] and [[brass]] alloys. The tubes are fabricated from brass strip and coated with a brazing filler material in form of a powder based paste or an [[amorphous brazing foil]] is laid between the tube and fin. There is another method of coating the tube in-line on the tube mill. This is done using the twin wire-arc spray process where the wire is the braze alloy, deposited on the tube as it is being manufactured at 200-400 fpm. This saves one process step of coating the tube later. The coated tubes, along with copper fins, headers and side supports made of brass, are fitted together into a core assembly which is brazed in a [[furnace]].&lt;ref&gt;Cuprobraze overview: {{cite web |url=http://www.cuprobraze.com/over_tech.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130215191212/http://www.cuprobraze.com/over_tech.asp |archivedate=2013-02-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The technology enables brazed serpentine fins to be used in copper-brass heat exchanger designs. They are stronger, lighter, more durable, and have tougher joints.&lt;ref name="Partanen, 2011" /&gt;

==Performance benefits==
CuproBraze radiators have important performance advantages over radiators made with other materials. These include better thermal performance, heat transfer, size, strength, durability, emissions, corrosion resistance, repairability, and antimicrobial benefits.

===Thermal performance===
The ability to withstand elevated temperatures is essential in high-heat applications. Aluminium alloys are challenged at higher temperatures due to their lower [[melting point]]s. The [[yield strength]] of aluminium is compromised above 200&amp;nbsp;°C. Problems with fatigue cracking are exacerbated at elevated temperatures.&lt;ref name="CuproBraze, Brochure" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elevated temperature operation - Meeting the high temperature challenges of new generations of charge intercoolers (design criteria series): http://www.cuprobraze.com/pdf/temperature.pdf{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;CuproBraze: Thermal performance (Technology Series): http://www.cuprobraze.com/documents/2Thermalperformance.pdf{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; CuproBraze heat exchangers are capable of operating at temperatures of 290&amp;nbsp;°C and above. Special anneal-resistant copper and brass strip ensure that radiator cores maintain their strength without softening, despite exposures to high brazing temperatures.&lt;ref name="Duensing, 2006" /&gt;

===Heat transfer efficiency===
Cooling efficiency is a measure of heat rejection from a given space by a heat exchanger.&lt;ref name="CuproBraze, Efficiency"&gt;CuproBraze Efficiency (Design Criteria Series): http://www.cuprobraze.com/pdf/Efficiency.pdf{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The overall [[thermal efficiency]] of a heat exchanger core depends on many factors, such as [[thermal conductivity]] of fins and tubes; strength and weight of the fins and tubes; spacing, size, thickness and shape of fins and tubes; [[velocity]] of the air passing through the core; and other factors.&lt;ref name="CuproBraze, Brochure" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CuproBraze, Efficiency" /&gt;

The main performance criterion for heat exchangers is cooling efficiency. Heat exchanger cores made from copper and brass can reject more heat per unit volume than any other material. This is why copper-brass heat exchangers generally have a greater cooling efficiency than alternate materials. Brazed copper-brass heat exchangers are also more rugged than soldered copper-brass and alternate materials, including brazed aluminium serpentine.&lt;ref name="Partanen, 2011" /&gt;

Air pressure drop is a good evaluator of heat exchanger design. A heat exchanger core with a smaller air pressure drop from the front to the back of the core (i.e. from the windward to the leeward side in a wind tunnel test) is more efficient. Air pressure drops typically are 24% less for CuproBraze versus aluminium heat exchangers. This advantage, responsible for a 6% increase in heat rejection, contributes to CuproBraze’s overall greater efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;CuproBraze: Size - When the advantage in efficiency is equivalent to a smaller-sized core (design criteria series): http://www.cuprobraze.com/pdf/Size.pdf{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CuproBraze, Efficient, durable, sustainable"&gt;CuproBraze®: Efficient, durable, sustainable, CuproBraze heat exchanger (brochure): http://www.cuprobraze.com/documents/EfficientdurablesustainableCuproBrazeheatexchanger.pdf{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since copper’s thermal conductivity is higher than aluminium’s, copper has a higher capacity to dissipate heat. By using thinner material gauges in combination with higher fin density, heat dissipation capacity with CuproBraze can be increased with air pressure drops still at reasonable levels.&lt;ref name="AEI, 2005" /&gt;

===Size===
Due to its high heat transfer efficiency, CuproBraze offers a significant amount of cooling capacity in a small size. This is because the same heat rejection level can be achieved with a smaller-sized core. Hence, a significant reduction in frontal area and volume is achievable with CuproBraze versus other materials.&lt;ref name="Duensing, 2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name=" CuproBraze, Brochure" /&gt;

===Strength and durability===
Three new alloys were developed to enhance the strength and durability of CuproBraze heat exchangers: 1) an [[annealing (metallurgy)|anneal]]-resistant fin material that maintains its strength after brazing; 2) an anneal-resistant tube alloy that retains its fine grain structure after brazing and provides ductility and fatigue strength in the brazed heat exchanger core; and 3) the brazing alloy.&lt;ref name="CuproBraze, Durability and reliability"&gt;CuproBraze: Durability and reliability (Technology Series); http://www.cuprobraze.com/documents/3Durabilityandreliability.pdf{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Brazing at 650&amp;nbsp;°C creates a joint that is stronger than a soldered joint and comparable in strength to a welded joint.&lt;ref&gt;Jean M. Hoffman, Runnin' light and cool, Machine-Design.com; March 3, 2005, http://machinedesign.com/article/runnin-light-and-cool-0303&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike welding, brazing does not melt the base metals. Therefore, brazing is more amenable to joining dissimilar alloys.&lt;ref name="Duensing, 2006" /&gt;

CuproBraze has more strength at elevated temperatures than soldered copper-brass or aluminium. Due to the lower [[thermal expansion]] of copper versus aluminium, there is less [[thermal stress]] during the manufacturing of CuproBraze and in its use as a heat exchanger. CuproBraze heat exchangers have stronger tube-to-header joints than other materials. These braze joints are the most critical in heat exchangers and must be leak-free. CuproBraze also has higher tolerances to internal pressures because its thin-gauge high strength materials provide stronger support for the tubes. The material is also less sensitive to bad coolants than aluminium heat exchangers.&lt;ref&gt;Finnradiator; http://www.finnradiator.com/solutions-and-technology/the-right-solution-for-you/advantages-of-the-cuprobraze-technology/excellent-durability-even-in-the-most-demanding-conditions/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CuproBraze, Durability and reliability" /&gt;

Test results demonstrate a much longer fatigue life for CuproBraze joints compared to similar soldered copper-brass or brazed aluminium joints.&lt;ref name="CuproBraze, Durability"&gt;CuproBraze Durability (design criteria series): http://www.cuprobraze.com/pdf/Durability.pdf{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stronger joints allow for the use of thinner fins and new radiator and cooler designs.&lt;ref&gt;Coming Toward CuproBraze: Brazed copper brass technology beginning to flourish across a growing range of heat transfer applications, Nigel Cotton, Diesel Progress, North American Edition, Diesel &amp; Gas Turbine Publications, August 2008; Diesel Progress, August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CuproBraze, Brochure" /&gt;

The copper fins are not easily bent when dirty radiators are washed with high pressure water. Anticorrosive coatings further improve strength and resistance against humidity, sand erosion, and stone impingement on copper fins.

===Emissions===
New legislation in [[Europe]], [[Japan]] and the [[United States|U.S.]] call for strong reductions in NO&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt; and [[particulate emissions]] from [[diesel engines]] used in [[truck]]s, [[bus]]es, [[power plant]]s, and other heavy equipment.&lt;ref name="Svensson, 2006"&gt;Bo Svensson, 2006. Cool technology to help meet emissions targets: Diesel Progress International Edition; July–August 2006, http://www.cuprobraze.com/pdf/inthenews_diesel.pdf{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; These goals can in part be accomplished by using cleaner-performing [[turbocharge]]d diesel engines and [[charge air cooler]]s. Turbocharging enables better power outputs. Charge air coolers allow power to be produced with more efficiency by reducing the temperature of the air charge entering the engine, thereby increasing its density.&lt;ref&gt;Heat exchangers: Meeting the challenges of the future: Trucks and buses; CuproBrazeAlliance; http://www.cuprobraze.com/pdf/trucks.pdf{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The charge air cooler, located between the turbocharger and the engine air inlet manifold, is an air-to-air heat exchanger.&lt;ref name="Duensing, 2006" /&gt; It reduces the inlet air temperatures of turbocharged diesel engines from 200&amp;nbsp;°C to 45&amp;nbsp;°C while increasing inlet air densities to increase engine efficiencies. Even higher inlet temperatures (246&amp;nbsp;°C or higher) and boost pressures may be necessary to comply with the emissions standards in the future.&lt;ref name="Svensson, 2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CuproBraze, Efficient, durable, sustainable" /&gt;

Present-day charge air cooler systems, based on aluminium alloys, experience durability problems at temperatures and pressures necessary to meet the U.S. Tier 4i standards for stationary and mobile engines.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Brazed Copper-Brass Technology Flourishes in Diverse Applications; Automotive Exports; September 2009; Page 26-30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Partanen, 2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AEI, 2005" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nonroad diesel engines; Emission control for stationary and mobile engines; DieselNet; http://www.dieselnet.com/standards/us/nonroad.php&lt;/ref&gt; Published reports estimate that the average life of an aluminium charge air cooler is currently only about 3,500 hours.&lt;ref&gt;Heat Exchangers: Meeting the challenges of the future; Market Update Series; CuproBraze Alliance; 2004; http://www.cuprobraze.com/pdf/engine.pdf{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aluminium is near its upper technological limit to accommodate higher temperatures and thermal stress levels&lt;ref name="Svensson, 2006" /&gt; because the tensile strength of the metal declines rapidly at 150&amp;nbsp;°C and repetitive thermal cycling between 150&amp;nbsp;°C and 200&amp;nbsp;°C substantially weakens it. Thermal cycling creates weak spots in aluminium tubes, which in turn causes charge air coolers to fail prematurely. A potential option is to install stainless steel precoolers in aluminium charge air coolers, but limited space and the complexity of this solution is a hampering factor for this option.&lt;ref name="CuproBraze, Efficient, durable, sustainable" /&gt;

A CuproBraze charge air cooler can operate at temperatures as high as 290&amp;nbsp;°C without creep, fatigue, or other metallurgical problems.&lt;ref name="CuproBraze, Efficient, durable, sustainable" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;CuproBraze: Emissions standard (Technology Series); http://www.cuprobraze.com/documents/1Emissionstandards.pdf{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Corrosion resistance===
Exterior corrosion resistance in a heat exchanger is especially important in [[coastal]] areas, [[humid]] areas, [[pollute]]d areas, and in [[mining]] operations. Corrosion mechanisms of copper and aluminium alloys are different. CuproBraze tube contains 85% copper which provides high resistance against [[dezincification]] and [[stress corrosion cracking]]. The copper alloys tend to corrode uniformly over entire surfaces at known rates. This predictability of copper corrosion is important for proper maintenance management.&lt;ref name="Partanen, 2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CuproBraze, FAQ"&gt;FAQs about CuproBraze; {{cite web |url=http://www.cuprobraze.com/FAQ.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130215191630/http://www.cuprobraze.com/FAQ.asp |archivedate=2013-02-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aluminium, on the other hand, is more likely to corrode locally by pitting, resulting eventually in holes.&lt;ref name="CuproBraze, FAQ" /&gt;

In accelerated corrosion tests, such as SWAAT for salt spray and marine conditions, CuproBraze performed better than aluminium.&lt;ref name="Partanen, 2011"/&gt;

The corrosion resistance of CuproBraze is generally better than soft [[solder]]ed heat exchangers. This is because the materials in CuproBraze heat exchangers are of equal nobility, so galvanic differences are minimized. On soft soldered heat exchangers, the solder is less noble than fin and tube materials and can suffer from [[galvanic attack]] in corrosive environments.&lt;ref name="CuproBraze, FAQ" /&gt;

===Repairability===
CuproBraze can be easily repaired. This advantage of the technology is especially important in remote areas where spare parts may be limited. CuproBraze can be repaired with lead-free soft solder (for example 97% [[tin]], 3% [[copper]]) or with common [[silver]]-containing brazing alloys.

===Antimicrobial===
[[Biofouling]] is often a problem in [[HVAC]] systems that operate in warm, dark, and humid environments. The [[antimicrobial]] properties of CuproBraze alloys eliminate foul odors, thereby improving indoor air quality. CuproBraze is being investigated in mobile air conditioner units as a solution to bad odors from fungus and bacteria in aluminium-based heat exchange systems.&lt;ref&gt;Brazed copper-brass reduces odors from mobile air conditioners, Automotive Engineering International Online, 05-Dec-2008; http://www.sae.org/mags/aei/5442&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Back to the future with copper brazing; Machine Design.com; December 11, 2008; http://machinedesign.com/article/back-to-the-future-with-copper-brazing-1211&lt;/ref&gt;

==OEMs and end users==
Russian [[OEM]]s, such as [[Kamaz]] and [[Ural Automotive Plant]], are using CuproBraze radiators and charge air coolers in heavy-duty trucks for off-highway and on-highway applications. Other manufacturers include UAZ and GAZ ([[Russia]]) and MAZ ([[Belarus]]). The Finnish Radiator Manufacturing Company, also known as FinnRadiator,&lt;ref&gt;FinnRadiator; http://www.finnradiator.com&lt;/ref&gt; produces 95% of its radiators and charge air-coolers with CuproBraze for OEM manufacturers of off-road construction equipment. Nakamura Jico Co., Ltd. ([[Japan]]) manufactures CuproBraze heat exchangers for construction equipment, locomotives and on-highway trucks.

}}ENERPOS (which stands for '''Pos'''itive '''Ener'''gy in French) is the first educational [[Zero-energy building|net-zero energy building]] in the tropics and one of the 13 Net ZEBs in the tropics thanks to its bioclimatic design. ENERPOS is located on [[Réunion|Reunion Island]], a French territory in the Indian Ocean. Building an energy efficient building in such a climate is particularly challenging. However, the energy expectations with regard to ENERPOS have been reached, even largely exceeded. 
ENERPOS is not only an energy-efficient building, but also displays various passive methods to reduce energy consumption while providing a comfortable environment for its users. Classes are hosted for both undergraduate diploma and degree courses as well as for the Department of Construction and Energy at the Graduate Engineering School of Reunion Island.

==Location==
ENERPOS is a university building located in Saint Pierre on the French island of La Reunion.
This island, whose climate is hot and humid, is located in the Indian Ocean, to the east of Madagascar. This area is also often struck by tropical cyclones, generating building difficulties.

==Context of Reunion Island==
Over 800,000 inhabitants of Reunion Island rely on a limited supply of energy. In addition to that, electricity production on Reunion Island is one of the most polluting on earth, mainly generated from fossil fuels such as coal and fuel. The electricity produced is expensive and is one of the most polluting in the world with 820 gCO2/kWhel (close to eight times more than in mainland France). Unfortunately, the ever-increasing demand for energy, due to a significant demographic growth, sometimes exceeds the amount of energy available. As a consequence, shortages can occur certain times during austral summers when air conditioning is widely used.

As is the case in other parts of the world, the electricity consumption of buildings represents a significant percentage of the energy used on Reunion Island. Buildings in French Tropical zones, and especially on Reunion Island, have often been awkwardly designed, contrary to former Creole vernacular architecture, importing metropolitan building concepts. Indeed, it has been common practice to build as cheaply as possible for decades, without any consideration for the environment and the climate, making it uncomfortable to live in without air conditioning. Moreover, air conditioning and lighting are usually oversized by designers, this leads to wasteful energy consumption.
The good news is that considerable improvements can be made in reducing energy consumption in the field of building in Reunion island.

==Goal and achievements==
In accordance with the general context of energy supply and consumption on Reunion Island, this building was expected to be net zero energy and to export at least as much energy as its consumption to the polluting electricity grid of the island. To achieve this goal, the first issue to be addressed is the energy consumption of the building and how to build without using air conditioning, a considerable consumer, while providing a comfortable environment for the users. Air conditioning is only used in one third of the total surface area for computers and servers, the remaining two-thirds are cooled and ventilated naturally. Passive methods are used, requiring people to be active instead of being passive in an active building '''(François Garde, Ph.D., P.E. and ASHRAE member)'''. At the beginning of the design of ENERPOS in 2005, the main aim was to demonstrate that the overall consumption of the building could be reduced by three times compared to that of a standard building. The result is that only one-seventh of the annual energy consumption of a standard building is used (14kWh/m² instead of 100kWh/m² in a year). To compensate for this, photovoltaic panels are implemented over the rooftops, enabling a production of 71,118kWh in 2010 compared to an overall consumption of 9,824kWh, making this building one of the 13 Net ZEBs in a tropical climate. The city of Saint Pierre is usually sunny all year and receives a heavy amount of solar radiation with up to 1,200W/m² in summer. Consequently, the building consumes 7 times less energy than its production, the extra production of electricity being released into the grid.

ENERPOS meets the requirements of the following two performance labels, HQE and PERENE. PERENE is a local label in Reunion Island guiding those wishing to abide by it on how to build in harmony with the corresponding climate (four different classifications are defined depending mainly on the altitude), Saint Pierre being in the hottest zone of the island.

==Principles and features==

===Natural cross ventilation===
Human comfort depends on five criteria, two of which concern one’s clothing and metabolism, and three others which focus on air temperature, air humidity and airflow speed. The faster the airflow is on someone the cooler he feels. Moreover, natural ventilation brings sound fresh air into the building when well-designed. Thus, natural ventilation tends to increase comfort as well as health in tropical climates and aims to suppress air conditioning.

The building has been orientated in order to prevent strong East-South-East trade winds from entering the rooms in winter and still benefit from thermal breezes in summer. The main façades are then orientated North and South, reducing the heat gain on the Western and Southern façades (which are more exposed to solar radiation) at the same time.

Successful ventilation has been obtained by creating a window to wall ratio of 30% using louvres on both opposite sides of the rooms. Louvres are not only useful to regulate the airflow, but also to protect against cyclones and break-ins. In addition to that, the surroundings of the building have been well-thought out to prevent the ground from heating before entering the rooms:
[[File:Ceiling fan used in ENERPOS.jpg|thumb|Figure 1 : Ceiling fan used in ENERPOS]]
-	Planting native plants and trees in the patio and around the building to create a microclimate which is as fresh as possible.

-	Placing car parks under the building instead of next to it for the same reason. Furthermore, it increases soil permeability so that tropical rains do not cause floods but penetrate the ground.

Finally, large ceiling fans are installed in every room, even those using air conditioning. Ceiling fans ensure that even in the absence of the necessary breezes, the airflow needed to feel comfortable in the room is provided for the users. This solution significantly reduces the amount of energy consumed. The overall consumption of the ceiling fans and the split system (the latter used to cool the technical rooms) is only 3.7kWh/m².yr compared to a classic air conditioning system in a standard building consuming 80kWh/m².yr.

===Solar shading===

[[File:Shades-enerpos.JPG|thumb|Figure 2: Shadow on the facade (Due to Solar shading)]]
Now that the airflow parameter has been dealt with, the next issue to be addressed is air temperature. Most of the heat gained in the rooms is due to solar radiation coming through the glazing.

Barely no glazing has been placed on the Western and Eastern small façades because they are the most likely to receive solar radiation. The two main façades, including the louvres, are protected against direct sunrays thanks to vertical solar shading composed of inclined wooden strips. In order to be as efficient as possible, solar shading has been simulated with a 3-D software. This glazing protection has two main effects:

-	To prevent glare on the desks, which can be very annoying for the students and the employees working in ENERPOS.

-	To decrease indoor temperature.

===Materials===
With regard to the envelope, the walls are made of concrete; the roofing is insulated with a 10&amp;nbsp;cm-layer of polystyrene and a ventilated BIPV (Building Integrated Photovoltaic) over-roof; the solar shading systems are made of wooden strips; the east and west gables are insulated with mineral wood and a wooden cladding. The paint used is completely organic and the wooden components have not undergone any specific treatment. No insulation is required on the main facades as they are very efficient in terms of S-value due to the solar shading.

===Lighting===

Day lighting has also been simulated to ensure a Useful Daylight Index (UDI) of at least 90% in most places. Two classrooms facing the sea on the first floor of the building do not have any artificial lighting. With the exception of those two classrooms, all classrooms and offices are lit by low energy consumption lights producing an artificial lighting density inferior to that of a standard building, 7W/m² in the classrooms with low energy T-5 lights and 3.7W/m² in the offices with personal LED desks lamps. These lighting densities are high enough to make these workplaces comfortable to work in and yet reduce both the energy consumption and the thermal heat gain produced by the lights in so far as is possible.
There are multiple switches to control the lights and ceiling fans by the rows of tables in the classrooms since some people could feel hot or do not have enough light while others are comfortable. This avoids wasting electricity.

A Building Management System is used to control the active systems. In the event of people forgetting to turn off the light when leaving a room, a timer will turn off lights automatically after two hours.

===Computing===
This is similar to the lighting issue as computing systems can affect both energy consumption and thermal heat gain greatly. 
The main solution adopted in the offices is to use laptops rather than desktop computers since they usually consume less electricity.
As for the computer rooms, they are only equipped with screens, mice and keyboards and all central units are located in the air-conditioned technical room. The thermal loads from the computers are thus kept outside the computing rooms.

===Photovoltaic production===

[[File:Photopanel-enerpos.png|thumb|Figure 3 : Photovoltaic panels on the roof]]
As previously explained is, the city of Saint Pierre receives a huge amount of solar radiation throughout the year. This natural source of energy has consequently been exploited. The target being to make ENERPOS a positive energy building thanks to solar panels, the PV production must be at least equal to the energy consumption of the building.

In fact, since the photovoltaic panels have been used as an over-roof, the overall surface of the panels has been oversized compared to the energy needs in order to protect the whole roof from direct sunrays. The low energy consumption of ENERPOS is more than balanced by 365m² of these integrated solar panels, generating a total production of 71,118kWh over one year. The resulting surplus of energy, not being consumed by the building but released into the grid instead, is then up to 61kWh in a year.

Furthermore, all of the costs and risks of this installation are provided by the manufacturer, as agreed in the contract, and not by the owner of ENERPOS (that is to say the University of Reunion Island). In exchange, the University of Reunion Island rents the photovoltaic production to the manufacturer who receives the benefit of the electricity fed into the grid for 15 years. After that period, the owner of the building becomes the owner of the PV panels.

==Making the users active==
The energy consumption of a building not only relies on the way it has been built, but also mainly on the occupant behaviour. This idea is all the more true for buildings being constructed based on passive designs. Indeed, making ENERPOS a passive building implies that people need to be active to use it to its full capacity. 
For example, before turning on the ceiling fans of a classroom, the students have to open the louvres first. It seems to be common sense but as a matter of fact, people do not think about that most of the time. That is why signs are displayed in the rooms explaining how to use a classroom properly to avoid wasting energy. The purpose is to educate students (and teachers) about the way to behave and to make them realize the environmental issues at stake on Reunion Island.

==Post occupancy evaluation==
Since ENERPOS is a pioneer project on Reunion Island and in the tropics, it is essential to analyze the consumption distribution, the performance and how people feel in this building. Therefore, a post occupancy evaluation has been carried out for three hot seasons to assess the comfort level in ENERPOS. Students and teachers were asked to fill in a questionnaire about how they feel in the building while environmental parameters, such as temperatures, humidity and air velocity, were collected. 
The main conclusion is that out of 700 students surveyed, the vast majority feel comfortable in ENERPOS in the hot season without any air conditioning. The ultimate objective of this project has then been met.

==Results==
Among the annual 14.4kWh/m² consumption of ENERPOS, the energy end uses are as follows:

-	Plug loads 46%

-	Air conditioning and mechanical ventilation 15%

-	Interior lighting 14%

-	Ceiling fans 11%

-	Exterior lighting 7%

-	Elevator 7%

The contribution of the plug loads to the overall energy consumption is abnormally high compared to a standard building because the air conditioning and lighting parts have been well reduced.

To conclude, the ENERPOS building shows that it is possible to build an educational Net ZEB in the tropics while providing a comfortable environment for people to work and study in. Moreover, the lessons learnt about the ENERPOS project can be applied to green building and Net ZEB projects in hot climates.

The '''Electronic Commerce (EC Directive) Regulations 2002''', [[Statutory Instrument|SI]] 2002/2013, incorporates the EU [[Electronic Commerce Directive]] 2000/31/EC into the [[law]] of the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name="euro"&gt;[[Enactment of a bill|Enacted]] pursuant to [[European Communities Act 1972 (UK)|European Communities Act 1972]]&lt;/ref&gt; They apply to [[contracts]] concluded by electronic means over distance whereby the buyer is a consumer. This [[subordinate legislation]] provides for rights of the consumer and provisions for which the seller is obliged to fulfill.

==Definition of a consumer==
A Consumer is a "natural person who is acting for the purposes other than those of his trade, business or profession."&lt;ref name="reg21"&gt;reg 2(1).&lt;/ref&gt; The definition is slightly broader than that for the purposes of the [[Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977]] as the subjective requirement of ''the person not regarding themselves as acting in the course of a business'', therefore one may be a consumer if using a company account or using business details for [[tax]] purposes.

==Obligations imposed upon the seller==
'''Before the contract is formed''', the seller must state in a "clear comprehensible and unambiguous manner" the technical step involved to place an order (contractual [[Offer and Acceptance|offer]]).&lt;ref name="reg91"&gt;reg 9(1)(a).&lt;/ref&gt; Terms and conditions under which the contract is concluded must be made available to the consumer in a means capable of reproduction and storage.&lt;ref name="reg93"&gt;reg 9(3).&lt;/ref&gt; This does not apply to [[email]], although the [[Consumer Protection (Distance Selling) Regulations 2000]] may apply.

These rights can be expressly exempted,&lt;ref name="reg91-2"&gt;reg 9(1).&lt;/ref&gt; although these regulations applied to the exemption clause, as did the [[Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977]] and the [[Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999]].

'''Information that must be provided to the consumer'''.
* Acknowledgement of the order by electronic means without undue delay,&lt;ref name="reg111a"&gt;reg 11(1)(a).&lt;/ref&gt; and information of how to amend any input errors made.&lt;ref name="reg111b"&gt;reg 11(1)(b).&lt;/ref&gt;

More information must be given under the [[Consumer Protection (Distance Selling) Regulations 2000]].

==Rights of the consumer==
Liability of breach of these conditions gives rise to an action for [[Breach of statutory duty]].&lt;ref name="reg13"&gt;reg 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

A court order may be given for access to terms and conditions of which the ''consumer'' has already consented.

Where the ''consumer'' has not been informed in the correct manner of the procedure to amend errors in orders and they have made errors, the [[contract]] can be [[Rescission (contract law)|rescinded]].&lt;ref name="reg15"&gt;reg 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contractual construction==
reg 12 provides that a [[Offer and Acceptance|contractual offer]] occurs when the order is sent. Richards&lt;ref name="richards"&gt;Richards, P, ''The Law of Contract'', ed7 (2006, London: Pearsons) at 42&lt;/ref&gt; construes reg 11(2) as providing that the acknowledgement screen will constitute a [[Offer and Acceptance|contractual acceptance]].

''Instantaneous Communication'' here is in line with that discussed by Lord [[Alfred Denning, Baron Denning|Denning]] in ''[[Entores Ltd v Miles Far East Corporation]]''&lt;ref name="entore"&gt;[1955] 2 QB 327.&lt;/ref&gt; and so communication is effect when received or when it can reasonably be deemed to have been received.

An '''event data recorder''' or '''EDR''', sometimes referred to informally as an automotive "black box" (by analogy with the common nickname for [[flight recorder]]s), is a device installed in some [[automobile]]s to record information related to vehicle crashes or [[car accident|accidents]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=What is an Automobile Black Box|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/accidents/auto_black_boxes.html|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=18 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the USA EDRs must meet federal standards, as described within the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations.&lt;ref name="CFREDR"&gt;{{cite web|title=49 CFR 563.7|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2010-title49-vol6/pdf/CFR-2010-title49-vol6-sec563-7.pdf|website=U.S. Government Printing Office|accessdate=18 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern diesel [[truck]]s, EDRs are triggered by electronically sensed problems in the engine (often called faults), or a sudden change in wheel speed.  One or more of these conditions may occur because of an accident.  Information from these devices can be collected after a crash and analyzed to help determine what the vehicles were doing before, during and after the crash or event.  The term generally refers to a simple, tamper-proof, [[read-write memory]] device. 

==Operation==
Some EDRs continuously record data, overwriting the previous few minutes until a crash stops them, and others are activated by crash-like events (such as sudden changes in velocity) and may continue to record until the accident is over, or until the recording time is expired. EDRs may record a wide range of data elements, potentially including whether the [[brake]]s were applied, the speed at the time of impact, the steering angle, and whether [[seat belt]] circuits were shown as "Buckled" or "Unbuckled" at the time of the crash.  Current EDRs store the information internally on an [[EEPROM]] until recovered from the module.  Some vehicles have communications systems (such as [[General Motors|GM]]'s [[OnStar]] system) that may transmit some data, such as an alert that the airbags have been deployed, to a remote location.

Most EDRs in automobiles and light trucks are part of the restraint system control module, which senses impact accelerations and determines what restraints (airbags and/or seatbelt tensioners) to deploy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hench|first1=David|title=‘Black boxes’ in cars capture data, and the truth|url=http://www.pressherald.com/2015/03/02/black-boxes-in-cars-capture-data-and-the-truth/|accessdate=18 June 2017|agency=Portland Press Herald|date=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the deployment (or non-deployment) decisions are made, and if there is still power available, the data are written to memory. The data downloaded from older EDRs usually contain 6 to 8 pages of information, though many newer systems include many more data elements and require more pages, depending on the make/model/year of the vehicle being evaluated.  Depending on the type of EDR, it may contain either a deployment file or a non-deployment file or sometimes both, depending on the circumstances of the collisions and the time interval between them, among other things. 

It is also possible that no data can be recovered from a data recorder. One situation where this might occur is a catastrophic loss of electrical power early in a collision event. In this situation, the power reserve in the restraint system control module capacitors may be completely spent by the deployment of the air bags, leaving insufficient power to write data to the EEPROM.  There are other circumstances where a module may fail to record a data file as well.

Most EDRs in heavy trucks are part of the engine electronic control module (ECM),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Andrews|first1=Dennis F.|last2=Limpert|first2=Rudy|title=Electronic Control Module Data in Large Truck Collision Analysis|url=http://www.pcbrakeinc.com/epub/PCB%201-2013f.pdf|website=PC Brake|accessdate=19 June 2017|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which controls fuel injection timing and other functions in modern heavy-duty diesel engines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bosch|first1=Robert|title=Diesel Fuel Injection|date=1997|publisher=Bosch Technical Instruction|isbn=1-56091-542-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The EDR functions are different for different engine manufacturers, but most recognize engine events such as sudden stops, low oil pressure, or coolant loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Menig|first1=Paul|last2=Coverdill|first2=Cary|title=Transportation Recorders on Commercial Vehicles|url=http://www.nhtsa.gov/DOT/NHTSA/NRD/Articles/EDR/PDF/Research/Transportation_Recorders_on_Commercial_Vehicles.pdf|publisher=Freightliner Corporation|accessdate=19 June 2017|date=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Detroit Diesel]], [[Caterpillar Inc.]], [[Mercedes-Benz]], [[Mack Trucks]], and [[Cummins]] engines are among those that may contain this function.  When a fault-related event occurs, the data is written to memory.  When an event triggered by a reduction in wheel speed is sensed, the data that is written to memory can include almost two minutes of data about vehicle speed, brake application, clutch application, and cruise control status. The data can be downloaded later using the computer software and cables for the specific engine involved.  These software tools often allow monitoring of the driver [[hours of service]], fuel economy, idle time, average travel speeds, and other information related to the maintenance and operation of the vehicle.

Some EDRs only keep track of the car's speed along its length and not the speed going sideways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Askland|first1=Andrew|title=The Double Edged Sword  that is the Event Data  Recorder|journal=Temple Journal of Science, Technology and Environmental Law|date=Spring 2006|volume=XXV|issue=1|pages=1-14|url=http://www.temple.edu/law/tjstel/2006/spring/v25no1-Askland.pdf|accessdate=18 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analysts generally look at the momentum, energy, and crush damage, and then compare their speed estimates to the number coming out of the EDR to create a complete view of the accident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=2010-02-24 |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2140188/ |last1=Engber|first1=Daniel|title=The Ferrari That Split in Half |work=Slate.com |date=2006-04-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many different [[patent]]s related to various types of EDR features.

==Data from the Eaton VORAD Collision Warning System==
The Eaton Vehicle Onboard Radar (VORAD) Collision Warning System is used by many commercial trucking firms to aid drivers and improve safety.  The system includes forward and side radar sensors to detect the presence, proximity and movements of vehicles around the truck and then alert the truck driver. When sensors determine that the truck is closing on a vehicle ahead too quickly or that a nearby vehicle is potentially hazardous, the VORAD system gives the driver both a visual and audible warning. The VORAD system also monitors various parameters of the truck including vehicle speed and turn rate plus the status of vehicle systems and controls. 
The monitored data is captured and recorded by the VORAD system. This monitored data can be extracted and analyzed in the event of an accident. The recorded data can be used by accident investigators and forensic engineers to show the movement and speed of the host vehicle plus the position and speeds of other vehicles prior to the incident.  In accident reconstruction, the VORAD system is a step above the EDR systems in that VORAD monitors other vehicles relative to the host vehicle, while EDR’s only record data about the host vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=2012-07-05 |url=http://www.veritecheng.com/eaton-vorad-collision-warning-system/ |title=Operation of the Eaton VORAD Collision Warning System and Analysis of the Recorded Data |work=David Danaher, P.E., Jeff Ball, Ph.D., P.E., Trevor Buss, P.E., and Mark Kittel, P.E |date=2012-06-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage of event data recorders ==

Event data recorders were introduced to American open-wheel championship [[Championship Auto Racing Teams|CART]] in the [[1993 IndyCar season|1993 season]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Indy race cars are equipped with Crash Data Recorders to improve safety|url=http://www.nhtsa.gov/DOT/NHTSA/NRD/Articles/EDR/PDF/Research/Indy_race_cars_are_equipped_with_CRASH_DATA_RECORDERS-safety.pdf|website=NHTSA|publisher=Instrumented Sensor Technology, Inc.|accessdate=19 June 2017|date=7 August 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Formula One]] World Championship in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.sae.org/2000-01-3551/ The Analysis of Accident Data Recorder (ADR) Data in Formula 1] - Peter G. Wright, SAE Technical Paper, 13 November 2000&lt;/ref&gt; This allowed to study crashes that allow to develop new car rules and track safety measures that reduce damages.

Usage of the device in road vehicles once varied widely from manufacturer to manufacturer, but EDRs are now mandated in all new vehicles.&lt;ref name="CFREDR"/&gt; As of 2003, there were at least 40 million vehicles equipped with the devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |accessdate=2010-02-22 |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2003-05-15-boxes-usat_x.htm |title=Autos' black-box data turning up in courtrooms |work=USA Today |date=2003-05-15 | first1=Deborah | last1=Sharp}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK many police and emergency service vehicles are fitted with a more accurate and detailed version that is produced by one of several independent companies. Both the Metropolitan police and the City of London police are long-term users of EDRs and have used the data recovered after an incident to convict both police officers and members of the public.

== Accessing event data recorder information ==

===Methods of accessing EDR data===
[[File:Bench download.jpg|thumb|Conducting a bench download]]
[[File:SDM download via DLC.jpg|thumb|Downloading a module via the DLC]]

Downloading an airbag module in most vehicles is best accomplished by connecting the appropriate scanning tool to the Diagnostic Link Connector (DLC) usually found under the vehicle's dashboard near the driver's knees. Alternately, some modules can be downloaded "on the bench" after removal from the vehicle.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

===The Bosch CDR tool===

Over 88% of model year 2016 and newer vehicles are supported by the Bosch CDR tool, enabling the retrieval of Event Data Recorder (EDR) data from a vehicle that has been involved in a crash. This tool is made up of hardware and software which provides the ability to “image”, “download”, or “retrieve” EDR data that may be stored in the control modules of passenger cars, light trucks and SUVs. The software component is a single, standalone program designed to run in a Windows environment. The hardware part of the Tool is a collection of components including cables and adapters which, with proper training and minimal difficulty, are used to “retrieve” data from supported vehicles.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

===Subaru, Kia, and Hyundai EDR tools===

Another 11% of model year 2016 and newer vehicles are supported by other EDR tools. The limited need to cover less commonly supported vehicles may make the initial investment in software and equipment unnecessary for many in the accident reconstruction or related industries.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

==NHTSA's Event Data Recorder Ruling==
From 1998 to 2001, the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) sponsored a working group specifically tasked with the study of EDRs. After years of evaluation, NHTSA released a formal Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in 2004.  This notice declared NHTSA’s intent to standardize EDRs.  It was not until August 2006 that NHTSA released its final ruling (49 CFR Part 563). The ruling was lengthy (207 pages), consisting of not only definitions and mandatory EDR standards, but also acted as a formal reply to the dozens of petitions received by NHTSA after the 2004 notice.

Since there was already an overwhelming trend for voluntary EDR installation, the ruling did not require manufacturers to install EDRs in vehicles produced for North America. Based on its analysis, NHTSA estimated that by 2010, over 85% of vehicles would already have EDRs installed in them, but warned that if the trend did not continue, the agency would revisit their decision and possibly make installation a requirement.

The mandate did, however, provide a minimum standard for the type of data that EDRs would be required to record:  at least 15 types of crash data. Some of the required crash data include pre-crash speed, engine throttle, brake use, measured changes in forward velocity (Delta-V), driver safety belt use, airbag warning lamp status and airbag deployment times.

In addition to the required data, NHTSA also set standards for 30 other types of data if EDRs were voluntarily configured to record them. For example, if a manufacturer configured an EDR to record engine RPMs or ABS activity, then the EDR would have to record 5 seconds of those pre-crash data in half-second increments.

Besides the requirement that all data be able to survive a 30 MPH barrier crash and be measured with defined precision, NHTSA also required that all manufacturers make their EDR data publicly available.  As of October 2009, only General Motors, Ford and Daimler Chrysler had released their EDR data to be publicly read.
In the August 2006 ruling, NHTSA set a time table for all vehicle manufacturers to be in compliance with the new EDR standards. The compliance date was originally set for all vehicles manufactured after September 1, 2010.  But in 2008, NHTSA pushed the date back to September 1, 2012. In 2014, it was working on another rule update to give vehicle manufacturers until September 1, 2014, but that rule was never issued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=49 CFR 563.3 - Application.|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/49/563.3|accessdate=7 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=“Black Boxes” in Passenger Vehicles: Policy Issues|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R43651.pdf|accessdate=7 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Privacy concerns==
Despite alerts and warnings in their vehicle owner's manual, many drivers are not aware of their vehicle's recording capability. Civil liberty and privacy groups have raised concerns about the implications of data recorders 'spying' on car users, particularly as the issue of 'who owns the data' has not yet been fully resolved, and there has been some controversy over the use of recorded data as evidence in court cases and for insurance claims against the driver of a crashed vehicle. But the use of EDR data in civil and criminal court cases is on the rise as they become more accepted as a source of reliable empirical evidence in accident reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=2010-02-22 |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/MellodyHobson/car-black-box-records-key-data/story?id=9814181 |title=Is That a 'Black Box' in Your Car? |work=ABC News |date=2010-02-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fourteen states have statutes specific to EDRs. Generally, these state statutes restrict access to the EDR or limit the use of recovered EDR information.

The federal Driver Privacy Act of 2015 was enacted on December 4, 2015. It stated that the owner or lessee of a motor vehicle is the owner of the data collected by the EDR. In order to access that data, an investigator would need to (1) be authorized by a court or judicial or administrative authority, subject to the standards for admission into evidence; (2) obtain the written, electronic or recorded audio consent of the vehicle owner or lessee; (3) be conducting an investigation or inspection authorized by federal law; (4) demonstrate it is necessary to facilitate medical care in response to a car accident; aor (5) be conducting traffic safety research, so long as the personal information of the owner/lessee is not disclosed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Driver Privacy Act of 2015 Addresses Privacy Concerns for Data Collected on Event Data Recorder|url=https://www.natlawreview.com/article/driver-privacy-act-2015-addresses-privacy-concerns-data-collected-event-data|accessdate=7 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use as evidence in courts==
There have been a number of trial cases in the US and Canada involving EDRs. Drivers have been convicted and exonerated as a result of EDR evidence.

Examples include:

*In [[New South Wales]], Australia, a teen-aged female (a [[driving licence|probationary]] driver) was convicted of dangerous driving "causing death/occasioning grievous bodily harm" in 2005.  Evidence from the [[Peugeot]]'s EDR showed that the car was being driven in excess of the posted speed limit.  An injunction against the use of EDR evidence, obtained by the owner of the car (the parents of the defendant), was overturned in the [[NSW Supreme Court]].
*In [[Quebec]], Canada, the driver of a car who sped through a [[traffic lights|red light]], crashing into another car at the intersection and killing the other driver, was convicted of "dangerous driving" in 2001 after EDR information revealed that it was he, not the deceased driver of the other car (as the defendant asserted), who was speeding. There were no other witnesses to the crash.
*The first such use of EDR evidence in the [[United Kingdom]] was at [[Birmingham]] [[Crown Court]] during the trial of Antonio Boparan-Singh who crashed the [[Range Rover Sport]] he was driving into a [[Jeep]] in 2006. The accident left a baby girl paralyzed and the driver, who was aged 19 at the time of the incident, was sentenced to 21 months in prison. The EDR evidence allowed investigators to determine the driver was speeding at 72&amp;nbsp;mph in a 30&amp;nbsp;mph zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=2010-02-03 |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/how-cars-black-box-trapped-speeding-rich-list-heir-who-left-baby-paralysed-in-range-rover-crash-6615218.html |title=How car's black box trapped speeding Rich List heir who left baby paralysed in Range Rover crash  |work=London Evening Standard |date=2008-04-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although EDR evidence can be valuable in the litigation of traffic-related accidents and incidents, the primary purpose of an EDR is to improve driver safety and not to provide data for accident reconstruction, and courts should consider the limitations of EDR data in determining the cause of traffic accidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Use of Automobile Black Box Data in Court|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/accidents/auto_black_boxes2.html|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable==
===N.J. Governor Jon Corzine===
On 12 April 2007, [[Governor of New Jersey|N.J. Governor]] [[Jon Corzine]] was seriously injured in an automobile accident.  According to the superintendent of state police, an Event Data Recorder in the [[SUV]] he was traveling in recorded he was traveling at about 91 MPH five seconds before the crash.  The speed limit on the road is 65 MPH. The Governor was not the driver of the vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=2010-02-22 |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/18158503/ |title=Corzine’s SUV traveling 91 mph at time of crash |work=NBCNews.com |date=2007-04-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mass. Lt. Governor Tim Murray===
On November 2, 2011, [[Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts|Mass. Lt. Governor]] [[Tim Murray]] crashed a government-owned vehicle on a stretch of Interstate 190.&lt;ref name="boston.com"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bierman|first1=Noah|title=Murray was going 100 mph, may have been asleep before crash|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2012/01/03/gov-tim-murray-traveling-mph-time-nov-crash-fell-asleep-wheel/7GJmpkpIigVGxQd9rv06nI/story.html|accessdate=18 June 2017|agency=Boston Globe|date=3 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, police investigating did not issue any citations. 

Murray initially claimed he simply lost control on the ice, wasn’t speeding, was wearing a seat belt and braked.  But those claims were all later disproven when the Crown Victoria black box data recorder information was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cassidy|first1=Chris|title=Data wrecks Lt. Gov. Tim Murray’s tale|url=http://www.bostonherald.com/news_opinion/local_coverage/2012/01/data_wrecks_lt_gov_tim_murray%E2%80%99s_tale|accessdate=18 June 2017|agency=Boston Herald|date=4 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The data revealed the car was traveling 108 miles per hour, accelerated, and the Lt. Governor was not wearing a seat belt at the time the vehicle collided with a rock ledge and flipped over.  Murray was unhurt in the accident.&lt;ref name="boston.com"/&gt;

[[File:Falcon 9 first stage at LZ-1(two).jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|The first stage of [[Falcon 9 flight 20]] successfully landed for the first time on a ground pad at [[Landing Zone 1]], [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]], after propelling 11 [[Orbcomm]] [[Orbcomm (satellite)|OG2 satellites]] to orbit.]]

The '''[[Falcon 9]] first-stage landing tests''' were a series of controlled-descent [[flight test]]s conducted by [[SpaceX]] between 2013 and 2016. Since 2017, the first stage of Falcon 9 missions has been routinely landed if the rocket performance allowed it, and if SpaceX chose to recover the stage.&lt;!-- in the early days of routine operation, this was fairly one-dimensional: recover if rocket performance allows. By early 2018 however, with a number of Block 4 "flight-proven" boosters in stock, and an explicit decision by SpaceX to re-fly Block 3 boosters only once (two total flights), some second-flight boosters began to be expended EVEN THOUGH rocket performance would have allowed recovery.  That's a fact.  I've not found a source explaining why, so saying all of this in article prose would be speculation.  --&gt; 

The program's objective was to reliably execute controlled re-entry, descent and landing ([[EDL (rocketry)|EDL]]) of the Falcon 9 [[first stage (rocketry)|first stage]] into Earth's atmosphere after the stage completes the boost phase of an [[orbital spaceflight]]. The first tests aimed to touch down vertically in the ocean at zero velocity. Later tests attempted to land the rocket precisely on an [[autonomous spaceport drone ship]] (a barge commissioned by SpaceX to provide a stable landing surface at sea) or at [[Landing Zone 1]] (LZ-1), a concrete pad at [[CCAFS|Cape Canaveral]]. The first ground landing at LZ-1 succeeded in December 2015, and the first landing at sea on a drone ship in April 2016. The second landed booster, [[B1021]], was the first to fly again in March 2017, and was recovered a second time.

== Overview ==
The first landing test occurred in September 2013 on the [[#Flight 6|sixth flight]] of a Falcon 9 and maiden launch of the [[Falcon 9 v1.1|v1.1 rocket version]]. From 2013 to 2016, sixteen test flights were conducted, six of which achieved a soft landing and recovery of the booster:
* [[#Flight 20: first landing on ground pad|flight 20]] ([[Orbcomm OG2 M2]]) safely touching down on the [[Landing Zone 1|LZ-1]] ground pad upon first attempt in December 2015;
* [[#Flight 23: first landing on floating platform (drone ship)|flight 23]] ([[CRS-8]]) finally achieving a stable landing at sea in the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] on the drone ship ''[[Of Course I Still Love You]]'' in April 2016 after four previous attempts ended in destruction of the booster upon impact;
* flights [[#Flight 24: first return from GTO mission|24]] ([[JCSAT-14]]) and [[#Flight 25|25]] ([[Thaicom 8]]) returning at higher speed from [[geosynchronous transfer orbit|GTO]] missions at sea on a drone ship in May 2016;
* [[#Flight 27|flight 27]] ([[CRS-9]]) returning to LZ-1 in July 2016;
* [[#Flight 28|flight 28]] ([[JCSAT-16]]) landing on a drone ship in August 2016;

Since the January 2017 return to flight, SpaceX has stopped referring to landing attempts as "experimental", indicating that they have become a routine procedure (see [http://www.spacex.com/sites/spacex/files/spacex_iridium1_press_kit.pdf Iridium-1] and [http://www.spacex.com/sites/spacex/files/crs10presskitfinal.pdf CRS-10] press kits of 2017, compared with [http://www.spacex.com/sites/spacex/files/spacex_crs9_press_kit.pdf CRS-9] and [http://www.spacex.com/sites/spacex/files/spacex_jcsat16_press_kit.pdf JCSAT-16] of 2016). {{As of|2017|12|15}}, 14 routine landings&lt;!-- UPDATE after each flight --&gt; have been performed ({{percent|14|14}}&lt;!-- UPDATE after each landed flight --&gt; success) and three missions&lt;!-- UPDATE after each expended flight --&gt; were launched in [[expendable launch system|expendable]] configuration, not attempting to land.

The first-stage descent tests were part of the larger [[SpaceX reusable launch system development program]], which included a large amount of [[new product development|new technology development]] activities and earlier low-altitude test flights at the [[SpaceX McGregor|SpaceX facility]] in [[McGregor, Texas]] in preparation for the high-altitude high-velocity testing of landing test phase of the program. The overall objective of the program is to [[private spaceflight|privately develop]] [[reusable launch vehicle|reusable rockets]] using [[VTVL|vertical-landing]] technology so as to substantially reduce the cost of space access.

Traditionally, the first stages of orbital carrier rockets have been [[Expendable launch system|discarded in the ocean]] once the ascent was complete. Achieving routine recovery and reuse of the launch vehicles could dramatically reduce the cost of access to space.&lt;ref name="bbc20130930"&gt;

That means those additional launches, and thus revenue, may have to come from markets that don't exist yet. 'A reusable system with much lower launch costs might actually result in lower revenue for that company unless they can significantly increase demand,' says Foust.

== History ==

SpaceX first announced in March 2013 that it would instrument and equip subsequent Falcon 9 first stages as controlled-descent test vehicles, able to propulsively decelerate towards a soft touchdown over the water surface. The company expected to begin these flight tests in 2013, with an attempt to return the vehicle to the launch site for a powered landing no earlier than mid-2014.&lt;ref name="pa20130328-2"&gt;
{{cite news |url=http://www.parabolicarc.com/2013/03/28/dragon-post-mission-press-conference-notes/ |title=Dragon Post-Mission Press Conference Notes |work=Parabolic Arc |last=Messier |first=Doug |date=March 28, 2013 |accessdate=March 30, 2013 |quote=Q. What is strategy on first stage recover?  Musk: Initial recovery test will be a water landing. First stage continue in ballistic arc and execute a velocity reduction burn before it enters atmosphere to lessen impact. Right before splashdown, will light up the engine again. Emphasizes that we don’t expect success in the first several attempts. Hopefully next year with more experience and data, we should be able to return the first stage to the launch site and do a propulsion landing on land using legs.  Q. Is there a flight identified for return to launch site of the first stage?  Musk: No. Will probably be the middle of next year.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the event, SpaceX did perform their first controlled-descent test flight in 2013 but continued the over-water testing well into 2015. Following analysis of telemetry data from the first controlled descent in September 2013, SpaceX announced that a large amount of new technology passed their real-life test objectives, and that coupled with the technology advancements made on the [[Grasshopper (rocket)|Grasshopper]] low-altitude landing demonstrator, they were now ready to test the full EDL process to recover the first stage. The rocket was "able to successfully transition from vacuum through [[hypersonic]], through [[supersonic]], through [[transonic]], and light the engines all the way and control the stage all the way through [the atmosphere]".&lt;ref name=pm20130930&gt;

This second EDL test took place during the [[SpaceX CRS-3|third cargo resupply mission]] for NASA in April 2014. SpaceX attached [[Launch vehicle landing gear|landing legs]] to the first stage, decelerated the stage through atmospheric re-entry and attempted a simulated landing over water, following the separation of the second stage carrying the Dragon capsule to the ISS. The first stage was slowed down sufficiently to perform a soft touchdown over the Atlantic Ocean.&lt;ref name="ut20140419"&gt;

SpaceX announced in February 2014 that they intended to continue over-water tests of the first stage until mastering precision control of the vehicle from hypersonic speed all the way through subsonic regimes.&lt;ref name="dn20140224"/&gt;

[[#Landing attempts|Subsequent tests]], starting with the [[CRS-5]] mission in January 2015, attempted to land the first stage on an [[autonomous spaceport drone ship]] stationed off the Florida coastline or in the Pacific Ocean depending on launch site.&lt;ref name="nsf20141124"&gt;
{{cite web|last1=Bergin|first1=Chris|title=SpaceX’s Autonomous Spaceport Drone Ship ready for action|url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2014/11/spacex-autonomous-spaceport-drone-ship/|website=NASASpaceFlight|accessdate=April 23, 2015|date=November 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The ships were used for six landing attempts, two of which succeeded in April and May 2016. Meanwhile, the [[#Flight 20: first landing on ground pad|first attempt to land on solid ground]] at Cape Canaveral occurred on December 21, 2015, and succeeded flawlessly.

== Post-mission test plan ==
[[File:Falcon 9 Flight 13 infrared video of first stage propulsive descent.ogv|thumb|right|thumbtime=0:1:28|Thermal imaging of the controlled-descent test from stage separation onward, on [[Falcon 9 flight 13]], September 21, 2014.  Footage shows the first stage maneuvering out of the second stage plume; coasting near peak altitude of approximately {{convert|140|km|sp=us|abbr=on}}; performing a boost-back burn to limit downrange distance; controlled ballistic descent; and reentry burn from approximately {{convert|70|km|sp=us|abbr=on}} to {{convert| 40|km|sp=us|abbr=on}} altitude.  Landing burn is not visible, as clouds obscured the infrared imaging at low altitude.]]

The post-mission Falcon 9 test plan for the earliest flight tests called for the first stage to perform a retro-propulsion burn in the upper atmosphere to slow it down and put it on a descent [[External ballistics|ballistic trajectory]] to its target landing location, followed by a second burn in the lower atmosphere before the first stage reached the water.&lt;ref name="pa20130910"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.parabolicarc.com/2013/09/10/spacex-launch-license/ |title=A Preview of Falcon 9′s Flight From Vandenberg |work=Parabolic Arc |last=Messier |first=Doug |date=September 10, 2013 |accessdate=September 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; SpaceX announced in March 2013 that it intended to conduct such tests on Falcon 9 v1.1 launch vehicles and would "continue doing such tests until they can do a return to the launch site and a powered landing". The company said it expected several failures before it could land the vehicle successfully.&lt;ref name=dn20140224/&gt;&lt;ref name=nsf20140228&gt;{{cite news |last=Bergin |first=Chris |title=SpaceX outlines CRS-3 landing legs plan toward first stage recovery ambitions |url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2014/02/spacex-crs-3-landing-legs-plan-first-stage-recovery-ambitions/ |accessdate=May 10, 2014 |newspaper=NASAspaceflight.com |date=February 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In detailed information disclosed in the Falcon 9 flight 6 [[launch license]] for the [[CASSIOPE]] mission, SpaceX said it would fire three of the nine [[Merlin 1D]] engines initially to slow the horizontal velocity of the rocket and begin the attempt at a controlled descent.&lt;ref name="pa20130910"/&gt; Then, shortly before hitting the ocean, one engine would be relighted in an attempt to reduce the stage's speed so that it could be recovered. {{As of|2013|9}}, SpaceX said the experiment had approximately a ten percent chance of success.&lt;ref name="sn20130906"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.spacenews.com/article/launch-report/37094musk-says-spacex-being-%E2%80%9Cextremely-paranoid%E2%80%9D-as-it-readies-for-falcon-9%E2%80%99s |title=Musk Says SpaceX Being "Extremely Paranoid" as It Readies for Falcon 9's California Debut |work=Space News |last=Klotz |first=Irene |date=September 6, 2013 |accessdate=September 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SpaceX did not perform controlled-descent tests on all Falcon 9 v1.1 flights, as payloads going to [[geostationary transfer orbit|GTO]] did not leave enough fuel margin.&lt;ref name=sn20131127&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.spacenews.com/article/launch-report/38374why-the-world%E2%80%99s-2nd-largest-satellite-fleet-operator-agreed-to-be-spacex |title=Why the World's 2nd Largest Satellite Fleet Operator Agreed To Be SpaceX's 1st Customer for a Launch to Geo |work=Space News |last=de Selding |first=Peter B. |date=November 27, 2013 |accessdate=November 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In September 2013, SpaceX announced that the [[SpaceX CRS-3|CRS-3]] mission of April 2014 (fourth flight of Falcon 9 v1.1)&lt;ref name=gizmag20140418&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://www.gizmag.com/crs-3-launch-spacex/31671/ |title=Fourth time lucky for SpaceX's CRS-3 Dragon launch |work=Gizmag |first=David |last=Szondy |date=April 18, 2014 |accessdate=November 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; would be the second test of the descent test profile.&lt;ref name="bbc20130930" /&gt;

Whereas the early tests restarted the engines only twice, by the fourth flight test, in September 2014, SpaceX was reigniting the engines three times to accomplish its EDL test objectives (although only three of the nine engines were used): a boost-back burn, a reentry burn, and a landing burn.  The boost-back burn limits [[downrange]] translation of the used stage; the reentry burn (from approximately {{convert|70|to|40|km|sp=us|abbr=on}} altitude) is used to control the descent and deceleration profile at [[atmospheric interface]]; and the landing burn completes the deceleration from [[terminal velocity]] to zero at the landing surface.&lt;ref name=nasa20141017/&gt;&lt;ref name=aw20141016/&gt;

== Test flights ==

=== Ocean touchdown attempts ===

==== Flight 6 ====
The first [[EDL (rocketry)|propulsive reentry, descent, and ocean-surface touchdown]] test occurred on September 29, 2013, on [[Falcon 9 flight 6]], the maiden launch of the [[Falcon 9 v1.1|Falcon 9 rocket, version v1.1]]. After the three-minute boost phase and separation of the second stage with the [[CASSIOPE]] and [[nanosat]] payloads, the rocket's first stage was [[Attitude control|reoriented]] backwards and three of the nine [[Merlin 1D]] engines were reignited at high altitude to initiate a deceleration and controlled descent trajectory to the surface of the ocean. The first phase of the test "worked well and the first stage re-entered safely".&lt;ref name="pa20130930"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.parabolicarc.com/2013/09/29/falcon-9-launch-payloads-orbit-vandenberg/ |title=Falcon 9 Launches Payloads into Orbit From Vandenberg |work=Parabolic Arc |last=Messier |first=Doug |date=September 29, 2013 |accessdate=September 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the stage began to roll because of aerodynamic forces during the atmospheric descent and the roll rate exceeded the capabilities of the first stage [[attitude control system]] (ACS) to [[Null (physics)|null it out]]. The fuel in the tanks "centrifuged" to the outside of the tank and the single engine involved in the low-altitude deceleration maneuver shut down. SpaceX was able to retrieve some first-stage debris from the ocean.&lt;ref name="bbc20130930" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pa20130930" /&gt; The company did not expect to recover the first stage on this flight,&lt;ref name=sdc20131017/&gt; nor on the first several powered-descent tests, as predicted in their March 2013 announcement.&lt;ref name="pa20130328-2"/&gt;

This first experimental descent was considered successful, achieving substantial test milestones and collecting a great deal of engineering data, despite losing the stage into the ocean.&lt;ref name=sdc20131017&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.space.com/23230-spacex-falcon9-reusable-rocket-milestone.html |title=SpaceX Hit Huge Reusable Rocket Milestone with Falcon 9 Test |work=Space.com |last=Wall |first=Mike |date=October 17, 2013 |accessdate=December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; SpaceX tested a large amount of new technology on this flight, and, combining those results with the advances made on the Grasshopper demonstrator, the company now believed it had "all the pieces of the puzzle".&lt;ref name=pm20130930/&gt;&lt;ref name=sdc20131017/&gt;&lt;ref name="th20131025"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/oct/25/things-learned-tesla-elon-musk-electric-car |title=12 interesting things we learned from Tesla's Elon Musk this week |work=The Guardian |first=Adam |last=Vaughan |date=October 25, 2013 |accessdate=October 26, 2013 |quote=We managed to re-enter the atmosphere, not break up like we normally do, and get all way down to sea level.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Flight 9 ====
The second test of controlled-descent hardware and software on the first stage [[Falcon 9 flight 9|occurred on April 8, 2014]],&lt;ref name="ut20140419" /&gt; and became the first successful controlled ocean soft touchdown of a liquid-rocket-engine orbital first stage.&lt;ref name=mit20140422&gt;

The first stage included landing legs for the first time which were extended to simulate a landing upon touchdown, and the test utilized more powerful gaseous Nitrogen [[Reaction control system|control thrusters]] to control the aerodynamic-induced rotation that had occurred on the first test flight.  The first stage successfully approached the water surface with no spin and at zero vertical velocity, as designed.&lt;ref name=dn20140224/&gt;&lt;ref name=aw20140428a&gt;{{cite news |last=Norris |first=Guy |title=SpaceX Plans For Multiple Reusable first stage Tests |url=http://aviationweek.com/space/spacex-plans-multiple-reusable-booster-tests |accessdate=May 17, 2014 |newspaper=Aviation Week |date=April 28, 2014 |quote=The April 17 F9R Dev 1 flight, which lasted under 1 min., was the first vertical landing test of a production-representative recoverable Falcon 9 v1.1 first stage, while the April 18 cargo flight to the ISS was the first opportunity for SpaceX to evaluate the design of foldable landing legs and upgraded thrusters that control the stage during its initial descent.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Flight 10 ====
The third test flight of a returned first stage was July 14, 2014, on [[Falcon 9 flight 10]]. Whereas the previous test reached a target landing area some hundreds of kilometers off the Florida coast, this flight aimed for a boost-back trajectory that would attempt the ocean touchdown much nearer the coast, and closer to the original launch location at Cape Canaveral.

The fourth test flight of a returned first stage, with a planned ocean touchdown, occurred on [[SpaceX CRS-4|Falcon 9 flight 13]] which was launched on September 21, 2014.&lt;ref name=sn20140721/&gt; and the first stage flew a profile approaching a zero-velocity at zero-altitude simulated landing on the sea surface.&lt;ref name=aw20141016/&gt;  SpaceX made no attempt to recover the first stage, since earlier tests had confirmed that the 14-[[Storey|story]]&lt;!-- use US spelling:  story, not storey --&gt; tall first stage would not survive the tip-over event into the sea.  The booster did run out of liquid oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvim4rsNHkQ&amp;t=32s&lt;/ref&gt;

One month later, detailed [[thermal imaging]] infrared sensor data and video were released of the controlled-descent test.  The data was collected by NASA in a joint arrangement with SpaceX as part of research on [[supersonic retropropulsion|retropropulsive deceleration technologies]] in order to develop new approaches to [[Mars]] [[atmospheric entry]].  A key problem with propulsive techniques is handling the [[Fluid dynamics|fluid flow]] problems and [[attitude control system|attitude control]] of the descent vehicle during the supersonic retropropulsion phase of the entry and deceleration.  All phases of the night-time flight test on the first stage were successfully imaged except for the final landing burn, as that occurred below the clouds where the [[Infrared signature|IR data]] was not visible.&lt;ref name=aw20141016&gt;

SpaceX had planned to make the sixth controlled-descent test flight and second&lt;ref name=nsf20150208/&gt; landing attempt on their drone ship no earlier than February 11, 2015.

According to regulatory paperwork filed in 2014, SpaceX plans had called for the sixth test flight to occur on a [[Falcon 9 flight 15|late January 2015 launch attempt]]. However, after the completion of the fifth test flight, and with some damage being incurred by the drone ship in the botched landing, it was not clear whether the sixth test would still be feasible only a few weeks later.&lt;ref name=sfn20150110&gt;

This issue was resolved within days of the ship's return to Jacksonville, and by January 15, SpaceX was unambiguous about its plans to attempt a landing of the first stage following the boost phase of the [[Deep Space Climate Observatory]] mission.&lt;ref name=nsf20150116&gt;

However, in a statement by SpaceX, the drone ship was in conditions "with waves reaching up to three stories in height crashing over the decks". Additionally, one of the four thrusters that keep the barge in a constant position had malfunctioned, making station-keeping difficult. For these reasons, the post-launch flight test did not involve the barge, but instead attempted a soft touchdown over water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wall |first1=Mike |title=SpaceX Won't Try Rocket Landing on Drone Ship After Satellite Launch Today |url=http://www.space.com/28528-spacex-launch-moon-blackout.html |website=Space.com |accessdate=February 11, 2015 |date=February 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The test was successful, and the first stage of the Falcon 9 landed "nicely vertical" with an accuracy of 10 meters from the target location in the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hull |first1=Dana |title=SpaceX Launches Satellite as Rocket Recovery Is Scrapped |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-11/spacex-drops-bid-to-land-rocket-booster-on-ship-amid-rough-seas |website=Bloomberg |publisher=Bloomberg |accessdate=February 12, 2015 |date=February 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, this test represented the fifth ocean touchdown, and the sixth overall Falcon 9 first stage controlled-descent test.

In July 2014, SpaceX announced that the fifth and sixth controlled-descent test flights would attempt to land on a solid surface, merging the lessons from the high-altitude [[flight envelope|envelope expansion]] of the first four controlled-descent flights over water with the low-altitude lessons of the [[F9R Dev]] testing in Texas.&lt;ref name=sn20140721&gt;

Many of the test objectives were achieved on the first attempt, including bringing the stage to the specific location of the floating platform and collecting a large amount of test data with the first use of [[grid fin]] control surfaces for more precise reentry positioning. However the touchdown on the corner of the barge was a [[hard landing]] and most of the rocket body fell into the ocean and sank; SpaceX published a short clip of the crash.&lt;ref name="flight14-vine" /&gt; It would take four more attempts to achieve the first barge landing at sea on [[#Flight 23: first landing on drone ship|flight 23]].&lt;ref name="flight23-natgeo" /&gt; Meanwhile, ground landing succeeded on the first attempt with [[#Flight 20: first landing on ground pad|flight 20]] on December 21, 2015.&lt;ref name="flight20-space.com" /&gt;

In October 2014, SpaceX clarified that the "solid surface" would be a [[Floating landing platform|floating platform]] constructed from a barge in Louisiana, and confirmed that they would attempt to land the first stage of the [[Falcon 9 flight 14|fourteenth Falcon 9 flight]] on the platform.&lt;ref name=sn20141024&gt;

In late November, SpaceX revealed that the landing barge would be capable of [[Autonomous robot|autonomous operation]] and would not need to be anchored or moored;&lt;ref name=nsf20141124 /&gt; it was hence called an [[autonomous spaceport drone ship]]. {{As of|2015|1}} three of these ships had been built, two of which were operational.&lt;ref name=musk20150123&gt;{{cite web |url=https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/558703223909781505 |title=West Coast droneship under construction... |publisher=Twitter.com |first=Elon |last=Musk |date=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SpaceX webcast indicated that the boostback burn and reentry burns for the descending first stage occurred, and that the descending rocket then went "below the horizon," as expected, which eliminated the live telemetry signal, so that the [[retropropulsive landing]] attempt was not shown live.  Shortly thereafter, SpaceX released information that the rocket did get to the drone ship as planned, but "landed hard ... Ship itself is fine.

On January 15, 2016, SpaceX conducted the static fire test on the recovered booster and reported a good overall outcome, except for some thrust fluctuations in one of the outer engines (engine 9). Elon Musk reported that this may have been due to debris ingestion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=SpaceX Tests Recovered Falcon 9 Stage and Prepares for Next Launch|url=http://spacenews.com/spacex-tests-recovered-falcon-9-stage-and-prepares-for-next-launch/ |date=January 15, 2016 |accessdate=2016-01-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This booster has been on display outside of SpaceX headquarters in Hawthorne, California since August 20, 2016.

==== Flight 21 ====
[[Falcon 9 Flight 21|Flight 21]], the final launch of a [[Falcon 9 v1.1]], carried the [[Jason 3]] payload. At one point this was the first possible opportunity for an attempt to land the first stage on land,&lt;ref name=nsf20150403&gt;
{{cite news |last1=Bergin |first1=Chris |title=SpaceX preparing for a busy season of missions and test milestones |url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2015/04/spacex-preparing-busy-season-missions-test-milestones/ |accessdate=April 4, 2015 |work=NASASpaceFlight.com |date=April 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
but the launches were reordered following the loss of [[Falcon 9 flight 19]] in June 2015. Jason-3 was successfully launched on January 17, 2016, and while the first stage managed to slow down towards a soft landing, the lockout [[collet]] on one of the landing legs did not latch correctly, which caused the rocket to fall over and explode after touching down.&lt;ref name="musk-tweet-20160117"&gt;

Elon Musk noted that ice buildup on the collet from the high-humidity launch conditions may have led to the failure of the latch.&lt;ref&gt;

==== Flight 22 ====
On March 4, 2016 the Falcon 9 flight 22 launched the {{convert|5,271|kg|round=10|abbr=on|adj=on}} heavy [[SES-9]] [[communications satellite]],&lt;ref name=sfn20160224&gt;

the rocket's largest payload yet targeting a [[delta-V|highly-energetic]] [[geosynchronous transfer orbit]] (GTO). Consequently, the Falcon 9 first stage followed a [[ballistic trajectory]] after separation and re-entered the atmosphere at high velocity with very little fuel to mitigate potential aerodynamic damage.

Therefore, SpaceX did not expect to successfully land its Falcon 9 booster on its sea barge, the ''[[Of Course I Still Love You]],'' positioned in the Atlantic Ocean. Elon Musk confirmed in a tweet that the landing attempt had failed.&lt;ref name="musk-tweet-20160304"&gt;{{cite tweet |user=elonmusk |author-link=Elon Musk |number=705917924972736512 |date=March 4, 2016 |access-date=May 8, 2016 |title=Rocket landed hard on the droneship.

==== Flight 23: first landing on a drone ship ====
{{anchor|Flight 23}}
On April 8, 2016, Falcon 9 flight 23, the third flight of [[Falcon 9 Full Thrust|the full-thrust version]], delivered the [[SpaceX CRS-8]] cargo on its way to the [[International Space Station]] while the first stage conducted a boostback and re-entry maneuver over the Atlantic Ocean. Nine minutes after liftoff, [[Falcon 9 booster B1021|the booster]] landed vertically on the drone ship ''Of Course I Still Love You'', {{convert|300|km|abbr=on}} from the Florida coastline, achieving a long-sought-after milestone for the [[SpaceX reusable launch system development program|SpaceX reusability development program]].&lt;ref name="flight23-natgeo"&gt;

Hello, future. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This stage, serial number [[B1021]], was refurbished and flown again in March 2017 for the [[SES-10]] mission, setting another milestone in the development of reusable rockets.

==== Flight 24: first return from GTO mission ====
{{anchor|Flight 24}}
On May 6, 2016, Falcon 9 flight 24 delivered the [[JCSAT-14]] satellite on a [[geostationary transfer orbit]] (GTO) while the first stage conducted a re-entry burn under ballistic conditions without prior boostback. Following the controlled descent through the atmosphere, the booster executed a short landing burn  as it approached the drone ship ''Of Course I Still Love You'', and succeeded in landing vertically. This second landing at sea was more difficult than the previous one because the booster at separation was traveling about {{convert|8350|km/h|abbr=on}} compared to {{convert|6650|km/h|abbr=on}} on the CRS-8 launch to [[low Earth orbit]].&lt;ref name="SpaceX"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pUAydjne5M|title=CRS-8 Dragon Hosted Webcast|first=|last=SpaceX|date=April 8, 2016|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SpaceX"/&gt; Pursuing their experiments to test the limits of the [[flight envelope]], SpaceX opted for a shorter landing burn with three engines instead of the single-engine burns seen in earlier attempts; this approach consumes less fuel by leaving the stage in free fall as long as possible and decelerating more sharply, thereby minimizing the amount of energy expended to counter gravity.&lt;ref name="musk-tweet-20160506"&gt;

That's important to minimize gravity losses. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Elon Musk indicated this first stage may not be flown again and will instead be used as a life leader for ground tests to confirm future first stage rockets are good.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.floridatoday.com/story/tech/science/space/spacex/2016/05/16/landed-spacex-rocket-suffered-max-damage/84454230/|title=SpaceX Falcon 9 first stage booster suffered 'max' damage on landing|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Flight 25 ====
On May 27, 2016, Falcon 9 flight 25 delivered [[Thaicom 8|THAICOM 8]] to a supersynchronous transfer orbit; despite high re-entry speed, the first stage again landed successfully on the SpaceX drone ship.&lt;ref name="mashable20160402"&gt;{{cite web |last=Kramer |first=Miriam |title=SpaceX does it again: Company lands third rocket on drone ship in the ocean |url=http://mashable.com/2016/05/27/spacex-drone-ship-third-landing/ |date=27 May 2016  |work=[[Mashable]] |accessdate=28 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The landing crushed a "crush core" in one leg, leading to a notable tilt to the stage as it stood on the drone ship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wall|first1=Mike|title=SpaceX's Leaning Rocket Tower Comes Ashore (Photos)|url=http://www.space.com/33102-spacex-leaning-rocket-comes-ashore-photos.html|accessdate=7 June 2016|date=7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Flight 26 ====
On June 15, 2016, [[Falcon 9 flight 26]] successfully delivered the [[Eutelsat]] 117W B&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/SpaceX/status/743095831088091141|title=SpaceX on Twitter|website=Twitter|access-date=2016-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[ABS (satellite operator)|ABS]] 2A&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/SpaceX/status/743097021347700736|title=SpaceX on Twitter|website=Twitter|access-date=2016-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; satellites into GTO. The first stage conducted a re-entry burn and successfully deployed its grid fins, before attempting a landing on the barge. The landing failed in its final moments due to low thrust on one of the first stage engines, caused by the exhaustion of its liquid oxygen fuel supply. That caused the engines to shut down early while the first stage was just above the drone's deck, causing a landing failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/743096769001578498|title=Elon Musk on Twitter|website=Twitter|access-date=2016-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/743097337782763521|title=Elon Musk on Twitter|website=Twitter|access-date=2016-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Flight 27 ====

== Transition to routine reuse ==
{{Further|List of Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launches#Future launches}}
SpaceX continued to return a number of first stages in both ground and sea landings to clarify the procedures needed to re-use flown boosters. The company had hoped to begin offering pre-flown Falcon 9 rocket stages commercially by the end of 2016,&lt;ref&gt;

The booster performed well and was recovered a second time.

In January 2016 Musk evaluated the likelihood of success to approximately 70 percent for landing attempts in 2016, hopefully rising to 90 percent in 2017; he also cautioned that the company expected "a few more RUDs", referring to the term ''Rapid Unscheduled Disassembly'', a humorous euphemism for destruction of the vehicle.&lt;ref name="musk-tweet-20160119"&gt;{{cite tweet |user=elonmusk |author-link=Elon Musk |number=689299216607232000 |date=January 19, 2016 |access-date=May 8, 2016 |title=My best guess for 2016: ~70% landing success rate (so still a few more RUDs to go), then hopefully improving to ~90% in 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Musk's prediction were close to the actual numbers, as five out of eight flown boosters ({{percent|5|8}}) were recovered in 2016, and 14 out of 14 ({{percent|14|14}}) in 2017. Three GTO missions for heavy payloads were flown in an [[expendable launch system|expendable]] configuration, not equipped for landing. Five boosters were flown a second time in 2017, marking the beginning of routine reuse of boosters.

}}
A '''feeding tube''' is a medical device used to provide nutrition to people who cannot obtain nutrition by mouth, are unable to swallow safely, or need nutritional supplementation. The state of being fed by a feeding tube is called '''gavage''', '''enteral feeding''' or '''tube feeding'''. Placement may be temporary for the treatment of acute conditions or lifelong in the case of chronic disabilities. 
A variety of feeding tubes are used in medical practice. They are usually made of [[polyurethane]] or silicone. The diameter of a feeding tube is measured in [[French catheter scale|French unit]]s (each French unit equals ⅓ mm). They are classified by the site of insertion and intended use.
{{TOC limit|3}}

== Medical uses ==
There are dozens of conditions that may require tube feeding.  The more common conditions that necessitate feeding tubes include prematurity, failure to thrive (or malnutrition), neurologic and neuromuscular disorders, inability to swallow, anatomical and post-surgical malformations of the mouth and esophagus, cancer, [[Sanfilippo syndrome]], and digestive disorders.

===Children===
Feeding tubes are used widely in children with excellent success for a wide variety of conditions.  Some children use them temporarily until they are able to eat on their own, while other children require them longterm.  Some children only use feeding tubes to supplement their oral diet, while others rely on them exclusively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hannah|first1=E|last2=John|first2=RM|title=Everything the nurse practitioner should know about pediatric feeding tubes.|journal=Journal of the American Association of Nurse Practitioners|date=November 2013|volume=25|issue=11|pages=567–77|doi=10.1002/2327-6924.12075|pmid=24170530}}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Craig|first1=GM|title=Psychosocial aspects of feeding children with neurodisability.|journal=European journal of clinical nutrition|date=December 2013|volume=67 Suppl 2|pages=S17–20|doi=10.1038/ejcn.2013.226|pmid=24301004}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dementia===
People with advanced [[dementia]] who get [[Assisted feeding|feeding assistance]] rather than feeding tubes have better outcomes.&lt;ref name="AAHPMfive"&gt;{{Citation |author1 = American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine |date = |title = Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question |publisher = American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine |work = Choosing Wisely: an initiative of the ABIM Foundation |page = |url = http://www.choosingwisely.org/doctor-patient-lists/american-academy-of-hospice-palliative-medicine/ |accessdate = August 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feeding tubes do not increase [[life expectancy]] for such people, or protect them from aspiration pneumonia.&lt;ref name="AAHPMfive"/&gt; Feeding tubes can also increase the risk of [[pressure ulcers]], require pharmacological or [[physical restraints]], and lead to [[Distress (medicine)|distress]].&lt;ref name="AAHPMfive"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hanson | first1 = L.

===ICU===
Feeding tubes are often used in the [[intensive care unit]] (ICU) to provide nutrition to people who are critically ill while their medical conditions are addressed; as of 2016 there was no consensus as to whether nasogastric or gastric tubes led to better outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schlein|first1=K|title=Gastric Versus Small Bowel Feeding in Critically Ill Adults.|journal=Nutrition in clinical practice : official publication of the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition|date=August 2016|volume=31|issue=4|pages=514–22|doi=10.1177/0884533616629633|pmid=26920643}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===GI surgery===
People who have surgery on their throat or stomach often have a feeding tube while recovering from surgery; a tube leading through the nose and down to the [[Jejunum|middle part of the small intestine]] is used, or a tube is directly placed through the abdomen to the small intestine.  As of 2017 it appeared that people with a tube through the nose were able to start eating normally sooner.&lt;ref name=Wang2017&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=L|last2=Tian|first2=Z|last3=Liu|first3=Y|title=Nasoenteric tube versus jejunostomy for enteral nutrition feeding following major upper gastrointestinal operations: a meta-analysis.|journal=Asia Pacific journal of clinical nutrition|date=January 2017|volume=26|issue=1|pages=20–26|pmid=28049257|url=http://apjcn.nhri.org.tw/server/APJCN/26/1/20.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Product types==

Medical nutrition companies make flavored products for drinking and unflavored for tube feeding. These are regulated as [[medical food]]s, which are defined in section 5(b) of the [[Orphan Drug Act of 1983|Orphan Drug Act]] (21 U.S.C. 360ee (b) (3)) as "a food which is formulated to be consumed or administered enterally under the supervision of a physician and which is intended for the specific dietary management of a disease or condition for which distinctive nutritional requirements, based on recognized scientific principles, are established by medical evaluation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformation/MedicalFoods/default.htm|title=Medical Foods Guidance Documents &amp; Regulatory Information|first=Office of Regulatory|last=Affairs|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformation/MedicalFoods/ucm054048.htm|title=Medical Foods - Guidance for Industry: Frequently Asked Questions About Medical Foods; Second Edition|first=Center for Food Safety and Applied|last=Nutrition|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Complications ==

Nasogastric and nasojejeunal tubes are meant to convey liquid food to the stomach or intestines.  When inserted incorrectly, the tip may rest in the respiratory system instead of the stomach or intestines; in this case, the liquid food will enter the lungs, resulting in pneumonia and can, in rare cases, lead to death.&lt;ref name=Tiancha2015/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Santos|first1=SC|last2=Woith|first2=W|last3=Freitas|first3=MI|last4=Zeferino|first4=EB|title=Methods to determine the internal length of nasogastric feeding tubes: An integrative review.|journal=International journal of nursing studies|date=September 2016|volume=61|pages=95–103|doi=10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2016.06.004|pmid=27328376}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Metheny|first1=NA|last2=Meert|first2=KL|title=Effectiveness of an electromagnetic feeding tube placement device in detecting inadvertent respiratory placement.|journal=American Journal of Critical Care|date=May 2014|volume=23|issue=3|pages=240–7; quiz 248|doi=10.4037/ajcc2014954|pmid=24786813}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Complications associated with gastrostomy tubes (inserted through the abdomen and into the stomach or intestines) include leakage of gastric contents (containing hydrochloric acid) around the tube into the abdominal (peritoneal) cavity resulting in peritonitis, a serious complication which will cause death if it is not properly treated. [[Septic shock]] is another possible complication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=16847244|journal=Arch Surg|date=July 2006|volume=141|issue=7|pages=701–4|title=Bowel necrosis associated with early jejunal tube feeding: A complication of postoperative enteral nutrition|authors=Melis M1, Fichera A, Ferguson MK.|doi=10.1001/archsurg.141.7.701}}&lt;/ref&gt; Minor leakage may cause irritation of the skin around the gastrostomy site or stoma. Barrier creams, to protect the skin from the corrosive acid, are used to manage this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Townley|first1=A|last2=Wincentak|first2=J|last3=Krog|first3=K|last4=Schippke|first4=J|last5=Kingsnorth|first5=S|title=Pediatric gastrostomy stoma complications and treatments: A rapid scoping review.|journal=Journal of clinical nursing|date=21 December 2017|doi=10.1111/jocn.14233|pmid=29266535}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A phenomenon called "tube dependency" has been discussed in the medical literature, in which a child refuses to eat after being on a feeding tube, but it is not recognized as a disorder in the ICD or DSM and its epidemiology is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Krom|first1=H|last2=de Winter|first2=JP|last3=Kindermann|first3=A|title=Development, prevention, and treatment of feeding tube dependency.|journal=European Journal of Pediatrics|date=June 2017|volume=176|issue=6|pages=683–688|doi=10.1007/s00431-017-2908-x|pmid=28409284|pmc=5432583}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==
The most common types of tubes include those placed through the nose, including nasogastric, nasoduodenal, and nasojejunal tubes, and those placed directly into the abdomen, such as a gastrostomy, gastrojejunostomy, or jejunostomy feeding tube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Peggi |last1=Guenter |chapter=Enteral Feeding Access Devices |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=dhCmKKpNcK0C&amp;pg=PA51 |pages=51–67 |year=2001 |editor1-first=Peggi |editor1-last=Guenter |editor2-first=Marcia |editor2-last=Silkroski |title=Tube Feeding: Practical Guidelines and Nursing Protocols |location=Gaithersburg |publisher=Aspen Publishers |isbn=978-0-8342-1939-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NICE&gt;{{cite web|title=Nutrition support for adults: oral nutrition support, enteral tube feeding and parenteral nutrition|url=https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg32/chapter/1-Guidance|publisher=NICE|accessdate=30 January 2018|date=August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nasogastric feeding tube===
{{main|Nasogastric intubation}}
A [[Nasogastric intubation|nasogastric feeding tube]] or NG-tube is passed through the nares (nostril), down the esophagus and into the stomach. This type of feeding tube is generally used for short term feeding, usually less than a month, though some infants and children may use an NG-tube longterm.  Individuals who need tube feeding for a longer period of time are typically transitioned to a more permanent gastric feeding tube.  The primary advantage of the NG-tube is that it is temporary and relatively non-invasive to place, meaning it can be removed or replaced at any time without surgery.  NG-tubes can have complications, particularly related to accidental removal of the tube and nasal irritation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dysphagia Treatment|url=https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/swallowing-problems-dysphagia/treatment/|publisher=NHS Choices|date=19 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nasojejunal feeding tube===
A nasojejunal or NJ-tube is similar to an NG-tube except that it is threaded through the stomach and into the jejunum, the middle section of the small intestine. In some cases, a nasoduodenal or ND-tube may be placed into the duodenum, the first part of the small intestine.  These types of tubes are used for individuals who are unable to tolerate feeding into the stomach, due to dysfunction of the stomach, impaired gastric motility, severe reflux or vomiting.  These types of tubes must be placed in a hospital setting.&lt;ref name=Wang2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tiancha2015&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tiancha|first1=H|last2=Jiyong|first2=J|last3=Min|first3=Y|title=How to Promote Bedside Placement of the Postpyloric Feeding Tube: A Network Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.|journal=JPEN. Journal of parenteral and enteral nutrition|date=July 2015|volume=39|issue=5|pages=521–30|doi=10.1177/0148607114546166|pmid=25146431}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== {{anchor|Gastric feeding tube}}Gastrostomy or gastric feeding tube ===
A '''gastric feeding tube''' ('''G-tube''' or "button") is a tube inserted through a small incision in the abdomen into the [[stomach]] and is used for long-term enteral nutrition. One type is the [[percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy]] (PEG) tube which is placed endoscopically. The position of the endoscope can be visualized on the outside of the person's abdomen because it contains a powerful light source. A needle is inserted through the abdomen, visualized within the stomach by the endoscope, and a suture passed through the needle is grasped by the endoscope and pulled up through the esophagus. The suture is then tied to the end of the PEG tube that will be external, and pulled back down through the esophagus, stomach, and out through the abdominal wall. The insertion takes about 20 minutes. The tube is kept within the stomach either by a balloon on its tip (which can be deflated) or by a retention dome which is wider than the tract of the tube.  G-tubes may also be placed surgically, using either an open or laparoscopic technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thaker|first1=AM|last2=Sedarat|first2=A|title=Laparoscopic-Assisted Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy.|journal=Current gastroenterology reports|date=September 2016|volume=18|issue=9|pages=46|doi=10.1007/s11894-016-0520-2|pmid=27422123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gastric feeding tubes are suitable for long-term use, though they sometimes need to be replaced if used long term. The G-tube can be useful where there is difficulty with swallowing because of neurologic or anatomic disorders (stroke, [[esophageal atresia]], tracheoesophageal fistula, [[radiotherapy]] for [[head and neck cancer]]), and to decrease the risk of [[aspiration pneumonia]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alkhawaja|first=Sana|last2=Martin|first2=Claudio|last3=Butler|first3=Ronald J.|last4=Gwadry-Sridhar|first4=Femida|date=2015-08-04|title=Post-pyloric versus gastric tube feeding for preventing pneumonia and improving nutritional outcomes in critically ill adults|url=|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=|issue=8|pages=CD008875|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD008875.pub2|issn=1469-493X|pmid=26241698|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in people with advanced [[dementia]] or adult [[failure to thrive]] it does not decrease the risk of pneumonia. There is moderate quality evidence suggesting that the risk of aspiration pneumonia may be reduced by inserting the feeding tube into the duodenum or the jejunum (post-pyloric feeding), when compared to inserting the feeding tube into the stomach.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; People with dementia may attempt to remove the PEG, which causes complications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=J Minim Access Surg.|date=January–March 2008|volume=4|issue=1|pages=1–4|pmid=19547728|

Siamak Milanchi and Matthew T Wilson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Gastric drainage tube ====
A G-tube may instead be used for gastric drainage as a longer term solution to the condition where blockage in the proximal small intestine causes bile and acid to accumulate in the stomach, typically leading to periodic vomiting, or if the [[vagus nerve]] is damaged. Where such conditions are only short term, as in a hospital setting, a nasal tube connected to suction is usually used.  A blockage lower in the intestinal tract may be addressed with a surgical procedure known as a [[colostomy]], and either type of blockage may be corrected with a [[bowel resection]] under appropriate circumstances. If such correction is not possible or practical, nutrition may be supplied by [[parenteral nutrition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Costa|first1=G|last2=Ruscelli|first2=P|last3=Balducci|first3=G|last4=Buccoliero|first4=F|last5=Lorenzon|first5=L|last6=Frezza|first6=B|last7=Chirletti|first7=P|last8=Stagnitti|first8=F|last9=Miniello|first9=S|last10=Stella|first10=F|title=Clinical strategies for the management of intestinal obstruction and pseudo-obstruction.

=== Gastrojejunal feeding tube ===
A gastrojejunostomy or GJ feeding tube is a combination device that includes access to both the stomach and the jejunum, or middle part of the small intestine.  Typical tubes are placed in a G-tube site or stoma, with a narrower long tube continuing through the stomach and into the small intestine.  The GJ-tube is used widely in individuals with severe gastric motility, high risk of aspiration, or an inability to feed into the stomach.  It allows the stomach to be continually vented or drained while simultaneously feeding into the small intestine.  GJ-tubes are typically placed by an interventional radiologist in a hospital setting.   The primary complication of a GJ-tube is migration of the long portion of the tube out of the intestine and back into the stomach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gershman|first1=George|last2=Ament|first2=Marvin|title=Practical Pediatric Gastrointestinal Endoscopy|date=2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9780470987315|page=126|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bAAUI9f04jIC&amp;pg=PA126|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jejunal feeding tube===
A '''jejunostomy feeding tube''' ('''J-tube''') is a tube surgically or endoscopically inserted through the abdomen and into the [[jejunum]] (the second part of the [[small intestine]]).&lt;ref name=Wang2017/&gt;

==Career==

Ricart set up what was probably the first [[Internet Exchange]] point, the FIX (Federal Internet Exchange) in [[College Park, Maryland]] which interconnected the original federal [[TCP/IP]] networks and was extended to form [[MAE-East]].

Ricart led the team that wrote the code for the first implementation of TCP/IP for the IBM PC.  He then secured financial support from [[IBM]] for writing the code, and, in addition to its free availability to the education community, arranged for IBM to sell it as IBM's entry into the field (the product was called PC/IP by IBM).
He led the team that developed the [[OSPF]] reference implementation at the University of Maryland, including Louis Mamakos and Mike Petry.
He also led the team that provided and operated the routers for the first [[NSFNet]] backbone.

The [[Ricart-Agrawala Algorithm]] was the result of his dissertation work at the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]]. 

From 1971 to 1982, he was a lead software engineer at the [[National Institutes of Health]], developing the first e-mail program for the [[TOPS-10]] ([[PDP-10]]) operating system in 1973.  From 1982-1993, he headed academic computing at the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]].  In 1984, it became the first campus to adopt [[TCP/IP]] campus-wide and use it to connect all academic minicomputers and mainframes.

In 1985 to 1989, he was instrumental in bringing the [[Internet]] to [[South America]], helping to bring the first [[BITNET]] and Internet connections to [[Brazil]] in partnership with [[CNPq]], [[Argentina]] via the [[University of Buenos Aires]], and [[Chile]] by first connecting REUNA.  He instructed the first networking workshop for Latin and South America (ESLARED) and several succeeding workshops.

From 1993 to 1995, Ricart was a Program Manager at [[DARPA]] for [[operating systems]], [[middleware]], and end-system security.  From 1995 to 1999, he was chief technology officer at [[Novell]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=David Kirkpatrick|url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1997/05/26/226644/index.htm|title=He Wants All Your Business....|date= May 26, 1997|work=[[CNN]]|accessdate= August 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; helping to move that company from the proprietary [[Xerox Network Systems]] protocol to also embrace [[TCP/IP]].  In 1999, he co-founded CenterBeam, a start-up based on remote [[system management]] driven by [[directory services]].

From 2003 to 2009, he was the founding managing director of the [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]] Center for Advanced Research based in [[San Jose, California]].

In October 2009 Ricart was named president and CEO of [[National LambdaRail]], the high-speed networking platform owned by the U.S. research and education community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= National LambdaRail Names New CEO: Glenn Ricart |date= October 5, 2009 |work= Press release |url= http://www.nlr.net/release49.php |accessdate= June 6, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
On September 7, 2010 he announced his resignation from National LambdaRail due to strategic differences with the board.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= National LambdaRail (NLR) Appoints CTO Wendy Huntoon as Acting President and CEO |date= September 7, 2010 |work= Press release |url= http://www.nlr.net/release69.php  |accessdate= June 6, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 he presented the [[Bernard Price Memorial Lecture]] in South Africa.

In 2013, he was inducted into the [[Internet Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;http://internethalloffame.org/inductees/glenn-ricart&lt;/ref&gt;

He previously served on the boards of the [[Internet Society]], [[BITNET]], [[CACI]], First USA Financial Services, [[Santa Cruz Operation]], and [[NASULGC]]. He is the CTO of Artkick - a service that displays artwork on televisions.

Ricart received his B.S. degree in engineering from Case Institute of Technology in 1971, and his M.S. in Computing and Information Sciences from [[Case Western Reserve University]] in 1973.  He received his doctorate in the [[University of Maryland Department of Computer Science]], which is part of the [[University of Maryland College of Computer, Mathematical, and Natural Sciences]] in 1980, mentored by [[Ashok Agrawala]].

'''Go-box''' is a name used for a number of electronic devices.

The "Go-Box" is often a box, crate, carry-case, modified briefcase or similar construction containing electronic equipment pre-setup and ready to function.  The box can then be taken into the field or placed at a remote site with minimal effort.  These are often used by radio amateurs (or "Hams") for emergency communications, experimental work, or field communications.  This has also led to similar equipment being used in the Emergency Services, utility companies, military, and government agencies.

A search of the YouTube website can reveal a number of ideas for these devices mostly built by people at home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_95WEjoeA0/|title=Video of Go-Box construction|author=kc6tyd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Terms created after the use of "go-box" include the "go-bag" which is an 'essentials' bag of items needed for evacuations or quick departures, i.e. medicines, clothes, torch, Broadcast radio receiver, batteries, etc.

In [[Austria]] it is a radio transmitter used in trucks as part of the [[Videomaut]] toll collection system.

One use of the term in the [[United States]] it is a device which is supposed to change traffic signals from red to green.

The idea of the [[Panama canal]] dates back to 1513, when [[Vasco Núñez de Balboa]] first crossed the [[isthmus]]. The narrow land bridge between [[North America|North]] and South America houses the Panama Canal, a water passage between the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] and [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] Oceans. The earliest European colonists recognized this potential, and several proposals for a [[canal]] were made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Lydia|title=Panama Canal 100th Anniversary|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/panama-canal-100th-anniversary-history-facts-about-one-seven-wonders-modern-world-1461183|website=International Business Times|accessdate=May 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late nineteenth century, technological advances and commercial pressure allowed construction to begin in earnest. Noted canal engineer [[Ferdinand de Lesseps]] led an initial attempt by France to build a [[sea-level]] canal.  Beset by cost overruns due to the severe underestimation of the difficulties in excavating the rugged Panama land, heavy personnel losses in Panama due to [[tropical diseases]], and [[Panama scandals|political corruption in France]] surrounding the financing of the massive project, the project succeeded in only partially completing the canal. 

Interest in a U.S.-led canal effort picked up as soon as France abandoned the project.  Initially, the Panama site was politically unfavorable in the U.S. for a variety of reasons, including the taint of the failed French efforts and the [[Colombia]]n government's unfriendly attitude towards the U.S. continuing the project.  The U.S. first sought to construct a [[History of the Nicaragua Canal|completely new canal]] through [[Nicaragua]] instead.

French engineer and financier [[Philippe-Jean Bunau-Varilla]] played a key role in changing U.S. attitudes.  Bunau-Varilla had a large stake in the failed French canal company, and stood to make money on his investment only if the Panama Canal was completed.  Extensive [[lobbying]] of U.S. lawmakers coupled with his support of a nascent independence movement among the Panamanian people led to a simultaneous revolution in Panama and the negotiation of the [[Hay–Bunau-Varilla Treaty]] which secured both independence for Panama and the right for the U.S. to lead a renewed effort to construct the canal.  Colombia's response to the Panamanian independence movement was tempered by U.S. military presence; the move is often cited as a classic example of the era of [[gunboat diplomacy]].

U.S. success hinged on two factors.  First was converting the original French sea-level plan to a more realistic [[Lock (water navigation)|lock]]-controlled canal.  The second was controlling disease which decimated workers and management alike under the original French attempt.  Initial chief engineer [[John Frank Stevens]] built much of the infrastructure necessary for later construction; slow progress on the canal itself led to his replacement by [[George Washington Goethals]].  Goethals oversaw the bulk of the excavation of the canal, including appointing Major [[David du Bose Gaillard]] to oversee the most daunting project, the [[Culebra Cut]] through the roughest terrain on the route.  Almost as important as the engineering advances was the healthcare advances made during the construction, led by [[William C. Gorgas]], an expert in controlling tropical diseases such as [[yellow fever]] and [[malaria]].  Gorgas was one of the first to recognize the role of [[mosquito]]es in the spread of these diseases, and by focusing on controlling the mosquitoes greatly improved worker conditions.

On 7 January 1914 the French crane boat ''Alexandre La Valley'' became the first to make the traverse, and on 1 April 1914 the construction was officially completed with the hand-over of the project from the construction company to the Canal Zone government.  The outbreak of World War I caused the cancellation of any official "grand opening" celebration, and the canal officially opened to commercial traffic on 15 August 1914 with the transit of the ''[[SS Ancon (1901)|SS Ancon]]''.

During World War II, the canal proved a vital part of the U.S. military strategy, allowing ships to transfer easily between the Atlantic and Pacific.  Politically, the Canal remained a territory of the United States until 1977, when the [[Torrijos–Carter Treaties]] began the process of transferring territorial control of the [[Panama Canal Zone]] to Panama, a process completed on 31 December 1999.

The Panama Canal continues to be a viable commercial venture and a vital link in world shipping, and continues to be periodically updated and maintained.  The [[Panama Canal expansion project]] started construction in 2007 and began commercial operation on 26 June 2016. The new locks allow transit of larger [[Post-Panamax]] and [[New Panamax]] ships, which have a greater cargo capacity than the original locks could accommodate.&lt;ref name=NYT062016/&gt;

[[File:Panama Canal MK1888 kl.png|thumb|250px|alt=See caption|1888 German map of a projected Panama Canal (above) and an alternate Nicaragua route (below)]]
The idea of a canal across Central America was revived during the early 19th century. In 1819, the Spanish government authorized the construction of a canal and the creation of a company to build it.

Although the project stalled for some time, a number of surveys were made between 1850 and 1875. They indicated that the two most-favorable routes were across Panama (then part of Colombia) and [[Nicaragua canal|Nicaragua]], with a third route across the [[Isthmus of Tehuantepec]] in Mexico another option. The Nicaraguan route was surveyed.

===Conception===
[[File:Panama-Canal 1880.JPG|thumb|Part de Fondateur of the Compagnie Universelle du Canal Interocéanique de Panama, issued 29. November 1880]]
After the 1869 completion of the [[Suez Canal]], France thought that an apparently similar project to connect the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans could be carried out with little difficulty. In 1876 an international company, La Société internationale du Canal interocéanique, was created to undertake its construction; two years later, it obtained a [[Concession (contract)|concession]] from the Colombian government (since Panama was a Colombian province) to dig a canal across the isthmus.

[[Ferdinand de Lesseps]], who was in charge of the Suez Canal construction, headed the project. His enthusiastic leadership and his reputation as the man who had built the Suez Canal persuaded speculators and ordinary citizens to invest nearly $400&amp;nbsp;million in the project.

However, despite his previous success de Lesseps was not an engineer. The Suez Canal, essentially a ditch dug through a flat, sandy desert, presented few challenges. Although Central America's mountainous spine has a low point in Panama, it is still {{convert|110|m|ft|1|sp=us}} above sea level at its lowest crossing point. The sea-level canal proposed by de Lesseps would require a great deal of excavation through a variety of rock, rather than Suez' sand.

Less-obvious barriers were the rivers crossing the canal, particularly the [[Chagres River|Chagres]] (which flows strongly during the rainy season). Since the water would be a hazard to shipping if it drained into the canal, a sea-level canal would require the river's diversion.

The most serious problem was [[tropical disease]], particularly [[malaria]] and [[yellow fever]], whose methods of transmission were unknown at the time. The legs of hospital beds were placed in cans of water to keep insects from crawling up them, but the stagnant water was an ideal breeding place for mosquitoes (carriers of the diseases).

The project was plagued by a lack of engineering expertise. In May 1879, an international engineering congress led by de Lesseps convened in Paris. Of its 136 delegates, only 42 were engineers; the others were speculators, politicians and friends of de Lesseps.

He was convinced that a sea-level canal, dug through the mountainous spine of Central America, could be completed at least as easily as the Suez Canal. The engineering congress estimated the project's cost at $214 million; on February 14, 1880, an engineering commission revised the estimate to $168.6 million. De Lesseps reduced this estimate twice, with no apparent justification: on February 20 to $131.6 million and on March 1 to $120 million. The congress estimated seven or eight years as the time required to complete the canal; de Lesseps reduced this estimate to six years (the Suez Canal required ten).

The proposed sea-level canal would have a uniform depth of {{convert|9|m|ft|1|sp=us}}, a bottom width of {{convert|22|m|ft|1|sp=us}} and a width at water level of about {{convert|27.5|m|ft|1|sp=us}}; the excavation estimate was {{convert|120000000|m3|cuyd|sigfig=3|abbr=on}}. A dam was proposed at [[Gamboa, Panama|Gamboa]] to control flooding of the Chagres River, with channels to drain water away from the canal. However, the Gamboa dam was later found impracticable and the Chagres River problem was left unsolved.

[[File:The Panama Canal -- The Great Culebra Cut.jpg|thumb|left|250px|alt=Illustration of a large, terraced excavation|The Culebra Cut in 1885]]
Construction of the canal began on January 1, 1881, with digging at [[Culebra Cut|Culebra]] beginning on January 22.{{ref|earthinfo2}} A large labor force was assembled, numbering about 40,000 in 1888 (nine-tenths of whom were [[French Caribbean|afro-Caribbean]] workers from the [[West Indies]]). Although the project attracted good, well-paid French engineers, retaining them was difficult due to disease. The death toll from 1881 to 1889 was estimated at over 22,000, of whom as many as 5,000 were French citizens.&lt;ref&gt;The Path Between the Seas: The Creation of the Panama Canal, 1870–1914, David McCullough, Simon &amp; Schuster, 1978 (a comprehensive history of the building of the canal)&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1885 it had become clear to many that a sea-level canal was impractical, and an elevated canal with locks was preferable; de Lesseps resisted, and a lock canal plan was not adopted until October 1887. By this time increasing mortality rates, as well as financial and engineering problems coupled with frequent [[flood]]s and [[mudslide]]s, indicated that the project was in serious trouble. Work continued under the new plan until May 15, 1889, when the company went bankrupt and the project was suspended. After eight years the canal was about two-fifths completed, and about $234.8 million had been spent.

[[File:CanalPanama.gif|thumb|alt=Photo of the canal's construction|Construction of the canal]]
The company's collapse was a [[Panama scandals|scandal in France]], and the [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] [[Edouard Drumont]] exploited the role of two Jewish [[speculator]]s in the affair. One hundred and four legislators were found to have been involved in the corruption, and [[Jean Jaurès]] was commissioned by the French parliament to conduct an inquiry which was completed in 1893.{{ref|panscandal}}

==={{anchor|New French Canal Company}}New Panama Canal Company===
It soon became clear that the only way to recoup expenses for the stockholders was to continue the project. A new concession was obtained from Colombia, and in 1894 the Compagnie Nouvelle du Canal de Panama was created to finish the canal. To comply with the terms of the contract, work began immediately on the Culebra excavation while a team of engineers began a comprehensive study of the project. They eventually settled on a plan for a two-level, lock-based canal.

The new effort never gained traction, mainly because of US speculation that a canal through Nicaragua would render one through Panama useless. The most men employed on the new project was 3,600 (in 1896), primarily to comply with the terms of the concession and to maintain the existing excavation and equipment in saleable condition. The company had already begun looking for a buyer, with an asking price of $109 million.

In the US, a congressional [[Isthmian Canal Commission of 1899|Isthmian Canal Commission]] was established in 1899 to examine possibilities for a Central American canal and recommend a route. In November 1901, the commission reported that a US canal should be built through Nicaragua unless the French were willing to sell their holdings for $40 million. The recommendation became law on June 28, 1902, and the New Panama Canal Company was compelled to sell at that price.{{ref|french}}

==={{anchor|The French achievement}}Results===
Although the French effort was, to a large extent, doomed to failure from the beginning due to disease and a lack of understanding of the engineering difficulties, it was not entirely futile. The old and new companies excavated {{convert|59747638|m3|cuyd|0|abbr=on}} of material, of which {{convert|14255890|m3|cuyd|0|abbr=on}} was taken from the [[Culebra Cut]]. The old company dredged a channel from [[Panama Bay]] to the port at [[Balboa, Panama|Balboa]], and the channel dredged on the Atlantic side (known as the French canal) was useful for bringing in sand and stone for the locks and spillway concrete at [[Gatún]].

Detailed surveys and studies (particularly those carried out by the new canal company) and machinery, including railroad equipment and vehicles, aided the later American effort. The French lowered the summit of the Culebra Cut along the canal route by five meters (17&amp;nbsp;ft), from {{convert|64|to|59|m}}. An estimated {{convert|22713396|m3|cuyd|0|abbr=on}} of excavation, valued at about $25.4 million, and equipment and surveys valued at about $17.4 million were usable by the Americans.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

=={{anchor|Nicaragua}}Nicaraguan canal==
{{Main article|Nicaragua Canal}}

The 1848 [[California Gold Rush|discovery of gold in California]] and the rush of would-be miners stimulated US interest in building a canal between the oceans. In 1887, a [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] regiment surveyed canal possibilities in Nicaragua. Two years later, the Maritime Canal Company was asked to begin a canal in the area and chose Nicaragua. The company lost money in the [[panic of 1893]], and its work in Nicaragua ceased. In 1897 and 1899, the [[United States Congress]] charged a canal commission with researching possible construction; Nicaragua was chosen as the location both times.

Although the Nicaraguan canal proposal was made redundant by the American takeover of the French Panama Canal project, increases in shipping volume and ship sizes have revived interest in the project. A canal across Nicaragua accommodating post-[[Panamax]] ships or a rail link carrying containers between ports on either coast have been proposed.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

[[Theodore Roosevelt]] believed that a US-controlled canal across Central America was a vital strategic interest of the country. This idea gained wide circulation after the destruction of the [[USS Maine (ACR-1)|USS ''Maine'']] in [[Cuba]] on February 15, 1898. Reversing a Walker Commission decision in favor of a Nicaraguan canal, Roosevelt encouraged the acquisition of the French Panama Canal effort. [[George S. Morison (engineer)|George S. Morison]] was the only commission member who argued for the Panama location. The purchase of the French-held land for $40&amp;nbsp;million was authorized by the June 28, 1902 [[Spooner Act]]. Since Panama was then part of [[Colombia]], Roosevelt began negotiating with that country to obtain the necessary rights. In early 1903 the [[Hay–Herrán Treaty]] was signed by both nations, but the [[Senate of Colombia]] failed to ratify the treaty.

Roosevelt implied to Panamanian rebels that if they revolted, the US Navy would assist their fight for independence. Panama declared its independence on November 3, 1903, and the [[USS Nashville (PG-7)|USS ''Nashville'']] impeded Colombian interference. The victorious Panamanians gave the United States control of the [[Panama Canal Zone]] on February 23, 1904, for $10&amp;nbsp;million in accordance with the November 18, 1903 [[Hay–Bunau-Varilla Treaty]].

The United States took control of the French property connected to the canal on May 4, 1904, when Lieutenant Jatara Oneel of the United States Army was presented with the keys during a small ceremony.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} The new Panama Canal Zone Control was overseen by the [[Isthmian Canal Commission]] (ICC) during construction.

The first step taken by the US government was to place all the canal workers under the new administration. The operation was maintained at minimum strength to comply with the canal concession and keep the machinery in working order. The US inherited a small workforce and an assortment of buildings, infrastructure and equipment, much of which had been neglected for fifteen years in the humid jungle environment. There were no facilities in place for a large workforce, and the infrastructure was crumbling.

Cataloguing assets was a large job; it took many weeks to card-index available equipment. About 2,150 buildings had been acquired,&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=M6JAAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA2598&amp;lpg=PA2598&amp;dq=2148+buildings+panama+canal&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=dFkpYoqYC_&amp;sig=_KnYM4ss4TsR3guH8eH1wZHerY8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1DQtVcS_C8WtyATiwoHACQ&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=2148%20buildings%20panama%20canal&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; many of which were uninhabitable; housing was an early problem, and the [[Panama Canal Railway|Panama Railway]] was in a state of decay. However, much equipment (such as locomotives, dredges&lt;ref&gt;French Belgian Built Ladder Dredge - http://www.czimages.com/CZMemories/ladderdredge/ladderdredge1.htm  accessed 7/19/2018&lt;/ref&gt; and other floating equipment) was still serviceable.

[[File:George W. Goethals cph.3a02121.jpg|thumb|160px|General [[George Washington Goethals]]]]
Although chief engineer [[John Findley Wallace]] was pressured to resume construction, [[red tape]] from Washington stifled his efforts to obtain heavy equipment and caused friction between Wallace and the ICC. He and chief sanitary officer [[William C. Gorgas]] were frustrated by delay, and Wallace resigned in 1905. He was replaced by [[John Frank Stevens]], who arrived on July 26, 1905. Stevens quickly realized that serious investment in infrastructure was necessary and determined to upgrade the railway, improve sanitation in [[Panama City]] and [[Colón, Panama|Colón]], renovate the old French buildings and build hundreds of new ones for housing. He then began the difficult task of recruiting the large labor force required for construction. Stevens' approach was to press ahead first and obtain approval later. He improved drilling and dirt-removal equipment at the Culebra Cut for greater efficiency, revising the inadequate provisions in place for soil disposal.

No decision had been made about whether the canal should be a [[Lock (canal)|lock]] or a sea-level one; the ongoing excavation would be useful in either case. In late 1905, President Roosevelt sent a team of engineers to Panama to investigate the relative merits of both types in cost and time. Although the engineers voted eight to five in favor of a sea-level canal, Stevens and the ICC opposed the plan; Stevens' report to Roosevelt was instrumental in convincing the president of the merits of a lock canal and Congress concurred. In November 1906 Roosevelt visited Panama to inspect the canal's progress, the first trip outside the United States by a sitting president.

Whether contract employees or government workers would build the canal was controversial. Bids for the canal's construction were opened in January 1907, and [[Knoxville, Tennessee]]-based contractor [[William J. Oliver (industrialist)|William J. Oliver]] was the low bidder.  Stevens disliked Oliver, and vehemently opposed his choice. Although Roosevelt initially favored the use of a contractor, he eventually decided that army engineers should carry out the work{{ref|DuVal}} and appointed Major [[George Washington Goethals]] as chief engineer (under Stevens' direction) in February 1907. Stevens, frustrated by government inaction and the army involvement, resigned and was replaced by Goethals.{{ref|Mellander}}

==={{anchor|The workforce}}Workforce===
The US relied on a stratified workforce to build the canal. High-level engineering jobs, clerical positions, skilled labor and jobs in supporting industries were generally reserved for white Americans, with manual labor primarily by cheap immigrant labor. These jobs were initially filled by Europeans, primarily from Spain, Italy and Greece, many of whom were radical and militant due to political turmoil in Europe. The US then decided to recruit primarily from the British and French West Indies, and these workers provided most of the manual labor on the canal.{{ref|Zieger}}

==={{anchor|Dealing with disease}}Living conditions===
{{Main article|Health measures during the construction of the Panama Canal}}
The Canal Zone originally had minimal facilities for entertainment and relaxation for the canal workers apart from saloons; as a result, alcohol abuse was a great problem. The inhospitable conditions resulted in many American workers returning home each year.

A program of improvements was implemented. Clubhouses were built, managed by the [[YMCA]], with billiard, assembly and reading rooms, bowling alleys, darkrooms for camera clubs, [[gymnastic]] equipment, ice cream parlors, soda fountains and a [[circulating library]]. Member dues were ten dollars a year, with the remaining upkeep (about $7,000 at the larger clubhouses) paid by the ICC. The commission built baseball fields and arranged rail transportation to games; a competitive league soon developed. Semimonthly Saturday-night dances were held at the Hotel Tivoli, which had a spacious ballroom.

These measures influenced life in the Canal Zone; alcohol abuse fell, with saloon business declining by 60 percent.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} The number of workers leaving the project each year dropped significantly.

[[File:Panama Canal under construction, 1907.jpg|200px|thumb|right|alt=Large excavation through mountains, seen from a rail tunnel|Culebra Cut in 1907]]
The work done thus far was preparation, rather than construction. By the time Goethals took over, the construction infrastructure had been created or overhauled and expanded from the French effort and he was soon able to begin construction in earnest.

Goethals divided the project into three divisions: Atlantic, Central and Pacific. The Atlantic Division, under Major [[William L. Sibert]], was responsible for construction of the [[Breakwater (structure)|breakwater]] at the entrance to [[Limon Bay]], the [[Gatún]] locks and their {{convert|5.6|km|mi|abbr=on}} approach channel, and the [[Gatun Dam]]. The Pacific Division (under Sydney B. Williamson, the only civilian division head) was responsible for the Pacific entrance to the canal, including a {{convert|4.8|km|mi|abbr=on}} breakwater in Panama Bay, the approach channel, and the [[Miraflores (Panama)|Miraflores]] and Pedro Miguel locks and their associated dams. The Central Division, under Major [[David du Bose Gaillard]], was responsible for everything in between. It had arguably the project's greatest challenge: excavating the [[Culebra Cut]] (known as the Gaillard Cut from 1915 to 2000), which involved cutting {{convert|8|mi|km}} through the [[continental divide]] down to 12 meters (40&amp;nbsp;ft) above sea level.

By August 1907, 765,000 m³ (1,000,000 cubic yards) per month was being excavated; this set a record for the rainy season; soon afterwards this doubled, before increasing again. At the peak of production, 2,300,000 m³ (3,000,000 cubic yards) were being excavated per month (the equivalent of digging a [[Channel Tunnel]] every 3½ months).{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

==={{anchor|The Culebra Cut (Gaillard Cut)}}Culebra Cut===
{{main|Culebra Cut}}
[[File:Panama-canal-shepherd-elevation.png|400px|thumb|right|alt=See caption|1923 diagram illustrating the elevations through which the canal cuts across the isthmus]]

One of the greatest barriers to a canal was the [[continental divide]], which originally rose to {{convert|110|m|ft|1}} above sea level at its highest point. The effort to cut through this barrier of rock was one of the greatest challenges faced by the project.

Goethals arrived at the canal with Major [[David du Bose Gaillard]] of the US Army Corps of Engineers. Gaillard was placed in charge of the canal's Central Division, which stretched from the Pedro Miguel locks to the [[Gatun Dam]], and dedicated himself to getting the Culebra Cut (as it was then known) excavated.

The scale of the work was massive. Six thousand men worked in the cut, drilling holes in which a total of {{convert|27000|t|lb|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} of [[dynamite]] were placed to break up the rock (which was then removed by as many as 160 trains per day). Landslides were frequent, due to the [[oxidation]] and weakening of the rock's underlying iron [[stratum|strata]]. Although the scale of the job and the frequent, unpredictable slides generated chaos, Gaillard provided quiet, clear-sighted leadership.

On May 20, 1913, [[Bucyrus-Erie|Bucyrus]] steam shovels made a passage through the Culebra Cut at the level of the canal bottom. The French effort had reduced the summit to  {{convert|59|m|ft|1}} over a relatively narrow width; the Americans had lowered this to  {{convert|12|m|ft|1}} above sea level over a greater width, and had excavated over {{convert|76000000|m3|cuyd|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} of material. About {{convert|23000000|m3|cuyd|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} of this material in addition to the planned excavation, in the form of landslides. Dry excavation ended on September 10, 1913; a January slide had added {{convert|1500000|m3|cuyd|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} of earth, but it was decided that this loose material would be removed by dredging when the cut was flooded.

==={{anchor|The dams}}Dams===
Two [[lake#Artificial lakes|artificial lakes]] are key parts of the canal: [[Gatun Lake|Gatun]] and Miraflores Lakes. Four dams were constructed to create them. Two small dams at Miraflores impound Miraflores Lake, and a dam at Pedro Miguel encloses the south end of the [[Culebra Cut]] (essentially an arm of Lake Gatun). The [[Gatun Dam]] is the main dam blocking the original course of the [[Chagres River]], creating Gatun Lake.

The Miraflores dams are an {{convert|825|m|ft|0|adj=on}} earth dam connecting the Miraflores Locks in the west and a {{convert|150|m|ft|0|adj=on}} concrete spillway dam east of the locks. The concrete dam has eight [[floodgate]]s, similar to those on the Gatun [[spillway]]. The earthen, {{convert|430|m|ft|0|adj=on}} Pedro Miguel dam extends from a hill in the west to the lock. Its face is protected by rock [[riprap]] at the water level. The largest and most challenging of the dams is the Gatun Dam. This [[earthen dam]], {{convert|640|m|ft|0}} thick at the base and {{convert|2300|m|ft|0}} long along the top, was the largest of its kind in the world when the canal opened.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

{{Main article|Panama Canal locks}}

The original lock canal plan called for a two-step set of locks at Sosa Hill and a long Sosa Lake extending to Pedro Miguel.&lt;ref&gt;Panama Canal Official Site - History - https://www.pancanal.com/eng/history/history/ select chapter Locks Design - accessed 7/19/2018&lt;/ref&gt;   In late 1907, it was decided to move the Sosa Hill locks further inland to Miraflores, mostly because the new site provided a more stable construction foundation. The resulting small lake Miraflores became a fresh water supply for Panama City.

Building the locks began with the first concrete laid at Gatun on August 24, 1909. The Gatun locks are built into a cutting into a hill bordering the lake, requiring the excavation of {{convert|3800000|m3|cuyd|0|abbr=on}} of material (mostly rock). The locks were made of {{convert|1564400|m3|cuyd|0|abbr=on}} of concrete, with an extensive system of electric railways and [[aerial lift]]s transporting concrete to the lock-construction sites.

The Pacific-side locks were finished first: the single flight at Pedro Miguel in 1911, and Miraflores in May 1913. The seagoing [[tugboat]] ''Gatun'', an Atlantic-entrance tug used to haul barges, traversed the Gatun locks on September 26, 1913. The trip was successful, although the valves were controlled manually; the central control board was not yet ready.

===Opening===
On October 10, 1913, the dike at Gamboa which had kept the Culebra Cut isolated from Gatun Lake was demolished; the detonation was made telegraphically by President [[Woodrow Wilson]] in Washington. On January 7, 1914, the ''Alexandre La Valley'',&lt;ref&gt;Official Site Panama Canal - History - https://www.pancanal.com/eng/history/history/  select chapter END OF THE CONSTRUCTION - accessed 7/19/2018 &lt;/ref&gt; an old French crane boat, became the first ship to make a complete transit of the Panama Canal under its own steam after working its way across during the final stages of construction.

As construction wound down, the canal team began to disperse. Thousands of workers were laid off, and entire towns were disassembled or demolished. Chief sanitary officer [[William C. Gorgas]], who left to fight pneumonia in the South African gold mines, became surgeon general of the Army. On April 1, 1914 the Isthmian Canal Commission disbanded, and the zone was governed by a Canal Zone Governor; the first governor was [[George Washington Goethals]].

Although a large celebration was planned for the canal's opening, the outbreak of [[World War I]] forced the cancellation of the main festivities and it became a modest local affair. The Panama Railway steamship {{SS|Ancon|1901|6}}, piloted by Captain John A. Constantine (the canal's first [[Maritime pilot|pilot]]), made the first official transit on August 15, 1914. With no international dignitaries in attendance, Goethals followed the ''Ancon''{{'s}} progress by railroad.

==={{anchor|Taking stock of the project}}Summary===
[[File:Panama canal image.jpg|thumb|200px|alt=Aerial photo through small clouds|[[International Space Station]] photo showing ''(right to left)'' the Miraflores locks, Miraflores Lake, the Pedro Miguel locks and the [[Centennial Bridge, Panama|Centennial Bridge]]]]
The canal was a technological marvel and an important strategic and economic asset to the US. It changed world shipping patterns, removing the need for ships to navigate the [[Drake Passage]] and [[Cape Horn]]. The canal saves a total of about {{convert|7800|mi|km}} on a sea trip from New York to San Francisco.

Its anticipated military significance of the canal was proven during [[World War II]], when the canal helped restore the devastated [[United States Pacific Fleet]].{{ref|Major}} Some of the largest ships the United States had to send through the canal were [[aircraft carrier]]s, particularly [[Essex class aircraft carrier|''Essex'' class]]; they were so large that although the locks could accommodate them, the lampposts along the canal had to be removed.

The Panama Canal cost the United States about $375 million, including $10 million paid to Panama and $40 million paid to the French company. Although it was the most expensive construction project in US history to that time, it cost about $23 million less than the 1907 estimate despite landslides and an increase in the canal's width. An additional $12 million was spent on fortifications.

A total of over 75,000 people worked on the project; at the peak of construction, there were 40,000 workers. According to hospital records, 5,609 workers died from disease and accidents during the American construction era.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

A total of {{convert|182610550|m3|cuyd|0|abbr=on}} of material was excavated in the American effort, including the approach channels at the canal ends. Adding the work by the French, the total excavation was about {{convert|204900000|m3|cuyd|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} (over 25 times the volume excavated in the [[Channel Tunnel]] project).{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Of the three presidents whose terms spanned the construction period, Theodore Roosevelt is most associated with the canal and Woodrow Wilson presided over its opening. However, [[William Howard Taft]] may have given the canal its greatest impetus for the longest time. Taft visited Panama five times as Roosevelt's secretary of war and twice as president. He hired John Stevens and later recommended Goethals as Stevens' replacement. Taft became president in 1909, when the canal was half finished, and was in office for most of the remainder of the work. However, Goethals later wrote: "The real builder of the Panama Canal was Theodore Roosevelt".{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

The following words by Roosevelt are displayed in the [[Rotunda (architecture)|rotunda]] of the canal's administration building in [[Balboa, Panama|Balboa]]:{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is not the critic who counts, not the man who points out how the strong man stumbled, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena; whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly, who errs and comes short again and again; who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions, and spends himself in a worthy cause; who, at the best, knows in the end the triumph of high achievement; and who, at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

David du Bose Gaillard died of a [[brain tumor]] in [[Baltimore]] on December 5, 1913, at age 54. Promoted to colonel only a month earlier, Gaillard never saw the opening of the canal whose creation he directed. The Culebra Cut (as it was originally known) was renamed the Gaillard Cut on April 27, 1915, in his honor. A plaque commemorating Gaillard's work stood over the cut for many years; in 1998 it was moved to the administration building, near a memorial to Goethals.

=={{anchor|The Third Locks Scheme (1939)}}Third-lane plans==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Panama Canal]] --&gt;
As the situation in Europe deteriorated during the late 1930s, the US again became concerned about its ability to move warships between the oceans. The largest US battleships already had problems with the canal locks, and there were concerns about the locks being incapacitated by bombing.{{ref|armthird}}{{ref|czthird}}

These concerns led Congress to pass a resolution on May 1, 1936, authorizing a study of improving the canal's defenses against attack and expanding its capacity to handle large vessels. A special engineering section was created on July 3, 1937, to carry out the study.
The section reported to Congress on February 24, 1939, recommending work to protect the existing locks and the construction of a new set of locks capable of carrying larger vessels than the existing locks could accommodate. On August 11, Congress authorized the work.

Three new locks were planned, at Gatún, Pedro Miguel and Miraflores, parallel to the existing locks with new approach channels. The new locks would add a traffic lane to the canal, with each chamber {{convert|1200|ft|m|2|abbr=on}} long, {{convert|140|ft|m|2|abbr=on}} wide and {{convert|45|ft|m|2|abbr=on}} deep. They would be {{convert|1/2|mi|m|0|abbr=on}} east of the existing Gatún locks and {{convert|1/4|mi|m|0|abbr=on}} west of the Pedro Miguel and Miraflores locks.

The first excavations for the new approach channels at Miraflores began on July 1, 1940, following the passage by Congress of an [[Appropriations bill (United States)|appropriations bill]] on June 24, 1940. The first dry excavation at Gatún began on February 19, 1941. Considerable material was excavated before the project was abandoned, and the approach channels can still be seen paralleling the original channels at Gatún and Miraflores.

In 2006, the Autoridad del Canal de Panamá (the [[Panama Canal Authority]], or ACP) proposed a plan creating a [[Panama Canal expansion project|third lane of locks]] using part of the abandoned 1940s approach canals. Following a [[referendum]], work began in 2007 and the expanded canal began commercial operations on June 26, 2016. After a two-year delay, the new locks allow the transit of [[Panamax]] ships (which have a greater cargo capacity than the original locks can handle). The first ship to cross the canal through the third set of locks was a Panamax [[container ship]], the Chinese-owned ''Cosco Shipping Panama''. The cost of the expansion was estimated at $5.25 billion.&lt;ref name=NYT062016&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2016/06/26/world/americas/ap-lt-panama-canal-expansion.html?ref=world&amp;_r=0 | title=Panama Canal Opens $5B Locks, Bullish Despite Shipping Woes | author=[[The Associated Press]] | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=2016-06-26 | accessdate=2016-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After construction, the canal and the [[Panama Canal Zone|Canal Zone]] surrounding it were administered by the United States. On September 7, 1977, US President [[Jimmy Carter]] signed the [[Torrijos-Carter Treaties|Torrijos-Carter Treaty]] setting in motion the process of transferring control of the canal to Panama. The treaty became effective on October 1, 1979, providing for a 20-year period in which Panama would have increasing responsibility for canal operations before complete US withdrawal on December 31, 1999. Since then, the canal has been administered by the [[Panama Canal Authority]] (Autoridad de Canal de Panama, or ACP).

The treaty was controversial in the US, and its passage was difficult. The controversy was largely generated by contracts to manage two ports, at either end of the canal, which were awarded by Panama to Hong Kong-based conglomerate [[Hutchison Whampoa]]. According to US [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]], the company has close ties to the Chinese government and the Chinese military.{{ref|consusa}} However, the [[United States Department of State]] said that it found no evidence of connections between Hutchison Whampoa and Beijing.{{ref|cnn}} Some Americans were wary of placing the strategic waterway under the protection of Panamanian security forces.{{ref|consusa2}}

[[File:Jimmy Carter and General Omar Torrijos signing the Panama Canal Treaty.jpg|thumb|left|alt=See caption|[[Jimmy Carter]] and [[Omar Torrijos]] shake hands moments after the signing of the [[Torrijos–Carter Treaties]].]]
Although concerns existed in the US and the shipping industry about the canal after the transfer, [[Panama]] has exercised good stewardship.{{ref|panadmin}} According to ACP figures, canal income increased from $769&amp;nbsp;million in 2000 (the first year under Panamanian control) to $1.4&amp;nbsp;billion in 2006.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} Traffic through the canal increased from 230 million tons in 2000 to nearly 300&amp;nbsp;million tons in 2006. The number of accidents has decreased from an average of 28 per year in the late 1990s to 12 in 2005. Transit time through the canal averages about 30 hours, about the same as during the late 1990s. Canal expenses have increased less than revenue, from $427&amp;nbsp;million in 2000 to $497&amp;nbsp;million in 2006. On October 22, 2006, Panamanian citizens approved a [[Panama Canal expansion referendum, 2006|referendum]] to [[Panama Canal expansion project|expand]] the canal.

Former US Ambassador to Panama Linda Watt, who served from 2002 to 2005, said that the canal operation in Panamanian hands has been "outstanding". "The international shipping community is quite pleased", Watt added.{{ref|panadmin}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6018">'''IEEE 1547''' (''Standard for Interconnecting Distributed Resources with Electric Power Systems'') is a standard of the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] meant to provide a set of criteria and requirements for the interconnection of [[distributed generation]] resources into the [[power grid]].

==Purpose==
&lt;blockquote&gt;"This document provides a uniform standard for interconnection of distributed resources with EPSs [Electric Power Systems]. It provides requirements relevant to the performance, operation, testing, safety, and maintenance of the interconnection."&lt;ref name=IEEE&gt;{{cite web
  | author = Vaughn
  | title = IEEE SCC21 1547 Home Page
  | publisher = IEEE
  | url = http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/scc21/1547/1547_index.html
  | date =  2007-12-21
  | accessdate = 2008-01-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

With the increased adoption of distributed resources in the present and future, a set of standards regarding their usage in the grid becomes increasingly important for the overall reliability, safety, and cost. Furthermore, the lack of a concrete national standard was seen as a roadblock to the implementation of new distributed generation projects. The standard is intended to be universally adoptable, technology-neutral, and cover distributed resources as large 10 [[Volt-ampere|MVA]].

==Development==
In early 1999, the IEEE approved the undertaking of P1547.  With the support of the [[United States Department of Energy]], the project was initiated on a fast-track basis, which would halve the usual development time. The draft standard was revised 10 times before P1547/Draft 11 was approved with a 91% vote in February 2003. It was then approved by the IEEE Standards Board on June 12, 2003, and received an [[ANSI]] designation on October 20, 2003.&lt;ref name=DE&gt;{{cite web

==Risk of System Disturbance==
IEEE 1547-2003 has a tight underfrequency protection setting of 59.3&amp;nbsp;Hz which poses a risk for grid stability. In case of an underfrequency situation,&lt;ref name=UCTE&gt;{{cite web

Please compare with Chapter 6.3.5 and 6.4.1: "For instance, due to its significant penetration level, the effect of the distributed generation may no longer be neglected and appropriate technical requirements need to be defined." p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; 
e.g. after a major loss of generation, the situation may get worse when a multitude of [[distributed generation|distributed energy resources]] (DER) disconnect simultaneously. IEEE 1547-2003 demands also an obligatory overfrequency disconnection at 60.5&amp;nbsp;Hz. With a rising share of distributed generation there is a possibility of triggering a non-linear [[oscillator]] in the multi [[Watt#Gigawatt|GW]] range within the transmission grid. In Europe, this problem with similar standards has already been addressed by [[ENTSO-E]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.entsoe.eu/fileadmin/user_upload/_library/publications/ce/110718_DD_to_COett_pv_final.pdf Letter, 18 July 2011] from Mr. Dobbeni, President of ENTSO-E to Mr Oettinger, European Commissioner for Energy&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Impella''' is a family of medical devices used for temporary [[ventricular assist device|ventricular support device]] in people with depressed heart function. Some versions of the device can provide right heart support during other forms of mechanical circulatory support including [[ECMO]] and [[Centrimag]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shishehbor|first1=MH|last2=Moazami|first2=N|last3=Tong|first3=MZ|last4=Unai|first4=S|last5=Tang|first5=WH|last6=Soltesz|first6=EG|title=Cardiogenic shock: From ECMO to Impella and beyond.|journal=Cleveland Clinic journal of medicine|date=April 2017|volume=84|issue=4|pages=287–295|pmid=28388392|doi=10.3949/ccjm.84gr.17002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The device is approved for use in high-risk [[percutaneous coronary intervention]] (PCI) and cardiogenic shock following a heart attack or an open heart surgery procedure. It is placed into the heart through a peripheral artery.&lt;ref&gt;Bansal A, Bhama JK, Patel R, et al.

== Medical uses ==
It results in similar results to veno-arterial [[extracorporeal life support]] and TandemHeart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ouweneel|first1=DM|last2=Schotborgh|first2=JV|last3=Limpens|first3=J|last4=Sjauw|first4=KD|last5=Engström|first5=AE|last6=Lagrand|first6=WK|last7=Cherpanath|first7=TG|last8=Driessen|first8=AH|last9=de Mol|first9=BA|last10=Henriques|first10=JP|title=Extracorporeal life support during cardiac arrest and cardiogenic shock: a systematic review and meta-analysis.|journal=Intensive Care Medicine|date=December 2016|volume=42|issue=12|pages=1922–1934|pmid=27647331|doi=10.1007/s00134-016-4536-8|pmc=5106498}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technology ==
Impella heart pumps are percutaneous microaxial pumps that act as mechanical circulatory support (MCS) devices in patients in need of hemodynamic support. The pumps are mounted on a 9 Fr support catheter. The pumps are inserted by a physician typically through femoral artery access, although axillary and subclavian artery approaches are not uncommon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tayal | first1 = R | last2 = Barvalia | first2 = M | last3 = Rana | first3 = Z | display-authors = 3 | last4 = et al | year = 2016 | title = Totally percutaneous insertion and removal of Impella device using axillary artery in the setting of advanced peripheral artery disease | url = | journal = Journal of Invasive Cardiology | volume = 28 | issue = 9| pages = 374–380 | pmid = 27430667 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Left-sided support ==
The Impella heart pumps are designed to provide hemodynamic support when the patient's heart is unable to produce sufficient cardiac output. The Impella family of heart pumps can supply 1.0 L/min-5.0 L/min of blood flow, depending on the size and power setting of the individual pump.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abiomed.com/impella|title=Impella|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The physiological consequences of left-sided support are threefold. First, it unloads the left ventricle by reducing left ventricular end-diastolic volume and pressure, which decreases ventricular wall stress. Subsequently, left ventricular work and myocardial oxygen demand decrease.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sauren | first1 = LD | last2 = Accord | first2 = RE | last3 = Hamzeh | first3 = K | display-authors = 3 | last4 = et al | year = 2007 | title = "Combined Impella and intra-aortic balloon pump support to improve both ventricular unloading and coronary blood flow for myocardial recovery " an experimental study | url = | journal = Artificial Organs | volume = 31 | issue = 11| pages = 839–842 | doi = 10.1111/j.1525-1594.2007.00477.x | pmid = 18001394 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Seyfarth | first1 = M | last2 = Sibbing | first2 = D | last3 = Bauer | first3 = I | display-authors = 3 | last4 = et al | year = 2008 | title = A randomized clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a percutaneous left ventricular assist device versus intra-aortic balloon pumping for treatment of cardiogenic shock caused by myocardial infarction | url = | journal = Journal of the American College of Cardiology | volume = 52 | issue = 19| pages = 1584–1588 | doi = 10.1016/j.jacc.2008.05.065 | pmid = 19007597 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kawashima | first1 = D | last2 = Gojo | first2 = S | last3 = Nishimura | first3 = T | display-authors = 3 | last4 = et al | year = 2011 | title = Left ventricular mechanical support with Impella provides more ventricular unloading in heart failure than extracorporeal membrane oxygenation | url = | journal = ASAIO Journal (American Society for Artificial Internal Organs) | volume = 57 | issue = 3| pages = 169–176 | doi = 10.1097/MAT.0b013e31820e121c | pmid = 21317769 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Meyns | first1 = B | last2 = Stolinski | first2 = J | last3 = Leunens | first3 = V | last4 = Verbeken | first4 = E | last5 = Flameng | first5 = W | year = 2003 | title = Left ventricular support by catheter-mounted axial flow pump reduces infarct size | url = | journal = Journal of the American College of Cardiology | volume = 41 | issue = 7| pages = 1087–1095 | doi = 10.1016/S0735-1097(03)00084-6 | pmid = 12679206 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Second, Impella pump flow increases [[mean arterial pressure]], [[Blood pressure|diastolic pressure]], and [[cardiac output]].

In the study of [[mechanical network]]s in [[control theory]], an '''inerter''' is a two-terminal device in which the forces applied at the terminals are equal, opposite, and proportional to relative acceleration between the nodes. Under the name of '''J-damper''' the concept has been used in [[Formula 1]] [[racing car]] suspension systems.

It can be constructed with a flywheel mounted on a [[rack and pinion]]. It has a similar effect to increasing the inertia of the sprung object.

==Discovery==
[[Malcolm C. Smith]], a [[control theory|control]] [[engineering]] professor at the [[University of Cambridge]], first introduced inerters in a 2002 paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Smith | first1 = M. C. | title = Synthesis of mechanical networks: The inerter | doi = 10.1109/TAC.2002.803532 | journal = IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control | volume = 47 | issue = 10 | pages = 1648 | year = 2002 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith extended the analogy between [[electrical network|electrical]] and [[mechanical network]]s (the [[mobility analogy]]). He observed that the analogy was incomplete, since it was missing a mechanical device playing the same role as an electrical [[capacitor]]. It was found that it is possible to construct such a device using gears and flywheels.

The generated strength satisfies the equation
: &lt;math&gt;F=b(\dot{v}_2-\dot{v}_1)&lt;/math&gt;,
for a suitable constant ''b''.

==Construction==
A linear inerter can be constructed by meshing a [[flywheel]] with a [[rack gear]].  The pivot of the flywheel forms one terminal of the device, and the rack gear forms the other.

A rotational inerter can be constructed by meshing a flywheel with the ring gear of a [[differential (mechanical device)|differential]].  The side gears of the differential form the two terminals.

==Applications==
Shortly after its discovery, the inerter principle was used under the name of '''J-damper''' in the suspension systems of [[Formula 1]] [[racing car]]s. When tuned to the natural oscillation frequencies of the tires, the inerter reduced the mechanical load on the suspension. [[McLaren Mercedes]] began using a J-damper in early 2005, and [[Renault]] shortly thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Chen | first1 = M. | last2 = Papageorgiou | first2 = C. | last3 = Scheibe | first3 = F. | last4 = Wang | first4 = F.

J-dampers were at the center of the [[2007 Formula One espionage controversy]] which arose when Phil Mackereth left McLaren for Renault.

[[File:Ingersoll-Rand Class AA-2 air compressor cross section 1910.png|thumb|upright=1.5|The intercooler (top) of this 1910 [[Ingersoll Rand]] [[air compressor]] extracts [[waste heat]] between the two compressor stages.]]
An '''intercooler''' is any [[Machine|mechanical device]] used to [[:wikt:cooling|cool]] a [[fluid]], including [[liquid]]s or [[gas]]es, between stages of a multi-stage compression process, typically a [[heat exchanger]] that removes [[waste heat]] in a [[gas compressor]].&lt;ref name=DicDef/&gt; They are used in many ways, including [[air compressor]]s, [[air conditioner]]s, [[refrigeration]], and [[gas turbine]]s, and [[Automobile|automotive]] engines. Here they are widely known as an air-to-air or air-to-liquid cooler for [[forced induction]] ([[Turbocharger|turbocharged]] or [[Supercharger|supercharged]]) [[internal combustion engine]]s to improve their [[volumetric efficiency]], which they do by increasing [[intake]] air density through nearly [[Isobaric process|constant pressure]] cooling.

== Air Compressors ==
Intercoolers are utilized to remove the waste heat from the first stage of two-stage air compressors.  Two-stage air compressors are manufactured because of their inherent efficiency.  The cooling action of the intercooler is principally responsible for this higher efficiency, bringing it closer to Carnot efficiency.  Removing the heat-of-compression from the discharge of the first stage has the effect of densifying the air charge.  This, in turn, allows the second stage to produce more work from its fixed compression ratio. Adding an intercooler to the setup requires additional investments. 
[[File:Inter_Cooler.jpg|thumb|Two-stage compressor pump showing the location of the intercooler.]]

==Internal combustion engines==
Intercoolers increase the efficiency of the induction system by reducing induction air heat created by the supercharger or turbocharger and promoting more thorough combustion. This removes the [[heat of compression]] (i.e., the temperature rise) that occurs in any gas when its pressure is raised (i.e. its unit mass per unit volume - [[density]] - is increased).

A decrease in intake air charge temperature sustains use of a more dense intake charge into the engine, as a result of [[forced induction]]. The lowering of the intake charge air temperature also eliminates the danger of pre-detonation (knock) of the fuel/air charge prior to timed [[Ignition system|spark ignition]]. This preserves the benefits of more fuel/air burn per engine cycle, increasing the output of the engine.

Intercoolers also eliminate the need for using the wasteful method of lowering intake charge temperature by the injection of excess fuel into the cylinders' air induction chambers, to cool the intake air charge, prior to its flowing into the cylinders. This wasteful practice (before intercoolers were used) nearly eliminated the gain in engine efficiency from forced induction, but was necessitated by the greater need to prevent at all costs the engine damage that pre-detonation engine knocking causes.&lt;ref name="DW Performace"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dwperformance.com/sport-compact-performance.aspx |title=Garrett Turbochargers - Performance Parts and Accessories - D&amp;W Performance |publisher=Dwperformance.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''inter'' prefix in the device name originates from its use as a cooler in between compression cycles.  Typically in automobiles the intercooler is placed between the turbocharger (or supercharger) and the engine (the piston compression produces the next compression cycle). Aircraft engines are sometimes built with charge air coolers that were installed between multiple stages of forced induction,{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} thus the designation of ''inter''. In a vehicle fitted with [[twin turbo|two-stage turbocharging]], it is possible to have both an intercooler (between the two turbocharger units) and an aftercooler (between the second-stage turbo and the engine). The [[JCB Dieselmax]] land speed record-holding car is an example of such a system. In general, an intercooler or aftercooler is said to be a charge-air cooler.

Intercoolers can vary dramatically in size, shape and design, depending on the performance and space requirements of the entire supercharger system. Common spatial designs are front mounted intercoolers ('''FMIC'''), top mounted intercoolers ('''TMIC''') and hybrid mount intercoolers (HMIC). Each type can be cooled with an air-to-air system, air-to-liquid system, or a combination of both.

===Applications to forced induction===

[[File:Ic-extrior.jpg|thumb|right|Exterior of the same intercooler core.]]
[[Turbocharger]]s and [[supercharger]]s are engineered to force more air mass (and thus more oxygen molecules) into an engine's [[intake manifold]] and combustion chamber. Intercooling is a method used to compensate for heating caused by supercharging, a natural byproduct of the semi-[[adiabatic]] compression process. Increased air pressure can result in an excessively hot intake charge, significantly reducing the performance gains of supercharging due to decreased [[density]]. Increased intake charge temperature can also increase the cylinder combustion temperature, causing [[Engine knocking|detonation]], excessive wear, or heat damage to an [[engine block]] or pistons.

Passing a compressed and heated intake charge through an intercooler reduces its temperature (due to heat rejection) and pressure (due to flow restriction of fins). If the device is properly engineered, the relative decrease in temperature is greater than the relative loss in pressure, resulting in a net increase in density. This increases system performance by recovering some losses of the inefficient compression process by rejecting heat to the atmosphere. Additional cooling can be provided by externally spraying a fine mist onto the intercooler surface, or even into the [[Water injection (engines)|intake air itself]], to further reduce intake charge temperature through [[evaporative cooling]].

Intercoolers that exchange their heat directly with the atmosphere are designed to be mounted in areas of an automobile with maximum air flow. These types are mainly mounted in front mounted systems (FMIC). Cars such as the [[Nissan Skyline]], [[Saab Automobile|Saab]], [[Volvo 200 Series]] Turbo, [[Volvo 700 Series]] (and 900 series) turbo, [[Dodge SRT-4]], 1st gen [[Mazda MX-6]], [[Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution]] and [[Chevrolet Cobalt SS]] all use front mounted intercooler(s) mounted near the front bumper, in line with the car's radiator.

Many other turbo-charged cars, particularly where the aesthetics of the car are not to be compromised by top mount scoops, such as the [[Toyota Supra]] (JZA80 only), Nissan 300ZX Twin Turbo, [[Nissan Silvia]] (S13/14/14a/15), [[Nissan 180sx]], [[Mitsubishi 3000gt]], [[Saab 900]], [[Volkswagen]], [[Fiat]] Turbo diesels, [[Audi TT]], and Turbo [[Mitsubishi Eclipse]] use side-mounted air-to-air intercoolers (SMIC), which are mounted in the front corner of the bumper or in front of one of the wheels. Side-mounted intercoolers are generally smaller, mainly due to space constraints, and sometimes two are used to gain the performance of a larger, single intercooler. Cars such as the [[Subaru Impreza WRX]], [[BMW MINI|MINI Cooper S]], [[Toyota Celica GT-Four]], [[Nissan Pulsar GTI-R]], [[Acura RDX]], [[Mazdaspeed3]], [[Mazdaspeed6]], and the [[PSA Peugeot Citroën]] turbo diesels, use air-to-air top mounted intercoolers (TMIC) located on top of the engine. Air is directed through the intercooler through the use of a [[hood scoop]]. In the case of the PSA cars, the air flows through the grille above the front bumper, then through under-hood ducting. Top mounted intercoolers sometimes suffer from heat diffusion due to proximity with the engine, warming them and reducing their overall efficiency. Some [[World Rally Championship]] cars use a reverse-induction system design whereby air is forced through ducts in the front bumper to a horizontally mounted intercooler.

[[File:Sti-fmic.jpg|thumb|Fitting an [[aftermarket (automotive)|after market]] front mount intercooler to a car with a factory installed top mount.]]

Because FMIC systems require open bumper design for optimal performance, the entire system is vulnerable to debris. Some engineers choose other mount locations due to this reliability concern. FMICs can be located in front of or behind the radiator, depending on the heat dissipation needs of the engine.

As well as allowing a greater mass of air to be admitted to an engine, intercoolers have a key role in controlling the internal temperatures in a turbocharged engine. When fitted with a turbo (as with any form of supercharging), the engine's [[power density|specific power]] is increased, leading to higher combustion and exhaust temperatures. The exhaust gases passing through the turbine section of the turbocharger are usually around 450&amp;nbsp;°C (840&amp;nbsp;°F), but can be as high as 1000&amp;nbsp;°C (1830&amp;nbsp;°F) under extreme conditions. This heat passes through the turbocharger unit and contributes to the heating of the air being compressed in the compressor section of the turbo. If left uncooled, this hot air enters the engine, further increasing internal temperatures. This leads to a build-up of heat that will eventually stabilise, but this may be at temperatures in excess of the engine's design limits- 'hot spots' at the [[piston]] crown or exhaust valve can cause warping or cracking of these components. High air charge temperatures will also increase the possibility of pre-ignition or detonation. Detonation causes damaging pressure spikes in the engine's cylinders, which can quickly damage an engine. These effects are especially found in modified or tuned engines running at very high specific power outputs. An efficient intercooler removes heat from the air in the induction system, preventing the cyclic heat build-up via the turbocharger, allowing higher power outputs to be achieved without damage.

Compression by the turbocharger causes the intake air to heat up and heat is added due to compressor inefficiencies (adiabatic efficiency). This is actually the greater cause of the increase in air temperature in an air charge. The extra power obtained from forced induction is due to the extra air available to burn more fuel in each cylinder. This sometimes requires a lower [[compression ratio]] be used, to allow a wider mapping of ignition timing advance before detonation occurs (for a given fuel's octane rating). On the other hand, a lower compression ratio generally lowers combustion efficiency and costs power.

Some high performance tuning companies measure the temperature before and after the intercooler to ensure the output temperature is as close to ambient as possible (without additional cooling; water/liquid gas spray kits).

===Air-to-liquid intercoolers===
[[File:Airtowaterintercooler.jpg|thumb|A custom-built air-to-water intercooler, as used in a [[time attack]] car.]]
[[File:2014 Washington Auto Show (12140974934).jpg|thumb|[[BMW S55|S55 engine]] in a 2014 [[BMW M3]]; the cuboid-shaped metal component is the air-to-liquid charge air cooler.]]
Air-to-liquid intercoolers, also known as '''Charge Air Coolers''', are [[heat exchanger]]s that transfer intake charge heat to an intermediate fluid, usually water, which finally rejects heat to the air. These systems use radiators in other locations, usually due to space constraints, to reject unwanted heat, similar to an automotive radiator cooling system. Air-to-liquid intercoolers are usually heavier than their air-to-air counterparts due to additional components making up the system (water circulation pump, radiator, fluid, and plumbing). The [[Toyota Celica GT-Four]] had this system from 1988 to 1989, 1994 to 1999, also in the [[Carlos Sainz]] Rally Championship Version from 1990 to 1993. The 1989-1993 [[Subaru Legacy (first generation)#Engines|Subaru Legacy]] with the 2.0 L DOHC flat-4 engine also used a top installed air-to-water intercooler on the GT and RS models sold in Japan, Europe, and Australia.

A big advantage of the air-to-liquid setup is the lower overall pipe and intercooler length, which offers faster response (lowers turbo lag) {{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}, giving peak boost faster than most front-mount intercooler setups. Some setups have reservoirs that can hold ice, producing intake temperatures lower than ambient air, giving a big advantage (but of course, ice would need constant replacement).

Ford had adopted the technology when they decided to use forced induction (via Supercharger) on their [[Mustang Cobra]] and [[Ford Lightning]] truck platforms. It uses a water/glycol mixture intercooler inside the intake manifold, just under the supercharger, and has a long heat exchanger front mounted, all powered by a Bosch pump made for Ford. Ford still uses this technology today with their [[Shelby GT500]]. The 2005-2007 Chevrolet Cobalt SS Supercharged also utilizes a similar setup.

Air-to-liquid intercoolers are by far the most common form of intercooler found on marine engines, given that a limitless supply of cooling water is available and most engines are located in closed compartments where obtaining a good flow of cooling air for an air-to-air unit would be difficult. Marine intercoolers take the form of a tubular [[heat exchanger]] with the air passing through a series of tubes and cooling water circulating around the tubes within the unit's casing. The source of water for the intercooler depends on the exact cooling system fitted to the engine. Most marine engines have [[fresh water]] circulating within them which is passed through a heat exchanger cooled by [[sea water]]. In such a system, the intercooler will be attached to the sea water circuit and placed before the engine's own heat exchanger to ensure a supply of cool water.

===Charge air cooler===
{{Rewrite section|date=December 2016}}
A '''charge air cooler''' is used to cool engine air after it has passed through a [[turbocharger]], but before it enters the engine. The idea is to return the air to a lower temperature, for the optimum power for the combustion process within the engine.

[[File:Air Coolers-01.jpg|4-stroke diesel engine coolers|left|thumb]]Charge air coolers range in size depending on the engine. The smallest are most often referred to as intercoolers and are attached to [[automobile]] engines or truck engines. The largest are reserved for use on huge marine [[diesel engine]]s, and can weigh over 2 tonnes (see picture).

Marine diesel engine charge-air coolers are still manufactured in Europe, despite the very largest engines mostly being built in the Far East. [[Vestas aircoil A/S]] and GEA are the oldest makers still in business.

The first marine diesel engine charge air cooler was built by [[Vestas aircoil A/S]] in 1956.

There is some confusion in terminology between aftercooler, intercooler, and charge-air cooler. In the past, aircraft engines would run turbochargers in stages, where the first stage compressor would feed the inlet of the second stage compressor that would further compress the air before it enters the engine. Due to the extremely high pressures that would develop, an air cooler was positioned between the first and second stage compressors. That cooler was the "Intercooler".

Another cooler would be positioned after the second stage, which was the final compressor stage, and that was the "aftercooler". An aftercooler was the cooler whose outlet fed the engine.

[[File:Motorprincipper.jpg|thumb|Location of cooler on large diesel engine]]A charge-air cooler is simply an all-encompassing term, meaning that it cools the turbo's air charge before it is routed into the engine. Usually a charge-air cooler means an air-to-air cooler where the heat is rejected using ambient air flowing through the heat exchanger, much like the engine's coolant radiator. While the multi-stage turbocharger systems are still in use in some tractor pull classes, selected high-performance diesels, and are also being used on newer late model commercial diesels, the term intercooler and aftercooler are used synonymously today. The term intercooler is widely used to mean in-between the Turbocharger and the engine. Both terms, intercooler or aftercooler, are correct, but this is the origin of the two terms that are used interchangeably by all levels of experts.

An intercooler, or "Charge-Air Cooler", is an air-to-air or air-to-liquid heat exchange device used on turbocharged and supercharged (forced induction) internal combustion engines to improve their volumetric efficiency by increasing intake air-charge density through isochoric cooling. A decrease in air intake temperature provides a denser intake charge to the engine and allows more air and fuel to be combusted per engine cycle, increasing the output of the engine.

The inter prefix in the device name originates from historic compressor designs. In the past, aircraft engines were built with Charge-Air Coolers that were installed between multiple stages of supercharging, thus the designation of inter. Modern automobile designs are technically designated aftercoolers because of their placement at the end of supercharging chain. This term is now considered archaic in modern automobile terminology since most forced induction vehicles have single-stage superchargers or turbochargers. In a vehicle fitted with two-stage turbocharging, it is possible to have both an intercooler (between the two turbocharger units) and an aftercooler (between the second-stage turbo and the engine). In general, an intercooler or aftercooler is said to be a Charge-Air Cooler. [http://www.avtekk.com Text taken from Av-Tekk Charge-Air Coolers website]

==History==
ip.access was founded in December 1999&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ttp.com/corporate/about/ |title= About TTP |publisher= TTP Group |accessdate= June 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a wholly owned [[subsidiary]] of TTP Group PLC&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ttpgroup.com/about/TTP TTP Group PLC]&lt;/ref&gt; aimed at developing technologies that would allow multiple radio access technologies to communicate over the Internet. To accommodate its growing staff, in 2006 ip.access relocated to new offices in Cambourne Business Park, Cambridge, where it remains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press |url=http://www.ipaccess.com/content/news/press.php?id=20 |title=ip.access Moves to New Offices to Support Growth |publisher= ip.access| accessdate= June 3, 2011 | date=September 15, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2000, TTP Group spun off its communications division (TTP Communications, or TTPCom) in an [[initial public offering]] on the [[London Stock Exchange]], and ip.access joined the spin-off as a wholly owned subsidiary of the TTPCom group.

In March 2006, the company secured an £8.5 million round of funding from [[Intel Capital]], Scottish Equity Partners, and [[Rothschild &amp; Cie Banque]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press |url= http://www.ipaccess.com/content/news/press.php?id=27 |title=ip.access Secures £8.5 million Funding to Accelerate Growth in Cost-Effective Cellular Infrastructure for Homes and Businesses |publisher= ip.access| accessdate= June 3, 2011 | date=March 13, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of its June 2006 acquisition of TTP Communications, [[Motorola]] also gained a stake in ip.access.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/06/07/motorola_buys_ttpcom/ Motorola gobbles up TTPcom], ''The Register'', June 7, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, after signing an OEM agreement with ip.access, [[ADC Telecommunications|ADC]]&lt;ref&gt;Cheung, Ken.

'''Catherine Anselm Gleason''' (November 25, 1865 – January 9, 1933) was an [[Americans|American]] engineer and businesswoman known both for being an accomplished woman in the predominantly male field of [[engineering]] and for her [[philanthropy]].

==Early life and Gleason Works==
Catherine Anselm Gleason was born the first of four children of William and Ellen McDermott Gleason of [[Rochester, New York]], émigrés from [[Ireland]]. Her father was the owner of a [[machine tool]] company, later named [[Gleason Corporation|Gleason Works]], which later became one of the most important makers of [[gear cutting|gear-cutting]] machine tools in the world. When she was 11, her stepbrother Tom died of typhoid fever, causing hardship at her father's company because Tom had been an important helper. At the age of 12 she began working for her father to fill the void left by Tom's death. In 1884, she was the first woman to be admitted to study engineering at [[Cornell University]] in [[Ithaca, NY]] {{Disputed inline|date=March 2017}}, although she was unable to complete her studies at Cornell due to her required presence in the factory. She continued her studies upon returning to Rochester at the Mechanics Institute, later renamed [[Rochester Institute of Technology]].&lt;ref name="notable_rit_alumni"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://campuslife.rit.edu/thesource/content.php?id=157&amp;sec=Your%20RIT |title=The Source 2005-2006 |author=Rochester Institute of Technology |accessdate=2008-01-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901132718/http://campuslife.rit.edu/thesource/content.php?id=157&amp;sec=Your+RIT |archivedate=September 1, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was actively involved as the treasurer as well as saleswoman for Gleason Works. In 1893, she toured Europe to expand the company's business, one of the first times an American manufacturer tried to globalize their business. Today, international sales make up almost 3/4 of the company's business.&lt;ref name="RES"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Bailey | first = Margaret B. |date=January 2008 | title = Kate Gleason: The Ideal Business Woman | journal = The Rochester Engineer | volume = 86 | issue = 6 | pages = 8–9 | publisher = Rochester Engineering Society | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:KateGleasonMemorialEastRochesterNewYork.JPG|thumb|left|Memorial in [[East Rochester, New York]]]]
[[Fred H. Colvin]] described Kate Gleason in his memoirs as "a kind of Madame Curie of machine tools […] Kate spent her youth learning her father's business from the ground up, both in the shop and in the field, so that when she branched out for herself about 1895 as a saleswoman for her father's gear-cutting machines, she knew as much as any man in the business."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Colvin|1947|p=73}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ellen Gleason was a friend of fellow Rochesterian [[Susan B. Anthony]], and Kate Gleason later cited Anthony as a source of advice. Gleason undertook several efforts supporting [[Women's Suffrage]] after Anthony's death.

==Life after leaving the Gleason Works==
Due to conflicts with her family she left Gleason Works in 1913 and found work at the Ingle Machining Company.She Joined Ingle Machine Company on the 1st of January 1914. She was appointed the receiver of bankruptcy for the company, the first women to ever do so. Under her guidance she restored the company and repaid their outstanding debts. The company was returned to the stockholders before the end of 1915.After her endeavors with Ingle Machine Company she turned her attention to [[East Rochester, New York|East Rochester]] where she helped to finance and build 8 factories for various companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kate Gleason|url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/Kate-Gleason|website=Britannica|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1914, she was the first woman elected to full membership in the [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]] and represented the society at the World Power Conference in [[Germany]]. In 1918, she was appointed the president of First National Bank of East Rochester&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Woman Bank Head in East Rochester|journal=The Post Express|date=August 19, 1918|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the previous President was enlisted in [[World War I]]. During this period she took charge of a problem loan and used it to finish the housing complexes left from the previous loan holder. She used this to further her humanitarian efforts in Rochester, starting eight companies, including a construction company that built houses for the middle class. After this success she took it upon herself to experiment with concrete to build cheap fireproof houses at an affordable cost using a pouring method she developed. After this success she described her methods in an article she wrote for a trade magazine, Concrete, in 1921 titled "How Women Builds Houses to Sell at a Profit for $4000". Later, she left Rochester for business opportunities in [[South Carolina]] and [[California]].&lt;ref name="RES"/&gt; In the 1920s she rebuilt a castle in Septmonts [[France]] for herself. As well as helping the surrounding towns to recover from the damage left from the world war. During this time period she also toured California to study adobe buildings. In 1924, she was asked by Berkeley, California to help them rebuild after a fire. In the late 1920s she began to build more poured concrete buildings&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weingart|first1=Richard|title=Engineering Legends: Great American Civil Engineers|journal=Engineering Legends: Great American Civil Engineers|date=2005|pages=108-108}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Sausalito, California]], but she ran into some more issues and the project was not as successful as her buildings in Rochester. Then at her winter home in Beaufort,South Carolina she had plans to make a community of garden apartments for artists and writers but only 10 of these homes were completed at the time of her death.

==Personal life==
Gleason was a supporter of [[women's suffrage]]. According to an account of 1912 National America Woman Suffrage Association Convention mentions Gleason as having promised $1,200 to the suffrage movement, one of its largest pledges. Many of Kate Gleason's personal writings testify to her and her father's contributions to women's suffrage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Berman|first1=Milton|title=Gleason, Kate (1865-1933), businesswoman|url=http://www.anb.org/view/10.1093/anb/9780198606697.001.0001/anb-9780198606697-e-1000637|website=American National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press.|accessdate=November 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Gleason viewed marriage as a hindrance to her professional life and she never married nor had children.&lt;ref name="RES"/&gt;

==Death and legacy==
[[File:KateGleasonGravestone.JPG|thumb|Gravestone in [[Riverside Cemetery (Rochester, New York)|Riverside Cemetery]]]]
She died January 9, 1933 of pneumonia and is interred in Riverside Cemetery in Rochester. She left much of her $1.4 million estate to institutions in the Rochester area, including libraries, parks, and the [[Rochester Institute of Technology]]. The [[Kate Gleason College of Engineering]] at RIT is named in her honor, and her bust stands proudly in the hallway. Kate Gleason Hall is an RIT residence hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kate Gleason Hall|url=http://ritpedia.rit.edu/Kate_Gleason_Hall|website=RITpedia|accessdate=17 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gleason Works is still in operation today and retains a strong connection with RIT. In 2010, RIT press published a collection of Gleason's letters.&lt;ref&gt;Janis F. Gleason, The Life and Letters of Kate Gleason (Rochester: RIT Press, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
In 1884 at the age of 19 Kate Gleason enrolled into the Cornell Mechanical Arts program,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Karwatka|first1=Dennis|title=Kate Gleason--First Female Engineering Student|journal=Tech Directions|date=October 10, 2010|volume=70|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the first female student to attend for engineering.However she ended up leaving before the end of her first academic year to help her father. Her father had hired a man to replace her in the business but the firm started struggling financially and her father could no longer afford to pay Kate’s replacement and he called her home to help again at Gleason Works. She never was able to complete the requirements for a degree but through training and self-learning she earned the title of engineer and is recognized for her accomplishments. She did get some further education at Sibley College of Engraving and The Mechanics Institute which is now Rochester Institute of Technology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Layne|first1=Margaret|title=Women in Engineering:Tech Directions|date=2009|publisher=American Society of Civil Engineers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Laterite monument. C 002.jpg|thumb|right|alt=This monument is constructed of laterite brickstones. It commemorates Buchanan who first described laterite at this site.|Monument of laterite brickstones at [[Angadipuram]], [[Kerala]], India, which commemorates where laterite was first described and discussed by [[Francis Buchanan-Hamilton|Buchanan-Hamilton]] in 1807.]]

'''Laterite''' is a soil and rock type rich in [[iron]] and [[aluminium]], and is commonly considered to have formed in hot and wet tropical areas. Nearly all laterites are of rusty-red coloration, because of high [[iron oxide]] content.  They develop by intensive and prolonged [[weathering]] of the underlying [[parent rock]]. Tropical weathering (laterization) is a prolonged process of chemical weathering which produces a wide variety in the thickness, grade, chemistry and ore mineralogy of the resulting soils. The majority of the land area containing laterites is between the tropics of [[Tropic of Cancer|Cancer]] and [[Tropic of Capricorn|Capricorn]].

Laterite has commonly been referred to as a soil type as well as being a rock type. This and further variation in the modes of conceptualizing about laterite (e.g. also as a complete weathering profile or theory about weathering) has led to calls for the term to be abandoned altogether.  At least a few researchers specializing in [[regolith]] development have considered that hopeless confusion has evolved around the name.  There is no likelihood, however, that the name will ever be abandoned; for material that looks highly similar to the Indian laterite occurs abundantly worldwide, and it is reasonable to call such material laterite.

Historically, laterite was cut into brick-like shapes and used in monument-building. After 1000 CE, construction at [[Angkor Wat]] and other southeast Asian sites changed to rectangular temple enclosures made of laterite, brick and stone. Since the mid-1970s, some trial sections of [[Bitumen|bituminous]]-surfaced, low-volume roads have used laterite in place of stone as a base course. Thick laterite layers are porous and slightly permeable, so the layers can function as [[aquifer]]s in rural areas. Locally available laterites have been used in an acid solution, followed by precipitation to remove [[Sewage treatment#Phosphorus removal|phosphorus]] and heavy metals at sewage-treatment facilities.

Laterites are a source of aluminium [[ore]]; the ore exists largely in [[clay mineral]]s and the [[hydroxide]]s, [[gibbsite]], [[boehmite]], and [[diaspore]], which resembles the composition of [[bauxite]]. In Northern Ireland they once provided a major source of iron and aluminium ores. Laterite ores also were the early major source of [[nickel]].

[[Basement (geology)|Basement]] rocks are buried under the thick weathered layer and rarely exposed.&lt;ref name=tardy/&gt;{{rp|1}} Lateritic soils form the uppermost part of the laterite cover.
Very good water holding capacity:
- Because the particles are so small, the water is trapped between them.
- After rain, the water moves into the soil slowly.
- Palms are less likely to suffer from drought because the rain water is held in the soil.
- However, flooding after heavy rains is more likely.
- Nutrient leaching is not likely because the water moves down very slowly.
- Nutrients can be washed away from the soil surface easily because the water stays on top of the soil and doesn’t move inside.
Large surface of soil particles:
- Small clay particles have a large surface area compared to sand particles.
- Nutrients stick to clay soils more strongly.
- Most clay soils are quite fertile and oil palms need relatively small amounts of fertiliser.
Heavy structure:
- Because of the tiny particles, the soil sticks together very easily (see Figure 3).
- Digging holes or other soil management activities are difficult and should be carried out only on dry soils.
- Soil compaction happens easily, especially when the soil is wet. Once compacted, the soil becomes very hard and the oil palm roots cannot grow well. Therefore, it is important to be careful with cattle grazing and with allowing machines such as trucks and excavators into the plantation, especially after rain.

Tropical weathering (laterization) is a prolonged process of chemical weathering which produces a wide variety in the thickness, grade, chemistry and ore mineralogy of the resulting soils.&lt;ref name=dalvi/&gt;{{rp|3}} The initial products of weathering are essentially kaolinized rocks called [[saprolite]]s.&lt;ref name=schellmann &gt;{{Cite web |title=An Introduction in Laterite |last=Schellmann |first=W|url=http://www.laterite.de }}&lt;/ref&gt; A period of active laterization extended from about the mid-[[Tertiary]] to the mid-[[Quaternary]] periods (35 to 1.5 million years ago).&lt;ref name=dalvi/&gt;{{rp|3}} Statistical analyses show that the transition in the mean and variance levels of &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O during the middle of the Pleistocene was abrupt.&lt;ref name=maasch&gt;{{cite journal|title=Statistical Detection of the mid-Pleistocene Transition|journal=Climate Dynamics|publisher= Springer Berlin/Heidelberg|issn=0930-7575|volume=2|issue=3|date=February 1988|doi=10.1007/BF01053471|pages=133–143|author=Maasch, K.A.|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/m436x3585185vmk5/|accessdate=May 7, 2010|bibcode=1988ClDy....2..133M}}&lt;/ref&gt; It seems this abrupt change was global and mainly represents an increase in ice mass; at about the same time an abrupt decrease in sea surface temperatures occurred; these two changes indicate a sudden global cooling.&lt;ref name=maasch/&gt; The rate of laterization would have decreased with the abrupt cooling of the earth. Weathering in tropical climates continues to this day, at a reduced rate.&lt;ref name=dalvi/&gt;{{rp|3}}

Laterites are formed from the [[Leaching (pedology)|leaching]] of parent [[sedimentary rock]]s ([[sandstone]]s, [[clay]]s, [[limestone]]s); [[metamorphic rock]]s ([[schist]]s, [[gneiss]]es, [[migmatite]]s); [[igneous rock]]s ([[granite]]s, [[basalt]]s, [[gabbro]]s, [[peridotite]]s); and mineralised proto-ores;&lt;ref name=tardy/&gt;{{rp|5}} which leaves the more [[Solubility#Solubility of ionic compounds in water|insoluble]] ions, predominantly iron and aluminium. The mechanism of leaching involves acid dissolving the host [[mineral]] [[Crystal structure#Lattice systems|lattice]], followed by hydrolysis and precipitation of insoluble oxides and sulfates of iron, aluminium and silica under the high temperature conditions&lt;ref name=muir/&gt; of a humid sub-tropical [[monsoon]] [[climate]].&lt;ref name=hill/&gt;

An essential feature for the formation of laterite is the repetition of [[Wet season|wet]] and [[dry season]]s.&lt;ref name=kosei&gt;{{cite report|title=Iron isotope compositions of Fe-oxide as a measure of water-rock interaction: An example from Precambrian tropical laterite in Botswana|author=Yamaguchi, Kosei E.|series=Frontier Research on Earth Evolution|volume=2|date=2003{{ndash}}2004|page=3|url=http://www.jamstec.go.jp/ifree/jp/05result/IFREE_Report_for_2003-2004/honbun/04_26.pdf|accessdate=April 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rocks are leached by percolating rain water during the wet season; the resulting solution containing the leached ions is brought to the surface by [[capillary action]] during the dry season.&lt;ref name=kosei/&gt; These ions form soluble [[Salt (chemistry)|salt compounds]] which dry on the surface; these salts are washed away during the next wet season.&lt;ref name=kosei/&gt; Laterite formation is favoured in low [[Terrain|topographical relief]]s of gentle crests and [[plateau]]s which prevents erosion of the surface cover.&lt;ref name=dalvi/&gt;{{rp|4}} The reaction zone where rocks are in contact with water—from the lowest to highest [[water table]] levels—is progressively depleted of the easily leached ions of [[sodium]], [[potassium]], [[calcium]] and [[magnesium]].&lt;ref name=kosei/&gt; A solution of these [[ion]]s can have the correct [[pH]] to preferentially dissolve [[silicon oxide]] rather than the [[aluminium oxide]]s and [[iron oxide]]s.&lt;ref name=kosei/&gt;  
 
The mineralogical and chemical compositions of laterites are dependent on their parent rocks.&lt;ref name=tardy/&gt;{{rp|6}} Laterites consist mainly of [[quartz]], [[zircon]], and oxides of [[titanium]], iron, [[tin]], aluminium and [[manganese]], which remain during the course of weathering.&lt;ref name=tardy/&gt;{{rp|7}} Quartz is the most abundant relic mineral from the parent rock.&lt;ref name=tardy/&gt;{{rp|7}}

Yves Tardy, from the ''French Institut National Polytechnique de Toulouse'' and the ''Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique'', calculated that laterites cover about one-third of the Earth's continental land area.&lt;ref name=tardy/&gt;{{rp|1}} Lateritic soils are the [[subsoil]]s of the equatorial forests, of the [[savanna]]s of the humid tropical regions, and of the [[Sahel]]ian [[steppes]].&lt;ref name=tardy/&gt;{{rp|1}} They cover most of the land area between the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn; areas not covered within these latitudes include the extreme western portion of South America, the southwestern portion of Africa, the desert regions of north-central Africa, the Arabian peninsula and the interior of Australia.&lt;ref name=tardy/&gt;{{rp|2}}

==Uses==

===Agriculture===
Laterite soils have a high clay content, which mean they have higher [[Cation Exchange Capacity]] and water-holding capacity than sandy soils. It is because the particles are so small, the water is trapped between them.After rain, the water moves into the soil slowly.Palms are less likely to suffer from drought because the rain water is held in the soil.
However, if the structure of lateritic soils becomes degraded, a hard crust can form on the surface, which hinders water infiltration, the emergence of seedlings, and leads to increased runoff. It is possible to rehabilitate such soils, using a system called the 'bio-reclamation of degraded lands'. This involves using indigenous water-harvesting methods (such as planting pits and trenches), applying animal and plant residues, and planting high-value fruit trees and indigenous vegetable crops that are tolerant of drought conditions. They are good for oil palm, tea, coffee and cashew cultivation. The [[International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics]] ([[ICRISAT]]) has employed this system to rehabilitate degraded laterite soils in [[Niger]] and increase smallholder farmers' incomes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://resourcespace.icrisat.ac.in/filestore/1/3/8/4_e098f85b99eb337/1384_886aa09790138d3.pdf ''Bio-reclamation – Converting degraded lateritic soils into productive land'']{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Rural 21, March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Elouadrhiri is a fellow of the [[American Physical Society]], and has served as a member of the [[Department of Energy]] (DOE) Nuclear Science Advisory Committee (NSAC) and the DOE Nuclear Physics (NP) Committee of Visitors (COV)&lt;ref name="IPAC_bio" /&gt;. 



==Education==
Elouadrhiri obtained a physics B.Sc. from [[Mohammed V University]] in 1984, continuing to complete a M.Sc. in Theoretical Physics in 1987 entitled ''Poincare and Lorentz group (Group Theory)''. She continued to complete a [[Diplôme des Etudes Approfondies]] at the [[Blaise Pascal University|University of Blaise Pascal, Clermont-Ferrand]] in [[particle physics]] in 1987 entitled ''Development of Drift Chamber tracking Program''. Following this, she completed her PhD in 1991 in physics, also at the University of Blaise Pascal, Clermont-Ferrand in experimental hadronic physics with electromagnetic probes, producing a thesis entitled ''Measurement of the Nucleon Axial Form Factor from Low Energy Pion Electroproduction (Saclay nuclear physics experiment)'' &lt;ref name="GWU"&gt;{{cite web |title=Latifa Elouadrhiri |url=https://physics.columbian.gwu.edu/latifa-elouadrhiri |website=GWU Department of Physics |publisher=GWU |accessdate=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In 1994 Elouadrhiri chose to come to Jefferson Laboratory for a joint appointment with [[Christopher Newport University|CNU]], joining the lab as a staff scientist in 2001 as one of the first female staff scientists in the physics division&lt;ref name="IPAC_bio" /&gt;. 
Here, she led the measurement of the first observation of electron beam asymmetries in polarized, exclusive Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering&lt;ref name="IPAC_bio" /&gt;. 
From 2006 to 2015, Elouadrhiri was the Project Manager for the Hall B 12 GeV Upgrade, including all detectors, magnets and infrastructure for the CLAS12 system&lt;ref name="IPAC_bio" /&gt;. 

&lt;!-- She  was  selected for an honored position at CNRS/IN2P3 in 1994, but she decided to come to Jefferson Lab for a joint position with JLab/CNU  (1994-2011).  
In  2001, she joined  Jefferson  Lab among the first few women staff scientist in the physics division. 
Latifa was the leader of the pioneering measurement of the first observation of electron beam asymmetries in polarized, exclusive Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering. 
Prior to coming to JLab, Latifa performed experiments  at  Saclay  (France)  and  PSI  (Switzerland).
Since 2006, Latifa has  been  the Project Manager  for  the  Hall  B  12  GeV  Upgrade from  2005  to  2015 to  include all detectors, magnets and  infrastructure for  the  CLAS12  system. 
She  is  a  member of  the APS Division of Nuclear Physics and was elected APS Fellow in 2011. 
She has served on the  DNP  local  organizing  committee  in  2007  and 
on  the  DNP  nominating  committee  in 2009.  She  served  as  chair  of  the  DNP  nomin
ating  committee  in  2010, and chaired the local  organizing  committee  for DNP  2013. 
She  served  on  the  DNP  program  committee from 2011-2013. 
She  has served  as a member  of  Nuclear  Science  Advisory  Committee 
(NSAC), Committee of Visitors (COV). 
She has also served on review panels for funding European scientific program proposals. 
She  has served  as a member  on  several  Ph.D. theses committees.
She  is  the contact  person  and  the  spokesperson  of  the  DVCS experimental  program to  study  the  Generalized  Parton  Distributions  (GPDs)  program with the CLAS and CLAS12 detector systems. 
This program will allow, for the first time, the ability to develop 3D imaging of the nucleon. 
This is the flagship science program of CLAS12,  and one  of  the  major, new scientific  capabilities that  is  part  of  the  12  GeV Upgrade at Jefferson Lab. --&gt;

==Other==
In 2015, Elouadrhiri was interviewed for an article in the Chicago Tribune about the impacts of women in science and engineering &lt;ref name="ChicagoTribune"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dietrich |first1=Tamara |title=Local women scientists explain the 'trouble' with Tim Hunt |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/dp-nws-women-scientists-react-20150614-story.html |publisher=Chicago Tribune |accessdate=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

In 2018, she was personally recognized by the US Embassy in [[Rabat]] for her contributions to nuclear physics on both the official embassy Twitter &lt;ref name="embassy_twitter"&gt;{{cite web |title=U.S. Embassy Morocco |url=https://twitter.com/USEmbMorocco/status/1027929478243278849 |website=Twitter |publisher=Twitter |accessdate=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Facebook&lt;ref name="embassy_fb"&gt;{{cite web |title=US Embassy Rabat |url=https://www.facebook.com/USEmbassyRabat/posts/10156790233859551 |website=Facebook |publisher=Facebook |accessdate=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; pages.

'''Medical device reporting''' ('''MDR''') is the procedure for the [[Food and Drug Administration]]  to get significant [[medical device]] adverse events information from manufacturers, importers and user facilities, so these issues can be detected and corrected quickly, and the same lot of that product may be recalled. Consumers and health professionals report any [[adverse event]] caused by the device to [[MedWatch]] program for reporting significant adverse events or product problems with medical products.

==History==
Legislation requiring device user facility reporting was enacted by [[United States Congress|Congress]] to increase the amount of information the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and [[Medical device manufacturer|device manufacturers]] receive about problems with medical devices. Although manufacturers and importers of medical devices have been required since 1984 to report to FDA all device-related deaths, serious injuries, and certain malfunctions, numerous studies have shown   widespread [[Under-reporting|underreporting]]. A 1986 [[General Accounting Office]] (GAO) study showed that less than one percent of device problems occurring in hospitals are reported to the FDA, and that the more serious the problem with a device, the less likely it was to be reported. A GAO follow-up study in 1989 concluded that despite full implementation of the Medical Device Reporting (MDR) regulation, serious shortcomings still existed.

Under the [[Safe Medical Device Amendments of 1990|Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990]] (SMDA), device user facilities must report device-related deaths to the FDA and the manufacturer, if known. The facilities must also report device-related serious injuries to the manufacturer, or to the FDA if the manufacturer is not known. In addition, SMDA also required that device user facilities submit to FDA, on a semiannual basis, a summary of all reports submitted during that time period. The device user facility reporting section of SMDA became effective on November 28, 1991.

To implement SMDA, FDA published a tentative final rule in the [[Federal Register]] on November 26, 1991, inviting comments; over 300 comments were received. On June 16, 1992, the President signed into law the Medical Devices Amendments of 1992 (Public Law 102-300) making minor changes.   A final rule published in the Federal Register on December 11, 1995, addresses the comments received and the mandated changes.

==Update on FDAMA==
The [[Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997|Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act]] (FDAMA) made four changes that affected MDR, effective 2/19/98:
* Manufacturers and distributors/importers do not need to submit annual certification. 
* Domestic distributors are no longer required to file MDR reports, but must continue to maintain complaint files. 
* Importers (initial distributors for devices manufactured overseas and imported into the USA) must continue to file MDR reports. 
* User facilities must now file an annual report instead of semiannual reports, and Sentinel reporting by user facilities was proposed.

In [[telecommunication]], a '''microstrip antenna''' (also known as a '''printed antenna''') usually means an [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] fabricated using [[microstrip]] techniques on a [[printed circuit board]] (PCB).&lt;ref name=" Lee"&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a kind of Internal Antenna.They are mostly used at [[microwave]] [[frequency|frequencies]].  An individual microstrip antenna consists of a patch of metal foil of various shapes (a [[patch antenna]]) on the surface of a PCB([[printed circuit board]]), with a metal foil [[ground plane]] on the other side of the board.  Most microstrip antennas consist of multiple patches in a two-dimensional array.  The antenna is usually connected to the [[transmitter]] or [[radio receiver|receiver]] through foil [[microstrip]] [[transmission line]]s.  The [[radio frequency]] current is applied (or in receiving antennas the received signal is produced) between the antenna and ground plane.    Microstrip antennas have become very popular in recent decades due to their thin planar profile which can be incorporated into the surfaces of consumer products, aircraft and missiles; their ease of fabrication using [[printed circuit]] techniques; the ease of integrating the antenna on the same board with the rest of the circuit, and the possibility of adding active devices such as [[microwave integrated circuit]]s to the antenna itself to make [[active antenna]]s.

==Patch antenna==
{{main|Patch antenna}}
The most common type of microstrip antenna is the [[patch antenna]].  Antennas using patches as constitutive elements in an array are also possible.  A patch antenna is a narrowband, wide-[[Light beam|beam]] antenna fabricated by etching the antenna element pattern in metal trace bonded to an insulating [[dielectric]] substrate, such as a [[printed circuit board]], with a continuous metal layer bonded to the opposite side of the substrate which forms a [[ground plane]]. Common microstrip antenna shapes are square, rectangular, circular and elliptical, but any continuous shape is possible. Some patch antennas do not use a dielectric substrate and instead are made of a metal patch mounted above a ground plane using dielectric spacers; the resulting structure is less rugged but has a wider [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]].  Because such antennas have a very low profile, are mechanically rugged and can be shaped to conform to the curving skin of a vehicle, they are often mounted on the exterior of aircraft and spacecraft, or are incorporated into [[mobile radio]] communications devices.
It is used in telecommunication

==Advantages==
Microstrip antennas are relatively inexpensive to manufacture and design because of the simple 2-dimensional physical geometry. They are usually employed at [[UHF]] and higher frequencies because the size of the antenna is directly tied to the [[wavelength]] at the  [[resonance|resonant frequency]].  A single patch antenna provides a maximum directive gain of around 6-9 [[Decibel|dBi]].   It is relatively easy to print an array of patches on a single (large) substrate using lithographic techniques.  Patch arrays can provide much higher gains than a single patch at little additional cost; matching and phase adjustment can be performed with printed microstrip feed structures, again in the same operations that form the radiating patches.  The ability to create high gain arrays in a low-profile antenna is one reason that patch arrays are common on airplanes and in other military applications.

Such an array of patch antennas is an easy way to make a [[phased array]] of antennas with dynamic [[beamforming]] ability.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://electronicdesign.com/passives/welcome-antennas-101 "Welcome to antennas 101"]
by Louis E. Frenzel, "Electronic Design" 2008
&lt;/ref&gt;

An advantage inherent to patch antennas is the ability to have [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] diversity.  Patch antennas can easily be designed to have vertical, horizontal, right hand circular (RHCP) or left hand circular (LHCP) polarizations, using multiple feed points, or a single feedpoint with asymmetric patch structures.&lt;ref&gt;Bancroft, R. ''Microstrip and Printed Antenna Design'' Noble Publishing 2004, chapter 2-3&lt;/ref&gt; This unique property allows patch antennas to be used in many types of communications links that may have varied requirements.

==Rectangular patch==
The most commonly employed microstrip antenna is a rectangular patch which looks like a truncated [[microstrip]] transmission line. It is approximately of one-half wavelength long. When air is used as the dielectric substrate, the length of the rectangular microstrip antenna is approximately one-half of a free-space [[wavelength]]. As the antenna is loaded with a dielectric as its substrate, the length of the antenna decreases as the relative [[dielectric constant]] of the substrate increases. The resonant length of the antenna is slightly shorter because of the extended electric "fringing fields" which increase the electrical length of the antenna slightly. An early model of the microstrip antenna is a section of microstrip transmission line with equivalent loads on either end to represent the radiation loss.

==Specifications==
The dielectric loading of a microstrip antenna affects both its radiation pattern and impedance bandwidth. As the dielectric constant of the substrate increases, the antenna bandwidth decreases which increases the [[Q factor]] of the antenna and therefore decreases the impedance bandwidth. This relationship did not immediately follow when using the transmission line model of the antenna, but is apparent when using the cavity model  which was introduced in the late 1970s by Lo et al.&lt;ref&gt;Lo, Y.T., Solomon D. and
Richards, W.F. "Theory and Experiment on Microstrip Antennas," ''IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation,'' AP-27, 1979 pp. 137-149.&lt;/ref&gt; The radiation from a rectangular microstrip antenna may be understood as a pair of equivalent slots. These slots act as an array and have the highest directivity when the antenna has an air dielectric and decreases as the antenna is loaded by material with increasing relative dielectric constant.

The half-wave rectangular microstrip antenna has a virtual shorting plane along its center. This may be replaced with a physical shorting plane to create a quarter-wavelength microstrip antenna. This is sometimes called a half-patch. The antenna only has a single radiation edge (equivalent slot) which lowers the directivity/gain of the antenna. The impedance bandwidth is slightly lower than a half-wavelength full patch as the coupling between radiating edges has been eliminated.

==Other types==

Another type of patch antenna is the [[planar inverted-F antenna]] (PIFA).
The PIFA is common in cellular phones (mobile phones) with built-in antennas.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.antenna-theory.com/antennas/patches/pifa.php "PIFA - The Planar Inverted-F Antenna"].
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Iulian Rosu.
[http://www.qsl.net/va3iul/Antenna/PIFA/PIFA_Planar_Inverted_F_Antenna.pdf "PIFA – Planar Inverted F Antenna"].
&lt;/ref&gt;
The antenna is resonant at a quarter-wavelength (thus reducing the required space needed on the phone), and also typically has good SAR properties.
This antenna resembles an inverted F, which explains the PIFA name. The PIFA is popular because it has a low profile and an omnidirectional pattern.&lt;ref&gt;
Taga, T. Tsunekawa, K. and Saski, A., "Antennas for  Detachable Mobile Radio Units," ''Review of the ECL, NTT, Japan,'' Vol. 35, No.1, January 1987, pp. 59-65.&lt;/ref&gt;
These antennas are derived from a quarter-wave half-patch antenna. The shorting plane of the half-patch is reduced in length which decreases the resonance frequency.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.antenna-theory.com/antennas/aperture/ifa.php "Inverted-F Antenna (IFA)"]
at antenna-theory.com
&lt;/ref&gt;
Often PIFA antennas have multiple branches to resonate at the various cellular bands. On some phones, grounded parasitic elements are used to enhance the radiation bandwidth characteristics. 

The [[folded inverted conformal antenna]] (FICA)&lt;ref&gt;Di Nallo, C.; Faraone, A., "Multiband internal antenna for mobile phones," Electronics Letters , vol.41, no.9, pp. 514-515, 28 April 2005&lt;/ref&gt; has some advantages with respect to the PIFA, because it allows a better volume reuse.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11341">The '''piston-cylinder apparatus''' is a solid media device, used in [[Geosciences]] and [[Material Sciences]], for generating simultaneously [[high pressure]] (up to 6 GPa) and temperature (up to 1700&amp;nbsp;°C). Modifications of the normal set-up can push these limits to even higher pressures and temperatures. A particular type of piston-cylinder, called [[Griggs apparatus]], is also able to add a [[deviatoric stress]] on the sample.&lt;br /&gt;
The principle of the instrument is to generate [[pressure]] by compressing a sample assembly, which includes a resistance [[furnace]], inside a [[pressure vessel]]. Controlled high temperature is generated by applying a regulated [[voltage]] to the furnace and monitoring the temperature with a [[thermocouple]]. The pressure vessel is a [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] that is closed at one end by a rigid plate with a small hole for the thermocouple to pass through. A [[piston]] is advanced into the cylinder at the other hand.&lt;ref name=Dunn1993&gt;Dunn T. (1993) – The piston-cylinder apparatus. In: Luth R. W. (Ed.) Experiments at High Pressure and Applications to the Earth’s Mantle, MAC Short Course Handbook, Vol. 21, Mineralogical Association of Canada, pp. 39-94.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:QUICKpress.jpg|thumb|Non endloaded piston cylinder apparatus (2016)]]

== History ==

Sir [[Charles Algernon Parsons|Charles Parsons]] was the first to attack the problem of generating [[high pressure]] simultaneously with high temperature.&lt;ref name=Parsons1880&gt;Parsons C. A., Proc. Roy. Soc. (London), 44, 320 (1880); Trans. Roy. Soc. (London), A220, 67 (1920). Also see anon. report on Richard Threlfall's discourse at the Royal Institution, Engineering, 87, 425 (1909).&lt;/ref&gt;  His pressure apparatus consisted of piston-cylinder devices that used internal electrical resistance heating. He used a solid pressure transmitting material, which also served as thermal and electrical [[insulator (electrical)|insulation]]. His cylindrical chambers ranged in diameter from 1 to 15&amp;nbsp;cm. The maximum pressure at the temperature he reported was of the order of 15000 atm (corresponding to ~1.5 GPa) at 3000&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;br /&gt;
Loring L. Coes, Jr., of the Norton Co., was the first person to develop a piston-cylinder device with capabilities substantially beyond those of the Parsons device. He did not personally publish a description of this equipment until 1962.&lt;ref name=Coes1962&gt;Coes L. L., Jr. (1962) - Synthesis of Minerals at High Pressures. Modern Very High Pressure Techniques, Wentorf R. J., Jr., Butterworth Ed., London, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; The key feature of this device is the use of a hot, molded [[alumina]] liner or cylinder. The apparatus is double ended, pressure being generated by pushing a [[tungsten carbide]] piston into each end of the alumina cylinder. Because the alumina cylinder is electrically insulating, [[heating]] is accomplished, very simply, by passing an [[electric current]] from one piston through a sample heating tube and out through the opposite piston. The apparatus was used at pressures as high as 45000 atm (corresponding to ~4.5 GPa) simultaneously with a temperature of 800&amp;nbsp;°C. Temperature was measured by means of a [[thermocouple]] located in a well. At these temperature and pressure conditions, only one run is obtained in this device, the pistons and the alumina cylinder both being expendable. Even at 30000 atm (corresponding to ~3.0 GPa) the alumina cylinder is only useful for a few runs, as is also the case for the tungsten carbide pistons. The expense of using such a device is great.&lt;br /&gt;
Nowadays both the piston and the cylinder are constructed of cemented tungsten carbide and electrical insulation is provided in a different manner than in the device of Coes. In particular, the basis for the modern piston-cylinder apparatus is given by the design described by Boyd and England in 1960,&lt;ref name=Boyd1960&gt;Boyd F. R. and England J. L. (1960) - Apparatus for Phase-Equilibrium Measurements at Pressures up to 50 Kilobars and Temperatures up to 1750°C. Journal of Geophysical Research, 65, 2, 741-748.&lt;/ref&gt; which has been the first machine that allowed experiments under [[upper mantle]] conditions to be routinely carried out in a laboratory.

== Theory ==

The piston-cylinder apparatus is based on the same simple relationship of other high-pressure devices (e.g. [[Multi anvil|Multi-anvil]] press and [[Diamond Anvil Cell]]):

&lt;math&gt;P = \frac{F}{A}&lt;/math&gt;

where P is the [[pressure]], F the applied [[force]] and A the [[area]].&lt;br /&gt;
It achieves high pressures using the principle of pressure amplification: converting a small load on a large [[piston]] to a relatively large load on a small piston. The uniaxial pressure is then distributed (quasi-hydrostatically) over the sample through deformation of the assembly materials.

== Components ==

The main components of the piston-cylinder apparatus (Fig. 1) are the pressure generating system, the [[pressure vessel]], and the assembly parts within the vessel. There are two types of piston-cylinder apparatus: non end-loaded and end-loaded, which involve, respectively, one or two [[hydraulic ram]]s. In the end-loaded type the second hydraulic ram is used to vertically load and strengthen the pressure vessel. The non end-loaded type is smaller, more compact and cheaper, and is operable only to approximately 4 GPa.&lt;br /&gt;
Pressure is applied to the sample by pressing a piston into the sample volume of the pressure vessel. The sample assembly consists of a solid pressure medium, a [[resistance heater]] and a small central volume for the sample. Three common configurations are used: &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;”, &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{3}{4}&lt;/math&gt;” and 1”, which are the diameters of the piston and thus the sample assembly. According to the pressure amplification concept, the choice of the piston depends on the pressure you need to achieve.&lt;br /&gt;
During the experiment, [[water]] circulates around the pressure vessel, the bridge and the upper plates to cool the system.

=== Sample assemblies ===

The purposes of the sample assembly (Fig. 2) are to transmit [[hydrostatic pressure]] to the sample from the compressing [[piston]], to provide controlled [[heating]] of the sample and to provide, via the capsule, a suitable volatile and [[oxygen]] [[fugacity]] environment for the experiment. Therefore, it includes a component for each of these purposes.&lt;br /&gt;
The outer [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] is a [[pressure]] transmitting, electrically insulating cylinder made from [[sodium chloride|NaCl]], [[talc]], [[barium carbonate|BaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[potassium bromide|KBr]], [[calcium fluoride|CaF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], or even [[borosilicate glass]]. The next components are, in order, an electrically insulating borosilicate glass cylinder and a [[graphite]] cylinder, which acts as the “[[furnace]]”. To locate the sample exactly in the centre of the furnace and to grip the [[thermocouple]], a support rod usually made of crushable [[ceramic materials|ceramics]] is used. The final component is a conductive [[steel]] base plug, located at the top of the sample assembly.&lt;br /&gt;
The final part of the assembly is the thermocouple itself, whose wires are insulated from one another and from the material of the assembly by a tube made of [[mullite]].

=== Capsules ===

The sample capsule must contain the sample and prevent [[Chemical reaction|reaction]] between the sample and the other materials of the sample assembly and not, itself, react with the sample. It must also be weak so as not to interfere with [[pressure]] transmission during the run. For this purpose the materials most used are: [[Gold|A]]u, [[Platinum|Pt]], AgPd [[alloys]], [[Nichel|Ni]] and [[graphite]].&lt;br /&gt;
Sample [[volume]]s are typically 200&amp;nbsp;mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, which translates to ~500&amp;nbsp;mg of starting material, but with larger assemblies the volume can be up to 750&amp;nbsp;mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

== Pressure control ==

The nominal pressure in an experiment can be calculated from the amplification of the [[oil]] pressure through the reduction in [[area]] over which it is applied, but every component has a characteristic [[yield stress]], consequently the nominal pressure is different from the effective one. Thus, it must be adjusted taking into account the [[friction]]:

''P&lt;sub&gt;effective&lt;/sub&gt; = P&lt;sub&gt;nominal&lt;/sub&gt; + P&lt;sub&gt;correction&lt;/sub&gt;''

In order to determine the effective pressure, [[calibration]] experiments can be done using either static or dynamic methods, and usually make use of known phase transitions or reactions, melting curves or measured [[water solubility]] in [[melting|melts]].&lt;br /&gt;
Since frictional effects also depend on whether the press is in compression or in decompression, it’s good practice to perform the experiments in the same way as the calibration runs.

== Temperature control ==

[[Temperature]] can be measured using a [[thermocouple]] within an accuracy of ± 1&amp;nbsp;°C. The accuracy of the temperature is influenced by both [[random errors|random]] and [[systematic errors]], and is smaller at higher temperature and pressure conditions. Such errors can arise from [[temperature gradient]]s, differential pressures in the assembly, [[contamination]] during the experiment and the effect of pressure on thermocouple [[electromotive force]]. These errors can be cushioned choosing the appropriate thermocouple type for the experimental conditions. Temperature gradients, on the other hand, can be minimised using a tapered [[furnace]].

== Applications ==

The main advantages of the piston-cylinder press are the relatively large [[volume]] of the assembly, fast [[heating]] and [[quenching]] rates, and the stability of the equipment over long run durations.&lt;br /&gt;
These aspects, together with the ease and safety of procedure make this device suitable for geochemical studies and ''[[in-situ]]'' measurements of the physical properties of materials.&lt;br /&gt;
Some applications, especially in Geosciences, are: synthesis of high-pressure and temperature materials, [[hot pressing]] and investigation of [[partial melting]] of rocks.

The '''Portuguese inventions''' are the [[invention]]s created by people born in [[Portugal]] (continent or overseas) or whose nationality is [[Portugal|Portuguese]]. These inventions were created mainly during the age of [[Portuguese Discoveries]], but as well, during modernity.

Relying on trade secret explains, in part, the difficulty often experienced by researchers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Homens Espadas e Tomates|last=Daehnhardt |first=Rainer |authorlink=|year=1997 |publisher=Publicações Quipu |location=Rua Maria, 48-3º - 1170 Lisbon |isbn=972-8408-01-3 |page= |pages=255 |url=http://www.zefiro.pt/livro_homensespadasetomates2ed.htm |accessdate=2011-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; in documenting Portuguese inventions, as many are not described in [[patent]] documents, or other technical documents. On the other hand, there are cases, like some types of swords, where the inventions themselves or the underlying documents were lost, having been destroyed, for example, during the [[Peninsular War|French invasions]]. There are as well documentation and objects of Portuguese origin in private collections or museums outside of [[Portugal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=1AsFdUxOwu8C&amp;pg=PA36&amp;dq=museums+portuguese+%22mariner+astrolabes%22+private&amp;hl=pt-PT&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_9SzVLXNJPGf7gbawoDoBg&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=museums%20portuguese%20%22mariner%20astrolabes%22%20private&amp;f=false|title=Instruments of Science: An Historical Encyclopedia|page=36|ISBN=0-8153-1561-9|author=Robert Bud,Deborah Jean Warner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discoveries ==
{{Main|Portuguese discoveries}}
The creation of new inventions in Portugal took its peak during the [[Age of Discovery]]. These inventions consisted mainly in the improvement of devices and techniques of ocean navigation and coastal cartography, such as the [[mariner's astrolabe]] and the chart of latitudes. On the field of military applications, the construction of cannons and new types of swords, like the [[carracks black sword]].

== Modernity ==
More recently, the technical domain varies from computers to medicine. Such examples might be [[Via Verde]], an automatic system for collecting tolls for vehicles, the [[Multibanco]], an [[automatic teller machine]] network with a multitude of functions ranging from bank transfers to the payment of tickets for shows,&lt;ref name="manyfunc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sibs.pt/noticia.php?id=137 |title=Multibanco português é dos mais avançados do mundo |accessdate=2006-12-19 |publisher=Sociedade Interbancaria de Serviços S.A., citing Portuguese newspaper ''Semanário Económico'' in its 2006-10-27 edition.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3977">The [[Radio Electronics Television Manufacturers' Association]] was formed in 1953, as a result of mergers with other trade standards organisations, such as the [[Radio Manufacturers Association|RMA]]. It was principally responsible for the standardised [[nomenclature]] for American [[vacuum tubes]] - however the standard itself had already been in use for a long time before 1953; for example, the [[6L6]] was introduced in July 1936.

American made tubes bear a RETMA designation to allow for easy cross-referencing. The RETMA tube designation does not incorporate the purpose of each tube in the designation. The Anglo-European [[Mullard–Philips tube designation]] does include tube use information in the designation.

*'''First figure group''': indicates heater/filament voltage; 0 means a [[Cold cathode#Cold-cathode devices|cold-cathode tube]].
* '''Letter group''': letter(s) indicate the serial order of assignment of the designation; combinations like AB, AC, AD, AE... were used, avoiding same-letter repetitions, after the single letters were exhausted. Wherever possible, the 12V equivalent of a 6V tube had the same letters, just 12 instead of 6.
:*L as a first letter often indicates a lock-in (Loktal) tube.
:*P as a second letter indicates a CRT.
:*Letters U, V, W, X, Y and Z are commonly used for rectifiers

:Occasionally the same letter groups were used for differing tubes but only where the last number would be different making the designation unique. For example there is a 12AV5 (beam tetrode), 12AV6 (double diode, triode) and a 12AV7 (double triode).

*'''Second figure group''' is the number of useful elements (including the heater if this is separate from the cathode); in metal tubes the shell counts as one element. Internal shielding also counts, but base shielding does not. Electrodes connected together internally are counted as one element. There is an inconsistency in the way tapped heaters or filaments are counted. For example, the 12BH7 (double triode with separate cathodes) counts the centre tapped heater as one useful element, whereas the 12BY7 (pentode) counts the centre tapped heater as two useful elements. There are also inconsistencies in the way internal screens are treated. In the 6BX6 (pentode with g3 brought to its own pin), the screen around the assembly is not counted, whereas the 6BR7 (also a pentode with g3 brought to its own pin) has its similar screen included.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mif.pg.gda.pl/homepages/frank/sheets/155/suppinfo/Brimar7.pdf Brimar Radio Valve and Teletube Manual (Edition No. 7)]&lt;/ref&gt;

:In the case of a CRT, the second figure group indicates the type of [[phosphor]] the tube face was coated with.

The '''rhetoric of technology''' is both an object and field of study. It refers to the ways in which makers and consumers of technology talk about and make decisions regarding technology and also the influence that technology has on discourse.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Studies of the rhetoric of technology are interdisciplinary. Scholars in communication, media ecology, and science studies research the rhetoric of technology.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Technical communication]] scholars are also concerned with the rhetoric of technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Durack|first=Katherine|date=1997|title=Gender, Technology, and the History of Technical Communication|url=|journal=Technical Communication Quarterly|volume=6:3|pages=249–260|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase "rhetoric of technology" gained prominence with rhetoricians in the 1970s, and the study developed in conjunction with interest in the [[rhetoric of science]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/198203|title=The Prospect of rhetoric; report of the national developmental project, sponsored by Speech Communication Association.|date=1971|publisher=Prentice-Hall|others=Bitzer, Lloyd F.,, Black, Edwin, 1929-, Wallace, Karl Richards, 1905-1973., Speech Communication Association., National Conference on Rhetoric (1970 : St. Charles, Ill.)|isbn=0137313314|location=Englewood Cliffs, N.J.,|oclc=198203}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, scholars have worked to maintain a distinction between the two fields. Rhetoric of technology criticism addresses several issues related to technology and employs many concepts, including several from the canon of classical rhetoric, for example ''[[ethos]]'', but the field has also adopted contemporary approaches, such as new materialism.

== Definition ==
While the definition and scope of [[rhetoric]] is contested, scholars in the discipline, or rhetoricians, study the capacity of symbols to create change and influence perspectives.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Often, rhetoricians study discourse and texts, but they also study objects.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; [[Technology]] is both techniques and objects that embody and enact techniques.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Thus, rhetoric of technology scholars may look at texts and discourse associated with technology or techniques and technological objects. Concerns of rhetoric of technology include the influence of technology on public deliberation, conceptions of the self, and how new technologies come to be developed and adopted.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/42922325|title=The languages of Edison's light|last=Charles.|first=Bazerman,|date=1999|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=0262523264|location=Cambridge, Mass.|oclc=42922325}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Scholars who study rhetoric of technology have argued that it should be treated as distinct from the [[rhetoric of science]]. Charles Bazerman offers three distinctions between rhetoric of technology and rhetoric of science. First, unlike science, technology has always been intertwined with other clearly rhetorical endeavors, such as commerce and finance. Second, while the discourse of science often works towards specialization, the discourse of technology is pervasive. We may not all conduct experiments, but we all interact with and operate technology. Lastly, the products of technology are mostly material while the products of science are mostly symbols.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bazerman|first=Charles|date=1998|title=The Production of Technology and the Production of Human Meaning|url=|journal=Journal of Business and Technical Communication|volume=12:3|pages=381–387|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carolyn Miller argues that rhetoric of science must be treated as distinct from rhetoric of technology because technology and science differ in motivation, criteria of judgment, and values.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miller|first=Carolyn|date=1978|title=Technology as a Form of Consciousness: A Study of Contemporary Ethos|url=|journal=Central States Speech Journal|volume=29:4|pages=228–236|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Scholars started to suggest the importance of studying rhetoric of technology in the 1970s alongside a growing interest in rhetoric of science.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Thomas W. Benson and Gerard A. Hauser referred to the "rhetoric of technology" in a book review published in 1973 and noted the shared concern of rhetoric and technology with technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Benson|first=Thomas W.|last2=Hauser|first2=Gerard A.|date=1973|title=Ideals, superlatives, and the decline of hypocrisy|url=|journal=Quarterly Journal of Speech|volume=59:1|pages=99–105|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978 Carolyn Miller wrote “Technology as a Form of Consciousness: A Study of Contemporary Ethos.” In addition to explaining why rhetoric of technology should be treated separately from science, Miller argues that technology gives rise to a particular ''ethos,'' or personal character, because it generates particular actions and a particular consciousness. She concludes that technological consciousness assumes an objective perspective that erodes ''ethos''. Within technological consciousness, actions are right or wrong regardless of cultural possibilities because assessments are assumed to be objective.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In a series of oral histories collected by the Association for the Rhetoric of Science, Technology, and Medicine, scholars familiar with both fields recognized that there has been more research addressing the rhetoric of science than comparable work on technology. Carolyn Miller suggested that one reason for the relative lack of rhetoric of technology scholarship is that it is harder to find relevant texts to analyze. Miller noted that many of the primary texts dealing with technology are private company documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=ARSTonline|title=ARST Oral History Project--An Interview with Dr. Carolyn Miller|date=2013-06-24|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pz_rN8g8WN0|accessdate=2018-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concepts ==

=== Materialism and New Materialism ===
In 1980 [[Langdon Winner]] wrote the article “Do Artifacts Have Politics?” Winner suggests that objects reflect and enact ideological perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Winner|first=Langdon|date=Winter 1980|title=Do Artifacts Have Politics?|url=|journal=Daedalus|volume=109| issue =  1, Modern Technology:  Problem or Opportunity?|pages=121–136|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Winner's idea shares much in common with a materialist approach to rhetoric of technology. Materialist approaches to rhetoric of technology are related to [[materialism]] and treat technological objects the same as they may treat a text by critiquing how objects persuade and influence.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Jeremy Packer and Stephen B. Wiley provide an overview of new materialist approaches to rhetoric in their book ''Communication Matters: Materialist Approaches to Media''. Packer and Wiley conceptualize materiality as a “corrective” to the concept of communication as intangible. They suggest that the corrective is in response to a “poststructuralist impasse” in the field of communication, rhetoric, and media studies. They outline two approaches to materiality: 1) to equate materiality with physicality and approach infrastructure, body, space, and technology as fields of communication and 2) to analyze the materiality of communication itself, the physiological, mechanical, or digital media of communication. Packer and Wiley also identify key themes that are explored in materialist approaches: economy, discourse, technology, space, and bodies.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/694393761|title=Communication matters : materialist approaches to media, mobility and networks|date=2011|publisher=Routledge|others=Packer, Jeremy., Wiley, Stephen B. Crofts.|isbn=9780415782241|location=London|oclc=694393761}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ethos ===
In her 1978 article “Technology as a Form of Consciousness: A Study of Contemporary Ethos,” Carolyn Miller argued that technology was fundamentally changing how individuals judge personal character. She suggested that the ultimate result of a technological consciousness would be to erode a concern with ''ethos'' as technology would prevail in presenting actions and decision as objectively right or wrong. If all decisions are objective, then there is no longer a need for judgments of character.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In a 1992 article, Steven B. Katz employed Miller's "technological consciousness" to help explain the rhetoric used by members of the Nazi regime to enact the Holocaust.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Katz|first=Steven B.|date=1992|title=The Ethic of Expediency: Classical Rhetoric, Technology, and the Holocaust|url=|journal=College English|volume=54 |issue=3|pages=255–75|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Miller revisited the relationship between ''ethos'' and technology in an exploration of the impact of human-computer interaction. She explores two modes of human-computer interaction: expert systems versus intelligent agents. She argues that in both modes of interaction subjectivity blurs between the human-user and the computer, creating a hybrid (borrowing from [[Bruno Latour]]) or cyborg (borrowing from [[Donna Haraway]]). Expert systems are designed to mimic human experts; they typically draw from a deep database of information. Intelligent agent computer systems, in contrast, learn from interacting with an environment. The merger between human and computer destabilizes ''ethos'' according to Miller. As the intelligent agent model of computing has grown in popularity, Miller suggests that there has been a shift from a logos-centric to a pathos-centric ''ethos''. Neither, she contends, provide ethics, or ''arete'', which is a gap that rhetoric should fill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Ethos of Rhetoric|last=Miller|first=Carolyn|publisher=University of South Carolina Press|year=2004|isbn=|editor-last=Hyde|editor-first=Michael J.|location=Columbia, S.C.|pages=197–218|chapter=Expertise and Agency: Transformations of Ethos in Human-Computer Interaction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Invention ===
As invention is important to the development of new technology, invention is also important to rhetoric. Along with arrangement, delivery, style, and memory, invention is one of the five [[Rhetoric#Canons|canons of rhetoric]], or the five key elements of a competent speech according to classic rhetorical theory. Therefore, some rhetoricians argue that the development of new technology is fundamentally rhetorical. John A. Lynch and William J. Kinsella describe how both technology and rhetoric are both concerned with creating something new from available resources and know-how.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lynch|first=John A|last2=Kinsella|first2=William J.|date=2013|title=The Rhetoric of Technology as a Rhetorical Technology|url=http://ir.uiowa.edu/poroi/vol9/iss1/13|journal=Poroi|language=en|volume=9|issue=1|doi=10.13008/2151-2957.1152|issn=2151-2957}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kairos ===
[[Kairos]] is an ancient Greek word that captures the idea that there is a right time for action. Carolyn Miller has suggested that the "right time" is also a central concern for technology. She uses the Japanese "Fifth Generation" computer project as a case study. Miller contends that within technological discourse ''kairos'' is both a powerful theme and useful tool of analysis. She supports her claim with an analysis of technological forecasting, which was a central feature of the Japanese computer project, and concludes that technologists employ ''kairos'' to justify investment in particular technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miller|first=Carolyn|date=1994|title=Opportunity, Opportunism, and Progress: Kairos in the Rhetoric of Technology|url=|journal=Argumentation|volume=8:1|pages=81–96|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''side dish''', sometimes referred to as a '''side order''', '''side item''', or simply a '''side''', is a food item that accompanies the [[entrée]] or [[main course]] at a [[meal]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/side%20dish "Side dish."] (definition.) [http://www.merriam-webster.com Merriam-webster.com]. Accessed August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common types==
[[File:Flickr stuart spivack 173603796--Macaroni and cheese.jpg|thumb|right|A side dish of [[macaroni and cheese]]]]
[[File:Greek Salad Choriatiki.jpg|right|thumb|A side dish of [[Greek salad]]]]

Side dishes such as [[salad]], potatoes and bread are commonly used with main courses throughout many countries of the western world.  New side orders introduced within the past decade{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}, such as [[rice]] and [[couscous]], have grown to be quite popular throughout Europe, especially at formal occasions (with couscous appearing more commonly at [[Party#Dinner party|dinner parties]] with Middle Eastern dishes).

When used as an [[adjective]] qualifying the name of a dish, the term '''"side"''' usually refers to a smaller portion served as a side dish, rather than a larger, main dish-sized serving.  For example, a "side salad" usually served in a small bowl or salad plate, in contrast to a large dinner-plate-sized [[entrée]] salad.

A typical American meal with a meat-based main dish might include one vegetable side dish, sometimes in the form of a salad, and one [[starch]] side dish, such as bread, potatoes, rice, or pasta.

'''Some common side dishes include:'''

* [[Squash (plant)|Squash]]
{{div col end}}

Some restaurants offer a limited selection of side dishes which are included with the price of the entrée as a combination meal.  In contrast, sometimes side dishes are ordered separately from an [[a la carte]] menu. The term may or may not imply that the dish can only be ordered with other food.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

[[French fries]] are a common side dish served at [[fast-food restaurant]]s and other [[Cuisine of the United States|American cuisine]] [[restaurant]]s. In response to criticism about the high [[fat]] and [[calorie]] content of French fries, some fast-food chains have recently begun to offer other side dishes, such as salads, as substitutes for the standard French fries with their combination meals.

=="On the side"==
The related phrase '''on the side''' may be [[synonymous]] with "side dish" – as in "French fries on the side" – or may refer to a complimentary [[sauce]] or [[condiment]] served in a separate [[recipe|dish]].  For example, a diner may request a salad be served with its [[salad dressing|dressing]] "on the side".

[[file:SmokeGrenade1.JPG|thumb|upright|British L83A1 Smoke Grenade manufactured in May 2008. This grenade has already been used.]]

A '''smoke grenade''' is a canister-type [[grenade]] used as a signaling device, target or [[landing zone]] marking device, or as a [[smoke screen|screening]] device for unit movements.

Smoke grenades generally emit a far larger amount of smoke than [[smoke bomb]]s, which are a type of [[fireworks]] typically started with an external [[fuse (explosives)|fuse]] rather than a pin and are more complex. Smoke grenades often cost around {{USD|40}} compared to smoke bombs, which can often cost just a few cents.

__TOC__
== Design ==
[[file:M18 Grenade.svg|thumb|left|Diagram and cross section of an [[AN M18]] smoke grenade]]

Typical design consists of a sheet [[steel]] cylinder with four emission holes on top and one on the bottom to allow smoke release when the grenade is ignited. The filler consists of 250 to 350&amp;nbsp;grams of [[colored smoke|colored]] [[smoke composition]] (mostly [[potassium chlorate]], [[lactose]], and a [[dye]]) in virtually any color. White smoke grenades typically use [[hexachloroethane]]-zinc and granular aluminum. The reaction is [[exothermic]] and though they remain intact, smoke grenade casings will often remain scalding hot for some time even after the grenade is no longer emitting smoke. Although modern smoke grenades are designed not to directly emit fire or sparks, they remain a [[fire hazard]] and are capable of igniting dry vegetation or flammable substances if used injudiciously.

Another type of smoke grenade is the bursting variation. These are filled with [[White phosphorus incendiary|white phosphorus]] (WP), a [[pyrophoric]] agent which is spread quickly into a cloud by an internal bursting charge. White phosphorus burns with a brilliant yellow flame, while producing copious amounts of white smoke ([[phosphorus pentoxide]]). This type of smoke grenade is favored for its ability to produce a very dense and nearly instantaneous cloud of white concealment smoke as compared to the more common solid-filler grenades which expel a slower stream of smoke over a period of roughly 1 minute. For this reason they are favored for use in onboard grenade launching attachments on [[armored vehicles]], which require extremely fast concealment in the event they are targeted by [[laser guidance|laser guided anti-tank missiles]] and need to rapidly retreat.

== Use ==
[[file:Purple smoke grenade.jpg|thumb|left|A violet smoke grenade being used during a military training exercise]]

Smoke grenades are used for several purposes. The primary use is the creation of [[smoke screens]] for concealment and the signalling of aircraft.

If movement (such as [[flanking maneuver]]s or [[retreat (military)|retreat]]) is necessary, smoke grenades can be thrown prior to movement in order to provide a wall of visual distraction that reduces the accuracy of enemy fire and temporarily deceives them as to the force's location. The most common color for concealment smoke is white or grey. With the advent of [[infrared]] imaging goggles which can spot troop movements through smoke screens, the newest smoke compositions now include a "multi-spectrum" component to make them IR impermeable.

Smoke grenades can also be used to signal aircraft. Since locating a target from above (especially in thick forest canopy) can be nearly impossible, even with good radio contact, colored smoke grenades are often used to allow aircraft to spot them. Colored signalling smoke grenades are widely used in [[CASEVAC]] and [[close air support]] situations where quickly locating friendly ground forces is of paramount importance. Common colors are red, yellow, green and purple, and all use very brightly colored dyes to increase the likelihood of being spotted from above.

== Other uses ==
[[file:Amphibious Assault Vehicles fire smoke grenades.jpg|thumb|[[Amphibious Assault Vehicle]]s firing smoke grenades]]

Smoke grenades are functionally identical to many forms of [[United States hand grenades#Chemical grenades|chemical grenades]] (such as [[CS gas]] [[riot control]] grenades) and [[United States hand grenades#Incendiary grenades|incendiary grenade]]s (such as [[thermite]] grenades) which use a fuse to ignite a solid filler inside a steel canister, which then slowly propels the combustion products out through holes in the canister as the contents burn. However, the smoke grenade class is restricted to signalling and concealment under the [[laws of war]], and thus they are not considered weapons; since the vast majority are non-explosive, they remain legal for civilian use and ownership in most countries.

Since the basic design of a smoke grenade (a metal canister containing a substance that burns and expels smoke when ignited) is so simple, improvised devices are ubiquitous across the world. Protestors, football spectators, and [[airsoft]] enthusiasts often create their own smoke grenades using common materials.

'''V-Cord''' is an [[analog recording]] [[Videocassette#Cassette formats|videocassette]] format developed and released by [[Sanyo]].  V-Cord (later referred to as V-Cord I) was released in 1974, and could record 60 minutes on a cassette. V-Cord II, released in 1976, could record 120 minutes on a V-Cord II cassette.

The V-Cord II machines were the first consumer VCRs to offer two recording speeds.

==Appearance==

The original V-Cord cassette had a large hub and was wound with standard-thickness [[magnetic tape]]; V-Cord II used a small hub wound with thin tape, the same thickness later used for VHS-120 and Beta L-750. The cassettes were rectangular; unlike subsequent formats [[VHS]] and [[Betamax]], which loaded with the tape facing front on the long side of the cassette, the V-Cord cartridge was loaded sideways with the narrow side serving as the "front" and the tape coming out the "side".

The tape was held in place in the machine by a notch halfway down the right side of the tape, similar to what holds an [[8-track tape]] into its player.

==Operation==

The earliest machines recorded only in black and white and had no rewind mechanism, like the [[Cartrivision]] format of a few years earlier; an external rewinder was used after recording or playing a tape. External rewinders were later used with the VHS and Beta formats, although the machines could rewind tapes; external rewinders were considerably faster than the rewind function.

==Recording format==

The system had two recording modes: standard mode (STD), and a long-play mode (LP) which sacrificed recording quality for extra capacity. In STD mode both recording and playback heads are used, writing both fields of each interlaced video frame. In long-play mode only a single head is used to record a single field from each video frame, with each field being read twice on playback, in a "skip field" technique.&lt;ref name="history of tv"/&gt;&lt;ref name="advert"/&gt; The heads scanned the tape in a [[helical scan]] fashion &lt;ref name="advert"/&gt;

Tape was moved forward at 2.91 inches per second in STD mode, and 1.45 inches per second in LP mode;&lt;ref name="history of tv"&gt;{{cite book |title=The History of Television, 1942 to 2000 |first=Albert |last=Abramson |date=2003 |publisher=McFarland &amp; Co., Publishers |location=Jefferson, N.C. |isbn=9780786412204 |oclc=48837571 |pages=160, 170–171 }}&lt;/ref&gt; this gave a recording time of one-hour in standard mode and two hours in long-play mode. Horizontal resolution in color was quoted as 250 lines in advertising materials, stretching to 300 lines in black-and-white, with a video [[signal-to-noise ratio]] of 45&amp;nbsp;dB.&lt;ref name="advert"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.labguysworld.com/V-CORD_II_ADV_001_006.jpg |title=Sanyo V-Cord II System advertising brochure |publisher=LabGuy's World: The History of Video Tape Recorders before Betamax and VHS |format=[[JPEG]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audio response was specified as 80 to 10,000&amp;nbsp;Hz at -6&amp;nbsp;dB in STD mode, dropping to 80 to 8,000&amp;nbsp;Hz in LP mode.&lt;ref name="advert"/&gt;

The tape was a half-inch cobalt doped tape with a 550 [[oersted]] [[coercivity]]. The cassette measured 4&amp;nbsp;{{frac|5|16}}" by 6&amp;nbsp;{{frac|3|16}}" by 1". Two cassette types were available, a V60 and a V120 whose names matched their recording capacity in LP mode. The cassettes are similar in appearance to [[8-track tape|eight-track]] cartridges.

Conventional VHS and Beta formats recorded in a [[helical scan]] format, resulting in angled tracks running from the lower edge of the tape to the upper edge some distance down. Unlike these formats, the V-Cord format was closer to the 2-inch [[quadruplex videotape]] format used from the inception of video in the late 1950s until 2-inch helical [[IVC videotape format]] was introduced twenty years later, in that its tracks ran nearly perpendicular to tape travel.

A portable four-head video recorder, the Sanyo VTC-7100, used a similar format of cassette, but produced incompatible recordings.

The company claims to bring cheap and efficient computing devices in the fields of education where the Indian Government has often made efforts with the [[OLPC]] initiative and the [[Aakash (tablet)]] project.

The company was also the second lowest bidder for the Aakash project where they lost to [[DataWind]].&lt;ref name="NDTV"&gt;{{cite web

The idea of producing these [[tablet computers]] is partly inspired by the fact that there is a big gap between technology and education,&lt;ref name="bgr"&gt;{{cite web

Wishtel designed its tablets according to the required specifications from [[Indian Institute of Technology Rajasthan]]&lt;ref name="Hindu"/&gt; under the National Mission on Education, and are being funded by the Ministry of Human Resource.

'''Xelerated''' Inc., founded in 2000, was a [[fabless semiconductor company]] specializing in ASSP-based Carrier [[Ethernet]] chipsets.  Xelerated carried a line of programmable [[Network Processing Unit]]s (NPUs) and Ethernet [[network switch]]es for the [[Metro Ethernet]], [[access network]] and high-end enterprise markets.

==Overview==
[[File:100G network-processor.jpg|thumb|100G network-processor]]
Xelerated's design relies upon a patented [[dataflow architecture]]. Like an [[Application-specific integrated circuit|ASIC]], it is optimized in relation to the flow of packets instead of the flow of instructions through a [[RISC]] core. As a result, processing speed is predictable rather than variable.&lt;ref name="EN-Genius Netowork"&gt;[http://www.en-genius.net/site/zones/networkZONE/product_reviews/netp_061608"networkZONE Products for the week of June 16, 2008", ''EN Genius Network'', June 16, 2008] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722151409/http://www.en-genius.net/site/zones/networkZONE/product_reviews/netp_061608 |date=July 22, 2011 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Because Xelerated's NPUs and Ethernet switches were programmable, carriers could reprogram them to adapt to new standards as they develop.&lt;ref name="The Linley Wire"&gt;[http://www.linleygroup.com/npu/Newsletter/wire080610.html"Xelerated Turbocharges NPU Line", ''The Linley Wire'', June 10, 2008] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080819145858/http://www.linleygroup.com/npu/Newsletter/wire080610.html |date=August 19, 2008 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The company had offices in [[Santa Clara, California]], [[Stockholm]], [[Tel Aviv]] and [[Beijing]].

In January 2012, Xelerated was acquired by [[Marvell Technology Group]] for an undisclosed sum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= Nicolas Mokhoff|title= Marvell's buy of Xelerated lines up comms offerings |url= http://www.eetimes.com/electronics-news/4233840/Marvell-s-buy-of-Xelerated-lines-up-comms-offerings |newspaper= EE Times |date= January 4, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= Marvell Snaps Up Xelerated |work= Light Reading |date= January 4, 2012 |author= Ray Le Maistre  |url= http://www.lightreading.com/comm-chips/marvell-snaps-up-xelerated/240137489 |accessdate= May 27, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2015, the staff was informed about pending layoffs. In December 2015, office property from the Stockholm office was auctioned off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= Per Henricsson|title= Xelerated under klubban |url=http://www.etn.se/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=61697|newspaper= Elektroniktidningen |date= December 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
