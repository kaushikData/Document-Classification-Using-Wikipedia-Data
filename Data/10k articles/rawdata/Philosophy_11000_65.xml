[[Image:Berkeley1-1.jpg|thumb|160px|''Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge'']]
'''''A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge''''' (commonly called '''''Treatise''''' when referring to Berkeley's works) is a 1710 work, in English, by [[Irish people|Irish]] Empiricist philosopher [[George Berkeley]].  This book largely seeks to refute the claims made by Berkeley's contemporary [[John Locke]] about the nature of human perception.  Whilst, like all the Empiricist philosophers, both Locke and Berkeley agreed that we are having experiences, regardless of whether material objects exist, Berkeley sought to prove that the outside world (the world which causes the ideas one has within one's mind) is also composed ''solely'' of ideas. Berkeley did this by suggesting that "Ideas can only resemble Ideas" - the mental ideas that we possess can only resemble other ideas (not material objects) and thus the external world consists not of physical form, but rather of ideas.  This world is (or, at least, was) given logic and regularity by some other force, which Berkeley concludes is [[God]].

==Content==

===Introduction===
Berkeley declared that his intention was to make an inquiry into the First Principles of Human Knowledge in order to discover the principles that have led to doubt, uncertainty, absurdity, and contradiction in philosophy.  In order to prepare the reader, he discussed two topics that lead to errors. First, he claimed that the mind cannot conceive abstract ideas. We can't have an idea of some abstract thing that is common to many particular ideas and therefore has, at the same time, many different predicates and no predicates. Second, Berkeley declared that words, such as names, do not signify abstract ideas. With regard to ideas, he asserted that we can only think of particular things that have been perceived. Names, he wrote, signify general ideas, not abstract ideas. General ideas represent any one of several particular ideas. Berkeley criticized [[John Locke|Locke]] for saying that words signify general, but abstract, ideas. At the end of his Introduction, he advised the reader to let his words engender clear, particular ideas instead of trying to associate them with non–existent abstractions.

==Part I (Note: Part II was never published)==

==="To be" means "to be perceived"===
Berkeley began his treatise by asserting that existence is the state of being perceived by a perceiver. Human minds know ideas, not objects. The three kinds of ideas are those of sensation, thought, and imagination. When several ideas are associated together, they are thought to be ideas of one distinct thing, which is then signified by one name.&lt;ref name=BT1957sec1&gt;{{Harvnb|Berkeley|Turbayne|1957|p=}}, § 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Ideas are known and perceived by a knowing perceiver. This active perceiver is designated by the names mind, spirit, soul, or self. Ideas exist by virtue of a perceiver. The existence of an idea consists in being perceived.&lt;ref name=BT1957sec2&gt;{{Harvnb|Berkeley|Turbayne|1957|p=}}, § 2&lt;/ref&gt;

What is meant by the term "exist" when it is applied to a thing that is known through the senses? To say that something exists is to say that it is perceived by a perceiver.&lt;ref name=BT1957sec3&gt;{{Harvnb|Berkeley|Turbayne|1957|p=}}, § 3&lt;/ref&gt; This is the main principle of human knowledge.

External objects are things that are perceived through our senses. We perceive only our own sensations or ideas. Ideas and sensations cannot exist unperceived.&lt;ref name=BT1957sec4&gt;{{Harvnb|Berkeley|Turbayne|1957|p=}}, § 4&lt;/ref&gt;

To say that an object exists without being perceived is to attempt to abstract that which cannot be abstracted. We cannot separate or abstract objects and their qualities from our perception of them.&lt;ref name=BT1957sec5&gt;{{Harvnb|Berkeley|Turbayne|1957|p=}}, § 5&lt;/ref&gt;

If an object exists or is perceived, it must be perceived by me or some other perceiver. It is impossible to separate the being of a sensible thing from its existence as a perception of a perceiver.&lt;ref name=BT1957sec6&gt;{{Harvnb|Berkeley|Turbayne|1957|p=}}, § 6&lt;/ref&gt;

There can be no unthinking substance or substratum of ideas. Therefore, the perceiving mind or spirit is the only substance of ideas. Ideas inhere in or belong to a perceiver.&lt;ref name=BT1957sec7&gt;{{Harvnb|Berkeley|Turbayne|1957|p=}}, § 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Are there things that exist in an unthinking substance outside of the perceiver's mind? Can they be the originals that the ideas copy or resemble? An idea can only be like an idea, not something undetectable. It is impossible for us to conceive of a copy or resemblance unless it is between two ideas.&lt;ref name=BT1957sec8&gt;{{Harvnb|Berkeley|Turbayne|1957|p=}}, § 8&lt;/ref&gt;

===Locke's primary and secondary qualities===
According to [[John Locke|Locke]], a thing's primary qualities, such as its extension, shape, motion, solidity, and number, exist unperceived, apart from any perceiver's mind, in an inert, senseless substance called matter. Berkeley opposed Locke's assertion. Qualities that are called primary are, according to Berkeley, ideas that exist in a perceiver's mind. These ideas can only be like other ideas. They cannot exist in an unperceiving, corporeal substance or matter.&lt;ref name=BT1957sec9&gt;{{Harvnb|Berkeley|Turbayne|1957|p=}}, § 9&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary qualities of figure, motion, etc., cannot be conceived as being separate from the secondary qualities, which are related to sensations. Therefore, primary qualities, like secondary qualities, exist only in the mind.&lt;ref name=BT1957sec10&gt;{{Harvnb|Berkeley|Turbayne|1957|p=}}, § 10&lt;/ref&gt; The properties of primary qualities are relative and change according to the observer's perspective. The greatness  and smallness of figure, the swiftness and slowness of motion, exist in the mind and depend on point of view or position.&lt;ref name=BT1957sec11&gt;{{Harvnb|Berkeley|Turbayne|1957|p=}}, § 11&lt;/ref&gt;

===Number===
Number exists only in the mind. The same thing is described by different numbers according to the mind's viewpoint. An object can have an extension of one, three, and thirty six, according to its measurement in yards, feet, and inches. Number is relative and does not exist separately from a mind.&lt;ref name=BT1957sec12&gt;{{Harvnb|Berkeley|Turbayne|1957|p=}}, § 12&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sensed qualities are mental===
Unity is merely an abstract idea.&lt;ref name=BT1957sec13&gt;{{Harvnb|Berkeley|Turbayne|1957|p=}}, § 13&lt;/ref&gt; Primary qualities, such as figure, extension, and motion, are relative, as are secondary qualities such as red, bitter, and soft. They all depend on the observer's frame of reference, position, or point of view.&lt;ref name=BT1957sec14&gt;{{Harvnb|Berkeley|Turbayne|1957|p=}}, § 14&lt;/ref&gt; Berkeley's "…method of arguing does not so much prove that there is no extension or colour in an outward object, as that ''we'' do not know by ''sense'' which is the ''true'' extension or colour of the object."&lt;ref name=BT1957sec15&gt;{{Harvnb|Berkeley|Turbayne|1957|p=}}, § 15&lt;/ref&gt; Idealism, here, is epistemological, not ontological. Berkeley declared that it is "…impossible that any colour or extension at all, or other sensible quality whatsoever, should exist in an unthinking subject without the mind, or in truth, that there should be any such thing as an outward object."&lt;ref name=BT1957&gt;{{Harvnb|Berkeley|Turbayne|1957}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any quality that depends on sensation for its existence requires that a sense organ and a mind is conscious of it. By "unthinking subject," he means "mindless matter" or "substance, substratum, or support that is not a thinking mind." By "without the mind," he means "not in the mind."

===Meaning of ''material substance''===
Matter is material substance. What does this mean? "Material substance" has two meanings: "being in general" and "support of accidents." (The word accident is used here to mean an unessential quality.) "Being in general" is incomprehensible because it is extremely abstract. To speak of supporting accidents such as extension, figure, and motion is to speak of being a substance, substratum, or support in an unusual, figurative, senseless manner. Sensible qualities, such as extension, figure, or motion, do not have an existence outside of a mind.&lt;ref name=BT1957sec17&gt;{{Harvnb|Berkeley|Turbayne|1957|p=}}, § 17&lt;/ref&gt;

===Knowledge of external objects===
Comparing [[Ontology]] with [[Epistemology]], Berkeley asked, "But, though it were possible that solid, figured, moveable ''substances'' may exist without the mind, corresponding to the ideas we have of bodies, yet how is it possible for us to know this?"&lt;ref name=BT1957sec18&gt;{{Harvnb|Berkeley|Turbayne|1957|p=}}, § 18&lt;/ref&gt; Knowledge through our senses only gives us knowledge of our senses, not of any unperceived things. Knowledge through reason does not guarantee that there are, necessarily, unperceived objects. In dreams and frenzies, we have ideas that do not correspond to external objects. "…[T]he supposition of external bodies is not necessary for the producing our ideas…."&lt;ref name=BT1957 /&gt; Materialists do not know how bodies affect spirit. We can't suppose that there is matter because we don't know how ideas occur in our minds.&lt;ref name=BT1957sec19&gt;{{Harvnb|Berkeley|Turbayne|1957|p=}}, § 19&lt;/ref&gt; "In short, if there were external bodies, it is impossible we should ever come to know it…."&lt;ref name=BT1957sec20&gt;{{Harvnb|Berkeley|Turbayne|1957|p=}}, § 20&lt;/ref&gt; Suppose that there were an intelligence that was not affected by external bodies. If that intelligence had orderly and vivid sensations and ideas, what reason would it have to believe that bodies external to the mind were exciting those sensations and ideas? None.

===Berkeley's challenge===
Through reflection or introspection it is possible to attempt to know if a sound, shape, movement, or color can exist unperceived by a mind. Berkeley declared that he will surrender and admit the unperceived existence of material objects, even though this doctrine is unprovable and useless,  if "…you can conceive it possible for one extended moveable substance or, in general, for any one idea, or anything like an idea, to exist otherwise than in a mind perceiving it…."&lt;ref name=BT1957sec22&gt;{{Harvnb|Berkeley|Turbayne|1957|p=}}, § 22&lt;/ref&gt; In answer to Berkeley's summons, it might be said that it is easy to imagine objects that are not perceived by anyone. But, he asked, "…what is all this, I beseech you, more than framing in ''your'' mind certain ideas which you call books and trees, and at the same time omitting to frame the idea of any one that may perceive them? But do not you yourself perceive or think of them all the while?"&lt;ref name=BT1957sec23&gt;{{Harvnb|Berkeley|Turbayne|1957|p=}}, § 23&lt;/ref&gt; The mind had merely forgotten to include itself as the imaginer of those imagined objects.

===Absolute existence===
It is impossible to understand what is meant by the words ''absolute existence of sensible objects in themselves''.  To speak of perceived objects that are not perceived is to use words that have no meaning or to utter a contradiction.&lt;ref name=BT1957sec24&gt;{{Harvnb|Berkeley|Turbayne|1957|p=}}, § 24&lt;/ref&gt;

===What causes ideas?===
Ideas exist only in a mind and have no power to cause any effects. Ideas of extension, figure, and motion cannot cause sensations. "To say, therefore, that these [sensations] are the effects of powers resulting from the configuration, number, motion, and size of corpuscles must certainly be false."&lt;ref name=BT1957sec25&gt;{{Harvnb|Berkeley|Turbayne|1957|p=}}, § 25&lt;/ref&gt; Some non–idea must produce the succession of ideas in our minds. Since the cause can't be another idea, it must be a substance. If there are no material substances, then it must be an immaterial substance. Such an incorporeal, active substance is called a Spirit.&lt;ref name=BT1957sec26&gt;{{Harvnb|Berkeley|Turbayne|1957|p=}}, § 26&lt;/ref&gt; A Spirit is that which acts. A Spirit is one simple, undivided, active being.&lt;ref name=BT1957sec27&gt;{{Harvnb|Berkeley|Turbayne|1957|p=}}, § 27&lt;/ref&gt; It cannot be perceived. Only its effects can be perceived. The two principal powers of Spirit are Understanding and Will. Understanding is a Spirit that perceives ideas. Will is a Spirit that operates with or produces ideas. The words ''will'', ''soul'', or ''spirit'' designate something that is active but cannot be represented by an idea. Berkeley claimed that a person's active mind can imaginatively generate ideas at will.&lt;ref name=BT1957sec28&gt;{{Harvnb|Berkeley|Turbayne|1957|p=}}, § 28&lt;/ref&gt; Ideas that are sensually perceived, however, are not dependent on the observer's will. The ideas that are imprinted on the mind when observing the external world are not the result of willing.  "There is therefore some ''other'' Will or Spirit that produces them.&lt;ref name=BT1957sec29&gt;{{Harvnb|Berkeley|Turbayne|1957|p=}}, § 29&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural laws===
Ideas that are perceived through our senses are lively and distinct, unlike imagined ideas. Their orderly connection and coherence reflects the wisdom and benevolence of the mind that made them. The ideas of sense occur according to rules. We call these connections and associations ''laws of nature''.&lt;ref name=BT1957sec30&gt;{{Harvnb|Berkeley|Turbayne|1957|p=}}, § 30&lt;/ref&gt; Necessary connections are not discovered by us. We only observe settled laws of nature and use them to manage our affairs.&lt;ref name=BT1957sec31&gt;{{Harvnb|Berkeley|Turbayne|1957|p=}}, § 31&lt;/ref&gt; Erroneously, we attribute power and agency to ideas of sense, which are mere secondary causes. Ideas, we think, can cause other ideas. The primary cause, the "Governing spirit whose Will constitutes the laws of nature"&lt;ref name=BT1957sec32&gt;{{Harvnb|Berkeley|Turbayne|1957|p=}}, § 32&lt;/ref&gt; is ignored.

===Strong and faint ideas===
There are strong ideas and there are faint ideas. We call strong ideas ''real things''.&lt;ref name=BT1957sec33&gt;{{Harvnb|Berkeley|Turbayne|1957|p=}}, § 33&lt;/ref&gt; They are regular, vivid, constant, distinct, orderly,  and coherent. These strong ideas of sense are less dependent on the perceiver.  Ideas of imagination, however, are less vivid and distinct. They are copies or images of strong ideas and are more the creation of a perceiver. Nevertheless, both strong and faint ideas are ideas and therefore exist only in a perceiver's mind.

===13 Objections to Berkeley's principles===

====Objection 1====
Objection: ''[A]ll that is real and substantial in nature is banished out of the world, and instead thereof a chimerical scheme of '''ideas''' takes place.''&lt;ref name=BT1957sec34&gt;{{Harvnb|Berkeley|Turbayne|1957|p=}}, § 34&lt;/ref&gt; Answer: Real things and chimeras are both ideas and therefore exist in the mind.  Real things are more strongly affecting, steady, orderly, distinct, and independent of the perceiver than imaginary chimeras, but both are ideas. If, by ''substance'' is meant ''that which supports accidents or qualities outside of the mind'', then substance has no existence.&lt;ref name=BT1957sec37&gt;{{Harvnb|Berkeley|Turbayne|1957|p=}}, § 37&lt;/ref&gt; "The only thing whose existence we deny is that which ''Philosophers'' call Matter or corporeal substance."&lt;ref name=BT1957sec35&gt;{{Harvnb|Berkeley|Turbayne|1957|p=}}, § 35&lt;/ref&gt; All of our experiences are of things (ideas) which we perceive immediately by our senses.&lt;ref name=BT1957sec38&gt;{{Harvnb|Berkeley|Turbayne|1957|p=}}, § 38&lt;/ref&gt; These things, or ideas, exist only in the mind that perceives them. "That what I see, hear, and feel doth exist, that is to say, is perceived by me, I no more doubt than I do of my own being."&lt;ref name=BT1957sec40&gt;{{Harvnb|Berkeley|Turbayne|1957|p=}}, § 40&lt;/ref&gt;

====Objection 2====
Objection: ''[T]here is a great difference betwixt real fire for instance, and the idea of fire, …if you suspect it to be only the idea of fire which you see, do but put your hand into it….'' &lt;ref name=BT1957sec41&gt;{{Harvnb|Berkeley|Turbayne|1957|p=}}, § 41&lt;/ref&gt; Answer: Real fire and the real pain that it causes are both ideas. They are known only by some mind that perceives them.

====Objection 3====
Objection: ''[W]e "see" things… at a distance from us, and which consequently do not exist in the mind….'' Answer: Distant things in a dream are actually in the mind. Also, we do not directly perceive distance while we are awake. We infer distance from a combination of sensations, such as sight and touch. Distant ideas are ideas that we could perceive through touch if we were to move our bodies.&lt;ref name=BT1957sec44&gt;{{Harvnb|Berkeley|Turbayne|1957|p=}}, § 44&lt;/ref&gt;

====Objection 4====
Objection: It would follow from Berkeley's principles that ''…things are every moment annihilated and created anew… .''&lt;ref name=BT1957sec45&gt;{{Harvnb|Berkeley|Turbayne|1957|p=}}, § 45&lt;/ref&gt;  When no one perceives them, objects become nothing. When a perceiver opens his eyes, the objects are created again. Answer: Berkeley requests that the reader…consider whether he ''means'' anything by the actual existence of an idea distinct from its being perceived."&lt;ref name=BT1957 /&gt; "[I]t is the mind that frames all that variety of bodies which compose the visible world, any one whereof does not exist longer than it is perceived."&lt;ref name=BT1957 /&gt; If one perceiver closes his eyes, though, the objects that he had been perceiving could still exist in the mind of another perceiver.

====Objection 5====
Objection: "[I]f extension and figure exist only in the mind, it follows that the mind is extended and figured…."&lt;ref name=BT1957sec49&gt;{{Harvnb|Berkeley|Turbayne|1957|p=}}, § 49&lt;/ref&gt; Extension would be an attribute that is predicated of the subject, the mind, in which it exists. Answer: Extension and figure are in the mind because they are ideas that are perceived by the mind. They are not in the mind as attributes that are predicated of the mind, which is the subject. The color red may be an idea in the mind, but that doesn't mean that the mind is red.

====Objection 6====
Objection: "[A] great many things have been explained by matter and motion…."&lt;ref name=BT1957sec50&gt;{{Harvnb|Berkeley|Turbayne|1957|p=}}, § 50&lt;/ref&gt; Natural science has made much progress by assuming the existence of matter and mechanical motion. Answer: Scientists do not need to assume that matter and motion exist and that they have effects on an observer's mind. All scientists need to do is to explain why we are affected by certain ''ideas'' on certain occasions.

====Objection 7====
Objection: It is absurd to ascribe everything to Spirits instead of natural causes.&lt;ref name=BT1957sec51&gt;{{Harvnb|Berkeley|Turbayne|1957|p=}}, § 51&lt;/ref&gt; Answer: Using common language, we can speak of natural causes. We do this in order to communicate. However, in actuality we must know that we are speaking only of ideas in a perceiver's mind. We should "think with the learned and speak with the vulgar."

====Objection 8====
Objection: Humans universally agree that there are external things and that matter exists. Is everyone wrong?&lt;ref name=BT1957sec54&gt;{{Harvnb|Berkeley|Turbayne|1957|p=}}, § 54&lt;/ref&gt; Answer: Universal assent doesn't guarantee the truth of a statement. Many false notions are believed by many people. Also, humans may act as if matter is the cause of their sensations. They can't, however, really understand any meaning in the words "matter exists."

====Objection 9====
Objection: Then why does everyone think that matter and an external world exist?&lt;ref name=BT1957sec59&gt;{{Harvnb|Berkeley|Turbayne|1957|p=}}, § 59&lt;/ref&gt; Answer: People notice that some ideas appear in their minds independently of their wishes or desires. They then conclude that those ideas or perceived objects exist outside of the mind. This judgment, however, is a contradiction. Some philosophers, who know that ideas exist only in the mind, assume that there are external objects that resemble the ideas. They think that external objects cause internal, mental ideas.

====Objection 10====
Objection: Berkeley's principles are not consistent with science and mathematics. The motion of the earth is considered to be true. But, according to Berkeley, motion is only an idea and does not exist if it is not perceived. Answer: To ask if the earth moves is really to ask if we could view the Earth's movement if we were in a position to perceive the relation between the earth and the sun.&lt;ref name=BT1957sec58&gt;{{Harvnb|Berkeley|Turbayne|1957|p=}}, § 58&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance with our knowledge of the way that ideas have appeared in our minds in the past, we can make reasonable predictions about how ideas will appear to us in the future.&lt;ref name=BT1957sec59 /&gt;

====Objection 11====
Objection: Ideas appear in a causal sequence. If ideas are mere superficial appearances without internal parts, what is the purpose of the complicated causal sequence in which they appear? It would be less effort for objects to appear as ideas with simple exterior surfaces, without so many internal connections. Answer: Scientists should not explain things as though they are effects of causes. The connection of ideas is a relationship between signs and the things that are signified. We should study our ideas as though they are informative signs in a language of nature.&lt;ref name=BT1957sec66&gt;{{Harvnb|Berkeley|Turbayne|1957|p=}}, § 66&lt;/ref&gt; If we understand the language in which these idea–signs are used, then we understand how we can produce connections of ideas.

====Objection 12====
Objection: Matter may possibly exist as an inert, thoughtless substance, or occasion, of ideas.&lt;ref name=BT1957sec67&gt;{{Harvnb|Berkeley|Turbayne|1957|p=}}, § 67&lt;/ref&gt; Answer: If matter is an unknown support for qualities such as figure, motion and color, then it doesn't concern us.   Such qualities are sensations or ideas in a perceiving mind.

====Objection 13====
Objection: Holy Scripture speaks of real things such as mountains, cities, and human bodies. Holy Writ also describes miracles, such as the marriage feast at Cana, in which things are changed into other things. Are these nothing but appearances or ideas?&lt;ref name=BT1957sec82&gt;{{Harvnb|Berkeley|Turbayne|1957|p=}}, § 82&lt;/ref&gt; Answer: Real things are strong, distinct, vivid ideas. Imaginary things are weak, indistinct, faint ideas. Things that people are able to see, smell, and taste are real things.

===Consequences===
As a result of these principles, the following consequences follow:

====Banished questions====
Because the following inquiries depend on the assumption of the existence of matter, these questions can no longer be asked:&lt;ref name=BT1957sec85&gt;{{Harvnb|Berkeley|Turbayne|1957|p=}}, § 85&lt;/ref&gt;
*Can material substance think?
*Is matter infinitely divisible?
*What is the relationship between matter and spirit?

====We can know only ideas and spirits====
Human knowledge may naturally be reduced to two heads — that of IDEAS and that of SPIRITS.&lt;ref name=BT1957sec86&gt;{{Harvnb|Berkeley|Turbayne|1957|p=}}, § 86&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ideas, or unthinking things====

It is an error to think that objects of sense, or real things, exist in two ways: in the mind and not in the mind (apart from the mind). Scepticism results because we can't know if the perceived objects are like the unperceived objects.

Sensed ideas are real, existing things. They cannot exist without a perceiving mind. They cannot resemble anything that exists apart from a mind. This is because the existence of a sensation or idea consists in being perceived, and an idea cannot be like anything that is not an idea. If things originate or persist when I do not perceive them, it is because another mind perceives them.&lt;ref name=BT1957sec90&gt;{{Harvnb|Berkeley|Turbayne|1957|p=}}, § 90&lt;/ref&gt;

Sceptics, fatalists, idolators, and atheists believe that matter exists unperceived.

Another source of errors is the attempt to think about abstract ideas. Particular ideas are known as being real. Abstractions, made by subtracting all particularity from ideas, lead to errors and difficulties.&lt;ref name=BT1957sec97&gt;{{Harvnb|Berkeley|Turbayne|1957|p=}}, § 97,&lt;/ref&gt;

Sceptics say that we can never know the true, real nature of things. There is no way, they say, that we can compare the ideas in our mind to what is in the external, material world. We are ignorant of the real essence (internal qualities and constitution) of any object. They say that the cause of an object's properties is its unknown essence, occult qualities, or mechanical causes. But,  motion, color, sound, figure, magnitude, etc., are ideas and one idea or quality cannot cause another. The skeptics are wrong because only a spirit can cause an idea.&lt;ref name=BT1957sec102&gt;{{Harvnb|Berkeley|Turbayne|1957|p=}}, § 102&lt;/ref&gt;

The mechanical principle of attraction is used to explain the tendency of bodies to move toward each other. But attraction is merely a general name that describes an effect. It does not signify the cause of the observed motion.&lt;ref name=BT1957sec104&gt;{{Harvnb|Berkeley|Turbayne|1957|p=}}, § 104&lt;/ref&gt; All efficient causes are produced by the will of a mind or spirit&lt;ref name=BT1957sec105&gt;{{Harvnb|Berkeley|Turbayne|1957|p=}}, § 105&lt;/ref&gt; (mind or spirit being that which thinks, wills, and perceives). Gravitation (mutual attraction) is said to be universal. We, however, don't know if gravitation is necessary or essential everywhere in the universe. Gravitation depends only on the will of the mind or spirit that governs the universe.&lt;ref name=BT1957sec106&gt;{{Harvnb|Berkeley|Turbayne|1957|p=}}, § 106&lt;/ref&gt;

Four conclusions result from these premisses: (1) Mind or spirit is the efficient cause in nature; (2) We should investigate the final causes or purposes of things; (3) We should study the history of nature and make observations and experiments in order to draw useful general conclusions; (4) We should observe the phenomena that we see in order to discover general laws of nature in order to deduce other phenomena from them. These four conclusions are based on the wisdom, goodness, and kindness of God.&lt;ref name=BT1957sec107&gt;{{Harvnb|Berkeley|Turbayne|1957|p=}}, § 107&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sir Isaac Newton|Newton]] asserted that time, space, and motion can be distinguished into absolute/relative, true/apparent, mathematical/vulgar. In so doing, he assumed that time, space, and motion are usually thought of as being related to sensible things. But they also, he assumed, have an inner nature that exists apart from a spectator's mind and has no relation to sensible things.&lt;ref name=BT1957sec110&gt;{{Harvnb|Berkeley|Turbayne|1957|p=}}, § 110&lt;/ref&gt; He described an absolute time, space, and motion that are distinguished from relative or apparent time, space, and motion. Berkeley disagreed. To him, all motion is relative because the idea that Berkeley had of motion necessarily included relation. 
By pure space, I mean that I conceive that I can move my arms and legs without anything resisting them. Space is less pure when there is more resistance by other bodies. Space, therefore, is an idea that is relative to body and motion.&lt;ref name=BT1957sec116&gt;{{Harvnb|Berkeley|Turbayne|1957|p=}}, § 116&lt;/ref&gt;

Errors made by mathematicians occur because of (1) their reliance on general abstract ideas and (2) their belief that an object exists as such without being an idea in a spectator's mind.&lt;ref name=BT1957sec118&gt;{{Harvnb|Berkeley|Turbayne|1957|p=}}, § 118&lt;/ref&gt; In arithmetic, those things which pass for abstract truths and theorems concerning numbers are, in reality, concerned with particular things that can be counted.&lt;ref name=BT1957sec122&gt;{{Harvnb|Berkeley|Turbayne|1957|p=}}, § 122&lt;/ref&gt; In geometry, a source of confusion is the assumption that a finite extension is infinitely divisible or contains an infinite number of parts.&lt;ref name=BT1957sec123&gt;{{Harvnb|Berkeley|Turbayne|1957|p=}}, § 123&lt;/ref&gt; Every particular finite line, surface, or solid which may possibly be the object of our thought is an ''idea'' existing only in the mind, and consequently each part of it must be perceived.&lt;ref name=BT1957sec124&gt;{{Harvnb|Berkeley|Turbayne|1957|p=}}, § 124&lt;/ref&gt; Any line, surface, or solid that I perceive is an idea in my mind. I can't divide my idea into an infinite number of other ideas.&lt;ref name=BT1957 /&gt; We can't conceive of an inch–long line being divided into a thousand parts, much less infinities of infinities. There is no such thing as an infinite number of parts contained in a finite quantity. In order to use mathematics, it is not necessary to assume that there are infinite parts of finite lines or any quantities smaller than the smallest that can be sensed.&lt;ref name=BT1957sec132&gt;{{Harvnb|Berkeley|Turbayne|1957|p=}}, § 132&lt;/ref&gt;

====Spirits, or thinking things====

A spirit or mind is that which thinks, wills, or perceives.&lt;ref name=BT1957sec138&gt;{{Harvnb|Berkeley|Turbayne|1957|p=}},, § 138&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought that we are ignorant of the nature of mind or spirit because we have no idea of it. But it was demonstrated in § 27 that ideas exist in spirits or minds. It is absurd to expect that the spirit or mind that supports an idea should itself also be an idea.&lt;ref name=BT1957sec135&gt;{{Harvnb|Berkeley|Turbayne|1957|p=}}, § 135&lt;/ref&gt; In § 27, it was shown that the soul is indivisible. Therefore, it is naturally immortal.&lt;ref name=BT1957sec141&gt;{{Harvnb|Berkeley|Turbayne|1957|p=}}, § 141&lt;/ref&gt; I know that spirits or minds other than myself exist because I perceive the ideas that they cause.&lt;ref name=BT1957sec145&gt;{{Harvnb|Berkeley|Turbayne|1957|p=}}, § 145&lt;/ref&gt; When I perceive the order and harmony of nature, I know that God, as infinitely wise spirit or mind, is the cause.&lt;ref name=BT1957sec146&gt;{{Harvnb|Berkeley|Turbayne|1957|p=}}, § 146&lt;/ref&gt; We can't see God because He is a spirit or mind, not an idea. We see Him in the same way that we see a man, when actually we are seeing only the ideas, such as color, size, and motion that the man causes.&lt;ref name=BT1957sec148&gt;{{Harvnb|Berkeley|Turbayne|1957|p=}}, § 148&lt;/ref&gt;  Imperfections in nature, such as floods, blights, monstrous births, etc., are absolutely necessary. They are not the result of God's direct influence. They are the result of the working of the system of simple, general, consistent rules that God has established in nature in order that living things can survive.&lt;ref name=BT1957sec151&gt;{{Harvnb|Berkeley|Turbayne|1957|p=}}, § 151&lt;/ref&gt; Such natural defects are useful in that they act as an agreeable variety and accentuate the beauty of the rest of nature by their contrast.&lt;ref name=BT1957sec152&gt;{{Harvnb|Berkeley|Turbayne|1957|p=}}, § 152&lt;/ref&gt; The pain that exists in the world is indispensably necessary to our well–being. When seen from a higher, broader perspective, particular evils are known to be good when they are comprehended as parts of a beautiful, orderly whole system.&lt;ref name=BT1957sec153&gt;{{Harvnb|Berkeley|Turbayne|1957|p=}}, § 153&lt;/ref&gt;

===Main purpose===
Berkeley claimed that the main design of his efforts in writing this book was to promote the consideration of God and our duty. If we are clearly convinced of God's existence, then we will fill our hearts with awful circumspection and holy fear. Berkeley claimed that the world exists as it does, when no one is looking at it, because it consists of ideas that are perceived by the mind of God. If we think that the eyes of the Lord are everywhere, beholding the evil and the good, knowing our innermost thoughts, then we will realize our total dependence on Him. In this way, we will have an incentive to be virtuous and to avoid vice.&lt;ref name=BT1957sec156&gt;{{Harvnb|Berkeley|Turbayne|1957|p=}}, § 156&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3453">The '''African News Agency''', popularly referred to as "ANA," was established by two African billionaires, [[Sekunjalo Investments]] Chair and Executive Chairman of Independent Media,&lt;ref name="indep"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.independentmedia.co.za | title=Company Website | publisher=Independent Media | accessdate=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr Iqbal Survé, and the Chairman of the Pan African Business Forum, Ladislas Agbesi. The African News Agency is the first news and content syndication service on the [[Africa|African continent]], and was launched in [[Cape Town]] in February 2015.

The launch of ANA followed the liquidation of the [[South African Press Association]] (SAPA). The SAPA was once a major supplier of foreign and domestic news in [[South Africa]], and consisted of a feed distributed to newsrooms in the country. When the two African investors acquired SAPA, to establish the African News Agency, they wanted to create one of Africa’s first news syndication services with stories written by Africans, for Africans, and for the rest of the world. They realized that the narrative of Africa had been written by Western news organisations, and did not subscribe to the view that [[Africa]] is a continent that is subject to famine, crime and disease. The African News Agency would tell far more positive stories of Africa and African people showcasing Africa as a continent full of hope and a wealth of opportunity.&lt;ref name="Afri Investors"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.iol.co.za/business/companies/african-investors-launch-news-agency-1.1815911#.Vjh1afkrLIU |title=African investors launch news agency - Companies &amp;#124; IOL Business |publisher=Iol.co.za |date=2015-02-10 |accessdate=2015-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TimesL"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/local/2015/02/10/african-news-agency-to-be-launched-march-1 |title=African News Agency to be launched March 1 |publisher=Times LIVE |date=2015-02-10 |accessdate=2015-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fin24"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fin24.com/Economy/African-news-agency-to-be-launched-20150210 |title=African news agency to be launched |publisher=Fin24 |date=2015-02-10 |accessdate=2015-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IOLbegins"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/africa/african-news-agency-begins-operations-1.1825260#.Vjh1gvkrLIU |title=African News Agency begins operations - Africa &amp;#124; IOL News |publisher=Iol.co.za |date=2015-03-02 |accessdate=2015-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently the multimedia news service provides news and relevant content to broadcasters, newspapers, digital customers, and business and civil society organisations covering a range of news, from economics and business to sports, lifestyle, politics, and entertainment. Recently, international investors bought a 10% stake in the news syndication service. Launched in South Africa six months ago, ANA is now worth a billion USD.

'''Ajñana''' was one of the [[Āstika and nāstika|''nāstika'']] or "heterodox" schools of [[Hindu philosophy|ancient Indian philosophy]], and the ancient school of radical Indian [[Philosophical skepticism#Ajñana|skepticism]]. It was a [[Śramaṇa|Śramaṇa movement]] and a major rival of [[Pre-sectarian Buddhism|early Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]]. They have been recorded in Buddhist and Jain texts. They held that it was impossible to obtain knowledge of metaphysical nature or ascertain the truth value of philosophical propositions; and even if knowledge was possible, it was useless and disadvantageous for final salvation. They were specialized in refutation without propagating any positive doctrine of their own.

==Sources==
All of our knowledge of the Ajñana come from the Buddhists and Jain sources. The Ajñana view points are recorded in [[Theravada|Theravada Buddhism]]'s [[Pāli Canon]] in the [[Brahmajala Sutta (Theravada)|''Brahmajala Sutta'']] and ''[[Samaññaphala Sutta]]'' and in the [[Sutrakritanga|''Sūyagaḍaṃga'']] of [[Jainism]]. Along with these texts, the sayings and opinions of the Sceptics (''ajñanikah'', ''ajñaninah'') has been preserved by Jain writer Silanka, from the ninth century, commenting on the [[Sutrakritanga]]. Silanka considers sceptics "those who claim that scepticism is best" or as "those in whom no knowledge, i.e. scepticism, is evident". Apart from the specific technical meaning, Silanka also uses the word ''ajñanikah'' in a more general sense to mean anyone who is ignorant.{{sfn|Jayatilleke|2013|pp=110-111}}{{sfn|Warder|1998|pp=43-44}}

==Origin==
The traces of scepticism can be found in Vedic sources such as in the [[Nasadiya Sukta|Nasadiya]] hymn and hymn to ''sraddha'' (faith) in [[Rigveda]]. In Brahmanas and Early Upanishads doubt regarding a person's existence after death is cast, while the [[Yajnavalkya|Yajñavalkya]] argued for the impossibility of knowing the ultimate reality or the atman.{{sfn|Jayatilleke|2013|p=109}} However the flourishing of sceptical thoughts seems to have occurred in a period with diverse, conflicting, and irreconcilable theories, regarding morality, metaphysics, and religious beliefs. It is natural, in the absence of a commonly accepted criterion of truth, for some people to wonder if any theory could be true at all.{{sfn|Jayatilleke|2013|p=110}} The Sceptics specifically pointed to the conflicting theories of atman and the requirement of omniscience, and hence the criticism of omniscience, to obtain true knowledge.{{sfn|Jayatilleke|2013|pp=111-115}} A proliferation of view points existed during the period immediately preceding the rise of Buddhism, as attested in the Buddhist and Jain texts. The Buddhist [[Brahmajala Sutta (Theravada)|Brahmajal Sutta]] lists four types (or schools) of Sceptics along with fifty-eight other schools of thought, while the Jain Sutrakrtanga lists sixty-seven "schools" of Sceptics among three hundred and sixty-three different schools of thought. While the list is artificially constructed according to Jain categories, the four main schools of thought, Kriyavada, Akriyavada, Ajnanikavada, and Vainayikavada, and their subgroups must have existed. Thus, philosophical Scepticism is thought to have appeared around this historic time frame.{{sfn|Jayatilleke|2013|pp=115-116}}

==Jain account==
===On atman===
The Ajñana claimed that the possibility of knowledge is doubtful since the claims to knowledge were mutually contradictory. Silanka quotes, "They posit the theory that since those who claim knowledge make mutually contradictory assertions, they cannot be stating the truth." Regarding Sceptic's point of view, Silanka in his commentary writes, as translated by Jayatilleke:

{{quote|For they (i.e. the Sceptics) say that those who claim knowledge (''jñaninah'') cannot be stating actual facts since their statements are mutually contradictory, for even with regard to the category of the soul, some assert that the soul is omnipresent (''sarvagatam'') and other that it is not omnipresent (''asarvagatam''), some (say) it is of the size of a digit (''angustaparvamatram'')  others that it is of the size of a kernel of a grain of millet (''syamakatandulamatram'') some say it both has form and is formless (''murtamamurtam''), some that it resides in the heart (''hrdayamadhyavartinam'') and (others) that it is located in the forehead (''lalatavyavasthitam''), etc. -- in respect of every category there is no uniformity in their assertion.{{sfn|Jayatilleke|2013|pp=112-113}}}}

The conflicting theories of atman can be traced to Early Upanisads. The idea of atman "made of everything" (''sarvamayah'', ''idammayah adomayah'') would be omnipresent (''sarvagatam'') (Brhadaranyaka 4.4.5) while the transcendent atman defined negatively (Brhadaranyaka 3.9.26) would not be so. Again at Katha 2.3.17 the atman is of "the size of a digit", while at Chandogya 3.14.3, the atman is "smaller than a kernel of a grain of millet". Again at Brhadaranyaka 2.3.1, Brahman which is identical with the atman is said "both to have form and also be formless." Likewise at Katha 2.3.17 the atman "resides in the heart" while at Aitareya Aranyaka 2.1.4.6 it is located in the head.{{sfn|Jayatilleke|2013|pp=114}}

===On omniscience===
In the same passage, Silanka continues:
{{quote| There is no one with an outstanding intellect whose statements may be regarded as authoritative; even if such a person existed, he cannot be discovered by one with a limited vision according to the maxim that "one who is not omniscient does not know everything" for it is said "how can one desiring to know that a certain person is omniscient at a certain time do so if he is devoid of that person's intellect, his knowledge and his consciousness"; owing to the absence of the knowledge of the means, it cannot properly be accomplished; it cannot be accomplished because of the mutual dependence (of the two); for it is said "without a super-knowledge (''visistaparijñana'') the knowledge of the means is not attained and as a result there is no attainment of the super-knowledge of the object".{{sfn|Jayatilleke|2013|pp=112-113}} }}

This criticism of omniscience seems to be directed at those teachers who claimed omniscience, or to their followers who later claimed them to be omniscient, specifically the Jain leaders and Purana Kassapa, and maybe later to Makkhali Gosala and the Buddha, on the basis of which they claimed to speak with authority.{{sfn|Jayatilleke|2013|pp=114-115}} The dictum, that with a limited knowledge no one can know that any person is omniscient, may possibly be an old saying of the Sceptics; and they may have extended the idea to say that since human intellect was limited, no one could claim to know everything with such limited intellect.{{sfn|Jayatilleke|2013|pp=115}} The passage may also be seen as a critic on epistemology.

===On knowledge===
In the same passage, Silanka further continues:
{{quote| Knowledge cannot completely comprehend the nature of the object of knowledge, for it is said, "whatever is apprehended should have the parts, near, middle and outer but here only the near part is apprehended and not the others since it is determined by it (i.e. the nature of the object)"; as for the exhausting the atom (''paramanu-paryavasanata?'') with the (knowledge of) the near portion, considering the unrepresented parts out of the three parts, it is not possible to apprehend the atom by those with a limited vision owing to the excellence of its nature; therefore, since there is no omniscient person and since one who is not omniscient cannot comprehend the nature of an object as it is constituted, since all the theorists (''sarvavadinam'') have conceived of the nature of the categories in a mutually contradictory manner and those who have claimed super-knowledge (''uttarapari-jñaninam'') are at fault (''paramdavatam'') Scepticism is best owing to the magnitude of the mistakes that arise (from claims of knowledge).{{sfn|Jayatilleke|2013|pp=112-113}} }}

To the Sceptics, none of the contending theories, proposed by limited intellect, can be known to be true, since they are mutually contradictory. Also, any new theory is bound to contradict existing theories, and hence cannot be true. Hence nothing can be known to be true. Thus the Sceptics conclude that the contradictions of metaphysics and the impossibility of omniscience leads them to accept Scepticism.{{sfn|Jayatilleke|2013|pp=115}}

In a similar vein, the Sceptics held that

{{quote|Scepticism is the best since it is difficult to gauge the thought process of another.{{sfn|Jayatilleke|2013|pp=117}}}}

This may also be the reason why the Sceptics held to another dictum that

{{quote|All teachings are like the utterances of barbarians since they have no (epistemic) basis.{{sfn|Jayatilleke|2013|pp=117}}}}

Likewise, Silanka comments, "owing to the difficulty of knowing another's mind, they do not grasp what is intended by the words of their teacher and thus repeat the other's words like a barbarian without understanding the real meaning."{{sfn|Jayatilleke|2013|pp=117-118}}

Regarding this passage and the maxims on knowledge, Jayatilleke compares the Sceptic's views with that of the Greek sophist [[Gorgias]], as given in his book "Nature or the Non-existent," and proposes that the Sceptics may have arrived at their position using similar lines of reasoning. According to Jayatilleke's interpretation of the passage given by Silanka, perception is divided into near, middle, and outer, and we perceive only the near; so each person's view of what they see of an object will be different according their perspective. Since our knowledge depends on our individual perspective, the knowledge would be subjective since different person will have differing perspectives. In the absence of objectivity, there is no knowledge and all private experiences of impressions of different individuals would be incommunicable.{{sfn|Jayatilleke|2013|pp=118-119}}

===Futility of knowledge ===

According to Silanka,

{{quote|The Sceptics... conceive that even if there was knowledge it is useless (''nisphalam'') since it has many disadvantages (''bahudosavat'').{{sfn|Jayatilleke|2013|pp=119}}}}

This quotation suggests that the Sceptics preferred scepticism not just on intellectual basis, but also for pragmatic or moral reasons. What these disadvantages are, Silanka does not elaborate, but can be found in the Buddhist sources.{{sfn|Jayatilleke|2013|pp=119}} Regarding the futility of knowledge, Silanka puts these questions of the Sceptics:

{{quote| Who knows that the soul exists? Of what use is this knowledge? Who knows that the soul does not exist? Of what use is this knowledge?{{sfn|Jayatilleke|2013|pp=119}} }}

The Sutrakrtanga affirms that the Sceptics "teach final beatitude and final deliverance." Thus, the Sceptics may have contended that knowledge is not necessary for salvation but ''tapas'', which seem similar to ''karmapatha''.{{sfn|Jayatilleke|2013|pp=125}}

===On psychological states===
Silanka in his commentary mentions sixty-seven types of Sceptics. However, these sixty-seven types are obtained combinatorially by taking nine categories (''navapadartha'') of Jainism, each with seven forms of predication (''saptabhangakah''), to give sixty-three (9 × 7) forms of sceptical questions, which were considered to represent sixty-three "types" of Sceptics asking these questions. The last four "types" were added to complete the list of sixty-seven types.{{sfn|Jayatilleke|2013|pp=121}} However, according to Jayatilleke, these last four "types" may represent the kind of questions the Sceptics themselves might have asked. The last four questions are:{{sfn|Jayatilleke|2013|pp=121}}
# Who knows whether there is an arising of psychological states?
# Who knows whether there is no arising of psychological states?
# Who knows whether there is and is no arising of psychological states?
# Who knows whether the arising of psychological states is impredicable?

Such psychological speculations seem to be rife during this era, as evinced in Pali Nikayas, especially the Potthapada Sutta.{{sfn|Jayatilleke|2013|pp=121}}

==Buddhist account==

In the Pali texts, the Sceptics are nicknamed ''Amarāvikkhepika''s, which translates as "eel-wrigglers," probably in reference to their "verbal jugglery." They are collectively spoken of as "some recluse and brahmins who wriggle like eels. For when a question is put to them on this or that matter, they resort to verbal jugglery and eel-wriggling on four grounds."{{sfn|Jayatilleke|p=122}} Brahmajala Sutta describes four schools of Scepticism, the first three of whom advocated Scepticism on the basis of fear of falsehood (''musavadabhaya''), fear of involvement (''upadanabhaya''), and fear of interrogation in debate (''anuyogabhaya''), respectively, which all of them considered undesirable since it led to remorse or worry, and which led to a moral danger.{{sfn|Jayatilleke|p=128}} While these three schools seem to have valued mental equanimity, it appears that the fourth school of Sceptics, associated with the philosopher [[Sanjaya Belatthiputta]], did not share this value.{{sfn|Jayatilleke|p=129}} A notable commonality among all these schools is the arrangement of propositions according to five-fold logic, alongside the usual two-fold mode and the four-fold mode ([[catuṣkoṭi]]) common in Pali Nikayas. The fifth mode is given as the denial of denials, that is, the rejection of the dialectician's view.{{sfn|Jayatilleke|p=134-140}}

===First school===
The first school is described in the ''Brahmajala Sutta'':
{{quote|Herein a certain recluse or brahmin does not understand, as it really is, that this is good or this is evil. And it occurs to him: I do not understand what is good or evil as it really is. Not understanding what is good or evil, as it really is, if I were to assert that this is good and this is evil, that will be due to my likes, desires, aversions, or resentments. If it were due to my likes, desires, aversions or resentments, it would be wrong. And if I were wrong, it would cause me worry (''vighato'') and worry would be a moral danger to me (''antarayo''). Thus, through fear of being wrong (''musavadabhaya'') and the abhorrence of being wrong, he does not assert anything to be good or evil and on questions being put to him on this or that matter he resorts to verbal jugglery and eel-wriggling, saying: I do not say so, I do not say thus, I do not  say otherwise, I do not say no, I deny the denials. (literally, I do not say "no, no").{{sfn|Jayatilleke|p=122-123}} }}

In the absence of adequate information, the Sceptics prudently recommend suspension of judgement. The Sceptics felt that it was not just intellectual dishonest, but also morally dangerous not to do so.{{sfn|Jayatilleke|p=123}} 
However, according to Jayatilleke, this was probably not a temporary suspension of judgement, until new information could come by to make a better evaluation; but rather it was meant to be a permanent state of affair by outright denying the very possibility of knowledge, and hence of questions regarding morality.{{sfn|Jayatilleke|p=123-124}} Thus, their Scepticism is motivated by both intellectual as well as moral reasoning (i.e. fear of asserting falsehood due to ones prejudices).{{sfn|Jayatilleke|p=124}} They seem to have contended that knowledge was not necessary for salvation but for ''karma-patha''. {{sfn|Jayatilleke|p=125}}

===Second School===
The second school of Sceptics is describe in Brahmajala Sutta in similar terms as the first, except that for them to be led to believe in a proposition by one's likes, desires, aversions, and resentments would be entanglement (''upadanam''), and such entanglement would be a source of worry (''vighato'') and as such a moral danger (''antarayo''). {{sfn|Jayatilleke|p=126}}

According to Jayatilleke, this group adopted Scepticism mainly due to morality, since to do so otherwise would lead to lead to worry and mental disquietude (''vighata''), and not necessarily due to the considerations of rebirth, as understood according to the Buddhist connotation of the word "entanglement".{{sfn|Jayatilleke|p=127}}

===Third School===
In Brahmajala Sutta, the third school of Scepticism is shown to put forward such arguments in support for their view point:

{{quote|I do not know, as it really is, what is good and what is evil and not knowing, if I were to pronounce that this is good or this is evil, then I would have to join issue, argue and debate with recluses and brahmins, learned, subtle, hair-splitters, skilled in controversy, who go about debunking with their intellect the theories of others. If I were to join issue, argue and debate with them, I would no be able to explain to them. If I were unable to explain to them, that would cause me worry (''vighata'') and be moral danger (''antarayo''). Thus because he fears and detests interrogation (''anuyoga'') he does not "pronouce this to be good nor that to be evil."{{sfn|Jayatilleke|p=127}}}}

According to Jayatilleke, it is not clear from this passage if they wished to avoid debate because they were Sceptics or whether they adopted Scepticism because they wanted to avoid debate. According to him, it is probable that "they would have seen no point in debate since one was nowhere nearer the truth at the end of it and at the same time feared debate because it could result in loss of their mental equanimity with they valued."{{sfn|Jayatilleke|p=128}}

===Fourth School===
The fourth school of Scepticism described in Brahmajala Sutta is associated with Sanjaya Belatthiputta, whose views are also recorded in the ''[[Samaññaphala Sutta]]'', since identical language is used to describe them.{{sfn|Jayatilleke|p=130-131}} Sanjaya is described as a contemporary of the Buddha, as a well-known and celebrated teacher, and as a leader of a sect who was held in high esteem by the common folk. He is said to have taught Sariputta and Moggallana, before their conversion to Buddhism. {{sfn|Jayatilleke|p=130-131}}

In Brahmajala Sutta, this fourth school of Sceptics is described as thus:

{{quote|Herein a certain recluse or brahmin is dull, stupid. And by reason of his dullness and stupidity, when questioned on this or that matter, he resorts to verbal jugglery or eel-wriggling: "If you ask me whether there is a next world, then if it were to occur to me (''iti ce me assa'') that there is a next world, I would pronounce that there is a next world. Yet, I do not say so, I do not say thus, I do not say otherwise, I do not say no, I deny the denials. Similarly with regard to the propositions, "there is no next world", "there is and is not a next world", "there neither is nor is not a next world", "there are beings who survive (death)", "there are no beings who survive", "there are and are no beings who survive", "there neither are nor are there no beings who survive", "there is a result and a consequence of good and evil actions", "there is no result or consequence of good or evil actions", "the Perfect One (Tathagato) exists after death", "the Perfect One does not exist after death", "the Perfect One both exists and does not exist after death", "the Perfect One neither exists nor does not exist after death""{{sfn|Jayatilleke|p=131}}  }}
A similar account is given in the ''Samaññaphala Sutta''. In both the accounts, the stupidity of this school is emphasised, highlighting the antipathy that the Buddhists felt about this school. In the ''Brahmajala Sutta'', out of sixty-two philosophical schools mentioned, this school is singled out as being "a product of sheer stupidity;" whereas in the ''Samaññaphala Sutta'', Ajatasattu singles out Sanjaya as "the most foolish and stupid."{{sfn|Jayatilleke|p=133}}

Notable in this account of the fourth school of Scepticism is the lack of concern for good life and peace of mind, which the previous three schools regarded as desirable, and hence their advocacy of scepticism. Jayatilleke states that Sanjaya may have been a more thorough-going sceptic, to the point of being sceptical about a sceptic's way of life, and as such might have been a more vocal critic of his opponents and their regard for mental tranquillity, valued by the Buddhists as well.{{sfn|Jayatilleke|p=133}} Judging by the propositions listed, Sanjaya's scepticism seems to have encompassed both metaphysics and morality. Sanjaya seems to grant the possibility of their truth, while denying the possibility of knowing this.{{sfn|Jayatilleke|p=134}}

==Criticisms==
The Jains criticised the Sceptics by pointing out that their scepticism should lead them to the conclusion that they know nothing whatsoever, yet they assert the knowledge of their scepticism and claim to know such propositions as "ignorance is best".{{sfn|Jayatilleke|2013|pp=117}} Silanka criticises the Sceptic's belief, that one cannot know what is on another's mind, saying "the inner mind of another can be apprehended by his external features, gestures, movements, gait, speech and the changes in his eyes and face."{{sfn|Jayatilleke|2013|pp=118}}

==Influence==
Although criticised by the Buddhists as eel-wrigglers, in the Pali canon, the Buddha is depicted negating various the four-fold logical alternatives or ''catuṣkoṭi'' when posed with metaphysical questions, which is similar to the logic employed by the Ajñanins. However, all four schools of Ajñanins arrange their logic as five-fold formula, which seems to be based on the acceptance of the four-fold formula. This may mean that such logical schema was a common feature of the pre-Buddhist era.{{sfn|Jayatilleke|2013|pp=135-138}} Alternatively, since there is no known school of Indian thinkers apart from the Buddhist who adopted a four-fold logical schema, and since all Sceptical schools are depicted to have the five-fold formula of denial, which seems to be based on the acceptance of a four-fold form of predication, this may suggest the four-fold schema to be the Buddhist invention.{{sfn|Jayatilleke|2013|pp=135-138}} Indeed, two of the foremost disciples of Buddha, [[Sariputta]] and [[Maudgalyayana|Moggallāna]], were initially the students of Sanjaya; and a strong element of skepticism is found in early Buddhism, most particularly in the [[Atthakavagga and Parayanavagga|Aṭṭhakavagga]] sutra. The catuṣkoṭi was later used as a tool by [[Nagarjuna]] to formulate his influential brand of [[Madhyamaka]] philosophy. Since skepticism is a philosophical attitude and a style of philosophising rather than a position, the Ajñanins may have influenced other skeptical thinkers of India like Nagarjuna, [[Jayarāśi Bhaṭṭa]], and [[Shriharsha]] .{{sfn|Matilal|2004|pp=52-75}}

According to [[Diogenes Laërtius]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.classicpersuasion.org/pw/diogenes/dlpyrrho.htm|title=classicpersuasion.org|author=|date=|website=www.classicpersuasion.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Greek philosopher [[Pyrrho]] developed [[Pyrrhonism|his skeptical philosophy]] in India when Pyrrho was there during the conquest of [[Alexander the Great]]. Based on the so-called  "Aristocles passage," Jayatilleke draws many similarities between his philosophy and the Indian philosophies current at the time. In particular, he lists the following:

{{quote|(1) There were no beliefs or opinions which were true or false and therefore (2) we should give no positive answer to any of the logical alternatives. It would also be seen that (3) the four logical alternatives mentioned in Timon's account (i.e. is, is not, both is and is not, neither is nor is not) are identical with that of Sanjaya, the Buddhists and perhaps also of the three schools of Sceptics... Lastly (4) the value of the sceptical attitude is said by Pyrrho to lie in the fact that it promotes speechlessness (aphasia) and mental imperturbability (ataraxia).{{sfn|Jayatilleke|2013|pp=130}} }}

Scholars including  Barua, Jayatilleke, and Flintoff, contend that Pyrrho was influenced by, or at the very least agreed with, Indian scepticism rather than Buddhism or Jainism, based on the fact that he valued [[ataraxia]], which can be translated as "freedom from worry".{{sfn|Barua|1921|p=299}}{{sfn|Jayatilleke|2013|pp=129-130}}{{sfn|Flintoff|1980}} Jayatilleke in particular contends that Pyrrho may have been influenced by the first three school of Ajñana, since they too valued freedom from worry.{{sfn|Jayatilleke|2013|pp=130}} If this is true, then the methods of the Ajñanins may be preserved in the extent work by [[Sextus Empiricus]].

[[File:ARO Plate 2 (Title page alternate).jpg|thumb|upright=0.70|One of two known impressions of the title page from ''All Religions are One'', printed ''c''1795]]
'''''All Religions are One''''' is a series of philosophical [[aphorism]]s by [[William Blake]], written in 1788. Following on from his initial experiments with [[William Blake#Relief etching|relief etching]] in the non-textual ''[[The Approach of Doom]]'' (1787), ''All Religions are One'' and ''[[There is No Natural Religion]]'' represent Blake's first successful attempt to combine image and text via relief etching, and are thus the earliest of his [[illuminated manuscript]]s. As such, they serve as a significant milestone in Blake's career; as [[Peter Ackroyd]] points out, "his newly invented form now changed the nature of his expression. It had enlarged his range; with relief etching, the words [[Epigraphy|inscribed]] like those of God upon the tables of law, Blake could acquire a new role."&lt;ref&gt;Ackroyd (1995: 115–16)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relief etching==
[[File:The Ghost of Abel (page 2).jpg|thumb|upright=0.70|left|Page 2 of ''The Ghost of Abel'' (1822); note the writing in the colophon at bottom right.]]
In 1822, Blake completed a short two-page dramatic piece which would prove to be the last of his illuminated manuscripts, entitled ''[[The Ghost of Abel|The Ghost of Abel A Revelation In the Visions of Jehovah Seen by William Blake]]''. Inscribed in the [[Colophon (publishing)|colophon]] of this text is "W Blakes Original [[Stereotype (printing)|Stereotype]] was 1788". It is almost universally agreed amongst Blakean scholars, that the "Original Stereotype" to which he here refers was ''All Religions are One'' and/or ''There is No Natural Religion''.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Bindman (1978: 468), Erdman (1982: 790); Ackroyd (1995: 115)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1770s, Blake had come to feel that one of the major problems with reproducing artwork in print was the division of labour by which it was achieved; one person would create a design (the artist), another would [[Engraving|engrave]] it (the engraver), another [[Printing|print]] it (the printer) and another [[Publishing|publish]] it (the publisher).&lt;ref name="Bindman (1978: 10)"&gt;Bindman (1978: 10)&lt;/ref&gt; It was unusual for artists to engrave their own designs, due primarily to the [[social status]] attached to each job; engraving was not seen as an especially exalted profession, and was instead regarded as nothing more than mechanical reproduction.&lt;ref name="Bindman (1978: 10)"/&gt; Artists like [[James Barry (painter)|James Barry]] and [[John Hamilton Mortimer]] were the exceptions to the norm insofar as they tended to engrave their own material.&lt;ref name="Bindman (1978: 10)"/&gt; A further division in the process was that text and images were handled by different artisans; text was printed by means of a movable [[Letterpress printing|letterpress]], whereas images were engraved, two very different jobs.&lt;ref&gt;Viscomi (2003: 41)&lt;/ref&gt;

During Blake's training as a professional copy engraver with [[James Basire]] during the 1770s, the most common method of engraving was [[stippling]], which was thought to give a more accurate impression of the original picture than the previously dominant method, [[line engraving]]. [[Etching]] was also commonly used for layering in such aspects as landscape and background.&lt;ref&gt;Bindman (1978: 12)&lt;/ref&gt; All traditional methods of engraving and etching were [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]], which meant that the design's outline was traced with a needle through an acid-resistant 'ground' which had been poured over the copperplate. The plate was then covered with acid, and the engraver went over the incised lines with a [[burin (engraving)|burin]] to allow the acid to bite into the furrows and eat into the copper itself. The acid would then be poured off, leaving the design incised on the plate. The engraver would then engrave the plate's entire surface with a web of [[Hatching|crosshatched lines]], before pouring the ink onto the plate and transferring it to the [[printing press]].&lt;ref&gt;Viscomi (2003: 37)&lt;/ref&gt;

Frustrated with this method, Blake seems to have begun thinking about a new method of publishing at least as early as 1784, as in that year a rough description of what would become relief etching appears in his unpublished satire, ''[[An Island in the Moon]]''. Around the same time, [[George Cumberland]] had been experimenting with a method to allow him to reproduce handwriting via an etched plate, and Blake incorporated Cumberland's method into his own relief etching; treating the text as handwritten script rather than mechanical letterpress, and thus allowing him to make it a component of the image.&lt;ref name="Bindman (1978: 13)"&gt;Bindman (1978: 13)&lt;/ref&gt;

Blake's great innovation in relief etching was to print from the relief, or raised, parts of the plate rather than the intaglio, or incised, parts. Whereas intaglio methods worked by creating furrows into which the acid was poured to create 'holes' in the plate and the ink then poured over the entire surface, Blake wrote and drew directly onto the plate with an acid-resistant material known as a stop-out. He would then embed the plate’s edges in strips of wax to create a self-contained tray and pour the acid about a quarter of an inch deep, thus causing the exposed parts of the plate to melt away, and the design and/or text to remain slightly above the rest of the plate, i.e. in relief, like a modern [[rubber stamp]]. The acid was then poured off, the wax was removed, and the raised part of the plate covered with ink before finally being pressed onto the paper in the printing press.&lt;ref&gt;The exact method is described in great detail in Joseph Viscomi, ''Blake and the Idea of the Book'' (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1993), chapters 4 and 18&lt;/ref&gt; This method allowed expressive effects which were impossible to achieve via intaglio.&lt;ref&gt;See Bindman (1978), Bindman (2000) and Viscomi (2003) for more specific information.&lt;/ref&gt; The major disadvantage was that text had to be written backwards as whatever was on the plate would print in reverse when pressed onto the paper. The dominant theory as to how Blake solved this problem is simply that he [[Mirror writing|wrote in reverse]].&lt;ref&gt;Viscomi (2003: 43)&lt;/ref&gt; Another theory, suggested by David Bindman, is that Blake wrote his (acid resistant) text on a sheet of paper the correct way around, and then pressed the paper onto the plate, thus reversing the text and producing the same result as if had he written it backwards in the first place.&lt;ref name="Bindman (1978: 13)"/&gt;

Blake could also colour the plates themselves in coloured inks before pressing them or tint them with [[Watercolor painting|watercolours]] after printing. Because of this aspect, a major component of relief etching was that every page of every book was a unique piece of art; no two copies of any page in Blake's entire ''oeuvre'' are identical. Variations in the actual print, different colouring choices, repainted plates, accidents during the acid bath etc., all led to multiple examples of the same plate.

Blake himself referred to relief etching as "printing in the infernal method, by means of corrosives [...] melting apparent surfaces away, and displaying the infinite which was hid."&lt;ref&gt;From ''[[The Marriage of Heaven and Hell]]'' (1790); Plate 6&lt;/ref&gt; A contemporary description of the method was provided by Blake's friend, [[John Thomas Smith (engraver)|J.T. Smith]]; "writing his poetry, and drawing his marginal subjects of embellishments in outline upon the copper-plate with an impervious liquid, and then eating the plain parts or lights away with [[Nitric acid|aquafortis]] considerably below them so that the outlines were left as Stereotype."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Bindman (1978: 14)&lt;/ref&gt;

Relief etching was the same basic method used for [[woodcut]]ting, and copper relief etching had been practised in the early eighteenth century by [[Elisha Kirkall]], but Blake was the first to use such a method to create both words and designs mixed together on the same plate.&lt;ref name="Bindman 1978: 14"&gt;Bindman (1978: 14)&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from the unique aesthetic effects possible, a major advantage of relief etching was that Blake could print the material himself. Because the text was in relief, the pressure needed for printing was constant, unlike in intaglio printing, where different pressures were needed to force the paper into the furrows, depending on size. Additionally, intaglio etchings and engravings were printed with great pressure, but in relief etching, because the printed material was a raised surface rather than incised lines, considerably less pressure was required.&lt;ref&gt;Bindman (2000: 7)&lt;/ref&gt; As such, relief etching tackled the problem of the division of labour of publishing. Blake's new method was autographic; "it permitted – indeed promoted – a seamless relationship between conception and execution rather than the usual divisions between invention and production embedded in eighteenth-century print technology, and its economic and social distinctions among authors, printers, artists and engravers. Like drawings and manuscripts, Blake's relief etchings were created by the direct and positive action of the author/artist's hand without intervening processes."&lt;ref&gt;Eaves ''et al.'' (1993: 9)&lt;/ref&gt; Blake served as artist, engraver, printer ''and'' publisher.

==Copy==
Although ''All Religions are One'' was etched in 1788, the only surviving copy (known as Copy A) was not printed until 1795; a large paper copy printed as part of a deluxe edition of Blake's collected illuminated manuscripts. Whether he had printed ''All Religions'' prior to 1795 is unknown. However, the fact that it is not mentioned in his 'To the Public' address of October 1793, where he listed all of his extant manuscripts up to that time except ''All Religions'' and ''No Natural Religion'', would suggest he had not.&lt;ref name="ARO Intro"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blakearchive.org/exist/blake/archive/work.xq?workid=aro&amp;java=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061003052150/http://www.blakearchive.org/exist/blake/archive/work.xq?workid=aro&amp;java=yes |dead-url=yes |archive-date=3 October 2006 |title=Introduction |author= |date= |work=All Religions are One |publisher=[[William Blake Archive]] |accessdate=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Copy A is located in [[Huntington Library|The Huntington Library]], except Plate 2 (title page), which exists in two impressions. The copy of the title page which goes with Copy A is located in the [[Geoffrey Keynes]] Collection in the [[Fitzwilliam Museum]]. The title page from another copy (colour printed in brown ink), the additional plates of which are unrecorded, is in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]].

''All Religions are One'' comprises ten plates, each of which is roughly 5.4 X 4&amp;nbsp;cm.,&lt;ref name="Eaves ''et al'' (1993: 21)"&gt;Eaves ''et al.'' (1993: 21)&lt;/ref&gt; with each paragraph on a separate plate, except Plate 10, which contains both Principal 7&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt; and a short paragraph which functions as a conclusion to the series. In numerous cases, it seems as if the acid has eaten away too much of the relief, and Blake has had to go over sections with ink and [[Wash (painting)|wash]], often touching the text and design outlines with pen.&lt;ref name="Bindman 1978: 14"/&gt; Several of the plates also bear evidence of rudimentary colour printing, a method with which Blake was experimenting in the 1790s, and these plates may represent his first attempts at this technique (whereby he used coloured inks to print rather than black). Several of the plates also feature examples of [[Woodcut#White-line woodcut|white line engraving]], a technique where Blake would literally cut into the stop-out to create tiny furrows, which would be eaten away by the acid, creating a streak effect in the final print.

The black ink framing lines drawn around each design are thought to have been added at a later date, possibly in 1818, just prior to Blake giving the plates to [[John Linnell]]. The ink and wash work in the designs themselves may also have been executed at that time, although this cannot be ascertained for certain.&lt;ref name="ARO Intro" /&gt; It has been suggested that the framing lines may have been added due to the discrepancy between the size of the plates and the size of the paper (each sheet is 37.8 x 27&amp;nbsp;cm.).&lt;ref name="Eaves ''et al'' (1993: 21)"/&gt;
 
Plates 1 and 3–10 of the Huntington copy were acquired by John Linnell some time after 1818, with the missing title page replaced by an impression of the title page from ''There is No Natural Religion''. The plates were sold from the Linnell estate on 15 March 1918 to [[Henry E. Huntington]]. Plate 2 was acquired by [[George A. Smith]] in 1853. It may have subsequently been owned by [[William Muir]], but was ultimately sold at [[Sotheby's]] by Sir [[Hickman Bacon]] on 21 July 1953, to Geoffrey Keynes, who donated it to the Fitzwilliam Museum in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blakearchive.org/blake/copy/aro.a |title=Copy Information |author= |date= |work=All Religions are One |publisher=The William Blake Archive |accessdate=15 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the original 1795 printing, the text of ''All Religions'' was not published again until 1893, in ''The Works of William Blake, Poetic, Symbolic and Critical'', edited by [[W. B. Yeats|W.B. Yeats]] and [[Edwin Ellis (poet)|E.J. Ellis]].&lt;ref&gt;Keynes (1966: 886)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dating==
Until 1971, most editors tended to consider ''All Religions are One'' as later than ''There is No Natural Religion''. For example, in his 1905 book ''The poetical works of William Blake; a new and verbatim text from the manuscript engraved and letterpress originals'', [[John Sampson (linguist)|John Sampson]] places ''No Natural Religion'' prior to ''All Religions'' in his 'Appendix to the Prophetic Books'. However, in 1971, Geoffrey Keynes argued that ''All Religions are One'' was the earlier of the two, based on what he saw as its "greater technical imperfection."&lt;ref name="Erdman (1982: 789)"&gt;Erdman (1982: 789)&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1978 book, ''The Complete Graphic Works of William Blake'', David Bindman initially disagreed with Keynes, arguing that the imperfections in ''All Religions'' are not because of an earlier date of composition, but because of the increased complexity of the plates, with such complexity demonstrating Blake growing in confidence from the more rudimentary plates for ''No Natural Religion''.&lt;ref name="Bindman (1978: 468)"&gt;Bindman (1978: 468)&lt;/ref&gt; Most scholars however support Keynes, and ''All Religions are One'' precedes ''There is No Natural Religion'' in almost all modern anthologies of Blake's work; for example, [[Alicia Ostriker]]'s ''William Blake: The Complete Poems'' (1977), [[David V. Erdman]]'s 2nd edition of ''The Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake'' (1982), Morris Eaves', Robert N. Essick's and Joseph Viscomi's ''Blake's Illuminated Books, Volume 3: The Early Illuminated Books'' (1993), even Bindman's own ''The Complete Illuminated Books of William Blake'' (2003), and W.H. Stevenson's 3rd edition of ''Blake: The Complete Poems'' (2007).

Further evidence for Keynes hypothesis is discussed by Eaves, Essick and Viscomi, who, in counterpoint to Bindman, see the style of ''No Natural Religion'' as more confident than that of ''All Religions''. They especially cite the use of upright [[Latin alphabet|roman lettering]] in ''All Religions'' contrasted with the [[Italic script|italic]], [[cursive]] writing on several plates of ''No Natural Religion''; "this style was easier to execute since it required fewer independent strokes. And since the resulting dense matrix of lines provided better support for the inking dabber, italic permitted a shallower etch."&lt;ref&gt;Eaves ''et al.'' (1993: 12)&lt;/ref&gt; Blake introduced italic script on plate a3 of ''No Natural Religion'', a script which he would use throughout the 1790s.&lt;ref name="Eaves ''et al'' (1993: 21)"/&gt; Other evidence for an earlier dating of ''All Religions'' is that many of the individual letters themselves lean to the left, unlike in ''No Natural Religion''. This was a common problem in mirror writing, and its presence in ''All Religions'' but not ''No Natural Religion'' suggests Blake was only learning how to overcome it as he worked.

==Content==
When analysing ''All Religions are One'' it is important to remember that the images are not necessarily literal depictions of the text; "the philosophical propositions [...] offer little visual imagery or even named objects. These qualities may have determined the relative independence of many of the designs from the accompanying text. The links are thematic and metaphoric, not direct and literal."&lt;ref&gt;Eaves ''et al.'' (1993: 14)&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it is also worth noting that the angel embraces the man with his left hand and the tablets with his right, thus suggesting a spiritual union between the man of prophecy (Blake himself) and the foundational text of orthodox Christianity.&lt;ref name="Eaves ''et al'' (1993: 34)"/&gt;

==Interpretation==
The central concern in ''All Religions are One'' is the notion of the "Poetic Genius", which is roughly analogous to the imagination. Blake argues that the Poetic Genius is greater than all else and "is the true man." The Poetic Genius thus replaces traditional concepts of divinity insofar as "The body or outward form of Man is derived from the Poetic Genius [...] the forms of all things are derived from their Genius. which by the Ancients was call'd an Angel &amp; Spirit &amp; Demon." Thus, the Poetic Genius supplants theological belief. This Poetic Genius is universal, common to all Mankind; "as all men are alike in outward form [...] all men are alike in the Poetic Genius." Similarly, all philosophies are derived from the Poetic Genius; "all sects of Philosophies are from the Poetic Genius adapted to the weaknesses of every individual", and so too are all religions, which are merely expressions of the Poetic Genius; "the Religions of all Nations are derived from each Nations different reception of the Poetic Genius which is everywhere call'd the Spirit of Prophecy," again emphasising the theological character of the Poetic Genius. Even the Bible originates with the Poetic Genius; "The Jewish &amp; Christian Testaments are An original derivation from the Poetic Genius." Thus, as all Men are alike in their Poetic Genius, and as all religions originate with the Poetic Genius, so too must all religions be alike, thus all religions are one.

David Bindman classifies ''All Religions are One'' as "a rather abstract dialogue with conventional [[theology]],"&lt;ref&gt;Eaves ''et al.'' (1993: 7)&lt;/ref&gt;  and in this sense, it is often interpreted as Blake's earliest engagement with [[deism]] and [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]].&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Ostriker (1977: 877), Bindman (1978: 468), Harold Bloom, "Commentary" in Erdman (1982: 894) or Damon (1988: 16)&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Northrop Frye]] argues that Blake's theory that all religions are one is a "visionary tolerance" at odds with the "rational tolerance" of deism "which holds that all religions are equally an attempt to solve an insoluble mystery."&lt;ref&gt;Frye (1947: 345)&lt;/ref&gt; Working along the same lines, Florence Sandler argues that in these texts Blake "set himself to the task of separating true religion from its perversions in his own age and in the Bible itself."&lt;ref&gt;Sandler (1990: 43)&lt;/ref&gt; Also concentrating on the refutation of deism, Alicia Ostriker refers to the series as a "mockery of [[rationalism]] and an insistence on Man's potential infinitude."&lt;ref&gt;Ostriker (1977: 877)&lt;/ref&gt; [[S. Foster Damon]] suggests that what Blake has done in ''All Religions are One'' is "dethroned [[reason]] from its ancient place as the supreme faculty of man, replacing it with the Imagination."&lt;ref&gt;Damon (1988: 343)&lt;/ref&gt; Damon also argues that "Blake had completed his revolutionary theory of the nature of Man and proclaimed the unity of all true religions."&lt;ref&gt;Damon (1988: 16)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harold Bloom]] reaches much the same conclusion, suggesting that Blake is arguing for the "primacy of the poetic imagination over all [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] and moral systems."&lt;ref&gt;Harold Bloom, "Commentary" in Erdman (1982: 894)&lt;/ref&gt; A similar conclusion is reached by Denise Vultee, who argues that "the two tractates are part of Blake's lifelong quarrel with the philosophy of Bacon, Newton, and Locke. Rejecting the rational empiricism of eighteenth-century deism or "[[Natural theology|natural religion]]", which looked to the material world for evidence of God's existence, Blake offers as an alternative the imaginative faculty or "Poetic Genius"."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blakearchive.org/blake/staticpage/biography?p=biography |title= Illuminated Printing and other Illustrated Books, 1789-1792 |author= Denise Vultee  |date= |work=William Blake (1757-1827) |publisher=The William Blake Archive |accessdate=15 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of influences on Blake, in 1787 [[Henry Fuseli]] was working on a translation of [[Johann Kaspar Lavater|J.C. Lavater]]'s ''[[Aphorisms on Man]]'' for the publisher [[Joseph Johnson (publisher)|Joseph Johnson]], when he hired Blake to engrave the frontispiece. Blake became so enamoured of Lavater's work that on the inside cover of his own copy of the book, he inscribed both his name and Lavater's, and drew a heart encompassing them.&lt;ref&gt;Ackroyd (1995: 107)&lt;/ref&gt; Blake also extensively annotated his own copy of ''Aphorisms'', and a number of critics have noted parallels between the Lavater annotations and Blake's own aphorisms in both ''All Religions'' and ''No Natural Religion''.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Hilton (2003: 195)&lt;/ref&gt; S. Foster Damon specifically points to Lavater's first two aphorisms as having a strong influence on Blake;&lt;ref&gt;Damon (1988: 16–17)&lt;/ref&gt;

# Know, in the first place, that mankind agree in essence, as they do in their limbs and senses.
# Mankind differ as much in essence as they do in form, limbs, and senses – and only so, and not more".

To these points Blake has annotated "This is true Christian philosophy far above all abstraction."

Another work which may also have influenced him is [[Emanuel Swedenborg]]'s ''[[Heaven and Hell (Swedenborg)|Heaven and Hell]]'' (1758). In his annotations to Swedenborg, Blake twice connects the word "Lord" with "Poetic Genius". During Swedenborg's discussion of the connection between the spiritual world and the natural world, Blake writes "He who Loves feels love descend into him &amp; if he has wisdom may perceive it is from the Poetic Genius which is the Lord." Shortly thereafter, to Swedenborg's "the negation of God constitutes Hell", Blake annotates "the negation of the Poetic Genius."&lt;ref&gt;Both quotations taken from Erdman (1982: 603)&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Lavater and Swedenborg influences are somewhat speculative, the importance of Bacon, Newton and Locke is not, as it is known that Blake despised empiricism from an early age. In 1808, as he annotated ''The Works of Sir Joshua Reynolds'', Blake wrote

{{quote|[[Edmund Burke|Burke's]] [[A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful|Treatise on the Sublime &amp; Beautiful]] is founded on the Opinions of Newton &amp; Locke on this Treatise Reynolds has grounded many of his assertions. in all his Discourses I read Burkes Treatise when very Young at the same time I read Locke on [[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding|Human Understanding]] &amp; Bacons [[The Advancement of Learning|Advancement of Learning]] on Every one of these Books I wrote my Opinions &amp; on looking them over find that my Notes on Reynolds in this Book are exactly Similar. I felt the Same Contempt &amp; Abhorrence then; that I do now. They mock Inspiration &amp; Vision Inspiration &amp; Vision was then &amp; now is &amp; I hope will always Remain my Element my Eternal Dwelling place. how can I then hear it Contemnd without returning Scorn for Scorn}}

Harold Bloom also cites the work of [[Anthony Collins]], [[Matthew Tindal]] and [[John Toland]] as having an influence on Blake's thoughts.&lt;ref&gt;Harold Bloom, ''Blake's Apocalypse'' (Garden City: Doubleday,  1963), 25&lt;/ref&gt; In a more general sense, "Blake sees the school of Bacon and Locke as the foundation of natural religion, the deistic attempt to prove the existence of God on the basis of sensate experience and its rational investigation."&lt;ref name="Eaves ''et al'' (1993: 27)"&gt;Eaves ''et al.'' (1993: 27)&lt;/ref&gt; To that end, Blake "manipulates the [[Syncretism|syncretic]] mythology of [[Jacob Bryant]], [[Paul Henri Mallet]], and perhaps other founders of what has become the comparative study of religion, to argue for the existence of a universal and supra-rational 'Poetic Genius' that expresses itself through the shared (though ever various) forms of all religions."&lt;ref name="Eaves ''et al'' (1993: 27)"/&gt;

In relation to his later work, Northrop Frye sees ''All Religions are One'' and ''There is No Natural Religion'' as forming a fundamental statement of intent for Blake, a kind of pre-emptive outline of his future work, "a summarised statement of the doctrines of the engraved canon."&lt;ref&gt;Frye (1947: 14)&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Eaves, Essick and Viscomi state that they "contain some of Blake's most fundamental principles and reveal the foundation for later development in his thought and art."&lt;ref name="Eaves ''et al'' (1993: 21)"/&gt; W.H. Stevenson calls them "a very early statement of fundamental opinions [Blake] held all his life."&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson (2007: 55)&lt;/ref&gt; As an example of how Blake returned to the specific themes of ''All Religions'', in ''The Marriage of Heaven and Hell'' (1790), he writes "the Poetic Genius was the first principle and all the others merely derivative" (12:22–24).

In [[biology]], an '''atavism''' is a modification of a biological structure whereby an ancestral [[Trait (biological)|trait]] reappears after having been lost through [[evolution]]ary change in previous generations.&lt;ref name="Briankhall1"&gt;{{Citation | title=Developmental mechanisms underlying the atavisms| author=Brian K. Hall| journal=Biological Reviews| year=1984| volume=59| issue=| pages=89–124| url=| doi=10.1111/j.1469-185x.1984.tb00402.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atavisms can occur in several ways;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Tomic|first1=Nenad| last2= Meyer-Rochow|first2= Victor Benno| year= 2011|title= Atavisms  -  medical, genetic, and evolutionary implications|journal= Perspectives in Biology and Medicine|volume=54 | issue = 3 | pages= 332–353| doi=10.1353/pbm.2011.0034}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of which is when [[gene]]s for previously existing [[phenotype|phenotypic]] features are preserved in [[DNA]], and these become expressed through a [[mutation]] that either knocks out the overriding genes for the new traits or makes the old traits override the new one.&lt;ref name="Briankhall1"/&gt; A number of traits can vary as a result of shortening of the [[prenatal development|fetal development]] of a trait ([[neoteny]]) or by prolongation of the same. In such a case, a shift in the time a trait is allowed to develop before it is fixed can bring forth an ancestral phenotype.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Held, L.| year=2009 | title= Quirks of Human Anatomy, an Evo-Devo Look at the Human Body | publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]] | isbn=978-0-521-73233-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atavisms are often seen as [[evidence of common descent|evidence of evolution]].&lt;ref name="Briankhall2"/&gt;

In [[social science]]s, atavism is the tendency of reversion. For example, people in the modern era reverting to the ways of thinking and acting of a former time. The word ''atavism'' is derived from the [[Latin]] ''atavus''—a great-great-great-grandfather or, more generally, an ancestor.

==Biology==
Evolutionarily traits that have disappeared phenotypically do not necessarily disappear from an organism's DNA. The gene sequence often remains, but is inactive. Such an unused gene may remain in the genome for many generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Collin | first1 = R.| last2 = Cipriani | first2 = R.| year = 2003| title = Dollo's law and the re-evolution of shell coiling| journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society B| volume = 270 | issue = 1533 | pages = 2551–2555| doi = 10.1098/rspb.2003.2517| pmc = 1691546| pmid = 14728776}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Tomic|first1=Nenad| last2= Meyer-Rochow|first2= Victor Benno| year= 2011|title= Atavisms  -  medical, genetic, and evolutionary implications|journal= Perspectives in Biology and Medicine|volume=54 | issue = 3 | pages= 332–353| doi=10.1353/pbm.2011.0034}}&lt;/ref&gt; As long as the gene remains intact, a fault in the genetic control suppressing the gene can lead to it being expressed again. Sometimes, the expression of dormant genes can be induced by artificial stimulation.

Atavisms have been observed in humans, such as with infants born with [[vestigial tail]]s (called a "coccygeal process", "coccygeal projection", or "caudal appendage").&lt;ref name="talkorigins"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/comdesc/section2.html#atavisms|title=29+ Evidences for Macroevolution: Part 2|author=TalkOrigins Archive|authorlink=TalkOrigins Archive|accessdate=2006-11-08| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061029220608/http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/comdesc/section2.html| archivedate= 29 October 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atavism can also be seen in humans who possess large teeth, like those of other primates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/feb/15/opinion/ed-tails15|title=What our tails tell us|journal=Los Angeles Times|date=2007-02-15|accessdate=2009-03-08|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090312093607/http://articles.latimes.com/2007/feb/15/opinion/ed-tails15|archivedate=12 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, a case of "snake heart", the presence of "coronary circulation and myocardial architecture [which resemble] those of the reptilian heart", has also been reported in medical literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Walia | first1 = I. | last2 = Arora | first2 = H.

(For reviews see Jacobs and Rowe 2004 and Surridge et al. 2003.) This added a new red-green opponent channel to the existing yellow-blue channel. On the Reduction View, human red-green dichromacy can accordingly be thought of as something of an atavistic glimpse of our distant evolutionary history. If misperception is widespread among human red-green dichromats, then presumably it also is among the many dichromatic mammals who share versions of the ancient yellow-blue system of color vision. | page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Atavism is a term in [[Joseph Schumpeter]]'s explanation of [[World War I]] in twentieth-century [[Liberalism|liberal]] [[Europe]]. He defends the [[liberal international relations theory]] that an international society built on commerce will avoid war because of war's destructiveness and comparative cost. His reason for World War I is termed "atavism", in which he asserts that senescent governments in Europe (those of the [[German Empire]], [[Russian Empire]], [[Ottoman Empire]], and [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]) pulled the liberal Europe into war, and that the liberal regimes of the other continental powers did not cause it. He used this idea to say that [[liberalism]] and commerce would continue to have a soothing effect in international relations, and that war would not arise between nations which are connected by commercial ties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | chapter=Imperialism and Capitalism | title=Imperialism and Social Classes | author=[[Joseph Schumpeter]] | place=Cleveland | publisher=The World Publishing Company | year=1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[University of London]] professor [[Guy Standing (economist)|Guy Standing]] has identified three distinct sub-groups of the [[precariat]], one of which he refers to as "atavists", who long for what they see as a lost past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/11/precariat-global-class-rise-of-populism|title=Meet the precariat, the new global class fuelling the rise of populism|author=Guy Standing|date=2016-11-09|publisher=World Economic Forum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social Darwinism===
During the interval between the acceptance of [[evolution]] in the mid-1800s and the rise of the modern understanding of [[genetics]] in the early 1900s, atavism was used to account for the reappearance in an individual of a trait after several generations of absence—often called a "throw-back".{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} The idea that atavisms could be made to accumulate by [[selective breeding]], or [[breeding back]], led to breeds such as the [[Heck cattle]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} This had been bred from ancient [[landrace]]s with selected primitive traits, in an attempt of "reviving" the [[aurochs]], an [[extinct]] species of wild [[cattle]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} The same notions of atavisms were used by [[social Darwinism|social Darwinists]], who claimed that inferior [[Race (classification of human beings)|races]] displayed atavistic traits, and represented more primitive traits than their own race.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} Both atavisms and [[Ernst Haeckel]]'s [[recapitulation theory]] are related [[evolutionary progress]], as development towards greater complexity and superior ability.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

In addition, the concept of atavism as part of an individualistic explanation of the causes of criminal deviance was popularised by the Italian criminologist [[Cesare Lombroso]] in the 1870s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.criminology.fsu.edu/crimtheory/lombroso.htm |title=Lombroso and the pathological perspective can be traced back to the 19th Century following a history of demonic and classical perspectives |publisher=Criminology.fsu.edu |date=2000-11-27 |accessdate=2013-12-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130923231227/http://www.criminology.fsu.edu/crimtheory/lombroso.htm |archivedate=2013-09-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He attempted to identify physical characteristics common to criminals and labeled those he found as atavistic, 'throw-back' traits that determined 'primitive' criminal behavior. His statistical evidence and the closely related idea of [[eugenics]] have long since been abandoned by the scientific community, but the concept that physical traits may affect the likelihood of criminal or unethical behavior in a person still has some scientific support.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Haselhuhn | first1 = M.

'''Bibledit''' is series of related [[open source software|open source]] software projects for editing and translating the [[Bible]]. Bibledit is free software.

== History ==

Bibledit [[Software development|development]] started in 2003.&lt;ref name=start&gt;[https://sites.google.com/site/bibledit/community/development Bibledit Development]&lt;/ref&gt;

The word "Bibledit" is a portmanteau of the words "Bible" and "edit". 

Bibledit was first hosted on [[SourceForge]].&lt;ref name=sourceforge1&gt;[https://sourceforge.net/projects/bibledit First Bibledit project on SourceForge]&lt;/ref&gt;

== First generation ==

Bibledit-Gtk was the first generation of the software. It runs on the [[Desktop environment|desktop]].&lt;ref name=bibleditgtk&gt;[https://sites.google.com/site/bibledit Bibledit-Gtk documentation]&lt;/ref&gt; Like all Bibledit programs, its source code is public,&lt;ref name=bibleditgtksource&gt;[https://github.com/teusbenschop/bibledit Bibledit-Gtk hosting on Savannah]&lt;/ref&gt; and it can be freely downloaded.&lt;ref name=bibleditgtkdownload&gt;[http://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/bibledit/source/gtk Bibledit-Gtk downloads]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Second generation ==

The second generation of Bibledit focused on the [[World Wide Web|web]].

Bibledit-Web is a Bible editor that runs on the [[World Wide Web|web]], allowing users to edit the Bible from a [[web browser]]. The source code is public,&lt;ref name=bibleditweb&gt;[https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/bibledit-web Bibledit-Web hosting on Savannah]&lt;/ref&gt; and freely downloadable.&lt;ref name=bibleditwebdownload&gt;[http://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/bibledit-web Bibledit-Web downloads]&lt;/ref&gt;

Several version of the software have been built to work with other Bible software. Bibledit-Xiphos&lt;ref name=bibleditxiphosdownload&gt;[http://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/bibledit/source/xiphos Bibledit-Xiphos downloads]&lt;/ref&gt; and Bibledit-BibleTime&lt;ref name=bibleditbibletimedownload&gt;[http://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/bibledit/source/bibletime Bibledit-BibleTime downloads]&lt;/ref&gt; work with different versions of [[The SWORD Project]]. Versions also exist for BibleWorks,&lt;ref name=bibleditbibleworksdownload&gt;[http://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/bibledit/binaries Downloads for Bibledit-BibleWorks]&lt;/ref&gt; Paratext,&lt;ref name=bibleditparatextdownload&gt;[http://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/bibledit/binaries Downloads for Bibledit-Paratext]&lt;/ref&gt; and OnlineBible.&lt;ref name=bibleditonlinebibledownload&gt;[http://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/bibledit/binaries Downloads for Bibledit-OnlineBible]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Third generation ==

The third generation of Bibledit focuses on [[cloud computing]] and multiple computing devices. It is actively being developed and maintained. The source code is public.

Similar to Bibledit-Web, Bibledit Cloud on the web, allowing users to edit the Bible from a web browser.&lt;ref name=bibleditlib&gt;[https://github.com/teusbenschop/bibledit/tree/master/lib Bibledit Cloud hosting on github]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bibleditclouddownload&gt;[http://bibledit.org/cloud Bibledit Cloud downloads]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Offline versions are available for Windows,&lt;ref name=windowsdownload&gt;[http://bibledit.org/windows Downloads for Bibledit for Windows]&lt;/ref&gt; Mac [[OS X]], [[Linux]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]], and [[IOS (Apple)|iOS]]. Users can edit the Bible from a web browser or app while off-line, and then synchronize the changes with Bibledit Cloud. The Android version is installed via [[Google Play]].&lt;ref name=googleplay&gt;[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.bibledit.android Bibledit for Android on Google Play]&lt;/ref&gt; iOS installation is through the [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]].&lt;ref name=iosstore&gt;[http://itunes.com/apps/bibledit Bibledit for iOS on the App Store]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage ==

The Bibledit translation software is known to and used by people involved in Bible translation and production.

[[SIL International]] includes Bibledit in their list of software and fonts.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sil.org/resources/software_fonts/bibledit&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Adapt It]] translation software can exchange files with Bibledit.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.adapt-it.org/Help_for_Administrators.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bible society of [[Baptist Mid-Missions]] has made a Bibledit Windows port for their translators.&lt;ref&gt;http://biblesint.org/biNew/bibledit&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pioneer Bible Translators]] wrote in-depth reviews of Bibledit.&lt;ref&gt;https://map.bloomfire.com/posts/1041843-bibledit-now-translation-teams-can-edit-scripture-on-any-device &amp;ndash; Published 2015-10-03 (accessed 2016-01-12)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://map.bloomfire.com/posts/1330010-update-on-bibledit&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edward Jonathan Lowe''' ({{IPAc-en|l|oʊ}}; 24 March 1950 – 5 January 2014), usually cited as '''E. J. Lowe''' but known personally as '''Jonathan Lowe''', was a British [[philosopher]] and academic. He was Professor of Philosophy at [[Durham University]], [[England]].&lt;ref name="durham"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dur.ac.uk/philosophy/ejlowepages|title=The E. J. Lowe Page|work=Durham University|accessdate=1 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Lowe was born in [[Dover]], [[England]].&lt;ref name="durham" /&gt; His secondary education was at [[Bushey Grammar School]], and he subsequently studied at the [[University of Cambridge]], 1968-72 (BA in History, 1st Class), and the [[University of Oxford]], 1972-75 (BPhil and DPhil in Philosophy).&lt;ref name="cv"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ontology.buffalo.edu/06/Lowe/Vita.html|title=C.V. circa 2005|accessdate=1 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Lowe was one of the leading philosophers of his generation.&lt;ref name="THE"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/people/jonathan-lowe-1950-2014/2010845.article|title=THE Obituary|accessdate=1 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He mainly researched and published in [[metaphysics]], [[philosophy of mind]], [[philosophical logic]], and the history of early modern philosophy.&lt;ref name="durham" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cv" /&gt;&lt;ref name="THE" /&gt; He supervised many PhD students, working on a wide variety of topics.&lt;ref name="cv" /&gt;

One of his contributions was a sophisticated defense of [[dualistic interactionism]] in the philosophy of mind. This, the view that the mind and the brain are distinct substances, and that facts about each are "causally relevant" to the other, is rare in contemporary philosophy.

[[File:Elia del Medigo 2.jpg|180px|thumbnail|right|Elia del Medigo]]

'''Elia del Medigo''', also called '''Elijah Delmedigo''' or '''Elias ben Moise del Medigo''' and sometimes known to his contemporaries as '''Helias Hebreus Cretensis''' or in Hebrew '''Elijah Mi-Qandia''' (c. 1458&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; c. 1493). According to Jacob Joshua Ross, "while the non-Jewish students of Delmedigo may have classified him as an “[[Averroism|Averroist]]”, he clearly saw himself as a follower of Maimonides". But, according to other scholars, Delmedigo was clearly a strong follower of Averroes' doctrines, even the more radical ones: unity of intellect, eternity of the world, autonomy of reason from the boundaries of revealed religion.

Born in [[Heraklion|Candia]], on the island of [[Crete]], (at that time was under the control of the [[Venetian Republic]]), whither his family had emigrated from [[Germany]], he spent ten years in [[Rome]] and in [[Padua]] in northern [[Italy]], returning to Candia at the end of his life.

He is remembered for a number of translations, commentaries on [[Averroes]] ([[Ibn Rushd]] in Arabic) (notably a commentary on [[Averroes]]' ''Substantia Orbis'' in 1485), for his influence on many Italian [[Platonists]] of the early [[Renaissance]] (especially Giovanni [[Pico della Mirandola]]), and for his treatise on Jewish philosophy, ''Sefer Beḥinat ha-Dat'' (''The Examination of Religion''), published many years after his death, in 1629.

==Biography==
Del Medigo had a traditional religious upbringing in Candia, demonstrating considerable breadth.  In addition to rabbinic learning, he studied philosophy, and had a good knowledge of Italian, [[Greek language|Greek]], as well as [[Latin]] and [[Hebrew]].  It is likely that he also studied medicine, and it may have been with that intention that he originally went to [[Padua]], where the University was the most important center for traditional [[Aristotelian philosophy]] in Italy.  By 1480, he was in [[Venice]], where he wrote ''Quaestio utrum mundus sit effectus'', and supported himself by giving classes in [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] philosophy attended by the sons of wealthy and important families.

He moved to [[Perugia]] and taught classes in "radical Aristotelianism," that is, heavily interpreted with the ideas of [[Averroes]] and other Islamic commentators.  Del Medigo became quite well known as a major [[Averroist]] in Italy.  While in Perugia, he met [[Pico della Mirandola|Pico]], and wrote two pamphlets for him.

Another important student of del Medigo's at that time was [[Domenico Grimani]], a Venetian, who eventually became the [[Cardinal (Catholic)|Cardinal]] of [[San Marco]].  Grimani proved to be a consistent patron, and with his encouragement, del Medigo wrote several manuscripts which received wide distribution among Italian philosophers.

He stayed in close contact with [[Pico della Mirandola|Pico]], traveling to [[Florence]], the site of [[Marsilio Ficino]]'s Platonic Academy, to give classes and to translate manuscripts from Hebrew to Latin for Pico.

In the end, however, Del Medigo was no [[Kabbalist]], and he became disenchanted with the [[syncretic]] direction Pico and his colleagues were moving in, a tendency to combine concepts of magic, [[Hermeticism]] and [[Kabbalah]] with [[Plato]] and [[Neoplatonism]].

In addition to his increasing disappointment with Pico, he was somewhat discredited himself by the backlash from Pico's imprisonment and the interdiction by the Vatican of his 900 Theses.  Furthermore, tension arose between del Medigo and the Italian Jewish community over his secular intellectual interests and his associations with gentile scholars.   As a consequence of the financial difficulties he experienced in the wake of Pico's disfavor, del Medigo decided to leave Italy for good.  He went back to Crete, where he spent the last years of his life. During this period, del Medigo returned to Jewish thought, writing the ''Sefer Bechinat Ha-dath'' for his students, in which he clarified his disagreement with the magical and Kabbalistic theories that inspired Pico's ''Oration on the Dignity of Man'', and expounded his belief that a human being cannot aspire to become a god, and that [[Judaism]] requires that a man must "fight for rationality, sobriety and the realization of [his] human limitations."{{ref|Stanford}}

Delmedigo argued against the antiquity of the Kabbalah, noting that it was not known to the sages of the Talmud, or to the geonim, or to Rashi.  He also denies that [[Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai]] was the author of the [[Zohar]], since that work mentions people who lived after the death of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai.  In addition, he attacks the esoteric allegorists among Jewish philosophers. In another section of his work Delmedigo discusses the intellectual reasoning underlying the commandments of Torah (ta'amei ha-mitzvot).

His descendant [[Joseph Delmedigo]] was a famous rabbi, philosopher and a staunch defender of the Kabbalah.

==Popular culture==
Elia del Medigo is likely the inspiration for the fictional character Judah del Medigo, in "The Secret Book of Grazia dei Rossi" by Jacqueline Park.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4659">'''Eurytus''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|jʊər|ᵻ|t|ə|s}}; {{lang-grc-gre|Εὔρυτος}}; fl. 400 BC), was an eminent [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] philosopher who [[Iamblichus]] in one passage&lt;ref&gt;Iamblichus, de Vit. Pyth. 28&lt;/ref&gt; describes as a native of [[Crotone|Croton]], while in another,&lt;ref&gt;Iamblichus, de Vit. Pyth. 36&lt;/ref&gt; he enumerates him among the [[Taranto|Tarentine]] Pythagoreans. He was a disciple of [[Philolaus]], and [[Diogenes Laërtius]]&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius iii. 6, viii. 46&lt;/ref&gt; mentions him among the teachers of [[Plato]], though this statement is very doubtful. It is uncertain whether Eurytus was the author of any work, unless we suppose that the fragment in [[Stobaeus]],&lt;ref&gt;Stobaeus, Phys. Ecl. i.&lt;/ref&gt; which is there ascribed to one Eurytus, belongs to this Eurytus. 

Through a dubious commentary to [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' a caricatural image of Eurytus has gained wide currency. A mediaeval writer confused with [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]] presented Eurytos as a kind of mosaic-setter who delineated various shapes with some definite number of pebbles.&lt;ref name="RNz"&gt; [[Reviel Netz]],''The problem of Pythagorean mathematics'' in ''A History of Pythagoreanism'', ed C. Huffman, Cambridge UP, 2014: " Pseudo-Alexander, writing not earlier than late antiquity and probably in Byzantium, tried to imagine Eurytus’ procedure; he ended up with Eurytus the mosaicist...(p.175)"&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|For example, suppose the number 250 is the definition of human being ... After positing this, he [Eurytus] would take 250 pebbles, some green, some black, others red, and generally pebbles of all colors. Then he smeared a wall with lime and drew a human being in outline ... and then fastened some of these pebbles in the drawn face, others in the hands, others elsewhere, and he completed the drawing of the human being there represented by means of pebbles equal to the units which he declared define human being. As a result of this procedure he would state that just as the particular sketched human being is composed of, say, 250 pebbles, so a real human being is defined by so many units.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander of Aphrodisias, ''Commentary on Aristotle's Metaphysics'', 837.9-19, quoted in: Patricia Curd, Richard D. McKirahan, (2011), ''A Presocratics Reader: Selected Fragments and Testimonia'', page 135. Hackett&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Reviel Netz]] forcefully commented that "pseudo-Alexander’s picture of Eurytus the mosaicist is a non-starter for it is evidently idiotic"and he noted that "while [[Theophrastus]] and Aristotle both consider Eurytus’ results patently false, nothing suggests they consider his procedure silly".&lt;ref name="RNz"/&gt; Taking in account specific mathematical usage he suggested an emended translation of the original passage from Aristotle's work (Metaphysics 1092b9-13):

{{quote|Are [numbers explanatory or causal] in the sense of definitions, as points are of magnitudes? And [so], as Eurytus assigned a certain number to a certain thing, e.g., this [number] to man, that [number] to horse (just as is done, making numbers into the figures triangle and square), making the forms of living beings analogous, in this way, to calculi (psephoi)?.&lt;ref&gt;A standard translation by R. Hope: "It was in this sense that Eurytus determined the number of anything; for he computed the number of a man or that of a horse or of any living thing by outlining its shape with pebbles, as one would number the sides of a triangle or a square", Columbia University Press, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to the historian's from the ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', ''Philolaus'' and ''Eurytus'' are identified by [[Aristoxenus]] as teachers of the last generation of [[Pythagoreans]] (D. L. VIII 46).''&lt;ref name=SEPPhilolaus&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/philolaus/|title=Philolaus|author=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Echecrates of Phlius|Echecrates]] is mentioned by ''Aristoxenus'' as a student of ''[[Philolaus]]'' and ''Eurytus''.

'''Franz Josef Gall''' ({{IPA-de|gal|lang}}; 9 March 1758{{spaced ndash}}22 August 1828) was a [[neuroanatomist]], [[physiology|physiologist]], and pioneer in the study of the localization of mental functions in the [[brain]].

Claimed as the founder of [[phrenology]],&lt;ref&gt;Graham, Patrick. (2001) Phrenology [videorecording (DVD)] : revealing the mysteries of the mind . Richmond Hill, Ont. : American Home Treasures. {{ISBN|0-7792-5135-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gall was an early  and important researcher in his fields. His contributions to the field of neuropsychology were controversial at the time and now widely referred to as pseudoscience. However, Gall's study of phrenology helped establish psychology as a science, contributed to the emergence of the naturalistic approach to the study of man, and played an important part in the development of evolutionist theories, anthropology, and sociology.&lt;ref&gt;Livianos et al 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==

Gall was born in the village of [[Tiefenbronn]] to a wealthy [[Roman Catholic]] wool merchant. The Galls, originally a noble family from Lombardy,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Franz_Joseph_Gall.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; had been the leading family in the area for over a century. His father was the mayor of Tiefenbronn and he was one of 12 children, only 7 of whom lived to adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;Gall 1835&lt;/ref&gt;

Gall's scientific inquiry began in his youth. As a boy, he was fascinated by the differences between himself, his siblings, and his classmates. He developed an early interest in the brain after making a connection between one classmate's odd shaped skull and advanced language abilities.&lt;ref&gt;Eling 1994&lt;/ref&gt; He enjoyed collecting and categorizing plants and animals. He also realized the importance of observation as a scientific technique at a young age.&lt;ref&gt;Tomlinson 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education and early career ==

As the second eldest son, he was intended for the priesthood but chose instead to study medicine at the [[University of Strasbourg]]. In his advanced studies, he again made observations about his classmates. He noticed that many of the particularly bright students had prominent eyeballs and concluded that this could not be purely coincidental. &lt;ref&gt;Gall 1835&lt;/ref&gt;

He later completed his degree in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]]. While in medical school, he studied under  [[Johann Hermann]] and [[Maximilian Stoll]] who impressed upon him the importance of natural observation.&lt;ref&gt;Van Whye 2002&lt;/ref&gt; He took his first job at Lunatic Asylum making observations about the insane.&lt;ref&gt;Gall 1835&lt;/ref&gt; He then opened up his own successful private practice and became so popular he even gave well attended lectures to the public.&lt;ref&gt;Tomlinson 2005&lt;/ref&gt; He was offered the position as head Austrian Court physician but decided to remain in private practice and research.&lt;ref&gt;Davies 1955&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contributions to phrenology ==
[[File:Franz Joseph Gall examining the head of a pretty young girl, Wellcome V0011119.jpg|thumb|right|''Franz Joseph Gall examining the head of a pretty young girl'']]
Based on his early observations about the skull sizes and facial features of his classmates, Gall developed the theory of Organology and the method of [[Cranioscopy]] that would later be known as [[Phrenology]]. Gall's version of Organology states that the mind is a collection of independent entities housed within the brain. [[Cranioscopy]] is a method to determine the personality and development of mental and moral faculties on the basis of the external shape of the skull. During his lifetime, Gall collected and observed over 120 skulls in order to test his hypotheses.

Gall believed that the bumps and uneven geography of the human skull were caused by pressure exerted from the brain underneath. He divided the brain into sections that corresponded to certain behaviors and traits that he called fundamental faculties. This is referred to as [[functional specialization (brain)|localization of function]]. Gall believed there were 27 fundamental faculties, among them were: recollection of people, mechanical ability, talent for poetry, love of property, and even a murder instinct. Based on the surface of a person's skull, Gall could make assumptions about that person's fundamental faculties and therefore their character.

Gall disagreed with [[Philippe Pinel]] and [[Peter Camper]] that the larger brain the larger one's intellectual power. However, after numerous dissections and observations he was able to assert that a mature skull under 14 inches in circumference was not able to function normally.&lt;ref&gt;Tomlinson 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship with Johann Spurzheim ==

In 1800, [[Johann Spurzheim]] attended one of Gall's public lectures and was hired as an assistant to help with public medical demonstrations. In 1804, he became Gall's full-time research partner.&lt;ref&gt;Tomlinson 2005&lt;/ref&gt; They worked together for years to develop theories about brain localization and function. In 1813, Spurzheim separated from Gall in order to make a name for himself in Britain. Gall would later accuse Spurzheim of plagiarism and perverting his work.&lt;ref&gt;Tomlinson 2005&lt;/ref&gt; It was Spurzheim who would give the name [[Phrenology]] to Gall's theories.

== Other achievements ==

Other than his contributions to Phrenology, Gall is lesser known for his other achievements. While developing his theories on localization of function, Gall significantly advanced the science of dissection. Instead of slicing randomly, as had been the practice in previous years, Gall's method involved slow exploration of the entire brain structure and the separation of individual fibers.&lt;ref&gt;Colbert 1997&lt;/ref&gt; This shift in methodology was extremely influential in future discoveries of the brain.

Gall also researched and theorized about language, communication, and the brain. He argued that [[mime|pantomime]], or the science of gesture, was a universal language for all animals and humans. He believed every living thing was born with the ability to understand gestures on some level.&lt;ref&gt;Tomlinson 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1823, he was elected a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]].

He published a book titled "On the Functions of the Brain and of Each of Its parts: With Observations on the Possibility of Determining the Instincts, Propensities, and Talents, Or the Moral and Intellectual Dispositions of Men and Animals, by the Configuration of the Brain and Head" detailing his vast research on brain function and localization. It was translated to English in 1835 by Lewis Winslow.&lt;ref&gt;Gall 1835&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception and controversy ==

Gall's concepts on brain localization were revolutionary, and caused religious leaders and some scientists to take exception. The [[Roman Catholic Church]] considered his theory as contrary to [[religion]]. Established science also condemned these ideas for lack of [[scientific proof]] of his theory. Still others attempted to discredit Gall because they believed he had not given rightful credit to the theories and scientists who influenced him. [[Étienne-Jean Georget]] accused Gall of stealing [[Charles Bonnet]]'s basic idea of brain localization that he had written about over 60 years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Tomlinson 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

His ideas were also not acceptable to the court of the emperor [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] (the brother of [[Marie Antoinette]]). The Austrian government accused Gall of being a materialist and banned his ideas because of their threat to public morality.&lt;ref&gt;Tomlinson 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this opposition, Gall left his lecturer position in Austria. He sought a teaching position in Germany and eventually settled in Paris. Revolutionary France was most likely the most hospitable place for Gall's theories. However, [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], the ruling [[emperor]], and the scientific establishment led by the [[Institute of France]], pronounced his science as invalid. Despite all this, Gall was able to secure a comfortable existence on the basis of his speciality. He became a celebrity of sorts as he was accepted into Parisian intellectual salons.

Gall's phrenological theories and practices were best accepted in England, where the ruling class used it to justify the "inferiority" of its colonial subjects.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} It also became very popular in the USA from 1820 to 1850.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} One interesting influence was on psychiatry, where the South Italian psychiatrist Biagio Gioacchino Miraglia proposed a new classification of mental illness based on brain functions as they were conceived in Gall’s phrenology.&lt;ref&gt;Miraglia, Biagio G. (1874/2014). [http://www.crossingdialogues.com/Ms-E14-02.pdf A new classification of mental illness based on brain functions.] ''Dialogues in Philosophy, Mental and Neuro Sciences'', '''7'''(2):63–67.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==

In spite of many problems associated with his work, Gall made significant contributions to neurological science. He died in Paris, on 22 August 1828. Although married, he remained childless. Some direct descendants of his brothers lived in Germany until 1949. A&amp;nbsp;collection of his skulls can be seen at the Rollett Museum in [[Baden bei Wien]], Austria, where several of his relatives now live.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bmi.gv.at/cms/BMI_OeffentlicheSicherheit/2006/09_10/files/Seinerzeit.pdf Strange teachings about heads] (Bundesministerium fur Inneres).&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, phrenology is thought of as a huge mis-step by the scientific community. The idea that a person's personality could be determined by the shape of their skull has been repeatedly disproven. But at the time, Gall's arguments were persuasive and intriguing. Even though phrenology is now known to be incorrect, Gall did set the groundwork for modern neuroscience by spreading the idea of functional localization within the brain.

The misuse of Gall's ideas and work to justify discrimination were deliberately furthered by his associates, including [[Johann Spurzheim]]. Later, others tried to improve on his theories with systems such as [[characterology]].

Gall's theories had an influence both on the Italian criminologist [[Cesare Lombroso]] and on his French rival, [[Alexandre Lacassagne]]. He also influenced the French anatomist, [[Paul Broca]].

'''''Freedom Evolves''''' is a 2003 popular science and philosophy book by [[Daniel C. Dennett]].  Dennett describes the book as an installment of a lifelong philosophical project, earlier parts of which were ''[[The Intentional Stance]]'', ''[[Consciousness Explained]]'' and ''[[Elbow Room (book)|Elbow Room]]''. It attempts to give an account of [[free will]] and [[morality|moral]] responsibility which is complementary to Dennett's other views on [[consciousness]] and personhood.

== Synopsis ==
As in ''Consciousness Explained'', Dennett advertises the controversial nature of his views extensively in advance. He expects hostility from those who fear that a skeptical analysis of freedom will undermine people's belief in the reality of moral considerations; he likens himself to an interfering crow who insists on telling [[Dumbo]] he doesn't really need the feather he believes is allowing him to fly.

=== Free will  and altruism===

Dennett's stance on [[free will]] is [[compatibilism]] with an evolutionary twist &amp;ndash; the view that, although in the strict physical sense our actions might be pre-determined, we can still be free in all the ways that matter, because of the abilities we evolved.  Free will, seen this way, is about [[agency (philosophy)|freedom to make decisions]] without duress (and so is a version of Kantian positive practical free will, i.e., Kantian autonomy), as opposed to an impossible and unnecessary freedom from causality itself.  To clarify this distinction, he uses the term 'evitability' (the opposite of 'inevitability'), defining it as the ability of an agent to anticipate likely consequences and act to avoid undesirable ones. ''Evitability'' is entirely compatible with, and actually requires, human action being deterministic.
Dennett moves on to [[altruism]], denying that it requires acting to the benefit of others without gaining any benefit yourself.  He argues that it should be understood in terms of helping yourself by helping others, expanding the self to be more inclusive as opposed to being selfless.  To show this blend, he calls such actions 'benselfish', and finds the roots of our capacity for this in the [[evolution]]ary pressures that produced [[kin selection]].  
In his treatment of both free will and altruism, he starts by showing why we should not accept the traditional definitions of either term.

===Beneficial mutual arrangements===

Dennett also suggests that adherence to high [[ethical]] standards might pay off for the individual, because if others know your behaviour is restricted in these ways, the scope for certain beneficial mutual arrangements is enhanced.  This is related to [[Game theory|game theoretical]] considerations: in the famous [[Prisoner's Dilemma]], 'moral' agents who cooperate will be more successful than 'non-moral' agents who do not cooperate.  Cooperation wouldn't seem to naturally arise since agents are tempted to 'defect' and restore a [[Nash equilibrium]], which is often not the best possible solution for all involved.  Dennett concludes by contemplating the possibility that people might be able to opt in or out of moral responsibility: surely, he suggests, given the benefits, they would choose to opt in, especially given that opting out includes such things as being imprisoned or institutionalized.

===Libet's experiments===
Daniel Dennett also argues that no clear conclusion about volition can be derived from [[Benjamin Libet]]'s experiments supposedly demonstrating the non-existence of conscious volition. According to Dennett, ambiguities in the timings of the different events are involved. Libet tells when the readiness potential occurs objectively, using electrodes, but relies on the subject reporting the position of the hand of a clock to determine when the conscious decision was made. As Dennett points out, this is only a report of where it ''seems'' to the subject that various things come together, not of the objective time at which they actually occur.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Suppose Libet knows that your readiness potential peaked at millisecond 6,810 of the experimental trial, and the clock dot was straight down (which is what you reported you saw) at millisecond 7,005. How many milliseconds should he have to add to this number to get the time you were conscious of it? The light gets from your clock face to your eyeball almost instantaneously, but the path of the signals from  retina through lateral geniculate nucleus to striate cortex takes 5 to 10 milliseconds&amp;mdash;a paltry fraction of the 300 milliseconds offset, but how much longer does it take them to get to ''you''. (Or are you located in the striate cortex?) The visual signals have to be processed before they arrive at wherever they need to arrive for you to make a conscious decision of simultaneity. Libet's method presupposes, in short, that we can locate the ''intersection'' of two trajectories:
* the rising-to-consciousness of signals representing the decision to flick
* the rising to consciousness of signals representing successive clock-face orientations
so that these events occur side-by-side as it were in  place where their simultaneity can be noted.&lt;ref&gt;"Freedom Evolves" by Daniel Dennett, p. 231&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://ase.tufts.edu/cogstud/dennett/papers/SelfasaResponding.pdf Dennett, D. ''The Self as Responding and Responsible Artefact'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Robert Kane===
Dennett spends a chapter criticising [[Robert Kane (philosopher)|Robert Kane]]'s theory of [[libertarianism (metaphysics)|libertarian free will]]. Kane believes freedom is based on certain rare and exceptional events, which he calls self-forming actions or SFA's. Dennett notes that there is no guarantee such an event will occur in an individual's life. If it does not, the individual does not in fact have free will at all, according to Kane. Yet they will seem the same as anyone else. Dennett finds an essentially ''indetectable'' notion of free will to be incredible.

{{nihongo|'''Fuke-shū'''|[[Japanese language|Japanese]]: 普化宗|Fuke sect}} or '''Fuke Zen''' was a distinct and ephemeral derivative school of [[Buddhism in Japan|Japanese]] [[Zen]] [[Buddhism]] which originated as an offshoot of the [[Rinzai school]] during the nation's [[Feudal Japan|feudal era]], lasting from the 13th century until the late 19th century. The sect, or sub-sect, traced its philosophical roots to the eccentric Zen master [[Puhua]], as well as similarities and correspondences with the early [[Linji school|Linji]] [[Zen#The Five Houses of Zen|House]] and previous [[Chán]] traditions—particularly [[Huineng]]'s "Sudden Enlightenment" (Southern Chán)—in [[Tang Dynasty]] [[China]].  

Fuke monks or priests ([[komusō]]) were noted for playing the [[shakuhachi]] [[bamboo flute|bamboo]] [[flute]] as a form of [[meditation]] known as [[suizen]] ("blowing meditation"), an innovation from the earlier [[zazen]] ("sitting meditation") of other Zen sects. Fuke Zen was characterized in the public imagination of Japan by its monks' playing of the shakuhachi flute while wearing a large woven basket hat that covered their entire head as they went on [[pilgrimage]].

The theoretical basis of Fuke-shū was to emphasise the concept of the incommunicable aspect of [[Bodhi|enlightenment]], an ideal traced to various Buddhist sects and relayed in paradoxical Zen writings such as the ''[[Lankavatara Sutra]]'', the ''[[Diamond Sutra]]'' and [[Bodhidharma]]'s "Bloodstream sermon". Thus Fuke monks rarely chanted [[sutra]]s or other [[Buddhist texts]], but rather relied upon scores of sacred shakuhachi music called ''[[honkyoku]]'' to express and transmit awakening.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

The sect technically continues to exist (albeit in a less organized form) through the lineage of the contemporary ''Kyochiku Zenji Hosan Kai'' (KZHK) group in [[Kyoto]]—which organizes annual meetings for hundreds of shakuhachi players, Rinzai clerics, and Fuke Zen enthusiasts—and the related Myōan Society, as well as other small groups throughout Japan. KZHK and the Myōan Society operate from their base temples of [[Tōfuku-ji]] and Myōan-ji, the latter being the former headquarters of the Fuke sect. Many Rinzai monks still practice as komusō during certain celebrations in former Fuke-shū temples that have, since the 19th century, reverted to traditional Rinzai Zen. Notable temples include [[Kokutai-ji]] and [[Ichigatsu-ji]].

At least several particular individuals in modern times have been known to pursue temporary itinerant lifestyles as komusō, for spiritual or learning purposes. Hõzan Murata{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}, a famous shakuhachi player, maker, and ''dai-shihan'' (grandmaster), lived as a komusō for 8 months in 1974. Perhaps the most well known contemporary komusō are [[Kokū Nishimura]]—who famously carried on the tradition of dubbing shakuhachi ''kyotaku'' ("empty bell"), in reference to the legend of Puhua (Fuke)—and [[Watazumi Doso]], known for his innovations with and revitalization of the shakuhachi repertoire, and the popularization of the [[hotchiku]].

==The Founder Puhua==

{{main|Puhua}} 

Fuke-shū, according to some accounts, is derived from the teachings of the [[China|Chinese]] Zen teacher [[Linji Yixuan]] (c. 800–866), known in Japan as Rinzai Gigen. However, the Fuke school counted as its founder one of Linji's contemporaries [[Puhua|Pǔhuà]] (普化), whose name is read as Fuke in Japanese. Puhua was reputedly a multi-talented monk, known for being inventive and at the same time quite strict. The notion of Puhua as founder is also supported by several references in the ''Record of Linji'', as well as the ''Kyotaku Denki''. (Although the latter was later confirmed as a fabrication used to further the komusōs' benefits under the [[Tokugawa shogunate]].)

One story of Puhua particularly demonstrates his unique style of nonverbal [[Chinese Chán|Chán]]:&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, page 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
When Panshan Baoji was near death, he said to the monks, "Is there anyone among you who can draw my likeness?"

Many of the monks made drawings for Panshan, but none were to his liking.

The monk Puhua stepped forward and said, "I can draw it."

Panshan said, "Why don't you show it to me?"

Puhua then turned a somersault and went out.

Panshan said, "Someday, that fellow will teach others in a crazy manner!"

Having said these words, Panshan passed away.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many stories about Puhua that appear in the Record of Linji add to his reputation of having a rough and uncompromising manner of expressing the [[dharma]]. For example:&lt;ref&gt;Schloegl, pp. 66–67&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
44.a. One day the master ([[Linji Yixuan]]) and Puhua went to a vegetarian banquet given them by a believer. During it, the master asked Puhua: "'A hair swallows the vast ocean, a mustard seed contains Mt. Sumeru' – does this happen by means of supernatural powers, or is the whole body (substance, essence) like this?" Puhua kicked over the table. The master said: "Rough fellow." Puhua retorted: "What place is this here to speak of rough and refined ?"

b. The next day, they went again to a vegetarian banquet. During it, the master asked: "Today's fare, how does it compare with yesterday's?" Puhua (as before) kicked over the table. The master said: "Understand it you do – but still, you are a rough fellow." Puhua replied: "Blind fellow, does one preach of any roughness or finesse in the Buddha-Dharma?" The master stuck out his tongue.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There is some controversy as to the degree and nature of his musical talents, but his followers would often reflect on a certain story for inspiration: the story describes Puhua going through his hometown, ringing a bell to summon others to [[enlightenment (Buddhism)|enlightenment]]. The same, for many Fuke practitioners, applied to the shakuhachi, and its mastery was seen as a path to enlightenment.

===Death of Puhua===
The death of Puhua is recounted in the Record of Linji{{When|date=April 2011}}. In addition to giving a special importance to Puhua's ringing bell, it is particularly striking as a story of Buddhist [[resurrection]] that equals the famous resurrection story of [[Bodhidharma]], the Indian master who brought the [[Ekayana]] school from India to China, which became the Chan sect of Buddhism. The story:&lt;ref&gt;Schloegl, page76.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
65. One day at the street market Fuke was begging all and sundry to give him a robe. Everybody offered him one, but he did not want any of them. The master Linji made the superior buy a coffin, and when Fuke returned, said to him: "There, I had this robe made for you." Fuke shouldered the coffin, and went back to the street market, calling loudly: "Rinzai had this robe made for me! I am off to the East Gate to enter transformation" (to die). The people of the market crowded after him, eager to look. Fuke said: "No, not today. Tomorrow, I shall go to the South Gate to enter transformation." And so for three days. Nobody believed it any longer. On the fourth day, and now without any spectators, Fuke went alone outside the city walls, and laid himself into the coffin. He asked a traveler who chanced by to nail down the lid.

The news spread at once, and the people of the market rushed there. On opening the coffin, they found that the body had vanished, but from high up in the sky they heard the ring of his hand bell.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Fuke lineage in Japan==
Fuke Zen was brought to Japan by [[Kakushin|Shinchi Kakushin]] (心地覺心)(1207–1298), also known as Muhon Kakushin (無本覺心) and posthumously as Hotto Kokushi (法燈國師).  Kakushin had travelled to China for six years and studied with the famous Chinese [[Chinese Chán|Chan]] master [[Wumen]] (無門) of the Linji lineage. Kakushin became a disciple of Chôsan, a 17th generation teacher of the Fuke sect of China.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150323210457/http://fuke-shakuhachi.com/shaku8/en_history_fukeshakuhachi.html Fuke Shakuhachi Official Site]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it no longer exists as a religious organization, during the feudal period, Fuke Zen's following was quite extensive.  Its members could be easily recognized by their practice of playing the shakuhachi flute, which was considered a form of meditation, termed [[suizen]] (吹禪).  These musician-monks were known at first as ''komosō'' (薦僧; literally "straw-mat monks") and, by the mid-17th century, as ''[[komuso|komusō]]'' (虚無僧; literally "emptiness monk").

Fuke Zen in general stressed [[pilgrimage]], and its adherents were mostly lay-practitioners rather than clergymen. During the [[Edo period]] (1603–1867), many [[rōnin]] became incorporated into the sect, and due to the temperaments of these former [[samurai]], the sect gained the reputation of harbouring troublemakers. Members of the Fuke sect were also given permission by the Bakufu government of the time to travel freely throughout the country, a significant dispensation considering the severe travel restrictions of the time. In reality, some of the Fuke monks were spies for the [[Bakufu]] government, a practice which helped seal the sect's demise when the government itself fell.

==Development and demise==

Fuke, which had initially been a loose affiliation of monks and lay pilgrims, solidified as a sect around 1700.  However, the sect died out in 1871 following the [[Meiji Restoration]]. The new government promulgated a grand council proclamation banning the practice of Fuke Zen and playing the [[shakuhachi]] for religious reasons. This is because, as described above, in practice many of the Fuke were spies and informers for the government. Practice of the [[shakuhachi]] was banned entirely for four years by the Meiji government, after which it was decreed that secular playing was permitted. From that time onward the playing of original Fuke pieces, [[honkyoku]], made a very slow recovery. The recovery is continuing to this day.

Galileo studied [[speed]] and [[velocity]], [[gravity]] and [[free fall]], the [[principle of relativity]], [[inertia]], [[projectile motion]] and also worked in applied science and technology, describing the properties of [[pendulums]] and "[[hydrostatic]] balances", inventing the [[thermoscope]] and various [[sector (instrument)|military compasses]], and using the [[telescope]] for scientific observations of celestial objects. His contributions to observational astronomy include the telescopic confirmation of the [[phases of Venus]], the observation of the [[Galilean Moons|four largest satellites]] of [[Jupiter]], the observation of [[Saturn]] and the analysis of [[sunspots]].

Galileo's championing of [[heliocentrism]] and [[Copernican heliocentrism|Copernicanism]] was controversial during his lifetime, when most subscribed to either [[geocentrism]] or the [[Tychonic system]].&lt;ref name="Hannam, James 2011. p329-344"&gt;Hannam, James (2011).

==Early life and family==
Galileo was born in [[Pisa]] (then part of the [[Duchy of Florence]]), Italy, on 15 February 1564,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=O'Connor |first=J. J. |last2=Robertson |first2=E.F. |url=http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Galileo.html |publisher=[[University of St Andrews]], Scotland |work=The MacTutor History of Mathematics archive |title=Galileo Galilei |accessdate=2007-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first of six children of [[Vincenzo Galilei]], a famous [[lutenist]], composer, and [[music theory|music theorist]], and Giulia (née Ammannati), who had married in 1562. Galileo became an accomplished lutenist himself and would have learned early from his father a scepticism for established authority,&lt;ref&gt;John Gribbin. ''The Fellowship: Gilbert, Bacon, Harvey, Wren, Newton and the Story of the Scientific Revolution''. The Overlook Press, 2008. p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; the value of well-measured or quantified experimentation, an appreciation for a periodic or musical measure of time or rhythm, as well as the results expected from a combination of mathematics and experiment.

Three of Galileo's five siblings survived infancy. The youngest, [[Michelagnolo Galilei|Michelangelo]] (or Michelagnolo), also became a noted lutenist and composer although he contributed to financial burdens during Galileo's young adulthood. Michelangelo was unable to contribute his fair share of their father's promised dowries to their brothers-in-law, who would later attempt to seek legal remedies for payments due. Michelangelo would also occasionally have to borrow funds from Galileo to support his musical endeavours and excursions. These financial burdens may have contributed to Galileo's early desire to develop inventions that would bring him additional income.

When Galileo Galilei was eight, his family moved to [[Florence, Italy|Florence]], but he was left with Jacopo Borghini for two years. He was educated from 1575 to 1578 in the  [[Vallombrosa Abbey]], about 30&amp;nbsp;km southeast of Florence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=John |last=Gribbin |authorlink=John Gribbin |title=Science.

===Name===
The surname Galilei derives from the given name of an ancestor, Galileo Bonaiuti, a physician, university teacher and politician who lived in Florence from 1370 to 1450; his descendants had changed their family name from Bonaiuti (or Buonaiuti) to Galilei in his honor in the late 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Sobel-2000|Sobel (1999, p. 16)]]&lt;/ref&gt; Galileo Bonaiuti was buried in the same church, the [[Basilica of Santa Croce, Florence|Basilica of Santa Croce in Florence]], where about 200 years later his more famous descendant Galileo Galilei was also buried.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.it/books?id=fm3NyAYiiWsC&amp;pg=PA89 Robin Santos Doak, ''Galileo: Astronomer and Physicist'', Capstone, 2005, p. 89.]&lt;/ref&gt;

It was common for mid-sixteenth-century Tuscan families to name the eldest son after the parents' surname.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Sobel-2000|Sobel (1999, p. 13)]]&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, Galileo Galilei was not necessarily named after his ancestor Galileo Bonaiuti. The Italian male given name "Galileo" (and thence the surname "Galilei") derives from the Latin "Galilaeus", meaning "of [[Galilee]]", a biblically significant region in Northern [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Galilean |encyclopedia=The Century Dictionary and Encyclopedia |year=1903 |publisher=The Century Co. |location=New York |origyear=1889 |volume=III |page=2436 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Sobel-2000|Sobel (1999, p. 16)]] "The meaning of the name Galileo, or Galilei, harks back to the land of Galilee, although, as Galileo explained on this score, he was not at all a Jew."&lt;/ref&gt; Because of that region, the adjective ''galilaios'' ([[Greek language|Greek]] ''γαλιλαίος'', [[Latin]] ''Galilaeus'', [[Italian language|Italian]] ''galileo''), which means "Galilean", has been used in antiquity (particularly by [[emperor Julian]]) to refer to [[Christ]] and [[Christianity|his followers]];&lt;ref&gt;[[Against the Galilaeans]]&lt;/ref&gt; after this, the adjective has been adopted as a name with a meaning similar to ''[[Jesus (name)|Jesus]]'' or ''[[Christian (given name)|Christian]]''.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

The biblical roots of Galileo's name and surname were to become the subject of a famous pun.&lt;ref&gt;Maurice Finnochiaro, ''The Galileo Affair: A Documentary History'' 300, 330 n. 13 (Univ. Cal. Press 1998)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1614, during the [[Galileo affair]], one of Galileo's opponents, the Dominican priest [[Tommaso Caccini]], delivered against Galileo a controversial and influential [[Tommaso Caccini#Caccini's Sermon at Santa Maria Novella|sermon]]. In it he made a point of quoting [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] {{Bibleref2-nb|Acts|1:11|KJV}}, "Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven?".&lt;ref name=naess&gt;{{cite book |last=Naess |first=Atle | authorlink=Atle Næss |title=Galileo Galilei - When the World Stood Still |date=2004 |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer Science &amp; Business Media]] |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=9fWI6vfgjo8C&amp;pg=PA89 89]–[https://books.google.com/books?id=9fWI6vfgjo8C&amp;pg=PA91 91] |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9fWI6vfgjo8C |accessdate=2 November 2016|isbn=9783540270546 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Children===
[[File:Suor maria celeste.jpg|thumb|upright|Galileo's beloved elder daughter, Virginia ([[Nun|Sister]] [[Maria Celeste]]), was particularly devoted to her father. She is buried with him in his tomb in the [[Basilica of Santa Croce, Florence]].]]
Despite being a genuinely pious Roman Catholic,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Sharratt-1994|Sharratt (1994, pp. 17, 213)]]&lt;/ref&gt; Galileo fathered three children out of wedlock with [[Marina Gamba]]. They had two daughters, Virginia (born in 1600) and Livia (born in 1601), and a son, [[Vincenzo Gamba|Vincenzo]] (born in 1606).&lt;ref name="RosenGothard2009"&gt;Rosen, Joe; Gothard, Lisa Quinn (2009).

Because of their illegitimate birth, their father considered the girls unmarriageable, if not posing problems of prohibitively expensive support or dowries, which would have been similar to Galileo's previous extensive financial problems with two of his sisters.&lt;ref&gt;Gribbin. John (2008). ''The Fellowship: Gilbert, Bacon, Harvey, Wren, Newton and the Story of the Scientific Revolution''.

==Career as a scientist==
Although Galileo seriously considered the priesthood as a young man, at his father's urging he instead enrolled in 1580 at the [[University of Pisa]] for a medical degree.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Reston-2000|Reston (2000, pp. 3–14).]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1581, when he was studying medicine, he noticed a swinging [[chandelier]], which air currents shifted about to swing in larger and smaller arcs. To him, it seemed, by comparison with his heartbeat, that the chandelier took the same amount of time to swing back and forth, no matter how far it was swinging. When he returned home, he set up two [[pendulum]]s of equal length and swung one with a large sweep and the other with a small sweep and found that they kept time together. It was not until the work of [[Christiaan Huygens]], almost one hundred years later, that the [[Tautochrone curve|tautochrone]] nature of a swinging pendulum was used to create an accurate timepiece.&lt;ref name=Asimov&gt;Asimov, Isaac (1964). ''Asimov's Biographical Encyclopedia of Science and Technology''. {{ISBN|978-0385177719}}&lt;/ref&gt; Up to this point, Galileo had deliberately been kept away from mathematics, since a physician earned a higher income than a mathematician. However, after accidentally attending a lecture on geometry, he talked his reluctant father into letting him study mathematics and [[natural philosophy]] instead of medicine.&lt;ref name=Asimov/&gt; He created a [[thermoscope]], a forerunner of the [[thermometer]], and, in 1586, published a small book on the design of a [[hydrostatic]] balance he had invented (which first brought him to the attention of the scholarly world). Galileo also studied ''disegno'', a term encompassing fine art, and, in 1588, obtained the position of instructor in the [[Accademia delle Arti del Disegno]] in Florence, teaching perspective and [[chiaroscuro]]. Being inspired by the artistic tradition of the city and the works of the Renaissance artists, Galileo acquired an [[Aestheticism|aesthetic mentality]]. While a young teacher at the Accademia, he began a lifelong friendship with the Florentine painter [[Cigoli]], who included Galileo's lunar observations in one of his paintings.&lt;ref name="edgerton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="panofsky"/&gt;

In 1589, he was appointed to the chair of mathematics in Pisa. In 1591, his father died, and he was entrusted with the care of his younger brother [[Michelagnolo Galilei|Michelagnolo]]. In 1592, he moved to the [[University of Padua]] where he taught geometry, [[mechanics]], and astronomy until 1610.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Sharratt-1994|Sharratt (1994, pp. 45–66).]]&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, Galileo made significant discoveries in both pure [[fundamental science]] (for example, kinematics of motion and astronomy) as well as practical [[applied science]] (for example, strength of materials and pioneering the telescope). His multiple interests included the study of [[astrology]], which at the time was a discipline tied to the studies of mathematics and astronomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Rutkin |first=H.

===Galileo, Kepler and theories of tides===
[[File:Galileo Galilei 2.jpg|thumb|upright=.8|left|Galileo Galilei, portrait by [[Domenico Robusti|Tintoretto.]]]]
Cardinal Bellarmine had written in 1615 that the [[Copernican heliocentrism|Copernican system]] could not be defended without "a true [[physical entity|physical]] demonstration that the sun does not circle the earth but the earth circles the sun".&lt;ref&gt;Finocchiaro (1989), pp. 67–9.&lt;/ref&gt; Galileo considered his theory of the tides to provide the required physical proof of the motion of the earth. This theory was so important to him that he originally intended to entitle his ''Dialogue on the Two Chief World Systems'' the ''Dialogue on the Ebb and Flow of the Sea''.&lt;ref&gt;Finocchiaro (1989), p. 354, n. 52&lt;/ref&gt; The reference to tides was removed from the title by order of the Inquisition.

For Galileo, the [[tide]]s were caused by the sloshing back and forth of water in the seas as a point on the Earth's surface sped up and slowed down because of the Earth's rotation on its axis and revolution around the Sun. He circulated his first account of the tides in 1616, addressed to Cardinal Orsini.&lt;ref&gt;Finocchiaro (1989), pp. 119–133&lt;/ref&gt; His theory gave the first insight into the importance of the shapes of ocean basins in the size and timing of tides; he correctly accounted, for instance, for the negligible tides halfway along the [[Adriatic Sea]] compared to those at the ends. As a general account of the cause of tides, however, his theory was a failure.

If this theory were correct, there would be only one high tide per day. Galileo and his contemporaries were aware of this inadequacy because there are two daily high tides at [[Venice]] instead of one, about twelve hours apart. Galileo dismissed this anomaly as the result of several secondary causes including the shape of the sea, its depth, and other factors.&lt;ref&gt;Finocchiaro (1989), pp. 127–131 and Galilei, ([[#CITEREFGalilei1953|1953]]), pp. 432–6&lt;/ref&gt; Against the assertion that Galileo was deceptive in making these arguments, [[Albert Einstein]] expressed the opinion that Galileo developed his "fascinating arguments" and accepted them uncritically out of a desire for physical proof of the motion of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Einstein (1953) p. xvii&lt;/ref&gt; Galileo dismissed the idea, held by his contemporary [[Johannes Kepler]], that the moon caused the tides.&lt;ref&gt;Galilei, ([[#CITEREFGalilei1953|1953]]), p.&amp;nbsp;462.&lt;/ref&gt; (Galileo also took no interest in Kepler's elliptical orbits of the planets.)&lt;ref&gt;James Robert Voelkel.

===Controversy over comets and ''The Assayer''===
{{Main|The Assayer}}

In 1619, Galileo became embroiled in a controversy with Father [[Orazio Grassi]], professor of mathematics at the Jesuit [[Collegio Romano]]. It began as a dispute over the nature of comets, but by the time Galileo had published ''[[The Assayer]]'' (''Il Saggiatore'') in 1623, his last salvo in the dispute, it had become a much wider [[controversy]] over the very nature of [[science]] itself. The title page of the book describes Galileo as philosopher and "Matematico Primario" of the Grand Duke of Tuscany.

Because ''The Assayer'' contains such a wealth of Galileo's ideas on how science should be practised, it has been referred to as his scientific manifesto.&lt;ref name="scientific manifesto"&gt;[[#Reference-Drake-1960|Drake (1960, pp.vii, xxiii–xxiv)]], [[#Reference-Sharratt-1994|Sharratt (1994, pp. 139–140)]].&lt;/ref&gt; Early in 1619, Father Grassi had anonymously published a pamphlet, ''An Astronomical Disputation on the Three Comets of the Year 1618'',&lt;!--- ''[[The Assayer#disputatio|An Astronomical Disputation on the Three Comets of the Year 1618]]'' This should eventually link to a section in the article on the Assayer --&gt;&lt;ref name="disputatio"&gt;[[#Reference-Grassi-1960a|Grassi (1960a)]].&lt;/ref&gt; which discussed the nature of a comet that had appeared late in November of the previous year. Grassi concluded that the comet was a fiery body which had moved along a segment of a great circle at a constant distance from the earth,&lt;ref name="grassi great circle"&gt;[[#Reference-Drake-1978|Drake (1978, p. 268)]], [[#Reference-Grassi-1960a|Grassi (1960a, p. 16)]].&lt;/ref&gt; and since it moved in the sky more slowly than the moon, it must be farther away than the moon.

Grassi's arguments and conclusions were criticised in a subsequent article, ''[[Discourse on Comets]]'',&lt;ref name="discourse on comets"&gt;[[#Reference-Galileo&amp;Guiducci-1960|Galilei &amp; Guiducci (1960)]].&lt;/ref&gt; published under the name of one of Galileo's disciples, a Florentine lawyer named [[Mario Guiducci]], although it had been largely written by Galileo himself.&lt;ref name="authorship of discourse"&gt;[[#Reference-Drake-1960|Drake (1960, p.xvi)]].&lt;/ref&gt; Galileo and Guiducci offered no definitive theory of their own on the nature of comets&lt;ref name="criticism of previous theories"&gt;[[#Reference-Drake-1957|Drake (1957, p. 222)]], [[#Reference-Drake-1960|Drake (1960, p.xvii)]].&lt;/ref&gt; although they did present some tentative conjectures that are now known to be mistaken. In its opening passage, Galileo and Guiducci's ''Discourse'' gratuitously insulted the Jesuit [[Christopher Scheiner]],&lt;ref name="Scheiner insult"&gt;[[#Reference-Sharratt-1994|Sharratt (1994, p. 135)]], [[#Reference-Drake-1960|Drake (1960, p.xii)]], [[#Reference-Galileo&amp;Guiducci-1960|Galilei &amp; Guiducci (1960, p. 24)]].&lt;/ref&gt; and various uncomplimentary remarks about the professors of the Collegio Romano were scattered throughout the work.&lt;ref name="uncomplimentary remark"&gt;[[#Reference-Sharratt-1994|Sharratt (1994, p. 135)]].&lt;/ref&gt; The Jesuits were offended,&lt;ref name="jesuits offended"&gt;[[#Reference-Sharratt-1994|Sharratt (1994, p. 135)]], [[#Reference-Drake-1960|Drake (1960, p.xvii)]].&lt;/ref&gt; and Grassi soon replied with a [[polemical]] tract of his own, ''The Astronomical and Philosophical Balance''&lt;!--- ''[[The Assayer#astronomical balance|The Astronomical and Philosophical Balance]]'' This should eventually link to a section in the article on the Assayer --&gt;,&lt;ref name="astronomical balance"&gt;[[#Reference-Grassi-1960b|Grassi (1960b)]].&lt;/ref&gt; under the pseudonym Lothario Sarsio Sigensano,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Drake-1978|Drake (1978, p. 494)]], [[#Reference-Favaro-1890|Favaro]] [http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?VOL=6&amp;VOLPAG=111 (1896, 6:111)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108184206/http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?VOL=6&amp;VOLPAG=111 |date=8 January 2009 }}. The pseudonym was a slightly imperfect anagram of Oratio Grasio Savonensis, a Latinised version of his name and home town.&lt;/ref&gt; purporting to be one of his own pupils.

''The Assayer'' was Galileo's devastating reply to the ''Astronomical Balance''.&lt;ref name="the assayer"&gt;[[#Reference-Galileo-1960|Galilei (1960)]].&lt;/ref&gt; It has been widely recognized as a masterpiece of polemical literature,&lt;ref name="masterpiece of polemics"&gt;[[#Reference-Sharratt-1994|Sharratt (1994, p. 137)]], [[#Reference-Drake-1957|Drake (1957, p. 227)]].&lt;/ref&gt; in which "Sarsi's" arguments are subjected to withering scorn.&lt;ref name="withering scorn"&gt;[[#Reference-Sharratt-1994|Sharratt (1994, p. 138–142)]].&lt;/ref&gt; It was greeted with wide acclaim, and particularly pleased the new pope, [[Urban VIII]], to whom it had been dedicated.&lt;ref name="assayer success"&gt;[[#Reference-Drake-1960|Drake (1960, p.xix)]].&lt;/ref&gt; In Rome, in the previous decade, Barberini, the future Urban VIII, had come down on the side of Galileo and the [[Lincean Academy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Alexander |first=Amir |authorlink=Amir Alexander |title=Infinitesimal: How a Dangerous Mathematical Theory Shaped the Modern World |year=2014 |page=131 |publisher=[[Scientific American]] / [[Farrar, Straus and Giroux]] |isbn=978-0374176815}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Galileo's dispute with Grassi permanently alienated many of the Jesuits who had previously been sympathetic to his ideas,&lt;ref name="jesuit alienation"&gt;[[#Reference-Drake-1960|Drake (1960, p.vii)]].&lt;/ref&gt; and Galileo and his friends were convinced that these Jesuits were responsible for bringing about his later condemnation.&lt;ref name="jesuits responsible"&gt;[[#Reference-Sharratt-1994|Sharratt (1994, p. 175)]].&lt;/ref&gt; The evidence for this is at best equivocal, however.&lt;ref name="evidence of jesuits"&gt;[[#Reference-Sharratt-1994|Sharratt (1994, pp. 175–78)]], [[#Reference-Blackwell-2006|Blackwell (2006, p. 30)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy over heliocentrism===
{{Main |Galileo affair}}
[[File:Galileo facing the Roman Inquisition.jpg|thumb|[[Cristiano Banti]]'s 1857 painting ''Galileo facing the [[Roman Inquisition]]'']]

In the whole world prior to Galileo's conflict with the Church, the majority of educated people subscribed either to the Aristotelian [[geocentrism|geocentric]] view that the earth was the [[History of the Center of the Universe|center of the universe]] and that all heavenly bodies revolved around the Earth,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Blackwell |first=Richard |title=Galileo, Bellarmine, and the Bible |date=1991 |publisher=University of Notre Dame Press |location=Notre Dame |isbn=978-0-268-01024-9 |page=25 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Galileo_Bellarmine_and_the_Bible.html?id=MHnwAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[Tychonic system]] that blended geocentrism with [[heliocentrism]].&lt;ref name="Hannam, James 2011. p303-316"&gt;Hannam, James. "The Genesis of Science". 2011. p303-316.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, following the death of Copernicus and before Galileo, heliocentrism was relatively uncontroversial;&lt;ref name="Hannam, James 2011. p303-316"/&gt; Copernicus's work was used by [[Pope Gregory XIII]] to reform the calendar in 1582.{{efn|"The Gregorian calendar, first adopted in 1582, was based on computations that made use of Copernicus' work" ({{Citation |first=Thomas |last=Kuhn |title=The Copernican Revolution |page=125 |date=1957 |publisher=Harvard University Press}}).}}

Opposition to heliocentrism and Galileo's writings combined religious and scientific objections. Scientific opposition came from [[Tycho Brahe]] and others and arose from the fact that, if heliocentrism were true, an annual [[stellar parallax]] should be observed, though none was. Copernicus and Aristarchus had correctly postulated that parallax was negligible because the stars were so distant. However, Brahe had countered that, since stars appeared to have measurable size, if the stars were that distant, they would be gigantic, and in fact far larger than the Sun or any other celestial body. In Brahe's system, by contrast, the stars were a little more distant than Saturn, and the Sun and stars were comparable in size.&lt;ref name="Graney and Danielson, 2014"&gt;Graney and Danielson ([[#CITEREFGraneyDanielson2014|2014]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious opposition to heliocentrism arose from Biblical references such as [[Psalms|Psalm]] {{bibleverse-nb ||Psalm|93:1|KJV}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Psalm|96:10|KJV}}, and [[Books of Chronicles|1 Chronicles]] {{bibleverse-nb|1|Chronicles|16:30|KJV}} which include text stating that "the world is firmly established, it cannot be moved." In the same manner, {{bibleverse||Psalm|104:5|NIV}} says, "the Lord set the earth on its foundations; it can never be moved."  Further, [[Ecclesiastes]] {{bibleverse-nb ||Ecclesiastes|1:5|1000}} states that "And the sun rises and sets and returns to its place."&lt;ref name="Bellarmine quote"&gt;[[#Reference-Brodrick-1965|Brodrick (1965, c1964, p. 95)]] quoting [[Robert Bellarmine|Cardinal Bellarmine's]] letter to [[:it:Paolo Antonio Foscarini|Foscarini]], dated 12 April 1615. Translated from [[#Reference-Favaro-1890|Favaro]] [http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?VOL=12&amp;VOLPAG=171 (1902, 12:171–72)] {{it icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Galileo defended heliocentrism based on his astronomical observations of 1609 (''[[Sidereus Nuncius]]'' 1610). In December 1613, the Grand Duchess Christina of Florence confronted one of Galileo's friends and followers, [[Benedetto Castelli]], with biblical objections to the motion of the earth.  According to Maurice Finocchiaro, this was done in a friendly and gracious manner, out of curiosity. Prompted by this incident, Galileo wrote a [[Letter to Benedetto Castelli|letter to Castelli]] in which he argued that heliocentrism was actually not contrary to biblical texts, and that the bible was an authority on faith and morals, not on science.  This letter was not published, but circulated widely.&lt;ref&gt;Finocchiaro (1989), pp. 27-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1615, Galileo's writings on heliocentrism had been submitted to the [[Roman Inquisition]] by Father [[Niccolò Lorini]], who claimed that Galileo and his followers were attempting to reinterpret the Bible, which was seen as a violation of the [[Council of Trent]] and looked dangerously like Protestantism.&lt;ref name= "Langford 1992, p.56-57"&gt;Langford (1992), pp. 56–57&lt;/ref&gt; Lorini specifically cited Galileo's letter to Castelli.&lt;ref&gt;Finocchiaro (1989), pp. 28 &amp; 134.&lt;/ref&gt;  Galileo went to Rome to defend himself and his Copernican and biblical ideas. At the start of 1616, Monsignor [[Francesco Ingoli]] initiated a debate with Galileo, sending him an essay disputing the Copernican system. Galileo later stated that he believed this essay to have been instrumental in the action against Copernicanism that followed.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Graney-2015|Graney (2015, pp. 68-69)]] Ingoli's essay was published in English translation for the first time in 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Maurice Finocchiaro, Ingoli had probably been commissioned by the Inquisition to write an expert opinion on the controversy, and the essay provided the "chief direct basis" for the Inquisition's actions.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Finocchiaro-2010|Finocchiaro (2010, pp. 72)]]&lt;/ref&gt; The essay focused on eighteen physical and mathematical arguments against heliocentrism. It borrowed primarily from the arguments of Tycho Brahe, and it notedly mentioned Brahe's argument that heliocentrism required the stars to be much larger than the Sun. Ingoli wrote that the great distance to the stars in the heliocentric theory "clearly proves ... the fixed stars to be of such size, as they may surpass or equal the size of the orbit circle of the Earth itself."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Graney-2015|Graney (2015, pp. 71)]]&lt;/ref&gt;  The essay also included four theological arguments, but Ingoli suggested Galileo focus on the physical and mathematical arguments, and he did not mention Galileo's biblical ideas.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Graney-2015|Graney (2015, pp. 66-76, 164-175, 187-195)]]&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1616, an Inquisitorial commission declared heliocentrism to be "foolish and absurd in philosophy, and formally heretical since it explicitly contradicts in many places the sense of Holy Scripture." The Inquisition found that the idea of the Earth's movement "receives the same judgement in philosophy and... in regard to theological truth it is at least erroneous in faith".&lt;ref name=wcumf&gt;{{cite web |last=Finocchiaro |first=Maurice |url=http://astro.wcupa.edu/mgagne/ess362/resources/finocchiaro.html#conreport |id=ESS 362 / 562 |title=West Chester University—History of Astronomy; Lecture notes: Texts from The Galileo Affair: A Documentary History |publisher=West Chester University |accessdate=18 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930013053/http://astro.wcupa.edu/mgagne/ess362/resources/finocchiaro.html#conreport |archivedate=30 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  (The [https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1402/1402.6168.pdf original document] from the Inquisitorial commission was made widely available in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://esmateria.com/2014/02/28/una-errata-reproducida-durante-siglos-cambia-la-censura-de-la-iglesia-a-galileo/ |title=Una errata reproducida durante siglos cambia la censura de la Iglesia a Galileo|work=Materia}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

[[Pope Paul V]] instructed Cardinal Bellarmine to deliver this finding to Galileo, and to order him to abandon the opinion that heliocentrism was physically true. On 26 February, Galileo was called to Bellarmine's residence and ordered:

{{quote | ... to abandon completely... the opinion that the sun stands still at the center of the world and the earth moves, and henceforth not to hold, teach, or defend it in any way whatever, either orally or in writing.&lt;ref name=h218&gt;Heilbron (2010), p. 218&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The decree of the [[Congregation of the Index]] banned Copernicus's ''De Revolutionibus'' and other heliocentric works until correction.&lt;ref name=h218 /&gt; Bellarmine's instructions did not prohibit Galileo from discussing heliocentrism as a mathematical and philosophic idea, so long as he did not advocate for its physical truth.&lt;ref name="Hannam, James 2011. p329-344"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sharratt [[#Reference-Sharratt-1994|(1994]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=rB0rHzrpJOMC&amp;pg=PA126#v=onepage pp. 126–31)].&lt;/ref&gt;

For the next decade, Galileo stayed well away from the controversy. He revived his project of writing a book on the subject, encouraged by the election of Cardinal Maffeo [[Barberini]] as [[Pope Urban VIII]] in 1623. Barberini was a friend and admirer of Galileo, and had opposed the condemnation of Galileo in 1616. Galileo's resulting book, ''[[Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems]]'', was published in 1632, with formal authorization from the [[Inquisition]] and papal permission.&lt;ref name = "Pope Urban VIII"&gt;{{cite web| work =Galileo Project | title = Pope Urban VIII Biography|url= http://galileo.rice.edu/gal/urban.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier, Pope Urban VIII had personally asked Galileo to give arguments for and against heliocentrism in the book, and to be careful not to advocate heliocentrism. He made another request, that his own views on the matter be included in Galileo's book. Only the latter of those requests was fulfilled by Galileo.

Whether unknowingly or deliberately, Simplicio, the defender of the Aristotelian geocentric view in ''Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems'', was often caught in his own errors and sometimes came across as a fool. Indeed, although Galileo states in the preface of his book that the character is named after a famous Aristotelian philosopher ([[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicius]] in Latin, "Simplicio" in Italian), the name "Simplicio" in Italian also has the connotation of "simpleton".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Finocchiaro-1997|Finocchiaro (1997)]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=Li4eh7JIMtIC&amp;pg=PA82 p. 82]; [[#Reference-Moss&amp;Wallace-2003|Moss &amp; Wallace (2003)]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=Lw50esHmgacC&amp;pg=PA11 p. 11]&lt;/ref&gt; This portrayal of Simplicio made ''Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems'' appear as an advocacy book: an attack on Aristotelian geocentrism and defence of the Copernican theory. Unfortunately for his relationship with the Pope, Galileo put the words of Urban VIII into the mouth of Simplicio.

Most historians agree Galileo did not act out of malice and felt blindsided by the reaction to his book.{{efn|See Langford [[#Reference-Langford-1998|(1966, pp. 133–34)]], and Seeger [[#Reference-Seeger-1966|(1966, p. 30)]], for example. Drake [[#Reference-Drake-1978|(1978, p. 355)]] asserts that Simplicio's character is modelled on the Aristotelian philosophers Lodovico delle Colombe and [[Cesare Cremonini (philosopher)|Cesare Cremonini]], rather than Urban. He also considers that the demand for Galileo to include the Pope's argument in the ''Dialogue'' left him with no option but to put it in the mouth of Simplicio [[#Reference-Drake-1953|(Drake, 1953, p. 491)]]. Even [[Arthur Koestler]], who is generally quite harsh on Galileo in ''[[The Sleepwalkers (Koestler book)|The Sleepwalkers]]'' [[#Reference-Koestler-1990|(1959)]], after noting that Urban suspected Galileo of having intended Simplicio to be a caricature of him, says "this of course is untrue" [[#Reference-Koestler-1990|(1959, p. 483)]].}} However, the Pope did not take the suspected public ridicule lightly, nor the Copernican advocacy.

Galileo had alienated one of his biggest and most powerful supporters, the Pope, and was called to Rome to defend his writings&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lindberg |first=David |title=Beyond War and Peace: A Reappraisal of the Encounter between Christianity and Science |url=http://www.asa3.org/ASA/PSCF/1987/PSCF9-87Lindberg.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; in September 1632. He finally arrived in February 1633 and was brought before inquisitor [[Vincenzo Maculani]] to be [[Criminal charge|charged]]. Throughout his trial, Galileo steadfastly maintained that since 1616 he had faithfully kept his promise not to hold any of the condemned opinions, and initially he denied even defending them. However, he was eventually persuaded to admit that, contrary to his true intention, a reader of his ''Dialogue'' could well have obtained the impression that it was intended to be a defence of Copernicanism. In view of Galileo's rather implausible denial that he had ever held Copernican ideas after 1616 or ever intended to defend them in the ''Dialogue'', his final interrogation, in July 1633, concluded with his being threatened with torture if he did not tell the truth, but he maintained his denial despite the threat.&lt;ref&gt;Sharratt ([[#Reference-Sharratt-1994|1994]], pp. 171–75); Heilbron ([[#CITEREFHeilbron2010|2010]], pp. 308–17); Gingerich ([[#Reference-Gingerich-1992|1992]], pp. 117–18).&lt;/ref&gt;

The sentence of the Inquisition was delivered on 22 June. It was in three essential parts:
* Galileo was found "vehemently suspect of heresy", namely of having held the opinions that the Sun lies motionless at the centre of the universe, that the Earth is not at its centre and moves, and that one may hold and defend an opinion as probable after it has been declared contrary to Holy Scripture. He was required to [[Abjuration|"abjure, curse and detest"]] those opinions.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Fantoli-2005|Fantoli (2005, p. 139)]], [[#Reference-Finocchiaro-1989|Finocchiaro (1989, pp. 288–93)]].

"Vehemently suspect of heresy" was a technical term of [[canon law]] and did not necessarily imply that the Inquisition considered the opinions giving rise to the verdict to be heretical. The same verdict would have been possible even if the opinions had been subject to only the less serious censure of "erroneous in faith" [[#Reference-Fantoli-2005|(Fantoli, 2005, p. 140]]; [[#Reference-Heilbron-2005|Heilbron, 2005, pp. 282–84)]].&lt;/ref&gt;
* He was sentenced to formal imprisonment at the pleasure of the Inquisition.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Finocchiaro-1989|Finocchiaro (1989]], pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=wKCZFJuMCaQC&amp;pg=PA38#v=onepage 38], 291, [https://books.google.com/books?id=wKCZFJuMCaQC&amp;pg=PA306#v=onepage 306)].

* His offending ''Dialogue'' was banned; and in an action not announced at the trial, publication of any of his works was forbidden, including any he might write in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{anchor|_note-publication-ban}}[[#Reference-Drake-1978|Drake (1978, p. 367)]], [[#Reference-Sharratt-1994|Sharratt (1994, p. 184)]], [[#Reference-Favaro-1890|Favaro]][http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?VOL=16&amp;VOLPAG=209 (1905, 16:209] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927230419/http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?VOL=16&amp;VOLPAG=209 |date=27 September 2007 }}, [http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?VOL=16&amp;VOLPAG=230 230)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927234122/http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?VOL=16&amp;VOLPAG=230 |date=27 September 2007 }} {{it icon}}.

[[File:E pur si muove.jpg|thumb|Portrait, attributed to Murillo, of Galileo gazing at the words "E pur si muove" (''[[E pur si muove!|And yet it moves]]'') (not legible in this image) scratched on the wall of his prison cell]]

According to popular legend, after recanting his theory that the Earth moved around the Sun, Galileo allegedly muttered the rebellious phrase ''"[[E pur si muove!|And yet it moves]]"''. A 1640s painting by the Spanish painter [[Bartolomé Esteban Murillo]] or an artist of his school, in which the words were hidden until restoration work in 1911, depicts an imprisoned Galileo apparently gazing at the words "E pur si muove" written on the wall of his dungeon. The earliest known written account of the legend dates to a century after his death, but Stillman Drake writes "there is no doubt now that the famous words were already attributed to Galileo before his death".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Drake-1978|Drake (1978, p. 356-7)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

After a period with the friendly [[Ascanio II Piccolomini|Ascanio Piccolomini]] (the Archbishop of [[Siena]]), Galileo was allowed to return to his villa at [[Arcetri]] near Florence in 1634, where he spent part of his life under house arrest. Galileo was ordered to read the [[Seven Penitential Psalms|seven penitential psalms]] once a week for the next three years. However, his daughter Maria Celeste relieved him of the burden after securing [[ecclesiastical]] permission to take it upon herself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unav.es/cryf/galileoaffair.html |title=The Galileo Affair |first=William |last=Shea |date=January 2006 |publisher=Grupo de Investigación sobre Ciencia, Razón y Fe (CRYF) |type=unpublished work |accessdate=12 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was while Galileo was under house arrest that he dedicated his time to one of his finest works, ''[[Two New Sciences]]''. Here he summarised work he had done some forty years earlier, on the two sciences now called [[kinematics]] and [[strength of materials]], published in Holland to avoid the censor. This book has received high praise from [[Albert Einstein]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen Hawking]], ed. p. 398, ''On the Shoulders of Giants'': "Galileo... is the father of modern [[physics]]—indeed of modern science"—[[Albert Einstein]].&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result of this work, Galileo is often called the "father of modern physics". He went completely blind in 1638 and was suffering from a painful [[hernia]] and [[insomnia]], so he was permitted to travel to Florence for medical advice.&lt;ref name="JoCarney"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Allan-Olney 1870" /&gt;

[[Dava Sobel]] argues that prior to Galileo's 1633 trial and judgement for heresy, Pope Urban VIII had become preoccupied with court intrigue and problems of state, and began to fear persecution or threats to his own life. In this context, Sobel argues that the problem of Galileo was presented to the pope by court insiders and enemies of Galileo. Having been accused of weakness in defending the church, Urban reacted against Galileo out of anger and fear.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Sobel-2000|Sobel (2000, pp. 232–4)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
[[File:Tomb of Galileo Galilei.JPG|thumb|left|Tomb of Galileo, [[Basilica di Santa Croce di Firenze|Santa Croce]], Florence]]

Galileo continued to receive visitors until 1642, when, after suffering fever and heart palpitations, he died on 8 January 1642, aged 77.&lt;ref name=JoCarney/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Catholic Encyclopedia |title=Galileo Galilei |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06342b.htm |prescript= |year=1909 |no-icon=1 | first=John |last=Gerard}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Grand Duke of Tuscany, [[Ferdinando II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Ferdinando II]], wished to bury him in the main body of the [[Basilica di Santa Croce di Firenze|Basilica of Santa Croce]], next to the tombs of his father and other ancestors, and to erect a marble mausoleum in his honour.&lt;ref name=funeral&gt;[[#Reference-Shea&amp;Artigas-2003|Shea &amp; Artigas (2003, p. 199)]]; [[#Reference-Sobel-2000|Sobel (2000, p. 378)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific contributions==
===Scientific methods===
Galileo made original contributions to the science of motion through an innovative combination of experiment and mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Sharratt-1994|Sharratt (1994, pp. 204–05)]]&lt;/ref&gt; More typical of science at the time were the qualitative studies of [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]], on magnetism and electricity. Galileo's father, [[Vincenzo Galilei]], a [[lute]]nist and music theorist, had performed experiments establishing perhaps the oldest known non-linear relation in physics: for a stretched string, the pitch varies as the square root of the tension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=H. F. |last=Cohen |date=1984 |title=Quantifying Music: The Science of Music at |pages=78–84 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-90-277-1637-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; These observations lay within the framework of the [[Pythagoras#Musical theories and investigations|Pythagorean]] tradition of music, well-known to instrument makers, which included the fact that subdividing a string by a whole number produces a harmonious scale. Thus, a limited amount of mathematics had long related music and physical science, and young Galileo could see his own father's observations expand on that tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Field |first=Judith Veronica |date=2005 |title=Piero Della Francesca: A Mathematician's Art |pages=317–320 |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=978-0-300-10342-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Galileo was one of the first modern thinkers to clearly state that the [[Physical law|laws of nature]] are mathematical. In ''[[The Assayer]]'', he wrote "Philosophy is written in this grand book, the universe&amp;nbsp;... It is written in the language of mathematics, and its characters are triangles, circles, and other geometric figures;...."&lt;ref&gt;In [[#Reference-Drake-1957|Drake (1957, pp. 237–238)]]&lt;/ref&gt; His mathematical analyses are a further development of a tradition employed by late scholastic natural philosophers, which Galileo learned when he studied philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, (1984).&lt;/ref&gt; His work marked another step towards the eventual separation of science from both philosophy and religion; a major development in human thought. He was often willing to change his views in accordance with observation. In order to perform his experiments, Galileo had to set up standards of length and time, so that measurements made on different days and in different laboratories could be compared in a reproducible fashion. This provided a reliable foundation on which to confirm mathematical laws using [[inductive reasoning]].

Galileo showed a modern appreciation for the proper relationship between mathematics, theoretical physics, and experimental physics. He understood the [[parabola]], both in terms of [[conic section]]s and in terms of the [[ordinate]] (y) varying as the square of the [[abscissa]] (x). Galilei further asserted that the parabola was the theoretically ideal [[trajectory]] of a uniformly accelerated projectile in the absence of [[air resistance]] or other disturbances. He conceded that there are limits to the validity of this theory, noting on theoretical grounds that a projectile trajectory of a size comparable to that of the [[Earth]] could not possibly be a parabola,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Sharratt-1994|Sharratt (1994, pp. 202–04)]], [[#Reference-Galileo-1954|Galilei (1954, pp. 250–52)]], [[#Reference-Favaro-1890|Favaro (1898)]], [http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?VOL=8&amp;VOLPAG=274 8:274–75] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927232006/http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?VOL=8&amp;VOLPAG=274 |date=27 September 2007 }} {{it icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he nevertheless maintained that for distances up to the range of the artillery of his day, the deviation of a projectile's trajectory from a parabola would be only very slight.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Sharratt-1994|Sharratt (1994, pp. 202–04)]], [[#Reference-Galileo-1954|Galilei (1954, pp. 252)]], [[#Reference-Favaro-1890|Favaro (1898)]], [http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?VOL=8&amp;VOLPAG=275 8:275] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108143814/http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?VOL=8&amp;VOLPAG=275 |date=8 January 2009 }} {{it icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Astronomy===
[[File:Bertini fresco of Galileo Galilei and Doge of Venice.jpg|thumb|right|
 Galileo showed the [[Doge of Venice]] how to use the telescope (fresco by [[Giuseppe Bertini]])]]
[[File:Galileo manuscript.png|thumb|It was on this page that Galileo first noted an observation of the [[natural satellite|moons]] of [[Jupiter]]. This observation upset the notion that all celestial bodies must revolve around the Earth. Galileo published a full description in ''Sidereus Nuncius'' in March 1610]] [[File:Phases-of-Venus.svg|thumb|The [[phases of Venus]], observed by Galileo in 1610]]

Based only on uncertain descriptions of the first practical telescope which [[Hans Lippershey]] tried to patent in the Netherlands in 1608,&lt;ref&gt;King ([[#CITEREFKing2003|2003]], pp.[https://books.google.com/books?id=KAWwzHlDVksC&amp;pg=PA30 30–32]). The Netherlands States-General would not grant Lippershey his requested patent (King, [[#CITEREFKing2003|2003]], p.[https://books.google.com/books?id=KAWwzHlDVksC&amp;pg=PA32 32]).&lt;/ref&gt; Galileo, in the following year, made a telescope with about 3x magnification. He later made improved versions with up to about 30x magnification.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Drake-1990|Drake (1990, pp. 133–34)]].&lt;/ref&gt; With a [[Refracting telescope#Galileo's telescope|Galilean telescope]], the observer could see magnified, upright images on the earth—it was what is commonly known as a terrestrial telescope or a spyglass. He could also use it to observe the sky; for a time he was one of those who could construct telescopes good enough for that purpose. On 25 August 1609, he demonstrated one of his early telescopes, with a magnification of about 8 or 9, to [[Venice|Venetian]] lawmakers. His telescopes were also a profitable sideline for Galileo, who sold them to merchants who found them useful both at sea and as items of trade. He published his initial telescopic astronomical observations in March 1610 in a brief treatise entitled ''[[Sidereus Nuncius]]'' (''Starry Messenger'').&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Sharratt-1994|Sharratt]] (1994, [https://books.google.com/books?id=-TgYAq3P0P8C&amp;pg=PA1 pp. 1–2])&lt;/ref&gt;

====Kepler's supernova====
Tycho and others had observed the supernova of 1572. Ottavio Brenzoni's letter of 15 January 1605 to Galileo brought the 1572 supernova and the less bright nova of 1601 to Galileo's notice. Galileo observed and discussed [[Kepler's Supernova|Kepler's supernova]] in 1604. Since these new stars displayed no detectable [[Parallax#Diurnal parallax|diurnal parallax]], Galileo concluded that they were distant stars, and, therefore, disproved the Aristotelian belief in the [[immutability of the heavens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Galileo and the new star  |bibcode=2004AsNow..18j..58K |first=Nicholas |last=Kollerstrom |authorlink=Nicholas Kollerstrom |date=October 2004 |journal=[[Astronomy Now]]|volume=18 |issue=10 |pages=58–59 |accessdate=20 February 2017 |url=http://www.dioi.org/kn/NewStar.pdf|issn=0951-9726}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Jupiter's moons====
On 7 January 1610, Galileo observed with his telescope what he described at the time as "three fixed stars, totally invisible{{efn|''i.e.'', invisible to the naked eye.}} by their smallness", all close to Jupiter, and lying on a straight line through it.&lt;ref name="jupiter's moons"&gt;[[#Reference-Drake-1978|Drake (1978, p. 146).]]&lt;/ref&gt; Observations on subsequent nights showed that the positions of these "stars" relative to Jupiter were changing in a way that would have been inexplicable if they had really been fixed stars. On 10 January, Galileo noted that one of them had disappeared, an observation which he attributed to its being hidden behind Jupiter. Within a few days, he concluded that they were [[orbit]]ing Jupiter:&lt;ref&gt;In ''Sidereus Nuncius'' [[#Reference-Favaro-1890|(Favaro]], [http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?VOL=3&amp;VOLPAG=81 1892, 3:81] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120127104726/http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?VOL=3&amp;VOLPAG=81 |date=27 January 2012 }} {{la icon}}) Galileo stated that he had reached this conclusion on 11 January. [[#Reference-Drake-1978|Drake (1978, p. 152)]], however, after studying unpublished manuscript records of Galileo's observations, concluded that he did not do so until 15 January.&lt;/ref&gt; he had discovered [[Moons of Jupiter|three of Jupiter's four largest moons]]. He discovered the fourth on 13 January. Galileo named the group of four the ''Medicean stars'', in honour of his future patron, [[Cosimo II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany]], and Cosimo's three brothers.&lt;ref name="medicean stars"&gt;[[#Reference-Sharratt-1994|Sharratt]] (1994, p. 17).&lt;/ref&gt; Later astronomers, however, renamed them ''[[Galilean moons|Galilean satellites]]'' in honour of their discoverer. These satellites were independently discovered by [[Simon Marius]] on 8 January 1610 and are now called [[Io (moon)|Io]], [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]], and [[Callisto (moon)|Callisto]] the names given by Marius in his ''Mundus Iovialis'' published in 1614.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pasachoff |first = Jay M. |date=May 2015 |title=Simon Marius's Mundus Iovialis: 400th Anniversary in Galileo's Shadow |journal=Journal for the History of Astronomy |volume=46 |issue=2 |pages=218–234 |doi=10.1177/0021828615585493  |bibcode = 2015JHA....46..218P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His observations of the satellites of Jupiter caused a revolution in astronomy: a planet with smaller planets orbiting it did not conform to the principles of [[On the Heavens|Aristotelian cosmology]], which held that all heavenly bodies should circle the Earth,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Linton-2004|Linton (2004, pp. 98,205)]], [[#Reference-Drake-1978|Drake (1978, p. 157)]].&lt;/ref&gt; and many astronomers and philosophers initially refused to believe that Galileo could have discovered such a thing.&lt;ref name=scepticism&gt;[[#Reference-Drake-1978|Drake (1978, pp. 158–68)]], [[#Reference-Sharratt-1994|Sharratt]] (1994, pp. 18–19).&lt;/ref&gt; His observations were confirmed by the observatory of [[Christopher Clavius]] and he received a hero's welcome when he visited Rome in 1611.&lt;ref&gt;''God's Philosophers'' ju James Hannam Orion 2009 p313&lt;/ref&gt; Galileo continued to observe the satellites over the next eighteen months, and by mid-1611, he had obtained remarkably accurate estimates for their periods—a feat which [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]] had believed impossible.&lt;ref name=periods&gt;[[#Reference-Drake-1978|Drake (1978, p. 168)]], [[#Reference-Sharratt-1994|Sharratt]] (1994, p. 93).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Venus, Saturn, and Neptune====
From September 1610, Galileo observed that [[Venus]] exhibited a full set of [[Lunar phase|phases]] similar to that of the [[Moon]]. The [[heliocentric model]] of the solar system developed by Nicolaus Copernicus predicted that all phases would be visible since the orbit of Venus around the [[Sun]] would cause its illuminated hemisphere to face the Earth when it was on the opposite side of the Sun and to face away from the Earth when it was on the Earth-side of the Sun. On the other hand, in [[geocentric model#Claudius Ptolemy|Ptolemy's geocentric model]] it was impossible for any of the planets' orbits to intersect the spherical shell carrying the Sun. Traditionally, the orbit of Venus was placed entirely on the near side of the Sun, where it could exhibit only crescent and new phases. It was, however, also possible to place it entirely on the far side of the Sun, where it could exhibit only gibbous and full phases. After Galileo's telescopic observations of the crescent, gibbous and full phases of Venus, the Ptolemaic model became untenable. Thus in the early 17th century, as a result of his discovery, the great majority of astronomers converted to one of the various geo-heliocentric planetary models,&lt;ref&gt;Thoren (1989), p. 8; Hoskin (1999) p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; such as the Tychonic, Capellan and Extended Capellan models,{{efn|In the Capellan model only Mercury and Venus orbit the Sun, whilst in its extended version such as expounded by Riccioli, Mars also orbits the Sun, but the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn are centred on the Earth}} each either with or without a daily rotating Earth. These all had the virtue of explaining the phases of Venus without the vice of the 'refutation' of full heliocentrism's prediction of stellar parallax. Galileo's discovery of the phases of Venus was thus arguably his most empirically practically influential contribution to the two-stage transition from full geocentrism to full heliocentrism via geo-heliocentrism.

Galileo observed the planet [[Saturn]], and at first mistook its rings for planets, thinking it was a three-bodied system. When he observed the planet later, Saturn's rings were directly oriented at Earth, causing him to think that two of the bodies had disappeared. The rings reappeared when he observed the planet in 1616, further confusing him.&lt;ref&gt;Baalke, Ron. [http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/saturn/back.html Historical Background of Saturn's Rings.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090321071339/http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/saturn/back.html |date=21 March 2009 }} Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, NASA. Retrieved on 2007-03-11&lt;/ref&gt;

Galileo also observed the planet [[Neptune]] in 1612. It appears in his notebooks as one of many unremarkable dim stars. He did not realise that it was a planet, but he did note its motion relative to the stars before losing track of it.&lt;ref&gt;Drake &amp; Kowal (1980)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sunspots====

[[File:Galileo galilei, telescopi del 1609-10 ca..JPG|thumb|Galileo's "cannocchiali" [[telescope]]s at the [[Museo Galileo]], Florence]]

Galileo made naked-eye and telescopic studies of [[sunspot]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Sun Recorded Through History |first1=J.M. |last1=Vaquero |first2=M. |last2=Vázquez |year=2010 |publisher=Springer}} Chapter 2, p. 77: "Drawing of the large sunspot seen by naked-eye by Galileo, and shown in the same way to everybody during the days 19, 20, and 21 August 1612"&lt;/ref&gt; Their existence raised another difficulty with the unchanging perfection of the heavens as posited in orthodox Aristotelian celestial physics. An apparent annual variation in their trajectories, observed by  [[Francesco Sizzi]] and others in 1612–1613,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Drake-1978|Drake (1978, p. 209)]].  Sizzi reported the observations he and his companions had made over the course of a year to Orazio Morandi in a letter dated 10 April 1613 [[#Reference-Favaro-1890|(Favaro]], [http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?VOL=11&amp;VOLPAG=491 1901, 11:491)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108162820/http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?VOL=11&amp;VOLPAG=491 |date=8 January 2009 }} {{it icon}}. Morandi subsequently forwarded a copy to Galileo.&lt;/ref&gt; also provided a powerful argument against both the Ptolemaic system and the geoheliocentric system of [[Tycho Brahe]].{{efn|In geostatic systems the apparent annual variation in the motion of sunspots could only be explained as the result of an implausibly complicated precession of the Sun's axis of rotation [[#Reference-Linton-2004|(Linton, 2004, p. 212;]] [[#Reference-Sharratt-1994|Sharratt]], 1994, p. 166; [[#Reference-Drake-1970|Drake, 1970, pp. 191–196)]]. This did not apply, however, to the modified version of Tycho's system introduced by his protegé, [[Longomontanus]], in which the Earth was assumed to rotate. Longomontanus's system could account for the apparent motions of sunspots just as well as the Copernican.}} A dispute over claimed priority in the discovery of sunspots, and in their interpretation, led Galileo to a long and bitter feud with the [[Jesuit]] [[Christoph Scheiner]].  In the middle was [[Mark Welser]], to whom Scheiner had announced his discovery, and who asked Galileo for his opinion.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} In fact, there is little doubt that both of them were beaten by [[David Fabricius]] and his son [[Johannes Fabricius|Johannes]].

====Moon====
Prior to Galileo's construction of his version of a telescope, [[Thomas Harriot]], an English mathematician and explorer, had already used what he dubbed a "perspective tube" to observe the moon. Reporting his observations, Harriot noted only "strange spottednesse" in the waning of the crescent, but was ignorant to the cause. Galileo, due in part to his artistic training&lt;ref name="panofsky"&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1086/348450 |last=Panofsky |first=Erwin |author-link=Erwin Panofsky |title=Galileo as a Critic of the Arts: Aesthetic Attitude and Scientific Thought |journal=Isis |volume=47 |issue=1 |pages=3–15 |date=1956 |jstor=227542}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the knowledge of [[chiaroscuro]],&lt;ref name="edgerton"&gt;Edgerton, Samuel Y. ''The Mirror, the Window, and the Telescope'', 2009&lt;/ref&gt; had understood the patterns of light and shadow were, in fact, topographical markers. While not being the only one to observe the moon through a telescope, Galileo was the first to deduce the cause of the uneven waning as light occlusion from lunar mountains and [[impact crater|craters]]. In his study, he also made topographical charts, estimating the heights of the mountains. The moon was not what was long thought to have been a translucent and perfect sphere, as Aristotle claimed, and hardly the first "planet", an "eternal pearl to magnificently ascend into the heavenly empyrian", as put forth by [[Dante]]. Galileo is sometimes credited with the discovery of the [[Libration#Lunar libration|lunar libration in latitude]] in 1632,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor=Jacqueline Bergeron| title =Highlights of Astronomy: As Presented at the XXIst General Assembly of the IAU, 1991| publisher =Springer Science &amp; Business Media| year =2013| page =521| isbn =978-9401128285}}&lt;/ref&gt; although [[Thomas Harriot]] or [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]] might have done it before.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url =http://rsnr.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/63/2/163 |title=Harriot's maps of the Moon: new interpretations|journal=Notes and Records of the Royal Society|volume=63|issue=2|pages=163–168|author=Stephen Pumfrey| date=15 April 2009| accessdate =18 June 2018|doi=10.1098/rsnr.2008.0062}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Milky Way and stars====
Galileo observed the [[Milky Way]], previously believed to be [[Nebula|nebulous]], and found it to be a multitude of [[star]]s packed so densely that they appeared from Earth to be clouds. He located many other stars too distant to be visible with the naked eye. He observed the double star [[Mizar (star)|Mizar]] in Ursa Major in 1617.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Ondra-2004|Ondra (2004), p. 72–73]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Starry Messenger'', Galileo reported that stars appeared as mere blazes of light, essentially unaltered in appearance by the telescope, and contrasted them to planets, which the telescope revealed to be discs. But shortly thereafter, in his ''[[Letters on Sunspots]]'', he reported that the telescope revealed the shapes of both stars and planets to be "quite round". From that point forward, he continued to report that telescopes showed the roundness of stars, and that stars seen through the telescope measured a few seconds of arc in diameter.&lt;ref&gt;Graney (2010, p. 455); Graney &amp; Grayson (2011, p. 353).&lt;/ref&gt; He also devised a method for measuring the apparent size of a star without a telescope. As described in his ''Dialogue Concerning the two Chief World Systems'', his method was to hang a thin rope in his line of sight to the star and measure the maximum distance from which it would wholly obscure the star. From his measurements of this distance and of the width of the rope, he could calculate the angle subtended by the star at his viewing point.&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFVan Helden1985|Van Helden]], (1985, [https://books.google.com/books?id=L-yb7GX9mQIC&amp;pg=PA75 p. 75]); [[#CITEREFChalmers1999|Chalmers]], (1999, [https://books.google.com/books?id=WQh5wDlE8cwC&amp;pg=PA25 p. 25]); [[#CITEREFGalilei1953|Galilei]] (1953, pp. 361–62).&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''Dialogue'', he reported that he had found the apparent diameter of a star of [[stellar magnitude|first magnitude]] to be no more than 5 [[arcsecond]]s, and that of one of sixth magnitude to be about &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; arcseconds. Like most astronomers of his day, Galileo did not recognise that the apparent sizes of stars that he measured were spurious, caused by diffraction and atmospheric distortion (see [[Astronomical seeing#The effects of astronomical seeing|seeing disk]] or [[Airy disk]]), and did not represent the true sizes of stars. However, Galileo's values were much smaller than previous estimates of the apparent sizes of the brightest stars, such as those made by [[Tycho brahe#Tycho's geo-heliocentric astronomy|Tycho Brahe]] (see [[Magnitude (astronomy)|Magnitude]]) and enabled Galileo to counter anti-Copernican arguments such as those made by Tycho that these stars would have to be absurdly large for their annual parallaxes to be undetectable.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Finocchiaro-1989|Finocchiaro (1989, pp. 167–76)]], [[#CITEREFGalilei1953|Galilei (1953, pp. 359–60)]], [[#Reference-Ondra-2004|Ondra (2004, pp. 74–5)]].&lt;/ref&gt; Other astronomers such as [[Simon Marius]], [[Giovanni Battista Riccioli]], and [[Martin van den Hove|Martinus Hortensius]] made similar measurements of stars, and Marius and Riccioli concluded the smaller sizes were not small enough to answer Tycho's argument.&lt;ref&gt;Graney (2010, p. 454-462); Graney &amp; Grayson (2011, p. 352-355).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Engineering===
[[File:Galileo's geometrical and military compass in Putnam Gallery, 2009-11-24.jpg|thumb|Galileo's [[sector (instrument)|geometrical and military compass]], thought to have been made c. 1604 by his personal instrument-maker [[Marc'Antonio Mazzoleni]]]]

Galileo made a number of contributions to what is now known as [[engineering]], as distinct from pure [[physics]]. Between 1595 and 1598, Galileo devised and improved a [[sector (instrument)|geometric and military compass]] suitable for use by [[artillery|gunners]] and [[surveying|surveyors]]. This expanded on earlier instruments designed by [[Niccolò Tartaglia]] and [[Guidobaldo del Monte]]. For gunners, it offered, in addition to a new and safer way of elevating [[cannon]]s accurately, a way of quickly computing the charge of [[gunpowder]] for [[Round shot|cannonballs]] of different sizes and materials. As a geometric instrument, it enabled the construction of any regular [[polygon]], computation of the area of any polygon or circular sector, and a variety of other calculations. Under Galileo's direction, instrument maker [[Marc'Antonio Mazzoleni]] produced more than 100 of these compasses, which Galileo sold (along with an instruction manual he wrote) for 50 lire and offered a course of instruction in the use of the compasses for 120 lire.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Reston-2000|Reston (2000, p. 56).]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Timeline of temperature and pressure measurement technology|about 1593]], Galileo constructed a [[Galileo thermometer|thermometer]], using the expansion and contraction of air in a bulb to move water in an attached tube.

[[File:Galileo telescope replica.jpg|thumb|left|A replica of the earliest surviving telescope attributed to Galileo Galilei, on display at the [[Griffith Observatory]].]]

In 1609, Galileo was, along with Englishman [[Thomas Harriot]] and others, among the first to use a [[refracting telescope]] as an instrument to observe stars, planets or moons. The name "telescope" was coined for Galileo's instrument by a Greek mathematician, [[Giovanni Demisiani]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Sobel-2000|Sobel (2000, p. 43)]], [[#Reference-Drake-1978|Drake (1978, p. 196)]]. In the ''Starry Messenger'', written in Latin, Galileo had used the term "perspicillum".&lt;/ref&gt; at a banquet held in 1611 by Prince [[Federico Cesi]] to make Galileo a member of his [[Accademia dei Lincei]].&lt;ref&gt;Rosen, Edward, ''The Naming of the Telescope'' (1947)&lt;/ref&gt; The name was derived from the Greek ''tele'' = 'far' and ''skopein'' = 'to look or see'.

The actual inventors of the telescope and microscope remain debatable.

In 1612, having determined the orbital periods of Jupiter's satellites, Galileo proposed that with sufficiently accurate knowledge of their orbits, one could use their positions as a universal clock, and this would make possible the determination of [[longitude]]. He worked on this problem from time to time during the remainder of his life, but the practical problems were severe. The method was first successfully applied by [[Giovanni Domenico Cassini]] in 1681 and was later used extensively for large land surveys; this method, for example, was used to survey France, and later by [[Zebulon Pike]] of the midwestern United States in 1806. For sea navigation, where delicate telescopic observations were more difficult, the longitude problem eventually required development of a practical portable [[marine chronometer]], such as that of [[John Harrison]].&lt;ref&gt;''Longitude: the true story of a lone genius who solved the greatest scientific problem of his time'', Dava Sobel Penguin, 1996 {{ISBN|0-14-025879-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-14-025879-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Late in his life, when totally blind, Galileo designed an [[escapement]] mechanism for a pendulum clock (called [[Galileo's escapement]]), although no clock using this was built until after the first fully operational pendulum clock was made by [[Christiaan Huygens]] in the 1650s.

Galileo was invited on several occasions to advise on engineering schemes to alleviate river flooding.  In 1630 Mario Guiducci was probably instrumental in ensuring that he was consulted on a [[Mario Guiducci#Hydrology of the Bisenzio River|scheme by Bartolotti]] to cut a new channel for the [[Bisenzio (river)|Bisenzio River]] near Florence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=https://www.academia.edu/28086359 |title=Galileo, Guiducci and the Engineer Bartolotti on the Bisenzio River |author=Cesare S.

===Physics===

Galileo's theoretical and experimental work on the motions of bodies, along with the largely independent work of Kepler and [[René Descartes]], was a precursor of the [[classical mechanics]] developed by [[Isaac Newton|Sir Isaac Newton]]. Galileo conducted several experiments with [[pendulum]]s. It is popularly believed (thanks to the biography by [[Vincenzo Viviani]]) that these began by watching the swings of the bronze chandelier in the cathedral of Pisa, using his pulse as a timer. Later experiments are described in his ''[[Two New Sciences]]''. Galileo claimed that a simple pendulum is [[Pendulum#Period of oscillation|isochronous]], i.e. that its swings always take the same amount of time, independently of the [[amplitude]]. In fact, this is only approximately true,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Newton |first=R. G. |date=2004 |title=Galileo's Pendulum: From the Rhythm of Time to the Making of Matter |page=51 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-01331-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; as was discovered by [[Christiaan Huygens]]. Galileo also found that the square of the period varies directly with the length of the pendulum. Galileo's son, Vincenzo, sketched a clock based on his father's theories in 1642. The clock was never built and, because of the large swings required by its [[verge escapement]], would have been a poor timekeeper. (See [[#Engineering|Engineering]] above.)

Galileo is lesser known for, yet still credited with, being one of the first to understand sound frequency. By scraping a chisel at different speeds, he linked the pitch of the sound produced to the spacing of the chisel's skips, a measure of frequency. In 1638, Galileo described an experimental method to measure the [[Speed of light#Measurement|speed of light]] by arranging that two observers, each having lanterns equipped with shutters, observe each other's lanterns at some distance. The first observer opens the shutter of his lamp, and, the second, upon seeing the light, immediately opens the shutter of his own lantern. The time between the first observer's opening his shutter and seeing the light from the second observer's lamp indicates the time it takes light to travel back and forth between the two observers. Galileo reported that when he tried this at a distance of less than a mile, he was unable to determine whether or not the light appeared instantaneously.&lt;ref&gt;Galileo Galilei, ''Two New Sciences,'' (Madison: Univ. of Wisconsin Pr., 1974) p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometime between Galileo's death and 1667, the members of the Florentine ''[[Accademia del Cimento]]'' repeated the experiment over a distance of about a mile and obtained a similarly inconclusive result.&lt;ref&gt;I. Bernard Cohen, "Roemer and the First Determination of the Velocity of Light (1676)", ''Isis'', 31 (1940): 327–379, see pp. 332–333&lt;/ref&gt; We now know that the speed of light is far too fast to be measured by such methods (with human shutter-openers on Earth).

Galileo put forward [[Galilean invariance|the basic principle of relativity]], that the laws of physics are the same in any system that is moving at a constant speed in a straight line, regardless of its particular speed or direction. Hence, there is no absolute motion or absolute rest. This principle provided the basic framework for Newton's laws of motion and is central to [[Albert Einstein|Einstein's]] [[special theory of relativity]].

====Falling bodies====
{{see also|Equations for a falling body}}

A biography by Galileo's pupil [[Vincenzo Viviani]] stated that Galileo had [[Galileo's Leaning Tower of Pisa experiment|dropped balls]] of the same material, but different [[mass]]es, from the [[Leaning Tower of Pisa]] to demonstrate that their time of descent was independent of their mass.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Drake-1978|Drake (1978, pp. 19,20)]]. At the time when Viviani asserts that the experiment took place, Galileo had not yet formulated the final version of his law of free fall. He had, however, formulated an earlier version which predicted that bodies ''of the same material'' falling through the same medium would fall at the same speed [[#Reference-Drake-1978|(Drake, 1978, p. 20)]].&lt;/ref&gt; This was contrary to what Aristotle had taught: that heavy objects fall faster than lighter ones, in direct proportion to weight.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Drake-1978|Drake (1978, p. 9)]]; [[#Reference-Sharratt-1994|Sharratt (1994, p. 31)]].&lt;/ref&gt; While this story has been retold in popular accounts, there is no account by Galileo himself of such an experiment, and it is generally accepted by historians that it was at most a [[thought experiment]] which did not actually take place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Groleau |first=Rick |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/galileo/experiments.html |title=Galileo's Battle for the Heavens.

[[File:Apollo 15 feather and hammer drop.ogv|right|thumb|During the [[Apollo 15]] mission in 1971, astronaut [[David Scott]] showed that Galileo was right: acceleration is the same for all bodies subject to gravity on the Moon, even for a hammer and a feather.]]

In his 1638 ''Discorsi'', Galileo's character Salviati, widely regarded as Galileo's spokesman, held that all unequal weights would fall with the same finite speed in a vacuum. But this had previously been proposed by [[Lucretius]]&lt;ref&gt;Lucretius, ''De rerum natura'' II, 225–229; Relevant passage appears in: Lane Cooper, ''Aristotle, Galileo, and the Tower of Pisa'' (Ithaca, N.Y.: [[Cornell University Press]], 1935), p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Simon Stevin]].&lt;ref&gt;Simon Stevin, ''De Beghinselen des Waterwichts, Anvang der Waterwichtdaet, en de Anhang komen na de Beghinselen der Weeghconst en de Weeghdaet'' [The Elements of Hydrostatics, Preamble to the Practice of Hydrostatics, and Appendix to The Elements of the Statics and The Practice of Weighing] (Leiden, Netherlands: [[Christoffel Plantijn]], 1586) reports an experiment by Stevin and Jan Cornets de Groot in which they dropped lead balls from a church tower in Delft; relevant passage is translated in: [[E. J. Dijksterhuis]], ed., ''The Principal Works of Simon Stevin'' Amsterdam, Netherlands: C. V. Swets &amp; Zeitlinger, 1955 vol. 1, pp. 509, 511.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cristiano Banti]]'s [[Filippo Salviati|Salviati]] also held it could be experimentally demonstrated by the comparison of pendulum motions in air with bobs of lead and of cork which had different weight but which were otherwise similar.

Galileo proposed that a falling body would fall with a uniform acceleration, as long as the resistance of the medium through which it was falling remained negligible, or in the limiting case of its falling through a vacuum.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Sharratt-1994|Sharratt (1994, p. 203)]], [[#Reference-Galileo-1954|Galilei]] [http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=753&amp;chapter=109969&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27#a_2289356 (1954, pp. 251–54)].&lt;/ref&gt; He also derived the correct kinematical law for the distance travelled during a uniform acceleration starting from rest—namely, that it is proportional to the square of the elapsed time (&amp;nbsp;''d''&amp;nbsp;∝&amp;nbsp;''t''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Sharratt-1994|Sharratt (1994, p. 198)]], [[#Reference-Galileo-1954|Galilei]] [http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=753&amp;chapter=109916&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27#a_2289015 (1954, p. 174)].&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to Galileo, [[Nicole Oresme]], in the 14th century, had derived the times-squared law for uniformly accelerated change,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Clagett-1968|Clagett (1968, p. 561)]]. Oresme, however, regarded this discovery as a purely intellectual exercise having no relevance to the description of any natural phenomena, and consequently failed to recognise any connection with the motion of falling bodies ([[#CITEREFGrant1996|Grant]], 1996, [https://books.google.com/books?id=YyvmEyX6rZgC&amp;pg=PA103#v=onepage p.103]).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Domingo de Soto]] had suggested in the 16th century that bodies falling through a homogeneous medium would be uniformly accelerated.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Sharratt-1994|Sharratt (1994, p. 198)]], [[#Reference-Wallace-2004|Wallace (2004, pp.II 384, II 400, III 272)]] Soto, however, did not anticipate many of the qualifications and refinements contained in Galileo's theory of falling bodies. He did not, for instance, recognise, as Galileo did, that a body would fall with a strictly uniform acceleration only in a vacuum, and that it would otherwise eventually reach a uniform terminal velocity.&lt;/ref&gt; Galileo expressed the time-squared law using geometrical constructions and mathematically precise words, adhering to the standards of the day. (It remained for others to re-express the law in algebraic terms).

He also concluded that objects ''retain their velocity'' in the absence of any impediments to their motion,{{Citation needed|date= January 2016}} thereby contradicting the generally accepted Aristotelian hypothesis that a body could only remain in so-called [[Aristotelian physics#Unnatural motion|"violent", "unnatural", or "forced" motion]] so long as an agent of change (the "mover") continued to act on it.&lt;ref&gt;Jung ([[#CITEREFJung2011|2011]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=x5FiMR3kd_8C&amp;pg=PA540#v=onepage p.504]). This aspect of Aristotle's theory of motion is covered in Books VII and VIII of his ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophical ideas relating to [[inertia]] had been proposed by [[John Philoponus]] and [[Jean Buridan]]. Galileo stated: "Imagine any particle projected along a horizontal plane without friction; then we know, from what has been more fully explained in the preceding pages, that this particle will move along this same plane with a motion which is uniform and perpetual, provided the plane has no limits"&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Galileo-1954|Galilei]], (1954, [http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/753#Galileo_0416_799 p.268]) or [[Inertia#Classical inertia]]&lt;/ref&gt; This was incorporated into [[Newton's laws of motion]] (first law).

===Mathematics===
While Galileo's application of mathematics to experimental physics was innovative, his mathematical methods were the standard ones of the day, including dozens of examples of an inverse proportion [[square root]] method passed down from [[Fibonacci]] and [[Archimedes]]. The analysis and proofs relied heavily on the [[Eudoxus of Cnidus#Mathematics|Eudoxian theory of proportion]], as set forth in the fifth book of [[Euclid's Elements]]. This theory had become available only a century before, thanks to accurate translations by [[Niccolò Tartaglia|Tartaglia]] and others; but by the end of Galileo's life, it was being superseded by the algebraic methods of [[René Descartes|Descartes]].

The concept now named [[Galileo's paradox]] was not original with him. His proposed solution, that [[infinite number]]s cannot be compared, is no longer considered useful.

===Later Church reassessments===
The Galileo affair was largely forgotten after Galileo's death, and the controversy subsided. The Inquisition's ban on reprinting Galileo's works was lifted in 1718 when permission was granted to publish an edition of his works (excluding the condemned ''Dialogue'') in Florence.&lt;ref name="incomplete works"&gt;[[#Reference-Heilbron-2005|Heilbron (2005, p. 299)]].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1741, [[Pope Benedict XIV]] authorised the publication of an edition of Galileo's complete scientific works{{efn|Two of his non-scientific works, the letters to Castelli and the Grand Duchess Christina, were explicitly not allowed to be included [[#Reference-Coyne-2005|(Coyne 2005, p. 347)]].}} which included a mildly censored version of the ''Dialogue''.&lt;ref name="complete works 2"&gt;[[#Reference-Heilbron-2005|Heilbron (2005, pp. 303–04)]]; [[#Reference-Coyne-2005|Coyne (2005, p. 347)]]. The uncensored version of the ''Dialogue'' remained on the Index of prohibited books, however [[#Reference-Heilbron-2005|(Heilbron 2005, p. 279)]].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1758, the general prohibition against works advocating heliocentrism was removed from the [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum|Index of prohibited books]], although the specific ban on uncensored versions of the ''Dialogue'' and Copernicus's ''De Revolutionibus'' remained.&lt;ref name="ban not lifted"&gt;[[#Reference-Heilbron-2005|Heilbron (2005, p. 307)]]; [[#Reference-Coyne-2005|Coyne (2005, p. 347)]] The practical effect of the ban in its later years seems to have been that clergy could publish discussions of heliocentric physics with a formal disclaimer assuring its hypothetical character and their obedience to the church decrees against motion of the earth: see for example the commented edition (1742) of Newton's 'Principia' by Fathers Le Seur and Jacquier, which contains such a disclaimer ('Declaratio') before the third book (Propositions 25 onwards) dealing with the lunar theory.&lt;/ref&gt; All traces of official opposition to heliocentrism by the church disappeared in 1835 when these works were finally dropped from the Index.&lt;ref name="ban lifted"&gt;[[#Reference-McMullin-2005|McMullin (2005, p. 6)]]; [[#Reference-Coyne-2005|Coyne (2005, p. 346)]]. In fact, the Church's opposition had effectively ended in 1820 when a Catholic canon, Giuseppe Settele, was given permission to publish a work which treated heliocentrism as a physical fact rather than a mathematical fiction. The 1835 edition of the Index was the first to be issued after that year.&lt;/ref&gt;

Interest in the Galileo affair was revived in the early 19th century, when Protestant polemicists used it (and other events such as the Spanish Inquisition and the [[myth of the flat Earth]]) to attack Roman Catholicism.&lt;ref name="Hannam, James 2011. p329-344"/&gt; Interest in it has waxed and waned ever since. In 1939, [[Pope Pius XII]], in his first speech to the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, within a few months of his election to the papacy, described Galileo as being among the "most audacious heroes of research... not afraid of the stumbling blocks and the risks on the way, nor fearful of the funereal monuments".&lt;ref&gt;Discourse of His Holiness Pope Pius XII given on 3 December 1939 at the Solemn Audience granted to the Plenary Session of the Academy, Discourses of the Popes from Pius XI to John Paul II to the [[Pontifical Academy of Sciences|Pontifical Academy of the Sciences]] 1939–1986, Vatican City, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; His close advisor of 40 years, Professor Robert Leiber, wrote: "Pius XII was very careful not to close any doors (to science) prematurely. He was energetic on this point and regretted that in the case of Galileo."&lt;ref&gt;Robert Leiber, Pius XII Stimmen der Zeit, November 1958 in Pius XII. Sagt, Frankfurt 1959, p. 411&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 February 1990, in a speech delivered at the [[Sapienza University of Rome]],{{efn|An earlier version had been delivered on 16 December 1989, in Rieti, and a later version in Madrid on 24 February 1990 [[#Reference-Ratzinger-1994|(Ratzinger, 1994, p. 81)]]. According to Feyerabend himself, Ratzinger had also mentioned him "in support of" his own views in a speech in Parma around the same time [[#Reference-Feyerabend-1995|(Feyerabend, 1995, p. 178)]].}} Cardinal Ratzinger (later [[Pope Benedict XVI]]) cited some current views on the Galileo affair as forming what he called "a symptomatic case that permits us to see how deep the self-doubt of the modern age, of science and technology goes today".&lt;ref name="self-doubt"&gt;Ratzinger [[#Reference-Ratzinger-1994|(1994, p. 98)]].&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the views he cited were those of the philosopher [[Paul Feyerabend]], whom he quoted as saying "The Church at the time of Galileo kept much more closely to reason than did Galileo himself, and she took into consideration the ethical and social consequences of Galileo's teaching too. Her verdict against Galileo was rational and just and the revision of this verdict can be justified only on the grounds of what is politically opportune."&lt;ref name="self-doubt"/&gt; The Cardinal did not clearly indicate whether he agreed or disagreed with Feyerabend's assertions. He did, however, say "It would be foolish to construct an impulsive apologetic on the basis of such views."&lt;ref name="self-doubt"/&gt;

On 31 October 1992, [[Pope John Paul II]] expressed regret for how the Galileo affair was handled, and issued a declaration acknowledging the errors committed by the Catholic Church tribunal that judged the scientific positions of Galileo Galilei, as the result of a study conducted by the [[Pontifical Council for Culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=[[New Scientist]] |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg13618460.600-vatican-admits-galileo-was-right-.html |title=Vatican admits Galileo was right |date=1992-11-07 |accessdate=2007-08-09 |issue=1846}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |publisher=[[BBC News]] |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7188860.stm |title=Papal visit scuppered by scholars |date=2008-01-15 |accessdate=2008-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2008, the head of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, [[Nicola Cabibbo]], announced a plan to honour Galileo by erecting a statue of him inside the Vatican walls.&lt;ref&gt;Owen &amp; Delaney [[#CITEREFOwenDelaney2008|(2008)]].&lt;/ref&gt; In December of the same year, during events to mark the 400th anniversary of Galileo's earliest telescopic observations, Pope Benedict XVI praised his contributions to astronomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |publisher=[[BBC News]] |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7794668.stm |title=Pope praises Galileo's astronomy |date=2008-12-21 |accessdate=2008-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; A month later, however, the head of the Pontifical Council for Culture, Gianfranco Ravasi, revealed that the plan to erect a statue of Galileo in the grounds of the Vatican had been suspended.&lt;ref&gt;Owen [[#CITEREFOwen2009|(2009)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impact on modern science===
According to [[Stephen Hawking]], Galileo probably bears more of the responsibility for the birth of modern science than anybody else,&lt;ref name="Hawking galileo"&gt;[[#Reference-Hawking-1988|Hawking (1988, p. 179)]].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Albert Einstein]] called him the father of modern science.&lt;ref name="father of science Einstein"&gt;[[#Reference-Einstein-1954|Einstein (1954, p. 271)]]. "Propositions arrived at by purely logical means are completely empty as regards reality. Because Galileo realised this, and particularly because he drummed it into the scientific world, he is the father of modern physics—indeed, of modern science altogether."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Hawking, [http://www.medici.org/press/galileo-and-birth-modern-science ''Galileo and the Birth of Modern Science''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324162930/http://www.medici.org/press/galileo-and-birth-modern-science |date=24 March 2012 }}, American Heritage's Invention &amp; Technology, Spring 2009, Vol. 24, No. 1, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

Galileo's astronomical discoveries and investigations into the Copernican theory have led to a lasting legacy which includes the categorisation of the four large moons of [[Jupiter]] discovered by Galileo ([[Io (moon)|Io]], [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]] and [[Callisto (moon)|Callisto]]) as the [[Galilean moons]]. Other scientific endeavours and principles are named after Galileo including the [[Galileo (spacecraft)|Galileo spacecraft]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fischer |first=Daniel |date=2001 |title=Mission Jupiter: The Spectacular Journey of the ''Galileo'' Spacecraft |pages=v |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-0-387-98764-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Ref. mentions both the moons and the spacecraft. --&gt; the first spacecraft to enter orbit around Jupiter, the proposed [[Galileo (satellite navigation)|Galileo]] [[Global Navigation Satellite System|global satellite navigation system]], the [[Transformation (geometry)|transformation]] between [[inertial system]]s in [[classical mechanics]] denoted [[Galilean transformation]] and the [[Gal (unit)]], sometimes known as the ''Galileo,'' which is a non-[[SI]] unit of [[acceleration]].

Partly because 2009 was the fourth centenary of Galileo's first recorded astronomical observations with the telescope, the United Nations scheduled it to be the [[International Year of Astronomy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization |date=11 August 2005 |title=Proclamation of 2009 as International year of Astronomy |url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001403/140317e.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=UNESCO |accessdate=2008-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; A global scheme was laid out by the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU), also endorsed by [[UNESCO]]—the [[UN]] body responsible for educational, scientific and cultural matters. The [[International Year of Astronomy]] 2009 was intended to be a global celebration of astronomy and its contributions to society and culture, stimulating worldwide interest not only in astronomy but science in general, with a particular slant towards young people.

[[Asteroid]] [[697 Galilea]] is named in his honour.

===In artistic and popular media===
Galileo is mentioned several times in the "opera" section of the [[Queen (band)|Queen]] song, "[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://everything2.com/title/Bohemian+Rhapsody|title=Bohemian Rhapsody|publisher=everything2|accessdate=2010-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; He features prominently in the song "[[Galileo (Indigo Girls song)|Galileo]]" performed by the [[Indigo Girls]] and [[Amy Grant]]'s ''Galileo'' on her ''Heart in Motion'' album.

Twentieth-century plays have been written on Galileo's life, including ''[[Life of Galileo]]'' (1943) by the German playwright [[Bertolt Brecht]], with a [[Galileo (1975 film)|film adaptation]] (1975) of it, and ''[[Lamp At Midnight]]'' (1947) by [[Barrie Stavis]],&lt;ref&gt;Stavis, Barrie. ''Lamp at Midnight''. South Brunswick, New Jersey: A.S. Barnes, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the 2008 play "Galileo Galilei".&lt;ref&gt;Lalonde, Robert. [https://archive.org/details/GalileoGalileivesaliusAndServetus Galileo Galilei/Vesalius and Servetus]. February 2008. {{ISBN|978-0-9783909-1-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kim Stanley Robinson]] wrote a science fiction novel entitled ''[[Galileo's Dream]]'' (2009), in which Galileo is brought into the future to help resolve a crisis of scientific philosophy; the story moves back and forth between Galileo's own time and a hypothetical distant future and contains a great deal of biographical information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Robinson |first=Kim Stanley |author-link=Kim_Stanley_Robinson |title=Galileo's Dream |publisher=Ballantine Books |place=New York |date=2009 |isbn=978-0-553-80659-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Galileo Galilei was recently selected as a main motif for a high value collectors' coin: the €25 [[Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Austria)#2009 Coinage|International Year of Astronomy commemorative coin]], minted in 2009. This coin also commemorates the 400th anniversary of the invention of [[Refracting telescope#Galileo's telescope|Galileo's telescope]]. The obverse shows a portion of his portrait and his telescope. The background shows one of his first drawings of the surface of the moon. In the silver ring, other telescopes are depicted: the [[Isaac Newton Telescope]], the observatory in [[Kremsmünster Abbey]], a modern telescope, a [[radio telescope]] and a [[Space observatory|space telescope]]. In 2009, the [[Galileoscope]] was also released. This is a mass-produced, low-cost educational {{convert|2|in|mm|adj=on}} telescope with relatively high quality.

Galileo's early works describing scientific instruments include the 1586 tract entitled ''The Little Balance'' (''La Billancetta'') describing an accurate balance to weigh objects in air or water&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://galileo.rice.edu/sci/instruments/balance.html|title=Hydrostatic balance|publisher=The Galileo Project|accessdate=2008-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1606 printed manual ''Le Operazioni del Compasso Geometrico et Militare'' on the operation of a geometrical and military compass.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://hsci.ou.edu/exhibits/exhibit.php?exbgrp=1&amp;exbid=10&amp;exbpg=1 |title=The Works of Galileo |publisher=The University of Oklahoma, College of Arts and Sciences |accessdate=2008-07-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100717090321/http://hsci.ou.edu/exhibits/exhibit.php?exbgrp=1&amp;exbid=10&amp;exbpg=1 |archivedate=17 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His early works in dynamics, the science of motion and mechanics were his ''circa'' 1590 Pisan ''[[De Motu Antiquiora|De Motu]]'' (On Motion) and his ''circa'' 1600 Paduan ''Le Meccaniche'' (Mechanics). The former was based on Aristotelian–Archimedean fluid dynamics and held that the speed of gravitational fall in a fluid medium was proportional to the excess of a body's specific weight over that of the medium, whereby in a vacuum, bodies would fall with speeds in proportion to their specific weights. It also subscribed to the Philoponan [[impetus dynamics]] in which impetus is self-dissipating and free-fall in a vacuum would have an essential terminal speed according to specific weight after an initial period of acceleration.

Galileo's 1610 ''[[Sidereus Nuncius|The Starry Messenger]]'' (''Sidereus Nuncius'') was the first scientific treatise to be published based on observations made through a telescope. It reported his discoveries of:

*the [[Galilean moons]]
*the roughness of the Moon's surface
*the existence of a large number of stars invisible to the naked eye, particularly those responsible for the appearance of the [[Milky Way]]
*differences between the appearances of the planets and those of the fixed stars—the former appearing as small discs, while the latter appeared as unmagnified points of light

Galileo published a description of sunspots in 1613 entitled ''[[Letters on Sunspots]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://hsci.ou.edu/exhibits/exhibit.php?exbgrp=1&amp;exbid=13&amp;exbpg=2 |title=Sunspots and Floating Bodies |publisher=The University of Oklahoma, College of Arts and Sciences |accessdate=2008-07-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081024203933/http://hsci.ou.edu/exhibits/exhibit.php?exbgrp=1&amp;exbid=13&amp;exbpg=2 |archivedate=24 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting the Sun and heavens are corruptible. The ''Letters on Sunspots'' also reported his 1610 telescopic observations of the full set of phases of Venus, and his discovery of the puzzling "appendages" of Saturn and their even more puzzling subsequent disappearance. In 1615, Galileo prepared a manuscript known as the "[[Letter to the Grand Duchess Christina]]" which was not published in printed form until 1636. This letter was a revised version of the ''Letter to Castelli'', which was denounced by the Inquisition as an incursion upon theology by advocating Copernicanism both as physically true and as consistent with Scripture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://hsci.ou.edu/exhibits/exhibit.php?exbgrp=1&amp;exbid=14&amp;exbpg=3 |title=Galileo, Letter to the Grand Duchess Christina |publisher=The University of Oklahoma, College of Arts and Sciences |accessdate=2008-07-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100716205613/http://hsci.ou.edu/exhibits/exhibit.php?exbgrp=1&amp;exbid=14&amp;exbpg=3 |archivedate=16 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1616, after the order by the inquisition for Galileo not to hold or defend the Copernican position, Galileo wrote the "[[Discourse on the Tides]]" (''Discorso sul flusso e il reflusso del mare'') based on the Copernican earth, in the form of a private letter to [[Alessandro Orsini (cardinal)|Cardinal Orsini]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://galileo.rice.edu/sci/observations/tides.html|title=Galileo's Theory of the Tides|publisher=The Galileo Project|accessdate=2008-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1619, Mario Guiducci, a pupil of Galileo's, published a lecture written largely by Galileo under the title ''Discourse on the Comets'' (''Discorso Delle Comete''), arguing against the Jesuit interpretation of comets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://galileo.rice.edu/chron/galileo.html|title=Galileo Timeline|publisher=The Galileo Project|accessdate=2008-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1623, Galileo published ''[[The Assayer]]—Il Saggiatore'', which attacked theories based on Aristotle's authority and promoted experimentation and the mathematical formulation of scientific ideas. The book was highly successful and even found support among the higher echelons of the Christian church.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://muse.tau.ac.il/museum/galileo/galileo.html|title=Galileo Galilei|publisher=Tel-Aviv University, Science and Technology Education Center|accessdate=2008-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the success of ''The Assayer'', Galileo published the ''Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems'' (Dialogo sopra i due massimi sistemi del mondo) in 1632. Despite taking care to adhere to the Inquisition's 1616 instructions, the claims in the book favouring Copernican theory and a non Geocentric model of the solar system led to Galileo being tried and banned on publication. Despite the publication ban, Galileo published his ''[[Two New Sciences|Discourses and Mathematical Demonstrations Relating to Two New Sciences]]'' (''Discorsi e Dimostrazioni Matematiche, intorno a due nuove scienze'') in 1638 in [[House of Elzevir|Holland]], outside the jurisdiction of the Inquisition.

'''George Henry Lewes''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-ca-lewes.ogg|ˈ|l|uː|ɪ|s}}; 18 April 1817 – 30 November 1878) was an English philosopher and critic of literature and theatre. He was also an amateur physiologist. American feminist Margaret Fuller is known to have called Lewes a "witty, French, flippant sort of man".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Brooks |first1=David |title=The Road to Character |date=2015 |publisher=Random House |location=New York, New York |isbn=978-0-8129-8341-8 |page=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became part of the mid-[[Victorian era|Victorian]] ferment of ideas which encouraged discussion of [[Darwinism]], [[positivism]], and [[religious skepticism]]. However, he is perhaps best known today for having openly lived with Mary Ann Evans, who wrote under the [[pen name]] [[George Eliot]], as [[soulmate]]s whose lives and writings were enriched by their relationship, though they never married each other.

==Biography==

Lewes, born in London, was the illegitimate son of the minor poet John Lee Lewes and Elizabeth Ashweek, and the grandson of comic actor [[Charles Lee Lewes]]. His mother married a retired sea captain when he was six. Frequent changes of home meant he was educated in London, [[Jersey]], Brittany, and finally at Dr [[Charles Burney]]'s school in [[Greenwich]]. Having abandoned successively a commercial and a medical career, he seriously thought of becoming an actor and appeared several times on stage between 1841 and 1850. Finally he devoted himself to literature, science and philosophy.

As early as 1836, he belonged to a club formed for the study of philosophy, and had sketched out a physiological treatment of the philosophy of the [[Scottish Common Sense Realism|Scottish school]]. Two years later he went to Germany, probably with the intention of studying philosophy.

Lewes undertook studies on nutrition and physiology; he explored the question whether sugar was injurious to teeth. He conducted experiments on the reflexes and the nervous system of living animals, especially frogs, using ether and chloroform out of consideration for their pain .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=R. E.|date=July 1960|title=George Henry Lewes and His “Physiology of Common Life”, 1859|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of Medicine|volume=53|issue=7|pages=569–574|issn=0035-9157|pmc=1870107|pmid=13832134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He became friends with [[James Henry Leigh Hunt]], and through him he entered London literary society and met [[John Stuart Mill]], [[Thomas Carlyle]] and [[Charles Dickens]].

In 1841, he married Agnes Jervis, daughter of Swynfen Stevens Jervis.

==Relationship with George Eliot==

Lewes met writer Mary Ann Evans, later to be famous as [[George Eliot]], in 1851, and by 1854 they had decided to live together. Lewes and Agnes Jervis had agreed to have an [[open marriage]],&lt;ref&gt;Cross 1965, 'George Eliot's life as related in her letters and journals', AMS Press Inc., NY, p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; and in addition to the three children they had together, Agnes also had four children by [[Thornton Leigh Hunt|Thornton Hunt]], the son of [[Leigh Hunt]]. Since Lewes was named on the birth certificate as the father of one of these children despite knowing this to be false, he was considered complicit in [[adultery]] and was not able to divorce Agnes. In July 1854, Lewes and Evans travelled to [[Weimar]] and [[Berlin]] together for research related to Lewes's study of Goethe. The trip to Germany also served as a honeymoon as Evans and Lewes now considered themselves married, with Evans calling herself Marian Evans Lewes, and referring to Lewes as her husband.

Of his three sons only one, Charles Lewes, survived him; he became a [[London County Council]]lor.

==Lewes and literature==
During the next ten years Lewes supported himself by contributing to quarterly and other reviews, articles discussing a wide range of subjects, often imperfect but revealing acute critical judgment enlightened by philosophic study. The most valuable are those on drama, afterwards republished under the title ''Actors and Acting'' (1875), and ''The Spanish Drama'' (1846). As a youngster, he witnessed a performance by [[Edmund Kean]] which stayed with him as an unforgettable experience.  He also witnessed and wrote of his impressions of performances by [[William Charles Macready]] and other famous stars of the 19th century London stage. He is considered to be the first practitioner of modern theatre criticism and the realistic approach to acting.

In 1845–46, Lewes published ''The Biographical History of Philosophy'', an attempt to depict the life of philosophers as an ever-renewed fruitless labour to attain the unattainable. In 1847–48, he published two novels – ''Ranthorpe'', and ''Rose, Blanche and Violet'' – which, though displaying considerable skill in plot, construction, and characterisation, have taken no permanent place in literature. The same is to be said of an ingenious attempt to rehabilitate ''[[Maximilien Robespierre|Robespierre]]'' (1849). In 1850 he collaborated with [[Thornton Leigh Hunt]] in the foundation of the ''Leader'', of which he was the literary editor. In 1853 he republished under the title of ''Comte's Philosophy of the Sciences'' a series of papers which had appeared in that journal.

The culmination of Lewes's work in prose literature is the ''Life of [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]]'' (1855), probably the best known of his writings. Lewes's versatility, and his combination of scientific with literary tastes, eminently fitted him to appreciate the wide-ranging activity of the German poet. The work became well known in Germany itself, despite the boldness of its criticism and the unpopularity of some of its views (e.g. on the relation of the second to the first part of ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]'').

===Science===
From about 1853 Lewes's writings show that he was occupying himself with scientific and more particularly biological work. He always showed a distinctly scientific bent in his writings, though he had not had technical training. More than popular expositions of accepted scientific truths, they contain able criticisms of conventionally accepted ideas and embody the results of individual research and individual reflection.  He made several suggestions, some of which have since been accepted by [[physiologist]]s, of which the most valuable is that now known as the doctrine of the functional indifference of the nerves – that what were known as the specific energies of the [[optic nerve|optic]], [[cochlear nerve|auditory]] and other nerves are simply differences in their mode of action due to the differences of the peripheral structures or sense-organs with which they are connected. This idea was subsequently proposed independently by [[Wilhelm Max Wundt|Wundt]].&lt;ref&gt;''Physiologische Psychologie'', 2nd ed., p. 321.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philosophy===
{{Criticism of Christianity sidebar}}
In 1865, when ''[[Fortnightly Review]]'' began publication, Lewes became its editor, but he retained the post for less than two years, when he was succeeded by [[John Morley]].

This marks the transition from more strictly scientific to philosophic work. Lewes had been interested in philosophy from early youth; one of his earliest essays was an appreciative account of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]]'s ''[[Lectures on Aesthetics|Aesthetics]]''. Under the influence of the [[positivism]] of [[Auguste Comte]] and [[John Stuart Mill]]'s ''[[A System of Logic]]'', he abandoned all faith in the possibility of [[metaphysics]], and recorded this abandonment in his ''History of Philosophy''. Yet he did not at any time give unqualified assent to Comte's teachings, and with wider reading and reflection his mind moved further away from the [[positivist]] stance. In the preface to the third edition of his ''History of Philosophy'' he avowed a change in this direction, and this movement is even more plainly discernible in subsequent editions of the work.

The final outcome of his intellectual progress is ''The Problems of Life and Mind''. His sudden death cut short the work, yet it is complete enough to allow a judgment on the author's matured conceptions on biological, psychological and metaphysical problems.

The first two volumes on ''The Foundations of a Creed'' laid down Lewes' foundation – a ''rapprochement'' between metaphysics and science. He was still positivist enough to pronounce all inquiry into the ultimate nature of things fruitless: what matter, form, and spirit are in themselves is a futile question that belongs to the sterile region of "metempirics". But philosophical questions may be susceptible to a precise solution through [[scientific method]]. Thus, since the relation of subject to object falls within our experience, it is a proper matter for philosophic investigation.

His treatment of the question of the relation of subject to object confused the scientific truth that mind and body coexist in the living organism and the philosophic truth that all knowledge of objects implies a knowing subject. In [[Shadworth Hodgson]]'s phrase, he mixed up the genesis of mental forms with their nature (see ''Philosophy of Reflexion'', ii. 40–58). Thus he reached a [[monism|monistic]] doctrine that mind and matter are two aspects of the same existence by attending simply to the parallelism between psychical and physical processes as a given fact (or probable fact) of our experience, leaving out of account their relation as subject and object in the cognitive act.

His identification of the two as phases of one existence is open to criticism not only from the point of view of philosophy but from that of science. In his treatment of such ideas as "sensibility", "sentience" and the like, he does not always make it clear whether he is speaking of physical or of psychical phenomena. Among other philosophic questions discussed in these two volumes the nature of casual relation is perhaps the one which is handled with most freshness and suggestiveness.

The third volume, ''The Physical Basis of Mind'', further develops the writer's views on [[Organic life|organic]] activities as a whole. He insists on the radical distinction between organic and inorganic processes and the impossibility of explaining the former by purely mechanical principles. All parts of the nervous system have the same elementary property; sensibility. Thus sensibility belongs as much to the lower centres of the spinal cord as to the brain, the former, more elementary, form contributing to the [[subconscious]] region of mental life, while the higher functions of the nervous system, which make up our conscious mental life, are more complex modifications of this fundamental property of nerve substance.

The nervous organism acts as a whole, particular mental operations cannot be referred to definite regions of the brain, and the [[hypothesis]] of nervous activity by an isolated pathway from one [[nerve cell]] to another is altogether illusory. By insisting on the complete coincidence between the regions of nerve action and sentience, that these are but different aspects of one thing, he was able to attack the doctrine of animal and human [[automaton|automatism]] which affirms that feeling or consciousness is [[Supervenience|merely an incidental concomitant]] of nerve action in no way essential to the chain of physical events.

Lewes's views on [[psychology]], partly explained in the earlier volumes of the ''Problems'', are more fully worked out in the last two (3rd series). He discussed the method of psychology with much insight. Against Comte and his followers he claimed a place for introspection in psychological research. As well as this subjective method there must be an objective one, a reference to nervous conditions and socio-historical data. Biology would help explain mental functions such as feeling and thinking, it would not help us to understand differences of mental faculty in different races and stages of human development. The organic conditions of these differences will probably for ever escape detection, hence they can be explained only as the products of the social environment. The relationship of mental phenomena to social and historical conditions is probably Lewes's most important contribution to psychology.

He also emphasised the complexity of mental phenomena. Every mental state is regarded as compounded of three factors in different proportions –  sensible affection, logical grouping and motor impulse. But Lewes's work in psychology consists less in discoveries than in method. His biological experience prepared him to view mind as a complex unity of which the highest processes are identical with and evolved out of the lower. Thus the operation of thought, or "the logic of signs", is a more complicated form of the elementary operations of sensation and instinct or "the logic of feeling".

The last volume of the ''Problems'' illustrates this position. It is a valuable repository of psychological facts, many of them drawn from obscure regions of mental life and from abnormal experience. To suggest and to stimulate the mind, rather than to supply it with any complete system of knowledge, may be said to be Lewes's service to philosophy. The exceptional rapidity and versatility of his intelligence seems to account at once for the freshness in his way of envisaging the subject matter of philosophy and psychology, and for the want of satisfactory elaboration and of systematic co-ordination.

'''Giorgio Del Vecchio''' (August 26, 1878 – November 28, 1878 – November 28, 1970) was a prominent [[Italy|Italian]] [[legal philosopher]] of the early 20th century. Among others he influenced the theories of [[Norberto Bobbio]]. He is famous for his book ''Justice''.

== Biography ==
Son of Julius Saviour, Giorgio Del Vecchio was professor of philosophy of law at the University of Ferrara (1904), Sassari (1906), Messina (1909), Bologna (1911) and Rome from 1920 to 1953. He became Rector of the University of Rome from 1925 to 1927. He initially adhered to Fascism like many philosophers of law in Italy (though he removed himself from fascist ideology early on). He lost his professorship twice and for opposite reasons: in 1938 at the hands of fascists because he was a Jew and in 1944 at the hands of anti-fascists because he was accused of sympathizing with fascism early on in his career.

Reinstated in teaching during the Second World War, he worked with the ''Century of Italy'' and the magazine ''Free Pages'' (publication directed by Vito Panucci). Along with Nino Tripodi, [[Gioacchino Volpe]], Alberto Asquini, Roberto Cantalupo, Ernesto De Marzio and Emilio Betti, he was part of the organizing committee of INSPE, an Institute of research which in the fifties and sixties was opposed to Marxist culture, promoting international conferences and publications. He was founder and director of the ''International Journal of Philosophy of Law''.

He is considered among the major interpreters of Italian Neo-Kantism. Giorgio Del Vecchio, as did his German colleagues, criticized  philosophical positivism, stating that the concept of law can not be derived from the observation of legal phenomena.

In this regard, his beliefs concurred with a dispute that was taking place in Germany between Philosophy, Sociology and Legal General theory which looked to redefine the "philosophy of law" to which Del Vecchio attributed these three tasks:

* ''logic task'': to construct the concept of law;
* ''phenomenological task'': consisting in the study of law as a social phenomenon;
* ''ontological task'': which examines justice's nature or "the essence of law as it should be."

Del Vecchio's  books are used as reference and text books in many colleges and universities.

[[File:HWLX seals.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The seals at the back of the ''Hewu Longxiang'' qin]]

When the '''[[guqin]]''' is played, the modern name for a plucked seven-string [[China|Chinese]] [[List of traditional Chinese musical instruments|musical instrument]] of the [[zither]] family, a number of '''[[aesthetic]]''' elements are involved. 

==Aesthetics==
The first aesthetic is [[musicality]]. In the second section of "Pingsha Luoyan", for example, the initial few bars contain a ''nao'' [[vibrato]] followed by a phase of sliding up and down the string, even when the sound has already become inaudible {{Audio|PSLY clip.ogg|Listen carefully to the sliding sounds of ''Pingsha Luoyan''}}. The average person trained in music may question whether this is really "[[music]]". Normally, some players would pluck the string very lightly to create a very quiet sound. For some players, this plucking isn't necessary. Instead of trying to force a sound out of the string one should allow the natural sounds emit from the strings. Some players say that the sliding on the string even when the sound has disappeared is a distinctive feature in qin music. It creates a "space" or "void" in a piece, playing without playing, sound without sound. In fact, when the viewer looks at the player sliding on the string without sounds, the viewer automatically "fills in the notes" with their minds. This creates a connection between player, instrument and listener. This, of course, cannot happen when listening to a recording, as one cannot see the performer. It can also be seen as impractical in recording, as the player would want to convey sound as much as possible towards a third audience. But in fact, there is sound, the sound coming from the fingers sliding on the string. With a really good qin, silk strings, and a perfectly quiet environment, all the tones can be sounded. And since the music is more player oriented than listener oriented, and the player knows the music, he/she can hear it even if the sound is not there. And with silk strings the sliding sound might be called the [[qi]] or "life force" of the music. The really empty sounds are the pauses between notes. However, if one cannot create a sound that can be heard when sliding on a string, it is generally acceptable to lightly pluck the string to create a very quiet sound.{{ref|aesthetics}}

In the music of the qin, we often come across (especially in harmonics) the use of the same note to two different strings. A good example of this would be in the main harmonic sections of "Meihua Sannong", where at the last three notes of the first two phrases all play sol (first sol on the sixth string at 7th hui, second on third string at 9th hui, then again on the sixth string at 7th hui) {{Audio|MHSN clip.ogg|Listen carefully to the two/three notes at the end of each phrase of the harmonic section ''Meihua Sannong''}}. The question would be why does one need to play the sol on the third string when one can play sol thrice on the sixth string. One reason is timbre; although both these two positions sound the same note, they sound different or have a different quality to them. Another reason is to add flavor during performance. We have other examples, like the first two phrases of ''Shenren Chang'', where the playing of the harmonics is on the left of the qin on the first phrase, then the same notes are played on the right of the qin. This adds symmetry to the play, and we often see this in many qin melodies where the same notes are mimicked in a different way. 

==Philosophy of the qin==
Qin music tends to linger on certain notes, with an emphasis on silence and timbre, giving it a [[meditation|meditative]] quality. Being an instrument historically associated with [[scholar-bureaucrats|literati]], its aim is [[Confucianism|Confucian]] (in trying to cultivate one's mind) as well as [[Daoist]] (in seeking harmony between man and nature). 「琴棋書畫」 (qin qi shu hua) refers to the [[Four Arts of the Chinese Scholar]], wherein 『琴』 qin/music refers specifically to guqin. [This phrase is a rather late invention of the [[Song Dynasty (960-1279)|Song period]] (according to the ''Wuzhizhai Qinpu''), so it is not clear how essential it was to the pedagogy of earlier scholar classes]. It is rarely used to play popular and fast tunes which are deemed to be vulgar to the instrument of the [[scholars]]. 

Because of this, the qin is not so popular amongst the uninitiated, and because of the decline of its popularity in the periods of political disturbances (when the qin was seen as an [[elitist]] and [[feudal]] instrument. These days, the qin is referred to as a "[[Folk music|folk]] instrument" to move away from these connotations), very few people are familiar with it, even in China. However, there has been a revival of interest in recent years, especially among [[Westerners]], as the qin embodies a [[philosophy]] which appeals to those who wish to escape the [[stress (medicine)|stress]] and confusion of the [[modern world]]. Some may argue that the spiritual side is one of the most appealing aspects of qin music, since much other music concerned with entertainment, social bonding or academic issues, the music of the qin offers a breath of fresh air, concerning with the individual and his/her connection with nature and surroundings. Of course, there is no reason why one cannot submit to a [[Philosophical realism|realist]] and/or [[idealistic]] view of the purpose of the qin music. It all depends on the player's preference of what s/he wants out of qin music. 

There is much comment in qin texts decrying "vulgar" music, but this really only means that there was much of it around. And it is interesting to hear people decry "popular and fast tunes" and then find out their favorite qin melody is ''Flowing Water''. By focusing only on what the scholars have idealized, people can miss a lot of the [[reality]] and [[beauty]] of pure music.{{ref|JT}} 

Some people (particularly the younger generation) find qin music difficult to appreciate upon first listening. The reason for this may be because they rate it against music that they only heard in their life, namely modern or [[popular music]]. Because qin music is very simple and plain ([[minimalist]], some{{Who|date=November 2011}} might say), they may find it boring when compared to the fast beat and sound saturated songs of the modern era. This can lead to a misunderstanding of the true nature of qin music and its aesthetic purposes. Perhaps some people's perceptions of qin music can be summed up in a quote:{{ref|Sachs}}

{{Quotation|[[western culture|Occidental]] listeners have great difficulty in perceiving the delicate shades of ch'in [qin] playing and in appreciating its spirituality. But the average [[Oriental]] cannot appreciate it either. The ch'in does not court popularity, nor does it suit [[Amateur|dilettantism]]. It is the instrument of philosophers and sages. In the privacy of a closed room, alone or before a few selected friends who listen respectfully and silently, the immaterial notes of the ch'in reveal to the listeners the ultimate truths of life and religion.|[[Curt Sachs]]|The History of Musical Instruments}}  

On the other hand, musicians and music lovers can easily appreciate qin music because they can hear music objectively and have a better understanding of music in an ethnomusicological context. 

There has also been a move to a more Western approach to qin music. A handful of professional players{{Who|date=November 2011}} prefer to look at the qin from a purely realist and scientific approach, treating the qin as a purely musical instrument, rather than a cultural phenomenon. This is due to some traditionalists treating the instrument as an 'other-worldly' object than a 'this-worldly' one. 
This move to a much more technical approach signifies a progression in qin study and appreciation; holding on to too much old values tends to impede the transmission of qin.{{Says who|date=November 2011}} An example would be composition. Although around 60-odd new compositions have been composed for the qin since the 1960s, all in all, no one plays them. The reason is that many{{Who|date=November 2011}} believe these new compositions do not compare with ancient scores. But technically, these ancient scores were new at the time when they were composed. Some{{Who|date=November 2011}} fear that in 100 years' time, people then might say that we{{Who|date=November 2011}} have contributed nothing new to qin. That is not to say that the qin cannot be viewed in a traditional way, but to say that the qin is also capable of a progression into new territory. There is no reason why players cannot embrace both traditional and scientific study of the qin.

==Manifestations of qin music==
{{wikisourcelang|zh|谿山琴况|"Xishan Qinkuang" 【谿山琴况】}}

In the past, written in a lot of literature, there is discussion and analysis of what is called ''shengjiang'' 〔聲像〕 or "manifestations of sound" of the qin. These are basically single words used to describe the [[Mood (psychology)|mood]] or [[theme (music)|theme]] of the piece. The number of these 'manifestations' are disputed. Some say only 4, some say 13-16,{{ref|shengjiang}} and some say over 24. Listed in some ''qinpu'' they have very lengthy descriptions of each manifestation, going into every detail. 

The most basic words used to describe qin music are, for example, Yushan school's ''qing'' 『清』, ''wei'' 『微』, ''dan'' 『淡』 and ''yuan'' 『遠』, or "pure", "profound", "light" and "distant". Another important essay on qin manifestations is ''Xishan Qinkuang'' 【谿山琴况】 which lists 24 qin manifestations in great detail.{{ref|qinman}} This essay has several layers; some words describe the playing method, some describe ornamentation and some describe the body of the music. They also explain the union between musician and instrument and how to achieve unity with the music.

'''Herbert Friedman''' (June 21, 1916 – September 9, 2000) was an American pioneer in the application of [[sounding rocket]]s to [[solar physics]], aeronomy, and [[astronomy]]. He was also a statesman and public advocate for science. During his lifetime, he was awarded the [[Eddington Medal]] of the [[Royal Astronomical Society]], the [[National Medal of Science]], the [[Henry Norris Russell Lectureship]] of the [[American Astronomical Society]], the [[William Bowie Medal]] of the [[American Geophysical Union]], the [[Wolf Prize in Physics|Wolf Foundation Prize in Physics]], and the [[Albert A.

==Career==
Friedman was born June 21, 1916 in [[Brooklyn, New York]] (USA) the second of three children of Samuel and Rebecca (née Seligson) Friedman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Biographical Encyclopedia of Astronomers |last=Hockey |first=Thomas |year=2009 |publisher=[[Springer Publishing]] |isbn=978-0-387-31022-0 |accessdate=August 22, 2012 |url=http://www.springerreference.com/docs/html/chapterdbid/58486.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
His father was an [[Orthodox Jew]] who moved to New York City from [[Evansville, Indiana]], and eventually established a successful art framing shop on East Ninth Street in [[Manhattan]]. Friedman’s mother was born in eastern Europe. Friedman grew up as an aspiring artist and earned pocket money as a young man from the sale of his sketches.  He entered [[Brooklyn College]] in 1932 as an art major, but ended up with a degree in physics. He was influenced by his first physics professor, Dr. Bernhard Kurrelmeyer, who eventually helped him get a scholarship to [[Johns Hopkins University|Johns Hopkins]]. Dr. Bernhard Kurrelmeyer's father was Dr. William Kurrelmeyer, department head of the German Department at [[Johns Hopkins University|Johns Hopkins]].

His service to science included membership on the General Advisory Committee to the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] during Lyndon Johnson’s presidency, on [[President's Science Advisory Committee|President Nixon’s Science Advisory Committee]], and on the Space Science and Governing boards of the National Academy of Sciences.

==Death==
Friedman died of cancer at his home in [[Arlington, Virginia]], on 9 September 2000, at the age of eighty four.

{{nihongo|'''Hōun-ji'''|法雲寺}} is a [[Rinzai]] [[Buddhist]] [[temple]] in [[Hyōgo Prefecture]] (formerly [[Harima province]]).

==History==
With the patronage of the [[Akamatsu clan]], [[Sesson Yūbai]] was able to become the founder of a number of provincial [[List of Buddhist temples|Buddhist temple]]-[[Monastery#Buddhist monasteries|monasteries]], including Hōun-ji in Harima.&lt;ref name="hall600-603"&gt;Hall, John Whitney. (1999). [https://books.google.com/books?id=nT9CI5YQF_4C&amp;pg=PA644&amp;dq=  ''The Cambridge History of Japan,'' pp.  600-603.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hōun-ji was ranked among the provincial ''[[jissatsu]]'' by the [[Muromachi shogunate]],&lt;ref name="hall600-603"/&gt; which encouraged its ''shugo'' vassals to found monasteries in their domains.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, [https://books.google.com/books?id=nT9CI5YQF_4C&amp;pg=PA644&amp;dq=sesson+yubai#v=onepage&amp;q=sesson%20yubai&amp;f=false   p. 602.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Prominent among Yūbai's followers were [[Akamatsu Norimura]] (1277-1350) and his son [[Akamatsu Norisuke]] (1314-1371).&lt;ref name="hall600-603"/&gt;

'''''Ikka myōju''''' ({{CJKV|j=一顆明珠}}), known in English as '''''One Bright Jewel''''' or '''''One Bright Pearl''''', is a book of the [[Shōbōgenzō]] by the 13th century [[Sōtō]] [[Zen]] monk [[Eihei Dōgen]]. It was written in the summer of 1238 at Dōgen's monastery [[Kōshōhōrin-ji]] in [[Kyoto]]. The essay marked the beginning of a period of high output of Shōbōgenzō books that lasted until 1246.&lt;ref name=eye1/&gt; The book appears as the seventh book in both the 75 and 60 fascicle versions of the ''[[Shōbōgenzō]]'', and it is ordered fourth in the later chronological 95 fascicle ''Honzan'' editions.&lt;ref name=textual&gt;{{citation|last=Heine|first=Steven|title=Dōgen: Textual and Historical Studies|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2012|page=37|isbn=978-0-19-975447-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The essay is an extended commentary on the famous saying of the [[Tang Dynasty]] monk [[Xuansha Shibei]] that "the ten-direction world is one bright jewel", which in turn references the [[Mani Jewel]] metaphors of earlier Buddhist scriptures.&lt;ref name=eye1/&gt; Dōgen also discusses the "one bright jewel" and related concepts from the Shōbōgenzō essay in two of his formal Dharma Hall Discourses, namely numbers 107 and 445, as well as his Kōan commentaries 23 and 41, all of which are recorded in the [[Eihei Kōroku]].&lt;ref name=koroku&gt;{{citation|last1=Leighton|first1=Taigen Dan|last2=Okumura|first2=Shohaku|title=Dōgen's Extensive Record: A Translation of the Eihei Kōroku|publisher=Wisdom Publications|year=2010|page=588|isbn=978-086171-670-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Mani Jewel==
The title of the essay is often translated into English as ''One Bright Pearl'' instead of ''One Bright Jewel''. [[Shohaku Okumura]], a modern Zen priest and Dōgen scholar, points out that while the character in question (珠) can be used to refer to a pearl, gem, or any kind of jewel, the text clearly uses the term in reference to the "[[Mani Jewel]]" (摩尼珠), a mythical transparent object mentioned in a wide variety of [[Buddhist]] texts. Because pearls are not transparent, and because the transparency is essential for the meaning of the essay, "pearl" is therefore incongruous with the context of the writing. Okumura further argues that a knowledge of the Mani Jewel as it appears in prior texts is essential for understanding the meaning of Dōgen's essay.&lt;ref name=eye1/&gt;

===Early References to the Mani Jewel===
[[image:Goryeo-Kshitigarbha_(Chijang)-late.14c.jpg|right|thumb|[[Ksitigarbha]] holding the [[Cintamani]], or wish-fulfilling Jewel]]
The Mani Jewel makes its first appearance in the [[Pali]] [[Nikāya]]s where it is mentioned as one of the seven treasures owned by a "wheel-turning king". The Mahasudhassana Sutta in the [[Digha Nikaya]] describes the Mani Jewel as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
“It  was  a  beryl,  pure,  excellent,  well-cut 
into  eight  facets,  clear,  bright,  unflawed, 
perfect  in  every  respect. The  luster  of  this 
Jewel-Treasure radiated for an entire yojana 
round about.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Mani Jewel in this text serves as the source of virtue and good governance for the king. Without it he would lose his throne.&lt;ref name=eye1/&gt;

Later texts describe the Mani Jewel differently. One version is the [[Cintamani]] or wish-fulfilling jewel. It was said to be originally owned by the God [[Indra]], but it fell to the earth during a war with the [[Asura]]s, allowing whoever possess it to have their wishes granted. Depictions of the [[Bodhisattva]]s [[Ksitigarbha]] and [[Avalokiteshvara]] sometimes show them holding this Cintamani, indicating their ability to fulfill the wishes of sentient beings.&lt;ref name=eye1/&gt;

The Mani Jewel also appears as a water purifying jewel (清水摩尼) where it could be placed in muddy water by traveling monks, causing any cloudiness to settle out leaving the water clear and pure. This version of the jewel is mentioned in the [[Abhidharma-kosa]] where it is used as a metaphor for faith as an agent capable of dispelling uncertainty.&lt;ref name=eye1/&gt;

Yet another depiction of the jewel is in the metaphor of [[Indra's net]] which appears in the [[Avatamsaka Sutra]]. It describes a net of infinite size with infinite knots, with each knot containing a Mani Jewel with infinite facets. Each individual Mani Jewel reflects every other Mani Jewel in the same way that any individual being or [[phenomenon]] is indistinguishable from the whole or [[noumenon]] due to their fundamental [[Pratītyasamutpāda|interconnectedness]].&lt;ref name=eye1/&gt;

===The Mani Jewel in Buddha Nature Sutras===
The [[Lankavatara Sutra]], the [[Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment]], and the [[Surangama Sutra]] all used the Mani Jewel as metaphors for [[Buddha-nature]]. It was this metaphor in particular that [[Xuansha Shibei]] had in mind for his expression "the ten-direction world is one bright jewel", and is thus the primary focus of Dōgen's essay. In these sutras, a transparent Mani Jewel within us changes colors depending on the conditions around us, representing the [[Skandha|five skandhas]]. The Mani Jewel itself represents each being's Buddha-nature, but because of the [[Three poisons (Buddhism)|three poisons]] of ignorance, attachment, and aversion, a being sees only the various colors emitted by the jewel. These are mistakenly perceived as the defilements rather than the purity of the jewel itself, which is merely reflecting conditions around it. Thus Buddha-nature is not perceived and only the five skandhas are seen, which are then conflated with a sense of self in opposition to the Buddhist idea of [[Anatta|anātman]] or no-self.&lt;ref name=eye1/&gt;

===The Mani Jewel in Zen===
Later, the Mani Jewel began to appear in texts produced by Zen Buddhists. An early example is found in [[Guifeng Zongmi]]'s work ''Chart of the Master-Disciple Succession of the Chan Gate That Transmits the Mind Ground in China'' in which he compares the four contemporary Zen schools: the Northern   School, the Ox Head School, the [[Hongzhou school]] and the [[Heze school]]. He accomplishes this by comparing how each school would interpret the Mani Jewel metaphor used in the Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment discussed above. The text also contains the first use of the specific phrase, "one bright jewel" (一顆明珠). According to Guifeng, the Northern School would believe in a fundamentally pure Mani Jewel that must be cleaned to reveal its purity; the Ox Head school would perceive both the color reflections and the Mani Jewel itself as [[Shunyata|empty]]; the Hongzhou school would say that the blackness covering the Mani Jewel is the Jewel itself, and that its purity can never be seen; the Heze School (to which Guifeng belonged) would interpret the black color covering the jewel as an illusion that is in fact just a manifestation of its brightness such that the surface defilements and the purity of the Jewel interpenetrate one another.&lt;ref name=eye1&gt;{{citation|last=Okumura|first=Shohaku|journal=Dharma Eye|pages=12–20|date=March 2015|number=35|month=|title=The 7th Chapter of Shobogenzo Ikka-myoju (One Bright Jewel): Lecture 1|url=http://global.sotozen-net.or.jp/eng/dharma/pdf/35e.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Karbon''' (formerly '''Karbon14''', '''Kontour''', and '''KIllustrator''') is a [[vector graphics editor]]. It is a component of [[Calligra Suite]], an integrated [[Graphic art software|graphic art]] and [[office suite]] by [[KDE]]. The name is a play on KDE and the radioactive isotope [[Carbon-14]].

On 26 February 2012 the lead developer clarified on the Calligra development [[mailing list]] that the application’s name is simply "Karbon" without "14".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite mailing list | url = https://mail.kde.org/pipermail/calligra-devel/2012-February/004005.html | title = Karbon or Karbon14? | mailinglist = calligra-devel | date = 2012-02-26 | first = Jan | last = H. |quote= So lets make it official and written down what was done in practice anyway: drop the 14 from the name.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==User interface==
===Dockers===
Dockers are Qwidgets that you may attach to the main window or float freely. You may attach them one over another, resulting in tabs.

====Stroke and fill====
Stroke and fill allows you to set the outline or stroke colour, and the fill colour.

=====Fill options=====
* Empty indicated by  an "X" button
* Solid colour
* Gradient
* pattern Warning, patterns are [[Raster graphics|rasters]]. If, using the Pattern Edit Tool, displaying a highly zoomed in area of a pattern may cause it to degrade in quality.
* Even-odd fill
* Winding fill
&lt;!-- ====Layer View====
====Tool options====
====Snap settings====
====Add ahape==== --&gt;

====Tools====
The tools Docker allows you to select which tool you want. Not all tools are always available. Example: the path editing tool is only available when a shape is selected.

====Shape properties====
The use of the Shape Properties docker is Unknown.

===Toolbars===
Toolbars allow you to display option otherwise some where in drop down menus. they mt be edited by left clicking and selecting configure toolbars. The same option is under Settings. You may toggle which toolbars are visible by going to Settings, Shown toolbars and ticking them from there.

==Tools==
&lt;!-- [[File:Kardon tool box.png|thumb|A cropped screenshot of the tool selector in Karbon vector graphics editing software. The Shape Handling is selected; the indented box behind the cursor icon.]] --&gt;

===Shape handling tool===
The Shape Handling tool allows you to select shapes. Once selected you may move, resize, pull, and rotate the shape. To resize a shape move your cursor to one of the corners of the selection box. Two arrows pointing in conflicting directions will appear. Then click and drag to resize the shape. If you want to resized it proportionally, hold down shift when Clicking and dragging. To move a shape around the canvas, click within the selected shapes selection box. Then hold your click and drag. This will move the shape.
&lt;!-- [[File:Karbon's Shape Handling Tool.svg|thumb|Shape Handling Tool icon as vector graphic.]] --&gt;

===Connect shapes tool===
The Connect Shapes tool allows you to visually link shapes with auto updating black lines. This is more geared to flow charts.
&lt;!-- [[File:Karbon's Connet Shapes Tool.svg|thumb|Connet Shapes Tool icon as vector graphic.]] --&gt;

===Create path tool===
The Create Path Tool allows you to draw vector lines and connect then to make shapes with the use of [[Bézier curve]]. If you are coming from using [[Adobe Illustrator]] it may help to think of the Create Path Tool as [[Adobe Illustrator|Illustrato's]] Pen Tool. Karbon's create Path Tool differs from its Freehand Drawing Tool which does not allow you to edit the curves and points while drawing.

'''Kenneth M. Sayre''' is an [[American philosopher]] who spent most of his career at the [[University of Notre Dame]] (ND). His early career was devoted mainly to philosophic applications of [[artificial intelligence]], [[cybernetics]], and [[information theory]]. Later on his main interests shifted to [[Plato]], [[philosophy of mind]], and [[environmental philosophy]]. His retirement in 2014 was marked by publication of a history of ND's Philosophy Department, ''Adventures in Philosophy at Notre Dame''.&lt;ref&gt;''Adventures in Philosophy at Notre Dame'', University of Notre Dame Press, 2014, 382 pages.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biographical overview==
Sayre was born on August 13, 1928, in [[Scottsbluff, Nebraska]].  After graduating from high school in 1946, he spent two years in the [[US Navy]] as an electronics technician.  He received an AB in 1952 from [[Grinnell College]], Iowa, with a joint major in philosophy and mathematics.  [[Harvard University]] granted him an MA in 1954 and a PhD in 1958, both in philosophy.  From 1953 to 1956 he served as Assistant Dean of Harvard's Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.  While completing his thesis, he spent two years as a systems analyst in MIT's [[Lincoln Laboratory]].  He taught at ND from 1958 to 2014, with interim appointments at [[Princeton University]] (1966–67), [[Bowling Green State University]] (1981), [[Oxford University]] (1985), and [[Cambridge University]] (1996).

==Areas of special interest==

===Artificial intelligence===

Under the influence of [[Marvin Minsky]] and [[Oliver Selfridge]] at Lincoln Laboratory, Sayre became the first trained philosopher on record to become actively involved in the new field of artificial intelligence (AI).&lt;ref&gt;See http://www3.nd.edu/~philinst/curriculumvitae.html&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Recognition:  A Study in the Philosophy of Artificial Intelligence'', his first book on the topic, he set forward the working maxim that our “understanding of a type of human behavior and our ability to simulate it go hand in hand.”&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth M. Sayre, ''Recognition:  A Study in the Philosophy of Artificial Intelligence'' (University of Notre Dame Press, 1965), p. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt; A corollary is that a promising way to study natural intelligence is to attempt to reproduce it artificially.

This corollary was behind his establishment of ND's Philosophical Institute for Artificial Intelligence (PIAI) in 1965.  The initial goal of this institute was to build an automated system for recognizing cursive handwriting.  By 1973, the PIAI had produced a handwriting recognition system more successful than any other currently available.&lt;ref&gt;For details, see Kenneth M. Sayre, “Machine Recognition of Handwritten Words:  A Project Report,” in ''Pattern Recognition'', Vol. 5, 1973, pp. 213-28.&lt;/ref&gt; A by-product of this effort was the discovery of a fundamental problem of automated handwriting recognition that came to be known as [[Sayre's paradox]]. Simply stated, the paradox is that a cursively written word cannot be recognized without being [[Text segmentation|segmented]] and cannot be segmented without being recognized. The more promising approaches to automated handwriting recognition today have resulted from attempts to circumvent Sayre's Paradox.&lt;ref&gt;See Alexandro Vinciarelli, “A Survey of Off-line Cursive Word Recognition,” ''Pattern Recognition'', Vol. 35, issue 7 (July 2002), pp. 1433-46.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other studies in AI published by Sayre are ''Consciousness: A Philosophic study of Minds and Machines'' and ''The Modeling of Mind''.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth M. Sayre, ''Consciousness:  A Philosophic Study of Minds and Machines'', Random House, 1969, 273 pages; ''The Modeling of Mind'', Kenneth M. Sayre and Frederick J. Crosson, (eds.), University of Notre Dame Press, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; He also contributed the article “Artificial Intelligence” to the ''Encyclopedia of Religion'', edited by Mircea Eliade.&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopedia of Religion'', Mircea Eliade (editor-in-chief), Macmillan, New York, 1986-87.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cybernetics===

The descriptive title of [[Norbert Wiener]]’s seminal book, ''Cybernetics: or, Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine'', indicates that cybernetics is concerned both with the control of functioning systems and the communication processes involved in that control.&lt;ref&gt;Norbert Wiener, ''Cybernetics:  or, Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine''.  M. I. T. Press, Cambridge, Mass., 1961.&lt;/ref&gt; Also evident from the title is that cybernetics is concerned with functional parallels between biological and mechanical control systems.  Given this overlap of interest between AI and cybernetics, it was natural that Sayre’s early interest in AI led to a parallel interest in cybernetics.

Key concepts in control theory are [[negative feedback|negative]] and [[positive feedback]].&lt;ref&gt;Negative feedback occurs when signals from the output of an operating system are fed back as input to dampen output fluctuation, as in a thermostat regulating an indoor heating system. Positive feedback occurs when effects at the output are fed back in a manner tending to amplify those output effects, as in a fire that becomes increasingly hotter as it burns.&lt;/ref&gt; The concepts of positive and negative feedback are featured in Sayre’s 1976 ''Cybernetics and the Philosophy of Mind''.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth M. Sayre, ''Cybernetics and the Philosophy of Mind'', University of Notre Dame Press, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; Other publications on cybernetics include his co-edited ''Philosophy and Cybernetics'', an encyclopedia article “Cybernetics,” and a chapter by that title in the ''Routledge History of Philosophy''.&lt;ref&gt;''Philosophy and Cybernetics'', Frederick J. Crosson and Kenneth M. Sayre (eds.), University of Notre Dame Press, 1967; “Cybernetics,” in ''The Soviet System and Democratic Society'', Herder and Co., 1971, pp. 1266-1300; ''Philosophy of Science, Logic and Mathematics in the Twentieth Century'', Stuart G. Shanker, ed., Volume IX of the ''Routledge History of Philosophy'', Routledge, London, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Information theory===

The study of communication in cybernetics centers on [[communication theory]], in the technical sense established by [[Claude Shannon]]’s “A Mathematical Theory of Communication.”&lt;ref&gt;Claude E. Shannon, “A Mathematical Theory of Communication,” ''Bell System Technical Journal'', Vol. 27, 1948, pp. 379-423, pp. 623-656.&lt;/ref&gt; This mathematical discipline is more commonly known today as information theory.  Sayre learned information theory from ND's James Massey, winner of the 1988 [[Claude E. Shannon Award]] and an early collaborator in the PIAI handwriting recognition project.

After the handwriting project, information theory continued to figure in Sayre's research. His monograph-length “Intentionality and Information Processing:  An Alternative Model for Cognitive Science” appeared in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth M. Sayre, “Intentionality and Information Processing:  An Alternative Model for Cognitive Science,” ''Behavioral and Brain Sciences'', Vol. 9, no. 1, March 1986, pp. 121-165.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998 he contributed the entry on information theory to the ''Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy''.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth M. Sayre, “Information Theory,” ''Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', Vol. 4, 1998, pp. 782-86.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philosophy of mind===

Early publications by Sayre in this area include “Pattern Recognition Mechanisms and St. Thomas’ Theory of Abstraction,” coauthored with Joseph Bobik in 1963, and “The Cybernetic Approach to the Philosophy of Mind:  A Dialogue” with James Heffernan in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Bobik and Kenneth M. Sayre, “Pattern Recognition Mechanisms and St. Thomas’ Theory of Abstraction,” in ''[[Revue Philosophique de Louvain]]'', Vol 61 (February 1963), pp. 24-43; Kenneth M. Sayre and James Heffernan, The Cybernetic Approach to the Philosophy of Mind:  A Dialogue,” in ''Cognitive and Brain Theory'', Vol. III (Spring 1980), pp. 292-314.&lt;/ref&gt; The most comprehensive presentation of his views in this are in the previously mentioned ''Cybernetics and the Philosophy of Mind'' (1976, reprinted 2014).&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth M. Sayre, ''Cybernetics and the Philosophy of Mind'', University of Notre Dame Press, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;

One widely discussed view in this book is Sayre's version of [[neutral monism]].  As he defines it, neutral monism is the thesis that mind and matter are both reducible to an ontologically more basic “neutral” principle.  The more basic principle in his account is information, in the technical sense of information theory.  Sayre's version has been recognized by several recent authors as one of the more credible forms of neutral monism available to date.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, William Jaworski, ''Philosophy of Mind:  A Comprehensive Introduction'', Wiley-Blackwell, 2011, p. 268; Leopold Stubenberg’s entry on neutral monism in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/neutral-monism/; also the Cyperium blog http://www.sciforums.com/threads/what-is-the-screen-of-the-brain-if-the-brain-is-like-a-computer.134930/.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental philosophy===

Sayre taught numerous seminar and lecture courses in environmental philosophy during the decade prior to his retirement. One of these courses was videotaped in 2007 and made available under ND's OpenCourseWare program.&lt;ref&gt;See https://www.oercommons.org/courses/environmental-philosophy-fall-2007.&lt;/ref&gt; His 2010 book ''Unearthed: The Economic Roots of our Environmental Crisis'' develops the theme that economic production since the Industrial Revolution has degraded the biosphere to a point where it soon will be incapable of supporting human society as we know it, and that radical reductions in consumption are necessary to forestall this result.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth M. Sayre, ''Unearthed:  The Economic Roots of our Environmental Crisis'', University of Notre Dame Press, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plato===

In a period spanning almost 50 years, Sayre has written five books and approximately two dozen shorter works on Plato. In 1987 and 1993 he presented lectures to the Boston Area Colloquium in Ancient Philosophy. He contributed four entries to ''The Continuum Companion to Plato''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Continuum Companion to Plato'', Gerald A. Press (ed.), Continuum International Publishing Group, London, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first book, ''Plato’s Analytic Method'' (1969), shows that the method of hypothesis employed in the ''Theaetetus'' overlaps with the ''Sophist''’s method of collection and division inasmuch as both are procedures for determining necessary and sufficient conditions for a thing's being what it is.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Sayre, ''Plato’s Analytic Method'', Chicago University Press, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;

Standard scholarship holds that the views attributed to Plato by [[Aristotle]] in Book A of the ''Metaphysics'' cannot be found in the [[Platonic dialogues]], and that the reason is either that Aristotle simply did not understand the views in question or that they are part of an unwritten Platonic corpus.&lt;ref&gt;The views notably are that sensible things are constituted of [[theory of forms|Forms]] and the Indefinite Dyad, that Forms are composed of the Indefinite Dyad and Unity, and that Forms are numbers. The Indefinite Dyad also is referred to as the Great and the Small by Aristotle.&lt;/ref&gt; Sayre's second book, ''Plato’s Late Ontology: A Riddle Resolved'' (1983), argues that these views in fact are present in the ''Philebus'' but are expressed in terminology not frequently used by Aristotle.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth M. Sayre, ''Plato’s Late Ontology:  A Riddle Resolved'', Princeton University Press, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

The unifying theme of ''Plato’s Literary Garden'' (1995) is that Plato wrote his dialogues to engage his readers in philosophic conversations similar to those he shared with Socrates.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth M. Sayre, ''Plato’s Literary Garden'', University of Notre Dame Press, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; The book develops this theme with discussions of various early and middle dialogues, including the ''Meno'', the ''Phaedo'', the ''Phaedrus'', the ''Symposium'', and the ''Republic''.

''Parmenides Lesson: Translation and Explication of Plato’s Parmenides'' (1996) contains a line-by-line commentary on Plato's most difficult dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth M. Sayre, ''Parmenides Lesson: Translation and Explanation of Plato’s Parmenides'', University of Notre Dame Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter three-quarters of the dialogue consists of consequences drawn from eight hypotheses about Unity, which commentators traditionally have paired in ways that make them appear contradictory.  This book shows that when the hypothesis are paired in a different but no less plausible way, the consequences not only are compatible but moreover add up to a defense of Plato's later [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] ontology against the [[Eleatic]] Ontology of the middle dialogues.

In ''Metaphysics and Method in Plato’s Statesman'' (2006), the part on metaphysics brings passages from Aristotle's [[Neoplatonic]] commentators to bear in showing that the ontology of the ''Philebus'' is present in the ''Statesman'' as well.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth M. Sayre, ''Metaphysics and Method in Plato’s Statesman'', Cambridge University Press, 2006.  Notable among the Neoplatonic commentators in this regard are [[Alexander of Aphrodisias|Alexander]], [[Themistius]], [[Philoponus]], and [[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicius]].&lt;/ref&gt; The part dealing with method argues that the procedure of collection in the Sophist is superseded by the use of paradigms in the ''Statesman'', and that bipartite division in the ''Sophist'' is replaced by multipartite division in service of a method similar to the method of negation employed in the ''Parmenides''.

The thirty-two '''Kings of Shambhala''' reside in a mythical kingdom. They are part of the Indo-Tibetan [[Vajrayana]] [[Buddhist]] tradition.  

==Legend==
The first notable king, King [[Suchandra]] (sometimes wrongly Sanskritized as "Chandrabhadra," Tib. ''Dawa Sangpo''), is reported to have requested teaching from the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]. In response to this request, it is said the Buddha gave him the first [[Kalachakra]] root [[tantra]].  By practicing the Kalachakra, the whole of Shambhala eventually became an enlightened society. 

King Suchandra was followed by an additional six Dharmarajas (Truth Kings), with his eighth successor, Manjushri Yashas (sometimes wrongly Sanskritized as "[[Manjushrikirti]]"), the first of the 25 ''Kalki'' Kings (Tib. ''Rigden'', wylie: ''rigs ldan'').

==The Seven Dharmarajas==
The Seven Dharmarajas (Tib. ''Chogyal'') are:
#Suchandra (Tib. ''Dawa Sangpo'') c. 900 to 876 BC. Note: the Kalachakra calculations put the life of Shakyamuni Buddha quite a bit earlier than what is generally accepted, and the Tibetans produced a number of divergent calculations of the dates listed here.  Many of the named kings are often wrongly Sanskritized (i.e., back-translated from the Tibetan) in Western publications.
#Devendra (Tib. ''Lhayi Wang'') (876-776 BC) - Fond of Sentient Beings
#Tejasvin (Tib. ''Ziji Chän'') (776-676 BC) Bearer of the Dharma Wheel and the Auspicious Conch
#Somadatta (Tib. ''Dawä Jin'')  (676-576) Lord of Speakers
#Shevardnadze/Surshvara (Tib. ''Lhaji Wangchug'')  (576-476) Destroyer of the City of Delusion 
#Krishnamurti (Tib. ''Natshog Zug'')  (476-376) Conqueror of False Leaders, Holding a Lotus
#Susquehanna (Tib. ''Lhayi Wangdän'') (376-276) Cutter of Delusion, Uprooter of Karma and Klesha

==The Twenty-Five Kalki==
The most recent 25 of the 32 Kings of [[Shambhala]] are known as ''[[Kalki]]'' kings (Tib. ''Rigden'', wylie: ''rigs ldan''), meaning "Holder of the Castes."  The Kalki King is said to reside upon a "Lion Throne" in Kalapa, the capital city of the Kingdom. The Kalki are holders of the [[Kalachakra]] (Wheel of Time), which are the teachings of Buddha Shakyamuni passed down from the original seven Dharmarajas of Shambhala.

[[File:´Jam-dbyangs grags King of Shambhala.jpg|thumb|Jamyang Drag (´jam dbyangs grags)]]

As explained by Buddhist scholar John R. Newman, the Kalki are often erroneously termed "Kulika" by Tibetan Buddhist scholars unfamiliar with the original Sanskrit texts:

&lt;blockquote&gt; ".. . so far no one seems to have examined the Sanskrit Kalachakra texts.  The Buddhist myth of the Kalkis of Shambhala derives from the Hindu Kalki of Shambhala myths contained in the ''[[Mahabharata]]'' and the [[Puranas]]. The ''[[Vimalaprabha]]'' even refers to the ''[[Kalki Purana]]'', probably the latest of the [[upapurana]]s. This relationship has been obscured by western scholars who have reconstructed the Tibetan translation term ''rigs ldan'' as "Kulika." Although Tibetan rigs ldan is used to translate the Sanskrit ''kulika'' in other contexts, here it always represents Sanskrit ''kalkin'' (possessive of ''kalkah''; I have used the nominative kalki)."&lt;ref&gt;Newman, John L. "A Brief History of the Kalachakra," ''Wheel of Time: The Kalachakra in Context''. Snow Lion: 1985. {{ISBN|1559390018}}, pg 84&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Kalki===
#Yashas (Tib. ''Jampal Dakpa''; "Manjushri Yashas") King [[Yashas]] is said to have lived in the second century BCE. He formatted the Kalachakra teachings into a condensed and simplified structure termed the "Sri Kalachakra" or "Laghutantra." He also converted a group of non-Buddhist Brahman priests of Shambhala to Buddhism and gave them the Kalachakra initiation, thereby uniting all inhabitants into one "vajra caste," or family of tantric practitioners. Yashas is said to have predicted the coming of "Barbarian Dharma" after 800 years (about 600 CE), which indicates a form of [[Islam]].
#Pundarika (Tib. ''Pema Karpo'') (176-76 BCE) White Lotus, cherished by the Lord of Potala. King Pundarika wrote a commentary called "Vimalaprabha" (Skt.) or "Stainless Light." This text, together with the Sri Kalachakra, is the source text of the Kalachakra system as it is now practiced. Other practice texts are commentaries on these two. The [[Dalai Lamas]] are said to be incarnations of Pundarika.
#Bhadra (Tib. ''Zangpo'') (76 BC -227 CE) One who Rules by the Thousand-spoked Wheel.
#Vijaya (Tib. ''Nampar Gyäl'') (227-327) Attractor of Wealth, Victorious in War.
#Sumitra (Tib. ''Shenyen Zangpo'') (327-427) Integrator of Method and Wisdom, Victorious over Samsara.
#Raktapani (Tib. ''Rinchen Chag'') (427-527) Holder of the Blissful Vajra and Bell.
#Vishnugupta (Tib. ''Kyabjug Bäpa'') (527-627) Smiling Holder of the Trident and Rosary.
#Suryakirti (Tib. ''Nyima Drag'') (627-727) Annihilator of Wild Demons.
#Subhadra (Tib. ''Shintu Zangpo'') (727-827) Holder of the Sword and Shield.
#Samudra Vijaya (Tib. ''Gyatso Namgyäl'') (827-927) Annihilator of all types of Devils.
#Aja (Tib. ''Gyälka'') (927-1027) Who binds with Unbreakable Iron Chains.
#Surya/Suryapada, (Tib. ''(Wonang) Nyima'') (1027-1127) All-Pervading, Radiant Jewel Light.
#Vishvarupa (Tib. ''Natshog Zug(chän)'') (1127-1227) Holder of the Vajra Prod and Noose.
#Shashiprabha (Also '''Sasiprabha''' or '''Chandraprabha''', Tib. ''Dawäi Ö'') (1227-1327) Lord of Secret Mantras, Holder of the Wheel and Conch.
#Ananta,''' Thayä''' (Tib. ''Nyen'') (1327-1427) Holder of the Mallet that Crushes False Ideas.
#Shripaala or '''Parthiva''' (Tib. ''Sakyong'') (1427-1527) Holder of the Cleaver that Cuts the Bonds of Ignorance.
#Shripala (Tib. ''Pälkyong'') (1527-1627) Annihilator of the Host of Demons. 
#Singha (Tib. ''Senge'') (1627 -1727) Who Stuns the Elephant with his Vajra.
#Vikranta (Tib. ''Nampar Nön'') (1727 - 1827) Subduer of the Mass of Foes, the Inner and Outer Classes of Devils.
#Mahabala  (Tib. ''Tobpo Che'') (1827 - 1927) Tamer of all False Leaders by Means of the Sound of Mantra.
#Aniruddha (Tib. ''Magakpa'') (1927-2027) Who Draws and Binds the Entire Three Worlds. Aniruddha, the present Kalki king, was prophesied to rule during a time when Vajrayana Buddhism and the Kalachakra are nearly extinguished. 
#Narasingha (Tib. ''Miyi Senge'') (2027-2127) Ruling by the Wheel, Holding the Conch.
#Maheshvara (Tib. ''Wangchug Che'') (2127-2227) Victorious over the Armies of Demons.
#Anantavijaya (Tib. ''Thaye Namgyäl'') (2227-2327) Holder of the vajra and Bell.
#Raudra Chakrin (Tib. ''Dakpo Khorlocen'') (2327 to ? ) Forceful Wheel Holder. The final king prophesied in the Kalachakra, Raudra Chakrin is further prophesied to appear to all humanity in 2424, and to establish a planet-wide Golden Age subsequent to his defeat of degenerate world rulers.

==Dalai Lama==
The [[Dalai Lama|Dalai Lamas]] are said to be incarnations of the second Kalki, Pundarika. In particular, the Second, Seventh and Fourteenth (present) Dalai Lamas are said to have strong affinity to the Kalki kings, with the present Dalai Lama having to date offered the Kalachakra initiation thirty times. 

==The Lineage of Sakyong Kings==
Followers of the contemporary Tibetan Buddhist teachers [[Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche]] and his son [[Sakyong Mipham Rinpoche]] believe them to be intimately connected to the Kalki kings, and thus dedicated to propagating the wisdom of Shambhala to the world. The term "Sakyong" in Tibetan literally means "earth-protector," although it is colloquially understood to mean "King." The Sakyong King lineage is traditionally familial.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

'''''Light on Yoga: Yoga Dipika''''' (Sanskrit: योग दीपिका "Yoga Dipika") is a 1966 book on the [[Iyengar Yoga]] style of [[hatha yoga]] by [[B. K. S. Iyengar]]. It describes more than 200 yoga postures or [[asana]]s, and is illustrated with some 600 monochrome photographs of Iyengar demonstrating these.

The book has been described as the bible of modern yoga.&lt;ref name="Goldberg 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name=PublishersWeekly/&gt; It has been translated into at least 17 languages and has sold over three million copies.

==Context==
{{further|Yoga|Hatha yoga}}

[[B. K. S. Iyengar]] (1918-2014) was born in a poor family of [[Brahmin]]s in [[Karnataka]], India. In childhood he suffered from diseases including typhoid, malaria and tuberculosis, and became extremely stiff. At the age of 18 he decided to spend his life doing [[yoga]], and by 1938 he was already performing the asanas fluently. The violinist [[Yehudi Menuhin]] became his pupil in 1952 and then invited Iyengar to teach in Europe, which he did from the 1960s.&lt;ref name="IYI"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Chaplin |first1=Penny |last2=Blondel |first2=Nathalie |title=B.K.S.

==Book==

===Publication===

''Light on Yoga'' was first published by [[George Allen and Unwin]] in 1966, with a foreword by his pupil, the violinist [[Yehudi Menuhin]]. Revised editions were brought out in 1968 and 1976. A paperback edition was published by The Aquarian Press in 1991 under the Thorsons imprint. The book became an international best-seller; it has been translated into at least 23 languages including Chinese, Czech, and Russian,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Light on Yoga Iyengar |url=http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=Light+on+Yoga+Iyengar&amp;fq=&amp;dblist=638&amp;fc=ln:_25&amp;qt=show_more_ln%3A&amp;cookie |publisher=WorldCat |accessdate=20 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has sold over three million copies.&lt;ref name=Stukin2005&gt;{{cite news | last=Stukin | first=Stacie | title=Yogis gather around the guru | newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=10 October 2005 | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/oct/10/health/he-iyengar10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contents===
{{see|List of asanas}}

The book has three parts, a technical introduction to [[yoga]], in which [[hatha yoga]] is explained to be one component; a detailed illustrated description of the [[asana]]s (some 200 postures, illustrated by some 600 monochrome photographs of Iyengar); and an account of pranayama, yoga breathing.  An appendix defines a set of asana courses, i.e. which postures to do each week, building up in difficulty, in courses structured to last up to 300 weeks. A second appendix defines the asanas supposed to be "curative" for a range of diseases and conditions from "Acidity" to "Varicose Veins". The book has a glossary of all the [[Sanskrit]] terms employed.

===Approach===
[[File:Uttitha Trikonasana.jpg|thumb|[[Utthita Trikonasana]], the extended triangle pose, an innovation&lt;ref name="Goldberg 2014"/&gt; basic to [[Iyengar Yoga]]]]

Each asana is named in Sanskrit with its [[etymology]], graded, and described separately with two or more pages of text and monochrome photographs of Iyengar. For example, [[Utthita Trikonasana]], the extended triangle pose, is stated to be at grade 3 out of a possible 60 in terms of difficulty. The technique for going into the triangle pose, performing it, and returning from it, is described in eight steps. The technique is written as a set of instructions, such as "Inhale deeply and with a jump spread apart the legs sideways 3 to 3½ feet". Its claimed effects on the muscles and body are described in a concluding paragraph. The three photographs show Iyengar in a preparatory pose and then in the triangle pose itself from front and rear.&lt;ref name="Iyengar 1991"&gt;{{cite book | last=Iyengar | first=B. K. S. | authorlink=B. K. S. Iyengar | title=Light on Yoga | publisher=Thorsons | publication-place=London | year=1991 |origyear=1966 | isbn=978-0-00-714516-4 | oclc=51315708 | pages=63-64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

''Light on Yoga'' has become known as the "bible" of yoga;&lt;ref name="Goldberg 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name=PublishersWeekly/&gt; ''Publisher's Weekly'' wrote that it "set the standard" for books about yoga, with instructions and illustrations of the poses.&lt;ref name=PublishersWeekly&gt;{{cite web |title=Light on Life&lt;!--yes, it mentions Light on Yoga also--&gt;: The Yoga Journey to Wholeness, Inner Peace, and Ultimate Freedom |url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-59486-248-9 |publisher=Publisher's Weekly |accessdate=20 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Yehudi Menuhin, in his foreword to the book, wrote that "Whoever has had the privilege of receiving Mr Iyengar's attention, or of witnessing the precision, refinement and beauty of his art, is introduced to that vision of perfection and innocence which is man as first created — unarmed, unashamed, son of God, lord of creation — in the Garden of Eden".&lt;ref&gt;Iyengar, 1991. p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Michelle Goldberg, in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', states that the book "remains unparallelled as a guide to asana practice", and quotes ''Yoga Journal'' as saying "when 'teachers refer to the correct way to do a posture, they're usually alluding to the alignment Mr. Iyengar instructs and expertly models in his book.'" She notes that while Iyengar attributes the asanas to [[Patanjali]]'s ''[[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali|Yoga Sutras]]'', he was being "too modest. It was he, not any ancient sage, who figured out how to show people the world over the safest way to stand on their heads." For example, she explains, the triangle pose and the [[sun salutation]] "don't appear in any ancient yogic text" but were put together into a method by Iyengar's brother-in-law and first teacher, Krishnamacharya.&lt;ref name="Goldberg 2014"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Goldberg |first1=Michelle |title=Iyengar and the Invention of Yoga |url=https://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/iyengar-invention-yoga |publisher=[[The New Yorker]] |accessdate=20 November 2018 |date=23 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Derek Beres, writing in ''[[Big Think]]'', called the book "wildly popular" and "essentially the bible for yoga practitioners." He describes some of the science that Iyengar claims for yoga as suspect: "Iyengar had a habit of calling things proven even though no actual scientific research had been conducted."&lt;ref name="Beres 2014"/&gt; Beres tried Iyengar yoga alongside the "more aerobic Vinyasa" style, and "always appreciated &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Iyengar yoga]]'s&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; anatomical focus and the emphasis on breath before anything else."&lt;ref name="Beres 2014"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Beres |first1=Derek |title=B.K.S. Iyengar |url=https://bigthink.com/21st-century-spirituality/strength-through-adversity-remembering-bks-iyengar |website=Big Think |accessdate=20 November 2018 |date=20 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The yoga teacher Bernie Gourley notes the book's strengths, the asanas "with his perfect alignment", but also that the book does not "systematically address contraindications" to each asana, nor does it provide evidence for the claimed benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gourley |first1=Bernie |title=Book Review: Light on Yoga by BKS Iyengar |url=https://berniegourley.com/2014/06/01/book-review-light-on-yoga-by-bks-iyengar/ |website=The !n(tro)verted yogi |accessdate=20 November 2018 |date=1 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Light on Yoga'' project by the yoga teacher Jack Cuneo and the photographer Rick Cummings has attempted to photograph all the yoga poses in the book, to be followed by restating all the instructions in Cuneo's own words.&lt;ref name="Cuneo"&gt;{{cite web |title=Welcome to the Light On Yoga Project! |url=http://www.jackcuneo.com/loyp-gallery/ |publisher=Jack Cuneo Yoga |accessdate=20 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mahmoud Khatami''' (Persian: محمود خاتمی) is an Iranian [[philosopher]].   He is best known for developing "[[Ontetic Philosophy]]".

== Life==
Mahmoud Khatami grew up in [[Tehran]]. Showing an early interest in humanities, he attended the Seminary of Islamic Studies, which gained him the traditional degree of ''[[Ijtihad]]'',  {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} the highest level in Islamic religious and theological learning. Concurrently, he attended the [[University of Tehran]] to pursue his secular education for BA, MA and MS, and finally a PhD in philosophy. Afterwards,  he continued his further education in [[England]], where he was awarded his second PhD and post- doc in the field of Philosophical Psychology.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Returning to Iran, he was appointed to the  Department of Philosophy at [[University of Tehran]] in 1997 where he is now a Professor of Contemporary Philosophy. In 2002, he was appointed as Fellow of Iran's Academy of the Arts. In the meantime, Khatami has been invited, and  visiting professor at Iranian as well as Western universities {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}, and has been rewarded and awarded for his academic excellence both inside and outside Iran.

==Plagiarism Charge==
 
In November 2014, some reports were published that charged Mahmoud Khatami with extensive plagiarism.&lt;ref&gt;http://dailynous.com/2014/11/05/a-case-of-extensive-plagiarism-guest-post/&lt;/ref&gt; Some philosophy researchers followed up on this claim and compared his papers with the others' ones and published the results, which confirmed the claim, on their blogs.&lt;ref&gt;http://kaavelajevardi.blogspot.ca/2014/11/blog-post_8.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://pofsut1.blogspot.de/2014/11/blog-post_8.html&lt;/ref&gt; The Organon F, international journal of analytic philosophy, has officially announced that "The paper entitled 'The Epistemological Quest: From the Possibility of Experience to the Possibility of Communication' (Organon F, 10, 2003, No. 4, 357–379) published under the name of Mahmoud Khatami was withdrawn from our web page. It turned out that the paper was almost a verbatim copy of another work which appeared as a book chapter written by someone else".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.klemens.sav.sk/fiusav/organon/?q=en/content/epistemological-quest-possibility-experience-possibility-communication&lt;/ref&gt; On December 1, 2014, the University of Tehran has issued a statement on the plagiarism allegations against Mahmoud Khatami declaring that "should charges be proved, the university would punish the wrongdoer severely, and refer the case to the proper authorities. However, if the allegations are proved wrong, the University, as always, has the obligation to defend its faculty members".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=10 December 2014 |url=http://ut.ac.ir/fa/news/1/bodyView/962/%D8%A8%DB%8C%D8%A7%D9%86%DB%8C%D9%87.%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%B4%DA%AF%D8%A7%D9%87.%D8%AA%D9%87%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86.%D8%AF%D8%B1%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%87.%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%AA%D8%B4%D8%A7%D8%B1.%D8%B4%D8%A7%DB%8C%D8%B9%D8%A7%D8%AA%DB%8C.%D9%85%D8%A8%D9%86%DB%8C.%D8%A8%D8%B1.%D8%B9%D8%AF%D9%85.%D8%B1%D8%B9%D8%A7%DB%8C%D8%AA.%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%AA.%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%B1%DB%8C.%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%85%DB%8C.%D8%A7%D8%B2.%D8%B3%D9%88%DB%8C.%DB%8C%DA%A9%DB%8C.%D8%A7%D8%B2.%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%B6%D8%A7%DB%8C.%D9%87%DB%8C%D8%A3%D8%AA.%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%85%DB%8C.html |script-title=بیانیه دانشگاه تهران درباره انتشار شایعاتی مبنی بر عدم رعایت امانت داری علمی از سوی یکی از اعضای هیأت علمی |title=Statement by University of Tehran on the publication of a rumor that a faculty member fails to observe scholarly trust &lt;!-- via Google Translate; improve if you can --&gt; |publisher=University of Tehran |accessdate=2014-12-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141202041542/http://ut.ac.ir/fa/news/1/bodyView/962/%D8%A8%DB%8C%D8%A7%D9%86%DB%8C%D9%87.%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%B4%DA%AF%D8%A7%D9%87.%D8%AA%D9%87%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86.%D8%AF%D8%B1%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%87.%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%AA%D8%B4%D8%A7%D8%B1.%D8%B4%D8%A7%DB%8C%D8%B9%D8%A7%D8%AA%DB%8C.%D9%85%D8%A8%D9%86%DB%8C.%D8%A8%D8%B1.%D8%B9%D8%AF%D9%85.%D8%B1%D8%B9%D8%A7%DB%8C%D8%AA.%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%AA.%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%B1%DB%8C.%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%85%DB%8C.%D8%A7%D8%B2.%D8%B3%D9%88%DB%8C.%DB%8C%DA%A9%DB%8C.%D8%A7%D8%B2.%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%B6%D8%A7%DB%8C.%D9%87%DB%8C%D8%A3%D8%AA.%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%85%DB%8C.html |archivedate=2014-12-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://dailynous.com/2014/12/03/university-of-tehran-statement-on-khatami/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical influences and development==
Trained in [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] as well as classical Islamic philosophy, and profoundly affected by the philosophies of [[Shahab al-Din Suhrawardi|Suhrawardi]] and [[Mulla Sadra]], and encouraged by philosophy of [[Martin Heidegger]], Khatami developed a distinctive approach that rejects [[subjectivism]] and [[relativism]], abjures any simple notion of interpretive method, and focuses on the study of the nature of being.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

His work is concentrated in the development of what Khatami terms "ontetic philosophy", encompassing [[cognitive]] and [[conative]] aspects of being. Khatami's main concern is humanity and human being. His works provide a specific interpretation of humanity, the self and consciousness, and an understanding of the idea of subjectivity. Khatami argues for the efficiency of action as primordial constituent of human being.His philosophy provides an account of the proper ground for human subjectivity while rejecting modern subjectivism. This is not a rejection of  modern concerns, but an insistence on the limit of modern understanding.He  has also worked intensively on morality and religion as well as the theory and application of art. Khatami's thinking began and remained connected with the Persian thought. The "Persian" character of Khatami's approach is evident, not merely in the central theoretical role he gives to the concept of philosophy in his thinking, but also in his own personal commitment to intellectual engagement and exchange. Indeed, he is one of the few philosophers for whom the "Persian" has become a significant category to "supply" a positive output of modern philosophy. His early engagement with this tradition determined much of the character and direction of his thinking.

=== Ontetic philosophy ===
Coined by Khatami himself, the term "ontetic" does not merely mean "[[ontological]]" or "existential" in the western sense; in addition to these, this term also means "fuzzy" and "hierarchic". It indicates the order of Being and its purity. Consequently, the ontetic philosophy is the intellectual articulation of human approach toward a complete grasp of the order of Being. "ontetic" in his terminology refers to the old understanding Persian conception of light which simultaneously indicates being, consciousness, life and action. this conception constituted on  a graded logic which is called in hiss terminology the logic of "Tashkik". All the way, this conception and logic is fundamental for human being and his relations. Being contemplated by philosophy is expressed by man himself, and therefore man's relations with the world, as also with Him, become central for the sphere of philosophy. Man is an acting subject, a free agent, capable of choosing between various ends compatible with the circumstances of his life, and insofar he is responsible for those relations; and, on the other hand, he has an end appointed him by nature which is obligatory upon him as his moral end. A philosophical knowledge of the world, then, must entail a philosophical knowledge or thorough explanation of the reasons of man's duties flowing from his relation to things and to Him.

Furthermore, man has the power of reflecting on his own knowledge; as is seen from the fact that the understanding of what knowledge is, is distinct from knowledge, that the study of the logical structure of science is distinct from the knowledge he acquires of real things. Hence do we arrive at the more comprehensive definition, that philosophy is the full understanding of the order of Being, and in its shadow, of man's situation in it, and of his moral duties and responsibilities resulting from it, and of his knowledge of reality.

Khatami's concept of philosophy requires man to be central for the philosophical discussion, and he is faithful to this requirement. However, he enters to the philosophy scene from the "modernity door." Influenced by Heidegger, Khatami radically understands modernity as a subjectivistic process in which a very specific concept of man has developed. He writes: "Heidegger who questioned the subjectivistic foundation of modern concept of man and the world called for an original thinking to determine what and how man is." Khatami tries to respond to his quest. Not dealing with Heidegger's answer, but not disregarding it, Khatami suggests an otherwise notion of Man and Subjectivity by stepping back toward Persian illuminative thought within which he tries to glimpse a hint of a human subject which is the source of the world, and even created and in this respect he is nothing without [[God]], yet he is eternal, absolute, prior to the world, master of the world, and all the things are manifested from his light.

Khatami's reference to this perspective provides "an interesting frame, and a spur to look for patterns that other accounts of the material treated in modern time were likely to miss".  In this matter, Khatami offers a hermeneutic reading of the conception of Man in the Persian illuminative philosophy. Khatami innovatively inquires about the potential philosophical possibilities by virtue of which this philosophy would assist the current debates that attempt to overcome the influences of modern subjectivism on the conception of Man, of his self and of his subjectivity. To reach this goal, Khatami has reconstructed a method tacitly employed by Mulla Sadra in his doctrine of the illuminative [[existentialism]].

This reconstruction happens to Khatami in the light of Persian Illuminative Philosophy and his hermeneutic assessment of phenomenology. Khatami's chief aim of this reconstruction was to present a transcendent notion of fuzzy reduction that is crucial for his discussion of his ontetic model.  Herein, his hermeneutic reading of Sadra's philosophy is set within a broader consideration of the course of development of theories of subjectivity as manifested in the works of [[Descartes]], [[David Hume|Hume]], [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], and Husserl.  In this context, he reaches the conclusion that the modern conception of subjectivity, that has no corresponding field of experience, or of empirically based qualities, does not amount to being more than a vacuous concept.

Against this, Khatami shows how he is able to overcome this conception in the name of an ontetic subjectivity gained by stepping back to the Persian traditional philosophy. There are two crucial elements to Khatami's appropriation of Persian philosophy: first, the focus on cognition, and the connection of cognition with Being; second, the focus on Being itself as the event of prior and partial disclosure in which we are already involved and that can never be made completely transparent. Both of these elements are connected with Khatami's response to the subjectivist element in modern thought. By turning back to the direct experience, and to the concept of Being as prior and partial disclosure, Khatami was able to develop an alternative to subjectivism that also connected with the ideas taken from [[Shahab al-Din Suhrawardi|Suhravardi]], and Mulla Sadra, and of the hermeneutical ontology of Heidegger.

Just as the human being is taken as central and determining in the experience of Being, so is cognition similarly determined by the matter to be recognized; as the experience of Being reveals, not in spite of, but precisely because of the way it also conceals, so cognition is possible, not in spite of, but precisely because of its prior involvement. In Khatami's theory, the concept of "presence" has an important role here. Khatami takes presence as the basic clue to Being, emphasizing the way in which presence something that has its own order and structure to which man is given over. Presence has obvious affinities with all of the other concepts at issue in his ontetic philosophy. Indeed, one can take it as providing slightly different elaboration of what is essentially the same basic conception of mind that takes our finitude, that is, our prior involvement and partiality, not as a barrier to human "being", but rather as its enabling condition. It is this conception that is worked out in detail in Sadraean Meditations.

One might react to Khatami's emphasis on our "ontetic presence" involvement, that such involvement cannot but remain subjectivistic simply on the grounds that it is always determined to experience things in certain ways rather than others. Such an objection can be seen as a simple reiteration of the basic tendency towards subjectivism that Khatami rejects, but Khatami also takes issue directly with this view, and the negative connotations often associated with the notion, arguing that, rather than closing us off, our presence is what open us up to what is to be recognized.

In ''Sadraean Meditations'' and in ''From a Sadraean Point of View'', Khatami redeploys the notion of our presence as it is worked out in more particular fashion than in Sadra's ''Asfar''.  Khatami's positive conception of presence can be seen as connected with a number of different ideas in his philosophy. The way in which our presence opens us up to matter at issue in such a way that our presence capable of being revised exhibits the character of this concept, and its role in human life. The ontetic priority Khatami assigns to presence is also tied to Khatami's emphasis on the priority of the question in the structure of human being. Moreover, the indispensable role of presence in human being connects directly with Khatami's rethinking of the practical life. All human being are necessarily oriented to present concerns and interests, and it is those present concerns and interests that allow us to enter into the communication with the world. The presence character of man means that, he is involved in a connection that encompasses both his own self-realization and his cognition of the environment. Our self-realization and cognition always occurs against the background of this prior presence.

On this basis, Khatami thus advances a view of subjectivity that rejects the idea of subjectivity as achieved through modern philosophy that indicates gaining access to some inner realm of subjective meaning. For him, subjectivity is an ongoing process, rather than something that is ever completed, so he also rejects the idea that there is any final determinacy to human subjectivity.

== Ontetic model of subjectivity ==

Briefly, Khatami is seeking for a model of subjectivity capable of meeting modern requirements, and convening the privileges of modern subjectivism, but has more to say about man and its spiritual nature. Regarding this goal, one may organize his endeavour in three steps; first he tries to reevaluate modern subjectivism and ventures to amend it by interpreting the legionnaires of modernity; second, he tries to construe the classic Persian conception of man as an ontetic absolute subject who can be reformulated in modern terms; third, he tries to show a [[rhezomatic]] turn in the depth of modern subjectivism toward a neutral spirituality and divinity.

=== Step one: Rethinking the Transcendental Subjectivity ===

Supporting [[Heidegger]], Khatami says that [[modernity]] is philosophically characterized by [[subjectivism]] whose history began with [[Descartes]]. Historically speaking, the modern sense of man formulated later by [[Kant's Copernican Revolution]], according to which man become an autonomous agent of knowledge and action. Kant's pluralistic approach to the problem of subject and object relation led him to presuppose a transcendental characteristic for human subjectivity. Khatami considers Kant's "subjectivistic turn" to analyze this characteristic in order to go beyond its formal sense and revise either aspects of subjectivity. While he regards Hegel's early critique of Kant's transcendental reflection as a significant step in surpassing the formal approach to the [[transcendental subjectivity]], he nevertheless continues to deformalize the transcendental and consider it as "latent". The latent, in Khatami's view, is what I am because I am essentially memory, full of my past; this plenitude is not, however, specified into images, but determines the meaning of my being in the present. Khatami argues that, by attributing the transcendental as latent to memory, we seem to make it empirical. Nevertheless, Khatami retains an ontological meaning for memory—meaning for which memory is not only the recollection of my own history or the résumé of my own experience, but also the very possibility of experience: the transcendental as latent. Consequently, he infers, when the transcendental is considered in its activity with respect to the object, we must say that it is implicitly known, and in its relation with the subject, it is this implicit knowledge, the latent, itself. This knowledge, according to the formal reality, is the structure of subject. This structure has an activity: it guarantees for the subject a profound being both universal and singular, and it promotes intersubjectivity – understood as the communication of the similar subjects.

=== Step two: Human Subjectivity as Absolute ===
Following the first step, Khatami tries to reformulate the human subject as absolute. He reconsiders here the illuminative tradition of [[Persian thought]] a notion of man who is both more than the world and less than the world. As for the former, man, descending from God, is a comprehensive totality as macrocosm within which and through which the world is created; while as for the latter, he, ascending to God, is a singular individual as microcosm shattered and fallen down to the earth, but still has the same colour of the divine essence within him. Khatami highlights the former aspect of this notion which is the source of the latter, and, at the same time, sheds light on the "concealed" essence of human being which is "forgotten" in modern subjectivism. This notion of man constitutes his essence as the integration of the divine inward as well as outward names. Thus, the illuminative man is homocosm of the divine and the worldly realities. He was created as God's vicegerent while the entire world is a particularization of what exists in him. The world was thus created through man and for man, even though in the visible world man appeared the last. The illuminative man, in this capacity, can like Him create by uttering the command "be", is keen on exhibiting his ability to control nature, and above all an absolute subject who comprehends all creation and, by means of that comprehension, comes to dominate over the world and name that which it comprehends. He is Absolute in the sense of  God's vicegerent: The only Created Creator.

=== Step three: Subjectivity and Technology ===

The ontetic model of subjectivity offered by Khatami led him to a very crucial point in the modern world: technology.  Khatami tries to support this idea that an ontetic subject is still alive behind the technological veil of the modern world.

In sum, Khatami's ontetic model suggests that we can discern not only a shadow of the ontetic subject in today's technological world but also a figure of the technological subject already in more traditional metaphysics.

'''Miguel Abensour''' ({{IPA-fr|abɑ̃suʁ|lang}}; 13 February 1939 – 22 April 2017) was a French philosopher specializing in political philosophy. He was emeritus professor of [[political philosophy]] at the [[Paris Diderot University]] ([[Jussieu Campus|Jussieu]]) and a former president of the [[Collège international de philosophie]].

== Research and works ==
Abensour has written for the revues ''Textures'', ''Libre'', and ''Tumultes''. Director of the collection ''Critique de la politique'' (published by Payot &amp; Rivages) since 1974, he was notable in contributing to the reception of the [[Frankfurt School]] in France.&lt;ref name=0:&gt;[[Robert Maggiori]], [http://www.liberation.fr/livres/0101573423-l-utopie-de-miguel-abensour « L’utopie de Miguel Abensour »] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628210456/http://www.liberation.fr/livres/0101573423-l-utopie-de-miguel-abensour |date=2011-06-28 }}, ''Libération'', 11 juin 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In his works and numerous articles, he has sought to reconcile [[democracy]], understood as "democracy against the state", with the idea of [[utopia]], conceived from [[Emmanuel Levinas]]'s criticism of [[Martin Buber]]'s idea of interpersonal relations: the [[I and Thou]] relationship opposed to the I and It.&lt;ref name=0:/&gt;

He has also published numerous articles on [[Emmanuel Levinas]], [[Claude Lefort]], [[Louis Antoine de Saint-Just|Saint-Just]], [[utopian socialism]] ([[Pierre Leroux]], [[William Morris]]), [[Louis Auguste Blanqui|Blanqui]], and members of the [[Frankfurt School]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://catalogue.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/cb11887982p/PUBLIC Voir ouvrages liés à la notice d'autorité du philosophe] sur le site de la [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]].&lt;/ref&gt;

An anthology and critique of his works was published in 2006 by [[Sens &amp; Tonka]], ''Critique de la politique. Autour de Miguel Abensour'', edited by Anne Kupiec and Étienne Tassin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001460/146025fo.pdf ''Critique de la politique.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7026">The '''numerus clausus''' is a concept of [[property law]] which limits the number of types of right that the courts will acknowledge as having the character of "[[property]]". Several consequences follow from a right having the nature of property, as opposed to being a personal right, like a contract or obligation to pay compensation. Historically, the law has given privileged remedies to the holders of property rights over personal claims. These have included priority in payment from an insolvent debtor, a greater likelihood of being awarded [[specific performance]], and security in remaining in possession of land or some other asset against termination of the right to possess. It holds especial importance in [[land law]] and [[corporate law]].&lt;ref&gt;A Kellner "[http://www.grin.com/e-book/25439/a-description-of-the-system-of-estates-in-england-and-germany-in-the-18th A Description of the System of Estates in England and Germany in the 18th Century on the Basis of German Travel Reports]" {{ISBN|978-3-638-28068-6}}; J.M.

==History==
The numerus clausus principle has its roots in [[Roman law]].&lt;ref&gt;F Parisi "[http://www.law.gmu.edu/assets/files/publications/working_papers/05-38.pdf THE FALL AND RISE OF FUNCTIONAL PROPERTY]" George Mason Law &amp; Economics Research Paper No. 05-38 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==
{{main|English land law|English property law}}
In the [[United Kingdom]], and particularly in the jurisprudence of the English courts, it is well established that individuals cannot freely create new categories of property right themselves: it has to be recognised by courts. This was held to be true in the 19th century in ''[[Keppell v Bailey]]''&lt;ref&gt;(1834) 2 My &amp; K 517, 535–6&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Hill v Tupper]]''&lt;ref&gt;(1863) 2 H &amp; C 121&lt;/ref&gt; as a matter of public policy. In the 20th century, in ''[[National Provincial Bank Ltd v Ainsworth]]''&lt;ref&gt;[1965] AC 1175&lt;/ref&gt; with a more open approach, [[Lord Wilberforce]] stated that

{{Cquote|Before a right or an interest can be admitted into the category of property, or of a right affecting property, it must be definable, identifiable by third parties, capable in its nature of assumption by third parties, and have some degree of permanence or stability.}}

A widely held view is that a ''numerus clausus'', or a property right limit, serves to protect wealth in the scope where it already exists, and does not need extension.&lt;ref&gt;S Gardner, ''An Introduction to Land Law'' (2009) 11–12&lt;/ref&gt; This tends to be contested on the basis acknowledgement of property rights simply masks a privilege for people who have enough [[bargaining power]] to exercise the [[freedom of contract]] for the various privileges that property rights confer, such as priority in insolvency, security of tenure, a right to trace or follow an asset, and a greater likelihood of specific performance as a remedy.

Under English law today, there are fourteen property rights in the ''numerus clausus'', as follows.&lt;ref&gt;S Gardner, ''An Introduction to Land Law'' (2009) 9–13&lt;/ref&gt;

*(1) [[Freehold (law)|freehold]] ownership
*(2) [[easement]]s, for the benefit of another piece of land, right to use land in a certain way, e.g. right of way
*(3) [[restrictive covenant]]s, for the benefit of another piece of land, a restriction on the owner’s use, e.g. to not build
*(4) [[lease]]s, exclusive possession for a defined period of time
*(5) [[mortgage]]s, a security to take possession of land if an obligation is unfilfilled
*(6) rights under [[trust (law)|trust]]s, entitling beneficiaries to something
*(7) [[license coupled with an interest|licenses coupled with an interest]], allowing someone to enter to gain access to assets
*(8) [[profit a prendre]], rights allowing one person to enter and take things like coal, timber or game
*(9) [[rentcharge]]s, since the [[Rentcharges Act 1977]] only in exiguous circumstances, a right to own land in return for periodical payments to someone else
*(10) [[right of entry|rights of entry]], especially found with leases and rentcharges if rent is not paid
*(11) [[estate contract]]s, rights arising where parties intend to create or purport to create some other right but have not yet done so
*(12) [[Option contract|options]] and pre-emption rights, i.e. to demand a right under specified conditions
*(13) ‘[[mere equity|mere equities]]’, rights to rescind a transaction if it is vitiated by mispresentation, undue influence and so on, under the [[Land Registration Act 2002]] ss 115–116(b)
*(14) home rights, i.e. to occupy a home by virtue of a family relationship under the [[Family Law Act 1996]] s 30

Before the [[Law of Property Act 1925]], the [[life estate]] and the [[entail]] would have also counted as property rights, but they were abolished except as beneficial interests under a trust.

==Germany==
In German law, the ''numerus clausus'' principle has a constitutional foundation&lt;ref&gt;A Peukert "Güterzuordnung als Rechtsprinzip" (Mohr Siebeck, 2008) {{ISBN|978-3-16-149724-7}}; &lt;br /&gt;V. Jänich "Geistiges Eigentum – Eine Komplementärerscheinung zum Sacheigentum?" (Mohr Siebeck, 2002) {{ISBN|978-3-16-147647-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and limits property rights in their number (Typenzwang) and content (Typenfixierung).

Other European states show equal doctrines.&lt;ref&gt;B.

==Theory==
There are competing views about the desirability of having a limited ''numerus clausus'' of property rights, as well as what counts as having a proprietary quality.&lt;ref&gt;TW Merrill, HE Smith "[http://www.yalelawjournal.org/pdf/110-1/NEW%20MERRILL.pdf Optimal standardization in the law of property: the ''numerus clausus'' principle]" Yale Law Journal, 10/2000; H Hansmann, R Kraakman "[http://lsr.nellco.org/harvard/olin/papers/388/ Property, contract, and verification: the ''Numerus Clausus'' problem and the divisibility of rights]" The Journal of Legal Studies, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ove von Spaeth''' (''Christian Ove Wilhelm von Spaeth'', born February 23, 1938) is a Danish writer, graphic designer and [[independent scholar]].

Ove Von Spaeth studied graphic design at The Graphic Arts Institute of Denmark and in the decades following the 1960s became known for his psychedelic poster designs, publications and articles relating to Indian music, art, and spirituality.

In the 1970s, von Spaeth began studying ancient history, religions, and astronomy. His analysis of earliest known star map in Egypt - the [[Astronomical ceiling of Senemut Tomb|‘Senmut star-map’]] &lt;ref&gt;Novakovic, Bojan. Senenmut: An Ancient Egyptian Astronomer. http://publications.aob.rs/85/pdf/019-023.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; lead to von Spaeth publishing an exact dating of its time and period in Egyptian history and of the reign of Queen Hatshepsut.&lt;ref name="starmap"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Von Spaeth
|first1=Ove
|year=2000
|title=Dating the Oldest Egyptian Star Map
|journal=Centaurus |volume=42 |issue=3 |pages=159–179|publisher=Wiley |doi=10.1034/j.1600-0498.2000.420301.x |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1034/j.1600-0498.2000.420301.x/abstract |accessdate=2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dating the Oldest Egyptian Star Map (2000)==
By using astronomical approach on the Senmut map, von Spaeth computed and verified the presence of distinctive planetary conjunctions represented as a factual occurrence in the sky. This allowed the calculation of an exact dating of its time and thus the period in Egyptian history.&lt;ref name="starmap" /&gt;

==Books by Ove von Spaeth==

===Images of Cities (1966)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Images of Cities |last=von Spaeth |first=Ove |origyear=1966 |year=1969 |publisher=Strubes Publishers |location=Copenhagen}}&lt;/ref&gt;===

The book is an experiment in visual effects of images from cities around the world. Von Spaeth tries to enhanced the emotional experience of urban environments by using long exposures and typographic compositions containing multiple levels of printed text

===Psychedelic ’67 (1967 &amp; 1969)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Psychedelic ’67 |last=von Spaeth |first=Ove |year=1967|publisher=Strubes Publishers |location=Copenhagen }}&lt;/ref&gt;===

Von Spaeth's typographic experimental book tried to capture a slice of contemporary history as it was unfolding in Denmark. The book’s psychedelic subject is formulated through the author’s artistic layout and visual arrangement.

===The Moses book Series===
The series of five books on the biblical figure [[Moses]], is a semi fictional work based on ancient textual sources such as the Rabbinical Writings’, archaeological evidence, and astronomical data. Von Spaeth attempts to develop a historical alternative view of Moses Egyptian background.&lt;ref&gt;

In the first book of a series, von Spaeth suggests that [[Moses]] was an Egyptian prince and heir to the throne who found himself disinherited and forced into exile as a result of complex plots and intrigues at the royal court of Pharaohs Hatshepsut and Thutmosis III (approx. 1500 BC).&lt;ref&gt;

The second book suggests that Moses was born to Queen Hatshepsut 3500 years ago, rose to power as a high-ranking leader among the Egyptian elite, was ousted in a coup, along with his mother, and records of his existence were systematically erased. Von Speath devots a significant portion of the book to draw parallels between Moses and Queen Hatshepsut’s chief consul Senmut.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Panth Maharaj''' (3 March 1855 – 1905), born '''Dattopant Balekundrikar''', was a [[Hindu]] spiritual master who is regarded by his devotees as a saint and lived in the [[Belgavi]] region of [[India]].  

==Background==
Panth Maharaj was born in a [[Deshastha Brahmin]] family to Ramachandra Panth and Sitabai on the March 9th, 1855 in [[Belgaum]] which coincided with the auspicious Hindu holiday of [[Krishna Janmashtami]].&lt;ref name="aboutbelgaum"&gt;{{ cite web |url=https://allaboutbelgaum.com/lifestyle/panchamukhi-sadguru-shri-pant-maharaj-balekundrikar/ |title=Panchamukhi Sadguru Shri Pant Maharaj Balekundrikar |date=2018-10-27 |accessdate=2018-11-16 |website=All About Belgaum}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is considered to be great Hindu saint who founded a philosophy in which Nav Narayan of Avadhoot Sampradaya are attributed to Dattatreya.&lt;ref&gt;http://pantmaharaj.com/Biography.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
The main temple dedicated to Panth Maharaj is located in the village of [[Balekundri_(B.K.)|Balekundari]] on the outskirts of [[Belgavi]].  The temple houses the wooden shoes, or [[paduka]]s, worn by him.  Behind the temple is an [[Ficus_racemosa|Indian fig tree]] marking the spot where he was cremated and an eternal flame that has been kept burning from his funeral pyre.&lt;ref name="aboutbelgaum"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5841">In philosophy, testimony includes any words or utterances that are presented as evidence for the claims they express. This definition may be distinguished from the legal notion of testimony in that the speaker does not have to make a declaration of the truth of the facts.

The role of [[testimony]] in acquiring belief and knowledge has been a relatively neglected philosophical issue. [[CAJ (Tony) Coady]]&lt;sup&gt;[[#Notes|1]]&lt;/sup&gt; believes that this is because traditional [[epistemology]] has had a distinctly [[Individualism|individualist]] flavour.

However, it seems that many of the beliefs that we hold have been gained through accepting testimony. For example, one may only know that [[Kent]] is a county of [[England]] or that [[David Beckham]] earns $30 million per year because one has learned these things from other people. A more striking example is the belief about one's own birthdate. If you know your birthdate, the evidence for your belief was almost certainly received through testimony.

One of the problems with acquiring knowledge through testimony is that it does not seem to live up to the standards of knowledge (see [[Knowledge#Knowledge in philosophy and the problem of justification|knowledge in philosophy]] ). As Owens notes&lt;sup&gt;[[#Notes|2]]&lt;/sup&gt;, it does not seem to live up to the [[The Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideal of rationality captured in the motto of the [[Royal Society]] – ‘Nullius in verba (no man's word)’. Crudely put, the question is: 'How can testimony give us knowledge when we have no reasons of our own?'

Coady suggests that there are two approaches to this problem:
*'''Reductivism''', which seeks to ‘reduce’ or re-describe our behaviour such that it is not at odds with the traditional view of knowledge
and
*'''Anti-reductivism''', which seeks to fit our behaviour in with a different concept of knowledge. For example, we may compare it to an account of how [[perception]] gives us knowledge or how [[memory]] gives us knowledge directly.

[[David Hume|Hume]] is one of the few early philosophers to offer anything like a sustained account of testimony, this can be found in his ''‘An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding’'' in the section on miracles. The basic idea is that our [[Theory of justification|justification]] for believing what people tell us comes from our experience of the ‘...constant and regular conjunction’&lt;sup&gt;[[#Notes|3]]&lt;/sup&gt; between the state of affairs as people describe it and the actual state of affairs (i.e. our observation that they match). On Coady's schema he is a reductivist.

Coady offers an anti-reductivist account of testimony. He claims that testimony is like perception, we don't have to have reasons for believing it, only an absence of reasons not to believe it. On Coady's account we are justified in being credulous. Proponents of anti-reductivism in the history of philosophy include [[Augustine of Hippo]] and [[Thomas Reid]].

Perhaps also significant is that [[Bertrand Russell]] argued that [[knowledge by acquaintance]] played an important part in epistemology.

'''Plotinus''' ({{IPAc-en|p|l|ɒ|ˈ|t|aɪ|n|ə|s}}; {{lang-grc-gre|Πλωτῖνος}}, ''Plōtinos''; {{circa|204/5}}&amp;nbsp;– 270) was a major Greek-speaking [[philosophy|philosopher]] of the ancient world. In his philosophy, described in the ''[[Enneads]]'', there are three principles: [[Henology|the One]], [[Nous|the Intellect]], and the [[wikt:psyche#English|Soul]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who was Plotinus?|url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/philosopherszone/stories/2011/3237626.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; His teacher was [[Ammonius Saccas]] and he is of the Platonic tradition.&lt;ref name="Stanford1"&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/plotinus/ ''Plotinus''].&lt;/ref&gt;  Historians of the 19th century invented the term [[Neoplatonism]]&lt;ref name="Stanford1" /&gt; and applied it to him and his philosophy which was influential in [[Late Antiquity]]. Much of the biographical information about Plotinus comes from [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]]'s preface to his edition of Plotinus' ''[[Enneads]]''. His [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] writings have inspired centuries of [[Paganism|Pagan]], [[Early Islamic philosophy|Islamic]], [[Jewish philosophy|Jewish]], [[Christian philosophy|Christian]],  and [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] [[metaphysics|metaphysicians]] and [[mysticism|mystics]].

== Biography ==
[[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] reported that Plotinus was 66 years old when he died in 270, the second year of the reign of the emperor [[Claudius II]], thus giving us the year of his teacher's birth as around 205. [[Eunapius]] reported that Plotinus was born in the [[Lycopolis (Delta)|Deltaic Lycopolis]] in [[Egypt (Roman province)|Egypt]], which has led to speculations that he may have been a native Egyptian of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]],&lt;ref&gt;"Plotinus." The Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition. [[Columbia University Press]], 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ancient Greece|Greek]],&lt;ref&gt;"Plotinus." The Concise Oxford Companion to Classical Literature. Oxford University Press, 1993, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Hellenization|Hellenized]] [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]]&lt;ref&gt;Bilolo, M.: ''La notion de « l’Un » dans les Ennéades de Plotin et dans les Hymnes thébains. Contribution à l’étude des sources égyptiennes du néo-platonisme.'' In: D. Kessler, R. Schulz (Eds.), "Gedenkschrift für Winfried Barta ''ḥtp dj n ḥzj''" (Münchner Ägyptologische Untersuchungen, Bd. 4), Frankfurt; Berlin; Bern; New York; Paris; Wien: Peter Lang, 1995, pp. 67–91.&lt;/ref&gt; descent.

Plotinus had an inherent distrust of materiality (an attitude common to [[Platonism]]), holding to the view that phenomena were a poor image or mimicry ([[mimesis]]) of something "higher and intelligible" (VI.I) which was the "truer part of genuine Being". This distrust extended to the body, including his own; it is reported by Porphyry that at one point he refused to have his portrait painted, presumably for much the same reasons of dislike. Likewise Plotinus never discussed his ancestry, childhood, or his place or date of birth. From all accounts his personal and social life exhibited the highest moral and spiritual standards.

Plotinus took up the study of [[philosophy]] at the age of twenty-seven, around the year 232, and travelled to [[Alexandria]] to study. There he was dissatisfied with every teacher he encountered until an acquaintance suggested he listen to the ideas of [[Ammonius Saccas]]. Upon hearing Ammonius lecture, he declared to his friend, "this was the man I was looking for," and began to study intently under his new instructor. Besides Ammonius, Plotinus was also influenced by the works of [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]], [[Numenius of Apamea|Numenius]], and various [[Stoicism|Stoics]].

=== Expedition to Persia and return to Rome ===
After spending the next eleven years in Alexandria, he then decided, at the age of around 38, to investigate the philosophical teachings of the [[Iranian philosophy|Persian philosophers]] and the [[Indian philosophy|Indian philosophers]].&lt;ref&gt;Porphyry, ''On the Life of Plotinus and the Order of His Books'', Ch. 3 (in Armstrong's Loeb translation, "he became eager to make acquaintance with the Persian philosophical discipline and that prevailing among the Indians").&lt;/ref&gt; In the pursuit of this endeavor he left Alexandria and joined the army of [[Gordian III]] as it marched on Persia. However, [[Battle of Misiche|the campaign]] was a failure, and on Gordian's eventual death Plotinus found himself abandoned in a hostile land, and only with difficulty found his way back to safety in [[Antioch]].

At the age of forty, during the reign of [[Philip the Arab]], he came to [[Rome]], where he stayed for most of the remainder of his life. There he attracted a number of students. His innermost circle included [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]], [[Amelius|Amelius Gentilianus]] of [[Tuscany]], the Senator [[Castricius Firmus]], and [[Eustochius of Alexandria]], a doctor who devoted himself to learning from Plotinus and attending to him until his death.  Other students included: [[Zethos the Arab|Zethos]], an [[Arab]] by ancestry who died before Plotinus, leaving him a legacy and some land; [[Disciples of Plotinus|Zoticus]], a critic and poet; [[Paulinus (follower of Plotinus)|Paulinus]], a doctor of [[Beit She'an|Scythopolis]]; and [[Serapion (follower of Plotinus)|Serapion]] from Alexandria. He had students amongst the [[Roman Senate]] beside Castricius, such as [[Marcellus Orontius]], [[Sabinillus]], and [[Rogantianus]]. Women were also numbered amongst his students, including Gemina, in whose house he lived during his residence in Rome, and her daughter, also Gemina; and Amphiclea, the wife of Ariston the son of [[Iamblichus]].&lt;ref&gt;Porphyry, ''Vita Plotini'', 9. See also Emma C. Clarke, [[John M. Dillon]], and Jackson P. Hershbell (1999), ''Iamblichus on The Mysteries'', page xix. SBL. who say that "to gain some credible chronology, one assumes that Ariston married Amphicleia some time after Plotinus's death"&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Plotinus was a correspondent of the philosopher [[Cassius Dionysius Longinus|Cassius Longinus]].

=== Later life ===
While in Rome Plotinus also gained the respect of the Emperor [[Gallienus]] and his wife [[Cornelia Salonina|Salonina]]. At one point Plotinus attempted to interest Gallienus in rebuilding an abandoned settlement in [[Campania]], known as the 'City of Philosophers', where the inhabitants would live under the constitution set out in [[Plato]]'s ''Laws''. An Imperial subsidy was never granted, for reasons unknown to Porphyry, who reports the incident.

Porphyry subsequently went to live in [[Sicily]], where word reached him that his former teacher had died. The philosopher spent his final days in seclusion on an estate in [[Campania]] which his friend Zethos had bequeathed him. According to the account of Eustochius, who attended him at the end, Plotinus' final words were: "Try to raise the divine in yourselves to the divine in the all."&lt;ref&gt;Mark Edwards, ''Neoplatonic Saints: The Lives of Plotinus and Proclus by Their Students'', Liverpool University Press, 2000, p. 4 n. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Eustochius records that a snake crept under the bed where Plotinus lay, and slipped away through a hole in the wall; at the same moment the philosopher died.

Plotinus wrote the essays that became the ''[[Enneads]]'' over a period of several years from ''[[Circa|ca.]]'' 253 until a few months before his death seventeen years later. Porphyry makes note that the ''Enneads'', before being compiled and arranged by himself, were merely the enormous collection of notes and essays which Plotinus used in his lectures and debates, rather than a formal book. Plotinus was unable to revise his own work due to his poor eyesight, yet his writings required extensive editing, according to Porphyry: his master's handwriting was atrocious, he did not properly separate his words, and he cared little for niceties of spelling. Plotinus intensely disliked the editorial process, and turned the task to Porphyry, who not only polished them but put them into the arrangement we now have.

== Major ideas ==

=== One ===
{{See also|Substance theory}}
Plotinus taught that there is a supreme, totally transcendent "[[Henology|One]]", containing no division, multiplicity, or distinction; beyond all categories of [[being]] and non-being. His "One" "cannot be any existing thing", nor is it merely the sum of all things (compare the [[Stoicism|Stoic]] doctrine of disbelief in non-material existence), but "is prior to all existents". Plotinus identified his "One" with the concept of 'Good' and the principle of 'Beauty'. (I.6.9)

His "One" concept encompassed thinker and object. Even the self-contemplating intelligence (the [[noesis]] of the [[nous]]) must contain [[Dualistic cosmology|duality]]. "Once you have uttered 'The Good,' add no further thought: by any addition, and in proportion to that addition, you introduce a deficiency." (III.8.11) Plotinus denies [[sentience]], self-awareness or any other action (''ergon'') to the One (τὸ Ἕν, ''to En''; V.6.6). Rather, if we insist on describing it further, we must call the One a sheer potentiality (''[[Dunamis|dynamis]]'') or  without which nothing could exist. (III.8.10) As Plotinus explains in both places and elsewhere (e.g. V.6.3), it is impossible for the One to be Being or a self-aware Creator God. At (V.6.4), Plotinus compared the One to "light", the Divine Intellect/[[Nous]] (Νοῦς, ''Nous''; first will towards Good) to the "Sun", and lastly the Soul (Ψυχή, ''[[Psyche (psychology)|Psyche]]'') to the "Moon" whose light is merely a "derivative conglomeration of light from the 'Sun'". The first light could exist without any celestial body.

The One, being beyond all attributes including being and non-being, is the source of the world—but not through any act of creation, willful or otherwise, since activity cannot be ascribed to the unchangeable, immutable One. Plotinus argues instead that the multiple cannot exist without the simple. The "less perfect" must, of necessity, "emanate", or issue forth, from the "perfect" or "more perfect". Thus, all of "creation" emanates from the One in succeeding stages of lesser and lesser perfection. These stages are not temporally isolated, but occur throughout time as a constant process.

The One is not just an intellectual concept but something that can be experienced, an experience where one goes beyond all multiplicity.&lt;ref&gt;Stace, W. T. (1960) ''The Teachings of the Mystics'', New York, Signet, pp. 110–123&lt;/ref&gt; Plotinus writes, "We ought not even to say that he will ''see'', but he will ''be'' that which he sees, if indeed it is possible any longer to distinguish between seer and seen, and not boldly to affirm that the two are one."&lt;ref&gt;Stace, W. T. (1960) ''The Teachings of the Mystics'', New York, Signet, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Emanation by the One ===
Superficially considered, Plotinus seems to offer an alternative to the orthodox [[Christianity|Christian]] notion of creation ''[[ex nihilo]]'' (out of nothing), although Plotinus never mentions Christianity in any of his works. The metaphysics of emanation (ἀπορροή ''aporrhoe'' (ΙΙ.3.2) or ἀπόρροια ''aporrhoia'' (II.3.11)), however, just like the metaphysics of Creation, confirms the absolute transcendence of the One or of the Divine, as the source of the Being of all things that yet remains transcendent of them in its own nature; the One is in no way affected or diminished by these emanations, just as the Christian God in no way is affected by some sort of exterior "nothingness". Plotinus, using a venerable analogy that would become crucial for the (largely Neoplatonic) metaphysics of developed Christian thought, likens the One to the [[Sun]] which emanates light indiscriminately without thereby diminishing itself, or reflection in a mirror which in no way diminishes or otherwise alters the object being reflected.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

The first emanation is ''[[Nous]]'' (Divine Mind, ''[[Logos]]'', Order, Thought, Reason), identified metaphorically with the [[Demiurge]] in Plato's ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]''. It is the first [[will (philosophy)|Will]] toward Good. From ''Nous'' proceeds the [[Anima mundi (spirit)|World Soul]], which Plotinus subdivides into upper and lower, identifying the lower aspect of Soul with [[nature]]. From the world soul proceeds individual [[human]] souls, and finally, matter, at the lowest level of [[chain of being|being]] and thus the least [[perfection|perfected]] level of the cosmos. Despite this relatively pedestrian assessment of the material world, Plotinus asserted the ultimately divine nature of material creation since it ultimately derives from the One, through the mediums of ''Nous'' and the world soul. It is by the Good or through beauty that we recognize the One, in material things and then in the [[substantial form|Forms]]. (I.6.6 and I.6.9)

The essentially devotional nature of Plotinus' philosophy may be further illustrated by his concept of attaining ecstatic union with the One (''[[henosis]]''). Porphyry relates that Plotinus attained such a union four times during the years he knew him. This may be related to [[enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]], liberation, and other concepts of [[mysticism|mystical union]] common to many Eastern and Western traditions.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

}}
Authentic human happiness for Plotinus consists of the true human identifying with that which is the best in the universe. Because happiness is beyond anything physical, Plotinus stresses the point that worldly fortune does not control true human happiness, and thus “… there exists no single human being that does not either potentially or effectively possess this thing we hold to constitute happiness.” (Enneads I.4.4) The issue of happiness is one of Plotinus’ greatest imprints on Western thought, as he is one of the first to introduce the idea that [[eudaimonia]] (happiness) is attainable only within consciousness.

The true human is an incorporeal contemplative capacity of the soul, and superior to all things corporeal. It then follows that real human happiness is independent of the physical world. Real happiness is, instead, dependent on the metaphysical and authentic human being found in this highest capacity of Reason. “For man, and especially the Proficient, is not the Couplement of Soul and body: the proof is that man can be disengaged from the body and disdain its nominal goods.” (Enneads I.4.14) The human who has achieved happiness will not be bothered by sickness, discomfort, etc., as his focus is on the greatest things. Authentic human happiness is the utilization of the most authentically human capacity of contemplation. Even in daily, physical action, the flourishing human’s “…Act is determined by the higher phase of the Soul.” (Enneads III.4.6) Even in the most dramatic arguments Plotinus considers (if the Proficient is subject to extreme physical torture, for example), he concludes this only strengthens his claim of true happiness being metaphysical, as the truly happy human being would understand that which is being tortured is merely a body, not the conscious self, and happiness could persist.

Plotinus offers a comprehensive description of his conception of a person who has achieved [[eudaimonia]]. “The perfect life” involves a man who commands reason and contemplation. (Enneads I.4.4) A happy person will not sway between happy and sad, as many of Plotinus' contemporaries believed. Stoics, for example, question the ability of someone to be happy (presupposing happiness is contemplation) if they are mentally incapacitated or even asleep. Plotinus disregards this claim, as the soul and true human do not sleep or even exist in time, nor will a living human who has achieved eudaimonia suddenly stop using its greatest, most authentic capacity just because of the body’s discomfort in the physical realm. “…The Proficient’s will is set always and only inward.” (Enneads I.4.11)

Overall, happiness for Plotinus is "...a flight from this world's ways and things." (Theaet. 176) and a focus on the highest, i.e. Forms and the One.

===Henosis===
{{main|Henosis}}

Henosis is the word for mystical "oneness", "union", or "unity" in classical Greek. In [[Platonism]], and especially [[Neoplatonism]], the goal of henosis is union with what is fundamental in reality: the One ([[wikt:εἷς|Τὸ Ἕν]]), the Source, or [[Monism|Monad]].&lt;ref&gt;Stamatellos, Giannis.

As is specified in the writings of Plotinus on [[henology]],{{refn|group=note|Plotinus:&lt;br&gt;* "Our thought cannot grasp the One as long as any other image remains active in the soul. To this end, you must set free your soul from all outward things and turn wholly within yourself, with no more leaning to what lies outside, and lay your mind bare of ideal forms, as before of the objects of sense, and forget even yourself, and so come within sight of that One." (6.9.7)&lt;br&gt;* "If he remembers who he became when he merged with the One, he will bear its image in himself.

(6.9.11.)}} one can reach a state of [[tabula rasa]], a blank state where the individual may grasp or merge with The One.{{refn|group=note|Plotinus: &lt;br&gt;* "Our thought cannot grasp the One as long as any other image remains active in the soul.

Here within the ''Enneads'' of Plotinus the Monad can be referred to as the Good above the demiurge.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;''[[Neoplatonism and Gnosticism]]'' by Richard T.

All division is reconciled in the one, the final stage before reaching singularity, called duality (dyad), is completely reconciled in the Monad, Source or One (see [[monism]]). As the one, source or substance of all things the Monad is all encompassing. As infinite and indeterminate all is reconciled in the dunamis or one. It is the demiurge or second emanation that is the nous in Plotinus. It is the demiurge (creator, action, energy) or nous that "perceives" and therefore causes the force (potential or One) to manifest as energy, or the [[Dyad (Greek philosophy)|dyad]] called the material world. Nous as being, being and perception (intellect) manifest what is called soul ([[Gaia hypothesis|World Soul]]).&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;

Henosis for Plotinus was defined in his works as a reversing of the ontological process of consciousness via [[meditation]] (in the Western mind to un[[Contemplation|contemplate]]) toward no thought ([[Nous]] or [[demiurge]]) and no division ([[Dyad (symbol)|dyad]]) within the individual (being). Plotinus words his teachings to reconcile not only Plato with [[Aristotle]] but also various World religions that he had personal contact with during his various travels. Plotinus' works have an [[ascetic]] character in that they reject matter as an illusion (non-existent). Matter was strictly treated as [[immanent]], with matter as essential to its being, having no true or [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendential]] character or essence, substance or ousia. This approach is called philosophical [[Idealism]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Schopenhauer]] wrote of this [[Neoplatonist]] philosopher: "With Plotinus there even appears, probably for the first time in [[Western philosophy]], ''idealism'' that had long been current in the [[East]] even at that time, for it taught ([[Enneads]], iii, lib. vii, c.10) that the [[soul]] has made the [[world]] by stepping from [[eternity]] into [[time]], with the explanation: 'For there is for this [[universe]] no other place than the soul or [[mind]]' (neque est alter hujus universi locus quam anima), indeed the ideality of time is expressed in the words: 'We should not accept time outside the soul or mind' (oportet autem nequaquam extra animam tempus accipere)." (''[[Parerga and Paralipomena]]'', Volume I, "Fragments for the History of Philosophy," § 7)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation with contemporary philosophy and religion==

=== Plotinus's Relation to Plato===
{{see also|Allegorical interpretations of Plato}}

For several centuries after the [[Protestant Reformation]], Neo-Platonism was condemned as a decadent and 'oriental' distortion of Platonism. In a famous 1929 essay, [[E. R. Dodds]] showed that key conceptions of Neo-Platonism could be traced from their origin in Plato's dialogues, through his immediate followers (e.g., [[Speusippus]]) and the Neo-Pythagoreans, to Plotinus and the Neo-Platonists. Thus Plotinus' philosophy was, he argued, 'not the starting-point of Neo-Platonism but its intellectual culmination.'&lt;ref&gt;E. R. Dodds, 'The Parmenides of Plato and the Origin of the Neoplatonic One,' ''The Classical Quarterly'', v. 22, No. 3/4, 1928, pp. 129-142, esp. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; Further research reinforced this view and by 1954 Merlan could say 'The present tendency is toward bridging rather than widening the gap separating Platonism from Neo-Platonism.'&lt;ref&gt;Philip Merlan, ''From Platonism to Neoplatonism'' (The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff, 1954, 1968), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1950s, the [[Plato's unwritten doctrines|Tübingen School]] of Plato interpretation has argued that the so-called 'unwritten doctrines' of Plato debated by Aristotle and the Early Academy strongly resemble Plotinus's metaphysics. In this case, the Neo-Platonic reading of Plato would be, at least in this central area, historically justified. This implies that Neo-Platonism is less of an innovation than it appears without the recognition of Plato's unwritten doctrines. Advocates of the Tübingen School emphasize this advantage of their interpretation. They see Plotinus as advancing a tradition of thought begun by Plato himself. Plotinus's metaphysics, at least in broad outline, was therefore already familiar to the first generation of Plato's students. This confirms Plotinus' own view, for he considered himself not the inventor of a system but the faithful interpreter of Plato's doctrines.&lt;ref&gt;Detlef Thiel: ''Die Philosophie des Xenokrates im Kontext der Alten Akademie'', München 2006, pp. 197ff. and note 64; Jens Halfwassen: ''Der Aufstieg zum Einen. ''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Plotinus and the Gnostics ===
{{See also|Neoplatonism and Gnosticism}}

At least two modern conferences within Hellenic philosophy fields of study have been held in order to address what Plotinus stated in his tract ''Against the Gnostics'' and to whom he was addressing it, in order to separate and clarify the events and persons involved in the origin of the term "Gnostic". From the dialogue, it appears that the word had an origin in the Platonic and Hellenistic tradition long before the group calling themselves "Gnostics"—or the group covered under the modern term "Gnosticism"—ever appeared. It would seem that this shift from Platonic to Gnostic usage has led many people to confusion. The strategy of sectarians taking [[Greek language|Greek]] terms from philosophical contexts and re-applying them to religious contexts was popular in [[Christianity]], the [[Cult of Isis]] and other ancient religious contexts including [[Hermetica|Hermetic]] ones (see [[Alexander of Abonutichus]] for an example).

Plotinus and the [[neoplatonism|Neoplatonists]] viewed Gnosticism as a form of heresy or [[sectarian]]ism to the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] and [[Platonism|Platonic]] philosophy of the Mediterranean and Middle East.{{refn|group=note|From Introduction to Against the Gnostics Plotinus' Enneads as translated by A. H. Armstrong, pp. 220–222:&lt;br /&gt;The treatise as it stands in the ''[[Enneads]]'' is a most powerful protest on behalf of [[Ancient Greece|Hellenic]] philosophy against the un-Hellenic [[heresy]] (as it was from the Platonist as well as the orthodox Christian point of view) of Gnosticism. There were Gnostics among Plotinus's own friends, whom he had not succeeded in converting (Enneads ch.10 of this treatise) and he and his pupils devoted considerable time and energy to anti-Gnostic controversy (Life of Plotinus ch.16). He obviously considered Gnosticism an extremely dangerous influence, likely to pervert the minds even of members of his own circle. It is impossible to attempt to give an account of Gnosticism here. By far the best discussion of what the particular group of Gnostics Plotinus knew believed is M. Puech's admirable contribution to Entretiens Hardt V (Les Sourcesde Plotin). But it is important for the understanding of this treatise to be clear about the reasons why Plotinus disliked them so intensely and thought their influence so harmful.}} He accused them of using senseless jargon and being overly dramatic and insolent in their distortion of Plato's ontology."{{refn|group=note|From Introduction to Against the Gnostics Plotinus' Enneads as translated by A.

The teaching of the Gnostics seems to him untraditional, irrational and immoral. They despise and revile the ancient Platonic teaching and claim to have a new and superior wisdom of their own: but in fact anything that is true in their teaching comes from Plato, and all they have done themselves is to add senseless complications and pervert the true traditional doctrine into a melodramatic, superstitious fantasy designed to feed their own delusions of grandeur.

Worst of all, they despise and hate the material universe and deny its goodness and the goodness of its maker. This for a Platonist is utter blasphemy, and all the worse because it obviously derives to some extent from the sharply other-worldly side of Plato's own teaching (e.g. in the ''[[Phaedo]]''). At this point in his attack Plotinus comes very close in some ways to the orthodox Christian opponents of Gnosticism, who also insist that this world is the good work of God in his goodness. But, here as on the question of salvation, the doctrine which Plotinus is defending is as sharply opposed on other ways to orthodox Christianity as to Gnosticism: for he maintains not only the goodness of the material universe but also its eternity and its divinity. The idea that the universe could have a beginning and end is inseparably connected in his mind with the idea that the divine action in making it is arbitrary and irrational. And to deny the divinity (though a subordinate and dependent divinity) of the World-Soul, and of those noblest of embodied living beings the heavenly bodies, seems to him both blasphemous and unreasonable. Pages 220–222}}

The Neoplatonic movement (though Plotinus would have simply referred to himself as a philosopher of Plato) seems to be motivated by the desire of Plotinus to revive the pagan philosophical tradition.{{refn|group=note|"... as Plotinus had endeavored to revive the religious spirit of paganism".&lt;ref&gt;''A Biographical History of Philosophy'', by George Henry Lewes Published 1892, G. Routledge &amp; Sons, LTD, p. 294&lt;/ref&gt;}} Plotinus was not claiming to innovate with the ''Enneads'', but to clarify aspects of the works of Plato that he considered misrepresented or misunderstood.&lt;ref name="Stanford1" /&gt; Plotinus does not claim to be an innovator, but rather a communicator of a tradition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pseudo-dionysius-areopagite/ Pseudo-Dionysius] in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt; Plotinus referred to tradition as a way to interpret Plato's intentions. Because the teachings of Plato were for members of the academy rather than the general public, it was easy for outsiders to misunderstand Plato's meaning. However, Plotinus attempted to clarify how the philosophers of the academy had not arrived at the same conclusions (such as [[misotheism]] or [[Eutheism and dystheism|dystheism]] of the creator God as an answer to the [[problem of evil]]) as the targets of his criticism.

=== Against causal astrology ===
Plotinus seems to be one of the first to argue against the still popular notion of causal [[astrology]]. In the late tractate 2.3, "Are the stars causes?", Plotinus makes the argument that specific stars influencing one's fortune (a common [[Hellenistic]] theme) attributes [[irrationality]] to a perfect universe, and invites moral depravity. He does, however, claim the stars and planets are [[Soul (spirit)|ensouled]], as witnessed by their [[Apparent retrograde motion|movement]].

{{quote|To the Christian, the Other World was the Kingdom of Heaven, to be enjoyed after death; to the Platonist, it was the eternal world of ideas, the real world as opposed to that of illusory appearance.

The [[Eastern Orthodox]] position on ''energy,'' for example, is often contrasted with the position of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], and in part this is attributed to varying interpretations of [[Aristotle]] and Plotinus, either through [[Thomas Aquinas]] for the Roman Catholics or [[Gregory of Nyssa]] for the Orthodox Christians.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

As with Islam and Christianity, Neoplatonism in general and Plotinus in particular influenced speculative thought. Notable thinkers expressing Neoplatonic themese are [[Solomon ibn Gabirol]] (Latin: Avicebron) and Moses ben Maimon (Latin: [[Maimonides]]). As with Islam and Christianity, apophatic theology and the privative nature of evil are two prominent themes that such thinkers picked up from either Plotinus or his successors.

=== Renaissance ===
In the [[Renaissance]] the philosopher [[Marsilio Ficino]] set up an Academy under the patronage of [[Cosimo de Medici]] in [[Florence]], mirroring that of Plato. His work was of great importance in reconciling the philosophy of Plato directly with Christianity. One of his most distinguished pupils was [[Pico della Mirandola]], author of ''An Oration On the Dignity of Man''.

=== England ===
In England, Plotinus was the cardinal influence on the 17th-century school of the [[Cambridge Platonists]], and on numerous writers from [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] to [[William Butler Yeats|W. B. Yeats]] and [[Kathleen Raine]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

=== India ===
[[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan]] and [[Ananda Coomaraswamy]] used the writing of Plotinus in their own texts as a superlative elaboration upon Indian [[monism]], specifically [[Upanishad]]ic and [[Advaita]] [[Vedantic]] thought.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} Coomaraswamy has compared Plotinus' teachings to the Hindu school of [[Advaita Vedanta]] (''advaita'' meaning "not two" or "non-dual").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swami-krishnananda.org/com/com_plot.html Swami-krishnananda.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

The joint influence of Advaitin and Neoplatonic ideas on [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] was considered by Dale Riepe in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;Dale Riepe (1967), "Emerson and Indian Philosophy", ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' '''28'''(1):115 (1967)&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[theoretical physics]], the '''problem of time''' is a conceptual conflict between [[general relativity]] and [[quantum mechanics]] in that quantum mechanics regards the flow of time as universal and absolute, whereas general relativity regards the flow of time as malleable and relative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title=Quantum Gravity’s Time Problem | author=Wolchover, Natalie | date=December 1, 2016 | magazine=Quanta Magazine | url=https://www.quantamagazine.org/quantum-gravitys-time-problem-20161201/}}&lt;/ref&gt; This problem raises the question of what [[time]] really is in a physical sense and whether it is truly a real, distinct phenomenon. It also involves the related question of why time seems to flow in a single direction, despite the fact that no known physical laws seem to require a single direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title=Newsflash: Time May Not Exist | author=Folger, Tim | date=June 12, 2007 | magazine=Discover | url=http://discovermagazine.com/2007/jun/in-no-time}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Time in quantum mechanics ==
In [[classical mechanics]], a special status is assigned to time in the sense that it is treated as a classical background parameter, external to the system itself. This special role is seen in the standard formulation of quantum mechanics. It is regarded as part of an a priori given classical background with a well defined value. In fact, the classical treatment of time is deeply intertwined with the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of quantum mechanics, and, thus, with the conceptual foundations of quantum theory: all measurements of observables are made at certain instants of time and probabilities are only assigned to such measurements.

[[Special relativity]] has modified the notion of time. But from a fixed [[Lorentz transformation|Lorentz]] observer's viewpoint time remains a distinguished, absolute, external, global parameter. The Newtonian notion of [[Time#Relativistic time versus Newtonian time|time]] essentially carries over to special relativistic systems, hidden in the [[spacetime]] structure.

== Overturning of absolute time in general relativity ==
Though classically [[spacetime]] appears to be an absolute background, [[general theory of relativity|general relativity]] reveals that spacetime is actually dynamical; gravity is a manifestation of spacetime geometry.  Matter reacts with spacetime: {{Quote|text=Spacetime tells matter how to move; matter tells spacetime how to curve.|author=[[John Archibald Wheeler]]|source=Geons, Black Holes, and Quantum Foam, p. 235&lt;ref name="Wheeler2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Archibald Wheeler|title=Geons, Black Holes, and Quantum Foam: A Life in Physics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zGFkK2tTXPsC|date=18 June 2010|publisher=W. W. Norton|isbn=978-0-393-07948-7|page=235}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Also, spacetime can interact with itself (e.g. gravitational waves). The dynamical nature of spacetime has a vast array of consequences.

{{confusing section|reason=vocabulary needs to be explained: diffeomorphism, Hamiltonian, [[Dirac observables]], perennials, partial observables.  Need to illustrate with example|date=September 2014}}
The dynamical nature of spacetime, via the [[hole argument]], implies that the theory is [[diffeomorphism]] invariant. The constraints are the imprint in the canonical theory of the diffeomorphism invariance of the four-dimensional theory. They also contain the dynamics of the theory, since the Hamiltonian identically vanishes. The quantum theory has no explicit dynamics; wavefunctions are annihilated by the constraints and Dirac observables commute with the constraints and hence are constants of motion. Kuchar introduces the idea of "perennials" and Rovelli the idea of "partial observables". The expectation is that in physical situations some of the variables of the theory will play the role of a "time" with respect to which other variables would evolve and define dynamics in a relational way. This runs into difficulties and is a version of the "problem of time" in the canonical quantization.&lt;ref&gt;K. Kuchar, in "Proceedings of the 4th Canadian meeting on Relativity and Relativistic Astrophysics", editors G. Kunstatter, D. Vincent, J. Williams, World Scientific, Singapore (1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Proposed solutions to the problem of time ==
{{main|Multiple histories}}

The quantum concept of time was invented by physicist [[Bryce DeWitt]] in 1960's:&lt;ref name="Deutsch2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Deutsch|title=The Fabric of Reality|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z7uFxViR19oC&amp;pg=PT240|date=14 April 2011|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|isbn=978-0-14-196961-9|page=240}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''"Different times are special cases of different universes"''

In other words, time is an [[Quantum entanglement|entanglement]] phenomenon, which places all equal clock readings (of correctly prepared clocks - or of any objects usable as clocks) into the same history. This was first understood by physicist [[Don Page (physicist)|Don Page]] and [[William Wootters]] in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first = David|last =  Deutsch|title= The Beginning of Infinity: Explanations that Transform The World| page= 299|date = 2011|publisher = Penguin UK|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ex5xge75SR4C|isbn = 9780141969695}}&lt;/ref&gt; They made a proposal to address the problem of time in systems like general relativity called conditional probabilities interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Page|first1 = Don N.|last2 =  Wootters|first2 =  William K.|date = 15 June 1983|journal =  Phys. Rev.

They made a solution based on the quantum phenomenon of entanglement. Page and Wootters showed how [[quantum entanglement]] can be used to measure time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Aron|first1=Jacob|title=Entangled toy universe shows time may be an illusion|url=https://www.newscientist.com//article/dn24473-entangled-toy-universe-shows-time-may-be-an-illusion|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018065554/http://www.newscientist.com//article/dn24473-entangled-toy-universe-shows-time-may-be-an-illusion|archivedate=2016-10-18|date=October 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, at the Istituto Nazionale di Ricerca Metrologica (INRIM) in Turin, Italy, Ekaterina Moreva, together with Giorgio Brida, Marco Gramegna, Vittorio Giovannetti, Lorenzo Maccone, and Marco Genovese performed the first experimental test of Page and Wootters' ideas. They confirmed that time is an emergent phenomenon for internal observers but absent for external observers of the universe just as the [[Wheeler-DeWitt equation]] predicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quantum Experiment Shows How Time ‘Emerges’ from Entanglement|url=https://medium.com/the-physics-arxiv-blog/quantum-experiment-shows-how-time-emerges-from-entanglement-d5d3dc850933|website=The Physics arXiv Blog|date=Oct 23, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170603063357/https://medium.com/the-physics-arxiv-blog/quantum-experiment-shows-how-time-emerges-from-entanglement-d5d3dc850933|archivedate=2017-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moreva|first1=Ekaterina|last2=Brida|first2=Giorgio|last3=Gramegna|first3=Marco|last4=Giovannetti|first4=Vittorio|last5=Maccone|first5=Lorenzo|last6=Genovese|first6=Marco|title=Time from quantum entanglement: An experimental illustration|journal=Physical Review A|date=20 May 2014|volume=89|issue=5|doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.89.052122|arxiv=1310.4691|bibcode=2014PhRvA..89e2122M}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moreva|first1=Ekaterina|last2=Gramegna|first2=Marco|last3=Brida|first3=Giorgio|last4=Maccone|first4=Lorenzo|last5=Genovese|first5=Marco|title=Quantum time: Experimental multitime correlations|journal=Physical Review D|date=16 November 2017|volume=96 |issue=5|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.96.102005|arxiv=1710.00707|bibcode=2017PhRvD..96j2005M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consistent discretizations approach developed by [[Jorge Pullin]] and [[Rodolfo Gambini]] have no constraints. These are lattice approximation techniques for quantum gravity. In the canonical approach if one discretizes the constraints and equations of motion, the resulting discrete equations are inconsistent: they cannot be solved simultaneously. To address this problem one uses a technique based on discretizing the action of the theory and working with the discrete equations of motion. These are automatically guaranteed to be consistent. Most of the hard conceptual questions of quantum gravity are related to the presence of constraints in the theory. Consistent discretized theories are free of these conceptual problems and can be straightforwardly quantized, providing a solution to the problem of time. It is a bit more subtle than this. Although without constraints and having "general evolution", the latter is only in terms of a discrete parameter that isn't physically accessible. The way out is addressed in a way similar to the Page–Wooters approach. The idea is to pick one of the physical variables to be a clock and asks relational questions. These ideas where the clock is also quantum mechanical have actually led to a new interpretation of quantum mechanics — the [[Minority interpretations of quantum mechanics#Other|Montevideo interpretation]] of quantum mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gambini|first1=Rodolfo|last2=Pullin|first2=Jorge|title=The Montevideo interpretation of quantum mechanics: frequently asked questions|journal=Journal of Physics: Conference Series|date=1 June 2009|volume=174|pages=012003|doi=10.1088/1742-6596/174/1/012003|arxiv=0905.4402}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gambini|first1=Rodolfo|last2=Garc?a-Pintos|first2=Luis Pedro|last3=Pullin|first3=Jorge|title=An axiomatic formulation of the Montevideo interpretation of quantum mechanics|journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part B: Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics|date=November 2011|volume=42|issue=4|pages=256–263|doi=10.1016/j.shpsb.2011.10.002|arxiv=1002.4209|url=http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/9927/|bibcode=2011SHPMP..42..256G}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new interpretation solves the problems of the use of environmental decoherence as a solution to the [[problem of measurement]] in quantum mechanics by invoking fundamental limitations, due to the quantum mechanical nature of clocks, in the process of measurement in quantum mechanics. These limitations are very natural in the context of generally covariant theories as quantum gravity where the clock must be taken as one of the degrees of freedom of the system itself. They have also put forward this fundamental decoherence as a way to resolve the [[black hole information paradox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gambini|first1=Rodolfo|last2=Porto|first2=Rafael A.|last3=Pullin|first3=Jorge|title=No Black Hole Information Puzzle In A Relational Universe|journal=International Journal of Modern Physics D|date=December 2004|volume=13|issue=10|pages=2315–2320|doi=10.1142/S0218271804006383|arxiv=hep-th/0405183|bibcode=2004IJMPD..13.2315G}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gambini|first1=Rodolfo|last2=Porto|first2=Rafael A.|last3=Pullin|first3=Jorge|title=Realistic Clocks, Universal Decoherence, and the Black Hole Information Paradox|journal=Physical Review Letters|date=6 December 2004|volume=93|issue=24|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.93.240401|arxiv=hep-th/0406260|bibcode=2004PhRvL..93x0401G}}&lt;/ref&gt; In certain circumstances, a matter field is used to de-parametrize the theory and introduce a physical Hamiltonian. This generates physical time evolution, not a constraint.

Reduced phase space quantization constraints are solved first then quantized. This approach was considered for some time to be impossible as it seems to require first finding the general solution to Einstein's equations. However, with use of ideas involved in Dittrich's approximation scheme (built on ideas of Rovelli) a way to explicitly implement, at least in principle, a reduced phase space quantization was made viable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thiemann|first1=T|title=Reduced phase space quantization and Dirac observables|journal=Classical and Quantum Gravity|date=21 February 2006|volume=23|issue=4|pages=1163–1180|doi=10.1088/0264-9381/23/4/006|arxiv=gr-qc/0411031|bibcode=2006CQGra..23.1163T}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The thermal time hypothesis ==
{{main|Thermal time hypothesis|thermodynamics}}

[[Generally covariant]] theories do not have a notion of a distinguished physical time with respect to which everything evolves. However, it is not needed for the full formulation and interpretation of the theory. The dynamical laws are determined by correlations which are sufficient to make predictions. But then a mechanism is needed which explains how the familiar notion of time eventually emerges from the timeless structure to become such an important ingredient of the macroscopic world we live in as well as of our conscious experience.

A possible solution to this problem has been put forward by [[Carlo Rovelli]] and [[Alain Connes]], both in the classical and quantum theory, and goes by the name of the thermal time hypothesis. It postulates that physical time flow is not an a priori given fundamental property of the theory, but is a macroscopic feature of thermodynamical origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Connes|first1=A|last2=Rovelli|first2=C|title=Von Neumann algebra automorphisms and time-thermodynamics relation in generally covariant quantum theories|journal=Classical and Quantum Gravity|date=1 December 1994|volume=11|issue=12|pages=2899–2917|doi=10.1088/0264-9381/11/12/007|url=http://www.alainconnes.org/docs/carlotime.pdf|arxiv=gr-qc/9406019|bibcode=1994CQGra..11.2899C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18096">'''Psychoanalytic theory''' is the theory of personality organization and the dynamics of personality development that guides [[psychoanalysis]], a clinical method for treating [[psychopathology]]. First laid out by [[Sigmund Freud]] in the late 19th century, psychoanalytic theory has undergone many refinements since his work. Psychoanalytic theory came to full prominence in the last third of the twentieth century as part of the flow of critical discourse regarding psychological treatments after the 1960s, long after Freud's death in 1939,&lt;ref&gt;Tere sa de Lauretis, ''Freud's Drive'' (Basingstoke 2008) p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; and its validity is now widely disputed or rejected.&lt;ref name="Miller, Alice 1984, pp. 105"&gt;Miller, Alice. ''Thou Shalt Not Be Aware, Society's Betrayal of the Child'' New York: Farrar Straus Giroux, 1984, pp. 105–227&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kupfersmid, Joel"&gt;Kupfersmid, Joel. Abstract [http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy&amp;id=1996-00446-003 ''Does the Oedipus complex exist?''], [[American Psychological Association]], 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Freud had ceased his analysis of the brain and his physiological studies and shifted his focus to the study of the mind and the related psychological attributes making up the mind, and on treatment using [[Free association (psychology)|free association]] and the phenomena of [[transference]]. His study emphasized the recognition of childhood events that could influence the mental functioning of adults. His examination of the genetic and then the developmental aspects gave the psychoanalytic theory its characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Tyson, Phyllis. (2002). The challenges of psychoanalytic developmental theory. Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association, 50, 19–52.&lt;/ref&gt;  Starting with his publication of ''[[The Interpretation of Dreams]]'' in 1899, his theories began to gain prominence.

==Terminology and definition==
Psychoanalytic and psychoanalytical are used in English. The latter is the older term, and at first simply meant 'relating to the analysis of the human psyche'. But with the emergence of psychoanalysis as a distinct clinical practice, both terms came to describe that. Although both are still used, today, the normal adjective is psychoanalytic.&lt;ref&gt;"psychoanalytical, adj. (and n.)." and "psychoanalytic, adj." OED Online. Oxford University Press, June 2015. Web. 7 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychoanalysis is defined in the ''Oxford English Dictionary'' as
&lt;blockquote&gt;A therapeutic method, originated by Sigmund Freud, for treating mental disorders by investigating the interaction of conscious and unconscious elements in the patient's mind and bringing repressed fears and conflicts into the conscious mind, using techniques such as dream interpretation and free association. Also: a system of psychological theory associated with this method.&lt;ref&gt;"psychoanalysis, n." OED Online. Oxford University Press, June 2015. Web. 7 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Through the scope of a psychoanalytic lens, humans are described as having sexual and aggressive drives. Psychoanalytic theorists believe that human behavior is deterministic. It is governed by irrational forces, and the unconscious, as well as instinctual and biological drives. Due to this deterministic nature, psychoanalytic theorists do not believe in free will.&lt;ref name="Friedman"&gt;Friedman, H. W., &amp; Schustack, M. W. (2011). Personality: Classics theories and modern research. (5th Edition). Boston, MA: Allyn &amp; Bacon.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The beginnings==
Freud first began his studies on psychoanalysis in collaboration with Dr. [[Josef Breuer]], especially when it came to the study on [[Anna O.]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Freud/Origin/index.htm], Sigmund Freud: The Origin and Development of Psychoanalysis.&lt;/ref&gt;  The relationship between Freud and Breuer was a mix of admiration and competition, based on the fact that they were working together on the Anna O. case and had to balance two different ideas as to her diagnosis and treatment. Today, Breuer can be considered the grandfather of psychoanalysis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freudfile.org/breuer.html], FreudFile: Joseph Breuer.&lt;/ref&gt;  Anna O. was subject to both physical and psychological disturbances, such as not being able to drink out of fear.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freudfile.org/psychoanalysis/annao_case.html], FreudFild: Anna O. Case.&lt;/ref&gt;  Breuer and Freud both found that hypnosis was a great help in discovering more about Anna O. and her treatment. The research and ideas behind the study on Anna O. were highly referenced in Freud's lectures on the origin and development of psychoanalysis.

These observations led Freud to theorize that the problems faced by hysterical patients could be associated with painful childhood experiences that could not be recalled. The influence of these lost memories shaped the feelings, thoughts and behaviours of patients. These studies contributed to the development of the psychoanalytic theory.&lt;ref&gt;Schacter, Gilbert, Wegner. ""Psychology"". Second Edition. New York. Worth Publishers. 2009, 2011. p.12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personality structure==
Sigmund Freud determined that the personality consists of three different elements, the [[Id, ego and super-ego|id]], the [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]] and the [[superego]]. The id is the aspect of personality that is driven by internal and basic drives and needs. These are typically instinctual, such as hunger, thirst, and the drive for sex, or libido. The id acts in accordance with the [[pleasure principle (psychology)|pleasure principle]], in that it avoids pain and seeks pleasure. Due to the instinctual quality of the id, it is impulsive and often unaware of implications of actions. The [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]] is driven by the reality principle. The ego works to balance the id and superego, by trying to achieve the id's drive in the most realistic ways. It seeks to rationalize the id's instinct and please the drives that benefit the individual in the long term. It helps separate what is real, and realistic of our drives as well as being realistic about the standards that the superego sets for the individual. The [[superego]] is driven by the morality principle. It acts in connection with the morality of higher thought and action. Instead of instinctively acting like the id, the superego works to act in socially acceptable ways. It employs morality, judging our sense of wrong and right and using guilt to encourage socially acceptable behavior.&lt;ref name="Friedman" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Silberman, Edward. "Review of Psychodynamic Therapy: A Guide to Evidence-Based Practice." Psychiatry: Interpersonal and Biological Processes 75.3 (2012): 298–301. PsycINFO. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The unconscious==
The [[unconscious mind|unconscious]] is the portion of the mind of which a person is not aware. Freud said that it is the unconscious that exposes the true feelings, emotions, and thoughts of the individual. There are variety of psychoanalytic techniques used to access and understand the unconscious, ranging from methods like hypnosis, free association, and dream analysis. Dreams allow us to explore the unconscious; according to Freud, they are "the 'royal road' to the unconscious".&lt;ref&gt;Freud, S (1915). The Unconscious. XIV (2nd ed.). Hogarth Press, 1955.&lt;/ref&gt; Dreams are composed of [[Content (Freudian dream analysis)|latent]] and [[Content (Freudian dream analysis)|manifest]] content. Whereas latent content is the underlying meaning of a dream that may not be remembered when a person wakes up, manifest content is the content from the dream that a person remembers upon waking and can be analyzed by a psychoanalytic psychologist. Exploring and understanding the manifest content of dreams can inform the individual of complexes or disorders that may be under the surface of their personality. Dreams can provide access to the unconscious that is not easily accessible.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, S (1900). The Interpretation of Dreams. IV and V (2nd ed.). Hogarth Press, 1955.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Freudian slips]] (also known as [[parapraxes]]) occur when the ego and superego do not work properly, exposing the id and internal drives or wants. They are considered mistakes revealing the unconscious. Examples range from calling someone by the wrong name, misinterpreting a spoken or written word, or simply saying the wrong thing.&lt;ref&gt;Modell, Arnold H. "Psychoanalysis, Neuroscience and the Unconscious Self." Psychoanalytic review 99.4 (2012): 475-83.PsycINFO. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Defense mechanisms==
The ego balances the id, superego, and reality to maintain a healthy state of consciousness. It thus reacts to protect the individual from any stressors and anxiety by distorting reality. This prevents threatening unconscious thoughts and material from entering the consciousness. The different types of [[defense mechanisms]] are: [[Repression (psychology)|Repression]], [[reaction formation]], [[denial]], [[Psychological projection|projection]], [[displacement (psychology)|displacement]], [[sublimation (psychology)|sublimation]], [[regression (psychology)|regression]], and [[rationalization (making excuses)|rationalization]].&lt;ref&gt;Freud, A. (1937). The Ego and the Mechanisms of Defense, London: Hogarth Press and Institute of Psycho-Analysis. (Revised edition: 1966 (US), 1968 (UK))&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychology theories==

===Psychosexual development===
Freud's take on the development of the personality ([[psyche (psychology)|psyche]]). It is a stage theory that believes progress occurs through stages as the libido is directed to different body parts. The different stages, listed in order of progression, are: Oral, Anal, Phallic ([[Oedipus complex]]), Latency, Genital. The Genital stage is achieved if people meet all their needs throughout the other stages with enough available sexual energy. Individuals who don't have their needs met in a given stage become fixated, or "stuck" in that stage.

===Neo-analytic theory===
Freud's theory and work with psychosexual development lead to Neo-Analytic/ [[Neo-Freudianism|Neo-Freudians]] who also believed in the importance of the unconscious, dream interpretations, defense mechanisms and the integral influence of childhood experiences but had objections to the theory as well. They do not support the idea that development of the personality stops at age 6, instead they believed development spreads across the lifespan. They extended Freud's work and encompassed more influence from the environment and the importance of conscious thought along with the unconscious. The most important theorists are [[Erik Erikson]] (Psychosocial Development), [[Anna Freud]], [[Carl Jung]], [[Alfred Adler]] and [[Karen Horney]], and including the school of [[object relations]].

==Critics of psychoanalytic theory==
The psychoanalytic approach has a variety of advantages and limitations that have spurred further research and expansion into the realm of personality development.

===Advantages===
* The theory emphasizes the importance of childhood experiences.
* It initiated and addressed the importance of the unconscious, sexual and aggressive drives that make up the majority of all human beings' personalities.&lt;ref&gt;Gaffney, Tim W., and Cassandra Perryman. "Educational Achievement, Personality, and Behavior: Assessment, Factor Structure and Implication for Theory and Practice." Journal of Applied Measurement 13.2 (2012): 181–204. PsycINFO. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The approach also explains defense mechanisms and why every individual reacts differently to similar situations.

===Limits===
* Some claim that the theory is lacking in empirical data and too focused on [[pathology]].&lt;ref&gt;Mahmood, Omar M., and Sawssan R. Ahmed. Psychological Testing and Assessment. New York, NY, US: Routledge/Taylor &amp; Francis Group, New York, NY, 2012. PsycINFO. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Some claim that this theory lacks consideration of culture and its influence on personality.&lt;ref&gt;Hoggard, Lori S., Christy M. Byrd, and Robert M. Sellers. "Comparison of African American College Students' Coping with Racially and Nonracially Stressful Events." Cultural Diversity and Ethnic Minority Psychology 18.4 (2012): 329-39. PsycINFO. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Giamo, Lisa S., Michael T. Schmitt, and H. R. Outten. "Perceived Discrimination, Group Identification, and Life Satisfaction among Multiracial People: A Test of the Rejection-Identification Model." Cultural Diversity and Ethnic Minority Psychology 18.4 (2012): 319-28. PsycINFO. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychoanalysis and aesthetics ===
Psychoanalytic theory is a major influence in [[Continental philosophy]] and in [[aesthetics]] in particular. Freud is considered a philosopher in some areas, and other philosophers, such as [[Jacques Lacan]], [[Michel Foucault]], and [[Jacques Derrida]] have written extensively on how psychoanalysis informs philosophical analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Felman, Shoshana. Jacques Lacan and the adventure of insight: Psychoanalysis in contemporary culture. Harvard University Press, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spector, Jack J. The aesthetics of Freud: A study in psychoanalysis and art. Lane, Allen, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Segal, Hanna. "A psychoanalytic approach to aesthetics." Reading Melanie Klein (1998): 203.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Glover, Nicky. Psychoanalytic aesthetics: An introduction to the British School. Karnac Books, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychoanalysis and literature===
When analysing literary texts, the psychoanalytic theory could be utilized to decipher or interpret the concealed meaning within a text, or to better understand the author's intentions. Through the analysis of motives, Freud's theory can be used to help clarify the meaning of the writing as well as the actions of the characters within the text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lye|first=J|title=Psychoanalysis and Literature,|url=http://www.brocku.ca/english/courses/4F70/psychlit.php|accessdate=17 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17280">'''Rectification of Names''' ({{zh|c=[[wikt:正|正]] [[wikt:名|名]]|p=Zhèngmíng|w=Cheng-ming}}). Confucius was asked what he would do if he was a governor. He said he would "rectify the names" to make words correspond to reality. The phrase has now become known as a doctrine of feudal [[Confucian]] designations and relationships, behaving accordingly to ensure social harmony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Oldstone-Moore|first=Jennifer|title=Confucianism|location=New York|publisher=Oxford University Press, Incorporated|year=2002|pages=54–60.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without such accordance society would essentially crumble and "undertakings would not be completed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=Rodney L.|last2=Choy|first2=Howard|title=The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Confucianism|edition=1|volume=1|location=New York|publisher= The Rosen Group, Incorporated|year= 2003|pages= 48–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mencius]] extended the doctrine to include questions of [[political legitimacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indiana.edu/~p374/Legalism.pdf |title=Legalism and Huang-Lao Thought |last=Eno |first=R. |website=Indiana University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mohism and Legalism==
{{further information|Wu wei|Legalism (Chinese philosophy)}}

Because the rectification of names in the [[Analects of Confucius]] appears to have been written later, it arguably originates in [[Mozi]] (470–391 BC).&lt;ref name="Hansen Philosophy of Language"&gt;Chad Hansen. [http://www.philosophy.hku.hk/ch/lang.htm Philosophy of Language in Classical China].&lt;/ref&gt; The scholarship of [[Herrlee G. Creel]] argued for its further development through [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|"Legalist"]] [[Shen Buhai]] (400–337 BC) before the Confucian usage for the same reasons.&lt;ref&gt;A.C. Graham 1989. p.&amp;nbsp;284. [https://books.google.com/books?id=QBzyCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA284 Disputers of the Tao].&lt;/ref&gt; However, professor Zhenbhin Sun considers Mozi's rectification consonant with the Confucian usage; Mozi considered it an important factor in the resolution of sociopolitical issues, and not simply legal affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Zhenbin Sun 2015. p.&amp;nbsp;18. [https://books.google.com/books?id=MLx_BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA18 Language, Discourse, and Praxis in Ancient China].&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mohist and "Legalistic" version of the rectification of names is Fa.&lt;ref name="Chad Hansen p.348-349"&gt;Chad Hansen, 1992 pp.&amp;nbsp;348–349 [https://books.google.com/books?id=nzHmobC0ThsC&amp;pg=PA348 A Daoist Theory of Chinese Thought]&lt;/ref&gt; Mozi advocated language standards appropriate for use by ordinary people.&lt;ref name="Hansen Philosophy of Language" /&gt; With minimal training, anyone can use Fa to perform a task or check results.&lt;ref name="Bo Mou p. 143"&gt;Bo Mou 2009 p.&amp;nbsp;143.

However, it could complement any traditional scheme, and Guan Zhong uses Fa alongside the Confucian [[Li (Confucian)|Li]]. What Fa made possible was the accurate following of instructions.&lt;ref name="Chad Hansen p.348-349"/&gt; For the most part Confucianism does not elaborate on Fa, though the idea of norms themselves are older and Han Confucians embraced Fa as an essential element in administration.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Zhongying Cheng 1991 p.&amp;nbsp;315.

Rejecting the Confucian idea of parents as a moral model as particular and unreliable, the driving idea of the Mohists was the use of [[Hermeneutics]] to find objective models (Fa) for ethics and politics, as was done in any practical field, to order or govern society. These were primarily practical rather than principles or rules,&lt;ref&gt;Bo Mou 2009 pp.&amp;nbsp;143–144. [https://books.google.com/books?id=UL1-AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA143 Routledge History of Chinese Philosophy Volume 3].&lt;/ref&gt; as in the square and plumb-line.&lt;ref name="philosophy.hku.hk"&gt;Chad Hansen, University of Hong Kong. [http://www.philosophy.hku.hk/ch/Lord%20Shang.htm Lord Shang].&lt;/ref&gt; The Mohists used Fa as "objective, particularly operational or measurement-like standards for fixing the referents of names",&lt;ref&gt;Chad Hansen. [http://www.philosophy.hku.hk/ch/Shen%20Bu%20Hai.htm#fa Shen Buhai].&lt;/ref&gt; hoping that the natural standards (Fa) of language (names) would yield some objective way (dao) of moral reform.

Measuring to obtain a clear standard,&lt;ref name="Bo Mou p. 143" /&gt; Fa compares something against itself, and then judges whether the two are similar, just as with the use of the compass or the L-square.&lt;ref name="winterstanford"&gt;Fraser, Chris, "[http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2015/entries/mohism/ Mohism]", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2015 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bo Mou p. 143" /&gt; This constituted the basic conception of Mohists practical reasoning and knowledge. What matches the standard is the particular object, and thus correct; what doesn't is not. Knowledge is a matter of "being able to do something correctly in practice" — and in particular, being able to distinguish various kinds of things from one another. Evaluating correctness is thus determining whether distinctions have been drawn properly. Its aim is not an intellectual grasp of a definition or principle, but the practical ability to perform a task (dao) successfully.&lt;ref name="winterstanford" /&gt; Fixing the content given moral model, they proposed emulation for the establishment of order.&lt;ref&gt;Bo Mou 2009 pp.&amp;nbsp;145,147.

By contrast, the ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]'' says that "great words are overflowing; small words haggling"(2.2), the true self lacks form(2.3), the mind can spontaneously select (2.4), asks whether language is different from the chirping of birds(2.5), and rejects assertion and denial(2.7), saying "to wear out one's spirit like powers contriving some view... without understanding that it is all the same is called 'three in the morning{{'"}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiana.edu/~p374/Zhuangzi.pdf R.

== Confucius ==
The ''[[Analects]]'' states that social disorder often stems from failure to call things by their proper names, that is, to perceive, understand, and deal with [[reality]]. His solution to this was the "rectification of names". He gave an explanation to one of his disciples:
{{Quotation|A superior man, in regard to what he does not know, shows a cautious reserve. If names be not correct, language is not in accordance with the truth of things. If language be not in accordance with the truth of things, affairs cannot be carried on to success. When affairs cannot be carried on to success, proprieties and music do not flourish. When proprieties and music do not flourish, punishments will not be properly awarded. When punishments are not properly awarded, the people do not know how to move hand or foot. Therefore a superior man considers it necessary that the names he uses may be spoken appropriately, and also that what he speaks may be carried out appropriately. What the superior man requires is just that in his words there may be nothing incorrect.|
[[Confucius]]|Analects|Book XIII, Chapter 3, verses 4–7, translated by [[James Legge]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Confucian analects: The great learning, and The doctrine of the mean|author=[[James Legge]]|publisher=[[Dover Publications]]|year=1971|pages=263–264}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The teaching of Confucius consist of five basic relationships in life:
* Ruler to subject
* Parent to child
* [[Women in ancient and imperial China|Husband to wife]]
* Elder brother to younger brother
* Friend to friend

In the above relationships, Confucius teaches that righteous, considerate, kind, benevolent, and gentle treatment should be applied by the former to the latter. And that with the application of such practices in day-to-day life, societal problems would be solved and righteous government would be achieved. The carrying out of these relational duties would equate the proper channeling of li and the correct use of zhèngmíng congruent to Confucius' teachings leading to the envisioned path of his doctrine; a moral and efficient society and individuals who have achieved the ascension to superior human beings through the principles of li and [[Ren (Confucianism)|jen]]. The proper operation of oneself ultimately depends on the role of zhèngmíng; essentially a circle of dependency in terms of the practice and application of principles and ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hopfe|first=Lewis M.|title= Religions of the World|location=Upper Saddle River|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=2006|pages=178–85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Confucianism, the Rectification of Names means that "things in actual fact should be made to accord with the implications attached to them by names, the prerequisites for correct living and even efficient government being that all classes of society should accord to what they ought to be".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Warren|last=Steinkraus|title=Socrates, Confucius, and the Rectification of Names|journal=Philosophy East and West|volume=30|year=1980|pages=261–64|doi=10.2307/1398850|jstor=1398850}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without the rectification of names, different words would have different actions. This essentially means for every action, there is a word that describes that action. The belief is that by following the Rectification of Names, one would be following the correct/right path. The rectification of names also calls for a standard language in which ancient rulers could impose laws that everyone could understand to avoid confusion.

Each person has a social standing and a social name. With their social names comes responsibilities and duties. Ruler, minister, father and son all have social names therefore need to fulfill their required social duties of respect (The rectification of names). For example, in the study of [[Chinese culture]] a child only speaks when a parent permits them to speak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bailey|first=Benjamin|title=Communication of Respect in Interethnic Service Encounters|journal=Language in Society|volume=26|year=1997|pages=327–356|doi=10.1017/s0047404500019497|jstor=4168775}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Following orders from a person of authority means that you are showing respect, therefore that you are following the Rectification of Names without explicitly acknowledging it. Confucius' belief in the Rectification of Names is still practiced in today's society, for example when a teacher asks a student to address a visitor, that student will follow the instructions.

A broader example, the only way to be a true/real ruler even in name is by following "the way of the ruler"(The rectification of names).

==Xunzi==
{{Quotation|Nets are for catching fish; after one gets the fish, one forgets the net. Traps are for catching rabbits; after one gets the rabbit, one forgets the trap. Words are for getting meaning; after one gets the meaning, one forgets the words. Where can I find people who have forgotten words, and have a word with them?|''Zhuangzi''|| Ch. 26}}

[[Xun Zi]] wrote a chapter on "The Rectification of Names" developing a theme that had been introduced by Confucius saying: "Let the ruler be ruler, the subject subject; let the father be father, and the son son."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Staal|first=Frits|title=Oriental Ideas on the Origin of Language|journal= Journal of the American Oriental Society|volume=99|year=1979|pages=1|doi=10.2307/598944|jstor=598944}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Removed temporarily: (Fung, 1952). This might refer to "A Short History of Chinese Philosophy" by Yu-lan Fung (edited by Derk Bodde), which was originally published in 1948 and has 400 pages --&gt; Chapter 22, "on the Rectification of Names", claims the ancient sage kings chose names (Chinese:名, Pinyin:míng) that directly corresponded with actualities (Chinese: 實, Pinyin: shí), but later generations confused terminology, coined new nomenclature, and thus could no longer distinguish right from wrong.

Xun Zi not only wrote that chapter on the topic of the rectification of names but went as far as to develop/expand the rectification into a system of logic. Xun Zi, who believed that man's inborn tendencies need to be curbed through education and ritual, countered to [[Mencius]]'s view that man is innately good. He believed that ethical norms had been invented to rectify mankind. Other philosophers and logicians such as [[Guanzi (text)|Guanzi]], [[Mozi]], and [[Gongsun Long]] developed their own theories regarding the rectification. Li in itself can be seen as the root of all this propriety and social etiquette discussed in the rectification of names as the cure to society's problems and the solution to a moral and efficient government and society.

==Modern applications==
The concept of rectification of names is one of the most basic mottoes of Chinese philosophy to date. It has been applied to a broad range of issues and mainly resides in the field of politics. This basic yet powerful precept has served as a means for the toppling and reforming of dynasties. In today's society, the rectification of names is being used popularly with government decisions.

Until 2008 [[Taiwan]] put effort into reviewing their historical records and [[Desinicization|weeding out any affiliation with China]] to insure their isolated identity. The [[Democratic Progressive Party]] administration had been editing grade school history textbooks to refer to Chinese history as "Chinese history" instead of "this country's history" and removing the honorific title "Father of the country" from references to [[Sun Yat-sen]], leaving only his name. (Berman Feb 7, 2007) For those who still practice the traditional Confucian approach to ethics and social morality, the rectification of names has an impact in the way society is structured. According to Xuezhi Guo, "Rectification of names also implies the promotion and development of an elaborately differentiated system of status based on social obligations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Guo|first=Xuezhi |title=The Ideal Chinese Political Leader|page=30|year=2002|publisher=Praeger Publishers, an imprint of Greenwood Publishing Group|location=Westport, Connecticut}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rhizome''' is a philosophical concept developed by [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]] in their ''[[Capitalism and Schizophrenia]]'' (1972–1980) project. It is what Deleuze calls an "image of thought," based on the [[rhizome|botanical rhizome]], that apprehends [[Multiplicity (philosophy)|multiplicities]].

==As a mode of knowledge and model for society==
Deleuze and Guattari use the terms "rhizome" and "rhizomatic" to describe theory and research that allows for multiple, non-hierarchical entry and exit points in data representation and interpretation. In ''[[A Thousand Plateaus]]'', they oppose it to an [[arborescent]] (hierarchic, tree-like) conception of knowledge, which works with dualist categories and binary choices. A rhizome works with planar and trans-species connections, while an arborescent model works with vertical and linear connections. Their use of the "orchid and the wasp" is taken from the biological concept of [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualism]], in which two different species interact together to form a [[multiplicity (philosophy)|multiplicity]] (i.e. a unity that is multiple in itself). [[Hybridisation (biology)|Hybridization]] or [[horizontal gene transfer]] would also be good illustrations.

"As a model for culture, the rhizome resists the organizational structure of the root-tree system which charts causality along chronological lines and looks for the original source of 'things' and looks towards the pinnacle or conclusion of those 'things.' A rhizome, on the other hand, is characterized by 'ceaselessly established connections between semiotic chains, organizations of power, and circumstances relative to the arts, sciences, and social struggles.' Rather than narrativize history and culture, the rhizome presents history and culture as a map or wide array of attractions and influences with no specific origin or genesis, for a 'rhizome has no beginning or end; it is always in the middle, between things, interbeing, intermezzo.' The planar movement of the rhizome resists chronology and organization, instead favoring a nomadic system of growth and propagation.

"In this model, culture spreads like the surface of a body of water, spreading towards available spaces or trickling downwards towards new spaces through fissures and gaps, eroding what is in its way. The surface can be interrupted and moved, but these disturbances leave no trace, as the water is charged with pressure and potential to always seek its equilibrium, and thereby establish smooth space."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rhizomes.net/issue5/poke/glossary.html Rhizomes.net]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles==

Deleuze and Guattari introduce ''[[A Thousand Plateaus]]'' by outlining the concept of the rhizome (quoted from ''A Thousand Plateaus''):

*1 and 2. Principles of connection and heterogeneity: "...any point of a rhizome can be connected to any other, and must be";
*3. Principle of multiplicity: it is only when the multiple is effectively treated as a substantive, "multiplicity", that it ceases to have any relation to the One;
*4. Principle of asignifying rupture: a rhizome may be broken, but it will start up again on one of its old lines, or on new lines;
*5 and 6. Principle of cartography and [[decalcomania]]: a rhizome is not amenable to any structural or generative model; it is a "map and not a tracing".

A '''sanky-panky''' or sankyx is a [[male]] [[sex worker]], found in the [[Caribbean]] in the [[Dominican Republic]].&lt;ref name="dr1" /&gt; A sanky-panky solicits on beaches and has clients of both sexes or only women.&lt;ref name="Expat Focus"&gt;{{cite web |title=Interesting Surprises - The Gay Scene In The Dominican Republic |url=https://www.expatfocus.com/c/aid=932/columnists/lindsay-de-feliz/interesting-surprises---the-gay-scene-in-the-dominican-republic/ |website=Expat Focus |accessdate=5 August 2018 |language=en |date=23 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; When with men, the sanky-panky assumes an active (a.k.a. [[Top, bottom and versatile|top]]) role, but when with women, assumes the role of an ideal lover. 

While strictly speaking they are not [[prostitutes]], since they do not directly negotiate money for sex, they are more likely to create a pseudo-relationship which can be continued when the guest returns home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Connecting People Through News |url=https://www.pressreader.com/canada/montreal-gazette/20070106/281943128402292 |website=Montreal Gazette |accessdate=5 August 2018 |date=6 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; They then attempt to ask for [[money]] to be sent to them primarily by [[wire transfer]], often using elaborate stories of need, involving (for example) sick relatives.&lt;ref name="dr1"&gt;{{cite web |title=Sanky Pankies in the Dominican Republic |url=http://dr1.com/articles/sankies.shtml |website=dr1.com |accessdate=5 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A sanky's ultimate goal is to obtain a [[marriage]] [[Visa (document)|visa]] to the tourist's native country, marry the tourist, then abandon her.&lt;ref name="DRsisterhood"&gt;{{cite web |title=Sanky Pankies |url=https://drsisterhoodwordpress.wordpress.com/sanky-pankies/ |website=DRsisterhood |accessdate=5 August 2018 |date=10 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bricheros==
In [[Peru]] they are known as bricheros (which are male and usually target female tourists) and bricheras (who are females instead and target male tourists). They hang out in popular tourist destinations and may even involve themselves in business involving tourism in order to reach their prey.&lt;ref name="Roguet"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Roguet |first1=Juliette |title=Bricherismo in Peruvian touristic areas: the configuration of gender in asymmetrical and intercultural encounters |url=http://www.alternautas.net/blog/2016/7/15/bricherismo-in-peruvian-touristic-areas-the-configuration-of-gender-in-asymmetrical-and-intercultural-encounters |website=Alternautas |accessdate=5 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Puta-Tour"==
In certain tourist cities of [[Venezuela]], and specially in the city of [[Mérida, Mérida|Mérida]], females following a similar pattern of conduct are known as "Puta-Tour", a pejorative term that relates the person with travel based prostitution. Nevertheless, there are cases where the sexual intercourse is never reached, and long term friendships are the result. They usually target White American and European tourists, primarily in the interest of learning and/or practicing a foreign language (other than Spanish), serving also as a nice host and tourist guide, but expecting to get invited to travel to the tourist's native country. These relationships can range from friendship to marriage, and are based on the cultural interchanging and traveling, supported by the foreign tourist.

==Sanky-pankies in popular culture==
The persona of the "sanky panky" has been brought to the cinema in 2007 by [[Spain|Spanish]] director [[Jose E. Pintor]]. In his comedic film entitled ''[[Sanky Panky (film)|Sanky Panky]]'', audiences follow the life of a young Dominican man named Genaro (played by Dominican comedian [[Fausto Mata]]) who travels to [[Bávaro]] to work at a [[resort]] in hopes of finding a "gringa" or a [[white American]] woman who will give him a visa. In the process, he meets a young heartbroken woman and her two older and oversexed aunts. The story that follows presents the beauties of Dominican resorts but portrays the realities of [[poverty]] in the [[Dominican Republic]] while simultaneously immortalizing the "sanky panky" via major [[motion picture]].&lt;ref name="sank"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dominicantoday.com/dr/this-and-that/2007/5/23/24033/Sanky-Panky-has-its-New-York-premiere|title='Sanky Panky' Has Its New York Premiere|accessdate=2008-04-27|date=2007-05-23|author=Chris Diego|work=Dominican Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A film that explores this topic in a [[Francophone]] context is ''[[Heading South (film)|Heading South]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Holden |first1=Stephen |title=Heading South - Review - Movies |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2006/07/07/movies/07sout.html |website=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=5 August 2018 |language=en |date=7 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shalom Carmy''' (born May 1, 1949) is an [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] [[rabbi]] teaching [[Jewish studies]] and [[philosophy]] at [[Yeshiva University]], where he is Chair of [[Bible]] and [[Jewish philosophy]] at [[Yeshiva College (Yeshiva University)|Yeshiva College]] and an affiliated scholar at [[Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law]]. He is also Editor of ''[[Tradition (journal)|Tradition]]'', an Orthodox theological journal, and writes a regular column on ''[[First Things]]''.

A [[Brooklyn]] native, he is a prominent [[Modern Orthodox]] theologian, historian, and philosopher. He received his [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in 1969 and [[Master of Science|M.S.]] from Yeshiva University, and received his [[semicha|rabbinic ordination]] from its affiliated [[Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary]], studying under Rabbis [[Aharon Lichtenstein]] and [[Joseph Soloveitchik]]. He has edited some of R. Soloveitchik's work for publication.  Carmy has written many articles on [[Biblical theology]], Jewish thought, Orthodoxy in the 20th century and the role of [[liberal arts]] in a Torah education.  He edited "Modern Scholarship in the Study of Torah: Contributions and Limitations" ({{ISBN|1-56821-450-2}}), “Jewish Perspectives on the Experience of Suffering” as well as several other works. He writes a regular personal column in Tradition, and contributes regularly on Jewish and general subjects to [[First Things]] and other journals. In addition to his exegetical and analytic work, Carmy's theological contribution is distinguished by preoccupation with the way religious doctrine and practice express themselves in the life of the individual.

Early in his teaching career he devised an imaginary television series, ''Police Philosopher'', about a philosopher who gets involved in police cases. Carmy has said that "''Police Philosopher'' was born the day I spied an ad in a professional journal, seeking a professor of philosophy prepared to teach at a local precinct so that the cops could get college credit without having to be on campus. Wouldn't it be interesting if the professor got involved in police cases?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lookstein.org/articles/imitate_ramban.htm|title=Imitate the Ramban, not the Professors - The Lookstein center|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2008">'''Simone Simoni''' (1532, [[Lucca]]  - 1602, [[Kraków]]) was an Italian philosopher and physician.

After graduating in medicine from the [[University of Padua]], Simoni moved to [[Geneva]] where he became professor of philosophy and engaged in controversy with [[Jakob Schegk]]. Expelled by the city for his heretical views, he moved to [[Paris]] and subsequently to [[Leipzig]] (where he was accused of [[Arianism]] in 1575) and [[Heidelberg]] (where he was forced to leave in 1579). In 1581 he became court physician to [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor]] in [[Prague]]; there were unconfirmed rumours that he had converted to Catholicism.

Simoni moved on to [[Poland]] to become court physician to [[Stephen Báthory]]. When the King died in 1586, Simoni was accused of having prescribed the wrong treatment and after a bitter dispute his rival [[Nicholas Buccella]] was appointed personal physician to the new king [[Sigismund III Vasa]]. SImoni moved to [[Moravia]], where he spent the rest of his life.

Simoni wrote a commentary on [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[De Sensu]]''. He gave a notably crisp formulation to the principle that physicians should undergo preliminary preparation in Aristotelian [[natural philosophy]]: ''Ubi desinit physicus, ibi medicus incipit'' [The physician starts where the natural philosopher leaves off].&lt;ref&gt;Charles B. Schmitt, 'Aristotle among the physicians', in Andrew Wear et al., eds., ''The Medical renaissance of the sixteenth century'', Cambridge University Press, 1985, p.12&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Universe in a Single Atom''''' is a book by [[Tenzin Gyatso]], the 14th [[Dalai Lama]] and published in 2005 by [[Morgan Road Books]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lama|first=His Holiness the Dalai|title=The universe in a single atom : the convergence of science and spirituality|year=2006|publisher=Broadway Books|location=New York|isbn=0767920813}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this book Dalai Lama engages in several scientific areas. He explores the topics of [[quantum physics]], [[cosmology]], [[consciousness]] and [[genetics]] in relation to [[Buddhism]].

== Rationale ==

Tenzin Gyatso, at the age of 6, was chosen as the 14th Dalai Lama. He is believed to be the [[reincarnation]] of his predecessors.&lt;ref name="A and E"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dalai Lama Biography|url=http://www.biography.com/people/dalai-lama-9264833|publisher=Biography|accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At an early age, Gyatso showed interest in science and the scientific method. In this book, "The Universe in a Single Atom", Tenzin Gyatso explores the commonality and difference between Buddhism and scientific argumentation.

=== Beginnings in Science ===

In this book, "The Universe in a Single Atom," The Dalai Lama exhibits humble beginnings in science, including finding a brass telescope from the [[thirteenth Dalai Lama]]. With the telescope, he was able to find "[[Moon rabbit|the rabbit on the moon]]," a Tibetan saying for a land form on the moon.&lt;ref name="Wallace Updated" /&gt; Utilizing other apparatuses such as cars and watches, the Dalai Lama took interest in the mechanical operations of the objects.

=== Commonality between Buddhism and Science ===

In the book, The Dalai Lama creates exigency for the peaceful relationship between Buddhism and science. The goal is to mitigate human suffering from both Buddhist philosophy and science.&lt;ref name=Armengol&gt;{{cite journal|last=Armengol|first=Guillermo|title=THE UNIVERSE IN A SINGLE ATOM ACCORDING  TO THE DALAI LAMA: The Dalai Lama on Science and Religion|journal=PENSAMIENTO|year=2007|volume=63|issue=238|pages=821–825|url=http://www.sp.upcomillas.es/sites/corporativo/Biblioteca%20de%20documentos21/Documents/G.%20Armengol%20-%20The%20Universe%20in%20a%20Single%20Atom%20according%20to%20the%20Dalai%20Lama.pdf|accessdate=2 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Scientists and Buddhists acknowledge that Buddhists use sensory perceptions and introspective thinking requiring cooperation of the body.&lt;ref name="Wallace Updated"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wallace|first=Alan|title=Response to George Johnson’s Review of The Universe in a Single Atom|journal=Santa Barbara Institute for Consciousness Studies|url=http://www.sbinstitute.com/sites/default/files/Response.pdf|accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In the 1980s, The Dalai Lama sought scientific advice from [[Francisco Varela]]. A product of the meeting was Varela's realization  that the act of medtiation through introspective thinking could complement science.&lt;ref name=Zajonc /&gt;

=== Quantum Physics and Buddhism ===

It should be noted that Buddhist teachings prove everything is changing and transitory. Essentially, thoughts come into our minds, then move on. Buddhists believe this is what causes suffering. The Dalai Lama believes in justifying the concept of micro-matter through the definition of inconsistent flow. The nature of a paradoxical reality mirrors the Buddhist philosophy of emptiness. Quantum physics debates the sustainability of having the notion of reality, as defined by Buddhist philosophy.&lt;ref name=Armengol /&gt;

=== Cosmology and Buddhism ===

One way Buddhists and scientists agree is their understanding of the Buddha's lack of explanation for the formation of the universe. However, Buddhist cosmologists have created the notion of a universe that has a form, expands and then is destructive. Both sides, science and Buddhist cosmologists, do not immediately resort to create a Godly being as the origin of all matter. Moreover, in Buddhism the universe is depicted as infinite and beginning less. The Dalai Lama wishes, in the book, to venture beyond [[the big bang]] and process thoughts about the possible structures and activity before the big bang.&lt;ref name=Murdoch&gt;{{cite journal|last=Murdoch|first=Hugh|title=The Universe in a Single Atom by The Dalai Lama|journal=The Theosophical Society in Australia|url=http://www.austheos.org.au/tsia-article-science-newsletter-universe-in-single-atom.html|accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Consciousness and Buddhism ===

According to [[Hugh Ross (Australian politician)|Dr. Hugh Murdoch]] of [[The Theosophical Society]] Australia, the concept of consciousness has been insignificantly proven through scientific study. The Dalai Lama asks the question for scientists, what about the direct observation of consciousness itself? The concept of consciousness was discussed by the Buddha who said the mind is paramount above all things. Buddhists believe in the concept of matter, mind, and mental states. The Dalai Lama wishes for scientists to quit questioning if consciousness is favored in dualism, or materialism and actually study through the first person perspective.&lt;ref name=Murdoch /&gt;

=== Genetics and Buddhism ===

Buddhists believe the primary purpose of life is to eliminate suffering. The Dalai Lama has no objection to [[cloning]], only if it is based in altruistic motivation. The Dalai Lama supports the [[human genome project]] because it shows the difference between different ethics is minimal at best.&lt;ref name=Murdoch /&gt;

== Critical reception ==

After closely analyzing ''The Universe in a Single Atom'', [[Michael Shermer]], publisher of ''[[Skeptic Magazine]]'',  concludes, " So I would caution both Christians and Buddhists alike: be careful what you wish for in this endeavor to unify science and religion-you may not like what you find."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shermer|first=Michael|title=Science Without Borders|url=http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?vid=7&amp;sid=14a33fdc-23f2-43e4-807f-f8989bd8fde0%40sessionmgr12&amp;hid=23&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=aph&amp;AN=20318575|publisher=Skeptic|accessdate=1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Arthur Zajonc]], president of the [[Mind and Life Institute]] states, "''The Universe in a Single Atom'' is an open-minded engagement between intellectual traditions, an engagement that enriches our shrinking planet."&lt;ref name=Zajonc&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zajonc|first=Arthur|title=The Universe in a Single Atom|journal=Physics Today|date=September 2006|volume=59|issue=9|pages=60–62|url=http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?sid=46500cf5-bff8-4683-9616-5f0b9b8926bb%40sessionmgr15&amp;vid=1&amp;hid=12&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=aph&amp;AN=22265404|accessdate=3 April 2013|doi=10.1063/1.2364250}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Critic Lisa Liquori states,"Though the Dalai Lama aims to reach a wide audience and offers a fair, nicely written, and thoughtful treatise, the subject matter will primarily appeal to spiritual types and to altruistic, ethical physicists and biologists.&lt;ref name=Liquori&gt;{{cite journal|last=Liquori|first=Lisa|title=The Universe in a Single Atom: The Convergence of Science and Spirituality|journal=Library Journal|year=2005|volume=130.16|pages=84–86|url=http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?sid=bedfe466-ee43-4e7a-bee4-6c4d7d06fb56%40sessionmgr10&amp;vid=1&amp;hid=12&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=aph&amp;AN=18485431|accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Seventh-day Adventism}}
'''Seventh-day Adventists''' believe that the [[spiritual gift]]s such as "speaking in tongues" are used to communicate the truth to other people from differing languages, and are skeptical of tongues as practiced by [[Charismatic movement|charismatic]] and [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] [[Christianity|Christians]] today. 

== Beliefs ==
Belief "17. Spiritual Gifts and Ministries" of the official [[28 Fundamentals|28 Fundamental Beliefs]] of Adventists affirms that [[spiritual gift]]s do [[continuationism|continue]] into the present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  | title = Fundamental Beliefs
  | publisher = Seventh-day Adventist Church
  | url = http://www.adventist.org/beliefs/fundamental/index.html
  | accessdate = 2008-08-18
}}. See "17. Spiritual Gifts and Ministries"&lt;/ref&gt; While the gift of tongues or "[[glossolalia]]" is not specifically mentioned, Adventists more often limit it to the ability to speak unlearned human languages, or "[[xenoglossy]]"; and have generally rejected the form of tongues practised by many charismatic and Pentecostal Christians, described as ecstatic speech or a "personal prayer language".&lt;ref&gt;Bacchiocchi concurs in ''End Time Issues'' #194 and #195 below&lt;/ref&gt; 

Supporting this position is [[Gerhard Hasel]], who believed the practice refers to unknown human languages only, and not angelic languages nor ecstatic speech.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gerhard Hasel]].

[[Ellen G. White]] wrote concerning this issue. She states...

{{Quotation|Some of these persons have exercises which they call gifts and say that the Lord has placed them in the church. They have an unmeaning gibberish which they call the unknown tongue, which is unknown not only by man but by the Lord and all heaven. Such gifts are manufactured by men and women, aided by the great deceiver. Fanaticism, false excitement, false talking in tongues, and noisy exercises have been considered gifts which God has placed in the church. Some have been deceived here. |''Testimonies for the Church Vol 1'', p. 412|}}

She also stated...
"They give themselves up to wild, excitable feelings and make unintelligible sounds which they call the gift of tongues, and a certain class seem to be charmed with these strange manifestations. A strange spirit rules with this class, which would bear down and run over anyone who would reprove them. God's Spirit is not in the work and does not attend such workmen. They have another spirit."&lt;ref&gt;''Testimonies'' vol. 1, p414 http://egwdatabase.whiteestate.org/nxt/gateway.dll/egw-comp/section00000.htm/book05499.htm/chapter05578.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Early Counterfeit Incidents in Adventistism ===

The first [[counterfeit]] instance in regards to a doctrine issue occurred in 1848. [[James Springer White|James White]] recorded the incident writing "There has been some division as to the time of beginning the Sabbath. Some commenced at sundown. Most, however, at 6 P.M. A week ago Sabbath we made this a subject of prayer. The Holy Ghost came down, Brother Chamberlain was filled with the power. In this state he cried out in an unknown tongue. The interpretation followed which was this: 'Give me the chalk, Give me the chalk.'  Well, thought I, if there is none in the house then I shall doubt this, but in a moment a brother took down a good piece of chalk. Brother Chamberlain took it and in the power he drew a figure on the floor."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whiteestate.org/issues/Charism-ALW.html#TONGUES%20IN%20EARLY%20SDA Charismatic experiences in early SDA history - subheading "Bible Study Versus Ecstatic Experiences" - Arthur White Page 6] &lt;/ref&gt;

Brother Chamberlain then gave his own interpretation to his unknown tongue and the drawing...

{{Quotation|This represents Jesus' words, 'Are there not twelve hours in the day?' This figure represents the day or the last half of the day. Daylight is half gone when the sun is south or halfway from each horizon, at 12 o'clock. Now go each way six hours and you will get the twelve-hour day. At any time of year the day ends at 6 P.M. Here is where the Sabbath begins at 6 P.M. Satan would get us from this time. But let us stand fast in the Sabbath as God has given it to us and Brother Bates.|Brother Chamberlain's words as recorded by James White - ''Letter to "My Dear Brother,"'' July 2, 1848, written from Berlin, Connecticut.|}}

This experience carried weight with the believers and they continued to observe the beginning of the Sabbath at six o'clock.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whiteestate.org/issues/Charism-ALW.html#TONGUES%20IN%20EARLY%20SDA Charismatic experiences in early SDA history - subheading "Bible Study Versus Ecstatic Experiences" - Arthur White Page 7] &lt;/ref&gt;
Later on, through a study of the Bible, this incident was later discovered as a [[counterfeit]] manifestation of the gift of tongues.  In the summer of 1855, [[James Springer White|James White]] urged [[J.N. Andrews]] to investigate the Sabbath commencement issue. After several weeks of a "careful investigation of the Scriptures, (he) demonstrated from nine texts in the Old Testament and two texts in the New that the Sabbath began at sundown.  Andrews' conclusions were read at the conference in Battle Creek, November, 1855, and, from the scriptural evidence set forth, those present accepted the responsibility of shifting from six o'clock to sundown as the time to begin the Sabbath." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whiteestate.org/issues/Charism-ALW.html#TONGUES%20IN%20EARLY%20SDA Charismatic experiences in early SDA history - subheading "Further Bible Study Urged" - Arthur White Page 7]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are four documented cases of people claiming to speak in tongues in the early [[History of the Seventh-day Adventist Church|history of the Adventist church]], according to [[Arthur L. White|Arthur White]]:&lt;ref name="TonguesEarly"&gt;{{cite journal

* The first was in 1847 when Brother Chamberlain claimed to interpret Brother Ralph's message in an unknown tongue.&lt;ref&gt;[[Affidavit]] signed by Mrs. S. Howland, Mrs. Frances Howland Lunt, Mrs. Rebeckah Howland Winslow and N. N. Lunt at [[Battle Creek, Michigan|Battle Creek]], [[Michigan]]. [[Ellen G. White Estate]] document file no. 311. As quoted by Arthur White&lt;/ref&gt;
* The second was in 1848 when Brother Chamberlain claimed to speak in an unknown tongue. (mentioned above)
* The third was in 1849, when Brother Ralph claimed to speak in a tongue, which was interpreted that S. W. Rhodes should be retrieved, so Ralph and [[Hiram Edson]] went. When they met him, Ralph again "spoke in a new tongue, and gave the interpretation in power".&lt;ref&gt;Hiram Edson, in ''[[Adventist Review|The Present Truth]]'' [http://www.adventistarchives.org/docs/PT-AR/PT-AR-Part1-05/index.djvu?djvuopts&amp;page=2 '''1''':6 (December 1849)] ([[DjVu]]), p35–36. [[Oswego, New York|Oswego]], [[New York (state)|New York]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The fourth claim was in 1851 at the church of East [[Bethel, Vermont|Bethel]], [[Vermont]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110522065059/http://www.adventistarchives.org/docs/RH/RH1851-V02-02/index.djvu?djvuopts&amp;page=7 Letter] (DjVu) to James White from [Ms.] F. M. Shimper on 30 July 1851. ''The Adventist Review and Sabbath Herald'' '''2''':2 (19 August 1851), p15&lt;/ref&gt;

Arthur White states "There is no record of Ellen White's giving explicit support to, or placing her endorsement upon, these ecstatic experiences with unknown tongues, although she was an eyewitness to three of the four." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whiteestate.org/issues/Charism-ALW.html#TONGUES%20IN%20EARLY%20SDA Charismatic experiences in early SDA history - subheading "Further Bible Study Urged" - Arthur White Page 8]&lt;/ref&gt;

There have also been other [[counterfeit]] claims. In June 1853 on her trip to [[Vergennes, Michigan|Vergennes]], [[Michigan]], Ellen White rebuked a certain "Mrs. A." who "professes to talk with tongues, but she is deceived.  She does not talk the language she claims to speak. In fact, she does not talk any language. If all the nations of the earth were together, and should hear her talk, no one of them would know what she says; for she merely goes over a lot of meaningless gibberish."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whiteestate.org/issues/Charism-ALW.html#TONGUES%20IN%20EARLY%20SDA Charismatic Experiences in Early Seventh-day Adventist History p. 9]&lt;/ref&gt; The woman claimed to speak the local [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|Native American language]].&lt;ref&gt;"[https://web.archive.org/web/20110522065104/http://www.adventistarchives.org/docs/RH/RH1884-24/index.djvu?djvuopts&amp;page=10 Recollections of the Past.–No. 7]" (DjVu) by [[John Norton Loughborough|J. N. Loughborough]]. ''Advent Review and Sabbath Herald'' '''61''':24 (10 June 1884), p378–79&lt;/ref&gt;

"At a meeting she held the next day, this woman spoke on the subject of holiness, and during her talk broke out again in the unknown tongue. An Indian who had been invited to come in to hear her speak his language jumped to his feet, declaring: "Very bad Indian that! Very bad Indian that!" When asked what the woman said, he declared: "Nothing; she talk no Indian."

A few days later in the presence of an Indian interpreter who knew 17 of the languages, she spoke and prayed in her gibberish, and he declared that she had not uttered a single Indian word. Her influence was short lived, not only because of this experience, but because of the disclosure (from one of Ellen White's visions) that the man with whom she traveled and lived was not her husband. This in time was confessed."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whiteestate.org/issues/Charism-ALW.html#TONGUES%20IN%20EARLY%20SDA Charismatic Experiences in Early Seventh-day Adventist History p. 8-9]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Later experiences ===
[[Ralph and Mrs. Mackin|Ralph Mackin and his wife]] claimed to experience gifts of the Holy Spirit such as prophecy, speaking in tongues, and even casting out demons. At an Adventist camp meeting in [[Mansfield, Ohio|Mansfield]], Ohio; they also claimed the gift of tongues, with Ralph speaking [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and his wife [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] as the result of a vision.&lt;ref&gt;''Daily Shield'' 22 August. Mansfield, Ohio. As quoted by Arthur White&lt;/ref&gt; Ellen White was cautious if not skeptical, and ultimately rebuked their testimony stating...

"I was shown that it was not the Spirit of the Lord that was inspiring Brother and Sister Mackin, but the same spirit of fanaticism that is ever seeking entrance into the remnant church. Their application of Scripture of their peculiar exercises is Scripture misapplied. The work of declaring persons possessed of the devil, and then praying with them and pretending to cast out the evil spirits, is fanaticism which will bring into disrepute any church which sanctions such work."&lt;ref name="MackinCalifornia"&gt;{{cite journal

She continues to state...

Pentecostal-turned-Adventist E. C. Card says he gave up speaking in tongues.&lt;ref&gt;Card, E. C. "[https://web.archive.org/web/20110522070447/http://www.adventistarchives.org/docs/RH/RH1974-05/index.djvu?djvuopts&amp;page=4 I gave up speaking in tongues]" Advent Review and Sabbath Herald 1974, v151, Jan 31, p4-5(120-121)&lt;/ref&gt; Howard Blum shared his perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Blum, Howard; "My experience with speaking in tongues" Advent Review and Sabbath Herald 1974, v151, Aug 1, p9-11(833-835)&lt;/ref&gt;

One website [http://www.a4t.org/Toolbox/alpha-omega.html article], part 2 - "A False Concept Of the Son" claims [[Demos Shakarian]] (1913–1993) and the FGBMFI held a meeting to distribute their ''Voice'' magazine to Adventist workers. It mentions Adventists Bill Loveless and Dr. Lowe. &lt;ref&gt;[http://jewel.andrews.edu:82/search/aLoveless+William authored by] and [http://jewel.andrews.edu:82/search/dLoveless+William concerning] a "William Loveless"; http://www.adventistarchives.org/docs/MIN/MIN2004-10/index.djvu?djvuopts&amp;page=5)&lt;/ref&gt; This was viewed with concern by Adventists, as one editor stated, "Already we have lost members to the delusions of this phenomenon. Some have been young people."&lt;ref&gt;"'Insight' Announces a Series on the Tongues Movement" by Michael A. Jones. ''Pacific Union Recorder'' 72:41 (April 16, 1973)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Australian administrator Gilbert Cangy reported receiving the gift of unlearned human languages ([[xenoglossy]]), when in the [[Vanuatu]]an island [[Ambrym]], local [[Bislama]] speakers understood his [[English language|English]] presentations.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://absg.adventist.org/2007/4Q/SE/PDFs/EAQ407_13.pdf#page=8 Surprised by the Spirit]" by Gilbert Cangy, in ''[[Adult Sabbath School Lesson]]'' 4th quarter (October-December) 2007 titled "The Refiner's Fire".

The ''1991 [[National Church Life Survey]]'' in [[Australia]] found that approximately 5% of Australian Adventists approve of and/or speak in tongues, whereas 11% have no opinion and approximately 85% disapprove. This was the highest disapproval rating amongst all denominations surveyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7015">'''Umbrella species''' are [[species]] selected for making [[wildlife conservation|conservation]]-related decisions, typically because protecting these species indirectly protects the many other species that make up the ecological [[community (ecology)|community]] of its [[habitat]]. Species conservation can be subjective because it is hard to determine the status of many species. With millions of species of concern, the identification of selected ''[[keystone species]]'', ''[[flagship species]]'' or ''umbrella species'' makes conservation decisions easier. Umbrella species can be used to help select the locations of potential reserves, find the minimum size of these conservation areas or reserves, and to determine the composition, structure and processes of ecosystems.&lt;ref name="ROBERGE2004"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Roberge | first=Jean-Michel | last2=Angelstam | first2=Per | title=Usefulness of the Umbrella Species Concept as a Conservation Tool | journal=Conservation Biology | volume=18 | issue=1 | year=2004 | doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2004.00450.x | pages=76–85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definitions ==

Two commonly used definitions are:

* "A wide-ranging species whose requirements include those of many other species"&lt;ref name="Groom 2006 p. "&gt;{{cite book | last=Groom | first=Martha | title=Principles of conservation biology | publisher=Sinauer Associates | year=2006 | isbn=978-0-87893-597-0 | oclc=70686894 | page= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A species with large area requirements for which protection of the species offers protection to other species that share the same habitat&lt;ref name="OzakiIsono2006"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ozaki |first1=Kenichi |last2=Isono |first2=Masahiro |last3=Kawahara |first3=Takayuki |last4=Iida |first4=Shigeo |last5=Kudo |first5=Takuma |last6=Fukuyama |first6=Kenji |title=A Mechanistic Approach to Evaluation of Umbrella Species as Conservation Surrogates|journal=Conservation Biology |volume=20 |issue=5 |year=2006 |pages=1507–1515 |doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2006.00444.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=NOAA |year=2007 |title=Glossary |url=http://www8.nos.noaa.gov/coris_glossary/index.aspx?letter=u |accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other descriptions include:
* "Traditional umbrella species, relatively large-bodied and wide-ranging species of higher vertebrates"&lt;ref name=Launer1994&gt;{{cite journal | last=Launer | first=Alan E. | last2=Murphy | first2=Dennis D. | title=Umbrella species and the conservation of habitat fragments: A case of a threatened butterfly and a vanishing grassland ecosystem | journal=Biological Conservation | volume=69 | issue=2 | year=1994 | doi=10.1016/0006-3207(94)90054-x | pages=145–153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In land use management ==

The use of umbrella species as a conservation tool is highly debated.  The term was first used by Wilcox (1984) &lt;ref&gt;Wilcox, Bruce A. 1984. "In situ conservation of genetic resources: Determinants of minimum area requirements." ''In National Parks, Conservation and Development, Proceedings of the World Congress on National Parks''. J.A. McNeely and K.R. Miller,  Smithsonian Institution Press, pp. 18–30.&lt;/ref&gt; who defined an umbrella species as one whose minimum area requirements are at least as comprehensive of the rest of the community for which protection is sought though the establishment and management of a protected area.

Some scientists have found that the [[umbrella effect (ecology)|umbrella effect]] provides a simpler way to manage ecological communities. Others feel that a combination of other tools establish better [[land management]] reserves to help protect more species than just using umbrella species alone. Individual invertebrate species can be good umbrella species because they can protect older, unique ecosystems. There have been cases where umbrella species have protected a large amount of area which has been beneficial to surrounding species. Dunk, Zielinski and Welsh (2006) reported that the reserves in Northern California (the Klamat h-Siskiyou forests), set aside for the [[northern spotted owl]], also protect [[mollusk]]s and [[salamander]]s within that habitat. They found that the reserves set aside for the northern spotted owl "serve as a reasonable coarse-filter umbrella species for the taxa evaluated", which were mollusks and salamanders.&lt;ref&gt;Dunk, Jeffrey R., William J. Zielinkski and Hartwell H. Walsh, Jr. 2006. "Evaluating reserves for species richness and representation in northern California." ''Diversity and Distributions'', Vol. 12, 434-442.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the Endangered Species Act (US) ==

The [[bay checkerspot butterfly]] has been on the [[Endangered Species List]] since 1987. Launer and Murphy (1994) tried to determine whether this butterfly could be considered an umbrella species in protecting the native grassland it inhabits.  They discovered that the [[Endangered Species Act]] has a loophole excluding federally protected plants on private property. However, the [[California Environmental Quality Act]] reinforces state conservation regulations.&lt;ref name=Launer1994/&gt; Using the Endangered Species Act to protect termed umbrella species and their habitats can be controversial because they are not as well enforced in some states as others (such as California) to protect overall [[biodiversity]].

== Examples ==

# [[Northern spotted owl]]s and [[old-growth forest]]: Molluscs and salamanders are within the protective boundaries of the northern spotted owl.
# [[Bay checkerspot butterfly]] and grasslands
# [[Siberian tiger|Amur tigers]] in the Russian Far East are considered umbrella/keystone species due to their impact on the deer and boar in their ecosystem&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Russia's Tough Tigers - National Zoo{{!}} FONZ|url=http://nationalzoo.si.edu/Publications/ZooGoer/2008/1/Amur_tigers.cfm|website=nationalzoo.si.edu|access-date=2016-02-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160220033557/http://nationalzoo.si.edu/publications/zoogoer/2008/1/amur_tigers.cfm|archivedate=2016-02-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12795">'''Value theory''' is a range of approaches to understanding how, why, and to what degree persons value things; whether the object or subject of valuing is a person, idea, object, or anything else.

This investigation began in ancient [[philosophy]], where it is called axiology or [[ethics]]. Early philosophical investigations sought to understand [[good and evil]] and the concept of "the good". Today, much of value theory aspires to the [[science|scientifically]] [[empirical]], recording what people do value and attempting to understand why they value it in the context of [[psychology]], [[sociology]], and [[economics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Detmer|title=Freedom as a Value: A Critique of the Ethical Theory of Jean-Paul Sartre|publisher=Open Court Publishing|year=1988|isbn=978-0812690835}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the general level, there is a difference between moral and natural goods. Moral goods are those that have to do with the conduct of persons, usually leading to praise or blame. Natural goods, on the other hand, have to do with objects, not persons. For example, the statement "Mary is a good person" uses 'good' very differently than in the statement "That is good food".

Ethics is mainly focused on moral goods rather than natural goods, while economics has a concern in what is economically good for the society but not an individual person and is also interested in natural goods. However, both moral and natural goods are equally relevant to goodness and value theory, which is more general in scope.

==Sociology==
{{Main|Value (personal and cultural)}}
In sociology, value theory is concerned with personal values which are popularly held by a community, and how those values might change under particular conditions. Different groups of people may hold or prioritize different kinds of values influencing social behavior.

Major Western theorists who stress the importance of values as an analytical independent variable include [[Max Weber]], [[Émile Durkheim]], [[Talcott Parsons]], and [[Jürgen Habermas]]. Classical examples of sociological traditions which deny or downplay the question of values are [[Historical institutionalism|institutionalism]], [[historical materialism]] (including Marxism), [[behaviorism]], pragmatic-oriented theories, [[postmodern philosophy]] and various objectivist-oriented theories.

Methods of study range from questionnaire surveys to participant observation.

==Economics==
{{Main|Theory of value (economics)}}
Economic analysis emphasizes goods sought in a market and tends to use the consumer's choices as evidence ([[revealed preference]]) that various products are of [[economic value]]. In this view, religious or political struggle over what "goods" are available in the marketplace is inevitable, and [[consensus]] on some core questions about body and society and ecosystems affected by the transaction, are outside the market's goods so long as they are unowned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Theory of Value: An Axiomatic Analysis of Economic Equilibrium|publisher=Cowles Foundation - Yale University|author=Debreu, G|year=1972|isbn=978-0300015591}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some natural goods seem to also be moral  goods. For example, those things that are owned by a person may be said to be natural goods, but over which a particular individual(s) may have moral claims. So it is necessary to make another distinction: between ''moral'' and ''non-moral goods''. A non-moral  good is something that is desirable for someone or other; despite the name to the contrary, it may include moral goods. A moral good is anything which an actor is considered to be morally obligated to strive toward.

When discussing non-moral goods, one may make a useful distinction between inherently serviced and material ''goods in'' the marketplace (or its [[exchange value]]), versus perceived intrinsic and experiential ''goods to'' the buyer. A strict [[service economy]] model takes pains to distinguish between the goods and service guarantees ''to the market'', and that of the service and experience ''to the consumer''.

Sometimes, moral and natural goods can conflict. The value of natural "goods" is challenged by such issues as [[Substance use disorder|addiction]]. The issue of addiction also brings up the distinction between economic and moral goods, where an economic good is whatever stimulates [[economic growth]]. For instance, some claim that [[cigarette]]s are a "good" in the economic sense, as their production can employ [[tobacco]] growers and doctors who treat [[lung cancer]]. Many people would agree that cigarette smoking is not ''morally'' "good", nor ''naturally'' "good," but still recognize that it is economically good, which means, it has exchange value, even though it may have a negative [[public good]] or even be bad for a person's body (not the same as "bad for the person" necessarily&amp;nbsp;– consider the issue of [[suicide]].) 

In [[ecological economics]] value theory is separated into two types: donor-type value and receiver-type value. Ecological economists tend to believe that 'real wealth' needs a donor-determined value as a measure of what things were needed to make an item or generate a service ([[H. T. Odum]], ''Environmental Accounting: Emergy and environmental decision-making'', 1996). An example of receiver-type value is 'market value', or 'willingness to pay', the principal method of accounting used in neo-classical economics.  In contrast, both [[Marx]]'s [[labour theory of value]] and the [[emergy]] concept are conceived as donor-type value. Emergy theorists believe that this conception of value has relevance to all of philosophy, economics, sociology and psychology as well as Environmental Science.

[[Silvio Gesell]] denied value theory in economics. He thought that value theory is useless and prevents economics from becoming science and that a currency administration guided by value theory is doomed to sterility and inactivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://biblio.wiki/wiki/The_Natural_Economic_Order/Part_III/Chapter_3|title=The Natural Economic Order/Part III/Chapter 3 - Bibliowiki|website=biblio.wiki}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethics and axiology==
{{Main|Value (ethics)}}

Intuitively, theories of value must be important to ethics. A number of useful distinctions have been made by philosophers in the treatment of value.

===Intrinsic and instrumental value===
{{Main|Instrumental and intrinsic value}}
Many people find it useful to distinguish ''[[instrumental value]]'' and ''[[intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic value]]s'', first discussed by [[Plato]] in the "Republic". An instrumental value is worth having as a means towards getting something else that is good (e.g., a radio is instrumentally good in order to hear music). An intrinsically valuable thing is worth having for itself, not as a means to something else. It is giving value [[intrinsic and extrinsic properties (philosophy)|intrinsic and extrinsic properties]].

Intrinsic and instrumental goods are not mutually exclusive categories. Some things are both good in themselves, and also good for getting other things that are good. "Understanding science" may be such a good, being both worthwhile in and of itself, and as a means of achieving other goods.

A prominent argument in [[environmental ethics]], made by writers like [[Aldo Leopold]] and [[Holmes Rolston III]], is that wild nature and healthy ecosystems have intrinsic value, prior to and apart from their instrumental value as resources for humans, and should therefore be preserved. This line of argument has been articulated further in recent years by Canadian philosopher [[John McMurtry]] within the ''[[Encyclopedia of Life Support Systems]]'' (http://www.eolss.net) published by [[UNESCO]].

===Pragmatism and contributory goodness===
{{Further|Pragmatic ethics}}

[[John Dewey]] (1859-1952), in his book ''Theory of Valuation'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Theory of Valuation |author=Dewey, J|year=1939|publisher=University of Chicago USA|isbn=978-0226575940}}&lt;/ref&gt; sees goodness as the outcome of [[ethic valuation]], a continuous balancing of "ends in view". An end in view is said to be an objective potentially adopted, which may be refined or rejected based on its consistency with other objectives or as a means to objectives already held.

Dewey's empiricist approach evinces [[absolute intrinsic value denial]]; i.e. not accepting intrinsic value as an inherent or enduring property of things. Instead, Dewey sees the appearance of intrinsic value as an illusory product of our continuous valuative activity as purposive beings. In addition to denying categorically that there is anything like intrinsic value, Dewey held the same position with regard to moral values - for Dewey, moral values are also based on a learning process, and are never intrinsic or absolute.

Another contribution of pragmatism to value theory is the idea of contributory goods with a [[contributory conditionality]]. These have the same qualities as the good thing, but need some emergent property of a whole state-of-affairs in order to be good. For example, salt is food on its own, but is far better as part of a prepared meal. In other words, such goods are only "good" when certain conditions are met. This is in contrast to other goods, which may be considered "good" in a wider variety of situations.

===Kant: hypothetical and categorical goods===
The thinking of [[Immanuel Kant]] greatly influenced [[moral philosophy]]. He thought of moral value as a unique and universally identifiable property, as an [[absolute value (philosophy)|absolute value]] rather than a [[Relative value (philosophy)|relative value]]. He showed that many practical goods are good only in states-of-affairs described by a sentence containing an "if" clause, e.g., in the sentence, "Sunshine is only good if you do not live in the desert." Further, the "if" clause often described the category in which the judgment was made (art, science, etc.). Kant described these as "hypothetical goods", and tried to find a "categorical" good that would operate across all categories of judgment without depending on an "if-then" clause.

An influential result of Kant's search was the idea of a ''good will'' being the only [[intrinsic good]]. Moreover, Kant saw a good will as acting in accordance with a moral command, the "[[Categorical Imperative]]": "Act according to those maxims that you could will to be universal law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Critique of Pure Reason|publisher=Macmillan|author= Immanuel Kant  &amp; Gary Banham (Authors) plus other contributors |date=1787–2007 |isbn=978-0230013384}}&lt;/ref&gt;" but should not be confused with the [[Ethic of Reciprocity]] or [[Golden Rule]], e.g. [http://bible.cc/matthew/7-12.htm Mt. 7:12]. Whereas the golden rule states that "One should treat others as one would like others to treat oneself," Kant asks us to analyze whether an act can be performed simultaneously by everyone without exception. For example, murder cannot be performed simultaneously by everyone, one set of people would have to live and the other die. That disparity is an exception. The act cannot be performed without exception, therefore it fails the categorical imperative. Contrast this with the golden rule which is subjective to the individual. Following the logic of the golden rule, if I wanted someone to kill me, then it would be acceptable for me to kill others, because I would be doing to others what I would want done to me. This is very important to keep in mind, because Kant's categorical imperative avoids this flaw. From this, and a few other axioms, Kant developed a moral system that would apply to any "praiseworthy person".&lt;ref name="Kant1786"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Kant|first=Immanuel|title=Groundlaying toward the Metaphysics of Morals}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kantian philosophers believe that any general definition of goodness must define goods that are categorical in the sense that Kant intended.

'''David Émile Durkheim''' ({{IPA-fr|emil dyʁkɛm|lang}} &lt;small&gt;or&lt;/small&gt; {{IPA-fr|dyʁkajm|}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ina.fr/art-et-culture/litterature/video/CPF86632054/claude-levi-strauss-3eme-partie.fr.html Vidéo Ina – Claude Lévi-Strauss : 3ème partie, Archives du XXème siècle – 23/06/1974]&lt;!--at 03:10 and 03:35--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 15 April 1858 – 15 November  1917) was a French [[sociologist]]. He formally established the academic discipline and—with [[W.&amp;nbsp;E.&amp;nbsp;B. Du Bois]], [[Karl Marx]] and [[Max Weber]]—is commonly cited as the principal architect of modern [[social science]].&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-107"&gt;{{harvp|Calhoun|2002|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6mq-H3EcUx8C&amp;pg=PA107 p. 107]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kim, Sung Ho (2007). "Max Weber". [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] (August 24, 2007 entry) http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/weber/ (Retrieved February 17, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of Durkheim's work was concerned with how societies could maintain their [[social integration|integrity and coherence]] in [[modernity]], an era in which traditional social and religious ties are no longer assumed, and in which new social [[institutions]] have come into being. His first major sociological work was ''[[The Division of Labour in Society]]'' (1893). In 1895, he published ''[[The Rules of Sociological Method]]'' and set up the first European department of sociology, becoming France's first professor of sociology.&lt;ref name="Allan_104"&gt;{{harvp|Allan|2005|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1898, he established the journal ''[[L'Année Sociologique]]''. Durkheim's seminal monograph, ''[[Suicide (book)|Suicide]]'' (1897), a study of [[suicide]] rates in Catholic and Protestant populations, pioneered modern [[social research]] and served to distinguish social science from [[psychology]] and [[political philosophy]]. ''[[The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life]]'' (1912) presented a theory of religion, comparing the social and cultural lives of aboriginal and modern societies.

Durkheim was also deeply preoccupied with the acceptance of sociology as a legitimate [[science]]. He refined the [[positivism]] originally set forth by [[Auguste Comte]], promoting what could be considered as a form of [[epistemological]] [[Philosophical realism|realism]], as well as the use of the [[hypothetico-deductive model]] in social science. For him, sociology was the science of [[institution]]s, if this term is understood in its broader meaning as "beliefs and modes of behaviour instituted by the collectivity"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Durkheim|1982|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its aim being to discover structural [[social fact]]s. Durkheim was a major proponent of [[structural functionalism]], a foundational perspective in both sociology and [[anthropology]]. In his view, social science should be purely [[holism|holistic]];&lt;ref name=socialfacts&gt;{{cite book|last=Durkheim|first=Émile|title=The Rules of Sociological Method|year=1895|page=14|quote=The first and most fundamental rule is: Consider social facts as things.}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is, sociology should study phenomena attributed to society at large, rather than being limited to the specific actions of individuals.

He remained a dominant force in French intellectual life until his death in 1917, presenting numerous lectures and published works on a variety of topics, including the [[sociology of knowledge]], [[morality]], [[social stratification]], [[Sociology of religion|religion]], [[Sociology of law|law]], [[Sociology of education|education]], and [[Deviance (sociology)|deviance]]. Durkheimian terms such as "[[collective consciousness]]" have since entered the popular lexicon.&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, George (Trans.) in Durkheim, Emile "The Division of Labour in Society" The Free Press, New York, 1993. p. ix&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Childhood and education===
Emile Durkheim was born in [[Épinal]] in [[Lorraine (region)|Lorraine]], the son of Mélanie (Isidor) and Moïse Durkheim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://durkheim.uchicago.edu/Biography.html|title=Emile Durkheim's Life and Works (1857–1917)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z61mk-BEEQ0C&amp;pg=PA21&amp;lpg=PA21&amp;dq=Melanie+Isidor+Durkheim&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=bU98vtiLej&amp;sig=6jlJjVgmF-UBV9oqj5U4itlIWHo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3x87VfKVGNPjsATcgoHIBA&amp;ved=0CBMQ6AEwAA|title=For Durkheim|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He came from a long line of devout [[French Jews]]; his father, grandfather, and great-grandfather had been [[rabbi]]s.&lt;ref name="Poggi_1"&gt;{{harvp|Poggi|2000|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began his education in a rabbinical school, but at an early age, he decided not to follow in his family's footsteps and switched schools.&lt;ref name="Poggi_1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-103"&gt;{{harvp|Calhoun|2002|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6mq-H3EcUx8C&amp;pg=PA103 p. 103]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Durkheim led a completely secular life. Much of his work was dedicated to demonstrating that religious phenomena stemmed from social rather than divine factors. While Durkheim chose not to follow in the family tradition, he did not sever ties with his family or with the Jewish community.&lt;ref name="Poggi_1"/&gt; Many of his most prominent collaborators and students were Jewish, and some were blood relations. [[Marcel Mauss]], a notable social anthropologist of the pre-war era, was his nephew.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-107"/&gt; One of his nieces was Claudette (née Raphael) Bloch, a marine biologist and mother of [[Maurice Bloch]], who became a noted anthropologist.

A precocious student, Durkheim entered the ''[[École Normale Supérieure]]'' (ENS) in 1879, at his third attempt.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-103"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Poggi|2000|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entering class that year was one of the most brilliant of the nineteenth century and many of his classmates, such as [[Jean Jaurès]] and [[Henri Bergson]], would go on to become major figures in France's intellectual history. At the ENS, Durkheim studied under the direction of [[Numa Denis Fustel de Coulanges]], a classicist with a social scientific outlook, and wrote his Latin [[dissertation]] on [[Charles de Secondat, baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Bottomore|Nisbet|1978|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, he read [[Auguste Comte]] and [[Herbert Spencer]]. Thus Durkheim became interested in a scientific approach to society very early on in his career.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-103"/&gt; This meant the first of many conflicts with the French academic system, which had no [[social science]] curriculum at the time. Durkheim found [[Humanities|humanistic studies]] uninteresting, turning his attention from [[psychology]] and [[philosophy]] to [[ethics]] and eventually, [[sociology]].&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-103"/&gt; He obtained his ''[[agrégation]]'' in philosophy in 1882, though finishing next to last in his graduating class owing to serious illness the year before.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lukes|1985|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The opportunity for Durkheim to receive a major academic appointment in Paris was inhibited by his approach to society. From 1882 to 1887 he taught philosophy at several provincial schools.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-104"&gt;{{harvp|Calhoun|2002|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6mq-H3EcUx8C&amp;pg=PA104 p. 104]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1885 he decided to leave for Germany, where for two years he studied sociology at the universities of [[University of Marburg|Marburg]], [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin]] and [[Leipzig University|Leipzig]].&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-104"/&gt; As Durkheim indicated in several essays, it was in Leipzig that he learned to appreciate the value of [[empiricism]] and its language of concrete, complex things, in sharp contrast to the more abstract, clear and simple ideas of the [[Cartesianism|Cartesian method]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Jones|Spiro|1995|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=vM5MgiPPlgcC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA148 p. 149]}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1886, as part of his doctoral [[dissertation]], he had completed the draft of his ''The Division of Labour in Society'', and was working towards establishing the new science of sociology.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-104"/&gt;

===Academic career===
[[File:Emile Durkheim, Le Socialisme maitrier.jpg|thumb|A collection of Durkheim's courses on the origins of socialism (1896), edited and published by his nephew, [[Marcel Mauss]], in 1928]]

Durkheim's period in Germany resulted in the publication of numerous articles on German social science and philosophy; Durkheim was particularly impressed by the work of [[Wilhelm Wundt]].&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-104"/&gt; Durkheim's articles gained recognition in France, and he received a teaching appointment in the [[University of Bordeaux]] in 1887, where he was to teach the university's first social science course.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-104"/&gt; His official title was ''Chargé d'un Cours de Science Sociale et de Pédagogie'' and thus he taught both [[pedagogy]] and sociology (the latter had never been taught in France before).&lt;ref name="Allan_104"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Poggi|2000|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The appointment of the social scientist to the mostly humanistic faculty was an important sign of the change of times, and also the growing importance and recognition of the social sciences.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-104"/&gt; From this position Durkheim helped reform the [[French school system]] and introduced the study of social science in its curriculum. However, his controversial beliefs that religion and morality could be explained in terms purely of social interaction earned him many critics.

Also in 1887, Durkheim married Louise Dreyfus. They would have two children, Marie and André.&lt;ref name="Allan_104"/&gt;

The 1890s were a period of remarkable creative output for Durkheim.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-104"/&gt; In 1893, he published ''[[The Division of Labour in Society]]'', his doctoral dissertation and fundamental statement of the nature of human society and [[evolution of society|its development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Poggi|2000|p=x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Durkheim's interest in [[social phenomena]] was spurred on by politics. France's defeat in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] led to the fall of the regime of [[Napoleon III]], which was then replaced by the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]]. This in turn resulted in a backlash against the new [[secularism|secular]] and [[republicanism|republican]] rule, as many people considered a vigorously [[nationalistic]] approach necessary to rejuvenate France's fading power. Durkheim, a Jew and a staunch supporter of the Third Republic with a sympathy towards socialism, was thus in the political minority, a situation that galvanized him politically. The [[Dreyfus affair]] of 1894 only strengthened his activist stance.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-105"&gt;{{harvp|Calhoun|2002|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6mq-H3EcUx8C&amp;pg=PA105 p. 105]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1895, he published ''[[The Rules of Sociological Method]]'',&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-104"/&gt; a [[manifesto]] stating what sociology is and how it ought to be done, and founded the first European department of sociology at the [[University of Bordeaux]]. In 1898, he founded ''[[L'Année Sociologique]]'', the first French social science journal.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-104"/&gt; Its aim was to publish and publicize the work of what was, by then, a growing number of students and collaborators (this is also the name used to refer to the group of students who developed his sociological program). In 1897, he published ''[[Suicide (book)|Suicide]]'', a [[case study]] that provided an example of what the sociological [[monograph]] might look like. Durkheim was one of the pioneers of the use of [[quantitative methods in criminology]] during his suicide case study.

By 1902, Durkheim had finally achieved his goal of attaining a prominent position in Paris when he became the [[professorship|chair]] of education at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]]. Durkheim aimed for the Parisian position earlier, but the Parisian faculty took longer to accept what some called "sociological imperialism" and admit social science to their curriculum.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-105"/&gt; He became a full professor (Professor of the Science of Education) there in 1906, and in 1913 he was named Chair in "Education and Sociology".&lt;ref name="Allan_104"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-105"/&gt; Because [[List of colleges and universities in France|French universities]] are technically institutions for training secondary school teachers, this position gave Durkheim considerable influence—his lectures were the only ones that were mandatory for the entire student body. Durkheim had much influence over the new generation of teachers; around that time he also served as an advisor to the [[Ministry of Education (France)|Ministry of Education]].&lt;ref name="Allan_104"/&gt; In 1912, he published his last major work, ''[[The Elementary Forms of The Religious Life]]''.

===Death===
[[File:Tomba emile durkheim.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Émile Durkheim's grave in Montparnasse Cemetery]]
The outbreak of World War I was to have a tragic effect on Durkheim's life. His [[Left-wing politics|leftism]] was always patriotic rather than internationalist—he sought a secular, rational form of French life. But the coming of the war and the inevitable nationalist [[propaganda]] that followed made it difficult to sustain this already nuanced position. While Durkheim actively worked to support his country in the war, his reluctance to give in to simplistic nationalist fervor (combined with his Jewish background) made him a natural target of the now-ascendant [[Politics of France#The Right|French Right]]. Even more seriously, the generations of students that Durkheim had trained were now being drafted to serve in the army, and many of them perished in the trenches. Finally, Durkheim's own son, André, died on the war front in December 1915—a loss from which Durkheim never recovered.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-105"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Allan_105"&gt;{{harvp|Allan|2005|p=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emotionally devastated, Durkheim collapsed of a [[stroke]] in Paris on November 15, 1917.&lt;ref name="Allan_105"/&gt; He was buried at the [[Montparnasse Cemetery]] in Paris.&lt;ref name=Pickering&gt;{{harvp|Pickering|2012|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=gUl5F0uLrkUC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq=%C3%89mile+Durkheim+Cimeti%C3%A8re+de+Montparnasse&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCcQuwUwAWoVChMIsdXQ0OzvxwIVgQ-SCh0SxwMj#v=onepage&amp;q=%C3%89mile%20Durkheim%20Cimeti%C3%A8re%20de%20Montparnasse&amp;f=false p. 11]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Durkheim's thought==
Throughout his career, Durkheim was concerned primarily with three goals. First, to establish sociology as a new academic discipline.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-105"/&gt; Second, to analyse how societies could maintain their integrity and coherence in the modern era, when things such as shared religious and ethnic background could no longer be assumed; to that end he wrote much about the effect of laws, religion, education and similar forces on society and [[social integration]].&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-105"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Allan_102"&gt;{{harvp|Allan|2005|p=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, Durkheim was concerned with the practical implications of scientific knowledge.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-105"/&gt; The importance of social integration is expressed throughout Durkheim's work:

{{Quote|For if society lacks the unity that derives from the fact that the relationships between its parts are exactly regulated, that unity resulting from the harmonious articulation of its various functions assured by effective discipline and if, in addition, society lacks the unity based upon the commitment of men's wills to a common objective, then it is no more than a pile of sand that the least jolt or the slightest puff will suffice to scatter.|Émile Durkheim&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Allan|2005|p=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Inspirations===
During his university studies at the École, Durkheim was influenced by two [[neo-Kantian]] scholars, [[Charles Bernard Renouvier]] and [[Émile Boutroux]].&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-103"/&gt; The principles Durkheim absorbed from them included [[rationalism]], scientific study of morality, anti-[[utilitarianism]] and secular education.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-104"/&gt; His methodology was influenced by [[Numa Denis Fustel de Coulanges]], a supporter of the [[scientific method]].&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-104"/&gt;

A fundamental influence on Durkheim's thought was the [[sociological positivism]] of [[Auguste Comte]], who effectively sought to extend and apply the [[scientific method]] found in the [[natural science]]s to the [[social science]]s.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-104"/&gt; According to Comte, a true social science should stress for empirical facts, as well as [[Inductive reasoning|induce]] general [[scientific law]]s from the relationship among these facts. There were many points on which Durkheim agreed with the positivist thesis. First, he accepted that the study of society was to be founded on an examination of facts. Second, like Comte, he acknowledged that the only valid guide to objective knowledge was the scientific method. Third, he agreed with Comte that the social sciences could become scientific only when they were stripped of their [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] abstractions and philosophical speculation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Morrison|2006|p=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Durkheim believed that Comte was still too philosophical in his outlook.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-104"/&gt;

A second influence on Durkheim's view of society beyond Comte's positivism was the [[Epistemology|epistemological]] outlook called social [[scientific realism|realism]]. Although he never explicitly exposed it, Durkheim adopted a realist perspective in order to demonstrate the existence of social realities outside the individual and to show that these realities existed in the form of the objective relations of society.&lt;ref name="Morrison_152"&gt;{{harvp|Morrison|2006|p=152}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an epistemology of science, realism can be defined as a perspective that takes as its central point of departure the view that external social realities exist in the outer world and that these realities are independent of the [[subjectivity|individual's perception]] of them. This view opposes other predominant philosophical perspectives such as [[empiricism]] and [[positivism]]. Empiricists such as [[David Hume]] had argued that all realities in the outside world are products of human sense perception. According to empiricists, all realities are thus merely perceived: they do not exist independently of our perceptions, and have no causal power in themselves.&lt;ref name="Morrison_152"/&gt; Comte's positivism went a step further by claiming that scientific laws could be deduced from empirical observations. Going beyond this, Durkheim claimed that sociology would not only discover "apparent" laws, but would be able to discover the ''inherent nature'' of society.

Scholars also debate the exact influence of Jewish thought on Durkheim's work. The answer remains uncertain; some scholars have argued that Durkheim's thought is a form of [[Secular Jewish culture|secularized Jewish thought]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Strenski|1997|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=nyneB7F0m0sC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s pp. 1–2]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Meštrović|1993|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=lqGUxDs3K_UC&amp;pg=PA37#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false p. 37]}}: "While Durkheim did not become a Rabbi, he may have transformed his father's philosophical and moral concerns into something new, his version of sociology."&lt;/ref&gt; while others argue that proving the existence of a direct influence of Jewish thought on Durkheim's achievements is difficult or impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Pickering|2001|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=amP-MyZAL-cC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s p. 79]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Establishing sociology===
Durkheim authored some of the most programmatic statements on what sociology is and how it should be practiced.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-103"/&gt; His concern was to establish sociology as a science.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Popolo|2011|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=vMALg_p5zHsC&amp;pg=PA97 pp. 97–]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arguing for a place for sociology among other sciences he wrote:
{{quote|Sociology is, then, not an auxiliary of any other science; it is itself a distinct and autonomous science.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Brinton|Nee|2001|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=71e_jsQpzg0C&amp;pg=PR11 pp. 11–]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

To give sociology a place in the academic world and to ensure that it is a legitimate science, it must have an object that is clear and distinct from philosophy or psychology, and its own [[methodology]].&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-105"/&gt; He argued, "There is in every society a certain group of phenomena which may be differentiated from ....those studied by the other natural sciences."&lt;ref name="AppelrouthEdles2007"&gt;{{harvp|Durkheim|2007|pp=101–102, 95–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A fundamental aim of sociology is to discover structural "[[social fact]]s".&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-105"/&gt;&lt;ref name="socialfact"&gt;Durkheim, Émile [1895] "The Rules of Sociological Method" 8th edition, trans. Sarah A. Solovay and John M. Mueller, ed. George E. G. Catlin (1938, 1964 edition), pp. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Establishment of sociology as an independent, recognized academic discipline is amongst Durkheim's largest and most lasting legacies.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-107"/&gt; Within sociology, his work has significantly influenced structuralism or [[structural functionalism]].&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-107"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Allan_103"&gt;{{harvp|Allan|2005|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars inspired by Durkheim include [[Marcel Mauss]], [[Maurice Halbwachs]], [[Célestin Bouglé]], [[Alfred Radcliffe-Brown]], [[Talcott Parsons]], [[Robert K. Merton]], [[Jean Piaget]], [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], [[Michel Foucault]], [[Clifford Geertz]], [[Peter L. Berger|Peter Berger]], [[Robert N. Bellah]], social reformer [[Patrick Hunout]] and others.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-107"/&gt;

===Methodology===
[[File:The Rules of the Sociological Method.jpg|thumb|right|Cover of the French edition of ''[[The Rules of Sociological Method]]'' (1919)]]
In ''[[The Rules of Sociological Method]]'' (1895), Durkheim expressed his will to establish a [[Scientific method|method]] that would guarantee sociology's truly scientific character. One of the questions raised by the author concerns the [[Objectivity (science)|objectivity]] of the sociologist: how may one study an object that, from the very beginning, conditions and relates to the observer? According to Durkheim, [[observation]] must be as impartial and impersonal as possible, even though a "perfectly objective observation" in this sense may never be attained. A social fact must always be studied according to its [[Social relation|relation]] with other social facts, never according to the individual who studies it. Sociology should therefore privilege [[Comparative method|comparison]] rather than the study of singular independent facts.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Collins|1975|p=539}}: "Durkheim was the first to seriously use the comparative method correctly in the scientific sense".&lt;/ref&gt;

Durkheim sought to create one of the first rigorous scientific approaches to social phenomena. Along with [[Herbert Spencer]], he was one of the first people to explain the existence and quality of different parts of a society by reference to what function they served in maintaining the quotidian (i.e. by how they make society "work"). He also agreed with Spencer's [[organicism|organic analogy]], comparing society to a living organism.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-104"/&gt; Thus his work is sometimes seen as a precursor to [[Structural functionalism|functionalism]].&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-103"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Hayward|1960a}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Hayward|1960b}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Thompson|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Durkheim also insisted that society was [[Holism|more than the sum of its parts]].&lt;ref&gt;"Science cannot describe individuals, but only types. If human societies cannot be classified, they must remain inaccessible to scientific description." – Cf. Durkheim, Émile [1892] "Montesquieu's Contribution to the Rise of Social Science" in Montesquieu and Rousseau. Forerunners of Sociology and other stuff, trans. Ralph Manheim (1960), p.9&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike his contemporaries [[Ferdinand Tönnies]] and [[Max Weber]], he did not focus on what motivates the actions of individuals (an approach associated with [[methodological individualism]]), but rather on the study of ''[[social facts]]''.

===Social facts===
{{Main|Social fact}}

{{quote|A social fact is every way of acting, fixed or not, capable of exercising on the individual an external constraint; or again, every way of acting which is general throughout a given society, while at the same time existing in its own right independent of its individual manifestations.|Émile Durkheim, ''The Rules of Sociological Method''&lt;ref name="socialfact" /&gt;}}

Durkheim's work revolved around the study of social facts, a term he coined to describe phenomena that have an existence in and of themselves, are not bound to the actions of individuals, but have a coercive influence upon them.&lt;ref name="Allan_105"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Allan_106"&gt;{{harvp|Allan|2005|p=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; Durkheim argued that social facts have, ''[[sui generis]]'', an independent existence greater and more objective than the actions of the individuals that compose society.&lt;ref name="Allan_106"/&gt; Only such social facts can explain the observed social phenomena.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-103"/&gt; Being exterior to the individual person, social facts may thus also exercise [[Social control|coercive power]] on the various people composing society, as it can sometimes be observed in the case of formal laws and regulations, but also in situations implying the presence of informal rules, such as religious rituals or family norms.&lt;ref name="Durkheim_1994_433"&gt;{{harvp|Durkheim|1994|p=433}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the facts studied in [[natural science]]s, a "social" fact thus refers to a specific category of phenomena:

{{quote|The determining cause of a social fact must be sought among the antecedent social facts and not among the states of the individual consciousness.|Émile Durkheim, ''The Rules of Sociological Method''&lt;ref name="socialfact" /&gt;}}

Such social facts are endowed with a power of coercion, by reason of which they may control individual behaviors.&lt;ref name="Durkheim_1994_433"/&gt; According to Durkheim, these phenomena cannot be reduced to [[biology|biological]] or [[psychology|psychological]] grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Durkheim|1994|p=434}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social facts can be material (physical objects) or immaterial (meanings, sentiments, etc.).&lt;ref name="Allan_106"/&gt; The latter cannot be seen or touched, but they are external and coercive, and as such, they become real, gain "facticity".&lt;ref name="Allan_106"/&gt; Physical objects can represent both material and immaterial social facts; for example a flag is a physical social fact that often has various immaterial social facts (the meaning and importance of the flag) attached to it.&lt;ref name="Allan_106"/&gt;

Many social facts, however, have no material form.&lt;ref name="Allan_106"/&gt; Even the most "individualistic" or "subjective" phenomena, such as love, freedom or suicide, would be regarded by Durkheim as objective social facts.&lt;ref name="Allan_106"/&gt; Individuals composing society do not directly cause suicide: suicide, as a social fact, exists independently in society, and is caused by other social facts (such as rules governing [[behavior]] and group attachment), whether an individual likes it or not.&lt;ref name="Allan_106"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Allan|2005|p=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether a person "leaves" a society does not alter the ''fact'' that this society will ''still contain'' suicides. Suicide, like other immaterial social facts, exists independently of the will of an individual, cannot be eliminated, and is as influential – coercive – as physical laws such as gravity.&lt;ref name="Allan_106"/&gt; Sociology's task thus consists of discovering the qualities and characteristics of such social facts, which can be discovered through a [[Quantitative research|quantitative]] or experimental approach (Durkheim extensively relied on [[Social statistics|statistics]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Hassard|1995|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=EjI6Rd-NreYC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP13&amp;dq=Durkheim+suicide+sociological+positivism&amp;ots=764qjcztaG&amp;sig=YOVkvTMvWDpq2FIYgf0v7TR_JFw#PPA15,M1 p. 15]}}: "Suicide [...] is indeed the paradigm case of Durkheim's positivism: it remains the exemplar of the sociological application of statistics."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Society, collective consciousness and culture===
[[File:Emile Durkheim, Division du travail social maitrier.jpg|thumb|right|Cover of the French edition of ''The Division of Labour in Society]]Regarding the society itself, like [[social institution]]s in general, Durkheim saw it as a set of social facts.&lt;ref name="Allan_102" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Allan_103" /&gt; Even more than "what society is", Durkheim was interested in answering "how is a society created" and "what holds a society together". In ''[[The Division of Labour in Society]]'', Durkheim attempted to answer the question of what holds the society together.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-106"&gt;{{harvp|Calhoun|2002|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6mq-H3EcUx8C&amp;pg=PA106 p. 106]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He assumes that humans are inherently [[Egotism|egoistic]], but [[norm (sociology)|norms]], [[belief]]s and [[value (ethics)|values]] ([[collective consciousness]]) form the moral basis of the society, resulting in [[social integration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Allan|2005|pp=102, 137}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collective consciousness is of key importance to the society, its requisite function without which the society cannot survive.&lt;ref name="Allan_108"&gt;{{harvp|Allan|2005|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collective consciousness produces the society and holds it together, and at the same time individuals produce collective consciousness through their interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Allan|2005|pp=112, 137}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through collective consciousness human beings become aware of one another as social beings, not just animals.&lt;ref name="Allan_108" /&gt;

{{quote|The totality of beliefs and sentiments common to the average members of a society forms a determinate system with a life of its own. It can be termed the collective or common consciousness.|Emile Durkheim&lt;ref name="Allan_108"/&gt;}}

In particular, the [[emotion]]al part of the collective consciousness overrides our [[egoism]]: as we are emotionally bound to [[culture]], we act socially because we recognize it is the responsible, moral way to act.&lt;ref name="Allan_109"&gt;{{harvp|Allan|2005|p=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; A key to forming society is [[social interaction]], and Durkheim believes that human beings, when in a group, will inevitably act in such a way that a society is formed.&lt;ref name="Allan_109"/&gt;

The importance of another key social fact: the [[culture]].&lt;ref name="Allan_110"&gt;{{harvp|Allan|2005|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; Groups, when interacting, create their own culture and attach powerful emotions to it.&lt;ref name="Allan_110"/&gt; He was one of the first scholars to consider the question of culture so intensely.&lt;ref name="Allan_103"/&gt; Durkheim was interested in [[cultural diversity]], and how the existence of diversity nonetheless fails to destroy a society.&lt;ref name="Allan_111"&gt;{{harvp|Allan|2005|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; To that, Durkheim answered that any apparent cultural diversity is overridden by a larger, common, and more generalized cultural system, and the [[law]].&lt;ref name="Allan_111"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Allan|2005|p=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [[socioevolutionary]] approach, Durkheim described the evolution of societies from [[mechanical solidarity]] to [[organic solidarity]] (one rising from mutual need).&lt;ref name="Allan_103"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-106"/&gt;&lt;ref name="psz500"&gt;{{harvp|Sztompka|2002|p=500}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Allan_125"&gt;{{harvp|Allan|2005|p=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the societies become more complex, evolving from mechanical to organic solidarity, the [[division of labour]] is counteracting and replacing collective consciousness.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-106"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Allan_137"&gt;{{harvp|Allan|2005|p=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the simpler societies, people are connected to others due to personal ties and traditions; in the larger, modern society they are connected due to increased reliance on others with regard to them performing their specialized tasks needed for the modern, highly complex society to survive.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-106"/&gt; In mechanical solidarity, people are self-sufficient, there is little integration and thus there is the need for use of force and repression to keep society together.&lt;ref name=psz500/&gt; Also, in such societies, people have much fewer options in life.&lt;ref name="Allan_123"&gt;{{harvp|Allan|2005|p=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; In organic solidarity, people are much more integrated and interdependent and specialisation and cooperation is extensive.&lt;ref name=psz500/&gt; Progress from mechanical to organic solidarity is based first on [[population growth]] and increasing [[population density]], second on increasing "morality density" (development of more complex [[social interaction]]s) and thirdly, on the increasing specialisation in workplace.&lt;ref name=psz500/&gt; One of the ways mechanical and organic societies differ is the function of law: in mechanical society the law is focused on its [[punishment|punitive]] aspect, and aims to reinforce the cohesion of the community, often by making the punishment public and extreme; whereas in the organic society the law focuses on repairing the damage done and is more focused on individuals than the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Allan|2005|pp=123, 124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the main features of the modern, organic society is the importance, [[sacred]]ness even, given to the concept – social fact – of the [[individual]].&lt;ref name="Allan_132-133"&gt;{{harvp|Allan|2005|pp=132–133}}&lt;/ref&gt; The individual, rather than the collective, becomes the focus of rights and responsibilities, the center of public and private rituals holding the society together – a function once performed by the religion.&lt;ref name="Allan_132-133"/&gt; To stress the importance of this concept, Durkheim talked of the "cult of the individual":

{{Quote|Thus very far from there being the antagonism between the individual and society which is often claimed, moral individualism, the cult of the individual, is in fact the product of society itself. It is society that instituted it and made of man the god whose servant it is.|Émile Durkheim&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Durkheim|2009|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=pmg_Zp-IMB0C&amp;pg=PA29 pp. 29–]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Durkheim saw the [[population density]] and [[population growth|growth]] as key factors in the evolution of the societies and advent of [[modernity]].&lt;ref name="Allan_125"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Allan_134"&gt;{{harvp|Allan|2005|p=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the number of people in a given area increase, so does the number of interactions, and the society becomes more complex.&lt;ref name="Allan_125"/&gt; Growing [[competition]] between the more numerous people also leads to further division of labour.&lt;ref name="Allan_125"/&gt; In time, the importance of the state, the law and the individual increases, while that of the religion and moral solidarity decreases.&lt;ref name="Allan_134"/&gt;

In another example of evolution of culture, Durkheim pointed to [[fashion]], although in this case he noted a more [[social cycle|cyclical]] phenomenon.&lt;ref name="Allan_113"&gt;{{harvp|Allan|2005|p=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Durkheim, fashion serves to differentiate between [[Working class|lower classes]] and [[upper class]]es, but because lower classes want to look like the upper classes, they will eventually adapt the upper class fashion, depreciating it, and forcing the upper class to adopt a new fashion.&lt;ref name="Allan_113"/&gt;

===Social pathologies and crime===
As the society, Durkheim noted there are several possible [[pathology|pathologies]] that could lead to a breakdown of [[social integration]] and disintegration of the society: the two most important ones are [[anomie]] and forced division of labour; lesser ones include the lack of coordination and suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Allan|2005|pp=128, 130}}&lt;/ref&gt; By anomie Durkheim means a state when too rapid population growth reduces the amount of interaction between various groups, which in turn leads to a breakdown of understanding (norms, values, and so on).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Allan|2005|p=128, 129, 137}}&lt;/ref&gt; By forced division of labour Durkheim means a situation where power holders, driven by their desire for [[Profit (economics)|profit]] ([[greed]]), results in people doing the work they are unsuited for.&lt;ref name="Allan_129"&gt;{{harvp|Allan|2005|p=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such people are unhappy, and their desire to change the system can destabilize the society.&lt;ref name="Allan_129"/&gt;

Durkheim's views on crime were a departure from conventional notions. He believed that crime is "bound up with the fundamental conditions of all [[social relation|social life]]" and serves a social function.&lt;ref name="AppelrouthEdles2007"/&gt; He stated that crime implies "not only that the way remains open to necessary changes but that in certain cases it directly prepares these changes".&lt;ref name="AppelrouthEdles2007"/&gt; Examining the [[trial of Socrates]], he argues that "his crime, namely, the independence of his thought, rendered a service not only to humanity but to his country" as "it served to prepare a new morality and faith that the Athenians needed".&lt;ref name="AppelrouthEdles2007"/&gt; As such, his crime "was a useful prelude to reforms".&lt;ref name="AppelrouthEdles2007"/&gt; In this sense, he saw crime as being able to release certain social tensions and so have a cleansing or purging effect in society. He further stated that "the authority which the moral [[conscience]] enjoys must not be excessive; otherwise, no-one would dare to criticize it, and it would too easily congeal into an immutable form. To make progress, individual originality must be able to express itself...[even] the originality of the criminal... shall also be possible".&lt;ref name="AppelrouthEdles2007"/&gt;

====Suicide====
{{main|Suicide (book)}}
In ''[[Suicide (book)|Suicide]]'' (1897), Durkheim explores the differing suicide rates among [[Protestantism|Protestants]] and Catholics, arguing that stronger [[social control]] among Catholics results in lower suicide rates. According to Durkheim, Catholic society has normal levels of [[social integration|integration]] while Protestant society has low levels. Overall, Durkheim treated [[suicide]] as a [[social fact]], explaining variations in its rate on a macro level, considering society-scale phenomena such as lack of connections between people (group attachment) and lack of regulations of behavior, rather than individuals' feelings and motivations.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-106"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Allan|2005|p=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Durkheim believed there was more to suicide than extremely personal individual life circumstances: for example, a loss of a job, divorce, or bankruptcy. Instead, he took suicide and explained it as a social fact instead of a result of one’s circumstances. Durkheim believed that suicide was an instance of social deviance. Social deviance being any transgression of socially established norms. He created a normative theory of suicide focusing on the conditions of group life. The four different types of suicide that he proposed are egoistic, altruistic, anomic, and fatalistic. He began by plotting social regulation on the x-axis of his chart, and social integration on the y-axis. Egoistic suicide corresponds to a low level of social integration. When one is not well integrated into a social group it can lead to a feeling that he or she has not made a difference in anyone’s lives. On the other hand, too much social integration would be altruistic suicide. This occurs when a group dominates the life of an individual to a degree where they feel meaningless to society. Anomic suicide occurs when one has an insufficient amount of social regulation. This stems from the sociological term anomie meaning a sense of aimlessness or despair that arises from the inability to reasonably expect life to be predictable. Lastly, there is fatalistic suicide, which results from too much social regulation. An example of this would be when one follows the same routine day after day. This leads to he or she believing there is nothing good to look forward to. Durkheim suggested this was the most popular form of suicide for prisoners.

This study has been extensively discussed by later scholars and several major criticisms have emerged. First, Durkheim took most of his data from earlier researchers, notably [[Adolph Wagner]] and [[Henry Morselli]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Stark|Bainbridge|1996|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=lm0DLM_T8zsC&amp;pg=PA32 p. 32]}}&lt;/ref&gt; who were much more careful in generalizing from their own data. Second, later researchers found that the Protestant–Catholic differences in suicide seemed to be limited to [[German-speaking Europe]] and thus may have always been the spurious reflection of other factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Pope|Danigelis|1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; Durkheim's study of suicide has been criticized as an example of the [[Fallacy|logical error]] termed the [[ecological fallacy]].&lt;ref&gt;Freedman, David A. 2002. ''The Ecological Fallacy''. University of California. [http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~census/ecofall.txt]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Selvin|1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, diverging views have contested whether Durkheim's work really contained an ecological fallacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|van Poppel|Day|1996|p=500}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent authors such as Berk (2006) have also questioned the [[Structure and agency|micro–macro relations]] underlying Durkheim's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Berk|2006|pp=78–79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some, such as Inkeles (1959),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Inkeles|1959}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson (1965)&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Johnson|1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Gibbs (1968),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Gibbs|Martin|1958}}&lt;/ref&gt; have claimed that Durkheim's only intent was to explain suicide ''sociologically'' within a [[holism|holistic]] perspective, emphasizing that "he intended his theory to explain variation among [[social environment]]s in the incidence of suicide, not the suicides of particular individuals".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Berk|2006|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite its limitations, Durkheim's work on suicide has influenced proponents of [[Control theory (sociology)|control theory]], and is often mentioned as a classic sociological study. The book pioneered modern [[social research]] and served to distinguish social science from [[psychology]] and [[political philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Poggi|2000|loc=Chapter 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
In ''[[The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life]]'', Durkheim's first purpose was to identify the social origin and function of religion as he felt that religion was a source of camaraderie and solidarity.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-106"/&gt; His second purpose was to identify links between certain religions in different cultures, finding a common denominator. He wanted to understand the empirical, social aspect of religion that is common to all religions and goes beyond the concepts of [[spirituality]] and [[God]].&lt;ref name="Allan_112"&gt;{{harvp|Allan|2005|p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Durkheim defined religion as

{{quote|A religion is a unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things, i.e., things set apart and forbidden—beliefs and practices which unite in one single [[moral community]] called a [[Church body|Church]], all those who adhere to them.|Émile Durkheim, ''The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life'', Book 1, Ch. 1&lt;ref name="Allan_115"&gt;{{harvp|Allan|2005|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In this definition, Durkheim avoids references to [[supernatural]] or God.&lt;ref name="Allan_115"/&gt; Durkheim argued that the concept of supernatural is relatively new, tied to the development of science and separation of supernatural—that which cannot be rationally explained—from natural, that which can.&lt;ref name="Allan_116"&gt;{{harvp|Allan|2005|p=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, according to Durkheim, for early humans, everything was supernatural.&lt;ref name="Allan_116"/&gt; Similarly, he points out that religions that give little importance to the concept of god exist, such as [[Buddhism]], where the [[Four Noble Truths]] are much more important than any individual deity.&lt;ref name="Allan_116"/&gt; With that, Durkheim argues, we are left with the following three concepts: the [[sacred]] (the ideas that cannot be properly explained, inspire awe and are considered worthy of spiritual respect or devotion), the [[belief]]s and [[ritual|practices]] (which create highly emotional state—[[collective effervescence]]—and invest symbols with sacred importance), and the [[moral community]] (a group of people sharing a common [[moral philosophy]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Allan|2005|pp=116, 118, 120, 137}}&lt;/ref&gt; Out of those three concepts, Durkheim focused on the sacred, noting that it is at the very core of a religion.&lt;ref name="Allan_116"/&gt; He defined sacred things as:

{{quote|...simply collective ideals that have fixed themselves on material objects... they are only collective forces hypostasized, that is to say, moral forces; they are made up of the ideas and sentiments awakened in us by the spectacle of society, and not of sensations coming from the physical world.|Émile Durkheim&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lukes|1985|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Durkheim saw religion as the most fundamental [[social institution]] of humankind, and one that gave rise to other social forms.&lt;ref name="Allan_113"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Allan_112"/&gt; It was the religion that gave humanity the strongest sense of [[collective consciousness]].&lt;ref name="Allan_114"&gt;{{harvp|Allan|2005|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Durkheim saw the religion as a force that emerged in the early [[hunter and gatherer]] societies, as the emotions collective effervescence run high in the growing groups, forcing them to act in a new ways, and giving them a sense of some hidden force driving them.&lt;ref name="Allan_137"/&gt; Over time, as emotions became symbolized and interactions ritualized, religion became more organized, giving a rise to the division between the sacred and the profane.&lt;ref name="Allan_137"/&gt; However, Durkheim also believed that [[religion]] was becoming less important, as it was being gradually superseded by [[science]] and the cult of an individual.&lt;ref name="Allan_132-133"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Allan_112"/&gt;

{{quote|Thus there is something eternal in religion that is destined to outlive the succession of particular symbols in which religious thought has clothed itself.|Émile Durkheim&lt;ref name="Allan_134"/&gt;}}

However, even if the religion was losing its importance for Durkheim, it still laid the foundation of modern society and the interactions that governed it.&lt;ref name="Allan_114"/&gt; And despite the advent of alternative forces, Durkheim argued that no replacement for the force of religion had yet been created. He expressed his doubt about modernity, seeing the modern times as "a period of transition and moral mediocrity".&lt;ref name="Allan_134"/&gt;

Durkheim also argued that our primary categories for understanding the world have their origins in religion.&lt;ref name="Allan_113"/&gt; It is religion, Durkheim writes, that gave rise to most if not all other social constructs, including the larger society.&lt;ref name="Allan_114"/&gt; Durkheim argued that categories are produced by the society, and thus are collective creations.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-106"/&gt; Thus as people create societies, they also create categories, but at the same time, they do so unconsciously, and the categories are prior to any individual's experience.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-106"/&gt; In this way Durkheim attempted to bridge the divide between seeing [[category of being|categories]] as constructed out of human experience and as logically prior to that experience.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-106"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|McKinnon|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Our understanding of the world is shaped by [[social facts]]; for example the notion of [[time]] is defined by being measured through a [[calendar]], which in turn was created to allow us to keep track of our social gatherings and rituals; those in turn on their most basic level originated from religion.&lt;ref name="Allan_114"/&gt; In the end, even the most logical and rational pursuit of science can trace its origins to religion.&lt;ref name="Allan_114"/&gt; Durkheim states that, "Religion gave birth to all that is essential in the society.&lt;ref name="Allan_114"/&gt;

In his work, Durkheim focused on [[totemism]], the religion of the [[Australian Aborigines|aboriginal]] Australians and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]]s.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-106"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Allan_115"/&gt; Durkheim saw totemism as the most ancient religion, and focused on it as he believed its simplicity would ease the discussion of the essential elements of religion.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-106"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Allan_115"/&gt;

{{Quote|text=Now the totem is the flag of the clan. It is therefore natural that the impressions aroused by the clan in individual minds— impressions of dependence and of increased vitality—should fix themselves to the idea of the totem rather than that of the clan : for the clan is too complex a reality to be represented clearly in all its complex unity by such rudimentary intelligences.|sign=Émile Durkheim|source=&lt;ref name="Durkheim, Emile 1964"&gt;Durkheim, Emile. (1964). ''The elementary forms of the religious life.'' London: Allen &amp; Unwin.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Durkheim's work on religion was criticized on both empirical and theoretical grounds by specialists in the field. The most important critique came from Durkheim's contemporary, [[Arnold van Gennep]], an expert on religion and ritual, and also on Australian belief systems. Van Gennep argued that Durkheim's views of primitive peoples and simple societies were "entirely erroneous". Van Gennep further argued that Durkheim demonstrated a lack of critical stance towards his sources, collected by traders and priests, naively accepting their veracity, and that Durkheim interpreted freely from dubious data. At the conceptual level, van Gennep pointed out Durkheim's tendency to press ethnography into a prefabricated theoretical scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Thomassen|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite such critiques, Durkheim's work on religion has been widely praised for its theoretical insight and whose arguments and propositions, according to Robert Alun Jones, "have stimulated the interest and excitement of several generations of sociologists irrespective of theoretical 'school' or field of specialization".&lt;ref&gt;http://durkheim.uchicago.edu/Summaries/forms.html#pgfId=5658; section 7 "Critical Remarks."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sociology and philosophy===

====Sociology of knowledge====

While Durkheim's work deals with a number of subjects, including suicide, the family, [[social structure]]s, and social institutions, a large part of his work deals with the sociology of knowledge.

While publishing short articles on the subject earlier in his career (for example the essay ''De quelques formes primitives de classification'' written in 1902 with Marcel Mauss), Durkheim's definitive statement concerning the sociology of knowledge comes in his 1912 ''magnum opus'' ''[[The Elementary Forms of Religious Life]]''. This book has as its goal not only the elucidation of the social origins and function of religion, but also the social origins and impact of society on language and logical thought. Durkheim worked largely out of a Kantian framework and sought to understand how the concepts and categories of logical thought could arise out of social life. He argued, for example, that the categories of space and time were not [[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]. Rather, the category of space depends on a society's social grouping and geographical use of space, and a group's social rhythm that determines our understanding of time.&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim, 'Conclusion,' Les formes élémentaires de la vie religieuse, Presses Universitaires de France, 5e édition, 2003 {{p.|628}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this Durkheim sought to combine elements of [[rationalism]] and [[empiricism]], arguing that certain aspects of logical thought common to all humans did exist, but that they were products of collective life (thus contradicting the tabla rasa empiricist understanding whereby categories are acquired by individual experience alone), and that they were not universal a priori's (as [[Kant]] argued) since the content of the categories differed from society to society.&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim, 'Introduction,' Les Formes, {{p.|14-17}}, and {{p.|19-22}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another key elements to Durkheim's theory of knowledge is his concept of ''représentations collectives'' ([[collective representations]]), which is outlined in ''[[The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life]]''. ''Représentations collectives'' are the symbols and images that come to represent the ideas, beliefs, and values elaborated by a collectivity and are not reducible to individual constituents. They can include words, slogans, ideas, or any number of material items that can serve as a symbol, such as a cross, a rock, a temple, a feather etc. As Durkheim elaborates, ''représentations collectives'' are created through intense social interaction and are products of collective activity. As such these representations have the particular, and somewhat contradictory, aspect that they exist externally to the individual (since they are created and controlled not by the individual but by society as a whole), and yet simultaneously within each individual of the society (by virtue of that individual's participation within society).&lt;ref name="Durkheim, Emile 1964"/&gt;

Arguably the most important "représentation collective" is [[language]], which according to Durkheim is a product of collective action. And because language is a collective action, language contains within it a history of accumulated knowledge and experience that no individual would be capable of creating on their own. As Durkheim says, 'représentations collectives', and language in particular:
&lt;blockquote&gt;add to that which we can learn by our own personal experience all that wisdom and science which the group has accumulated in the course of centuries. Thinking by concepts, is not merely seeing reality on its most general side, but it is projecting a light upon the sensation which illuminates it, penetrates it and transforms it.&lt;ref&gt;Emile Durkheim, Conclusion, Section III, "Elementary Forms of Religious Life" trans. Joseph Ward Swain, p. 435 (accessed: http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41360/41360-h/41360-h.htm#Page_427)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As such, language, as a social product, literally structures and shapes our experience of reality. This discursive approach to language and society would be developed by later French philosophers, such as [[Michel Foucault]].

====Morality====

Durkheim defines morality as "a system of rules for conduct".&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim, Émile. Sociologie et Philosophie. PUF. Paris, 2004. {{p.|50}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His analysis of morality is strongly marked by [[Immanuel Kant]] and his notion of duty. While Durkheim was influenced by Kant, he was highly critical of aspects of the latter's moral theory and developed his own positions.

Durkheim agrees with Kant that within morality, there is an element of obligation, "a moral authority which, by manifesting itself in certain precepts particularly important to it, confers upon [moral rules] an obligatory character".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Durkheim|1974|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morality tells us how to act from a position of superiority. There exists a certain, pre-established moral norm to which we must conform. It is through this view that Durkheim makes a first critique of Kant in saying that moral duties originate in society, and are not to be found in some universal moral concept such as the [[categorical imperative]]. Durkheim also argues that morality is characterized not just by this obligation, but is also something that is desired by the individual. The individual believes that by adhering to morality, they are serving the common [[Summum bonum|Good]], and for this reason, the individual submits voluntarily to the moral commandment.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Durkheim|1974|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in order to accomplish its aims, morality must be legitimate in the eyes of those to whom it speaks. As Durkheim argues, this moral authority is primarily to be located in religion, which is why in any religion one finds a code of morality. For Durkheim, it is only society that has the resources, the respect, and the power to cultivate within an individual both the obligatory and the desirous aspects of morality.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Durkheim|1974|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Deviance====
{{Quote frame |quote=How many times, indeed, it [crime] is only an anticipation of future morality - a step toward what will be! |author=Émile Durkheim |title=''[[The Division of Labour in Society #DivisionofLabourinSociety|''Division of Labour in Society'']]'' |source=&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=T.

Durkheim thought that [[Deviance (sociology)#Deviance|deviance]] was an essential component of a functional society.&lt;ref name="Textbook"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://openstax.org/details/books/introduction-sociology-2e|title=Introduction to Sociology|publisher=OpenStax|isbn=978-1-947172-11-1|edition=2|pages=138|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that deviance had three possible effects on society. First, Durkheim thought that deviance could challenge the perspective and thoughts of the general population, leading to social change by pointing out a flaw in society.&lt;ref name="Textbook" /&gt; Secondly, deviant acts could also support existing social norms and beliefs by evoking the population to discipline the actors.&lt;ref name="Textbook"/&gt; Finally, Durkheim believed that reactions to deviant activity could increase camaraderie and social support among the population affected by the activity.&lt;ref name="UMN Textbook"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://open.lib.umn.edu/sociology/chapter/7-2-explaining-deviance/|title=Sociology: Understanding and Changing the Social World; Explaining Deviance|publisher=University of Minnesota Libraries Publishing|isbn=978-1-946135-24-7|edition=2016|location=Section 7.2|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Durkheim's thoughts on deviance contributed to [[Strain theory (sociology)#Merton'sTheory|Robert Merton's Strain Theory]] &lt;ref name="Textbook"/&gt;

==Influences and legacy==

Durkheim had an important impact on the development of Anthropology and Sociology, influencing thinkers from his school of sociology, such as [[Marcel Mauss]], but also later thinkers, such as [[Maurice Halbwachs]], [[Talcott Parsons]], [[Alfred Radcliffe-Brown]], and [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]. More recently, Durkheim has influenced sociologists such as [[Steven Lukes]], Robert N. Bellah, and [[Pierre Bourdieu]]. His description of collective consciousness also deeply influenced the Turkish nationalism of [[Ziya Gökalp]], the founding father of Turkish sociology.&lt;ref name="Turkay Salim Nefes"&gt;{{harvp|Nefes|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Randall Collins]] has developed a theory of what he calls interaction ritual chains, which is a synthesis of Durkheim's work on religion with [[Erving Goffman]]'s micro-sociology. Goffman himself was also deeply influenced by Durkheim in his development of the [[interaction order]].

Outside of sociology, he influenced philosophers [[Henri Bergson]] and [[Emmanuel Levinas]], and his ideas can be found latently in the work of certain structuralist thinkers of the 60s, such as [[Alain Badiou]], [[Louis Althusser]], and [[Michel Foucault]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Bourdieu|Passeron|1967|pp=167–168}}: "For, speaking more generally, all the social sciences now live in the house of Durkheimism, unbeknownst to them, as it were, because they walked into it backwards."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Durkheim contra Searle===
Much of Durkheim's work, however, remains unacknowledged in philosophy, despite its direct relevance. As proof one can look to [[John Searle]], who wrote a book ''The Construction of Social Reality'', in which he elaborates a theory of social facts and collective representations that he believed to be a landmark work that would bridge the gap between analytic and continental philosophy. [[Neil Gross]] however, demonstrates how Searle's views on society are more or less a reconstitution of Durkheim's theories of social facts, social institutions, collective representations and the like. Searle's ideas are thus open to the same criticisms as Durkheim's.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Gross|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Searle responded by saying that Durkheim's work was worse than he had originally believed, and, admitting that he had not read much of Durkheim's work, said that, "Because Durkheim’s account seemed so impoverished I did not read any further in his work."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Searle|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen Lukes, however, responded to Searle's response to Gross and refutes point by point the allegations that Searle makes against Durkheim, essentially upholding the argument of Gross, that Searle's work bears great resemblance to that of Durkheim's. Lukes attributes Searle's miscomprehension of Durkheim's work to the fact that Searle, quite simply, never read Durkheim.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lukes|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Āstika''' (Sanskrit आस्तिक IAST: āstika) derives from the Sanskrit ''asti'', "there is, there exists", and means “one who believes in the existence (of God, of another world, etc.)” and '''nāstika''' means "an atheist or unbeliever" &lt;ref name="MW" /&gt;. These have been concepts used to classify [[Indian philosophies]] by modern scholars, and some [[Hinduism|Hindu]], [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] and [[Jainism|Jaina]] texts.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Perrett (2000), Indian Philosophy, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0815336112}}, page 88&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sushil Mittal &amp; Gene Thursby (2004), The Hindu World, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415772273}}, pages 729-730&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Flood: "These schools [such as Buddhism and Jainism] are understandably regarded as heterodox (''nāstika'') by orthodox (''āstika'') Brahmanism."{{sfn|Flood|1996|pp=82}}}} ''Āstika'' has been defined in one of three ways; as those who accept the [[Pramana|epistemic]] authority of the [[Vedas]], as those who accept the existence of [[Ātman (Hinduism)|ātman]], or as those who accept the existence of ''[[Ishvara]]''.&lt;ref name="andrew"&gt;Andrew J.

The most studied Āstika schools of Indian philosophies, sometimes referred to as [[orthodoxy|orthodox]] schools, are six: [[Nyaya|Nyāyá]], [[Vaisheshika|Vaiśeṣika]], [[Samkhya|Sāṃkhya]], [[Yoga]], [[Mīmāṃsā]], and [[Vedanta|Vedānta]]. The most studied Nāstika schools of Indian philosophies, sometimes referred to as [[Heterodoxy|heterodox]] schools, are four: [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]], [[Cārvāka]], and [[Ājīvika]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Flood|1996|pp=82, 224–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For an overview of this method of classification, with detail on the grouping of schools, see: {{harvnb|Radhakrishnan|Moore|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; This orthodox-heterodox terminology is a construct of Western languages, and lacks scholarly roots in Sanskrit. Recent scholarly studies&lt;ref name=andrew/&gt; state that there have been various [[Heresiology|heresiological]] translations of Āstika and Nāstika in 20th century literature on Indian philosophies, but quite many are unsophisticated and flawed.

Astika and Nāstika do not mean "theism" and "atheism" respectively in ancient or medieval era Sanskrit literature.&lt;ref name=andrew/&gt; In current Indian languages like [[Hindi]], ''āstika'' and its derivatives usually mean "[[theism|theist]]", while ''nāstika'' and its derivatives denote an "[[atheism|atheist]].”&lt;ref&gt;For [http://www.iheu.org/node/185 instance] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070418105244/http://www.iheu.org/node/185 |date=18 April 2007 }}, the "Atheist Society of India" produces a monthly publications ''Nastika Yuga'', which it translates as "The Age of Atheism".&lt;/ref&gt; However, the terms are used differently in Hindu philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Chatterjee |first1=Satischandra |last2=Datta |first2=Dhirendramohan |title=An Introduction to Indian Philosophy |edition=Eighth Reprint |publisher=University of Calcutta |year=1984|pages=5, footnote 1|quote=In modern Indian languages, "āstika" and "nāstika" generally mean "theist" and "atheist,” respectively.  But in Sanskrit philosophical literature, "āstika" means "one who believes in the authority of the Vedas".  ("nāstika" means the opposite of these). The word is used here in the first sense. The six orthodox schools are "āstika", and the Cārvāka is "nāstika" in both the senses.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, ''Sāṃkhya'' is both an atheist and ''āstika'' (Vedic) philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;"By {{IAST|Sāṃkhya}} reasoning, the material principle itself simply evolves into complex forms, and there is no need to hold that some spiritual power governs the material principle or its ultimate source."  Francis Clooney, CJ, "''Restoring 'Hindu Theology' as a category in Indian intellectual discourse", in {{cite book|author=Francis Clooney|editor=Gavin Flood|title=The Blackwell Companion to Hinduism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SKBxa-MNqA8C |year=2008|publisher=Blackwell Academic|isbn=978-0-470-99868-7|pages=451–455}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
''Āstika'' is a [[Sanskrit]] adjective (and noun) that is derived from ''asti'' ("there is or exists").&lt;ref name="MW"&gt;{{harvnb|Monier-Williams|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning "knowing that which exists" or "pious";&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Apte|1965|pp=240}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Nāstika'' (''na'' (not) + ''{{IAST|āstika}}'') is its negative.

One of the traditional etymologies of the term ''āstika''–based on [[Pāṇini#Aṣṭādhyāyī|Pāṇini's ''Aṣṭādhyāyī'']],
4.4.60 ("astināstidiṣṭam matiḥ") says ‘he whose opinion is that [[Ishvara|Īśvara]] exists’ ("asti īśvara iti matir yasya").&lt;ref name="SquarciniSquarcini2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Squarcini|first1=Federico|last2=Squarcini|first2=Federico|title=Traditions against Tradition. Criticism, Dissent and the Struggle for the Semiotic Primacy of Veridiction|year=2012|pages=446|doi=10.7135/UPO9781843313977.018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other definitions include "opposite of ''nāstika''" (''nāstika bhinna''); "he whose idea is that Īśvara exists" (''īśvara asti iti vādī''); "he who considers the [[Vedas]] as authorities" (''vedaprāmāṇyavādī''). According to Sanskrit grammarian [[Hemachandra]], ''āstika'' is a synonym for ‘he who believes’.{{refn|name=SquarciniSquarcini2012}}

As used in Hindu philosophy, the differentiation between ''āstika'' and ''nāstika'' does not refer to theism or atheism.&lt;ref name=andrew/&gt; The terms often, but not always, relate to accepting Vedic literature as an authority, particularly on their teachings on Self (Soul). The Veda and Hinduism do not subscribe to or include the concept of an almighty that is separate from oneself i.e. there is no concept of God in the [[Christianity|Christian]] or [[Islam]]ic sense. N. N. Bhattacharya writes:
{{quote|The followers of Tantra were often branded as Nāstika by the political proponents of the Vedic tradition.  The term Nāstika does not denote an atheist since the Veda presents a godless system with no singular almighty being or multiple almighty beings.  It is applied only to those who do not believe in the Vedas.  The {{IAST| Sāṃkhya}}s and {{IAST|Mīmāṃsaka}}s do not believe in God, but they believe in the Vedas and hence they are not Nāstikas. The Buddhists, Jains, and Cārvākas do not believe in the Vedas; hence they are Nāstikas.|{{harvnb|Bhattacharyya|1999|pp=174}}}}

Āstika is also a name, such as that of a Vedic scholar born to the goddess [[Manasa|Mānasā]] ("Mind") and the sage [[Jaratkaru]].&lt;ref&gt;George Williams (2003), Handbook of Hindu Mythology, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195332612}}, page 65&lt;/ref&gt;

== Classification of schools ==

The terms Āstika and Nāstika have been used to classify various Indian intellectual traditions.

=== Āstika Hindu ===

A list of six systems or ''ṣaḍdarśana''s (also spelled ''Sad Darshan'') consider [[Vedas]] as a reliable source of knowledge and an authoritative source.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Flood|1996|pp=231–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are the [[Nyaya]], [[Vaisheshika]], [[Samkhya]], [[Yoga (philosophy)|Yoga]], [[Mīmāṃsā]] and [[Vedanta]] schools of Hinduism, and they are classified as the ''āstika'' schools:

# Nyāyá, the school of logic
# Vaiśeṣika, the [[atomism|atomist school]]
# Sāṃkhya, the enumeration school
# Yoga, the school of Patañjali (which assumes the metaphysics of Sāṃkhya)
# Mīmāṃsā, the tradition of Vedic exegesis
# Vedanta or Uttara Mimāṃsā, the [[Upanishad|Upaniṣad]]ic tradition.

These are often coupled into three groups for both historical and conceptual reasons: Nyāyá-Vaiśeṣika, Sāṃkhya-Yoga, and Mimāṃsā-Vedanta.

=== Nāstika Hindu ===

The main schools of Indian philosophy that reject the [[Vedas]] were regarded as heterodox in the Brahmanical tradition:{{sfn|Flood|1996|pp=82}}

# [[Buddhism]]
# [[Jainism]]
# [[Cārvāka]]
# [[Ājīvika]]
# [[Ajñana]]

The use of the term ''nāstika'' to describe Buddhism and Jainism in India is explained by Gavin Flood as follows:

{{quote|At an early period, during the formation of the Upaniṣads and the rise of Buddhism and Jainism, we must envisage a common heritage of meditation and mental discipline practiced by renouncers with varying affiliations to non-orthodox (Veda-rejecting) and orthodox (Veda-accepting) traditions.... These schools [such as Buddhism and Jainism] are understandably regarded as heterodox (''nāstika'') by orthodox (''āstika'') Brahmanism.|Gavin Flood&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Flood|1996|pp=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Tantra|Tantric traditions]] in Hinduism have both ''āstika'' and ''nāstika'' lines; as Banerji writes in "''Tantra in Bengal''":

{{quote|Tantras are ... also divided as ''āstika'' or Vedic and ''nāstika'' or non-Vedic.  In accordance with the predominance of the deity the ''āstika'' works are again divided as {{IAST|Śākta, Śaiva, Saura, Gāṇapatya and Vaiṣṇava}}.|Banerji&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Banerji|1992|pp= 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Discussion ==

=== Hinduism ===

Manusmriti, in verse 2.11, defines Nāstika as those who revile "Vedic literature based on two roots of science of reasoning ([[Śruti]] and Smriti)".&lt;ref name=andrew/&gt; The 9th century Indian scholar Medhatithi analyzed this definition and stated that Nāstika does not mean someone who says "Vedic literature are untrue", but rather one who says "Vedic literature are immoral". Medhatithi further noted verse 8.309 of Manusmriti, to provide another aspect of the definition of Nāstika as one who believes, "there is no other world, there is no purpose in giving [[Dāna|charity]], there is no purpose in rituals and the teachings in the Vedic literature."&lt;ref name=andrew/&gt;

Manusmriti does not define, or imply a definition for Astika. It is also silent or contradictory on specific rituals such as animal sacrifices, asserting [[Ahimsa]] (non-violence, non-injury) is [[dharma]] in its verses such as verse 10.63 based on Upanishadic layer of Vedic literature, even though the older layer of Vedic literature mention such sacrifices unlike the later layer of Vedic literature.&lt;ref&gt;Sanskrit: [https://archive.org/stream/manusmriti/manusmriti_six_commentaries#page/n1333/mode/2up Manusmriti with six scholar commentaries] VN Mandlik, page 1310&lt;br&gt;English: [http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/quotes/manu-smriti-10-63 Manusmriti 10.63] Berkeley Center for World Religion, Peace and World Affairs, Georgetown University&lt;/ref&gt; Indian scholars, such as those from Samkhya, Yoga, Nyaya and Vedanta schools, accepted Astika to be those that include ''Śabda'' (शब्द, ''Aptavacana'', testimony of Vedic literature and reliable experts) as a reliable means of [[epistemology]], but they accepted the later ancient layer of the Vedic literature to be superseding the earlier ancient layer.&lt;ref name=andrew/&gt;

==== Definition without reference to Vedas ====

In contrast to Manusmiriti, the 6th century CE Jain scholar and doxographer [[Haribhadra]], provided a different perspective in his writings on Astika and Nāstika. Haribhadra did not consider "reverence for Vedas" as a marker for an Astika. He and other 1st millennium CE Jaina scholars defined Astika as one who "affirms there exists another world, transmigration exists, virtue (''punya'') exists, vice (''paap'') exists".&lt;ref name=andrew/&gt;&lt;ref name=wendy/&gt;

The 7th century scholars Jayaditya and Vamana, in ''[[Kāśikāvṛttī|Kasikavrtti]]'' of Pāṇini tradition, were silent on the role of or authority of Vedic literature in defining Astika and Nāstika. They state, "Astika is the one who believes there exists another world. The opposite of him is the Nāstika."&lt;ref name=andrew/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. Haag and V. Vergiani (Eds., 2009), Studies in the Kāśikāvṛtti, Firenze : Società Editrice Fiorentina, {{ISBN|978-8860321145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly the widely studied 2nd-3rd century CE Buddhist philosopher [[Nagarjuna]], in Chapter 1 verses 60-61 of Ratnāvalī, wrote [[Vaisheshika|Vaiśeṣika]] and [[Samkhya|Sāṃkhya]] schools of Hinduism were Nāstika, along with Jainism, his own school of Buddhism and Pudgalavadins (Vātsīputrīya) school of Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;Markus Dressler and Arvind Mandair (2011), Secularism and Religion-Making, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0199782949}}, page 59 note 39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Steinkellner (1991), Studies in the Buddhist Epistemological Tradition: Proceedings of the Second International Dharmakīrti Conference, Vienna, Volume 222, Austrian Academy of Sciences Press, {{ISBN|978-3700119159}}, pages 230-238&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Definition based on belief in Atman ====

Astika, in some texts, is defined as those who believe in the existence of ''[[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]]'' (Soul, Self, Spirit), while Nastika being those who deny there is any "soul, self" in human beings and other living beings.&lt;ref name=gsghurye/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C Sharma (2013), A Critical Survey of Indian Philosophy, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120803657}}, page 66&lt;/ref&gt; All six schools of Hinduism classified as Astika philosophies hold the premise, "Atman exists". Buddhism, in contrast, holds the premise, "Atman does not exist".&lt;ref&gt;Dae-Sook Suh (1994), Korean Studies: New Pacific Currents, University of Hawaii Press, {{ISBN|978-0824815981}}, page 171&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=johnplott3&gt;John C. Plott et al (2000), Global History of Philosophy: The Axial Age, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120801585}}, page 63, Quote: "The Buddhist schools reject any Ātman concept. As we have already observed, this is the basic and ineradicable distinction between Hinduism and Buddhism".&lt;/ref&gt; Asanga Tilakaratna translates Astika as "positivism" and Nastika as "negativism", with Astika illustrated by Brahmanic traditions who accepted "soul and God exists", while Nastika as those traditions, such as Buddhism, who denied "soul and God exists".&lt;ref&gt;Asanga Tilakaratna (2003, Editors: Anne Blackburn and Jeffrey Samuels), Approaching the Dhamma: Buddhist Texts and Practices in South and Southeast Asia, Pariyatti, {{ISBN|978-1928706199}}, pages 128-129;&lt;br&gt;God, states Tilakaratna, in Brahmanic traditions is ''Parama-atma'' (universal soul, [[Ishvara]], Brahman)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jainism ===

According to [[G. S. Ghurye]], the Jain texts define "na+astika" as one "denying what exists" or any school of philosophy that denies the existence of the soul.&lt;ref name=pillai353&gt;{{cite book|author=S. Devadas Pillai|title=Indian Sociology Through Ghurye, a Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P3uD22Ghqs4C&amp;pg=PA354|year=1997|publisher=Popular Prakashan|isbn=978-81-7154-807-1|pages=353–354}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Vedanta sub-traditions of Hinduism are "astika" because they accept the existence of soul, while Buddhist traditions denying this are referred to as "nastika".&lt;ref name=pillai353/&gt;

One of the earliest mentions of ''astika'' concept in Jain texts is by [[Manibhadra]], who states that an ''astika'' is one who "accepts there exist another world (''paraloka''), transmigration of soul, virtue and vice that affect how a soul journeys through time".&lt;ref name="Nicholson2013p172"&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrew J. Nicholson|title=Unifying Hinduism: Philosophy and Identity in Indian Intellectual History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AVusAgAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-14987-7|pages=172–175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 5th–6th century Jainism scholar [[Haribhadra]], states Andrew Nicholson, does not mention anything about accepting or rejecting the Vedas or god as a criterion for being an ''astika'' or ''nastika''. Instead, Haribhadra explains ''nastika'' in the manner of the more ancient Jain scholar Manibhadra, by stating a nastika to be one "who says there is no other worlds, there is no purpose in charity, there is no purpose in offerings".&lt;ref name="Nicholson2013p172"/&gt; An ''astika'', to Haribhadra, is one who believes that there is a purpose and merit in an ethical life such as ''[[ahimsa]]'' (non-violence) and ritual actions.&lt;ref name="Nicholson2013p172"/&gt; This exposition of the word ''astika'' and ''nastika'' by Haribhadra is similar to one by the Sanskrit grammarian and Hindu scholar Pāṇini in section 4.4.60 of the ''Astadhyayi''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrew J. Nicholson|title=Unifying Hinduism: Philosophy and Identity in Indian Intellectual History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AVusAgAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-14987-7|page=173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 12th century Jaina scholar [[Hemachandra]] similarly states, in his text ''Abhidhana Cintamani'', that a ''nastika'' is any philosophy that presumes or argues there is "no virtue and vice".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ramkrishna Bhattacharya|title=Studies on the Carvaka/Lokayata|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=59eygxzQTWQC&amp;pg=PA164|year=2011|publisher=Anthem Press|isbn=978-0-85728-433-4|pages=164–166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Buddhism ===

[[Nagarjuna]], according to Chandradhar Sharma, equates ''Nastikya'' to "nihilism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Chandradhar Sharma|title=A Critical Survey of Indian Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y3gQVd5WogsC|year=2000|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ.|isbn=978-81-208-0365-7|page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 4th century Buddhist scholar [[Asanga]], in ''Bodhisattva Bhumi'', calls ''nastika Buddhists'' as ''sarvavai nasika'', describing them as who are complete deniers. To Asanga, ''nastika'' are those who say "nothing whatsoever exists", and the worst kind of ''nastika'' are those who deny all designation and reality.&lt;ref name="Nicholson2013p174"&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrew J. Nicholson|title=Unifying Hinduism: Philosophy and Identity in Indian Intellectual History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AVusAgAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-14987-7|pages=174–176}}&lt;/ref&gt; Astika are those who accept merit in and practice a religious life.&lt;ref name="Nicholson2013p174"/&gt; According to Andrew Nicholson, later Buddhists understood Asanga to be targeting [[Madhyamaka]] Buddhism as ''nastika'', while considering his own Yogacara Buddhist tradition to be ''astika''.&lt;ref name="Nicholson2013p174"/&gt; Initial interpretations of the Buddhist texts with the term ''astika'' and ''nastika'', such as those composed by Nagarjuna and Asvaghosa, were interpreted as being directed at the Hindu traditions. But, states John Kelly, most later scholarship considers this as incorrect, and that the ''astika'' and ''nastika'' terms were directed towards the competing Buddhist traditions and the intended audience of the texts were Buddhist monks debating an array of ideas across various Buddhist traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John D Kelly|editor=Jan E. M. Houben|title=Ideology and Status of Sanskrit: Contributions to the History of the Sanskrit Language|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_eqr833q9qYC&amp;pg=PA88|year=1996|publisher=BRILL Academic|isbn=90-04-10613-8|pages=88–89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The charges of being a ''nastika'' were serious threat to the social standing of a Buddhist, and could lead to expulsion from Buddhist monastic community. Thus, states Nicholson, the colonial era Indologist definition of astika and nastika schools of Indian philosophy, was based on a narrow study of literature such as a version of ''[[Manusmriti]]'', while in truth these terms are more complex and contextually apply within the diverse schools of Indian philosophies.&lt;ref name="Nicholson2013p174"/&gt;

The most common meaning of astika and nastika, in Buddhism, Hinduism and Jainism was the acceptance and adherence to ethical premises, and not textual validity or doctrinal premises, states Nicholson. It is likely that astika was translated as orthodox, and nastika as heterodox, because the early European Indologists carried the baggage of Christian theological traditions and extrapolated their own concepts to Asia, thereby distorting the complexity of Indian traditions and thought.&lt;ref name="Nicholson2013p174"/&gt;
