'''Asymmetric price transmission''' (sometimes abbreviated as '''APT''' and informally called "'''rockets and feathers'''" [http://www.slate.com/id/2196273/][https://web.archive.org/web/20080805205338/http://www.knowledgeproblem.com/archives/001444.html][http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=978022]) refers to pricing phenomenon occurring when [[downstream price]]s react in a different manner to [[upstream price]] changes, depending on the characteristics of upstream prices or changes in those prices.

The simplest example is when prices of ready products increase promptly whenever prices of inputs increase, but take time to decrease after input price decreases.

== Introduction ==
=== Terminology ===
In business terms, ''price transmission'' means the process in which upstream prices affect downstream prices.  ''Upstream prices'' should be thought of in terms of main inputs prices (for processing / manufacturing, etc.) or prices quoted on higher market levels (e.g. wholesale markets). Accordingly, ''downstream prices'' should be thought of in terms of output prices (for processing / manufacturing, etc.) or prices quoted on lower [[market levels]] (e.g. [[retail markets]]).

=== Background Theory ===

Since (by definition) upstream and downstream prices are related:
*in absence of external shocks, some kind of [[economic equilibrium]] relationship between those two should exist;
*external shocks to the system (i.e. shocks to downstream or upstream prices) should trigger short- and long-run adjustment towards the long-run equilibrium, as:
**rational economic agents price their goods so as to maximize their constant utility function;
**in the long run prices of goods should reflect their scarcity.

== Example of Price Transmission ==
Price transmission is best illustrated by an example.  Assume that:
*[[commodities]] analysed are:
**[[crude oil]] - global upstream, and 
**[[petroleum]] - local downstream;
*market for petroleum in question is small compared to market for crude oil (in terms of quantities sold / bought), so that downstream prices cannot drive upstream prices;
**in the short run, only crude oil prices drive petroleum prices (i.e., prices of other inputs are assumed to be constant);
**no substitutes to petroleum are available in the short run.

Given the above, one might expect that:
*increases and decreases in crude oil prices trigger appropriate changes downstream;
*resulting changes are symmetric in terms of absolute size / timing.
	
Such behaviour, predicted by all canonical industry / market pricing models (perfect competition, monopoly) is called '''Symmetric Price Transmission'''. 

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Time asymmetry.png|thumb|right|Figure 1, Example of the time asymmetry|{{deletable image-caption|1=Thursday, 30 July 2009}}]] --&gt;
In contrast to [[Symmetric price transmission]], Asymmetric Price Transmission is said to exist when the adjustment of prices is not homogeneous with respect to characteristics external or internal to the system. As an example of Asymmetric Price Transmission consider a situation when:
*increases in crude oil prices lead to immediate increases in petroleum prices, but decreases in crude oil prices take time to be passed down to petroleum prices. This asymmetry is referred to as time asymmetry, or

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Combined asymmetry.png|thumb|left|Figure 2, Example of the combined asymmetry]] --&gt;
*combination of the time asymmetry and the size asymmetry (i.e., a situation when increases in crude oil prices lead to bigger changes (in absolute values) in petroleum prices than decreases).

One should remember that the size asymmetry cannot occur on its own. If that had been the case the [[upstream price]]s and [[downstream price]]s would drift apart. Since downstream prices and upstream prices are by definition related to each other, this cannot be the case. Accordingly, size asymmetry can occur only together with time asymmetry and only when the long-run relationship between prices is restored after the impulse shock to upstream prices.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Size asymmetry.png|thumb|right|Figure 3, Example of the size asymmetry]] --&gt;

==Consequences==
The issue of Asymmetric Price Transmission received a considerable attention in economic literature because of two reasons. 

Firstly, its presence is not in line with predictions of the canonical economic theory (e.g. [[perfect competition]] and [[monopoly]]), which expect that under some regularity assumptions (such as non-kinked, [[Convex function|convex]]/[[concave function|concave]] [[demand function]]) downstream responses to upstream changes should be symmetric in terms of absolute size and timing.
	
Secondly, because of the size of the some markets in which Asymmetric Price Transmission takes place (such as petroleum markets), global dependence on some products (again oil) and the share of income spent by average household on some products (again petroleum products), Asymmetric Price Transmission is important from the [[Quality of life|welfare]] point of view. One must remember that APT implies a welfare redistribution from agents downstream to agents upstream (presumably consumers to large energy companies); it has serious political and social consequences.

[[File:ABS-5302.0-BalancePaymentsInternationalInvestmentPositionAustralia-BalancePaymentsSummary-Original Quarter-GoodsServices-A3533958L.svg|thumb|right|300px|The contribution of goods and services to Australia's current account (in $Millions) since 1959.]]
In trade terms, the [[Economy of Australia|Australian economy]] has had persistently large [[current account]] deficits for more than 50 years.&lt;ref name="economist"&gt;[http://www.economist.com/finance/displaystory.cfm?story_id=8931798 Downwonder] [[Economist.com]], 29 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; One single factor that undermines [[balance of payments]] is Australia's narrow export base. {{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}

Dependent upon commodities, the Australian government has endeavoured to redevelop the [[manufacturing in Australia|Australian manufacturing sector]]. This initiative, also known as microeconomic reform, has helped Australian manufacturing to grow from 10.1% in 1983-1984 to 17.8% in 2003-2004.&lt;ref&gt;Leading Edge, R: "Australia in the Global Economy", ''Tim Dixon and John O'Mahomy'', page 133 .&lt;/ref&gt; 

There are other factors that have contributed to the extremely high current account deficit that Australia has today. Lack of international competitiveness and heavy reliance on capital goods from overseas might increase Australia's current account deficit in the future. {{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}

Low levels of national savings also contribute to high current account deficits. This is because excessive expenditure will force a lot of businesses to seek funds overseas. At the same time, when governments run constant budget deficits, they meet their monetary requirements by borrowing from the domestic sector. Economists refer to the ‘crowding out effect’ to explain this economic situation. When governments borrow from the domestic sector, they force the private sector to ‘crowd out’. {{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}

Since there aren't enough funds available within the domestic economy, the private sector is forced to borrow funds from overseas. {{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}
The borrowing of funds is simply typed into the borrowers account at interest to the lender and the fractional reserve banking system kicks in via computerised lendings. {{Citation needed|date=February 2016}} Borrowing from overseas causes Australia’s current account deficit to increase, leading to a major increase in credit debt expansion. On the other hand, there is nothing wrong with the debt growing if Gross Domestic Product grows at the same time. {{Citation needed|date=February 2016}} That is, current account deficit has to stay within a range of 4-5% in order to meet regular interest repayments on foreign debt whilst maintaining perpetual servitude of the borrower and interest repayments to the lender.

However, excessive current account deficit, combined with low investor confidence and the possibility of a [[currency crisis]], may force the central bank to implement contractionary macroeconomic policies to restrict economic growth. When economic growth or activity is being restricted, low investment and low levels of expenditure will generally restrain the current account from growing. Nevertheless, Australia’s current account deficit needs a long term solution in order to secure the Australian economy's viability. {{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}

Many economists {{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}, notably John Pitchford, argued that choices whether to borrow or lend are dealt with between private or ‘consenting adults’ and in consequence no governmental intervention is necessary. There are also other experts who argue that Australia’s high current account deficit will undermine the Australian dollar and that it might experience a similar crisis experienced by the Thai currency that foreshadowed major economic crisis.

== Effects on wider economy ==
There are multiple complications that result if countries have a high sustained current account deficit and high foreign debt. While sustainable foreign debt is not a major problem, an unsustainable current account deficit can have serious repercussions for the Australian economy. In December 2007, Australia's deficit hit $23.3 billion which was an 18 per cent increase from three months earlier.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/record-deficit-blowout/2008/03/04/1204402456355.html Record deficit blow-out] 5 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Beverage Partners Worldwide''' (BPW) is a [[joint venture]] between [[The Coca-Cola Company]] and [[Nestlé]] with headquarters in Zurich, Switzerland. BPW is in the [[ready-to-drink]] tea category in the [[beverage industry]].

The company manages the NESTEA business in 52 countries, collaborating with Coca-Cola bottling partners, who are responsible for production and distribution across its markets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.just-drinks.com/news/coca-cola-co-nestle-scale-back-joint-venture_id105953.aspx Coca-Cola Co and Nestlé Scale Back Joint Venture] Just-Drinks.com, retrieved 6 Jan 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
BPW began in 1991 as Coca-Cola Nestlé Refreshments Company S.A., created to develop the business of ready-to-drink coffee, chocolate and tea around the world. The Coca-Cola Company and Nestlé S.A. are equal partners in the joint venture.  In 2001, a unit of the venture was renamed as Beverage Partners Worldwide (BPW)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB980826756503480975 "Coca-Cola Venture With Nestle Will Expand to New Markets"], ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', January 30, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2007 was restructured to focus on developing and marketing ready-to-drink tea, in particular NESTEA. In 2012, it was decided to concentrate the operations of the joint venture within Eastern and Western Europe, Canada, Australia, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau.  News reports indicated that both parties were dissatisfied with the performance of the joint venture.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Rappeport, [http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/b1d22234-38af-11e1-9d07-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3YkwBbB00 "Coke and Nestlé end parts of iced tea venture"], ''[[Financial Times]]'', January 6, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Sam Roffe, President of Roffe &amp; Sons Pharmaceuticals, dies in what appears to be a climbing accident, leaving his daughter Elizabeth ([[Audrey Hepburn]]) a billion-dollar empire. Roffe's board members see an opportunity to settle old scores, jockey for higher position, and reap lucrative profits. However, an investigation into Sam's death discloses that it was a murder and that a power struggle is going on within the company.

Lead investigator Max Hornung ([[Gert Fröbe]]) informs Elizabeth of his list of suspects, which includes her closest advisers and financially strapped family members. During this time, she marries CEO Rhys Williams ([[Ben Gazzara]]), but he, too, is identified by Hornung as a suspect. As president, Elizabeth follows her father's wishes and refuses to let shares of Roffe &amp; Sons sell on the world market. Her choice prevents the board members from selling their shares as the company's [[by-law]]s prohibit it until all board members agree; on the other hand, her death would allow for a unanimous decision.

After several attempts on her life, an international chase across Europe ensues. Hornung is able to connect these murder attempts to a series of homicides of prostitutes, which have been recorded on [[snuff film]]s using Roffe film stock with a witness in a black Gucci leather coat (several suspects are linked to this coat).

Elizabeth returns to her father's villa in Sardinia during a scirocco for protection from the unseen murderer, who sets her house on fire after she begins destroying objects and shouting, "Now try to make it look like an accident!" Williams and one of the shareholders, Sir Alec Nichols ([[James Mason]]), both show up to save her, but Hornung figures out that Nichols is the killer and shoots him before he can murder Elizabeth in a symbolic snuff film.

'''Bohunician''' industry was a [[paleolithic]] [[archeological industry]] in South-Central and East Europe. The earliest artifacts assigned to this culture are dated using [[radiocarbon dating]] at 48,000 BP. Which may make the earliest presence of modern humans in Europe predating [[Aurignacian]]. Bohunician assemblages are considered similar to [[Emiran]] and [[Ahmarian]] ones and Bohunician culture may be linked to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url=http://www.pnas.org/content/106/38/16040 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0903446106| pmid=19571003| pmc=2752585| title=The spread of modern humans in Europe| journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences| volume=106| issue=38| pages=16040–16045| year=2009| last1=Hoffecker| first1=J.

Canning provides a [[shelf life]] typically ranging from one to five years, although under specific circumstances it can be much longer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Arctic Explorers Uncover (and Eat) 60-Year-Old Food Stash |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/arctic-explorers-uncover-60-year-old-food-stash-180956936/ |website=Smithsonian |accessdate=7 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A freeze-dried canned product, such as canned dried [[lentil]]s, could last as long as 30 years in an edible state. In 1974, samples of canned food from the wreck of the ''[[Bertrand (steamboat)|Bertrand]]'', a steamboat that sank in the Missouri River in 1865, were tested by the [[National Food Processors Association]]. Although appearance, smell and vitamin content had deteriorated, there was no trace of microbial growth and the 109-year-old food was determined to be still safe to eat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-9009146.html | title=The Canning Process; Old Preservation Technique Goes Modern | author=Blumenthal, Dale | journal=FDA Consumer | date=September 1990 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140610222313/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-9009146.html | archivedate=10 June 2014 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and development of canning==
{{See also|Mason jar}}

===French origins===
During the first years of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the French government offered a hefty cash award of 12,000 francs to any inventor who could devise a cheap and effective method of preserving large amounts of food. The larger armies of the period required increased and regular supplies of quality food. Limited food availability was among the factors limiting military campaigns to the summer and autumn months. In 1809, [[Nicolas Appert]], a French confectioner and brewer, observed that food cooked inside a jar did not spoil unless the seals leaked, and developed a method of sealing food in glass jars.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.appert-aina.com appert-aina.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207171508/http://www.appert-aina.com/ |date=7 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Appert was awarded the prize in 1810 by Count Montelivert, a French minister of the interior.&lt;ref&gt;''Applied Nutrition and Food Technology'', Jesse D. Dagoon, 1989; pg. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for lack of spoilage was unknown at the time, since it would be another 50 years before [[Louis Pasteur]] demonstrated the role of microbes in food spoilage.

[[File:Appert Nicolas.jpg|thumb|[[Nicolas Appert]], developer of the canning process]]

The French Army began experimenting with issuing canned foods to its soldiers, but the slow process of canning foods and the even slower development and transport stages prevented the army from shipping large amounts across the [[First French Empire|French Empire]], and the war ended before the process was perfected. 

Following the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the canning process was gradually employed in other European countries and in the US.

===In the United Kingdom===

Based on Appert's methods of food preservation, the [[tin can]] process was allegedly developed by Frenchman [[Philippe de Girard]], who came to London and used British merchant Peter Durand as an agent to patent his own idea in 1810.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Geoghegan |first=Tom |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-21689069 |title=BBC News – The story of how the tin can nearly wasn't |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2013-04-21 |accessdate=2013-06-04 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606174323/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-21689069 |archivedate=6 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Durand did not pursue food canning himself, selling his patent in 1811 to [[Bryan Donkin]] and [[John Hall (engineer)|John Hall]], who were in business as Donkin Hall and Gamble, of [[Bermondsey]].&lt;ref&gt;A brief account of Bryan Donkin FRS and the company he founded 150 years ago. Bryan Donkin Company, Chesterfield, 1953&lt;/ref&gt;  Bryan Donkin developed the process of packaging food in sealed airtight cans, made of tinned wrought iron.  Initially, the canning process was slow and labour-intensive, as each large can had to be hand-made, and took up to six hours to cook, making canned food too expensive for ordinary people.

The main market for the food at this stage was the [[British Army]] and [[Royal Navy]].  By 1817 Donkin recorded that he had sold £3000 worth of canned meat in six months. In 1824 Sir [[William Edward Parry]] took canned beef and pea soup with him on his voyage to the Arctic in HMS Fury, during his search for a northwestern passage to India. In 1829, Admiral Sir [[James Clark Ross|James Ross]] also took canned food to the Arctic, as did Sir [[John Franklin]] in 1845.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&lt;/ref&gt; Some of his stores were found by the search expedition led by Captain (later Admiral Sir) [[Francis McClintock|Leopold McClintock]] in 1857.  One of these cans was opened in 1939, and was edible and nutritious, though it was not analysed for contamination by the lead solder used in its manufacture.

===In Europe===
During the mid-19th century, canned food became a [[status symbol]] amongst middle-class households in [[Europe]], being something of a frivolous [[novelties|novelty]]. Early methods of manufacture employed poisonous [[lead]] [[solder]] for sealing the cans. Studies in the 1980s attributed the lead from the cans as a factor in the disastrous outcome of the 1845 [[Franklin's lost expedition|Franklin expedition]] to chart and navigate the [[Northwest Passage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Canned Food Sealed Icemen's Fate |url=https://www.historytoday.com/sheila-rowbotham/canned-food-sealed-icemens-fate |website=History Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later studies found this to be false.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Researchers acquit the tins in mysterious failed Franklin expedition |url=https://phys.org/news/2013-04-acquit-tins-mysterious-franklin.html |website=Phys.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Increasing mechanization of the canning process, coupled with a huge increase in urban populations across Europe, resulted in a rising demand for canned food. A number of inventions and improvements followed, and by the 1860s smaller machine-made steel cans were possible, and the time to cook food in sealed cans had been reduced from around six hours to thirty minutes.

===In the United States===
[[File:Canning stewpan advertisement.jpg|thumb|1914 magazine advertisement for [[cookware]] with instructions for home canning]]
Canned food also began to spread beyond Europe{{spnd}}Robert Ayars established the first American canning factory in [[New York City]] in 1812, using improved tin-plated wrought-iron cans for preserving [[oyster]]s, [[meat]]s, [[fruit]]s and [[vegetable]]s. Demand for canned food greatly increased during wars. Large-scale wars in the nineteenth century, such as the [[Crimean War]], [[American Civil War]], and [[Franco-Prussian War]] introduced increasing numbers of working-class men to canned food, and allowed canning companies to expand their businesses to meet military demands for non-perishable food, allowing companies to manufacture in bulk and sell to wider civilian markets after wars ended. Urban populations in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] demanded ever-increasing quantities of cheap, varied, quality food that they could keep at home without having to go shopping daily. In response, companies such as [[William Underwood Company|Underwood]], [[Nestlé]], [[H. J. Heinz Company|Heinz]], and others provided quality canned food for sale to [[working class]] city-dwellers. In particular, [[Crosse &amp; Blackwell|Crosse and Blackwell]] took over the concern of Donkin Hall and Gamble.  The late 19th century saw the range of canned food available to urban populations greatly increase, as canners competed with each other using novel foodstuffs, highly decorated printed labels, and lower prices.

===World War I===
Demand for canned food skyrocketed during [[World War I]], as military commanders sought vast quantities of cheap, high-[[calorie]] [[Field ration|food]] to feed their millions of soldiers, which could be transported safely, survive [[trench warfare|trench]] conditions, and not spoil in transport. Throughout the war, soldiers generally subsisted on low-quality canned foodstuffs, such as the British "Bully Beef" (cheap [[corned beef]]), [[pork and beans]], canned sausages, and [[Maconochie|Maconochies Irish Stew]], but by 1916, widespread dissatisfaction with cheap canned food amongst soldiers resulted in militaries purchasing better-quality food to improve morale and the complete meals in a can began to appear. In 1917, the [[French Army]] began issuing canned [[French cuisine]], such as [[coq au vin]], [[Beef Bourguignon]] and [[Vichyssoise]] while the [[Italian Army]] experimented with canned [[ravioli]], [[Bolognese sauce|spaghetti bolognese]], [[Minestrone]] and [[Pasta e fagioli]]. Shortages of canned food in the [[British Army]] in 1917 led to the government issuing [[cigarette]]s and [[amphetamine]]s to soldiers to suppress their appetites. After the war, companies that had supplied military canned food improved the quality of their goods for civilian sale.

==Methods==
The original fragile and heavy glass containers presented challenges for transportation, and glass jars were largely replaced in commercial canneries with cylindrical [[tin can]] or wrought-iron canisters (later shortened to "cans") following the work of [[Peter Durand]] (1810).  Cans are cheaper and quicker to make, and much less fragile than glass jars.  Glass jars have remained popular for some high-value products and in [[home canning]]. [[Can opener]]s were not invented for another thirty years — at first, soldiers had to cut the cans open with [[bayonet]]s or smash them open with rocks. Today, tin-coated [[steel]] is the material most commonly used. [[Aseptic processing|Laminate vacuum pouches]] are also used for canning, such as used in [[Meal, Ready-to-Eat|MRE]]s and [[Capri Sun]] drinks.

To prevent the food from being spoiled before and during containment, a number of methods are used: pasteurisation, boiling (and other applications of high temperature over a period of time), refrigeration, freezing, drying, vacuum treatment, antimicrobial agents that are natural to the recipe of the foods being preserved, a sufficient dose of ionizing radiation, submersion in a strong saline solution, acid, base, osmotically extreme (for example very sugary) or other microbially-challenging environments.

Other than [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilization]], no method is perfectly dependable as a preservative. For example, the microorganism ''[[Clostridium botulinum]]'' (which causes [[botulism]]) can only be eliminated at temperatures above the boiling point of water.

From a public safety point of view, foods with low [[acidity]] (a [[pH]] more than 4.6) need sterilization under high temperature (116–130&amp;nbsp;°C). To achieve temperatures above the boiling point requires the use of a [[pressure cooking|pressure canner]]. Foods that must be pressure canned include most [[vegetable]]s, [[meat]], [[seafood]], [[poultry]], and [[dairy]] products. The only foods that may be safely canned in an ordinary boiling water bath are highly [[acid]]ic ones with a pH below 4.6,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=William Schafer |url=http://www.extension.umn.edu/distribution/nutrition/DJ1097.html |title=Home Canning Tomatoes |publisher=Extension.umn.edu |date=9 January 2009 |accessdate=2010-07-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100701144442/http://www.extension.umn.edu/distribution/nutrition/dj1097.html |archivedate=1 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[fruit]]s, [[pickling|pickled]] vegetables, or other foods to which acidic additives have been added.

===Double seams===
Invented in 1888 by Max Ams,&lt;ref&gt;Mark Q. Sutton, [https://books.google.com/books?id=E95OAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Max+Ams%221888+seam&amp;dq=%22Max+Ams%221888+seam&amp;cd=1 ''Archaeological laboratory methods: an introduction''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171204000053/https://books.google.com/books?id=E95OAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Max+Ams%221888+seam&amp;dq=%22Max+Ams%221888+seam&amp;cd=1 |date=4 December 2017 }}, Kendall/Hunt Pub., 1996, p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; modern [[double seam]]s provide an airtight [[Hermetic seal|seal]] to the [[tin can]]. This airtight nature is crucial to keeping micro-organisms out of the can and keeping its contents sealed inside. Thus, double seamed cans are also known as Sanitary Cans. Developed in 1900 in Europe, this sort of can was made of the traditional cylindrical body made with [[tin plate]]. The two ends ([[Lid (container)|lids]]) were attached using what is now called a double seam. A can thus sealed is impervious to contamination by creating two tight continuous folds between the can's cylindrical body and the lids.  This eliminated the need for [[solder]] and allowed improvements in manufacturing speed, reducing cost.

Double seaming uses rollers to shape the can, lid and the final double seam. To make a sanitary can and lid suitable for double seaming, manufacture begins with a sheet of coated tin plate. To create the can body, rectangles are cut and curled around a die, and welded together creating a cylinder with a side seam.

Rollers are then used to flare out one or both ends of the cylinder to create a quarter circle flange around the circumference.  Precision is required to ensure that the welded sides are perfectly aligned, as any misalignment will cause inconsistent flange shape, compromising its integrity.

A circle is then cut from the sheet using a die cutter.  The circle is shaped in a stamping press to create a downward countersink to fit snugly into the can body. The result can be compared to an upside down and very flat [[top hat]].  The outer edge is then curled down and around about 140 degrees using rollers to create the end curl.

The result is a steel tube with a flanged edge, and a countersunk steel disc with a curled edge. A [[rubber]] compound is put inside the curl.

====Seaming====
{{See also|Can seamer}}
[[File:HK Food Grass Jelly Canned with Tinplate a.jpg|thumb|Opened can]]

The body and end are brought together in a seamer and held in place by the base plate and chuck, respectively.  The base plate provides a sure footing for the can body during the seaming operation and the chuck fits snugly into the end (lid).  The result is the countersink of the end sits inside the top of the can body just below the flange.  The end curl protrudes slightly beyond the flange.

====First operation====
Once brought together in the seamer, the seaming head presses a first operation roller against the end curl.  The end curl is pressed against the flange curling it in toward the body and under the flange.  The flange is also bent downward, and the end and body are now loosely joined together.  The first operation roller is then retracted.  At this point five thicknesses of steel exist in the seam. From the outside in they are:
*End
*Flange
*End Curl
*Body
*Countersink

====Second operation====
The seaming head then engages the second operation roller against the partly formed seam.  The second operation presses all five steel components together tightly to form the final seal.  The five layers in the final seam are then called; a) End, b) Body Hook, c) Cover Hook, d) Body, e) Countersink.  All sanitary cans require a filling medium within the seam because otherwise the metal-to-metal contact will not maintain a hermetic seal.  In most cases, a rubberized compound is placed inside the end curl radius, forming the critical seal between the end and the body.

Probably the most important innovation since the introduction of double seams is the welded side seam.  Prior to the welded side seam, the can body was folded and/or soldered together, leaving a relatively thick side seam.  The thick side seam required that the side seam end juncture at the end curl to have more metal to curl around before closing in behind the Body Hook or flange, with a greater opportunity for error.

====Seamer setup and quality assurance====
Many different parts during the seaming process are critical in ensuring that a can is airtight and vacuum sealed. The dangers of a can that is not hermetically sealed are contamination by foreign objects (bacteria or fungicide sprays), or that the can could leak or spoil.

One important part is the seamer setup. This process is usually performed by an experienced technician. Amongst the parts that need setup are seamer rolls and chucks which have to be set in their exact position (using a feeler gauge or a [[clearance gauge]]). The lifter pressure and position, roll and chuck designs, tooling wear, and bearing wear all contribute to a good [[double seam]].

Incorrect setups can be non-intuitive. For example, due to the [[springback]] effect, a seam can appear loose, when in reality it was closed too tight and has opened up like a spring. For this reason, experienced operators and good seamer setup are critical to ensure that double seams are properly closed.

Quality control usually involves taking full cans from the line – one per seamer head, at least once or twice per shift, and performing a teardown operation ([[wrinkle]]/[[wikt:tightness|tightness]]), mechanical tests (external thickness, seamer length/height and countersink) as well as cutting the seam open with a twin blade saw and measuring with a double seam inspection system. The combination of these measurements will determine the seam's quality.

Use of a [[statistical process control]] (SPC) software in conjunction with a manual double-seam monitor, computerized double seam scanner, or even a fully automatic double seam inspection system makes the laborious process of double seam inspection faster and much more accurate.  Statistically tracking the performance of each head or seaming station of the [[can seamer]] allows for better prediction of can seamer issues, and may be used to plan maintenance when convenient, rather than to simply react after bad or unsafe cans have been produced.&lt;ref&gt;Quality Assurance for the Food Industry: A Practical Approach by J. Andres Vasconcellos&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nutritional value==
Canning is a way of processing food to extend its [[shelf life]]. The idea is to make food available and edible long after the processing time. A 1997 study found that canned fruits and vegetables are as rich with [[dietary fiber]] and [[vitamin]]s as the same corresponding fresh or frozen foods, and in some cases the canned products are richer than their fresh or frozen counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rickman|title=Nutritional comparison of fresh, frozen, and canned fruits and vegetables|year=2007|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.2824/abstract|accessdate=19 February 2012|doi=10.1002/jsfa.2824|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130411065023/http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.2824/abstract|archivedate=11 April 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The heating process during canning appears to make dietary fiber more soluble, and therefore more readily fermented in the colon into gases and physiologically active byproducts. Canned tomatoes have a higher available [[lycopene]] content. Consequently, canned meat and vegetables are often among the list of food items that are stocked during emergencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://earthquake-survival-kits.org/emergency-survival-food.php |title=Food Supplies To Stock For Emergencies |publisher=earthquake-survival-kits.org |date= |accessdate=2012-04-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104071712/http://earthquake-survival-kits.org/emergency-survival-food.php |archivedate=4 November 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Potential hazards==
{{See also|Packaging and labeling|Food safety}}
[[File:Women working in a cannery.jpg|thumb|left|Women working in a cannery]]
In the beginning of the 19th century the process of canning foods was mainly done by small canneries. These canneries were full of overlooked sanitation problems, such as poor hygiene and unsanitary work environments. Since the refrigerator did not exist and industrial canning standards were not set in place it was very common for contaminated cans to slip onto the grocery store shelves.

===Botulism===

Foodborne [[botulism]] results from contaminated foodstuffs in which ''[[C. botulinum]]'' spores have been allowed to germinate and produce botulism toxin,&lt;ref name=koo&gt;[http://infectiousdiseases.about.com/od/diseasesbyname/a/Botulism.htm Botox and Botulism?

Canned goods and canning supplies sell particularly well in times of recession due to the tendency of financially stressed individuals to engage in [[cocooning]], a term used by retail analysts to describe the phenomenon in which people choose to stay at home instead of adding expenditures to their budget by dining out and socializing outside the home.

In February 2009 during a recession, the United States saw an 11.5% rise in sales of canning-related items.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1884149,00.html | work=Time | title=What Sells in a Recession: Canned Goods and Condoms | date=11 March 2009 | accessdate=28 April 2010 | first=Sean | last=Gregory | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100416015632/http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1884149,00.html | archivedate=16 April 2010 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some communities in the US have county canning centers which are available for teaching canning, or shared community kitchens which can be rented for canning one's own foods.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pickyourown.org/canneries.htm  Canneries, Canning Centers, Community Kitchens, Commercial Kitchesn for Rent, Local Canning Resources and Food Business Incubators – Commercial Canning for Your Home Produce] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150418074618/http://www.pickyourown.org/canneries.htm |date=18 April 2015 }}, Pickyourown.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
There was a 1956 US documentary ''The Miracle of the Can'' that mentions the Pea Tenderomiter for the canning trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Miracle of the Can|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e61omDYJdeU|website=YouTube|publisher=American Can Company|accessdate=10 July 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140523163328/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e61omDYJdeU|archivedate=23 May 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''DigitalGlobe''' is an American commercial vendor of space imagery and geospatial content, and operator of civilian [[remote sensing]] spacecraft. The company [[Initial Public Offering|went public]] on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] on 14 May 2009, selling 14.7 million shares at $19.00 each to raise $279 million in capital. On 5 October 2017, [[Maxar Technologies]] has completed its acquisition of DigitalGlobe.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.geospatialworld.net/news/mda-dg-combined-entity-to-be-rebranded-as-maxar-technologies/|title=MDA-DG combined entity to be rebranded as Maxar Technologies|work=Geospatial World|access-date=2017-10-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WorldView satellites should not be confused with WorldView company, a division of [[Paragon Space Development Corporation]] offering flights to near-space.

==Origins==
WorldView Imaging Corporation was founded in January 1992 in [[Oakland, California]] in anticipation of the 1992 Land Remote Sensing Policy Act (enacted in October 1992) which permitted private companies to enter the satellite imaging business.&lt;ref name="eomonline.com"&gt;{{cite web|last=Duman |first=Angie |url=http://www.eomonline.com/Common/Archives/1995oct/95oct_tripp.html |title=xyHt &amp;#124; Positioning and Measurement, Elevated |website=Eomonline.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013192646/http://www.eomonline.com/Common/Archives/1995oct/95oct_tripp.html |archivedate=2008-10-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its founder was Dr Walter Scott, who was joined by co-founder and CEO Doug Gerull in late 1992. In 1993, the company received the first high [[Optical resolution|resolution]] commercial remote sensing satellite license issued under the 1992 Act.&lt;ref name="digitalglobehistory"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalglobe.com/about-us/company#history |title=Our Company |publisher=DigitalGlobe |date=2014-08-21 |accessdate=2016-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company was initially funded with private financing from [[Silicon Valley]] sources and interested corporations in N. America, Europe, and Japan.  Dr. Scott was head of the [[Lawrence Livermore Laboratories]] "Brilliant Pebbles" and "Brilliant Eyes" projects which were part of the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]].  Doug Gerull was the executive in charge of the Mapping Sciences division at the [[Intergraph Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Markoff |first=John |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE4D71638F931A25751C0A965958260 |title=COMPANY NEWS - A Plan for Close-Up Images of Earth From Space - NYTimes.com |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=1993-02-12 |accessdate=2016-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The company's first remote sensing license from the [[United States Department of Commerce]] allowed it to build a commercial remote sensing [[Earth observation satellite|satellite]] capable of collecting images with {{convert|3|m|abbr=on}} resolution.&lt;ref name="eomonline.com"/&gt;

In 1995, the company became EarthWatch Incorporated, merging WorldView with [[Ball Aerospace &amp; Technologies Corp.]]'s commercial remote sensing operations.&lt;ref name="companyhistory"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalglobe.com/about/history.shtml |title=Digital Globe - History |accessdate=2006-04-19 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060413043028/http://digitalglobe.com/about/history.shtml |archivedate=2006-04-13 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 2001, EarthWatch became DigitalGlobe.&lt;ref name="nasa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asd.ssc.nasa.gov/datapurchase/default.aspx?s=6&amp;ss=2 |publisher=NASA |title=Scientific Data Purchase |accessdate=2006-04-19 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060929025643/http://www.asd.ssc.nasa.gov/datapurchase/default.aspx?s=6&amp;ss=2 |archivedate=2006-09-29 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, DigitalGlobe acquired online imagery provider [[GlobeXplorer]] to extend its imagery distribution capabilities via online APIs and web services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=SpaceNews » |url=http://spacenews.com/digitalglobe-buys-web-based-imagery-firm/ |title=Media |publisher=SpaceNews |date= |accessdate=2007-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, DigitalGlobe was inducted into the [[Space Foundation]]'s [[Space Technology Hall of Fame]] for its role in advancing commercial Earth-imaging satellites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Space Foundation RSS Feed » |url=http://www.spacefoundation.org/news/story.php?id=1086 |title=Media |publisher=Space Foundation |date= |accessdate=2016-02-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004121908/http://www.spacefoundation.org/news/story.php?id=1086 |archivedate=2011-10-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, DigitalGlobe purchased GeoEye.

In February 2017, [[MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates|MDA]] and DigitalGlobe reached an agreement for MDA to acquire DigitalGlobe for US $2.4B.&lt;ref&gt;http://spacenews.com/mda-to-acquire-digitalglobe/&lt;/ref&gt;

As of May 2017, DigitalGlobe's image catalog contains 100 [[petabytes]] worth of data, and grows by 100 [[terabytes]] each day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2017/05/best-way-transmit-satellite-data-trucks-really/|title=THE BEST WAY TO TRANSMIT SATELLITE DATA?

===EarlyBird-1===
EarlyBird-1 was launched for [[Earth Watch Inc.]] on December 24, 1997, from the [[Svobodny Cosmodrome]] by a [[Start-1]] launch vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1997-085A |title=Early Bird 1 |publisher=NASA |accessdate=February 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It included a [[panchromatic]] camera with a {{convert|3|m|abbr=on}} resolution and a [[multispectral]] camera with a {{convert|15|m|abbr=on}} resolution. Early Bird 1 was the first commercial satellite to be launched from the Svobodny Cosmodrome.

===IKONOS===
{{Main article|IKONOS}}
IKONOS was launched September 24, 1999. It was the world's first high-resolution commercial imaging satellite to collect panchromatic (black-and-white) images with 0.8 m resolution and multispectral (color) imagery with 3.2-meter resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://dg-cms-uploads-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/document/file/96/DG_IKONOS_DS.pdf |title=IKONOS Data Sheet |date= |accessdate=February 25, 2016 |website=Dg-cms-uploads.production.s3.amazonaws.com |publisher= |last= |first=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 31, 2015, IKONOS was officially decommissioned after more than doubling her mission design life, spending 5,680 days in orbit and making 83,131 trips around the earth.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.tomnod.com/ikonos-quickbird-2/ |title=DigitalGlobe satellites IKONOS and QuickBird-2 retire after years of service |date= |accessdate=February 25, 2016 |website=Blog.tomnod.com |publisher= |last= |first= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304064739/http://blog.tomnod.com/ikonos-quickbird-2/ |archivedate=March 4, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===QuickBird===
{{Main article|QuickBird}}
QuickBird, launched on October 18, 2001,&lt;ref name="companyhistory" /&gt; was DigitalGlobe's primary satellite until early 2015. It was built by Ball Aerospace, and launched by a Boeing Delta II. It is in a 450&amp;nbsp;km altitude, −98 degree inclination [[sun-synchronous orbit]]. An earlier launch attempt resulted in the loss of QuickBird-1. It included a panchromatic camera with a {{convert|60|cm|abbr=on}} resolution and a multispectral camera with a {{convert|2.4|m|abbr=on}} resolution. On January 27, 2015, QuickBird was de-orbited, exceeding her initial life expectancy by nearly 300%.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===GeoEye-1===
{{Main article|GeoEye-1}}
The GeoEye-1 satellite collects images at .41-meter panchromatic (black-and-white) and 1.65-meter multispectral resolution. The satellite can collect up to 350,000 square kilometers of pan-sharpened multispectral imagery per day. This is used for large-scale mapping projects. GeoEye-1 can revisit any point on Earth once every three days or sooner.

===WorldView satellites===

Ball Aerospace built WorldView-3. It was launched on August 13, 2014. It has a maximum resolution of {{convert|25|cm|in|abbr=on}}. WorldView-3 operates at an altitude of {{convert|617|km|abbr=on}}, where it has an average revisit time of less than once per day. Over the course of a day it is able to collect imagery of up to {{convert|680000|km2|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalglobe.com/sites/default/files/DG_WorldView3_DS_2014.pdf |title=WorldView-3 Data Sheet |publisher=DigitalGlobe.com |accessdate=February 25, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140804145946/https://www.digitalglobe.com/sites/default/files/DG_WorldView3_DS_2014.pdf |archivedate=August 4, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Previously, DigitalGlobe was only licensed to sell images with a higher resolution than {{convert|50|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} to the US military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hollingham |first=Richard |url=http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20140211-inside-the-google-earth-sat-lab |title=Future - Inside the Google Earth satellite factory |publisher=BBC |date=February 11, 2014 |accessdate=February 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, DigitalGlobe obtained permission, in June 2014, from the U.S. Department of Commerce, to allow the company to more widely exploit its commercial satellite imagery. The company was permitted to offer customers the highest resolution imagery available from their constellation. Additionally, the updated approvals allowed the sale of imagery to customers at up to 25&amp;nbsp;cm panchromatic and {{convert|100|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} multispectral ground sample distance (GSD),  beginning six months after WorldView-3 became operational. WorldView-3 was launched aboard a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket in the 401 configuration on August 13, 2014, at 11:30 local time from SLC-3 at Vandenberg Air Force base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://media.digitalglobe.com/press-releases/u-s-department-of-commerce-relaxes-resolution-restrictions-digitalglobe-extends--nyse-dgi-1122861 |accessdate=June 29, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714215709/http://media.digitalglobe.com/press-releases/u-s-department-of-commerce-relaxes-resolution-restrictions-digitalglobe-extends--nyse-dgi-1122861 |archivedate=July 14, 2014|title=U.S. Department of Commerce Relaxes Resolution Restrictions DigitalGlobe Extends Lead in Image Quality}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}'''Giovanni Agnelli''' (13 August 1866 – 16 December 1945) was an [[Italians|Italian]] [[entrepreneur]], who founded [[Fiat]] car manufacturing in 1899.

==Early life==
The son of [[Edoardo Agnelli (1831-1871)|Edoardo Agnelli]] and [[Aniceta Frisetti]], he was born in 1866 in [[Villar Perosa]], a small town near [[Pinerolo]], [[Piedmont]], still the main home and burial place of the Agnelli family. His father, mayor of Villar Perosa, died at age 40, when Giovanni was just five. He studied at the Collegio San Giuseppe in [[Turin]]; then embarked on a military career until 1893 when he returned to [[Villar Perosa]], where he followed in his father's footsteps and became [[mayor]] in 1895 which he held until his death. Agnelli heard about the invention of the (then) new horseless carriage and immediately saw an opportunity for using his engineering and entrepreneurial skills. In 1898, he met Count Emanuele Cacherano of [[Bricherasio]], who was looking for investors for his horseless carriage project; Agnelli sensed the opportunity.

==Business career==
On 11 July 1899 Agnelli was part of the group of founding members of the Fabbrica Italiana di Automobili Torino, which became Fiat; he paid $400 for his share in 1899, worth around $11,500 in today's prices.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} One year later he was the managing director of the new company and became the chairman in 1920. The first Fiat plant opened in 1900 with 35 staff making 24 cars. Known from the beginning for the talent and creativity of its engineering staff; by 1903 Fiat made a small profit and produced 135 cars; this grew to 1,149 cars by 1906. The company then went public selling shares via the [[Milan stock exchange]]. Agnelli began purchasing all the shares he could adding to his holding, overcoming scandals and labour problems.

During [[World War I]] (1914–18) Agnelli became involved with the financier [[Riccardo Gualino]] in transport of US aid to Europe in 1917.
They invested in two enterprises in the United States; the Marine &amp; Commerce Corporation of America exported coal and the International Shipbuilding Company made motorized vessels.
These companies failed when the war ended, since they were structured to meet wartime demand, but had returned large profits to their owners.{{sfn|Chiapparino|2003}}
Agnelli and Gualino made an attempt early in 1918 to take over Credito Italiano.
They did not succeed, but joined the board of directors of the bank.{{sfn|Zamagni|1993|p=233}}
Agnelli was vice-president of Gualino's [[SNIA S.p.A.|SNIA]] from 1917 to 1926. In the early 1920s SNIA began to manufacture artificial textile fibers.
In 1920 Gualino and Agnelli participated in recapitalization of the private bank Jean de Fernex, and bought a third of the shares of Alfredo Frassati, publisher of ''[[La Stampa]]''.{{sfn|Riccardo Gualino – Storia e Cultura}}
Gualino and Agnelli were also involved in a proposal to link [[Milan]], [[Genoa]] and [[Turin]] with a high-speed railway, and in various projects in cement and automobiles.
Their partnership broke up around 1926 due to Gualino's investments in the French automobile industry.{{sfn|Chiapparino|2003}}

After World War I Fiat jumped from 30th to third place among Italian industrial companies. The first [[Ford]] factory was opened four years after Fiat was founded and already in 1906 a first Fiat car dealer in US was established, in Manhattan, Broadway. Agnelli was appointed a [[Italian Senate|Senator]] in 1923,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=31rWDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA37&amp;dq=Giovanni+Agnelli+born+in+1866&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiqt-mi7obYAhVKuRQKHTduB58Q6AEIMjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Giovanni%20Agnelli%20born%20in%201866&amp;f=false|title=An Economic History of Twentieth-Century Europe: Economic Regimes from Laissez-Faire to Globalization|last=Berend|first=Ivan T.|date=2016-09-22|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=|isbn=9781107136427|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and filled several other prestigious positions between the two wars. He remained focused and propelled Fiat to the international arena. He was still active with FIAT at the start of the [[World War II|Second World War]], and died soon after it ended in 1945 at age 79.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5938">'''Global R&amp;D management''' is the discipline of designing and leading [[R&amp;D]] processes globally, i.e. across borders, in multi-cultural and multi-lingual settings, and cutting across multiple time zones. In addition, managing R&amp;D organizations, and ensuring smooth transfer of new know-how and technology to other groups or departments involved in [[innovation]].&lt;ref&gt;Chiesa, V. (2001). R&amp;D Strategy and Organisation, Imperial College Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Boutellier, Roman |author2=Gassmann, Oliver |author3=von Zedtwitz, Maximilian |title=Managing Global Innovation |publisher=Springer |year=2000 |location=Berlin |isbn=3-540-66832-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Global R&amp;D teams trade the benefits of collocation and centralization with the benefits of local responsiveness, local insight and global synergy.

Global R&amp;D management today benefits the automotive, aerospace, medical, software and video game industries, among many others.&lt;ref name="ref7"/&gt; In order for companies to achieve their objectives
of a timely and cost-effective product development it often requires seeking resources outside the company confines. This can range from outsourcing non-core activities to co-development and collaboration.&lt;ref name="ref7"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amritt.com/global-innovation.html|title=Global innovation|accessdate=2011-03-21|work=Amritt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Industrial R&amp;D has globalized since the 1950s, when e.g. the US company [[IBM]] started a research center in Europe, but it was not before the 1990s that global R&amp;D reached noteworthy proportions in any firm. Access to local technology, access to local markets,&lt;ref&gt;von Zedtwitz, M.; Gassmann, O. (2002): Market versus Technology Drive in R&amp;D Internationalization: Four different patterns of managing research and development. Research Policy, 31, 4, 569–588.&lt;/ref&gt; and merger and acquisitions of parent companies led to a dispersion of R&amp;D activities worldwide. Various estimates now put the average internationalization of R&amp;D at 10% (for e.g. Japanese firms) to more than 50% (e.g. for many European and some US firms). Great variances among companies even within the same industry exist, indicating that there is no single normative strategy to determine the dispersion or globalization of R&amp;D.&lt;ref name="ref1"&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Franklin R. Root]] | year=1992 | title=International strategic management: challenges and opportunities  | url=https://www.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=TI6oLd3q5JEC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA185&amp;dq=Global+R%26D+management&amp;ots=S3jE0YbFe-&amp;sig=z58mERvGLB6PG9fKza-rHTGXebo#v=onepage&amp;q=Global%20R%26D%20management&amp;f=false | publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]] | pages=259 | isbn=978-0-8448-1666-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ref2"&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Arnoud de Meyer]] | year=1889 | title=Global R&amp;D management  | url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9310.1989.tb00634.x/abstract | publisher= | pages=146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Training==
Global R&amp;D Management requires that engineers, scientists and managers be trained for competence in cross-cultural communication, a skill not often taught in engineering schools.
Practical Books on the topic include as Cross-Cultural Dialogues: 74 Brief Encounters with Cultural Difference” by Craig Storti.&lt;ref name="ref3"&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Craig Storti]] | year=1996 | title=Cross-cultural dialogues: 74 brief encounters with cultural difference  | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rY1xBO4R8HcC&amp;dq=Cross-Cultural+Dialogues:+74+Brief+Encounters+with+Cultural+Difference | publisher=[[Intercultural Press]] | pages=140 | isbn=978-1-877864-28-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Practical workshops on communication with India are offered by Amritt, Inc &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amritt.com/india-business-training-workshop.html|title=India business training workshop|accessdate=2011-03-21|work=Amritt}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on China by Ionis International.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ionisinternational.com/faq/chinafaq.html|title=China Q&amp;A|accessdate=2011-03-21|work=Ionis International}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Global R&amp;D management is concerned with the following sub-topics:
* virtual R&amp;D management
* open innovation
* set-up and establishment of R&amp;D centers
* R&amp;D location decisions
* cross-border R&amp;D project management
* technology transfer
* managing R&amp;D networks
* post-merger integration of R&amp;D units
* dissolution of R&amp;D centers
* productivity and performance measurement of R&amp;D

==Research centers==

Locations considered to be excellent places to find these resources are India and China because they are also the locales where many new products are targeted.&lt;ref name="ref7"/&gt; Companies such as General Electric have put up vast in-house research and development centers in emerging countries such as India. Establishing and running an offshore facility for [[R&amp;D]] take a serious commitment of management bandwidth.  Hundreds of American and European companies have found that this approach gives the best combination of security and long-term financial advantages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amritt.com/offshore-research-and-development.html|title=Offshore research and development|accessdate=2011-03-21|work=Amritt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Haber process''', also called the '''Haber–Bosch process''', is an artificial [[nitrogen fixation]] process and is the main industrial procedure for the [[ammonia production|production of ammonia]] today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Appl |first=M. |chapter=The Haber–Bosch Process and the Development of Chemical Engineering |title=A Century of Chemical Engineering |location=New York |publisher=Plenum Press |year=1982 |pages=29–54 |isbn=978-0-306-40895-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Appl&gt;{{Ullmann|first=Max|last=Appl|title=Ammonia|doi=10.1002/14356007.a02_143.pub2|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is named after its inventors, the German chemists [[Fritz Haber]] and [[Carl Bosch]], who developed it in the first decade of the 20th century. The process converts atmospheric [[nitrogen]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) to [[ammonia]] (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) by a reaction with [[hydrogen]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) using a metal catalyst under high temperatures and pressures:

Before the development of the Haber process, ammonia had been difficult to produce on an industrial scale,&lt;ref name=Smil_2004_Enriching&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smil|first1=Vaclav|title=Enriching the Earth: Fritz Haber, Carl Bosch, and the Transformation of World Food Production|date=2004|publisher=MIT|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=9780262693134|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hager&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hager|first1=Thomas|title=The Alchemy of Air: A Jewish genius, a doomed tycoon, and the scientific discovery that fed the world but fueled the rise of Hitler|date=2008|publisher=Harmony Books|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-307-35178-4|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sittig|first1=Marshall|title=Fertilizer Industry: Processes, Pollution Control, and Energy Conservation|date=1979|publisher=Noyes Data Corp.|location=Park Ridge, NJ|isbn=978-0-8155-0734-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; with early methods such as the [[Birkeland–Eyde process]] and [[Frank–Caro process]] all being highly inefficient.

Although the Haber process is mainly used to produce [[fertilizer]] today, during [[World War I]] it provided [[German Empire|Germany]] with a source of ammonia for the production of [[explosive]]s, compensating for the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]]' trade blockade on [[Nitratine|Chilean saltpeter]].

==History==
{{Main|History of the Haber process}}

Throughout the 19th century the demand for nitrates and ammonia for use as fertilizers and industrial feedstocks had been steadily increasing. The main source was mining [[niter]] deposits. At the beginning of the 20th century it was being predicted that these reserves could not satisfy future demands &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=James|first1=Laylin K.|title=Nobel Laureates in Chemistry 1901–1992|date=1993|publisher=American Chemical Society|location=Washington, DC|isbn=978-0-8412-2690-6|page=118|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; and research into new potential sources of ammonia became more important. The obvious source was atmospheric nitrogen (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), comprising nearly 80% of the air, however N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is exceptionally stable and will not readily react with other chemicals. Converting N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into ammonia posed a challenge for chemists globally.

Haber, with his assistant [[Robert Le Rossignol]], developed the high-pressure devices and [[catalysts]] needed to demonstrate the Haber process at laboratory scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Haber|first1=Fritz|title=Thermodynamik technischer Gasreaktionen|date=1905|publisher=Salzwasser Verlag|location=Paderborn|isbn=9783864448423|edition=1st|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Robert Le Rossignol, 1884–1976: Professional Chemist |year=2009 |journal=ChemUCL Newsletter |url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/chemistry/alumni/documents/A5booklet_020909.pdf |page=8 |doi= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110113022251/http://www.ucl.ac.uk/chemistry/alumni/documents/A5booklet_020909.pdf |archivedate=13 January 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They demonstrated their process in the summer of 1909 by producing ammonia from air, drop by drop, at the rate of about {{convert|125|ml|USoz|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} per hour&lt;!--a cup every two hours--&gt;. The process was purchased by the German chemical company [[BASF]], which assigned [[Carl Bosch]] the task of scaling up Haber's tabletop machine to industrial-level production.&lt;ref name="hager"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bosch, Carl (2 March 1908) "Process of producing ammonia". {{US Patent|990191}}&lt;/ref&gt; He succeeded in 1910. Haber and Bosch were later awarded [[Nobel Prize|Nobel prizes]], in 1918 and 1931 respectively, for their work in overcoming the chemical and engineering problems of large-scale, continuous-flow, high-pressure technology.&lt;ref name="hager"/&gt;

Ammonia was first manufactured using the Haber process on an industrial scale in 1913 in BASF's [[Ludwigshafen#Oppau|Oppau]] plant in Germany, reaching 20 tonnes per day the following year.&lt;ref&gt;Philip, Phylis Morrison (2001) [https://web.archive.org/web/20120702093415/http://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/from-fertile-minds "From Fertile Minds" (review)]. ''American Scientist''.&lt;/ref&gt; During [[World War I]], the production of [[munitions]] required large amounts of nitrate. The Allies had access to large [[sodium nitrate]] deposits in [[Chile]] (Chile saltpetre) controlled by British companies. Germany had no such resources, so the Haber process proved essential to the German war effort.&lt;ref name="hager"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ny times"&gt;{{cite news|title=Nobel Award to Haber|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1920/02/03/118255924.pdf|accessdate=11 October 2010|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=3 February 1920}}&lt;/ref&gt; Synthetic ammonia from the Haber process was used for the production of [[nitric acid]], a precursor to the nitrates used in explosives.

[[File:Ammoniak Reaktor BASF.jpg|thumb|upright|A historical (1921) high-pressure steel reactor for production of ammonia via the Haber process is displayed at the [[Karlsruhe Institute of Technology]], Germany.]]
[[File:Ammoniakreaktor MS.svg|thumb|upright|scheme of ammoniac reactor]]
This conversion is typically conducted at {{convert|15|–|25|MPa|abbr=on|lk=on|atm psi}} and between {{convert|400|–|500|°C|°F|abbr=on}}, as the gases (nitrogen and hydrogen) are passed over four beds of [[catalyst]], with cooling between each pass so as to maintain a reasonable [[equilibrium constant]]. On each pass only about 15% conversion occurs, but any unreacted gases are recycled, and eventually an overall conversion of 97% is achieved.&lt;ref name=Appl/&gt;

The steam reforming, shift conversion, carbon dioxide removal, and methanation steps each operate at pressures of about {{convert|2.5|–|3.5|MPa|abbr=on|bar psi}}, and the ammonia synthesis loop operates at pressures ranging from {{convert|6|–|18|MPa|abbr=on|bar psi}}, depending upon which proprietary process is used.&lt;ref name=Appl/&gt;

===Sources of hydrogen===
The major source of hydrogen is [[methane]] from [[natural gas]]. The conversion, [[steam reforming]], is conducted with steam in a high temperature and pressure tube inside a reformer with a nickel catalyst, separating the carbon and hydrogen atoms in the natural gas.

===Reaction rate and equilibrium===
Nitrogen (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is very unreactive because the [[molecules]] are held together by strong [[Chemical bond|triple bonds]]. The Haber process relies on catalysts that accelerate the scission of this triple bond.

Two opposing considerations are relevant to this synthesis: the position of the equilibrium and the [[reaction rate|rate of reaction]]. At room temperature, the equilibrium is strongly in favor of ammonia, but the reaction doesn't proceed at a detectable rate. The obvious solution is to raise the temperature, but because the reaction is [[exothermic reaction|exothermic]], the equilibrium constant (using bar or [[atmosphere (unit)|atm]] units) becomes 1 around {{convert|150|–|200|°C|F|abbr=on}}. (See [[Le Châtelier's principle]].)

Above this temperature, the equilibrium quickly becomes quite unfavorable at atmospheric pressure, according to the [[Van 't Hoff equation]]. Thus one might suppose that a low temperature is to be used and some other means to increase rate. However, the catalyst itself requires a temperature of at least 400&amp;nbsp;°C to be efficient.

[[Pressure]] is the obvious choice to favor the forward reaction because there are 4&amp;nbsp;moles of reactant for every 2&amp;nbsp;moles of product (see [[entropy]]), and the pressure used ({{convert|15|–|25|MPa|abbr=on|bar psi}}) alters the equilibrium concentrations to give a profitable yield.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

Economically, pressure is an expensive commodity. Pipes, valves, and reaction vessels need to be strengthened, and there are safety considerations of working at 20&amp;nbsp;MPa. In addition, running pumps and compressors takes considerable energy. Thus the compromise used gives a single pass yield of around 15%.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

Another way to increase the yield of the reaction would be to remove the product (i.e. ammonia gas) from the system. In practice, gaseous ammonia is not removed from the reactor itself, since the temperature is too high; it is removed from the equilibrium mixture of gases leaving the reaction vessel. The hot gases are cooled enough, whilst maintaining a high pressure, for the ammonia to condense and be removed as liquid. Unreacted hydrogen and nitrogen gases are then returned to the reaction vessel to undergo further reaction.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

===Catalysts===
The most popular catalysts are based on iron promoted with K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, CaO, SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The original Haber–Bosch reaction chambers used [[osmium]] as the catalyst, but it was available in extremely small quantities. Haber noted [[uranium]] was almost as effective and easier to obtain than osmium. Under Bosch's direction in 1909, the BASF researcher [[Alwin Mittasch]] discovered a much less expensive [[iron]]-based catalyst, which is still used today. Some ammonia production utilizes [[ruthenium]]-based catalysts (the KAAP process). Ruthenium forms more active catalysts that allows milder operating pressures. Such catalysts are prepared by decomposition of [[triruthenium dodecacarbonyl]] on [[graphite]].&lt;ref name=Appl/&gt;

In industrial practice, the iron catalyst is obtained from finely ground iron powder, which is usually obtained by reduction of high purity [[magnetite]] (Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). The pulverized iron metal is burnt (oxidized) to give magnetite of a defined particle size. The magnetite particles are then partially reduced, removing some of the [[oxygen]] in the process. The resulting catalyst particles consist of a core of magnetite, encased in a shell of [[wüstite]] (FeO, ferrous oxide), which in turn is surrounded by an outer shell of iron metal. The catalyst maintains most of its bulk volume during the reduction, resulting in a highly porous high surface area material, which enhances its effectiveness as a catalyst. Other minor components of the catalyst include [[Calcium oxide|calcium]] and [[aluminium oxide]]s, which support the iron catalyst and help it maintain its surface area. These oxides of Ca, Al, K, and Si are unreactive to reduction by the hydrogen.&lt;ref name=Appl/&gt;

The [[reaction mechanism]], involving the heterogeneous catalyst, is believed to involve the following steps:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wennerström |first1=Håkan |last2=Lidin |first2=Sven |title=Scientific Background on the Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2007 Chemical Processes on Solid Surfaces |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2007/advanced-chemistryprize2007.pdf |website=NobelPrize.org |publisher=Swedish Academy of Sciences |accessdate=17 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (g) → N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (adsorbed)
# N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (adsorbed) → 2&amp;nbsp;N (adsorbed)
# H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (g) → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (adsorbed)
# H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (adsorbed) → 2&amp;nbsp;H (adsorbed)
# N (adsorbed) + 3&amp;nbsp;H(adsorbed)→ NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (adsorbed)
# NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (adsorbed) → NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (g)

Reaction 5 occurs in three steps, forming NH, NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and then NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Experimental evidence points to reaction 2 as being the slow, [[rate-determining step]]. This is not unexpected since the bond broken, the nitrogen triple bond, is the strongest of the bonds that must be broken.

A major contributor to the elucidation of this mechanism is [[Gerhard Ertl]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Interaction of nitrogen with iron surfaces: I.

When it was first invented, the Haber process needed to compete against another industrial process, the [[Frank–Caro process|Cyanamide process]]. However, the Cyanamide process consumed large amounts of electrical power and was more labor-intensive than the Haber process.&lt;ref name="hager"/&gt;{{rp|137–143}}

The Haber process now produces 450 million tonnes of nitrogen [[fertilizers|fertilizer]] per year, mostly in the form of anhydrous [[ammonia]], [[ammonium nitrate]], and [[urea]]. Three to five percent of the world's natural gas production is consumed in the Haber process (around 1–2% of the world's energy supply).&lt;ref name=Smil_2004_Enriching/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/ieo/nat_gas.html |title=International Energy Outlook 2007|publisher=U.S. Energy Information Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fertilizer statistics. {{cite web|url=http://www.fertilizer.org/ifa/statistics/indicators/ind_reserves.asp|title=Raw material reserves|publisher=International Fertilizer Industry Association|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080424083111/http://www.fertilizer.org/ifa/statistics/indicators/ind_reserves.asp|archivedate=24 April 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.1076659 |date=September 2002 |last= Smith |first= Barry E. |title = Structure.

{{nihongo|'''Ikutaro Kakehashi'''|梯 郁太郎|Kakehashi Ikutarō| 7 February 1930 – 1 April 2017}}, also known by the nickname '''Taro''',&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; was a Japanese engineer, inventor and entrepreneur. He founded the musical instrument manufacturers [[Ace Tone]], [[Roland Corporation]], and [[Boss Corporation]], and the audiovisual electronics company ATV Corporation.

Kakehashi founded Ace Tone in 1960 to produce [[electronic organ]]s and [[Drum machine|drum machines]]. He founded Roland in 1972 and was involved in the development of several influential electronic instruments, including the [[TR-808]] and [[TR-909]] drum machines and the [[TB-303]] bass synthesizer. He also was key to the development of [[MIDI]], a technical standard that connects a wide variety of electronic instruments, in the 1980s; in 2013, Kakehashi received a [[Technical Grammy Award]], shared with Dave Smith of Sequential Circuits, for the invention. His inventions are credited with shaping [[popular music]] genres such as [[Electronic music|electronic]], [[Dance music|dance]], [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], [[Contemporary R&amp;B|R&amp;B]], [[Rock music|rock]] and [[pop music]].&lt;ref name="fact"&gt;[http://www.factmag.com/2017/04/02/ikutaro-kakehashi-life/ The life and times of Ikutaro Kakehashi, the Roland pioneer modern music owes everything to], ''[[Fact (UK magazine)|Fact]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/apr/02/roland-founder-and-music-pioneer-ikutaro-kakehashi-dies-aged-87|title=Roland founder and music pioneer Ikutaro Kakehashi dies aged 87|first1=Ruth|last1=McKee|first2=Jamie|last2=Grierson|date=2 April 2017|publisher=|accessdate=29 May 2017|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/03/arts/music/ikutaro-kakeshashi-roland-808-drum-machine-dead.html|title=Ikutaro Kakehashi, Engineer Behind Revolutionary Drum Machine, Dies at 87|first=Jon|last=Pareles|date=3 April 2017|publisher=|accessdate=29 May 2017|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc-world"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqTGApbPIzk|title=BBC World Service tribute to the founder of Roland Corporation|first=|last=Creative Media|date=2 April 2017|publisher=|accessdate=29 May 2017|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://thump.vice.com/en_us/article/ikutaro-kakehashi-founder-of-roland-and-developer-of-the-tr-808-has-died-at-age-87 Ikutaro Kakehashi, Founder of Roland and Developer of the TR-808, Has Died at Age 87], ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="synthtopia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.synthtopia.com/content/2017/04/01/roland-founder-ikutaro-kakehashi-has-died/|title=Roland Founder Ikutaro Kakehashi Has Died|website=Synthtopia|accessdate=1 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spin.com/2017/04/ikutaro-kakehashi-roland-founder-and-music-pioneer-dies-at-87/ Ikutaro Kakehashi, Roland Founder and Music Pioneer, Dies at 87], ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sos_roland" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":52"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/slaves-to-the-rhythm-1.771508|title=Slaves to the rhythm|last=Anderson|first=Jason|date=27 November 2008|work=|access-date=16 January 2017|via=|newspaper=CBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="reverb"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://reverb.com/uk/news/tribute-ikutaro-kakehashi-and-rolands-impact-on-music|title=Tribute: Ikutaro Kakehashi and Roland's Impact on Music|website=reverb.com|accessdate=29 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
===Early life===
Kakehashi was born on 7 February 1930 in [[Osaka]], Japan.&lt;ref name="fact"/&gt; His parents died of [[tuberculosis]] during his early childhood,&lt;ref name="fact2016"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.factmag.com/2016/09/22/the-14-drum-machines-that-shaped-modern-music/|title=The 14 drum machines that shaped modern music|date=22 September 2016|publisher=|accessdate=29 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he was raised by his grandparents.&lt;ref name="fact"/&gt; Much of his childhood was spent studying [[electrical engineering]] and working in the [[Hitachi]] shipyards of Osaka.&lt;ref name="fact2016"/&gt; During [[World War II]], with no music lessons, Kekashi became interested in radio as a way of listening to music,&lt;ref name="fact" /&gt; and his home was destroyed by American bombing.&lt;ref name="fact"/&gt; Following the war, in 1946, he failed to get into [[university]] on health grounds, and moved to the southern island of [[Kyushu]].&lt;ref name="fact2016"/&gt;

In 1947, aged 16, Kakehashi founded the Kakehashi Clock Store, a watch repair shop. He soon began repairing [[radio]]s.&lt;ref name="fact2016" /&gt; He later returned to Osaka to attend university. During a mass food shortage, he contracted tuberculosis and spent several years in a [[Sanatorium|sanitarium]], where he became a [[clinical trial]] test patient for an [[experimental medicine]] [[antibiotic]] drug, [[Streptomycin]], which improved his condition.&lt;ref name="fact" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fact2016" /&gt; In 1954, Kakehashi opened the Kakehashi Radio electrical appliance store, in his spare time, he repaired [[electronic organ]]s and created prototype organs throughout the 1950s. At 28, he decided to devote himself to music and pursuit of the ideal [[electronic musical instrument]].

Kakehashi had no musical training, and wanted musical instruments to be accessible for professionals as well as amateurs like himself. He also wanted them to be inexpensive, intuitive, small, and simple. He constructed his first 49-key monophonic organ in 1959, specifically designed to be playable by anyone, with no musical skill necessary. The focus on miniaturization, affordability and simplicity later became fundamental to product development at Roland.&lt;ref name="fact"/&gt;

===Ace Tone===
{{See also|Ace Tone}}

In 1960, Kakehashi founded [[Ace Tone|Ace Electronic Industries Inc.]] In 1964, he developed a hand-operated [[electronic drums|electronic drum]], the R1 Rhythm Ace. It was exhibited at Summer [[NAMM]] 1964, however not commercialized. &lt;ref name="sos_roland"/&gt; Kakehashi patented the "Automatic Rhythm Performance Device" [[drum machine]] in 1967, a preset rhythm-pattern generator using ''diode matrix'' circuit, a [[drum machine]] where a "plurality of inverting circuits and/or clipper circuits are connected to a counting circuit to synthesize the output signal of the counting circuit" and the "synthesized output signal becomes a desired rhythm."&lt;ref name=uspat3651241&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ace Tone commercialized his preset rhythm machine, called the FR-1 Rhythm Ace, in 1967. It offered 16 preset patterns, and four buttons to manually play each instrument sound ([[cymbal]], [[claves]], [[cowbell]] and [[bass drum]]). The rhythm patterns could also be cascaded together by pushing multiple rhythm buttons simultaneously, and the possible combination of rhythm patterns were more than a hundred (on the later models of Rhythm Ace, the individual volumes of each instrument could be adjusted with the small knobs or faders). In 1968 a joint venture was established with Hammond USA, The FR-1 was adopted by the [[Hammond organ|Hammond Organ Company]] for incorporation within their latest organ models. In the US, the units were also marketed under the [[Multivox]] brand by Peter Sorkin Music Company, and in the UK, marketed under the Bentley Rhythm Ace brand. The unique artificial sounds characteristics of the FR-1 were similar to the later [[Roland Corporation|Roland]] rhythm machines, and featured on [[electropop]] music from the late 1970s onwards.&lt;ref name="sos_roland"&gt;{{citation |last=Reid |first=Gordon |year=2004 |title=The History Of Roland Part 1: 1930–1978 |journal=[[Sound on Sound]] |issue=November |url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/nov04/articles/roland.htm |accessdate=19 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roland===
{{See also|Roland Corporation}}

In 1972, Kakehashi founded the [[Roland Corporation]], and led it for four decades.&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt; While rival companies [[Moog Music|Moog]] and [[ARP Instruments|ARP]] targeted professional musicians and academics, Kakehashi, who had no musical training, wanted to appeal to amateurs and hobbyists, and focused on miniaturization, affordability, and simplicity.&lt;ref name="fact" /&gt;

During the 1980s and 1990s, Roland released several instruments that have had a lasting influence on popular music.&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt; After Kakehashi realized [[Microprocessor|microprocessors]] could be used to program drum machines,&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IbtJAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT72&amp;lpg=PT72&amp;dq=%22mark+vail%22+808&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=dOOpEyQGfI&amp;sig=nPF6yAIeQlupw3Pw0Drg6LE34r4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwir3b7qhsfRAhUFJcAKHfSNCyMQ6AEIHzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22mark%20vail%22%20808&amp;f=false|title=Keyboard Presents the Evolution of Electronic Dance Music|last=Kirn|first=Peter|publisher=Backbeat Books|year=2011|isbn=978-1-61713-446-3|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roland launched the [[Roland TR-808|TR-808]] drum machine, its first programmable drum machine, in 1980.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.factmag.com/2014/01/16/roland-tr-808-beginners-guide-everything-you-ever-wanted-to-know-introduction/|title=Everything you ever wanted to know about the Roland TR-808 but were afraid to ask|last=|first=|date=16 January 2014|website=Fact|publisher=|access-date=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kakehashi deliberately purchased faulty [[Transistor|transistors]] that created the machine's distinctive "sizzling" sound.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-808-heard-round-the-world|title=The 808 heard round the world|last=Norris|first=Chris|date=13 August 2015|website=The New Yorker|publisher=|access-date=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it was not an immediate commercial success, the 808 was eventually used on more hit records than any other drum machine&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Wells|first=Peter|title=A Beginner's Guide to Digital Video|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=stvOCfhc_igC&amp;pg=PA18|page=18|year=2004|publisher=AVA Books|isbn=2-88479-037-3|accessdate=20 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became a cornerstone of the emerging [[Electronic music|electronic]] and [[hip hop]] genres.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/slaves-to-the-rhythm-1.771508|title=Slaves to the rhythm|last=Anderson|first=Jason|date=27 November 2008|work=|newspaper=CBC News|access-date=16 January 2017|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been described as hip hop's equivalent to the [[Fender Stratocaster]] guitar, which dramatically influenced the development of [[rock music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/apr/02/roland-founder-and-music-pioneer-ikutaro-kakehashi-dies-aged-87|title=Roland founder and music pioneer Ikutaro Kakehashi dies aged 87|last=McKee|first=Ruth|last2=Grierson|first2=Jamie|date=2 April 2017|website=The Guardian|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/02/roland-resurrects-808/|title=Early hip-hop's greatest drum machine just got resurrected|last=Baldwin|first=Roberto|date=14 February 2014|work=|newspaper=Wired|access-date=4 January 2016|language=en-US|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/music_box/2008/12/whats_an_808.html|title=What's an 808?|last=Richards|first=Chris|date=2 December 2008|work=|newspaper=Slate|access-date=16 January 2016|language=en-US|issn=1091-2339|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 808 was followed in 1983 by the [[Roland TR-909|TR-909]],&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.soundonsound.com/people/history-roland-part-2|title=The history of Roland: part 2 {{!}} Sound On Sound|last=Reid|first=Gordon|date=December 2014|website=Sound on Sound|publisher=|access-date=3 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which, alongside the [[Roland TB-303|TB-303]] synthesizer, influenced the development of dance music such as [[techno]], [[House music|house]] and [[Acid house|acid]].&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://complex.com/music/2014/09/roland-tr-909-tracks/|title=Nine Great Tracks That Use the Roland TR-909|website=Complex|language=en|access-date=2018-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mixmag.net/feature/909-tracks-using-the-tr-909|title=9 of the best 909 tracks using the TR-909|work=Mixmag|access-date=2018-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, Kakehashi was awarded an [[honorary doctorate]] from [[Berklee College of Music]] for his contribution to the development and popularization of electronic instruments. The Bentley-branded Rhythm Ace inspired the 1997 Birmingham band [[Bentley Rhythm Ace]] when a model was found at a [[car boot sale]]. 

In 2000, Kekahashi left his handprints at [[Guitar Center#Hollywood's RockWalk|Hollywood's RockWalk]] in [[Hollywood]]. In 2002, Kakehashi published an autobiography, ''I Believe In Music'',&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN|0634037838}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was featured as a biography in the book ''The Art of Digital Music''. As of 2002, Kakehashi was awarded about 50 [[patent]]s, since the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Ikutaro Kakehashi (2002), [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=09Z8a0lKyPcC ''I Believe in Music: Life Experiences and Thoughts on the Future of Electronic Music by the Founder of the Roland Corporation''], page 283&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, he was awarded the title of professor emeritus of the Central Music College of China and the University of Glamorgan.

'''John Eleuthère du Pont''' (November 22, 1938 – December 9, 2010) was an American [[philanthropy|philanthropist]], heir to the [[Du Pont family]] fortune, and a convicted murderer.&lt;ref name=nytobit/&gt; He had been a published [[ornithology|ornithologist]], [[philately|philatelist]], [[conchology|conchologist]], sports [[enthusiast]], and self-styled wrestling coach.

In 1972, du Pont founded and directed the [[Delaware Museum of Natural History]] and contributed to [[Villanova University]] and other institutions.&lt;ref name=nytobit/&gt;

In the 1980s, he established a wrestling facility at his [[William du Pont Jr.#Foxcatcher Farm|Foxcatcher Farm]] after becoming interested in the sport and the [[pentathlon]] events. He became a prominent supporter of [[amateur sports]] in the United States and a sponsor of [[USA Wrestling]].

In the 1990s, friends and acquaintances were concerned about his erratic and paranoid behavior, but his wealth shielded him.&lt;ref name="Longman"/&gt;

On February 25, 1997, he was convicted of [[third-degree murder#Pennsylvania|murder in the third degree]] for the January 26, 1996, shooting death of [[Dave Schultz (wrestling)|Dave Schultz]], an Olympic champion [[Freestyle wrestling|freestyle wrestler]] living and working on du Pont's estate.

He was the only member of the [[Forbes 400]] richest Americans ever to be convicted of murder.

Du Pont is the subject of the [[Academy Award]] nominated film ''[[Foxcatcher]],'' in which he is portrayed by [[Steve Carell]], who earned an Oscar nomination for his performance.

==Early life==
[[File:John du Pont at the University of Pennsylvania.jpg|thumb|John du Pont (pictured bottom left) during his time at the [[University of Pennsylvania]]]]
John du Pont was born on November 22, 1938, in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], the youngest of four children of [[William du Pont, Jr.]] and Jean Liseter Austin (1897–1988). He grew up at Liseter Hall, a mansion built in 1922 in [[Newtown Township, Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Newtown Square, Pennsylvania]], by his maternal grandfather on more than 200 acres of land given to his parents at their wedding by his maternal grandfather.&lt;ref name="mid-atlantic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marylandthoroughbred.com/midatlantic/current/lead_article_05/sept_lead_article_05.htm|title=Last hurrah for historic Liseter Hall Farm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726085931/http://www.marylandthoroughbred.com/midatlantic/current/lead_article_05/sept_lead_article_05.htm|archivedate=2011-07-26|publisher=Mid-Atlantic Thoroughbred|date= September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both his parents' families had emigrated from Europe to the United States at the beginning of the 19th century and became highly successful.

During the 1920s and 1930s, the couple acquired more land and developed Liseter Hall Farm for Thoroughbred breeding, showing, and racing. His mother retained Liseter Hall Farm after the couple divorced in 1941. She added a dairy herd of [[Guernsey cattle|Guernseys]] and bred [[Welsh pony|Welsh ponies]] at the farm. John was 2 when his parents divorced. He had two older sisters, Jean and Evelyn, an older brother Henry E. I. du Pont, and a younger half brother, William du Pont III, born of their father's second marriage.

Du Pont graduated from [[Haverford School]] in 1957. He attended the [[University of Pennsylvania]] where he belonged to the [[Zeta Psi]] fraternity, and withdrew before completing his freshman year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bowden|first1=Mark|last2=Bensen|first2=Clea|title=The Prince Of Newtown Square John Du Pont Had Millions But Lacked The Thing He Really Wanted: Expertise.

During an October 2015 podcast, [[Mark Schultz (wrestler)|Mark Schultz]] revealed that when John was about 30 years old, a horse he was riding threw him onto a fence, injuring his [[testicles]].

Du Pont was also a [[Philately|philatelist]]. Bidding anonymously in a 1980 auction, he paid $935,000 for one of the rarest stamps in the world, the [[British Guiana]] 1856 [[British Guiana 1c magenta|1c black on magenta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Rachlin | first= Harvey | title=Lucy's Bones, Sacred Stones, and Einstein's Brain: The Remarkable Stories Behind the Great Artifacts of History, From Antiquity to the Modern Era| publisher=[[Henry Holt and Company]] | year=1996 | isbn=0-8050-6406-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his death, this stamp was sold at auction for $9.5 million (inclusive of buyer's premium) at Sotheby's June 17, 2014.

===Athletics===
After his mother's death, du Pont developed the {{convert|440|acre|km2|adj=on}} Liseter Hall Farm in [[Newtown Township, Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Newtown Square]] as a high-quality wrestling facility for amateur wrestlers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sos-pa.com/ |title=The Value of Open Space, Save Open Space, Everything Old is New Again |work=Save Open Space |date=April 1999 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110208135541/http://sos-pa.com/ |archivedate=February 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He called the private group "Team Foxcatcher," after his father's noted racing stable. Du Pont established an Olympic swimming and wrestling training center and sponsored competitive events at the estate. He also allowed some people, such as Olympic champion wrestlers [[Mark Schultz (wrestler)|Mark Schultz]] and later his older brother [[Dave Schultz (wrestling)|Dave Schultz]] and his wife, to live in houses on the grounds for years. Dave Schultz also coached the Foxcatcher team.

Du Pont became a sponsor in wrestling, swimming, track, and the [[modern pentathlon]]. He was also involved in promoting a subset of the modern pentathlon (run, swim, shoot) as a separate event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1080219/index.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140303001523/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1080219/index.htm|archivedate=2014-03-03| author=Alice Higgins|title=Trials Of A Busy Pentathlete: Young John du Pont, host to the national championships, found that organizing the event could be a handicap for a dedicated competitor|publisher=Sports Illustrated|date=August 28, 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historicnewtownsquare.org/ns/history/bookonline/part_3_11.asp Chapter XI: "20th-Century Personages and the Arts"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726151845/http://www.historicnewtownsquare.org/ns/history/bookonline/part_3_11.asp |date=July 26, 2011 }}, ''Historic Newtown Square'', Newtown Square Historical Preservation Society&lt;/ref&gt; He took up athletics and became a competitive wrestler in his 50s.

==Lawsuit==
In August 1988, a problem-plagued wrestling program he funded at Villanova was shut down after just two years. In December 1988, a lawsuit (which was settled out of court) claimed du Pont had made improper sexual advances to Villanova assistant coach Andre Metzger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://time.com/3586290/blood-on-the-mat/|title=Blood on the Mat: The killing of an Olympic gold medalists suggest that John du Pont, patron of wrestling, was no angel|author=John Greenwald|date=February 5, 1996|publisher=Time Magazine|others=Mubarak Dahir, Sharon E.

==Murder of Dave Schultz==
On January 26, 1996, du Pont shot and killed [[Dave Schultz (wrestling)|Dave Schultz]] in the driveway of Schultz's home on du Pont's {{convert|800|acre|km2|adj=on}} estate. Schultz's wife Nancy and du Pont's head of security Patrick Goodale were present and witnessed the crime. The security chief was sitting in the passenger seat of du Pont's car when du Pont fired three bullets into Schultz. Police did not establish a motive. Schultz had worked with du Pont to coach the wrestling team for years.&lt;ref name="Longman"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Longman |first1=Jere|last2=Belluck|first2=Pam |last3=Nordheimer |first3=Jon|title=For du Pont Heir, Question Was Control|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/04/us/a-life-in-pieces-for-du-pont-heir-question-was-control.html |work=The New York Times|date=February 4, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Du Pont's friends said the shooting was uncharacteristic. Joy Hansen Leutner, a triathlete from [[Hermosa Beach, California]], lived for two years on the estate.&lt;ref name="Harvey"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-01-31/sports/sp-35663_1|page=2|author=Randy Harvey|title=Signposts to a Tragedy – Du Pont Heir|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=January 31, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leutner said du Pont helped her through a stressful period in the mid-1980s. She later said, "With my family and friends, John gave me a new lease on life. He gave more than money; he gave himself emotionally." She expressed incredulity about the killing. She is quoted as saying: "There's no way John in his right mind would have killed Dave."&lt;ref name="Longman"/&gt; [[Newtown Township, Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Newtown Township]] supervisor John S.

Pirro|title=In Memory of a Murder|work=MainLine Today|publisher=Today Media|date=January 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charles King, Sr., a du Pont stable hand and manager for 30 years, claimed he knew du Pont well throughout his life. King's son, Charles "Chuckie" King Jr., said he considered du Pont his friend during his childhood.

Many people had noticed du Pont's increasingly disruptive behavior in the months before the murder.&lt;ref name="Harvey" /&gt;&lt;!-- page 3 of 3 --&gt; Charles King Sr. blames du Pont's "security consultant", Patrick Goodale, for influencing what happened. King said, "I don't think John could shoot someone unless he was pushed to, or was on drugs. After that guy started hanging around him, my son always said Johnny changed. He was scared of everything. He was always a little off. But I never had problems with him, and my son never had problems."&lt;ref name="In Memory of a Murder"/&gt; After the shooting, du Pont locked himself in his mansion for two days while he negotiated with police on the telephone. Police turned off his power and were able to capture him when he went outside to fix his heater. In September 1996, du Pont was ruled incompetent to stand trial, as experts testified that he was [[psychotic]] and could not participate in his own defense. He was committed to a mental hospital and his condition was to be reviewed by the court in three months.&lt;ref name="ap"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-09-25/news/mn-47411_1_john-e-du-pont |agency=Associated Press|title=Du Pont Is Ruled Incompetent for Trial in Killing of Wrestler|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=25 September 1996|accessdate=15 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the trial, one of the defense's expert [[psychiatric]] witnesses described du Pont as a [[schizophrenia|paranoid schizophrenic]] who believed Schultz was part of an international conspiracy to kill him.&lt;ref name="vigoda"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vigoda|first1=Ralph|last2=Ordine|first2=Bill|title=Defense Doctors: Du Pont Feared He Was Target Of Conspiracy He Worried About The Russians, One Said.

Du Pont pleaded "not guilty by reason of insanity." The insanity defense was thrown out by the court, and on February 25, 1997, a jury found him guilty of [[third-degree murder#Pennsylvania|third-degree murder]] but [[mentally ill]].&lt;ref name=cnn&gt;{{ cite web |author=[[CNN]] |title=Du Pont guilty but mentally ill in Olympic wrestler's murder |date=25 February 1997 |url=http://www.cnn.com/US/9702/25/dupont.verdict/reax.html |accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Pennsylvania, third-degree murder is a lesser charge than first-degree (intentional) or second-degree (a passionate killing or a killing occurring during the perpetration of a felony), and indicates a lack of intent to kill.

The jury verdict of "guilty but mentally ill" meant the sentencing would be referred to the judge, Patricia Jenkins. She could have sentenced du Pont to 5 to 40 years. Du Pont was sentenced to 13 to 30 years' incarceration and was housed at the [[State Correctional Institution – Mercer]], a minimum-security institution in the Pennsylvania prison system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/14/us/heir-sentenced-up-to-30-years-for-killing-of-olympic-wrestler.html|title=Heir Sentenced Up to 30 Years For Killing of Olympic Wrestler|publisher=The New York Times|date=May 14, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Du Pont was initially confined to [[State Correctional Institution – Cresson|Cresson Correctional Institute]].&lt;ref name="mid-atlantic"/&gt; Following the guilty verdict, Nancy Schultz, Dave's widow, filed a wrongful death lawsuit against du Pont. The amount of the settlement was not disclosed. ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'', citing anonymous sources, reported du Pont was to pay Schultz at least $35 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Du Pont, Wrestler's Widow Settle Suit|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/WPcap/1999-11/28/063r-112899-idx.html|publisher=Washington Post|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Du Pont's attorneys filed appeals. In 2000, his case reached the U.S. Supreme Court, which upheld the verdict. Du Pont was first eligible for parole on January 29, 2009; it was denied. Du Pont's maximum sentence would have ended on January&amp;nbsp;29, 2026, when he would have been 87.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsweek.com/id/151512 What Ever Happened to: Imprisoned Chemical Heir John du Pont?].

==Philanthropy and institutions==
Du Pont founded the [[Delaware Museum of Natural History]] in 1957, which opened to the public in 1972 on a site near [[Winterthur, Delaware|Winterthur]] donated by his relative [[Henry Francis du Pont]]. John du Pont served on the board for many years. He also helped fund a new [[basketball]] arena at [[Villanova University]], which opened in 1986. Originally it was called the John Eleuthère du Pont Pavilion, but after his conviction, his name was removed from the facility. Today it is called [[The Pavilion]].

===Foxcatcher Farm===
After his mother's death in 1988, du Pont assumed stewardship of Liseter Farm and renamed it "Foxcatcher Farm" after his father's famed [[Thoroughbred]] racing stable.&lt;ref name=mdhorse&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marylandthoroughbred.com/midatlantic/current/lead_article_05/sept_lead_article_05.htm |author=Michael Yockel|title=Last hurrah for historic Liseter Hall Farm|publisher=Mid-Atlantic Thoroughbred|date=September 2005|accessdate=October 23, 2005|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325183033/http://www.marylandthoroughbred.com/midatlantic/current/lead_article_05/sept_lead_article_05.htm|archivedate=2012-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; John never lived in the manor house; he occupied a smaller house on the estate.

After his arrest, du Pont sold off the dairy herd, nearly 70 [[Guernsey cattle|Guernseys]], in the fall of 1996. He ordered all the buildings at Foxcatcher Farm to be painted a matte black. The Delaware Museum of Natural History, which du Pont formerly headed and which held the dairy farm in trust, sold that portion in January 1998 after his conviction and sentencing to prison. A {{Convert|123|acre|km2|adj=mid}} segment is now occupied by the campus of the [[Episcopal Academy]], a private independent K–12 school founded in 1785, which moved there in 2008 from split campuses located in the nearby [[Philadelphia Main Line]] communities of [[Merion, Pennsylvania|Merion]] and [[Devon, Pennsylvania|Devon]].&lt;ref&gt;Gammage, Jeff [http://articles.philly.com/2007-10-21/news/25233421_1_episcopal-leaders-rohm-haas-campus "Episcopal Academy prepped for big change Expansion trumps angst over move from Merion"], ''Philadelphia Inquirer'', October 21, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The 90-year-old du Pont mansion, Liseter Hall, in which du Pont was raised and had lived for 57 years, was demolished by Glenn Miller Demolition in January 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Bannan, Pete [http://www.mainlinemedianews.com/articles/2013/01/25/main_line_suburban_life/news/doc510172af81da4619756296.txt "Historic DuPont mansion goes under the wrecker's ball"] ''Main Line Media News'', January 25, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The mansion stood on a {{Convert|400|acre|km2|adj=mid}} portion of the property that is now being developed by [[Toll Brothers]] into a "master planned community of 449 luxury homes" called "Liseter Estate."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prweb.com/releases/2012/11/prweb10145149.htm "Liseter Estate at Route 252 and Goshen Road in Newtown Square to be Developed by Toll Brothers"] PRWeb, November 20, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the outbuildings were torn down, though an existing 7,000-square-foot historical barn will be used as a clubhouse in the new development.

In June 2011, du Pont's niece Beverly A. du Pont Gauggel and nephew William H. du Pont filed a petition to challenge the will in [[Media, Pennsylvania]], asserting that du Pont was not "[[Non compos mentis|of sound mind]]" when he made his will. The petition claims that during that period, John du Pont asserted alternately that he was [[Jesus Christ]], the [[Dalai Lama]], and a Russian [[tsar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://delcotimes.com/articles/2011/06/15/news/doc4df80d533d6a9358592494.txt?viewmode=fullstory|author=Alex Rose|title=Du Pont Relatives Contest Validity of Late Killer's Will|publisher=Delaware County Daily Times|date=June 15, 2011|accessdate=June 15, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311063815/http://delcotimes.com/articles/2011/06/15/news/doc4df80d533d6a9358592494.txt?viewmode=fullstory|archive-date=March 11, 2012|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Levie Jacob "Louis" Fles''' (19 October 1872 – 24 May 1940) was a Dutch businessman, activist and author. He is best known for writing and [[broadcasting]] against [[Zionism]], [[Nazism]], and organized religion. A self-described [[Freethought|freethinker]], Fles was a vocal supporter of [[Humanism]] and [[Jews|Jewish]] [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]]. His relationship with the [[Social Democratic Workers' Party (Netherlands)|Dutch Social Democratic Workers' Party]] was  more problematic. While he generally supported the ideals of [[socialism]], he wrote extensively about his disagreements with the party as well. After a life filled with personal tragedy and devotion to political and social activism, Fles committed [[suicide]] in May 1940, only a few weeks after the German occupation of the Netherlands.

==Family life==
[[File:Maassluis centrum.jpg|thumb|left|Maassluis Center]]
Louis Fles was born in [[Maassluis]], Netherlands on 19 October 1871 to Jewish parents. His father, Jacob Levie Fles, worked as a diamond cutter, and his mother, Saartje van Blijdestein, ran a hosiery shop, placing young Louis squarely in the newly expanding merchant class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gans|first1=Evelien|title=Fles, Levie|url=http://bwsa.socialhistory.org/biografie/fles|website=Biografisch Woordenboek van het Socialisme en de Arbeidersbeweging in Nederland|accessdate=27 September 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150926232224/http://bwsa.socialhistory.org/biografie/fles|archivedate=26 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his father died in 1873 his mother married a man named Swaab. Upon his mother's death in 1878, Louis was taken in and raised by his stepfather's family.&lt;ref name="Gans" /&gt; As a successful business owner himself, Swaab took the young Louis into his company shortly after the boy had completed primary school.&lt;ref name=BWSA&gt;{{cite web|title=Fles, Levie|url=http://bwsa.socialhistory.org/biografie/fles|website=BWSA|publisher=Biografisch Woordenboek van het Socialisme en de Arbeidersbeweging in Nederland|accessdate=26 September 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150926232224/http://bwsa.socialhistory.org/biografie/fles|archivedate=26 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 August 1896 Fles married Zipporah van Straten in the city of [[Rotterdam]]. They had six children; Mina, Rosine, Henriette, Clara, [[Barthold Fles|Barthold]], and [[George Fles|George]]. Barthold became a successful literary agent in [[New York City]] in the [[United States]]. George worked as a translator in the [[Soviet Union]] during the regime of [[Joseph Stalin]]. In 1938 George was arrested as a political dissident due to his [[Trotskyism|Trotskyite]] sympathies.&lt;ref name=Gans&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gans|first1=E.E.|title=De kleine verschillen die het leven uitmaken. Een historische studie naar joodse sociaal-democraten en socialistisch-zionisten in Nederland|url=http://dare.uva.nl/record/1/225584|website=UvA-DARE (Digital Academic Repository)|publisher=University of Amsterdam|accessdate=27 September 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925230114/http://dare.uva.nl/document/2/30666|archivedate=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon hearing of George's arrest, Louis travelled to Moscow, but was unable to find his son before his visa expired. George died in prison in 1939.&lt;ref name="Gans" /&gt; Around this same time news arrived from the United States that daughter Rosine had died shortly after giving birth.&lt;ref name="Gans" /&gt;

Fles was widely known as an opponent of Nazism when the German army occupied the Netherlands in May 1940. Even so, it was a shock to many of his family members when, on 25 May 1940, Levie Jacob "Louis" Fles committed suicide by means of pills acquired from a pharmacist in [[Keppel, Netherlands|Keppel]].&lt;ref name="Gans" /&gt; He was buried in [[Amsterdam]] in [[Zorgvlied (cemetery)|Zorgvlied Cemetery]].&lt;ref name="BWSA" /&gt;

==Business==
[[File:Museum Wilhelmsbau Klein-Adler typewriter pic2.JPG|thumb|left|Museum Wilhelmsbau, Klein-Adler typewriter]]

Fles began working in his stepfather's office shortly after completing primary school. Soon, however, he went into business for himself.  He gave lessons in French, English, and German before passing the accounting examination. This allowed him to become a bookkeeper for the [[Bank of Amsterdam]].&lt;ref name=JA&gt;{{cite web|title=personen &gt; levie jacob fles|url=http://rotterdam.joodsamsterdam.nl/persfleslevie.htm|website=naar joodsamsterdam|publisher=Joodsamsterdam.nl|accessdate=27 September 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110816173505/http://rotterdam.joodsamsterdam.nl/persfleslevie.htm|archivedate=20 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With these experiences as a foundation, Fles soon founded his own company.&lt;ref name="BWSA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JA" /&gt; Fles &amp; Company had many interests, all related to serving the needs of other businesses. These included advertising and publishing, as well as the import and sale of high-end German-made Adler typewriters.&lt;ref name="JA" /&gt;&lt;ref name=type&gt;{{cite web|title=Adler|url=http://www.typewritermuseum.org/collection/index.php3?machine=adler15&amp;cat=kf|website=The Virtual Typewriter Museum|accessdate=27 September 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141125143813/http://www.typewritermuseum.org/collection/index.php3?machine=adler15&amp;cat=kf|archivedate=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The addition of a highly successful line of office furniture helped the company expand and establish branch offices throughout the Netherlands.&lt;ref name="Gans" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JA" /&gt;

The rise of Nazism in Germany presented both moral and practical problems for the importer of German goods. In 1933, Fles published the brochure ''Hitler, hervormer of misdadiger?'' (''Hitler, reformer or criminal?'') in which he called for a [[boycott]] on the importation of all German goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fles|first1=Levie|title=Hitler, hervormer of misdadiger?|date=1933|publisher=Fles &amp; Company|page=87|accessdate=27 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fles sold his business and retired in 1934.&lt;ref name="Gans" /&gt;

==Activism==

===Writing===
Fles' earliest published pamphlets, ''Is in de moderne boekhouding plaats voor het copieboek?'' (''Can copybooks serve a function in modern accounting?'') (1918) and ''Efficiency'' (1922), were both related to the world of business.&lt;ref name="Gans" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JA" /&gt; However, Louis Fles is better known for his extensive writings on politics, religion, and education. As early as 1917, ''[[De Groene Amsterdammer]]'' printed his criticism of the way Social Democratic Workers' Party (SDAP) allowed churches to influence the Dutch educational system. In this article, he accused the SDAP of having "sacrificed children to politics".&lt;ref name="BWSA" /&gt;

Later writings continued to criticize both political and religious authorities. In ''Kalenderhervorming, Sjabbat en Kerk'' (''Calendar Reform, Shabbat and Church'') (1930), Fles first observed that clinging to cultural and religious practices that set Jewish people apart from the surrounding Dutch culture served to feed the [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] narrative of Jews as foreigners. He then went on to propose alternative activities families might engage in, such as visiting a museum or other educational pursuits&lt;ref name="Gans" /&gt; and admonished his reader, ''"durf vrij te denken"'', "Dare to think freely."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fles|first1=Levie|title=Kalenderhervorming, Sjabbat en Kerk|date=1930|publisher=Fles and Company|location=Amsterdam, Netherlands|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He expanded upon these ideas in ''Water en vuur'' (''Water and Fire'') (1931). Religion, Fles wrote, was as antithetical to [[socialism]] as water was to fire. Here Fles repeated his accusation that the government deferred too much to religious—particularly [[Catholic]]—authorities, especially in the area of children's education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fles|first1=Levie|title=Water en vuur|date=1931|publisher=Fles and Company|location=Amsterdam|pages=9–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Henri Polak, geschilderd door Johan van Caspel.jpg|thumb|[[Henri Polak]] painted by {{Interlanguage link multi|Johan van Caspel|nl}} (1912)]]
In 1933 Fles used a [[pseudonym]], Dr. W. Bottema C. Az, to publish ''Hitler, hervormer of misdadiger?'' (''Hitler, reformer or criminal?'').&lt;ref name="BWSA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JA" /&gt; Here Fles enumerated and described the treatment of Jewish people under the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi regime]], and declared that "every relationship with Germany, in the area of commerce, art, science, sports and traffic should be discontinued, so that Germany is economically and otherwise crushed."&lt;ref name="Gans" /&gt; Fles would later put this sentiment into practice.  He sold his business that depended largely upon selling imported German merchandise,&lt;ref name="Gans" /&gt; and, in 1936, served on the planning committee for ''De Olympiade Onder Dictatuur'' (The Olympiad under Dictatorship), which served as counter to the summer [[Olympic Games|Olympics]] being held in Berlin.&lt;ref name="Gans" /&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite web|last1=Riding|first1=Alan|authorlink=Alan Riding|title=Dutch Re-Create a 1936 Anti-Nazi Art Show|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/23/arts/dutch-re-create-a-1936-anti-nazi-art-show.html|website=New York Times|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=28 September 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150526170435/http://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/23/arts/dutch-re-create-a-1936-anti-nazi-art-show.html|archivedate=26 May 2015|date=23 April 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Fles carried on correspondences with other leading thinkers of his day, including an extended debate with [[Henri Polak]] regarding the nature of socialism and Fles' determined opposition to [[Zionism]].&lt;ref name="Gans" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BWSA" /&gt; Fles felt himself to be Dutch, and saw Zionism as further separating Jews from their non-Jewish Dutch neighbors while reinforcing the image of the Jew as a foreigner. Instead, Fles favored assimilation into the cultures in which Jews found themselves. He endorsed mixed marriages to accelerate this process.&lt;ref name="Gans" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BWSA" /&gt; Fles gathered many of his thoughts from this correspondence into the 1939 pamphlet ''Weg met het zionisme!'' (''Down with Zionism!'').

===Broadcasting===
[[File:Protest Dageraad volkstelling.jpg|thumb|Action by Rotterdam freethinkers of De Dageraad against the 1930 census. The goal was to persuade people to have themselves registered as "unchurched" and "not religious", and thus reduce public subsidy of church associations.

The Dutch state annually pays 2,411,347.59 guilders to all the church associations, also from your tax money. 1930–31 Census. So fill in Question 4A with NO! Question 4B with church association? NONE!"]]
Fles became involved with ''Vrijdenkers Radio Omroep (VRO)'' (Freethinkers Radio Broadcasting), which had been established in 1928 as an outreach program of the freethinkers' association ''[[De Vrije Gedachte|De Dageraad]] (The Dawn)''. In 1929, the newly established Dutch Radio Broadcasting Control Commission labeled the group's material as subversive,&lt;ref name="Gans" /&gt; and began to monitor its broadcasts closely. Fles' radio speech ''Los van de kerk'' (''Free from the Church'') was banned altogether, and many other broadcasts were censored for their subversive content, although they later found an audience in print form.&lt;ref name="Gans" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BWSA" /&gt;

In 1933 Fles challenged the secretary of the Radio Broadcasting Control Commission regarding the lack of support VRO received from the government. He pointed out that the 1930 census had shown that the number of "unchurched" citizens had risen sharply, and, since this was VRO's intended audience, it should receive commensurate support. However, in that same year broadcast content restrictions were sharply tightened and, in 1936, VRO's broadcasting license was revoked. However, documents from the organization show that Fles was elected to the VRO's general board, showing that the organization continued to work toward regaining the right to broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Bert Gasenbeek |author2=Hans Blom |author3=Jo Nabuurs |date=2006 |title=God noch autoriteit. Geschiedenis van de vrijdenkersbeweging in Nederland |publisher=Boom |location=Amersfoort |ISBN=9085063582 |page=142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Olympiad Under Dictatorship===
When the 1936 Olympic games in Berlin were declared off limits to Jews and other groups that the Nazi government deemed undesirable, Fles was among a group of Dutch businessmen and politicians who organized ''De Olympiade Onder Dictatuur'' ("The Olympiad Under Dictatorship") both to showcase the artists of the Netherlands and to protest the policies of the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]].&lt;ref name="Gans" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; Organizers of the exhibition included Fles' friend and correspondent [[Henri Polak]], as well as other left-leaning Dutch leaders.&lt;ref name="BWSA" /&gt; The committee made it clear that their exhibition was as much about protesting the Nazis' manipulation of the arts and sciences for political purposes as it was about showcasing Dutch excellence.  Artists from neighboring countries and even German artists who had fled the Nazi regime were invited to participate. The initials of the name itself spell out ''D.O.O.D'', or "death" in Dutch.&lt;ref name="Gans" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;

The travelling exhibition opened on 1 August 1936 amid much controversy. In Amsterdam, the use of public buildings was prohibited, and in Rotterdam, the show was closed down after only a few days. Nineteen works were considered by the Dutch government to be too insulting to Hitler and were removed from display. The German consul himself characterized the event as "sheer provocation", showing that the committee's efforts had not escaped official German notice. Many of the organizers and participants went to prison or were executed after German forces occupied the Netherlands in 1940.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;

In 1996, in celebration of the 60th anniversary of the D.O.O.D., the Amsterdam Municipal Archives allowed a number of the works from the original exhibition to be displayed at the Sports Museum in [[Berlin]], Germany.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;

'''Marco Börries''' (born 1 August 1968) is a German IT entrepreneur. He is best known as the founder of [[Star Division]], who developed [[StarOffice]], which later became [[OpenOffice.org]].

== Career ==

Inspired by a student exchange program to [[Silicon Valley]] while he attended the {{ill|Gymnasium Oedeme|de}}, Marco Börries founded [[Star Division]] as a garage company in Lüneburg at the age of 16. As its first product the company distributed [[StarWriter (word processor)|StarWriter]], a [[word processor]] application developed by friends,&lt;ref name="Vermes_1999"/&gt; as an alternative to [[Microsoft]]'s office package. StarWriter later became [[StarOffice]] (and thereby was the foundation to [[OpenOffice.org|OpenOffice]] and [[LibreOffice]]).

StarOffice was sold over 25 million times. On 5 August 1999 Börries sold Star Division to [[Sun Microsystems]], where Börries also subsequently briefly employed.&lt;ref name="heise /&gt;&lt;ref name="chip" /&gt;

In parallel to Star Division Börries also founded the Hamburg-based company Star&amp;nbsp;Finanz as a [[joint venture]] with [[Deutscher Sparkassen- und Giroverband|Deutsche Sparkassen-Organisation]], a German savings bank.&lt;ref name="Hofmann_2014"/&gt; With [[StarMoney]] the company grew to become a significant provider of [[home banking]] software in the years following. In early 2001, Börries sold his shares in this company as well.&lt;ref name="Behr_2001"/&gt;

In August 2001, Börries founded [[VerdiSoft]] and served as its CEO. The company developed the [[Yahoo! Go]] technology to enable [[mobile phone]]s to have screen-optimized access to emails, photos, messages and other web content. VerdiSoft including its technology know-how was sold to [[Yahoo]] in February 2005, where Börries worked as an Executive Vice President in the ''Connected Life'' division until April 2009.&lt;ref name="Kuri_2009"/&gt;

Until 2008 Börries lived with his wife and three children in California,&lt;ref name="Lemm_2005"/&gt; but then moved to Hamburg and Berlin in Germany.

On 1 September 2009, Marco Börries launched his latest business idea, NumberFour AG, based in Berlin. The company developed an open software platform ([[Platform as a Service|PaaS]]) for the development, distribution and marketing of [[vertical solution]]s for [[small business]]es. After four years of development, Börries gathered 38 million USDs from financial investors in mid 2013.&lt;ref name="Hofmann_2014"/&gt; Renamed enfore&amp;nbsp;AG, the company launched a platform for small business in March 2017 connecting online services, software and hardware ([[Point-of-sale|PoS]] terminals).&lt;ref name="Hüsing_2017"/&gt;

Other entrepreneurial activities that did not lead to market entries were Adhoc Mobile GmbH, founded in 2009, and Mag10 GmbH, founded in 2010. This was a company to develop a solution for tablet publishing, but was shelved at the end of 2011.&lt;ref name="Treiß_2012"/&gt;

'''Mary Maxwell Gates''' (July 5, 1929 – June 10, 1994) was an American businesswoman, and served 18 years (1975–1993) on the [[University of Washington]] [[board of regents]].&lt;ref name=setmobt&gt;{{cite web|last=Andrews|first=Paul|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19940610&amp;slug=1914904|title=Mary Gates dies - cancer claims longtime Seattle civic leader and mother Of Microsoft founder Bill Gates|newspaper=Seattle Times|date=June 10, 1994|accessdate=May 2, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603072550/http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19940610&amp;slug=1914904|archivedate=June 3, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nytobt&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/11/obituaries/mary-gates-64-helped-her-son-start-microsoft.html|title=Mary Gates, 64; helped her son start Microsoft|newspaper=New York Times|agency=(obituary)|date=June 11, 1994|accessdate=May 2, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160420102313/http://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/11/obituaries/mary-gates-64-helped-her-son-start-microsoft.html|archivedate=April 20, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=spokrvobt&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=321XAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=bfEDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1705%2C52800 |newspaper=Spokesman-Review |location=Spokane, Washington |agency=Associated Press |title=Long cancer battle claims Mary Gates |date=June 11, 1994 |page=A10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was the first female president of [[King County, Washington|King County]]'s [[United Way of America|United Way]], the first woman to chair the national United Way’s executive committee where she served most notably with [[IBM]]'s CEO, [[John Opel]], and the first woman on the First Interstate Bank of Washington's [[board of directors]]. Her son [[Bill Gates]] is the co-founder of [[Microsoft]].&lt;ref name=setmobt/&gt;

==Personal life==
Gates was born in [[Seattle]], Washington, as '''Mary Maxwell''' to James Willard Maxwell ([[Nebraska]], 1901–1960), a [[banker]], and his wife, whom he married in c. 1927, Adele Thompson (born c. 1903, probably born in [[Enumclaw]], Washington).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=James Wallace|author2=Jim Erickson|title=Hard drive: Bill Gates and the making of the Microsoft empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XdYOGBhp0SAC|accessdate=November 3, 2011|date=April 1, 1993|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-88730-629-7|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140624065146/http://books.google.com/books?id=XdYOGBhp0SAC|archivedate=June 24, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wargs.com/other/gates.html Ancestry of Bill Gates] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612062031/http://www.wargs.com/other/gates.html |date=June 12, 2010 }}. wargs.com&lt;/ref&gt; Her grandfather, [[James Willard Maxwell]] (1864–1951), was president of the National City Bank in Seattle from 1911 to 1929 and a director of the [[Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco Seattle Branch|Seattle branch]] of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.

Gates graduated from Seattle's [[Roosevelt High School (Seattle)|Roosevelt High School]] and then attended the nearby [[University of Washington]], where she received a degree in education in 1950. She married [[University of Washington School of Law|UW law]] graduate [[William H. Gates, Sr.]] in 1951,&lt;ref name=tplwdf&gt;{{cite web |url=http://search.tacomapubliclibrary.org/images/dt6n.asp?krequest=subjects+contains+Maxwell,%20Mary |publisher=Tacoma Public Library |title=Wedding day photos |date=May 11, 1951 |accessdate=May 2, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160601031251/http://search.tacomapubliclibrary.org/images/dt6n.asp?krequest=subjects%20contains%20Maxwell%2C%20Mary |archivedate=June 1, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and she taught school in the early 1950s. After her husband co-founded the law practice that became [[Preston Gates &amp; Ellis]] in Seattle, Gates turned to a variety of civic activities. Gates' volunteer roles in Seattle and King County included serving on the boards of the Children's Hospital Foundation, [[Seattle Symphony]], Greater Seattle Chamber of Commerce, United Way of King County, and many other nonprofit organizations. She also served as President of the [[Junior League]] of Seattle from 1966–1967.

She had three children, one of whom was [[Microsoft]] co-founder Bill Gates.&lt;ref name=setmobt/&gt;&lt;ref name=nytobt/&gt;

==Career==
In 1975, Governor [[Daniel J. Evans]] appointed Gates to the board of regents for her alma mater, where she led the movement on the board to divest the [[University of Washington]]'s holdings in [[South Africa]] to protest [[apartheid]]. In addition, Gates served on the UW Foundation Board of Directors, the UW Medical Center Board, and the UW School of Business Administration's Advisory Board.

Gates also served for many years on the boards of several major corporations: [[First Interstate Bancorp|First Interstate Bank]] of Washington; [[General Casualty Insurance|Unigard]] Security Insurance Group; [[Pacific Northwest Bell|Pacific Northwest Bell Telephone Company]], which became [[US West|U.S. WEST Communications]]; and [[KIRO-TV|KIRO]] Incorporated.

Beyond the Seattle area, Gates was appointed to the board of directors of the national [[United Way]] in 1980, becoming the first woman to lead it in 1983. Her tenure on the national board's executive committee is believed to have helped Microsoft, based in Seattle, at a crucial time. In 1980, she discussed her son's company with [[John Opel]], a fellow committee member and the chairman of International Business Machines Corporation (IBM). Opel, by some accounts, mentioned Mrs. Gates to other IBM executives. A few weeks later, IBM took a chance by hiring Microsoft, then a small software firm, to develop an operating system for its first personal computer.&lt;ref name=nytobt/&gt;

==Death==
Gates died at age 64 in 1994 at her [[Laurelhurst, Seattle|Laurelhurst]] home after a months-long battle with [[breast cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&amp;file_id=2296 Mary Maxwell Gates dies on June 10, 1994.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604050948/http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&amp;file_id=2296 |date=June 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, her family has established two endowments in her name at the University of Washington. The UW's Mary Gates Hall is named in her honor and houses the UW's Undergraduate Academic Affairs, the Office of Minority Affairs &amp; Diversity, the Career Center, and the [[University of Washington Information School|Information School]].&lt;ref name=setmobt/&gt; A street on the northeast section of campus, formerly Union Bay Place, is named for her.

In many countries, a '''mayor ''' (from the [[Latin]] ''maior'' {{IPA-la|majˈjɔr|}}, meaning "bigger") is the highest-ranking [[official]] in a [[Municipal corporation|municipal government]] such as that of a [[city]] or a [[town]].

Worldwide, there is a wide [[variance]] in local laws and customs regarding the powers and responsibilities of a mayor as well as the means by which a mayor is elected or otherwise mandated. Depending on the system chosen, a mayor may be the chief executive officer of the municipal government, may simply chair a multi-member governing body with little or no independent power, or may play a solely ceremonial role. Options for selection of a mayor include direct election by the public, or selection by an elected governing council or board.

==History==

===British Isles===
{{anchor|England|Scotland|Wales}}{{See also|Mayors in England|Mayors in Wales}}
In modern [[England]] and [[Wales]], the position of mayor descends from the feudal lord's [[bailiff]] or [[Reeve (England)|reeve]] (''see [[borough]]''). The [[chief magistrate]] of [[London]] bore the title of [[portreeve]] for considerably more than a century after the [[Norman Conquest]]. This official was elected by popular choice, a privilege secured from [[John, King of England|King John]]. By the beginning of the 12th century, the title of portreeve gave way to that of mayor as the designation of the chief officer of London, followed around 1190 by that of [[Winchester]]. Other boroughs adopted the title later. In the 19th century, in the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1882]], Section 15, regulated the election of mayors. The mayor was to be a fit person elected annually on 9 November by the council of the borough from among the aldermen or councillors or persons qualified to be such. His term of office was one year, but he was eligible for re-election. He might appoint a deputy to act during illness or absence, and such deputy must be either an alderman or councillor. A mayor who was absent from the borough for more than two months became disqualified and had to vacate his office. A mayor was ''ex officio'' a [[justice of the peace]] for the borough during his year of office and the following year. He received such remuneration as the council thought reasonable. These provisions have now been repealed.

In medieval Wales, the [[Laws of Hywel Dda]] codified the [[maer (office)|mayor]] ([[Medieval Latin|Latin]]: ''{{lang|la|maior}}''; [[Welsh language|Welsh]]: ''{{lang|cy|maer}}'') as a position at the [[Welsh kingdoms|royal courts]] charged with administering the serfs of the [[demesne|king's lands]]. To maintain its dependence on and loyalty to the Crown, the position was forbidden to the leaders of the clan groups.&lt;ref name=HyDda&gt;[[Wade-Evans, Arthur]]. 
Page:Welsh Medieval Law.djvu/447|Welsh Medieval Law]]''. Oxford Univ., 1909. Accessed 1 Feb 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; A separate mayor, known as the "cow dung mayor"&lt;!--seriously. see source.--&gt; (''maer biswail''), was charged with overseeing the royal cattle.&lt;ref name=HyDda/&gt; There were similar offices at the Scottish and Irish courts.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

The office of [[Mayors and provosts in the United Kingdom|mayor]] in most modern English and Welsh boroughs and towns did not in the 20th century entail any important administrative duties, and was generally regarded as an honour conferred for local distinction, long service on the Council, or for past services. The mayor was expected to devote much of his (or her) time to civic, ceremonial, and representational functions, and to preside over meetings for the advancement of the public welfare. His or her administrative duties were to act as returning officer at parliamentary elections, and as chairman of the meetings of the council. However, since [[Local Government Act 2000|reforms]] introduced in 2000, 14 English local authorities have [[Elected mayors in the United Kingdom|directly elected mayors]] who combine the 'civic' mayor role with that of Leader of the Council and have significantly greater powers than either. The mayor of a [[town council]] is officially known as "town mayor" (although in popular parlance, the word "town" is often dropped). Women mayors are also known as "mayor"; the wife of a mayor is sometimes known as the "mayoress". Mayors are not appointed to District Councils which do not have [[Borough status in the United Kingdom|borough status]]. Their place is taken by the Chairman of Council, who undertakes exactly the same functions and is, like a mayor, the civic head of the district concerned.

In [[Scotland]] the post holders are known as Convenors, Provosts, or Lord Provosts depending on the local authority.

===Continental Europe===
{{main article|Mayor of the Palace|podestà}}
The original [[Franks|Frankish]] mayors or majordomos were {{ndash}} like the Welsh ''meiri'' {{ndash}} lords commanding the king's lands around the [[Merovingians|Merovingian]] courts in [[Austrasia]], [[kingdom of Burgundy|Burgundy]], and [[Neustria]]. The mayorship of Paris eventually became hereditary in the [[Pippinids]], who later established the [[Carolingian dynasty]].

In modern [[France]], since the [[French Revolution|Revolution]], a mayor (''maire'') and a number of mayoral adjuncts (''adjoints au maire'') are selected by the municipal council from among their number. Most of the administrative work is left in their hands, with the full council meeting comparatively infrequently. The model was copied throughout Europe in Britain's mayors, Italy's [[sindaco]]s, most of the German states' [[burgomaster]]s, and Portugal's [[President of the Municipal Chamber|presidents of the municipal chambers]].

In [[Medieval Italy]], the [[Italian city-states|city-states]] who did not consider themselves independent principalities or dukedoms {{ndash}} particularly those of the Imperial [[Ghibelline]] faction {{ndash}} were led by [[podestà]]s.

The [[Greece|Greek]] equivalent of a mayor is the demarch (Greek: {{lang|grc|δήμαρχος}}, lit. "[[archon]] of the [[deme]]").

====Scandinavia====
In [[Denmark]] all [[Municipalities of Denmark|municipalities]] are led by a political official called ''[[Burgomaster|borgmester]]'', "mayor". The mayor of [[Copenhagen]] is however called ''[[List of mayors of Copenhagen|overborgmester]]'' "superior mayor". In that city other mayors, ''borgmestre'' (plural), are subordinate to him with different undertakings, like ministers to a prime minister. In other municipalities in Denmark there is only a single mayor.

In [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]] the mayoral title ''borgermester/borgmästare'' has now been abolished. Norway abolished it in 1937 as a title of the non-political top manager of (city) municipalities and replaced it with the title ''rådmann'' ("[[alderman]]" or "[[magistrate]]"), which is still in use when referring to the top managers of the [[municipalities of Norway]]. The top ''elected'' official of the municipalities of Norway, on the other hand, has the title ''ordfører'', which actually means "word-bearer", i.e. "chairman" or "president", an equivalent to the Swedish word ''[[:wikt:ordförande|ordförande]]''.

In Sweden ''borgmästare'' was a title of the senior judge of the courts of the cities, courts which were called ''rådhusrätt'', literally "town hall court", somewhat of an equivalent to an English [[Magistrates' Court (England and Wales)|magistrates' court]]. These courts were abolished in 1971. Until 1965 these mayor judges on historical grounds also performed administrative functions in the "board of magistrates", in Swedish known collegially{{clarifyme|date=April 2017}} as ''magistrat''. Until 1965 there were also municipal mayors (''kommunalborgmästare''), who had these non-political administrative roles in smaller cities without a magistrates' court or ''magistrat''. This office was an invention of the 20th century as the smaller cities in Sweden during the first half of the 20th century subsequently lost their own courts and magistrates.

In the 16th century in Sweden, king [[Gustav Vasa]] considerably centralised government and appointed the mayors directly. In 1693 king [[Charles XI]] accepted a compromise after repeated petitions from the Estate of the Burgesses over decades against the royal mayor appointments. The compromise was that the burgesses in a city could normally nominate a mayor under the supervision of the local governor. The nominee was then to be presented to and appointed by the king, but the king could appoint mayors directly in exceptional cases. This was codified in the [[Instrument of Government]] of 1720 and on 8 July the same year [[Privy Council of Sweden|Riksrådet ("the Council of the Realm")]] decided, after a petition from the said Estate, that only the city could present nominees, not the king or anyone else. Thus the supervision of the local governor and directly appointed mayors by the king ceased after 1720 (the so-called [[Age of Liberty]]). On 16 October 1723, it was decided after a petition that the city should present three nominees, of whom the king (or the Council of the Realm) appointed one.&lt;ref name=NF&gt;[http://runeberg.org/nfbc/0637.html The article ''Borgmästare'' (in Swedish)] in [[Nordisk Familjebok]].&lt;/ref&gt; This was kept as a rule from then on in all later regulations&lt;ref name=NF/&gt; and was also kept as a tradition in the [[Instrument of Government (1809)|1809 Instrument of Government]] ([http://sv.wikisource.org/wiki/Regeringsform_1809#.C2.A731. § 31]) until 1965.

In [[Finland]], there are two mayors, in [[Tampere]] and [[Pirkkala]]. Usually in Finland the highest executive official is not democratically elected, but is appointed to a public office by the city council, and is called simply ''kaupunginjohtaja'' "city manager" or ''kunnanjohtaja'' "municipal manager", depending on whether the municipality defines itself as a city. The term ''pormestari'' "mayor", from Swedish ''borgmästare'' confusingly on historical grounds has referred to the highest official in the registry office and in the city courts (abolished in 1993) as in Sweden, not the city manager. In addition, ''pormestari'' is also an honorary title, which may be given for distinguished service in the post of the city manager. The city manager of Helsinki is called ''ylipormestari'', which translates to "Chief Mayor", for historical reasons. Furthermore, the term "city manager" may be seen translated as "mayor".

==Mayors by country==
===Australia===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Albury, New South Wales]] --&gt;
On Australian councils, the mayor is generally the member of the council who acts as ceremonial figurehead at official functions, as well as carrying the authority of council between meetings. Mayoral decisions made between meetings are subject to Council and may be confirmed or repealed if necessary. Mayors in Australia may be elected either directly through a ballot for the position of mayor at a local-government election, or alternatively may be elected from within the council at a meeting.

The civic regalia and insignia of local government have basically remained unaltered for centuries.
The robes, the [[Livery collar|mayoral chain]] and the [[Ceremonial mace|mace]] are not intended to glorify the individual, but rather they are a uniform of office and are used to respect and honour the people whom the users serve.

The mayoral robe may be crimson with lapels and sleeves trimmed in ermine. The mayor may also wear a lace fall (neck piece) and cuffs.

The deputy-mayoral robe may be crimson with lapels and sleeves trimmed with black velvet and bordered with lapin.

Mayors have the title of ''''[[Worship (style)|His/Her Worship]]'''' whilst holding the position.

In councils where [[Councillors]] are elected representing political parties, the mayor is normally the leader of the party receiving the most seats on council. In [[Queensland]] the [[Lord Mayor]] and Mayors are elected by popular vote at the general council election.

===Brazil===
Every municipality in Brazil elects a mayor (Portuguese: ''prefeito''/''prefeita''), for a four-year term, acting as an executive officer with the city council (Portuguese: ''Câmara Municipal'') functioning with legislative powers. The mayor can be re-elected and manage the city for two consecutive terms.

The Brazilian system works similarly to the [[mayor-council government]] in the United States.

===Canada===
The chief executives of [[borough#Canada|boroughs]] (''[[Arrondissement#Quebec|arrondissements]]'') in [[Quebec]] are termed mayors (''maires/mairesses'' in French). A borough mayor simultaneously serves as head of the borough council and as a regular councillor on the main city council.

As is the practice in most Commonwealth countries, in Canada a mayor is addressed as His/Her Worship while holding office.

In some small [[township (Canada)|townships]] in [[Ontario]], the title '''reeve''' was historically used instead of mayor. In some other municipalities, "mayor" and "reeve" were two separate offices, with the mayor retaining leadership powers while the reeve was equivalent to what other municipalities called an "[[at-large]] councillor". While most municipalities in the province now designate their elected municipal government heads as mayors, in certain areas of the province, the elected head of the municipality continues to be refereed to as reeve, and the second-in-command is referred to as the deputy reeve. For example, this continues to be the case in the municipalities of [[Algonquin Highlands]], [[Dysart et al]], [[Highlands East]], and [[Minden Hills]], all located within the [[Haliburton County]].

Many municipalities in Alberta continue to use the title reeve to denote the office of mayor or chief elected official in accordance with the Municipal Government Act.

In rural municipalities (RM) in the provinces of [[Manitoba]] and [[Saskatchewan]], the elected head of the RM is still referred to as a "reeve", as are the heads of most counties and district municipalities (DMs) in Alberta.

The scheduling of municipal elections in Canada varies by jurisdiction, as each province and territory has its own laws regarding municipal governance. See also [[municipal elections in Canada]].

===Dominican Republic===
The mayor of a municipality in the [[Dominican Republic]] is called indistinctly ''alcalde'' or ''síndico''. The latter name is preferred as to avoid confusing the title with the similarly sounding ''alcaide'' (''lit. [[prison warden]]''). Such person is the governor of the municipality whose township elected him (or her) by [[direct vote]] for a term of four years. The mayor's office daily duties are restricted to the local governance, and as such, it is responsible for the coordination of [[waste collection]], [[Maintenance, repair, and operations|upkeep]] of [[public spaces]] (parks, undeveloped urban parcels, streets, city ornate, traffic light control, sewage and most public utilities). In practice most of it duties are centered in light street repairing (new or big road projects, like overpasses, bridges, pedestrian crossings, etc. are handled by the Public Works Ministry (''Ministerio de Obras Públicas'' in Spanish) office), under the direct control of the Central Government. Subcontracting [[Waste collection|garbage collection]] and management, overseeing the use of public spaces and arbitring neighborhood land ''use'' disputes which is managed by the National Property office (''Oficina de Bienes Nacionales'' in Spanish) is also controlled by the mayor's office. Water, electrical supply and public transportation coordination are handled by several Central Government's offices, and as such, are not under control of the mayor.

===France===
{{details|Mayor (France)}}
Mayors (''maires'') in France are elected every six years in [[Elections in france#Municipal|local elections]].

===Germany===
In Germany local government is regulated by [[states of Germany|state]] statutes. Nowadays only the mayors of the three city-states (Berlin, Hamburg and [[Bremen (state)|Bremen]]) are still elected by the respective city-state parliaments. In all the other states the mayors are now elected directly by the [[EU citizen]]s living in that area. The post of mayor may be said to be a professional one, the mayor being the head of the local government, and requiring, in order to be eligible, a training in administration. In big cities (details are regulated by state statutes) the official title is Oberbürgermeister ([[Lord Mayor]]). In these cities a "simple" mayor is just a deputy responsible for a distinct task (e.g., welfare or construction works). Big cities are usually [[Kreisfreie Stadt|kreisfrei ("free of district")]]. That means that the city council also has the powers and duties of a rural district council. The leader of a rural district council is called Landrat ("land counsellor"). In that case the chief mayor has also the duties and powers of a Landrat. The term Oberbürgermeister is not used in the three city-states, where the mayors are simultaneously [[minister-president|head of state governments]], but ''Regierender Bürgermeister'' ([[Governing Mayor of Berlin]]), ''Erster Bürgermeister'' ([[First Mayor of the city-state of Hamburg]]) and ''Präsident des Senats und Bürgermeister'' ([[Mayor of Bremen|President of the Senate and Mayor of Bremen]]) are used.

===Greece===
Mayors in [[Greece]] were elected every four years in [[Elections in Greece#Local elections|local elections]] and are the head of various municipal governments in which the state is divided. Starting from 2014, mayors are elected for a 5-year term. Local administration elections for the new, consolidated municipalities and peripheries will henceforth be held together with the [[Elections in the European Union|elections]] for the [[European Parliament]].

Local administration in Greece recently underwent extensive reform in two phases: the first phase, implemented in 1997 and commonly called the "[[Ioannis Kapodistrias|Kapodistrias]] Project", consolidated the country's numerous municipalities and communities down to approximately 1000. The second phase, initially called "Kapodistrias II" but eventually called the "[[Callicrates]] Project", was implemented in 2010, further consolidated municipalities down to 370, and merged the country's 54 prefectures into 13 peripheries. The Callicratean municipalities were designed according to several guidelines; for example each island (except [[Crete]]) was incorporated into a single municipality, while the majority of small towns were consolidated so as to have an average municipal population of 25,000.

=== India ===
In [[India]], the mayor is leader of the council and has a number of roles, both legislative and functional. The legislative requirements are outlined in Section 73 and 73AA of Local Government Act 1989. In most Indian states mayors are elected indirectly among the council members themselves except in seven states [[Bihar]], [[Chhattisgarh]], [[Jharkhand]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[Odisha]], [[Uttar Pradesh]] and [[Uttarakhand]]; where mayors are elected directly by the public.

===Indonesia===
In [[Indonesia]], mayor ({{lang-id|wali kota}}, formerly called ''walikotamadya'' and ''walikota'') is a regional head of a city or town. A mayor has the same level as a [[regent]] ({{lang-id|bupati}}), head of a regency ({{lang-id|kabupaten}}). Basically, a mayor has duties and authority to lead the implementation of the policies established by the region along with the city council ({{lang-id|Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat Daerah Kota}}, DPRD Kota; formerly called Tier 2-DPRD (''DPRD tingkat II'')). A mayor is elected in a pair with a vice mayor through direct elections and is a political office, except in Jakarta. There, mayoralty is a civil-service career position with limited authority and is designated by the [[Governor of Jakarta]]. Their region are called [[Jakarta#Administrative divisions|administration cities]] ({{lang-id|kota administrasi}}).

Before 1999, there were administrative cities ({{lang-id|kota administratif}}, [[:id:Kota administratif|id]]) which were headed by administrative mayors.

===Iran===
In [[Iran]], the mayor is the executive manager of city and elected by the Islamic City Council. The mayor is elected for a four-year term.

===Ireland===
In the [[Republic of Ireland]], the head of a borough corporation was called "mayor" from the [[Municipal Corporations (Ireland) Act 1840]] until boroughs were abolished by the [[Local Government Reform Act 2014]]. The [[Local Government Act 2001]] allowed [[Counties of Ireland|county]] councils to style their chairperson as "mayor" and most do so. [[City status in Ireland|City]] council chairs are "mayor" (or "lord mayor" in the cases [[Lord Mayor of Dublin|of Dublin]] and [[Lord Mayor of Cork|of Cork]]). Since 2000 [[Proposed directly elected mayor for the Dublin Metropolitan Area|there have been proposals]] for a directly elected mayor of the [[Dublin Metropolitan Area]].

===Italy===
In Italy the mayor is called ''sindaco'', or informally ''primo cittadino'' ("first citizen"). Every municipality ({{lang-it|Comune}}) has its mayor who represents the local government. The mayor is elected every five years by the inhabitants of the municipality, but he cannot be re-elected after two terms (except in small towns).&lt;ref&gt;{{it}} [https://www.academia.edu/11358245/Del_terzo_mandato_dei_sindaci {{lang|it|No ai tre mandati dei sindaci. Principio di legalità batte disobbedienti}}].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===
Japan's [[Local Autonomy Law|Local-Autonomy Law]] of 1947 defines the structure of Japanese local governments, which were strengthened after World War II. It gives strong executive power to the mayor in the local politics like [[mayor-council government#Executive or Strong Mayor Form|strong mayors]] in large cities in the United States of America.
The titles that are translated as "mayor" by the governments are those of the heads of [[cities of Japan|cities]] {{Nihongo||市長|shichō}}, [[towns of Japan|towns]] {{Nihongo||町長|chōchō}}, [[villages of Japan|villages]] {{Nihongo||村長|sonchō}}, and Tokyo's [[special wards of Tokyo|special wards]] {{Nihongo||区長|kuchō}}.
(The head of the [[Tokyo|Tokyo prefecture]] is the {{Nihongo|Governor|知事|Chiji}}.)
A mayor is elected every four years by direct popular votes held separately from the assembly. A mayor can be [[recall election|recalled]] by a popular initiative but the [[prefectures of Japan|prefectural]] and the national governments cannot remove a mayor from office. Towards the assembly the mayor prepares budgets, proposes local [[Act of Parliament|acts]] and has vetoes on local acts just approved by the assembly which can be overridden by two-thirds assembly support. A mayor can resolve the assembly if the assembly passes a [[motion of no confidence]] or if the mayor thinks the assembly has no confidence in fact.

===Kazakhstan===
In Kazakhstan, the mayor is called [[Akim]] who is the head of an akimat, a municipal, district, or provincial government (mayorat), and serves as the Presidential representative. Akims of provinces and cities are appointed to the post by the President on the advice of the Prime Minister. Meanwhile, the akims of other administrative and territorial units are appointed or selected to the post in an order defined by the President. He may also dismiss akims from their posts. Powers of akims ends with the introduction into the post of new-elected president of the republic. Thus, the akim continues to fulfill the duties before appointment of corresponding akim by the President of Kazakhstan.

===Malaysia===
{{See also|Mayor of Kuala Lumpur|Mayor of Penang Island}}
The mayor functions as the head of the local government of the cities in Malaysia. To date, there are [[List of cities in Malaysia#Cities of Malaysia|14 officially-recognised cities in the country]].

In cities which lie within the jurisdiction of any one of the [[States and federal territories of Malaysia|13 Malaysian states]], the mayor is appointed by the state government.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thesundaily.my/news/2017/10/24/elect-local-leaders|title=Elect local leaders|website=www.thesundaily.my|language=en|access-date=2018-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kuala Lumpur]], the country's capital, is a notable exception, as it forms part of the [[Federal Territories (Malaysia)|Federal Territories]] which come under the purview of the [[Government of Malaysia|Malaysian federal government]], via the [[Ministry of Federal Territories (Malaysia)|Ministry of Federal Territories]]. Thus, the mayor of Kuala Lumpur is selected by, and subordinate to, the [[Minister of Federal Territories (Malaysia)|Minister of Federal Territories]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/teresa-kok-federal-territories-ministry-should-be-abolished|title=Teresa Kok: Federal Territories Ministry should be abolished|date=2018-06-13|work=The Edge Markets|access-date=2018-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Malaysian general election, 2018|2018 general election]], which saw the country undergoing its first ever regime change, there have been calls to revive local government elections, which had been the practice in certain cities such as Kuala Lumpur, [[George Town, Penang|George Town]], [[Ipoh]] and [[Malacca City|Melaka]] until their abolishment in 1965.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.malaymail.com/s/1631905/non-partisan-local-elections-the-way-forward-says-ipoh-ngo|title=Non-partisan local elections the way forward, says Ipoh NGO {{!}} Malay Mail|website=www.malaymail.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/local-elections-begin-soon-economy-stabilises|title=Local elections to begin as soon as economy stabilises|date=2018-05-28|work=The Edge Markets|access-date=2018-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reinstatement of local government elections would lead to the mayoral position being elected, instead of being appointed as per the current system.

===Malta===

In Malta, the mayor (In [[Maltese language|Maltese]]: Sindku) is the leader of the majority party in the [[Local councils of Malta|Local Council]]. The members of the Local Councils are directly elected and collectively serve as a basic form of local government.

===Moldova===
The Mayor of the municipality in Moldova is elected for four years. In [[Chişinău]], the last mayor elections had to be repeated three times, because of the low rate of participation.

===Netherlands===
{{Main article|Burgemeester}}

In the [[Netherlands]], the mayor (in {{lang-nl|burgemeester}}) is the leader of the municipal executives ('[[College van Burgemeester en Wethouders]]'). In the Netherlands, burgermeesters are ''de facto'' appointed by the national [[Cabinet of the Netherlands|cabinet]], ''de jure'' by the [[Dutch Monarchy|monarch]]. They preside both the municipal executive and the legislative ('[[gemeenteraad]]'). The title is sometimes translated as [[burgomaster]], to emphasize the appointed, rather than elected, nature of the office. The appointment procedure was brought for discussion in the early 2000s (decade), as some of the political parties represented in parliament regarded the procedure as undemocratic. Generally, mayors in the Netherlands are selected from the established political parties. Alternatives proposed were direct election of the mayor by the people or appointment by the city council (''gemeenteraad''). A constitutional change to allow for this failed to pass the [[Senate of the Netherlands|Senate]] in March 2005.

===Nepal===
Mayors in Nepal are elected every Five years in the [[Elections in Nepal|Local elections]].


===New Zealand===
{{Main article|Mayors in New Zealand}}

Mayors in New Zealand are elected every three years in the [[Elections in New Zealand|local body elections]].

===Pakistan===
In [[Pakistan]], a city is headed by the [[Districts of Pakistan|District]] [[Nazim]] (the word means "supervisor" in Urdu, but is sometimes translated as Mayor) and assisted by [[Naib Nazim]] who is also speaker of District Council. District Nazim is elected by the nazims of [[Union councils of Pakistan|union councils]], union councillors and by [[tehsil]] nazims, who themselves are elected directly by the votes of the local public. Council elections are held every four years.

===Philippines===
In the [[Philippines]], mayors ({{lang-tl|Punong Bayan / Punong Lungsod}}) are the head of a [[List of cities and municipalities in the Philippines|municipality or a city]], with the vice mayor as the second highest position in the city. They are elected every three years during the midterm and national elections, and they can serve until three terms of office. As of - September 2012, there are 1,635 mayors in the Philippines.

===Poland===
Mayors in [[Poland]] are [[direct election|directly elected]] by inhabitants of their respective [[municipality]]. The mayor is the sole chief of the [[executive branch]] of the municipality and he cannot serve on the municipal council ([[city council]]) or in the [[parliament]]. The mayor may appoint a deputy mayor if needed. In Poland, a mayor is called a ''burmistrz'' or, in towns with more than 100,000 inhabitants or other municipalities that traditionally use the title, ''prezydent'' ("president", for example "President of [[Warsaw]]", instead of "Mayor of Warsaw"). The equivalent title in a rural community ("[[gmina]]") is "[[wójt]]".

The mayor is elected for a four-year term concurrently with the four-year term of the municipal council, and his/her service is terminated at the end of the municipal council's term. Mayors cannot be dismissed by the municipal council, but they can be removed from the office by the citizens of their municipality in a [[referendum]]. A mayor can also be dismissed by the [[Prime Minister]] in case of persistent transgression of the law. Citizens having a criminal record cannot run for mayor, but only if sentenced for intentional offense [[ex officio]].

The mayor manages the municipal estate, issues minor regulations, and incurs [[liability (financial accounting)|liabilities]] within limits set by the municipal council. The mayor presents a budget to the municipal council, that may then be amended by the council. After the municipal council passes the budget in a form of resolution, the mayor is responsible for its realization. The mayor is the head of the [[town hall]] and the [[register office]] (he/she may appoint deputies for these specific tasks). Mayors legally act as employers for all of the officials of the town hall. Mayors in Poland have wide administrative authority: the only official that he/she cannot appoint or dismiss is a [[city treasurer]], who is appointed by a city council. Although mayors in Poland do not have veto power over city council resolutions, their position is relatively strong and should be classified as a [[mayor-council government]].

===Portugal===
In [[Portugal]] and many other Portuguese-speaking countries the mayor of a municipality is called the ''Presidente da Câmara Municipal'' ([[President of the Municipal Chamber]]).

===Romania===
In [[Romania]] the mayor of a commune, town or city is called ''primar''. He is elected for a period of four years. In carrying out his responsibilities he is assisted by an elected local council (''consiliu local''). [[Bucharest]] has a general mayor (''primar general'') and six sector mayors (''primar de sector''), one for each [[Sectors of Bucharest|sector]]. The responsibilities of the mayor and of the local council are defined by Law 215/2001 of the Romanian Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legislatie.resurse-pentru-democratie.org/legea/215-2001.php|title=Legea nr. 215/2001|author=APD-Timisoara|work=resurse-pentru-democratie.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russia===
In Russia, the '''Мэр''', from [[France language|fr]] '''Maire''' ([[English language|en]] transcription = ''Mer'' - not to be confused to the NATO [[OF-3]] rank ''Майор'' - en: ''[[Major]]''), is one of possible titles of the head of the administration of a city or municipality.  This title is equivalent to that of the head of a Russian rural district. Exceptionally, the ''mer'' of [[Moscow]], [[Saint-Petersburg]] and [[Sevastopol]] are equivalent to governors in Russia, since these three federal cities are equivalent to Russian federations.

Except for those just-named three large cities, the governance system of a Russian municipality (city, county, district or town) is subordinate to the representative council of the federation in which it is located. The ''mer'', is either directly elected in municipal elections (citywide referendum) or is elected by the members of the municipality's representative council. Election by council members is now more widespread because it better integrates with the Russian federal three-level vertical governance structure:
#National government: 
##President (executive) 
##[[Federal Assembly (Russia)|Federal Assembly]]
#Federation governments: 
##Heads of federation (commonly governors)
##Regional representative councils
#Local governments: 
##Heads of administration (who have the official title of ''mer'', whether or not local law defines it as such)
##Local representative councils

The typical term of office of a ''mer'' in Russia is four years. The ''mer's'' office administers all municipal services, public property, police and fire protection, and most public agencies, and enforces all local and state laws within a city or town.

According to Medialogy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mlg.ru/ratings/mayors/2949/6/2014/4/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222162625/http://www.mlg.ru/ratings/mayors/2949/6/2014/4/ |archivedate=2015-12-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''mer'' of [[Novosibirsk]], Edward Lokot', is mentioned in the media more than any other Russian mayor.  The ''mer'' of [[Kazan]], Il'sur Metshin, is the most popular in Russia, scoring 76 out of 100, according to the Russian People's Rating of ''Mers''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://russia-rating.ru/info/1530.html|title=Регионы России: Рейтинг Мэров (Май, 2014)|work=russia-rating.ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Serbia===
In [[Serbia]], the mayor is the head of the city or a town. He acts on behalf of the city, and performs an executive function. The position of the mayor of [[Belgrade]] is important as the capital city is the most important hub of economics, culture and science in [[Serbia]]. Furthermore, the post of the mayor of Belgrade is the third most important position in the government after the [[Prime Minister of Serbia|Prime Minister]] and [[President of Serbia|President]].

===Spain and Hispanic America===
''[[Alcalde]]'' is the most common Spanish term for the mayor of a town or city. It is derived from the {{lang-ar|[[Qadi|al-qaḍi]]|script=Latn}} ({{lang|ar|قاضي|rtl=yes}}), i.e., "the ([[Sharia]]) judge," who often had administrative, as well as judicial, functions. Although the [[Crown of Castile|Castilian]] ''alcalde'' and the [[Al-Andalus|Andalusian]] ''qaḍi'' had slightly different attributes (the ''qaḍi'' oversaw an entire province, the ''alcalde'' only a municipality; the former was appointed by the ruler of the state but the latter was elected by the [[Cabildo (council)|municipal council]]), the adoption of this term reflects how much Muslim society in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] influenced the Christian one in the early phases of the ''[[Reconquista]]''. As Spanish Christians took over an increasing part of the Peninsula, they adapted the Muslim systems and terminology for their own use.

Today, it refers to the executive head of a municipal or local government, who usually does not have judicial functions. The word ''[[Intendant|intendente]]'' is used in [[Argentina]] and [[Paraguay]] for the office that is analogous to a mayor.

In larger cities in [[Mexico]], the chief executive is known as the ''presidente municipal'' or "municipal president".

===Sweden===
The Swedish title ''borgmästare'' ([[burgomaster]]) was abolished in the court reform of 1971 when also the [[stad (Sweden)|towns of Sweden]] were officially abolished. Since the middle of the 20th century, the [[municipal commissioner]] – the highest-ranking politician in each municipality – is informally titled "mayor"{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} in English.

===Switzerland===
The function and title for mayor vary from one canton to another. Generally, the mayor presides an executive council of several members governing a [[municipalities of Switzerland|municipality]].

The title is:
*in Italian: ''Sindaco'' ([[Ticino]]), Podestà ([[Grigioni]])
*in French: ''Maire'' ([[Canton of Geneva|Geneva]], [[Canton of Jura|Jura]], [[Canton of Bern|Bern]]), ''Syndic'' ([[Vaud]], [[Canton of Fribourg|Fribourg]]),  ''Président du Conseil municipal'' ([[Valais]]), ''Président du Conseil communal'' ([[Canton of Neuchâtel|Neuchâtel]])
*in German: e.g. ''Stadtpräsident'', ''Stadtammann'', ''Gemeindepräsident'', ''Gemeindeammann''

===Taiwan===
In the [[Republic of China]] in Taiwan the mayor is the head of city's government and its city's council, which is in charge of legislative affairs. The mayor and city council are elected separately by the city's residents.

===Turkey===
Mayors ([[Turkish language|Turkish]]:''Belediye Başkanı'') in Turkey are elected by the municipal councill. As a rule, there are municipalities in all province centers and district centers as well as towns ({{lang-tr|belde}}) which are actually villages with a population in excess of 2000. However beginning by 1983, a new level of municipality is introduced in Turkish administrative system. In big cities Metropolitan municipalities ({{lang-tr|Büyükşehir belediyesi}}) are established. (See [[Metropolitan municipalities in Turkey]]) In a Metropolitan municipality there may be several  district municipalities (hence mayors).

===Ukraine===
In [[Ukraine]] the title ''Mer'' was introduced for the position of the head of the municipal state administration in the federal cities of [[Kiev]] and [[Sevastopol]]. In the rest of the urban and rural settlements the position is unofficial and simply refers to the head of a local council who at the moment of such assignment cannot be affiliated with any party of the council.

===United States===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[List of mayors of New York City]] --&gt;
{{Main article|Mayoralty in the United States}}

The mayor is the leader in most United States municipalities (such as cities, townships, etc.). In the [[Mayoralty in the United States|United States]], there are several distinct types of mayors, depending on the system of local government. Under [[council-manager government]], the mayor is a [[first among equals]] on the [[city council]], which acts as a legislative body while executive functions are performed by the appointed manager. The mayor may chair the city council, but lacks any special legislative powers. The mayor and city council serve part-time, with day-to-day administration in the hands of a professional city manager. The system is most common among medium-sized cities from around 25,000 to several hundred thousand, usually rural and suburban municipalities.

In the second form, known as [[mayor-council government]], the mayoralty and city council are separate offices. Under a ''strong mayor'' system, the mayor acts as an elected executive with the city council exercising legislative powers. They may select a [[chief administrative officer]] to oversee the different departments. This is the system used in most of the United States' large cities, primarily because mayors serve full-time and have a wide range of services that they oversee. In a ''weak mayor'' or ''ceremonial mayor'' system, the mayor has appointing power for department heads but is subject to checks by the city council, sharing both executive and legislative duties with the council. This is common for smaller cities, especially in [[New England]]. [[Charlotte, North Carolina]] and [[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]] are two notable large cities with a ceremonial mayor.

Many American mayors are styled "His Honor" or "Her Honor" while in office.

==Multi-tier local government==
In several countries, where there is not local [[autonomy]], mayors are often appointed by some branch of the federal or regional government. In some cities, subdivisions such as [[borough]]s may have their own mayors; this is the case, for example, with the [[arrondissement]]s of Paris, [[Montreal]], and [[Mexico City]]. In Belgium, the capital, [[Brussels]], is administratively one of the federation's three regions, and is the only city subdivided, without the other regions' provincial level, into 19 rather small municipalities, which each have an elected—formally appointed—Burgomaster (i.e., Mayor, responsible to his / her elected council); while [[Antwerp]], the other major metropolitan area, has one large city (where the boroughs, former municipalities merged into it, elect a lower level, albeit with very limited competence) and several smaller surrounding municipalities, each under a normal Burgomaster as in Brussels.

In the People's Republic of China, the Mayor (市長) may be the administrative head of any municipality, provincial, prefecture-level, or county-level. The Mayor is usually the most recognized official in cities, although the position is the second-highest-ranking official in charge after the local Communist Party Secretary. In principle, the Mayor (who also serves as the Deputy Communist Party Secretary of the city) is responsible for managing the city administration while the Communist Party Secretary is responsible for general policy and managing the party bureaucracy, but in practice the roles blur, frequently causing conflict.

==Acting mayor==
'''Acting mayor''' is a temporary office created by the charter of some [[municipal]] governments.

In many cities and towns, the charter or some similar fundamental document provides that in the event of the death, illness, resignation, or removal from office of the [[incumbent]] mayor, another official will lead the municipality for a temporary period, which, depending on the jurisdiction, may be for a stated period of days or months until a [[special election]] can be held, or until the original end of the term to which the vacating mayor was elected.

Some cities may also provide for a [[deputy mayor]] to be temporarily designated as "acting mayor" in the event that the incumbent mayor is temporarily unavailable, such as for health reasons or out-of-town travel, but still continues to hold the position and is expected to return to the duties of the office. In this latter capacity, the acting mayor's role is to ensure that city government business can continue in the regular mayor's absence, and the acting mayor is not deemed to have actually held the office of mayor.

The position of acting mayor is usually of considerably more importance in a [[mayor-council]] form of municipal government, where the mayor performs functions of day-to-day leadership, than it is in a [[council-manager]] form of government, where the [[city manager]] provides day-to-day leadership and the position of mayor is either a largely or entirely ceremonial one.

In some jurisdictions, the mayor's successor is not considered to be an acting mayor but rather fully mayor in his or her own right, much in the manner that the [[Vice President of the United States]] is not styled or considered to be [[Acting President of the United States|Acting President]] following the death or resignation of the [[President of the United States|President]], but rather President in every sense.

The '''profit impact of market strategy''' ('''PIMS''') database "yields solid evidence in support of both common sense and counter-intuitive principles for gaining and sustaining competitive advantage": Tom Peters and Nancy Austin. It was developed with the intention of providing [[empirical evidence]] of which [[business strategy|business strategies]] lead to success, across different industries. Data from the study is used to craft strategies in [[strategic management]] and [[marketing strategies|marketing strategy]]. The study identified several strategic variables that typically influence profitability. Some of the most important strategic variables studied were market share, product quality, investment intensity, and service quality, (all of which were found to be highly correlated with profitability).

According to Lancaster, Massingham and Ashford (''Essentials of Marketing'', 4th edition, McGraw Hill), PIMS seeks to address three basic questions:

* What is the typical profit rate for each type of business?
* Given current strategies in a company, what are the future operating results likely to be?
* What strategies are likely to help improve future operating results?

Dibb, Simkin, Pride and Ferrell (Marketing Concepts and Strategies, 4th European edition, Houghton Mifflin) cite six principal areas of information that PIMS holds on each business:

* characteristics of the business environment
* competitive position of the business
* structure of the production process
* how the budget is allocated
* strategic movement
* operating results.

== Brief history of PIMS ==

The PIMS project was started by [[Sidney Schoeffler]] working at [[General Electric]] in the 1960s, managed by the [[Marketing Science Institute]] in the early 1970s, and has been administered by the [[American Strategic Planning Institute]] since 1975.

It was initiated by senior managers at GE who wanted to know why some of their business units were more profitable than the others. With the help of Sidney Schoeffler they set up a research project in which each of their strategic business units reported their performance on dozens of variables. This was then expanded to outside companies in the early 1970s.

The initial survey, between 1970 and 1983, involved 2,600 [[strategic business unit]]s (SBU), from 200 companies. Today 12,500 observations exist for 4162 SBU's; PIMS is managed by PIMS Associates in London. Each SBU give information on the market within which they operated, the products they had brought to market and the efficacy of the strategies they had implemented.

The PIMS project analysed the data they had gathered to identify the options, problems, resources and opportunities faced by each SBU. Based on the spread of each business across different industries, it was hoped that the data could be drawn upon to provide other business, in the same industry, with empirical evidence of which strategies lead to increased profitability. The database continues to be updated and drawn upon by academics and companies today.

== Conclusions drawn by PIMS ==

The original PIMS data survey led the PIMS project to identify 37 variables which account for the majority of business success. Two leading marketing texts differ slightly on which variables are the most important, with Dibb, Simkin, Pride and Ferrell (p676) identifying:

* a strong market position
* high quality of product
* lower costs
* lower requirement for capital investment

and Lanacaster, Massingham and Ashford (p535) citing:

* market share
* image
* investment intensity
* market growth
* life cycle stage
* marketing expense to sales ratio.

While many of these seem obvious, PIMS has the advantage of providing empirical data that define quantitative relationships and back what some may consider to be common-sense.

== Participation in the PIMS study: cost and benefits ==

PIMS evaluated businesses' market position and suggest possible strategies, based on the data gathered from participating companies. Businesses wishing to use the service provide detailed information, including details of their:

* competitors and market
* balance sheet
* assumptions about future sales.

In return, PIMS provides four reports, described by Lancaster, Massingham and Ashford as:

1. A 'Par' report - showing the ROI and cash flows that are 'normal' for this type of business, given its market, competition, technology, and cost structure. 

2. A 'Strategy Analysis' report, which computes the predicted consequences of each of several alternative strategic actions, judged by information in similar businesses making similar moves, from a similar starting-point and in a similar business environment.

3. A 'Report on Look-Alikes' (ROLA), which aimed at predicting the best combination of strategies for that particular company, by analyzing strategically similar business more closely.

4. An 'Optimum Strategy' report, which is aimed at predicting the best combination of strategies for that particular company, again based on the experiences of other businesses in 'similar' circumstances.

== A critique of PIMS ==

Clearly, it could be argued that a database operating on information gathered in the period 1970 - 1983 is outdated. However data continues to be collected from participating companies and PIMS argues that it provides a unique source of time-series data, the conclusions from which have proven to be very stable over time.

It has also been suggested that PIMS is too heavily biased towards traditional, metal-bashing industries, such as [[car manufacturing]]; perhaps not surprising, considering the era in which the majority of the surveys were carried out. In reality, as of 2006, the 3,800+ businesses contained within the database includes data from the consumer, industrial and service sectors.

It is also heavily weighted towards large companies, at the expense of small entrepreneurial firms. This resulted from the data collection method used. Generally only larger firms are prepared to pay the consulting fee, provide the survey data, and in return have access to the database in which they can compare their business with other large businesses or SBUs. [[Mintzberg]] (1998) claims that because the database is dominated by large established firms, it is more suitable as a technique for assessing the state of "being there rather than getting there". (page 99)  This criticism is very important because if one is trying to get "average" results across industries to give us the "laws of the marketplace", a dubious enterprise as it is, the sampling strategy is important if one wants to obtain results that are representative.

The most important criticism leveled at PIMS is the fact that causation implies correlation but correlation does not imply causation.  One of the most important "findings" of the PIMS program was to find a statistically significant relationship between profitability and market share (see Buzzell and Gale (1987)).  The empirical work conducted by PIMS suggested that high market share yielded high profitability, but this correlation cannot be considered a "true" causal relationship because of the fact that correlation does not imply causation.  In the multivariate correlation analysis, high market share was  associated with high profits, but high profits could have been associated with high market share, or a third factor common to both could have caused the correlation.  Many analysts believe that it is possible to use a statistical causality test to determine causation, but if the whole problem is that correlation is insufficient to determine causation in the first place, then how can using another correlation, which is what is used in the tests, determine causation.

Another important criticism of PIMS is that it does not take into account heterogeneity in the data set.  The presumption of PIMS analysis is that the same "laws of the marketplace" apply to all industries.  However, the statistical assumptions employed in the econometric analysis make the assumption that all cross-sectional observations come from one statistical distribution that is the same for all cross-sectional observations.  This tends to be the Achilles heel of virtually all cross-sectional analyses.  If this homogeneous assumption is false, then cross-sectional observations are being drawn from different populations.  While one can use estimation techniques such as fixed-effects to control for different population means, co-variances can also differ across populations (meaning behavior differs across populations) and the only way one can control for this aspect is to run regressions on each population separately.  This means that the "laws of the marketplace" differ across populations, directly contradicting one of the main presumptions of using the PIMS data base for analysis.

Tellis and Golder (1996) claim that PIMS defines markets too narrowly. Respondents described their market very narrowly to give the appearance of high market share. They believe that this self reporting bias makes the conclusions suspect. They are also concerned that no defunct companies were included, leading to "survivor bias".

Since 1976, through the '''Rolex Awards for Enterprise''', [[Rolex]] has supported exceptional individuals who have the courage and conviction to take on major challenges; men and women who have a spirit of enterprise, initiating extraordinary projects that make the world a better place.

Created to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Rolex Oyster, the first waterproof watch and an important milestone in watchmaking, the Rolex Awards foster the values that underpin Rolex: quality, ingenuity, determination and, above all, the enterprising spirit that has driven the company since its beginning.

From the start, the Awards were designed to fill a void in corporate philanthropy by supporting exceptional individuals around the world, pioneers who had no or little access to traditional funding and were responding to major challenges with original and innovative projects that advance human knowledge and well-being.

The support given by Rolex to Award winners has had a catalytic impact and has, in many cases, transformed lives and communities. It has also stimulated new ways of thinking about common problems in areas as diverse as creating technologies that improved lives, saving endangered ecosystems, protecting the oceans, exploring new frontiers on the planet, or pioneering advances in science and health.

== Young Laureates ==

In 2010, the '''Rolex Awards''' introduced a programme for Young Laureates. Its goal was to foster innovation in the next generation by selecting five young enterprising individuals and providing them with funding and publicity for their projects.

'''Roman Janoušek''' (born 3 July 1968) is an influential billionaire businessman and [[lobbyist]] from the [[Czech Republic]].&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-17521319 | title=Fall of Czech lobbyist Janousek dubbed 'Voldemort' | publisher=BBC | accessdate=March 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2014 he started serving a 4.5-year sentence he received for his hit-and-run automobile accident in March 2012.

==Business activities==
In June 1993 Janoušek co-founded Medea Real. He later made a lot of money in magazine publishing and real estate.

==Allegations of corruption==
Janoušek has been under investigation regarding allegations of tender-rigging and [[bribery]]. It is also alleged that his friendship with [[Pavel Bém]], mayor of [[Prague]] between 2002 and 2010, helped him in developing his business activities.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; He was one of the targets of the [[2013 Czech political corruption scandal]] which led to the downfall of [[List of Prime Ministers of the Czech Republic|Prime Minister]] [[Petr Nečas]] and his [[Petr Nečas's Cabinet|coalition government]].

==Hit-and-run==
On April 30, 2014, Janoušek was handed a 3-year prison sentence for a [[Hit and run (vehicular)|hit-and-run]] accident that took place in Prague in March 2012. It is claimed that he had been driving drunk when he collided with another car. He ran over the 51-year-old woman driver causing grievous bodily harm when she attempted to stop him from leaving the scene. Janoušek faced ten years in prison.&lt;ref name="Czech Radio"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://radio.cz/en/section/curraffrs/prague-court-sentences-infamous-political-fixer-to-three-years-in-prison | title=Prague court sentences infamous political fixer to three years in prison | publisher=Radio Praha | accessdate=April 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the prosecution and Janoušek appealed the verdict.&lt;ref name="ihned140430"&gt;http://zpravy.ihned.cz/cesko/c1-62110180-janousek-je-vinen-rekl-soud-za-nehodu-ma-jit-na-tri-roky-za-mrize-a-pet-let-nesmi-ridit&lt;/ref&gt; The court eventually decided to increase Janoušek's prison sentence to 4.5 years and raised the term of his driving ban from 5 years to 7, stating that the injury sustained by the other driver was not the result of an accident but of a deliberate criminal act on the part of Janoušek.&lt;ref&gt;http://zpravy.idnes.cz/roman-janousek-u-vrchniho-soudu-dap-/krimi.aspx?c=A140915_152949_krimi_cen&lt;/ref&gt; On November 18, 2014, Janoušek began serving his sentence in the Brno city jail.&lt;ref&gt;http://zpravy.idnes.cz/janousek-musi-nastoupit-do-vezeni-d54-/krimi.aspx?c=A141118_101943_krimi_bse&lt;/ref&gt; Both the prosecution and Janoušek appealed to the [[Supreme Court of the Czech Republic]] but the verdict was upheld on July 28, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://zpravy.aktualne.cz/domaci/trest-pro-janouska-plati-nejvyssi-soud-dovolani-zamitl/r~c5c2ba30353411e593f4002590604f2e/&lt;/ref&gt;

After struggling to avoid [[insolvency]] throughout 2011, the company petitioned for bankruptcy following the failure of a Chinese consortium to complete a purchase of the company; the purchase had been blocked by former owner GM, which opposed the transfer of technology and production rights to a Chinese company. In 2012, Spyker filed a lawsuit against GM asking for US$3 billion in damages after GM had attempted to block the deals between Spyker and Chinese automaker [[Youngman]], who were investing in Saab Automobile. Consequently, Saab was forced to file bankruptcy in 2012. Spyker's claim was dismissed in June 2013.

==2010==
On 26 January 2010, General Motors confirmed that Spyker and GM had come to an agreement allowing Spyker to purchase Saab,&lt;ref name= Autocar.co.uk&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autocar.co.uk/News/NewsArticle/AllCars/246896/|title=Spyker buys Saab|accessdate=2010-01-26|work=autocar.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; subject to regulatory and government approval; the sale was completed on February 23, 2010.&lt;ref name="Saabs United: Spyker Cars finalizes the purchase of Saab"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saabsunited.com/2010/02/spyker-cars-finalizes-the-purchase-of-saab.html|title= Spyker Cars finalizes the purchase of Saab |accessdate=2010-02-23|work=SaabsUnited.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; General Motors would continue to supply Saab with engines and transmissions, and also completed vehicles in the shape of the new Saab 9-4x from GM's Mexican factory. The deal included a loan from the European Investment Bank, guaranteed by the Swedish government. It comprised US$74m in cash up front, payable to GM by July 2010, and shares in Spyker in the amount of US$320m.

Saab announced that it was going to build its US headquarters in Royal Oak, Michigan. A new Saab 9-3 was confirmed for 2012, while production restarted at the Saab plant in Sweden in March 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=22 March 2010 |url=http://www.autocar.co.uk/News/NewsArticle/AllCars/248400/ |title=Saab production resumes |publisher=Autocar.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Victor Muller]], CEO and founder of Spyker Cars stated in an interview that the take-over was financed solely by [[Vladimir Aleksandrovich Antonov|Vladimir Antonov]] with the knowledge of General Motors.&lt;ref&gt;''[[NRC Handelsblad]]'', May 22, 2010, page 17:"''[..]Antonov heeft mij voor honderd procent gefinancierd. Ik leende van hem de 74 miljoen dollar die wij voor de overname contant aan GM moesten betalen. Dat wisten de Amerikanen overigens ook.''", English translation: "[..]Antonov financed me for hundred percent. I borrowed from him the 74 million dollar that we had to pay in cash to GM for the acquisition. The Americans knew this too."&lt;/ref&gt;

In July, the company said it expected to sell between 50,000 to 55,000 vehicles in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.swedishwire.com/business/5572-swedish-carmaker-saab-swings-to-profit |title=Swedish carmaker Saab swings to profit |date=2010-07-28 |author=Johan Nylander |publisher=The Swedish Wire}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of its expansion programme Saab announced plans to return to China after General Motors withdrew the brand from the Chinese market in 2008 due to the [[financial crisis (2007–present)|global financial meltdown]], Saab planned to sell between 2,000 and 5,000 cars initially and should the reception of the vehicle go well, it planned to move production to China as well, as the deal would have seen 10 dealerships open. The deal was to be signed with China Automobile Trading Co. Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-12-20/saab-will-re-enter-china-three-years-after-general-motors-halted-exports.html |title=Saab Auto Signs Deal to Re-enter China; Spyker Soars |publisher=Bloomberg |date= 2010-12-20|accessdate=2010-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October, the company revised its production target for the year to 30,000 to 35,000 vehicles from 45,000 vehicles, this was down to the fact that it needed more time to recover from plant shutdown for two months at the beginning of the year and reverse liquidation proceedings.
It was reported that it was the second time forecast was cut in less than three months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-10-29/spyker-drops-as-saab-production-goal-cut-loss-widens.html |title=Spyker Drops as Saab Production Goal Cut, Loss Widens |date=2010-10-29 |author=Ola Kinnander |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110914014252/http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-10-29/spyker-drops-as-saab-production-goal-cut-loss-widens.html |archivedate=September 14, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually Saab sold 31,696 cars in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Aaron Gray-Block, Hans Peters | url = https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/01/06/spyker-idUSLDE7050B820110106 | title = Spyker upbeat as Saab sales meet lowered 2010 guidance |publisher = Reuters |date=2011-01-06 |accessdate=2011-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2011==
On February 25, Spyker Cars N.V. announced that it had agreed to sell the sports car arm to focus on Saab. Spyker intended to change its name, in May, to include the Saab name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kinnander|first=Ola|title=Spyker to Sell Sports-Car Unit to Vladimir Antonov to Focus on Saab Brand|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-02-24/spyker-agrees-to-sell-sports-car-unit-to-vladimir-antonov-to-reduce-debt.html|publisher=Bloomberg.com|accessdate=8 March 2011|date=2011-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of April several suppliers halted shipment of components to the Trollhättan assembly plant because of unpaid invoices. As a result Saab had to stop production on April 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Mike Nesbit, David Cowell | url = https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/05/spyker-saab-idUSLDE73416520110405 | title = Saab production halted anew by supply woes |publisher = Reuters |date= 2011-04-05 |accessdate=2011-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 May, Spyker Cars reached an agreement with Chinese automaker [[Hawtai Motor]] to obtain emergency funding for Saab, aiming to restart production within a week.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/05/06/spykercars-saab-idUSLDE7450JT20110506 UPDATE 2-Saab shareholder hopefuls file for Swedish nod] reuters.com, Fri May 6, 2011 7:25am EDT&lt;/ref&gt; On May 12, the deal with Hawtai collapsed when it failed to get the necessary approvals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cowan |first=Roberta B. |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/05/12/us-saab-spykercars-idUSTRE74B14V20110512 |title=Saabs Chinese rescue deal falls through |publisher=Reuters.com |date= 2011-05-12|accessdate=2011-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spyker was still hopeful that a deal could be made with Hawtai. [[Great Wall Motor]], another Chinese car maker, was also rumoured to be in talks with Spyker about investing; however, this was denied by Great Wall on May 13.

On May 16, Spyker announced that it had signed a memorandum of understanding with China's [[Pang Da]] Automobile Trade Co. (Pang Da) that would give Saab the financing needed to restart production, and give Pang Da an equity stake in Spyker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spykercars.nl/download/artikel/Spyker_PD.pdf |title=Saab Automobile and Spyker Enter Into MOU With Pang Da Automobile On Distribution/Manufacturing Partnership For China And Equity Participation|publisher=Spyker|accessdate=18 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 8, Saab said it had stopped production due to an insufficient supply of parts. This occurred only two weeks after resuming production following a seven-week hiatus. Production was due to start again on August 9.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Swade |url=http://inside.saab.com/press-release-saab-automobile-update-on-production-and-sale-and-lease-back-of-saab-property/ |title=Saab Automobile update on production and sale and lease back of Saab Property &amp;#124; Inside Saab by Steven Wade |publisher=Inside.saab.com |date=2011-07-07 |accessdate=2011-08-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110910074851/http://inside.saab.com/press-release-saab-automobile-update-on-production-and-sale-and-lease-back-of-saab-property/ |archivedate=2011-09-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 23, Saab announced that it was unable to pay June salaries to the entire workforce of 3,800 due to lack of funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Erik Högström|first=Marit Sundberg|title=''Saab kan inte betala ut löner'' (Saab cannot pay salaries) ''(Swedish)''|url=http://gt.expressen.se/nyheter/1.2478773/saab-kan-inte-betala-ut-loner|publisher=Expressen.se}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Saab auto can't pay wages to 3,800 staff|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2011/0623/saab-business.html|publisher=RTE.ie | date=2011-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trade union [[IF Metall]] gave Saab seven days to pay the salaries to their employees; otherwise, IF Metall threatened to force a liquidation of the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''IF Metall hotar Saab med konkurs'' (IF Metall threatens Saab with bankruptcy) (''Swedish'')|url=http://di.se/|publisher=DI.se}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lindqvist Sjöström|first=Christina|title="Saab har sju dagar på sig" (Saab has seven days to avoid bankruptcy) ''(Swedish)''|url=http://www.e24.se/business/verkstadsindustri/saab-har-sju-dagar-pa-sig_2888442.e24|publisher=E24.se}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 29, Saab employees were paid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dn.se/ekonomi/nytt-lan-pa-25-miljoner-euro-till-saab |title=DN: Saab betalar ut lönerna |publisher=Dn.se |date=2011-06-29 |accessdate=2011-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June, [[Youngman|China Youngman Automobile Group]] (Youngman) and Pang Da announced their intention to buy 54% of Saab for €245&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.svd.se/naringsliv/muller-sakrar-kina_6285998.svd |title=SvD: Muller säkrar Kina |language=Swedish |publisher=Svd.se |date= |accessdate=2011-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dn.se/ekonomi/hemligt-mote-om-saab-i-stockholm |title=DN: Hemligt möte om Saab i Stockholm |publisher=Dn.se |date=2011-07-01 |accessdate=2011-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also announced that they would finance three new models, [[Saab 9-1]], Saab 9-6 and Saab 9-7.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyteknik.se/nyheter/fordon_motor/bilar/article3213612.ece |title=Ny Teknik: Tre nya Saab-modeller ska tas fram |language=Swedish |publisher=Nyteknik.se |date= |accessdate=2011-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Swade |url=http://inside.saab.com/press-release-swedish-automobile-saab-automobile-pang-da-and-youngman-convert-non-binding-mou-into-binding-agreement-and-agree-on-additional-new-product-joint-venture/ |title=Swedish Automobile, Saab Automobile, Pang Da And Youngman Convert Non-Binding MoU On Equity Investment Into Binding Agreement And Agree On Additional New Product Joint Venture Subject To Regulatory Approvals |publisher=Inside.saab.com |date=2011-07-04 |accessdate=2011-08-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811034526/http://inside.saab.com/press-release-swedish-automobile-saab-automobile-pang-da-and-youngman-convert-non-binding-mou-into-binding-agreement-and-agree-on-additional-new-product-joint-venture/ |archivedate=2011-08-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 26, Saab announced that it was unable to pay July salaries to 1,600 [[white-collar worker]]s. The company was also unable to verify when the salaries would be paid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Ingen julilön till Saabs tjänstemän'' (No July salaries to Saabs white-collar workers)|language=Swedish |url=http://www.e24.se/business/ovrig-industri/ingen-julilon-till-saabs-tjansteman_2952042.e24|publisher=E24.se}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the entire workforce of [[blue-collar worker]]s were paid on July 25.

On July 27, it was reported that Bahama-based Gemini Fund would ensure employee salaries did not pay out to Saab, because of the uncertainty arising in securities that would protect the payment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Antonov-kopplad fond håller inne Saablån (Antonov-linked fund withholds loans to Saab) (Swedish)|url=http://www.e24.se/business/ovrig-industri/antonov-kopplad-fond-haller-inne-saablan_2953056.e24|publisher=E24.se}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day it was also confirmed by Russian businessman Vladimir Antonov's Swedish representative Lars Carlström that Antonov has close ties to the fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Strandberg|first=Love| title=''Antonov bekräftar koppling till Bahamasfond'' (Antonov confirm connection to the Bahamas Fund) (Swedish)|url=http://www.e24.se/business/ovrig-industri/antonov-bekraftar-koppling-till-bahamasfond_2953786.e24|publisher=E24.se}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 28, the trade union [[Unionen]] announced that if Saab did not pay the white-collar workers within two weeks, Unionen will force the company into bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gad|first=Magda|title=''Nu hotas Saab med konkurs'' (Now Saab threatened with bankruptcy.) (Swedish)|url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article13386336.ab| publisher=Aftonbladet}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day, [[European Investment Bank]] (EIB) announced it had rejected the request from Vladimir Antonov to become part-owner of Saab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EIB bryter tystnaden: Vi släpper inte in Antonov (EIB breaks the silence: We will not let Antonov in) (Swedish)|url=http://www.e24.se/business/ovrig-industri/eib-bryter-tystnaden-vi-slapper-inte-in-antonov_2956926.e24|publisher=E24.se}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to that decision, the director general of [[Swedish National Debt Office]], [[Bo Lundgren]], severely criticised the EIB for its treatment of Antonov in recent months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Strandberg|first=Love|title=Bo Lundgren sågar EIB:s hantering av Antonov (Lundgren criticize the EIB's management of Antonov) (Swedish)|url=http://www.e24.se/business/ovrig-industri/bo-lundgren-sagar-eibs-hantering-av-antonov_2957030.e24|publisher=E24.se}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 5, Saab paid the salaries to the white-collar workers through [[equity issuance]] where the Gemini Fund bought 5m shares in Saab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=[[Tidningarnas Telegrambyrå|TT]]|first=|title=Saabanställda har fått sin julilön (The employees of Saab have received their salaries) |language=Swedish |url=http://gt.expressen.se/nyheter/1.2518826/saabanstallda-har-fatt-sin-julilon|publisher=Expressen.se}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 17, the [[Enforcement Administration (Sweden)|Swedish Enforcement Administration]] (SEA) started a [[distraint]] process of Saab as a result of the company not settling its debts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://di.se/Default.aspx?sr=6&amp;tr=291817&amp;rlt=0&amp;pid=242709__ArticlePageProvider&amp;epslanguage=sv |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120716230526/http://di.se/Default.aspx?sr=6&amp;tr=291817&amp;rlt=0&amp;pid=242709__ArticlePageProvider&amp;epslanguage=sv |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-16 |title=Nu startar utmätningen av Saab ''(Swedish)'' |publisher=''[[Dagens Industri]]'' |author=Afroditi Logothetis |language=Swedish |date=2011-08-17 |accessdate=2011-08-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 19, it was confirmed that SEA had more than 90 cases with claims amounting to 169 million SEK ($25.5 million/€18.4 million) against Saab, of which 22 were in the distraint phase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=TT |title=Fler utmätningar mot Saab (More foreclosures against Saab) ''(Swedish)'' |url=http://www.va.se/nyheter/2011/08/18/fragetecken-kring-saabs-styrnin/index.xml |publisher=[[Veckans Affärer|VA]].se |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927125718/http://www.va.se/nyheter/2011/08/18/fragetecken-kring-saabs-styrnin/index.xml |archivedate=2011-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day, the SEA found an account at [[Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken]], which they hoped contained at least SEK5.1&amp;nbsp;million ($0.8&amp;nbsp;million/€0.555&amp;nbsp;million) which would be used to pay off Saabs debt to [[Kongsberg Automotive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Åkesson|first=Bertil|title=Första utmätningen mot Saab i gång ''(Swedish)''|url=http://www.dn.se/ekonomi/konsulter-ska-hitta-pengar-at-saab|publisher=[[Dagens Nyheter|DN]].se}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 23, Saab spokesperson, Gunilla Gustav, announced there was a chance the August salaries may not be paid because of lack of funding. One reason is that Saab had not received the money it was promised. The president of Unionen, Cecilia Fahlberg, was highly critical of unpaid salaries becoming an issue for the third time during the summer, and said the union would restart bankruptcy proceedings unless the salaries were paid. As a result of the announcement, shares of Saabs parent company, Swedish Automobiles, fell by 20%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=TT|title=''Saablöner kan bli sena – igen'' (Salaries may be late – again) ''(Swedish)''|url=http://www.svd.se/naringsliv/saabloner-kan-bli-sena-igen_6409116.svd|publisher=[[Svenska Dagbladet|SvD.se]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 25, it was confirmed that the August salaries had not been paid to the blue-collar employees, and most likely its white-collar workers also, whose salaries were rumoured to be paid on August 26.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lönnroth|first=Veronica|title=Inga löner i dag – sannolikt inga i morgon (No salary today – probably not tomorrow either) ''(Swedish)''|url=http://ttela.se/ekonomi/saab/1.1335885-inga-loner-i-dag-sannolikt-inga-i-morgon|publisher=Ttela.se}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day, SEA announced that it had foreclosed on about SEK50&amp;nbsp;million (US$7.9&amp;nbsp;million/€5.45&amp;nbsp;million) and it was entitled to the money from the company's payroll account if it didn't not find the remainder earlier. Saab had to have approximately SEK100&amp;nbsp;million (US$15.8&amp;nbsp;million/€10.9&amp;nbsp;million) each month in the payroll account in order to remunerate its entire workforce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Saab-löner kan gå till kronofogden'' (Salaries can go to the Enforcement Administration) ''(Swedish)''|url=http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=104&amp;artikel=4662102|publisher=[[Sveriges Radio|SR]].se}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 26, Swedish Automobile announced that they had pushed back the interim report until the following week (week 35).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Saab skjuter fram delårsrapport (Saab Automobile pushes forward the interim report) ''(Swedish)''|url=http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=83&amp;artikel=4664180|publisher=SR.se}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day it was reported that Saab was preparing an application for reconstruction of the company. Saab was lacking the appropriate funds to start production or pay salaries to its employees and debts to its subcontractors.&lt;ref name="SR.se"&gt;{{cite web|title=Saab förbereder ansökan om rekonstruktion (Saab is preparing an application for reconstruction) ''(Swedish)''| url=http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=83&amp;artikel=4664569|publisher=SR.se}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 31, after a five-day delay, Saab released its interim report which announced a loss of €201.5&amp;nbsp;million with revenues of €359&amp;nbsp;million after the first six months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Martikainen|first=Rebecka|title=Extremt utsatt läge för Saab (Extremely vulnerable position for Saab) ''(Swedish)''|url=http://www.expressen.se/nyheter/1.2546193/extremt-utsatt-lage-for-saab|publisher=Expressen.se}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also reported that Saab was preparing an application for reconstruction of the company. Again this is as a result of insufficient funds preventing the start of production, payment of employee salaries, and payment of subcontractor debts. In 2011 Saabs Trollhättan plant ended production.

On September 7, Saab Automobile petitioned Swedish court for a voluntary reconstruction. The aim was to protect the company from creditor's claims until Chinese government approval could be completed for a €245 million deal agreed in June 2011 with Pang Da and [[Zhejiang Youngman Lotus Automobile]] (Zhejiang Youngman).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Trollhättan TT |url=http://www.svd.se/naringsliv/rekonstruktion-igen-for-saab_6447742.svd |title=Rekonstruktion igen för Saab &amp;#124; Näringsliv &amp;#124; SvD |language=sv |publisher=Svd.se |date= |accessdate=2012-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, the Swedish courts rejected Saabs reconstruction petition, expressing doubt that the automaker could secure the funding necessary to continue.&lt;ref&gt;

On 28 October, media reports stated that the Chinese carmaker [[Youngman]] and the Chinese automotive retailer Pang Da had agreed to a joint US$140&amp;nbsp;million takeover of Saab Automobile and its UK dealer network unit from [[Swedish Automobile]], with Youngman and Pang Da taking 60 and 40&amp;nbsp;percent stakes respectively.&lt;ref&gt;

On 6 December, GM announced that it would not continue its licenses to GM patents and technology to Saab if the company had been sold to Pang Da and Zhejiang Youngman, stating that the new owner's use of the technology is not in the best interest of GM investors. This was somewhat ironic since most of the patents in question were Saabs in origin but surrendered to GM's ownership back in 2000.&lt;ref name='google patent search for "saab automobile'&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/search?tbo=p&amp;tbm=pts&amp;hl=en&amp;q=%22saab+automobile%22&amp;num=10|title=Google search for 'saab automobile'|accessdate=11 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of this, Saab started working on a new proposal which would not change the original ownership structure and would not include a Chinese partner as an owner of the company, but instead as a 50% owner of a new daughter company.

On 19 December 2011 with no alternatives left after GM continued to block any form of involvement with a Chinese partner, Saab officially filed for bankruptcy after a three-year fight for survival. Under Sweden's bankruptcy laws, a party that files for bankruptcy can be bought out of bankruptcy. Therefore, this was not the end of Saab.

==2012==
In the aftermath, both Saab’s CEO Victor Muller and Saab’s manager of government relations, Anna Petre,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://se.linkedin.com/pub/anna-petre/6/bb1/194 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120713104331/http://se.linkedin.com/pub/anna-petre/6/bb1/194 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-13 |title=Anna Petre – Sverige &amp;#124; LinkedIn |language=sv |publisher=Se.linkedin.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; stated that the original deal with Pang Da and Youngman that would have given the two Chinese companies 54% of Saab’s parent company, Swedish Automobile (SWAN), was cleared with GM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://translate.google.se/translate?sl=sv&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=sv&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;layout=2&amp;eotf=1&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fttela.se%2Fekonomi%2Fsaab%2F1.1474746-anna-petre-en-av-de-fyra-sista&amp;act=url |title=Google Översätt |language=sv |publisher=Translate.google.se |date= |accessdate=2011-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The turbulence created by Saab’s administrator, Guy Lofalk, leading the Chinese to believe they could take a 100% ownership, and the subsequent bid for 100% of SWAN, supposedly severely hurt the relationship with GM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvl8dZjZF9U |title=December 19 Press Conference |publisher=YouTube |date=2011-12-19 |accessdate=2011-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muller blamed Guy Lofalk for the collapse of the talks. He claimed that Lofalk had led the Chinese investors to believe they could become sole owners of the company. Muller also said he [Lofalk] knew that sole ownership was impossible. GM's had strong concerns about licenses. "Until this problem arose the relationship with GM was excellent," Muller said.

There is some doubt as to the validity of both Muller and Petre's opinions. Both General Motors and Guy Lofalk have denied their claims. General Motors also refute Mullers statements that they approved his sale of Saab to Chinese parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nordström |first=Jens |date=2014-08-28 |title=Saabs sista strid |publisher=Lind&amp;Co |pages=208–239 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 26 January 2010 Saab was managed by the board, with Victor Muller presiding.

Victor Muller, as CEO of Spyker cars, is now suing General Motors and claims it is accountable for the bankruptcy of Saab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-06/spyker-sues-gm-for-3-billion-over-saab-bankruptcy.html |title='Spyker Sues GM for $3 Billion Over Saab Bankruptcy'|publisher=Bloomberg |date=2012-06-08 |accessdate=2012-06-08 |first1=Erik |last1=Larson |first2=Phil |last2=Milford}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muller said: "Ever since we were forced to file for Saab Automobile’s bankruptcy in December of last year, we have worked relentlessly on the preparation for this lawsuit which seeks to compensate Spyker and Saab for the massive damages we have incurred as a result of GM’s unlawful actions". Obviously Muller changed his opinion and now blames General Motors instead of Guy Lofalk. In June 2013 the claim was dismissed by a US federal judge.

On 29 January 2012 the receivers handling Saab’s bankruptcy stated that discussions were being held with four or five interested parties with the intention of buying Saab out of bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ttela.se/ekonomi/saab/1.1510882-fem-vill-kopa-hela-saab |title=Fem vill köpa hela Saab – Saab |language=sv |publisher=www.ttela.se |date= |accessdate=2012-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parties that publicly showed interest were China's [[Youngman]], Indian [[Mahindra and Mahindra]] and the Turkish private equity firm Brightwell Holdings. On 14 February 2012 the receivers of the bankruptcy let the press know that there were now six or seven interested parties to buy Saab as a whole and restart production of Saab vehicles and that they aimed to have a final candidate before the end of February.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Anna-Karin Nils Gustafsson |url=http://ttela.se/ekonomi/saab/1.1528950--alla-intressenter-finns-kvar- |title="Alla intressenter finns kvar" – Saab |language=sv |publisher=www.ttela.se |date= |accessdate=2012-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 6, 2012, three companies placed bids for complete Saab Automobile buy out; Mahindra and Mahindra and Youngman with bids in the region of US$300m-400m,&lt;ref name="indiatimes1"&gt;{{cite news|author= |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/Tata-Motors-places-bid-for-Saab-Automobile-Report/articleshow/12159611.cms |title=Tata Motors places bid for Saab Automobile: Report – The Times of India |publisher=Timesofindia.indiatimes.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Tata Motors with an alleged bid of US$350m, which was later denied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.se/39508/20120306/ |title=Indian automaker places bid for Saab but later they strongly denied the claim: report |publisher=Thelocal.se |date= |accessdate=2012-04-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422233155/http://www.thelocal.se/39508/20120306 |archivedate=2012-04-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 10, 2012, many documents regarding the bankruptcy became official and the deadline for final bids of Saab Automobile was reached. Since the first reconstruction in 2009, Saab had gathered a debt of approximately €1.3&amp;nbsp;billion. The total value of all assets was found to be approximately €360m. The potential sale of Saab would therefore mean that many with claims on Saab Automobile would not be paid. GM’s claim of approximately €220m would be prioritized because it consisted of preference shares. The handful of previous interested parties in buying Saab Automobile out of bankruptcy were confirmed to have handed in final bids and were all intending to produce Saab cars in Trollhättan in one form or another. The receivers hoped to have a deal done before summer. The receivers also found that the sale of the Saab Automobile property in the summer of 2011 may not have been legitimate and the property may have to be returned to Saab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Anna-Karin Nils Gustavsson |url=http://ttela.se/ekonomi/saab/1.1587482-saab-ar-varderat-till-3-6-miljarder |title=Saab är värderat till 3,6 miljarder – Saab |language=sv |publisher=www.ttela.se |date= |accessdate=2012-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Valdemar Lönnroth |url=http://ttela.se/ekonomi/saab/1.1588198-flera-intressenter-slass-om-saab |title=Flera intressenter slåss om Saab – Saab |language=sv |publisher=www.ttela.se |date= |accessdate=2012-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dn.se/ekonomi/deadline-for-slutbud-pa-saab |title=Youngman bland slutbudgivarna |publisher=DN.SE |date= |accessdate=2012-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 April 2012, a meeting on Saab’s bankruptcy was held at the District Court of Vänersborg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.konkursboet.se/ |title=Saab bankruptcy site |publisher=Konkursboet |date=December 2011 |accessdate=2012-04-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422092741/http://en.konkursboet.se/ |archivedate=2012-04-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The official receivers in charge of the Saab liquidation valued the assets at US$500m and the debt at US$2,000m. After subtracting the value of the assets, Saab leaves a debt of US$1,500m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303772904577335704135209644 |title= Saab Auto Left $2 Billion in Debts | publisher=Wall Street Journal |date= April 2012|accessdate=2012-04-27 |first=Christina |last=Zander}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 May 2012, [[Saab AB]] (aerospace and defence company) CEO Håkan Buskhe spoke to the media for the first time in an interview regarding the bankruptcy of Saab Automobile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.svd.se/naringsliv/branscher/industri-och-fordon/buskhe-satsa-i-sverige-eller-glom-saab-kopet_7236145.svd |title=Buskhe: Satsa i Sverige eller glöm Saab-köpet &amp;#124; SvD |language=sv |publisher=Svd.se |date=1987-10-20 |accessdate=2012-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saab AB has the rights to the name Saab Automobile and has the possibility to block the use of the name for any potential buyer of Saab Automobile. Buskhe said that as long as any potential buyer would continue production and development in [[Trollhättan]] Saab AB would grant the use of the name but that it will block any deal with a buyer who had the intent of taking production and development outside Sweden. It was also mentioned that Saab AB has strategic partnerships with one of the interested parties in buying Saab Automobile, Indian [[Mahindra Group|Mahindra]], regarding aerospace and defence and that Saab AB is trying to sell its [[Saab Jas 39 Gripen|Jas 39 Gripen]] fighter jet to India. However, Buskhe did not want to comment on [[Mahindra Group|Mahindra]]'s offer on Saab Automobile.

On 6 August 2012, Spyker, represented by the law firm [[Patton Boggs]] filed a lawsuit against General Motors in the United States District Court of the Eastern District of Michigan claiming US$3&amp;nbsp;[[1000000000 (number)|billion]] in damages for the actions GM took in the fall of 2011 to stop the various proposed deals between Spyker and [[Youngman]] concerning Saab Automobile where Youngman claimed to be ready to invest several billion dollars in Saab Automobile to guarantee its future. More precisely, under the Automotive Technology License Agreement (ATLA) between GM Global Technology Operations Inc (GTO) and Saab, GM refused licensing of the platforms and technology in Saab cars if any Chinese party would be involved in Saabs ownership structure. To solve this issue, Spyker and Youngman came up with a deal where Youngman would provide Saab with a loan of €200 million which would be converted into an equity interest in Saab only after Saab ceased using GM technology in its vehicles. Despite this, GM maintained that it would still refuse licensing of platforms and technology needed for production of Saab cars in Trollhättan and also threatened to cease 9-4X production at GM's plant in Mexico, should the deal go through. Consequently, the deal finally collapsed and Saab was forced to file for bankruptcy. According to Spyker, the actions taken by GM were not legal. Since Saab had been in receivership since the bankruptcy, and would be until the deal with Nevs was closed, Spyker and the receivers of Saab Automobile had entered into an agreement where Spyker would bear the costs of the litigation in exchange for 90% of the claim if the case is successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hugin.info/136917/R/1632015/523382.pdf |title=hugin.info |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spykercars.nl/?pag=50&amp;jaar=&amp;nid=692 |title=www.spykercars.nl |publisher=www.spykercars.nl |date= |accessdate=2012-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130121001408/http://www.autonews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20120806/OEM/120809929/1131/gm-sued-by-saabs-parent-company-for-blocking-reorganization www.autonews.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Valdemar Lönnroth valdemar.lonnroth@ttela.se |url=http://ttela.se/ekonomi/saab/1.1723212-spyker-stammer-gm-pa-20-miljarder-kronor |title=ttela.se |language=sv |publisher=ttela.se |date= |accessdate=2012-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2013==
In June 2013, the district court dismissed the lawsuit, ruling that General Motors was within its rights to block the sale.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.autonews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20130610/OEM/130619985/saab-parents-3-billion-lawsuit-versus-gm-thrown-out-by-u-s-judge#axzz2VvNFiUSV |title=Saab parent's $3 billion lawsuit versus GM thrown out by U.S. judge}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saab was purchased by [[National Electric Vehicle Sweden]] in June 2012, with production of the [[Saab 9-3]] resuming in December 2013.

'''Solar Roadways Incorporated''' is an American company based in [[Sandpoint, Idaho]] aiming to develop [[solar power]]ed road panels to form a [[smart highway]].

Their proof-of-concept technology combines a transparent driving surface with underlying solar cells, electronics and sensors to act as a solar array with programmable capability. The road panels are to be made from recycled materials and incorporate photovoltaic cells.&lt;ref name="Solar Roadways"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://singularityhub.com/2014/05/22/following-the-solar-brick-road-to-clean-energy-and-smart-roadways/ |title= Following the Solar Brick Road |first=  Cameron |last= Scott |date= May 22, 2014 |publisher= [[Singularity University]] |work= [[SingularityHUB]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="trentacoste" /&gt; The project has received criticism in regards to its feasibility and its efficiency compared to traditional solar panel installations.

==History==
[[File:Solar Roadway Parking Lot Prototype.jpg|thumb|Solar Roadway panel prototypes]]
The company was founded in 2006 by Scott and Julie Brusaw, with Scott as President and CEO. They envisioned replacing asphalt surfaces with structurally-engineered solar panels capable of withstanding vehicular traffic.&lt;ref name=trentacoste/&gt;  The proposed system would require the development of strong, transparent, and self-cleaning glass with the necessary traction and impact-resistance properties at competitive cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/driving-on-glass-solar-roads/ |title= Driving on Glass Solar Roads |work= Scientific American |date= October 6, 2009 |accessdate= February 24, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Solar Roadways received a $100,000 [[Small Business Innovation Research]] (SBIR) grant from the United States [[Department of Transportation]] (USDOT) for Phase I to determine the feasibility of the proposed project.&lt;ref name="SBIR-PhaseI"&gt;{{cite web |title= Solar Roadways: Phase I Grant |url= http://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/355952 |publisher= Small Business Innovation Research }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2011, Solar Roadways received $750,000 SBIR grant from the DOT for Phase II to develop and build a solar parking lot;&lt;ref name="SBIR-PhaseII"&gt;{{cite web |title= Solar Roadways: Phase II Grant |url= http://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/362311 |publisher= Small Business Innovation Research }}&lt;/ref&gt; from this, they built a {{convert|12|by|36|ft|m|adj=on}} parking lot covered with hexagonal glass-covered solar panels sitting on top of a concrete base, heated to prevent snow and ice accumulation, with [[LED]]s to illuminate road lines and display messages. According to the Brusaws, the panels can sustain a {{convert|250,000|lb|kg|abbr=on}} load.&lt;ref name=wired&gt;{{cite web |first= Keith |last= Barry |url= https://www.wired.com/2014/05/solar-road/ |title= This Parking Lot Is Paved with Solar Panels  |work= [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |date= May 8, 2014 |accessdate= May 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2014, the company started a [[crowdfunding]] drive at [[Indiegogo]] to raise money so they could get the product into production. The campaign raised 2.2 million dollars and became Indiegogo’s most popular campaign ever in terms of the number of backers it attracted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.transportation.gov/fastlane/new-pavement-system-supported-solar-panels|title=New Pavement System...

The first public installation was in Jeff Jones Town Square in Sandpoint, Idaho. It opened to the public on September 30, 2016. As a pilot install it is for walkways only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boiseweekly.com/boise/sandpoint-will-light-up-solar-roads-this-friday/Content?oid=3899013 |title=Sandpoint Will Light Up Solar Roads This Friday |work=Boise Weekly |author=George Prentice |date=September 28, 2016 |accessdate=September 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This installation consists of 30 Solar Roadways SR3 panels covering an area of roughly {{convert|150|sqft|m2}}. The cost of this installation was roughly $60,000 with the majority of the money coming from a grant from the Idaho Department of Commerce ($47,134), and a $10,000 grant from the Sandpoint Urban Renewal Agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=City Council Minutes 7/20/2016|url=http://www.cityofsandpoint.com/your-government/city-council-minutes|website=Sandpoint, ID: City Council Minutes|accessdate=23 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A webcam was installed to broadcast a view of the installation.&lt;ref name="sandpoint_webcam"&gt;{{cite web

==Criticism==

In 2014, Jonathan Levine, a professor of urban planning at the University of Michigan, expressed doubt regarding the political feasibility of the project on a national scale. He suggested, however, that a single town might be able to deploy the concept in a limited test case such as a parking lot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/infrastructure/a10730/we-could-build-a-solar-powered-roadway-but-will-we-16879565/ |title= We Could Build a Solar Powered Roadway. But Will We? |work= Popular Mechanics |date= June 11, 2014 |accessdate= February 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Journalist David Biello, writing in ''[[Scientific American]]'', noted the difficulties of the project in dealing with material limitations, particularly in its choice of making the surface of the panels from glass, which "must be tempered, self-cleaning, and capable of transmitting light to the PV below under trying conditions, among other characteristics—a type of glass that does not yet exist."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/hard-road-ahead-for-solar-freakin-roadways/| title=Hard Road Ahead for Solar Freakin' Roadways | work=Scientific American | date=July 10, 2014 | accessdate=October 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sebastian Anthony noted in [[ExtremeTech]] that the cost to replace all roads in the United States with Solar Roadways panels would come to approximately $56 trillion, based on Scott Brusaw's cost estimate of $10,000 for a {{convert|12|x|12|ft|adj=on}} section.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/183130-solar-roadways-passes-1-4-million-in-crowdfunding-just-short-of-the-56-trillion-required-but-not-bad-for-a-crazy-idea | first=Sebastian | last=Anthony | title=Solar Roadways passes $1.4 million in crowdfunding: Just short of the $56 trillion required, but not bad for a crazy idea | work=[[ExtremeTech]] | publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] | date=May 27, 2014 | accessdate=May 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The USDOT announcement of Phase IIB funding in December 2015 mentioned that because the solar cells were still manufactured by hand, they were "very costly to produce".&lt;ref name=trentacoste/&gt;  

[[Phil Mason]] made a similar argument about cost, adding his doubts about traction on a glass surface.&lt;ref name="Farrelly"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Farrelly |first1=Elizabeth |title=Highways of future, where solar panels change our world |url=https://search.proquest.com/news/docview/1536863134/fulltext/36F5D852A2834544PQ/3?accountid=10226 |accessdate=4 September 2018 |publisher=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=9 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rising to a height of 282 feet (86 meters),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/bu/?id=standardbuilding-cleveland-oh-usa  Standard Building]. [[Emporis]]. Retrieved on 2007-10-21.&lt;/ref&gt; the Standard Building was the second tallest building in Cleveland when it was completed in 1925. Three of its four sides are clad in cream-colored [[Glazed architectural terra-cotta|terra cotta]] with a recurring starburst [[motif (visual arts)|motif]]. The south face, which can be seen from [[Public Square, Cleveland|Public Square]], is unadorned and windowless.

==History==
During the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]], Standard Bank ran into financial difficulties and was sold by the BLE. It merged with two other Cleveland banks in 1930, forming Standard Trust Bank. This bank subsequently failed in 1931 and its assets were liquidated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

To the east, across Ontario Street, is the [[Marriott at Key Center]], built on the site of the landmark [[Engineers Building]], which the BLE sold in 1988 for development, moving into the Standard Building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''''The Apartment''''' is a 1960 American [[romantic comedy]] film, produced and directed by [[Billy Wilder]] from a screenplay he co-wrote with [[I. A. L. Diamond]], starring [[Jack Lemmon]] and [[Shirley MacLaine]]. The supporting cast are [[Fred MacMurray]], [[Ray Walston]], [[Jack Kruschen]], [[David Lewis (American actor)|David Lewis]], [[Willard Waterman]], [[David White (actor)|David White]], [[Hope Holiday]], and [[Edie Adams]].

The story follows C. C. “Bud” Baxter (Lemmon), an [[insurance]] clerk who in the hope of gaining promotion, permits four more senior men to occupy his [[Upper West Side]] apartment to conduct extramarital affairs. Bud is attracted to the [[elevator operator]], Fran Kubelik (MacLaine) who in turn is having an affair with Bud's immediate boss, Sheldrake (MacMurray).

''The Apartment'' was distributed by [[United Artists]] to favorable reviews and commercial success, despite controversy owing to its subject matter. At the [[33rd Academy Awards]], ''The Apartment'' was nominated for ten awards and won five, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], and [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Screenplay]]. Lemmon and MacLaine were Oscar-nominated and won [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe Awards]] for their performances in the film. It provided the basis for ''[[Promises, Promises (musical)|Promises, Promises]]'', a 1968 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[musical theatre|musical]] by [[Burt Bacharach]], [[Hal David]], and [[Neil Simon]].

In the years since its release, ''The Apartment'' has come to be regarded as one of the greatest films ever made, appearing in lists by the [[American Film Institute]] and ''[[Sight and Sound]]'' magazine, and being selected by the [[United States Library of Congress]] for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]].
==Plot==
C. C. "Bud" Baxter ([[Jack Lemmon]]) is a lonely office drudge at a national insurance corporation in a high-rise building in [[New York City]]. In order to climb the corporate ladder, Bud allows four company managers to take turns borrowing his [[Upper West Side]] apartment for their various extramarital liaisons, which are so noisy that his neighbors assume that Bud is a playboy bringing home a different woman every night.

The four managers (played by [[Ray Walston]], [[David Lewis (American actor)|David Lewis]], [[Willard Waterman]], and [[David White (actor)|David White]]) write glowing reports about Bud, who hopes for a promotion from the personnel director, Jeff D. Sheldrake ([[Fred MacMurray]]). Sheldrake does promote Bud, but he knows why they were so enthusiastic and demands exclusive privileges to borrow the apartment himself, starting that same night. As compensation for such short notice, he gives Baxter two tickets to ''[[The Music Man]]''.

After work, Bud catches Fran Kubelik ([[Shirley MacLaine]]), an [[elevator operator]] he has had his eye on, and asks her to go to the musical with him. She accepts, but first has to meet a former fling. He is Sheldrake, who convinces her that he is about to divorce his wife for her. They go to Bud's apartment as Bud waits forlornly outside the theater.

Later, at the company's raucous Christmas party, Sheldrake's secretary Miss Olsen ([[Edie Adams]]) drunkenly tells Fran that Fran is one of many female employees Sheldrake has seduced into affairs with the promise of divorcing his wife, including Miss Olsen herself. At Bud's apartment, Fran confronts Sheldrake, upset with herself for believing his lies. Sheldrake maintains that he genuinely loves her, but then leaves to return to his suburban family as usual.

Meanwhile, Bud accidentally learns about Sheldrake and Fran. Heartbroken, he lets himself be picked up by a woman ([[Hope Holiday]]) at a local bar. When they arrive at his apartment, he is shocked to find Fran in his bed, fully clothed and unconscious from an intentional overdose of his sleeping pills. He sends his pick-up away and enlists the help of his neighbor, Dr. Dreyfuss ([[Jack Kruschen]]), to revive Fran without notifying the authorities. To protect his job, Bud takes advantage of his playboy reputation, letting Dreyfuss believe Fran had attempted suicide after a lovers' quarrel with him.

Fran spends two days recuperating there, while Bud tries entertaining and distracting her from any suicidal thoughts. He tells her he once attempted suicide himself. They begin playing [[gin rummy]]. Bud dissuades her from phoning her family until her head is clear. During this period one of the executives arrives with a woman; Bud sends them away, but the man sees Fran. Then Fran's brother-in-law Karl Matuschka ([[Johnny Seven (actor)|Johnny Seven]]) comes to the office looking for her. Resenting Bud for denying them access to his apartment, the executives direct Karl there. When Bud again takes responsibility for Fran's actions, Karl punches him. Fran kisses Bud for not revealing her affair with Sheldrake and, sensing that she now cares for him, Bud smiles and says it "didn't hurt a bit."

Sheldrake rewards Bud with a further promotion, and fires Miss Olsen for what she told Fran. However, Miss Olsen retaliates by telling Sheldrake's wife, who promptly throws him out. Sheldrake moves into a room at his athletic club, but now figures that he can string Fran along while he enjoys his newfound bachelorhood.

But when Sheldrake asks Bud for the key to the apartment, Bud refuses, quitting the firm. That night at a [[New Year's Eve]] party, Sheldrake indignantly tells Fran about this. She finally realizes that Bud is the man who truly loves her. She runs to his apartment, but at the door, she hears a loud noise like a gunshot. Fearing he has attempted suicide again, Fran pounds on the door until Bud opens it, holding an overflowing bottle of champagne which was the source of the noise. Bud has been packing, planning to find a new job and a new home, but is surprised and delighted to see her. Fran insists on resuming their gin rummy game, telling Bud that she is now free as well. He declares his love for her, and she replies lovingly, "Shut up and deal."

==Production==
[[File:The apartment trailer jack lemmon.JPG|thumb|left|The apartment trailer jack lemmon|thumb|right|[[Jack Lemmon]] in a still from the film's trailer. ''The Apartment'' marked his second collaboration with [[Billy Wilder]] after ''[[Some Like It Hot]]''.]]

Immediately following the success of ''[[Some Like It Hot]]'', Billy Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond wished to make another film with Jack Lemmon. Wilder had originally planned to cast [[Paul Douglas (actor)|Paul Douglas]] as Jeff Sheldrake; however, after he died unexpectedly, Fred MacMurray was cast.

The initial concept for the film came from ''[[Brief Encounter]]'' by [[Noël Coward]], in which Celia Johnson has an affair with Trevor Howard in his friend's apartment. However, due to the [[Hays Production Code]], Wilder was unable to make a film about adultery in the 1940s. Wilder and Diamond also based the film partially on a Hollywood scandal in which high-powered agent [[Jennings Lang]] was shot by producer [[Walter Wanger]] for having an affair with Wanger's wife, actress [[Joan Bennett]]. During the affair, Lang used a low-level employee's apartment.&lt;ref&gt;Billy Wilder Interviews: [[Conversations with Filmmakers Series]]&lt;/ref&gt; Another element of the plot was based on the experience of one of Diamond's friends, who returned home after breaking up with his girlfriend to find that she had committed suicide in his bed.

Although Wilder generally required his actors to adhere exactly to the script, he allowed Jack Lemmon to improvise in two scenes: In one scene he squirts a bottle of nasal spray across the room, and in another, he sings while cooking spaghetti (which he strains through the grid of a tennis racket). In another scene, where Lemmon was supposed to mime being punched, he failed to move correctly, and was accidentally knocked down. Wilder chose to use the shot of the genuine punch in the film. Lemmon also caught a cold when one scene on a park bench was filmed in sub-zero weather.

Art director [[Alexandre Trauner]] used forced perspective to create the set of a large insurance company office. The set appeared to be a very long room full of desks and workers; however, successively smaller people and desks were placed to the back of the room, ending up with children. He designed the set of Baxter's apartment to appear smaller and shabbier than the spacious apartments that usually appeared in films of the day. He used items from thrift stores and even some of Wilder's own furniture for the set.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Chandler, Charlotte. ''Nobody's perfect: Billy Wilder : a personal biography''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The film's title theme, written by [[Charles Williams (composer)|Charles Williams]] and originally titled "Jealous Lover", was first heard in the 1949 film ''[[The Romantic Age]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080224234735/http://www.guildmusic.com/light/catalogue/5107.htm 5107 Charles Williams &amp; The Queen's Hall Light Orchestra at GuildMusic.com].

Although Jack Lemmon did not win the Oscar, [[Kevin Spacey]] dedicated his Oscar for ''[[American Beauty (1999 film)|American Beauty]]'' (1999) to Lemmon's performance. According to the behind-the-scenes feature on the ''American Beauty'' DVD, the film's director, [[Sam Mendes]], had watched ''The Apartment'' (among other classic American films) as inspiration in preparation for shooting his film.

Within a few years after ''The Apartment'''s release, the routine use of [[black-and-white]] film in Hollywood had ended. As of 2014, only two black-and-white movies have won the Academy Award for Best Picture after ''The Apartment'' did: ''[[Schindler's List]]'' (1993) &lt;!-- which includes a few seconds of color, so the wording "filmed entirely in B&amp;W" would be wrong --&gt; and ''[[The Artist (film)|The Artist]]'' (2011).

===Other awards and honors===
''The Apartment'' also won the [[BAFTA Award for Best Film from any Source]] and Lemmon and MacLaine both won a [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] and a [[Golden Globe]] each for their performances. In 1994, ''The Apartment'' was deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant" by the United States [[Library of Congress]] and selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]]. In 2002, a poll of film directors conducted by ''[[Sight and Sound]]'' magazine listed the film as the 14th greatest film of all time (tied with ''[[La Dolce Vita]]'').&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/topten/poll/directors-long.html BFI | Sight &amp; Sound | Top Ten Poll 2002 - The rest of the directors' list&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, ''Premiere'' voted this film as one of "The 50 Greatest Comedies Of All Time".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6359">The '''Tun Abdul Razak Research Centre''', originally known as the '''British Rubber Producers' Research Association''', carries out research into rubber and is funded by the Malaysian government.

==Early years: as the British Rubber Producers Research Association: 1938 to 1957==
The '''British Rubber Producers Research Association''' was formed as a scientific research organization in 1938 'to understand rubber and in pursuit of this aim to mount a programme of fundamental research', since at that time the technology was almost entirely empirical.&lt;ref name=FRSGee&gt;Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society (1999) vol 45 pp 185-194&lt;/ref&gt; It carried out fundamental work on [[rubber]], which included the more general [[polymer science]]  and the physics and mathematics of [[rheology]] and in addition contributed to early work on electronic computers.  

Prominent in the push for greater rubber research and the establishment of the association was [[Sir Eric Miller (rubber industrialist)|Sir Eric Miller]], who became chairman of the BRPRA.&lt;ref&gt;Obituary: Sir Eric Miller, Prominent figure in the rubber industry, The Times 12 July 1958&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1939 it obtained its first premises in [[Welwyn Garden City]].  It was largely funded by a levy on British-owned companies with plantations in [[British Malaya|Malaya]] and [[Ceylon]].&lt;ref name=FRSGee/&gt;

Its Director of Research from 1938 to 1947 was [[John Wilson (industrial chemist)|John Wilson]]. His:
&lt;blockquote&gt;unconventional qualities, combined as they were with super-abundant energy and remarkable visionary zeal, proved their value as he built up the BRPRA in a difficult period and made it a world-renowned research unit within a decade or so. He chose his staff on trusted recommendation or by intuition, and thus assembled a group which radically advanced the science of rubber [at the BRRA], sowed seeds that have produced substantial commercial fruits, and which was to become the source of distinguished alumni in high academic and industrial posts in this country, America and elsewhere ... [Wilson's] stimulating ebullience, his concern with work not red tape, and his abiding principle to support and fight to the limit for his staff outside the laboratories (however much he might assail them inside) engendered immense loyalty and a wonderful team spirit.&lt;ref name="times2"&gt;The Times, Obituaries 24 September 1976&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He resigned to become Director of the newly formed [[British Rayon Research Association]]. A number of staff followed him, including [[LRG Treloar]].&lt;ref name="rivlin"&gt;Autobiographical note, Collected papers of R.S. Rivlin, Volume 1 By Ronald S. Rivlin, G. I. Barenblatt, Daniel D. Joseph&lt;/ref&gt;

==After de-colonisation and Malaysian independence==

In 1957, Malaya achieved independence from British Rule and the name was changed to the '''Natural Rubber Producers' Research Association'''.  By the start of the 1970s, its research priorities included new methods of vulcanisation, injection moulding of rubber and developing anti-oxidants to protect against the deterioration of rubber.&lt;ref name="times1971"&gt;''Scientists seek to combine the best of old and new'', The Times, 25 January 1981, page 24&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period, the Association produced work on the engineering uses of rubber. This, by 1964, led to the development of rubber mounts for buildings to protect against vibrations. eventually this led to the use of mounts to protect against earthquakes.&lt;ref name=TARRC&gt;[http://www.tarrc.co.uk/pages/cohistory.htm www.tarrc.co.uk] TARRC Company History&lt;/ref&gt; In later years, this work was extended to smaller buildings.&lt;ref name=TARRC /&gt;

In 1973 it was changed to the '''Malaysian Rubber Producers' Research Association'''.  In 1974 the research base was relocated to Brickendonbury, [[Hertfordshire]]&lt;ref name=TARRC /&gt; in a mansion which had been used for the children's television series [[Catweazle]].&lt;ref name=Brick&gt;[http://www.tarrc.co.uk/pages/brickhistory.htm www.tarrc.co.uk] Brickendonbury History&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997 it was named the Tun Abdul Razak Laboratory by the Malaysian Prime Minister [[Tun Hussein Onn]].

Later research included work on blends of rubber and synthetics, such as nitrile, ethylene propylene rubber and Epoxidised natural rubber.

The centre also worked on the performance of tyre retread compounds, showing that natural rubber-rich tyres could perform nearly as well as synthetic tyres in durability, but were more fuel efficient as they had lower rolling resistance.&lt;ref name=TARRC /&gt;

The centre also developed an entirely new material,  thermoplastic epoxidized natural rubber. This has excellent oil-resistance and heat resistance.&lt;ref&gt;Thermoplastic epoxidized natural rubber - a new TPE for the 21st Century, Patel, J.; Tinker, A.J. 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tun Abdul Razak Research Centre==

In 1996, it became the Tun Abdul Razak Research Centre, a wholly owned company of the [[Malaysian Rubber Board]].&lt;ref name=FRSGee/&gt;  The centre has various research focusses including advanced materials, products, engineering and Biotechnology. Whilst the main purpose is to support the Malaysian rubber industry, the commercial division, Rubber Consultants offers a variety of testing and other services. These include compounding, physical testing, engineering design tyre testing and analytical services.

'''Vittorio Merloni''' (30 April 1933 – 18 June 2016) was an Italian entrepreneur and industrialist. He was the honorary chairman of [[Indesit]] (chaired by his son Andrea Merlon) and Fineldo (chaired by his daughter Antonella), the family holding company that controls Indesit and other group interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lastampa.it/2016/06/18/economia/morto-limprenditore-vittorio-merloni-SbwqGvUtasT6H8OH3ANoWN/pagina.html|title=È morto l’imprenditore Vittorio Merloni|work=lastampa.it}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.repubblica.it/economia/2016/06/18/news/e_morto_vittorio_merloni_storico_patron_di_indesit-142284008/?rssimage|title=E' morto Vittorio Merloni, storico patron di Indesit|date=18 June 2016|work=repubblica.it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Vittorio Merloni was the son of [[Aristide Merloni]]. He had a degree in economics and commerce from the [[University of Perugia]]. 

==Career==
His entrepreneurial career began in the 1960s in the family business. In 1975 he founded Merloni Elettrodomestici (renamed [[Indesit]] in 2005) and  he became the chairman, holding the position continuously until 29 April 2010, when he left the presidency to his son Andrea and he was appointed honorary chairman.

The company, listed on the Milan stock exchange since 1987, is one of Europe’s leading manufacturers and distributors of large home appliances (washing machines, dryers, washer-dryer, dishwashers, fridges, freezers, cookers, hoods, ovens and hobs).

He became president of [[Confindustria]] (the Italian Employers’ Federation), a post he held for four years. In 1984, the year he was made a “Cavaliere del lavoro”, he was elected president of Centromarca, an Italian brand association, a post he held until 1988.

In 2001 he began a four-year presidency of Assonime, an Italian association of public limited companies. In the same year he received an honorary doctorate in management engineering from the [[Politecnico di Milano]]. 
Since then he has received various awards and acknowledgements: in 2003, two years after Indesit took over [[Hotpoint]], a UK brand, he was made a [[Order of the British Empire|Commander of the Order of the British Empire]].

In 2004 he received the Leonardo Award for Internationalization and in 2005 he received the GEI (Gruppo Esponenti Italiani) award in [[New York City]], in recognition and appreciation of his work in trade and industry, a contribution which has done much to improve Italy’s image abroad.

==Personal life==
He was married to Franca Carloni and had four children: Maria Paola, Andrea, Antonella and Aristide.
He died on 18 June 2016 at the age of 83.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/obituaries/2016/06/27/vittorio-merloni-business-tycoon---obituary/ Vittorio Merloni, business tycoon – obituary]&lt;/ref&gt;
