'''‘Abd Manāf al-Mughirah ibn Quṣai''' ({{lang-ar|عبد مناف المغيرة بن قصي}}) was a [[Quraysh (tribe)|Quraish]]i and great-great-grandfather of [[Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]]. His father was [[Qusai ibn Kilab|Quṣai ibn Kilāb]].

==Biography==
Abd Manaf was already honoured{{clarifyme|date=August 2018}} in his father's lifetime however Qusai preferred his first-born [[Abd-al-Dar ibn Qusai|'Abd ad-Dar]] and invested him with all his rights, powers, and transferred the ownership of the House of Assembly shortly before his death.&lt;ref name="Lings1"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lings|first=Martin|title=Muhammad: His Life Based on the Earliest Sources|year=1983|publisher=[[George Allen &amp; Unwin]]|pages=6–7|isbn=0946621330}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Quṣayy's death, Abd Manaf contested this inheritance, He was supported by their nephew Asad, their uncle [[Zuhrah ibn Kilab]], their father's uncle [[Taym ibn Murrah]] (of [[Banu Taym]]), and al-Harith ibn Fihr, while 'Abd ad-Dar was supported by their cousins Makhzum, Sahm, Jumah, their uncle Adi and their families. The effects of this conflict continued among their descendants, especially under Abd Manaf's son [[Hashim ibn 'Abd Manaf|Hashim]] and affected the internal history of [[Mecca]] right up to Muhammad's time.&lt;ref name="Armstrong"&gt;{{cite book |last=Armstrong |first=Karen |title=Muhammad: A Biography of the Prophet |year=2001 |publisher=Phoenix |page=66 |isbn=0946621330}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Abdu Manaf married several wives of influential tribes, including [[Atikah bint Murrah|'Ātikah bint Murrah ibn Hilāl ibn Fālij ibn Dhakwān]] of Bani Qays Aylan, Hilal of the [[Hawazin|Banu Hawāzin]], Raytah of [[Ta'if]], and Waqida bint Amr.

Raytah had only the son Abd or Abdu'l Amr, who died childless; Waqida also had one son, [[Nawfal ibn Abd Manaf|Nawfal]]. The Hawazin heiress Atikah, however, bore him three sons and eight daughters. The boys were twin sons called [[Hashim ibn 'Abd Manaf|Amr]] (more commonly known as Hashim ibn 'Abd Manaf), [[Abd Shams ibn Abd Manaf|Abd Shams]], [[Muttalib ibn Abd Manaf|Muttalib]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.genealogie.free.fr/Les_Dynasties/Les_Dynasties_musulmanes/Dynastie_de_Mahomet.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081113170834/http://web.genealogie.free.fr/Les_dynasties/Les_dynasties_musulmanes/Dynastie_de_Mahomet.htm |archivedate=2008-11-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Muttalib was younger than Hashim and became his successor. The daughters were Tumadir/Tamadur, Qilaba, Hayya, Raytah/Rita, Umm Akhtham, Hala, Barra and Umm Sufyan.&lt;ref name="ruqaiyyah4"&gt;{{cite web |last=Maqsood |first=Ruqaiyyah Waris |url=http://www.ruqaiyyah.karoo.net/articles/prophfamily4.htm |title=The Prophet’s Family Line No. 4 – Amr (Hashim), the Founder of the Hashimites |publisher=Ruqaiyyah Waris Maqsood Dawah |date= |accessdate=3 August 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080530213146/http://www.ruqaiyyah.karoo.net/articles/prophfamily4.htm |archive-date=2008-05-30 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anncharlott Eschmann''' (September 24, 1941, [[Munich]] &amp;ndash; April 6, 1977, [[New Delhi]]) was a scholar of religion.

She was born in [[Munich]], the first daughter of Professor Ernst Wilhelm Eschmann, a renowned Professor of Philosophy, and Mrs. Charlott Eschmann, a retired psychotherapist. She grew up in Roman Catholic [[Ticino]] (Switzerland), where her parents' house had become a constant meeting place of members of the Eranos Society.  Eschmann studied Protestant theology, [[comparative religion]] and [[Indology]] in [[Marburg]] and [[Heidelberg]]. In 1969, she submitted her PhD thesis on the topic of "The idea of history in Aztec religion".

As a member of the Orissa Research Projekt, Eschmann went to [[India]] in autumn 1970. There, she encountered, for the first time, Vishwanath Baba in Joranda.  Eschmann's academic research focussed on "sectarian" movements such as the Samaritans, the oppressed Jewish offspring, and Mahima dharma and the modern reform movement in [[Orissa, India|Orissa]]. She explored the phenomenon which Srinivas labelled as [[Sanskritization]], i.e. the continuing incorporation of "prehistoric" and popular beliefs into "high" traditions. Her work on [[Jagannath]] and [[Narasimha]] exemplified the relation of tribal deities and the Jagannath cult of [[Puri]]. From 1975, Eschmann was the head of the [[New Delhi]] branch of Heidelberg's South Asia Institute.  Anncharlott Eschmann died on April 6, 1977, in New Delhi.

With Professor [[David P.

His ground-breaking scholarship with Professor Fidler includes "The Globalization of Baseball: Major League Baseball and the Mistreatment of  Latin American Baseball Talent," published in the Indiana Journal of Global Legal Studies (1999);&lt;ref&gt;[http://ijgls.indiana.edu/subscriptions/Vol6_Issue2.shtml IJGLS: Subscriptions &amp; Volume 1 Issue 1 Fall 1993&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060918130740/http://ijgls.indiana.edu/subscriptions/Vol6_Issue2.shtml |date=September 18, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[“Stealing Lives: the Globalization of Baseball and the Tragic Story of Alexis Quiroz”]];&lt;ref&gt;https://www.iupress.Indiana.edu/catalog/product_info.php?isbn= {{ISBN|0-253-34191-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="newsinfo.iu.edu"&gt;[http://newsinfo.iu.edu/news/page/normal/745.html New book exposes the dark side of Major League Baseball's recruitment practices in Latin America: IU News Room: Indiana University&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and “Exploitation and Reform: Major League Baseball’s Recruitment of Latin American Baseball Talent” ([[North American Congress on Latin America]] (NACLA), Volume XXXVII No. 5, March-April 2004).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060225131758/http://archive.nacla.org/Summaries/V37I5P16-1.htm NACLA Digital Archive - Baseball's Exploitation of Latin Talent&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Marcano is also the co-author of several letters and reports sent to [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) authorities and staff highlighting issues related to the globalization of baseball.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}  Marcano served as the International Legal Advisor to the Venezuelan Baseball Players Association,&lt;ref name="newsinfo.iu.edu"/&gt; advising on issues affecting professional baseball in Venezuela. 

Marcano and Fidler argue that [[Major League Baseball]] deserves criticism from [[non-governmental organization]]s for [[human right]]s and labor standards, suggesting that the solution to MLB "unfair labor practices in the [[Dominican Republic]] is the unionization of Dominican players".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.northwestern.edu/journals/jihr/v4/n2/6/ Dragging Their Devotion: The Role of International Law in Major League Baseball's Dominican Affairs&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Marcano earned his law degree from [[Universidad Católica Andrés Bello]] in [[Caracas]], Venezuela in 1992, received an LL.M. degree from [[Indiana University]] School of Law in 1998, and a Master of Science (M.S.) in Sport Management from the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]] in 2005.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

He has two daughters, Isabella, and Lucia.

"'''Bobby Brown (Goes Down)'''" ([[Image:sound-icon.png|20px]] [[Media:Zappa BobbyBrown.ogg|(song sample, 600Kb)]]) is a song by [[Frank Zappa]] released on his album ''[[Sheik Yerbouti]]'' in 1979. One of his best known songs, it was hugely successful in [[Europe]].

The song describes a wealthy, [[misogynistic]] student named Bobby Brown, "the cutest boy in town," whose life is the archetypical [[American Dream]] until a traumatic sexual encounter with "Freddie," a [[lesbian]] involved in the [[women's liberation movement]], leaves him questioning his sexuality. Bobby transforms into a [[leisure suit]]-wearing [[closeted]] [[homosexuality|homosexual]] working in radio promotions; by the end of the song, he and "a friend" (later implied to be his boss, as he will "[[Casting couch|do anything to get ahead]]," which also has a double meaning, i.e. [[oral sex|getting a head]]) have become self-described "sexual spastic(s)" involved in [[urolagnia|golden showers]] and [[sadomasochism|S&amp;M]], for which he thanks his "friend," Freddie. This song was more successful in Europe than America (the song's pervasive sexual content made it unfit for broadcast on U.S. radio) and this is why it is only featured on the vinyl and European CD version of Zappa's best of compilation, ''[[Strictly Commercial]]''.

Sisters Offering Support is a Hawaii-based NGO. PIP is a "peer-based alternative sentencing program for adult and juvenile prostitution offenders and nonoffenders". PIP Training Manual, 1.&lt;/ref&gt; is an American term for a [[prostitution|prostitute]] who sits atop the [[hierarchy]] of prostitutes working for a particular [[pimp]]. A bottom girl is usually the prostitute who has been with the pimp the longest and consistently makes the most money.&lt;ref name="PIP Training Manual, 18"&gt;PIP Training Manual, 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Being the bottom girl gives the prostitute status and power over the other women working for her pimp;&lt;ref name="PIP Training Manual, 18" /&gt; however, the bottom girl also bears many responsibilities. In ''U.S. v. Pipkins'',&lt;ref&gt;378 F.3d 1281 (11th Cir. 2004). http://openjurist.org/378/f3d/1281/united-states-v-pipkins&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Eleventh Circuit]] described the bottom girl's duties as "work[ing] the track in [her pimp's] stead, running interference for and collecting money from the pimp's other prostitutes, [and] look[ing] after the pimp's affairs if the pimp was out of town, incarcerated, or otherwise unavailable".&lt;ref&gt;''Pipkin'', 1285.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the Training Manual of the Hawaiian Prostitution Intervention Program explains that the bottom girl's obligations may include handling finances, and training and recruiting other prostitutes.&lt;ref name="PIP Training Manual, 18" /&gt;

'''Dawnine Sample Dyer''' (born July 3, 1950) is an American [[winemaker]] and entrepreneur who pioneered the use of champagne making methods in [[California|California’s]] fledgling sparkling wine industry in the 1970s.

==Biography==
Dyer, a California native with a degree in biology from the [[University of California at Santa Cruz]], began her wine career in 1974, at the [[Robert Mondavi Winery]] located in [[Oakville, California|Oakville]], the heart of the [[Napa Valley]] grape-growing region.

In 1976, Dyer was recruited for the Napa Valley start-up [[Domaine Chandon California|Domaine Chandon]],&lt;ref&gt;Howard G. Goldberg (February 18, 1987). [https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/18/garden/wine-talk-596087.html Wine Talk] ''[[The New York Times]]''. Accessed 2007-12-05.&lt;/ref&gt; the first French-owned California sparkling wine venture in the United States. Charged with monitoring quality control, she was paired with a French winemaking team from Domaine Chandon’s parent company, [[Moet &amp; Chandon]], which included veteran [[enologist]] and winemaker, Edmond Maudiere. Cast in the role of Maudiere’s protégé, Dyer oversaw a series of winemaking trials aimed at creating a naturally fermented sparkling wine based on both Old and New world styles and techniques, including [[France]]’s [[Sparkling wine production|Methode Champenoise]]. At the time, only a half dozen sparkling wine producers existed in the United States, among them Korbel, Kornell and [[Schramsberg]]. The effort resulted in California’s first sparkling wine made from [[Pinot Meunier]], a black grape typically used in Champagne for additional depth and maturity. A separate effort led by Dyer resulted in a still wine also made from the Pinot Meunier varietal.&lt;ref&gt;Sexton, Jean Deitz. Wines &amp; Vine, December 1995. Retrieved October 2007. http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3488/is_n12_v76/ai_17843513.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the course of her 24-year tenure at Domaine Chandon, Dyer rose up through the ranks of the [[Yountville]], Calif.-based winery, ultimately becoming vice president and principal winemaker. In this capacity, she oversaw all winemaking at the 400,000-case winery and also worked with its parent company in France. In 1986, Dyer helped found Domaine Chandon’s sister winery in [[Australia]]’s [[Yarra Valley]], and also oversaw export products for the company’s winery facility in [[Argentina]]. It was during this period that Dyer joined forces with other winemakers and grape growers in calling for the creation of Geographic Indications and [[American Viticultural Area|Appellations of Origin]] for America’s wine growing regions, including the [[Napa Valley AVA]].

While at Domaine Chandon, Dyer and husband Bill, a respected winemaker in his own right, planted a {{convert|2.5|acre|m2|sing=on}} [[cabernet sauvignon]] vineyard in the [[Diamond Mountain District AVA]] of the Napa Valley, and began making earthy Bordeaux-style wines from the hillside estate. In 2000, she left Domaine Chandon to devote more time to Dyer Vineyard, which produces 400 cases of wine per year. The estate-grown cabernet is known for its minerality and deep berry flavors, characteristics associated with wines produced in the higher elevation Diamond Mountain AVA.  In the 2004 book by [[Matt Kramer (wine)|Matt Kramer]], ''New California Wine: Understanding the Napa Valley, Sonoma, Central Coast and Beyond'', the ''[[Wine Spectator]]'' columnist credited the Dyers with creating “great cabernets” produced in “minute” but “superb quality.”&lt;ref&gt;Kramer, Matt. ''Matt Kramer’s New California Wine: Making Sense of the Napa Valley, Sonoma, Central Coast and Beyond''.  (Philadelphia and London: Running Press, 2004), 126. {{ISBN|0-7624-1964-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dawnine and Bill Dyer have been the winemakers for Sodaro Estate Winery in Napa, CA since its inception. 

In 2005, the Dyers partnered with former [[America Online]] Inc. Chairman and Chief Executive [[Barry Schuler]] and his wife, Tracy Strong Schuler to create a cabernet sauvignon blend, branded Meteor Vineyard, made from grapes grown on the Schuler’s {{convert|22|acre|m2|sing=on}} vineyard in the Napa Valley’s [[Coombsville]] region. The hilltop vineyard, which previously sold its grapes to acclaimed Napa Valley labels including Dyer, Lail, Favia, Arietta, Etude and Vineyard 29, bottled its first vintage under the Meteor label in 2005, with a release date of February 2008. In the September 2007 issue of Decanter, U.K. wine authority Steven Spurrier commended the Meteor team, including Dyer, for its 2005 vintage after sampling the wine at a recent barrel auction. In an article, he described the blend as having "smooth, spicy fruit” and "plush tannins.”&lt;ref&gt;Spurrier, Steven, ''Decanter''. (September 2007). "Joining the Top Table" pp.13.&lt;/ref&gt;  Spurrier organized the Paris Wine Tasting of 1976 in which French and California wines were tasted side-by-side in the first serious competition between the two countries.&lt;ref&gt;  Taber, George. Judgment of Paris: California Vs. France and the Historic 1976 Paris Tasting.  (New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 2006), {{ISBN|1-4165-4789-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During her career, Dyer has served as President of the [[Napa Valley Vintners Association]] (NVV), president of Napa Valley Wine Technical Group and was a member of the founding board of Women for WineSense, a national 12-chapter association founded in 1990. Through her work with the NVV, she has become a recognized voice for the importance of Geographic Indications and Appellations of Origin to the [[Napa Valley]]&lt;ref&gt;David Stoneberg (May 24, 2007). [http://www.napavalleyregister.com/articles/2007/05/24/news/local/doc46551cf206ed3124604365.txt Napa now on EU map]. ''NapaValleyRegister''. Accessed 2007-12-07.&lt;/ref&gt; and has been invited to speak on the issue in Geneva, Switzerland, Beijing, China, Lima, Peru, and Bordeaux, France. She lectures for the annual Wine Industry Executive program at the University of California at Davis Graduate School of Business and also sits on the board of directors for [[Frog's Leap Winery]]. She is also a judge for several professional wine competitions, including the U.S.-based National Women’s Wine Competition.

The Dyers have been married since 1981. The couple lives full-time on their [[Diamond Mountain District AVA|Diamond Mountain]] estate. Their wine properties are held by the limited liability company, Dyer Straits Wine Co.

She was appointed in May 2002 by [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]], who made her the first [[Asian American]] woman to serve as a United States Attorney. In 2009, Los Angeles Mayor [[Antonio Villaraigosa]] nominated Yang to a vacancy on the [[Los Angeles Police Commission]]. In 2016, she was listed as the potential choice for SEC Chief in Donald Trump's cabinet.

== Education ==
In 1981, Yang received a bachelor of arts degree from [[Pitzer College]] and in 1985, a [[Juris Doctor]] from [[Boston College Law School]] &lt;ref name="gibsondunn_yang"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gibsondunn.com/lawyers/dwongyang |title=Biography of Debra Wong Yang |work=[[Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher|Gibson Dunn]] |accessdate=June 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=August 2017}}
Yang served as President of the [[Chinese American Museum]] in Los Angeles, where she played an instrumental role in the creation of this new landmark for [[Southern California]]. Yang was a founding member and officer of the first Asian American Bar Association in [[Chicago]], and she has been an officer and board member of the Southern California Chinese Lawyer Association.

In 2002, the [[Los Angeles City Council]] honored her for her long-standing commitment to [[victims' rights]].

Senator [[Dianne Feinstein]] (D-CA) has raised questions about Yang's departure in light of the subsequent firing of seven US Attorneys. Yang's office had opened an investigation into the relationship between Rep. [[Jerry Lewis (California politician)|Jerry Lewis]] (R-CA) and a lobbyist five months before she left to join the law firm that represented Rep. Lewis.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Talking Points Memo]]'':

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4252">'''Donald J. Kessler''' (born 1940) is an American [[astrophysicist]] and former [[NASA]] scientist known for his studies regarding [[space debris]].&lt;ref name="MPC-Donaldkessler" /&gt;

== Career ==

Kessler worked at the [[Johnson Space Center]] in [[Houston, Texas]], as part of NASA's Environmental Effects Project Office.&lt;ref name="wired"&gt;{{citation |last=Schwartz |first=Evan I. |title=Waste MGMT |journal=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |volume=18 |issue=6 |pages=172–180 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  While there, he developed what is now known as the [[Kessler syndrome]], which posits that collisions between space debris become increasingly likely as the density of space debris increases in orbit around the earth, and a cascade effect results as each collision in turn creates more debris that can cause further collisions.  Kessler first published his ideas in 1978, in an academic paper titled "Collision Frequency of Artificial Satellites: The Creation of a Debris Belt."&lt;ref name="kessler"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Donald J. Kessler and Burton G. Cour-Palais | title=Collision Frequency of Artificial Satellites: The Creation of a Debris Belt | journal=Journal of Geophysical Research | year=1978 | volume=83 | pages=2637–2646 | doi=10.1029/JA083iA06p02637|bibcode = 1978JGR....83.2637K }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The paper established Kessler's reputation, and NASA subsequently made him the head of the newly created Orbital Debris Program Office to study the issue and establish guidelines to slow the accumulation of space debris.&lt;ref name="wired" /&gt;

Kessler retired from NASA in 1996, and has maintained a website with his publications and contact information.  He currently lives in [[Asheville, North Carolina]].&lt;ref name="wired" /&gt;  He continues to be active in the field of orbital debris. In 2009, he gave an address to the first International Conference on Orbital Debris Removal in [[Arlington, Virginia]], co-sponsored by NASA and [[DARPA]].&lt;ref name="wired" /&gt;  In 2011, he was a key adviser in the making of the educational IMAX film ''Space Junk 3D'' and also served as chairman of a [[United States National Research Council]] committee to assess NASA's orbital debris programs.  In 2013, he gave a special lecture in Tokyo to the Second International Symposium on Sustainable Space Development and Utilization for Humankind, sponsored by the Japan Space Forum, and in 2017 gave the keynote address at the 7th European Conference on Space Debris.&lt;ref&gt;[https://livestream.com/ESA/spacedebris2017/videos/154434859 Video of address]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards and honors ==
* Kessler has received numerous awards for his pioneering work, the most recent being the 2010 [[Dirk Brouwer Award (American Astronautical Society)|Dirk Brower Award]] for his half-century career in astrodynamics.
* The central [[main-belt]] asteroid [[11267 Donaldkessler]], discovered by American astronomer [[Schelte Bus]] at the Californian [[Palomar Observatory]] in 1981, was named in his honor on 13 April 2017 ({{small|[[Minor Planet Circulars|M.P.C.]] {{MoMP|11267|103977}}}}).&lt;ref name="MPC-Donaldkessler" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MPC-Circulars-Archive" /&gt;

'''Emma ʻAʻima Aʻii Nāwahī''' (September 28, 1854 – December 28, 1935) was a [[Native Hawaiian]] political activist, community leader and newspaper publisher. She and her husband [[Joseph Nāwahī]] were leaders in the  [[Opposition to the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii|opposition]] to the [[overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii]] and they co-founded ''Ke Aloha Aina'', a [[Hawaiian language]] newspaper, which served as an important voice in the resistance to the annexation of Hawaii to the United States.{{sfn|Silva|1998|page=57}}{{sfn|Silva|2004|page=139}}{{sfn|Kauanui|Kauanui|2008|page=60}} After annexation, she helped established the [[Democratic Party of Hawaii]] and became a supporter of the [[Women's suffrage in the United States|women's suffrage]] movement.

==Early life ==
Born on September 28, 1854, at Kūkūau, a rural part of [[Hilo, Hawaii|Hilo]] on the island of [[Hawaii (island)|Hawaii]], she was regarded as a ''[[hapa|hapa-pākē]]'', of half-[[Native Hawaiian]] and half-[[Chinese immigration to Hawaii|Chinese]] descent.{{sfn|Proto|2009|pages=44–45}}{{sfn|Bennion|1990|page=149}}{{sfn|Kuʻualoha|2002|pages=254–255}} Her mother Kahaoleʻauʻa was the daughter of a minor Hilo chief, while her father Tong Yee was a Chinese immigrant from [[Zhongshan|Xiangshan County]], [[Guangdong]].

Following the [[Overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii|overthrow of the monarchy]], on January{{nbsp}}17, 1893, her husband Joseph Nāwahī became the president of Hui Aloha ʻĀina o{{nbsp}}Na Kane (Hawaiian Patriotic League for Men), a patriotic group founded shortly after the overthrow to oppose annexation and support the deposed queen.

In 1893, Emma and the other members of the executive committee of Hui Aloha ʻĀina o{{nbsp}}Na Wahine submitted a petition to the United States Commissioner [[James Henderson Blount]] sent by President [[Grover Cleveland]] to investigate the overthrow. The petitions addressed to the government of the United States read:

{{quote|We, the women of the Hawaiian Islands, for our families and the happiness of our homes, desire peace and political quiet, and we pray that man’s greed for power and spoils shall not be allowed to disturb the otherwise happy life of these islands, and that the revolutionary agitations and disturbances inaugurated here since 1887, by a few foreigners may be forever suppressed.&lt;br /&gt;
To that effect we believe that, in the light of recent events, the peace, welfare, and honor of both America and Hawaii will be better served, for the present, if the Government of the great American Republic does not countenance the illegal conduct and interference of its representatives here and the rash wish of a minority of foreigners for annexation.&lt;br /&gt;
Therefore, we respectfully but earnestly pray that Hawaii may be granted the preservation of its independent autonomy and the restoration of its legitimate native monarchy under our Queen Liliuokalani, in whom we have full confidence.&lt;br /&gt;
And we hope that the distinguished citizen, who so wisely presides over the United States, may kindly receive this our petition, for which we shall evermore pray for God's blessing on him and his Government.{{sfn|Blount|1895|pages=491–492}}}}

In December 1894, a search warrant was served on the Nāwahīs' Kapālama home looking for "sundry arms and ammunition." Although nothing was found, Joseph Nāwahī was arrested for treason and bail was set at 10,000 dollars. He spent nearly three months in jail until being bailed out.{{sfn|Proto|2009|page=101}} 
In May 1895, Nāwahī and Emma founded ''Ke Aloha Aina'', a weekly anti-annexationist newspaper written in the [[Hawaiian language]] to promote Hawaiian independence and opposition to American annexation.{{sfn|Silva|1998|page=57}}{{sfn|Silva|2004|page=139}}{{sfn|Kauanui|Kauanui|2008|page=60}}

Following his release, Nāwahī's health deteriorated from the [[tuberculosis]] he had contracted during his imprisonment. On the recommendation of his doctor to seek a change of climate, they left Hawaii for a trip to San Francisco, California.{{sfn|Silva|1998|pages=57–58}} They left Honolulu aboard the steamer ''Alameda'' on August 20, 1896, along with the families of [[Edward C.

These [[Kūʻē Petitions]] were submitted by a delegation of Native Hawaiians and was used as evidence of the strong resistance of the Hawaiian community to annexation, and the treaty was defeated in the Senate. After the failure of the treaty, Hawaii was instead annexed by the [[Newlands Resolution]], issued in July 1898, shortly after the outbreak of the [[Spanish–American War]].{{sfn|Haley|2014|pages=317–336}}&lt;ref name="SilvaPetition" /&gt;{{sfn|Mehmed|1998|pages=142–143}}

The '''Facebook real-name policy controversy''' refers to the controversy over [[Social networking service|social networking]] site [[Facebook]]{{'}}s "[[real-name system]]" dictating how people register their accounts and configure their [[user profile]]s.  The controversy stems from a policy that those who have been adversely affected describe as penalizing users who are in fact using their real names which Facebook has nevertheless deemed to be "fake", while simultaneously allowing anyone to create fake yet plausible-sounding names, as well as obviously implausible-sounding names comprising word combinations that Facebook's software fails to recognize as unlikely to be real because their alleged nonstandard spelling or confusion with fictional characters. Facebook furthermore prohibits users from accurately representing names which according to the site have "too many words", and prohibits initializing first names, preventing users who do so in real life from formatting their own names as they see fit.

== Background ==
The social networking website [[Facebook]] has maintained the [[real-name system]] policy for user profiles.  According to Facebook, the real-name policy stems from the position "that way, you always know who you're connecting with. This helps keep our community safe."&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/09/16/living/facebook-name-policy/ |title=Facebook 'real name' policy stirs questions around identity |last=Grinberg |first=Emanuella |date=September 18, 2014 |publisher=[[CNN]] |accessdate=October 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Facebook"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/help/112146705538576|title=What names are allowed on Facebook?|last=|first=|date=|publisher=[[Facebook]] |accessdate=October 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise per this policy, a "real name" is defined by "your real name as it would be listed on your credit card, driver's license or student ID."&lt;ref name="Business Insider"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-apologizes-for-real-name-policy-2014-10|title=Facebook Apologizes For 'Real Name' Policy That Forced Drag Queens To Change Their Profiles|last=Levy|first=Karyne|date=October 1, 2014|work=[[Business Insider]] |accessdate=October 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2012, Facebook estimated that more than 83&amp;nbsp;million Facebook accounts are fake accounts.&lt;ref name="usa"&gt;{{cite news |title=Facebook: About 83 million accounts are fake |work=[[USA Today]] |url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/story/2012-08-03/cnbc-facebook-fake-accounts/56759964/1 |accessdate=August 4, 2012 |date=August 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this revelation, the share price of Facebook dropped below $20.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Facebook share price slumps below $20 amid fake account flap |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/aug/02/facebook-share-price-slumps-20-dollars |accessdate=August 4, 2012 |location=London |first=Dominic |last=Rushe |date=August 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facebook has asserted that "authentic identity is important to the Facebook experience, and our goal is that every account on Facebook should represent a real person."&lt;ref name="usa" /&gt;

==Affected users==

===Ethnic groups===

====Native Americans====
[[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] have been repeatedly targeted due to Facebook's policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Holpuck|first1=Amanda|title=Facebook still suspending Native Americans over 'real name' policy|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/feb/16/facebook-real-name-policy-suspends-native-americans|accessdate=6 March 2015|publisher=Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Robin Kills The Enemy, a resident of the [[Sioux]] Rosebud reservation in South Dakota, found that when she tried to register her surname in its normal format, the site would not let her use them, so she resorted to combining the three words, spelling them as one word.  After having been a member for some time, she eventually contacted the site in an attempt to have her surname spelled as it actually is in real life.  However, after reaching out to Facebook, they instead deactivated her account without explanation.  When she was finally able to make contact with an actual employee, they wrote back telling her "Fake names are a violation of our Terms of Use. Facebook requires users to provide their full first and last names".  She eventually managed to have her account reinstated; however, users with the surname Kills The Enemy are, as of 2015, still required by Facebook to spell their surname without spaces as a single word.&lt;ref name=ictmn&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ramos|first1=Nestor|title=Facebook no friend to American Indian names |url=http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2009/02/16/facebook-no-friend-american-indian-names-82895|website=Indian Country Today media network}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Shane Creepingbear, an Oklahoman member of the [[Kiowa]] tribe, reported that he had been "kicked off" of Facebook on [[Columbus Day]] for having a supposedly fake name.&lt;ref name=metroCreepingbear&gt;{{cite web|last1=McAteer|first1=Ollie|title=Native Americans booted off Facebook for having ‘fake’ names like Creepingbear|url=http://metro.co.uk/2015/02/11/native-americans-booted-off-facebook-for-having-fake-names-like-creepingbear-5057955/|website=Metro}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Lance Brown Eyes, an [[Oglala Lakota|Oglala]], found that his account had been suspended; when he was able to send in documentation to Facebook proving his identity, Facebook reinstated his account, but changed his name to "Lance Brown".&lt;ref name=IBT&gt;{{cite web|last1=Russon|first1=Mary-Ann|title=Facebook fail: Native Americans keep being accused of using fake names|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/facebook-fail-native-americans-keep-being-accused-using-fake-names-1487378|website=International Business Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Dana Lone Hill, a member of the [[Lakota people|Lakota]] tribe who had been a registered Facebook user for several years, discovered one day that she had been locked out of her account.  A message from Facebook said "it looks like the name on your Facebook account may not be your authentic name".  After a week, during which she had to send in her personal documentation to Facebook, her account access was restored.  She has since threatened a class-action lawsuit on behalf of Native Americans against Facebook due to how it exercises its name policies.

A number of Native Americans have objected to Facebook's inquiries into their names, and to Facebook's request that they provide proof of identification or other documentation in order to use the service.&lt;ref name="The Washington Post"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Phillip| first1=Abby| title=Online ‘authenticity’ and how Facebook's ‘real name’ policy hurts Native Americans | date=October 2, 2014|accessdate=October 5, 2015|url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/02/10/online-authenticity-and-how-facebooks-real-name-policy-hurts-native-americans/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Native American activists claimed to be planning to file a [[class action lawsuit]] against Facebook regarding the 'real name' policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Holpuck|first1=Amanda|title=Native American activist to sue Facebook over site's 'real name' policy|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/feb/19/native-american-activist-facebook-lawsuit-real-name|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|work=The Guardian|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Japanese====
In 2008, a woman in Japan named Hiroko Yoda had her Facebook account suspended over her [[Yoda_(disambiguation)|surname]], which is common in Japan, being confused with a [[Star Wars]] character of the [[Yoda|same name]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/2632170/Woman-called-Yoda-blocked-from-Facebook.html|title=Woman called Yoda blocked from Facebook|first=Matthew|last=Moore|date=27 August 2008|publisher=|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Irish====
The [[Dublin]] branch of the [[Irish language]] rights group, Misneach, started a [[Change.org]] [[online petition]] to demand the right to use Irish names on Facebook and protested outside Facebook's European headquarters in Dublin on October 7, 2015.&lt;ref name="Irish Times"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/protest-at-dublin-facebook-hq-over-real-name-policy-1.2345414 |title=Protest at Dublin Facebook HQ over ‘real-name’ policy |last=Tracer |first=Dan |date=September 9, 2015 |work=[[Irish Times]] |accessdate=September 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scottish Gaelic====
In 2015, one Gaelic-speaking retired policeman won the right to use his Gaelic name on Facebook, even though it was not his legal name. Some Scottish Gaelic surnames, such as NicIllAnndrais, contain more than two capital letters and are still disallowed by Facebook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Man wins Facebook battle over ‘fake’ Gaelic name|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/odd/man-wins-facebook-battle-over-fake-gaelic-name-1-3702815|date=26 February 2015|website=www.scotsman.com|accessdate=31 October 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Chamoru====
In the Spanish-influenced indigenous [[Chamoru]] culture of the [[Marianas]], the standard naming convention has historically been for a person to use their mother's [[maiden name]] as their middle name. (Chamoru culture, having been colonized by Spain, went through a period where indigenous names and naming conventions were forcibly eradicated and replaced by what the conquering Spanish deemed acceptable.) Furthermore, using one's full name rather than simply the first and last is commonplace, if only for disambiguation purposes due to a relatively small pool of surnames. Therefore, middle names such as De Leon Guerrero and De La Cruz are frequently encountered. However, attempting to register such names as one's middle name results in a message telling users that "Names can't have too many words." Therefore, many Chamoru users are forced to either run all of the words together as if they were one single word, or to initialize each word to a common acronym such as DLG or DLC.

In cases where the acronym is employed, Facebook automatically changes to lower-case all letters except the first. (Use of periods, e.g. D.L.G., will result in a message telling users that "Profile names can't have too many periods.") Therefore, someone commonly known in real life by a name such as Mary De Leon Guerrero Mafnas would have to resort to using what on Facebook would end up being "Mary Dlg Mafnas". The message is not accompanied by an option to challenge/appeal the restriction or to send Facebook documentation that the format is how one normally formats their name in real life.

====Vietnamese====
In January 2015, a 23-year-old Australian bank employee claiming to be named Phuc Dat Bich posted a photo of his passport identification page to Facebook, protesting that the company had unfairly shut down his account for being "false and misleading".&lt;ref name=BBCBich&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-34897404|title=Phuc Dat Bich: Australian with 'misleading' name thanks supporters|date=November 23, 2015|accessdate=November 23, 2015|work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Is it because I'm Asian? Is it?" he asked. The BBC reported that in Vietnamese the name is pronounced similarly to "Phoo Da Bi" (IPA: [[Help:IPA/Vietnamese|{{ipa|/fukp˦˥ ɗat˩ ɓic˦˥/}}]]).&lt;ref name=BBCBich/&gt; After his reinstatement, Bich posted a thank you note to supportive Facebook fans, stating he was "glad and honoured to be able to make people happy by simply making them laugh at something that appears outrageous and ridiculous".&lt;ref name=BBCBich/&gt; Subsequently "Phuc Dat" published a further message admitting it was a hoax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Phuc Dat Bich admits hoax in Facebook name battle|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-34918491|accessdate=25 November 2015|publisher=BBC|date=25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tamils====
Tamils do not have surnames: They have their father or mother or both father and mother's first name as initials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://bumpahead.net/tamil-name-structure-10dd63730563|title=Tamil name structure… |author=moulee|date=19 July 2009|publisher=bumpahead.net|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This standard naming practice has not been acknowledged by Facebook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/facebook-should-scrap-its-regressive-real-names-policy/article7797302.ece|title=Really harassed by Facebook’s ‘real names’|author=G. Sampath|date=24 October 2015|publisher=The Hindu|accessdate=15 April 2018|via=www.thehindu.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transgender users===
Facebook's real-name policy does not reflect adopted names or [[pseudonym]]s used by the [[transgender]] community, and has led to suspending users with real names that might be thought to be fake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=Associated Press| url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2009-05-25/business/20872135_1_accounts-with-fake-names-facebook-facebook-guidelines-and-features|work=The San Francisco Chronicle|first=Barbara|last=Ortutay|date=May 25, 2009|title=Real users caught in Facebook fake-name purge|accessdate=October 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A user via the anonymous [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]] app [[Secret (app)|Secret]] began reporting "fake names" which caused user profiles to be suspended, specifically targeting the [[stage name]]s of [[drag queen]]s.&lt;ref name="Business Insider"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Holpuck|first1=Amanda|title=Facebook still freezing accounts despite apology to drag queens over 'real names.'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/17/facebook-still-freezing-accounts-despite-apology-drag-queens-real-names|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transgender people have also been affected by the policy, including one former Facebook employee who initiated development on Facebook's custom gender options, who was suspended on the day the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] ruled in ''[[Obergefell v. Hodges]]'' that same-sex marriage bans were unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://medium.com/@zip/my-name-is-only-real-enough-to-work-at-facebook-not-to-use-on-the-site-c37daf3f4b03|title=My name is only real enough to work at Facebook, not use on the site|publisher=[[Medium.com]]|author=Zip|date=June 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2015/06/28/woman-responsible-for-facebook-gender-options-kicked-off-for-violating-real-names-policy/|title=Woman responsible for Facebook gender options kicked off for violating real names policy|date=June 28, 2015|first=Naith|last=Payton|publisher=[[Pink News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to gender non-conforming activist D. Dragonetti, Facebook even disregarded their government identification when supplied.{{Better source|date=March 2015|reason=Daily Dot.  This is an opinion piece.  Author admits the article is about his/her personal experience, and it may or may not be completely factual or verifiable}}&lt;ref name="Daily Dot"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dragonetti| first1=D.| title=Is Facebook easing up on its 'real names' policy—or cracking down? | work=[[The Daily Dot]]|date=October 20, 2014|accessdate=October 23, 2014|url= http://www.dailydot.com/opinion/facebook-real-names-cracking-down-transgender/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 1, 2014, [[Chris Cox (Facebook)|Chris Cox]], Chief Product Officer at Facebook, offered an apology to the LGBT community and drag kings and queens: &lt;blockquote&gt;In the two weeks since the real-name policy issues surfaced, we've had the chance to hear from many of you in these communities and understand the policy more clearly as you experience it. We've also come to understand how painful this has been. We owe you a better service and a better experience using Facebook, and we're going to fix the way this policy gets handled so everyone affected here can go back to using Facebook as you were.&lt;ref name="chriscoxpost"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/chris.cox/posts/10101301777354543|title=Chris Cox - I want to apologize to the affected community of drag...|last=Cox|first=Chris|date=October 1, 2014|publisher=[[Facebook]] |accessdate=October 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Users target of religious persecution ===
Secular, atheist, agnostic, humanist, or users who comment or blog expressing views critical of particular religions, sects or religion in general, as well as religious people who express the opposing views critical of atheism or agnosticism very often have a legitimate need to use an alias. Some of these users could suffer rejection, retaliation or violence if their views – contrary to those of their family, friends or community – are known. In some cases, secular bloggers are exposed to imprisonment by an intolerant government, violent attacks in the street or even being killed by religious fanatics. Examples are the incarceration of activist and blogger [[Raif Badawi]] in Saudi Arabia and a string of attacks and murders of secular activists in [[Attacks by Islamic extremists in Bangladesh|Bangladesh]] or Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/abdullah-sharif/pakistans-religious-extremism_b_9577338.html|title=Pakistan's Religious Extremism: A World Menace|first=Abdullah|last=Sharif|date=1 April 2016|website=huffingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reaction ==
International non-profit [[digital rights]] group [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] stated they were "alarmed to hear that Facebook's 'real name' policy is disproportionately affecting the LGBTQ community."&lt;ref name="EFF"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/09/facebooks-real-name-policy-can-cause-real-world-harm-lgbtq-community |title=Facebook's 'Real Name' Policy Can Cause Real-World Harm for the LGBTQ Community |last1=Kayyali |last2=York |first1=Nadia |first2=Jillian |date=September 16, 2014 |publisher=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] |accessdate=October 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Online magazine]] ''[[Queerty]]'' called Facebook's policy "a frankly creepy overreach of authority", adding "There are a million reasons why someone would choose to self-identify with a name other than the one that's printed on their birth certificate. And really, it's absolutely none of your business in the first place."&lt;ref name="Queerty"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.queerty.com/facebook-targeting-drag-queens-forcing-them-to-use-their-legal-names-20140911 |title=Facebook Targeting Drag Queens, Forcing Them To Use Their Legal Names |last=Tracer |first=Dan |date=September 11, 2014 |work=[[Queerty]] |accessdate=October 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview for MAGE Magazine, Second Life entrepreneur Jennifer Ceara Firehawk stated: "If we are not using our page to abuse or grief others they just need to leave us be. We are not hurting anyone…  FB does not realize some SL people earn lindens to turn into RL (real life) money and that is how they make a living. Once you force a person to change the SL name they will lose money due to not being able to find them on FB or SL as they may use FB for their buisness [sic] or advertise. So they end up losing buisness [sic] and money."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://0zymandius.wix.com/magemagazine#!September-18-The-Day-F-Book-killed-the-King-Part-1/c112t/55fc2bae0cf256c0bf936f60|title=The Day F Book killed the King : Part 1|date=September 18, 2015|first=Ian|last=Thomson|magazine=MAGE Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Seattle]] [[Drag (clothing)|drag performer]] Olivia LaGarce started a [[Change.org]] [[online petition]] titled "Allow performers to use their stage names on their Facebook accounts!"&lt;ref name="BBC News"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Stranger"/&gt;

== Compromise to protect those with special circumstances  ==
On December 15, 2015, Facebook announced in a press release&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsroom.fb.com/news/2015/12/community-support-fyi-improving-the-names-process-on-facebook/|title=Community Support FYI: Improving the Names Process on Facebook |last1=Osofsky |first1=Jason |last2=Gage |first2=Todd |date=December 15, 2015 |website=Facebook Newsroom |publisher=Facebook |access-date=December 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; that it would be providing a compromise to its real name policy after protests from groups such as the gay/lesbian community and abuse victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/sci-tech/facebook-modifies-real-names-policy-testing-use-of-assumed-names-1.2702400 |title=Facebook modifies 'real names' policy, testing use of assumed names |last=AFP |date=December 16, 2015 |website=CTV News |publisher=Bell Media |access-date=December 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site is developing a protocol that will allow members to provide specifics as to their "special circumstance" or "unique situation" with a request to use pseudonyms, subject to verification of their true identities. At that time, this was already being tested in the U.S. Product manager Todd Gage and vice president of global operations Justin Osofsky also promised a new method for reducing the number of members who must go through ID verification while ensuring the safety of others on Facebook. The fake name reporting procedure will also be modified, forcing anyone who makes such an allegation to provide specifics that would be investigated and giving the accused individual time to dispute the allegation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/15/facebook-change-controversial-real-name-policy?subid=17310058&amp;CMP=EMCNEWEML6619I2 |title=Facebook changes controversial 'real name' policy in wake of criticism  |last1=Holpuch |first1=Amanda |date=December 15, 2015 |website=The Guardian |publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited |access-date=December 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This measure was criticised by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, who pointed out that it forces the most vulnerable users to reveal intimate details of their personal lives. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/12/changes-facebooks-real-names-policy-still-dont-fix-problem|title=Changes to Facebook’s "Real Names" Policy Still Don’t Fix the Problem}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, as of January 2018, there is no evidence in Facebook's policies that this measure was ever implemented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/help/229715077154790?helpref=related|title=What other names are allowed on Facebook?|publisher=Facebook|access-date=May 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Monumento a la Cacica Gaitana.JPG|thumb|220px|Memorial Monument to Gaitana in Neiva, Colombia]]

'''Gaitana''', also known as '''Guaitipan,''' is referred to as '''La Gaitana''' and '''Cacica Gaitana''', was a 16th-century Yalcon woman from the region of Timaná, Huila, a leader who, in 1539–40, led the indigenous people of the Upper Magdalena River Valley in [[Colombia]] in armed resistance against the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|colonization by the Spanish]]. Her monument sculpted by [[Rodrigo Arenas]] stands in [[Neiva]], the capital of the [[Huila Department]] in Colombia.

== Pre-Columbian era ==
[[File:Yalcon mapa.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Map of indigenous peoples in the south of Huila]]
According to [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] chronologists, at the time of [[List of conquistadors in Colombia|conquest]], the modern territory of [[Huila Department]] was inhabited by many different indigenous peoples. The [[Yalcón people|Yalcón]] (with nearly 6,000 warriors), the Avirama, the Pinao, the [[Misak|Guanaca]], and the [[Paez people|Paez]] lived north of the [[Magdalena River]], with later concentrations around the La Plata River. South of the Magdalena River lived the [[Andaqui people|Andaquí]] and [[Timaná people|Timaná]] and to the east lived the [[Pijao people|Pijao]].

== Pedro de Añasco ==
[[List of conquistadors in Colombia|Pedro de Añasco]] was a Spanish conquistador, sent by [[Sebastián de Belalcázar]] to found a village in the territory of what is today [[Timaná]], in order to create a trade route through the [[Magdalena River|Magdalena Valley]].

De Añasco called all the indigenous leaders and demanded them to pay him a tribute. A tribe of Yalcón people, commanded by a young man and his mother (''[[cacique|cacica]]'' Gaitana) delayed the payment, and De Añasco decided to set an example by ordering her son to be burned alive.

== Revenge ==
The execution of Gaitana's son caused outrage among the indigenous tribes, who decided to cooperate with each other to join forces against the Spaniards. Añasco and his men were attacked by surprise. The men were executed and Añasco had his eyes removed and was dragged around the village until he died.

== Betrayal ==
However, one of the indigenous leaders, [[Cacique Matambo]], betrayed the organized indigenous forces. Matambo warned the Spaniards about plans against them with the result that the indigenous forces were crushed and the remaining indigenous people were gradually decimated by slavery, [[smallpox]] and other European diseases. A few hundred thousand of their descendents are scattered throughout the Colombian southwest as the modern [[Paez people]], [[Guambiano|Guambiano people]], and [[Pijao people]] among others.

== Biography ==
Tehrani Moghaddam was born on 29 October 1959 in [[Tehran]]. In 1977, he graduated from high school. In 1979, he received a bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering from Sharif University of Technology. In 1981, he received his MSc degree in Aerospace Engineering from [[K.N. Toosi University of Technology]].&lt;ref name="Hamshahrionline" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hasan"&gt;{{cite web|title=Shahid Tehrani Moqadam|url=http://shakhsiatnegar.com/shahid-tehrani-moqadam|website=www.shakhsiatnegar.com|accessdate=27 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moghaddam took part in the 1979 [[Iranian Revolution]]. In 1980, he joined the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and was given special responsibility for information in the northern section of Army of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution. He had important roles in the Iran–Iraq War as follows:&lt;ref name="Hamshahrionline" /&gt;
* Establishment of the first artillery corps in IRGC in 1982
* Establishment of the artillery research center in [[Ahvaz]] in 1982
* Establishment of the missile command center in IRGC in October 1983
* Firing cannonballs towards [[Basrah]] in the Iran–Iraq War in January 1984
* Firing the first rocket towards [[Kirkuk]] in the Iran–Iraq War in February 1985
* Missile Commander of the IRGC Air Force in August 1985
* Setting up the Lebanese [[Hezbollah]] missile unit in the years 1986–87
* Designed the [[Naze'at]] missile, the first Iranian missile, in 1987
* Commanded IRGC in [[Operation Mersad]] in August 1988 against Iraqi forces and MEK

== Iran's missile program ==
After the [[Iran–Iraq War]] (1980–1988), as Iran had only non-native [[Scud]] missiles with an operational range limited to 300 kilometers, Moghaddam set up a long-range missile program and designed a number of different missiles. His immediate goal was to develop a ballistic missile program with an operational range of more than 2,000 kilometers that could hugely threaten Israel.&lt;ref name="Zionist" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Staff"&gt;{{cite web|title=For first time, Iran media admit point of missile program was ‘to hit Israel’|url=http://www.worldtribune.com/2014/12/08/first-time-iran-media-admit-point-missile-program-hit-israel/|website=www.worldtribune.com|accessdate=31 December 2014|date=8 December 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141224232722/http://www.worldtribune.com/2014/12/08/first-time-iran-media-admit-point-missile-program-hit-israel/|archivedate=24 December 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mostafa Izadi, a commander in the Army of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution and close friend of Moghaddam said, "Since 1984 [Moghaddam] pioneered the IRGC's ground to ground missile system ... the work which has so frightened the world's imperialist powers and the Zionist regime today."&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt;

At first, Moghaddam designed missiles that were [[Reverse engineering|reverse-engineered]] from Russian made Scud missiles.  He produced the [[Shahab-1]] from the [[Scud-B]], and then developed the [[Shahab-2]] and the [[Zelzal]] missiles ([[Zelzal-1]], [[Zelzal-2]], and [[Zelzal-3]]). In 1998, from the [[Scud-C]] he developed the [[Shahab-3]], which is a [[medium-range ballistic missile]] with an operational range of 2,000 kilometers. It was tested between 1998 and 2003 and was added to Iran's military arsenal on 7 July 2003, with an official unveiling by [[Ali Khamenei|Ayatollah Khamenei]] on 20 July of the same year.&lt;ref name="Zionist"&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction of AGRI missiles to threaten Zionist entity |url=http://www.farsnews.com/newstext.php?nn=13930823000590|agency=Fars News|accessdate=28 December 2014|date=15 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Staff" /&gt; Moghaddam later improved the Shahab-3 and developed a new version of this missile called [[Ghadr-110]], which has a range of 1,800–2,000 kilometers and is also known as the Ghadr-101.

In 2008, Moghaddam developed and designed with the help of North korea the first range of Iranian [[solid-fueled]] ballistic missiles known as the [[Sejjil]].&lt;ref name="du-20090520"&gt;{{cite news |title=Iran Tests Second Solid-Fuelled Sejil Missile, Capable of 2, 000&amp;nbsp;km |work=[[Defense Update]] |date=20 May 2009|url=http://www.defense-update.com/newscast/0509/news/sejjil_test_200509.html |accessdate=21 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Iran tests new long-range missile |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=12 November 2008|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7725951.stm |accessdate=12 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sejjil replaced the Shahab [[Liquid-fuel rocket|liquid-fueled]] ballistic missiles. According to US [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] sources, the missile profile of the Sejjil closely matches those of the [[Ashoura (missile)|Ashura]] (Ghadr-110) and Samen missiles. The Sejjil launch tests on 13 November 2008 displayed an operational range of 2,000–2,500 kilometers.

Saeed Qasemi, a commander in the Army of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution, said that Iran owed its missile program to Moghaddam and stated: "A major part of [Iran's] progress in the field of missile capability was due to round-the-clock efforts by ... Moghaddam".&lt;ref name="expert" /&gt; Another commander has described Moghaddam as the founder of Iran's ballistic missile systems.&lt;ref name="expert" /&gt; Hossein Salami, the deputy head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corp, declared about his role: "Moghaddam was the main architect of the IRGC' missile power and the founder of the deterrent power of our country."&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt;

== Plot ==
In ''Darkness Calls'', several plotlines and characters from earlier stories converge.

=== Chapter One ===
In a tomb near [[Lucca]], [[Italy]], [[Igor Bromhead]] (last seen in ''[[Hellboy: The Right Hand of Doom#Box Full of Evil|Hellboy: Box Full of Evil]]'') summons the witch-goddess  [[Hecate]]  to a catacomb using runes written in blood. She demands to see the lizard body with which the devil [[Astaroth]] had cursed him and he obliges. Before she can destroy him he surprises her by invoking her secret name, which, ever since her resurrection in ''[[Hellboy: Wake the Devil]]'', has been that of [[Ilsa Haupstein]], her luckless human host. Bromhead reveals the bones of Haupstein's lover and Hecate's son, the vampire Vladimir Giurescu, from which Bromhead has magically wrung the information which gives him full power over the horrified goddess.

Back in England, three witches meet among standing stones; they have recovered the horns Hellboy broke from his skull during ''[[Hellboy: Wake the Devil]]'' and carved a bust of him from one of them. Hellboy wakes in the house of Harry Middleton, an old friend of his and of his adoptive father [[Trevor Bruttenholm]]. Under the witches' (and the carved horn's) influence, Hellboy decides to go for a walk, but not before accepting a vintage pistol and holster from Middleton as a gift. On his walk into the woods he is followed by a troop of cats and spied upon from the trees by a haggard specter with copper coins for eyes. Hellboy encounters two odd men and a woman who see him and cut short their rendition of the evocative [[Alfred Bulltop Stormalong|"Mister Stormalong"]] sea shanty, whose monster-hunting folk hero they identify with Hellboy, and whose verses we have been hearing over several pages of captions.   They inform Hellboy that they have reached the spot where corrupt 17th-century witchfinder Henry Hood hung three witches, "their ladies", who cursed him with torture and undeath (he is the coin-eyed specter we have seen). After hearing the hanging scene reenacted, the trio rush off to find the burial site of the three hanged witches, whose doting animal [[Familiar spirit|familiar]]s they reveal themselves to be: while Hellboy finds himself immobilized (by the spell being cast on his horn) they begin to assume the shapes of a frog, a raven and a cat, resurrecting their former mistresses with a potion poured on their gravesite, and promising Hellboy a gathering of witches (both alive and dead) "like none before in the history of the world" telling Hellboy: "They gather for you!!"

=== Chapter Two ===
The three witches with the carved horn thank the night and its associated powers for binding Hellboy and for resurrecting their three dead sister witches, executed by Henry Hood but now flying about a shocked Hellboy. The three greet their dead mistresses happily but Henry Hood bursts upon them transfixing two of them with the blue unearthly fire of his cutlass. It also wounds the half-demon Hellboy, who he attacks for his hellish parentage, leaving Hellboy reluctantly to be rescued by the third witch and her raven familiar who carry Hellboy off amid a flock of undead witches "to the sabbath at [[Leeds]]" until he shoots her with Harry Middleton's pistol and, dropped, plummets from the sky. He has not escaped, however, as he crashes through the roof of a disused, cobwebbed church and finds it filled with live witches who await him, having summoned him there using his carved horn.

For a cautious, inquisitive Hellboy, they recount the scene between Bromhead and Hecate, filling in relevant history from ''[[Hellboy: Wake the Devil]]'' and showing a triumphant Bromhead removing Ilsa Haupstein's wailing corpse from the [[Iron Maiden]] in which she had become Hecate, and bricking it into an alcove with Giurescu's still-amorous skeleton, there to wait "till Doomsday."  Bromhead had then tried futilely and disastrously to become King of the Witches by drawing down lunar powers beyond his strength. They tell Hellboy that as the son of a human witch and of the demon ruling the witches of [[Lancashire]] and [[Abbotsbury]] (and [[East Bromwich]], [[Faversham]] and [[Berkswell]]), they have selected him as their king. Hellboy angrily refuses them, declares himself at war with them, and begins to make his way out of the church. The carved horn shatters. Panic-stricken, the witches cast about for a plan, when Koku, a diminutive servant of Hellboy's old enemy [[Baba Yaga]], appears and conveys his mistress' offer to take Hellboy off their hands if they (who unlike the Baba Yaga still live in the real world) "offer" him to her. The witches agree, and Hellboy steps out of the church into the middle of a vast and empty wintry expanse through which an army of armed and fur-clad skeletons approach. Amidst the thicket of impaled lantern skulls in which she keeps her power, we see the Baba Yaga promising to take Hellboy's eye (in return for the one of hers he'd shot out decades before in "[[Hellboy: The Chained Coffin and Others#The Baba Yaga|"The Baba Yaga]]") and (as the arriving army reports to Hellboy) also his life.

=== Chapter Three ===
Back in the church, the witches debate who will rule them if not Hecate or Hellboy. The Gruagach of Loch Leane, Hellboy's vengeful fairy nemesis, arrives offering to go fetch a witch they poisoned and cut in pieces, one that they still fear, who should be their queen, and could rescue them from dwindling into nothing, and also "make the daytime world weep with fear."  Meanwhile, in the snowy plain "beyond the thrice-nine lands in the thrice-tenth kingdom" the Baba Yaga's army attacks Hellboy, who fights for a while and then runs into a wood. Giant wolves rush from the wood to attack the Baba Yaga's soldiers, and a giant white wolf guides Hellboy into the woods to the campfire of his master, the [[Leshii]]. Hellboy bores the Leshii who is nonetheless happy to save Hellboy in order to spite the Baba Yaga. Before departing in the form of a giant horned bear, the Leshii warns Hellboy to stay in the woods only for one night. He asks [[Perun]], the Russian storm-god, to destroy the army, which is buried in snow, as Hellboy finds them when, just before daybreak, he is chased from the woods by the Leshii's wolves. Thwarted, the Baba Yaga flies in her mortar and pestle to the castle of [[Koschei the Deathless]], who broods, cobwebbed on his throne, demanding that if he helps her, she must give him the gift of death. She promises to set him free from life in return for Hellboy's head. Meanwhile, Hellboy finds his way through a winter storm to a small house where he resists a brief attack from, and then makes friends with, the house's guardian spirit or [[Domovoi]]. The Domovoi tells him that Perun is hiding him from the Baba Yaga and from Koschei using the storm weather, but that Koschei cannot be killed as his soul is inside an egg inside a duck inside a rabbit inside a goat which the Baba Yaga has hidden. Meanwhile, the Baba Yaga finds Perun (who we have just seen as a spear-armed horseman riding above stormclouds) drawing lightning branches with a stick in the mud of a riverbank, a mud-caked and naked old man. Her soldiers dispatch him with arrows as she tells him she will tolerate no other Russian gods than herself.

===Chapter Four===
A bird grieves over Perun's body, meanwhile somewhere in England, blood wells over the lintel of a hilltop church, flowing from two murdered monks. A hole in the floor before the altar leads to an ancient cavern where the Gruagach and two elfin servants approach a well with a giant iron lid. When Gruagach rings on the lid with his hammer, a giant appears who puts on spectacles to read the letter Gruagach hands him - from the giant's masters, the witches of Britain - and then begins to weep at what he must do. He raises the lid and climbs down to get his prisoner for the Gruagach. With Perun dead, meanwhile, the storm outside Hellboy's cottage has failed, and Koschei kicks in the door. The two fight as Koschei explains his intentions and motives, and the Domovoi wails over his broken furniture. Hellboy impales Koschei and beheads him but Koschei merely reattaches his head. At that moment [[The Frog Princess|Vasilisa]], appearing at the cottage's door, subdues Koschei with light from the skull she received from Baba Yaga in her legend. Hellboy pins Koschei to the floor with his own sword and they run. Kosschei ignores the Domovoi's goading, extricates himself, and takes out an arrow from his pack. Vasilisa explains to Hellboy the story of her magic doll and her time with the Baba Yaga, and shows Hellboy the tunnel back to the real world, before falling to the first of Koschei's arrows, which also pepper Hellboy as Koschei rides on them.   Dying, Vasilisa gives Hellboy the wooden comb and blue handkerchief her doll had given her ("When I was old and grey and dying in my bed," she says) and then becomes her doll, still pierced by Koschei's arrow. Hellboy confronts the now-arrived Koschei.

===Chapter Five===
At [[Yggdrasil]], the world tree, a squirrel, (never identified specifically as [[Ratatoskr|Ratatosk]]) worries aloud that [[Ragnarok]] has come with the death of Vasilisa, but one of the Baba Yaga's soldiers shoots him and he dies. The Baba Yaga, Koku, and a figure that seems to be [[Death]] watch from their place at the tree's roots. In the distance, Hellboy tosses Vasilisa's comb at Koschei, who tosses it over his shoulder. Where it hits the earth a small forest springs up, its branches lifting Koschei into the sky and growing agonizingly through his chest and limbs. The Baba Yaga insists that there is no longer a place even in the real world to which Hellboy can run, and back in the hilltop church, the giant climbs out of his well carrying a small wooden box containing the dismembered and segmented body of his prisoner. He then climbs tearfully back into the hole, pulling the lid down over him, in order to escape the new and bloody world coming into being. Tugging the box out of the church, Gruagach and his companions tell a small bird (who will next appear in the opening scene of ''[[Hellboy: The Wild Hunt]]'') that it had best tell its mistress to choose sides "for our new queen is here."  Elsewhere, the lead fairy from ''[[Hellboy: The Chained Coffin and Others#The Corpse|Hellboy: The Corpse]]'' asks the [[Dagda]], fairy king, how bad it will be and the Dagda answers "We will not survive it."  In the Thrice-Tenth Kingdom, Hellboy begins to climb toward the tunnel back to reality; but the Baba Yaga calls for Koschei's soul and begins to breathe her power into its mouth. Up in the branches, Koschei screams as his body bursts with light and fire burning free of the branches. He descends blazing upon Hellboy as the Baba Yaga anticipates using Hellboy's eye to look into Hell and into secret places to learn "the secret workings of all things."  As Hellboy crushes Koschei beneath a boulder, the Baba Yaga repeats that Hellboy has no home left in the real world, and through the tunnel we see England's witches flying about their cobwebbed church celebrating the approach of their new queen. She breathes more power into the goat and Koschei bursts up through the stone as a blazing giant, screaming "DEATH!"

===Chapter Six===
The Baba Yaga's ten thousand skull lanterns are going out, all their power breathed into Koschei. Meanwhile, two of Baba Yaga's undead soldiers reminisce about serving under Koschei when alive, and pity his servitude to the witch. Koschei begs Hellboy to accept death, and regrets that he is cursed to keep killing Vasilisa. The Baba Yaga breathes her last spark of life into Koschei who still cannot defeat Hellboy. She considers using the spirit of [[Rasputin]] which she had stored in an acorn since the epilogue of ''[[Hellboy: Conqueror Worm]]'', but Koku knocks it from her hand so it falls through the roots of the World Tree into Hell. Defeated, Koschei hurls his sword at and into a departing Hellboy's back, so that he drops Vasilisa's blue handkerchief which becomes a flood to carry Koshchei's body away. Death explains to the Baba Yaga that "Hellboy is as deathless as Koschei" and his eye must be given freely, for which Hellboy is not yet ready. Hellboy wanders through the tunnel into the cobwebbed church (now empty), where he silently passes the ghostly figure of Vasilisa, lighting a cigar and reaching back to pull out Koschei's sword. Henry Hood greets him in the churchyard repeating "Finish it" before dissolving into dust and two copper coins. Scratched in the rust of Hood's cutlass is the name: IGOR BROMHEAD. Forty-two hours later in Italy, near Lucca, two villagers show Hellboy where Bromhead has been hiding - he has been eating their sheep. Having swallowed the moon, he has bloated into a monstrous giant human worm. He begs Hellboy to kill him, while two witches, flying as birds, urge that he be left to his fate. Hellboy asks if he's ready and then stabs him with Hood's cutlass. Dying, and once again with a fully human body, Bromhead tells Hellboy that he will see him in Hell, and that he sees him there already, seated on a dragon at the head of his army. Meanwhile, the Dagda meets the Gruagach and his friends, who have dragged their new queen's box to the top of a hill. He begs the Gruagach to see reason and one of the Gruagach's two bodies stabs him fatally in the back, before stabbing his own heart in remorse. The Gruagach announces the arrival of the watching fairies' new queen, who says from her box (one corner washed by the golden stream of Dagda's blood) "My day's come at last... and woe unto man."

=== Epilogues ===
At the Colorado headquarters of the [[Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense|B.P.R.D.]], [[Kate Corrigan]] is reading to [[Liz Sherman]] and [[Abe Sapien]] from a letter that has arrived from their former teammate Hellboy. Kate is alarmed when Abe points out that Harry Middleton has been dead for over twenty years.

Meanwhile, back at the Italian catacombs, the imprisoned Hecate receives a visit from the spirit of [[Hellboy Universe#Sir Edward Grey.2C Witchfinder|Sir Edward Grey]]. She tells Grey that she is his queen and that he has walked in her shadow for a long time. At his request she tells him of her fatal seduction of Thoth, king of the Hyperborean city of Gorinium, who kept the knowledge of three captive Watchers mostly to himself. After Thoth fell asleep, Hecate entered the garden where she killed the Watchers, drinking up their blood so she can write all of their knowledge on the walls of Gorinium's temple so everyone would read it. This event caused the downfall of the Hyperborean civilization as Hecate, revered by some as a goddess, is cursed into her lamia-like form by Thoth. Regardless, Hecate tells Grey she is still unrepentant at her mission to enlighten and free mankind: insisting that she is beyond human knowledge. Before entering a deep sleep until the last day when Hellboy calls her, Hecate foretells her own death in an [[Hellboy: The Storm and the Fury|upcoming war]] and that Grey will find and assist Helboy. Hecate concludes her prophecy before entering her rest by telling Grey: "Before you are finally allowed to die, you will suffer as few men have ever suffered. You will learn to do evil to accomplish good."

'''Ian Kevin Curtis''' (15 July 1956&amp;nbsp;– 18 May 1980) was an English singer-songwriter and musician. He was the lead singer and lyricist of the [[post-punk]] band [[Joy Division]]. Joy Division released their debut album, ''[[Unknown Pleasures]]'', in 1979 and recorded their follow-up, ''[[Closer (Joy Division album)|Closer]]'', in 1980.

Curtis, who suffered from [[epilepsy]] and [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], took his own life on 18 May 1980, on the eve of Joy Division's first North American tour and shortly before the release of their second album. His suicide resulted in the band's dissolution and the subsequent formation of [[New Order (band)|New Order]]. Curtis was known for his [[bass-baritone]] voice, dance style, and songwriting typically filled with imagery of [[loneliness|desolation]], emptiness, and [[social alienation|alienation]].

==Early life==
Curtis was born on 15 July 1956, at the Memorial Hospital in [[Stretford|Stretford, Manchester]], and grew up in a working-class household in [[Macclesfield|Macclesfield, Cheshire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Curtis |first=Deborah |title=[[Touching from a Distance|Touching from a Distance.

He was awarded a scholarship at the age of 11 at Macclesfield's [[Independent school|independent]] [[The King's School, Macclesfield|King's School]]. Here, he developed his interests in philosophy, literature, and eminent poets such as [[Thom Gunn]].&lt;ref&gt;''So This is Permanence: Joy Division Lyrics and Notebooks'' {{ISBN|978-1-452-14650-8}} p. vii.&lt;/ref&gt; While at King's School, he was awarded several scholastic awards in recognition of his abilities—particularly at the ages of 15 and 16. The year after Ian had graduated from King's School, the Curtis family purchased a house from a relative, and moved to [[New Moston]].&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, Deborah (1995). p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

As a teenager, Curtis chose to perform [[social work|social service]] by visiting the elderly as part of a school programme. While visiting, he and his friends would steal any prescription drugs that they found and later take them together as a group. On one occasion when he was 16,&lt;ref name="Savage" &gt;{{cite news|last=Savage |first=Jon |authorlink=Jon Savage |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/dark-star-the-final-days-of-ian-curtis-by-his-joy-division-bandmates-394281.html|title=Dark star: The Final Days of Ian Curtis by his Joy Division Bandmates |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |accessdate=25 June 2017|date=6 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; after consuming a large dosage of [[Chlorpromazine|Largactil]] he and his friends had stolen, Curtis was discovered [[unconsciousness|unconscious]]&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, Deborah (1995). p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; in his bedroom by his father and was taken to hospital to have his [[Gastric lavage|stomach pumped]].&lt;ref name="Butcher" &gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.clashmusic.com/features/10-things-you-never-knew-about-ian-curtis|title=10 Things You Never Knew About...

Curtis obtained a job at a record shop in [[Manchester City Centre]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mia_Tuft/publication/283262617_Ian_Curtis_Punk_rock_epilepsy_and_suicide/links/56408ccc08aef2be8e04e7d6/Ian-Curtis-Punk-rock-epilepsy-and-suicide.pdf |title=Ian Curtis: Punk Rock, Epilepsy, and Suicide |publisher=researchgate.net |date=10 December 2015 |accessdate=14 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; before obtaining more stable employment within the [[civil service]]. His employment as a civil servant saw Curtis initially deployed to [[Cheadle Hulme]], where he worked for several months with the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]],&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, Deborah (1995). p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; before he was offered alternate employment within the Manpower Services Commission in a building at [[Piccadilly Gardens]]. He later worked as a civil servant in [[Woodford, Greater Manchester]], although at his request, approximately one year later,&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, Deborah (1995). ch. 3, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Curtis was posted to Macclesfield's [[Jobcentre Plus|Employment Exchange]], where he worked as an Assistant Disablement Resettlement Officer.

On 23 August 1975, Curtis married Deborah Woodruff, to whom he was introduced by a friend, Tony Nuttall.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, Deborah (1995). pp. 10-11.&lt;/ref&gt; Ian and Deborah initially became friends then began dating in December 1972, when both were 16 years old.&lt;ref&gt;''The Life of Ian Curtis: Torn Apart'' {{ISBN|978-0-85712-010-6}} p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=n|Curtis and Woodruff had become [[Engagement|engaged]] on 17 April 1974.}} Their wedding service was conducted at [[St Thomas' Church, Henbury|St Thomas' Church]] in [[Henbury, Cheshire]].

Before long, the couple became disillusioned with life in [[Oldham]], and [[remortgage]]d their house&lt;ref&gt;''So This is Permanence: Joy Division Lyrics and Notebooks'' {{ISBN|978-1-452-14650-8}} p. viii&lt;/ref&gt; before briefly returning to live with Ian's grandparents. Shortly thereafter, in May 1977, the couple moved into their own house in Barton Street, Macclesfield,&lt;ref name="Savage" /&gt; with one of the rooms of the property becoming colloquially known between the couple as Curtis's "song-writing room".&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, Deborah (1995). p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Joy Division==
{{main|Joy Division}}
At a July 1976 [[Sex Pistols]] gig at Manchester's [[Lesser Free Trade Hall]], Curtis encountered three childhood school friends named [[Bernard Sumner]], [[Peter Hook]], and Terry Mason.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The trio informed Curtis—whom they had seen at earlier punk gigs at The Electric Circus—of their intentions to form a band,&lt;ref name="Savage" /&gt; and Curtis informed them of his then-recent efforts to do likewise,&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, Deborah (1995). p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; before proposing himself as both their singer and [[lyricist]]. Initially, Mason became the band's drummer, but his rehearsal sessions were largely unproductive, and he briefly became the band's manager.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, Deborah (1995). p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; The group then unsuccessfully attempted to recruit several drummers before selecting [[Stephen Morris (musician)|Stephen Morris]] in August 1977.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;''Suicide in the Entertainment Industry: An Encyclopedia of 840 Twentieth Century Cases'' {{ISBN|0-78642-333-1}} p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; The band was later managed by [[Rob Gretton]], who—having already seen Joy Division perform live at local venues such as [[Rafters (nightclub)|Rafters]]—offered to become their manager in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, Deborah (1995). pp. 61-62.&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, the band named themselves "Warsaw", from the title of a song on David Bowie's then-recent album ''[[Low (David Bowie album)|Low]]'', but as this name somewhat conflicted with that of a London-based group named "[[Warsaw Pakt]]", they renamed themselves "Joy Division".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radiox.co.uk/features/previous-names-of-classic-bands/joy-division-warsaw-stiff-kittens/ ''radiox.co.uk'']&lt;/ref&gt; This moniker was derived from the 1955 novel ''[[The House of Dolls]]'', which featured a [[Nazi]] [[concentration camp]] with a [[sexual slavery]] wing called the "Joy Division". The cover of [[An Ideal for Living|the band's first EP]] depicted a drawing of a [[Hitler Youth]] beating a drum and the A-side contained a song, "Warsaw", which was a musical retelling of the life of Nazi leader [[Rudolf Hess]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Fox-Bevilacqua |first=Marisa |title=An Unlikely Tribute: How Cult U.K. Band Joy Division Found Inspiration in Auschwitz |url=https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/.premium-how-joy-division-found-inspiration-in-auschwitz-1.5360552/ |work=[[Haaretz]] |date=15 January 2015 |accessdate=19 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After founding [[Factory Records]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/goingout/music/the-20-greatest-british-rock-bands-of-all-time-a3655391.html|title=The 20 Greatest British Rock Bands of All Time|access-date=12 November 2017|newspaper=Evening Standard|date=7 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Alan Erasmus]], [[Tony Wilson]] signed the band to his label following the band's first appearance on the TV music show he hosted, ''[[So It Goes (TV series)|So It Goes]]'', in September 1978. This appearance had been largely prompted by an abusive letter sent to Wilson by Curtis, and saw the band play the song "[[Shadowplay (song)|Shadowplay]]".&lt;ref name="Butcher" /&gt;{{refn|group=n|Sections of this live version of "Shadowplay" were broadcast with disused, inverted monochrome footage from a ''[[World in Action]]'' documentary depicting cityscapes superimposed across the footage of the band.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, Deborah (1995). p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While performing with Joy Division, Curtis became known for his quiet and awkward demeanour, and a unique dancing style&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiox.co.uk/artists/joy-division/what-is-shes-lost-control-by-joy-division-about/|title=What Is She’s Lost Control By Joy Division About?|date=28 January 2018|publisher=|via=radiox.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; often reminiscent of the epileptic seizures he began experiencing in late 1978. Although predominantly a singer, Curtis also played guitar on a handful of tracks (usually when Sumner was playing synthesizer; "Incubation" and a ''[[List of Peel sessions#J|Peel session]]'' version of "[[Transmission (song)|Transmission]]" were rare instances when both Sumner and Curtis played guitar). Initially, Curtis played Sumner's [[Shergold]] Masquerader, but in September 1979 he acquired his own guitar, a [[Vox Phantom]] VI Special (often described incorrectly as a [[Vox Teardrop|Teardrop]] or ordinary Phantom model) which had many built-in effects used both live and in studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ian Curtis's Shergold Masquerader |url=http://equipboard.com/pros/ian_curtis/shergold-masquerader |work=equipboard.com |accessdate=19 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
===Relationships===
Curtis's widow has claimed that, in October 1979, Curtis began conducting an affair with the Belgian journalist and music promoter [[Annik Honoré]],&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Barton |first=Laura |title='I was just besotted' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2005/apr/11/popandrock.joydivision |newspaper=The Guardian |date=11 April 2005 |accessdate=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; whom he had first met at a gig held in [[Brussels]] that month.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, Deborah (1995). p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Uncut"&gt;{{cite news |last=Pinnock |first=Tom |url=http://www.uncut.co.uk/features/joy-division-we-didnt-know-ian-curtis-was-approaching-his-breaking-point-70344/3 |title=Joy Division: "We didn't Know Ian Curtis was Approaching His Breaking Point." |work=[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]] |date=21 August 2015 |accessdate=23 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, despite the fact he had for many years exhibited a somewhat [[Control (psychology)#Situational control|controlling]] attitude within their relationship&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, Deborah (1995). p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; (which had included minimising any opportunity for his wife to come into contact with other men),&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, Deborah (1995). p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Curtis was consumed with guilt over this affair due to being married,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/celebrity-deaths-that-changed-music-history-gone-too-soon-w492394/ian-curtis-w492401| title= Celebrity Deaths that Changed Music History: Gone Too Soon| date= 4 August 2017| author= Brittany Spanos| website= rollingstone.com| accessdate= 7 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the father to their baby daughter, but at the same time still yearning to be with Honoré.&lt;ref name="Bernard Sumner"&gt;{{cite news |last=Sumner |first=Bernard |authorlink=Bernard Sumner |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/joy-divisions-bernard-sumner-remembering-the-dangerous-path-fellow-bandmate-ian-curtis-was-walking-a6741791.html |title=Joy Division's Bernard Sumner Remembering the Dangerous Path Fellow Bandmate Ian Curtis was Walking |work=The Independent |date=20 November 2015 |accessdate=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On one occasion in 1980, Curtis asked Bernard Sumner to make a decision on his behalf as to whether he should remain with his wife or form a deeper relationship with Honoré; Sumner refused.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Curtis, Deborah (1995). ch. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Honoré claimed in a 2010 interview that although she and Curtis had spent extensive periods of time in each other's company, their relationship had been a [[Platonic love|platonic]] one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Joy Division |url=http://joydivision-neworder.blogspot.com/2011/02/ian-curtis-and-annik-honore-dazzling.html |work=Joy Division Bootlegs|title= Ian Curtis and Annik Honoré – the Dazzling History of Joy Division|date=1 February 2011 |accessdate=2 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Curtis' bandmates later recollected that Curtis began to become slightly "lofty" and distant from them after he had become acquainted with Honoré, who was demanding of his time and attention.&lt;ref name="Uncut"/&gt; These facts would occasionally invoke pranks directed at himself and Honoré from them. He is also known to have become a [[Vegetarianism|vegetarian]]—likely at Honoré's behest—although he was known to have eaten meat when not in her presence.&lt;ref name="Uncut"/&gt;

===Epilepsy===
Curtis began suffering [[Epileptic seizure|epileptic fits]] in late 1978; he was officially diagnosed with the condition on 23 January the following year,&lt;ref&gt;''Unknown Pleasures: Inside Joy Division'' {{ISBN|978-1-84983-360-8}} p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=n|Curtis may have suffered from epilepsy for several years prior to his diagnosis. His wife later recollected that, following his official diagnosis, he confided in her that, as early as 1972, he had experienced floating sensations as if he had taken drugs when he had not. On other occasions in the early- and mid-1970s, he would have to be supported from venues and premises if disturbed by artificial lights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mia_Tuft/publication/283262617_Ian_Curtis_Punk_rock_epilepsy_and_suicide/links/56408ccc08aef2be8e04e7d6/Ian-Curtis-Punk-rock-epilepsy-and-suicide.pdf |title=Ian Curtis: Punk Rock, Epilepsy, and Suicide |publisher=researchgate.net |date=10 December 2015 |accessdate=14 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} with his particular case being described by doctors as so severe, his "life would [be] ruled to [[obsolescence]] by his severe epilepsy"&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;''Joy Division's Unknown Pleasures'' {{ISBN|978-0-82641-549-3}} p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; without the various strong dosages of medications he was prescribed. Having joined the [[Epilepsy Action|British Epilepsy Association]], Curtis was initially open to discuss his condition with anyone who inquired, although he soon became withdrawn, and reluctant to discuss any issue regarding his condition beyond the most mundane and necessary aspects.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, Deborah (1995). p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; On each occasion it became apparent a particular prescribed medication failed to control Curtis's seizures, his doctor would prescribe a different [[anticonvulsant]], and his wife noted his being "full of renewed enthusiasm" that this particular formulation would help him bring his seizures under control.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, Deborah (1995). p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout 1979 and 1980, Curtis's condition gradually worsened amid the pressure of performances and touring,&lt;ref name="Savage" /&gt; with his seizures becoming more frequent and more intense.&lt;ref&gt;''Unknown Pleasures: Inside Joy Division'' {{ISBN|978-1-84983-360-8}}. p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt; Following his diagnosis, Curtis continued to drink, smoke, and maintain an irregular sleeping pattern—against the advice given to those suffering from the condition.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; The medications Curtis was prescribed for his condition produced numerous [[side effect]]s, including extreme [[mood swing]]s.&lt;ref name="Savage" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.joydiv.org/iancurtis.htm ''joydiv.org'']&lt;/ref&gt; This change in personality was also observed by Curtis's wife, family and in-laws, who noted how taciturn he had become in his wife's company.&lt;ref name="ch11"&gt;Curtis, Deborah (1995). ch. 11, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the birth of his daughter in April 1979, because of the severity of his medical condition, Ian was seldom able to hold his baby daughter in case he compromised the child's safety.&lt;ref name="ch11"/&gt;

At the time of the recording of the band's second album, Curtis's condition was particularly severe, with him enduring a weekly average of two [[generalised tonic-clonic seizure#Phases|tonic-clonic seizures]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mia_Tuft/publication/283262617_Ian_Curtis_Punk_rock_epilepsy_and_suicide/links/56408ccc08aef2be8e04e7d6/Ian-Curtis-Punk-rock-epilepsy-and-suicide.pdf ''researchgate.net'']&lt;/ref&gt; On one occasion during these recordings, Curtis's bandmates became concerned when they noted he had been absent from the recording studio for two hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/ian-curtis-remembered-joy-division-and-his-loved-ones-their-own-words-461113|title=Ian Curtis remembered by Joy Division and loved ones in their own words|date=18 May 2016|work=Newsweek|access-date=28 February 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band's bassist, Peter Hook, discovered Curtis [[Unconsciousness|unconscious]] on the floor of the studio's toilets, having hurt his head on a sink following a seizure.&lt;ref name="Guardian" &gt;{{cite news |last=Hook |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Hook |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jun/14/joy-division-ian-curtis-suicide |title=Joy Division's Ian Curtis Commits Suicide |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=25 June 2017 |date=14 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite instances such as this, Hook stated that, largely through ignorance of the condition, he, Sumner and Morris did not know how to help. Nonetheless, Hook was adamant that Curtis never wanted to upset or concern his bandmates, and would "tell [us] what [we] wanted to hear" if they expressed any concern as to his condition.&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt; In one incident at a concert held before almost 3,000 people at [[Rainbow Theatre|the Rainbow]] in [[Finsbury Park]] in April 1980 when Joy Division appeared alongside [[the Stranglers]], the [[lighting technician]]s at this venue—contrary to instructions given to them by Rob Gretton prior to the gig—switched on [[strobe light]]s midway through Joy Division's performance, causing Ian Curtis to almost immediately stagger backwards and collapse against Stephen Morris's drum kit in the throes of an evident seizure. He had to be carried offstage to the band's dressing room to recuperate.&lt;ref name="Tonino Cagnucci"&gt;{{cite web| url= https://disordertc.wordpress.com/tag/torn-apart-the-life-of-ian-curtis/| title= Disorder and Other Unknown Pleasures| date= 4 April 2015| author= Tonino Cagnucci| accessdate= 2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Curtis had recovered from this first seizure, he was adamant the band travel to [[West Hampstead]] to honour their commitment to perform their second gig of the evening at this location, although some 25 minutes into this second gig, Curtis's "dancing started to lose its rhythmic sense and change into something else entirely" before he collapsed to the floor and experienced the most violent seizure he had endured to date.&lt;ref name="Tonino Cagnucci"/&gt;

===Stage performances===
Curtis's onstage dancing was often reminiscent of the seizures he experienced,&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; and has been termed by some to be his "epilepsy dance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.gigwise.com/news/107004/ian-curtis-joy-division-dancing-tribute-anniversary-of-death| title= Explore the Strange, Wonderful Dancing of Joy Division's Ian Curtis| date= 18 May 2016| author=Alexandra Pollard| website= Gigwise.com| accessdate= 25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout Joy Division's live performances in 1979 and 1980, Curtis collapsed several times while performing and had to be carried off stage.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; To minimise any possibility of Curtis having epileptic seizures,  flashing lights were prohibited at Joy Division gigs; despite these measures, Bernard Sumner later stated that certain percussion effects would cause Curtis to suffer a seizure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Lester |first=Paul |date=November 2007 |title=Torn Apart: The Legend of Joy Division |magazine=[[Record Collector]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1980,&lt;ref name="p126"&gt;Curtis, Deborah (1995). p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; Terry Mason was appointed as a minder to ensure Curtis took his prescribed medications, avoided alcohol consumption, and got sufficient sleep.&lt;ref name="p126"/&gt;

Regarding the [[choreography]] of Curtis's stage performances, [[Greil Marcus]] in ''The History of Rock 'n' Roll in Ten Songs'' quotes [[Jon Savage]] from ''[[Melody Maker]]'': "Ian's mesmeric style mirrored the ever more frequent epileptic spasms that Deborah Curtis had to cope with at home."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Savage |first=Jon |title=Joy Division: 'Unknown Pleasures |journal=[[Melody Maker]] |date=21 July 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marcus remarked that Curtis's performance "might also have been a matter of intentionally replicating fits, re-enacting them, using them as a form of energy and a form of music."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The History of Rock 'n' Roll in Ten Songs|last = Marcus|first = Greil |publisher = [[Yale University Press]]|year = 2014|isbn = |location = New Heaven &amp; London|pages = 44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Curtis's final live performance with Joy Division was on 2 May 1980. This performance was at the High Hall of [[Birmingham University]], and included Joy Division's first and only performance of "[[Ceremony (song)|Ceremony]]", later recorded by [[New Order (band)|New Order]] and released as their debut single. The final song Curtis performed on stage with Joy Division prior to his death was "[[Digital (Joy Division song)|Digital]]".{{refn|group=n|The recording of this performance was later included on the 1981 [[compilation album]] ''[[Still (Joy Division album)|Still]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.joydiv.org/c020580.htm Joy Division Concert: 2 May 1980] Joy Division Central&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Depression and initial suicide attempt===
Following Curtis's first definite [[suicide attempt]] on 6 April 1980, Tony Wilson and his partner, Lindsay—expressing deep concerns as to Joy Division's intense touring schedule being detrimental to Curtis's physical and mental well-being&lt;ref&gt;''Mr Manchester and the Factory Girl: The Story of Tony and Lindsay Wilson'' {{ISBN|978-0-859-65875-1}} ch. 22&lt;/ref&gt;—invited him to recuperate at their cottage in [[Charlesworth, Derbyshire|Charlesworth]]. At this address, he is known to have written several letters to Honoré, proclaiming his love for her as he recuperated from this initial suicide attempt.&lt;ref name="Uncut"/&gt;{{refn|group=n|This first definite suicide attempt was an overdose of [[barbiturate]]s. After he had consumed these tablets, and having written an initial [[suicide note]], (which Rob Gretton later disallowed Deborah Curtis to actually view),&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, Deborah (1995). pp. 115-116.&lt;/ref&gt; he informed his wife what he had done, and she in turn phoned an ambulance. Curtis later stated that he had phoned his wife because he feared he had not consumed enough tablets for the attempt to be successful, and that he would be left with brain damage. Prior to this instance, he did once slash his wrists while drunk, although his bandmates remain unconvinced this attempt was serious.}}

By early 1980, Curtis's marriage to Deborah was floundering, as she had commenced divorce proceedings due to his having failed to cease all contact with Honoré.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Suicide Movies: Social Patterns 1900-2009'' {{ISBN|978-1-616-76390-9}} p. 227&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=n|Deborah Curtis and her daughter had moved into her parents' home in early 1980.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;}} Curtis had enjoyed [[solitude]], but had never been mentally equipped for living alone.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, Deborah (1995). p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; He was having difficulty balancing his family obligations with his musical ambitions, and his health was gradually worsening as a result of his epilepsy, thus increasing his dependency upon others.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; On the evening prior to his death, Curtis informed Bernard Sumner of his insistence upon seeing his wife that evening.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, Deborah (1995). p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; He had also made firm plans to rendezvous with his bandmates at [[Manchester Airport]] the following day, prior to their departure for America.&lt;ref name="Bernard Sumner"/&gt;

==Death==
On the evening of 17 May, Curtis asked his wife to drop her impending divorce proceedings; she replied that he would likely have changed his mind by the following morning, and then—mindful of his previous suicide attempt and also concerned his state of [[anxiety]] and frustration may drive Curtis into an epileptic fit—offered to spend the night in his company.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, Deborah (1995). p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; Deborah then drove to her parents' home to inform them of her intentions. When Deborah Curtis returned to Barton Street, Ian's demeanour had changed, and he informed his wife of his intentions to spend the night alone, first making her promise not to return to the house before he had taken his scheduled 10 a.m. train to Manchester to rendezvous with his bandmates.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, Deborah (1995). pp. 131-132.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early hours of 18 May 1980, Curtis [[suicide|killed himself]] by hanging&lt;!-- "Hanged" is what happens to people, voluntarily or in cases of execution. "Hung" is for paintings, tapestries, pots of flowers, etc. --&gt; himself in the kitchen of his house at 77 Barton Street, Macclesfield.

Retrieved 3 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; His wife Deborah found his body the next morning; he had used the kitchen's [[Clothes line|washing line]] to hang himself after having written a note to her in which he declared his love for her despite having recently conducted an affair with Honoré.{{refn|group=n|In this [[suicide note]], Curtis recollected his life with Deborah and recounted his love for her. He also claimed that he could not be so cruel to Annik as to inform her he did not wish to see her again even if his marriage depended upon it. By the time Curtis had finished writing this suicide note, he stated it was dawn and he could "hear the birds singing".&lt;ref name="p133"&gt;Curtis, Deborah (1995). p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; In her [[biography]], ''[[Touching from a Distance]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Control': A Refreshingly Stripped-down Look at Troubled Joy Division Singer |date=19 October 2007 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2245&amp;dat=20071019&amp;id=Ef1RAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=hjQNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2110,59294394 |publisher=Lodi News-Sentinel |accessdate=11 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deborah Curtis recalls finding her husband's body, and initially thinking that he was still alive before noting the washing line around his neck.&lt;ref name="p133"/&gt;

According to Tony Wilson,&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;''The Rough Guide to Rock'' {{ISBN|1-858-28457-0}} p. 552.&lt;/ref&gt; prior to his suicide, Curtis had watched [[Werner Herzog]]'s 1977 film ''[[Stroszek]]'' and listened to [[Iggy Pop]]'s album ''[[The Idiot (album)|The Idiot]]''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; His wife recollected that he had taken photographs of their wedding and their baby daughter off the walls, apparently to view as he composed his suicide note.&lt;ref name="p133"/&gt;

At the time of his suicide, Joy Division were on the eve of their debut North American tour, and Deborah Curtis has stated Ian had viewed this upcoming tour with extreme trepidation, not only because of his extreme fear of flying (he had wanted to travel to America by ship), but because he had also expressed deep concerns as to how American audiences would react to his epilepsy.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Deborah Curtis has also claimed Ian had confided in her on several occasions that he held no desire to live past his early twenties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.omahype.com/2012/09/joy-division/|title=Joy Division|website=omahype.com|accessdate=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anothermag.com/current/view/1897/Ian_Curtis|title=Ian Curtis's Stark Utilitarian Style|first=|last=AnOther|website=anothermag.com|accessdate=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had furthermore expressed to both his wife and Annik Honoré his deep concerns as to his medical condition being likely to kill him&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/discoverpsychiatry/mindsonfilmblog/control.aspx | title=Improving the Lives of People with Mental Illness| publisher=rcpsych.ac.uk| date=23 July 2013 | accessdate=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to his receiving mockery from the band's audiences,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283262617_Ian_Curtis_Punk_rock_epilepsy_and_suicide| title= Ian Curtis: Punk Rock, Epilepsy and Suicide| date= 9 November 2015| author= Mia Tuft| website= researchgate.net| accessdate= 17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that this mockery would only increase from the band's impending American audiences on their upcoming tour.{{refn|group=n|Deborah Curtis wrote in her 1995 biography ''Touching from a Distance'' that Ian had carefully chosen the date of his suicide, stating: "I believe Ian chose his deadline. It was important for him to keep up the charade in front of the band in case they tried to dissuade him. The only reason he was no longer worried about the American trip was because he knew he wasn't going."&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, Deborah (1995). p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Lindsay Reade (the wife of the manager of Factory Records), Curtis had informed her shortly before his death of his belief that, with his epilepsy, he could no longer perform live with the band. In addition, he had claimed that with the impending release of ''Closer'', he believed the band had hit an artistic pinnacle.&lt;ref name="Uncut"/&gt; Tony Wilson later said that Curtis likely saw his act of suicide as somewhat [[Altruism|altruistic]].

In a 2013 ''[[The Guardian]]'' interview, [[Genesis P-Orridge]] spoke about being the last person Curtis spoke to before his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Simpson |first=Dave |title=Genesis P-Orridge: 'People's lives should be as interesting as their art' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/aug/29/genesis-p-orridge-throbbing-gristle |newspaper=The Guardian |date=29 August 2013 |accessdate=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bassist Peter Hook later reflected on the tragedy of the timing of Curtis's death, just before what might have been a breakthrough to fame.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Hook also claimed that, prior to the release of the 2007 [[documentary film]] ''[[Joy Division (2007 film)|Joy Division]],'' a specialist in epilepsy had viewed the combination of drugs Curtis had been prescribed for his condition, and expressed concerns about its safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wnyc.org/story/266342-peter-hook/|title=Inside Joy Division With Peter Hook|website=wnyc.org|accessdate=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Curtis's body was cremated at Macclesfield Crematorium on 23 May; his ashes were later buried at [[Macclesfield Cemetery]].

==New Order==
{{main|New Order (band)}}
Shortly after Curtis's cremation, Sumner, Hook, and Morris—strongly aided by Rob Gretton— formed a new band. Initially calling themselves "The No Names" and playing largely instrumental tracks, they soon became "New Order".&lt;ref&gt;''The Life of Ian Curtis: Torn Apart'' {{ISBN|978-0-857-12010-6}} ch. 21&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after Curtis's death, Bernard Sumner inherited the Vox Phantom VI Special guitar Ian Curtis had acquired in September 1979; he used this instrument in several early New Order songs, including the single "[[Everything's Gone Green]]".

==Tributes==
In 1985, New Order released the instrumental song "[[Elegia (New Order song)|Elegia]]", written in memory of Ian Curtis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Singh | first = Amrit | title = New Order "Elegia" | publisher = [[Stereogum]] | date = 13 April 2012 | url = http://www.stereogum.com/1000921/new-order-elegia-full-18-min-version/mp3s/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Label sharing band [[the Durutti Column]] released in 1981 their album ''[[LC (album)|LC]]'', including the Ian Curtis tribute song "The Missing Boy". In 1990, [[Psychic TV]] released "I.C. Water", a song dedicated to Curtis.

Deborah Curtis has written a biographical account of their marriage, ''Touching from a Distance'', which was first published in 1995. This biography details in part his relationship with Annik Honoré. In 1999, the post-hardcore band [[Thursday (band)|Thursday]] released a song titled "Ian Curtis" on their debut album, ''[[Waiting (Thursday album)|Waiting]]''.

The 2002 New Order song "[[Here to Stay (New Order song)|Here to Stay]]" was dedicated to Ian Curtis, Rob Gretton and [[Martin Hannett]]. Authors Mick Middles and Lindsay Reade released the book ''Torn Apart: The Life of Ian Curtis'' in 2006. This biography takes a more intimate look at Curtis and includes photographs from personal family albums and excerpts from his letters to Honoré during their relationship. Music journalist Paul Morley wrote ''Joy Division, Piece by Piece, writing about Joy Division 1977–2007''; it was published in late 2007. The book documents all of his writings and reviews about Joy Division, from their formation until Tony Wilson's death.

The words "Ian Curtis Lives" are written on a wall in Wallace Street, [[Wellington]], New Zealand. The message, which appeared shortly after the singer's death in 1980, is repainted whenever it is painted over. A nearby wall on the same street on 4 January 2005 was originally emblazoned "Ian Curtis RIP", later modified to read "Ian Curtis RIP Walk in Silence" along with the incorrect dates "1960–1980".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Wallace+Street+in+Wellington,+New+Zealand,&amp;ll=-41.303651,174.775392&amp;spn=0.000997,0.002336&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hnear=Wallace+St,+Mt+Cook,+Wellington,+New+Zealand&amp;gl=uk&amp;t=h&amp;z=19&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=-41.303651,174.774881&amp;panoid=5i7hhiJQRKOvGAPBSV519w&amp;cbp=12,241.88,,0,14.02|title=Wallace Street, Wellington on Google Maps|publisher=[[Google Maps]]|accessdate=17 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both are referred to as "The Ian Curtis Wall".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Steve McKinlay |url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/28643192@N00/1998098614/ |title=Mother, I tried, please believe me |website=[[Flickr]] |date=5 January 2005 |accessdate=25 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 September 2009, the wall was painted over by Wellington City Council's anti-graffiti team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/2857052/Killjoy-division-cleans-up-Ian-Curtis-wall |title=Killjoy division cleans up 'Ian Curtis wall' |first=Kelly|last=Burns |publisher=[[Fairfax Media]]|website=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |date=12 September 2009 |accessdate=30 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wall was chalked back up on 16 September 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/2872027/Wellington-punk-art-wall-rises-again |title=Wellington punk art wall rises again |publisher=Fairfax Media|website=Stuff.co.nz |date=17 September 2009 |accessdate=30 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wall was repainted on 17 September 2009, and has been removed and repainted on and off.

In 2012, Curtis was among the [[Culture of the United Kingdom|British cultural icons]] selected by artist [[Peter Blake (artist)|Peter Blake]] to appear in a new version of the Beatles' ''[[Sgt.

==Film portrayals==
Curtis was portrayed by [[Sean Harris]] in the 2002 film ''[[24 Hour Party People]]'', which dramatised the rise and fall of Factory Records from the 1970s to the 1990s. In 2007, a British Ian Curtis biographical film entitled ''[[Control (2007 film)|Control]]'' was released. This film was largely based upon Deborah Curtis's book ''Touching from a Distance''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/film/mubi/Control/|title=Taking Control: Telling the Ian Curtis Story|access-date=26 July 2017|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was directed by the Dutch rock photographer and music video director [[Anton Corbijn]], who had previously photographed the band and directed the video for their single "[[Atmosphere (Joy Division song)|Atmosphere]]". Deborah Curtis and Tony Wilson were executive producers, while Todd Eckert of Clara Flora was the producer. [[Sam Riley]], the lead singer of the band [[10,000 Things]], portrays Curtis, while [[Samantha Morton]] plays his wife, Deborah.

''Control'' was debuted at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] on 17 May 2007, and took three awards at the [[Directors' Fortnight]]. ''Control'' portrays Curtis's secondary school romance with Deborah, their marriage, his problems balancing his domestic life with his rise to fame, his struggles with both his major depressive issues and his poorly medicated epilepsy, and his later relationship with Annik Honoré.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://joydivision-neworder.blogspot.com.au/2011/02/ian-curtis-and-annik-honore-dazzling.html|title=Joy Division Bootlegs: "Ian Curtis and Annik Honoré - the Dazzling History of Joy Division"|first=Joy|last=Division|date=1 February 2011|website=joydivision-neworder.blogspot.com.au|accessdate=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurekastreet.com.au/article.aspx?aeid=3698 |title=Biopic avoids venerating troubled artist antihero |author=Tim Kroenert |work=Eureka Street|date=31 October 2007 |accessdate=31 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==77 Barton Street==
In 2014, the house in which Curtis committed suicide went on sale. Upon hearing this news, a fan initiated a campaign via [[Indiegogo]] to raise funds to purchase the house with intentions to preserve the property as a  museum to Ian Curtis and Joy Division.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/ian-curtis-museum#/|title=Ian Curtis Museum|publisher=[[Indiegogo]]|accessdate=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign only raised £2,000 out of the intended final goal £150,000. The money raised was later donated to [[Epilepsy Society|the Epilepsy Society]] and [[Mind (charity)|MIND]] charities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/ian-curtis-museum#/updates|title=Ian Curtis Museum (Updates)|publisher=Indiegogo|accessdate=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon hearing of the failure of this project, an entrepreneur and musician named Hadar Goldman purchased the property; offering to pay a £75,000 compensation fee on top of the requested house price of £125,000 in order to secure the purchase of 77 Barton Street and thus reverse the transacted sale from a private purchaser, which at the time was already in progress.&lt;ref name="Jonze"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/shortcuts/2015/oct/04/ian-curtis-house-joy-division-museum |title=The man who bought Ian Curtis's house: 'Joy Division is the modern Rembrandt' |last=Jonze |first=Tim |date=4 October 2015 |newspaper=The Guardian |issn=0261-3077 |accessdate=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Justifying his decision, Goldman stated he intended the property to act as a Joy Division museum, and as a digital hub to support musicians and other artists worldwide.&lt;ref name="Jonze"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/joy-division-fan-to-turn-ian-curtis-home-into-museum-20150521 |title=Joy Division Fan to Turn Ian Curtis's Home into Museum |last=Blistein |first=Jon |newspaper=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=21 May 2015 |accessdate=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/may/21/joy-division-fan-plans-museum-after-buying-former-home-of-ian-curtis|title=

'''Joe Arridy''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|r|ɪ|d|i}}; April 29, 1915 – January 6, 1939)&lt;ref name="Begging Joe's pardon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Arridy"/&gt; was a mentally disabled 23-year-old who was falsely accused of the [[rape]] and murder of a 15-year-old schoolgirl in [[Pueblo, Colorado]]. He was put to death on January 6, 1939. Arridy was officially pardoned in 2011 (72 years after his death) as evidence proved he was coerced into confession. The evidence was provided by then Colorado Governor [[Bill Ritter]], a former district attorney, after research had shown that Arridy was likely not in Pueblo when the crime happened and had been coerced into confessing.&lt;ref name="miamiherald"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2011/01/07/2005435/disabled-man-executed-in-1939.html|title=Disabled man executed in 1939 pardoned in Colorado|last=|first=|date=|work=|publisher=Miami Herald|agency=Associated Press|via=|accessdate=8 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Youth confesses attacking girls"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=IMgxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=yOIFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2587,5102878&amp;dq=dorothy+drain&amp;hl=en|title=Youth confesses attacking girls|date=August 27, 1936|work=Reading Eagle|accessdate=10 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Governor pardons Joe Arridy"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chieftain.com/article_2fd30eb6-1aa0-11e0-b0d0-001cc4c002e0.html |title=Governor pardons Joe Arridy |last=Strescino |first=Peter |date=January 7, 2011 |work=Pueblo Chieftain |accessdate=9 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110110051742/http://www.chieftain.com/article_2fd30eb6-1aa0-11e0-b0d0-001cc4c002e0.html |archivedate=January 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Arridy was born in [[Pueblo, Colorado]], to Henry and Mary Arridy, a family who emigrated from [[Syria]] to Pueblo.&lt;ref name="Arridy"/&gt; Arridy was admitted to the State Home and Training School for Mental Defectives in Grand Junction, where he spent most of his life. He was often mistreated and beaten by his peers. He left the institution and moved to the railyard in August 1936.&lt;ref name="Begging Joe's pardon" /&gt;

==Arrest and conviction==
On August 26, 1936, Arridy was arrested in [[Cheyenne, Wyoming]], after being caught wandering around the railyards. The arrest threw Arridy in a large ongoing investigation into the rape and murder of a Pueblo schoolgirl. Arridy caught the attention of the sheriff in charge, George Carroll, when Arridy revealed that he had come through Pueblo by way of a train while on the run from [[Grand Junction, Colorado]]. Prior to notification by the sheriff in Cheyenne, Wyoming, Pueblo had already arrested Frank Aguilar as the prime suspect when Sheriff George Carroll contacted the sheriff in Pueblo and claimed that Arridy told him several times he had "been with a man named Frank" at the crime scene.&lt;ref name="Sorry, Joe"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.csindy.com/colorado/sorry-joe/Content?oid=1138717|title=Sorry, Joe|date=June 7, 2007|publisher=Colorado Springs Independent|accessdate=8 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joe gave several versions of the murder in multiple confessions-the first was that a club was used in the murder. This later changed when the authorities found an axe at the scene and he later testified in interviews that he used an axe. When the case was finally brought to trial his lawyer did not try to fight the allegations and instead sought reprieve through a plea of insanity. Arridy was convicted even though there was a lack of hard evidence which included the sisters' testimony that Frank Aguilar had been present and not Arridy and the determination he was an [[imbecile]] with an [[IQ]] score of 46 by three state psychiatrists who agreed that Arridy was "incapable of distinguishing between right and wrong, and therefore, would be unable to perform any action with a criminal intent."&lt;ref name="Begging Joe's pardon"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.5280.com/magazine/2008/10/crime-begging-joes-pardon|title=Begging Joe's pardon|date=October 2008|publisher=5280|accessdate=8 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Arridy"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.friendsofjoearridy.com/Joe.html| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120731143412/http://friendsofjoearridy.com/Joe.html|archivedate= 2012-07-31  | quote=With the mind of a six-year-old, Joe went to the gas chamber, smiling |title=Arridy |last=Warden|first=Rob |accessdate=9 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Colorado governor pardons man executed for murder in 1939"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20110107/us_nm/us_pardon_colorado_posthumous|title=Colorado governor pardons man executed for murder in 1939|date=Jan 7, 2011|publisher=Associated Press|accessdate=8 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Execution==
Arridy was known for spending his time on death row playing with a toy train, given to him by prison warden Roy Best, who called Arridy "the happiest prisoner on death row." He was liked by both the prisoners and guards. His execution was commented on by Best: "He probably didn't even know he was about to die, all he did was happily sit and play with a toy train I had given him."&lt;ref name="Begging Joe's pardon" /&gt; He received nine stays of execution while the man who was arrested before him, Frank Aguilar, was executed nearly two years earlier. For his last meal, he requested [[ice cream]]. When questioned about his impending execution he showed "blank bewilderment"&lt;ref name="Happiest Man in death cell dies in chair"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ZBNPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=UE0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5344,828657&amp;dq=dorothy+drain&amp;hl=en|title="Happiest Man" in death cell dies in chair|date=Jan 7, 1939|work=St. Petersburg Times|accessdate=10 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was clear that he did not realize the meaning of the gas chamber, telling the warden "No, no, Joe won't die."&lt;ref name="Condemned Prisoner to give train to another slayer"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=bR4qAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=84cFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2344,697682&amp;dq=dorothy+drain&amp;hl=en|title=Condemned Prisoner to give train to another slayer|date=Jan 5, 1939|work=Reading Eagle|accessdate=10 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was reported to have smiled while being taken to the gas chamber and was only momentarily nervous until the warden grabbed his hand and reassured him.&lt;ref name="Happiest Man in death cell dies in chair" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Joe Arridy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccpl.lib.co.us/History_Old/Prisons/ArridyJoe.html|title=Joe Arridy|last=Andersen|first=Dianna|publisher=Canon City Public Library|accessdate=9 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2290">'''John Wentworth Jr.''' (July 17, 1745 – January 10, 1787) was a lawyer who served as a delegate to the [[Continental Congress]] for [[New Hampshire]] and a signer of the [[Articles of Confederation]].

==Biography==
He was born to [[John Wentworth (judge)|Judge John Wentworth]] in [[Somersworth, New Hampshire]] in 1745, and is a descendant of "Elder" [[William Wentworth (elder)|William Wentworth]]. He graduated from [[Harvard University|Harvard]] in 1768 before studying law. He moved to [[Dover, New Hampshire]] where he started his practice. His cousin, [[John Wentworth (governor)|Governor Wentworth]], appointed him the probate register for [[Strafford County, New Hampshire|Strafford County]], and he held that post until his death.

He was active in the various revolutionary committees, and was elected to the convention (later the State Assembly) from Dover every year from 1776 to 1780. He was a member of the state council, supporting [[Meshech Weare]], from 1780 to 1784, and was a member of the [[Committee of Safety (American Revolution)|New Hampshire Committee of Safety]]. That committee operated as the revolutionary government when the Assembly was not in session.

In 1778 and 1779, he was selected as one of the delegates to the Continental Congress. His term of service gave him the chance to sign the Articles of Confederation when the Congress passed that plan to unify the colonies. As New Hampshire established a more stable government, he was elected to the State's Senate from 1784 to 1786. He died in Dover and is buried in the [[Pine Hill Cemetery (Dover, New Hampshire)|Pine Hill Cemetery]] there.&lt;ref&gt;{{FAG|7084386}}&lt;/ref&gt; His wife and seven children survived him.

'''Karl Hess''' (born '''Carl Hess III'''; May 25, 1923 – April 22, 1994) was an [[Americans|American]] [[speechwriter]] and author. He was also a [[Political philosophy|political philosopher]], [[Editing|editor]], [[welder]], [[motorcycle racer]], [[tax resister]], [[Atheism|atheist]], and [[Libertarianism in the United States|libertarian]] activist. His career included stints on the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Right-wing politics|right]] and the [[New Left]] before embracing [[free-market anarchism]].&lt;ref&gt;Hess, Karl. [http://fare.tunes.org/books/Hess/dop.html ''The Death of Politics''], Interview in [[Playboy]], July 1976&lt;/ref&gt; Later in life, he summed up his role in the economy by remarking "I am by occupation a free marketer (crafts and ideas, woodworking, welding, and writing)."{{sfn|Hess|1999}}

==Early life==
Hess was born '''Carl Hess III'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mises.org/library/karl-hess-and-death-politics|title=Karl Hess and the Death of Politics|last=Riggenbach|first=Jeff|publisher=mises.org|date=May 23, 2010|accessdate=February 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Washington, D.C.]] and moved to the [[Philippines]] as a child. His parents were of German and Spanish ancestry. When his mother discovered his father's marital infidelity, she divorced her wealthy husband and returned (with Karl) to Washington. She refused [[alimony]] or child support and took a job as a telephone operator, raising her son in very modest circumstances.{{sfn|Hess|1999}}

Karl's mother encouraged curiosity and direct learning.  She often insisted that Karl figure things out for himself, or increase his knowledge through reading.  Karl, believing (as his mother did) that [[public education]] was a waste of time, rarely attended school; to evade [[truancy]] officers, he registered at every elementary school in town and gradually withdrew from each one, making it impossible for the authorities to know exactly where he was supposed to be.  He had developed great reverence for libraries; this became very basic to his personal philosophy, and in his autobiography he wrote: "Literacy is the basic tool in the workshop of the entire world."{{sfn|Hess|1999}}

As a young person, Karl played tennis, learned marksmanship, and pursued fencing. Later on he learned gunsmithing. He officially dropped out at 15 and went to work for the [[Mutual Broadcasting System]] as a newswriter at the invitation of Walter Compton, a Mutual news commentator who resided in the building where Mrs. Hess operated the switchboard. Hess continued to work in the news media, and by age 18 was assistant city editor of ''[[The Washington Daily News]]''{{sfn|Hess|1999}}

Early during the Second World War, Hess enlisted in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] in 1942, but was discharged when they discovered he had contracted [[malaria]] in the Philippines.{{sfn|Hess|1999}}

He was later an editor for ''[[Newsweek]]'' and ''The Fisherman.'' He worked as a staff writer, and sometimes as a freelancer, for a number of anti-Communist periodicals. In the 1950s he worked for the Champion Papers and Fibre Company. He was dismayed that people in the management portion of the corporate world seemed more interested in personal advancement than in doing good work. At Champion his bosses encouraged him to get involved in [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] politics for the company's benefit. In doing so he met [[Arizona]] [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Barry Goldwater]] and many other prominent Republicans, thus beginning the GOP epoch of his life.{{sfn|Hess|1999}}

In his book ''Dear America,'' Hess wrote that he became an [[atheism|atheist]] because his temporary job as a coroner's assistant when he was 15 left him convinced that people were simply flesh-and-blood beings with no afterlife. Consequently, he stopped attending church (he had been a devout [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]]). Years later, while on leave from Champion and working for the [[American Enterprise Institute]] (AEI), he resumed attending church because virtually all of his AEI colleagues did so. His return merely reinforced his atheism; on one Sunday morning, while enduring a service as his young son sat on his lap, Hess became disgusted with himself for exposing his child to an institution he himself had rejected.

==Political activities==
{{Anarchism sidebar}}
Hess was the primary author of the Republican Party's 1960 and 1964 [[Party platform|platforms]]. In the lead-up to the 1964 presidential election, Hess worked closely with [[Barry Goldwater]]. He came to view Goldwater as a man of sterling character, a conservative holding a number of significant libertarian convictions. Hess worked as a speechwriter, and explored [[ideology]] and [[politics]]. He was widely considered to be the author of the renowned Goldwater line, "Extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice; moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue," but revealed that he had encountered it in a letter from [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]] historian [[Harry Jaffa]] and later learned it was a paraphrase of a passage from [[Cicero]].{{sfn|Hess|1999|pp. 168–70}} He later called this his "[[Cold Warrior]]" phase.

Following the [[United States presidential election, 1964|1964 presidential campaign]] in which [[Lyndon Johnson]] trounced Goldwater, Hess became disillusioned with traditional politics and became more radical. Hess and others on the losing team had found themselves outsiders within the national Republican party because of their support of the controversial Goldwater. Hess felt that he had been purged by the Republicans and he departed from involvement with grand-scale politics altogether.

In 1965 Hess took up motorcycle riding. His need to occasionally repair his motorcycles led to his interest in welding (which he learned at Bell Vocational School). Welding skills gave him something he could trade upon. Initially, he set up a commercial partnership, with a fellow Bell graduate, doing on-site industrial welding. Eventually, his skill led to an involvement with welded-metal sculpture.

All of this unfolded around the same time as his divorce from his first wife. Hess hereafter publicly criticized big business, suburban American hypocrisy and the [[military-industrial complex]]. Though well beyond college age, Hess joined [[Students for a Democratic Society (1960 organization)|Students for a Democratic Society]], worked with the [[Black Panther Party]] and protested the [[Vietnam War]].{{sfn|Hess|1999}}

After his work on the Goldwater campaign, Hess was audited by the [[Internal Revenue Service]], which he believed was in retaliation for his support of the losing candidate. In response, he sent the IRS a copy of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] with a letter saying that he would never again pay taxes. Hess claimed that the IRS then threatened to put a lien on all of his property and 100% of his future earnings. He was supported financially thereafter by his wife and used [[barter]] to keep himself busy.&lt;ref&gt;Gross, David (ed.) ''We Won't Pay!: A Tax Resistance Reader'' {{ISBN|1-4348-9825-3}} pp. 437–41&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=July 2017}}

In 1968, [[Richard Nixon]] was elected president and Barry Goldwater went to Washington as [[Arizona]]'s junior senator. Hess, despite now being a member of the New Left, had recently written some speeches for Goldwater and resumed their close personal relationship; he had concluded that American men should not be forced into military service and urged Goldwater to submit legislation abolishing [[conscription]]. Goldwater replied, "Well, let's wait and see what Dick Nixon wants to do about that one." Hess despised Nixon almost as much as he admired Goldwater and could not tolerate the notion that Goldwater would defer to Nixon. Thus ended one of Hess's closest professional associations, and the situation significantly compromised one of his deepest friendships. (Nixon abolished conscription during his presidency, with Goldwater's support.)

Hess began reading American [[anarchism|anarchists]] largely because of the recommendations of his friend [[Murray Rothbard]]. Hess said that upon reading the works of [[Emma Goldman]] he discovered that anarchists believed everything he had hoped the Republican Party would represent, and that Goldman was the source for the best and most essential theories of [[Ayn Rand]] without any of the "crazy [[solipsism]] that Rand was so fond of."

From 1969 to 1971, Hess edited ''[[The Libertarian Forum]]'' with Rothbard.

Hess had come to put his focus on the small scale, on community. He said, "Society is: people together making culture." He deemed two of his cardinal social principles to be "opposition to central political authority" and "concern for people as individuals." His rejection of standard American [[party politics]] was reflected in a lecture he gave during which he said, "The Democrats or [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberals]] think that everybody is stupid and therefore they need somebody... to tell them how to behave themselves. The Republicans think everybody is lazy..."&lt;ref&gt;Halle, Roland; and Ladue, Peter (1980) ''Karl Hess: Toward Liberty.'' Direct Cinema, Ltd.  [M16 2824 K]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969 and 1970, Hess joined with others, including Murray Rothbard, [[Robert LeFevre]], [[Dana Rohrabacher]], [[Samuel Edward Konkin III]], and former [[Students for a Democratic Society (1960 organization)|Students for a Democratic Society]] (SDS) leader [[Carl Oglesby]] to speak at two "left-right" conferences which brought together activists from both the [[Old Right (United States)|Old Right]] and the [[New Left]] in what was emerging as a nascent [[Libertarianism in the United States|libertarian]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/19990429142502/http://www.loop.com/~sek3/nl/history.html Libertarian History]&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=July 2017}}

As part of his effort to unite right and [[left-libertarianism]], Hess would join the SDS as well as the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW), of which he explained, "We used to have a labor movement in this country, until I.W.W. leaders were killed or imprisoned. You could tell labor unions had become captive when business and government began to praise them. They're destroying the militant black leaders the same way now. If the slaughter continues, before long liberals will be asking, 'What happened to the blacks? Why aren't they militant anymore?'"&lt;ref&gt;[http://fare.tunes.org/books/Hess/from_far_right_to_far_left.html ''From Far Right to Far Left– and Farther– With Karl Hess''] by James Boyd: 1970 ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, Hess joined the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]], which was founded in 1971 and served as editor of its newspaper from 1986 to 1990.

==Adams-Morgan experiment and back-to-the-land==
Hess was an early proponent of the "[[Back-to-the-land movement|back to the land]]" movement, and his focus on self-reliance and small communities happened in part by government mandate. According to a ''Libertarian Party News'' obituary, "When the Internal Revenue Service confiscated all his property and put a 100 percent [[lien]] on all of his future earnings, Hess (who had taught himself welding) existed on bartering his work for food and goods."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lp.org/lpn/9406-Hess.html |title=LP News Jun 94 – Karl Hess: 1923–1994 |accessdate=2003-09-29 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051115021846/http://www.lp.org/lpn/9406-Hess.html |archivedate=November 15, 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=July 2017}}

Hess's life as a welder put him in rapport with a very large segment of the American population who are manual laborers. He eventually came to the conviction that virtually no one in national politics identified with these people anymore. Hess's revolt against public giantism reflected a distrust toward large-corporate business as well as big government.  After Hess had made friends within the New Left and related circles, he began to encounter the young, new-breed [[appropriate technology]] enthusiasts&lt;ref name="Halle, Roland 1980"&gt;Halle, Roland; and Ladue, Peter (1980)&lt;/ref&gt; (exemplified, by the early 1970s, in the editors and readerships of the ''[[Whole Earth Catalog]]'' and ''[[Mother Earth News]]'').

In the early 1970s, Hess became involved in an experiment with several friends and colleagues to bring self-built and -managed [[technology]] into the direct service of the economic and social life of the poor, largely [[African American]] neighborhood of [[Adams-Morgan]] in [[Washington, D.C.]].  It was the neighborhood in which Hess had spent his childhood. Afterward, Hess wrote a book entitled ''[[Community Technology]]'' which told the story of this experiment and its results.  According to Hess, the residents had a vigorous go at participatory democracy, and the neighborhood seemed for a time like a fertile ground for the growth of community identity and capability.

Much of the technological experimentation Hess and others engaged in there was successful in technical terms (apparatus was built, food raised, [[solar energy]] captured, etc.). For instance, Hess wrote: "In one experiment undertaken by the author and associates, an inner-city basement space, roughly thirty by fifty feet, was sufficient to house plywood tanks in which rainbow trout were produced at a cost of less than a dollar per pound.  In a regular production run the total number of fish that can be raised in such a basement area was projected to be five tons per year."&lt;ref&gt;Hess, Karl (1979) ''Community Technology''.  New York: Harper &amp; Row, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; He taught courses and lectured on Appropriate Technology and Social Change in this period at the [[Institute for Social Ecology]] in Vermont. Nonetheless, the Adams-Morgan neighborhood, continuing on what he felt was a path of social deterioration and real-estate gentrification, declined to devote itself to expanding on the technology. Hence, in his view, a needy community got little value from the application of viable technology.

Subsequently, Hess and his wife, Therese, moved to rural [[Opequon Creek]] between [[Martinsburg, West Virginia|Martinsburg]] and [[Kearneysville, West Virginia]], where he set up a welding shop as partial support for his household. He became deeply involved with local affairs there.  Hess built an affordable house that relied largely on [[passive solar building design|passive-solar heating]], and took an interest in wind power and all forms of solar energy. The house they built was a 2000 sq. ft. sun-warmed, earth-sheltered structure – constructed mostly using their own labor, and at  cost of just $10,000 (mid-1970s dollars). They acquired most of the tools needed for the construction, and the appliances needed for a comfortable modern life, second-hand.{{sfn|Hess|1999}} By the late 1970s, Hess saw solar energy as emblematic of decentralization and nuclear energy as emblematic of central organization.&lt;ref name="Halle, Roland 1980"/&gt;

Hess wrote for a [[Survivalism|survivalist]] newsletter  titled ''Personal Survival ("P.S.") Letter,'' which was published from 1977 to 1982.  It was first published and edited by [[Mel Tappan]]. In the same time period, Hess authored the book ''A Common Sense Strategy for Survivalists''.

Hess ran a symbolic campaign for [[Governor of West Virginia]] in 1992. When asked by a reporter what his first act would be if elected, he quipped, "I will demand an immediate recount."

==Legacy==
In a [[Reuters]] online "Opinion" piece, in 2012, New Yorker Maureen Tkacik asserted that Karl Hess was the ideological grandfather of  the anti-1% movement – making Hess the direct antecedent of thinkers like [[Ron Paul]] and both the [[Tea Party movement]] and the [[Occupy movement]].  She cites the detailed argument Hess, in his libertarian phase, put forward in his book ''Dear America'' to delineate and decry the extreme concentration of power in the hands of a tiny financial and stock-holding elite.  Tkacik quotes passages from Hess's book to offer proof that Hess developed the language of the 1% versus the 99% (the former being those whose role, according to Hess, is demonstrably detrimental to the vast majority of Americans).&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.reuters.com/great-debate/2012/09/20/the-radical-right-wing-roots-of-occupy-wall-street/ » Tkacik, Maureen  September 20, 2012  "The radical right-wing roots of Occupy Wall Street", access date 2013-03-09 ; published by Reuters, Edition U.S&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1990, Rutkowski established ''KenRadio Broadcasting'', a daily technology podcast focused on the [[high tech]] industry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kenradio.com/content/view/10/25/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100810191311/http://www.kenradio.com/content/view/10/25/ |date=August 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commnexus.org/programs/gadgetfest-2009-emcees-judges.php ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091003121733/http://www.commnexus.org/programs/gadgetfest-2009-emcees-judges.php |date=October 3, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1995, Rutkowski's daily talk show, "The World Technology Roundup," has also focused on high tech business worldwide.

In January 2003, Rutkowski founded Media Entertainment Technology Alpha Leaders (METal). The group aims to provide members with a variety of opportunities, intellectual interests, and support mechanisms built on shared values across the media, entertainment and technology space.

In 2005, Rutkowski received a Digital Entertainment Award for his activity in new media and emerging technologies.

In 2006, he moderated panels at the [[Milken Institute]] Global Conference in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.milkeninstitute.org/events/gcprogram.taf?function=detail&amp;eventid=GC06&amp;EvID=708 |title=Milken Institute Panel Detail |accessdate=2010-03-21 |publisher=Milken Institute |date=April 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.milkeninstitute.org/events/gcprogram.taf?function=bio&amp;EventID=GC06&amp;SPID=2271 |title=Ken Rutkowski's Bio on Milken Institute Global Conference |accessdate=2010-03-21 |publisher=Milken Institute |date=April 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned for another Global Conference in 2015 as a speaker.

Since July 2009, Rutkowski has been a board member at Opportunity Green, an event that addresses innovation opportunities for  industry leaders and thought leaders in pursuing sustainable business solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://techzulu.com/ken-rutkowski-launches-business-rockstars-academy/ |title=Ken Rutkowski Launches Business Rockstars Academy - TechZuluTechZulu |publisher=Techzulu.com |date= |accessdate=2015-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.opportunitygreen.com/board-of-advisors.php |title=Board of Advisors &amp;#124; Green Business Conference 2010 &amp;#124; Los Angeles |publisher=Opportunitygreen.com |date= |accessdate=2015-11-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160130181222/http://www.opportunitygreen.com/board-of-advisors.php# |archive-date=2016-01-30 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2009, Rutkowski was named an [[intelligence analyst]] at the [[Oprah Winfrey]] Network, where he created research analysis focused on identifying and providing updates on people, companies, events, technologies, trends, and conferences relevant to the [[Oprah Winfrey Network (U.S. TV channel)|Oprah Winfrey Network]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://metnet.sg/?page_id=115 ]{{dead link|date=November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/buffalo/print-edition/2013/09/13/whats-up-with-that-kent-rutkowski.html?page=all |title=What's up with that: Ken Rutkowski |date=September 13, 2013 |publisher=Bizjournals.com |accessdate=2015-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; He concluded this occupation in 2012 when the network lost three hundred thirty million dollars and could no longer afford a surplus of workers.

In January 2010, Rutkowski became a partner and analyst in innovation and social media at Free Form, a media company that translates "potent thinking into stories that move people." Rutkowski has been a guest lecturer at various universities including [[Loyola University Chicago|Loyola University]], [[Northwestern University]], and [[the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]].

==2016 Cyber Party vice-presidential candidacy==
Rutkowski was briefly the [[Vice President of the United States|vice-presidential]] nominee of the now-defunct Cyber Party in the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 U.S. presidential election]], [[running mate|running alongside]] [[software]] [[entrepreneur]] [[John McAfee]].&lt;ref name="cyberVP"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ballot-access.org/2015/11/21/cyber-party-chooses-vice-presidential-nominee/ | title=Cyber Party Chooses Vice-Presidential Nominee | work=[[Ballot Access News]] | date=November 21, 2015 | accessdate=November 23, 2015 | author=[[Richard Winger|Winger, Richard]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; McAfee chose in December 2015 to instead switch to seeking the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian]] nomination, but Rutkowski did not join him in seeking the Libertarian vice-presidential nomination.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2015/12/24/mcafee-run-libertarian-party-candidate-president/77877980/&lt;/ref&gt; McAfee later selected photographer Judd Weiss as his Libertarian running mate, but neither were nominated at the [[2016 Libertarian National Convention]].

'''Larry Lardner''', a native of [[Athenry]], [[County Galway]], was a Brigade Commandant for the [[Irish Republican Army]] in his locality'''bold'''. He was by trade a  [[publican]] and a member of the [[Irish Republican Brotherhood]] (IRB) Supreme Council for [[Connacht]] in 1917. {{citation needed|date=April 2010}} He, along with [[Liam Mellows]] and [[Pádraig Ó Fathaigh]], travelled to [[Limerick]] where they were informed by [[Patrick Pearse]] at an IRB meeting that a rebellion would take place at [[Easter 1916]]. {{citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Following Ó Fathaigh's arrest, Lardner and Mellows led some hundreds of local men in occupying Moyode Castle on 26 April. Within days they were informed by a local priest that the rising had failed. He is believed to have accompanied Mellows into hiding in the [[Slieve Aughty]] for some months afterwards. {{citation needed|date=April 2010}}

In 1919 he was captured and imprisoned in [[Wormwood Scrubs]], and was one of a group of [[Irish Republican Army|I.R.A.]] men who went on hunger strike. Early in January 1920, he was part of a group of local men (including Bill Freaney) approached [[Frank Shawe-Taylor]] on behalf of some local people who were requesting a road to travel to Mass. Shawe-Taylor himself was amenable to their demands but the landlord refused via Shawe-Taylor, who was later killed. Lardner died in Athenry in April 1936. {{citation needed|date=April 2010}}

'''Lyman Eugene Johnson''' (October 24, 1811 – December 20, 1859)&lt;ref&gt;Prairie du Chien Courier 8 (December 20, 1859):3 and headstone of Lyman E. Johnson in Evergreen Cemetery, Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin.&lt;/ref&gt; was an early leader in the [[Latter Day Saint movement]] and an original member of the [[Quorum of the Twelve|Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]]. He broke with [[Joseph Smith]] and [[Sidney Rigdon]] during the 1837–38 period when [[schism]] divided the early church. Johnson later became a successful pioneer lawyer in [[Iowa]] and was one of the town fathers of [[Keokuk, Iowa]].

Johnson was born in [[Pomfret, Vermont|Pomfret]], [[Windsor County, Vermont]], to [[John Johnson (Latter Day Saints)|John Johnson]], and Alice Elsa Johnson. The family moved to [[Hiram, Ohio]], in 1818, where they established the [[John Johnson Farm]], a successful {{convert|300|acre|km2|sing=on}} farm.

Johnson died in 1859, drowning in the [[Mississippi River]] in a boating accident at [[Prairie du Chien]], [[Wisconsin]]. He had at least five children.

==Involvement in the Latter Day Saint movement==

===Early contact===
[[Joseph Smith]] and [[Emma Hale Smith]] moved into the Johnson home on September 12, 1831. Within a month, Johnson was ordained an [[Elder (Mormonism)|elder]] and then a [[High Priest (Mormonism)|high priest]] of the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Latter Day Saint church]]. In response to a revelation given on January 25, 1832, Johnson joined [[Orson Pratt]] on an evangelizing mission which took them through the northeastern United States. The two were highly successful preachers and brought many converts to [[Mormonism]] on this and other subsequent missions.

===Quorum of the Twelve===
In the summer of 1834, Johnson marched with the [[Zion's Camp]] expedition which hoped to restore Latter Day Saints in [[Missouri]] to their lands in [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson County]]. Although the expedition was a failure, many of the veterans of the expedition were soon called to high leadership positions in the church. Among these were Johnson and his brother [[Luke S. Johnson|Luke]], who were among the original twelve men called on February 14, 1835, to be "Special Witnesses" or [[Apostle (Latter Day Saints)|apostles]] in a "traveling high council" of the church, later known as the Council or [[Quorum of the Twelve]]. The chief duty of the apostles was to preside over missionary activities. Johnson continued to operate as a successful missionary from 1835 to 1837. On September 4, 1834, Johnson was married to Sarah Susan Long.

===Bank failure===
The failure of the [[Kirtland Safety Society]], a bank founded by church leaders, led to widespread dissent in 1837. The church held a [[Presiding high council|high council]] trial on September 3, 1837, which ejected Johnson, his brother Luke, and [[John F. Boynton]] from the Quorum of the Twelve. Boynton explained that his difficulties with the church resulted from "the failure of the bank" which he had understood "was instituted by the will and revelations of God, and he had been told that it would never fail".&lt;ref&gt;''Kirtland Council Minute Book,'' pp.&amp;nbsp;184–86.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these difficulties, Johnson and the others temporarily reconciled with church leaders and were restored to their apostleships on September 10, 1837,&lt;ref&gt;''KCMB'', pp.&amp;nbsp;188–89&lt;/ref&gt; after which Johnson and his family moved to the Latter Day Saint settlement of [[Far West, Missouri]].

===Excommunications===
Meanwhile, schismatic strife between the loyalist faction and the dissenting faction continued to divide the church in Kirtland. The schismatic strife followed them, but in Far West, the loyalists were able to keep control by excommunicating the leadership of the Missouri church—[[David Whitmer]], [[John Whitmer]], [[W. W. Phelps (Mormon)|W. W. Phelps]]—along with [[Oliver Cowdery]], Johnson, and others. In Johnson's case, a list of seven charges were presented to him by the Far West High Council on April 9, 1838, which included the charge of "saying he would appeal the suit between him &amp; Brother Phineas Young and take it out of the County." Johnson replied on April 12 that "I should not condescend to put my constitutional rights at issue upon so disrespectful a point, as to answer any of those other charges until that is withdrawn &amp; until then shall withdraw myself from your society and fellowship."&lt;ref&gt;''Far West Record'', 173–76.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Menaye School of Hope ===
The school was founded on 7 September 2000 in the central region of [[Ghana]]. Menaye Donkor adopted the school in 2004 after winning Miss Universe Ghana to help build a better environment for the children as the original school lacked in basic necessities.

The school is located in Agona Asafo, which is considered one of the most deprived regions of the country, with high poverty and extreme illiteracy rates. Having started with 78 pupils sharing one school block, the school now has over 400 children and three blocks, helping students achieve excellent results in their [[BECE]] (pre-secondary school) examinations. The Menaye Charity Organisation funds everything for the school, from the buildings and equipment to the teachers’ salaries, as well as uniforms, books and stationery.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

At Harvard, Kinsley served as vice president of the university's daily newspaper, ''[[The Harvard Crimson]]''. He was awarded a [[Rhodes Scholarship]] and studied at [[Magdalen College, Oxford|Magdalen College]], [[Oxford University|Oxford]], then returned to Harvard for law school.

== Early career ==
While still a third-year law student, Kinsley began working at ''[[The New Republic]]''. He was allowed to finish his Harvard [[juris doctor]] degree through courses at the evening program at [[The George Washington University Law School]].

Kinsley's first exposure to a national television audience was as moderator of [[William F. Buckley, Jr.|William Buckley's]] ''[[Firing Line (TV series)|Firing Line]].'' In 1979, he became editor of ''The New Republic'' and wrote the magazine's [[TRB (writer)|TRB]] column for most of the 1980s and 1990s. That column was reprinted in a variety of newspaper op-ed pages, including the ''[[Washington Post]],'' and made Kinsley's reputation as a leading political commentator.

Kinsley also served as managing editor of ''[[Washington Monthly]]'' (in the mid-1970s, while still in school), editor at ''[[Harper's]]'' (for a year and a half in the early 1980s), and American editor of ''[[The Economist]]'' (a short-term, honorary position).

==''Crossfire'' and ''Slate''==
From 1989 to 1995, Kinsley appeared on [[CNN]]'s ''[[Crossfire (U.S. TV program)|Crossfire]]'', co-hosting with conservative [[Pat Buchanan]]. Representing the [[American liberalism|liberal]] position in the televised political debates, Kinsley combined a dry wit with [[nerd]]y demeanor and analytical skills.

In January 1995, Kinsley had a cameo on the first episode of the TV sitcom ''[[Women of the House]]'', in which the show's main character, Suzanne Sugarbaker, was a guest on ''[[Crossfire (U.S. TV program)|Crossfire]]''. He also appeared in three movies during the 1990s: ''[[Rising Sun (film)|Rising Sun]]'' ([[1993 in film|1993]]), ''[[Dave (film)|Dave]]'' (1993), and ''[[The Birdcage]]'' ([[1996 in film|1996]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Michael Kinsley|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0455911/|publisher=IMDB|accessdate=30 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After leaving ''Crossfire'' in 1995, Kinsley returned to his editorial roots, relocating to [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]] to become founding editor of [[Microsoft]]'s online journal, ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]''. In 1998 he was considered for the position of editor in chief of ''[[The New Yorker]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Colford|first=Paul|title=Figures Tell Grim New Yorker Story|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/jul/16/news/ls-4266|accessdate=April 12, 2014|work=Los Angeles Times|date=July 16, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shafer|first=Jack|title=I Would Have Loved To Piss on Your Shoes|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/press_box/2011/06/i_would_have_loved_to_piss_on_your_shoes.single.html|accessdate=April 12, 2014|work=Slate|date=June 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was ultimately awarded to [[David Remnick]]. In 1999 he was named Editor of the Year by the ''[[Columbia Journalism Review]]'' for his work at ''Slate''.

Kinsley stepped down from ''Slate'' in 2002, shortly after disclosing that he had [[Parkinson's disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/going-public-with-parkinsons|title=Going Public With Parkinson's|author=Staff|date=December 10, 2001|website=CBSNews.com|publisher=CBS Interactive, Inc.|accessdate=January 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsequent positions==
Kinsley next moved to the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' as editorial page editor in April 2004. He maintained his Seattle residence and often worked from there, commuting to Los Angeles on a part-time basis. During his tenure, Kinsley tried to overhaul the paper's editorial page and led an abortive experiment with a [[Wikitorial]], while also receiving criticism from [[University of Southern California|USC]] professor and [[feminist]] [[advocate]] [[Susan Estrich]] alleging a dearth of editorials written by women. Kinsley announced his departure in September 2005 after a falling out with the publisher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/13/AR2005091301668.html|work=The Washington Post|title=Michael Kinsley and the LA Times Part on 'Unfortunate Note'|first=Howard|last=Kurtz|date=September 14, 2005|accessdate=May 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He returned to writing a weekly column for ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', and in 2006 he served briefly as American editor of ''[[The Guardian]]''. He also became a regular columnist for ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, but in May 2009 wrote that the magazine had "dumped" him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tnr.com/article/politics/backward-runs-newsweek |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ney7ndsA?url=http://www.tnr.com/article/politics/backward-runs-newsweek |archivedate=February 19, 2010 |last=Kinsley |first=Michael |title=Backward Runs 'Newsweek' |work=The New Republic |date=May 21, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 9, 2010, Kinsley and [[MSNBC]] pundit [[Joe Scarborough]] joined the staff of ''[[Politico]]'' as the publication's first opinion columnists. On April 29, 2011, [[Bloomberg L.P.]] announced that Kinsley had joined the Bloomberg View editorial board. In January 2013, Kinsley re-joined ''[[The New Republic]]'' as editor at large.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/12/21/michael-kinsley-returns-new-republic-tnr-relaunch_n_2340795.html|first=Michael|last=Calderone|title=Michael Kinsley Returns to The New Republic as Editor-at-Large|work=Huffington Post|date=December 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2014, ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' announced that Kinsley would become a contributing editor and write a monthly column.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/online/daily/2014/01/michael-kinsley-columnist-vanity-fair|title=Michael Kinsley Named Columnist for Vanity Fair by Graydon Carter|work=Vanity Fair|date=January 19, 2014|accessdate=February 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal==
In 2002 Kinsley married [[Patty Stonesifer]], a longtime top executive at [[Microsoft]] and the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]]. (As a Microsoft vice president, she had managed the Microsoft news portion of the [[MSNBC]] merger, which included ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]''.) Stonesifer has two adult children from a previous marriage. She is currently president and CEO of [[Martha's Table]], a non-profit that develops sustainable solutions to poverty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Leadership|url=http://marthastable.org/about/leadership-marthas-table/|publisher=Martha's Table|accessdate=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 Kinsley revealed that he had [[Parkinson's disease]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1828325,00.html|work=Time|title=The Audacity of Bill Gates|date=July 31, 2008|accessdate=May 12, 2010|first=Michael|last=Kinsley}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on July 12, 2006, he underwent [[deep brain stimulation]], a type of surgery designed to reduce its symptoms. According to a humorous postscript to his ''Time'' column anticipating the surgery, the operation went well; Kinsley's first words out of the operating room were "Well, of course, when you cut taxes, government revenues go up. Why couldn't I see that before?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1214919,00.html|work=Time|title=Yes, It Really Is Brain Surgery|date=July 16, 2006|accessdate=May 12, 2010|first=Michael|last=Kinsley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Miles Dewey Davis III''' (May 26, 1926{{spaced ndash}}September 28, 1991) was an American jazz [[trumpet]]er, bandleader, and composer. He is among the most influential and acclaimed figures in the [[history of jazz]] and 20th century music. Davis adopted a variety of musical directions in a five-decade career that kept him at the forefront of many major stylistic developments in jazz.&lt;ref name="allmusic"/&gt;

Born and raised in [[Illinois]], Davis left his studies at the [[Juilliard School]] in [[New York City]] and made his professional debut as a member of [[saxophone|saxophonist]] [[Charlie Parker]]'s [[bebop]] quintet from 1944 to 1948. Shortly after, he recorded the ''[[Birth of the Cool]]'' sessions for [[Capitol Records]], which were instrumental to the development of cool jazz. In the early 1950s, Davis recorded some of the earliest [[hard bop]] music while on [[Prestige Records]] but did so haphazardly due to a [[heroin]] addiction. After a widely acclaimed comeback performance at the [[Newport Jazz Festival]] in 1955, he signed a long-term contract with [[Columbia Records]] and recorded the 1957 album ''[['Round About Midnight]]''.{{sfn|Yanow|2005|p=176}} It was his first work with saxophonist [[John Coltrane]] and bassist [[Paul Chambers]], key members of the sextet he led into the early 1960s. During this period, he alternated between orchestral jazz collaborations with arranger [[Gil Evans]], such as the Spanish-influenced ''[[Sketches of Spain]]'' (1960), and band recordings, such as ''[[Milestones (Miles Davis album)|Milestones]]'' (1958) and ''[[Kind of Blue]]'' (1959).&lt;ref name="aar"/&gt; The latter recording remains one of the most popular jazz albums of all time,{{sfn|McCurdy|2004|p=61}} having sold over four million copies in the U.S.

Davis made several line-up changes while recording ''[[Someday My Prince Will Come (Miles Davis album)|Someday My Prince Will Come]]'' (1961), his [[In Person Friday and Saturday Nights at the Blackhawk, Complete|1961 Blackhawk concerts]], and ''[[Seven Steps to Heaven]]'' (1963), another mainstream success that introduced bassist [[Ron Carter]], pianist [[Herbie Hancock]], and drummer [[Tony Williams (drummer)|Tony Williams]].&lt;ref name="aar"/&gt; After adding saxophonist [[Wayne Shorter]] to his new quintet in 1964,&lt;ref name="aar"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aaregistry.org/historic_events/view/miles-davis-innovative-influential-and-respected-jazz-legend|title=Miles Davis, innovative, influential, and respected jazz legend|publisher=African American Registry|accessdate=June 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Davis led them on a series of more abstract recordings often composed by the band members, helping pioneer the [[post-bop]] genre with albums such as ''[[E.S.P. (Miles Davis album)|E.S.P]]'' (1965) and ''[[Miles Smiles]]'' (1967),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bailey|first=C.

During the 1970s, he  experimented with rock, funk, [[Rhythm in Sub-Saharan Africa|African rhythms]], emerging [[Music technology (electronic and digital)|electronic music technology]], and an ever-changing line-up of musicians, including keyboardist [[Joe Zawinul]], drummer [[Al Foster]], and guitarist [[John McLaughlin (musician)|John McLaughlin]].{{sfn|Freeman|2005|pp=9–11, 155–156}} This period, beginning with Davis' 1969 studio album ''[[In a Silent Way]]'' and concluding with the 1975 concert recording ''[[Agharta (album)|Agharta]]'', was the most controversial in his career, alienating and challenging many in jazz.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Christgau|1997}}; {{harvnb|Freeman|2005|pp=10–11, back cover}}&lt;/ref&gt; His million-selling 1970 record ''[[Bitches Brew]]'' helped spark a resurgence in the genre's commercial popularity with [[jazz fusion]] as the decade progressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Segell|first=Michael|date=December 28, 1978|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/the-children-of-bitches-brew-19781228|title=The Children of 'Bitches Brew'|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=June 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a five-year retirement due to poor health, Davis resumed his career in the 1980s, employing younger musicians and [[popular music|pop]] sounds on albums such as ''[[The Man with the Horn]]'' (1981) and ''[[Tutu (album)|Tutu]]'' (1986). Critics were generally unreceptive but the decade garnered the trumpeter his highest level of commercial recognition. He performed sold-out concerts worldwide while branching out into visual arts, film, and television work, before his death in 1991 from the combined effects of a [[stroke]], [[pneumonia]] and [[respiratory failure]].&lt;ref name="rsbio"/&gt; In 2006, Davis was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]],&lt;ref name="Miles Davis"/&gt; which recognized him as "one of the key figures in the history of jazz."&lt;ref name="Miles Davis"/&gt; ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' described him as "the most revered jazz trumpeter of all time, not to mention one of the most important musicians of the 20th century,"&lt;ref name="rsbio"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Macnie|first1=Jim|title=Miles Davis Biography|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/miles-davis/biography|website=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=11 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Gerald Early]] called him inarguably one of the most influential and innovative musicians of that period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gerald Lyn|first=Early|title=Ain't But a Place: an anthology of African American writings about St. Louis|publisher=[[Missouri History Museum]]|year=1998|isbn=1-883982-28-6|page=205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Miles Dewey Davis III was born on May 26, 1926, to an affluent [[African-American]] family in [[Alton, Illinois|Alton]], Illinois, fifteen miles north of [[St. Louis]].{{sfn|Cook|2007|p=9}}{{sfn|Early|2001|p=209}} He had an older sister, Dorothy Mae (born 1925), and a younger brother, Vernon (born 1929). His mother, Cleota Mae Henry of [[Arkansas]], was a music teacher and violinist, and his father, [[Miles Dewey Davis Jr.]], also of Arkansas, was a dentist. They owned a 200-acre estate near [[Pine Bluff, Arkansas|Pine Bluff]], Arkansas with a profitable pig farm. In Pine Bluff, he and his siblings fished, hunted, and rode horses.{{sfn|The Complete Illustrated History|2007|p=17}}{{sfn|Orr|2012|p=11}} In 1927, the family moved to East St. Louis, Illinois. They lived on the second floor of a commercial building behind a dental office in a predominantly white neighborhood. From 1932 to 1934, Davis attended John Robinson Elementary School, an all-black school,{{sfn|Early|2001|p=209}} then Crispus Attucks, where he performed well in mathematics, music, and sports.{{sfn|Orr|2012|p=11}} At an early age he liked music, especially blues, big bands, and gospel.{{sfn|The Complete Illustrated History|2007|p=17}}

[[File:MilesDavisYouthHouse.EastStLouis.17thStreetandKansasAvenue.3.jpg|thumb|The house at 1701 Kansas Avenue in East St. Louis, Illinois, where Davis lived from 1939 to 1944]]

In 1935, Davis received his first trumpet as a gift from John Eubanks, a friend of his father.{{sfn|Early|2001|p=210}} He took lessons from [[Elwood Buchanan]], a teacher and musician who was a patient of his father.{{sfn|Cook|2007|p=9}} His mother wanted him to play violin instead.{{sfn|The Complete Illustrated History|2007|p=19}} Against the fashion of the time, Buchanan stressed the importance of playing without [[vibrato]] and encouraged him to use a clear, mid-range tone. Davis said that whenever he started playing with heavy vibrato, Buchanan slapped his knuckles.{{sfn|The Complete Illustrated History|2007|p=19}}{{sfn|Cook|2007|p=9}}{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1990|p=32}} In later years Davis said, "I prefer a round sound with no attitude in it, like a round voice with not too much tremolo and not too much bass. Just right in the middle. If I can't get that sound I can't play anything."&lt;ref name="KAHN2001"&gt;[[#Kahn|Kahn]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939, the family moved to 1701 Kansas Avenue in East St. Louis. On his thirteenth birthday his father bought him a new trumpet,{{sfn|Early|2001|p=210}} and Davis began to play in local bands. He took additional trumpet lessons from Joseph Gustat, principal trumpeter of the [[St. Louis Symphony Orchestra]].{{sfn|Early|2001|p=210}}

In 1941, the 15-year-old attended [[East St. Louis Lincoln High School]], where he joined the marching band directed by Buchanan and entered music competitions. Years later, Davis said that if he lost a contest, it was because of [[racism]], but he added that these experiences made him a better musician.{{sfn|Orr|2012|p=11}} When a drummer asked him to play a certain passage of music, and he couldn't do it, he began to learn [[music theory]]. "I went and got everything, every book I could get to learn about theory."{{sfn|The Complete Illustrated History|2007|p=23}} At Lincoln, Davis met his first girlfriend, Irene Birth (later Cawthon).{{sfn|Morton|2005|p=10}} He had a band that performed at the Elks Club.&lt;ref name="Arons"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Arons |first1=Rachel|title=Slide Show: American Public Libraries Great and Small|url=http://www.grahamfoundation.org/system/grants/press/284/original/Dawson_MediaCov_NewYorker_20140321.pdf|website=Graham Foundation|accessdate=8 May 2018|page=5|date=21 March 2014|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of his earnings paid for his sister's education at [[Fisk University]].{{sfn|Early|2001|p=211}} Davis befriended trumpeter [[Clark Terry]], who suggested he play without vibrato, and performed with him for several years.{{sfn|Early|2001|p=210}}{{sfn|Early|2001|p=211}}

With encouragement from his teacher and girlfriend, Davis filled a vacant spot in the Rhumboogie Orchestra, also known as the Blue Devils, led by Eddie Randle. He became the band's musical director, which involved hiring musicians and scheduling rehearsal.{{sfn|Orr|2012|p=12}}{{sfn|Early|2001|p=211}} Years later, Davis considered this job one of the most important of his career.{{sfn|The Complete Illustrated History|2007|p=23}} [[Sonny Stitt]] tried to persuade him to join the [[Tiny Bradshaw]] band, which was passing through town, but his mother insisted he finish high school before going on tour. He said later, "I didn't talk to her for two weeks. And I didn't go with the band either."{{sfn|Orr|2012|p=13}} In January 1944, Davis finished high school and graduated in absentia in June. During the next month, his girlfriend gave birth to a daughter, Cheryl.{{sfn|Early|2001|p=211}}

In July 1944, [[Billy Eckstine]] visited St. Louis with a band that included [[Art Blakey]], [[Dizzy Gillespie]], and [[Charlie Parker]]. Trumpeter Buddy Anderson was too sick to perform,{{sfn|Cook|2007|p=9}} so Davis was invited to join. He played with the band for two weeks at Club Riviera.{{sfn|Early|2001|p=211}}{{sfn|Cook|2007|p=10}} After playing with these musicians, he was certain he should move to New York City "where the action was."{{sfn|The Complete Illustrated History|2007|p=29}} His mother wanted him to go to Fisk University, like his sister, and study piano or violin. Davis had other interests.{{sfn|Orr|2012|p=13}}

== Career ==
===1944–1948: New York City and the bebop years===
[[File:Charlie Parker, Tommy Potter, Miles Davis, Duke Jordan, Max Roach (Gottlieb 06851).jpg|thumb|left|[[Tommy Potter]], [[Charlie Parker]], [[Max Roach]], Miles Davis, [[Duke Jordan]] August 1947]]
In September 1944, Davis accepted his father's idea of studying at the [[Juilliard School|Institute of Musical Arts]], later known as the Juilliard School, in New York City.{{sfn|Early|2001|p=211}} After passing the audition, he attended classes in music theory, piano, and dictation.{{sfn|The Complete Illustrated History|2007|p=32}} But he spent much of his time in clubs looking for his idol, Charlie Parker, despite being advised against doing so by several people, including [[Coleman Hawkins]].{{sfn|Cook|2007|p=10}}&lt;ref name="abio"&gt;[[#Bio|''The Autobiography'']]. {{page needed|date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After finding Parker, he became one of a cadre of regulars at [[Minton's Playhouse|Minton's]] and [[Monroe's]] in Harlem who held jam sessions every night. The other regulars included [[J. J. Johnson]], [[Kenny Clarke]], [[Thelonious Monk]], [[Fats Navarro]], and [[Freddie Webster]]. Davis reunited with Cawthon and their daughter when they moved to New York City. Parker became a roommate.{{sfn|Cook|2007|p=10}}{{sfn|Early|2001|p=211}}

In mid-1945, Davis failed to register for the year's autumn term at Juilliard and dropped out after three semesters{{sfn|The Complete Illustrated History|2007|p=17}}{{sfn|Early|2001|p=38}}{{sfn|Early|2001|p=211}} because he wanted to perform full-time.{{sfn|Early|2001|p=68}} Years later he criticized Juilliard for concentrating too much on classical European and "white" repertoire, but he praised the school for teaching him music theory and improving his trumpet technique.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

He began performing at clubs on 52nd Street with Coleman Hawkins and [[Eddie "Lockjaw" Davis]]. He recorded for the first time on April 24, 1945 when he entered the studio as a sideman for [[Herbie Fields]]'s band.{{sfn|Early|2001|p=211}}{{sfn|Cook|2007|p=10}} During the next year, he recorded as a leader for the first time with the Miles Davis Sextet plus Earl Coleman and Ann Hathaway, one of the few times he accompanied a singer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plosin.com/milesAhead/Sessions.aspx?s=461018 |title=See the Plosin session database |publisher=Plosin.com |date=1946-10-18 |accessdate=2011-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1945, he replaced Dizzy Gillespie in Charlie Parker's quintet. On November 26, Davis participated in several recording sessions as part of Parker's group Reboppers that also involved Gillespie and [[Max Roach]],{{sfn|Early|2001|p=211}} displaying hints of the style he would become known for. In Parker's song "[[Now's the Time (composition)|Now's the Time]]", Davis played a solo that anticipated [[cool jazz]]. He then joined a big band led by [[Benny Carter]], performing in St. Louis and remaining with the band in California. He again played with Parker and Gillespie.{{sfn|Early|2001|p=212}} In Los Angeles, Parker had a nervous breakdown that put him in the hospital for several months.{{sfn|Early|2001|p=212}}&lt;ref&gt;On this occasion, Mingus bitterly criticized Davis for abandoning his "musical father" (see [[#Bio|''The Autobiography'']]).&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1946, Davis played in studio sessions with Parker and began a collaboration with bassist [[Charles Mingus]] that summer. Cawthon gave birth to Davis's second child, Gregory, in East St. Louis before reuniting with Davis in New York City the following year.{{sfn|Early|2001|p=212}} Davis noted that by this time, "I was still so much into the music that I was even ignoring Irene." He had also turned to alcohol and cocaine.{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1990|p=105}}

He was a member of Billy Eckstine's big band in 1946 and Gillespie's in 1947.&lt;ref name="New Grove"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kernfeld|first1=Barry|editor1-last=Kernfeld|editor1-first=Barry|title=The New Grove Dictionary of Jazz|date=2002|publisher=Grove's Dictionaries|location=New York|isbn=1-56159-284-6|page=573|volume=1|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; He joined a quintet led by Parker that also included Max Roach. Together they performed live with [[Duke Jordan]] and [[Tommy Potter]] for much of the year, including several studio sessions.{{sfn|Early|2001|p=212}} In one session that May, Davis wrote the tune "Cheryl", named after his daughter. Davis's first session as a leader followed in August 1947, playing as the Miles Davis All Stars that included Parker, pianist [[John Lewis (pianist)|John Lewis]], and bassist [[Nelson Boyd]]; they recorded "Milestones", "Half Nelson", and "Sippin' at Bells".{{sfn|Cook|2007|p=12}}{{sfn|Early|2001|p=212}} After touring Chicago and Detroit with Parker's quintet, Davis returned to New York City in March 1948 and joined the [[Jazz at the Philharmonic]] tour, which included a stop in St. Louis on April 30.{{sfn|Early|2001|p=212}}

===1948–1950: Miles Davis Nonet and birth of the cool===
In August 1948, Davis declined an offer to join [[Duke Ellington]]'s orchestra as he had entered rehearsals with a nine-piece band with pianist and arranger [[Gil Evans]] and baritone saxophonist [[Gerry Mulligan]], taking an active role on what soon became his own project.&lt;ref&gt;Mulligan, Gerry. ''[http://www.gerrymulligan.com/wp-content/files/auto-bio.pdf I hear America singing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303225918/http://www.gerrymulligan.com/wp-content/files/auto-bio.pdf |date=March 3, 2016 }}'': "Miles, the bandleader. He took the initiative and put the theories to work. He called the rehearsals, hired the halls, called the players, and generally cracked the whip."&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Early|2001|p=212}} Evans' Manhattan apartment had become the meeting place for several young musicians and composers such as Davis, Roach, Lewis, and Mulligan who were unhappy with the increasingly virtuoso instrumental techniques that dominated bebop.{{sfn|Cook|2007|p=14}} These gatherings led to the formation of the Miles Davis [[Nonet (music)|Nonet]], which included the unusual additions of French horn and tuba. The intent was to imitate the human voice through carefully arranged compositions and a relaxed, melodic approach to improvisation. In September, the band completed their sole engagement as the opening band for [[Count Basie]] at the [[Royal Roost]] for two weeks. Davis had to persuade the venue's manager to write the sign "Miles Davis Nonet. Arrangements by Gil Evans, John Lewis and Gerry Mulligan." He prevailed only with the help of [[Monte Kay]], the club's artistic director. Davis returned to Parker's quintet, but relationships within the quintet were growing tense mainly due to Parker's erratic behavior caused by his drug addiction.{{sfn|Early|2001|p=212}} Early into his time with Parker, Davis abstained from drugs, ate a vegetarian diet, and spoke of the benefits of water and juice.{{sfn|Cook|2007|p=2}} Matters worsened when Davis and Roach objected to the addition of pianist [[Duke Jordan]]&lt;ref name="abio"/&gt; and preferred to hire [[Bud Powell]]. In December 1948 Davis quit,{{sfn|Early|2001|p=212}} claiming he was not being paid.

His departure began a period when he worked mainly as a freelancer and sideman. His nonet remained active until the end of 1949. After signing a contract with [[Capitol Records]], they recorded sessions in January and April 1949, which sold little but influenced the "cool" or "west coast" style of jazz.{{sfn|Early|2001|p=212}} The line-up changed throughout the year and included the additions of tuba player [[Bill Barber (musician)|Bill Barber]], alto saxophonist [[Lee Konitz]], who had been preferred to [[Sonny Stitt]] as his style was considered too bop-oriented, pianist [[Al Haig]], trombone players [[Mike Zwerin]] with [[Kai Winding]], French horn players [[Junior Collins]] with Sandy Siegelstein and [[Gunther Schuller]], and bassists [[Al McKibbon]] and [[Joe Shulman]]. One track featured singer [[Kenny Hagood]]. The presence of white musicians in the group angered some black players, many of whom were unemployed at the time, yet Davis rebuffed their criticisms.{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1990|p=117}} Recording sessions with the nonet for Capitol Records continued until April 1950; much of it remained unreleased until the issue of ''[[Birth of the Cool]]'' (1957), its name given to the cool jazz movement{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} that had developed and the musical direction the group had taken.

In May 1949, Davis performed with the [[Tadd Dameron]] Quintet with [[Kenny Clarke]] and [[James Moody (saxophonist)|James Moody]] at the [[Paris Jazz Festival|Paris International Jazz Festival]]. On his first trip abroad Davis took a strong liking for Paris and its cultural environment, where he felt black jazz musicians and people of color in general were better respected than in America. The trip, he said, "changed the way I looked at things forever."{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1990|p=126}} He began an affair with singer and actress [[Juliette Gréco]] that lasted for several years.

===1949–1955: Signing with Prestige, drug addiction, and hard bop ===
After returning from Paris in mid-1949, he became depressed and found little work, which included a short engagement with Powell in October and guest spots in New York City, Chicago, and Detroit until January 1950.{{sfn|Szwed|2004|p=91}} He was falling behind in hotel rent and attempts were made to repossess his car. His heroin use became an expensive addiction, and Davis, yet to reach 24 years old, "lost my sense of discipline, lost my sense of control over my life, and started to drift."{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1990|p=129}}{{sfn|Early|2001|p=212}} In August 1950, during a family trip to East St. Louis and Chicago in an attempt to improve their fortunes, Cawthon gave birth to Davis's second son, Miles IV. Davis befriended boxer [[Johnny Bratton]] and began his interest in the sport. Davis left Cawthon and his three children in New York City in the hands of a friend, jazz singer [[Betty Carter]]. He remained grateful to her for the rest of his life.{{sfn|Szwed|2004|p=91}} He toured with Eckstine and [[Billie Holiday]] and was arrested for heroin possession in Los Angeles. The story was reported in ''[[DownBeat]]'' magazine, which caused a further reduction in work, though he was acquitted weeks later.{{sfn|Cook|2007|p=25}}

In January 1951, Davis's fortunes improved when he signed a one-year contract with [[Prestige Records]] after owner [[Bob Weinstock]] became a fan of the nonet.{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1990|pp=175–176}} Davis chose Lewis, trombonist [[Bennie Green]], bassist [[Percy Heath]], saxophonist [[Sonny Rollins]], and drummer [[Roy Haynes]]; they recorded what became part of ''[[Miles Davis and Horns]]'' (1956). Davis was hired for other studio dates in March, June, and September 1951{{sfn|Cook|2007|p=25}} and started transcribing scores for record labels to fund his heroin addiction. During the next month, he recorded his second session for Prestige as band leader. The material was released on ''[[The New Sounds]]'' (1951), ''[[Dig (Miles Davis album)|Dig]]'' (1956), and ''[[Conception (album)|Conception]]'' (1956).{{sfn|Cook|2007|p=26}}

Davis supported his heroin habit by playing music and by living the life of a hustler, exploiting prostitutes, and receiving money from friends. By 1953, his addiction began to impair his playing. His drug habit became public in a ''Down Beat'' interview with [[Cab Calloway]], whom he never forgave as it brought him "all pain and suffering."{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1990|p=164}} He returned to St. Louis and stayed with his father for several months.{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1990|p=164}} Though he continued to use heroin, he met Roach and Mingus in September 1953 on their way to Los Angeles and joined their band, but the trip caused problems.{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1990|pp=164–165}} He returned to his father's home, "determined to kick my habit...that was the only thing on my mind."{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1990|p=169}} He locked himself inside the guest house "for about seven or eight days" until he had gone through withdrawal. After the ordeal, he "sat down and started thinking about how I was going to get my life back together."{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1990|p=170}}

Davis lived in Detroit for about six months, avoiding New York City where it was easy to get drugs. Though he used heroin, he was still able to perform locally with [[Elvin Jones]] and [[Tommy Flanagan]] as part of [[Billy Mitchell (jazz musician)|Billy Mitchell]]'s house band at the [[Blue Bird Inn|Blue Bird]] club. He was also "pimping a little."{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1990|p=171}} A widely related story, attributed to Richard "Prophet" Jennings,&lt;ref name=ebony1961&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Marc |last=Crawford |title=Miles Davis: Evil genius of jazz|magazine=Ebony|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GyvbN5PqVCAC&amp;lpg=PA74&amp;pg=PA69#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|date=January 1961|publisher=Johnson Publishing Company|pages=69–78|issn=0012-9011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Nisenson|1982|pp=88–89}} was that Davis stumbled into [[Baker's Keyboard Lounge]] out of the rain, carrying his trumpet in a paper bag under his coat. He walked to the bandstand, interrupted Roach and [[Clifford Brown]] in the middle of performing "[[Sweet Georgia Brown]]", and played "[[My Funny Valentine]]" before leaving. Davis was supposedly embarrassed into getting clean by this incident. He disputed this account, stating that Roach had invited him to play and that his decision to quit heroin was unrelated to the incident. He said he was inspired to quit by his idol, boxer [[Sugar Ray Robinson]].{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1990|pp=173–174}}

[[File:Trumpet WahWahMute.jpg|thumb|right|During the 1950s, Davis started using a [[Harmon mute|mute]] on his trumpet. It became part of his signature sound for the rest of his career.]]

In February 1954 Davis returned to New York City, feeling good "for the first time in a long time," mentally and physically stronger, and joined a gym.{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1990|p=174, 175, 184}} He informed Weinstock and management at [[Blue Note Records]] that he was ready to record with a quintet, which he was granted. He considered the resulting albums ''[[Miles Davis Quartet (album)|Miles Davis Quartet]]'' (1954) and ''[[Miles Davis Volume 2]]'' (1956) "very important" because he felt his performances were particularly strong.{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1990|p=175}} He was paid roughly $750 (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|750|1954}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) for each album and refused to give away his publishing rights.{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1990|p=176}}

Davis abandoned the bebop style and turned to the music of pianist [[Ahmad Jamal]], whose approach and use of space influenced him.{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1990|p=190}} When he returned to the studio in June 1955 to record ''Miles Davis Quartet'', he wanted a pianist like Jamal and picked [[Red Garland]].{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1990|p=190}} ''[[Blue Haze]]'' (1956), ''[[Bags' Groove]]'' (1957), ''[[Walkin']]'' (1957), and ''[[Miles Davis and the Modern Jazz Giants]]'' (1959) were recorded after his recovery from heroin addiction. They documented the evolution of his sound with the [[Harmon mute]], also known as a [[wah-wah (music)|wah-wah]] mute, placed close to the microphone, and the use of more spacious and relaxed phrasing. He assumed a central role in [[hard bop]], which was slower than bebop, less radical in harmony and melody, and often used popular songs and American standards as starting points for improvisation. Hard bop distanced itself from cool jazz with a harder beat and music inspired by the blues.&lt;ref&gt;Open references to the blues in jazz playing were fairly recent. Until the middle of the 1930s, as Coleman Hawkins declared to [[Alan Lomax]] (''The Land Where the Blues Began.'' New York: Pantheon, 1993), African-American players working in white establishments would avoid references to the blues altogether.&lt;/ref&gt; A few critics consider ''Walkin' '' (1957) the album that created the hard bop genre.&lt;ref name="KAHN2001"/&gt;

Davis gained a reputation for being cold, distant—and easily angered. He wrote that in 1954 Sugar Ray Robinson "was the most important thing in my life besides music" and adopted Robinson's "arrogant attitude."{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1990|p=183}} He showed contempt for critics and the press. There were well-publicized confrontations with the public and with other musicians. An argument with [[Thelonious Monk]] during the recording of ''Bags' Groove'' was reported.&lt;ref&gt;Davis had asked Monk to "lay off" (stop playing) while he was soloing. In his autobiography, Davis says that Monk "could not play behind a horn." [[Charles Mingus]] reported this, and more, in his "Open Letter to Miles Davis."&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-1954, Davis reunited with Gréco for the first time since 1949 after she arrived in New York City for film prospects. The two had been in occasional contact since he left Paris. Though he was too busy to move to Spain with her, they "remained lovers for many years.{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1990|p=184}}

Davis had an operation to remove polyps from his larynx in October 1955.{{sfn|Szwed|2004}} The doctors told him to remain silent after the operation—but he got into an argument that permanently damaged his vocal cords and gave him a raspy voice for the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Acquired by shouting at a record producer while still ailing after a recent operation to the throat – [[#Bio|''The Autobiography'']].&lt;/ref&gt; He was called the "prince of darkness,” adding a patina of mystery to his public persona.&lt;ref&gt;Writers began to refer to Davis as "the Prince of Darkness,” in liner notes of the records of this period, and the moniker persists. See, for instance, [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb1367/is_199111/ai_n5603401/ his obituary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130808234925/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb1367/is_199111/ai_n5603401/|date=August 8, 2013}} in ''[[The Nation]]'', and references in DVD, movies [https://www.pbs.org/jazz/biography/artist_id_davis_miles.htm] and print articles [http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=29834].&lt;/ref&gt;

===1955–1959: Signing with Columbia, first quintet, and modal jazz ===
In July 1955, Davis's fortunes improved considerably when he was invited to the second annual [[Newport Jazz Festival]] on July 17, with a line-up of Monk, Heath, drummer [[Connie Kay]], and horn players [[Zoot Sims]] and [[Gerry Mulligan]]. He convinced organizer [[George Wein]] that he should be on the bill, and Wein agreed.{{sfn|The Complete Illustrated History|2007|p=73}} The performance was praised by critics and increased his popularity among affluent white audiences.{{sfn|Morton|2005|p=27}} He tied with Dizzy Gillespie for best trumpeter in the 1955 ''Down Beat'' magazine Readers' Poll.{{sfn|Cook|2007|pp=43–44}}

[[George Avakian]] of [[Columbia Records]] saw Davis perform at Newport and wanted to sign him to the label. Davis had one year left on his contract with Prestige, which required him to release four more albums. He signed a contract with Columbia that included a $4,000 advance (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|4000|1955}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) and a condition that his recordings for Columbia would remain unreleased until his agreement with Prestige expired.{{sfn|Carr|1998|96}}{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1990|p=192}}

At the request of Avakian, he formed the [[Miles Davis Quintet]] for a performance at [[Café Bohemia]]. The quintet consisted of Davis on trumpet, Sonny Rollins on tenor saxophone, [[Red Garland]] on piano, [[Paul Chambers]] on double bass, and [[Philly Joe Jones]] on drums. Rollins was replaced by [[John Coltrane]], completing the membership of the first quintet. This group appeared on his final albums for Prestige: ''[[Cookin' with the Miles Davis Quintet]]'' (1957), ''[[Relaxin' with the Miles Davis Quintet]]'' (1958), ''[[Workin' with the Miles Davis Quintet]]'' (1959), and ''[[Steamin' with the Miles Davis Quintet]]'' (1961). Each album helped establish Davis's quintet as one of the best.{{sfn|Chambers|1998|p=223}}{{sfn|Cook|2007|p=45}}{{sfn|Carr|1998|99}}

The style of the group was an extension of their experience playing with Davis. He played long, legato, melodic lines, while Coltrane contrasted with energetic solos. Their live repertoire was a mix of bebop, standards from the [[Great American Songbook]] and pre-bop eras, and traditional tunes. They appeared on ''[['Round About Midnight]]'', Davis's first album for Columbia.

In 1956, he left his quintet temporarily to tour Europe as part of the Birdland All-Stars, which included the [[Modern Jazz Quartet]] and French and German musicians. In Paris he reunited with Greco for the first time since 1949.{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1990|p=207}}{{sfn|Early|2001|p=215}} He then returned home, reunited his quintet and toured the US for two months. Conflict arose on tour as he grew impatient with the drug habits of Jones and Coltrane. Davis was trying to live a healthier life by exercising and reducing his alcohol. But he continued to use cocaine.{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1990|p=209}} At the end of the tour, he fired Jones and Coltrane and replaced them with Sonny Rollins and [[Art Taylor]].{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1990|p=214}}

In November 1957, Davis went to Paris and recorded the [[Ascenseur pour l'échafaud (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] to ''Ascenseur pour l'échafaud''&lt;ref name="New Grove" /&gt; directed by [[Louis Malle]] (1958). Consisting of French session musicians [[Barney Wilen]], [[Pierre Michelot]], and [[René Urtreger]], and American drummer [[Kenny Clarke]], the group avoided a written score and instead improvised while they watched the film in a recording studio.

After returning to New York City, Davis revived his quintet with Adderley&lt;ref name="New Grove" /&gt; and Coltrane, who was clean from his drug habit. Now a sextet, the group recorded material in early 1958 that was released on ''[[Milestones (Miles Davis album)|Milestones]]'' (1958), an album that demonstrated Davis's interest in [[modal jazz]]. A performance by [[Les Ballets Africains]] drew him to slower, deliberate music that allowed the creation of solos from harmony rather than chords.{{sfn|The Complete Illustrated History|2007|p=97}} In this form of ballet music, the [[kalimba]] was played for a long periods on a single chord, weaving in and out of [[consonance and dissonance]].{{sfn|Early|2001|p=89}}

By May 1958, he had replaced Jones with drummer [[Jimmy Cobb]], and Red Garland left the group, leaving Davis to play piano on "Sid's Ahead" for the album ''Milestones''.{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1990|p=224}} He wanted someone who could play modal jazz, so he hired [[Bill Evans]], a young, white pianist with a background in classical music.{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1990|p=229}} Evans had an impressionistic approach to piano. His ideas greatly influenced Davis. But after eight months of touring, a tired Evans left. [[Wynton Kelly]], his replacement, brought to the group a swinging style that contrasted with Evans's delicacy. The sextet made their recording debut on ''[[Jazz Track]]'' (1958).{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1990|p=229}}

===1957–1963: Collaborations with Gil Evans and ''Kind of Blue''===
By early 1957, Davis was exhausted from recording and touring with his quintet and wished to pursue new projects. During a two-week residency in Chicago in March, the 30-year-old Davis told journalists of his intention to retire at its conclusion and revealed offers he had received to become a teacher at [[Harvard University]] and a musical director at a record label.{{sfn|Szwed|2004|p=139}}{{sfn|Carr|1998|p=107}} Avakian agreed that it was time for Davis to explore something different, but Davis rejected his suggestion of returning to his nonet as he considered that a step backward.{{sfn|Carr|1998|p=107}} Avakian then suggested that he work with a bigger ensemble, similar to ''Music for Brass'' (1957), an album of orchestral and brass-arranged music led by [[Gunther Schuller]] featuring Davis as a guest soloist.

Davis accepted and worked with Gil Evans in what became a five-album collaboration from 1957 to 1962.{{sfn|Szwed|2004|p=140}} ''[[Miles Ahead (album)|Miles Ahead]]'' (1957) showcased Davis playing a flugelhorn and a rendition "The Maids of Cadiz" by [[Léo Delibes]], the first piece of classical music that Davis recorded. Evans devised orchestral passages as transitions, thus turning the album into one long piece of music.{{sfn|Szwed|2004|p=141}}&lt;ref&gt;Cook, op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Porgy and Bess (Miles Davis album)|Porgy and Bess]]'' (1959) includes arrangements of pieces from George Gershwin's [[Porgy and Bess|opera]]. ''[[Sketches of Spain]]'' (1960) contained music by composers [[Joaquín Rodrigo]] and [[Manuel de Falla]] and originals by Evans. The classical musicians had trouble improvising, while the jazz musicians couldn't handle the difficult arrangements, but the album was a critical success, selling over 120,000 copies in the US.{{sfn|The Complete Illustrated History|2007|p=108}} Davis performed with an orchestra conducted by Evans at Carnegie Hall in May 1961 to raise money for charity.{{sfn|The Complete Illustrated History|2007|p=109}} The pair's final album was ''[[Quiet Nights (Miles Davis and Gil Evans album)|Quiet Nights]]'' (1962), a collection of [[bossa nova]] songs released against their wishes. Evans stated it was only half an album and blamed the record company; Davis blamed producer [[Teo Macero]] and refused to speak to him for more than two years.{{sfn|Carr|1998|pp=192–193}} Davis noted later that "my best friend is Gil Evans";{{sfn|Lees|2001|p=24}} their work was included in the boxed set ''[[Miles Davis &amp; Gil Evans: The Complete Columbia Studio Recordings]]'' (1996), which won a Grammy Award for [[Grammy Award for Best Historical Album|Best Historical Album]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Album Notes|Best Album Notes]] in 1997.

In March and April 1959, Davis recorded what many critics consider his greatest album, ''[[Kind of Blue]]'' (1959). He named the album for its mood.{{sfn|The Complete Illustrated History|2007|p=106}} He called back Bill Evans, as the music had been planned around Evans's piano style.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|p=95}} Both Davis and Evans were familiar with [[George Russell (composer)|George Russell]]'s ideas about modal jazz.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|pp=29–30}}{{sfn|Kahn|2001|p=74}} But Davis neglected to tell pianist Wynton Kelly that Evans was returning, so Kelly appeared on only one song, "[[Freddie Freeloader]].” {{sfn|Kahn|2001|p=95}} The sextet had played "[[So What (instrumental)|So What]]" and "[[All Blues]]" at performances, but the remaining three compositions they saw for the first time in the studio.

Released in August 1959, ''Kind of Blue'' was an instant success, with widespread radio airplay and rave reviews from critics.{{sfn|The Complete Illustrated History|2007|p=106}} It remains the best selling jazz album of all time. In October 2008, the album reached [[RIAA certification|4× platinum]] certification from the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] for selling over four million copies in the US alone.&lt;ref name=riaa&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&amp;se=miles+davis#search_section|title=Gold &amp; Platinum – Search "Miles Davis"|publisher=Recording Industry Association of America|accessdate=May 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the US House of Representatives voted 409–0 to pass a resolution that honored it as a national treasure.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rnw.nl/english/article/us-politicians-honour-miles-davis-album |title=US politicians honour Miles Davis album &amp;#124; RNW Media |publisher=Rnw.nl |date= |accessdate=July 17, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203024206/http://www.rnw.nl/english/article/us-politicians-honour-miles-davis-album |archivedate=December 3, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/12/16/2773218.htm |title=US House of Reps honours Miles Davis album – ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |date=December 16, 2009 |accessdate=January 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the success of ''Kind of Blue'', Davis found himself involved with the law. On August 25, 1959, during a recording session at the [[Birdland (jazz club)|Birdland]] nightclub in New York City for the US Armed Services, he took a break outside the club.

Davis and his sextet toured to support ''Kind of Blue''.{{sfn|The Complete Illustrated History|2007|p=106}} He persuaded Coltrane to play with the group on one final European tour in the spring of 1960. Coltrane then departed to form his quartet, though he returned for some tracks on Davis's album ''[[Someday My Prince Will Come (Miles Davis album)|Someday My Prince Will Come]]'' (1961).

===1963–1968: Second quintet===
[[File:Miles Davis (Antibes Juan-les-Pins 1963).jpg|thumb|left|Davis performing in Antibes, France in July 1963]]
In December 1962, Davis, Kelly, Chambers, Cobb, and Rollins played together for the last time as the first three wanted to leave and play as a trio. Rollins left to join them soon after, leaving Davis to pay over $25,000 (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|25000|1962}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) to cancel upcoming gigs and quickly assemble a new group. Following auditions, he found his new band in tenor saxophonist [[George Coleman]], bassist [[Ron Carter]], pianist [[Victor Feldman]], and drummer [[Frank Butler (musician)|Frank Butler]].{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1990|pp=260–262}} By May 1963, Feldman and Butler were replaced by pianist [[Herbie Hancock]] and 17-year-old drummer [[Tony Williams (drummer)|Tony Williams]] who made Davis "excited all over again."{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1990|p=262}} With this group, Davis completed the rest of what became ''[[Seven Steps to Heaven]]'' (1963) and recorded the live albums ''[[Miles Davis in Europe]]'' (1964), ''[[My Funny Valentine (album)|My Funny Valentine]]'' (1965), and ''[[Four &amp; More]]'' (1966). The quintet played essentially the same bebop tunes and standards that Davis's previous bands had played, but they approached them with structural and rhythmic freedom and occasionally breakneck speed.

In 1964, Coleman was replaced by saxophonist [[Sam Rivers]] until Davis persuaded [[Wayne Shorter]] to leave [[Art Blakey]]. This quintet lasted through 1968. Shorter became the group's principal composer, and the album ''E.S.P.'' (1965) was named after his composition. While touring Europe, the group made its first album, ''[[Miles in Berlin]]'' (1965).{{sfn|Einarson|2005|pp=56–57}}

Davis needed medical attention for hip pain, which had worsened since his Japanese tour during the previous year.{{sfn|Carr|1998|p=202}} He underwent hip replacement surgery in April 1965, with bone taken from his shin, but it failed. After his third month in the hospital, he discharged himself due to boredom and went home. He returned to the hospital in August after a fall required the insertion of a plastic hip joint.{{sfn|Carr|1998|p=203}} In November 1965, he had recovered enough to return to performing with his quintet, which included [[The Complete Live at the Plugged Nickel 1965|gigs at the Plugged Nickel]] in Chicago. Teo Macero returned as his engineer and record producer after their rift over ''Quiet Nights'' had healed.{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1990|pp=282–283}}{{sfn|Carr|1998|p=204}}

In January 1966, Davis spent three months in the hospital due to a liver infection. When he resumed touring, he performed more at colleges because he had grown tired of the typical jazz venues.{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1990|p=283}} Columbia president [[Clive Davis]] noted that in 1966 his sales had declined to around 40,000–50,000 per album, compared to as many as 100,000 per release a few years before. Matters were not helped by the press reporting his apparent financial troubles and imminent demise.{{sfn|Carr|1998|pp=209–210}} After his appearance at the 1966 Newport Jazz Festival, he returned to the studio with his quintet for a series of productive sessions. He started a relationship with actress [[Cicely Tyson]], who helped him reduce his alcohol consumption.{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1990|p=284}}

Material from the 1966–1968 sessions was released on ''[[Miles Smiles (album)|Miles Smiles]]'' (1966), ''[[Sorcerer (Miles Davis album)|Sorcerer]]'' (1967), ''[[Nefertiti (Miles Davis album)|Nefertiti]]'' (1967), ''[[Miles in the Sky (album)|Miles in the Sky]]'' (1968), and ''[[Filles de Kilimanjaro]]'' (1968). The quintet's approach to the new music became known as "time no changes"—which referred to Davis's decision to depart from chordal sequences and adopt a more open approach, with the rhythm section responding to the soloists' melodies.{{sfn|Morton|2005|p=49}} Through ''Nefertiti'' the studio recordings consisted primarily of originals composed by Shorter, with occasional compositions by the other sidemen. In 1967, the group began to play their concerts in continuous sets, each tune flowing into the next, with only the melody indicating any sort of change. His bands performed this way until his hiatus in 1975.

''Miles in the Sky'' and ''Filles de Kilimanjaro''—which tentatively introduced electric bass, electric piano, and electric guitar on some tracks—pointed the way to the [[jazz fusion|fusion]] phase of Davis's career. He also began experimenting with more rock-oriented rhythms on these records. By the time the second half of ''Filles de Kilimanjaro'' was recorded, bassist [[Dave Holland]] and pianist [[Chick Corea]] had replaced Carter and Hancock. Davis soon took over the compositional duties of his sidemen.

===1968–1975: The electric period===
[[File:Miles Davis-140916-0016-103WPA.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Davis performing in 1971]]
In September 1968, Davis married 23-year-old model and songwriter [[Betty Davis|Betty Mabry]]. The marriage ended in divorce the following year, but Mabry, a familiar face in the New York City counterculture, helped introduce Davis to popular rock, soul, and funk musicians.{{sfn|The Complete Illustrated History|2007|p=143}} Jazz critic [[Leonard Feather]] visited Davis's apartment and was shocked to find him listening to albums by [[The Byrds]], [[Aretha Franklin]], and [[Dionne Warwick]]. He also liked [[James Brown]], [[Jimi Hendrix]], and [[Sly and the Family Stone]].{{sfn|The Complete Illustrated History|2007|p=145}}

''[[In a Silent Way]]'' (1969) was recorded in a single studio session on February 18, 1969, with Shorter, Hancock, Holland, and Williams alongside keyboardists [[Chick Corea]] and [[Josef Zawinul]] and guitarist [[John McLaughlin (musician)|John McLaughlin]]. The album contains two side-long tracks that Macero pieced together from different takes recorded at the session resembling elements of a classical [[sonata form]].{{Clarify|date=February 2018}}&lt;!--Did the takes already resemble sonata-form elements, or was it Macero's editing that produced that impression? If the former, did Macero edit the elements to suggest a sonata form in combination?--&gt; When the album was released in July 1969, some critics accused him of "selling out" to the rock and roll audience. Nevertheless, it reached number 134 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' Top LPs]] chart, his first album since ''My Funny Valentine'' to reach the chart. ''In a Silent Way'' was his entry into jazz fusion. The touring band of 1969–1970—with Shorter, Corea, Holland, and DeJohnette—never completed a studio recording together, and became known as Davis's "lost quintet".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url = https://www.npr.org/2013/01/30/170662462/a-1969-bootleg-unearths-miles-davis-lost-quintet |title=A 1969 Bootleg Unearths Miles Davis' 'Lost' Quintet|author=Tom Moon|publisher=[[NPR]] |date =January 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17676-the-bootleg-series-volume-2-live-in-europe-1969/ |title=Miles Davis |author=Hank Shteamer |publisher=[[Pitchfork Music Festival]] |date=January 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1969, Davis was shot at five times while in his car with one of his two lovers, Marguerite Eskridge. The incident left him with a graze and Eskridge unharmed.{{sfn|The Complete Illustrated History|2007|p=150}}

For the double album ''[[Bitches Brew]]'' (1970), he hired [[Jack DeJohnette]], [[Airto Moreira]], and [[Bennie Maupin]]. The album contained long compositions, some over twenty minutes, that were never played in the studio but were constructed from several takes by Macero and Davis. Other studio techniques included splicing, multitrack recording, and tape loops.{{sfn|Freeman|2005|pp=83–84}} ''Bitches Brew'' peaked at No. 35 on the ''Billboard'' Album chart.&lt;ref name="Bitches"&gt;{{cite web|title=Miles Davis|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/miles-davis|website=Billboard|accessdate=10 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976 it was certified gold for selling over 500,000 records.

In March 1970, Davis began to perform as the opening act for various rock acts, allowing Columbia to market ''Bitches Brew'' to a larger audience. He so offended by Clive Davis's suggestion to perform at the [[Fillmore East]] that he threatened to switch record labels, but he reconsidered and shared a bill with the [[Steve Miller Band]] and [[Neil Young]] with [[Crazy Horse (band)|Crazy Horse]] on March 6 and 7.{{sfn|The Complete Illustrated History|2007|p=150}} Biographer [[Paul Tingen]] wrote, "Miles's newcomer status in this environment" led to "mixed audience reactions, often having to play for dramatically reduced fees, and enduring the 'sell-out' accusations from the jazz world," as well as being "...attacked by sections of the black press for supposedly genuflecting to white culture."{{sfn|Tingen|2001|p=114}} The 1970 tours included the [[Isle of Wight Festival 1970|1970 Isle of Wight Festival]] on August 29 when he performed to an estimated 600,000 people, the largest of his career.{{sfn|The Complete Illustrated History|2007|p=153}} Plans to record with Hendrix ended after the guitarist's death; his funeral was the last that Davis attended.{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1990|pp=318–319}} Several live albums with a transitional sextet/septet including Corea, DeJohnette, Holland, Moreira, saxophonist [[Steve Grossman (saxophonist)|Steve Grossman]], and keyboardist [[Keith Jarrett]] were recorded during this period, including ''[[Miles Davis at Fillmore]]'' (1970) and ''[[Black Beauty: Miles Davis at Fillmore West]]'' (1973).&lt;ref name="Miles Davis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rockhall.com/inductees/miles-davis/bio/ |title=Miles Davis |accessdate=May 1, 2016 |publisher=[[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1971, Davis had signed a contract with Columbia that paid him $100,000 a year (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|100000|1971}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) for three years in addition to royalties.{{sfn|Carr|1998|p=302}} He recorded the soundtrack for the [[Jack Johnson (film)|1970 documentary film]] about heavyweight boxer [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]], containing two long pieces of 25 and 26 minutes in length with Hancock, McLaughlin, [[Sonny Sharrock]], and [[Billy Cobham]]. He was committed to making music for African-Americans who liked more commercial, pop, groove-oriented music. By November 1971, DeJohnette and Moreira had been replaced in the touring ensemble by drummer [[Leon "Ndugu" Chancler]] and percussionists [[James Mtume]] and [[Don Alias]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bigozine2.com/roio/?p=191 |title=roio » Blog Archive » MILES – BELGRADE 1971 |publisher=Bigozine2.com |date= |accessdate=July 17, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721032949/https://bigozine2.com/roio/?p=191 |archivedate=July 21, 2015 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Live-Evil (Miles Davis album)|Live-Evil]]'' (1971) was released in the same month. Showcasing former Stevie Wonder touring bassist [[Michael Henderson]], who replaced Holland in the autumn of 1970, the album demonstrated that Davis's ensemble had transformed into a funk-oriented group while retaining the exploratory imperative of ''Bitches Brew''.

In 1972, composer-arranger [[Paul Buckmaster]] introduced Davis to the music of German avant-garde composer [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]], leading to a period of creative exploration. Biographer J. K. Chambers wrote, "The effect of Davis' study of Stockhausen could not be repressed for long ... Davis' own 'space music' shows Stockhausen's influence compositionally."{{sfn|Chambers|1998|p=246}} His recordings and performances during this period were described as "space music" by fans, Feather, and Buckmaster, who described it as "a lot of mood changes—heavy, dark, intense—definitely space music."{{sfn|Carr|1998}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miles-beyond.com/bitchesbrew.htm|title=The Making of The Complete Bitches Brew Sessions|last=Tingen|first=Paul|date=1999|accessdate=April 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The studio album ''[[On the Corner]]'' (1972) blended the influence of Stockhausen and Buckmaster with funk elements. Davis invited Buckmaster to New York City to oversee the writing and recording of the album with Macero.{{sfn|Morton|2005|pp=72–73}} The album reached No. 1 on the ''Billboard'' jazz chart but peaked at No. 156 on the more heterogeneous Top 200 Albums chart. ''On the Corner'' elicited a favorable review from [[Ralph J.

"The music was meant to be heard by young black people, but they just treated it like any other jazz album and advertised it that way, pushed it on the jazz radio stations. Young black kids don't listen to those stations; they listen to R&amp;B stations and some rock stations."{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1990|p=328}} In October 1972, he broke his ankles in a car crash. He took painkillers and cocaine to cope with the pain.{{sfn|Cole|2005|p=28}} Looking back at his career after the incident, he wrote, "Everything started to blur."{{sfn|The Complete Illustrated History|2007|p=154}}

{{Quote box
| quote = This was music that polarized audiences, provoking boos and walk-outs amid the ecstasy of others. The length, density, and unforgiving nature of it mocked those who said that Miles was interested only in being trendy and popular. Some have heard in this music the feel and shape of a musician's late work, an egoless music that precedes its creator's death. As [[Theodor Adorno]] said of the late [[Beethoven]], the disappearance of the musician into the work is a bow to mortality. It was as if Miles were testifying to all that he had been witness to for the past thirty years, both terrifying and joyful.

After recording ''On the Corner'', he assembled a group with Henderson, Mtume, [[Carlos Garnett]], guitarist [[Reggie Lucas]], organist [[Lonnie Liston Smith]], tabla player [[Badal Roy]], sitarist [[Khalil Balakrishna]], and drummer [[Al Foster]]. Only Smith was a  jazz instrumentalist; consequently, the music emphasized rhythmic density and shifting textures instead of solos. This group was recorded live for ''[[In Concert (Miles Davis album)|In Concert]]'' (1973), but Davis found it unsatisfactory, leading him to drop the tabla and sitar and play keyboards. He also added guitarist [[Pete Cosey]]. The compilation studio album ''[[Big Fun (Miles Davis album)|Big Fun]]'' (1974) contains four long improvisations recorded between 1969 and 1972.

Studio activity in the 1970s culminated in sessions throughout 1973 and 1974 for ''[[Get Up with It]]'' (1974), a compilation that included four long pieces (comprising over ninety minutes of new music) alongside four shorter recordings from 1970 and 1972. The album contained "He Loved Him Madly", a thirty-minute tribute to the recently deceased Duke Ellington that presaged later developments in [[ambient music]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/oct/26/jazz.shopping&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, it performed comparably to ''On the Corner'', reaching number 8 on the jazz chart and number 141 on the pop chart. He then concentrated on live performance with a series of concerts that Columbia released on the double live albums ''[[Agharta (album)|Agharta]]'' (1975), ''[[Pangaea (album)|Pangaea]]'' (1976), and ''[[Dark Magus]]'' (1977). The first two are recordings of two sets from February 1, 1975 in Osaka, by which time Davis was troubled by pneumonia, osteoarthritis, sickle-cell anemia, depression, bursitis, and stomach ulcers; he relied on alcohol, codeine, and morphine to get through the engagements. His shows were routinely panned by critics who mentioned his habit of performing with his back to the audience.{{sfn|The Complete Illustrated History|2007|p=177}} Cosey later asserted that "the band really advanced after the Japanese tour",{{sfn|Tingen|2001|p=167}} but Davis was again hospitalized, for his ulcers and a hernia, during a tour of the US while opening for Herbie Hancock. Hancock had eclipsed his former employer from a commercial standpoint with ''[[Head Hunters]]'' (1973) and ''[[Thrust (album)|Thrust]]'' (1974), two albums that were marketed to pop audiences in the aftermath of the ''On the Corner'' farrago and peaked at number 13 on the ''Billboard'' pop chart.

After appearances at the 1975 Newport Jazz Festival in July and the [[Schaefer Music Festival]] in New York City on September 5, Davis dropped out of music.{{sfn|The Complete Illustrated History|2007|p=177}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=1 Laurent Cugny|title=1975: the end of an intrigue?

===1975–1980: Hiatus===
In his autobiography, Davis wrote frankly about his life during his hiatus from music. He called his [[Upper West Side]] brownstone a wreck and chronicled his heavy use of alcohol and cocaine, in addition to his sexual encounters with many women.&lt;ref name="abio"/&gt;{{sfn|Carr|1998|p=330}} In December 1975, he had regained enough strength to undergo a much needed hip replacement operation.{{sfn|Morton|2005|p=76}} In March 1976, ''Rolling Stone'' reported rumors of his imminent demise, citing his health problems during the previous tour.{{sfn|Carr|1998|p=332}} In December 1976, Columbia was reluctant to renew his contract and pay his usual large advances. But after his lawyer started negotiating with [[United Artists Records|United Artists]], Columbia matched their offer, establishing the Miles Davis Fund to pay him regularly. Pianist [[Vladimir Horowitz]] was the only other musician with Columbia that had a similar status.{{sfn|Carr|1998|p=329}}

In 1978, Julie Coryell interviewed Davis. Concerned about his health, she had him stay with a friend in Norwalk, Connecticut.{{sfn|Cole|2005|p=36}} Davis asked Coryell's husband, fusion guitarist [[Larry Coryell]], to participate in sessions with keyboardists [[Masabumi Kikuchi]] and George Pavlis, bassist [[T. M. Stevens]], and drummer [[Al Foster]].{{sfn|Cole|2005|p=36}} Davis played the arranged piece uptempo, abandoned his trumpet for the organ, and had Macero record the session without the band's knowledge. After Coryell declined a spot in a band that Davis was beginning to put together, Davis returned to his reclusive lifestyle in New York City.{{sfn|Szwed|2004|p=347}}{{sfn|Morton|2005|p=77, 78}} Soon after, Eskridge had Davis jailed for failing to pay child support to their son, which cost him $10,000 (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|10000|1978}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) for release on bail.{{sfn|Cole|2005|p=36}}{{sfn|Morton|2005|p=76}} A recording session that involved Buckmaster and Gil Evans was halted,{{sfn|Cole|2005|p=38}} with Evans leaving after failing to receive the payment he was promised. In August 1978, Davis hired a new manager, Mark Rothbaum, who had worked with him since 1972.{{sfn|Szwed|2004|p=358}} Despite the dearth of new material, Davis placed in the Top 10 trumpeter poll of ''Down Beat'' magazine in 1979.

[[File:Miles Davis and Cicely Tyson 1982.jpg|thumb|Davis and Cicely Tyson in 1982]]
By 1979, Davis had rekindled his relationship with actress [[Cicely Tyson]], with whom he overcame his cocaine addiction and regained his enthusiasm for music. The two married on November 26, 1981, in a ceremony at [[Bill Cosby]]'s home in Massachusetts that was officiated by politician and civil rights activist [[Andrew Young]].{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1990|p=348}}{{sfn|The Complete Illustrated History|2007|p=180}} The marriage ended in a divorce that was finalized in 1989.{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1990|pp=390–391}}

In October 1979, his contract with Columbia was up for negotiation. Label president Clive Davis was replaced by [[George Butler (record producer)|George Butler]], who had visited Davis several times during the previous two years to encourage him to return to the studio. To help his situation, Davis had Buckmaster come over to collaborate on new music.{{sfn|Carr|1998|p=340}} After arriving, Buckmaster organized an intervention for Davis, who was living in squalor among cockroach infestations, in the dark with his curtains always closed. His sister Dorothy cleaned his house with help from Buckmaster, Tyson, and neighbor [[Chaka Khan]]. Davis later thanked Buckmaster for helping him.{{sfn|Carr|1998|p=343}}

===1980–1985: Comeback===
Davis hadn't played the trumpet much for three years and found it difficult to reclaim his [[embouchure]]. His first studio appearance since his hiatus took place on May 1, 1980.{{sfn|Morton|2005|p=79}} A day later, Davis was hospitalized due to a leg infection.{{sfn|Carr|1998|p=349}} He recorded ''[[The Man with the Horn]]'' (1981) from June 1980 to May 1981 with Macero producing. A large band was abandoned in favor of a combo with saxophonist [[Bill Evans (saxophonist)|Bill Evans]] (not to be confused with pianist Bill Evans) and bassist [[Marcus Miller]]. Both would collaborate with him during the next decade.

''The Man with the Horn'' received a poor critical reception despite selling well. In June 1981, Davis returned to the stage for the first time since 1975 in a ten-minute guest solo as part of [[Mel Lewis]]'s band at the [[Village Vanguard]].{{sfn|Cole|2005|p=92}} This was followed by appearances with a new band, a four-night run at Kix in Boston, and two shows at Avery Fisher Hall on July 5 as part of the [[Kool Jazz Festival]].{{sfn|Carr|1998|p=363}}{{sfn|Morton|2005|p=77}} Recordings from a mixture of dates from 1981, including the Kix and Avery Fisher Hall gigs, were released on ''[[We Want Miles]]'' (1982),{{sfn|Morton|2005|p=78}} which earned him a Grammy Award for Best Jazz Instrumental Performance by a Soloist.{{sfn|The Complete Illustrated History|2007|p=180}}

In January 1982, while Tyson was working in Africa, Davis "went a little wild" with alcohol, and suffered a stroke that temporarily paralyzed his right hand.{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|pp=348–350}}{{sfn|Early|2001|p=222}} Tyson returned home and cared for him. After three months of treatment with a Chinese acupuncturist, he was able to play the trumpet again. He listened to his doctor's warnings and gave up alcohol and drugs. He credited Tyson with helping his recovery, which involved exercise, piano playing, and visits to spas. She encouraged him to draw, which he pursued for the rest of his life.{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|pp=348–350}}

Davis resumed touring in May 1982 with a line-up that included French percussionist [[Mino Cinelu]] and guitarist [[John Scofield]], with whom he worked closely on the album ''[[Star People]]'' (1983). In mid-1983, he worked on the tracks for ''[[Decoy (album)|Decoy]]'', an album mixing soul music and [[electronica]] that was released in 1984. He brought in producer, composer, and keyboardist [[Robert Irving III]], who had collaborated with him on ''The Man with the Horn''. With a seven-piece band that included Scofield, Evans, Irving, Foster, and [[Darryl Jones]], he played a series of European performances that were positively received. In December 1984, while in Denmark, he was awarded the [[Léonie Sonning Music Prize]]. Trumpeter [[Palle Mikkelborg]] had written a contemporary classical piece titled "Aura" for the event which impressed Davis to the point of returning to Denmark in early 1985 to record his next studio album, ''[[Aura (Miles Davis album)|Aura]]'' (1989).{{sfn|The Complete Illustrated History|2007|p=183}} Columbia was dissatisfied with the recording and delayed its release.

In May 1985, one month into a tour, Davis signed a contract with [[Warner Bros. Records]] that required him to give up his  publishing rights.{{sfn|Cole|2005|p=352}}{{sfn|The Complete Illustrated History|2007|p=194}} Trumpeter [[Wynton Marsalis]] publicly dismissed his more recent fusion recordings as not being "'true' jazz." Davis shrugged off the comment, calling Marsalis "a nice young man, only confused."{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} Marsalis appeared unannounced onstage during Davis's performance at the inaugural [[Vancouver International Jazz Festival]] in 1986. Marsalis whispered into Davis' ear that "someone" had told him to do so. Davis responded by ordering him off the stage.{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1990|p=374}} Davis had become increasingly irritated at Columbia's delay in releasing ''Aura''. The breaking point appears to have come when a producer at Columbia asked him to call Marsalis and wish him a happy birthday. The tour in 1985 included a performance in London in July in which Davis performed on stage for five hours. Jazz critic [[John Fordham (jazz critic)|John Fordham]] concluded, "The leader is clearly enjoying himself."{{sfn|Cole|2005|p=353}} By 1985, Davis was diabetic and required daily injections of insulin.{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1990|pp=363–364}}

He released ''[[You're Under Arrest (Miles Davis album)|You're Under Arrest]]'', his final album for Columbia, in September 1985. It included cover versions of two pop songs: "[[Time After Time (Cyndi Lauper song)|Time After Time]]" by [[Cyndi Lauper]] and  "[[Human Nature (Michael Jackson song)|Human Nature]]" sung by [[Michael Jackson]]. He considered releasing an album of pop songs, and he recorded dozens of them, but the idea was rejected. He said that many of today's jazz standards had been pop songs in [[Broadway theater]] and that he was simply updating the standards repertoire.

Davis collaborated with a number of figures from the British post-punk and new wave movements during this period, including [[Scritti Politti]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intro.de/magazin/musik/23035596?current_page=1 |title=Scritti Politti – Pop – INTRO |publisher=Intro.de|accessdate=July 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the invitation of producer [[Bill Laswell]], he recorded some trumpet parts during sessions for Public Image Ltd.'s ''[[Album (Public Image Limited album)|Album]]'', according to [[John Lydon]] in the liner notes of their ''[[Plastic Box]]'' box set. In Lydon's words, however, "Strangely enough, we didn't use [his contributions]." According to Lydon in the ''Plastic Box'' notes, Davis favorably compared Lydon's singing voice to his trumpet sound during these sessions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fodderstompf.com/DISCOGRAPHY/LP/3albumLP.html |title=Fodderstompf |publisher=Fodderstompf |date=March 10, 2009 |accessdate=January 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1986–1991: Final years===
[[File:Miles Davis Strasbourg face 2.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Davis performing in [[Strasbourg]], 1987]]
After taking part in the recording of the 1985 protest song "[[Sun City (song)|Sun City]]" as a member of [[Artists United Against Apartheid]], Davis appeared on the instrumental "Don't Stop Me Now" by [[Toto (band)|Toto]] for their album ''[[Fahrenheit (Toto album)|Fahrenheit]]'' (1986). For his next studio album, he intended to collaborate with [[Prince (artist)|Prince]], but the project was dropped. Instead, he worked with Marcus Miller. The result, ''[[Tutu (album)|Tutu]]'' (1986), was the first time he used modern studio tools such as programmed synthesizers, [[sampling (music)|sampling]], and drum loops. Released in September 1986, its front cover is a portrait of Davis by [[Irving Penn]].{{sfn|The Complete Illustrated History|2007|p=194}} The album was called the modern counterpart of ''Sketches of Spain''. {{citation needed|date=May 2018}} In 1987, he won a Grammy Award for [[Grammy Award for Best Improvised Jazz Solo|Best Jazz Instrumental Performance, Soloist]].

In 1988, Davis had a small part as a street musician in the Christmas comedy film ''[[Scrooged]]'' starring Bill Murray. He also collaborated with [[Zucchero Fornaciari]] in a version of ''Dune Mosse'' (''[[Blue's]]''), published in 2004 in ''[[Zu &amp; Co.]]'' of the Italian bluesman. In November 1988, he was inducted into the [[Knights of Malta]] at a ceremony at the Alhambra Palace in Spain (hence the "Sir" title on his gravestone).{{sfn|Gelbard|2012|pp=73–74}} Later that month, Davis cut his European tour short after he collapsed and fainted after a two-hour show in Madrid and flew home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Archives/1988/11/17/Davis-cuts-tour-short-following-collapse/9622595746000/|title=Davis cuts tour short following collapse|publisher=United Press International|date=November 17, 1988|accessdate=April 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rumors of his health were made public after the American magazine ''Star'', in its February 21, 1989 edition, published that Davis had contracted AIDS, prompting his manager Peter Shukat to issue a statement the following day to deny the claim. Shukat revealed Davis had been in the hospital for a mild case of pneumonia and the removal of a benign polyp on his vocal cords and was resting comfortably in preparation for his 1989 tours.&lt;ref name=latimes1989&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-02-22/entertainment/ca-88_1_locke-high-school|title=Jazz Notes: Manager Denies Miles Davis AIDS Report; Instruments Donated to Locke High School|first=Zan|last=Stewart|date=February 22, 1989|work=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=April 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Davis later blamed one of his former wives or girlfriends for starting the rumor and decided against taking legal action.{{sfn|Tingen|2001|p=263}} He was interviewed on ''[[60 Minutes]]'' by Harry Reasoner. In October 1989, he received a Grande Medaille de Vermeil from Paris mayor [[Jacques Chirac]].{{sfn|Chambers|1998|p=Introduction, xv}} In 1990, he received a [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]].{{sfn|Cole|2005|p=443}} In early 1991, he appeared in the [[Rolf de Heer]] film ''[[Dingo (film)|Dingo]]'' as a jazz musician.

[[File:Miles Davis 22.jpg|thumb|left|Davis at the [[North Sea Jazz Festival]], 1991]]
Davis followed ''Tutu'' with ''[[Amandla (album)|Amandla]]'' (1989) and soundtracks to four films: ''[[Street Smart (1987 film)|Street Smart]]'', ''[[Siesta (film)|Siesta]]'', ''[[The Hot Spot]]'', and ''[[Dingo (soundtrack)|Dingo]].'' His last albums were released posthumously: the hip hop-influenced ''[[Doo-Bop]]'' (1992) and ''[[Miles &amp; Quincy Live at Montreux]]'' (1993), a collaboration with Quincy Jones from the 1991 Montreux Jazz Festival where, for the first time in three decades, he performed songs from ''Miles Ahead'', ''Porgy and Bess'', and ''Sketches of Spain''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ron Wynn |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/r189935 |title=Miles &amp; Quincy Live at Montreux – Miles Davis, Quincy Jones|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=July 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 8, 1991, Davis returned to performing material from his past at the 1991 Montreux Jazz Festival with a band and orchestra conducted by Quincy Jones.{{sfn|The Complete Illustrated History|2007|p=200}} The set consisted of arrangements from his albums recorded with Gil Evans.{{sfn|Cole|2005|p=404}} The show was followed by a concert billed as "Miles and Friends" at the [[Grande halle de la Villette]] in Paris two days later, with guest performances by musicians from throughout his career, including John McLaughlin, Herbie Hancock, and Joe Zawinul.{{sfn|Cole|2005|p=404}} In Paris, he was awarded the [[Legion of Honour|Chevalier of the Legion of Honor]].{{sfn|Cole|2005|p=443}} After returning to America, he stopped in New York City to record material for ''Doo-Bop'', then returned to California to play at the Hollywood Bowl on August 25, his final live performance.{{sfn|The Complete Illustrated History|2007|p=200}}{{sfn|Cole|2005|p=408}}

==Death==
[[File:Sir Miles Davis Gravesite.JPG|thumb|Davis's grave in Woodlawn Cemetery]]
In early September 1991, Davis checked into [[Saint John's Health Center|St. John's Hospital]] near his home in Santa Monica, California, for routine tests.{{sfn|Morton|2005|p=149}} Doctors suggested he have a tracheal tube implanted to relieve his breathing after repeated bouts of [[bronchial pneumonia]]. Their suggestion provoked an outburst from Davis that led to an [[intracerebral hemorrhage]] followed by a coma. After several days on life support, his machine was turned off and he died on September 28, 1991.{{sfn|Morton|2005|p=150}} He was 65 years old. His death was attributed to the combined effects of a stroke, pneumonia, and respiratory failure.&lt;ref name="Miles Davis"/&gt; According to Troupe, Davis was taking [[Zidovudine|azidothymidine]] (AZT), a type of [[antiretroviral drug]] used for the treatment of [[HIV]] and [[AIDS]], during his treatments in hospital.{{sfn|Szwed|2004|p=393}} A funeral service was held on October 5, 1991, at [[St. Peter's Catholic Church (Manhattan)|St. Peter's Church]] in New York City that was attended by around 500 friends, family members, and musical acquaintances, with many fans standing in the rain.{{sfn|Cole|2005|p=409}} He was buried in [[Woodlawn Cemetery (Bronx)|Woodlawn Cemetery]] in [[The Bronx]], New York City, with one of his trumpets, near the site of his idol, [[Duke Ellington]].{{sfn|Davis|Sussman|2006}}{{sfn|Cole|2005|p=409}}

==Views on his earlier work==
Late in his life, from the "electric period" onwards, Davis repeatedly explained his reasons for not wishing to perform his earlier works, such as ''[[Birth of the Cool]]'' or ''[[Kind of Blue]]''. In his view, remaining stylistically static was the wrong option.{{sfn|Davis|Sultanof|2002|pp=2–3}} He commented: {{"'}}So What' or ''Kind of Blue'', they were done in that era, the right hour, the right day, and it happened. It's over&amp;nbsp;... What I used to play with Bill Evans, all those different modes, and substitute chords, we had the energy then and we liked it. But I have no feel for it anymore, it's more like warmed-over turkey."&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Ben Sindran, 1986. Quoted in ''Miles Davis and Bill Evans: Miles and Bill in Black &amp; White'', September 2001, Ashley Kahn, ''[[JazzTimes]]''&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Shirley Horn]] insisted in 1990 that Miles reconsider playing the ballads and modal tunes of his ''Kind of Blue'' period, he demurred. "Nah, it hurts my lip", was the reason he gave.&lt;ref&gt;Interview to Shirley Horn. After 1990. Quoted in ''Miles Davis and Bill Evans: Miles and Bill in Black &amp; White'', September. 2001, Ashley Kahn, ''[[JazzTimes]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other musicians regretted Davis' change of style. [[Bill Evans]], who played piano on ''Kind of Blue'', said, "I would like to hear more of the consummate melodic master, but I feel that big business and his record company have had a corrupting influence on his material. The rock and pop thing certainly draws a wider audience. It happens more and more these days that unqualified people with executive positions try to tell musicians what is good and what is bad music."&lt;ref&gt;Interview to Bill Evans. Late 1970s. Quoted in ''Miles Davis and Bill Evans: Miles and Bill in Black &amp; White'', September. 2001, Ashley Kahn, ''[[JazzTimes]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy and influence==

Miles Davis is considered one of the most innovative, influential, and respected figures in the history of music. ''[[The Guardian]]'' described him as "a pioneer of 20th-century music, leading many of the key developments in the world of jazz."&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Staff|title=Miles Davis voted greatest jazz artist of all time|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/nov/16/miles-davis-voted-greatest-jazz-artist-of-all-time|website=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=June 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been called "one of the great innovators in jazz",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/6zdp |author=Paul Tingen |title=Music – Review of Miles Davis – The Complete Jack Johnson Sessions |publisher=BBC |date=September 30, 2003 |accessdate=July 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had the titles the Prince of Darkness and the Picasso of Jazz bestowed upon him.{{sfn|The Complete Illustrated History|2007|p=8}} ''The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock &amp; Roll'' said, "Miles Davis played a crucial and inevitably controversial role in every major development in jazz since the mid-'40s, and no other jazz musician has had so profound an effect on rock. Miles Davis was the most widely recognized jazz musician of his era, an outspoken social critic and an arbiter of style—in attitude and fashion—as well as music."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/milesdavis/biography |title=Miles Davis Biography |accessdate=January 26, 2009 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090126002444/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/milesdavis/biography |work=[[Rolling Stone]]|archivedate=January 26, 2009 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

William Ruhlmann of [[AllMusic]] wrote, "To examine his career is to examine the history of jazz from the mid-1940s to the early 1990s, since he was in the thick of almost every important innovation and stylistic development in the music during that period&amp;nbsp;... It can even be argued that jazz stopped evolving when Davis wasn't there to push it forward."&lt;ref name="allmusic"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ruhlmann|first1=William|title=Miles Davis Biography|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/miles-davis-mn0000423829/biography|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=June 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Music writer Christopher Smith wrote,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Miles Davis's artistic interest was in the creation and manipulation of ritual space, in which gestures could be endowed with symbolic power sufficient to form a functional communicative, and hence musical, vocabulary.&amp;nbsp;... Miles' performance tradition emphasized orality and the transmission of information and artistic insight from individual to individual. His position in that tradition, and his personality, talents, and artistic interests, impelled him to pursue a uniquely individual solution to the problems and the experiential possibilities of improvised performance.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

His approach, owing largely to the African-American performance tradition that focused on individual expression, emphatic interaction, and creative response to shifting contents, had a profound impact on generations of jazz musicians.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Christopher, "A Sense of the Possible. Miles Davis and the Semiotics of Improvised Performance", ''[[TDR (journal)|TDR]]'', Vol. 39, No. 3 (Autumn 1995), pp. 41–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Miles Davis Way, NYC IMG 5819.JPG|thumb|The westernmost part of 77th Street in New York City has been named Miles Davis Way. He once lived on the block.]]

''Kind of Blue'' remains the best-selling jazz album of all time. On November 5, 2009, U.S. Representative [[John Conyers]] of Michigan sponsored a measure in the United States House of Representatives to commemorate the album on its 50th anniversary. The measure also affirms jazz as a national treasure and "encourages the United States government to preserve and advance the art form of jazz music."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iUiZ2PQojIOgYW99dtMTcpluXfmwD9CJTRPO0|title=House honors Miles Davis' "Kind of Blue" |accessdate=December 21, 2009 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091221173335/http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iUiZ2PQojIOgYW99dtMTcpluXfmwD9CJTRPO0 |agency=Associated Press|date=December 15, 2009|archivedate=December 21, 2009 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; It passed with a vote of 409–0 on December 15, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2009/roll971.xml |title=House Resolution H.RES.894 |publisher=Clerk.house.gov |date=December 15, 2009 |accessdate=July 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trumpet Davis used on the recording is displayed on the campus of the University of North Carolina at Greensboro.

In 1986, the [[New England Conservatory]] awarded Davis an [[honorary degree|Honorary Doctorate]] for his contributions to music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://necmusic.edu/about-nec/awards-honors/nec-honorary-doctor-music-degree |title=NEC Honorary Doctor of Music Degree |accessdate=July 20, 2011 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720015522/http://necmusic.edu/about-nec/awards-honors/nec-honorary-doctor-music-degree |publisher=New England Conservatory|archivedate=July 20, 2011 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1960 the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences ([[National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences|NARAS]]) honored him with eight Grammy Awards, a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, and three Grammy Hall of Fame Awards.

In 2001 a two-hour documentary film by [[Mike Dibb]] entitled ''The Miles Davis Story'' won an [[International Emmy Award]] for arts documentary of the year.&lt;ref name="Deans"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Deans|first1=Jason|title=Norton in Emmy triumph| url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2001/nov/20/broadcasting|website=The Guardian|accessdate=11 May 2018|date=20 November 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert William Bishop''' (born July 13, 1951) is the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|UT|1}}, and Chairman of the [[United States House Committee on Natural Resources|House Natural Resources Committee]] serving since 2003. He is a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].

==Early life, education, and early career==
Bishop was born in [[Kaysville, Utah|Kaysville]], [[Utah]] and graduated from [http://www.davis.k12.ut.us/Domain/7528 Davis High School]. He served as a [[Mormon missionary]] in [[Germany]] from 1970 until 1972. Bishop received a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[political science]] from the [[University of Utah]] in [[Salt Lake City]] in 1974.  He taught civics classes at [[Brigham City, Utah|Brigham City]]'s [[Box Elder High School]] from 1974 to 1980; he next taught [[German language|German]] in [[Ogden, Utah|Ogden]], Utah at [[Ben Lomond High School]]; then he returned to teaching [[government]] and [[history]] classes at Box Elder High School until his retirement from teaching in 2002.&lt;ref name=RobBishopBio&gt;{{cite web|title=Rob Bishop Congressional Bio|url=http://robbishop.house.gov/Biography/|archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20070530204600/http://robbishop.house.gov/Biography/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2007-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; While a teacher at Box Elder, Bishop partnered with the [[Close Up Foundation]] to help students participate in Close Up's [[Washington, D.C.]] based civic education programs. He remains actively involved in the program and works to ensure that Utah students have the opportunity to visit Washington, D.C.

==Early political career==
Bishop was a member of the [[Utah House of Representatives]] from 1978 to 1994.  He was House Majority Leader and later served as Speaker of the House from 1992 until 1994.  After his retirement from the state legislature, Bishop returned to Box Elder High School and taught [[Advanced Placement|advanced placement]] courses while chairing the history department.

In 1997 he was elected chairman of the [[Utah Republican Party]], and served for two terms in this position. He has also worked as a legislative lobbyist in Washington.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
In 2002, Bishop returned to politics when he ran for the Republican nomination in the 1st District.  22-year incumbent [[James V. Hansen|Jim Hansen]] had recently announced his retirement.  At the state Republican convention, he finished first in the seven-candidate field and went on to face State Representative [[Kevin Garn]] in a primary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=217675|title=Our Campaigns - UT District 1 - R Convention Race|accessdate=7 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He defeated Garn in that primary with 59.8 percent of the vote, all but assuring him of being the next congressman from this heavily Republican district.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Campaigns - UT District 1 - R Primary Race|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=27465|accessdate=7 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As expected, he won the general election with 61% of the vote. He has won re-election in 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010, and 2012 with even larger margins. In 2014, he was reelected with 64% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fahys|first1=Judy|title=Replican Bishop Returns to Congress in 1st District|url=http://kuer.org/post/republican-bishop-returns-congress-1st-district|accessdate=20 November 2014|agency=KUER 90.1|publisher=NPR|date=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tenure===
As a teacher, he has made education related issues a top priority. He is a strong advocate for increased local control of schools.  He opposes [[No Child Left Behind]] and supports [[school vouchers]]. He was also a co-sponsor of a proposed amendment to guarantee a balanced federal budget.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

In 2016 Bishop led drafting efforts on legislation to address the [[Puerto Rican government-debt crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A New Libor Trial and Fed Leaders Onstage |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=February 6, 2017 |date=April 4, 2016 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/04/business/a-new-libor-trial-trade-data-and-fed-leaders-onstage.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Calmes |first=Jackie |title=Treasury Chief Puts a Face on Puerto Rico's Debt Crisis |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 10, 2016 |accessdate=February 6, 2017 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/10/business/dealbook/treasury-secretary-jacob-lew-puts-a-face-on-puerto-rico-debt-crisis.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2016 election cycle, 92.6% of contributions to Bishop's political campaign came from outside Utah, the highest out-of-state percentage of any member of the House, with much of the contributions coming from the energy and agribusiness sectors, according to an analysis by the [[Center for Responsive Politics]].&lt;ref name=npr20170205/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=For campaign cash, many lawmakers use a big map; Rob Bishop nears 93 percent out-of-state |first=Emma |last=Baccellieri |date=July 8, 2016 |publisher=[[Center for Responsive Politics]] |accessdate=February 5, 2017 |url=https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2016/07/for-campaign-cash-many-lawmakers-use-a-big-map-rob-bishop-tops-the-out-of-state-list/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Federalism ====

In 2010 Bishop introduced to the House an amendment to the [[United States Constitution]], known as the "repeal amendment,"  which would allow a majority vote of the states to overturn any act of the [[United States Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Zernike |first=Kate |authorlink=Kate Zernike |title=Proposed Amendment would Enable States to Repeal Federal Law |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 20, 2010 |accessdate=February 6, 2017 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/20/us/politics/20states.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Land use and the environment ====

Bishop supports repeal of the [[Endangered Species Act of 1973]], saying it has been "hijacked" to control land and block economic development, and that he "would love to invalidate" the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=GOP Wants to Change Endangered Species Act |date=January 17, 2017 |agency=[[Associated Press]] |publisher=[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]] |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Environment/2017/0118/Endangered-Species-Act-get-ready-for-big-changes-says-GOP |accessdate=February 5, 2017 |first1=Matthew |first2=Matthew |last1=Brown |last2=Daly }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/c4809b5e9f4641ffa45e09b390030293|title=GOP targets landmark Endangered Species Act for big changes|work=The Big Story|access-date=2017-03-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bishop is among those most critical of the [[Antiquities Act]].&lt;ref name=npr20170205&gt;{{cite news |title=Utah Representative Wants Bears Ears Gone And He Wants Trump To Do It |date=February 5, 2017 |first=Kirk |last=Siegler |authorlink=Kirk Siegler |accessdate=February 5, 2017 |url=https://www.npr.org/2017/02/05/513492389/utah-representative-wants-bears-ears-gone-and-he-wants-trump-to-do-it |publisher=[[NPR]] |work=[[Weekend Edition]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bishop opposed the designation of the [[Bears Ears National Monument]] and supports repealing or shrinking the designation.&lt;ref name=npr20170205/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Davenport |first=Coral |title=Obama Designates Monuments in Nevada and Utah |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 29, 2016 |accessdate=February 5, 2017 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/28/us/politics/obama-national-monument-bears-ears-utah-gold-butte.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bishop supports transferring federal public lands to the states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Congress moves to give away national lands, discounting billions in revenue |first=Heather |last=Hansman |date=January 19, 2017 |accessdate=February 5, 2017 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jan/19/bureau-land-management-federal-lease}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2011, Bishop introduced a budget amendment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://robbishop.house.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=225394|title=Bishop Introduces Amendment to Defund National Landscape Conservation System|date=16 February 2011|accessdate=5 July 2011}}{{Self-published source|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; that would have defunded the [[National Landscape Conservation System]], which manages 27 million acres of [[Bureau of Land Management]] land, including the [[U.S. National Monument|National Monument]], [[National Conservation Area]], [[National Wilderness Preservation System|National Wilderness Preservation]], [[National Wild and Scenic Rivers]], [[National Scenic Trail]], [[National Historic Trail]] systems and other systems. After coming under fire for introducing this amendment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Groups blast Bishop over 'gutting' landscape conservation |first=Amy Joi |last=O'Donoghue |url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/705366847/Groups-blast-Bishop-over-gutting-landscape-conservation.html |accessdate=July 5, 2011 |date=February 16, 2011 |newspaper=[[Deseret News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bishop withdrew it.

On April 10, 2013, Bishop introduced the [[Ensuring Public Involvement in the Creation of National Monuments Act]]. The bill would amend the [[Antiquities Act of 1906]] to subject [[National Monument (United States)|national monument]] declarations by the President to the [[National Environmental Policy Act of 1969]] (NEPA).&lt;ref name="1459sum"&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 1459 – Summary|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/1459|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=24 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At present, the [[President of the United States]] can unilaterally designate areas of federally-owned land as a national monument, whereas national parks and other areas are required to be enacted into law by the [[United States Congress]].&lt;ref name="IBTjohanson"&gt;{{cite news|last=Johanson|first=Mark|title=GOP Bill Could Mean 'No More National Parks,' Public Land Advocates Warn|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/gop-bill-could-mean-no-more-national-parks-public-land-advocates-warn-1563152|accessdate=24 March 2014|newspaper=International Business Times|date=24 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bishop argued that "the American people deserve the opportunity to participate in land-use decisions regardless of whether they are made in Congress or by the President". He claims his new bill would ensure "that new national monuments are created openly with consideration of public input".&lt;ref name="IBTjohanson" /&gt;

In 1949, Angers graduated from the [[Command and General Staff College]] in [[Fort Leavenworth, Kansas]].&lt;ref name=dlb/&gt;

==Journalism career==

Angers began his journalism career upon graduation from [[LSU]] with his hometown ''Abbeville Progress''. After wartime service, he became in 1945 the advertising manager in 1945 of the ''Weekly Iberian'' and ''New Iberia Enterprise''. With his father and brother, Allen, Angers co-owned Angers Real Estate Agency in New Iberia from 1946–1950, when he became the [[newspaper publisher|publisher]] of the ''[[Franklin Banner-Tribune]]'' in [[Franklin, Louisiana|Franklin]], the seat of [[St. Mary Parish, Louisiana|St. Mary Parish]]. During his fifteen years at the ''Banner-Tribune'', the newspaper converted from a weekly to a daily publication and won 150 state and national press association awards.&lt;ref name=dlb/&gt;

In 1961, Angers co-founded with future [[Lafayette, Louisiana|Lafayette]] [[Mayor]] [[Kenny Bowen]], Angers, Bowen and Associates public relations firm in Lafayette He sold his interest to Bowen in 1962. From 1966-1968, Angers was an editorial writer and columnist of the ''[[Lafayette Daily Advertiser]]''. He founded the ''Jeanerette Weekly Journal'' (1964–1965), ''Southwest Louisiana Capitalist'' (1963), and ''[[Acadiana Profile]]'' magazine (1968), which covers twenty-two [[South Louisiana]] parishes and is the longest-running still active magazine in Louisiana history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acadianhouse.com/acadianaprofilemagazine/ |title=''Acadiana Profile'': The Magazine of the Cajun Country |publisher=acadianaprofilemagazine |accessdate=January 28, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011235349/http://www.acadianhouse.com/acadianaprofilemagazine/ |archivedate=October 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Assisted by his wife, Angers edited and published ''Acadiana Profile'' from 1968–1985, when his son took over the management.&lt;ref name=lda&gt;"Business Editor Bob Angers dies", ''Lafayette Daily Advertiser'', October 14, 1988, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; His last job in journalism was again at the ''Lafayette Daily Advertiser'' as business editor from 1985 until his death in 1988.

Willis]] of [[St. Martinville, Louisiana|St. Martinville]]. Angers received 31,806 votes (37.7 percent) to Willis's 52,532 (62.3 percent) and lost every parish in the district. In [[Lafayette Parish]], Angers procured 49.6 percent of the vote and outpolled Goldwater there by 3.5 percentage points. Three other Republicans ran unsuccessfully for U.S. House seats from Louisiana that year: future [[Governor of Louisiana|Governor]] [[David C. Treen]] in the New Orleans suburbs, Floyd O. Crawford (1907–1995) of Baton Rouge, and [[William Stewart Walker]] of [[Winnfield, Louisiana|Winnfield]], who opposed the conservative Democrat [[Speedy O.

'''Rufus King''' (March 24, 1755{{spaced ndash}}April 29, 1827) was an American lawyer, politician, and diplomat. He was a delegate for [[Massachusetts]] to the [[Continental Congress]] and the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Philadelphia Convention]] and was one of the signers of the [[United States Constitution]] in 1787. After formation of the new [[United States Congress|Congress]] he represented [[New York (state)|New York]] in the [[United States Senate]]. He emerged as a leading member of the [[Federalist Party]], serving as the party's last presidential nominee in the [[United States presidential election, 1816|1816 presidential election]].

The son of a prosperous Massachusetts merchant, King studied law before volunteering for the militia in the [[American Revolutionary War]]. He won election to the [[Massachusetts General Court]] in 1783 and to the [[Congress of the Confederation]] the following year. At the 1787 Philadelphia Convention, he emerged as a leading nationalist, calling for increased powers for the federal government. After the convention, King returned to Massachusetts, where he used his influence to help win ratification of the new Constitution. At the urging of [[Alexander Hamilton]], he then abandoned his law practice and moved to [[New York City]].

He won election to represent [[New York (state)|New York]] in the United States Senate in 1789, remaining in office until 1796. That year, he accepted President [[George Washington]]'s appointment to the position of [[United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom|Minister]] to [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]]. Though King aligned with Hamilton's Federalists, [[Democratic-Republican Party|Democratic-Republican]] President [[Thomas Jefferson]] retained his services after Jefferson's victory in the [[United States presidential election, 1800|1800 presidential election]]. King served as the Federalist vice presidential candidate in the [[United States presidential election, 1804|1804]] and [[United States presidential election, 1808|1808 elections]], running on an unsuccessful ticket with [[Charles Cotesworth Pinckney]] of South Carolina. Though most Federalists supported Democratic-Republican [[DeWitt Clinton]] in the [[United States presidential election, 1812|1812 presidential election]], King, without the support of his party, won little votes of those Federalists who were unwilling to support Clinton's candidacy. In 1813, he returned to the Senate and remained in office until 1825.

King was the informal de facto Federalist nominee for president in [[United States presidential election, 1816|1816]], losing in a landslide to [[James Monroe]]. The Federalist Party became defunct at the national level after 1816, and King was the last presidential nominee the party fielded. Nonetheless, King was able to remain in the Senate until 1825, making him the last Federalist senator, due to a split in the New York Democratic-Republican Party. After that King accepted [[John Quincy Adams]]'s appointment to serve another term as ambassador to Britain, but ill health forced King to retire from public life, and he died in 1827. King had five children who lived to adulthood, and he has numerous notable descendants.

==Biography==

===Early life===
He was born on March 24, 1755, at [[Scarborough, Maine|Scarborough]], which was then a part of [[Massachusetts]] but is now in the state of [[Maine]].&lt;ref name="Knopf Doubleday Publishing"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Passos|first1=John Dos|title=The Men Who Made the Nation: Architects of the Young Republic 1782–1802|date=2011|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing|location=New York|page=480}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a son of Isabella (Bragdon) and Richard King, a prosperous farmer-merchant, "lumberman, and sea captain"&lt;ref name="Knopf Doubleday Publishing"/&gt; who had settled at Dunstan Landing in Scarborough, near [[Portland, Maine]], and had made a modest fortune by 1755, the year Rufus was born. His financial success aroused the jealousy of his neighbors, and when the [[Stamp Act 1765]] was imposed, and rioting became almost respectable, a mob ransacked his house and destroyed most of the furniture.  Nobody was punished, and the next year the mob burned down his barn.&lt;ref name="Ernst1–15"&gt;Ernst, pp. 1–15.&lt;/ref&gt; This statement proves true as John Adams once referenced this moment discussing limitations of the "mob" for the Constitutional Convention writing a letter to his wife Abigail and describing the scene as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I am engaged in a famous Cause: The Cause of King, of Scarborough vs. a Mob, that broke into his House, and  rifled his Papers, and terrifyed him, his Wife, Children and Servants in the Night. The Terror, and Distress, the Distraction and Horror of this Family cannot be described by Words or painted upon Canvass. It is enough to move a Statue, to melt an Heart of Stone, to read the Story....&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Adams|first1=John|authorlink=John Adams|title=John Adams to Abigail Adams, 7 July 1774|url=https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Adams/04-01-02-0088|website=Founders Online|publisher=National Archives and Records Administration|accessdate=2 February 2015|format=Web|date=July 7, 1774}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not surprising that Richard King became a loyalist. All of his sons, however, became patriots in the American War of Independence.&lt;ref name="Ernst1–15"&gt;Ernst, pp. 1–15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Education, career and  early politics===
King attended Dummer Academy (now [[The Governor's Academy]]) at the age of twelve, located in South Byfield, MA.&lt;ref name="Archives.gov"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Founding Fathers: Massachusetts|url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_founding_fathers_massachusetts.html|website=The Charters of Freedom|publisher=Archives.gov|accessdate=February 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later on he attended [[Harvard University|Harvard College]], where he graduated in 1777.&lt;ref name="Steven E. Siry 2000"&gt;Steven E. Siry. "King, Rufus"; ''[[American National Biography Online]]'', February 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; He began to [[read law]] under [[Theophilus Parsons]], but his studies were interrupted in 1778 when King volunteered for [[militia (United States)|militia]] duty in the [[American Revolutionary War]]. Appointed a major, he served as an aide to General Sullivan
&lt;ref name="Archives.gov"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.colonialhall.com/king/king.php |title=Biography of Rufus King |author=John Vinci |year=2008 |publisher=Colonialhall.com |accessdate=November 22, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Battle of Rhode Island]].
&lt;ref name="Steven E. Siry 2000"/&gt;
After the campaign, King returned to his apprenticeship under Parsons. He was admitted to the bar in 1780 and began a legal practice in [[Newburyport, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name="Archives.gov"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Purvis214/&gt; King was first elected to the [[Massachusetts General Court]] in 1783, and returned there each year until 1785. [[Massachusetts]] sent him to the [[Confederation Congress]] from 1784 to 1787.&lt;ref name="Archives.gov"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KING, Rufus, 1755–1827"&gt;{{cite web|title=King, Rufus, (1755–1827)|url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=k000212|website=Biographical Directory of the United States Congress|publisher=Congress|accessdate=February 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of the youngest at the conference.

===Politics (Constitutional Convention)===
In 1787, King was sent to the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]] held at Philadelphia. King held a significant position at the convention. Despite his youthful stature, "he numbered among the most capable orators". Along with James Madison, "he became a leading figure in the nationalist causus". Furthermore, he attended every session. King's "views underwent a startling transformation during the debates" originally changing a mindset supporting Articles of Confederation and utterly throwing out the idea that it could be sustained.&lt;ref name="Archives.gov"/&gt; King's major involvements included serving on the Committee on ''Postponed Matters'' and the ''Committee of Style and Arrangement.''&lt;ref name="Archives.gov"/&gt;  Although he came to the convention unconvinced that major changes should be made in the Articles of Confederation, his views underwent a startling transformation during the debates.&lt;ref name="Archives.gov"/&gt; He worked with Chairman [[William Samuel Johnson]], [[James Madison]], [[Gouverneur Morris]], and [[Alexander Hamilton]] on the Committee of Style and Arrangement to prepare a final draft of the [[United States Constitution]].  King is one of the more prominent delegates namely because of playing "a major role in the laborious crafting of the fundamental governing character.&lt;ref name="Greenwood Publishing Group"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morton|first1=Joseph C.|title=Shapers of the Great Debate at the Constitutional Convention of 1787: A Biographical Dictionary|date=2006|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|location=Berkeley|page=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; The constitution was signed on September 17, only  needing to be ratified by each of the subsequent states.&lt;ref name="Greenwood Publishing Group"/&gt; After signing the Constitution, he returned home and went to work to get the Constitution ratified and unsuccessfully position himself to be named to the U.S. Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morton|first1=Joseph C.|title=Shapers of the Great Debate at the Constitutional Convention of 1787: A Biographical Dictionary|date=2006|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|location=Berkeley|pages=160–61}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ratification passed by the narrow margin of 187–168 votes.&lt;ref name="Greenwood Publishing Group"/&gt; With the ratification passed, Massachusetts "became the sixth state to ratify [the] constitution in early February 1788.&lt;ref name="Greenwood Publishing Group"/&gt; Rufus is indirectly responsible for the passing of this ratification seeing that his "learned, informative, and persuasive speeches" were able to convince a "popular, vain merchant and prince-turned-politicians to abandon his anti-federalism and approve the new organic law".&lt;ref name="Greenwood Publishing Group"/&gt;

===Politics (post-Constitutional Convention)===
After his early political experiences during the constitutional convention, King decided to switch his vocational calling by "[abandoning] his law practice [in 1788], [and] moved from the Bay State to Gotham, and entered the New York political forum".&lt;ref name="Archives.gov"/&gt; At Hamilton's urging, he moved to New York City, and was elected to the [[New York State Assembly]] in 1789.&lt;ref name="KING, Rufus, 1755–1827"/&gt; Shortly afterwards he was elected as [[United States Senate elections in New York, 1789|Senator from New York]] and reelected in [[United States Senate election in New York, 1795|1795]]. In 1795, King helped Hamilton defend the controversial [[Jay Treaty]] by writing pieces for New York newspapers under the pseudonym "Camillus." Of the thirty eight installments in the series, King wrote eight, numbers 23–30, 34, and 35, discussing the treaty's maritime and commercial aspects.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Ernst, ''Rufus King: American Federalist'', Chapel Hill, North Carolina: The University of North Carolina Press, 1968, p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt; He was re-elected in [[United States Senate election in New York, 1795|1795]] but resigned on May 23, 1796, having been appointed [[United States Ambassador to Great Britain|U. S. Minister]] by George Washington to [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]].&lt;ref name="Archives.gov"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KING, Rufus, 1755–1827"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morton|first1=Joseph C.|title=Shapers of the Great Debate at the Constitutional Convention of 1787: A Biographical Dictionary|date=2006|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|location=Berkeley|page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Even though King was an outspoken Federalist politically, Republican President Thomas Jefferson, upon his elevation to the presidency, refused to recall him. In 1803, King voluntarily relinquished...." this position.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

King then returned to elected politics, for a long time with little success, but later he returned to the Senate. In April 1804, King ran unsuccessfully for the [[United States Senate special election in New York, November 1804|Senate from New York]]. Later that [[United States presidential election, 1804|year]], and again in [[United States presidential election, 1808|1808]], King and fellow-signer [[Charles Cotesworth Pinckney]] were the candidates for Vice President and President of the declining Federalist Party, respectively, but had no realistic chance against Democratic Republican [[Thomas Jefferson]] with only 27.2% of the popular vote, losing by 45.6%, marking the highest recess in Presidential election history. In 1808 both candidates were renominated and lost against [[James Madison]], gaining 32.4% this time.&lt;ref name="Archives.gov"/&gt;

In September 1812, when the unpopular [[War of 1812]] against Great Britain helped the opposing Federalists to regain reputation, King led an effort at the Federalist party caucus to nominate a Federalist ticket for the [[United States presidential election, 1812|presidential election]] that year, but the effort failed, as Democratic Republican [[DeWitt Clinton]] had the best chances to defeat his fellow party member Madison, which made the Federalists field no candidate. However, some sought to make King the nominee, in order to have a candidate under the Federalist banner on the ballot, and though little came of it, he did finish third in the popular vote with approximately 2% of the total. Shortly thereafter, King celebrated his first success after 10 years, when he was elected to his "second tenure on Senate" in 1813.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In April 1816 he [[New York gubernatorial election, 1816|ran for Governor]] of New York and lost to [[Daniel D. Tompkins]]. In the fall of that year, he did become the informal presidential nominee for the Federalist Party, as they did not meet for any convention. He only received 30.9% and lost again, this time to [[James Monroe]], whose running mate, coincidentally, was Tompkins.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; King would be the last presidential candidate by the Federalists before their collapse. When he ran for re-election to the Senate in [[United States Senate election in New York, 1819/1820|1819]], he ran as a Federalist even though the party was already disbanding and had only a small minority in the [[New York State Legislature]]. But, due to the split of the Democratic-Republicans, no successor was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1819, and the seat remained vacant until January 1820. Trying to attract the former Federalist voters to their side at the next gubernatorial election in April 1820, both factions of the Democratic-Republican Party now supported King, who served another term in the U.S. Senate until March 4, 1825. At the time the Federalist Party had already ceased to exist on the federal stage. During his second tenure in the Senate, he continued his career as an opponent of slavery, which he denounced as anathema to the principles underlying the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. In what is considered the greatest speech of his career, he spoke against admitting Missouri as a slave state in 1820.

Soon after his second term in the Senate ended, King was appointed Minister to Great Britain again, this time by President [[John Quincy Adams]]. But he was forced to return home a few months later due to failing health. He subsequently retired from public life.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Diplomat===
[[File:Rufus King Minister Britain (JQA).JPG|thumb|alt= |King's nomination to be Minister to the UK (1825)]]
King played a major diplomatic role as Minister to the Court of St. James from 1796 to 1803, and again from 1825 to 1826.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morton|first1=Joseph C.|title=Shapers of the Great Debate at the Constitutional Convention of 1787: A Biographical Dictionary|date=2006|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|location=Berkeley|pages=161–62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he was a leading Federalist, [[Thomas Jefferson]] kept him in office until King asked to be relieved.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Some prominent accomplishments that King had from his time as a national diplomat include a term of friendly relations with Britain and the United States (at least until it became hostile in 1805).&lt;ref name="Archives.gov"/&gt; With that in mind, he was able to successfully reach a compromise on the passing of the [[Jay Treaty]] being an avid supporter of it.&lt;ref name="Archives.gov"/&gt; King was outspoken against potential Irish immigration to the United States in wake of the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]]. In a September 13, 1798 letter to the [[Duke of Portland]], King said of potential Irish refugees, "I certainly do not think they will be a desirable acquisition to any Nation, but in none would they be likely to prove more mischievous than in mine, where from the sameness of language and similarity of Laws and Institutions they have greater opportunities of propagating their principles than in any other Country."&lt;ref&gt;Robert Ernst, ''Rufus King: American Federalist'', Chapel Hill, North Carolina: The University of North Carolina Press, 1968, p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, while in Britain, he was in close personal contact with South American revolutionary [[Francisco de Miranda]] and facilitated Miranda's trip to the United States in search of support for his failed 1806 expedition to [[Venezuela]].

===Anti-slavery activity===
[[File:Rufus King by Peale.jpg|thumb|left| Oil painting of King by [[Charles Willson Peale]] (1818)]]
King had a long history of opposition to the expansion of slavery and the slave trade. This stand was a product of moral conviction which coincided with the political realities of New England federalism. While in Congress, he successfully added provisions to the 1787 [[Northwest Ordinance]] which barred the extension of slavery into the [[Northwest Territory]].
&lt;ref name=Purvis214&gt;{{Cite book|last=Purvis |first=Thomas L. |title=A Dictionary of American History |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=556-YcjJYhkC&amp;pg=PA214 |accessdate=November 23, 2011 |year=1997 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |isbn=978-1-57718-099-9 |page=214 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
But he also said he was willing "to suffer the continuance of slaves until they can be gradually emancipated in states already overrun with them." He did not press the issue very hard at this time. At the Constitutional Convention, he indicated that his opposition to slavery was based upon the political and economic advantages it gave to the South, but he was willing to compromise for political reasons.
In 1817, he supported Senate action to abolish the domestic slave trade and, in 1819, spoke strongly for the antislavery amendment to the [[Missouri]] statehood bill. In 1819, his arguments were political, economic, and humanitarian; the extension of slavery would adversely affect the security of the principles of freedom and liberty. After the [[Missouri Compromise]], he continued to support gradual emancipation in various ways.
&lt;ref&gt;Arbena{{page needed|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Library===
At the time of his death in 1827, King had a library of roughly 2,200 titles in 3,500 volumes.  In addition, King had roughly 200 bound volumes containing thousands of pamphlets. King's son John Alsop King inherited the library and kept them in Jamaica, Queens, until his death in 1867. The books then went to John's son Dr. Charles Ray King of Bucks County, Pennsylvania.  They remained in Pennsylvania until donated to the New-York Historical Society in 1906, where most of them currently reside.  Some books have extensive [[marginalia]].  In addition, six commonplace books survive in his papers at the New-York Historical Society.

===Other accomplishments===
In his lifetime, King had been an avid supporter of Hamilton and his Fiscal programs and unsurprisingly that he would find himself also become one of the directors of the Hamilton-sponsored [[First Bank of the United States]].&lt;ref name="Archives.gov"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Among other prominent things that occurred in King's life, he was first elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1805,&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter K|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterK.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=July 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was also elected a member of the [[American Antiquarian Society]] in 1814.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanantiquarian.org/memberlistk American Antiquarian Society Members Directory]&lt;/ref&gt;
Contrary to his previous position on the national bank of the United States, King found himself denying the reopening of a [[Second Bank of the United States|Second National Bank]] in 1816.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
Finally, in 1822, he was admitted as an honorary member of the New York [[Society of the Cincinnati]].

===Family===
[[File:Coat of Arms of Rufus King.svg|175px|thumb|left|Coat of Arms of Rufus King]]
Many of King's family were also involved in politics and he had a number of prominent descendants. His brother [[William King (governor)|William King]] was the first governor of [[Maine]] and a prominent merchant, and his other brother, [[Cyrus King]], was a [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] from Massachusetts.

His wife Mary Alsop was born in New York on October 17, 1769, and died in Jamaica, New York, on June 5, 1819. She was the only daughter of [[John Alsop]], a wealthy merchant and a delegate for New York to the [[Continental Congress]] from 1774 to 1776.&lt;ref name="Rrowman &amp; Littlefield"&gt;{{cite book|last1=McKenney|first1=Janice E.|title=Women of the Constitution: Wives of the Signers|date=2012|publisher=Rrowman &amp; Littlefield|location=Lanham|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was also a great niece of Governor [[John Winthrop]] of the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]]. She married Mr. King in New York City on March 30, 1786, he being at that time a delegate from Massachusetts to the [[Congress of the Confederation]] then sitting in that city.&lt;ref name="Rrowman &amp; Littlefield"/&gt;
[[File:Mrs. Rufus King, (Mary Alsop) (NYPL Hades-254212-EM13199).tiff|thumb|Mrs. Rufus King, (Mary Alsop)]]
Mrs. King was a lady of remarkable beauty, gentle and gracious manners, and well cultivated mind, and adorned the high station, both in England and at home, that her husband's official positions and their own social relations entitled them to occupy.&lt;ref name="Rrowman &amp; Littlefield"/&gt; A King family member once wrote to their wife of Mrs. King's beauty and personality as, "'Tell Betsy King [Rufus's half-sister] her sister is a beauty. She is vastly the best looking woman I have seen since I have been in this city....She is a good hearted woman, and, I think, possesses all that Benevolence and kind, friendly disposition, that never fail to find respectable admirers'".&lt;ref name="Rrowman &amp; Littlefield"/&gt; As mentioned earlier her "remarkable beauty" and "well cultivated manner" seems to help the Kings in the type of lifestyle they lives, one where the Kings found themselves in "fashionable circles and entertained frequently" ... (potentially helped by how "[Mrs. King] was widely admired in New York society; her retiring nature set her apart.").&lt;ref name="Rrowman &amp; Littlefield"/&gt; The Kings found themselves having 7 children (of which 5 managed to live to adulthood).&lt;ref name="Rrowman &amp; Littlefield"/&gt; On June 5, 1819, Mrs. King died. "She was buried in the old churchyard of Grace Church". Rufus King remarked on her death regarding his wife, "The example of her life is worthy of the imitation of us all".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McKenney|first1=Janice E.|title=Women of the Constitution: Wives of the Signers|date=2012|publisher=Rrowman &amp; Littlefield|location=Lanham|page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rufus King died on April 29, 1827, and his funeral was held at his New York home in [[Jamaica, Queens]]. He is buried in the [[Grace Episcopal Church Complex (Queens, New York)|Grace Church Cemetery]] in Jamaica, [[Queens]], New York.
&lt;ref&gt;{{FAG|6473810}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The home that King purchased in 1805 and expanded thereafter and some of his farm make up King Park in Queens. The home, called [[King Manor]], is now a museum and is open to the public.

The Rufus King School, also known as P.S. 26, in [[Fresh Meadows, New York]], was named after King, as was the Rufus King Hall on the [[CUNY]] [[Queens College]] campus and King Street&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/odd/archives/002071.asp |title=Origins of Madison Street Names |author=Wisconsin Historical Society |authorlink=Wisconsin Historical Society |year=2011 |publisher=Wisconsinhistory.org  |accessdate=November 22, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Madison, Wisconsin]].

Confusingly, Rufus King International School – High School Campus, formerly [[Rufus King High School]], in [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]], is named after his grandson, [[Rufus King (general)|Rufus King]], a general in the [[American Civil War]].

She completed her first degree at [[Adelaide University]] and doctoral research at the Centre for Critical and Cultural Theory, [[Cardiff University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://assets.cambridge.org/97805215/92253/frontmatter/9780521592253_frontmatter.pdf|title=Differences That Matter|last=|first=|date=1998|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Ahmed was based at the Institute for [[Women's studies|Women’s Studies]] at [[Lancaster University]] from 1994 to 2004, and is one of its former directors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/fass/centres/gws/people.htm|title=People - Centre for Gender and Womens' Studies, Lancaster University, UK|website=www.lancaster.ac.uk|access-date=2016-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was appointed to the Department of Media and Communications at [[Goldsmiths College, University of London]] in 2004, and was the inaugural director of its Centre for Feminist Research, which was set up 'to consolidate Goldsmiths' feminist histories and to help shape feminist futures at Goldsmiths.' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gold.ac.uk/centre-for-feminist-research/|title=Centre for Feminist Research|access-date=2016-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spring 2009 Ahmed was the Laurie New Jersey Chair in Women’s Studies at [[Rutgers University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://womens-studies.rutgers.edu/images/stories/Newsletters/Spring_2009.pdf|title=Spring Newsletter 2009|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in Lent 2013 she was the Diane Middlebrook and Carl Djerassi Professor in Gender Studies at Cambridge University, where she conducted research on "Willful Women: Feminism and a History of Will".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gender.cam.ac.uk/academicvisitors/vpfolder/vps|title=Cambridge Gender Studies|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 she was the keynote speaker at the National Women's Studies Association annual conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ansonkochrein.wordpress.com/2015/11/08/nwsa-conference-2015/|title=NWSA Conference 2015|last=Koch-Rein|first=Anson|date=2015-11-09|website=Anson Koch-Rein, PhD|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161014065450/https://ansonkochrein.wordpress.com/2015/11/08/nwsa-conference-2015/|archivedate=14 October 2016|deadurl=yes|access-date=2016-09-22|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 Ahmed resigned from her post at Goldsmiths in protest over the alleged sexual harassment of students by staff there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/london-university-goldsmiths-professor-quits-sexual-harassment-female-students-staff-a7072131.html/|title=London university professor quits over sexual harassment of female students by staff|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=2017-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has indicated that she will continue her work as an independent scholar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://feministkilljoys.com/about/|title=Feministkilljoys|last=Ahmed|first=Sara|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She blogs at feministkilljoys, a project she continues to update.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ahmed|first1=Sara|title=feministkilljoys|url=https://feministkilljoys.com|website=feministkilljoys|publisher=wordpress.org|accessdate=16 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The blog is a companion to her book "Living a Feminist Life" (2017) that enables her to reach people; posts become chapters and the book becomes blogging material. The term "feminist killjoy" "became a communication device, a way of reaching people who recognized in her something of their own experience."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://lithub.com/sara-ahmed-once-we-find-each-other-so-much-else-becomes-possible/|title=Sara Ahmed: "Once We Find Each Other, So Much Else Becomes Possible" {{!}} Literary  Hub|website=lithub.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

==Works==
Ahmed has been described as a prolific writer. One reviewer of her work commented, "Few academic writers working in the UK context today can match Sara Ahmed in her prolific output, and fewer still can maintain the consistently high level of her theoretical explorations.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shildrick|first=Margrit|date=2009|title=Review, Queer Phenomenology|url=|journal=International Journal of Philosophical Studies|volume=17|issue=4|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ahmed has written eight single-authored books.

Ahmed often focuses on the subject of orientation and being orientated in space, especially in relationship to sexual orientation. In her book ''Queer Phenomenology: Orientation, Objects, Others'' Ahmed states that orientation refers to the objects and others that we turn to face as well as the space that we inhabit, and how it is that we inhabit that space. Ahmed brings together queer phenomenology as a way of conveying that orientation is situated in the lived experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/68192277|title=Queer phenomenology : orientations, objects, others|last=1969-|first=Ahmed, Sara,|date=2006|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=0822338610|location=Durham|oclc=68192277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Seinfeld''''' is&lt;!-- Do not change to "was" as fiction is written in present tense and remains as "is" per Wikipedia convention. See: [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Television/Style guidelines#Lead paragraphs]]. --&gt; an American television [[sitcom]] that ran for nine seasons on [[NBC]], from 1989 to 1998. It was created by [[Larry David]] and [[Jerry Seinfeld]], with the latter starring as [[Jerry Seinfeld (character)|a fictionalized version of himself]]. Set predominantly in an apartment building in [[Manhattan]]'s [[Upper West Side]] in New York City, the show features a handful of Jerry's friends and acquaintances, including best friend [[George Costanza]] ([[Jason Alexander]]), friend and former girlfriend [[Elaine Benes]] ([[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]]), and neighbor across the hall [[Cosmo Kramer]] ([[Michael Richards]]). It is often described as being "a show about nothing", as many of its episodes are about the minutiae of daily life.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; 

''Seinfeld'' was produced by West-Shapiro Productions and [[Castle Rock Entertainment]] in association with [[Columbia Pictures Television]]. In syndication, the series has been distributed by [[Sony Pictures Television]] since 2002. It was largely written by David and Seinfeld with script writers who included [[Larry Charles]], [[Peter Mehlman]], [[Gregg Kavet]], [[Carol Leifer]], [[David Mandel]], [[Jeff Schaffer]], [[Steve Koren]], [[Jennifer Crittenden]], [[Tom Gammill and Max Pross|Tom Gammill]], [[Tom Gammill and Max Pross|Max Pross]], [[Dan O'Keefe (writer)|Dan O'Keefe]], [[Charlie Rubin]], [[Marjorie Gross]], [[Alec Berg]], [[Elaine Pope]], and [[Spike Feresten]]. A favorite among critics, the series led the [[Nielsen ratings]] in seasons six and nine, and finished among the top two (with NBC's ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'') every year from 1994 to 1998.

''Seinfeld'' is widely considered to be one of the greatest and most influential sitcoms ever made. It has been ranked among the best television shows of all time in publications such as ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0,,20712079_20711820,00.html#21351455|title=TV: 10 All-Time Greatest|newspaper=Entertainment Weekly|date=June 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Rolling Stone]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2016/09/28/rolling-stone-has-come-up-with-the-100-greatest-tv-shows-of-all-time-my-list-was-a-little-different/|title=Rolling Stone has come up with the 100 greatest TV shows of all time.

===Characters===
;Main
[[File:Seinfeld actors montage.jpg|thumb|Jerry Seinfeld (upper left); Jason Alexander (upper right); Michael Richards (lower right); Julia Louis-Dreyfus (lower left)]]
* [[Jerry Seinfeld (character)|Jerry Seinfeld]] ([[Jerry Seinfeld]]) – Jerry is a "minor [[Celebrity|celeb]]" [[Stand-up comedy|stand-up comedian]] who is often depicted as "[[Everyman|the voice of reason]]" amidst the general insanity generated by the people in his world. The in-show character is a mild [[Mysophobia|germaphobe]] and [[Obsessive–compulsive disorder|neat freak]], as well as an avid [[Superman]], [[New York Mets]] and [[breakfast cereal]] fan. Jerry's apartment is the center of a world visited by his eccentric friends and a focus of the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/about/?sl=cast_and_characters&amp;tab=jerry&amp;type=char |title=Seinfeld Cast and characters – Jerry |publisher=Sony pictures |accessdate=2007-12-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212015442/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/about/?sl=cast_and_characters |archivedate=December 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Elaine Benes]]  ([[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]]) – Elaine is Jerry's ex-girlfriend and later friend. She is attractive and genial, while also being humorous, arrogant and occasionally impulsive. She sometimes has a tendency to be too honest with people (usually by losing her temper), which often gets her into trouble.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/about/?sl=cast_and_characters&amp;tab=elaine&amp;type=char |title=Seinfeld Cast and characters – Elaine |publisher=Sony pictures |accessdate=2007-12-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217220207/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/about/?sl=cast_and_characters&amp;tab=elaine&amp;type=char |archivedate=December 17, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She usually gets caught up in her boyfriends' quirks, eccentric employers' unusual behaviors and idiosyncrasies, and the maladjustment of total strangers. She tends to make poor choices in men she chooses to date and is often overly reactive. First she works at Pendant Publishing with Mr. Lippman, is later hired as a personal assistant for Mr. Pitt, and later works for the J. Peterman catalogue as a glorified assistant. Elaine is popularly described as an amalgamation of David's and Seinfeld's girlfriends during their early days in New York as struggling comedians.
* [[Cosmo Kramer]]  ([[Michael Richards]]) – Kramer is Jerry's "wacky neighbor". His trademarks include his humorous upright [[pompadour hairstyle]], vintage clothes, and energetic sliding bursts through Jerry's apartment door. Kramer was heavily based on a neighbor of David's during his amateur comedic years in Manhattan. At times, he appears [[Naivety|naïve]], gullible, and ignorant, and at other times, intelligent, understanding, and well-read; similarly, he is exaggeratedly successful, socially, with his charisma and laid-back personality. This is seen in his success with women and employers. He has been described as a "hipster doofus". Although he never holds a steady job, he is rarely short of money and often invents wacky schemes that often work at first then eventually fail.

* [[George Costanza]]  ([[Jason Alexander]]) – George is Jerry's best friend, and has been since high school.

He complains and lies easily about his profession, relationships and almost everything else, which usually creates trouble for him later. He often uses the alias Art Vandelay when lying or concocting a cover story. Despite these shortcomings, George has a sense of loyalty to his friends and success in dating women and eventually secures a successful career as Assistant to the Traveling Secretary for the [[New York Yankees]].

;Recurring
{{Main|List of Seinfeld minor characters}}
Many characters have made multiple appearances, like Jerry's nemesis [[Newman (Seinfeld)|Newman]] and his [[Uncle Leo]]. In addition to recurring characters, ''Seinfeld'' features numerous celebrities who appear as themselves or girlfriends, boyfriends, bosses and other acquaintances. Many actors who made guest appearances became household names later in their careers, or were already well known.

===Plotlines===
Many ''Seinfeld'' episodes are based on the writers' real-life experiences, with the experiences reinterpreted for the characters' storylines. For example, George's storyline, "[[The Revenge (Seinfeld)|The Revenge]]", is based on Larry David's experience at ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=212 |title=Seinfacts: The Revenge |publisher=[[Sony Pictures]] |accessdate=2008-12-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216150813/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=212 |archivedate=December 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[The Contest]]" is also based on David's experiences. "[[The Smelly Car]]" storyline is based on Peter Mehlman's lawyer friend, who could not get a bad smell out of his car. "[[The Strike (Seinfeld)|The Strike]]" is based on Dan O'Keefe's dad, who made up his own holiday—[[Festivus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=910 |title=The Strike |publisher=[[Sony Pictures]] |accessdate=2009-01-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216150844/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=910 |archivedate=December 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other stories take on a variety of turns. "[[The Chinese Restaurant]]" consists of George, Jerry and Elaine waiting for a table throughout the entire episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=206 |title=Seinfeld – Now Playing – The Chinese Restaurant |publisher=Sonypictures.com |accessdate=2011-09-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111123925/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=206 |archivedate=January 11, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[The Boyfriend (Seinfeld)|The Boyfriend]]", revolving around [[Keith Hernandez]], extends through 2 episodes. "[[The Betrayal (Seinfeld)|The Betrayal]]" is famous for using [[reverse chronology]], and was inspired by a similar plot device in a [[Harold Pinter]] play, [[Betrayal (play)|''Betrayal'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=908 |title=The Betrayal |publisher=[[Sony Pictures]] |accessdate=2009-01-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216150839/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=908 |archivedate=December 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some stories were inspired by headlines and rumors, as explained in the DVD features "Notes About Nothing", "Inside Look", and "Audio Commentary". In "[[The Maestro (Seinfeld)|The Maestro]]", Kramer's lawsuit is roughly similar to the [[Liebeck v. McDonald's Restaurants|McDonald's coffee case]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=703 |title=The Maestro |publisher=[[Sony Pictures]] |accessdate=2009-01-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216150829/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=703 |archivedate=December 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[The Outing (Seinfeld)|The Outing]]" is based primarily on rumors that Larry Charles heard about Jerry Seinfeld's sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=416 |title=The Outing |publisher=[[Sony Pictures]] |accessdate=2009-01-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216150823/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=416 |archivedate=December 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Themes===
The series was often described as "a show about nothing".&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/guide/articles/s/seinfeld_7775675.shtml |title=Seinfeld |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2007-05-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427105254/http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/guide/articles/s/seinfeld_7775675.shtml |archivedate=April 27, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmovie.com/work/276165|title=Seinfeld: Overview|author=Erickson, Hal|publisher=[[Allmovie]]|accessdate=2007-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Seinfeld in 2014 stated "the pitch for the show, the real pitch, when Larry and I went to NBC in 1988, was we want to show how a comedian gets his material. The show about nothing was just a joke in an episode many years later, and Larry and I to this day are surprised that it caught on as a way that people describe the show, because to us it's the opposite of that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Seinfeld|first1=Jerry|title=Jerry Seinfeld here.

''Seinfeld'' broke several conventions of [[mainstream]] television. The show offers no growth or reconciliation to its characters. It eschews sentimentality.&lt;ref name="baltimore sun"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1998-05-03/features/1998123008_1_seinfeld-elaine-benes-julia-louis-dreyfus|title=The world according to 'Seinfeld' No hugging, no learning. No aging, commitment or obligation. We've laughed at such postmodern sentiments for nine years. Is there anything wrong with that?|last=Zurawik|first=David|date=May 3, 1998|work=The Baltimore Sun|accessdate=September 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; An episode is typically driven by humor interspersed with the superficial conflicts of characters with peculiar dispositions. Many episodes revolve around the characters' involvement in the lives of others with typically disastrous results. On the set, the notion that the characters should not develop or improve throughout the series was expressed as the "no hugging, no learning" rule.&lt;ref name="baltimore sun"/&gt; Also unlike most sitcoms, there are no moments of [[pathos]]; the audience is never made to feel sorry for any of the characters. Even [[The Invitations|Susan's death]] elicits no genuine emotions from anybody in the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,292901,00.html|title=Killing Time|work=Entertainment Weekly|first=Nisid|last=Hajari|date=June 7, 1996|accessdate=September 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The characters are "thirty-something singles with vague identities, no roots, and conscious indifference to morals".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Postmodernism: A New Model of Reality|url=http://www.mckenziestudycenter.org/philosophy/articles/postmod.html|first=R. Wesley|last=Hurd|date=June 1998|publisher=McKenzie Study Center|accessdate=2007-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usual conventions, like isolating the characters from the actors playing them and separating the characters' world from that of the actors and audience, were broken. One such example is the [[story arc]] where the characters promote a TV sitcom series named ''Jerry''. The [[show within a show]], ''Jerry'', was much like ''Seinfeld'' in that it was "about nothing" and Seinfeld played himself. The fictional ''Jerry'' was launched in the season four finale, but unlike ''Seinfeld'', it wasn't picked up as a series. ''Jerry'' is one of many examples of [[metafiction]] in the show. There are no fewer than twenty-two fictional movies featured, like ''Rochelle, Rochelle''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uproxx.com/tv/2014/10/all-the-fictional-movies-on-seinfeld-ranked/|title=All The Fictional Movies On 'Seinfeld,' Ranked|work=UPROXX}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of these several elements, ''Seinfeld'' became the first TV series since ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'' to be widely described as [[Postmodernism|postmodern]].&lt;ref name="grenz"&gt;{{cite book|title=A Primer on Postmodernism|isbn=0-8028-0864-6|last=Grenz|first=Stanley J.|authorlink=Stanley Grenz|publisher=[[Wm.

Jerry Seinfeld is an avid Abbott and Costello fan, and has cited the [[Abbott and Costello Show]] as an influence on ''Seinfeld.'' "Everybody on the show knows I'm a fan. We're always joking about how we do stuff from their show. George and I will often get into a riff that has the rhythm from the old Abbott and Costello shows. And sometimes I'll hit George in the chest the way Abbott would hit Costello." The  series includes numerous references to the team. George Costanza's middle name is "Louis," after Costello.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/21/arts/seinfeld-as-opening-act-for-abbott-and-costello.html|title=Seinfeld as Opening Act For Abbott and Costello|first=Bill|last=Carter|date=21 November 1994|publisher=|accessdate=19 January 2018|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[The Old Man (Seinfeld)|The Old Man]]" episode features a cantankerous character named "Sid Fields" as a tribute to the landlord on the team's TV show. Kramer's friend is named Mickey Abbott. A copywriter for the J. Peterman catalog is named Eddie Sherman, after the team's longtime agent. In Episode 30, Kramer hears the famous Abbott and Costello line, "His father was a mudder. His mother was a mudder."

===Catchphrases===
Many terms were coined, popularized, or re-popularized in the series' run and have become part of popular culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Caryn James|url=https://www.nytimes.com/specials/seinfeld/sein5-11parting.html|title=Goodbye!

* "[[The Yada Yada|Yada, yada, yada]]"
* "[[The Soup Nazi|No soup for you!]]"
* "[[The Alternate Side|These pretzels are making me thirsty]]"
* "[[The Outing (Seinfeld)|Not that there's anything wrong with that!]]"
* [[Festivus]]
* [[The Sponge|spongeworthy]]
* "[[The Contest|Are you master of your domain?]]"
* [[Chips and dip#Double-dipping|double-dipping]]
* [[Regift|re-gifter]]
* [[The Raincoats (Seinfeld)|close-talker]]
* [[The Puffy Shirt|low-talker]]
* [[The Bizarro Jerry|man-hands]]
* [[The Serenity Now|Serenity Now!]]
*[[The Hamptons (Seinfeld)|shrinkage]]

The lexicon of Seinfeldian code words and recurring phrases that evolved around particular episodes is referred to as [[Seinlanguage]], the title of Jerry Seinfeld's best-selling book on humor.&lt;ref name="grenz"/&gt;

===Music===
A signature of ''Seinfeld'' is its theme music. Composed by [[Jonathan Wolff (musician)|Jonathan Wolff]], it consists of distinct solo [[Sampling (music)|sampled]] bass [[synthesizer]] riffs (played on a [[Korg M1]] synthesizer)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Neal|first1=Meg|title=A Beginner's Guide To The Synth|url=http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2015/12/a-beginners-guide-to-the-synth/|accessdate=November 30, 2016|date=December 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which open the show and connect the scenes, often accompanied by [[beatboxing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaQ7y5OeHWI|title=Entertainment Tonight – Jonathan Wolff Seinfeld music|date=|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bass synthesizer music eventually replaced the original piano/synth music by Jep Epstein when it was played again after the first broadcast of [[The Seinfeld Chronicles|the pilot episode]]. The show lacked a traditional title track and the riffs were played over the first moments of dialogue or action. They vary throughout each episode and are played in an improvised funk style. An additional musical theme with an ensemble, led by a synthesized mid-range brass instrument, ends each episode.

In "[[The Note (Seinfeld)|The Note]]", the first episode of season three, the bumper music featured a [[Scat singing|scatting]] female jazz singer who sang a phrase that sounded like "easy to beat". Jerry Seinfeld and executive producer Larry David both liked Wolff's additions, and three episodes were produced with this new style music. However, they had neglected to inform NBC and Castle Rock executives of the change, and when the season premiere aired, the executives were surprised and unimpressed, and requested that they return to the original style. The subsequent two episodes were redone, leaving this episode as the only one with additional music elements.&lt;ref&gt;Season 3 DVD: Inside Look of 'The Note'&lt;/ref&gt; In the commentary of "The Note", Louis-Dreyfus facetiously suggests it was removed because the perceived lyric related closely to the low ratings at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Season 3 DVD: 'The Note' commentary&lt;/ref&gt;

In the final three seasons, the bits were tweaked slightly with more frantic rhythms; a bass guitar was added in addition to the sampled bass from earlier seasons. Throughout the show, the main theme could be restyled in different ways depending on the episode. For instance, in "The Betrayal", part of which takes place in India, the theme is heard played on a [[sitar]].

''Seinfeld'' stood out from family and group [[Situation comedy|sitcoms]] of its time. The principal characters are not related by family or work connections but remain distinctively close friends throughout the series.

Many characters were based primarily on Seinfeld's and David's real-life acquaintances. Two prominent recurring characters were based on well-known people: [[Jacopo Peterman]] of the [[The J.

''Seinfeld'' follows its own structure: story thread is presented at the beginning of every episode, which involves the characters starting in their own situations. Rapid scene-shifts between plot lines bring the stories together. Even though it does not follow a pattern as other sitcoms, the characters' stories variously intertwine in each episode. Despite the separate plot strands, the narratives reveal the creators' "consistent efforts to maintain the intimacy" among the small cast of characters.&lt;ref&gt;Gantz, Katherine. ''"Not That There's Anything Wrong with That": Reading the Queer in Seinfeld''. In Calvin Thomas (Ed.). ''Straight with a Twist: Queer Theory and the Subject of Heterosexuality''. Champaign. Illinois: University of Illinois Press. {{ISBN|0-252-06813-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show maintains a strong sense of [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]]—characters and plots from past episodes are often referenced or expanded on. Occasionally, story arcs span multiple episodes and even entire seasons, the most memorable being [[Seinfeld (season 4)|season four]], which revolved around the [[television pilot|pilot]] pitch to NBC by Jerry and George. Another example is Jerry's girlfriend Vanessa, who appears in "[[The Stake Out (Seinfeld)|The Stake Out]]" and he ends the relationship when things do not work out in "[[The Stock Tip]]". Other examples are Kramer getting his jacket back and Elaine heading the "Peterman catalog". [[Larry David]], the head writer and executive producer for the first seven seasons, was praised for keeping a close eye on minor details and making sure the main characters' lives remained consistent and believable. ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]''—David's later comedy series—expanded on this idea by following a specific theme for all but one season in the series.

A major difference between ''Seinfeld'' and sitcoms which preceded it is that the principal characters never learn from their mistakes. In effect, they are indifferent and even callous towards the outside world and sometimes one another. A [[mantra]] of the show's producers was: "No hugging, no learning".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=About Seinfeld|url=http://www.tv1.com.au/Shows/Seinfeld/About/|publisher=[[TV1 (Australia)|TV1]]|accessdate=2008-01-22|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070831074136/http://www.tv1.com.au/Shows/Seinfeld/About/|archivedate=2007-08-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'''s TV critic [[Ken Tucker]] has described them as "a group dynamic rooted in jealousy, rage, insecurity, despair, hopelessness, and a touching lack of faith in one's fellow human beings".&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, Ken.

===Seasons 1–3===
[[Image:757 New Hampshire Ave 2.jpg|thumb|The Los Angeles building used to depict the exterior of Jerry's apartment building at 129 West 81st Street, Manhattan]]
The show premiered as ''[[The Seinfeld Chronicles]]'' on July 5, 1989. After it aired, a pickup by NBC seemed unlikely and the show was offered to [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], which declined to pick it up. [[Rick Ludwin]], head of late night and special events for NBC, however, diverted money from his budget by canceling a [[Bob Hope#Broadcasting|Bob Hope television special]], and the next 4 episodes were filmed.&lt;ref name="Season 1 &amp; 2 DVD review"&gt;{{cite web|last=Boudreaux |first=Jonathan |url=http://www.tvdvdreviews.com/seinfeld1.html |title=Seinfeld: Season 1 &amp; 2 DVD Review |publisher=tvdvdreviews.com |date=2004-11-24 |accessdate=2008-04-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080418075527/http://www.tvdvdreviews.com/seinfeld1.html |archivedate=April 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{r|littlefield20120529}} These episodes were highly rated as they followed summer re-runs of ''[[Cheers]]'' on Thursdays at 9:30&amp;nbsp;p.m., and the series was finally picked up. At one point NBC considered airing these episodes on Saturdays at 10:30&amp;nbsp;p.m., but gave that slot to a short-lived sitcom called ''FM''. The series was renamed simply ''Seinfeld'' after the failure of short-lived 1990 [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] series ''The Marshall Chronicles''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lI_qCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT21&amp;lpg=PT21|title=Seinfeld FAQ: Everything Left to Know About the Show About Nothing|first=Nicholas|last=Nigro|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|date=2015-06-01|accessdate=2015-12-29|isbn=9781495035357}}&lt;/ref&gt; After airing the remaining four episodes of its first season the summer of 1990, NBC ordered thirteen more episodes.

TV critics championed ''Seinfeld'' in its early seasons, even as it was slow to cultivate a substantial audience. For the first three seasons, Jerry's stand-up comedy act would bookend an episode, even functioning as [[cut scene]]s during the show. A few episodes set a benchmark for later seasons. "[[The Deal (Seinfeld episode)|The Deal]]" establishes Jerry and Elaine's relationship by setting rules about sleeping together and remaining friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=213 |title=Seinfeld – Now Playing – The Deal |publisher=Sonypictures.com |date=1991-05-02 |accessdate=2011-09-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010172948/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=213 |archivedate=October 10, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[The Parking Garage (Seinfeld episode)|The Parking Garage]]" was the first episode shot with no audience for the episode and, after "[[The Chinese Restaurant (Seinfeld episode)|The Chinese Restaurant]]", with not showing Jerry's apartment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=306 |title=Seinfeld – Now Playing – The Parking Garage |publisher=Sonypictures.com |accessdate=2011-09-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111116052213/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=306 |archivedate=November 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  "[[The Keys (Seinfeld episode)|The Keys]]" contains a crossover to [[CBS]] show ''[[Murphy Brown]]'', marking the first such cooperation between rival networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=321 |title=Seinfeld – Now Playing – The Keys |publisher=Sonypictures.com |accessdate=2011-09-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010172940/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=321 |archivedate=October 10, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[The Busboy (Seinfeld)|The Busboy]]" introduces George, Kramer and Elaine as having their own storylines for the first time. Although Castle Rock Entertainment's Glenn Padnick thought Jerry Seinfeld was too generous, showcasing his co-stars' comedic talent became a trademark throughout the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=203 |title=Seinfeld -– Now Playing  |publisher=Sonypictures.com |accessdate=2012-03-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114031559/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=203 |archivedate=November 14, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Larry Charles wrote an episode for season two, "The Bet", in which Elaine buys a gun from Kramer's friend. This episode wasn't filmed because the content was deemed unacceptable, and was replaced by the episode "[[The Phone Message]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=207 |title=Seinfeld – Now Playing – The phone message |publisher=Sony pictures |accessdate=2008-10-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216150808/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=207 |archivedate=December 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[The Stranded]]", aired in season three, was intended for season two. In the beginning of this episode, Jerry clears up the continuity error over George's real estate job.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=209 |title=Seinfeld – Now Playing |publisher=Sonypictures.com |accessdate=2010-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219225606/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=209 |archivedate=December 19, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Seasons 4–5===
Season four marked the sitcom's entry into the [[Nielsen ratings]] Top 30, coinciding with several popular episodes, such as "[[The Bubble Boy (Seinfeld episode)|The Bubble Boy]]" in which George and the bubble boy argue over ''[[Trivial Pursuit]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=407 |title=Seinfeld – Now Playing |publisher=Sonypictures.com |accessdate=2012-03-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118152059/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=407 |archivedate=January 18, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and "[[The Junior Mint (Seinfeld episode)|The Junior Mint]]" in which Jerry and Kramer accidentally fumble a mint in the operating room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=421 |title=Seinfeld – Now Playing |publisher=Sonypictures.com |accessdate=2012-03-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110925045350/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=421 |archivedate=September 25, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first season to use a story arc of Jerry and George creating their own sitcom, ''Jerry''. Also at this time, the use of Jerry's stand-up act slowly declined, and the stand-up segment in the middle of ''Seinfeld'' episodes was cut.

Much publicity followed the controversial episode, "[[The Contest (Seinfeld)|The Contest]]", an [[Emmy Award]]-winning episode written by co-creator Larry David, whose subject matter was considered inappropriate for prime time network TV. To circumvent this taboo, the word "[[masturbation]]" was never used in the script, instead substituted for by a variety of oblique references.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=411 |title=Seinfeld – Now Playing |publisher=Sonypictures.com |accessdate=2012-03-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010173057/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=411 |archivedate=October 10, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Midway through that season, ''Seinfeld'' was moved from its original 9:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. time slot on Wednesdays to 9:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. on Thursdays, following ''[[Cheers]]'' again, which gave the show even more popularity. Ratings also sparked the move, as Tim Allen's sitcom ''[[Home Improvement (TV series)|Home Improvement]]'' on ABC had aired at the same time and ''Improvement'' kept beating ''Seinfeld'' in the ratings. [[NBC]] moved the series after [[Ted Danson]] announced the end of ''Cheers'' and ''Seinfeld'' quickly surpassed the ratings of the 9:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. ''Cheers'' reruns that spring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/60203201.html?dids=60203201:60203201&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Mar+4%2C+1993&amp;author=DANIEL+CERONE&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=1&amp;desc=%60Seinfeld%27+Is+Suddenly+Something+Sitcom+That%27s+%60About+Nothing%27+Finding+More+Fans+in+New+Time+Slot |author=Cerone, Daniel|title=Seinfeld Is Suddenly Something|work=Los Angeles Times|date=March 4, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show won an Emmy Award for ''Outstanding Comedy Series'' in 1993, beating out its family-oriented, time-slot competitor ''[[Home Improvement (TV series)|Home Improvement]]'', which was only in its second season on rival network ABC.

Season five was an even bigger ratings-hit, consisting of popular episodes, such as "[[The Puffy Shirt]]" in which Jerry feels embarrassed wearing a "pirate" shirt on ''[[The Today Show]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=503 |title=Seinfeld – Now Playing |publisher=Sonypictures.com |accessdate=2012-03-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121117030920/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=503 |archivedate=November 17, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[The Non-Fat Yogurt]]" featuring [[Rudy Giuliani]], the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] then-mayor-elect of New York,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=508 |title=Seinfeld – Now Playing |publisher=Sonypictures.com |accessdate=2012-03-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121118040205/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=508 |archivedate=November 18, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and "[[The Opposite]]" in which George, doing the opposite of what his instincts tell him he should do, lands a job with the [[New York Yankees]] and Elaine leaves "Pendant Publishing" because of a comedy of errors that lead to its demise. Another story arc has George returning to live with his parents. In the midst of the story arc, Kramer creates and promotes his [[coffee table book]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=521 |title=Seinfeld – Now Playing – The Opposite |publisher=Sonypictures.com |accessdate=2011-09-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010173017/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=521 |archivedate=October 10, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The show was again nominated for Outstanding Comedy Series, but lost to the ''Cheers'' spin-off ''[[Frasier]]'', then in its first season. ''Seinfeld'' was nominated for the same award every year for its entire run but always lost to ''Frasier'', which went on to win a record thirty-nine Emmy Awards in its eleven-season run.

===Seasons 6–7===
In season six, [[Andy Ackerman]] replaced [[Tom Cherones]] as director of the show. The series remained well-regarded and produced some of its most famous episodes, such as "[[The Beard]]" in which Jerry is put through a lie detector test to make him admit that he watched ''[[Melrose Place]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=615 |title=Seinfeld – Now Playing |publisher=Sonypictures.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201175528/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=615 |archivedate=February 1, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[The Switch (Seinfeld)|The Switch]]" in which Kramer's mom, Babs, reveals that his first name is Cosmo,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=610 |title=Seinfeld – Now Playing – The Switch |publisher=Sonypictures.com |accessdate=2011-09-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516031736/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=610 |archivedate=May 16, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and "[[The Understudy (Seinfeld)|The Understudy]]" in which Elaine meets J.

This was the first season in which ''Seinfeld'' reached No. 1 in the Nielsen Ratings. The use of Jerry's stand-up act declined with the end stand-up segment no longer appearing, as the storylines for all four characters grew denser.

In season seven, a story arc involved George getting engaged to his ex-girlfriend, Susan Ross, after the pilot ''Jerry'' proved unsuccessful. In it, George spends most of the season regretting and trying to get out of the engagement. Along with the regular half-hour episodes, two notable one-hour episodes were "[[The Cadillac (Seinfeld)|The Cadillac]]" in which George plans to date award-winning actor [[Marisa Tomei]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=714 |title=Seinfeld – Now Playing |publisher=Sonypictures.com |accessdate=2012-03-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516034018/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=714 |archivedate=May 16, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and "[[The Bottle Deposit]]" with Elaine and Sue Ellen participating in a bidding war to buy JFK's golf clubs in an auction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=721 |title=Seinfeld – Now Playing |publisher=[[Sony Pictures]]|accessdate=2012-03-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516031807/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=721 |archivedate=May 16, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Seasons 8–9===
The show's ratings were still going strong in its final two seasons. Larry David left at the end of season seven, although he continued to voice Steinbrenner, so Seinfeld assumed David's duties as [[showrunner]], and, under the direction of a new writing staff, ''Seinfeld'' became a faster-paced show. The show no longer contained extracts of Jerry performing stand-up comedy—Jerry had no time or energy for this with his new responsibilities—and storylines occasionally delved into fantasy and broad humor. For example, in "[[The Bizarro Jerry]]", Elaine is torn between exact opposites of her friends and Jerry dates a woman who has the now-famed "man hands".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=803 |title=Seinfeld – Now Playing – The Bizarro Jerry |publisher=Sonypictures.com |accessdate=2011-09-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117185550/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=803 |archivedate=January 17, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some notable episodes from season eight include "[[The Little Kicks]]" showing Elaine's horrible dancing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=804 |title=Seinfeld – Now Playing – The Little Kicks |publisher=Sonypictures.com |accessdate=2011-09-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010173001/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=804 |archivedate=October 10, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and "[[The Chicken Roaster]]" which portrays the ''[[Kenny Rogers Roasters]]'' chicken restaurant which opened during that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=808 |title=Seinfeld – Now Playing |publisher=Sonypictures.com |accessdate=2012-03-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516045149/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=808 |archivedate=May 16, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A story arc in this season involves Peterman going to [[Burma]] in "[[The Foundation (Seinfeld)|The Foundation]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=801 |title=Seinfeld – Now Playing |publisher=Sonypictures.com |accessdate=2012-03-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516041857/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=801 |archivedate=May 16, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; until he recovered from a nervous breakdown in "[[The Money]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=813 |title=Seinfeld – Now Playing |publisher=Sonypictures.com |accessdate=2012-03-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111219023930/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=813 |archivedate=December 19, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by Elaine writing Peterman's biography in "[[The Van Buren Boys]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=814 |title=Seinfeld – Now Playing |publisher=Sonypictures.com |accessdate=2012-03-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121130032028/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=814 |archivedate=November 30, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which leads to Kramer's parody of Kenny Kramer's Reality Tour seen in "[[The Muffin Tops]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=821 |title=Seinfeld – Now Playing – The Muffin Tops |publisher=Sonypictures.com |accessdate=2011-09-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010173006/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=821 |archivedate=October 10, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final season included episodes like "[[The Merv Griffin Show (Seinfeld)|The Merv Griffin Show]]" in which Kramer converts his apartment into a talk-show studio and plays the character of talk-show host,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=906 |title=Seinfeld – Now Playing |publisher=Sonypictures.com |accessdate=2012-03-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516031219/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=906 |archivedate=May 16, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[The Betrayal]]" that presents in reverse chronological order what happened to Sue Ellen's wedding in India, and "[[The Frogger]]" in which George pushes a ''[[Frogger]]'' machine across the street, mimicking the action of the game itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=918 |title=Seinfeld – Now Playing – The Frogger |publisher=Sonypictures.com |accessdate=2011-09-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010173013/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=918 |archivedate=October 10, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The last season included a story arc in which Elaine has an on/off relationship with [[David Puddy|Puddy]].

A major controversy caused in this final season was the accidental burning of a [[Puerto Rican flag]] by Kramer in "[[The Puerto Rican Day]]". This scene caused a furor among Puerto Ricans, and as a result, NBC showed this episode only once. Jerry Seinfeld defused the protestors by not letting this episode continue in syndication, as revealed in "Inside Look" on DVD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=920 |title=Seinfeld – Now Playing – The Puerto Rican Day |accessdate=2008-10-25 |publisher=Sony pictures |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216150849/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&amp;ep=920 |archivedate=December 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the episode would be added to the syndicated rerun package several years later uncut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://nypost.com/2002/10/30/forbidden-seinfeld-puerto-rican-flag-burning-episode-slips-back-on-air/ |title=Forbidden 'Seinfeld'; Puerto Rican Flag Burning Episode Slips Back On Air |last=Starr |first=Michael |publisher=New York Post |date=October 30, 2002 |access-date=April 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Series finale===
{{Main|The Finale (Seinfeld)}}
After nine years on the air, NBC and Jerry Seinfeld announced on December 25, 1997, that the series would end production the following spring in 1998. The announcement made the front page of the major New York newspapers, including the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]''. Jerry Seinfeld was featured on the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's first issue of 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,1101980112,00.html|title=Time Magazine Cover: Jerry Seinfeld|date=1998-01-12|accessdate=2007-05-17|work=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series ended with a seventy-five-minute episode (cut to 60 minutes in [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]], in two parts) written by co-creator and ex-executive producer Larry David, which aired on May 14, 1998. Before the finale, a forty-five-minute retrospective clip show, "[[The Chronicle (Seinfeld)|The Chronicle]]", was aired. The retrospective was expanded to an hour after the original airing and aired again on NBC as an hour-long episode, and has since aired in syndication.

It was the first episode since the finale of season seven, "[[The Invitations]]", to feature opening and closing stand-up comedy acts by Jerry Seinfeld. The finale was filmed before an audience of NBC executives and friends of the show. The press and public were shut out of the taping in order to keep its plot secret; those who attended the shoot of the final episode were required to sign written "vows of silence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/9804/08/seinfeld.email/|title=The 'Seinfeld' e-mail for April 8, 1998|publisher=[[CNN.com]]|date=1998-04-08|accessdate=2007-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The secrecy only seemed to increase speculation about how the series would end. The producers of the show tweaked the media about the hype, spreading a false rumor about Newman ending up in the hospital and Jerry and Elaine sitting in a chapel, presumably to marry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/b36158_clues_seinfeld_sign_off.html|title=Clues to "Seinfeld" Sign Off|author=Ryan, Joal|publisher=[[E!

The final episode enjoyed a historic&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = 'Seinfeld's' Finale Ends Up in Sixth Place of All Time|url = http://articles.latimes.com/1998/may/16/entertainment/ca-50143|newspaper = Los Angeles Times|date = May 16, 1998|access-date = 2015-04-28|issn = 0458-3035|language = en|first = Brian|last = Lowry}}&lt;/ref&gt; audience, estimated at 76.3 million viewers (58% of all viewers that night) making it the [[List of most watched television broadcasts in the United States#Most watched series finales|fourth most watched regular series finale]] in U.S. TV history, behind ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', ''[[Cheers]]'' and ''[[The Fugitive (TV series)|The Fugitive]]''. However, the finale received mixed reviews from critics and fans of the show. The finale poked fun at the many rumors that were circulating, seeming to move into multiple supposed plots before settling on its true storyline—a lengthy trial where the gang is prosecuted for violating a "[[Good Samaritan law]]" and sentenced to prison terms.

According to ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine, Jerry Seinfeld's earnings from the show in 1998 came to US$267 million, including syndication earnings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1999-03-08/news/9903090088_1_top-earning-forbes-jerry-seinfeld|title=Seinfeld's $267 Million Tops Celebrity-pay List In Forbes|work=Chicago Tribune|date=1999-03-08|accessdate=2011-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; He refused NBC's offer of $5 million per episode, or over $100 million total, to continue the show into a tenth season.

===Syndication===
According to [[Barry Meyer]], chairman of [[Warner Bros.|Warner Bros. Entertainment]], ''Seinfeld'' made $2.7 billion through June 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pilkington|first=Ed|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2010/jun/07/jerry-seinfeld-rerun-repeat-fees|title=TV show Seinfeld earn $2.7bn from reruns|publisher=The Guardian|date=7 June 2010|accessdate=7 June 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{asof|2017|02}} the show has made an estimated $4.06 billion in syndication. [[Steve Bannon]], who invested in the show, later said, "We calculated what it would get us if it made it to syndication. We were wrong by a factor of five".&lt;ref name="craw20170208"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://nypost.com/2017/02/08/steve-bannon-is-still-making-money-from-seinfeld-reruns/ |title=Steve Bannon is still making money from 'Seinfeld' reruns |last=Craw |first=Victoria |date=2017-02-08 |work=The New York Post |access-date=2017-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
''Seinfeld'' began as a twenty-three-minute pilot titled ''[[The Seinfeld Chronicles]]''. Created by [[Jerry Seinfeld]] and [[Larry David]], developed by NBC executive Rick Ludwin, and produced by [[Castle Rock Entertainment]], it was a mix of Seinfeld's stand-up comedy routines and idiosyncratic, conversational scenes focusing on mundane aspects of everyday life like laundry, the buttoning of the top button on one's shirt and the effort by men to properly interpret the intent of women spending the night in Seinfeld's apartment.&lt;ref name=TVGuide&gt;Battaglio, Stephen (June 30, 2014). "'Annoying' 'Disorienting' 'Boring': On ''Seinfeld's'' 25th anniversary an exclusive look at the memo that almost killed the show". ''[[TV Guide]]''. pp. 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

The pilot was filmed at Stage 8 of [[Ren-Mar Studios|Desilu Cahuenga]] studios, the same studio where ''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]'' was filmed (this was seen by the crew as a good omen),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people=[[Rob Reiner]]|title=Seinfeld Seasons 1 &amp; 2: Inside Looks – "The Seinfeld Chronicles"|medium=DVD|publisher=Sony Pictures Home Entertainment|date=2004-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was recorded at Ren-Mar Studios in [[Hollywood]].&lt;ref name=S1&amp;2DVD-NAN&gt;{{cite video|title=Seinfeld Seasons 1 &amp; 2: Notes about Nothing – "The Seinfeld Chronicles"|medium=DVD|publisher=Sony Pictures Home Entertainment|date=2004-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pilot was first screened to a group of two dozen NBC executives in [[Burbank, California]] in early 1989. It didn't yield the explosion of laughter garnered by the pilots for the decade's previous NBC successes like ''[[The Cosby Show]]'' and ''[[The Golden Girls]].'' [[Brandon Tartikoff]] was not convinced that the show would work. A Jewish man from New York himself, Tartikoff characterized it as "Too New York, too Jewish". Test audiences were even harsher. NBC's practice at the time was to recruit 400 households by phone to ask them to evaluate pilots it aired on an unused channel on its cable system. An NBC research department memo summarized the pilot's performance among the respondents as "weak", which [[Warren Littlefield]], then second-in-command in NBC's entertainment division, called "a dagger to the heart".&lt;ref name=TVGuide/&gt; Comments included, "You can't get too excited about two guys going to the laundromat"; "Jerry's loser friend George isn't a forceful character"; "Jerry needs a stronger supporting cast"; and "Why are they interrupting the stand-up for these stupid stories?"&lt;ref name=S1&amp;2DVD-NAN/&gt; Seinfeld and David didn't see the memo for several years, but after they became aware of it, they hung it in a bathroom on the set. Seinfeld comments, "We thought, if someone goes in to use this bathroom, this is something they should see. It fits that moment."&lt;ref name=TVGuide/&gt;

Around the time the show's pilot was filmed, Castle Rock Entertainment, which produced the show, had also produced another pilot for NBC that featured [[Ann Jillian]] in her almost-similarly eponymous [[Ann Jillian (TV series)|TV series]]. After ''The Seinfeld Chronicles'' tested poorly among audiences, Castle Rock then devoted their focus to Jillian's series, which tested better with audiences and received a full-season order. ''Ann Jillian'' would last only a single season of 13 episodes and would be off the air by the end of 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/seinfeld-finale-at-20-hidden-tales-vault-a-comedians-bizarro-world-1111377 |title='Seinfeld' Finale at 20: Hidden Tales From the Vault of a Comedian's Bizarro World |last=Freeman|first=Marc |publisher=Hollywood Reporter |date=May 13, 2018 |website=Encyclopedia of Things |access-date=May 16, 2018 |quote=Castle Rock, which owned the series, had two pilots at NBC that year: Seinfeld and one with Ann Jillian. Whereas Seinfeld tested poorly, Ann Jillian tested through the roof and earned a 13-episode commitment. Castle Rock decided to focus on that.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
When NBC announced its 1989&amp;ndash;90 primetime schedule in May 1989, ''The Seinfeld Chronicles'' was not included, but supporters of the show didn't give up on it. The pilot first aired on July 5, 1989, and finished second in its time slot against the CBS police drama ''[[Jake and the Fatman]]'',&lt;ref name=TVGuide/&gt; receiving a [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen rating]] of 10.9/19, meaning that the pilot was watched by 10.9% of American households, and that 19% of all TVs in use at the time were tuned into it.&lt;ref name=S1&amp;2DVD-NAN/&gt; The ratings didn't exhibit regional skew that Tartikoff predicted, much to the encouragement of the show's supporters. Despite the poor test results, Ludwin cancelled one of the [[Bob Hope]] specials budgeted for that season so that the entertainment division had the money to order four more episodes of ''The Seinfeld Chronicles'', which formed the rest of [[Seinfeld (season 1)|the show's first season]] (the series was by then retitled to just ''Seinfeld''); &lt;ref name=TVGuide/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Duffy|first=Mike|url=http://www.azcentral.com/ent/tv/articles/1125seinfeld.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120723085248/http://www.azcentral.com/ent/tv/articles/1125seinfeld.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2012-07-23|title=Give thanks for 'The 'Seinfeld' Story'|publisher=azcentral.com|date=2004-11-24|accessdate=2008-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; a move without which ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' columnist [[Phil Rosenthal]] later stated there would be no ''Seinfeld''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2005-08-21/business/0508210218_1_warren-littlefield-rick-ludwin-head-of-nbc-entertainment |author= Rosenthal, Phil |authorlink= Phil Rosenthal |date= August 21, 2005 |title= NBC executive stands apart by taking stands|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|accessdate= September 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this was a very low order number for a new series (the smallest sitcom order in TV history&lt;ref name=S1&amp;2DVD-NAN/&gt;), Castle Rock failed to find any other buyers when it shopped the show to other networks, and accepted the order.&lt;ref name=TVGuide/&gt; The show was renamed simply ''Seinfeld'', but it wouldn't return to the airwaves until May 30, 1990, and it would be another three years before it became a Top 5-rated show. Preston Beckman, who was in charge of NBC's research department at the time, reminisced, "The show was different. Nobody had seen anything like it. It wasn't unusual for poor-testing shows to get on the air, but it was very rare that they became hits."

When it was first repeated on July 5, 1990, it received a rating of 13.9/26. These ratings were high enough to secure a second season.&lt;ref name="S1&amp;2DVD-NAN" /&gt; NBC research showed that the show was popular with young male adults, a demographic sought after by advertisers. This gave NBC an incentive to keep broadcasting the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rapp|first=David|url=http://www.americanheritage.com/entertainment/articles/web/20060531-jerry-seinfeld-sitcom-television-nbc-kramer-comedian-stand-up-larry-david.shtml|title=Seinfeld: The Unlikeliest Success Story|publisher=American Heritage|date=2006-05-31|accessdate=2008-03-19|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080315041818/http://www.americanheritage.com/entertainment/articles/web/20060531-jerry-seinfeld-sitcom-television-nbc-kramer-comedian-stand-up-larry-david.shtml|archivedate=2008-03-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One DVD reviewer, Britt Gillette, wrote that "this initial episode exhibits the flashes of brilliance that made ''Seinfeld'' a cultural phenomenon."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gillette|first=Britt|url=http://www.articlecity.com/articles/music_and_movies/article_518.shtml|title=Seinfeld (Seasons 1 &amp; 2) DVD Review|publisher=Article City|date=2006-09-20|accessdate=2008-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{anchor|HD}}High-definition versions==
There are two [[High-definition television|high-definition]] versions of ''Seinfeld''. The first is that of the network TV (non-syndicated) versions in the original aspect ratio of 4:3 that were downscaled for the DVD releases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showthread.php?p=14589923#post14589923|title='Seinfeld' in HD on TBS HD! Page 2|publisher=videojanitor|accessdate=2009-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Syndicated broadcast stations and the cable network [[TBS (TV network)|TBS]] began airing the syndicated version of ''Seinfeld'' in HD. Unlike the version used for the DVD, Sony Pictures cropped the top and bottom parts of the frame, while restoring previously cropped images on the sides, from the [[35 mm film]] source, to use the entire 16:9 frame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.engadget.com/topics/hd/2008/09/03/seinfeld-goes-hd-on-tbs-hd|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130116201359/http://www.engadget.com/topics/hd/2008/09/03/seinfeld-goes-hd-on-tbs-hd|dead-url= yes|archive-date= 2013-01-16|title=Seinfeld goes HD on TBS HD|date=2008-09-03|publisher=AOL|accessdate=2009-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and legacy==
Elizabeth Magnotta and Alexandra Strohl analyze the success of ''Seinfeld'' with recourse to the [[Theories of humor#Incongruity theory|incongruity theory]] of humor: "The Incongruity Theory claims that humor is created out of a violation of an expectation. For humor to result from this unexpected result, the event must have an appropriate emotional climate, {{sic|comprised |hide=y|of}} the setting, characters, prior discourse, relationships of the characters, and the topic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author = Magnotta, Elizabeth and Alexandra Strohl| title = A linguistic analysis of humor: A look at ''Seinfeld''| url = http://journals.uvic.ca/index.php/WPLC/article/view/5944|accessdate=August 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, Magnotta and Strohl focus on "[[The Marine Biologist]]", where George is embroiled in yet another lie, and on "[[The Red Dot]]", where George tries to save a few dollars at Elaine's expense by giving her a marked-down [[cashmere wool|cashmere]] sweater.

Nod Miller, of the [[University of East London]], has discussed the self-referential qualities of the show:

{{quote|Seinfeld is suffused with postmodern themes. To begin with, the boundary between reality and fiction is frequently blurred: this is illustrated in the central device of having Jerry Seinfeld play the character Jerry Seinfeld. In the show's fourth season, several episodes revolved around the narrative of Jerry and George (whose character is co-creator Larry David's alter ego) pitching 'a show about nothing' based on the everyday life of a stand-up comedian to NBC. The reaction of the fictional NBC executives, by all accounts, mirrored the initial responses of those who eventually commissioned Seinfeld. The fourth season ends with [[The Pilot (Seinfeld)|'The Pilot']], an episode focusing on the casting, taping and screening of the show-within-the-show, ''Jerry''. This episode also illustrates neatly the self-referential quality which is one of Seinfeld's hallmarks. The series finale was so replete with references to earlier shows as to render it largely incomprehensible to those not already well-versed in the personae and preoccupations of the Seinfeld universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author = Miller, Nod| title = Applying Insights from Cultural Studies to Adult Education: What Seinfeld Says About the AERC| url = http://www.adulterc.org/Proceedings/1999/99miller.htm| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140624022756/http://www.adulterc.org/Proceedings/1999/99miller.htm| dead-url = yes| archive-date = June 24, 2014| publisher = Adult Education Research Conference| accessdate = August 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''[[TV Guide]]'' named it the [[TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time|greatest TV show of all time]] in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Bootie Cosgrove-Mather|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/04/26/entertainment/main507388.shtml|title=TV Guide Names Top 50 Shows|publisher=CBS News|date=2002-04-26|accessdate=2010-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2013, they ranked it as the second greatest TV show.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Consumer products==
A recurring feature of ''Seinfeld'' was its inclusion of specific products, especially [[candy]], as plot points. These might be a central feature of a plot (e.g., [[Junior Mints]], [[Twix]], [[Jujyfruits]], bite size [[3 Musketeers (chocolate bar)|Three Musketeers]], [[Snickers]], [[Nestlé Chunky]], [[Oh Henry!]], [[Drake's Cakes|Drake's]] Coffee Cake and [[PEZ]]), or an association of candy with a guest character (e.g. [[Oh Henry!]] bars) or simply a conversational aside (e.g., [[Chuckles]], [[Clark Bar]], [[Twinkies]]). A large number of non-candy products were also featured throughout the series.

The show's creators claim that they weren't engaging in a product placement strategy for commercial gain. One motivation for the use of real-world products, quite unrelated to commercial considerations, is the comedy value of funny-sounding phrases and words. "I knew I wanted Kramer to think of watching the operation like going to see a movie", explained ''Seinfeld'' writer/producer Andy Robin in an interview published in ''The Hollywood Reporter''. "At first, I thought maybe a piece of popcorn falls into the patient. I ran that by my brother, and he said, 'No, Junior Mints are just funnier.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A look at some of the biggest hits in movie and TV product placement|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/film/feature_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000901395|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011140335/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000901395 |archivedate=October 11, 2007 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=2005-04-28|accessdate=2007-11-10|author=Staff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many advertisers capitalized on the popularity of ''Seinfeld''. [[American Express]] created a [[webisode]] where Jerry Seinfeld and an animated [[Superman]] (voiced by [[Patrick Warburton]], who played the role of Puddy) starred in its commercial. The makers of the [[Contraceptive sponge|Today Sponge]] created the "Spongeworthy" game, on their website, inspired by "[[The Sponge]]". An advertisement featured Jason Alexander in a [[Chrysler]] commercial. In this, Alexander acts much like his character George, and his relationship with [[Lee Iacocca]] plays on his George's relationship with Steinbrenner. Similarly, Michael Richards was the focus of a series of advertisements for [[Vodafone]] which ran in Australia where he dressed and acted exactly like Kramer, including the trademark bumbling pratfalls.

In addition, the show occasionally incorporated fictional products like a [[Scotch whisky|Scotch]] brand called "Hennigan's" (a [[portmanteau]] of "[[Hennessy]]" and "[[Brannigans]]") and a [[canned meat]] product called "Beef-a-reeno" (a parody of "[[Chef Boyardee|Beef-a-roni]]").

===Streaming on Hulu===
On April 29, 2015, it was officially announced, during [[Hulu]]'s [[upfront (advertising)|upfronts]] presentation in [[New York City|New York]], that all nine seasons of Seinfeld would be available for [[Streaming media|online streaming]], via the video service, starting in June 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/4/29/8513149/seinfeld-streaming-exclusively-hulu|title=Hulu confirms it's the exclusive streaming home of Seinfeld|author=Jacob Kastrenakes|publisher=Vox Media|work=The Verge}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/hulu/status/593416595621453825|title=hulu on Twitter|work=Twitter}}&lt;/ref&gt; The news was first reported by ''[[Deadline (magazine)|Deadline]]'' and ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', citing the deal at around $130 million to $180 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/4/28/8512345/hulu-reportedly-lands-streaming-rights-to-all-180-seinfeld-episodes|title=Hulu reportedly lands streaming rights to all 180 Seinfeld episodes|author=Sam Byford|publisher=Vox Media|work=The Verge}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 20, 2015, [[Hulu]] announced that every episode would be available, on June 24, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/hulu/status/601058892932485120|title=Sweet Fancy Moses, every "Seinfeld" episode is on #hulu 6/24.

=== Streaming on Stan ===
On November 8, 2016, the Australian streaming service [[Stan (company)|Stan]] announced via Twitter that later in the week all episodes would be available to stream for the first time in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/StanAustralia/status/795732579492110336|title=Stan. on Twitter|website=Twitter|access-date=2016-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; All episodes were available from November 11, 2016 with the remastered versions of all episodes on the service featuring HD and Widescreen enhancements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mediaweek.com.au/stan-seinfeld-sony-pictures/|title=180 Seinfeld episodes come to Stan with new Sony Pictures Television deal |website=www.mediaweek.com.au|access-date=2016-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The widescreen offered was cropped from the original 4:3 format negatives, thus resulting in better visual quality than the previously available DVD version, however the top and bottom portions of the frame were cut out to achieve the widescreen aspect ratio.

==After ''Seinfeld''==

===Another scene===
On the November 1, 2007, episode of ''[[The Daily Show|The Daily Show with Jon Stewart]]'', Jerry Seinfeld mentioned the possibility of shooting one last scene, after they leave jail. He mentioned that he was too busy to do it at the time, but didn't announce what the scene would entail, as its production isn't a certainty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Episode dated 1 November 2007|series=The Daily Show|serieslink=The Daily Show|network=[[Comedy Central]]|credits=Axler, Rachel; Bleyer, Kevin; Blomquist, Richard; Bodow, Steve; Carvell, Tim; Havlan, J.R.; Scott Jacobson, Scott; Javerbaum, David; Karlin, Ben; Kutner, Rob; Lieb, Josh; Means, Sam; Reich, Jason; Ross, Jason; Stewart, Jon|airdate=2007-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In commentary from the final season [[DVD]], Seinfeld outlines that he and Jason Alexander spoke about this scene being in Monk's Cafe, with George saying "That was brutal" in reference to the foursome's stint in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|title=[[Seinfeld (season 9)|Seinfeld Season 9]]: Notes about Nothing&amp;nbsp;– "The Finale"|medium=DVD|publisher=Sony Pictures Home Entertainment|date=2007-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On an episode of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' that Jerry Seinfeld hosted on October 2, 1999, a sketch was produced that showed what life was like for Jerry behind bars after being transferred to the fictional prison portrayed on the [[HBO]] series ''[[Oz (TV series)|Oz]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Saturday Night Live season 25]]&lt;/ref&gt; The roughly four-minute sketch shows the opening credits for the HBO series with clips of Jerry mixed in doing various activities around the prison. The sketch continues and mixes in different story lines from both ''Oz'' and ''Seinfeld'' and has Jerry interacting with various characters from the show in his typical quick-witted, sarcastic way.&lt;ref&gt;http://snltranscripts.jt.org/99/99aoz.phtml&lt;/ref&gt;

===The ''Seinfeld'' "curse"===
&lt;!--"SEINFELD CURSE" SECTION — PLEASE NOTE BEFORE EDITING: This section deals exclusively with "Seinfeld curse" shows, that is, shows 1] starring Jason, Michael and Julia in title roles, 2] following directly upon the end of Seinfeld, 3] and which were quickly canceled. DO ''not'' add other shows here, especially shows currently in production; add them above.--&gt;
Louis-Dreyfus, Alexander, and Richards have all tried to launch new sitcoms as title-role characters. Almost every show was canceled quickly, usually within the first season. This gave rise to the term ''Seinfeld curse'': the failure of a sitcom starring one of the three, despite the conventional wisdom that each person's ''Seinfeld'' popularity should almost guarantee a strong, built-in audience for the actor's new show. Shows specifically cited regarding the ''Seinfeld curse'' are Julia Louis-Dreyfus's ''[[Watching Ellie]]'', Jason Alexander's ''[[Bob Patterson (TV series)|Bob Patterson]]'' and ''[[Listen Up! (TV series)|Listen Up!]]'', and Michael Richards' ''[[The Michael Richards Show]]''. Larry David said of the curse, "It's so completely idiotic. It's very hard to have a successful sitcom."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gregbaerg.com/articles/David.html|title='Curb's' Larry David: 'Seinfeld' Curse 'Idiotic'|author=Baerg, Greg|publisher=[[Zap2it]]|date=2002-03-05|accessdate=2007-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This phenomenon was mentioned throughout the second season of [[Larry David]]'s HBO program ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]''. However, the Emmy award-winning success of Julia Louis-Dreyfus in the [[CBS]] sitcom ''[[The New Adventures of Old Christine]]'' led many to believe that she had broken the curse.&lt;ref&gt;Susman, Gary (21-03-2006) "[http://popwatch.ew.com/2006/03/21/old_christine_c/ Has Julia Louis Dreyfus broken the 'Seinfeld' curse?]" ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' Retrieved on 29-08-2008&lt;/ref&gt; In her acceptance speech, Louis-Dreyfus held up her award and exclaimed, "I'm not somebody who really believes in curses, but curse this, baby!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/b53166_Emmys_Clock_into_quot24quot_quotOfficequot.html|author=Hall, Sarah|title=Emmys Clock into "24", "Office"|publisher=[[E! News]]|date=2006-08-27|accessdate=2007-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show was on the air for five seasons starting March 13, 2006 before its cancellation on May 18, 2010; the series produced [[100 episodes|enough episodes]] to air in [[rerun]]s in [[broadcast syndication|syndication]] for several years, something the other shows didn't achieve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/blogs/live-feed/cbs-cancels-shows-including-ghost-53669|title=CBS cancels seven shows, including 'Ghost,' 'Case'|last=Hibberd|first=James|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=May 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' episode guest-hosted by Louis-Dreyfus made references to the curse. Louis-Dreyfus went on to win six further Lead Actress in a Comedy Emmys for her acclaimed performance as Vice President [[Selina Meyer]] in HBO's comedy series ''[[Veep (TV series)|Veep]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2017/tv/awards/julia-louis-dreyfus-wins-emmy-lead-actress-comedy-series-1202559690/|title=Julia Louis-Dreyfus makes Emmy history|last=Turchiano|first=Danielle|date=September 18, 2016|website=Variety|access-date=September 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Curb Your Enthusiasm''===
{{Main|Curb Your Enthusiasm Season 7|Seinfeld (Curb Your Enthusiasm)}}
Early in March 2009, it was announced that the ''Seinfeld'' cast would reunite for [[Curb Your Enthusiasm Season 7|season seven]] of ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2009/03/05/seinfeld-cast-t/|author=Rice, Lynette|title=Exclusive: 'Seinfeld' cast to appear on 'Curb Your Enthusiasm'|publisher=[[EW.com]]|date=2009-03-05|accessdate=2009-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cast first appeared in the third episode of the season, all playing their real life selves. The season-long story is that Larry David tries to initiate a ''Seinfeld'' reunion show as a ploy to get his ex-wife, Cheryl, back. Along with the four main characters, some ''Seinfeld'' supporting actors like  [[Wayne Knight]], [[Estelle Harris]] and [[Steve Hytner]] appeared in the ninth episode at a table read for the reunion show. Though much dialogue in ''Curb Your Enthusiasm'' is improvised, the plot was scripted, and the ''Seinfeld'' special that aired within the show was scripted and directed by ''Seinfeld'' regular [[Andy Ackerman]], making this the first time since ''Seinfeld'' went off the air that the central cast appeared together in a scripted show.

===''Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee''===
{{Main|Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee#ep22|l1=The Over-Cheer (Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee)}}
Jerry Seinfeld, Jason Alexander and Wayne Knight, playing their respective ''Seinfeld'' characters, appeared in a spot presented during halftime of [[Super Bowl XLVIII]] on February 2, 2014.&lt;ref name="Superbowl"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/03/business/media/halftime-brings-a-much-anticipated-seinfeld-reunion.html?_r=0|title=Halftime Brings a Much-Anticipated 'Seinfeld' Reunion|date=Feb 2, 2014|accessdate=Feb 2, 2014|first=Bill|last=Carter}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]] came up with the idea of doing such a spot, due in part to the Super Bowl's location being New York that year.&lt;ref name="Superbowl" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2550745/Jerry-Seinfeld-dines-best-friend-George-Costanza-Toms-Restaurant-nemesis-Newman-shows-up.html|title=Seinfeld reunited!

'''Mirko Apostolović''', known as '''Uzun-Mirko''' ({{lang-sr|Узун-Мирко Апостоловић}}; 1782–1868) was a Serbian ''voivode'' (military commander), with the ''[[bimbaša]]'' rank during the [[Serbian revolution]]; he took part in both the [[First Serbian Uprising|First]] and [[Second Serbian Uprising]]. He was famed for his many fatal wounds, undetected infiltration into the Ottoman fort at Belgrade, among other operations, which gained him many awards. He is the founder of the Uzun-Mirković family.

==Life==
Mirko was born in 1782, in [[Brajkovac (Kruševac)|Brajkovac]] (then Smrdljikovac), near [[Lazarevac]]. His family were of the [[Piperi (tribe)|Piperi]], and settled first in [[Rudnik (mountain)|Rudnik]], they then moved to [[Belgrade]], and during the Austrian-Turkish War they lived in [[Srem]]. His father Petar Apostolović and grandfather Apostol died in the Austrian-Turkish War in 1792. They fought in [[Kočina Krajina]], in the Austrian freicorps against the Ottoman Turks. At the return from Srem, Mirko and his mother lived in Mislođin, then he moved to Belgrade, where he learned to be a tailor. He received his nickname 'Uzun' from his height, the Turkish word for tall.&lt;ref&gt;Podatke o Uzun Mirku zapisao na osnovu njegovih kazivanja M. Milićević, Pomenik znamenitih ljudi, Beograd 1888, str. 729 - 733.&lt;/ref&gt;

Uzun-Mirko reached fame when he participated in the Battle of Belgrade that took place from November 29 to December 12, 1806, when he together with his band and [[bimbaša Konda]], a former mercenary commander serving the Ottomans in Belgrade, entered undetected in the city and from the interior opened the Sava Gate for the Serbian Army. He was seriously wounded during the fighting.  He was wounded; in the head in Karanovac (1805, modern [[Kraljevo]]), in his left side in Paraćin (1805), in the shoulder in Smederevo (1805), in the right hand caused by knife in Sava (1806), in the hip in Užice (1805 or 1807), in the breast in Malajnica (1807), over the thighs caused by saber in Drina (1810). After the [[First Serbian Uprising]], he rehabilitated in [[Wien]]. He also participated in the [[Second Serbian Uprising]], in the battles of Lipar, Čačak and Dublje. When he sought a pension from the ''Sovjet'' (Serbian government) in 1842, they asked him for documents, upon which he answered "my documents are my 7 wounds!".

Uzun-Mirko was, like other elders, connected to the Church and obeyed the laws; he had a space in his house on the upper floor, where he every morning and evening prayed in front of icons. According to contemporaries, he prayed loudly, "so that it could be heard outside".&lt;ref&gt;K. Nenadović, Život i dela Karađorđa i njegovi vojvoda i junaka, Beč 1884, str. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 21, 1865, for the 50-year-anniversary of the Second Uprising, [[Mihailo Obrenović III, Prince of Serbia]], personally brought the Takovo cross for Uzun-Mirko, and also awarded him with the Montenegrin golden medallion of Obilić (as a Hero). He died in 1868, and was buried in Belgrade, his grave is situated in the [[Novo Groblje]] in Belgrade.

Uzun-Mirko is the founder of the Uzun-Mirković family. His son was Infantry colonel Ljubomir Uzun-Mirković (1832–1905), he in turn had a son, Division general Dragoljub Uzun-Mirković (1875–1941),&lt;ref&gt;Vid. general Dušan P. Trifunović, Smrt jednog hrabrog i odličnog komandanta, Drag. Lj. Uzun-Mirković, Politika, 8. mart 1941, str. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; who in turn had a son, Artillery captain Miroslav Uzun-Mirković (1941). His maternal cousin was Division general Dragutin Đ. Okanović, who in 1906 as a member of the [[Black Hand (Serbia)|Black Hand]], founded "Novi pokret".
