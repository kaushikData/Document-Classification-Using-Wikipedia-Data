'''ABKO Properties''' was a [[joint venture]] between [[Wichita, Kansas]] [[real estate]] entrepreneur George Ablah and Wichita-based [[Koch Industries]] formed specifically to purchase Chrysler Realty Corporation in the late 1970s from a hard-pressed [[Lee Iacocca]]. Koch Industries is ranked 2 among the Forbes list of largest private companies.  Chrysler Realty Corporation purchases, leases or options dealership facilities and then leases or subleases these facilities to Chrysler dealers. The name ABKO was derived from the first two letters of Ablah’s name and the first two letters of Charles Koch’s name, who is head of Koch Industries.  At the time ABKO was formed, Chrysler was on the verge of bankruptcy.

==History==

ABKO purchased around 840 Chrysler [[Car dealerships in the USA|automotive dealership]] sites around the country controlled by Iacocca in 1979 for slightly over $100 million in cash.  Not all the sites were owned by Chrysler Realty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chrysler's Realty Sale May Be Overly Touted|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/1979/09/16/chryslers-realty-sale-may-be-overly-touted/9ca2d3dc-7163-42ae-844c-7a0f35ee3037/|website=The Washington Post|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=4 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the leadership of Ablah and his team, Chrysler Realty president Ed Homer (for a brief time), executive vice president Corliss (Corky) Nelson of Koch,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10D10FF3B5C0C728CDDAB0894DA484D81|title=EXECUTIVES|date=1982-02-01|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=2008-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; acquisition/disposition specialists Wayne Delfino and Frank Mills, and attorney John Schippel, among others, ABKO set forth a strategy to diversify Chrysler Realty Corporation by way of liquidating non-performing Chrysler dealership properties by tax-free exchange and sale.

In 1983, Iacocca, assisted by a government bailout he organized, repurchased 446 of the dealerships in a measure aimed at strengthening the Chrysler dealer network.  ABKO dissolved shortly thereafter.

'''Active fire protection''' ('''AFP''') is an integral part of [[fire protection]]. AFP is characterized by items and/or [[system]]s, which require a certain amount of motion and response in order to work, contrary to [[passive fire protection]].

==Categories of active fire protection==
===Fire suppression===
{{redirect|Extinguishing a fire|extinguishing coal fires|Coal seam fire#Extinguishing coal fires}}
Fire can be controlled or extinguished, either manually (firefighting) or automatically. Manual control includes the use of a [[fire extinguisher]] or a [[Standpipe (firefighting)|standpipe]] system. Automatic control means can include a [[fire sprinkler system]], a gaseous clean agent, or firefighting foam system. Automatic suppression systems would usually be found in large commercial kitchens or other high-risk areas.

===Sprinkler systems===

Fire sprinkler systems are installed in all types of buildings, commercial and residential. They are usually located at ceiling level and are connected to a reliable water source, most commonly city water. A typical sprinkler system operates when heat at the site of a fire causes a glass component in the sprinkler head to fail, thereby releasing the water from the sprinkler head. This means that only the sprinkler head at the fire location operates – not all the sprinklers on a floor or in a building. Sprinkler systems help to reduce the growth of a fire, thereby increasing life safety and limiting structural damage.

==Fire detection==

Fire detection works using [[Smoke detector|smoke]] or [[Heat detector|heat]] sensors. These systems are very effective tool at alerting people in the immediate vicinity of where the fire is detected but [[building code|building regulations]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sans10400.co.za/fire-protection/|title=SANS10400 Building Regulations|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; require an integrated fire detection system. These system not only alerts people throughout the building by triggering the fire alarm but it can also summon emergency services. There are two types of systems available – addressable and conventional. Addressable systems monitor the specific location of each device (eg smoke detector, call point or sounder). It means in the event of a fire or other emergency you know exactly where the problem is. This saves precious time and helps the emergency services prevent the loss of life and serious damage. Conventional systems can only determine the problem is in a general area and thus are more suited for small sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://intellisec.co.za/fire-detection/|title=Fire Detection Systems|publisher=Intellisec}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the fire detection system is activated it can also send an alert to the local [[fire department]], broadcast a prerecorded warning message and unlock the buildings [[access control]] system.

==Hypoxic air fire prevention==

Fire can be prevented by hypoxic air. [[Hypoxic air fire prevention system]]s, also known as oxygen reduction systems are new automatic fire prevention systems that reduce permanently the oxygen concentration inside the protected volumes so that ignition or fire spreading cannot occur. Unlike traditional fire suppression systems that usually extinguish fire after it is detected, hypoxic air is able to prevent fires. At lower altitudes hypoxic air is safe to breathe for healthy individuals.

==Construction and maintenance==
All AFP systems are required to be installed and maintained in accordance with strict guidelines in order to maintain compliance with the local [[building code]] and the fire code.

AFP works alongside [[passive fire protection|modern architectural designs and construction materials]] and fire safety education to prevent, retard, and suppress structural fires.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4118">The '''Addis Ababa Agreement''', also known as the [[Addis Ababa]] Accord, was a set of compromises within a 1972 treaty that ended the [[First Sudanese Civil War]]  (1955–1972) fighting in [[Sudan]]. The Addis Ababa accords were incorporated in the [[Constitution of Sudan]].

==Preliminaries and Negotiations==
Direct Negotiations between the Government of Sudan and the [[Anyanya| Southern Sudan Liberation Movement (SSLM)]] in Addis Ababa were preceded in 1971 by a series of discussions through the intermediation of the [[All Africa Conference of Churches| All Africa Conference of Churches (AACC)]] and [[World Council of Churches| World Council of Churches (WCC)]].  In Addis Ababa, in 1972, [[Abel Alier]] led the delegation representing the Government of Sudan.  [[Ezboni Mondiri]] led the delegation of the Southern Sudan Liberation Movement (SSLM).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v9NIrNTedJkC&amp;pg=PA188 |title=Eastern African history |first=Robert O. |last=Collins |publisher=Markus Wiener Publishers |year=1991 |ISBN=1-55876-016-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The negotiations were moderated by [[Burgess Carr]], who was then the Secretary General of the [[All Africa Conference of Churches]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Juba University |editor-first=Rift Valley Institute |title=We Have Lived Too Long to Be Deceived: South Sudanese discuss the lessons of historic peace agreements  |url= http://riftvalley.net/publication/we-have-lived-too-long-be-deceived|location= London, UK |publisher=Rift Valley Institute |date=2015 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Results==
The Agreement had the goal to address and appease concerns of the southern Sudan liberation and secession movement, as the First Sudanese Civil War grew costly in lives and resources to the northern Sudanese government and southern population. The Addis Ababa Agreement's establishment of the [[Southern Sudan Autonomous Region (1972–83)|Southern Sudan Autonomous Region]] gave a degree of [[autonomy]]. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Sudan.html#Southern&lt;/ref&gt; It meant South Sudan would no longer be divided into the three separate regions Al-Istiwāʾiyyah (Equatoria), Baḥr al-Ghazāl, and Aʿālī al-Nīl (Upper Nile). The region would run itself through a separate legislative and executive body. The soldiers of the Anya Nya would be integrated into the Sudanese army and police force. The Addis Ababa Agreement gave Nimeri popularity and prestige both within Sudan and outside of the country. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.britannica.com/place/Sudan/The-Addis-Ababa-Agreement#ref48975&lt;/ref&gt;

A decade of relative peace followed, though the Addis Ababa Agreement failed to dispel the tensions that had originally caused civil war.  The Addis Ababa Agreement proved to be only temporary respite. Resource infringements and marginalisation by the north led to increased unrest in the south starting in the late 1970s.

==Termination==
In 1983 President [[Gaafar Nimeiry]] declared all Sudan an [[Islamic state]] under [[Shari'a]] law, including the non-Islamic majority southern region. The Southern Sudan Autonomous Region was abolished on 5 June 1983, ending the Addis Ababa Agreement. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pachodo.org/201010061749/Pachodo.org-English-Articles/history-of-southern-sudan-hoss.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716052232/http://www.pachodo.org/201010061749/Pachodo.org-English-Articles/history-of-southern-sudan-hoss.html |archivedate=2011-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This initiated the [[Second Sudanese Civil War]] (1983–2005).

'''''Aktion T4''''' (German, {{IPA-de|akˈtsi̯oːn teː fiːɐ|pron}}) was a postwar name for mass murder through involuntary euthanasia&lt;!--oxymoron--&gt; in [[Nazi Germany]].{{sfn|Sandner|1999|p=385}}{{efn|Sandner wrote that the term Aktion T4 was first used in post-war trials against doctors involved in the killings and later included in the historiography.{{sfn|Sandner|1999|p=385}}}} The name T4 is an abbreviation of ''[[Tiergartenstraße]] 4'', a street address of the Chancellery department set up in the spring of 1940, in the Berlin borough of [[Tiergarten, Berlin|Tiergarten]], which recruited and paid personnel associated with&amp;nbsp;T4.{{sfn|Hojan|Munro|2015|nopp=y}}{{sfn|Bialas|Fritze|2014|pp=263, 281}}{{sfn|Sereny|1983|p=48}}{{efn|''Tiergartenstraße'' 4 was the location of the Central Office and administrative headquarters of the ''Gemeinnützige Stiftung für Heil- und Anstalts- pflege'' (Charitable Foundation for Curative and Institutional Care).{{sfn|Sereny|1983|p=48}}}} Certain German physicians were authorized to select patients "deemed incurably sick, after most critical medical examination" and then administer to them a "mercy death" ({{lang|de|Gnadentod}}).{{sfn|Proctor|1988|p=177}} In October 1939 [[Adolf Hitler]] signed a "euthanasia note" backdated to 1 September 1939 which authorized his physician [[Karl Brandt]] and ''Reichsleiter'' [[Philipp Bouhler]] to implement the programme.

The killings took place from September 1939 until the end of the war in 1945; from 275,000 to 300,000{{efn|name=fn1}} people were killed at extermination centres in psychiatric hospitals in Germany and Austria, occupied Poland and the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]] (now the Czech Republic).{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=477}}{{sfn|Browning|2005|p=193}}{{sfn|Proctor|1988|p=191}} The number of victims was originally recorded as 70,273 but this number has been increased by the discovery of victims listed in the archives of former East Germany.&lt;ref name="denkmal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bundesarchiv"&gt;{{cite journal |author=German Federal Archive |trans-title=Euthanasie im Dritten Reich |url=https://www.bundesarchiv.de/DE/Content/Artikel/Ueber-uns/Aus-unserer-Arbeit/euthanasie-im-dritten-reich.html |journal=Bundesarchiv |publisher=German Federal Archive |title=Euthanasia in the Third Reich |date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|name=fn2|Notes on patient records from the archive "R 179" of the Chancellery of the Führer Main Office II b. Between 1939 and 1945, about 200,000 women, men, and children were murdered from psychiatric institutions of the German Reich in several covert actions by gas, medication or starvation. ''Original:'' Zwischen 1939 und 1945 wurden ca. 200.000 Frauen, Männer und Kinder aus psychiatrischen Einrichtungen des Deutschen Reichs im mehreren verdeckten Aktionen durch Vergasung, Medikamente oder unzureichende Ernährung ermordet.&lt;ref name="bundesarchiv"/&gt;}} About half of those killed were taken from church-run asylums, often with the approval of the Protestant or Catholic authorities of the institutions.{{sfn|Evans|2009|p=107}}{{sfn|Burleigh|2008|p=262}} The [[Holy See]] announced on 2 December 1940 that the policy was contrary to the natural and positive Divine law and that "the direct killing of an innocent person because of mental or physical defects is not allowed" but the declaration was not upheld by some Catholic authorities in Germany. In the summer of 1941, protests were led in Germany by [[Clemens August Graf von Galen|Bishop von Galen]], whose intervention led to "the strongest, most explicit and most widespread protest movement against any policy since the beginning of the Third Reich", according to [[Richard J. Evans]].{{sfn|Evans|2009|p=98}}

Several reasons have been suggested for the programme, including eugenics, compassion, reducing suffering, [[racial hygiene]], economy and pressure on the welfare budget.{{sfn|Burleigh|Wippermann|2014|nopp=y}}{{sfn|Adams|1990|pp=40, 84, 191}} Physicians in German and Austrian asylums continued many of the practices of ''Aktion T4'' until the defeat of Germany in 1945, in spite of its official cessation in August 1941.{{sfn|Ryan|Schuchman|2002|p=25}} The informal continuation of the policy led to 93,521 "beds emptied" by the end of 1941.{{sfn|Lifton|1986|p=142}}{{sfn|Ryan|Schuchman|2002|p=62}}{{efn|Robert Lifton and Michael Burleigh estimated that twice the official number of T4 victims may have perished before the end of the war.{{sfn|Burleigh|1995|p=}}{{page needed|date=August 2017}}{{sfn|Lifton|1986|p=142}}}}{{efn|Estimated range of 200,000 and 250,000 victims of the policy upon the arrival of Allied troops in Germany.{{sfn|Ryan|Schuchman|2002|p=62}}}} Technology developed under ''Aktion T4'' was taken over by the medical division of the Reich Interior Ministry, particularly the use of lethal gas to kill large numbers of people, along with the personnel who had participated in the development of the technology and later participated in [[Operation Reinhard]].{{sfn|Lifton|2000|p=102}} 

The technology and personnel developed were instrumental in implementing [[the Holocaust]].{{sfn|Sereny|1983|p=54}} The programme was authorized by Hitler but the killings have since come to be viewed as murders in Germany.&lt;!--there was never any doubt about the legal status of the murders--&gt; The number of people killed was about 200,000 in Germany and Austria, with about 100,000 victims in other European countries.{{efn|name=fn2}}&lt;ref name="bundesarchiv"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Inventar"&gt;{{cite web |trans-title=Quellen zur Geschichte der “Euthanasie”-Verbrechen 1939–1945 in deutschen und österreichischen Archiven |title=Sources on the History of the "Euthanasia" crimes 1939–1945 in German and Austrian Archives |url=https://www.bundesarchiv.de/geschichte_euthanasie/Inventar_euth_doe.pdf |publisher=Bundesarchiv |date=2018}} The number of people murdered is calculated at 200,000.

==Background==
[[File:EuthanasiePropaganda.jpg|thumb|This poster (from around 1938) reads: "60,000 [[Reichsmark]] is what this person suffering from a [[Genetic disorder|hereditary defect]] costs the People's community during his lifetime. Fellow citizen, that is your money too. Read '[[Neues Volk|[A] New People]]', the monthly magazine of the [[Office of Racial Policy|Bureau for Race Politics]] of the [[Nazi Party|NSDAP]]."]] 
At the beginning of the twentieth century, the sterilisation of people carrying what were considered to be hereditary defects and in some cases those exhibiting what was thought to be hereditary "antisocial" behaviour, was a respectable field of medicine. [[Canada]], [[Denmark]], [[Switzerland]] and the [[United States|US]] had passed laws enabling [[coerced sterilisation]]. Studies conducted in the 1920s ranked Germany as a country that was unusually reluctant to introduce sterilisation legislation.{{sfn|Hansen|King|2013|p=141}} In his book ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' (1924), Hitler wrote that one day racial hygiene "will appear as a deed greater than the most victorious wars of our present bourgeois era".{{sfn|Hitler||p=447}}{{date needed|date=August 2018}}{{sfn|Padfield|1990|p=260}}

In July 1933 "Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased Offspring" prescribed [[compulsory sterilisation]] for people with conditions thought to be hereditary, such as schizophrenia, [[epilepsy]], [[Huntington's disease|Huntington's chorea]] and "imbecility". Sterilisation was also legalised for chronic alcoholism and other forms of social deviance. The law was administered by the Interior Ministry under [[Wilhelm Frick]] through special [[Hereditary Health Court]]s ({{lang|de|Erbgesundheitsgerichte}}), which examined the inmates of nursing homes, asylums, prisons, aged-care homes and special schools, to select those to be sterilised.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=507–508}} It is estimated that 360,000 people were sterilised under this law between 1933 and 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Forced Sterilization |website=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum |url=https://www.ushmm.org/learn/students/learning-materials-and-resources/mentally-and-physically-handicapped-victims-of-the-nazi-era/forced-sterilization }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The policy and research agenda of racial hygiene and eugenics were promoted by [[Emil Kraepelin]].{{sfn|Engstrom|Weber|Burgmair|2006|p=1710}} The [[eugenic sterilization]] of persons diagnosed with (and viewed as predisposed to) [[schizophrenia]] was advocated by [[Eugen Bleuler]], who presumed racial deterioration because of “mental and physical cripples” in his ''Textbook of Psychiatry'',

{{quote|The more severely burdened should not propagate themselves… If we do nothing but make mental and physical cripples capable of propagating themselves, and the healthy stocks have to limit the number of their children because so much has to be done for the maintenance of others, if natural selection is generally suppressed, then unless we will get new measures our race must rapidly deteriorate.{{sfn|Joseph|2004|p=160}}{{sfn|Bleuler|1924|p=214}}{{sfn|Read|2004|p=36}}}} 

Within the Nazi administration, the idea of including in the program people with physical disabilities had to be expressed carefully, given that one of the most powerful figures of the regime, [[Joseph Goebbels]], had a deformed right leg.{{efn|This was the result either of [[club foot]] or [[osteomyelitis]]. Goebbels is commonly said to have had [[club foot]] (''talipes equinovarus''), a congenital condition. [[William L. Shirer]], who worked in Berlin as a journalist in the 1930s and was acquainted with Goebbels, wrote in ''[[The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich]]'' (1960) that the deformity was from a childhood attack of [[osteomyelitis]] and a failed operation to correct it.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=124}}}} After 1937 the acute shortage of labour in Germany arising from rearmament, meant that anyone capable of work was deemed to be "useful" and thus exempted from the law and the rate of sterilisation declined.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=508}} The term "Aktion T4" is a post-war coining; contemporary German terms included ''Euthanasie'' ([[euthanasia]]) and ''Gnadentod'' (merciful death).{{sfn|Miller|2006|p=160}} The T4 programme stemmed from the Nazi Party policy of "racial hygiene", a belief that the German people needed to be cleansed of racial enemies, which included anyone confined to a mental health facility and people with simple physical disabilities.{{sfn|Breggin|1993|pp=133–148}}

Karl Brandt, personal doctor to Hitler and [[Hans Lammers]], the head of the Reich Chancellery, testified after the war that Hitler had told them as early as 1933—when the sterilisation law was passed—that he favoured the killing of the incurably ill but recognised that public opinion would not accept this.{{sfn|Kershaw|2000|p=256}} In 1935, Hitler told the Leader of Reich Doctors, [[Gerhard Wagner (Nazi physician)|Gerhard Wagner]], that the question could not be taken up in peacetime, "Such a problem could be more smoothly and easily carried out in war". He wrote that he intended to "radically solve" the problem of the mental asylums in such an event.{{sfn|Kershaw|2000|p=256}} ''Aktion T4'' began with a "trial" case in late 1938. Hitler instructed Brandt to evaluate a family's petition for the "mercy killing" of their son who was blind, had physical and developmental disabilities.{{sfn|Friedman|2011|p=146}}{{efn|Robert Lifton wrote that this request was "encouraged"; the severely disabled child and the agreement of the parents to his killing were apparently genuine.{{sfn|Lifton|1986|p=50}}}} The child, born near [[Leipzig]] and eventually identified as [[Gerhard Kretschmar]], was killed in July 1939.{{sfn|Schmidt|2007|p=118}}{{sfn|Cina|Perper|2012|p=59}} Hitler instructed Brandt to proceed in the same manner in all similar cases.{{sfn|Lifton|1986|pp=50–51}}

On 18 August 1939, three weeks after the killing of the boy, the ''Reich Committee for the Scientific Registering of Hereditary and Congenital Illnesses'' was established. It was to register sick children or newborns identified as defective. The secret killing of infants began in 1939 and increased after the war started; by 1941 more than 5,000 children had been killed.{{sfn|Proctor|1988|p=10}}{{sfn|Browning|2005|p=190}} Hitler was in favour of killing those whom he judged to be ''lebensunwertes Leben'' ([[Life unworthy of life]]). In a 1939 conference with [[Leonardo Conti]], Reich Health Leader and state secretary for health in the Interior Ministry and Hans Lammers, Chief of the Reich Chancellery—a few months before the "euthanasia" decree—Hitler gave as examples the mentally ill who he said could only be "bedded on sawdust or sand" because they "perpetually dirtied themselves" and "put their own excrement into their mouths". This issue, according to the Nazi regime, assumed new urgency in wartime.{{sfn|Lifton|1986|p=62}}

After the [[invasion of Poland]], Hermann Pfannmüller said

{{quote|''Für mich ist die Vorstellung untragbar, dass beste, blühende Jugend an der Front ihr Leben lassen muss, damit verblichene Asoziale und unverantwortliche Antisoziale ein gesichertes Dasein haben.'' (It is unbearable to me that the flower of our youth must lose their lives at the front, while that feeble-minded and asocial element can have a secure existence in the asylum.){{sfn|Baader|2009|pp=18–27}}}}

Pfannmüller advocated killing by a gradual decrease of food, which he believed was more merciful than poison injections.{{sfn|Lifton|1986|pp=62–63}}{{sfn|Schmitt|1965|pp=34–35}}

[[File:Karl Brandt SS-Arzt.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Karl Brandt]], [[Hitler]]'s personal doctor and organiser of ''Aktion T4'']]
The German eugenics movement had an extreme wing even before the Nazis came to power. As early as 1920, [[Alfred Hoche]] and [[Karl Binding]] advocated killing people whose lives were "unworthy of life" (''lebensunwertes Leben''). Darwinism was interpreted by them as justification of the demand for "beneficial" genes and eradication of the "harmful" ones. [[Robert Lifton]] wrote, "The argument went that the best young men died in war, causing a loss to the ''Volk'' of the best available genes. The genes of those who did not fight (the worst genes) then proliferated freely, accelerating biological and cultural degeneration".{{sfn|Lifton|1986|p=47}} The advocacy of eugenics in Germany gained ground after 1930, when the [[Great Depression|Depression]] was used to excuse cuts in funding to state mental hospitals, creating squalor and overcrowding.{{sfn|Kershaw|2000|p=254}}

Many German eugenicists were nationalists and [[anti-Semitic|antisemites]], who embraced the Nazi regime with enthusiasm. Many were appointed to positions in the Health Ministry and German research institutes. Their ideas were gradually adopted by the majority of the German medical profession, from which Jewish and communist doctors were soon purged.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=444}} During the 1930s the Nazi Party had carried out a campaign of propaganda in favour of euthanasia. The National Socialist Racial and Political Office (NSRPA) produced leaflets, posters and short films to be shown in cinemas, pointing out to Germans the cost of maintaining asylums for the incurably ill and insane. These films included ''The Inheritance'' (''[[Das Erbe]]'', 1935), ''The Victim of the Past'' (''[[Opfer der Vergangenheit]]'', 1937), which was given a major première in Berlin and was shown in all German cinemas, and ''I Accuse'' (''[[Ich klage an]]'', 1941), which was based on a novel by Hellmuth Unger, a consultant for "child euthanasia".{{sfn|Lifton|1986|pp=48–49}}

In mid-1939 Hitler authorized the creation of the Reich Committee for the Scientific Registering of Serious Hereditary and Congenital Illnesses (''Reichsausschuss zur wissenschaftlichen Erfassung erb- und anlagebedingter schwerer Leiden''), headed by Dr. Karl Brandt, his physician, and administered by Herbert Linden of the Interior Ministry as well as [[Schutzstaffel|SS]]-''[[Oberführer]]'' [[Viktor Brack]]. Brandt and Bouhler were authorized to approve applications to kill children in relevant circumstances,{{sfn|Browning|2005|p=185}}{{sfn|Kershaw|2000|p=259}} though Bouhler left the details to subordinates such as Brack and SA-''Oberführer'' [[Werner Blankenburg]].{{sfn|Miller|2006|p=158}}

Extermination centres were established at six existing psychiatric hospitals: [[Bernburg Euthanasia Centre|Bernburg]], [[Brandenburg Euthanasia Centre|Brandenburg]], [[Grafeneck Euthanasia Centre|Grafeneck]], [[Hadamar Euthanasia Centre|Hadamar]], [[Hartheim Euthanasia Centre|Hartheim]], and [[Sonnenstein Euthanasia Centre|Sonnenstein]].{{sfn|Breggin|1993|pp=133–148}}{{sfn|Torrey|Yolken|2010|pp=26–32}} One thousand children under the age of 17 were killed at the institutions [[Am Spiegelgrund]] and [[Gugging]] in Austria.{{sfn|Local|2014|nopp=y}}{{sfn|Kaelber|2015|nopp=y}} They played a crucial role in developments leading to the Holocaust.{{sfn|Breggin|1993|pp=133–148}} As a related aspect of the "medical" and scientific basis of this programme, the Nazi doctors took thousands of brains from 'euthanasia' victims for research.{{sfn|Weindling|2006|p=6}}

[[File:Viktor Brack Nürnberg 2.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Viktor Brack]], organiser of the T4 Programme]]
From August 1939, the Interior Ministry registered children with disabilities, requiring doctors and midwives to report all cases of newborns with severe disabilities; the 'guardian' consent element soon disappeared. Those to be killed were identified as "all children under three years of age in whom any of the following 'serious hereditary diseases' were 'suspected': [[Intellectual disability|idiocy]] and [[Down syndrome]] (especially when associated with blindness and deafness); [[microcephaly]]; [[hydrocephaly]]; malformations of all kinds, especially of limbs, head, and spinal column; and paralysis, including [[Cerebral palsy|spastic]] conditions".{{sfn|Lifton|1986|p=52}} The reports were assessed by a panel of medical experts, of whom three were required to give their approval before a child could be killed.{{efn|Professors [[Werner Catel]] (a Leipzig psychiatrist) and [[Hans Heinze]], head of a state institution for children with intellectual disabilities at Görden near Brandenburg; Ernst Wentzler a Berlin pediatric psychiatrist and the author Dr. Helmut Unger.{{sfn|Lifton|1986|p=52}}}}

The Ministry used deceit when dealing with parents or guardians, particularly in Catholic areas, where parents were generally uncooperative. Parents were told that their children were being sent to "Special Sections", where they would receive improved treatment.{{sfn|Sereny|1983|p=55}} The children sent to these centres were kept for "assessment" for a few weeks and then killed by injection of toxic chemicals, typically [[phenol]]; their deaths were recorded as "[[pneumonia]]". Autopsies were usually performed and brain samples were taken to be used for "medical research". Post mortem examinations apparently helped to ease the consciences of many of those involved, giving them the feeling that there was a genuine medical purpose to the killings.{{sfn|Lifton|1986|p=60}} The most notorious of these institutions in Austria was Am Spiegelgrund, where from 1940 to 1945, 789 children were killed by lethal injection, gas poisoning and physical abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The war against the "inferior". On the History of Nazi Medicine in Vienna - Chronology |website=A project by the Documentation Center of Austrian Resistance |url=http://www.gedenkstaettesteinhof.at/en/chronology }}&lt;/ref&gt; Children's brains were preserved in jars of formaldehyde and stored in the basement of the clinic and in the private collection of [[Heinrich Gross]], one of the institution's directors, until 2001.{{sfn|Kaelber|2015|nopp=y}}

When the Second World War began in September 1939, less rigorous standards of assessment and a quicker approval process were adopted. Older children and adolescents were included and the conditions covered came to include

{{quote|... various borderline or limited impairments in children of different ages, culminating in the killing of those designated as juvenile delinquents. Jewish children could be placed in the net primarily because they were Jewish; and at one of the institutions, a special department was set up for 'minor Jewish-Aryan half-breeds'.|Lifton{{sfn|Lifton|1986|p=56}}}}

More pressure was placed on parents to agree to their children being sent away. Many parents suspected what was happening, especially when it became apparent that institutions for children with disabilities were being systematically cleared of their charges and refused consent. The parents were warned that they could lose custody of all their children and if that did not suffice, the parents could be threatened with call-up for 'labour duty'.{{sfn|Lifton|1986|p=55}} By 1941, more than 5,000 children had been killed.{{sfn|Browning|2005|p=190}}{{efn|Lifton concurs with this figure, but notes that the killing of children continued after the T4 programme was formally ended in 1941.{{sfn|Lifton|1986|p=55}}}} The last child to be killed under ''Aktion T4'' was Richard Jenne on 29 May 1945 in the children's ward of the [[Kaufbeuren]]-[[Irsee]] state hospital in [[Bavaria]], Germany, more than three weeks after U.S. Army troops had occupied the town.{{sfn|Friedlander|1995|p=163}}{{sfn|Evans|2004|p=93}}

===Invasion of Poland===

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1989-0309-501, Leonardo Conti.jpg|thumb|upright|''SS-Gruppenführer'' [[Leonardo Conti]] ]]
Brandt and Bouhler developed plans to expand the programme of euthanasia to adults. In July 1939 they held a meeting attended by Conti and Professor [[Werner Heyde]], head of the SS medical department. This meeting agreed to arrange a national register of all institutionalised people with mental illnesses or physical disabilities. The first adults with disabilities to be killed en masse by the Nazi regime were Poles. After the invasion on 1 September 1939, adults with disabilities were shot by the SS men of ''[[Einsatzkommando]]'' 16, ''[[Selbstschutz]]'' and EK-''Einmann'' under the command of SS-''Sturmbannführer'' Rudolf Tröger, with overall command by [[Reinhard Heydrich]], during the genocidal [[Operation Tannenberg]].{{sfn|Semków|2006|pp=46–48}}{{efn|The second phase of [[Operation Tannenberg]] referred to as the ''Unternehmen Tannenberg'' by Heydrich's ''Sonderreferat'' began in late 1939 under the codename ''[[Intelligenzaktion]]'' and lasted until January 1940, in which 36,000–42,000 people, including Polish children, died before the end of 1939 in Pomerania.{{sfn|Semków|2006|pp=42–50}}}} All hospitals and mental asylums of the [[Wartheland]] were emptied. The region was incorporated into Germany and earmarked for resettlement by ''[[Volksdeutsche#Volksdeutsche in German-occupied western Poland|Volksdeutsche]]'' following the German conquest of Poland.{{sfn|Friedlander|1995|p=87}} In the [[Reichsgau Danzig-West Prussia|Danzig]] (now [[Gdańsk]]) area, some 7,000 Polish patients of various institutions were shot and 10,000 were killed in the [[Gdynia]] area. Similar measures were taken in other areas of Poland destined for incorporation into Germany.{{sfn|Browning|2005|pp=186–187}} The first experiments with the gassing of patients were conducted in October 1939 at [[Fort VII]] in [[Poznań|Posen]] (occupied Poznań), where hundreds of prisoners were killed by means of [[carbon monoxide]] poisoning, in an improvised [[gas chamber]] developed by Dr [[Albert Widmann]], chief chemist of the German Criminal Police (Kripo). In December 1939, ''[[Reichsführer-SS]]'' [[Heinrich Himmler]] witnessed one of these gassings, ensuring that this invention would later be put to much wider uses.{{sfn|Browning|2005|p=188}}

[[File:Fort VII Poznań RB8.JPG|thumb|left|Bunker No. 17 in artillery wall of [[Fort VII]] in [[Poznań]], used as improvised gas chamber for early experiments]]
The idea of killing adult mental patients soon spread from occupied Poland to adjoining areas of Germany, probably because Nazi Party and SS officers in these areas were most familiar with what was happening in Poland. These were also the areas where Germans wounded from the Polish campaign were expected to be accommodated, which created a demand for hospital space. The ''[[Gauleiter]]'' of [[Pomerania]], [[Franz Schwede-Coburg]], sent 1,400 patients from five Pomeranian hospitals to undisclosed locations in occupied Poland, where they were shot. The ''Gauleiter'' of [[East Prussia]], [[Erich Koch]], had 1,600 patients killed out of sight. More than 8,000 Germans were killed in this initial wave of killings carried out on the orders of local officials, although Himmler certainly knew and approved of them.{{sfn|Browning|2005|p=190}}{{sfn|Kershaw|2000|p=261}}

The legal basis for the programme was a 1939 letter from Hitler, not a formal "Führer's decree" with the force of law. Hitler bypassed Conti, the Health Minister and his department, who might have raised questions about the legality of the programme and entrusted it to Bouhler and Brandt.{{sfn|Lifton|1986|pp=63–64}}{{efn|Several drafts of a formal euthanasia law were prepared but Hitler refused to authorise them. The senior participants in the programme always knew that it was not a law, even by the loose definition of legality prevailing in Nazi Germany.{{sfn|Lifton|1986|pp=63–64}}}}

{{quote|Reich Leader Bouhler and Dr. Brandt are entrusted with the responsibility of extending the authority of physicians, to be designated by name, so that patients who, after a most critical diagnosis, on the basis of human judgment [''menschlichem Ermessen''], are considered incurable, can be granted mercy death [''Gnadentod''].|&lt;small&gt;Adolf Hitler, 1 September 1939&lt;/small&gt;{{sfn|Miller|2006|p=160}}{{sfn|Lifton|1986|pp=63–64}}}}

The killings were administered by Viktor Brack and his staff from ''Tiergartenstraße'' 4, disguised as the "Charitable Foundation for Cure and Institutional Care" offices which served as the front and was supervised by Bouhler and Brandt.{{sfn|Padfield|1990|p=261}}{{sfn|Kershaw|2000|p=253}} The officials in charge included Dr Herbert Linden, who had been involved in the child killing programme; Dr [[Ernst-Robert Grawitz]], chief physician of the SS; and [[August Becker]], an SS chemist. The officials selected the doctors who were to carry out the operational part of the programme; based on political reliability as long-term Nazis, professional reputation and sympathy for radical eugenics. The list included physicians who had proved their worth in the child-killing programme, such as Unger, Heinze and Hermann Pfannmüller. The recruits were mostly psychiatrists, notably Professor [[Carl Schneider]] of Heidelberg, Professor [[Max de Crinis]] of Berlin and Professor [[Paul Nitsche]] from the Sonnenstein state institution. Heyde became the operational leader of the programme, succeeded later by Nitsche.{{sfn|Lifton|1986|p=64}}

===Listing of targets from hospital records===

[[File:Alkoven Schloss Hartheim 2005-08-18 3589.jpg|thumb|[[Hartheim Euthanasia Centre]], where over 18,000 people were killed.]]
In early October, all hospitals, nursing homes, old-age homes and sanatoria were required to report all patients who had been institutionalised for five years or more, who had been committed as "criminally insane", who were of "non-[[Aryan]] race" or who had been diagnosed with any on a list of conditions. The conditions included schizophrenia, epilepsy, [[Huntington's chorea]], advanced [[syphilis]], [[senile dementia]], [[paralysis]], [[encephalitis]] and "terminal neurological conditions generally". Many doctors and administrators assumed that the reports were to identify inmates who were capable of being drafted for "labour service" and tended to overstate the degree of incapacity of their patients, to protect them from labour conscription. When some institutions refused to co-operate, teams of T4 doctors (or Nazi medical students) visited and compiled the lists, sometimes in a haphazard and ideologically motivated way.{{sfn|Lifton|1986|pp=66–67}} During 1940, all Jewish patients were removed from institutions and killed.{{sfn|Browning|2005|p=191}}{{sfn|Padfield|1990|pp=261, 303}}{{sfn|Lifton|1986|p=77}}{{efn|According to Lifton, most Jewish inmates of German mental institutions were dispatched to Lublin in Poland in 1940 and killed there.{{sfn|Lifton|1986|p=77}}}}

As with child inmates, adults were assessed by a panel of experts, working at the ''Tiergartenstraße'' offices. The experts were required to make their judgements on the reports, not medical histories or examinations. Sometimes they dealt with hundreds of reports at a time. On each they marked a '''+''' (death), a '''-''' (life), or occasionally a '''?''' meaning that they were unable to decide. Three "death" verdicts condemned the person and as with reviews of children, the process became less rigorous, the range of conditions considered "unsustainable" grew broader and zealous Nazis further down the chain of command increasingly made decisions on their own initiative.{{sfn|Lifton|1986|p=67}}

==Gassing==
The first gassings in Germany proper took place in January 1940 at the Brandenburg Euthanasia Centre. The operation was headed by Brack, who said "the needle belongs in the hand of the doctor."{{sfn|Annas|Grodin|1992|p=25}} Bottled pure carbon monoxide gas was used. At trials, Brandt described the process as a "major advance in medical history".{{sfn|Lifton|1986|pp=71–72}} Once the efficacy of the method was confirmed, it became standardised, and instituted at a number of centres across Germany under the supervision of Widmann, Becker, and [[Christian Wirth]] – a [[Kripo]] officer who later played a prominent role in the [[Final Solution|extermination of the Jews]] as commandant of newly built [[death camp]]s in occupied Poland. In addition to Brandenburg, the killing centres included [[Grafeneck Castle]] in Baden-Württemberg (10,824 dead), [[Schloss Hartheim]] near [[Linz]] in Austria (over 18,000 dead), [[Sonnenstein Euthanasia Centre]] in [[Free State of Saxony|Saxony]] (15,000 dead), [[Bernburg Euthanasia Centre]] in Saxony-Anhalt and [[Hadamar Euthanasia Centre]] in Hesse (14,494 dead). The same facilities were also used to kill mentally sound prisoners transferred from [[concentration camp]]s in Germany, Austria and occupied parts of Poland.

[[File:Jan Kowalski-arcybiskup (1926-27).jpg|thumb|upright|Bishop [[Jan Maria Michał Kowalski]], killed at [[Hartheim Euthanasia Centre]].]]
Condemned patients were transferred from their institutions to newly built centres in the T4 [[Charitable Ambulance]] buses, called the Community Patients Transports Service. They were run by teams of SS men wearing white coats, to give it an air of medical care.{{sfn|Burleigh|2000|p=54}} To prevent the families and doctors of the patients from tracing them, the patients were often first sent to transit centres in major hospitals, where they were supposedly assessed. They were moved again to ''special treatment'' (''[[Sonderbehandlung]]'') centres. Families were sent letters explaining that owing to wartime regulations, it was not possible for them to visit relatives in these centres. Most of these patients were killed within 24 hours of arriving at the centres, and their bodies cremated.{{sfn|Lifton|1986|p=71}} For every person killed, a death certificate was prepared, giving a false but plausible cause of death. This was sent to the family along with an urn of ashes (random ashes, since the victims were cremated ''en masse''). The preparation of thousands of falsified death certificates took up most of the working day of the doctors who operated the centres.{{sfn|Lifton|1986|p=74}}

During 1940, the centres at Brandenburg, Grafeneck and Hartheim killed nearly 10,000 people each, while another 6,000 were killed at Sonnenstein. In all, about 35,000 people were killed in T4 operations that year. Operations at Brandenburg and Grafeneck were wound up at the end of the year, partly because the areas they served had been cleared and partly because of public opposition. In 1941, however, the centres at Bernburg and Sonnenstein increased their operations, while Hartheim (where Wirth and [[Franz Stangl]] were successively commandants) continued as before. As a result, another 35,000 people were killed before August 1941, when the T4 programme was officially shut down by Hitler. Even after that date, however, the centres continued to be used to kill concentration camp inmates: eventually some 20,000 people in this category were killed.{{efn|These figures come from the article [[:de:Aktion T4|Aktion T4]] on the German Wikipedia, which sources them to Ernst Klee.{{sfn|Klee|1983|p=}}}}

In 1971, [[Gitta Sereny]] conducted a series of interviews with Stangl, who was in prison in [[Düsseldorf]] after having been convicted of co-responsibility for killing 900,000 people as commandant of the [[Sobibor extermination camp|Sobibor]] and [[Treblinka extermination camp|Treblinka]] [[extermination camp]]s in Poland. Stangl gave Sereny a detailed account of the operations of the T4 programme based on his time as commandant of the killing facility at the Hartheim institute.{{sfn|Sereny|1983|pp=41–90}} He described how the inmates of various asylums were removed and transported by bus to Hartheim. Some were in no mental state to know what was happening to them, but many were perfectly sane, and for them various forms of deception were used. They were told they were at a special clinic where they would receive improved treatment, and were given a brief medical examination on arrival. They were induced to enter what appeared to be a shower block, where they were gassed with carbon monoxide (the ruse was also used at extermination camps).{{sfn|Sereny|1983|pp=41–90}}

==Number of euthanasia victims==
The SS functionaries and hospital staff associated with ''Aktion T4'' in the German Reich were paid from the central office at ''Tiergartenstrasse'' 4 in Berlin from the spring of 1940. The SS and police from [[Herbert Lange|''SS-Sonderkommando Lange'']] responsible for murdering the majority of patients in [[Polish areas annexed by Nazi Germany|the annexed territories of Poland]] since October 1939, took their salaries from the normal police fund, supervised by the administration of the newly formed ''Wartheland'' district; the programme in Germany and [[occupied Poland]] was overseen by Heinrich Himmler.{{sfn|Hojan|Munro|2013|nopp=y}} Before 2013, it was believed that 70,000 persons were murdered in the euthanasia programme, but the [[German Federal Archives]] reported that research in the archives of former East Germany indicated that the number of victims in Germany and Austria from 1939 to 1945 was about 200,000 persons and that another 100,000 persons were victims in other European countries.&lt;ref name="bundesarchiv"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Inventar"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Euthanasie«-Morde |url=https://www.stiftung-denkmal.de/denkmaeler/gedenk-und-informationsort-fuer-die-opfer-der-ns-euthanasie-morde.html |website=Foundation the Monument for the Murdered Jews of Europe |accessdate=4 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the German T4 centres there was at least the semblance of legality in keeping records and writing letters. In Polish psychiatric hospitals no one was left behind.&lt;!--don't know what this is supposed to mean--&gt; Killings were inflicted using gas-vans, sealed army bunkers and machine guns; families were not informed about the murdered relatives and the empty wards were handed over to the SS.{{sfn|Hojan|Munro|2013|nopp=y}}

== Technology and personnel transfer to death camps ==
{{see also|Category:Action T4 personnel|T4-Gutachter}}

After the official end of the euthanasia programme in 1941, most of the personnel and high-ranking officials, as well as gassing technology and the techniques used to deceive victims, were transferred under the jurisdiction of the national medical division of the Reich Interior Ministry. Further gassing experiments with the use of mobile gas chambers (''Einsatzwagen'') were conducted at [[Soldau concentration camp]] by Herbert Lange following [[Operation Barbarossa]]. Lange was appointed commander of the [[Chełmno extermination camp]] in December 1941. He was given three gas vans by the ''[[RSHA]]'', converted by the Gaubschat GmbH in Berlin{{sfn|Beer|2015|pp=403–417}} and before February 1942, killed 3,830 [[Polish Jews]] and around 4,000 [[Romani people|Romani]], under the guise of "resettlement".{{sfn|Ringelblum|2013|p=20}} After the [[Wannsee conference]], implementation of gassing technology was accelerated by Heydrich. Beginning in the spring of 1942, three killing factories were built secretly in east-central Poland. The ''SS'' officers responsible for the earlier ''Aktion T4'', including Wirth, Stangl and [[Irmfried Eberl]], had important roles in the implementation of the "Final Solution" for the next two years.{{sfn|Sereny|1983|p=54}}{{efn|Role of T4 "Inspector" Christian Wirth in the Holocaust.{{sfn|Sereny|1983|p=54}}}} The first killing centre equipped with stationary gas chambers modelled on technology developed under ''Aktion T4'' was established at [[Bełżec extermination camp|Bełżec]] in the [[General Government]] territory of occupied Poland; the decision preceded the Wannsee Conference of January 1942 by three months.{{sfn|Joniec|2016|pp=1–39}}

==Opposition==
[[File:Hadamar 012.JPG|thumb|Gas chamber in [[Hadamar]]]]

In January 1939, Brack commissioned a paper from Professor of [[Moral Theology]] at the [[University of Paderborn]], Joseph Mayer, on the likely reactions of the churches in the event of a state euthanasia programme being instituted. Mayer&amp;nbsp;– a longstanding euthanasia advocate&amp;nbsp;– reported that the churches would not oppose such a programme if it was seen to be in the national interest. Brack showed this paper to Hitler in July, and it may have increased his confidence that the "euthanasia" programme would be acceptable to German public opinion.{{sfn|Kershaw|2000|p=259}} Notably, when Sereny interviewed Mayer shortly before his death in 1967, he denied that he formally condoned the killing of people with disabilities but no copies of this paper are known to survive.{{sfn|Sereny|1983|p=71}}

There were those who opposed the T4 programme within the bureaucracy. [[Lothar Kreyssig]], a district judge and member of the [[Confessing Church]], wrote to Gürtner protesting that the action was illegal since no law or formal decree from Hitler had authorised it. Gürtner replied, "If you cannot recognise the will of the Führer as a source of law, then you cannot remain a judge", and had Kreyssig dismissed.{{sfn|Kershaw|2000|p=254}} Hitler had a fixed policy of not issuing written instructions for policies relating to what could later be condemned by international community, but made an exception when he provided Bouhler and Brack with written authority for the T4 programme in his confidential letter of October 1939 in order to overcome opposition within the German state bureaucracy. Hitler told Bouhler that, "the Führer's Chancellery must under no circumstances be seen to be active in this matter."{{sfn|Padfield|1990|p=261}} The Justice Minister, [[Franz Gürtner]], had to be shown Hitler's letter in August 1940 to gain his cooperation.{{sfn|Kershaw|2000|p=253}}

===Exposure===
In the towns where the killing centres were located, many people saw the inmates arrive in buses, saw the smoke from the crematoria chimneys and noticed that the buses were returning empty. In Hadamar, ashes containing human hair rained down on the town. The T4 programme was no secret. Despite the strictest orders, some of the staff at the killing centres talked about what was going on. In some cases families could tell that the causes of death in certificates were false, e.g. when a patient was claimed to have died of [[appendicitis]], even though his appendix had been surgically removed some years earlier. In other cases, several families in the same town would receive death certificates on the same day.{{sfn|Lifton|1986|p=75}} In May 1941, the Frankfurt County Court wrote to Gürtner describing scenes in Hadamar where children shouted in the streets that people were being taken away in buses to be gassed.{{sfn|Sereny|1983|p=58}}

[[File:Hans Gerhard Creutzfeldt (ca. 1920).jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Hans Gerhard Creutzfeldt]] in 1920]]
During 1940, rumours of what was taking place spread and many Germans withdrew their relatives from asylums and sanatoria to care for them at home, often with great expense and difficulty. In some places doctors and psychiatrists co-operated with families to have patients discharged or if the families could afford it, transferred them to private clinics beyond the reach of T4. Other doctors "re-diagnosed" patients so that they no longer met the T4 criteria, which risked exposure when Nazi zealots from Berlin conducted inspections. In [[Kiel]], Professor [[Hans Gerhard Creutzfeldt]] managed to save nearly all of his patients.{{sfn|Lifton|1986|pp=80, 82}} Lifton listed a handful of psychiatrists and administrators who opposed the killings; many doctors collaborated, either through ignorance, agreement with Nazi eugenicist policies or fear of the regime.{{sfn|Lifton|1986|pp=80, 82}}

Protest letters were sent to the Reich Chancellery and the Ministry of Justice, some from Nazi Party members. The first open protest against the removal of people from asylums took place at [[Absberg]] in [[Franconia]] in February 1941 and others followed. The SD report on the incident at Absberg noted that "the removal of residents from the Ottilien Home has caused a great deal of unpleasantness" and described large crowds of Catholic townspeople, among them Party members, protesting against the action.{{sfn|Lifton|1986|p=90}} Similar petitions and protests occurred throughout Austria as rumors spread of mass killings at the Hartheim Euthanasia Centre and of mysterious deaths at the children's clinic, ''Am Spiegelgrund'' in Vienna. Anna Wödl, a nurse and mother of child with a disability, vehemently petitioned to Hermann Linden at the Reich Ministry of the Interior in Berlin to prevent her son, Alfred, from being transferred from Gugging, where he lived and which also became a euthanasia center. Wödl failed and Alfred was sent to Am Spiegelgrund, where he was killed on 22 February 1941. His brain was preserved in formaldehyde for "research" and stored in the clinic for sixty years.{{sfn|NEP|2017|nopp=y}}

===Church protests===

{{main|Nazi euthanasia and the Catholic Church}}

The Lutheran theologian [[Friedrich von Bodelschwingh]] (director of the [[Bethel Institution]] for Epilepsy at [[Bielefeld]]) and Pastor Paul-Gerhard Braune (director of the Hoffnungstal Institution near Berlin) protested. Bodelschwingh negotiated directly with Brandt and indirectly with [[Hermann Göring]], whose cousin was a prominent psychiatrist. Braune had meetings with Justice Minister Gürtner, who was always dubious about the legality of the programme. Gürtner later wrote a strongly worded letter to Hitler protesting against it; Hitler did not read it but was told about it by Lammers.{{sfn|Lifton|1986|pp=90–92}} Bishop [[Theophil Wurm]], presiding the [[Evangelical-Lutheran Church in Württemberg]], wrote to Interior Minister Frick in March 1940 and the same month a confidential report from the ''[[Sicherheitsdienst]]'' (SD) in Austria, warned that the killing programme must be implemented with stealth "in order to avoid a probable backlash of public opinion during the war".{{sfn|Padfield|1990|p=304}} On 4 December 1940, Reinhold Sautter, the Supreme Church Councillor of the Württemberg State Church, complained to the Nazi Ministerial Councillor Eugen Stähle for the murders in Grafeneck Castle. Stahle said "The fifth commandment Thou shalt not kill, is no commandment of God but a Jewish invention".{{sfn|Schmuhl|1987|p=321}}

Bishop Heinrich Wienken of Berlin, a leading member of the [[Caritas Internationalis|Caritas Association]], was selected by the [[Fulda]] episcopal synod to represent the views of the Catholic Church in meetings with T4 operatives. In 2008, [[Michael Burleigh]] wrote
[[File:CAvGalenBAMS200612.jpg|thumb|upright|August von Galen]]

{{quote|Wienken seems to have gone partially native in the sense that he gradually abandoned an absolute stance based on the Fifth Commandment in favour of winning limited concessions regarding the restriction of killing to 'complete idiots', access to the sacraments and the exclusion of ill Roman Catholic priests from these policies.{{sfn|Burleigh|2008|p=261}}}}

Despite a decree issued by the Vatican on 2 December 1940 stating that the T4 policy was "against natural and positive Divine law" and that "The direct killing of an innocent person because of mental or physical defects is not allowed", the Catholic Church hierarchy in Germany decided to take no further action. Incensed by the Nazi appropriation of Church property in [[Münster]] to accommodate people made homeless by an air raid, in July and August 1941 the [[Bishop of Münster]], [[August von Galen]], gave four sermons criticizing the Nazis for arresting [[Jesuit]]s, confiscating church property and for the euthanasia program.{{sfn|Ericksen|2012|p=111}}{{sfn|Evans|2009|p=110}} Galen sent the text to Hitler by telegram, calling on

{{quote|... the Führer to defend the people against the Gestapo. It is a terrible, unjust and catastrophic thing when man opposes his will to the will of God&amp;nbsp;... We are talking about men and women, our compatriots, our brothers and sisters. Poor unproductive people if you wish, but does this mean that they have lost their right to live?{{sfn|Lifton|1986|p=93}}}}

Galen's sermons were not reported in the German press but were circulated illegally as leaflets. The text was dropped by the [[Royal Air Force]] over German troops.{{sfn|Burleigh|2008|p=262}}{{sfn|Lifton|1986|p=94}} In 2009, [[Richard J. Evans]] wrote that "This was the strongest, most explicit and most widespread protest movement against any policy since the beginning of the Third Reich".{{sfn|Evans|2009|p=98}} Local Nazis asked for Galen to be arrested but Goebbels told Hitler that such action would provoke a revolt in Westphalia and Hitler decided to wait until after the war to take revenge.{{sfn|Kershaw|2000|pp=427, 429}}{{sfn|Burleigh|2008|p=262}}

[[File:A plaque set in the pavement at No 4 Tiergartenstrasse.JPG|thumb|upright|A plaque set in the pavement at No 4 Tiergartenstraße commemorates the victims of the Nazi euthanasia programme.]]
[[File:Fort VII Poznań RB7.JPG|thumb|upright|Commemorative plaque on wall on bunker No. 17 in [[Fort VII]].]]

In 1986, Lifton wrote, "Nazi leaders faced the prospect of either having to imprison prominent, highly admired clergymen and other protesters – a course with consequences in terms of adverse public reaction they greatly feared – or else end the programme".{{sfn|Lifton|1986|p=95}} Evans considered it "at least possible, even indeed probable" that the T4 programme would have continued beyond Hitler's initial quota of 70,000 deaths but for the public reaction to Galen's sermon.{{sfn|Evans|2009|p=112}} Burleigh called assumptions that the sermon affected Hitler's decision to suspend the T4 program "wishful thinking" and noted that the various Church hierarchies did not complain after the transfer of T4 personnel to ''Aktion Reinhard''.{{sfn|Burleigh|2008|p=26}} [[Henry Friedlander]] wrote that it was not the criticism from the Church but rather the loss of secrecy and "general popular disquiet about the way euthanasia was implemented" that caused the killing to be suspended.{{sfn|Friedlander|1997|p=111}}

Galen had detailed knowledge of the euthanasia program by July 1940 but did not speak out until almost a year after Protestants had begun to protest. In 2002, Beth A. Griech-Polelle wrote that,

{{quote|Worried lest they be classified as outsiders or internal enemies, they waited for Protestants, that is the "true Germans", to risk a confrontation with the government first. If the Protestants were able to be critical of a Nazi policy, then Catholics could function as "good" Germans and yet be critical too.{{sfn|Griech-Polelle|2002|p=76}}}}

On 29 June 1943, Pope Pius XII issued the encyclical ''[[Mystici corporis Christi]]'', in which he condemned the fact that "physically deformed people, mentally disturbed people and hereditarily ill people have at times been robbed of their lives" in Germany. Following this, in September 1943, a bold but ineffectual condemnation was read by bishops from pulpits across Germany, denouncing the killing of "the innocent and defenceless mentally handicapped and mentally ill, the incurably infirm and fatally wounded, innocent hostages and disarmed prisoners of war and criminal offenders, people of a foreign race or descent".{{sfn|Evans|2009|pp=529–530}}

==Suspension of T4 killings==

On 24 August 1941, Hitler ordered the suspension of the T4 killings. After the invasion of the Soviet Union in June, many T4 personnel were transferred to the east to begin work on the [[final solution to the Jewish question]]. The projected death total for the T4 program of 70,000 deaths had been reached by August 1941.{{sfn|Burleigh|2008|p=263}} The termination of the T4 programme did not end the killing of people with disabilities; from the end of 1941, the killing of adults and children continued less systematically to the end of the war on the local initiative of institute directors and party leaders. After the bombing of Hamburg in July 1943, occupants of old age homes were killed. In the post-war trial of [[Dr. Hilda Wernicke]], Berlin, August, 1946, testimony was given that "500 old, broken women" who had survived the bombing of Stettin in June 1944 were euthanized at the Meseritz-Oberwalde Asylum.{{sfn|Aly|Chroust|1994|p=88}} The Hartheim, Bernberg, Sonnenstein and Hardamar centres continued in use as "wild euthanasia" centres to kill people sent from all over Germany, until 1945.{{sfn|Burleigh|2008|p=263}} The methods were lethal injection or starvation, those employed before use of gas chambers.{{sfn|Lifton|1986|pp=96–102}} By the end of 1941, about 100,000 people had been killed in the T4 programme.{{sfn|Hilberg|2003|p=1,066}} From mid-1941, concentration camp prisoners too feeble or too much trouble to keep alive were murdered after a cursory psychiatric examination under [[Action 14f13]].{{sfn|Hilberg|2003|p=932}}

==Post-war==

===Doctors' trial===
{{Main article|Euthanasia trials|Doctors' trial}}

After the war a series of trials was held in connection with the Nazi euthanasia programme at various places including: [[Dresden]], [[Frankfurt]], [[Graz]], [[Nuremberg]] and [[Tübingen]]. In December 1946 an American military tribunal (commonly called the Doctors' trial) prosecuted 23 doctors and administrators for their roles in war crimes and [[crimes against humanity]]. These crimes included the systematic killing of those deemed "unworthy of life", including people with mental disabilities, the people who were institutionalized mentally ill, and people with physical impairments. After 140 days of proceedings, including the testimony of 85 witnesses and the submission of 1,500 documents, in August 1947 the court pronounced 16 of the defendants guilty. Seven were sentenced to death and executed on 2 June 1948, including Brandt and Brack.

The indictment read in part:
{{quote|14. Between September 1939 and April 1945 the defendants Karl Brandt, Blome, Brack, and Hoven unlawfully, wilfully, and knowingly committed crimes against humanity, as defined by Article II of Control Council Law No. 10, in that they were principals in, accessories to, ordered, abetted, took a consenting part in, and were connected with plans and enterprises involving the execution of the so called "euthanasia" program of the German Reich, in the course of which the defendants herein murdered hundreds of thousands of human beings, including German civilians, as well as civilians of other nations. The particulars concerning such murders are set forth in paragraph 9 of count two of this indictment and are incorporated herein by reference.|International Military Tribunal{{sfn|Taylor|1949|nopp=y}}}}

Earlier, in 1945, American forces tried seven staff members of the [[Hadamar killing centre]] for the killing of Soviet and Polish nationals, which was within their jurisdiction under international law, as these were the citizens of wartime allies. (Hadamar was within the [[American Zone of Occupation]] in Germany. This was before the Allied resolution of December 1945, to prosecute individuals for "crimes against humanity" for such mass atrocities.) Alfons Klein, Karl Ruoff and Wilhelm Willig were sentenced to death and executed; the other four were given long prison sentences.{{sfn|NARA|1980|pp=1–12}} In 1946, newly reconstructed German courts tried members of the Hadamar staff for the murders of nearly 15,000 German citizens at the facility. Adolf Wahlmann and [[Irmgard Huber]], the chief physician and the head nurse, were convicted.

A '''bathroom bill''' is the common name for legislation or a statute that defines access to [[public toilet]]s (restrooms)—by [[transgender]] individuals. Bathroom bills affect access to sex-segregated public facilities for an individual based on a determination of their sex as defined in some specific way—such as their sex as [[sex assignment|assigned at birth]], their sex as listed on their [[birth certificate]], or the sex that corresponds to their [[gender identity]].&lt;ref name=vox&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.vox.com/2016/4/7/11381400/tennessee-transgender-bathroom-bill | title=Tennessee's anti-transgender bathroom bill, explained | work=Vox | date=April 7, 2016 | accessdate=April 7, 2016 | author=Lopez, German}}&lt;/ref&gt; A bathroom bill can either be inclusive or exclusive of transgender individuals, depending on the aforementioned definition of their sex.

Critics of bills which exclude transgender individuals from restrooms which conform to their gender identity argue that they do not make public restrooms any safer for [[cisgender]] (non-transgender) people, and that they make public restrooms less safe for both transgender people and [[gender non-conforming]] cisgender people.&lt;ref name="mic.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mic.com/articles/114066/statistics-show-exactly-how-many-times-trans-people-have-attacked-you-in-bathrooms|first=Marcie|last=Bianco|title=Statistics Show Exactly How Many Times Trans People Have Attacked You in Bathrooms|date=April 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rolereboot"&gt;{{cite web|title=Stop Using Women's Safety to Justify Transphobia|url=http://www.rolereboot.org/culture-and-politics/details/2016-04-stop-using-womens-safety-justify-transphobia/|date=April 12, 2016|first=Linday|last=King-Miller}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="patheos"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist/2016/04/11/more-republican-politicians-than-trans-people-have-been-arrested-for-sex-acts-in-bathrooms/|title=More Republican Politicians Than Trans People Have Been Arrested For Sex Acts in Bathrooms|last=Firma|first=Terry|date=April 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, critics claim there have been no cases of a transgender person attacking a cisgender person in a public restroom,&lt;ref name="mic.com" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Broverman|first1=Neal|title=Trump Supporter Broadcasts Live as She Chases Trans Woman Out of Bathroom|url=https://www.advocate.com/transgender/2018/5/17/trump-supporter-broadcasts-live-she-chases-trans-woman-out-bathroom|accessdate=18 May 2018|publisher=The Advocate|date=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; although there has been at least one isolated incident of voyeurism in a fitting room.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chokshi|first1=Miraj|title=Transgender Woman is Charged With Voyeurism at Target in Idaho|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/15/us/target-transgender-idaho-voyeurism.html?_r=2|accessdate=31 May 2017|work=NYT|publisher=New York Times|date=14 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By comparison, a much larger percentage of transgender people have been verbally, physically, and sexually harassed or attacked by cisgender people in public facilities.&lt;ref name="usts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transequality.org/sites/default/files/docs/USTS-Executive-Summary-FINAL.PDF|title=2015 U.S. Transgender Survey : Executive Summary|work=U.S. Transgender Survey|publisher=National Center for Transgender Equality|location=Washington}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For these reasons the controversy over transgender bathroom access has been labeled a [[moral panic]]&lt;ref name="psmag"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://psmag.com/magazine/how-social-bias-is-segregating-americas-bathrooms|title=Stalled Out: How Social Bias is Segregating America's Bathrooms|last=Wheeling|first=Kate|date=August 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and compared to the [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] [[blood libel]].&lt;ref name="savage-blood-libel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestranger.com/slog/archives/2015/02/09/florida-rep-wants-to-throw-trans-people-in-prison-for-using-public-toilets|last=Savage|first=Dan|work=The Stranger|date=February 9, 2015|title= Florida Representative Wants to Throw Trans People in Prison for Using Public Toilets}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One bathroom bill, the [[Public Facilities Privacy &amp; Security Act]] in [[North Carolina]], was approved as a law in 2016, although portions of the measure were later repealed in 2017 as part of a compromise between the Democratic governor and Republican-controlled Legislature.

Also in 2016, guidance was issued by the U.S. Departments of Justice and Education stating that schools which receive federal money must treat a student's gender identity as their sex (for example, in regard to bathrooms).&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-transgender_us_58ac4fe8e4b0a855d1d9d278 |title=Trump Administration Rescinds Protections For Transgender Students &amp;#124; HuffPost |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date=2017-02-22 |accessdate=2018-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this policy was revoked in 2017.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost2"/&gt;

==Opposition==

Critics of bathroom bills have argued that they place transgender people in danger without making cisgender people any safer and that they even make things more dangerous for gender non-conforming cisgender people.&lt;ref name="mic.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rolereboot" /&gt; The UCLA's [[Williams Institute on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Law and Public Policy|Williams Institute]] has tracked prevalence of crimes in bathrooms since the passage of various protections for the transgender population and has found that there has been no significant change in the number of crimes.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt; Marcie Bianco, writing for [[Mic (media company)|Mic]], pointed out that there is not a single documented case of a transgender person attacking a cisgender person in a public restroom.&lt;ref name="mic.com" /&gt; Writing for [[Patheos]], Terry Firma argued that there have been more Republican politicians arrested for sex acts in bathrooms than transgender people.&lt;ref name="patheos" /&gt; The controversy has been labeled a [[moral panic]],&lt;ref name="psmag" /&gt; and [[Dan Savage]] went so far as to call it an "anti-trans [[blood libel]]".&lt;ref name="savage-blood-libel" /&gt;

According to the largest U.S. survey of transgender people ever undertaken, carried out by the [[National Center for Transgender Equality]] (NCTE) in 2015 with 27,715 respondents, one percent of respondents reported being sexually assaulted in a public restroom for being transgender. Twelve percent reported being verbally harassed in a public restroom, and another one percent reported being non-sexually physically assaulted for being transgender. Nine percent reported being denied the right to use a public restroom consistent with their gender.&lt;ref name="usts" /&gt; The NCTE acknowledges that in its report that this survey was undertaken before any bathroom bills had been passed or were in the news.&lt;ref name="usts" /&gt;

== By country ==

===Canada===

In Canada, the [[New Democratic Party]] (NDP) has introduced several bills that tried to include gender identity and [[gender expression]] among the characteristics protected from discrimination and eligible to be considered in sentencing [[Hate crime|crimes motivated by hate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Garrison introduces bill to protect transgender rights |last= Nease |first=Kristy |newspaper= Goldstream Gazette |location= [[Langford, British Columbia]] |date=September 22, 2011 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; These bills were frequently referred to as "bathroom bills" by their critics as they would have allowed transgender individuals to use the public facilities corresponding to their gender identity.

In a landmark 2013 case, the Colorado Civil Rights Division ruled in favor of 6-year-old transgender student [[Growing Up Coy|Coy Mathis]] to use the girls' bathroom at her elementary school. It was the first ruling of its kind in the United States and one of the first high-profile transgender rights cases, garnering huge amounts of media attention.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2016/05/15/477954537/when-a-transgender-person-uses-a-public-bathroom-who-is-at-risk|title=When A Transgender Person Uses A Public Bathroom, Who Is At Risk?|website=NPR.org|access-date=2017-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2016, the [[United States Department of Justice]] and the [[United States Department of Education]] released a joint guidance on the application of [[Title IX]] protections to transgender students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-departments-justice-and-education-release-joint-guidance-help-schools-ensure-civil-rights|title=U.S. Departments of Justice and Education Release Joint Guidance to Help Schools Ensure the Civil Rights of Transgender Students|website=www.justice.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The guidance stated that for the purpose of Title IX, the Department of Justice and the Department of Education treat a student's [[gender identity]] as their sex.

The measure defines the term sex as "An individual's immutable biological condition of being male or female, as objectively determined by anatomy and genetics at the time of birth."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.muni.org/Departments/Assembly/Clerk/Elections/2018%20Election/2017-2_Updated_Redacted%20Final.pdf 2017-2]&lt;/ref&gt; Voters rejected the bill in April 2018.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/alaskans-vote-no-on-anti-transgender-bathroom-bill/ar-AAvAO7o?li=BBnb7Kz&amp;OCID=ansmsnnews11&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2013 proposed amendment to Arizona bill S.B.1432 would have allowed police to demand identification from anyone suspected of using the 'wrong' public bathrooms or showers, meaning the facilities assigned to the sex not matching the sex on their birth certificate.

====California====
AB 1266, also known as the "School Success and Opportunity Act," was introduced by Assemblyman Tom Ammiano on February 22, 2013. It requires that pupils be permitted to participate in sex-segregated school programs, activities, and use facilities consistent with their gender identity, without respect to the gender listed in a pupil's records. AB 1266 was approved by Governor Brown on August 12, 2013.

In September 2016, California Governor [[Jerry Brown]] signed a bathroom bill that mandates single-occupancy public bathrooms be gender-neutral in order to enable easier access for transgender people. The law went into effect on March 1, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/California-Gender-Neutral-Restroom-Bill-Becomes-Law-395340641.html California Gender-Neutral Restroom Bill Becomes Law].

Massachusetts prohibited discrimination in sex-segregated facilities based on gender identity in 2016.

{{Main|Public Facilities Privacy &amp; Security Act}}
On March 23, 2016, North Carolina Governor [[Pat McCrory]] (R) signed into law the [[Public Facilities Privacy &amp; Security Act]] (commonly known as House Bill 2). The law states that in government buildings, individuals (such as students at state-operated schools) may only use restrooms and changing facilities that correspond to the sex identified on their birth certificates. Transgender persons born in North Carolina can obtain modified birth certificates on which their sex is different than what was originally [[sex assignment|identified at the time of their birth]], but only if they have undergone [[sex reassignment surgery]].&lt;ref name=NCTL&gt;{{cite web |last=Shoichet |first=Catherine E. |url= http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/03/us/north-carolina-gender-bathrooms-law-opposing-views/|title=North Carolina transgender law: Is it discriminatory? |website=[[CNN]] |date=April 5, 2016 |accessdate=November 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For those born in other places, the ability to change the sex listed on a birth certificate is governed by their place of birth (which may have substantially different requirements, and in some cases may not allow such changes).&lt;ref name=NCTL/&gt;

The bill also overturns an [[Anti-LGBT discrimination in the United States|LGBT anti-discrimination]] ordinance that had been passed by [[Charlotte, North Carolina]], prevents local governments in the state from enacting similar ordinances, and prevents cities from raising their [[minimum wage]]s higher than that of the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/03/north-carolina-lgbt-discrimination-transgender-bathrooms/475125/ |title=North Carolina Overturns LGBT-Discrimination Bans |work=[[The Atlantic]] | date=March 24, 2016 | accessdate=April 7, 2016 | author=Graham, David A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 26, 2016, a [[U.S. District Court]] judge granted a preliminary injunction, preventing the [[University of North Carolina]] from enforcing the restroom provisions of the bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Geidner|first1=Chris|title=Federal Judge Orders UNC Not To Enforce 'Bathroom Bill' Provision Of Anti-LGBT Law|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/chrisgeidner/federal-judge-orders-unc-not-to-enforce-bathroom-bill-provis|website=[[Buzzfeed]]|accessdate=August 26, 2016|date=August 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 30, 2017, the legislature partially repealed House Bill 2, removing the restrictions on restroom use by transgender individuals. The compromise agreement was criticized by both LGBT rights groups and conservatives.&lt;ref name="nytimes-30mar2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fausset|first1=Richard|title=Bathroom Law Repeal Leaves Few Pleased in North Carolina|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/30/us/north-carolina-senate-acts-to-repeal-restrictive-bathroom-law.html|accessdate=March 30, 2017|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 6, 2016, the [[Tennessee]] House Education Administration and Planning Committee, which is part of the [[Tennessee House of Representatives]], approved a bathroom bill that would apply to public schools and colleges in the state and would require students to use a restroom that corresponds with their sex as identified at birth.&lt;ref name=vox/&gt;&lt;ref name=TennPulls/&gt; Before the bill could proceed further, the house sponsor of the bill decided to delay its consideration for a year to allow for further investigation, citing concerns that it could interfere with Title IX funding.&lt;ref name=TennPulls&gt;{{Cite web |first=Joel |last=Ebert |url=http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/politics/2016/04/18/transgender-bathroom-bill-sponsor-pulls-proposal-until-next-year/83192670/ |title=Transgender bathroom bill dead for year |newspaper=[[The Tennessean]] |date=April 18, 2016 |access-date=July 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the bill was re-introduced, but died in the Senate Education Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tennessee transgender bathroom bill fails in Senate panel|url=http://wreg.com/2017/03/22/tennessee-transgender-bathroom-bill-fails-in-senate-panel/|accessdate=October 9, 2017|agency=AP|publisher=News Channel 3|date=March 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Texas====

A bill introduced to the Texas House of Representatives in March 2015 proposed that any student who encountered another student who does not identify with their "biological sex" in a shared restroom could be awarded $2,000 in damage reparations for "mental anguish." The school itself would also be liable for failing to take action against known transgender students using their gender identified restroom.&lt;ref name="Texas transphobic legislature proposal news"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brydumm|first1=Sunnivie|title=Texas Doubles Down on Transphobic Legislation, Adding $2,000 Fine for 'Wrong' Bathroom Use|url=http://www.advocate.com/politics/transgender/2015/03/10/texas-doubles-down-transphobic-legislation-adding-2000-fine-wrong-ba|publisher=Advocate|date=March 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=H.B.

Another bill, introduced to the Texas House in February 2015, suggested that anyone over the age of 13 years found to be in a public restroom of a gender not their own should be charged with a Class A misdemeanor, spend up to a year in jail, and face a $4000 fine.&lt;ref name="Advocate Texas Bill 1748"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kellaway|first1=Mitch|title=Texas Bill Would Jail Those Whose Chromosomes Don't Match the Restroom They're Using|url=http://www.advocate.com/politics/transgender/2015/02/24/texas-bill-would-jail-those-whose-chromosomes-dont-match-restroom-th|publisher=Advocate|date=February 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under this proposed bill, building managers who repeatedly and knowingly allow transgender individuals to use the facility of their gender identity would also face a fine of up to $10,000.&lt;ref name="H.B. 1748 Texas"&gt;{{cite web|title=H.B 1748|url=http://www.legis.state.tx.us/tlodocs/84R/billtext/html/HB01748I.htm|publisher=Texas Legislature}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several bills were filed in both the regular legislative session and first special session of the [[Texas Legislature]] in 2017. Sponsored by State Sen. Lois Kolkhorst and championed by Lt. Governor [[Dan Patrick (politician)|Dan Patrick,]] the [[Texas Senate]] passed SB6 in the regular session and SB3 in the Special Session by a vote of 21-10 largely along party lines (Senator [[Eddie Lucio Jr.]] was the only Democrat to vote in favor of each bill). Neither bill went to the House floor for a vote (although SB6 received a hearing by the House's State Affairs committee). SB6 would have limited bathroom access based on the sex listed on one's birth certificate while SB3 would have allowed an individual to use the restroom listed on several state IDs as well (e.g. driver's license or [[Concealed carry in the United States|concealed carry license]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dallasnews.com/news/texas-legislature/2017/03/14/bathroom-bill-gets-first-thumbs-texas-senate |title=Bathroom of 'biological sex' bill passes Texas Senate |date=March 14, 2017 |work=Dallas Morning News |accessdate=March 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.texastribune.org/2017/07/25/texas-senate-votes-advance-bathroom-bill-again/ |title=Texas Senate Votes Again To Advance "Bathroom Bill" |date=July 25, 2017 |work=The Texas Tribune |accessdate=September 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Speaker of the Texas House of Representatives|Speaker]] of the Texas House [[Joe Straus]] voiced his opposition to the bills, citing the economic impact that North Carolina saw while HB2 was law. He was also quoted by a [[The New Yorker|''New Yorker'']] article as saying, "I'm disgusted by all this. Tell the lieutenant governor I don't want the suicide of a single Texan on my hands."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/07/10/americas-future-is-texas |title=America's Future Is Texas |date=July 10, 2017 |work=New Yorker |accessdate=September 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2018, Kolkhorst indicated that she would try again to pass similar legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Smith |first1=Gwendolyn |title=GOP reboots for another round of anti-trans bathroom bills in TX |url=https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2018/09/gop-reboots-another-round-anti-trans-bathroom-bills-tx/ |accessdate=14 September 2018 |publisher=LGBTQ Nation |date=13 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Vermont====
On May 11, 2018, Vermont Gov. Phil Scott signed a bill requiring all single-user public restrooms to be gender-neutral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ring|first1=Trudy|title=Vermont Gov.

====Virginia====
In 2016, Del. [[Mark Cole (politician)|Mark Cole]] sponsored House Bill 663, a bathroom bill restricting public restroom use according to a person's "anatomical sex", defined as "the physical condition of being male or female, which is determined by a person's anatomy", with violators liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $50. HB663 was introduced on January 11, 2016 and died in committee in February 2016.&lt;ref name=HB663-2016&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?161+sum+HB663 |title=HB 663 Restroom facilities; use of facilities in public buildings or schools |author=Cole, Mark L. |date=11 January 2016 |publisher=Virginia General Assembly |accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was widely reported that HB663 would require adults to inspect the genitals of children before they were allowed to enter the appropriate facilities, but this was dismissed by ''[[Snopes]]'' as a misleading interpretation of the bill's text,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.snopes.com/mark-cole-controversy/ |title=Cole's Law |author=LaCapria, Kim |date=13 January 2016 |publisher=Snopes |accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which states that administrators "shall develop and implement policies that require every restroom ... that is designated for use by a specific gender to solely be used by individuals whose anatomical sex matches such gender designation."&lt;ref name=HB663-2016 /&gt; Cole sponsored House Bill 781 one day later on January 12, 2016, which used the same wording but substituted "biological sex" for "anatomical sex". The use of "biological sex" allowed for an update via amended birth certificate. HB781 also died in committee in February.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?161+sum+HB781 |title=HB 781 Restroom facilities; use of facilities in public buildings or schools, definition of biological sex |author=Cole, Mark L. |date=11 January 2016 |publisher=Virginia General Assembly |accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2017, HB1612, proposed by Republican [[Bob Marshall (Virginia politician)|Bob Marshall]] would use the "born sex" to define which restroom, changing facility, or private area in government buildings was permitted for a given individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Koma|first1=Alex|title=Del.

Additionally, HB1612 required school principals to inform the parents of a child if the child did not wish to identify as their born sex. The bill was killed in subcommittee on January 19, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Subcommittee kills Virginia transgender "bathroom bill"|url=http://wtkr.com/2017/01/19/virginia-bathroom-bill-struck-dead-at-at-the-house-of-delegates-subcommittee-meeting/|website=[[WTKR]]|accessdate=January 20, 2017|date=January 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Washington====
In early 2015, SB 6548, which would prevent transgender individuals from using the bathroom associated with the gender with which they identify was introduced in the senate but failed to pass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://app.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?BillNumber=6548&amp;Year=2015|title=SB 6548 - 2015-16|publisher=Washington State Legislature}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2015, Washington State's Human Rights Commission enacted a rule that allowed transgender individuals to use bathrooms conforming with their gender identities. Early in 2016, a bill to overturn the ruling (SB 6443) was voted on in the state Senate, and defeated by a margin of 25-24.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.advocate.com/politics/2016/2/11/transphobic-bathroom-bill-dies-washington-state|title=Transphobic Bathroom Bill Dies in Washington State|date=February 11, 2016|access-date=January 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; An attempt to put a state voter initiative on the November 2016 ballot, I-1515, failed to reach the number of signatures necessary to appear on the ballot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/local/politics/article/I-1515-the-bathroom-initiative-fails-to-make-8346927.php|title=I-1515, the 'bathroom initiative,' fails to make November ballot|newspaper=seattlepi.com|access-date=January 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 5, 2016, a new bill, HB 1011 was pre-filed in the Washington State House. This bill would prevent transgender individuals from using a bathroom of their gender identity unless they have had sex-reassignment surgery, and would prevent local municipalities from enacting ordinances contradicting the directive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lgbtqnation.com/2016/12/washington-state-gop-lawmakers-introduce-anti-transgender-bathroom-bill/|title=Washington State GOP lawmakers introduce anti-transgender bathroom bill|newspaper=LGBTQ Nation|access-date=January 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Wisconsin====
In November 2015, [[Wisconsin]] held a hearing on a bathroom bill to require public schoolchildren to use facilities that match the sex they were assigned at birth. According to critics, the bill would also violate the federal government's [[Office for Civil Rights]]'s 2014 statement that federal nondiscrimination law covered gender identity. The following month, the bill was revised to allow public schools to offer gender-neutral bathrooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.twincities.com/2015/12/16/bill-revised-to-allow-gender-neutral-bathrooms-in-wisconsin-schools/ | title=Bill revised to allow gender-neutral bathrooms in Wisconsin schools | work=St. Paul Pioneer Press | date=December 16, 2015 | accessdate=April 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://host.madison.com/wsj/news/local/govt-and-politics/if-passed-gop-transgender-bathroom-bill-would-be-first-in/article_d0190e46-b6b1-595b-a1c8-4a5cd52860f2.html | title=If passed, GOP transgender bathroom bill would be first in the nation | work=Madison.com | date=November 20, 2015 | accessdate=April 7, 2016 | author=Beck, Molly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Beals v Saldanha''''', [2003] 3 S.C.R. 416, 2003 SCC 72 is a leading [[Supreme Court of Canada]] decision on the [[conflict of laws]], where the Court established the requirements to enforce foreign judgments in Canada. The Court held that foreign judgments were enforceable in Canada where there was a "[[real and substantial connection]]" between the foreign jurisdiction and the subject matter giving rise to the claim.

==Background==
Geoffrey and Leueen Saldanha and Dominic Thivy were residents of Ontario and sold lots they owned in Florida to Frederick and Patricia Beals. Beals brought an action against Saldanha and Thivy when it was discovered that the defendants did not actually own the property they sold. A defence was filed with the Court but did nothing afterwards and defaulted. A jury awarded Beals $260,000 in damages.

Thivy and Saldanha were informed by a lawyer in Ontario that the judgment could not be enforced and so they did nothing.

Soon Beals brought an action in Ontario to enforce the judgment, which had grown to $800,000 with interest.

At trial the judgment was denied on the basis that the damages had been improperly assessed. On Appeal the Court allowed the foreign judgment.

The issue before the Supreme Court was whether a judgment issued by a Court in Florida could be enforced in Ontario, and whether the defendant could seek refuge under [[Section Seven of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 7]] of the ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Charter]]''.

==Reasons of the court==
In a six to three decision, the Court found that the judgment was enforceable. The Court applied the "real and substantial connection" test from the earlier decision of ''[[Morguard v. De Savoye]]'' to the international context. The test requires the Court to consider whether the subject-matter of the suit or the person involved had a "real and substantial" connection with the country. The Court noted, however, that judgments with sufficient connection will not be enforced if they are contrary to Canadian public policy, contrary to natural justice, or obtained through fraud.

==Dissent==
Justice LeBel, in dissent, argued for a strengthening of the available defences. He noted that the result in this case was overly harsh and unfair by imposing an 800,000 judgment on an 8,000 property due to essentially bad luck.&lt;ref&gt;para. 132&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed that the real and substantial connection test be modified in the international context to reflect the added hardships imposed on litigating in a foreign country.&lt;ref&gt;para. 134&lt;/ref&gt;

In his view, the defences of fraud and natural justice should be broadened in international matters&lt;ref&gt;para.217-218&lt;/ref&gt; and an additional residual category should be allowed for injustices that do not easily fit into the main categories using what lower court called a "judicial sniff test".

LeBel pointed to a number of examples such as the Hague Conference on foreign judgments had proposed to grant domestic judges to lower foreign punitive damages.&lt;ref&gt;para. 220&lt;/ref&gt; and the Loewen case, where a Mississippi jury awarded 500 million in damages against a BC company for anti-competitive practices.&lt;ref&gt;para. 228&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5099">{{Politics of Chad}}

A '''constitutional referendum''' was held in [[Chad]] on 6 June 2005. The amendments to the [[constitution of Chad|constitution]] were approved by 66% of voters.

==Background==
The proposed amendments to the constitution included the removal of two-term limit on the President, the replacement of the [[Senate (Chad)|Senate]] with a Cultural, Economic and Social Council and giving the President powers to amend the constitution.

The amendments were proposed by incumbent [[Heads of state of Chad|President]] [[Idriss Déby]], who was due to complete his second term in 2006. In June 2001 Déby had promised to step down after his second term, stating: ''I make a public commitment: I will not be candidate at the 2006 presidential election. I will not change the Constitution [...] What remains to do for me in my last mandate, is to prepare Chad for alternation in government''.

==Campaign==
While Dèby's [[Patriotic Salvation Movement]] (MPS) campaigned for "yes", the opposition was divided among those who called for a boycott of the vote and those who called for a "no" vote. The abstensionists allied themselves in the Coordination des Partis politiques pour la Défense de la Constitution (CPDC), an alliance of 24 parties including the [[Rally for Democracy and Progress (Chad)|Rally for Democracy and Progress]] and the [[Union for Renewal and Democracy]]. The parties that campaigned for a "no" vote included  the [[Front of Action Forces for the Republic]] and the [[Rally for the Republic – Lingui]].

A '''contract of carriage''' is a [[contract]] between a carrier of goods or passengers and the [[consignor]], [[consignee]] or [[passenger]]. Contracts of carriage typically define the rights, duties and liabilities of parties to the contract, addressing topics such as [[act of God|acts of God]] and including clauses such as ''[[force majeure]]''.  Among [[common carrier]]s, they are usually evidenced by standard terms and conditions printed on the reverse of a ticket or carriage document.

==Air travel==
In July 2010, it became widely public that [[Southwest Airlines]] had classified mechanical difficulties as an [[act of God]] in their contract of carriage, expanding the definition formerly shared with Delta, American, Continental and United.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= Southwest: Breakdown is now an act of God | publisher= [[Arizona Daily Star]] | date= July 24, 2010 | url= http://azstarnet.com/news/local/article_5bc41260-e1ee-57fb-8f68-fe716e9f5bad.html| accessdate= 2010-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was later clarified by the airline as mechanical difficulties beyond the airline's control, as for instance the failure of the air traffic control system, or fuel delivery systems operated by airports.

===Involuntary denial of boarding===

The rate of passengers who are involuntarily denied boarding is around 1 in 10,000 and has been falling for the 25 years between 1990 and 2015.&lt;ref&gt; [https://www.rita.dot.gov/bts/sites/rita.dot.gov.bts/files/publications/national_transportation_statistics/html/table_01_64.html  Passengers Boarded and Denied Boarding by the Largest U.S. Air Carriers] - US DOT&lt;/ref&gt;

According to aviation analyst Henry Harteveldt, the airline's Contract of carriage&lt;ref&gt;

Nonetheless, an airline has a right to do so based on the contract, in his view. "Remember, it is their aircraft and their seat — you're just renting it to get from point A to point B," Harteveldt told [[Business Insider]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/how-airline-choose-who-kick-off-flight-united-american-delta-2017-4 |title=How airlines like United choose who to kick off a flight |last=Zhang |first=Benjamin |date=April 10, 2017 |website=Business Insider |publisher=Business Insider Inc. |access-date=April 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Convention on Psychotropic Substances''' of 1971 is a United Nations [[treaty]] designed to control [[psychoactive drug]]s such as [[#Amphetamine-type stimulants|amphetamine-type stimulants]], [[barbiturate]]s, [[benzodiazepine]]s, and [[Psychedelic drug|psychedelics]] signed in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]] on 21 February 1971. The [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]] of 1961 did not ban the many newly discovered psychotropics,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tni.org/en/publication/the-un-drug-control-conventions#4 A Primer on the UN Drug Control Conventions. Transnational Institute, 2015.]&lt;/ref&gt; since its scope was limited to [[drug]]s with [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], [[coca]], and [[opium]]-like effects.

During the 1960s such [[recreational drug use|drugs]] became widely available, and government authorities opposed this for numerous reasons, arguing that along with negative health effects, drug use led to lowered moral standards. The Convention, which contains import and export restrictions and other rules aimed at limiting drug use to scientific and medical purposes, came into force on 16 August 1976. As of 2013, 183 [[member states of the United Nations|member states]] are Parties to the treaty. Many laws have been passed to implement the Convention, including the U.S. [[Psychotropic Substances Act (United States)|Psychotropic Substances Act]], the UK [[Misuse of Drugs Act 1971]], and the Canadian [[Controlled Drugs and Substances Act]]. [[Adolf Lande]], under the direction of the [[United Nations Office of Legal Affairs]], prepared the Commentary on the Convention on Psychotropic Substances. The Commentary, published in 1976, is an invaluable aid to interpreting the treaty and constitutes a key part of its [[legislative history]].

Provisions to end the international trafficking of drugs covered by this Convention are contained in the [[United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances]]. This treaty, signed in 1988, regulates [[wikt:Precursor|precursor]] chemicals to drugs controlled by the Single Convention and the Convention on Psychotropic Substances. It also strengthens provisions against [[money laundering]] and other [[drug-related crime]]s.

==History==
{{refimprove section|date=February 2017}}
International drug control began with the 1912 [[International Opium Convention]], a treaty which adopted import and export restrictions on the [[Papaver somniferum|opium poppy]]'s psychoactive derivatives. Over the next half-century, several additional treaties were adopted under [[League of Nations]] auspices, gradually expanding the list of controlled substances to encompass [[cocaine]] and other drugs and granting the [[International Narcotics Control Board|Permanent Central Opium Board]] power to monitor compliance. After the United Nations was formed in 1945, those enforcement functions passed to the UN.

In 1961, a conference of plenipotentiaries in New York adopted the [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]], which consolidated the existing drug control treaties into one document and added ''[[Cannabis]]'' to the list of prohibited plants. In order to appease the pharmaceutical interests, the Single Convention's scope was sharply limited to the list of drugs enumerated in the Schedules annexed to the treaty and to those drugs determined to have similar effects.

During the 1960s, drug use increased in Western developed nations. Young people began using hallucinogenic, stimulant, and other drugs on a widespread scale that has continued to the present. In many jurisdictions, police had no laws under which to prosecute users and traffickers of these new drugs; [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]], for instance, was not prohibited federally in the U.S. until 1967.

In 1968, "[d]eeply concerned at reports of serious damage to health being caused by LSD and similar hallucinogenic substances," the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]] (ECOSOC) passed a resolution calling on nations to limit the use of such drugs to scientific and medical purposes and to impose import and export restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date=23 May 1968 | url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/Resolutions/resolution_1968-05-23_6.html | title=1968/1294(XLIV). Urgent control measures for LSD and similar hallucinogenic substances | publisher=United Nations Economic and Social Council | accessdate=10 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, the [[United Nations General Assembly|UN General Assembly]] requested that ECOSOC call upon its [[Commission on Narcotic Drugs]] to "give urgent attention to the problem of the abuse of the psychotropic substances not yet under international control, including the possibility of placing such substances under international control".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=19 December 1968 |url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/resolution_1968-12-19_1.html |title=2433(XXIII). International control of psychotropic substances |publisher=United Nations General Assembly |accessdate=15 April 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060113112647/http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/resolution_1968-12-19_1.html |archivedate=13 January 2006 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Circa 1969, with use of [[stimulant]]s growing, ECOSOC noted with considerable consternation that the Commission "was unable to reach agreement on the applicability of the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961 to these substances".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date=5 June 1969 | url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/Resolutions/resolution_1969-06-05_4.html | title=1969/1401(XLVI). The application of urgent control measures to certain stimulant drugs | publisher=United Nations Economic and Social Council | accessdate=10 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The language of the Single Convention and its legislative history precluded any interpretation that would allow international regulation of these drugs under that treaty. A new convention, with a broader scope, would be required in order to bring those substances under control. Using the Single Convention as a template, the Commission prepared a draft convention which was forwarded to all UN member states. The [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]] scheduled a conference for early 1971 to finalize the treaty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date=20 May 1971 | url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/Resolutions/resolution_1971-05-20_1.html | title=1971/1576(L). United Nations Conference for the Adoption of a Protocol on Psychotropic Substances | publisher=United Nations Economic and Social Council | accessdate=10 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, countries had already begun passing legislation to implement the draft treaty. In 1969, Canada added Part IV to its [[Food and Drugs Act]], placing a set of "restricted substances," including LSD, [[Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]], and [[3,4-Methylenedioxyamphetamine|MDA]], under federal control. In 1970, the United States completely revamped its existing drug control laws by enacting the [[Controlled Substances Act]] (amended in 1978 by the [[Psychotropic Substances Act (United States)|Psychotropic Substances Act]], which allows the U.S. drug control Schedules to be updated as needed to comply with the Convention). In 1971, the United Kingdom passed the [[Misuse of Drugs Act 1971]]. A host of other nations followed suit. A common feature shared by most implementing legislation is the establishment of several classes or Schedules of controlled substances, similarly to the Single Convention and the Convention on Psychotropic Substances, so that compliance with international law can be assured simply by placing a drug into the appropriate Schedule.

The conference convened on 11 January 1971. Nations split into two rival factions, based on their interests. According to a [[Senate of Canada]] report, "One group included mostly developed nations with powerful pharmaceutical industries and active psychotropics markets . . . The other group consisted of developing states...with few psychotropic manufacturing facilities".&lt;ref name="CansenReport"&gt;{{cite web|year=2002 |url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/37/1/parlbus/commbus/senate/com-e/ille-e/rep-e/repfinalvol3-e.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021117164232/http://www.parl.gc.ca/37/1/parlbus/commbus/senate/com-e/ille-e/rep-e/repfinalvol3-e.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=17 November 2002 |title=CANNABIS: OUR POSITION FOR A CANADIAN PUBLIC POLICY |publisher=Parliament of Canada |accessdate=15 April 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The organic drugmaking states that had suffered economically from the Single Convention's restrictions on [[cannabis]], [[coca]], and [[opium]], fought for tough regulations on synthetic drugs. The synthetic drug-producing states opposed those restrictions. Ultimately, the developing states' lobbying power was no match for the powerful pharmaceutical industry's, and the international regulations that emerged at the conference's close on 21 February were considerably weaker than those of the Single Convention.

The Convention's adoption marked a major milestone in the development of the global drug control regime. Over 59 years, the system had evolved from a set of loose controls focused on a single drug into a comprehensive regulatory framework capable of encompassing almost any mind-altering substance imaginable. According to Rufus King, "It covers such a grab-bag of natural and manufactured items that at every stage of its consideration its proponents felt obliged to stress anew that it would not affect alcohol or tobacco abuse."&lt;ref&gt;King, Rufus. [http://www.druglibrary.net/special/king/dhu/dhu21.htm The Drug Hang Up, America's Fifty-Year Folly].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Member states==
As of February 2018, there are 184 state parties to the convention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=VI-16&amp;chapter=6&amp;lang=en Convention on Psychotropic Substances: Treaty status].&lt;/ref&gt; This total includes 182 [[member states of the United Nations]], the [[Holy See]], and the [[State of Palestine]]. The 11 UN member states that are not party to the convention are [[East Timor]], [[Equatorial Guinea]], [[Haiti]], [[Kiribati]], [[Liberia]], [[Nauru]], [[Samoa]], [[Solomon Islands]], [[South Sudan]], [[Tuvalu]], and [[Vanuatu]]. Liberia has signed the treaty but has not ratified it.

==Schedules of Controlled Substances{{anchor|Amphetamine-type stimulants}}==
:''The list of Schedules and the substances presently therein can be found on the International Narcotics Control Board's website.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite techreport |title=List of Psychotropic Substances under International Control |edition=28 |institution=International Narcotics Control Board  |date=January 2018 |url=http://www.incb.org/incb/en/psychotropics/green-list.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Convention has four Schedules of controlled substances, ranging from Schedule I (most restrictive) to Schedule IV (least restrictive). A list of psychotropic substances, and their corresponding Schedules, was annexed to the 1971 treaty. The text of the Convention does not contain a formal description of the features of the substances fitting in each Schedule, in contrast to the US [[Controlled Substances Act]] of 1970, which gave specific criteria for each Schedule in the US system. The '''amphetamine-type stimulants'''&lt;!--this term is bolded per MOS:BOLD because it redirects here--&gt; (ATS), a legal class of stimulants – not all of which are [[substituted amphetamine]]s – were defined in the 1971 treaty and in subsequent revisions.&lt;ref name="ATS-defined on page 5"&gt;{{cite web|title=AMPHETAMINE-TYPE STIMULANTS A GLOBAL REVIEW|url=http://www.unodc.org/pdf/technical_series_1996-01-01_1.pdf|publisher=United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime|accessdate=11 September 2015|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2002 European Parliament report and a 1996 UNODC report on ATS describe the international Schedules as listed below.&lt;ref name="ATS-defined on page 5" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EuroParlReport"&gt;{{cite web | author=Kathalijne Maria Buitenweg | date=6 October 2003 | url=http://www.chanvre-info.ch/info/en/Working-document-on-the-UN.html | title=Working document on the UN conventions on drugs | accessdate=15 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Schedule I''' includes drugs claimed to create a serious risk to public health, whose therapeutic value is not currently acknowledged by the Commission on Narcotic Drugs. It includes cannabis, synthetic [[Psychedelic drug|psychedelics]] such as [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]], and natural psychedelics like certain substituted tryptamines. ATS such as [[cathinone]], [[3,4-Methylenedioxyamphetamine|MDA]], and [[MDMA]] (ecstasy) also fall under this category.&lt;ref name="ATS-defined on page 5" /&gt;
* '''Schedule II''' includes certain ATS with therapeutic uses, such as delta-9-THC (including dronabinol, its synthetic form), [[amphetamine]] and [[methylphenidate]].&lt;ref name="ATS-defined on page 5" /&gt;  
* '''Schedule III''' includes [[barbiturate]] products with fast or average effects, which have been the object of serious abuse even though useful therapeutically, strongly sedative benzodiazepines like [[flunitrazepam]] and some analgesics like [[buprenorphine]].  The only ATS in this category is [[cathine]].&lt;ref name="ATS-defined on page 5" /&gt; 
* '''Schedule IV''' includes some weaker barbiturates like ([[phenobarbital]]) and other [[hypnotic|hypnotics]], [[anxiolytic]] [[benzodiazepine]]s (except flunitrazepam), and some weaker stimulants (such as [[modafinil]] and [[armodafinil]]). Over a dozen ATS are included in this category, including the substituted amphetamine [[phentermine]].&lt;ref name="ATS-defined on page 5" /&gt;

A 1999 UNODC report notes that Schedule I is a completely different regime from the other three. According to that report, Schedule I mostly contains [[hallucinogen]]ic drugs such as LSD that are produced by illicit laboratories, while the other three Schedules are mainly for licitly produced pharmaceuticals. The UNODC report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bayer |first=I. |author2=H.

Although estimates and other controls specified by the Single Convention are not present in the Convention on Psychotropic Substances, the [[International Narcotics Control Board]] corrected the omission by asking Parties to submit information and statistics not required by the Convention, and using the initial positive responses from various organic drug producing states to convince others to follow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=1 January 2005 |url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/treaty_adherence.html |title=Monthly Status of Treaty Adherence |publisher=United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime |accessdate=15 April 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060113104753/http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/treaty_adherence.html |archivedate=13 January 2006 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the Convention does impose tighter restrictions on imports and exports of Schedule I substances. A 1970 [[Bulletin on Narcotics]] report notes:&lt;ref name="Unodc.org-Report2"&gt;{{cite web|date=1 January 1970 |url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/bulletin/bulletin_1970-01-01_3_page002.html |title=The Protocol on Psychotropic Substances |publisher=United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime |accessdate=15 April 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060113112020/http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/bulletin/bulletin_1970-01-01_3_page002.html |archivedate=13 January 2006 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:''LSD, mescaline, etc., are controlled in a way which is more stringent than morphine under the narcotics treaties. [[s:Convention on Psychotropic Substances#Article 7: SPECIAL PROVISIONS REGARDING SUBSTANCES IN SCHEDULE 1|Article 7]], which sets down this regime, provides that such substances can only be moved in international trade when both exporter and importer are government authorities, or government agencies or institutions specially authorized for the purpose; in addition to this very rigid identification of supplier and recipient, in each case export and import authorization is also mandatory.''&lt;!--Their quote said Article 6, but it's really Article 7.--&gt;

==Scheduling process==
[[s:Convention on Psychotropic Substances#Article 2: SCOPE OF CONTROL OF SUBSTANCES|Article 2]] sets out a process for adding additional drugs to the Schedules. First, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) must find that the drug meets the specific criteria set forth in Article 2, Section 4, and thus is eligible for control. Then, the WHO issues an assessment of the substance that includes:
* The extent or likelihood of abuse,
* The degree of gravity in the public health and social problem,
* The degree of utility of the substance in legitimate medical therapy, and
* Whether international control measures as provided in the treaty would be appropriate and useful.

[[s:Convention on Psychotropic Substances#Article 2|Article 2, Paragraph 4]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''If the World Health Organization finds: (a) That the substance has the capacity to produce (i) (1) A state of dependence, and (2) Central nervous system stimulation or depression, resulting in hallucinations or disturbances in motor function or thinking or behaviour or perception or mood, or (ii) Similar abuse and similar ill effects as a substance in Schedule I, II, III or IV, and (b) That there is sufficient evidence that the substance is being or is likely to be abused so as to constitute a public health and social problem warranting the placing of the substance under international control, the World Health Organization shall communicate to the Commission an assessment of the substance, including the extent or likelihood of abuse, the degree of seriousness of the public health and social problem and the degree of usefulness of the substance in medical therapy, together with recommendations on control measures, if any, that would be appropriate in the light of its assessment.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Commentary'' gives alcohol and tobacco as examples of psychoactive drugs that were deemed to not fit the above criteria by the 1971 Conference which negotiated the Convention. Alcohol can cause dependence and central nervous depression resulting in disturbances of thinking and behavior, furthermore alcohol causes similar effects as barbiturates, alcohol causes very serious "public health and social problems" in many countries, and also alcohol has minimal use in modern medicine. Nevertheless, according to the ''Commentary'':
: ''Alcohol does not 'warrant' that type of control because it is not 'suitable' for the regime of the Vienna Convention. It appears obvious that the application of the administrative measures for which that treaty provides would not solve or alleviate the alcohol problem.''
Similarly, tobacco can cause dependence and has little medical use, but it was not considered to be a stimulant or depressant or to be similar to other scheduled substances. Most important, according to the ''Commentary'':
: ''[Tobacco] is not suitable for the kinds of controls for which the Vienna Convention provides, and which if applied would not make any useful impact on the tobacco problem. That problem, however serious, therefore does not 'warrant' the placing of tobacco 'under international' control, i.e. under the Vienna Convention.''

The [[Commission on Narcotic Drugs]] makes the final decision on whether to add the drug to a Schedule, "taking into account the communication from the World Health Organization, whose assessments shall be determinative as to medical and scientific matters, and bearing in mind the economic, social, legal, administrative and other factors it may consider relevant". A similar process is followed in deleting a drug from the Schedules or transferring a drug between Schedules. For instance, at its 33rd meeting, the WHO Expert Committee on Drug Dependence recommended transferring [[tetrahydrocannabinol]] to Schedule IV of the Convention, citing its medical uses and low abuse potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=WHO Expert Committee on Drug Dependence|title=WHO Expert Committee on Drug Dependence: Thirty-third Report|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MCJG1DzZfwkC&amp;pg=PA11|year=2003|publisher=World Health Organization|isbn=978-92-4-120915-1|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Commission on Narcotic Drugs has declined to vote on whether to follow the WHO recommendation and reschedule tetrahydrocannabinol. The [[United Nations Economic and Social Council|UN Economic and Social Council]], as a parent body of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs, can alter or reverse the Commission's scheduling decisions.

In the event of a disagreement about a drug's Scheduling, Article 2, Paragraph 7 allows a Party to, within 180 days of the communication of the Commission's decision, give the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|UN Secretary-General]] "a written notice that, in view of exceptional circumstances, it is not in a position to give effect with respect to that substance to all of the provisions of the Convention applicable to substances in that Schedule." This allows the nation to comply with a less stringent set of restrictions. The U.S. [[Controlled Substances Act]]'s ''21 U.S.C. § 811(d)(4)'' implies that placing a drug in Schedule IV or V of the Act is sufficient to "carry out the minimum United States obligations under paragraph 7 of article 2 of the Convention".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=22 January 2002 |url=http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/pubs/csa/811.htm |title=21 U.S.C. § 811(d)(4) |accessdate=15 April 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060110204316/http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/pubs/csa/811.htm |archivedate=10 January 2006 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; This provision, which calls for temporarily placing a drug under federal drug control in the event the Convention requires it, was invoked in 1984 with Rohypnol ([[flunitrazepam]]). Long before abuse of the drug was sufficiently widespread in the United States to meet the Act's drug control criteria, rohypnol was added to the Schedules of the Convention on Psychotropic Substances, and the U.S. government had to place rohypnol in Schedule IV of the Controlled Substances Act in order to meet its minimum treaty obligations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=11 March 1999 |url=https://www.hhs.gov/asl/testify/t990311b.html |title=Statement on "Date Rape" Drugs by Nicholas Reuter, M.P.H. |publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services |accessdate=15 April 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060516010858/http://www.hhs.gov/asl/testify/t990311b.html |archivedate=16 May 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of March 2005, 111 substances were controlled under the Convention.&lt;!--A number of derivatives (salts, esters, etc.) are also controlled informally.--&gt;

==World Health Organization evaluations of specific drugs==

===Ephedrine===
In 1998, [[ephedrine]] was recommended for control under the Convention. The [[Dietary Supplement Safety and Science Coalition]] lobbied against control, stressing the drug's history and safety, and arguing that "ephedrine is not a controlled substance in the US today, nor should it be internationally".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.herbs.org/current/archive/ephcontrol.html DSSC says ephedrine should not be a controlled substance], Herb World News Online, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; After a two-year debate, the Expert Committee on Drug Dependence decided against regulating ephedrine. However, the Commission on Narcotics Drugs and the International Narcotics Control Board listed the drug as a Table I precursor under the [[United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances]], a move that did not require WHO approval.

[[Image:Ketamine2.JPG|thumb|right|Despite its well-known presence in the rave scene, [[ketamine]] remains uncontrolled internationally due to its importance as an [[anesthetic]] in veterinary medicine.]]

===Ketamine===
The Expert Committee on Drug Dependence cautiously began investigating [[ketamine]] at its thirty-third meeting, noting, "Its use in veterinary medicine must also be considered in relation to its control".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date=17 March 2003 | url=http://www.unicri.it/min.san.bollettino/altre/915-en.pdf | format=PDF | title=WHO Expert Committee on Drug Dependence | publisher=World Health Organization | accessdate=15 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ketamine remains uncontrolled internationally, although many nations (e.g. USA and UK) have enacted restrictions on the drug.

===MDMA===
The Expert Committee's evaluation of [[MDMA]] during its 22nd meeting in 1985 was marked by pleas from physicians to allow further research into the drug's therapeutic uses. [[Paul Grof]], chairman of the Expert Committee, argued that international control was not yet warranted, and that scheduling should be delayed pending completion of more studies. The Expert Committee concluded that because there was "insufficient evidence to indicate that the substance has therapeutic usefulness," it should be placed in Schedule I. However, its report did recommend more MDMA research:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Nicholas | last=Saunders | year=1993 | title=E for Ecstasy | isbn=0-9501628-8-4 | url=http://www.erowid.org/library/books_online/e_for_ecstasy/e_for_ecstasy-a1-1.shtml#R15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:''the Expert Committee held extensive discussions concerning therapeutic usefulness of 3,4 Methylenedioxymethamphetamine. While the Expert Committee found the reports intriguing, it felt that the studies lacked the appropriate methodological design necessary to ascertain the reliability of the observations. There was, however, sufficient interest expressed to recommend that investigations be encouraged to follow up these preliminary findings. To that end, the Expert Committee urged countries to use the provisions of [[s:Convention on Psychotropic Substances#Article 7: SPECIAL PROVISIONS REGARDING SUBSTANCES IN SCHEDULE 1|Article 7]] of the Convention on Psychotropic Substances to facilitate research on this interesting substance.'' &lt;ref&gt;WHO Expert Committee on Drug Dependence, [http://whqlibdoc.who.int/trs/WHO_TRS_729.pdf Twenty-second Report], Technical Report Series 729 (1985)&lt;/ref&gt;

MDMA was added to the convention as a Schedule I controlled substance in February 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unodc.org/documents/commissions/CND/Drug_Resolutions/1980-1989/1986/CND_Decision-1986-07_S-IX.pdf |title=Decision to place MDMA into Schedule I |publisher=Commission on Narcotic Drugs |date=11 February 1986 |website=UNODC |access-date=9 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===MBDB===
[[1,3-Benzodioxolyl-N-methylbutanamine|MBDB]] (Methylbenzodioxolylbutanamine) is an [[Empathogen-entactogen|entactogen]] with similar effects to [[MDMA]]. The thirty-second meeting of the WHO Expert Committee on Drug Dependence (September 2000) evaluated MBDB and recommended against scheduling.&lt;ref name="Thirty-second Report"&gt;WHO Expert Committee on Drug Dependence, [http://whqlibdoc.who.int/trs/WHO_TRS_903.pdf Thirty-second Report], Technical Report Series 903 (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

From the WHO Expert Committee assessment of MBDB:
:''Although MBDB is both structurally and pharmacologically similar to MDMA, the limited available data indicate that its stimulant and euphoriant effects are less pronounced than those of MDMA. There have been no reports of adverse or toxic effects of MBDB in humans. Law enforcement data on illicit trafficking of MBDB in Europe suggest that its availability and abuse may now be declining after reaching a peak during the latter half of the 1990s. For these reasons, the Committee did not consider the abuse liability of MBDB would constitute a significant risk to public health, thereby warranting its placement under international control. Scheduling of MBDB was therefore not recommended.''

===Methcathinone===
Circa 1994, the United States government notified the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|UN Secretary General]] that it supported controlling [[methcathinone]], an addictive stimulant manufactured with common household products, as a Schedule I drug under the Convention. The FDA report warned of the drug's dangers, even noting that addicts in Russia were observed to often have "[[potassium permanganate]] burns on their fingers" and to "tend not to pay attention to their appearance, thus looking ragged with dirty hands and hair".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date=20 June 1994 | url=http://paranoia.lycaeum.org/stimulants/59.FR.31639 | title=International Drug Scheduling; Convention on Psychotropic Substances; Certain Stimulant/Hallucinogenic Drugs and Certain Nonbarbiturate Sedative Drugs | publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration | accessdate=15 April 2006 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060528001238/http://paranoia.lycaeum.org/stimulants/59.FR.31639 | archivedate=28 May 2006 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; With methcathinone having no medical use, the decision to place the drug in Schedule I was uncontested.

===Nicotine===
Traditionally, the UN has been reluctant to control [[nicotine]] and other drugs traditionally legal in Europe and North America, citing tolerance of a wide range of lifestyles. This contrasts with the regulatory regime for other highly addictive drugs. [[Gabriel G. Nahas]], in a [[Bulletin on Narcotics]] report, noted:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=G. G. Nahas | date=1 January 1981 | url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/bulletin/bulletin_1981-01-01_2_page002.html | title=A pharmacological classification of drugs of abuse | publisher=United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime | accessdate=10 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:''Some addictive drugs such as nicotine or caffeine (in moderate amounts) and alcohol (in small amounts) do not produce any measurable symptoms of neuropsychological toxicity. Some pharmacologists have associated the symptoms of neuropsychological toxicity with behavioural toxicity, which include in addition: suppression of normal anxiety, reduction in motivation and non-purposive or inappropriate behaviour. However, the latter behavioural symptoms do not present "markers" which may be measurable in societies accepting as "normal" a wide range of life styles.''
Nonetheless, in October 1996, the Expert Committee considered controlling nicotine, especially products such as gum, patches, nasal spray, and inhalers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=1997 |url=http://www.nida.nih.gov/DirReports/DirRep297/DirectorReport9.html |title=Director's Report to the National Advisory Council on Drug Abuse |publisher=U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse |accessdate=15 April 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060118140012/http://www.nida.nih.gov/DirReports/DirRep297/DirectorReport9.html |archivedate=18 January 2006 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The UN ultimately left nicotine unregulated. Since then, nicotine products have become even more loosely controlled; [[Nicorette]] gum, for instance, is now an [[over-the-counter drug]] in the United States.

===Tetrahydrocannabinol===
[[Tetrahydrocannabinol]] (THC), the main active ingredient in [[cannabis]], was originally placed in Schedule I when the Convention was enacted in 1971. At its twenty-sixth meeting, in response to a 1987 request from the Government of the United States that THC be transferred from Schedule I to Schedule II, the WHO Expert Committee on Drug Dependence recommended that THC be transferred to Schedule II, citing its low abuse potential and "moderate to high therapeutic usefulness" in relieving nausea in chemotherapy patients. The Commission on Narcotic Drugs rejected the proposal. However, at its twenty-seventh meeting, the WHO Expert Committee again recommended that THC be moved to Schedule II. At its 45th meeting, on 29 April 1991, the Commission on Narcotic Drugs approved the transfer of dronabinol and its stereochemical variants from Schedule I to Schedule II of the Convention, while leaving other tetrahydrocannabinols and their stereochemical variants in Schedule I.

At its thirty-third meeting (September 2002), the WHO Committee issued another evaluation of the drug and recommended that THC be moved to Schedule IV, stating:
:''The abuse liability of dronabinol (delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol) is expected to remain very low so long as cannabis continues to be readily available. The Committee considered that the abuse liability of dronabinol does not constitute a substantial risk to public health and society. In accordance with the established scheduling criteria, the Committee considered that dronabinol should be rescheduled to schedule IV of the 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances.''
No action was taken on this recommendation. And at its thirty-fourth meeting the WHO Committee recommended that THC be moved instead to Schedule III. In 2007 the Commission on Narcotic Drugs decided not to vote on whether to reschedule THC, and they requested that the WHO make another review when more information is available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unodc.org/pdf/resolutions/ga_ecosoc_cnd_2007/decision-50-01.pdf|title= Decision 50/2, Review of dronabinol and its stereoisomers|publisher=UNODC, Commission on Narcotic Drugs |date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2C-B (4-Bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine)===
[[2C-B]] is a [[psychedelic drug|psychedelic]] [[phenethylamine]]. At its thirty-second (September 2000) meeting the WHO Expert Committee on Drug Dependence recommended that 2C-B be placed in Schedule II, rather than with other scheduled psychedelics in Schedule I.&lt;ref name="Thirty-second Report"/&gt;

The committee stated that "[t]he altered state of mind induced by hallucinogens such as 2C-B may result in harm to the user and to others", but did not cite any evidence.

From the WHO Expert Committee assessment of 2C-B:
:''At high doses it is a strong hallucinogen, producing particularly marked visual hallucinations with an intense colour play, intriguing patterns emerging on surfaces and distortions of objects and faces. 2C-B is also reported to enhance sexual feelings, perception and performance.... Apart from its controversial experimental use in [[Psychedelic therapy|psychotherapy]], 2C-B, like most other hallucinogens, does not have any known therapeutic usefulness.... The Committee noted, however, that hallucinogens are rarely associated with compulsive use and that abuse of 2C-B has been infrequent, suggesting that the drug is likely to constitute a substantial, rather than an especially serious, risk to public health. For these reasons, the Committee recommended that 2C-B be placed in Schedule II of the 1971 Convention.''

==Medical and scientific uses==
Like the Single Convention, the Convention on Psychotropic Substances recognizes scientific and medical use of psychoactive drugs, while banning other uses. [[s:Convention on Psychotropic Substances#Article 7: SPECIAL PROVISIONS REGARDING SUBSTANCES IN SCHEDULE 1|Article 7]] provides that,
: ''In respect of substances in Schedule I, the Parties shall: (a) Prohibit all use except for scientific and very limited medical purposes by duly authorized persons, in medical or scientific establishments which are directly under the control of their Governments or specifically approved by them.''

In this sense, the U.S. [[Controlled Substances Act]] is stricter than the Convention requires. Both have a tightly restricted category of drugs called Schedule I, but the US Act restricts medical use of Schedule I substances to research studies, while the Convention allows broader, but limited, medical use of Schedule I substances.

==Psychedelic plants and fungi==
[[Image:Peyote Cactus.jpg|thumb|right|Article 32 makes an exception for [[peyote]] and other wild psychotropic plants, to protect use in religious rituals in case such plants themselves were in the future added to Schedule I.]]

Several of the substances originally placed in Schedule I are [[Psychedelia|psychedelic]] drugs which are contained in natural plants and fungi (such as [[peyote]] and [[psilocybin mushroom]]s) and which have long been used in religious or healing rituals. The Commentary notes the "Mexican Indian Tribes [[Mazatec people|Mazatecas]], [[Huichol people|Huicholes]] and [[Tarahumara people|Tarahumaras]]" as well as the "[[Kariri languages|Kariri]] and [[Indigenous peoples in Brazil|Pankararu]] of eastern Brazil" as examples of societies that use such plants.

[[s:Convention on Psychotropic Substances#Article 32: RESERVATIONS|Article 32, paragraph 4]] allows for States, at the time of signature, ratification or accession, to make a reservation noting an exemption for
: ''plants growing wild which contain psychotropic substances from among those in Schedule I and which are traditionally used by certain small, clearly determined groups in magical or religious rites''.

However, the official ''Commentary on the Convention on Psychotropic Substances'' makes it clear that psychedelic plants (and indeed any plants) were not included in the original Schedules and are not covered at all by the Convention. This includes "infusion of the roots" of ''[[Mimosa tenuiflora]]'' (M. hostilis; which contains [[Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]]) and "beverages" made from [[psilocybin mushroom]]s. The purpose of Paragraph 4 of Article 32 was to allow States to "make a reservation assuring them the right to permit the continuation of the traditional use in question" in the case that plants were in the future added to the Schedule I. Currently, no plants or plant products are included in the Schedules of the 1971 Convention.

: ''Commentary 32-12: It may be pointed out that at the time of this writing the continued toleration of the use of hallucinogenic substances which the 1971 Conference had in mind would not require a reservation under paragraph 4. Schedule I does not list any of the natural hallucinogenic materials in question, but only chemical substances which constitute the active principles contained in them. The inclusion in Schedule I of the active principle of a substance does not mean that the substance itself is also included therein if it is a substance clearly distinct from the substance constituting its active principle. This view is in accordance with the traditional understanding of that question in the field of international drug control. Neither the crown (fruit, mescal button) of the Peyote cactus nor the roots of the plant Mimosa hostilis [Footnote: "An infusion of the roots is used"] nor Psilocybe mushrooms [Footnote: "Beverages made from such mushrooms are used"] themselves are included in Schedule I, but only their respective active principles, mescaline, DMT and psilocybine (psilocine, psilotsin).''

: ''Commentary 32-13: It can however not be excluded that the fruit of the Peyote cactus, the roots of Mimosa hostilis, Psilocybe mushrooms or other hallucinogenic plant parts used in traditional magical or religious rites will in the future be placed in Schedule I by the operation of article 2, at a time at which the State concerned, having already deposited its instrument of ratification or accession, could no longer make the required reservation. It is submitted that Parties may under paragraph 4 make a reservation assuring them the right to permit the continuation of the traditional use in question in the case of such future actions by the Commission.''

Furthermore, in a letter, dated 13 September 2001, to the Dutch Ministry of Health, Herbert Schaepe, Secretary of the UN [[International Narcotics Control Board]], clarified that the UN Conventions do not cover "preparations" of [[Legal status of psilocybin mushrooms|psilocybin mushrooms]]:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.erowid.org/plants/mushrooms/mushrooms_law12.shtml UN's INCB Psilocybin Mushroom Policy]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;As you are aware, mushrooms containing the above substances are collected and abused for their hallucinogenic effects. As a matter of international law, no plants (natural material) containing psilocine and psilocybin are at present controlled under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances of 1971. Consequently, '''preparations made of these plants are not under international control and, therefore, not subject of the articles of the 1971 Convention'''. However, criminal cases are decided with reference to domestic law, which may otherwise provide for controls over mushrooms containing psilocine and psilocybin. As the Board can only speak as to the contours of the international drug conventions, I am unable to provide an opinion on the litigation in question.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nonetheless, in 2001 the U.S. Government, in ''[[Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal]]'', argued that [[ayahuasca]], an infusion of Mimosa hostilis and other psychoactive plants that is used in religious rituals, was prohibited in the US because of the 1971 Convention. That case involved a seizure by [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] of several drums of [[Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]]-containing liquid. Plaintiffs sued to have the drugs returned to them, claiming that they used it as a central part of their religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | year=2001 | url=https://www.state.gov/s/l/16353.htm | title=Memorandum in Opposition to Plaintiffs’ Motion for Summary Judgment in O Centro Espirita Beneficiente Uniao do Vegetal v. Reno, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Mexico, January 25, 2001. | publisher=U.S. State Department | accessdate=15 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the discussions on [[s:Convention on Psychotropic Substances#Article 32: RESERVATIONS|Article 32, paragraph 4]], noted in the Official Record of the 1971 Conference, the representative from the United States supported the explicit exemption of sacred psychoactive substances, stating: "Substances used for religious services should be placed under national rather than international control", while the representative of the [[Holy See]] observed: "If exemptions were made in favour of certain ethnic groups, there would be nothing to prevent certain organizations of [[hippie]]s from trying to make out, on religious grounds, that their consumption of psychotropic substances was permissible."&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Conference for the adoption of a Protocol on Psychotropic Substances, Official Records, Vol II, Vienna, 11 January – 19 February 1971 (E/CONF.58/7/Add.1) (page 108, paragraph 27, and page 109, paragraph 52)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organic plants==
The Commentary on the Convention on Psychotropic Substances notes that while many plant-derived chemicals are controlled by the treaty, the plants themselves are not:&lt;ref&gt;Lande, Adolf, et al.: [http://www.maps.org/pipermail/maps_forum/2001-March/003376.html Commentary on the Convention on Psychotropic Substances, New York 1976, E/CN.7/589, p.385] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121083150/http://www.maps.org/pipermail/maps_forum/2001-March/003376.html |date=21 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Shrooms.jpeg|frame|right|Psilocybin mushrooms are not controlled by the Convention, but the drugs contained in them are.]]
:''The term "synthetic" appears to refer to a psychotropic substance manufactured by a process of full chemical synthesis. One may also assume that the authors of the Vienna Convention intended to apply the term "natural material" to parts of a plant which constitute a psychotropic substance, and the term "natural psychotropic substance" to a substance obtained directly from a plant by some process of manufacturing which was relatively simple, and in any event much simpler than a process of full chemical synthesis.''
:''(...)''
:''Cultivation of plants for the purpose of obtaining psychotropic substances or raw materials for the manufacture of such substances is not "manufacture" in the sense of [[s:Convention on Psychotropic Substances#Article 1: USE OF TERMS|Article 1]], paragraph (i). Many provisions of the Vienna Convention governing psychotropic substances would be unsuitable for application to cultivation. The harvesting of psychotropic substances, i.e. separation of such substances from the plants from which they are obtained, is "manufacture".''
:''(...)''
:''The cultivation of plants from which psychotropic substances are obtained is not controlled by the Vienna Convention. (...) Neither the crown (fruit, mescal button) of the [[Peyote]] cactus nor the roots of the plant Mimosa hostilis nor Psilocybe mushrooms themselves are included in Schedule 1, but only their respective principles, [[Mescaline]], [[Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]] and [[Psilocybin]].''
[[Mexico]], in particular, argued that "production" of psychotropic drugs should not apply to wild-growing plants such as [[peyote]] cacti or [[psilocybin]] mushrooms. The [[Bulletin on Narcotics]] noted that "Mexico could not undertake to eradicate or destroy these plants".&lt;ref name="Unodc.org-Report2"/&gt; Compared to the [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]] (which calls for "uprooting of all coca bushes which grow wild" and governmental licensing, purchasing, and wholesaling of licit opium, coca, and cannabis crops), the Convention on Psychotropic Substances devotes few words to the subject of psychoactive plants.

On 2 July 1987, the United States Assistant Secretary of Health recommended that the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] initiate scheduling action under the [[Controlled Substances Act]] in order to implement restrictions required by [[cathinone]]'s Schedule I status under the Convention. The 1993 DEA rule placing cathinone in the CSA's Schedule I noted that it was effectively also banning [[khat]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date=14 January 1993 | url=http://www.erowid.org/freedom/law/federal_register/58.FR.4316.shtml | title=21 CFR Part 1308. Schedules of Controlled Substances: Placement of Cathinone and 2,5-Dimethoxy-4-ethylamphetamine Into Schedule I | publisher=U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration | accessdate=15 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:''Cathinone is the major psychoactive component of the plant Catha edulis (khat). The young leaves of khat are chewed for a stimulant effect. Enactment of this rule results in the placement of any material which contains cathinone into Schedule I.''

==Precursors==
A 1971 [[Bulletin on Narcotics]] notes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date=1 January 1971 | url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/treaties/psychotropics.html | title=The Convention on Psychotropic Substances | publisher=United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime | accessdate=16 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:''[[s:Convention on Psychotropic Substances#Article 2: SCOPE OF CONTROL OF SUBSTANCES|Article 2]], in paragraph 4 of the original text, carried over the concept in [[s:Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs#Article 3: CHANGES IN THE SCOPE OF CONTROL|Article 3]] (3) (iii) of the Single Convention, and required the application to a "precursor " – i.e. a substance "readily convertible" into a substance under control – of measures of control. In Vienna the complexity of controlling precursors of psychotropic substances was agreed to be so overwhelming that no absolute obligation to control them was provided. The new article 2 in paragraph 9 asks Parties "to use their best endeavours" to apply "such measures of supervision as may be practicable" to substances which may be used in the illicit manufacture of psychotropic substances, i.e. their precursors and possibly also substances essential in the chemistry of manufacture.''
This provision was eventually judged to be inadequate, and was strengthened by the [[United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances]]'s precursor control regime, which established two Tables of controlled precursors. The [[Commission on Narcotic Drugs]] and [[International Narcotics Control Board]] were put in charge of adding, removing, and transferring substances between the Tables.

==Analogs==
Circa 1999, the Government of Spain proposed amending Schedules I and II to include [[isomer]]s, [[ester]]s, [[ether]]s, salts of isomers, esters and ethers, and any "substance resulting from modification of the chemical structure of a substance already in Schedule I or II and which produced pharmacological effects similar to those produced by the original substances".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date=3 May 1999 | url=https://www.un.org/documents/ecosoc/docs/1999/e1999-28.htm | title=Report on the forty-second session | publisher=United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs | accessdate=15 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WHO opposed this change. The [[Commission on Narcotic Drugs]] did amend the Schedules to include [[stereoisomerism]]s, however, with the understanding that "specific isomers that did not have hazardous pharmacological activity and that posed no danger to society could be excluded from control, as [[dextromethorphan]] had been in the case of Schedule I of the 1961 Convention."

==Penal provisions==
[[File:LSDLabGlassware.jpg|frame|right|LSD and equipment used in its manufacture are subject to seizure under Article 22.]]
[[s:Convention on Psychotropic Substances#Article 22: PENAL PROVISIONS|Article 22]] provides:
:''1. (a) Subject to its constitutional limitations, each Party shall treat as a punishable offence, when committed intentionally, any action contrary to a law or regulation adopted in pursuance of its obligations under this Convention, and shall ensure that serious offences shall be liable to adequate punishment, particularly by imprisonment or other penalty of deprivation of liberty.
:''1. (b) Notwithstanding the preceding sub-paragraph, when abusers of psychotropic substances have committed such offences, the Parties may provide, either as an alternative to conviction or punishment or in addition to punishment, that such abusers undergo measures of treatment, education, after-care, rehabilitation and social reintegration in conformity with paragraph 1 of article 20.

[[conspiracy (crime)|Conspiracy]], attempts, preparatory acts, and financial operations related to drug offenses are also called on to be criminalized. Parties are also asked to count convictions handed down by foreign governments in determining [[recidivism]]. Article 22 also notes that [[extradition]] treaties are "desirable", although a nation retains the right to refuse to grant extradition, including "where the competent authorities consider that the offence is not sufficiently serious."

As with all articles of the Convention on Psychotropic Substances, the provisions of Article 22 are only suggestions which do not override the domestic law of the member countries:
:''4. The provisions of this article shall be subject to the provisions of the domestic law of the Party concerned on questions of jurisdiction.
:''5. Nothing contained in this article shall affect the principle that the offences to which it refers shall be defined, prosecuted and punished in conformity with the domestic law of a Party.

==Treatment and prevention==
[[s:Convention on Psychotropic Substances#Article 22: PENAL PROVISIONS|Article 22]] allows Parties, in implementing the Convention's penal provisions, to make exceptions for drug abusers by substituting "treatment, education, after-care, [[Drug rehabilitation|rehabilitation]] and social reintegration" for [[imprisonment]]. This reflects a shift in focus in the war on drugs from incarceration to treatment and prevention that had already begun to take hold by 1971. Indeed, in 1972, a parallel provision allowing treatment for drug abusers was added to the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs by the [[Protocol Amending the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]].

[[s:Convention on Psychotropic Substances#Article 20: MEASURES AGAINST THE ABUSE OF PSYCHOTROPIC SUBSTANCES|Article 20]] mandates drug treatment, education, and prevention measures and requires Parties to assist efforts to "gain an understanding of the problems of abuse of psychotropic substances and of its prevention" and to "promote such understanding among the general public if there is a risk that abuse of such substances will become widespread." To comply with these provisions, most Parties financially support organizations and agencies dedicated to these goals. The United States, for instance, established the [[National Institute on Drug Abuse]] in 1974 to comply with the research requirement and began sponsoring [[Drug Abuse Resistance Education]] in 1983 to help fulfill the educational and prevention requirements.

==Recent trends==

===Rise in stimulant trafficking===
Control of [[stimulant]]s has become a major challenge for the UN. In 1997, the [[World Drug Report]] warned:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=1997 |url=http://www.ias.org.uk/publications/theglobe/97issue3/globe9703_p11.html |title=World drug threat, the UN reports |publisher=United Nations International Drug Control Programme |accessdate=15 April 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051227215443/http://www.ias.org.uk/publications/theglobe/97issue3/globe9703_p11.html |archivedate=27 December 2005 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:''Since the mid-1980s the world has faced a wave of synthetic stimulant abuse, with approximately nine times the quantity seized in 1993 than in 1978, equivalent to an average annual increase of 16 per cent. The principle synthetic drugs manufactured clandestinely are the amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS) which include the widely abused [[amphetamine]] and [[methamphetamine]], as well as the more recently popularized methylenedioxymethamphetamine ([[MDMA]]), known as ecstasy." It is estimated that throughout the world 30,000,000, people use ATS. This is 0.5 per cent of the global population and exceeds the number using heroin and probably those using [[cocaine]].''
A 1998 UN General Assembly Special Session on the World Drug Problem report noted:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | year=1998 | url=https://www.un.org/ga/20special/featur/amphet.htm | title=Amphetamine-Type Stimulants: Speeding Towards the Millennium | publisher=United Nations Department of Public Information | accessdate=15 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:''Between 1971 and 1995, there was a nearly fivefold increase in the number of amphetamine-type stimulants under international control. . . [[MDMA|ecstasy]] and related designer drugs are under schedule one of the 1971 Convention, because they have virtually no medical use, while [[amphetamine]] and [[methamphetamine]] are under schedule 2 because they began life with medical use. But even though they are scheduled, the system is not really working for these illegally produced drugs. One of the main limitations of the control system is that the Psychotropic Convention was not designed to control illicit markets. It was designed to control and regulate legitimate pharmaceutical markets to prevent their [[Drug diversion|diversion]] into illicit markets.''
The report mentioned proposals to increase the flexibility of scheduling drugs under the Convention and to amend the drug-control treaties to make them more responsive to the current situation. Neither proposal has gained traction, however. Due to the ease of manufacturing methamphetamine, methcathinone, and certain other stimulants, control measures are focusing less on preventing drugs from crossing borders. Instead, they are centering on increasingly long prison sentences for manufacturers and traffickers as well as regulations on large purchases of [[wikt:Precursor|precursors]] such as [[ephedrine]] and [[pseudoephedrine]]. The International Narcotics Control Board and Commission on Narcotic Drugs help coordinate this fight by adding additional precursors to the Tables of chemicals controlled under the [[United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances]].

In 1997, ECOSOC called on nations to help enforce international law by cooperating "with relevant international organizations, such as [[Interpol]] and the [[World Customs Organization]] . . . in order to promote coordinated international action in the fight against illicit demand for and supply of amphetamine-type stimulants and their precursors." That resolution also called on governments overseeing precursor exports "to inquire with the authorities of importing States about the legitimacy of transactions of concern, and to inform the International Narcotics Control Board of the action taken, particularly when they do not receive any reply to their inquiries".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date=21 July 1997 | url=https://www.un.org/documents/ecosoc/res/1997/eres1997-41.htm | title=Implementation of comprehensive measures to counter the illicit manufacture, trafficking and abuse of amphetamine-type stimulants and their precursors | publisher=United Nations Economic and Social Council | accessdate=15 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Methamphetamine.gif|frame|right|Crystal meth has emerged as a commonly abused drug, from the American and European [[rave]] scenes to East Asia.]]
Pockets of high-intensity clandestine production and trafficking, such as rural southwest [[Virginia]], exist in most industrialized nations. However, the [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] believes that East Asia (particularly [[Thailand]]) now has the most serious amphetamine-type stimulant (ATS) problem in the world. A 2002 report by that agency noted:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=Wayne | last=Bazant | date=4 February 2002 | url=http://www.unodc.un.or.th/factsheet/ATSissuesplans310102.htm | title=Amphetamine Type Stimulants Threaten East Asia | publisher=United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime | accessdate=15 April 2006 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060526120732/http://www.unodc.un.or.th/factsheet/ATSissuesplans310102.htm | archive-date=26 May 2006 | dead-url=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:''For many countries the problem of ATS is relatively new, growing quickly and unlikely to go away. The geographical spread is widening. . . Abuse is increasingly concentrated among younger populations, who generally and erroneously believe that the substances are safe and benign. The abuse of ATS is threatening to become part of mainstream culture. The less optimistic suggest that ATS is already embedded in normative young adult behavior to such an extent that it will be very difficult to change, notwithstanding the issues of physical, social and economic damage.
The Office called on nations to bring more resources to bear in the [[demand reduction]] effort, improving treatment and [[Drug rehabilitation|rehabilitation]] processes, increasing private sector participation in eliminating drugs from the workplace, and expanding the drug information clearing house to share information more effectively.

===Canadian noncompliance===
In 2000, the [[International Narcotics Control Board]] chastised Canada for refusing to comply with the Convention's requirement that international transactions in controlled psychotropics be reported to the Board. INCB Secretary Herbert Schaepe said:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=Steven | last=Edwards | date=23 February 2000 | url=http://www.marijuananews.com/news.php3?sid=126 | title=UN Blasts Canada for Hypocrisy on Drug Trade | publisher=The National Post | accessdate=15 April 2006 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060511124308/http://marijuananews.com/news.php3?sid=126 | archive-date=11 May 2006 | dead-url=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:''From Canada there is just a big, black hole. We don't know what is going into the country, nor coming out. We cannot monitor the international movement of these substances, which is our mandate. The lack of controls in Canada means that they could be destined for fake companies that will divert them into the hands of traffickers. Traffickers in third countries could be getting them through Canada. Normally, Canada has a very good reputation for fulfilling its international obligations, but here it is just breaking the treaty – a treaty that it ratified a long time ago. It is very disturbing.''

===Licit drug problems===
In an unusual departure from its normally pro-industry leanings, the INCB issued a press release in 2001 warning of excessive use of licit psychotropics:
:''. . . the Board points to loose regulation, unreliable estimates and information regarding medical needs, aggressive marketing techniques and improper or even unethical prescription practices as the main reasons for the oversupply of such controlled substances as [[benzodiazepine]]s and various amphetamine type stimulants. Easy availability leads to overconsumption of such substances, either in the form of drug abuse or by fuelling a culture of drug-taking to deal with a variety of non-medical problems. . . Insomnia, anxiety, obesity and child hyperactivity as well as various kinds of pain are listed among the most common problems to be treated by prescribing psychotropic substances. The Board is especially concerned that preference is given to quick solutions without looking at the long-term effects, as prolonged, excessive consumption of such drugs could result in dependency and other physical and mental suffering.''

The Board also warned that the Internet provides "easy access to information on drug production and drug-taking," calling it "a growing source of on-line drug trafficking." The Board pointed out that some Internet suppliers sell controlled drugs without regard to the Convention's [[medical prescription]] requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date=15 February 2001 | url=http://www.unhchr.ch/huricane/huricane.nsf/0/61158D4A9269068EC12569F5002BFAE4?opendocument | title=United Nations Press Release | publisher=United Nations Information Service | accessdate=15 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Cumberland Law Review''''' is a [[law review]] published by the students at [[Cumberland School of Law]] in [[Birmingham, Alabama]].

Founded in 1970, the ''Review'' publishes two issues a year, with each issue averaging between 150 and 200 pages. Each issue consists of any combination of tributes, articles, essays, notes, and comments. Generally, an issue includes at least one article, note and comment. Occasionally a part of an issue or an entire issue is devoted to a single topic. In 2016, for instance, the ''Review'' published a symposium on Harper Lee's books "Go Set a Watchman" and "To Kill a Mockingbird." &lt;ref&gt;http://blurblawg.typepad.com/files/harper-lee-symposium.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The Review also hosts an annual symposium where The Review hosts speakers on topics of interest and importance to the practicing bar. On November 17, 2016, The Review successfully hosted its symposium, Alcohol in Alabama.  The event was held at Cahaba Brewing Company in Birmingham, and featured speakers on the topics of Dram Shop Act liability, DUI, and alcohol regulation.

Members of the ''Review'' staff are selected by write-on and [[bluebook]] examination from the top 15 percent of the freshman class. The process for selection is known as the Candidates Program. The first phase is the bluebook examination. If the student achieves an acceptable score the student may then participate in the Candidates Writing Competition.  The student must draft a casenote and submit it to the board for review.  A student must successfully complete both phases to earn a membership on the Law Review. Members perform cite checks, must attend mandatory meetings, and later draft a Comment of publishable quality.

{{for|treaties named after Breda|Treaty of Breda (disambiguation){{!}}Treaty of Breda}}
The '''Declaration of Breda''' (dated 4 April 1660) was a proclamation by [[Charles II of England]] in which he promised a general pardon for crimes committed during the [[English Civil War]] and the [[Interregnum (England)|Interregnum]] for all those who recognised Charles as the lawful king; the retention by the current owners of property purchased during the same period; religious toleration; and the payment of pay arrears to members of the army, and that the army would be recommissioned into service under the crown. The first three pledges were all subject to amendment by acts of parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lister|1838|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=g6ILAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA501#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 501]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Backgrounds==
{{refimprove section|date=April 2017}}
The declaration was written in response to a secret message sent by General [[George Monck]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hutton|2000|p=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was then in effective control of England. On 1 May 1660, the contents of the declaration and accompanying letters were made public. The next day Parliament passed a resolution that "government ought to be by King, Lords and Commons" and Charles was invited to England to receive his crown. On 8 May Charles was proclaimed King. On the advice of Monck, the commons rejected a resolution put forward by jurist [[Matthew Hale (jurist)|Matthew Hale]] (a member for [[Gloucestershire (UK Parliament constituency)|Gloucestershire]]) for a committee to be formed to look into the concessions  offered by Charles and to negotiate conditions with the King such as those put forward to his father in the [[treaty of Newport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lister|1838|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=g6ILAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA508#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp. 508,509]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hostettler|2002|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The declaration was named after the city of [[Breda (Netherlands)|Breda]] in the [[Netherlands]].  It was actually written in the [[Spanish Netherlands]], where Charles had been residing since March 1656; however, at the time of writing, [[Anglo-Spanish War (1654–60)|England had been at war with Spain since 1655]]. To overcome the difficulties, both practical and in terms of public relations, of a prospective King of England addressing his subjects from enemy territory, Monck advised Charles to relocate himself to the [[Dutch Republic|United Netherlands]], and to date his letters as if they were posted from Breda. Charles left [[Brussels]], his last residence in the Spanish Netherlands, and passing through [[Antwerp]] arrived in Breda on 4 April, and resided there until 14 May. Then he travelled to [[The Hague]], where he was received by the [[States General of the Netherlands]] as a ruling King of England and grandiosely entertained, and departed for England on 2 June from [[Scheveningen]] on the ''[[HMS Royal Charles (1655)|HMS Royal Charles]]'', the former ''Naseby'' which was renamed on arrival at the Dutch coast.  The declaration, however (actually several letters, addressed to Monck, the Houses of Parliament, and the City of London), was despatched as soon as Charles had crossed the border of the [[Dutch Republic]], and was dated 4 April ([[Old Style|OS]])/14 April ([[New Style|NS]]).

==Contents==
The declaration was drawn up by Charles and his three chief advisors, [[Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon|Edward Hyde]], [[James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde|James Butler]], and Nicholas Monck&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Nicholas Monck was a clergyman and brother of General [[George Monck, 1st Duke of Albemarle|George Monck]], who carried letters between his brother and Charles&amp;nbsp;II.&lt;/ref&gt;, in order to state the terms by which Charles hoped to take up "the possession of that right which God and Nature hath made our due".&lt;ref&gt;See the [[Divine Right of Kings]], on which the Stuarts insisted.&lt;/ref&gt;

The declaration promised a "free and general pardon" to any old enemies of Charles and of his father who recognised Charles II as their lawful monarch, "excepting only such persons as shall hereafter be excepted by parliament". However it had always been Charles's expectation, or at least that of his chancellor, Edward Hyde (later Earl of Clarendon), that all who had been immediately concerned in his father's death should be punished,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hallam|1859|page=406}} citing ''Life of Clarendon'', p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; and even while at a disadvantage, while professing pardon and favour to many, he had constantly excepted the regicides.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hallam|1859|page=406}} cites Clar. State Papers, iii., 427, 529.&lt;/ref&gt; Once Charles was restored to the throne, on his behalf Hyde steered the [[Indemnity and Oblivion Act]] through parliament. The act pardoned most who had sided with Parliament during the Civil War, but excepted the [[List of regicides of Charles I|regicide]]s, two prominent unrepentant republicans, [[John Lambert (general)|John Lambert]] and [[Henry Vane the Younger]],&lt;!--is this point the beginning of a new thought, or were Lambert and Vane barred from office too?--&gt; and around another twenty were forbidden to take any public office or sit in Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hallam|1859|page=408}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the declaration Charles promised religious toleration in areas where it did not disturb the peace of the kingdom,&lt;ref&gt;"a liberty to tender consciences, and that no man shall be disquieted or called in question for differences of opinion in matter of religion which do not disturb the peace of the kingdom"&lt;/ref&gt; and an act of parliament for the "granting of that indulgence". However parliament chose to interpret the threat of peace to the kingdom to include the holding of public office by non-[[Anglicanism|Anglicans]]. Between 1660 and 1665 the [[Cavalier Parliament]] passed four statutes that became known as the [[Clarendon Code]].  These severely limited the rights of Roman Catholics and nonconformists, such as the [[Puritan]]s who had reached the zenith of their influence under the Commonwealth, effectively excluding them from national and local politics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/citizenship/rise_parliament/religious.htm UK Citizenship: Religious minorities], [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]], retrieved 1 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The declaration undertook to settle the back-pay of General Monck's soldiers. The landed classes were reassured that establishing the justice of contested grants and purchases of estates that had been made "in the continued distractions of so many years and so many and great revolutions" was to be determined in Parliament. Charles II appeared to have "offered something to everyone in his terms for resuming government".&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] 15th Edition Volume 3 p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;

Copies of the Declaration were delivered to both houses of the [[Convention Parliament (1660)|Convention Parliament]] by [[John Granville, 1st Earl of Bath|John Grenville]]. Other copies with separate covering letters were delivered to Lord General George Monck to be communicated to the Lord President of the [[Council of State (England)|Council of State]] and to the Officers of the [[New Model Army|Army]] under his command, and to the Generals of the "Navy at Sea" and to the [[Lord Mayor of London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lister|1838|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=g6ILAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA500#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.500]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commemoration==
Several warships of the Royal Navy would later be named [[HMS Breda|HMS ''Breda'']] after the declaration.

An '''constitutional referendum''' was held in [[Djibouti]] on 4 September 1992. The new constitution would restore multi-party democracy for the first time since independence.&lt;ref name="English_constitution"&gt;{{cite web|title=Djibouti's Constitution of 1992 with Amendments through 2010|url=https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Djibouti_2010.pdf?lang=en|publisher=Constitute|accessdate=19 July 2016|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second question asked voters whether the number of political parties should be limited to four.

[[File:Logo of Drug Abuse Resistance Education (DARE).png|frame|right|DARE logo]]

'''Drug Abuse Resistance Education''' ('''D.A.R.E.''') is an education program that seeks to prevent use of [[controlled drugs]], membership in [[gang]]s, and violent behavior. It was founded in Los Angeles in 1983 as a joint initiative of then-[[LAPD]] chief [[Daryl Gates]] and the [[Los Angeles Unified School District]]&lt;ref name="DARE.com"&gt;http://www.dare.com/home/about_dare.asp {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100724232501/http://www.dare.com/home/about_dare.asp |date=2010-07-24 }}, the official website of the D.A.R.E. program.&lt;/ref&gt; as a [[demand]]-side drug control strategy of the American [[War on Drugs]].

[[Student]]s who enter the program sign a pledge not to use drugs or join gangs and are informed by local [[police officers]] about the dangers of [[recreational drug use]] in an interactive in-school curriculum which lasts ten weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dare.org/students-pledge-to-remain-drug-free/ | title=Students Pledge to Remain Drug-Free &amp;#124; D.A.R.E. America}}&lt;/ref&gt;

D.A.R.E. America's operating revenue has declined from $10 million in 2002 to $3.7 million in 2010 following the publication of government reports that uniformly discredited the effectiveness of the program.&lt;ref name="hitandrundec2012"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reason.com/blog/2012/12/03/dare-americas-most-famous-anti-drug-prog|title=D.A.R.E., America's Most Famous Anti-Drug Program, Will No Longer Talk to 10- and 11-Year-Old Children About Marijuana |work=Reason.com Hit and Run blog|author=Mike, Riggs, |date=3 Dec 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; D.A.R.E. implemented a new curriculum based on work by Penn State and Arizona State researchers.

Its American headquarters is in [[Inglewood, California]]. D.A.R.E. expanded to Great Britain in 1995. The D.A.R.E. program has received a substantial amount of criticism since its creation.
Dare instructors of the D.A.R.E. curriculum are local police officers who must undergo 80 hours of special training in areas such as [[child development]], [[classroom management]], [[teaching]] techniques, and [[communication]] skills. {{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} For [[high school]] instructors, 40 hours of additional training are prescribed.&lt;ref name="DARE.com"/&gt; Police officers are invited by the local school districts to speak and work with students. {{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} Police officers are permitted to work in the classroom by the school district and do not need to be licensed teachers. There are programs for different age levels. Working with the classroom teachers, the officers lead students over a number of sessions on workbooks and interactive discussions.&lt;ref name="Wikipedia"&gt;The program involves children interacting with police officers or sheriffs in a classroom environment rather than in a [[criminal justice]] setting, such as when officers must intervene in domestic violence.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dare SMO Ethan"&gt;[http://www.dare.com/home/Resources/documents/darearticles.doc D.A.R.E. is more than an anti-drug program] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926013937/http://www.dare.com/home/Resources/documents/darearticles.doc |date=September 26, 2007 }} dare.com.

In 2007, a new curriculum for [[prescription drug]] abuse and [[over-the-counter drug]] abuse was created by D.A.R.E. America. Other contributors included: law enforcement officials; [[Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America|PhRMA]]; [[Abbott Laboratories]]; the Consumer Healthcare and Products Association (CHPA); and a number of other organizations, including the [[White House Office of National Drug Control Policy|ONDCP]], the [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]], the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]], the [[National Institute on Drug Abuse|NIDA]], the [[Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration|SAMHSA]] Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (SAMHSA/CSAT) and the [[Partnership for a Drug-Free America]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/prnewswire/feeds/prnewswire/2007/12/12/prnewswire200712121620PR_NEWS_USPR_____DC09749.html New School Curriculum Addresses Rx and OTC Drug Abuse].

The program's mascot is a [[lion]] named Daren.  In various cartoons and media productions, his voice is performed by Michael Glover.

==Age groups==

Starting in 4th, 5th, or 6th grade, elementary students are given lessons to act in their own best interest when facing high-risk, low-gain choices and to resist peer pressure and other influences in making their personal choices regarding:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dare.com/officers/Curriculum/documents/ObjectivesforD.A.R.E..doc Objectives for D.A.R.E.

In 6th, 7th and 8th grades, the new ''keepin' it REAL'' middle school lessons are enhanced with activities on Teen OTC (over-the-counter)/Prescription Drug Abuse, Methamphetamine, Bullying, Gangs,  Internet Safety, and more. Beginning in the fall of 2009, D.A.R.E. officers across the nation began to teach The keepin' it REAL program which was developed in partnership with Penn State University.

In senior high school, D.A.R.E. is a reinforcement and "Equal emphasis is placed on helping students to recognize and cope with feelings of anger without causing harm to themselves or others and without resorting to violence or the use of alcohol and drugs."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dare.com/officers/Curriculum/Storyf98c.asp?N=Curriculum&amp;M=10&amp;S=12 D.A.R.E.

==Participation==

According to the D.A.R.E. website, 36 million children around the world —26 million in the U.S. — are part of the program. The program is implemented in 75% of the nation's [[school district]]s, and 43 countries around the world.&lt;ref name="DARE.com"/&gt; D.A.R.E. was one of the first national programs promoting [[zero tolerance]].

== In the United Kingdom ==
D.A.R.E. programs are now delivered in the UK by [https://lifeskills-education.co.uk Life Skills Education Charity]., a community interest company set up in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/07742739|title=LIFE SKILLS EDUCATION C.I.C. – Overview (free company information from Companies House)|website=beta.companieshouse.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  D.A.R.E. Courses currently available include the [https://lifeskills-education.co.uk/dare-primary/ D.A.R.E.

Active] programme and the newly updated [https://lifeskills-education.co.uk/dare-game/ D.A.R.E. Game].

=== History ===

D.A.R.E. began its life in the UK in 1995 after the CEO of Mansfield District Council saw it being delivered in Mansfield, Ohio whilst on an exchange visit.  The program was fully introduced within Nottinghamshire following 2 years of successful trials. To operate on a more independent basis, Drug Abuse Resistance Education (UK) Ltd was established as a registered charity and delivered it's programmed to over 320,000 young people until the organization was dissolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/03063825|title=DRUG ABUSE RESISTANCE EDUCATION (U.K.) LIMITED – Overview (free company information from Companies House)|website=beta.companieshouse.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All D.A.R.E. programs were adopted by Life Skills Education C.I.C. with the agreement of D.A.R.E. International in September 2011 and delivery into schools in the East Midlands has continued unaffected.

=== DARE Primary ===

DARE Primary is a [[life skills]] and [[drug education]] program for 9-11-year-olds. The course, consisting of 10 one-hour sessions, aims to provide children with knowledge, skills, and an opportunity to explore attitudes, to help them to make informed decisions, and to develop safe and healthy lifestyles. Topics covered include, [[tobacco]], [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], [[Inhalant abuse|volatile substances]], [[bullying]], [[anti-social behavior]], and different types of pressure. Children look at normative beliefs about alcohol and tobacco. The sessions are interactive and provide a range of learning opportunities through individual activities, [[teamwork]], discussions, storyboards, and appropriate role play. DARE Primary can be delivered by:

''•	DARE Officer (Serving or former Police Officer, Police Community Support Officer, or School Officer--- a school liaison officer)''

''•	Teacher and DARE Officer where the Officer attends every other week (called 50/50).
It also becomes part of the Health Unit in most schools. ''

''•	Teacher delivered (Teachers receive training from DARE)''

Each pupil is provided with a DARE workbook for use during the course. DARE Officers and Teachers (where the Teacher delivered option is chosen) are provided with session guides. An important part of the program is the graduation ceremony which is an opportunity for families and schools to celebrate the children's achievements.

The Primary program is now being delivered in the East Midlands, the City of [[London]], part of the Metropolitan Police area, the Falkland Islands and by the Royal Military Police in Germany, Cyprus and Malta.

=== Evaluation ===
An independent randomized control sample evaluation of the D.A.R.E. Primary program was carried out in 2015/2016 using a sample of over 50 schools and 1500 young people.  The evaluation was carried out by Nottingham Trent University's Professor [https://www.ntu.ac.uk/staff-profiles/social-sciences/andromachi-tseloni-professor Andromachi Tseloni] and [https://1cdq3nfn2kq450tgnjtk8gcc-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Summary-of-DARE-Evaluation-Report-29th-September-Version-AT.pdf showed that the program had a significantly statistic effect] on:
* Increasing knowledge surrounding drugs, alcohol and substance abuse
* Making safe and responsible choices
* Communication and listening
* Getting help from others.
Teachers have routinely rated the programme as 'Good' or 'Outstanding' and parents and young people rate it as 7.5 out of 10 in most cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://lifeskills-education.co.uk/evaluating-life-skills-programmes/|title=Evaluating Life Skills Programmes – Life Skills Education CIC|newspaper=Life Skills Education CIC|access-date=2017-02-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== D.A.R.E in the Community ('DARE Active') ===
DARE Active is principally led by DARE Champions, members of the community (professional and nonprofessional) who are actively involved in teaching, training, supporting or coaching young people and are trained and licensed by DARE UK to deliver the resource. DARE Active consists of eight sessions which can be delivered as an eight-week program or stand alone (a modular approach). It includes an optional celebration of achievement where guests can be invited to share the celebration or speak in a role model capacity. This opportunity lends itself to the local Policing teams attending and reinforcing some of the key messages.

==== Composition of sessions ====

#	Introduction to the program
#	The Six Keys to Success
#	Team building and positive communication
#	How can we work together and value others in order to achieve success
#	[[Self-Esteem]] and [[Motivation]]
#	[[Discipline]] and [[Moral responsibility|Responsibility]]
#	Preparing to attempt a new challenge
#	Review and [[Self-Assessment]] – (celebration for success)

==== DARE Active student benefits ====

*Develop key life skills to stay safe,  healthy and to make a positive contribution within society
*Set goals with success criteria for their development
*Review and assess their performance
*Raise their self-esteem and develop the skills to maximize their life opportunities
*Become inspired and motivated, to achieve their goals and focused in their lives as a whole
*Be disciplined and take responsibility for their own actions
*Develop support networks and communicate with the networks in a positive manner
*Make informed decisions about health, [[Social dilemma|social]] and [[moral dilemmas]] (e.g. misusing drugs)
*Work within the framework of personal, learning and thinking skills (Qualifications and Curriculum Authority)

=== DARE Secondary School (keepin' it REAL) ===

DARE UK is planning the launch of a Secondary school program during 2011 so it is available during the new academic year, Autumn, 2011. The curriculum and resources (including high-quality DVD) will be an adaptation of the DARE America Middle School program developed by [[Pennsylvania State University|Penn State University]], USA. Current developments are taking place to ensure relevance and suitability for the UK.

It will follow on from the DARE Primary curriculum (although this is not essential) and is designed to help young people in years 7 and 8 deal with the many challenges they face during the transition. It is expected that the program will be delivered by teachers and DARE Officers.

==Studies on effectiveness==

===1992 – Indiana University===
Researchers at [[Indiana University]], commissioned by Indiana school officials in 1992, found that those who completed the D.A.R.E. program subsequently had significantly higher rates of [[hallucinogen|hallucinogenic drug]] use than those not exposed to the program.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Alice and Kris Bosworth – [http://www.pdkmembers.org/members_online/members/orders.asp?action=results&amp;t=A&amp;desc=building+effective+drug+education&amp;text=&amp;lname_1=&amp;fname_1=&amp;lname_2=&amp;fname_2=&amp;kw_1=&amp;kw_2=&amp;kw_3=&amp;kw_4=&amp;mn1=&amp;yr1=&amp;mn2=&amp;yr2=&amp;c1= Building effective drug education programs.]}}[[Phi Delta Kappa]] International ''Research Bulletin'' No 19, December, 1887.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, three [[RTI International]] scientists evaluated eight previously-done quantitative analyses on DARE's efficacy that were found to meet their requirements for rigor.&lt;ref name="journal26"/&gt;&lt;ref name="journal24"/&gt; The researchers found that DARE's long-term effect couldn't be determined, because the corresponding studies were "compromised by severe control group attrition or contamination."&lt;ref name="journal24"&gt;{{cite journal

===1995 – California Department of Education===
In 1995, a report to the [[California Department of Education]] by Joel Brown Ph. D. stated that none of California's [[drug education]] programs worked, including D.A.R.E. "California's drug education programs, D.A.R.E. being the largest of them, simply don't work. More than 40 percent of the students told researchers they were 'not at all' influenced by drug educators or programs. Nearly 70 percent reported neutral to negative feelings about those delivering the antidrug message. While only 10 percent of elementary students responded to drug education negatively or indifferently, this figure grew to 33 percent of middle school students and topped 90 percent at the high school level." In some circles educators and administrators have admitted that DARE in fact potentially increased students exposure and knowledge of unknown drugs and controlled substances, resulting in experimentation and consumption of narcotics at a much younger age. Criticism focused on failure and misuse of tax-payer dollars, with either ineffective or negative result state-wide.

===1998 – National Institute of Justice===
In 1998, a grant from the National Institute of Justice to the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]] resulted in a report to the NIJ, which among other statements, concluded that "D.A.R.E. does not work to reduce substance use."&lt;ref name="NIJWHATWORKS"&gt;Lawrence W. Sherman, [[Denise  Gottfredson]], Doris MacKenzie, John Eck, Peter Reuter, and Shawn Bushway – [http://www.ncjrs.gov/works Preventing Crime: What Works, What Doesn’t, What’s Promising.] Report for the National Institute of Justice. Chapter 5. School-based Crime Prevention 1998. Quote: ''In summary, using the criteria adopted for this report, D.A.R.E. does not work to reduce substance use. The programs (sic) content, [[teaching method]]s, and use of uniformed police officers rather than teachers might each explain its weak evaluations. No scientific evidence suggests that the D.A.R.E. core curriculum, as originally designed or revised in 1993, will reduce substance use in the absence of continued instruction more focused on social competency development. Any consideration of the D.A.R.E.'s potential as a drug prevention strategy should place D.A.R.E. in the context of instructional strategies in general. No instructional program is likely to have a dramatic effect on substance use. Estimates of the effect sizes of even the strongest of these programs are typically in the mid- to high-teens. D.A.R.E.'s meager effects place it at the bottom of the distribution of effect sizes, but none of the effects are large enough to justify their use as the centerpiece of a drug prevention strategy. Rather, such programs should be embedded within more comprehensive programs using the additional strategies identified elsewhere in this chapter.''&lt;/ref&gt; D.A.R.E. expanded and modified the social competency development area of its curriculum in response to the report. Research by Dr. Dennis Rosenbaum in 1998&lt;ref name="Rosenbaum"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rosenbaum |first1=Dennis P |first2=Gordon S |last2=Hanson |title=Assessing the effects of school-based drug education: A six-year multilevel analysis of project D.A.R.E. |journal=Journal of Research in Crime and Delinquency |year=1998 |volume=35 |issue=4 |pages=381–412 |url=http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/library/uic.htm |doi=10.1177/0022427898035004002}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that D.A.R.E. graduates were more likely than others to drink [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]], [[tobacco smoking|smoke tobacco]] and use [[illegal drug]]s. Psychologist Dr. William Colson asserted in 1998 that D.A.R.E. increased drug awareness so that "as they get a little older, they (students) become very curious about these drugs they've learned about from police officers."&lt;ref&gt;Laugesen, W. The dire consequences of D.A.R.E.. ''Boulder Weekly'', December 4, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; The scientific research evidence in 1998 indicated that the officers were unsuccessful in preventing the increased awareness and curiosity from being translated into illegal use.

===1999 – Lynam ''et al.''===
A ten-year study was completed by the Donald R. Lynam and colleagues in 2006 involving one thousand D.A.R.E. graduates in an attempt to measure the effects of the program. After the ten-year period, no measurable effects were noted. The researchers compared levels of alcohol, cigarette, marijuana and the use of illegal substances before the D.A.R.E. program (when the students were in sixth grade) with the post D.A.R.E. levels (when they were 20 years old). Although there were some measured effects shortly after the program on the attitudes of the students towards drug use, these effects did not seem to carry on long term.&lt;ref&gt;Donald R. Lynam, Richard Milich, Rick Zimmerman, Scott P. Novak, T. K. Logan, Catherine Martin, Carl Leukefeld, and Richard Clayton. "Project DARE: No Effects at 10-Year Follow-Up," , ''Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology'', vol. 67, no. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2001 – Office of the Surgeon General===
In 2001, the [[Surgeon General of the United States]], [[David Satcher]] M.D. Ph.D., placed the D.A.R.E. program in the category of "Ineffective Primary Prevention Programs".&lt;ref name="surgeon general" /&gt; The U.S. General Accounting Office concluded in 2003 that the program was sometimes counterproductive in some populations, with those who graduated from D.A.R.E. later having higher than average rates of drug use (a [[boomerang effect (psychology)|boomerang effect]]).

===2007 – ''Perspectives on Psychological Science''===
In March 2007, the D.A.R.E. program was placed on a list of treatments that have the potential to cause harm in clients in the [[Association for Psychological Science|APS]] journal, ''Perspectives on Psychological Science''.&lt;ref&gt;Lilienfeld, S. O. (2007). Psychological treatments that cause harm. ''Perspectives on Psychological Science'', ''2'', 53–70.&lt;/ref&gt;

===2008 – Harvard===

Carol Weiss, Erin Murphy-Graham, Anthony Petrosino, and Allison G. Gandhi, "The Fairy Godmother—and Her Warts: Making the Dream of Evidence-Based Policy Come True," American Journal of Evaluation, Vol. 29 No.1, 29–47(2008) Evaluators sometimes wish for a Fairy Godmother who would make decision makers pay attention to evaluation findings when choosing programs to implement. The U.S. Department of Education came close to creating such a Fairy Godmother when it required school districts to choose drug abuse prevention programs only if their effectiveness was supported by "scientific" evidence. The experience showed advantages of such a procedure (e.g., reduction in support for D.A.R.E., which evaluation had found wanting) but also shortcomings (limited and in some cases questionable evaluation evidence in support of other programs). Federal procedures for identifying successful programs appeared biased. In addition, the Fairy Godmother discounted the professional judgment of local educators and did little to improve the fit of programs to local conditions. Nevertheless, giving evaluation more clout is a worthwhile way to increase the rationality of decision making. The authors recommend research on procedures used by other agencies to achieve similar aims.

===2009 – Texas A&amp;M===

"The Social Construction of 'Evidence-Based' Drug Prevention Programs: A Reanalysis of Data from the Drug Abuse Resistance Education (DARE) Program," Evaluation Review, Vol. 33, No.4, 394–414 (2009). Studies by Dennis Gorman and Carol Weiss argue that the D.A.R.E. program has been held to a higher standard than other youth drug prevention programs. Gorman writes, "what differentiates D.A.R.E. from many of the programs on evidence-based lists might not be the actual intervention but rather the manner in which data analysis is conducted, reported, and interpreted." Dennis M. Gorman and J. Charles Huber, Jr.

As the D.A.R.E. program has been subjected to increasing scrutiny over the years, its overall effectiveness has become something of a [[controversy]] and is still much debated.

The D.A.R.E. program is consistent with the "zero-tolerance orthodoxy of current U.S. drug control policy." According to researcher Dr. D. M.

===Use of children as informants===
"Children are asked to submit to D.A.R.E. police officers sensitive written questionnaires that can easily refer to the kids' homes" and that "a D.A.R.E. lesson called 'The Three R's: Recognize, Resist, Report' … encourages children to tell friends, teachers or police if they find drugs at home."&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Joel. ''Bad Trip: How the War Against Drugs is Destroying America''. NY: Nelson Thomas, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, "D.A.R.E. officers are encouraged to put a 'D.A.R.E. Box' in every classroom, into which students may drop 'drug information' or questions under the pretense of anonymity. Officers are instructed that if a student 'makes a disclosure related to drug use,' the officer should report the information to further authorities, both school, and police. This apparently applies whether the 'drug use' was legal or illegal, harmless or harmful. In a number of communities around the country, students have been enlisted by the D.A.R.E. officer as informants against their parents."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drcnet.org/DARE/section6.html Different Look at D.A.R.E.]&lt;/ref&gt;

"In the official D.A.R.E. Implementation Guide, police officers are advised to be alert for signs of children who have relatives who use drugs. D.A.R.E. officers are first and foremost police officers and thus are duty-bound to follow up leads that might come to their attention through inadvertent or indiscreet comments by young children."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20020208233155/http://www.fff.org/freedom/0297d.asp Bovard, James. Destroying Families for the Glory of the Drug War, Part 1. Freedom Daily, February 1997]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, children sometimes confide the names of people they suspect are illegally using drugs. In October 2010, an elementary school student in North Carolina brought cannabis to school to turn his parents in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Elementary student brings pot to school to turn in his parents |url=http://www.wbtv.com/Global/story.asp?S=13330034|date=16 Oct 2010|work=wbtv.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Responses to criticism===

==== Motivation of the critics ====
D.A.R.E. America has generally dismissed many criticisms and independent studies of its program, labeling them false, misleading, or biased. "D.A.R.E. has long dismissed criticism of its approach as flawed or the work of groups that favor decriminalization of drug use," according to the ''New York Times'' in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;Zernike, Kate. The anti-drug program says it will adopt a new strategy. ''The New York Times'', February 15, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; In a press release titled "Pro-drug Groups Behind Attack on Prevention Programs; D.A.R.E. Seen as Target as Mayors' Conference Called to Combat Legalization Threat," D.A.R.E. asserted that pro-drug legalization individuals and groups were behind criticisms of the program, which were portrayed as based on "vested interests" and "to support various individual personal agendas at the expense of our children."&lt;ref name="jeff Elliot"/&gt;

D.A.R.E. has attacked critics for allegedly being motivated by their financial self-interest in programs that compete with D.A.R.E. It has charged that "they are setting out to find ways to attack our programs and are misusing science to do it. The bottom line is that they don't want police officers to do the work because they want it for themselves."&lt;ref&gt;[http://chronicle.com/weekly/v48/i08/08a01201.htm Miller, David. D.A.R.E. ''Chronicle of Higher Education'', 10/19/01]&lt;/ref&gt; Critics have also been dismissed as being jealous of D.A.R.E.'s success.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/library/dare6.htm Cauchon, Dennis. D.A.R.E. doesn't work: Studies find drug program not effective. ''USA Today'', October 11, 1993.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Rebuttal of statistics ====

Ronald J. Brogan, New York City's D.A.R.E. fundraiser, and spokesperson said in 1999 that "If you take German for 17 weeks, you're not going to speak German. The critics say the effect dissipates over the years. No shit, Sherlock."&lt;ref name=truthord/&gt; The article in which he was quoted observed that "DARE officials say the solution to this problem is not less DARE but more of it, and they urge cities to teach DARE in middle and high school."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

One leader explained that "I don't have any statistics for you. Our strongest numbers are the numbers that don't show up."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reason.com/news/show/27892.html Sullum, Jacob. D.A.R.E. Aware, Reason, January 2001]&lt;/ref&gt;  The 1998 University of Maryland report presented to the U.S. National Institute of Justice stated, "Officials of D.A.R.E. America are often quoted as saying that the strong public support for the program is a better indicator of its utility than scientific studies."&lt;ref name="NIJWHATWORKS" /&gt;

==== New curriculum ====

In 2009, D.A.R.E. adopted the keepin' it REAL curriculum.&lt;ref name="pennkir"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "hecht1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hecht|first=Michael|author2=Colby, Margaret |author3=Miller-Day, Michelle |title=The dissemination of keepin' it REAL through D.A.R.E.

The program was developed by Penn State researchers, who evaluated its effectiveness, though critics contend the program does not implement a long-term evaluation system.&lt;ref name=pennkir/&gt; In 2013, the [[Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration]] ranked its "readiness for dissemination" at 1.5 out of 4.&lt;ref name=pennkir/&gt; Two field [[randomized controlled trial]]s showed the effectiveness of the multicultural keepin' it REAL for reducing substance use across grade levels and ethnic/racial groups, which highlights the importance of grounding substance use prevention programs in their audiences' cultural attitudes, values, norms, and beliefs.&lt;ref name= "hecht3"/&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid21128119&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marsiglia|first=Flavio|author2=Kulis, Stephen |author3=Yabiku, Scott |author4=Nieri, Tanya |author5= Coleman, Elizabeth |title=When to intervene: Elementary school, middle school or both?

—Following the passing of [[Washington Initiative 502]] that legalized cannabis consumption in Washington state, the D.A.R.E program was changed in the state to remove cannabis messages from their year 5 curriculum, arguing "research has found that teaching children about drugs with which they have never heard of or have no real life understanding may stimulate their interest or curiosity about the substance."&lt;ref name="hitandrundec2012"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11921">[[File:EdiktPotsdam.jpg|thumb|right|Edict of Potsdam]]
The '''Edict of Potsdam''' ({{lang-de|Edikt von Potsdam}}) was a proclamation issued by [[Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg]] and [[Duke of Prussia]], in [[Potsdam]] on October 29, 1685, as a response to the revocation of the [[Edict of Nantes]] by the [[Edict of Fontainebleau (1685)|Edict of Fontainebleau]]. It encouraged Protestants to relocate to Brandenburg.

== Background ==
On 22 October 1685, [[King Louis XIV of France]] issued the Edict of Fontainebleau, which was part of a program of persecution that closed [[Huguenot]] churches and schools.  This policy escalated the harassment of religious minorities since the ''[[dragonnade]]s'' created in 1681 in order to intimidate Huguenots into [[religious conversion|converting]] to Catholicism.  As a result, a large number of [[Protestants]]&amp;nbsp;— estimates range from 210,000 to 900,000&amp;nbsp;— left France over the next two decades.

Across the Rhine it has been estimated that the [[Holy Roman empire]] had lost a third of its population through slaughter, famine and plague during the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618-1648).&lt;ref name=PosdamlautSW/&gt;   The western part of [[Brandenburg-Prussia]] fell within the empire: badly depopulated, the territory faced a desperate labour shortage during the second half of the seventeenth century.

Two hundred years he wrote a lengthy and resounding&lt;br&gt; '''"Prologue to the two hundredth anniversary celebration of the French colony"''':

{{center|&lt;poem&gt;
A shelter found, freedom of [religious] belief,
And refuge from oppression of the conscience.
A courageous prince, free and devout,
Received us here, as he prince of the country
Received us as his own people.   No envy was awakened,
No jealousy, - People opened their doors
And welcomed us as Brothers in Christ......

''Ein Obdach fanden, Freistatt für den Glauben,
''Und Zuflucht vor Bedrängnis der Gewissen.
''Ein hochmuther Fürst, so frei wie fromm,
''Empfing uns hier, und wie der Fürst des Landes
''Empfing uns auch sein Volk. Kein Neid ward wach,
''Nicht Eifersucht, - man öffnete die Thür
''Und hieß als Glaubensbrüder uns willkommen......''
&lt;/poem&gt;}}
}}

Encouraged by the French theologian-philosopher [[Jakob Abbadie]], on 29 October 1685, [[Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg]] issued the Edict of Potsdam.

Large number of religious refugees had arrived by ship at [[Cadzand]] and other coastal ports in the Netherlands.&lt;ref name=PosdamlautSW/&gt;   The edict, which reflected a hands-on practical approach by the Prussian leadership, provided for Prussian diplomats in Amsterdam to arrange ships to transport these by sea to the [[Hamburg|Free City of Hamburg]] where Prussian representatives would be on hand to arrange transport up the [[Elbe]] to their chosen destinations in the Brandenburg-Prussia heartland.&lt;ref name=EoP&gt;{{cite web|title="Edict of Potsdam," issued by Frederick William ("the Great Elector") (October 29, 1685)| url=http://germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org/print_document.cfm?document_id=3636|accessdate=2 June 2016|work= Deutsche Geschichte in Quellen und Darstellung| author2=Rainer A. Müller (editor)|author1=[[Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg]] (sole signatory)|date=29 October 1685| publisher= Deutschen Historischen Instituts, Washington, DC}}&lt;/ref&gt;   For people fleeing from eastern and southern France provision was made for a land route via [[Sedan, Ardennes|Sedan]] and the [[Duchy of Cleves]], which had become a territory of Brandenburg-Prussia in 1666, and where [[Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg|the Great Elector]] (as the Prussian ruler is identified in English language history books) had arranged for them to be settled locally or transported on via the [[Rhine]] to new homes further east.&lt;ref name=EoP/&gt;   In its third section the edict spelled out a succession of suggested places where the migrants might wish to live, and went on to promise "free choice [as to] their place of settlement... wherever they find it most convenient to practice their professions and trades".&lt;ref name=EoP/&gt;

The edict expressly ruled out any customs duties or other taxes on assets that the migrants had been able to bring with them.&lt;ref name=EoP/&gt;    Migrants would be accommodated in abandoned and dilapidated properties which their owners had lacked the means to make habitable.&lt;ref name=EoP/&gt;    They would receive their properties free of mortgages or other debts or obligations, and they would be provided at no cost to themselves with the necessary timber and other building materials.  Any former proprietors would be compensated for the transfer value of properties allocated to the migrants, and the new settlers would enjoy a six-year tax holiday in respect of any property taxes (though they would remain subject to the same taxes on consumption as other citizens).&lt;ref name=EoP/&gt;

In some of the many places where tracts of abandoned cultivable land had been identified, the elector's edict provided for the perpetual freehold of these to be allocated to his "French Protestant Comrades in Belief" (''"Evangelisch-Reformirten Glaubens-Genossen"''), free of mortgages or other encumbrances.   Materials would be provided for refugee farmers to bring their land into cultivation and construct homes.   A ten-year tax holiday was included in the package.  The edict also recorded that in affected localities officials had been mandated to hire town houses where Huguenot refugees might be received and accommodated with their families rent free for up to four years while arrangements for them to create their own farms were put in place, although this generous provision was expressly conditional on beneficiaries subsequently bringing their farms into production.&lt;ref name=EoP/&gt;

It was spelled out that as soon as a French Protestant migrant family had settled in a town or village they should enjoy full legal and civic equality with the elector's existing subjects.   Significantly, they would not be subjected to any discriminatory so-called [[aubaine|"Droit d’Aubaine"]] or other burden with which foreign immigrants in other kingdoms, states and republics would be encumbered.&lt;ref name=EoP/&gt;   Migrants were to be permitted to hold [[service of worship|church services]] in their native [[French language]]&lt;ref&gt;{{note|stoye}} John Stoye&amp;nbsp;— ''Europe Unfolding 1648-1688'' p.272&lt;/ref&gt; and to set up their own schools.&lt;ref name=PosdamlautSW/&gt;

The elector moved fast.  On 9 November 1685 translations of the Edict were printed in German, French and Dutch.&lt;ref name=PosdamlautSW/&gt;   These were quickly distributed to the affected areas in France using secret couriers and local Protestant networks.&lt;ref name=PosdamlautSW/&gt;

== Results ==
It is estimated that approximately 20,000 Huguenot refugees relocated to [[Brandenburg-Prussia]] in response to the Edict of Potsdam.&lt;ref name=PosdamlautSW&gt;{{cite journal|author=Susanne Weingarten|title=Zwei Pferde, eine Kuh und 50 Taler:  Als Flüchtlinge gekommen, bleiben die Hugenotten in Preußen über Generationen eine stolze Minderheit.| pages=102–103| publisher=[[Der Spiegel]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ht04DQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT145|work=Das Reich der Deuschen 962-1871: Eine Nation entsteht|date=June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;    The contrast between the generosity of the Prussian ruler's Edict of Potsdam and the vindictiveness of the [[Louis XIV|self-styled "Sun king's"]] [[Edict of Fontainebleau]] was conscious and widely remarked.&lt;ref name=PosdamlautSW/&gt;   The embryonic state became a center of European immigration, its religious freedom attracting not only French Protestants but also the persecuted of [[Russia]], the [[Netherlands]], and [[Bohemia]].  Thus, the immigrants to the [[Electorate of Brandenburg]] stabilized and greatly improved the country's economy following the destructive [[List of wars 1500–1799|wars]] that had swept through [[Europe]] in the seventeenth-century.

The Edict of Potsdam was not a product of mere altruism or publicity-seeking on the part of an ambitious German prince.   A large immigrant community personally linked to the ruler by their religious beliefs also strengthened the ruler's own position in relation to the landed nobility and the powerful Lutheran interests.&lt;ref name=GtEllautBD&gt;{{cite book| page=86| url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zxHg40ffVhAC&amp;pg=PA86&amp;lpg=PA86&amp;|title=Der Grosse Kurfürst als Schirmherr: Brandenburg-Preußen|work=Die Hugenotten| author=Barbara Dölemeyer|publisher=Kohlhammer Urban Taschenbücher, Stuttgart| date=2006| isbn=978-3-17-018841-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a north German state with only limited access to natural resources, there was also a compelling economic case to be made for returning to productive usage land which had been abandoned since the Thirty Years' War.&lt;ref name=PosdamlautSW/&gt;

A particularly well documented case is that of the farmer Jean Harlan, based in [[Calais]] and barely 20 years old when the Edict of Fontainbleau was proclaimed in 1685.   With others, he escaped in a boat along the [[English Channel]], surviving as far as [[Cadzand]] on the Dutch coast.   In one of the several "transit" points set up by Prussian officials in the Netherlands, he was provided with financial support and documentation, before moving on to [[Uckermark]], close to the [[Oder|Oder River]].   Here he met and in February 1689 married Marie Le Jeune, another Huguenot refugee who had managed to escape from France with her three children.   In Uckermark they were allocated an empty farmstead, together with building material, seed corn, two horses, a cow, and 50 [[Thaler]]s.   Uckermark was a particular focus of Huguenot resettlement.   The farmstead was one of 2,900 available for settlement in the area, where the package including "two horses, a cow, and 50 [[Thaler]]s" was apparently the standard one.  The Harlans were able to benefit from the grants and tax privileges provided by the Edict of Potsdam, and Jean Harlan later went on to build a business as a tobacco merchant.   His son, Jakob Harlan, subsequently founded a commercial dynasty of upwardly mobile business people.&lt;ref name=PosdamlautSW/&gt;

==Career==
===FK Partizan===
On October 25 of 2010, Fahad obtained permission from the [[Kazma Sporting Club|Kazma]] board for a week-long vacation to travel to [[Saudi Arabia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=العنزي يخضع للتجربة في صربيا |url=http://www.aljarida.com/aljarida/Article.aspx?id=181571 |work=Al Jarida |date=25 October 2010 |accessdate=28 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101106071928/http://aljarida.com/aljarida/Article.aspx?id=181571 |archivedate=6 November 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Fahad did not travel to [[Saudi Arabia]]; he traveled to [[Serbia]] to get a trial with [[FK Partizan]] for a week so that they may sign him in the January transfer window.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Alenazi na probi u Partizanu|url=http://www.novosti.rs/vesti/sport.72.html:305885-Alenazi-na-probi-u-Partizanu|work=[[Večernje novosti]]|date=31 October 2010 |accessdate=31 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Reprezentativac Kuvajta u Humskoj (VIDEO) |url=http://www.sportal.rs/news.php?id=38507 |work=sportal.rs |date=31 October 2010 |accessdate=31 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101102170320/http://sportal.rs/news.php?id=38507 |archivedate=2 November 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He played one game for Partizan B team in the Serbian Reserves First League,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.b92.net/sport/fudbal/vesti.php?yyyy=2010&amp;mm=11&amp;dd=05&amp;nav_id=470319 Partizan “B” savladao BASK] at [[B92]], 5-11-2010, retrieved 30-11-2014 {{sr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Fahad returned to Kuwait.

===Itthiad FC===
In the 2011 season Fahad joined Ittihad FC on loan from Kazma.His spell at Ittihad FC was short and without success due to injuries and financial problems with the club.

==Style of play==
Al Enezi is a pacy customer who tends to cause problems for defending opposition on the left wing with his combination of skill, determination  and sheer speed. He is renowned for his trait of running box-to-box and the ability to slot-in dangerous shots and crosses from outside the thirty-yard box. In light of his developing career, Al Enezi has come to be recognised, questionably, as the 'fastest player in Kuwait football'.

The '''''Gazette officielle du Québec''''' is an official publication of the [[Government of Quebec|Quebec government]]. It is used to promulgate new [[law]]s and [[regulation]]s, which thereby become official. It was founded on January 16, 1869.

An earlier ''Gazette de Québec'' was an unofficial publication created in 1764, and was replaced by ''Gazette officielle du Québec'' in 1823. Archived versions of the ''Gazette'' from 1869 to 1995 are available. An annual subscription to the Gazette costs $1185 ($500 and $685, for part 1 and 2, respectively) per year, for both parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.publicationsduquebec.gouv.qc.ca/gazetteofficielle/abonnement.fr.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; One copy costs $10.71.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.publicationsduquebec.gouv.qc.ca/gazetteofficielle/abonnement.fr.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lieutenant-Colonel]] '''George Johnston''' (19 March 1764 – 5 January 1823) was briefly Lieutenant-Governor of [[New South Wales]], Australia after leading the rebellion later known as the [[Rum Rebellion]]. After serving as a young [[Royal Marines|marine]] officer in the [[American Revolutionary War]], Johnston served in the East Indies, fighting against the French, before volunteering to accompany the [[First Fleet]] to New South Wales. After serving as [[adjutant]] to Governor [[Arthur Phillip]], Johnston served in the [[New South Wales Corps]] and he was later a key figure in putting down the [[Castle Hill convict rebellion]] in 1804 and then the [[Rum Rebellion]] in 1808, the latter of which led to his court martial and subsequent cashiering from military service. In his later life, he returned to New South Wales as a private citizen, raising a family in the colony and establishing a successful farm around Annandale in Sydney.

==Early life and military career==
Johnston was born on 19 January 1764 at [[Annan, Dumfries and Galloway|Annan]], [[Dumfriesshire]], [[Scotland]], the son of Captain George Johnston, [[aide-de-camp]] to Lord Percy, later the [[George Percy, 5th Duke of Northumberland|5th Duke of Northumberland]]. Percy obtained a commission for the 12-year-old Johnston as [[second lieutenant]] of [[Royal Marines|marines]] on 6 March 1776.&lt;ref name=ADB&gt;Yarwood 1967, pp. 20–22.&lt;/ref&gt; Johnston went to America with his regiment, and took part in the [[Battle of Bunker Hill]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]], where he distinguished himself by seizing the colours and carrying them into action after the standard-bearer had been mortally wounded. During the fight, his father received a chest wound, from which he subsequently died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.navyhistory.org.au/family-saga-the-westons-the-johnstons-1764-onwards/ |title= Family Saga: The Westons &amp; The Johnstons – 1764 Onwards |author=Weston, Bert E. |publisher=Naval Historical Society of Australia |accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Duke of Northumberland, who had held Johnston's father in high regard, became Johnston's guardian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionaryofsydney.org/entry/stanmore |title=Stanmore |author=Meader, Chrys  |year= 2008 |work=Dictionary of Sydney |accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The young officer subsequently acted as a recruiting officer in the United Kingdom before served aboard {{HMS|Sultan|1775|6}} in the East Indies in 1781, and suffering a severe wound in action against the French.&lt;ref name=Binney&gt;Binney 2005, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Moore&gt;Moore 1987, pp. 296–297.&lt;/ref&gt; Returned to garrison duty in [[Portsmouth]], he volunteered to join the [[New South Wales Marine Corps]], which would accompany the [[First Fleet]] to [[New South Wales]]. He sailed for Australia aboard the convict transport ''[[Lady Penrhyn (1786 ship)|Lady Penrhyn]]'' in 1788.&lt;ref name ="Binney"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Moore/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article71501471 |title=Annandale House—An Historic Residence, Now Being Demolished. |newspaper=[[Australian Town and Country Journal]] |date=19 April 1905 |accessdate=1 May 2012 |page=20 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New South Wales==
On arrival in New South Wales, Johnston served as adjutant to Governor [[Arthur Phillip]], and was promoted in 1789 to the rank of [[Captain-Lieutenant]] of Marines. He transferred from the New South Wales Marine Corps to the locally raised [[New South Wales Corps]] in 1791 with the rank of captain.&lt;ref name="Binney"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Moore/&gt;&lt;ref name=dab&gt;Serle 1949.&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnston received extensive land grants in areas of modern [[Petersham, New South Wales|Petersham]], [[Bankstown, New South Wales|Bankstown]] and [[Cabramatta, New South Wales|Cabramatta]]. Johnston's other grants included land which is now the suburb of [[Annandale, New South Wales|Annandale]], named for his property that was in turn named after the place of his birth. He and [[Esther Abrahams]] farmed and lived on Annandale with their children.&lt;ref name=Silver/&gt;

In September 1796, Johnston was appointed aide-de-camp to [[John Hunter (New South Wales)|Governor John Hunter]], and in 1800 received his brevet rank as major. In the same year Johnston was put under arrest by [[William Paterson (explorer)|Lieutenant Governor William Paterson]] on charges of "paying spirits to a sergeant as part of his pay—and disobedience of orders". Johnston objected to trial by court-martial in the colony, and Hunter sent him to England. There the difficulties of conducting a trial with witnesses in Australia led to the proceedings being dropped, and Johnston returned to New South Wales in 1802. In 1803 Johnston took temporary command of the New South Wales Corps during the illness of Paterson, and became involved in the conflict between [[Philip Gidley King|King]] and the military. In March 1804 he acted with decision when in command of the military sent against some [[Castle Hill convict rebellion|convicts who had rebelled at Castle Hill]]. When Paterson was sent to [[Launceston, Tasmania|Port Dalrymple]], Johnston became commander of the New South Wales Corps.&lt;ref name=dab/&gt;

On 26 January 1808, Johnston played a key role in the only successful armed takeover of a government in Australia's recorded history, the [[Rum Rebellion]], working closely with [[John Macarthur (wool pioneer)|John Macarthur]].  Johnston led the troops that deposed [[William Bligh|Governor William Bligh]], assumed the title of lieutenant-governor, and illegally suspended the judge-advocate and other officials. The administration of justice became farcical, and there were signs of strong discontent among the settlers.&lt;ref name=dab/&gt;

Johnston was promoted to the rank of lieutenant-colonel on 25 April 1808, and was superseded by his senior officer [[Joseph Foveaux]], who was Lieutenant-Governor of [[Norfolk Island]], on 28 July. Johnston sailed for England with [[John Macarthur (wool pioneer)|John Macarthur]] in March 1809 (and [[Henry Fulton]] as a witness) and was tried by [[court-martial]] in May 1811. Found guilty of mutiny he was sentenced to be [[Cashiering|cashiered]]. This lenience of the sentence imposed in the circumstances presumably indicates that the court was convinced that he had been the tool of other people.&lt;ref name=dab/&gt;

==Later life==
[[File:Johnstons Creek.JPG|thumb|right|Johnstons Creek pedestrian bridge]]
Johnston returned to New South Wales in May 1813 as a private individual and in November the following year he married Esther Abrahams at St John's Church in Parramatta. The couple had already had seven children together by that time and they lived on his land at [[Annandale Farm]], [[Sydney]].&lt;ref name=Silver&gt;Silver 1989, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Da Cruz 2015, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; He died much respected on 5 January 1823, leaving a large family. He was first interred in a private mausoleum on his Annandale property, until its subdivision to become an inner city suburb. His remains were moved to a new mausoleum at [[Waverley Cemetery]] in 1904.&lt;ref name=dab/&gt;

The suburb of [[Georges Hall, New South Wales|Georges Hall]] is named after the farmhouse of the same name on land grants Johnston received near the junction of the [[Georges River]] and [[Prospect Creek (New South Wales)|Prospect Creek]]. This building still exists and is now one of Australia's oldest houses. Johnston and [[Esther Abrahams]] farmed and lived on Annandale with their children until the 1870s when it was sold and sub-divided for residential development. The main street of Annandale is named Johnston and the gates of their property now stand in the grounds of Annandale Public School.&lt;ref name=dab/&gt;

The '''George Sweeney Trial''' in 1806 in [[Richmond, Virginia]] was a trial in which George Sweeney, the grand-nephew of [[George Wythe]], one of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|founding fathers of the United States]], was acquitted of murdering Wythe. Wythe was a distinguished attorney who attended the [[Philadelphia Convention]] in 1775 and signed the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] in 1776; in 1806, he died of [[arsenic poisoning]]. Before he died, Wythe accused his nephew of murder and changed his will to exclude him.  Wythe's [[black people|black]] housekeeper provided [[evidence (law)|evidence]] that George Sweeney had tried to poison Wythe, her son and her, but by law was prohibited from [[testimony|testifying]] in a [[criminal case]] against a [[White people|white]] man.  Sweeney was tried and found [[Acquittal|not guilty]]. The case is used as an example of how [[racism]] in early American law resulted in an [[acquittal]].&lt;ref name="gtrials"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Circumstances==
Although George Wythe was 80 years old, he was healthy and vigorous. Since his only child had died as an infant decades before, Wythe in 1803 or earlier wrote a will leaving a large amount to George Sweeney, his sister's grandson named after him.&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt;  When Sweeney, a 17-year-old [[alcoholic|drinker]] and [[gambler]], came to live with Wythe in 1805, he began stealing Wythe's books for sale and [[forgery|forging]] Wythe's name on personal bank account [[Cheque|check]]s to help pay his [[debt]]s. Wythe had also made settlements for former slaves Lydia Broadnax, whom he had freed in 1787, and her 16-year-old son Michael Brown, as well as Benjamin, an adult man whom he freed in 1797. Sweeney would share his inheritance with them.

Since Sweeney feared that Wythe would discover the forgeries, and knew that he was a [[beneficiary]] of Wythe's [[Estate (law)|estate]], evidence suggests that he decided to [[murder]] his uncle and/or the other heirs. A shopkeeper later attested that he sold Sweeney [[arsenic]], and Broadnax said she saw him put something in the coffeepot in the kitchen from which Wythe, Broadnax and Brown drank that Sunday morning, May 25. Brown and Wythe died slow and agonizing deaths over several days: Brown on June 1 and Wythe a week later on June 8, 1806. Broadnax survived.&lt;ref name="gtrials"&gt;{{cite book

==Trial==
On June 18, Sweeney was arrested and charged with [[murder]].  The trial began on September 2. the Convincing [[testimony]] pointing to Sweeney as the [[culprit]] was provided by Broadnax, who had been Wythe's [[Cook (domestic worker)|cook]] for many years. She had [[witness]]ed Sweeney's suspicious behaviors around the coffee pot, which suggested that he had placed a substance in the coffee on May 25, while she was in the kitchen with him. Broadnax had drunk a small amount of the coffee and become ill. When Wythe and Brown also became ill from drinking the coffee, she testified that she suspected that Sweeney had put something in it.&lt;ref name="jrank"&gt;{{cite web

The two judges did not allow Broadnax's [[testimony]] into [[evidence (law)|evidence]] nor that of the other black servants who had seen Sweeney's suspicious behaviors.&lt;ref name="gtrials"/&gt; They adhered to the law at that time, which did not allow  blacks to testify against a white person in a criminal trial: "It was gleaned from negroes, which is not permitted by our laws to go against a white man."&lt;ref name="jrank"/&gt;

[[Hearsay in United States law|Hearsay evidence]] was introduced by the [[white people|white]]s who testified that Sweeney had bought arsenic. The jail warden testified that Sweeney had not been searched upon [[arrest]], and that later a packet with arsenic was found in the [[Jail#United_States|jail]] yard, where it could have been thrown from a jail window. Another person testified that Wythe on his death bed, asked him to search Sweeney's room, where he found a container of arsenic. Wythe changed his [[Will (law)|will]] on June 1, to [[disinherit]] Sweeney. Because hearsay evidence was excluded by law, the [[jury]]'s [[verdict]] on September 8 was [[Acquittal|not guilty]].&lt;ref name="gtrials"/&gt;

The '''Highways Act 1555''' (2 &amp; 3 Ph. &amp; Mary, c. 8&lt;ref&gt;See [[Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom#Historical records]]&lt;/ref&gt;), sometimes the '''First Statute of Highways''', was an [[Act of Parliament]] of the [[Parliament of England]] passed in 1555 (and extended by the [[Highways Act 1562]]). It placed the burden of upkeep of the [[highway]]s on individual [[parishes] mp3 also 5

==Clauses==
The Act enacted that each year, in the [[Easter]] week, every parish was to elect "two honest persons" of the parish to serve as the [[Surveyor of Highways]], who would be responsible for the upkeep of those highways within the parish boundaries which ran to [[market town]]s.

The Surveyors would announce, on the first Sunday after Easter, four days before 24 June&lt;ref&gt;The feast-day of the nativity of [[John the Baptist]]&lt;/ref&gt; on which the maintenance work was to be carried out, and for these four days the whole parish was to work on the highways.

Every person, for every ploughland&lt;ref&gt;An area broadly comparable to a [[hide (unit)|hide]]&lt;/ref&gt; they held in the parish, and every other person keeping a draught&lt;ref&gt;A plough-team&lt;/ref&gt; or plough there, was to provide a cart or wain equipped for the work, and two able-bodied men, on a penalty of 10''s'' per draught; the Surveyors could, at their discretion, require a further two men instead of the cart. Every other householder, as well as every other cottager and labourer free to labour,&lt;ref&gt;In other words, those not hired servants&lt;/ref&gt; was to send themselves or a substitute able-bodied labourer to work for the four days, on a penalty of 12''d'' per day apiece. All labourers were to provide their own equipment, and bound to work for eight hours each day upon the roads.

The Act was originally in force for seven years, but its provisions were extended to run for another twenty years by the [[Highways Act 1562]].

It was repealed by section 57 of the Act 7 Geo.3 c.42.

The '''Highways Act 1562''' (5 Eliz.1 c.13), sometimes the '''Second Statute of Highways''', was an [[Act of Parliament]] of the [[Parliament of England]] passed in 1563. The Act extended the provisions of the [[Highways Act 1555]], by which every householder of a parish had to provide four days labour in a year on the highways, for a further twenty years, and made the requirement six days labour rather than four. Supervisors of highway work were empowered to take debris from quarries and dig for gravel without permission of the landowners. The Act also empowered [[Justices of the Peace]] at [[Quarter Sessions]] to investigate and punish supervisors in cases where they were in dereliction of their duties, imposing "such fines ...  as shall be thought meet".

It was repealed by section 57 of the Act 7 Geo.3 c.42.

The '''''Institutes of the Lawes of England''''' are a series of legal treatises written by Sir [[Edward Coke]]. They were first published, in stages, between 1628 and 1644.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Paul Axel-Lute|title=Finding English Statutes &amp; Cases &amp; Selected "Books of Authority" at the Rutgers–Newark Law Library|url=http://law-library.rutgers.edu/resources/english-statutes-and-cases.php#books|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130507082337/http://law-library.rutgers.edu/resources/english-statutes-and-cases.php|archivedate=7 May 2013|publisher=[[Rutgers University|Rutgers Law Library – Newark]]|date=4 January 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Widely recognized as a foundational document of the [[common law]], they have been cited in over 70 cases decided by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]],&lt;ref&gt;[[LexisNexis]] search performed 1 May 2008. See also ''Impression Prods., Inc. v. Lexmark Int’l, Inc.'', 581 U.S. _, 137 S. Ct. 1523, 1532 (2017); ''Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.'', 568 U.S. 519, 538 (2013).&lt;/ref&gt; including several [[landmark case]]s. For example, in ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' (1973),&lt;ref&gt;''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', {{ussc|410|113|pin=134|1973}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Coke's ''Institutes'' are cited as evidence that under old English common law, an [[abortion]] performed before [[quickening]] was not an [[indictable offence]]. In the much earlier case of ''[[United States v. E. C. Knight Co.]]'' (1895),&lt;ref&gt;''[[United States v. E. C. Knight Co.]]'', {{ussc|156|1|pin=10|1895}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Coke's ''Institutes'' are quoted at some length for their definition of [[monopoly|monopolies]].&lt;ref&gt;See also [https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/243/490/case.html ''Straus v. Victor Talking Machine Co.''], 243 U.S. 490, 501 (1917), in which the Supreme Court referred to the respondent’s restrictive practices (in violation of the principle of Coke”s Institutes, section 360, as ones that "have been hateful to the law from Lord Coke's day to ours."&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Institutes's'' various reprinted editions well into the 19th century is a clear indication of the long lasting value placed on this work throughout especially the 18th century in Britain and Europe. It has also been associated through the years with high literary connections. For example, [[David Hume]] in 1764 requested it from the bookseller [[Andrew Millar]] in a cheap format for a French friend.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.millar-project.ed.ac.uk/manuscripts/html_output/3.html|title=The manuscripts, Letter from Andrew Millar to David Hume, 24 April, 1764.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29122">The '''National Committee for Investigation of the Truth about the Jeju 4.3 Events''' (4.3 Committee) was a [[Truth and reconciliation commission|truth commission]] in [[South Korea]] established in 2000. The commission aimed to investigate the [[Jeju Uprising|Jeju 4.3 events]], which refers to a "series of armed uprisings and counterinsurgency that occurred between 1948 and 1954 on [[Jeju island]], the largest island in the southernmost part of South Korea."&lt;ref name="Kim"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Kim | first = Hunjoon | title = Seeking truth after 50 years: The National Committee for Investigation of the Truth about the Jeju 4.3 events | journal = [[International Journal of Transitional Justice]] | volume = 3 | issue = 3 | pages = 406–423 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press|Oxford Journals]] | doi = 10.1093/ijtj/ijp014 | date = November 2009 | url = https://doi.org/10.1093/ijtj/ijp014 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Announcing 14,028 victims, the first report of the commission was published in 2003, following an official apology by President [[Roh Moo-hyun]], and his participation in a memorial service held in commemoration of the events, in 2006. However the commission continued to be in operation through 2009, carrying out various reparation projects as well as the screening of victims, thus making it the lengthiest truth commission in history.

==Background==

===Events===
[[File:US and Jeju.png|thumbnail|US Military Advisor Captain Lerch and a military officer discuss Anti-Guerrilla Operations (May 15th, 1948)]]
Within the context of the early [[Cold War]] era, the events under investigation occurred on April 3, 1948, when the leadership of the [[Communist Party of Korea|South Korean Communist Party]] Jeju Committee led an armed uprising against the South Korean Interim Government (SKIG). As such, over 350 [[Leftist]] [[Guerrilla warfare|Guerrillas]] attacked various police stations on Jeju Island, in addition to killing many prominent right-wing political figures. In an effort to stabilize the situation, the South Korean government sent over 100 reinforcement forces. However, upon realization that the number of police officers sent was insufficient to control the guerrillas, "The government then mobilized the members of anti-communist paramilitary groups who were deeply involved in Korean politics, using violence in favour of the right-wing leaders and the US military government."&lt;ref name="Kim"/&gt; Failing to control the guerrilla armed resistance, enforcement responsibilities were transferred to the South Korean military. Resulting from this, civilians not involved in the conflict were abused and murdered by perpetrators including: armed guerrillas, police, military and [[Paramilitary groups]].

===Debates over events===
Since the South Korean transition to a [[democratic government]] in 1987, studies debating the causes and consequences of the Jeju 4.3 events have emerged which challenge the official narratives of the event. Specifically, three major debates challenging the official narratives include the characteristics of the armed uprising, the start-date of the incident, and circumstances surrounding responsibility of civilian massacres.
	
Before South Korean democratization in 1987, the characteristics of the armed uprising on April 3, 1948 were mostly referred to and understood as communist rebellions in all public records, including mass media, textbooks, and government documents. As proposed by Kim, "by defining the key event as a communist rebellion, civilian massacres and human rights abuses were easily justified as collateral to, and a necessary part of, the efforts to prevent communization."&lt;ref name="Kim"/&gt; Alternative perspectives to explain the armed uprising in Jeju include '[[Democratic movement]]', or '[[Popular uprising]]'. This proposed perspective dismantled the [[Communism]] rebellion argument led by the SKIG, by explaining that, "The armed uprising was both widely supported by the general public and an inevitable response to the oppression and misrule of the US military government and the incompetence of the Korean government."&lt;ref name="Kim"/&gt;

Further, the start date of the Jeju 4.3 Incident has been debated. Prior to 1987, the view was that the Incident started on April 3, 1948, when the guerrilla communists led an armed uprising. However, upon democratization in 1987, a revisionist view emerged, arguing that events began on 1 March 1947, when dissatisfaction with the US military government resulted in a demonstration and the local police, under the control of the US military, opened fire, severely injuring no less than ten individuals. Consequently, the [[Historical revisionism|Revisionist]] perspective would argue, "the armed uprising on 3 April 1948 was one of several instances of public resistance to the US military government, which originally commenced on 1 March 1947."&lt;ref name="Kim"/&gt;
	
The third debate over the events of the Jeju 4.3 Incident challenged the official narrative of the responsibility for civilian massacres. The traditional narrative is that the communist guerrillas were mainly responsible for the massacres and human rights violations. Contrasting this argument and relating to the challenges made in the second debate, "since the armed protest was actually a response to oppression and misrule, it is the US military government and nascent Korean government that are in fact responsible for the massacres and abuses."&lt;ref name="Kim"/&gt;

==Stages of Advocacy for Transitional Justice==

===Stage 1 (1954-1987)===

Following the Jeju 4.3 events, the truth of their occurrence remained suppressed for over 25 years under dictatorial regimes. The first breakthrough was in 1978, when a South Korean writer named Hyun Ki-Young, published his novel titled ''Aunt Suni''. The novel described a fictional character who returns to Jeju island for his grandfather’s memorial service. Upon his arrival the main character learns of the atrocities perpetrated by the South Korean military and the police during the 4.3 events. Hyun Ki-Young’s novel significantly impacted social activists giving rise to underground student movements. As described by Kim, “the time between 1978 and 1987 became a period of preparation.”&lt;ref name="Kim"/&gt; During this time scholars and underground activists secretly attempted to rediscover the truth through repressed accounts and memories of the 4.3 events and massacres, holding memorial services and frequent discussion of the events.

===Stage 2 (1987-1992)===

Upon democratization in South Korea, public and mass movements devised to uncover the truth about the Jeju 4.3 events emerged at the local level. At this time there were three advocacy activities including: media coverage, memorial services, and research. In terms of media coverage, local newspapers such as the Jemin-Ilbo played a significant role in uncovering evidence of massacres and taking testimonies which would be shared publicly. Further, social movement groups organized the first memorial service in 1989 for the Jeju 4.3 events. The memorial services were followed by a month-long festival that featured traditional plays, testimony hearings, films, concerts, and art as public communication tools concerning the Jeju events. As described by Kim, “it provided an arena where activists could discuss the 4.3 events and share information, expertise and strategies.”.&lt;ref name="Kim"/&gt; Research also contributed to advocacy efforts through the establishment of the 4.3 Research Institute. The objective of this organization was to find evidence of the massacres and disperse information. Resulting from this was an excavation of the Darangshi cave on Jeju island in 1992. Here the researchers discovered skeletal remains of corpses, proving to be a significant advancement in the transitional justice process.

===Stage 3 (1993-1997)===

During this time the [[Kim Young-sam]] administration decentralized state power by instituting local government and elected council systems. Within this political context, the Provincial 4.3 Committee was created under the Jeju Provincial Council. The Provincial Committee’s action plan was to investigate the truth behind the 4.3 events. In doing so they created the Office for 4.3 Victim Registration. Consequently, 17 investigators were tasked with conducting interviews and gathering evidence. After a year long investigation, in 1995 the Provincial Committee published a final report listing 14, 504 victims of the Jeju events.

===Stage 4 (1998-2000)===

By 1998, activists, victims, and politicians involved in the uncovering of the truth of the 4.3 events directed their energy into two organizations that would then combine the efforts of all the individuals involved. These included The Pan National Committee for the Jeju 4.3 Events, created in Seoul, and the Provincial Solidarity for the Jeju 4.3, created in Jeju. However, after a year of disappointing results, by 1999 activists began to look at advocating for the enactment of a binding special law that would legally guarantee the establishment of a truth commission for the Jeju Incident. Consequently, the local council members of Jeju along with 90 activists and victims were the thrust behind a national campaign, making several appearances before the National Assembly in South Korea, as well as organizing weekly rallies. However, despite these activities, there were no tangible advancements due to the hesitation of leaders. In response, a Congresswoman from the ruling party, [[Choo Mi-ae]], according to Kim, “played a significant role in bringing the 4.3 events into the forefront of national politics and urging the ruling party to fulfill its commitment.”&lt;ref name="Kim"/&gt; Evidently, Choo released an official document containing a 200-page list of 1,650 persons who were court-martialed during the Jeju 4.3 events. The document showed detailed information of the military trials that took place; showing that detainees were executed within a month after initial trials, and some were executed after one day. Consequently, Kim describes that, “It provided undeniable evidence of the execution without due process of a large number of people in a short period of time, and made it possible for the concerned lawmakers to proceed without much resistance”&lt;ref name="Kim"/&gt;

==Establishment of the Committee==
[[File:President Kim Dae-jung signs the Jeju 4.3 Special Law.png|thumbnail|President Kim Dae-jung signs the Jeju 4.3 Special Law (January 11th, 2000)]]
Following the release of the official document by Choo Mi-ae, three congressmen from the opposition [[Liberty Korea Party|Grand National Party]] from Jeju island proposed a draft of a bill that included the establishment of an independent committee regarding the Jeju 4.3 events, under the Office of the Prime Minister. The bill marked the first redefinition of the events as something other than a communist rebellion.&lt;ref name="Kim"/&gt; The bill would define the 4.3 events as a disturbance that occurred from the 3rd of April 1948 in Jeju Island. Further it would refuse any transitional justice measures beyond the investigation. The definition in particular was criticized by activists and victims who demanded a definition that went beyond a disturbance thus acknowledging the 4.3 events as mass human rights violations perpetrated by the state. As such, within a month, activists and victims proposed their own version of the bill defining it as, “Events which occurred in Jeju Island from 1 March 1947 to 27 July 1953 when civilians were abused without good cause during the armed conflicts and governmental suppression by the police, military and paramilitary groups of the US military government and Korea government.”.&lt;ref name="Kim"/&gt; Consequently, two differing bills were put through the negotiation process; activists and victims pushed for definitions, while the Grand National Party pushed for no reparations. For the activists and victims, the reparations were a secondary issue relative to defining the 4.3 events, because the redefinition would serve their primary focus which was to honour the victims and their families. Thus as Kim puts it, “For activists and victims, the compromise was a strategic and provisional concession in order to enact a special law.”&lt;ref name="Kim"/&gt; A compromise was reached through a bipartisan bill, that consisted of the redefinition of the 4.3 events in accordance with the activists and victims, and an article on a financial and medical subsidy without reparation for the victims. The only additional transitional measures that could be guaranteed under the law beyond the establishment of the truth commission were commemoration projects (a memorial park, museum, and cemetery). The bill was passed on the 16th of December, 1999, preceding the 4.3 Special Act, and nine months later, the 4.3 Committee.

===Organization of the committee===
According to the Jeju 4.3 Special Law, "The highest decision-making body is the Special or National Committee for Investigation of the Jeju 4.3 Incident and Restoring the Honor of the Victims."&lt;ref name="report"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Jeju 4.3 Incident Investigation Report|url=http://www.jeju43peace.or.kr/report_eng.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Enforcement Regulation No.3 of the Special Law, the committee must be composed of no less than twenty members. These mandatory members included the prime minister, who is also the chairperson of the committee, the ministers of justice, of government registration, of budget and planning, the governor of Jeju, representatives of the victims' families who are designated by the prime minister, and relevant experts and people of learning and experience. Consequently, upon the establishment of the committee on August 8, 2000, the members of the committee included: the prime minister, seven additional government ministers, twelve civilians including representatives of the victim's families, as well as lawyers, heads of civic groups, scholars, and former army generals. Additionally Article No. 7 of the Special Law indicated that, "the task force for preparing the report can be organized separately in order to maintain objectivity and heighten efficiency."&lt;ref name="report"/&gt; As such, this task force according to the Enforcement Ordinance No. 12 of the Special Law must be composed of less than fifteen members. These members must include director-general level officials who are appointed by the prime minister, the vice-governor of Jeju, various representatives of the victims' families and relevant experts. Consequently, upon the establishment of the committee on January 17, 2000 the leader of the task force was lawyer Park Won-sun, with membership by five director-general level officials from various government offices including the vice-governor of Jeju, and ten civilians including representatives of the victims' families, scholars, lawyers and heads of civic groups. Further, within the task force, an investigation team was organized with five expert advisors and fifteen investigators, led by the team Chief Advisor Yang Jo-hun.

===Operation of the committee===
 
The investigation primarily focused on the "armed conflict, the suppression of it and the killing of innocent people during the process for seven years and seven months post the shooting incident by the police on March 1, 1947 to the lifting of the standstill order on [[Mt. Halla]] on September 21, 1954."&lt;ref name="report"/&gt; Further, the committee's policy outlined the task of investigating the background of the incident, including its development and the extent of damage incurred, while investigating the killing of innocent by-standers and human rights abuses more generally.
	
The duration of the investigation was two and a half years, from September 2000 until February 2003. The steps of the investigation included "making lists of the data and witnesses who are scheduled to give their testimony and selecting institutes and organizations from which the data will be collected, collecting the data and recording the testimonies, analyzing the data and the testimony, and making and examining the report."&lt;ref name="report"/&gt;

The task force, which held the responsibility to develop and publish the report, conducted 12 meetings and reviewed everything from the basic plans of the investigation to the content of the report. Further, the full-time investigation team collected data from organizations and institutes both domestically and abroad and recorded the testimony from witnesses on Jeju Island, in Seoul, Japan and the United States.

==Investigation activities==

===Emphasis===
The investigation team's objective was to place emphasis on discovering and revealing the truth with respect to the following issues:
# The 50-years history of investigation of the Jeju 4.3 Incident
# The definition of the incident
# The background and the cause of the incident
# The range of engagement and the roles of the South Korean Labor Party
# The organization and activities of the armed guerillas
# The range of intervention and role of the Seobuk Young Men's Association
# The number of deaths
# The statistical analysis of the assailants
# The damage done by the armed guerrillas
# The damage done by the punitive forces

===Methods===
The investigation committee searched for data from 19 domestic institutes and administrative bodies and nine foreign countries, collecting 10,594 cases. The committee used bibliographic surveys from domestic institutes as well as foreign countries, and recorded testimony to collect data.

====Bibliographic surveys====

=====Domestic data=====
In terms of domestic data, the bibliographic survey used 1,500 published and unpublished source materials pertaining to the Jeju 4.3 Incident. The committee preceded to target organizations and institutions related to the Incident. Once these were chosen, the task force team gave weight to securing the data from government bodies such as the records of the police and military operations, which were directly involved in the suppression of the incident, minutes of Cabinet meetings, and trial rulings. Additionally, the committee attempted to discover and secure data from current magazines and newspapers, the stenographic records of the National Assembly, the laws, regulations and administrative orders of the US army military government in Korea, personnel orders, individual memoirs and the records from the armed guerrillas. According to the Investigation report of the Jeju 4.3 Incident, "It is believed that the team made a successful attempt to collect and analyze the data. Yet the data from the military, the police, and the armed guerrillas were relatively insufficient. The team encountered difficulty due to the data discarded by the police."&lt;ref name="report"/&gt;

=====International data=====
In securing data the investigation team sent its staff to three countries including the [[United States]], [[Russia]], and [[Japan]], conducting surveys in each with the aid of resident experts. Among the three countries mentioned, emphasis was placed on the United States, with an in-depth data search conducted, given that the Incident occurred whilst the [[United States Army Military Government in Korea|United States Military Government]] was heavily involved. According to the investigation report, the first research was conducted from March 29 to April 27, 2001 and the second was carried out for 6 months from June 23 to December 1 of the same year. To search for the data, the survey team visited the [[National Archives and Records Administration]] (hereafter referred to as NARA), the [[MacArthur Memorial]] and the U.S. Army Military History Institute. "The NARA was so cooperative with the survey that it even provided the team with an exclusive work table. The survey team collected about 800 pieces of materials related directly or indirectly to the incident. The quantity of materials was enormous, reaching more than 10,000 pages of copies."&lt;ref name="report"/&gt; In the midst of the international investigation, the team referred to truth commission cases in foreign countries for guidance. Consequently, the investigation team successfully obtained research from truth commissions in Argentina, Taiwan, [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|South Africa]], and Spain.

====Recorded testimony====
503 witness testimonies were recorded over a period of 16 months from July 2001 to October 2002, using voice recorders and camcorders. The recordings were conducted in Jeju, [[Seoul]], as well as in countries including Japan and the United States. Witnesses were chosen from "the damage and casualty report of the Jeju Provincial Council, newspapers, broadcast programs and collections of testimony."&lt;ref name="report"/&gt; Further, the committee received recommended witnesses from various organizations; the committee also launched its own witness selection from ex-armed guerrillas and commanders of the suppression operations. Through this process, a list of 2,780 people was completed, out of which 500 people were screened into a final selection. Priority was given to witnesses with unusual backgrounds, those who underwent unique or specific incidents or came from a village that incurred severe damage, and those who were discovered by the committee's own investigation.

==Findings==

===Human rights abuses===
[[File:Inmates waiting inline to be interrogated (November, 1948).png|thumbnail|Inmates waiting inline to be interrogated (November, 1948)]]
The events that took place in the Jeju 4.3 Incident in the region of [[Mount Halla]] resulted in mass [[human rights]] violations. The South Korean government's [[counter-insurgency]] strategies led to [[guerrilla warfare]] until 1954. According to Kim, "The counterinsurgency strategy was extremely brutal; it included mass arrest and deterioration, forced relocation, torture, indiscriminate killing and the large-scale massacre of civilians."&lt;ref name="Kim"/&gt; Hundreds of villages were razed when residents were suspected of providing shelter and food to the leftist guerrillas, and many more villages in the Mount Halla region were systematically burned with residents forcibly relocated to the coast. More serious human rights abuses including mass killings and disappearances were evident in the earlier stages of the Incident, specifically between May 1948 and March 1949. According to the 2003 report of the 4.3 Committee, "15,100 victims have been identified, among which 10,729 (71%) were deceased, 3,920 (26%) missing, 207 (1.4%) injured and 244 (1.6%) imprisoned."&lt;ref name="Kim"/&gt; Further, the report also confirmed 448 victims of systematic civilian massacres, evidence of illegal detention, indiscriminate sweeping arrests, and summary executions. Consequently, "Many civilians were arrested and sentenced to death or to life imprisonment in makeshift martial courts. Torture was widely used to extract false confessions, which in turn were used to justify [[Summary execution]] and illegal detentions."&lt;ref name="Kim"/&gt; Finally, the report identified the suffering consequent to the guilt-by-association-system. This system entailed that, "Not only the direct family members of the convicted but also more distant relatives were inflicted with punishment or disadvantages."&lt;ref name="Kim"/&gt; The report highlighted cases in which some family members of the 4.3 Incident were subject to unfair treatment regarding employability, promotion, and travel opportunities.

==Recommendations to the Government==
Recommendations by the National Committee for Investigation of the Truth About the Jeju 4.3 Events (4.3 Committee) to the government of South Korea&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The National Committee for Investigation of the Truth about the Jeju April 3 Incident|website=jeju43.go.kr}}&lt;/ref&gt; include:
*To issue an apology to Jeju islanders, the victims and their families.
*To provide essential living expenses to bereaved families suffering from poverty.
*To utilize the final report as educational material.
*To declare the date of April 3 as a memorial day.
*To support excavations of mass graves and historical sites.
*To actively support the establishment of a Jeju April 3 Peace Memorial Park.
*To support further investigations and memorial affairs.

===Implementation of recommendations===
[[File:Jeju 4.3 Peace Park.jpg|thumbnail|Jeju 4.3 Peace Park]]
Immediately following the release of the Jeju 4.3 Investigation report in 2003, the President of South Korea, [[Roh Moo-hyun]], provided an apology to the victims of the incident and their families. This was significant in South Korean history because it marked the first apology by a [[head of state]] for human rights abuses perpetrated by the state. Further, South Korean history textbooks have changed the characterization of the events, providing a more neutral understanding of human rights violations. Additionally, victims and their families were compensated for the economic hardships suffered, as well as physical and mental illnesses that resulted from the incident. In direct accordance with the recommendations by the Jeju 4.3 committee, the Commission involved itself in three commemoration projects, and by 2007 the Jeju Foundation (a memorial park and museum) was created. The objectives of the Jeju Foundation were to, “promote peace and human rights by, first, maintaining the museum and memorial park, and second, by conducting additional investigations.”&lt;ref name="kim"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mei.edu/content/truth-commissions-south-korea-lessons-learned|title=Truth Commissions in South Korea: Lessons Learned|date=20 December 2013|website=Middle East Institute|last1=Joon Kim|first1=Hun}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further in 2006, the Commission launched a long-term excavation project to find the remains of the victims and discover mass graves. Consequently, by 2013, eight out of 151 mass murder sites, and the remains of over 400 victims had been discovered.

==Controversies of the investigation==
Criticisms of the commission include:

* Despite no direct evidence found that the Central South Korean Labor Party was involved in the 4.3 Incident, it is however very clear that armed leftist guerrillas under the leadership of the SKLP murdered police and military officers, including their families, election managers, and civilians.
* Issues remain with the calculations of victims of the 4.3 events. As such, as described by the Jeju 4.3 Committee, precise calculation of victims is extremely difficult. Consequently, the number of victims reported may not include the total victims. As explained by the Committee, “There are still many undeclared and unidentified victims.”&lt;ref name="report"/&gt;
* Resulting from the 4.3 Incident, victims of the right-wing organizations such as the Seobuk Young Men’s Association, Minbodan thru and Daecheong were given ‘National Veteran” status, along with national support and privileges.
* It is believed that several members of the Seobuk Young Men’s Association arrived in Jeju prior to the Incident, and engaged in several conflicts with civilians, which are the origins of the 4.3 Incident. During this time the members engaged in suppression, including torture and murder. Further, several testimonies and documents reveal that President Rhee Syng-man and the United States Army ordered the Seobuk Men’s Association to dispatch to Jeju island.
* There are issues surrounding the Martial Law implemented on November 17, 1948, such that it may have been illegal given it was enforced without any legal grounds. The conclusion of the report does not confirm this issue directly, but points out that the Martial Law certainly surpassed its parameters. 
* A major position is that the United States Military Government and the Provisional Military Advisory Group (PNAG) should not be free from responsibility of the suppression and occurrences of the 4.3 Incident. Evidence has shown that the US Army Colonel in Jeju directly commanded the Suppression Operation; in addition to this the US Army supplying weapons and observation aircraft for the Suppression Operation. The US also “praised the 9th Regiment’s Operation, burning down the Mountainous villages as a successful operation, and one record reveals Commodore William L. Roberts, director of the US Military Advisors requested to the Korean Government to announce publicly of Regiment Chief, Song Yo-Chan’s active involvements via Presidential Statement.”&lt;ref name="report"/&gt;
* There were severe damages resulting from the Guilt-by-association System. The family members of the deceased by way of the Incident, regardless of being innocent or guilty, were under strict observation and experienced limited social engagement, in the absence of any legal grounds for this treatment. Despite the system being revoked in 1981, there was continued psychological damage experienced by family members of the deceased.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2062">The '''Jewish poll tax''' ({{lang-pl|poglówne żydowskie}}) was a [[poll tax]] imposed on the [[Jews]] in [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. It was later absorbed into the ''[[hiberna]]'' tax. &lt;ref name=scep&gt;''Scepter of Judah: The Jewish Autonomy in the Eighteenth-Century Crown Poland'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=1fGQfpMdp84C&amp;pg=PA15 pp. 15-16]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=camb&gt;The Cambridge Dictionary of Judaism and Jewish Culture, p. 118 ([https://www.scribd.com/document/245942663/The-Cambridge-Dictionary-of-Judaism-and-Jewish-Culture browse for "skhumot" online])&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jews were exempt from other state and municipal taxes, which often caused protests from Polish city dwellers.&lt;ref name=scep/&gt;

Initially the collection of the tax was a duty of Jewish Councils ([[Council of Four Lands]], [[Council of the Land of Lithuania]]). Sometimes it was paid to the royal treasury, other times in was paid directly to the military units funded from this tax.&lt;ref name=camb/&gt;

The Jewish councils divide the tax into smaller internal divisions called "portions" (Hebrew: ''skhumot'', Polish: ''sympla'').&lt;ref name=scep/&gt;&lt;ref name=camb/&gt; The sum of the portions was always larger than the state-imposed amount, and the council used the surplus for the needs of Jewish community and the council apparatus. This practice was common for non-Jewish taxes as well,  and the Crown was aware of it.&lt;ref name=scep/&gt;

By early 17th century the duty of Jewish poll tax was transferred to ''[[sejmik]]s'', later to Polish military, and by mid-17th century it was absorbed into the ''hiberna''.&lt;ref name=scep/&gt;

{{Unreferenced|date=May 2007}}
The '''''Jus de non evocando''''' is an ancient feudal right, stating that no one can be kept from the competent court. It derives from a medieval principle that subjects of the Crown were entitled to ''ius de non evocando'', the right to enjoy the jurisdiction and protection of the Crown to which they were loyal. As such it is still present in several constitutions, such as the [[German constitution]], the [[Italian constitution ]] and the [[Constitution of the Netherlands|Dutch constitution]].

It has today become an important concept in [[public international law]] by which states refuse to [[extradition|extradite]] their own citizens.  Some countries may refuse to extradite non-nationals, who, because of their crimes, may be subject to the death penalty. This may be seen in the case of Canada and Mexico vis-à-vis the United States.

This principle is frequently argued in cases of the [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]] (ICTR) and [[International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia| former Yugoslavia]] (ICTY). The foundation lies in that the international tribunal, by seizing jurisdiction over an international criminal trial from national courts, is violating the principle of ''jus de non evocando''. The Trial Chamber in the case of Dusko Tadic (IT-94-1 of the ICTY) stated that states give up some measure of sovereignty to be a part of the UN and the ICTY is a product of the UN, therefore there is no violation.

'''Lebanese nationality law''' is the law governing the acquisition, transmission and loss of Lebanese citizenship. Lebanese citizenship is the status of being a citizen of the Republic of [[Lebanon]] and it can be obtained by [[jus sanguinis|birth]] or [[naturalisation]]. The Lebanese nationality is transmitted by [[Paternity (law)|paternity]] (father) (see [[Jus sanguinis]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lebanon-women-property-rights-idUSKCN0YH03O Lebanese citizenship law strips women of identity and property]&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, a Lebanese man who holds Lebanese citizenship can automatically confer citizenship to his children and foreign wife (only if entered in the Civil Acts Register in the Republic of Lebanon). Under the current law, descendants of Lebanese [[emigration|emigrants]] can only receive citizenship from their father and women cannot pass on citizenship to their children or foreign spouses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Lebanon-News/2014/May-01/255048-bassil-promises-to-ease-citizenship-for-expatriates.ashx#axzz30yVHukzf Bassil promises to ease citizenship for expatriates]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lebanon-women-property-rights-idUSKCN0YH03O Lebanese citizenship law strips women of identity and property]&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 November 2015, the [[Parliament of Lebanon]] approved a draft law that would allow "foreigners of [[Lebanese diaspora|Lebanese origin]] to get citizenship",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Lebanon-News/2015/Nov-13/322862-parliament-passes-army-citizenship-food-bills.ashx]&lt;/ref&gt; the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Emigrants [[Gebran Bassil]] announced on 5 May 2016 the beginning of the implementation of citizenship law for Lebanese diaspora.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Lebanon-News/2016/May-05/350667-bassil-announces-citizenship-law-for-lebanese-diaspora-in-effect.ashx Bassil announces implementation of citizenship law for Lebanese diaspora]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|user=Gebran_Bassil|author=Gebran Bassil|number=728128700147900417|date=5 May 2016|title=باسيل: نعلن لكم اليوم رسميا اطلاق العمل لتطبيق قانون استعادة الجنسية في ورشة وطنية عالمية #LDE2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{additional  citation|date=November 2016}} A law passed in 2008 permitted Lebanese abroad to vote in Lebanese elections starting in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7643743.stm |title=Lebanon approves new election law |work=[[BBC News]] |date=30 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rights and responsibilities of Lebanese citizens==

===Rights of citizens===
Citizens of the Republic of Lebanon by law have the legal right to:
* Live freely in the Republic of Lebanon without any [[immigration]] requirements
* Gain access to free education covering primary, secondary and university education 
* Receive all health-care benefits at any public health institution
* Participate in the Lebanese political system
* Benefit from the privileges of the free trade market agreements between the Republic of Lebanon and many Arab countries
* Get exempted from taxes with no condition of reciprocity
* Own and Inherit property and values in The Republic of Lebanon
* Enter to and exit from the Republic of Lebanon through any port
* Travel to and from other countries in accordance with [[visa (document)|visa]] requirements
* Seek consular assistance and protection abroad by the Republic of Lebanon through Lebanese embassies and consulates abroad

===Responsibilities of citizens===
All Lebanese citizens are required by law, when forced by the Lebanese government, to bear arms on behalf of the Republic of Lebanon, to perform noncombatant service in the [[Lebanese Armed Forces]], and to perform work of national importance under civilian direction.

==The code==
The code covering the Lebanese nationality was issued in 1926.

==Dual citizenship==
According to the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Emigrants (Lebanon)|Lebanese Ministry for Migration]], there has been no restriction on [[multiple citizenship]] in The Republic of Lebanon since 1 January 1926.{{cn|date=November 2016}} Thus, foreigners who acquire Lebanese citizenship and Lebanese citizens who voluntarily acquire another citizenship keep their previous citizenship (subject to the laws of the other country), as was the case before that date.

Since many [[nationality law]]s now allow both parents to transmit their nationality to their common child (and not only the father, as used to often be the case), many children automatically acquire multiple citizenship at birth. However, the Lebanese Ministry for Migration specially notes that this has not resulted in any practical problems worth mentioning. [[Military service]], the most likely problem to arise, is usually done in the country where the applicant resides at the time of conscription. For instance, a [[Armenian_nationality_law#Dual_citizenship|dual Lebanese-Armenian national]] must do his military service in Armenia, since [[Republic of Armenia]] has [[Military_service#Armenia|compulsory military service]] for two years for males from 18 to 27 years old. All male dual citizens regardless where they live are required to serve in the military as if they were Armenian resident citizen with certain exceptions. Most male Armenian citizens living outside of Armenia do not return to serve in the military.

[[Lebanese Armed Forces#Conscription|Lebanon previously had mandatory military service]] for men only. All men were required to do 1 year of military service through age 18+. Training was only done whenever they had free time or time off school including summer vacations and holidays. There were also training done alongside high school. On May 4, 2005, a new conscription system was adopted, making for a six-month service, and pledging to end conscription within two years. As of February 10, 2007 mandatory military service no longer exists in Lebanon thus making it a conscription-free all-volunteer force.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lebarmy.gov.lb/article.asp?ln=en&amp;id=13251], Lebanese Army (official website)  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141210165323/http://www.lebarmy.gov.lb/article.asp?ln=en&amp;id=13251 |date=December 10, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acquisition of Lebanese Citizenship==

===''Jus sanguinis''===
A child is Lebanese at birth if:
* He/She is the child of a married couple of whom the [[Paternity (law)|father]] is a Lebanese citizen&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lebanon-women-property-rights-idUSKCN0YH03O Lebanese citizenship law strips women of identity and property]&lt;/ref&gt;
* He/She is the child of a Lebanese father not married to the mother if the link of paternity has been declared

=== Simplified naturalization by virtue of marriage ===
A foreign wife married to a male Lebanese citizen may apply for Lebanese citizenship by facilitated naturalization after having been married for at least one year and their marriage has been entered in the Civil Acts Register in the Republic of Lebanon since then. No language test is required, but the spouse must show the following:

* Integration into the Lebanese way of life; and
* Compliance with the Lebanese rule of law; and
* No danger to the Republic of Lebanon's internal or external security

It is also possible for the foreign wife of a Lebanese citizen to apply for facilitated naturalization while resident overseas after the following:

* One year of marriage to a husband who is a Lebanese citizen; and
* Close ties to the Republic of Lebanon

==Birth in the Republic of Lebanon==
Birth in the Republic of Lebanon does not in itself confer Lebanese citizenship. Therefore, [[Jus soli]] does not apply.

== Loss of Lebanese citizenship ==

===Loss due to cessation of paternity===
A child whose Lebanese citizenship depends on paternal links loses citizenship when those are cut.

===Loss due to adoption===
A Lebanese child adopted by foreign parents is considered to have lost Lebanese citizenship.

====Annulled adoptions====
Where a former Lebanese citizen lost citizenship due to adoption by foreign parents and that adoption is later annulled, the Lebanese citizenship is considered to never have been lost.

===Loss due to birth abroad===
A Lebanese citizen born abroad to a Lebanese father and holding at least one other nationality loses the Lebanese citizenship at age 25 if:{{cn|date=November 2016}}
* She/He has never been announced to the Lebanese authorities, or 	
* She/He has never written to the Lebanese authorities expressing her/his desire to retain Lebanese citizenship, or 	
* She/He (or her/his guardians) have never sought to procure Lebanese identity documents for her/him, i.e. a passport or an identity card	
* Equally, the child of a person who thus loses Lebanese nationality equally loses Lebanese nationality
* Exceptionally, a person who has been prevented, against their will, from taking the necessary actions to retain Lebanese citizenship may undertake the required actions within a delay of 1 year following the cessation of such delays

===Dual Citizenship===
Even though Lebanese nationality law permits multiple citizenship, a Lebanese national who also holds another country's citizenship may be required to renounce the foreign citizenship, under the foreign country's nationality law. A dual Lebanese-Japanese national must, for instance, make a declaration of choice, to the Japanese [[Ministry of Justice (Japan)|Ministry of Justice]], before turning 22, as to whether he or she wants to keep the Lebanese or [[Japanese citizenship]].

==Reforms==
There is a public demand for giving the opportunity for Lebanese women to transmit their Lebanese nationality to their children and also to their husbands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.menassat.com/?q=en/news-articles/6446-lebanese-interior-minister-supports-campaign-my-nationality-right-me-and-my-famil|title=Lebanese women sue for naturalization rights|date=28 April 2009|author=Saseen Kawzally}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nadinemoawad.com/2010/03/the-lebanese-nationality-law-will-pass-today/|title=The Lebanese Nationality Law Will Pass Today!|date=7 March 2010|author=Nadine Moawad}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lebanon-women-property-rights-idUSKCN0YH03O Lebanese citizenship law strips women of identity and property]&lt;/ref&gt; 
Moreover, the Lebanese citizenship to be given to the [[Lebanese diaspora|8-14 million diaspora]] of Lebanese living all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cedarfree.blogspot.com/2006/10/lebanese-diaspora.html|title=The Lebanese Diaspora|date=2 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gulfnews.com/news/mena/lebanon/lebanon-contemplates-a-new-citizenship-law-1.1621325]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 November 2015, [[Gebran Bassil]],  the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Emigrants (Lebanon)|Minister of Foreign Affairs and Emigrants]], "refused to compromise on a draft law that would grant citizenship to the descendants of Lebanese expatriates by expanding it to include the foreign spouses and children of [[Women in Lebanon|Lebanese women]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Lebanon-News/2015/Nov-07/322071-no-compromises-on-citizenship-law-foreign-minister.ashx]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 November 2015, the Lebanese Parliament and [[Free Patriotic Movement]] member Ibrahim Kanaan stated that the ministers have agreed to pass a "10-article draft law titled “The Reacquisition of Lebanese Citizenship to the Descendants of Lebanese Emigrants,” to grant those of Lebanese origin the nationality on the basis of certain procedures and legal pathways.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gulfnews.com/news/mena/lebanon/lebanon-contemplates-a-new-citizenship-law-1.1621325]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.annahar.com/article/283138-%D9%83%D9%86%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%A7%D8%AA%D9%81%D9%82%D9%86%D8%A7-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%A7%D9%82%D8%AA%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AD-%D9%82%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%88%D9%86-%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%B9%D8%A7%D8%AF%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AC%D9%86%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%A9&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 November 2015, the [[Parliament of Lebanon|Lebanese Parliament]] approved a raft of draft laws Thursday, including a law allowing foreigners of Lebanese origin to get citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Lebanon-News/2015/Nov-13/322862-parliament-passes-army-citizenship-food-bills.ashx]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 May 2016, the [[Gebran Bassil]],  the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Emigrants (Lebanon)|Minister of Foreign Affairs and Emigrants]] announced the beginning of the implementation of citizenship law for Lebanese diaspora.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Lebanon-News/2016/May-05/350667-bassil-announces-citizenship-law-for-lebanese-diaspora-in-effect.ashx Bassil announces implementation of citizenship law for Lebanese diaspora]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|user=Gebran_Bassil|author=Gebran Bassil|number=728128700147900417|date=5 May 2016|title=باسيل: نعلن لكم اليوم رسميا اطلاق العمل لتطبيق قانون استعادة الجنسية في ورشة وطنية عالمية #LDE2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{additional  citation|date=November 2016}} However, the law would allow only grandchildren of Lebanese paternal grandfathers but not grandchildren of Lebanese maternal grandmothers to apply for citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lebanon-women-property-rights-idUSKCN0YH03O Lebanese citizenship law strips women of identity and property]&lt;/ref&gt;

Every natural person who meets one of the two eligibility requirements has the right to reclaim his/her Lebanese nationality. 
*1- If the records of the 1921 census at the Ministry of the Interior and Municipalities, and the records of emigration clearly indicate that he/she or any direct paternal ancestral/predecessors or next of kin to the fourth degree were present in the Republic of Lebanon, as registered by the 1921 census records at the Ministry of the Interior and Municipalities (that will prove the emigration to a direct paternal/ancestral predecessor.

This law intends to verify the “actual presence of Lebanese relatives in the town, village or neighborhood,” which an individual would claim, including the degree of kinship, along with any ownership/holding of rights to real property that may have been “devised, bequeathed, or inherited from a Lebanese citizen.”

Although bureaucratic in nature, this aspect of the law was meant to encourage associations with the land, a defining feature of Lebanese nationality. Where one traced his/her roots were deemed vital that, again, added a specific feature to the law.
The law would allow grandchildren of Lebanese paternal grandfathers to apply for citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lebanon-women-property-rights-idUSKCN0YH03O Lebanese citizenship law strips women of identity and property]&lt;/ref&gt; The latest law would help Lebanese expatriates take part in future Lebanese parliamentary elections by voting at Lebanese embassies abroad. The number of Lebanese living outside the country is thought to at least double the number of citizens living inside,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Lebanon-News/2014/May-01/255048-bassil-promises-to-ease-citizenship-for-expatriates.ashx#axzz30yVHukzf Bassil promises to ease citizenship for expatriates]&lt;/ref&gt; which means at least 8 million people.

== Solicitors' Accounts Rules ==

Depending on the category of legal work being carried out, solicitors regularly handle client monies, and due to the risk of [[fraud]] or [[money laundering]], they must adhere to a strict Solicitors' Code of Conduct&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sra.org.uk/solicitors/code-of-conduct.page Solicitors' Code of Conduct]&lt;/ref&gt; and comply with the Solicitors' Accounts Rules.

Although there is no legal requirement for a Legal Cashier to have received formal training in England and Wales, the Solicitors Accounts Rules 1998 state that "the person who maintains the books of account must have a full knowledge of the rules and the accounting requirements of solicitors' firms".

== Qualifications ==

The Institute of Legal Finance &amp; Management (ILFM) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilfm.org.uk/ Institute of Legal Finance &amp; Management]&lt;/ref&gt; (formed in 1978 as The Institute of Legal Cashiers) provide a formal qualification, The ILFM Diploma, to "provide a sound comprehensive and practical knowledge of the maintenance of solicitor's internal financial records, to meet compliance requirements". Candidates who pass receive a Certificate but must complete two years experience in the accounts department of a law firm before they can get associate membership or use the designatory letters.

In 2007, the University of Chester accredited an employer based training program, "Professional Certificate in Legal Account Management" which provides a foundation degree course combining academic study with workplace learning. However, this is only available to employees of Quill Pinpoint, the employer associated with the scheme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legalsupportnetwork.co.uk/index.php/news/details/quill_reaps_rewards_of_university_partnership/  Professional Certificate in Legal Account Management] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322165313/http://www.legalsupportnetwork.co.uk/index.php/news/details/quill_reaps_rewards_of_university_partnership/ |date=2012-03-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Legal deposit''' is a legal requirement that a person or group submit copies of their [[publication]]s to a repository, usually a [[library]]. The requirement is mostly limited to books and [[periodical]]s. The number of copies varies and can range from one to 19 (in Poland). Typically, the [[national library]] is one of the repositories of these copies. In some countries there is also a legal deposit requirement placed on the government, and it is required to send copies of documents to publicly accessible libraries.

In the year 2000, [[UNESCO]] published recommendations for the construction of legal deposit legislation.&lt;ref&gt;Larivière, Jules. – Guidelines for legal deposit legislation, - Paris : United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, 2000. – [http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0012/001214/121413eo.pdf (scanned version)], [http://archive.ifla.org/VII/s1/gnl/legaldep1.htm (HTML version)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==By country==

===Australia===
In Australia, section 201 of [[Australian copyright law|Copyright Act 1968]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca1968133/s201.html|title=COPYRIGHT ACT 1968 - SECT 201: Delivery of library material to the National Library|work=austlii.edu.au|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120228021136/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca1968133/s201.html|archivedate=2012-02-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other state acts requires that a copy of all printed materials published in Australia be deposited with the [[National Library of Australia]]. State laws require books and a wide range of other materials published in each state to be deposited in the applicable state library. New South Wales, Queensland and South Australia also require books published in those states to be deposited in the library of the state parliament. New South Wales law also requires books published in that state to be deposited in the [[University of Sydney]] library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nla.gov.au/services/LegalDepositStates.html|title=Legal Deposit &gt; States &amp; Territories|publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
In Canada, the Library and Archives of Canada Act (2004)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/L-7.7/index.html|title=Page not Found - Page non trouvé|website=laws.justice.gc.ca|accessdate=28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; specifies that up to two copies of any published material must be deposited with Library and Archives Canada. Materials deposited in the archives are catalogued; the catalogs are available as part of the [[Library and Archives Canada]] website. The province of Quebec also requires deposit of two copies of any document be deposited to [[Bibliothèque et Archives nationales du Québec]] within 7 days of its publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.banq.qc.ca/services/depot_legal/index.html?language_id=1|title=Legal deposit -  BAnQ|website=www.banq.qc.ca|accessdate=28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===

In China, Article 22 of ''Regulations on the Administration of Publication'' (2001)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fdi.gov.cn/1800000121_39_2227_0_7.html | title=Regulations on the Administration of Publication | at=Article 23 | publisher=''The State Council'' | date=December 25, 2001 | accessdate=7 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; states that three copies of each printed publication should be submitted to the [[National Library of China]], one copy to the Archives Library of Chinese Publications and one copy to the administrative department for publication under the State Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nlc.gov.cn/old2008/service/others/jiaosong/dongtai.htm|title=致出版社：关于缴送图书册数的说明|publisher=''National Library of China''|date=July 3, 2006|accessdate=7 September 2013}} (in Chinese)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colombia===

In Colombia, the law of legal deposit is regulated by Law 44 of 1993, the statutory Decree 460 of March 16 of 1999, and Decree 2150 of 1995. These laws and decrees are specifically about the [[National Library of Colombia]]. The creators of printed works, as well as audiovisual, audio, and video productions, should supply the library with a specified number of copies of the works, whether they were produced within the Colombian territory or imported.
*For printed works, two copies of each of the works produced within the national territory should be delivered to the National Library of Colombia; one copy to the ''Biblioteca del Congreso de la República de Colombia'' (Library of the Congress of the Republic of Colombia), and one copy to the Central Library of the ''[[Universidad Nacional de Colombia]]'' (National University of Colombia), excepting a few cases in which the high cost of the edition or the short duration of publication makes it possible to deliver fewer copies.
*For audiovisual and audio works, as well as for published works that have been imported, only one copy needs to be delivered to the National Library.

===Denmark===
In Denmark, legal deposit has been required since 1697,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pligtaflevering.dk/hvaderpligtaflevering/index.htm|title=Pligtaflevering.dk|work=pligtaflevering.dk}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is handled by the [[Royal Danish Library]] (for most written works) and by the State and University Library (for newspapers, audio, and video); two copies must be supplied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pligtaflevering.dk/hvaderpligtaflevering/hvortil.htm|title=Pligtaflevering.dk|work=pligtaflevering.dk}}&lt;/ref&gt; This also includes works in digital format, and the publisher may be required to supply the necessary passwords.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pligtaflevering.dk/hvemonline.htm|title=Pligtaflevering.dk|work=pligtaflevering.dk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Faroe Islands===
Legal deposit of four copies of every publication is required to the [[National Library of the Faroe Islands]] under a law passed on July 16, 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.flb.fo/Um-Landsbokasavnid/soga-og-endamal.html |title=Søga og endamál, Um Landsbókasavnið |publisher=National Library of the Faroe Islands |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100413014637/http://www.flb.fo/Um-Landsbokasavnid/soga-og-endamal.html |archivedate=April 13, 2010 |language=Faroese }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Finland===
In Finland, [[The Royal Academy of Turku]] was given right to receive a copy of all works published in Sweden in 1707. After Finland had been ceded by Sweden to Russia, this privilege was confirmed in 1809. In 1820, all Russian print presses began to send legal deposit copies to Finland.

Gaining its independence in 1917, Finland retained the principles of legal deposit. Helsinki University Library (the university had been transferred from Turku in 1827) remained the main deposit library. Additional copies began to be deposited in other libraries in Turku, Jyväskylä, and Vyborg (later Oulu). In 1984, the obligation to deposit was expanded to audiovisual materials; responsibility to preserve films was given to the [[Finnish Film Archive|National Audiovisual Institute.]]

A new act on depositing and preservation of cultural materials was given in 2007. The new act covers two new important types of cultural materials. The National Audiovisual Archive collects and preserves broadcast materials, whereas the [[National Library of Finland]] (Helsinki University Library renamed) takes care of capturing and preserving Web content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationallibrary.fi/publishers/deposit.html|title=Submitting of legal deposit copies - The National Library of Finland|author=Kansalliskirjasto, Nationalbiblioteket, The National Library of Finland|work=nationallibrary.fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
{{see also|Books in France}}
In France, legal deposit was initiated by the [[Ordonnance de Montpellier]] of 1537, under which a copy of any published book had to be delivered to the king's library, for conservation purposes. During the following centuries, legal deposit was sometimes used to facilitate censorship and the obligation was thus removed briefly during the [[French Revolution]], under the argument that it violated [[freedom of speech]]. The main depository is the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]]. Legal deposit is extremely developed and concerns not only printed material but also multimedia archives and even some web pages.

France is also unique in the world in funding the [[Osmothèque]], a legal deposit scent and fragrance archive to preserve [[perfume]] formulas.

===Germany===
{{see also|Media of Germany}}
In Germany, since 1960, the [[German National Library]] Law&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/dnbg/index.html|title=DNBG - nichtamtliches Inhaltsverzeichnis|work=gesetze-im-internet.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; has required that two copies of each print publication and of some non-print publications be sent to the German National Library in either [[Frankfurt am Main]] or [[Leipzig]] (depending on the publisher's location). Additionally, each [[States of Germany|federal state]] of Germany requires that one or two copies of works published in that state be deposited in the respective state repository.

=== Hong Kong ===
Under the [[Books Registration Act|Books Registration Ordinance, 1976]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/142/|title=CAP 142 BOOKS REGISTRATION ORDINANCE|work=hklii.hk}}&lt;/ref&gt; the publisher of a new book shall, within one month after the book is published, printed, produced or otherwise made in Hong Kong, deliver to the [[Secretary for Broadcasting, Culture and Sport]] free of charge five copies of the book.

A person who contravenes such requirement shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine of [[HK$]]2000.

The secretary is required to send one copy to the [[City Hall, Hong Kong|City Hall Library]], which was the main library of the previous [[Urban Council]], (or such other library as he may approve), and the British Library Board.

This requirement did not include any library under the previous [[Regional Council (Hong Kong)|Regional Council]] (the another municipal council in Hong Kong), and was not amended since the [[Hong Kong Central Library]] was open and replaced the City Hall Library as the main library for the whole dependent territory.

===Hungary===

===Iceland===
In Iceland, four copies of any published, printed, material must be sent to the [[National and University Library of Iceland]], three of which will be kept there, and one of which will be kept at [[Amtsbókasafnið|Amtsbókasafnið á Akureyri]] in [[Akureyri]]. If fewer than 50 copies are made only two are required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://landsbokasafn.is/id/1010705|title=Landsbókasafn-Leiðbeiningar|publisher=|accessdate=28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
{{see also|Book publishing in India}}
The Delivery of Books Act 1954 enacted by the Indian parliament regulates the deposit of books published in India to the [[National Library of India]], Kolkata and three other libraries namely, [[Connemara Public Library]], Chennai; Central Library, Mumbai and the [[Delhi Public Library]]. The Act was amended in 1956 to include periodicals and newspapers. The Indian National Bibliography is compiled on the receipt of books received under Delivery of Books Act at the National Library, Kolkata.

===Israel===
In Israel, "The Books Law 2000 (5761)" requires two copies of each publication to be sent to the [[National Library of Israel]]. At their request, the library of the [[Knesset]] and the [[Israel State Archive]] are entitled to receive one copy each.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.nli.org.il/sites/NLI/Hebrew/library/depositing/Pages/default.aspx Legal Deposit Department] of the National Library of Israel.&lt;/ref&gt;

The government authorities are required by the "Freedom of Information Act, 1999" to send an annual report of their actions to the public library of every town with 5,000 people or more.

===Italy===
{{see also|Media of Italy}}
In Italy, the law on legal deposit ([[s:it:Legge 15 aprile 2004, n.106 - Deposito legale|15 April 2004, n. 106]]) requires a copy of each publication to be sent to both the [[National Central Library (Florence)|National Central Library of Florence]] and [[National Central Library (Rome)|National Central Library of Rome]], as it has been since the institution of the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]] (1861).

In addition, the [[Regions of Italy|regions]] determine local regional and [[Provinces of Italy|provincial]] legal deposit libraries, which receive two more copies and often inherit that status from their pre-unification history. For instance, the [[Biblioteca Nazionale Braidense]] is the [[Lombardy]] legal deposit library since 1788 (when it covered the [[Duchy of Milan]]), and the National Central Library of Florence since 1743 (for the [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]]).

===Japan===
The legal deposit requirements for Japan's [[National Diet Library]] are specified in Chapters X through XI-3 of the National Diet Library Law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ndl.go.jp/en/aboutus/laws.html |title=National Diet Library Law |publisher=National Diet Library |access-date=2015-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These requirements vary based on whether the publishing entity is governmental or nongovernmental, and on whether the work is published physically or online.  Required works are books, pamphlets, serials, music scores, maps, films, other documents or charts, phonographic records, and digital text, images, sounds, or programs.  Nongovernmental publishers must submit a single copy, and are entitled to "compensation equivalent to the expenses usually required for the issue and deposit of the publication;" noncompliance is subject to a fine.

===Kenya===
In Kenya, the legal deposit regulation is covered under the [[Books and Newspaper Act]] Cap. 111 of 1960.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.issafrica.org/cdct/mainpages/pdf/Terrorism/Legislation/Kenya/Kenya%20Books%20and%20Newspapers%20Act.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; It covers books (any volume), encyclopaedia, magazines, review, gazette, pamphlet, leaflet, sheet of letterpress, sheet of music, map, plan and chart. However, it gives exceptions to letter heading, price list, annual reports, trade circular, trade advertisement, government publications, legal, trade or business document. The Acts gives the mandate to [[Kenya National Library Service]] and the [[Registrar of Books and Newspapers]]. According to the Act, publishers should deposit two copies with the [[Director, Kenya National Library Service]] and not more than three copies to the Registrar of Books and Newspapers as it may be specified. The regulations were last reviewed in the year 2002 where penalties were specified for non-compliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.knls.ac.ke/national-library|title=National Library|author=Ronald Makori|work=knls.ac.ke}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liechtenstein===
The Liechtenstein State Library, colloquially known as the State Library, was formally established by law by the National Library Foundation in 1961. The State Library possesses a legal depository. As per the amended statutes, the roles of the State Library changed as such: the State Library now functions as a national library as well as a scientific and public library. As a national library, the State Library collects print materials, pictures and music created by citizens of Liechtenstein as well as items related to Liechtenstein. Also, the State Library acts as a patent library for the Principality of Liechtenstein and as such provides access to comprehensive international patent information. The State Library’s rules and regulations must follow the current legislation under Liechtenstein’s European Economic Area as well as Swiss legislation.&lt;ref&gt;retrieved from http://www.landesbibliothek.li&lt;/ref&gt;

===Malaysia===
In Malaysia, according to the ''Akta Penyerahan Bahan Perpustakaan 1986'' (Deposit of Library Material Act 1986), five copies of printed library materials including books, printed materials, maps, charts and posters must be deposited to the [[National Library of Malaysia]]. In addition, two copies of non-printed library materials must also be deposited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agc.gov.my/Akta/Vol.%207/Akta%20331%20-%20Akta%20Penyerahan%20Bahan%20Perpustakaan%201986.pdf|title=Akta 331 - Akta Penyerahan Bahan Perpustakaan 1986, Attorney General's Chambers of Malaysia|publisher=|accessdate=28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
The legal deposit was initiated in 1903 in New Zealand, and requires that copies of all printed documents, offline documents (e.g. DVDs), internet publications and websites are sent to the [[National Library of New Zealand]] within 20 working days of publication. This process is given legal force by Part 4 of the National Library of New Zealand (Te Puna Mātauranga o Aotearoa) Act 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.natlib.govt.nz/services/legal-deposit-donations/legal-deposit-intro|title=Legal Deposit|work=natlib.govt.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt; If more than 100 copies are printed in total, 2 copies must be provided, otherwise 1.

=== Poland ===
Since 1780 the [[Załuski Library]] has been entitled to a copy of all works published in Poland. In modern times the issue is regulated by a Decree of the Minister of Culture and Arts of March 6, 1997. The [[National Library of Poland]] and the [[Jagiellonian Library]] receive two copies of all publications, one of which is to be stored indefinitely. In addition to that, there are 15 other libraries to receive legal deposits to be stored for ''no less than 50 years'': [[Maria Curie-Skłodowska University Library]], [[University of Łódź Library]], [[Nicolaus Copernicus University Library]], [[Adam Mickiewicz University Library]], [[Warsaw University Library]], [[University of Wrocław Library]], [[Silesian Library]], [[City of Warsaw Library]], [[Pomeranian Library]] in Szczecin, [[University of Gdańsk Library]], [[Catholic University of Lublin Library]], [[University of Opole Library]] and [[Podlaskie Library]] in Białystok. The [[National Film Library]] (''Filmoteka Narodowa'') is to receive all film productions, while the [[Sejm Library]] receives a copy of all legal documents.

=== Portugal ===
In Portugal, all publishers are currently required to deposit 11 copies of all publications, which are distributed between the [[National Library of Portugal]], municipal libraries of major cities, and the libraries of public institutions of science and higher learning.

===Singapore===
In Singapore, the ''[[National Library Board Act]]'' requires all publishers in Singapore to deposit two copies of every publication to the [[National Library Board]] at their own expense within four weeks from the publication date.

===Slovenia===
The forerunner of the [[National and University Library of Slovenia]], the Lyceum Library of [[Ljubljana]] was  established around 1774 by a decree issued by [[Maria Theresa]] from the remains of the Jesuit Library and several monastery libraries. The submission of legal deposit copies to the Lyceum library became mandatory with a decree published by the Austrian court in 1807, at first only in [[Carniola]], except for a short period of French occupation, when it received copies from all the [[Illyrian provinces]]. In 1919, it was named ''State Reference Library'' and started to collect legal deposit copies from the [[Slovenia]] of the time. In the same year, the [[University of Ljubljana]] (the first Slovenian university) was established and the library served its needs too. In 1921, it started to acquire legal deposit copies from the entire [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]. It was named the University Library in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://search.theeuropeanlibrary.org/portal/en/libraryHistory.html?libraryid=39 |title=History &amp; Collections - National and University Library of Slovenia |work=The European Library |first1=Mojca |last1=Savnik |first2=Dare |last2=Balažic |first3=Žiga |last3=Cerkvenik |publisher=Koninklijke Bibliotheek}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Digital Library of Slovenia|Digitalna knjižnica Slovenije]] ([http://www.dlib.si/?&amp;language=eng Digital library of Slovenia]) is a project of the National and University Library of Slovenia.

===South Africa===
In South Africa the [[Legal Deposit Act, 1997]] requires publishers to provide five copies of every book published, if the [[print run]] consists of 100 or more copies. These copies must be deposited in the [[National Library of South Africa]] (NLSA) in [[Cape Town]], the NLSA in [[Pretoria]], the [[Mangaung Local Municipality|Mangaung]] Library Services in [[Bloemfontein]], the [[Msunduzi Local Municipality|Msunduzi]] Municipal Library in [[Pietermaritzburg]], and the Library of [[Parliament of South Africa|Parliament]] in Cape Town. If the print run is less than 100 copies, then only one copy is required, to be deposited in the NLSA in Cape Town. If it is less than 20 copies, then no deposit is required.

For films, videos and [[sound recording]]s, the requirements are the same, except that the [[National Archives of South Africa|National Film, Video and Sound Archives]] (NFVSA) receives a deposit copy instead of the Library of Parliament, and if only one copy is required it is deposited in the NFVSA rather than the NLSA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nlsa.ac.za/NLSA/services/for%20publishers%20and%20authors/legal-deposit-information/legaldep.pdf |title=Legal Deposit Information |publisher=National Library of South Africa |accessdate=21 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spain===
{{See also|Media of Spain}}
In Spain, the obligation to deposit copies of printed materials has existed since 1619 for the Royal Library of [[El Escorial]] and since 1716 for the Royal Library of Madrid (later the [[National Library of Spain]]).&lt;ref name="Gallent"&gt;{{cite book |title=El depósito legal de obras impresas en España; su historia, su reorganización y resultados, 1958-1961. |last=Guastavino Gallent |first=Guillermo |year=1962 |publisher=Dirección General de Archivos y Bibliotecas |location=Madrid |language=Spanish |oclc=6467776}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|8}} From this moment, there followed multiple provisions, in the 19th century termed "legal deposit", all with the aim of enforcing compliance.

The decree of 1957 established a solid administrative base for legal deposit in Spain, based on the separation between provincial offices that managed legal deposit at the local level and conservation libraries, such as the National Library. The decree stipulated that printers were responsible for depositing several copies of all published works at the National Library and other public libraries. This legal deposit legislation covered a wide range of materials, including printed materials such as books and magazines, sound recordings, maps, movies, and postcards.&lt;ref name="Gallent" /&gt;{{rp|95–97}}

The 1957 decree, though superseded by other decrees in 1971 and 1973, remained almost intact until 2011, when a new legal deposit law was passed on July 29, 2011. Law 23/2011 established, among other things, that the publisher, not the printer, was the primary entity responsible for submitting its materials to legal deposit. It also established procedures for the legal deposit of electronic materials, including online ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author = Government of Spain |year=2011 | title =Ley 23/2011, de 29 de julio, de depósito legal |journal=Boletín Oficial del Estado |issue=182 |publication-date= 30 July 2011 | publication-place=Madrid | language =Spanish | pages=86716–86727 | url=http://www.boe.es/boe/dias/2011/07/30/pdfs/BOE-A-2011-13114.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate =13 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of copies that must be delivered to each library varies between two and four according to the type of material. Through legal deposit, the National Library collects all materials published in Spain. The central libraries for each [[Autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous community]] collect works published in their respective communities, and provincial libraries collect works published in their respective provinces.

===Sri Lanka===
First legal deposit of Sri Lanka was established in 1885 at the National Museum Library. The law of the country (according to National Archives Act No. 48 of 1973).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.commonlii.org/lk/legis/num_act/nal48o1973234/  |date=30 April 2005 |website= Sri Lanka Consolidated Acts|access-date=25 October 2016|title=National Archives Law (No. 48 of 1973)}}&lt;/ref&gt;  requires that a copy of every document printed in the country has to be deposited in the legal deposit. There are five legal deposits in the country. These are the [[National Archives of Sri Lanka]], the [[National Library of Sri Lanka]], the [[National Museum Library]], the [[University of Peradeniya library]] and the [[Library, University of Ruhuna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lib.ruh.ac.lk/LD/?nav=legal|title=Legal deposit  |date=30 April 2005 |website=University of Ruhuna |access-date=25 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sweden===
The Swedish Legal Deposit Act originates in 1661. According to present legislation, copies of printed material, sound and moving images has to be sent to [[National Library of Sweden|The National Library of Sweden]] and [[Lund University Library]] (no audiovisual material). In 2012 the Legal Deposit Act for Electronic Material was passed. It states that starting in 2015, publishing companies and public authorities must deliver digitally published content to the National Library. In 2013-14 electronic legal deposits will start in a smaller scale.

Legal deposit in the United Kingdom traces its origins to an agreement between [[Sir Thomas Bodley]] and the [[Stationer's Company]] that copies of new books would be added to the collection of the [[Bodleian Library]] in [[Oxford]].&lt;ref name="muir2005"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dspace.lboro.ac.uk/dspace-jspui/handle/2134/8469|title=Loughborough University Institutional Repository|work=lboro.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Statute of Anne]] (1710) formalised the practice by extending it, in England, to the Royal Library (now the [[British Library]]), [[Cambridge University Library]], and the library of [[Sion College]], and, in Scotland, to the [[Advocates' Library]], and the universities of [[University of St Andrews|St. Andrews]], [[University of Edinburgh|Edinburgh]], [[University of Glasgow|Glasgow]] and [[University of Aberdeen|Aberdeen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copyrighthistory.com/anne5.html|title=History of Copyright: Statute of Anne, 1710|work=copyrighthistory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years the number of legal deposit libraries has gone up and down, but there are now six legal deposit libraries under UK law: the [[British Library]]; the [[National Library of Scotland]]; the [[National Library of Wales]]; the [[Bodleian Libraries]], Oxford; the [[Cambridge University Library|University Library]], Cambridge; and the [[Trinity College Dublin|Library of Trinity College]], Dublin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction to legal deposit|url=http://www.bl.uk/aboutus/legaldeposit/introduction/|publisher=British Library|accessdate=17 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the [[Irish Free State]] left the UK in 1922, Trinity College remains a UK deposit library, and the UK libraries reciprocally retain deposit rights for Irish publications.&lt;ref name="dail1963021400009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tcd"/&gt;

The 2003 Act set out provisions for the deposit of non-print works. This legislation was updated with the introduction of secondary legislation, [[The Legal Deposit Libraries (Non-Print Works) Regulations 2013]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2013/777/pdfs/uksi_20130777_en.pdf ''The Legal Deposit Libraries (Non-Print Works) Regulations 2013''], SI 2013/77&lt;/ref&gt; which make provision for the legal deposit of works published online or offline in formats other than print, such as websites, blogs, e-journals and CD-ROMs. Social media content is included in the legislation, but not private message sent via social media platforms.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6256">'''Microsystems Software, Inc. v. Scandinavia Online AB''' is a 2000 US District Court civil case, numbered 00-cv10488-EFH, in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts.  It received considerable attention in the online community because it involved [[reverse engineering]] and [[cryptanalysis]] of [[content-control software]], allegedly in violation of [[copyright]] law and a [[clickwrap]] license agreement.

In early 2000, [[Eddy L. O. Jansson]] and [[Matthew Skala]] reverse engineered the content-control package [[Cyber Patrol]] and published a report titled ''The Breaking of Cyber Patrol 4'' detailing what they found, including a [[cryptanalysis]] of the [[CRC-32]]-based [[hash function]] that concealed the configuration password and Web site and [[Usenet]] newsgroup blacklists.  They commented critically on the content of the blacklist, and highlighted apparent errors in it, innocuous sites and newsgroups blocked as objectionable for no visible reason.  Along with the essay, they included software in C and Delphi demonstrating the attacks and allowing users to disable the package, change its configuration, or browse the blacklists in decrypted form.  The break was widely reported on March 11, 2000. [http://slashdot.org/yro/00/03/11/117240.shtml]

On March 15, [[Microsystems Software]], the publisher of [[Cyber Patrol]], and [[Mattel]], its parent company, filed suit against Jansson, Skala, and the ISPs that hosted their personal Web sites, [[Scandinavia Online]] and [[Islandnet]].  They filed in US court, though Jansson and Scandinavia Online were located in [[Sweden]] and Skala and Islandnet were located in [[Canada]].  They alleged that the reverse engineering was copyright infringement by Jansson and Skala; that distributing the essay and software (or, in the case of Islandnet, the link on Skala's site pointing to the essay and software on Jansson's site) was copyright infringement by the ISPs; and that Jansson and Skala's actions constituted breach of the [[clickwrap]] license agreement on [[Cyber Patrol]], interference with advantageous business relations, 
[[Conversion (law)|conversion]], and theft of [[trade secret]]s. [http://ansuz.sooke.bc.ca/lawpoli/youthrights/cpbfaq.php#whatclaims]  Once the lawsuit became known, it attracted considerable attention from the online community, far overshadowing the discussion of the reverse engineering itself.  [https://www.wired.com/news/politics/0,1283,34998,00.html]

In response to demands from the plaintiffs, Scandinavia Online deleted Jansson's Web site and Islandnet asked Skala to remove his link to Jansson's (now non-existent anyway) Web site.  The document and software had already been mirrored on many sites worldwide, however.  The plaintiffs asked for, and received, a temporary restraining order against distribution of what they termed the "bypass code", and were authorized to serve it by email on mirror sites, along with a subpoena demanding the identities of every Web user who accessed the information.  [https://www.wired.com/news/business/0,1367,35196,00.html]  Some commentators dubbed these email-distributed subpoenas "[[spampoenas]]"; use of email for official service of court documents was, and remains, highly unusual if not absolutely unheard of. [http://tbtf.com/jargon-scout.html#spampoena]

On March 27, Skala announced that he had settled the cases against him (including one filed in a Canadian court as well as the US case) out of court and that Jansson was close to doing the same, with an agreement to stop distributing the essay and software and assign its copyrights to the plaintiffs. [http://cryptome.org/skala.htm]  Other parties had become involved, however, including three mirror site operators associated with [[Peacefire]] and backed by the [[ACLU]].  The suit continued 
with the main issue being whether those mirror sites would also be forced to stop distributing the material.  When their motions on that topic were dismissed, the mirror sites took that as an indication that they could continue to distribute it safely.

Meanwhile, some controversy erupted when news sources suggested that the exploit software had been released under the [[GPL]], making any restriction on its distribution problematic.  [https://www.wired.com/news/politics/0,1283,35226,00.html] Statements from Jansson and Skala denying any intention to place it under the GPL, the lack of any copyright notice in Skala's code, and a vague nonstandard GPL notice in Jansson's code, made it fall apart as a possible GPL test case.  In 2001, Jansson stated on his Web site that he had in fact intended his code to be under the GPL after all, even if he had not put in the proper notices to make that stick. [https://web.archive.org/web/20061011095008/http://gazonk.org/~eloj/articles/the_breaking_revisited.html]

At the time of the case, the [[DMCA]] was not relevant because its enforcement was under suspension pending a review by the [[United States Copyright Office]] of whether exceptions to its provisions should be made.  [[Lawrence Lessig]] nonetheless used the Microsystems case as an example of tension between the DMCA and the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] in his essay [http://www.lessig.org/content/standard/0,1902,13533,00.html Battling Censorware]; and when the Copyright Office issued their rulemaking on DMCA exemptions, they also cited this case in their discussion of why reverse engineering of content-filter blacklists was one of only two categories of activities exempted.

In 1998, the [[Mount Ashland]] Association (MAA) proposed an expansion of the '''[[Mount Ashland Ski Area]]''' into land generally west and downslope of the existing [[ski area]] in the Middle Branch watershed of the East Fork of [[Ashland Creek]]. The proposal included construction of a second lodge near the base of the glacial [[moraine]], a new chairlift in the Middle Branch watershed serving {{convert|72|acre|m2}} of new intermediate and advanced terrain, and 200 additional parking spaces.

Leading local conservation groups objected to the expansion plan, citing concerns about the effects of [[soil erosion]] on streams and [[wetland]]s in [[Ashland, Oregon|Ashland]]'s municipal watershed. There are also concerns for the [[Old-growth forest]], the [[McDonald Peak]] Inventoried Roadless Area, and sensitive wildlife such as the Pacific Fisher.

In 2000, the [[United States Forest Service]] issued its first draft [[Environmental impact statement|Environmental Impact Statement]] (EIS) considering the MAA expansion proposal. The EIS drew over 6,000 public comments, about half of which supported the MAA plan and half opposed.

In 2001, Jack Williams, supervisor of the [[Rogue River – Siskiyou National Forest|Rogue River-Siskiyou National Forest]], announced preparation of another EIS draft to address public comment regarding a lack of alternatives to the MAA proposal.

In 2003, the Forest Service issued its second draft EIS on expansion, this one with a broader range of alternatives. The second option was the MAA's original ski area expansion proposal. The third would develop half of the MAA proposal on the east side of the Middle Branch watershed and avoid development on the west side of that creek, thereby reducing impacts to the McDonald Peak Roadless Area. The fourth would develop additional ski facilities east of the existing ski area on The Knoll. The fifth advanced a community proposal to develop the ski area largely within its existing footprint. The sixth slightly modified the MAA proposal with a different ski run placement and a wetland crossing design introduced by the Forest Service. The second EIS draft drew a similar level of public comment as the first one, with about 50 percent favouring the MAA plan and half opposed.

In December 2004, Scott Conroy, supervisor of the Rogue River-Siskiyou National Forest, issued a Record of Decision that approved a blend of options 2 and 6 in the Final EIS. The Forest Service received 28 notices of appeal and denied all of them.

In January 2005, three organizations—[[Oregon Wild|Oregon Natural Resources Council]], Headwaters and Sierra Club—and an individual, Eric Navickas, filed suit in the U.S. District Court of Oregon alleging that the Record of Decision violated the [[National Forest Management Act]] (NFMA) and the [[National Environmental Policy Act]] (NEPA).  In February 2007, District Judge Owen Panner granted summary judgment to the Forest Service stating, "You cannot make an omelette without breaking a few eggs."

ONRC, Headwaters and Sierra Club, but not Navickas, appealed Panner's judgment to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. A motions panel of the appellate court issued an injunction that prevented implementation of the expansion while the conservation groups' appeal was under review. The motions panel, which included appointees of Presidents Jimmy Carter, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush, cited a likelihood of irreparable harm to Pacific fisher, a rare forest carnivore known to hunt at the exact location where the ski area would expand.

In September 2007, the Court of Appeals issued an opinion written by Judge Milan Smith, an appointee of [[President George W. Bush]], holding that the Forest Service violated federal law in four ways when it approved the ski area expansion. Specifically, the court held that the 2004 Record of Decision:
# Violated the Rogue River National Forest Plan and the NFMA by failing to designate and manage geologically unstable landslide terrain as Riparian Reserve.
# Violated the Rogue River National Forest Plan and the NFMA by failing to recognise and observe mandatory soil disturbance limits on Restricted Watershed lands.
# Violated the Rogue River National Forest Plan and the NFMA with an arbitrary and capricious biological evaluation of effects to Pacific fisher.
# Violated the NEPA by failing to disclose significant cumulative effects to the Siskiyou Crest biological corridor used by Pacific Fisher.

The appellate court specifically noted that the Aquatic Conservation Strategy of the [[Northwest Forest Plan]] "prohibits the Forest Service from 'using mitigation or planned restoration as a substitute for preventing habitat degradation' within Riparian Reserves, and explains that 'priority must be given to protecting existing high-quality habitat' rather than compensating 'or management actions that degrade existing habitat' through mitigation and restoration." It remanded the case to the district court and instructed the lower court to enjoin the ski area expansion "until the Forest Service has corrected the NFMA and NEPA violations we find in this opinion."

In October 2007, Linda Duffy, ranger of the Siskiyou Mountains Ranger District, announced that the Forest Service would produce a supplemental EIS to address the legal violations identified by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and move the ski area expansion forward.

In April 2011, the Forest Service issued a Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement regarding the Mt. Ashland Ski Area Expansion.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.firsttracksonline.com/2011/06/27/opponents-proponents-of-mt-ashland-expansion-prepare-for-battle/&lt;/ref&gt; It described approximately 67 acres of Riparian Reserve on geologically unstable lands that were overlooked in the 2004 Final EIS, as well as numerous locations where the expansion project would disturb hazardous landslide terrain. It further disclosed that the ski area expansion would render approximately 500 acres of roadless, old-growth forest habitat unusable to Pacific fisher.

Concurrent with the supplemental EIS, forest supervisor Conroy issued a Supplemental Record of Decision approving the original expansion plan without modification. Subsequently, Judge Panner lifted the injunction on the expansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.mailtribune.com/article/20120817/NEWS07/208170357/|title = Mt. Ashland expansion can proceed, federal judge rules|date = 17 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the ski area successfully undertook several projects identified in its expansion plans,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oregonlive.com/pacific-northwest-news/index.ssf/2013/03/mount_ashland_ski-area_expansi.html&lt;/ref&gt; including a 20% increase to its parking lot and the widening the Sonnet beginner ski run, in addition to several other ski runs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.mailtribune.com/article/20130905/NEWS/309050319/|title = Ski area parking lot expansion is under way|date = 5 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2016, a three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit ruled in favor of the ski area over a complaint filed by Oregon Wild, [[Sierra Club Canada|Sierra Club]] and Center for Biological Diversity, challenging the Forest Service's failure to prepare a supplemental environmental impact statement for the Mount Ashland ski area expansion project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-9th-circuit/1751289.html|title = OREGON WILD SIERRA CLUB CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY v.

'''Mrs. Winslow's Soothing Syrup''' is a [[patent medicine]] supposedly compounded by Mrs. Charlotte N. Winslow, and first marketed by her son-in-law Jeremiah Curtis and Benjamin A. Perkins of Bangor, Maine, USA{{r|WoodLibrary}} in 1849.{{r|MuseumOfDrugs}}  The formula consisted of [[Morphine|morphine sulphate]] (65 mg per [[fluid ounce]]), [[sodium carbonate]], spirits foeniculi, and [[aqua ammonia]]. It was claimed that it was "likely to sooth any human or animal", and it effectively quieted restless infants and small children especially for [[teething]].{{r|LCDL}} It was widely marketed in the UK and the US. As well as newspapers, the company used various media to promote its product, including recipe books, calendars, and trade cards.&lt;ref&gt;''J Hist Dent.'' 2000 Nov;48(3):99–105&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1911 the [[American Medical Association]] issued a publication titled "Nostrums And Quackery" in which, in a section called "Baby Killers", it incriminated Mrs. Winslow's Soothing Syrup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/nostrumsquackery00amerrich |title=Nostrums and Quackery; Articles on the Nostrum Evil and Quackery |year=1911 |location=Chicago, IL. |website=Internet Archive |publisher=American Medical Association |page=318}}&lt;/ref&gt; The product was nevertheless not withdrawn from sale until 1930.{{r|WoodLibrary}}

In 1879 the English composer [[Edward Elgar]] wrote an early musical work, part of his ''Harmony Music'' for a wind quintet, which he titled ''Mrs. Winslow's soothing syrup''. In Woody Guthrie's 1940 Dustbowl Ballad, "Tom Joad", Grandpa Joad is given soothing syrup before he dies.{{r|Guthrie}}

'''Neo-Nazism''' consists of post-[[World War II]] militant social or political movements seeking to revive and implement the ideology of [[Nazism]]. Neo-Nazis seek to employ their ideology to promote hatred and attack minorities, or in some cases to create a fascist political state.&lt;ref&gt;Gay, Kathlyn (1997) [https://books.google.com/books?id=NWYLkF5NHVsC&amp;q=%22Neo-nazis%22+goals&amp;dq=%22Neo-nazis%22+goals&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi3pYzk05raAhXjT98KHehxDawQ6AEINTAC ''Neo-Nazis: A Growing Threat'']. Enslow. p.114. {{isbn|9780894909016}}. Quote: "Neo-Nazis ... use fear and violence in their efforts to destroy minorities. Their goal is to '''''establish''''' a "superior" society."(emphasis added)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Staff (ndg) [https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/ideology/neo-nazi "Ideologies: Neo Nazi"] [[Southern Poverty Law Center]]. Quote: "While some neo-Nazi groups emphasize simple hatred, others are more focused on the revolutionary '''''creation of a fascist political state'''''." (emphasis added)&lt;/ref&gt; It is a global phenomenon, with organized representation in many countries and international networks. It borrows elements from Nazi doctrine, including [[ultranationalism]], [[racism]], [[xenophobia]], [[ableism]], [[homophobia]], [[anti-Romanyism]], [[antisemitism]], [[anti-communism]] and initiating the [[Fourth Reich]]. [[Holocaust denial]] is a common feature, as is the incorporation of [[Nazi symbolism|Nazi symbols]] and admiration of [[Adolf Hitler]].

In some [[Europe]]an and [[Latin America]]n countries, laws prohibit the expression of pro-Nazi, racist, anti-Semitic, or homophobic views. Many Nazi-related symbols are banned in European countries (especially [[Strafgesetzbuch_section_86a|Germany]]) in an effort to curtail neo-Nazism.&lt;ref&gt;

The term ''neo-Nazism'' can also refer to the [[ideology]] of these movements, which may borrow elements from Nazi doctrine, including [[ultranationalism]], [[anti-communism]], [[racism]], [[ableism]], [[xenophobia]], [[homophobia]], [[anti-Romanyism]], [[antisemitism]], up to initiating the [[Fourth Reich]]. [[Holocaust denial]] is a common feature, as is the incorporation of [[Nazi symbolism|Nazi symbols]] and admiration of [[Adolf Hitler]]. 

Neo-Nazism is considered a particular form of [[far-right politics]] and right-wing extremism.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.verfassungsschutz.de/en/fields-of-work/right-wing-extremism/what-is-right-wing-extremism What is right-wing extremism?] Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz, n.d., retrieved 4 December 2017 (in English) &lt;/ref&gt; 

===Hyperborean racial doctrine===
{{see also|Esoteric Nazism}}
Neo-Nazi writers have posited a spiritual, esoteric doctrine of [[Race (human categorization)|race]], which moves beyond the primarily [[Darwinian]]-inspired materialist [[scientific racism]] popular mainly in the [[Anglosphere]] during the 20th century. Figures influential in the development of neo-Nazi racism,{{cn|reason=Citation needed for 'influential in the development of neo-Nazi racism', as our only current cited source (Southern Poverty Law Center, 2015) presents them as influential on the 'bizarre fringes' of Nazism, but racism is central to Nazism, not just part of its fringe|date=October 2018}} such as [[Miguel Serrano]] and [[Julius Evola]] (writers who are described by critics of Nazism such as the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] as influential within what it presents as parts of "the bizarre fringes of National Socialism, past and present"),&lt;ref name=2015-02-08&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2002/new-book-black-sun-looks-fringes-national-socialism|publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center|title=New Book, Black Sun, Looks at Fringes of National Socialism|date=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; claim that the [[Hyperborean]] ancestors of the [[Aryans]] were in the distant past, far higher beings than their current state, having suffered from "involution" due to mixing with the "Telluric" peoples; supposed creations of the [[Demiurge]]. Within this theory, if the "Aryans" are to return to the [[Golden Age]] of the distant past, they need to awaken the memory of the blood. An [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] origin of the Hyperboreans is often claimed. These theories draw influence from [[Gnosticism]] and [[Tantrism]], building on the work of the [[Ahnenerbe]]. Within this racist theory, Jews are held up as the antithesis of nobility, purity and beauty.

===Ecology and environmentalism===
Neo-Nazism generally aligns itself with a [[blood and soil]] variation of [[environmentalism]], which has themes in common with [[deep ecology]], the [[organic movement]] and [[animal protectionism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dw.com/en/neo-nazis-cloak-themselves-in-eco-rhetoric/a-15793310|publisher=DW|title=Neo-Nazis cloak themselves in eco-rhetoric|date=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.redpepper.org.uk/darker-shades-of-green/|publisher=Red Pepper|title=Darker Shades of Green|date=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This tendency, sometimes called "[[ecofascism]]", was represented in the original German National Socialism by [[Richard Walther Darré]] who was the [[Reichsminister of Food]] from 1933 until 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spunk.org/texts/places/germany/sp001630/peter.html|publisher=Peter Staudenmaier|title=Fascist Ecology: The "Green Wing" of the Nazi Party and its Historical Antecedents|date=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
=== Germany and Austria 1945–1950s===
Following the defeat of [[Nazi Germany]], the political ideology of the ruling party, Nazism, was in complete disarray. The final leader of the [[Nazi Party|National Socialist German Workers' Party]] was [[Martin Bormann]]. He died on 2 May 1945 during the [[Battle of Berlin]], but the [[Soviet Union]] did not reveal his death to the rest of the world, and his ultimate fate remained a mystery for many years. [[Conspiracy theories about Adolf Hitler's death|Conspiracy theories]] emerged about Hitler himself, that he had secretly survived the war and fled to South America or elsewhere.

The [[Allied Control Council]] officially dissolved the NSDAP on 10 October 1945, marking the end of "Old" National Socialism. A process of [[denazification]] began, and the [[Nuremberg trials]] took place, where many major leaders and ideologues were condemned to death by October 1946, others committed suicide.

[[File:Otto Ernst Remer portrait.JPG|thumb|right|175px|It[[Otto Ernst Remer]], leader of the postwar [[Socialist Reich Party]]]]

In both the East and West, surviving ex-party members and military veterans assimilated to the new reality and had no interest in constructing a "neo-Nazism."{{cn|date=December 2017}} However, during the [[West German federal election, 1949|1949 elections]] a number of National Socialist advocates such as [[Fritz Rössler]] had infiltrated the national conservative ''[[Deutsche Rechtspartei]]'', which had 5 members elected. Rössler and others left to found the more radical [[Socialist Reich Party]] under [[Otto Ernst Remer]]. At the onset of the [[Cold War]], the SRP favoured the Soviet Union over the United States.&lt;ref name="remer"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ihr.org/jhr/v10/v10p108_Schoeman.html|publisher=[[Institute for Historical Review]]|title=An Interview With General Otto Ernst Remer|date=8 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[Austria]] national independence had been restored, and the ''[[Verbotsgesetz 1947]]'' explicitly criminalised the NSDAP and any attempt at restoration. 
West Germany adopted a similar law to target parties it defined as anti-constitutional; Article 21 Paragraph 2 in the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|Basic Law]], banning the Socialist Reich Party in 1952 for being opposed to [[liberal democracy]].

As a consequence some members of the nascent movement of German neo-Nazism joined the ''[[Deutsche Reichspartei]]'' of which [[Hans-Ulrich Rudel]] was the most prominent figure. Younger members founded the ''[[Wiking-Jugend]]'' modeled after the [[Hitler Youth]]. The ''Deutsche Reichspartei'' stood for elections from 1953 until 1961 fetching around 1% of the vote each time.{{cn|date=December 2017}} Rudel befriended French-born [[Savitri Devi]], who was a proponent of [[Esoteric Nazism]]. In the 1950s she wrote a number of books, such as ''[[Pilgrimage (book)|Pilgrimage]]'' (1958), which concerns prominent Third Reich sites, and ''[[The Lightning and the Sun]]'' (1958), in which she claims that Adolf Hitler was an avatar of the God [[Vishnu]]. She was not alone in this reorientation of National Socialism towards its [[Thule Society|Thulean]]-roots; the ''[[Artgemeinschaft]]'', founded by former SS member Wilhelm Kusserow, attempted to promote a new [[paganism]].{{cn|date=December 2017}} 
In the [[German Democratic Republic]] a former member of [[Sturmabteilung|SA]], [[Wilhelm Adam]], founded the [[National Democratic Party of Germany (East Germany)]]. It reached out to those attracted by the Nazi Party before 1945 and provide them with a political outlet, so that they would not be tempted to support the far-right again or turn to the anti-communist Western Allies.{{cn|date=December 2017}} Stalin wanted to use them to create a new pro-Soviet and anti-Western strain in German politics.{{cn|date=December 2017}} According to top Soviet diplomat Vladimir Semyonov, Stalin even suggested that they could be allowed to continue publishing their own newspaper, [[Völkischer Beobachter]]. While in Austria, former SS member Wilhelm Lang founded an esoteric group known as the [[Landig Group|Vienna Lodge]]; he popularised [[nazism and occultism]] such as the [[Black Sun (occult symbol)|Black Sun]] and ideas of Third Reich survival colonies below the polar ice caps.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

With the onset of the [[Cold War]] the allied forces had lost interest in prosecuting anyone as part of the denazification.&lt;ref name="Evans-2008"&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv |last=Evans |first=Richard J. |authorlink=Richard J. Evans |year=2008 |title=The Third Reich at War |series=The Third Reich Trilogy |publisher=Penguin Books |pages=747–748 |isbn=978-0-14-311671-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1950s this new political environment allowed [[Otto Strasser]], an NS activist on the left of the NSDAP, who had founded the [[Black Front]] to return from exile. In 1956, Strasser founded the [[German Social Union (West Germany)|German Social Union]] as a Black Front successor, promoting a [[Strasserite]] "nationalist and socialist" policy, which dissolved in 1962 due to lack of support. Other Third Reich associated groups were the [[HIAG]] and [[Stille Hilfe]] dedicated to advancing the interests of [[Waffen-SS]] veterans and rehabilitating them into the new democratic society. However, they did not claim to be attempting to restore National Socialism, instead working with the [[social democrats]] and [[Christian democrats]].

Many bureaucrats who served under the Third Reich continued to serve in German administration after the war. According to the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]], many of the more than 90,000 Nazi war criminals recorded in German files were serving in positions of prominence under Chancellor [[Konrad Adenauer]].&lt;ref name="Simon Wiesenthal Center"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wiesenthal.com/site/pp.asp?c=lsKWLbPJLnF&amp;b=4441293 |title=About Simon Wiesenthal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |year=2013 |website=Simon Wiesenthal Center |accessdate=17 November 2013 |at=Section 11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hartmann"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sopos.org/aufsaetze/4bdfd55e42f57/1.phtml |title=Der Alibiprozeß |publisher=Ossietzky 9/2010 |work=Den Aufsatz kommentieren |year=2010 |accessdate=19 November 2013 |last=Hartmann |first=Ralph |language=German |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202222254/http://www.sopos.org/aufsaetze/4bdfd55e42f57/1.phtml |archivedate=2 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Not until the 1960s were the former concentration camp personnel prosecuted by [[West Germany]] in the [[Belzec trial]], [[Frankfurt Auschwitz trials]], [[Treblinka trials]], [[Chełmno trials]], and the [[Sobibór trial]].&lt;ref name="Rückerl-1972"&gt;{{Cite book |ref=harv |last=Rückerl |first=Adalbert |year=1972 |title=NS-Prozesse |publisher=Verlag C F Muller |location=Karlsruhe, Germany |url=https://books.google.com/?id=K23zAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Adalbert+R%C3%BCckerl%2C+NS-Prozesse.+Verlag+C+F+Muller%2C+1972&amp;q=Treblinka |accessdate=8 September 2013 |quote=Adalbert Rückerl, head of the Central Bureau for the Prosecution of National Socialist Crimes observed that because of the 1968 Dreher's amendment (§ 50 StGB), 90% of all Nazi war criminals in Germany enjoyed total immunity from prosecution. |page=132 |isbn=9783788020156 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the government had passed laws prohibiting National Socialists from publicly expressing their beliefs.

==="Universal National Socialism", 1950s–1970s===
Neo-Nazism found expression outside of Germany, including in countries who fought against the Third Reich during the Second World War, and sometimes adopted Pan-European or "Universal" characteristics, beyond the parameters of [[German nationalism]].{{cn|date=December 2017}} The two main tendencies, with differing styles and even worldviews, were the followers of the American [[Francis Parker Yockey]], who was fundamentally anti-American and advocated for a [[Pan-European nationalism]] and those of [[George Lincoln Rockwell]] an [[American conservative]].&lt;ref group= "nb"&gt;Some of the fascistic old-guard from the pre-war ultra-nationalist movements were more skeptical of the benefits of the Rockwell-Jordan uniform scene. [[Oswald Mosley]] of the [[Union Movement]] described Jordan as, "a midget trying to walk in the boots of giants." Meanwhile, Yockeyism leaned more to the left than the "official" fascistic Pan-Europeanism of those which would become the [[European Social Movement]]. The latter associated with Mosley, [[Maurice Bardèche]] and others upheld a strictly "neither East, nor West", third position in regards to Soviet and American power.&lt;/ref&gt;{{cn|date=December 2017}}

Yockey, a neo-Spenglerian author, had written ''Imperium: The Philosophy of History and Politics'' (1949) dedicated to "the hero of the twentieth century" (namely, Adolf Hitler) and founded the [[European Liberation Front]]. He was interested more in the destiny of Europe; to this end, he advocated a [[National Bolshevik]]-esque [[Red–green–brown alliance|red-brown alliance]] against [[American culture]] and influenced 1960s figures such as SS-veteran [[Jean-François Thiriart]]. Yockey was also fond of [[Arab nationalism]], in particular [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], as well as this he saw [[Fidel Castro]]'s  [[Cuban Revolution]] as a positive and visited officials there. Yockey's views impressed Otto Ernst Remer and the radical traditionalist philosopher [[Julius Evola]]. He was constantly hounded by the [[FBI]] and was eventually arrested in 1960, before committing suicide. Domestically, Yockey's biggest sympathisers were the [[National Renaissance Party (United States)|National Renaissance Party]], including [[James H. Madole]], [[H. Keith Thompson]] and [[Eustace Mullins]] (''protégé'' of [[Ezra Pound]]) and the [[Liberty Lobby]] of [[Willis Carto]].{{cn|date=December 2017}}

Rockwell, an American conservative, was first politicised by [[anti-communism]] and opposed to [[racial integration]], before becoming [[anti-Jewish]]. In response to his opponents calling him a "Nazi", he theatrically appropriated the aesthetic elements of the NSDAP, to "own" the intended insult. In 1959, Rockwell founded the [[American Nazi Party]] and instructed his members to dress in imitation [[Sturmabteilung|SA]]-style brown shirts, while flying the flag of the Third Reich. In contrast to Yockey, he was pro-American and cooperated with FBI requests, despite the party being targeted under [[COINTELPRO]] due to the mistaken belief that they were agents of Nasser's Egypt during a brief intelligence "brown scare."&lt;ref group= "nb"&gt;While the intelligence claims in regards to the Rockwell's American costume group proved unfounded, a number of actual German National Socialists did relocate to the Middle East, some conveted to Islam and changed their names; particularly Egypt and Syria. This includes [[Johann von Leers]], [[Alois Brunner]], [[Aribert Heim]], [[Franz Stangl]], [[Gerhard Mertins]], [[Hans Eisele (physician)|Hans Eisele]], [[Walter Rauff]], [[Artur Schmitt]] and others. The father of Neo-Nazism, Otto Ernst Remer, also fled to Egypt, then Syria during the 1950s.&lt;/ref&gt; Later leaders of American [[white nationalism]] came to politics through the ANP; including a teenage [[David Duke]] and [[William Luther Pierce]] of the [[National Alliance (United States)|National Alliance]], although they soon distanced themselves from explicit self-identification with neo-Nazism.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

[[File:Flag of Ordine Nuovo.svg|thumb|right|175px|The Italian group [[Ordine Nuovo]], banned in 1974, drew influence from the [[Waffen-SS]] and [[Traditionalist School|Guénonian Traditionalism]] via [[Julius Evola]].]]
[[File:Flag of the Order of Flemish Militants.svg|thumb|right|175px|The radicalisation of Flemish activist group the [[Vlaamse Militanten Orde]] in the 1970s, energised international neo-Nazism.]]

In 1961,  the [[World Union of National Socialists]] was founded by Rockwell and [[Colin Jordan]] of the British [[National Socialist Movement (UK, 1962)|National Socialist Movement]], adopting the ''[[Cotswold Declaration]].'' French socialite [[Françoise Dior]] was involved romantically with Jordan and his deputy [[John Tyndall (politician)|John Tyndall]] and  a friend of Savitri Devi, who also attended the meeting. The National Socialist Movement wore quasi-SA uniforms,  was involved in streets conflicts with the Jewish [[62 Group]]. In the 1970s, Tyndall's earlier involvement with neo-Nazism would come back to haunt the [[National Front (UK)|National Front]], which he led, as they attempted to ride a wave of anti-immigration populism and concerns over British national decline. Televised exposes on ''[[This Week (Thames Television TV series)|This Week]]'' in 1974 and ''[[World in Action]]'' in 1978, showed their neo-Nazi pedigree and damaged their electoral chances. In 1967, Rockwell was killed by a disgruntled former member. [[Matthias Koehl]] took control of the ANP, and strongly influenced by Savitri Devi, gradually transformed it into an esoteric group known as the [[New Order (Neo-Nazi group)|New Order]].{{cn|date=December 2017}}

In [[Franco's Spain]], certain SS refugees most notably [[Otto Skorzeny]], [[Léon Degrelle]] and the son of [[Klaus Barbie]] became associated with [[CEDADE]] (''Círculo Español de Amigos de Europa''), an organisation which disseminated Third Reich apologetics out of [[Barcelona]]. They intersected with neo-Nazi advocates from [[Mark Fredriksen]] in France to [[Salvador Borrego]] in [[Mexico]]. 
In the post-fascist [[Italian Social Movement]] splinter groups such as [[Ordine Nuovo]] and [[Avanguardia Nazionale]], involved in the "[[Years of Lead (Italy)|Years of Lead]]" considered National Socialism a reference. [[Franco Freda]] created a "Nazi-[[Maoist]]" synthesis. 

In Germany itself, the various Third Reich nostalgic movements coalesced around the [[National Democratic Party of Germany]] in 1964 and in Austria the [[National Democratic Party (Austria, 1967–88)|National Democratic Party]] in 1967 as the primary sympathisers of the NSDAP past, although more publicly cautious than earlier groups.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

===Holocaust denial and subcultures, 1970s–1990s===
[[Holocaust denial]], the claim that [[the Holocaust|six million Jews]] were not deliberately and systematically exterminated as an official policy of the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]] and [[Adolf Hitler]], became a more prominent feature of neo-Nazism in the 1970s. Before this time, Holocaust denial had long existed as a sentiment among neo-Nazis, but it had not yet been systematically articulated as a theory with a bibliographical canon. Few of the major theorists of Holocaust denial (who call themselves "[[Historical revisionism|revisionists]]") can be uncontroversially classified as outright neo-Nazis (though some works such as those of [[David Irving]] forward a clearly sympathetic view of Hitler and the publisher [[Ernst Zündel]] was deeply tied to international neo-Nazism), however, the main interest of Holocaust denial to neo-Nazis was their hope that it would help them rehabilitate their political [[ideology]] in the eyes of the general public. ''[[Did Six Million Really Die?]]'' (1974) by [[Richard Verrall]] and ''[[The Hoax of the Twentieth Century]]'' (1976) by [[Arthur Butz]] are popular examples of Holocaust denial material.

Key developments in international neo-Nazism during this time include the radicalisation of the ''[[Vlaamse Militanten Orde]]'' under former [[Hitler Youth]] member [[Bert Eriksson]]. They began hosting an annual conference; the "Iron Pilgrimage"; at [[Diksmuide]], which drew kindred ideologues from across Europe and beyond. As well as this, the [[NSDAP/AO (1972)|NSDAP/AO]] under [[Gary Lauck]] arose in the United States in 1972 and challenged the international influence of the Rockwellite WUNS. Lauck's organisation drew support from the [[National Socialist Movement of Denmark]] of [[Povl Riis-Knudsen]] and various German and Austrian figures who felt that the "National Democratic" parties were too bourgeois and insufficiently National Socialist in orientation. This included [[Michael Kühnen]], [[Christian Worch]], [[Bela Ewald Althans]] and [[Gottfried Küssel]] of the 1977-founded  [[Action Front of National Socialists/National Activists|ANS/NS]] which called for the establishment of a Germanic [[Fourth Reich]]. Some ANS/NS members were imprisoned for planning paramilitary attacks on [[NATO]] bases in Germany and planning to liberate [[Rudolf Hess]] from [[Spandau Prison]]. The organisation was officially banned in 1983 by the Minister of the Interior.

During the late 1970s, a British subculture came to be associated with neo-Nazism; the [[skinheads]]. Portraying an ultra-masculine, crude and aggressive image, with working-class references, some of the skinheads joined the [[British Movement]] under [[Michael McLaughlin]] (successor of [[Colin Jordan]]), while others became associated with the National Front's [[Rock Against Communism]] project which was meant to counter the [[Socialist Workers Party (UK)|SWP]]'s [[Rock Against Racism]]. The most significant music group involved in this project was [[Skrewdriver]], led by [[Ian Stuart Donaldson]]. Together with ex-BM member [[Nicky Crane]], Donaldson founded the international [[Blood &amp; Honour]] network in 1987. By 1992 this network, with input from [[Harold Covington]], had developed a paramilitary wing; [[Combat 18]], which intersected with [[football hooligan]] firms such as the [[Chelsea Headhunters]]. The neo-Nazi skinhead movement spread to the United States, with groups such as the [[Hammerskins]]. It was popularised from 1986 onwards by [[Tom Metzger]] of the [[White Aryan Resistance]]. Since then it has spread across the world. Films such as ''[[Romper Stomper]]'' (1992) and ''[[American History X]]'' (1998) would fix a public perception that [[white power skinheads|neo-Nazism and skinheads]] were synonymous.

[[Image:Black_Sun_2.svg|thumb|175px|left|Serrano identified Aryan-Hyperborean blood as the "light of the [[Black Sun (occult symbol)|Black Sun]]", a symbol found at SS-cult site [[Wewelsburg|Wewelsburg Castle]].]]

New developments also emerged on the esoteric level, as former Chilean diplomat [[Miguel Serrano]] built on the works of [[Carl Jung]], [[Otto Rahn]], [[Wilhelm Landig]], [[Julius Evola]] and [[Savitri Devi]] to bind together and develop already existing theories. Serrano had been a member of the [[National Socialist Movement of Chile]] in the 1930s and from the early days of neo-Nazism he had been in contact with key figures across Europe and beyond. Despite this, he was able to work as an ambassador to numerous countries until the rise of [[Salvador Allende]]. In 1984 he published his book ''Adolf Hitler: The Ultimate Avatar''. Serrano claimed that the Aryans were extragalactic beings who founded [[Hyperborea]] and lived the heroic life of [[Bodhisattvas]], while the [[Jews]] were created by the [[Demiurge]] and were concerned only with coarse [[materialism]]. Serrano claimed that a new [[Golden Age]] can be attained if the Hyperboreans repurify their blood (supposedly the light of the Black Sun) and restore their "[[Genetic memory (psychology)|blood-memory]]." As with Savitri Devi before him, Serrano's works became a key point of reference in neo-Nazism.

===Lifting of the Iron Curtain, 1990s–present===
With the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] and the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]] during the early 1990s, neo-Nazism began to spread its ideas in the East, as hostility to the triumphant liberal order was high and [[revanchism]] a widespread feeling. In Russia, during the chaos of the early 1990s, an amorphous mixture of [[KGB]] hardliners, Orthodox neo-Tsarist nostalgics (i.e. - [[Pamyat]]) and explicit National Socialists found themselves strewn together in the same camp. They were united by opposition to the influence of the United States, against the liberalising legacy of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s ''[[perestroika]]'' and on the [[Jewish question]], [[Soviet Anti-Zionism|Soviet Zionology]] merged with a more explicit anti-Jewish sentiment. The most significant organisation representing this was [[Russian National Unity]] under the leadership of [[Alexander Barkashov]], where black-uniform clad Russians marched with a red flag incorporating the [[Swastika]] under the banner of ''[[Russia for Russians]].'' These forces came together in a last gasp effort to save the [[Supreme Soviet of Russia]] against [[Boris Yeltsin]] during the [[1993 Russian constitutional crisis]]. As well as events in Russia, in newly independent ex-Soviet states, annual commemorations for SS volunteers now took place; particularly in [[Remembrance day of the Latvian legionnaires|Latvia]], [[20th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (1st Estonian)|Estonia]] and the [[14th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (1st Galician)|Ukraine]].

[[Image:Evstafiev-neo-bolsheviks.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Members of the [[National Bolshevik Party]]. The Nazbols tailored ultra-nationalist themes to a native Russian environment, while still flirting with National Socialist aesthetics.]]

The Russian developments excited German neo-Nazism who dreamed of a [[Berlin]]—[[Moscow]] alliance against the supposedly "decadent" [[Atlanticist]] forces; a dream which had been thematic since the days of Remer.&lt;ref name="remer"/&gt; Zündel visited Russia and met with Russian National Unity luminaries such as ex-KGB general Aleksandr Stergilov. Despite these initial aspirations, international neo-Nazism and its close affiliates in ultra-nationalism would be split over the [[Bosnian War]] between 1992 and 1995, as part of the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]]. The split would largely be along ethnic and sectarian lines. The Germans and the French would largely back the Western Catholic [[Croats]] (Lauck's NSDAP/AO explicitly [[Foreign fighters in the Bosnian War|called for volunteers]], which Kühnen's [[Free German Workers' Party]] answered and the French formed the "Groupe [[Jacques Doriot]]"), while the Russians and the Greeks would back the Orthodox [[Serbs]] (including Russians from Barkashov's Russian National Unity, [[Eduard Limonov]]'s [[National Bolshevik Party|National Bolshevik Front]] and [[Golden Dawn (political party)|Golden Dawn]] members joined the [[Greek Volunteer Guard]]). Indeed, the revival of [[National Bolshevism]] was able to steal some of the thunder from overt Russian neo-Nazism, as ultra-nationalism was wedded with veneration of [[Joseph Stalin]] in place of Adolf Hitler, while still also flirting with National Socialist aesthetics.

==Analogous European movements==
Outside Germany, in other countries which were involved with the [[Axis powers]] and had their own native ultra-nationalist movements, which sometimes collaborated with the Third Reich but were not technically German-style National Socialists, revivalist and nostalgic movements have emerged in the post-war period which, as neo-Nazism has done in Germany, seek to rehabilitate their various loosely associated ideologies. These movements include [[neo-fascists]] and [[post-fascists]] in Italy; Vichyites, Pétainists and "national Europeans" in France; [[Ustaše]] sympathisers in [[Croatia]]; neo-[[Chetniks]] in [[Serbia]]; [[Iron Guard]] revivalists in [[Romania]]; [[Hungarists]] and [[Miklós Horthy|Horthyists]] in [[Hungary]]; [[Stepan Bandera|Banderaists]] in the [[Ukraine]] (which had a complicated relationship with the Axis powers) and others.

===Italy===
[[File:Junio Valerio Borghese.jpg|thumb|187px|The nearest Italy came to returning to [[fascism]] was the 1970 [[Golpe Borghese]] of commando veteran [[Junio Valerio Borghese]].]]

Following the last stand of [[Italian fascism]] with the German-supported [[Italian Social Republic]] towards the end of the Second World War, those elements within Italian society which remained loyal to the legacy of [[Benito Mussolini]] and fascism (especially veterans of the [[National Republican Army]]), rejecting both the [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Catholic]] and [[Italian Communist Party|Communist]] alternatives prominent in mainstream Italian politics, founded the [[Italian Social Movement]] in 1946 under [[Giorgio Almirante]]. The MSI was regarded as the successor of the [[National Fascist Party]] and the [[Republican Fascist Party]]. The motto of the party was "not repudiate, not restore", indicating a more moderate parliamentary democratic [[neo-fascism]], which did not heap scorn on the recent past. Italian society did not undergo a process as extensive as the post-war Denazification campaign in occupied Germany, partly due to the [[Cold War]] and the Western Allies not wanting Italy to move towards the [[Warsaw Pact]] (which was not an [[Popular Democratic Front (Italy)|impossibility at the time]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Alessandra Kersevan]]2008: (Editor) Foibe - Revisionismo di stato e amnesie della repubblica.

The Italian Social Movement held a similar position in Italian politics that the [[National Democratic Party of Germany]] did in Germany; careful enough to stay within the laws of the new democratic state, but still clearly identified with the Axis legacy. During the 1950s, the MSI moved closer to bourgeois conservative politics on the domestic front, which led to radical youths founding hardline splinter groups, such as [[Pino Rauti]]'s [[Ordine Nuovo]] (later succeeded by [[Ordine Nero]]) and  [[Stefano Delle Chiaie]]'s [[National Vanguard (Italy)|Avanguardia Nazionale]]. These organisations were influenced by the esotericism of [[Julius Evola]] and considered the Waffen-SS and Romanian leader [[Corneliu Zelea Codreanu]] a reference, moving beyond Italian fascism. They were implicated in [[Years of Lead (Italy)|paramiliary attacks]] during the late 1960s to the early 1980s, such as the [[Piazza Fontana bombing]]. Delle Chiaie had even assisted [[Junio Valerio Borghese]] in a failed 1970 coup attempt known as the [[Golpe Borghese]], which attempted to reinstate a fascist state in Italy.

During the late 1980s and early 1990s, the Italian Social Movement under the leadership of [[Gianfranco Fini]] moved closer to conservative politics, adopting a "post-fascist" position. This was opposed by the fascist element under Rauti who created [[Fiamma Tricolore]] in 1995. The party was dissolved under Fini in 1995, who replaced it with the [[National Alliance (Italy)|National Alliance]]. This party rapidly moved away from any connection to the fascist past, towards the center-right in coalition with [[Silvio Berlusconi]]'s [[Forza Italia]]. The two parties merged in 2009 to become [[The People of Freedom]]. [[Alessandra Mussolini]], troubled by Fini's explicit condemnation of her grandfather broke with the AN to found [[Social Action]]. Aside from Fiamma Tricolore, the other extant neo-fascist groups in Italy are [[New Force (Italy)|Forza Nuova]], the [[National Social Front|Fronte Nazionale]], [[Social Idea Movement|Movimento Idea Sociale]] (another Rauti creation) and the cultural ''[[CasaPound]]'' project. In terms of current size, they are mostly negligible.

[[File:Celtic-style crossed circle.svg|thumb|175px|French neo-fascist groups adopted the [[Celtic cross]] as an ambiguous "Christian and pagan" symbol since the 1940s.|left]]

In France, the most enthusiastic collaborationists during the [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|German occupation of France]] had been the [[National Popular Rally]] of [[Marcel Déat]] (former [[French Section of the Workers' International|SFIO]] members) and the [[French Popular Party]] of [[Jacques Doriot]] (former [[French Communist Party]] members). These two groups, like the Germans, saw themselves as combining ultra-nationalism and [[socialism]]. In the south there existed the vassal state of [[Vichy France]] under the military "Hero of the Verdun", Marshal [[Philippe Pétain]] whose ''[[Révolution nationale]]'' emphasised an authoritarian Catholic conservative politics. Following the [[liberation of France]] and the creation of the [[Fourth French Republic]], collaborationists were prosecuted during the ''[[épuration légale]]'' and nearly 800 put to death for treason under [[Charles de Gaulle]].

In the aftermath of the Second World War, the main concern of the French radical right was the collapse of the [[French colonial empire|French Empire]], in particular the [[Algerian War]], which led to the creation of the [[Organisation armée secrète|OAS]]. Outside of this, individual fascistic activists such as [[Maurice Bardèche]] (brother-in-law of [[Robert Brasillach]]), as well as SS-veterans [[Marc Augier|Saint-Loup]] and [[René Binet (neo-Fascist)|René Binet]],  were active in France and involved in the [[European Social Movement]] and later the [[New European Order]], alongside similar groups from across Europe. Early neo-fascist groups included [[Jeune Nation]], which introduced the [[Celtic cross]] into use by radical right groups (an association which would spread internationally). A "neither East, nor West" pan-Europeanism was most popular among French fascistic activists until the late 1960s, partly motivated by feelings of national vulnerability following the collapse of their empire; thus the Belgian SS-veteran [[Jean-François Thiriart]]'s group [[Jeune Europe]] also had a considerable French contingent.

It was the 1960s, during the [[Fifth French Republic]], that a considerable upturn in French neo-fascism occurred; some of it in response to the [[Protests of 1968]]. The most explicitly pro-Nazi of these was the [[Fédération d'action nationale et européenne|FANE]] of [[Mark Fredriksen]]. Neo-fascist groups included [[Pierre Sidos]]' [[Occident (movement)|Occident]], the [[Ordre Nouveau (1960s)|Ordre Nouveau]] (which was banned after violent clashes with the Trotskyist [[Revolutionary Communist League (France)|LCR]]) and the student-based [[Groupe Union Défense]]. A number of these activists such as [[François Duprat]] were instrumental in founding the [[National Front (France)|Front National]] under [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]]; but the FN also included a broader selection from the French hard-right, including not only these neo-fascist elements, but also [[Integrism|Catholic integrists]], monarchists, Algerian War veterans, [[Poujadists]] and national-conservatives. Others from these neo-fascist micro-groups formed the [[Parti des forces nouvelles]] working against Le Pen.

Within the FN itself, Duprat founded the FANE-backed [[Revolutionary Nationalist Groups|Groupes nationalistes révolutionnaires]] faction, until his 1978 assassination. The subsequent history of the French hard right has been the conflict between the national-conservative controlled FN and "national revolutionary" (fascistic and National Bolshevik) splinter or opposition groups. The latter include groups in the tradition of Thiriart and Duprat, such as the [[Parti communautaire national-européen]], [[Troisième voie]], the [[Nouvelle Résistance]] of [[Christian Bouchet]],&lt;ref name=Banquet&gt;[http://www.revue-lebanquet.com/docs/a_0000362.html Stratégies et pratiques du mouvement nationaliste-révolutionnaire français : départs, desseins et destin d'Unité Radicale (1989–2002)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929082901/http://www.revue-lebanquet.com/docs/a_0000362.html |date=29 September 2007 }}, ''Le Banquet,'' n°19, 2004 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Unité Radicale]] and most recently [[Bloc identitaire]].

===Hungary===
[[File:Becsület napja 1997-02-15.jpg|thumb|250px|"Hungaria Skins" with a flag evoking the Arrow Cross in 1997.|left]]

In Hungary, the historical political party which allied itself ideologically with German National Socialism and drew inspiration from it, was the [[Arrow Cross Party]] of [[Ferenc Szálasi]]. They referred to themselves explicitly as National Socialists and within Hungarian politics this tendency is known as [[Hungarism]].{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} After the Second World War, exiles such as [[Árpád Henney]] kept the Hungarist tradition alive. Following the fall of the [[Hungarian People's Republic]] in 1989, which was a [[Marxist-Leninist]] state and a member of the [[Warsaw Pact]], many new parties emerged. Amongst these was the [[Hungarian National Front]] of [[István Győrkös]], which was a Hungarist party and considered itself the heirs of Arrow Cross-style National Socialism (a self-description they explicitly embraced);{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} it forged links with [[Gottfried Küssel]] and the NSDAP/AO.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} In the 2000s, Győrkös' movement moved closer to a [[national communist]] and [[neo-Eurasian]] position, aligned with [[Aleksandr Dugin]], cooperating with the [[Hungarian Workers' Party]]. Some Hungarists opposed this and founded the [[Pax Hungarica Movement]]. 

In modern Hungary, the ultranationalist [[Jobbik]] is regarded by some scholars as a neo-Nazi party; for example, it has been termed as such by [[Randolph L. Braham]].&lt;ref&gt;Randolph L. Braham, "Hungary: The Assault on the Historical Memory of the Holocaust" in ''The Holocaust in Hungary: Seventy Years Later'' (eds. Randolph L. Braham &amp; András Kovács:  Central European University Press, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; The party denies being neo-Nazi, although "there is extensive proof that the leading members of the party made no effort to hide their racism and anti-Semitism."&lt;ref name="Spectrum"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://hungarianspectrum.org/2013/04/08/jobbik-is-not-a-neo-nazi-party-at-least-not-according-to-a-hungarian-judge/|publisher=Hungarian Spectrum|title=Jobbik is not a neo-Nazi party. At least not according to a Hungarian judge|work=Hungarian Spectrum|date=8 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rudolf Paksa, a scholar of the Hungarian far right, describes Jobbik as "anti-Semitic, racist, homophobic and chauvinistic" but not as neo-Nazi because it does not pursue the establishment of a totalitarian regime.&lt;ref name="Spectrum"/&gt; Historian [[Krisztián Ungváry]] writes that "It is safe to say that certain messages of Jobbik can be called open neo-Nazi propaganda. However, it is quite certain that the popularity of the party is not due to these statements."&lt;ref&gt;Krisztián Ungváry, "'One Camp, One Banner': How Fidesz Views History" in ''Twenty-Five Sides of a Post-Communist Mafia State'' (ed. Balint Magyar &amp; Julia Vasarhelyi: Central European University Press, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Romania===
In Romania, the ultra-nationalist movement which allied itself with the [[Axis powers]] and German National Socialism was the [[Iron Guard]], also known as the Legion of the Archangel Michael. There are some modern political organisations which consider themselves heirs of Legionarism, this includes [[Noua Dreaptă]] and the [["Everything For the Country" Party]], founded by former Iron Guard members. The latter organisation was outlawed in 2015. Aside, from these Romanian organisations, the [[Sixty-Four Counties Youth Movement]] representing ultra-nationalism from the Hungarian minority is also present, especially in [[Transylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Luiza Ilie |url= https://www.reuters.com/article/us-romania-prosecutors-blast-idUSKBN0TK4YD20151201 |title=Romanian prosecutors arrest suspect for attempted blast |newspaper=Reuters |accessdate=2016-02-26|date= December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other nationalistic and irridentist groups such as the [[Greater Romania Party]] do not originate from Legionarism, but in fact grew out of [[national communist]] tendencies from the era of [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]] (the party was founded by his "court poet" [[Corneliu Vadim Tudor]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Markéta Smrčková |url=http://www.cepsr.com/clanek.php?ID=360 |title=Comparison of Radical Right-Wing Parties in Bulgaria and Romania |publisher=Central European Political Studies Review |accessdate=2016-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues==
===Ex-Nazis in mainstream politics===
[[Image:Kurt Waldheim 1971b.jpg|thumb|right|187px|The 1980s dispute between Austrian president [[Kurt Waldheim]] and the [[World Jewish Congress]] caused an international incident.]]

The most significant case on an international level was the election of [[Kurt Waldheim]] to the Presidency of Austria in 1986. It came to light that Waldheim had been a member of the [[National Socialist German Students' League]], the SA and served as an intelligence officer during the Second World War. Following this he served as an Austrian diplomat and was the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]] from 1972 until 1981. After revelations of Waldheim's past were made by an Austrian journalist, Waldheim clashed with the [[World Jewish Congress]] on the international stage. Waldheim's record was defended by [[Bruno Kreisky]], an Austrian Jew who served as Chancellor of Austria. The legacy of the affair lingers on, as [[Victor Ostrovsky]] has claimed the [[Mossad]] doctored the file of Waldheim to implicate him in war crimes.

===Contemporary right-wing populism===
Some critics have sought to draw a connection between Nazism and modern [[right-wing populism]] in Europe, but the two are not widely regarded as interchangeable by most academics. In Austria, the [[Freedom Party of Austria]] (FPÖ) served as a shelter for ex-Nazis almost from its inception.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} In 1980, scandals undermined Austria's two main parties and the economy stagnated. [[Jörg Haider]] became leader of the FPÖ and offered partial justification for [[Nazism]], calling its employment policy effective. In the [[Austrian legislative election, 1994|1994 Austrian election]], the FPÖ won 22 percent of the vote, as well as 33 percent of the vote in [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]] and 22 percent in Vienna; showing that it had become a force capable of reversing the old pattern of Austrian politics.&lt;ref&gt;Laqueur, Walter, ''Fascism: Past, Present, Future'', pp. 80, 116, 117&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Walter Laqueur]] writes that even though Haider welcomed former Nazis at his meetings and went out of his way to address [[Schutzstaffel]] (SS) veterans, the FPÖ is not a fascist party in the traditional sense, since it has not made [[anti-communism]] an important issue, and it does not advocate the overthrow of the democratic order or the use of violence. In his view, the FPÖ is "not quite fascist", although it is part of a tradition, similar to that of 19th-century Viennese mayor [[Karl Lueger]], which involves [[nationalism]], xenophobic populism, and [[authoritarianism]].&lt;ref&gt;Laqueur, Walter, ''Fascism: Past, Present, Future'', p. 117-118&lt;/ref&gt; Haider, who in 2005 left the Freedom Party and formed the [[Alliance for Austria's Future]], was killed in a traffic accident in October 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7664846.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=Austria's Haider dies in accident | date=2008-10-11 | accessdate=2010-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Barbara Rosenkranz]], the Freedom Party's candidate for the [[Austrian presidential election, 2010]], is controversial for having made allegedly pro-Nazi statements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8634796.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=Austria spooked by Nazi past in election | date=2010-04-23 | accessdate=2010-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rosenkranz is married to [[Horst Rosenkranz]], a key member of a banned neo-Nazi party, who is known for publishing far-right books. Rosenkranz says she cannot detect anything "dishonourable" in her husband's activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/reich-mother-on-the-march-in-hitlers-homeland-1953005.html | work=The Independent | location=London | title=Reich mother on the march in Hitler's homeland | date=2010-04-24 | accessdate=2010-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|Bloed, Bodem, Eer en Trouw}}
A Belgian neo-Nazi organization, [[Bloed, Bodem, Eer en Trouw]] (Blood, Soil, Honour and Loyalty), was created in 2004 after splitting from the international network ([[Blood and Honour]]). The group rose to public prominence in September 2006, after 17 members (including 11 soldiers) were arrested under the December 2003 [[Anti-terrorism legislation|anti-terrorist laws]] and laws against [[racism]], [[antisemitism]] and supporters of [[censorship]]. According to Justice Minister [[Laurette Onkelinx]] and Interior Minister [[Patrick Dewael]], the suspects (11 of whom were members of the military) were preparing to launch terrorist attacks in order to "destabilize" [[Belgium]].&lt;ref&gt;

====Czech Republic====
The government of the [[Czech Republic]] strictly punishes neo-Nazism ([[Czech language|Czech]]: ''Neonacismus''). According to a report by the [[Ministry of the Interior of the Czech Republic]], neo-Nazis committed more than 211 crimes in 2013. The Czech Republic has various neo-Nazi groups. One of them is the group Wotan Jugend, based in Germany.

Following the failure of the [[National Democratic Party of Germany]] in the [[West German federal election, 1969|election of 1969]], small groups committed to the revival of Nazi ideology began to emerge in Germany.

The German intelligence services have been criticized for extravagant distributions of cash to informants within the far right movement. Tino Brandt publicly boasted on television that he had received around €100,000 in funding from the German state. Though Brandt did not give the state "useful information", the funding supported recruitment efforts in Thuringia during the early 1990s. (Brandt was eventually sentenced to five and a half years in prison on for 66 counts of [[child prostitution]] and [[child sexual abuse]]).&lt;ref name=meaney /&gt;  

Police were only able to locate the killers when they were tipped off following a botched bank robbery in [[Eisenach]]. As the police closed in on them, the two men committed [[suicide]]. They had evaded capture for 13 years. [[Beate Zschäpe]], who had been living with the two men in [[Zwickau]], turned herself in to the German authorities a few days later.  Zschäpe's trial began in May 2013; she was charged with nine counts of [[murder]]. She plead "not guilty". According to ''[[The Guardian]]'', the NSU may have enjoyed protection and support from certain "elements of the state". [[Anders Breivik]], a fan of Zschäpe's, reportedly sent her a letter from prison in 2012.&lt;ref name=meaney&gt;{{Cite news| issn = 0261-3077| last1 = Meaney| first1 = Thomas| last2 = Schäfer| first2 = Saskia| title = The neo-Nazi murder trial revealing Germany's darkest secrets | work = The Guardian| accessdate = 2018-11-12| date = 2016-12-15| url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/15/neo-nazi-murders-revealing-germanys-darkest-secrets}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1967, a few weeks prior to an election, a military coup d'état took place in Greece and a fascist military government ruled the country from 1967 to 1974. It was called the "[[Greek military junta of 1967–74|Regime of the Colonels]]", and was headed by Colonel [[Georgios Papadopoulos]]. The official reason given for the coup was that a "communist conspiracy" had infiltrated all levels of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.athensinfoguide.com/history/t9-97-2junta.htm|title=Military Junta in Greece - Athens Info Guide|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there have been persistent rumors about an active support of the coup by the U.S. government, there is no evidence to support such claims.&lt;ref&gt;Moseley, Ray (17 November 1999).

The [[far right]] political party [[Golden Dawn (Greece)|Golden Dawn]] (Χρυσή Αυγή - Chrysi Avyi) is generally labelled neo-Nazi, although the group rejects this label.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Helena |last=Smith |title=Rise of the Greek far right raises fears of further turmoil |newspaper=The Guardian |date=16 December 2011 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/16/rise-greek-far-right-turmoil |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few Golden Dawn members participated in the [[Bosnian War]] in the [[Greek Volunteer Guard]] (GVG) and were present in [[Srebrenica]] during the [[Srebrenica massacre#Non-Serb participants in the killings|Srebrenica massacre]].&lt;ref name="Michas"&gt;{{cite web |first=Michas |last=Takis |title=Unholy Alliance |publisher=[[Texas A&amp;M University]] Press: Eastern European Studies (College Station, Tex.) |page=22 |url=http://www.preventgenocide.org/edu/pastgenocides/formeryugoslavia/resources/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="srebr"&gt;[http://www.enet.gr/online/online_fpage_text?id=13996864,21821632,8195520%22 16/07/2005 article] in Eleftherotypia.

There is often collaboration between the state and neo-Nazi elements in Greece.&lt;ref name=dalakoglou /&gt; In 2018, during the trial of sixty-nine members of the Golden Dawn party, evidence was presented of the close ties between the party and the [[Hellenic Police]].&lt;ref name=aj&gt;{{Cite web| title = Tapped phone calls further reveal Golden Dawn's police ties| accessdate = 2018-11-12| url = https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/04/tapped-phone-calls-reveal-golden-dawns-police-ties-180419212215599.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Golden Dawn received 6.92% of the votes in the June election and entered the [[Greek parliament]] with 18 representatives.

Since 2008, neo-Nazi violence in Greece has targeted [[Immigration to Greece|immigrants]], [[leftist]]s and [[anarchist]] activists.  In 2009, certain far right groups announced that [[Agios Panteleimonas, Athens|Agios Panteleimonas]] in [[Athens]] was off limits to immigrants. Neo-Nazi patrols affiliated with the Golden Dawn party began attacking migrants in this neighborhood.  The violence continued escalating through 2010.&lt;ref name=dalakoglou&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1111/wusa.12044| issn = 10897011| volume = 16| issue = 2| pages = 283–292| last = Dalakoglou| first = Dimitris| title = Neo- Nazism and Neoliberalism: A Few Comments on Violence in Athens At the Time of Crisis Neo- Nazism and Neoliberalism: A Few Comments on Violence in Athens At the Time of Crisis| journal = WorkingUSA| accessdate = 2018-11-12| date = 2013-06| url = http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=bth&amp;AN=87917536&amp;site=ehost-live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, after the murder of [[anti-fascist]] rapper [[Pavlos Fyssas]], the number of [[hate crimes]] in Greece declined for several years until 2017.

====Hungary====
The [[Hungarian Guard]] is a neo-Nazi [[paramilitary]] organization in [[Hungary]]. The Guard was modelled on the [[Arrow Cross Party]], which participated in the murder of Jews and Gypsies during the Holocaust. It serves as a paramilitary force for the far right [[Jobbik party]]. Gypsy homes have been targeted by night time [[death squads]] who throw a [[molotov cocktail]] through the window and then open fire on the inhabitants as they flee their burning homes. The Chief of Police in [[Miskolc]] has made public statements that "Hungarian and Gypsy cultures can't mix".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| issn = 00107565| volume = 291| issue = 1694| pages = 280| last = Land| first = Thomas| title = Disappointed Eastern Europe Confronts Its Neo-Nazis| journal = Contemporary Review| date = 2009| via=[[EBSCOhost]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Netherlands====
The Coordination Forum for Countering Antisemitism reports that on 17 May 2011 in [[Leek, Netherlands|Leek]], [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]], antisemitic graffiti was found at a Jewish school. The graffiti consisted of a swastika and the text "C18", or [[Combat 18]], a neo-Nazi organisation active throughout Europe.

====Poland====
[[File:ONR poznan.jpg|thumb|250px|ONR march in [[Poznań]] in November 2015]]

Under the [[Polish Constitution]] promoting any totalitarian system such as [[Nazism]] and [[fascism]] (as well as [[communism]]) as well as inciting violence and/or racial hatred is illegal.&lt;ref&gt;[[Polish Constitution]] (Dz.U. z 1997 r. Nr 78, poz. 483)&lt;/ref&gt; This was further re-enforced in the [[Polish Penal Code]] where discrediting any group or persons on national, religious, racial or religious grounds carries a sentence of 3 years.&lt;ref&gt;[[Polish Penal Code]] (Dz.U. z 2017 r. poz. 2204, z późn. zm.; Art 256 &amp; Art 257)&lt;/ref&gt;

Although several small far-right and anti-semitic organisations exist, most notably [[National Revival of Poland|NOP]] and [[National Radical Camp (1993)|ONR]] (both of which exist legally), they frequently adhere to [[Polish nationalism]] and [[National Democracy]], in which Nazism is generally considered to be against [[ultra-nationalism|ultra-nationalist]] principles, and although they are classed as [[Nationalism|nationalist]] and [[fascism|fascist]] movements, they are at the same time considered anti-Nazi. Some of their elements may resemble neo-Nazi features, but these groups frequently dissociate themselves from Nazi elements, claiming that such acts are unpatriotic and they argue that Nazism misappropriated or slightly altered several pre-existing symbols and features, such as distinguishing the [[Roman salute]] from the [[Nazi salute]].&lt;ref name="dziennik.pl(2008-06-21)"&gt;PAP (2008-06-21), [http://www.dziennik.pl/wydarzenia/article195823 Faszystowskie gesty w Myślenicach.]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''Dziennik.pl'' Kraj. Retrieved 25 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-declared neo-Nazi movements in Poland frequently treat Polish culture and traditions with contempt, are [[anti-Christian]] and translate various texts from German, meaning they are considered movements favouring [[Germanisation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Olgierd Grott|title= Faszyści i narodowi socjaliści w Polsce| publisher= Nomos|location= Kraków|year= 2007 |page= 344|isbn= 978-83-60490-19-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

According to several reporter investigations the Polish government turns a blind eye to these groups and they are free to spread their ideology, frequently dismissing their existence as [[conspiracy theories]], dismissing acts political provocations, deeming them too insignificant to pose a threat, or [[Apologetics|attempting to justify or diminish the seriousness of their actions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://wiadomosci.wp.pl/polscy-neonazisci-zdemaskowani-sympatycy-pis-widza-w-tym-spisek-6212049554433665a | title=Polscy neonaziści zdemaskowani.

====Russia====
{{Main article|Racism in Russia|Radical nationalism in Russia}}

There are a few Russian neo-Nazis that openly admire [[Adolf Hitler]] and use the [[swastika]] as their symbol. Russian neo-Nazis are characterized by [[racism]], [[antisemitism]], [[homophobia]], [[Islamophobia]] and extreme [[xenophobia]] towards people from [[Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=4 mei 2008 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLUxuq-E9yA |title=Horrific Documentary on Russian Neo-Nazis part 1 |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=2009-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their ideology centers on defending Russian national identity against what they perceive as a takeover by minority groups such as [[Jew]]s, [[Peoples of the Caucasus|Caucasians]], gay people, [[Central Asia]]ns, [[East Asia]]ns, [[Romani people|Roma people]] (gypsies), and Muslims. There is also a widespread gay rights Nazi skinhead subculture with its own Vkontakte group, GASH, and an alleged 1700 members in Moscow alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/gr/read/meet-russias-gay-aryan-skinheads-finally-bringing-homosexuality-to-the-neo-nazi-world|title=An Interview with a Gay, Russian Neo-Nazi|website=Vice|date=2013-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Neo-Nazism in Russia (2010).jpg|thumb|187px|left|Neo-Nazism in Russia: The photograph was taken at an anti-gay demonstration in Moscow in October 2010]]

Russian neo-Nazis have made it an explicit goal to take over the country by force, and have put serious effort into preparing for this. [[Paramilitary]] organizations operating under the guise of sports clubs have trained their members in squad tactics, [[hand to hand combat]] and weapons handling. They have stockpiled and used weapons, often illegally.

Some observers have noted a subjective irony of Russians embracing Nazism, because one of Hitler's ambitions at the start of [[World War II]] was the [[Generalplan Ost]] (Master Plan East) which envisaged to exterminate, expel, or enslave most or all Slavs from central and eastern Europe (e.g., Russians, Ukrainians, Poles etc.).&lt;ref name=William1&gt;[[William W. Hagen]] (2012). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=zBgr3kL-PP4C&amp;pg=&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false German History in Modern Times: Four Lives of the Nation]''. Cambridge University Press. p. 313. {{ISBN|0-521-19190-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russian neo-Nazis deny the authenticity of this plan and instead emphasize the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact|1939-1941 Nazi-Soviet non-aggression pact]].&lt;ref name=William1 /&gt; At the end of the [[Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union]], over 25 million Soviet citizens had died.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/wwtwo/soviet_german_war_01.shtml The Soviet-German War 1941 - 1945]". BBC - History.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2007 news story, ''ABC News'' reported, "In a country that lost more people defeating the Nazis than any other country, there are now an estimated 50,000 to 70,000 neo-Nazis, half of the world's total."&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/story?id=3718255&amp;page=1 "Violence 'in the Name of the Nation'"]. ''[[ABC News]]''. October 11, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991 caused great economic and social problems, including widespread [[unemployment]] and [[poverty]]. Several [[far right]] [[paramilitary]] organizations were able to tap into popular discontent, particularly among marginalized, lesser educated and unemployed youths. Of the three major age groups — youths, adults, and the elderly — youths may have been hit the hardest. The elderly suffered due to inadequate (or unpaid) pensions, but they found effective political representation in the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation|Communist Party]], and generally had their concerns addressed through better budget allocations. Adults, although often suffering financially and psychologically due to job losses, were generally able to find new sources of income.

[[Russian National Unity]] (RNE), founded in 1990 and led by [[Alexander Barkashov]], has claimed to have members in 250 cities. RNE adopted the swastika as its symbol, and sees itself as the avant-garde of a coming national revolution. It is critical of other major far right organizations, such as the [[Liberal Democratic Party of Russia]] (LDPR). Historian Walter Laqueur calls RNE far closer to the Nazi model than the LDPR. RNE publishes several news sheets; one of them, ''Russky poryadok'', claims to have a circulation of 150,000. Full members of RNE are called Soratnik (comrades in arms), receive combat training at locations near Moscow, and many of them work as security officers or armed guards.&lt;ref&gt;Laqueur, Walter, ''Fascism: Past, Present, Future'', p. 189&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 August 2007, Russian authorities arrested a student for allegedly posting a video on the Internet which appears to show two migrant workers being beheaded in front of a red and black swastika flag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6946810.stm |title=Russian held over 'deaths' video |publisher=BBC News |date=2007-08-15 |accessdate=2009-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander Verkhovsky, the head of a Moscow-based center that monitors [[hate crime]] in Russia, said, "It looks like this is the real thing. The killing is genuine ... There are similar videos from the Chechen war. But this is the first time the killing appears to have been done intentionally."&lt;ref name="execution"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/russia/article/0,,2149611,00.html|title=Student arrested over Russian neo-Nazi 'execution' video|author=Luke Harding|publisher=The Guardian|date=2007-08-16|accessdate=2007-08-16 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sweden====
Neo-Nazi activities in [[Sweden]] have previously been limited to [[White supremacy|white supremacist]] groups, few of which have a membership over a few hundred members.&lt;ref&gt;Laqueur, Walter, ''Fascism: Past, Present, Future'', p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; The main neo-Nazi organization as of 2017 is the [[Nordic Resistance Movement]]. Nordic Resistance Movement self-identifies as a [[National Socialist]] political movement with a parliamentary branch. They are also active in [[Norway]], [[Finland]], and [[Denmark]].

====Switzerland====

The neo-Nazi and [[white power skinhead]] scene in Switzerland has seen significant growth in the 1990s and 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fedpol.admin.ch/etc/medialib/data/sicherheit/bericht_innere_sicherheit.Par.0042.File.tmp/d_s01_s92.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030110036/http://www.fedpol.admin.ch/etc/medialib/data/sicherheit/bericht_innere_sicherheit.Par.0042.File.tmp/d_s01_s92.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=30 October 2007|title=Wayback Machine|date=30 October 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is reflected in the foundation of the [[Partei National Orientierter Schweizer]] in 2000, which resulted in an improved organizational structure of the neo-Nazi and white supremacist scene.

====India====
Though [[Hindu nationalists]] distanced themselves from the [[totalitarian]] regimes with whom they had previously enjoyed close ties, Nazism and [[Nazi occultism]], in particular, have remained a subject of interest in India throughout the post-War era.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Hindu Nationalist's Historical Links to Nazism and Fascism| work = International Business Times| accessdate = 2018-11-11| date = 2012-03-06| url = https://www.ibtimes.com/hindu-nationalists-historical-links-nazism-fascism-214222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pakistan====
Pro-Nazi sentiment is widespread in Pakistan, according to the German magazine ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', compounded by the anti-Semitism engendered by the opposition to Israel and support for Palestine general throughout the region.  Such attitudes, exemplified by a belief that Hitler was a military genius, are shared by both Muslims and Hindus, and are related to the belief that Pakistanis are Aryans, and therefore would be accepted in Nazi Germany.&lt;ref name="spi"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/the-fuehrer-cult-germans-cringe-at-hitler-s-popularity-in-pakistan-a-683966.html|title=The Führer Cult; Germans Cringe at Hitler's Popularity in Pakistan|first=Hasnain|last=Kazim|date=2010-03-17|newspaper=Speigel Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Israel====
Neo-Nazi activity is not common or widespread in [[Israel]], and the few reported activities have all been the work of extremists, who were punished severely. One notable case is that of [[Patrol 36]], a cell in [[Petah Tikva]] made up of eight teenage immigrants from the former Soviet Union who had been attacking foreign workers and gay people, and vandalizing [[synagogue]]s with Nazi images.&lt;ref name="BBC Israeli"&gt;{{cite news|title=Israeli 'neo-Nazi gang' arrested|date=9 September 2007|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6985808.stm|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Asser"&gt;{{cite news|title=Israeli anger over 'Nazi' group|author=Martin Asser|publisher=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6987848.stm|date=10 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; These neo-Nazis were reported to have operated in cities across Israel, and have been described as being influenced by the rise of neo-Nazism in Europe;&lt;ref name="BBC Israeli"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Asser"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6989776.stm |title=Middle East &amp;#124; Israeli neo-Nazi suspects charged |publisher=BBC News |date=2007-09-11 |accessdate=2009-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; mostly influenced by similar movements in Russia and Ukraine, as the rise of the phenomenon is widely credited to immigrants from those two states, the largest sources of emigration to Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Israel's Unbelievable Neo-Nazis|date=8 December 2008|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezXm9jkukBo|publisher=Journeyman Pictures}}&lt;/ref&gt; Widely publicized arrests have led to a call to reform the [[Law of Return]] to permit the revocation of Israeli citizenship for – and the subsequent deportation of – neo-Nazis.&lt;ref name="Asser"/&gt;

Though Tsagaan Khass leaders say they do not support violence, they are self-proclaimed Nazis. "Adolf Hitler was someone we respect. He taught us how to preserve national identity," said the 41-year-old co-founder, who calls himself Big Brother. "We don't agree with his extremism and starting the Second World War. We are against all those killings, but we support his ideology. We support nationalism rather than fascism." Some have ascribed it to poor [[Education in Mongolia|historical education]].&lt;ref name="naive"/&gt;

====Taiwan====
{{main article|National Socialism Association}}

The [[National Socialism Association]] (NSA) is a neo-Nazi political organisation founded in [[Taiwan]] in September 2006 by Hsu Na-chi ({{zh|t=許娜琦}}), at that time a 22-year-old female [[political science]] graduate of [[Soochow University (Taiwan)|Soochow University]]. The NSA has an explicit stated goal of obtaining the power to govern the state. The [[Simon Wiesenthal Centre]] condemned the National Socialism Association on 13 March 2007 for championing the former [[Nazi]] dictator and blaming democracy for [[social unrest]] in Taiwan.&lt;ref name=Haaretz837967&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/837697.html "Taiwan political activists admiring Hitler draw Jewish protests"] ''[[Haaretz]]'' ([[Reuters]], the [[Associated Press]]). 14 March 2007.

====Canada====
[[Neo-Nazism in Canada]] began with the formation of the [[Canadian Nazi Party]] in 1965. In the 1970s and 1980s, neo-Nazism continued to spread in the country as organizations including the [[Western Guard Party]] and [[Creativity (religion)|Church of the Creator]] (later renamed ''Creativity'') promoted white supremacist ideals.&lt;ref name= source2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nizkor.org/|title=Holocaust Educational Resource|publisher=nizkor.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in the United States in 1973, Creativity calls for [[white people]] to wage [[Ben Klassen#Racial holy war|racial holy war]] (Rahowa) against Jews and other perceived enemies.&lt;ref name= source14&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Berlet | first1 = Chip | last2 = Vysotsky | first2 = Stanislav | year = 2006 | title = Overview of U.S. White Supremacist Groups | url = | journal = Journal of Political and Military Sociology | volume = 34 | issue = 1| pages = 11–48 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Don Andrews]] founded the [[Nationalist Party of Canada]] in 1977. The purported goals of the unregistered party are "the promotion and maintenance of European Heritage and Culture in Canada," but the party is known for anti-Semitism and racism. Many influential neo-Nazi Leaders, such as [[Wolfgang Droege]], were affiliated with the party, but many of its members left to join the Heritage Front, which was founded in 1989.&lt;ref name= source3/&gt;

Droege founded the [[Heritage Front]] in [[Toronto]] at a time when leaders of the white supremacist movement were "disgruntled about the state of the radical right" and wanted to unite unorganized groups of white supremacists into an influential and efficient group with common objectives.&lt;ref name= source3/&gt;  Plans for the organization began in September 1989, and the formation of the Heritage Front was formally announced a couple of months later in November. In the 1990s, [[George Burdi]] of [[Resistance Records]] and the band [[Rahowa (band)|Rahowa]] popularized the Creativity movement and the [[white power music]] scene.&lt;ref name=source1&gt;Hamm, Mark S. ''American Skinheads: The Criminology and Control of Hate Crime''. Westport, CT: Praeger Publishers, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=October 2016}}

Controversy and dissention has left many Canadian neo-Nazi organizations dissolved or weakened.&lt;ref name= source3&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Burstow | first1 = Bonnie | year = 2003 | title = Surviving and thriving by becoming more 'groupuscular': the case of the Heritage Front | url = | journal = Patterns of Prejudice | volume = 37 | issue = 4| pages = 415–428 | doi=10.1080/0031322032000144492}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Flag_of_National_Socialist_Movement_of_Chile.svg|thumb|upright|Flag of the [[National Socialist Movement of Chile]]]]
After the dissolution of the [[National Socialist Movement of Chile]] (MNSCH) in 1938, notable former members of MNSCH migrated into [[Partido Agrario Laborista]] (PAL), obtaining high positions.&lt;ref name=etche&gt;Etchepare, Jaime Antonio; Stewart; Hamish I., ''Nazism in Chile: A Particular Type of Fascism in South America. ''[[Journal of Contemporary History]]'' (1995).&lt;/ref&gt; Not all former MNSCH members joined the PAL; some continued to form parties that followed the MNSCH model until 1952.&lt;ref name=etche/&gt; A new old-school Nazi party was formed in 1964 by school teacher [[Franz Pfeiffer]].&lt;ref name=etche/&gt; Among the activities of this group were the organization of a ''Miss Nazi'' beauty contest and the formation of a Chilean branch of the [[Ku Klux Klan]].&lt;ref name=etche/&gt; The party disbanded in 1970. Pfeiffer attempted to restart it in 1983 in the wake of a wave of protests against the [[Chile under Pinochet|Augusto Pinochet regime]].&lt;ref name=etche/&gt;

[[Nicolás Palacios]] considered the "Chilean race" to be a mix of two bellicose master races: the [[Visigoth]]s of Spain and the [[Mapuche]] (Araucanians) of Chile.&lt;ref name=palaciosmestizo&gt;[[Nicolás Palacios|Palacios, Nicolás]], ''Raza Chilena'' (Editorial Chilena, 1918), pp. 35—36.&lt;/ref&gt;  Palacios traces the origins of the Spanish component of the "Chilean race" to the coast of the [[Baltic Sea]], specifically to [[Götaland]] in [[Sweden]],&lt;ref name=palaciosmestizo/&gt; one of the supposed [[homeland]]s of the [[Goths]]. Palacios claimed that both the blonde-haired and the bronze-coloured Chilean [[Mestizo]] share a "moral physonomy" and a masculine psychology.&lt;ref name=palaciospsico&gt;[[Nicolás Palacios|Palacios, Nicolás]], ''Raza Chilena'' (Editorial Chilena, 1918), p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; He opposed immigration from [[Southern Europe]], and argued that Mestizos who are derived from south Europeans lack "cerebral control" and are a social burden.&lt;ref name=palacioslatino&gt;[[Nicolás Palacios|Palacios, Nicolás]], ''Raza Chilena'' (Editorial Chilena, 1918), p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several neo-Nazi groups exist in [[Costa Rica]].

The groups normally target [[Jewish]]-[[Costa Ricans]], [[Afro-Costa Rican]]s, [[communism|Communists]], gay people and especially [[Nicaragua]]n and [[Colombian people|Colombian]] immigrants. The media has discovered the existence of an underground neo-Nazi group inside the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nacion.com/2012-04-16/Sucesos/null.aspx |title=Fuerza Pública investiga fotos de policía en Facebook - SUCESOS - |newspaper=La Nación |date=2012-04-16 |accessdate=2012-11-07 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120702214252/http://www.nacion.com/2012-04-16/Sucesos/null.aspx |archivedate=2 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several neo-Nazi groups in the United States. The [[National Socialist Movement (United States)|National Socialist Movement]] (NSM), with about 400 members in 32 states,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/11/us/11nazi.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all "Neo-Nazi Father Is Killed; Son, 10, Steeped in Beliefs, Is Accused"]. ''The New York Times''. 10 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; is currently the largest neo-Nazi organization in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adl.org/Learn/Ext_US/nsm/default.asp?LEARN_Cat=Extremism&amp;LEARN_SubCat=Extremism_in_America&amp;xpicked=3&amp;item=nsm "The National Socialist Movement"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130104004433/http://www.adl.org/Learn/Ext_US/nsm/default.asp?LEARN_Cat=Extremism&amp;LEARN_SubCat=Extremism_in_America&amp;xpicked=3&amp;item=nsm |date=4 January 2013 }}. [[The Anti-Defamation League]].&lt;/ref&gt;  After World War II, new organizations formed with varying degrees of support for Nazi principles. The [[National States' Rights Party]], founded in 1958 by Edward Reed Fields and [[J. B. Stoner]] countered [[racial integration]] in the [[Southern United States]] with Nazi-inspired publications and iconography. The [[American Nazi Party]], founded by [[George Lincoln Rockwell]] in 1959, achieved high-profile coverage in the press through its public demonstrations.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, Jeffrey, ''[[Encyclopedia of White Power]]: A Sourcebook on the Radical Racist Right'' (Rowman Altamira, 2000), pp. 1–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ideology of [[James H. Madole]], leader of the [[National Renaissance Party (United States)|National Renaissance Party]], was influenced by [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Blavatskian Theosophy]]. [[Helena Blavatsky]] developed a racial theory of [[evolution]], holding that the [[white race]] was the "fifth rootrace" called the [[Aryan Race]]. According to Blavatsky, Aryans had been preceded by Atlanteans who had perished in the flood that sunk the continent [[Atlantis]]. The three races that preceded the Atlanteans, in Blavatsky's view, were proto-humans; these were the [[Lemuria (continent)|Lemurians]], [[Hyperborea|Hyperboreans]] and the first Astral rootrace. It was on upon this foundation that Madole based his claims the Aryan Race has been worshiped as "White Gods" since time immemorial and proposed a governance structure based on the Hindu [[Laws of Manu]] and its hierarchical [[Caste system in India|caste system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |publisher=NYU Press |isbn=978-0-8147-3155-0 |last=Goodrick-Clarke |first=Nicholas |title=Black Sun: Aryan Cults, Esoteric Nazism, and the Politics of Identity |date=2003 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Black_Sun.html?id=xaiaM77s6N4C |pages=79–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]] guarantees [[freedom of speech]], which allows political organizations great latitude in expressing Nazi, racist, and anti-Semitic views. A First Amendment landmark case was ''[[National Socialist Party of America v. Village of Skokie]]'', in which neo-Nazis threatened to march in a predominantly Jewish suburb of Chicago. The march never took place in Skokie, but the court ruling allowed the neo-Nazis to stage a series of demonstrations in Chicago.

In May 2018, graduating students at [[Baraboo High School]], in [[Barabooo, Wisconsin]], appeared to perform a Nazi salute in a [[Baraboo Nazi salute photo|photograph]] taken before their junior prom.  The image went viral on social media six months later, in November 2018.  The school decided not to punish the students due to their First Amendment rights.

The [[Institute for Historical Review]], formed in 1978, is a [[Holocaust denial]] body associated with neo-Nazism.&lt;ref name=ADL&gt;[http://www.adl.org/learn/ext_us/historical_review.asp?LEARN_Cat=Extremism&amp;LEARN_SubCat=Extremism_in_America&amp;xpicked=3&amp;item=ihr "Extremism in America: Institute for Historical Review"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115233810/http://www.adl.org/Learn/ext_us/historical_review.asp?LEARN_Cat=Extremism&amp;LEARN_SubCat=Extremism_in_America&amp;xpicked=3&amp;item=ihr |date=15 January 2013 }}, [[Anti-Defamation League]].

Organizations which report upon American neo-Nazi activities include the [[Anti-Defamation League]] and the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]]. American neo-Nazis are known to attack and harass minorities.&lt;ref&gt;''American Swastika: Inside the White Power Movement's Hidden Spaces of Hate'' By Pete Simi, Robert Futrell&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=October 2016}}

===Africa===
Several groups in [[South Africa]] such as [[Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging]] and [[Blanke Bevrydingsbeweging]], have often been described as neo-Nazi.&lt;ref name="afrikaner"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/africa/04/05/south.africa.terreblanche/|title=South Africa's neo-Nazis drop revenge vow |publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Eugène Terre'Blanche]] was a prominent South African neo-Nazi leader who was murdered in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/eugegravene-terreblanche-leader-of-the-far-right-awb-party-who-led-the-resistance-to-majority-rule-1936550.html|title=Eugène Terre'Blanche: Leader of the far-right AWB party who led|date=6 April 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oceania===

There were a number of now-defunct Australian neo-Nazi groups, such as the [[Australian National Socialist Party]] (ANSP), which was formed in 1962 and merged into the [[National Socialist Party of Australia]] (1968-1970s), originally a splinter group, in 1968,&lt;ref name="Henderson 76"&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=27516076|title=Frank Browne and the Neo-Nazis|last=Henderson|first=Peter|journal=Labour History|date=November 2005|number=89|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jack van Tongeren]]'s Australian Nationalist Movement.&lt;ref name="Henderson 76"/&gt; 

Current active organisations include [[Antipodean Resistance]], local chapters of the Aryan Nations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/national/crime/murder-shines-spotlight-on-australias-white-supremacist-subculture/news-story/0243f471b2174953d839946f85bab29b|title=Murder shines spotlight on Australia's ugly subculture|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Blood and Honour,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloodandhonouraustralia.org/|title=BH Australia|website=www.bloodandhonouraustralia.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as prominent individuals such as [[Blair Cottrell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/blair-cottrell-leader-of-aussie-patriots-upf-wanted-hitler-in-the-classroom-20151016-gkbbvz.html|title=Blair Cottrell, rising anti-Islam movement leader, wanted Hitler in the classroom|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=13 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Motorola TLKR T40, front.jpg|thumb|upright|Motorola TLKR T40 radio tuned to PMR channel 1]]
'''PMR446''' (personal mobile radio, 446&amp;nbsp;[[MHz]]) is a part of the [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] [[radio frequency]] range that is open without licensing for business and personal use in most countries of the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/binaries/spectrum/spectrum-policy-area/spectrum-management/licence-exempt-radio-use/licence-exempt-devices/Analogue_and_Digital_PMR4461.pdf |title=Analogue and Digital PMR446 Information Sheet |publisher=Ofcom |date= |accessdate=2013-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

PMR446 is ideal for small-site, same-building and line of sight outdoor activities. It is used in both professional and consumer-grade [[walkie-talkie]]s (similar to those used for [[Family Radio Service|FRS]]/[[General Mobile Radio Service|GMRS]] in the United States and Canada). Depending on surrounding terrain range can vary from a few hundred metres (in a city) to a few kilometres (flat countryside) to many kilometres from high ground. 

Historically, analogue [[frequency modulation|FM]] is used but a digital voice mode has been available in radios conforming to [[digital private mobile radio]] (dPMR446) and [[digital mobile radio]] (DMR Tier 1) standards designed by [[ETSI]].

Originally 8 channels were available in analogue mode but this has now been increased to 16 Channels.

In addition to PMR446, some countries in the EU have begun to introduce [[LPD433]] (low power device 433&amp;nbsp;MHz) licence-free short range transceiver radios as part of [[Short Range Device|short range device]] regulations.  These radios give an additional 69 channels (LPD433) which can be used with [[Continuous Tone-Coded Squelch System|CTCSS]] or [[Digital-Coded Squelch|DCS]] to improve co-operation on shared channels. These extra channels have been introduced to reduce the burden on the 16 PMR446 channels over shorter distances (&lt;1&amp;nbsp;km).

==History==
The first steps towards creating licence-free short range radio communications were taken in April 1997 when the [[European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations|European Radio Communications Committee]] decided on a 446&amp;nbsp;MHz frequency band to be used for the new radios. In November 1998, ERC Decision (98)25 allocated frequency band 446.0-446.1 MHz  for analogue PMR446; another two decisions established licence exemption for PMR446 equipment and free circulation of the PMR446 equipment. The first country which introduced these frequencies for licence-free use was Ireland on 1 April 1998. The United Kingdom introduced PMR446 service in April 1999; since 2003, it has replaced the former short-range business radio (SRBR) service.

In October 2005, ECC Decision (05)02 added unlicensed band 446.1–446.2&amp;nbsp;MHz for use by digital DMR/dPMR equipment.

In July 2015, ECC Decision (15)05 doubled the number of analog channels to 16 by extending analog operation onto the 446.1–446.2&amp;nbsp;MHz band previously used by digital DMR/dPMR equipment, effective January 2016; from January 2018, the number of digital channels will also be doubled by extending onto the 446.0–446.1&amp;nbsp;MHz band used by analog FM.

==Range==
Until recently, PMR446 radios were handheld [[transceiver]]s with fixed antennas (see [[PMR446#Technical information|Technical information]]). In November 2015, [[Midland Radio]] announced the release of the GB1 mobile PMR446 radio for vehicular use.&lt;ref name=stw&gt;[http://simonthewizard.com/2015/11/26/world-first-pmr-446-mobile-attached-antenna/ World First Midland GB1 PMR 446 Mobile Attached Antenna]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rt1"&gt;[http://www.radiotronics.co.uk/midland-gb1 Midland GB1 First Look Midland GB1 Mobile PMR446 - Manual Download Includes Specs]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sw2"&gt;[http://simonthewizard.com/2015/12/02/midland-gb1-first-look/ Midland GB1 First Look *Updated With English Manual*]&lt;/ref&gt;

The range of PMR446, just like any VHF or UHF radio, is dependent on many factors like environment (in-city range is far less than in an open field), height above surrounding obstructions,  and, to a lesser extent, weather conditions. The antenna type and location, transmit power and receive sensitivity also affect range. However, with PMR446 most of these variables are fixed at manufacturing to comply with the PMR446 specifications. Most of the time the maximum range that a user in a city can expect is a few hundred metres or less.

Range may be many kilometres, for example between hilltops, or only a few hundred metres, if for example a hill or large metal object is in the transmission path between radios. The best known long distance record is 333&amp;nbsp;mi (535.8&amp;nbsp;km) from [[Blyth, Northumberland|Blyth]] in the United Kingdom to [[Almere]], Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.delboyenterprises.dsl.pipex.com/446_2003/UK_Amsterdam_DX_Contact.htm | title=Delboy's DX Contact UK to Amsterdam |publisher=Delboy Enterprises |date=5 August 2003 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080209180929/http://www.delboyenterprises.dsl.pipex.com/446_2003/UK_Amsterdam_DX_Contact.htm |archivedate=2008-02-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the result of enhanced [[Radio propagation|propagation conditions]], not a [[line-of-sight propagation|line-of-sight]] signal.

==Usage worldwide==
PMR446 radios use frequencies that in Australia, the U.S., and Canada are allocated to [[amateur radio]] operators. PMR446 radios can only be used in those countries by licensed amateur radio operators. The conflicting allocations have been something of a nuisance to amateur operators due to use of the equipment by European tourists.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

Instead, the U.S. and Canada uses the [[Family Radio Service|FRS]] system, which provides a similar service on different frequencies, around 462 and 467 MHz. These frequencies are allocated to the emergency services in Europe, notably the fire brigade in the UK, police in Russia and commercial users in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://britishexpats.com/forum/showthread.php?t=301925 |title=Can I bring my FRS / GMRS Radio to Europe - Austria, Germany, Switzerland : British Expat Discussion Forum |publisher=Britishexpats.com |date=2005-05-10 |accessdate=2010-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interference with licensed radio services may result in prosecution.

PMR446-compliant equipment may be used anywhere throughout Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dpmr-mou.org/dPMR-446.html dPMR446 - Welcome to the dPMR Association]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technical information==
PMR446 covers band 446.0–446.2&amp;nbsp;MHz.  Radios may now have removable antennas in some countries as long as the [[Effective radiated power|ERP]] does not exceed 500&amp;nbsp;mW, for example in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0025/85156/ir_2009_analogue_and_digita1.pdf |title=Analogue and Digital PMR446 Information Sheet |publisher=Ofcom |date= |accessdate=2013-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The general ECC decision&lt;ref&gt;{{cite techreport|url=http://www.erodocdb.dk/Docs/doc98/official/pdf/ECCDEC1505.PDF | title=ECC Decision (15)05 | collaboration=Electronic Communications Committee|date=3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; however still requires integral antennas and the actual implementation varies between different countries.

Per regulation, maximum power, like FRS, is 500&amp;nbsp;mW ERP and equipment must be used on a mobile basis. [[CTCSS]] is usually used, with more upmarket models also featuring [[Digital-Coded Squelch|DCS]] and/or fixed-carrier [[voice inversion]]. Before January 2016, only the lower 8 channels were allowed for analog FM operation.

==PMR446 gateways==
Recently some users have implemented the '''simplex repeater''' system, a cheap and easy way to extend the radio range by using extra radios connected to a small repeater controller. This is also known as "Parrot", "ATX-2000" or just "Echo Repeater" after how it sounds repeating every transmission it receives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atx2000.altervista.org |title=Anfy preview |publisher=Atx2000.altervista.org |date= |accessdate=2010-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PMR446 gateways extend the range of PMR446. These gateways are connected through internet using a client/server [[VoIP]] system such as [[eQSO]] or the Free Radio Network ([http://www.freeradionetwork.eu FRN]).

'''Pepper spray''' (also known as '''capsicum spray''') is a [[lachrymatory agent]] (a chemical compound that irritates the eyes to cause tears, pain, and temporary blindness) used in [[policing]], [[riot control]], [[crowd control]], and [[self-defense]], including defense against dogs and bears.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tbotech.com/blog/index.php/2009/07/bear-spray-vs-dogs-how-effective-is-it/ |title=Bear Spray Vs. Dogs: How Effective Is It? |publisher=Tbotech.com |date=2009-07-04 |accessdate=2011-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.llrmi.com/articles/legal_update/pepperspray.shtml |title=Pepper Spray |publisher=Llrmi.com |accessdate= 2011-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its inflammatory effects cause the eyes to close, taking away vision. This temporary blindness allows officers to more easily restrain subjects and permits people in danger to use pepper spray in self-defense for an opportunity to escape. Although considered a [[non-lethal weapon|less-than-lethal agent]], it has been deadly in rare cases, and concerns have been raised about a number of deaths where being pepper sprayed may have been a contributing factor.

==Components==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2016}}
The active ingredient in pepper spray is [[capsaicin]], which is a chemical derived from the fruit of plants in the genus ''[[Capsicum]]'', including [[Chili pepper|chilis]]. Extraction of oleoresin capsicum (OC) from peppers requires capsicum to be finely ground, from which capsaicin is then extracted using an organic solvent such as [[ethanol]]. The solvent is then evaporated, and the remaining waxlike resin is the oleoresin capsaicin.

An emulsifier such as [[propylene glycol]] is used to suspend OC in water, and pressurized to make it [[aerosol]] in pepper spray. [[High performance liquid chromatography]] (HPLC) is used to measure the amount of capsaicin and major [[capsaicinoid]]s within pepper sprays.

Determining the strength of different manufacturers of pepper sprays can be confusing and difficult. Statements a company makes about their product strength are not regulated. A method using the capsaicin and related capsaicinoids (CRC) content of the product is unreliable as well, because there are six different types of capsaicinoids, causing different levels of irritation. Manufacturers do not state which particular type of capsaicinoids are used. Personal pepper sprays can range from a low of 0.18% to a high of 3%. Most law enforcement pepper sprays use between 1.3% and 2%. The federal government of the United States has determined that bear attack deterrent sprays must contain at least 1.0% and not more than 2% CRC. CRC does not measure the amount of OC within the formulation. Instead, CRC is the pain-producing component of the OC that produces the burning sensation.

The federal government of the United States makes no mention of [[Scoville scale|Scoville heat units]] (SHU) or OC in their requirements, only CRC (only for bear attack deterrent sprays). But, there are countries (Italy, Portugal and Spain - see below, under "Legality") and a few states within the US that do mention OC limitations. Some manufacturers may show a very high percentage of OC and, although OC is the active ingredient within the formulation, it does not indicate pepper spray strength. High OC percentage also indicates that a spray has more oil content; which, can possibly use lower grade pepper oils (but, more of it), or lower grade capsaicinoids (within the major CRCs) and also has less ability to soak and penetrate skin than a formula with a less, but higher-quality, pepper oil, because oil has hydrophobic properties.

The OC percentage measures only the amount of chili oil extract contained in the defense spray, not the strength, pungency or effectiveness of the product. Other companies may show a high SHU. The SHU is a measurement of the base resin compound and not what comes out in the aerosol. The rated irritant effect of the resin may be diluted depending on how much of it is put in the can.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

==Counterparts==

There are several counterparts of pepper spray developed and legal to possess in some countries:

* {{flag|United Kingdom}}:  [[Nonivamide|desmethyldihydrocapsaicin]] (known also as [[PAVA spray]])
** Used by police officers in the [[United Kingdom]]; as a [[Firearms Act 1968|Section 5]] weapon, it is not generally permitted to the public
* {{flag|Russia}}:  [[Pelargonic acid morpholide]] (MPK) 
** Widely used as a self-defense chemical agent spray in [[Russia]]. 
** Its effectiveness compared to natural pepper spray is unclear. 
* {{flag|PRC}}:  Police use tear gas ejector ("警用催泪喷射器" in Chinese)
** Could be used with multiple chemical component such as OC, CS or CN gases
** Used by [[Ministry of Public Security (China)|Chinese police units]] and security guards. It is defined as a "restricted" weapon that only police officers as well as the approved security can use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawinfochina.com/display.aspx?lib=law&amp;id=12049&amp;CGid=|title=Regulations of the People's Republic of China on Use of Police Implements and Arms by the People's Police|website=www.lawinfochina.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
** However, the law does not forbid the civilian to purchase and possess any non-police used pepper spray.

==Effects==
[[File:Pepper spray Demonstration.jpg|thumb|Pepper spray demonstration]]
[[File:MCMAP1.jpg|thumb|[[United States Marine Corps|US Marines]] training after being exposed to pepper spray.]]

Pepper spray is an [[Inflammation|inflammatory]] agent. It inflames the mucous membranes in the eyes, nose, throat and lungs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ozytive.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/sp1.gif|title=Top 10 Deadliest Weapons|last=|first=|date=June 2013|website=ozytive|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It causes immediate closing of the eyes, difficulty breathing, runny nose, and coughing.&lt;ref name="Effects Of Pepper Spray"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redhotpepperspray.com/effects-of-pepper-spray.html| title=Effects Of Pepper Spray |publisher=Redhotpepperspray.com|date= |accessdate=2011-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The duration of its effects depends on the strength of the spray, but the average full effect lasts from 20 to 90 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ozytive.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/sp1.gif|title=Top 10 Deadliest Weapons|last=|first=|date=June 2013|website=ozytive|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Journal of Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science'' published a study that concluded that single exposure of the eye to OC is harmless, but repeated exposure can result in long-lasting changes in [[cornea]]l sensitivity. They found no lasting decrease in [[visual acuity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iovs.org/cgi/content/full/41/8/2138|title=Effects of Oleoresin Capsicum Pepper Spray on Human Corneal Morphology and Sensitivity - Vesaluoma et al. 41 (8): 2138 - Investigative Ophthalmology &amp; Visual Science|publisher=Iovs.org|date= |accessdate=2011-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The European Parliament Scientific and Technological Options Assessment (STOA) published in 1998 "An Appraisal of Technologies of Political Control"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/etudes/stoa/2000/168394/DG-4-STOA_ET(2000)168394_EN(PAR02).pdf|title=pg 35|format=PDF|date= |accessdate=2011-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; with extensive information on pepper spray and [[Lachrymatory agent|tear gas]]. They write:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The effects of pepper spray are far more severe, including temporary blindness which lasts from 15–30 minutes, a burning sensation of the skin which lasts from 45 to 60 minutes, upper body spasms which force a person to bend forward and uncontrollable coughing making it difficult to breathe or speak for between 3 and 15 minutes.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For those with asthma, taking other drugs, or subject to restraining techniques that restrict the breathing passages, there is a risk of death. In 1995, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reported at least 61 deaths associated with police use of pepper spray since 1990 in the USA.&lt;ref&gt;''Los Angeles Times'' June 18, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) documented 27 people in police custody who died after exposure to pepper spray in California since 1993.&lt;ref name="ACLU"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aclu-sc.org/issues/police-practices/pepper-spray/|title=Pepper Spray Update: More Fatalities, More Questions|date=27 June 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ACLU, Oleoresin Capsicum - Pepper Spray Update, More Fatalities, More Questions, June, 1995, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ACLU_1995"&gt;"Pepper spray's lethal legacy" in ''[[Ottawa Citizen]]''. October 22, 1998, p. A1.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ACLU report counts any death occurring within hours of exposure to pepper spray. In all 27 cases, the coroners' report listed other factors as the primary cause of death, though in some cases the use of pepper spray may have been a contributing factor.&lt;ref name="ACLU"/&gt;

The US Army concluded, in a 1993 [[Aberdeen Proving Ground]] study, that pepper spray could cause "[m]utagenic effects, carcinogenic effects, sensitization, cardiovascular and pulmonary toxicity, neurotoxicity, as well as possible human fatalities. There is a risk in using this product on a large and varied population".&lt;ref&gt;Salem, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; However, the pepper spray was widely approved in the US despite the reservations of the US military scientists after it passed FBI tests in 1991. As of 1999, it was in use by more than 2,000 public safety agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Smith CG, Stopford W|title=Health hazards of pepper spray| journal=N C Med J |volume=60 |issue=5 |pages=268–74 |year=1999 |pmid=10495655}} Archived at [https://web.archive.org/web/20000817004624/http://www.ncmedicaljournal.com/Smith-OK.htm web.archive.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

The head of the FBI's Less-Than-Lethal Weapons Program at the time of the 1991 study, Special Agent Thomas W. W. Ward, was fired by the FBI and was sentenced to two months in prison for receiving payments from a peppergas manufacturer while conducting and authoring the FBI study that eventually approved pepper spray for FBI use.&lt;ref name="ACLU_1995"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Former F.B.I. Agent Is Sentenced to Prison", ''[[The New York Times]]''. May 20, 1996, p. B8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Ex-FBI Agent Pleads Guilty in Conflict-of-Interest Case", ''[[The Washington Post]]''. February 13, 1996, p. A12.&lt;/ref&gt; Prosecutors said that from December 1989 through 1990, Ward received about $5,000 a month for a total of $57,500, from Luckey Police Products, a Fort Lauderdale, Florida-based company that was a major producer and supplier of pepper spray. The payments were paid through a Florida company owned by Ward's wife.&lt;ref&gt;"Pepper spray study is tainted", ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]''. May 20, 1996, p. B8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pepper spray has been associated with [[positional asphyxiation]] of individuals in police custody. There is much debate over the actual "cause" of death in these cases. There have been few controlled clinical studies of the human health effects of pepper spray marketed for police use, and those studies are contradictory. Some studies have found no harmful effects beyond the effects described above.&lt;ref&gt;Reay DT. Forensic pathology, part 1: death in custody. Clinics in Lab Med 1998;18:19–20; Watson WA, Stremel KR, and Westdorp EJ. Oleoresin capsicum (cap-stun) toxicity from aerosol exposures. Ann Pharmacotherapy 1996;30:733–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Direct close-range spray can cause more serious eye irritation by attacking the cornea with a concentrated stream of liquid (the so-called "hydraulic needle" effect). Some brands have addressed this problem by means of an elliptically cone-shaped spray pattern.

===Acute response===
For individuals not previously exposed to OC effects, the general feelings after being sprayed can be best likened to being "set alight." The initial reaction should the spray be directed at the face, is the completely involuntary closing of the eyes (sometimes described as leading to a disconcerting sensation of the eyelids "bubbling and boiling" as the chemical acts on the skin), an instant sensation of the restriction of the airways and the general feeling of sudden and intense, searing pain about the face, nose, and throat. Coughing almost always follows the initial spray.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

Subsequent breaths through the nose or mouth lead to ingestion of the chemical, which feeds the feeling of choking. Police are trained to repeatedly instruct targets to "breathe normally" if they complain of difficulty, as the shock of the exposure can generate considerable panic as opposed to actual physical symptoms.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

==Treatment==
[[Capsaicin]] is not soluble in water, and even large volumes of water will not wash it off. In general, victims are encouraged to blink vigorously in order to encourage tears, which will help flush the irritant from the eyes.

A study of five often-recommended treatments for skin pain ([[Maalox]], 2% [[lidocaine]] gel, baby shampoo, milk, or water) concluded that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10903120802290786 |title=A Randomized Controlled Trial Comparing Treatment Regimens for Acute Pain for Topical Oleoresin Capsaicin (Pepper Spray) Exposure in Adult Volunteers - Prehospital Emergency Care |publisher=Informaworld.com |date=2008-09-04 |accessdate=2010-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;...there was no significant difference in pain relief provided by five different treatment regimens. Time after exposure appeared to be the best predictor for decrease in pain...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To avoid rubbing the spray into the skin, thereby prolonging the burning sensation, and, in order to not spread the compound to other parts of the body, victims should try to avoid touching affected areas. There are also wipes manufactured&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxlabs.com/sudecon_article.shtml Fox Labs: Pepper Spray Manufacturer].&lt;/ref&gt; for the express purpose of serving to decontaminate someone having received a dose of pepper spray. Many ambulance services and emergency departments use baby shampoo to remove the spray and with generally good effect. Some of the OC and CS will remain in the respiratory system, but a recovery of vision and the coordination of the eyes can be expected within 7 to 15 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;Young, D., ''Police Marksman Magazine'', July/August 1995 Issue.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some "triple-action" pepper sprays also contain "tear gas" ([[CS gas]]), which can be neutralized with [[sodium metabisulfite]] ([[Campden tablets]], used in [[homebrewing]]), though it is not water-soluble either and must be washed off using the same procedure as for pepper spray.

Pepper spray antidotes exist; examples include [[capsazepine]], [[ruthenium red]], and other [[TRPV1]] [[Discovery and development of TRPV1 antagonists|antagonists]].{{medcn|date=January 2017}}

==Use==
Pepper spray typically comes in canisters, which are often small enough to be carried or [[concealed weapon|concealed]] in a pocket or purse. Pepper spray can also be purchased concealed in items such as [[finger ring|rings]]. There are also [[Pepper-spray projectile|pepper spray projectiles]] available, which can be fired from a [[paintball gun]]. It has been used for years against demonstrators. Many such canisters also contain dyes, either visible or UV-reactive, to mark an attacker's skin or clothing to enhance identification by police.

==Legality==
{{Refimprove section|date=September 2011}}
Pepper spray is banned for use in war by Article I.5 of the [[Chemical Weapons Convention]], which bans the use of all [[riot control]] agents in warfare whether [[death|lethal]] or less-than-lethal.&lt;ref name=OPCW&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opcw.org/about-chemical-weapons/types-of-chemical-agent/riot-control-agents/|title=Riot Control Agents|accessdate=20 November 2011|publisher= Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, when pepper spray is used in the workplace, OSHA requires a pepper spray "Material Safety Data Sheet" (MSDS) be available to all employees.&lt;ref name=MSDS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osha.gov/dsg/hazcom/index.html|title=Hazard Communication|accessdate=13 December 2012|publisher= US Department of Labor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

** The [[Scoville scale|Scoville]] rating of these sprays are 500,000 (sabre MK9 HVS unit) and 2,000,000 (Sabre, cell buster fog delivery).

==Notable civilian use advocates==
In June 2002, West Australian resident Rob Hall was convicted for using a canister of pepper spray to break up an altercation between two guests at his home in Midland. Despite being sentenced to a good behavior bond and granted a spent conviction order, Hall appealed to the Supreme Court, and Justice Christine Wheeler ruled in Hall's favor, thereby legalizing pepper spray in the state on a case-by-case basis for those who are able to show a reasonable excuse.&lt;ref name="Anne Calverley 2003"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Hall v Collins'' [2003] WASCA 74 (4 April 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 March 2012, an individual "dressed in black including a black scarf wrapped around his or her face" entered the public gallery of the New South Wales Legislative Council and launched a paper plane into the air in the form of a petition to Police Minister Mike Gallacher calling on the government to allow civilians to carry capsicum spray.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tovey |first=Josephine |url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/flight-of-the-macquarie-street-ninja-20120315-1v7ho.html |title=Flight of the MacQuarie Street Ninja |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=March 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable use by law enforcement==
* At University of California, Davis in the United States, the [[UC Davis pepper-spray incident]] occurred on November 18, 2011. During a demonstration at the campus, university police pepper-sprayed a group of demonstrators as they were seated on a path.

'''''Philippines v. China''''' ([[Permanent Court of Arbitration|PCA]] case number 2013–19), also known as the '''South China Sea Arbitration''', was an arbitration case brought by the [[Philippines|Republic of the Philippines]] against the [[People's Republic of China]] under Annex VII to the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]] (UNCLOS) concerning certain issues in the [[South China Sea]] including the legality of China's [[Nine-dash line|"nine-dotted line" claim]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = https://www.pcacases.com/web/sendAttach/1503 |title = Arbitration between the Republic of the Philippines and the People's Republic of China |publisher = Permanent Court of Arbitration |publication-date = 15 October 2015 |access-date = 13 January 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{POV section|talk=Background section violates NPOV|date=September 2016}}

The dispute has been affected by the fact that, after [[Japan]] renounced all claims to the [[Spratly Islands]] and other conquered islands and territories in the [[Treaty of San Francisco]] and Treaty of Peace with the [[Republic of China]] (Taiwan) signed on 8 September 1951, it did not indicate successor states&lt;ref name="taiwandocuments.org"&gt;{{cite web |ref = harv |year = 2013 |url = http://www.taiwandocuments.org/sanfrancisco01.htm |title = Treaty of Peace with Japan |publisher = Taiwan Documents Project |accessdate = 19 November 2013 }} See also: United Nations Treaty Series 1952 (reg. no. 1832), vol. 136, pp. 45&amp;ndash;164.&lt;/ref&gt; since China was not invited to the treaty talks held in San Francisco. In reaction to that, on 15 August, the Chinese government issued the Declaration on the Draft Peace Treaty with Japan by the US and the UK and on the San Francisco Conference by the then Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai, reitirating China's sovereignty over the archipelagos in the South China Sea, including the [[Spratly Islands]], and protesting about the absence of any provisions in the draft on who shall take over the South China Sea islands following Japan's renouncement of all rights, title and claim to them. It reiterated that "the Chinese government of the day had taken over those islands" and that the PRC's rightful sovereignty "shall remain intact".&lt;ref name=fuying&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nationalinterest.org/feature/south-china-sea-how-we-got-stage-16118|title=South China Sea: How We Got to This Stage|year=2016|last1=Ying|first1=Fu|last2=Wu|first2=Shicun}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 April 1952, the United States presided over the signing of the [[Treaty of Taipei|Treaty of Peace between Japan and the Republic of China]]. Article 2 of the document provided that "It is recognized that under Article 2 of the Treaty of Peace which Japan signed at the city of San Francisco on 8 September 1951 (hereinafter referred to as the San Francisco Treaty), Japan has renounced all right, title, and claim to Taiwan (Formosa) and Penghu (the Pescadores) as well as the Spratly Islands and the Paracel Islands."&lt;ref name=fuying/&gt;

The [[Philippines]] bases its claim on its geographical proximity to the Spratly Islands.&lt;ref name = "BBC" /&gt;

In May 1956, the dispute escalated after [[Filipino people|Filipino national]] [[Tomas Cloma]] and his followers settled on the islands and declared the territory as "Freedomland", now known as [[Kalayaan, Palawan|Kalayaan]] for himself and later requested to make the territory a protectorate of the Philippines.&lt;ref name="globalsecurity.org"&gt;{{cite web |ref=harv|year= 2013|url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/spratly-conflict.htm|title = Spratly Islands Conflicting Claims|publisher = Global Security| accessdate = 19 November 2013 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tomas Cloma even stole China (ROC)'s national flag from the Taiping Island. In July 1956, he apologized officially for his act and he surrendered the flag he stole to China's embassy in Manila. On 2 October 1956, he wrote a letter and ensured he would not make further training voyages or landings in the territorial waters of China (ROC).&lt;ref name=kuen&gt;{{cite book |last=Fu |first=Kuen-Chen |title=South China Sea: Conflict Or Cooperation? |url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMBLEjg86pw}}{{time needed|date=July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philippine troops were sent to three of the islands in 1968,&lt;ref name="globalsecurity.org" /&gt; when the Philippines were under President [[Ferdinand Marcos]]. In the 1970s, some countries began to invade and occupy islands and reefs in the Spratlys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2016-06/06/c_135417018.htm|title=China Voice: South China Sea arbitration lacks legal basis|publisher=Xinhua }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinaconsulatesf.org/eng/zgxw/t1287358.htm|title=Wang Yi on the South China Sea Issue At the ASEAN Regional Forum|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Spratlys were placed under the jurisdiction of the province of Palawan in 1978.&lt;ref name="globalsecurity.org"/&gt;

The [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) claims it is entitled to the Paracel and Spratly Islands because they were seen as integral parts of the [[Ming dynasty]].&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; China and Taiwan have these same territorial claims.&lt;ref name ="BBC"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-13748349 |title=Q&amp;A: South China Sea dispute|work=[[BBC]] News|date=15 May 2013|accessdate=19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Taiwan|Republic of China (Taiwan)]] took control of the largest island - [[Taiping Island]] - in the group since 1946.&lt;ref name="globalsecurity.org"/&gt;

[[Vietnam]] states that the islands have belonged to it since the 17th century, using historical documents of ownership as evidence.&lt;ref name = "BBC" /&gt; [[Hanoi]] began to occupy the westernmost islands during this period.&lt;ref name = "BBC" /&gt;

In the early 1970s, [[Malaysia]] joined the dispute by claiming the islands nearest to it.&lt;ref name="Valencia 1999"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gqOKE2aI5roC&amp;pg=PA36&amp;dq=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=SVqLUv_qIcWq7QbFrIHoCg&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%20malaysia's%20claim&amp;f=false| last1 =Valencia|first1= Mark J.| first2=Jon M. |last2=Van Dyke|first3=Noel A. |last3=Ludwig| authorlink = | title = Sharing the Resources of the South China Sea|year=1999|pages=36&amp;ndash;38 | publisher = [[University of Hawaii Press]]| isbn= 9780824818814 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Brunei]] also extended its [[exclusive economic zone]], claiming [[Louisa Reef]].&lt;ref name="Valencia 1999"/&gt;

===Optional exceptions to applicability of compulsory procedure===
Article 298 of Section 3 of Part XV of the Convention provides optional exceptions to applicability of compulsory procedures provided in Section 2. China made declaration in accordance with the [[UN Convention on the Law of the Sea]] in 2006 not to accept any of the procedures provided for in section 2 of Part XV of the Convention. Many countries including the United Kingdom, Australia, Italy, France, Canada, and Spain made similar declarations to reject any of the procedures provided for in sections 2 of Part XV of the Convention with respect to the different categories of disputes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/convention_declarations.htm|title=Declarations or Statements upon UNCLOS ratification|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2016-05/05/c_135334841.htm|title=Stop meddling in South China Sea dispute, Chinese diplomat demands|publisher=Xinhua }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Philippines contended that the "nine-dotted line" claim by China is invalid because it violates the UNCLOS agreements about [[exclusive economic zone]]s and [[territorial sea]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.pcacases.com/web/view/7 |title = The Republic of the Philippines v.

China refused to participate in the arbitration, stating that several treaties with the Philippines stipulate that bilateral negotiations be used to resolve border disputes. It also accuses the Philippines of violating the voluntary Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea, made in 2002 between [[ASEAN]] and China, which also stipulated bilateral negotiations as the means of resolving border and other disputes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Torode |first=Greg |url = https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/09/27/us-china-philippines-idUSBRE98Q0BX20130927 |title = Philippines South China Sea legal case against China gathers pace |publisher=Reuters |date=27 September 2013 |accessdate=24 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://english.cntv.cn/program/newsupdate/20130719/104385.shtml |title=China rejects arbitration on disputed islands in S.China Sea CCTV News - CNTV English |date= |accessdate=24 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.asean.org/?static_post=declaration-on-the-conduct-of-parties-in-the-south-china-sea |title = DECLARATION ON THE CONDUCT OF PARTIES IN THE SOUTH CHINA SEA|publisher = [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] |date = 14 May 2012 |access-date = 14 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; China issued a position paper in December 2014 arguing the dispute was not subject to arbitration because it was ultimately a matter of sovereignty, not exploitation rights.&lt;ref&gt;Ben Blanchard (24 July 2015),[https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/07/24/southchinasea-china-usa-idUSL3N1043AM20150724 China also says U.S. is trying to influence Philippines' sea case] Reuters.&lt;/ref&gt; Its refusal will not prevent the PCA tribunal from proceeding with the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://kluwerarbitrationblog.com/blog/2013/08/28/an-update-on-the-philippines-china-unclos-arbitration/ |title = Philippines-China UNCLOS arbitration moving forward without Chinese participation |first=Luke Eric |last=Peterson |publisher=Kluwer Arbitration Blog |date=28 August 2013 |accessdate = 24 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the award ruling, the PRC issued a statement rejecting it as 'null' and having decided not to abide by the arbitral tribunal's decision, said it will "ignore the ruling".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news |url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-07-13/philippines-celebrates-victory-in-south-china-sea-case/7623440 |title = Philippines celebrates victory in South China Sea case, despite China's refusal to accept result |last=Harvey |first=Adam |date = 13 July 2016 |work=ABC News |access-date = 13 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== {{flagdeco|Vietnam|size=30px}} Vietnamese stance ===
On 11 December 2014, [[Vietnam]] filed a statement to the tribunal which put forward three points: 1) Vietnam supports the filing of this case by the Philippines, 2) it rejects China's "nine-dashed line", and 3) it asks the PCA tribunal to take note of Vietnam's claims on certain islands such as the [[Paracel Islands|Paracels]].&lt;ref name=vietnam&gt;{{cite news |url = http://mobile.bloomberg.com/news/2014-12-12/south-china-sea-tensions-flare-as-vietnam-files-stance-to-court.html |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141213103712/http://mobile.bloomberg.com/news/2014-12-12/south-china-sea-tensions-flare-as-vietnam-files-stance-to-court.html |archivedate=13 December 2014 |work=Bloomberg |title=South China Sea Tensions Flare as Vietnam Files Stance to Court }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other stances===
Brunei sent its own UNCLOS claim through a preliminary submission prior to the arbitration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.un.org/depts/los/clcs_new/submissions_files/preliminary/brn2009preliminaryinformation.pdf |title = Brunei Darussalam's Preliminary Submission concerning the Outer Limits of its Continental Shelf |accessdate = 19 November 2013 |publisher = [[United Nations]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2009, Malaysia and Vietnam, as well as Vietnam alone, filed claims to the [[International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea]] with regard to the islands {{Clarify|reason=which ones?|date=July 2016}}. This was in relation to extending their claimed continental shelves and Exclusive Economic Zones. The People's Republic of China rejected the claims since those violate the "nine-dotted line". The Philippines challenged the Malaysian claim stating that the claims overlap with the [[North Borneo dispute]].&lt;ref name= "Malaysia Vietnam" /&gt;

[[Indonesia]] made a comment on China's claim by saying that the features are rocks and cannot sustain life, effectively calling the Chinese claim invalid. The Philippines echoed Indonesia's claims, further stating that the islands belong to them through geographic proximity.&lt;ref name = "Malaysia Vietnam" &gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.un.org/Depts/los/clcs_new/submissions_files/submission_mysvnm_33_2009.htm |title=Submissions to the Commission: Joint submission by Malaysia and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam

==Arbitration==

===Hearings===
On 7 July 2015, case hearings began with the Philippines asking the tribunal to invalidate China's claims. The hearings were also attended by observers from [[Indonesia]], [[Japan]], [[Malaysia]], [[Thailand]] and [[Vietnam]].&lt;ref name=APstory1 /&gt; The case has been compared to ''[[Nicaragua v. United States]]'' due to similarities of the parties involved such as that a [[developing country]] is challenging a [[Permanent members of the United Nations Security Council|permanent member]] of the [[United Nations Security Council]] in an arbitral tribunal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/98981-philippines-lawyer-china-paul-reichler-profile | title=PH lawyer vs China: 'Giant slayer' who defeated US | work=Rappler | date=11 July 2015 | accessdate=12 July 2015 | author=Esmaquel, Paterno II}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 October 2015, the PCA tribunal ruled that it had the power to hear the case. It agreed to take up seven of the 15 submissions made by Manila, in particular whether Scarborough Shoal and low-tide areas like Mischief Reef can be considered islands. It set aside seven more pointed claims mainly accusing Beijing of acting unlawfully to be considered at the next hearing on the case's merits. It also told Manila to narrow down the scope of its final request that the judges order that "China shall desist from further unlawful claims and activities."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The arbitral tribunal scheduled the hearing on merits of the case from 24 to 30 November 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.update.ph/2015/11/tribunal-schedules-hearing-on-merits-of-ph-arbitration-case-against-china/106|title = Tribunal schedules hearing on merits of PH arbitration case against China|date = 10 November 2015|work = Update.PH}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility ===
On 29 October 2015, the PCA published the award by the tribunal on Jurisdiction and Admissibility&lt;ref name=PCA20151029/&gt; for the case. The tribunal found that it has jurisdiction to consider the following seven Philippines' Submissions. (Each number is the Philippines' Submissions number.) The tribunal reserved consideration of its jurisdiction to rule on Nos. 1, 2, 5, 8, 9, 12, and 14.

*No.3 Philippines'position that Scarborough Shoal is a rock under Article 121(3).
*No.4 Philippines' position that Mischief Reef, Second Thomas Shoal, and Subi Reef are low tide elevations that do not generate entitlement to maritime zones.
*No.6 Whether Gaven Reef and McKennan Reef (including Hughes Reef) are low-tide elevations "that do not generate any maritime entitlements of their own".
*No.7 Whether Johnson Reef, Cuarteron Reef, and Fiery Cross Reef do or do not generate an entitlement to an exclusive economic zone or continental shelf.
*No.10 "premised on [the] fact that China has unlawfully prevented Philippine fishermen from carrying out traditional fishing activities within the territorial sea of Scarborough Shoal."
*No.11 "China's failure to protect and preserve the marine environment at these two shoals [Scarborough Shoal and Second Thomas Shoal]."
*No.13 Philippines’ protest against China's "purported law enforcement activities as violating the Convention on the International Regulations for the Prevention of Collisions at Sea and also violating UNCLOS".

The tribunal stated in the award that there are continuing disputes in all of the 15 submissions from the Philippines,&lt;ref name="PCA20151029"/&gt; but for submissions such as No.3, No.4, No.6 and No.7, no known claims from the Philippines prior to the initiation of this arbitration exist, and that China was not aware of (nor had previously opposed) such claims prior to the initiation of arbitration. The [[Chinese Society of International Law]] (CSIL) has stated that the tribunal was trying to hide its incapability to prove that maritime entitlements of the nine features constitute the essence of the disputes.&lt;ref name="csil" /&gt;

For Submissions No.8 to No.14, the tribunal held the view that the lawfulness of China's maritime activities in the South China Sea is not related to sovereignty. CSIL has asserted that the disagreements do concern territorial sovereignty, and constitute no dispute with respect to the claims advanced by the Philippines.&lt;ref name="csil" /&gt;

=== Award ===
On 12 July 2016, the Permanent Court of Arbitration published an [[arbitration award]] by the tribunal which it states is final and binding as set out in the Convention.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Press release: The South China Sea Arbitration |date=12 July 2016 |publisher=Permanent Court of Arbitration |url = https://pca-cpa.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/175/2016/07/PH-CN-20160712-Press-Release-No-11-English.pdf |quote = The Award is final and binding, as set out in Article 296 of the Convention and Article 11 of Annex VII. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conclusions expressed in the award included the following:
: Regarding the "Nine-Dash Line" and China's claim in the maritime areas of the South China Sea&lt;ref name="PCA Award"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.pcacases.com/pcadocs/PH-CN%20-%2020160712%20-%20Award.pdf |title=Award |publisher=Permanent Court of Arbitration |date=12 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* The [UNCLOS] Convention defines the scope of maritime entitlements in the South China Sea, which may not extend beyond the limits imposed therein.{{refn|PCA Award, Section V(F)(d)(277), p.116.&lt;ref name="PCA Award" /&gt;}}
:* China's claims to historic rights, or other sovereign rights or jurisdiction, with respect to the maritime areas of the South China Sea encompassed by the relevant part of the 'nine-dash line' are contrary to the Convention and without lawful effect to the extent that they exceed the geographic and substantive limits of China's maritime entitlements under the Convention. The Convention superseded any historic rights or other sovereign rights or jurisdiction in excess of the limits imposed therein.{{refn|PCA Award, Section V(F)(d)(278), p. 117.&lt;ref name="PCA Award" /&gt;}}
: Regarding the status of features as above/below water at high tide (Submissions no. 4 and 6)
:* High-tide features: (a) Scarborough Shoal, (b) Cuarteron Reef, (c) Fiery Cross Reef, (d) Johnson Reef, (e) McKennan Reef, and (f) Gaven Reef (North).{{refn|PCA Award, Section VI(B)(5)(d)(382), p.174.&lt;ref name="PCA Award" /&gt;}}
:* Low-tide elevations: (a) Hughes Reef, (b) Gaven Reef (South), (c) Subi Reef, (d) Mischief Reef, (e) Second Thomas Shoal.{{refn|PCA Award, Section VI(B)(5)(d)(383), p. 174.&lt;ref name="PCA Award" /&gt;}}
:* Hughes Reef lies within 12 nautical miles of the high-tide features on McKennan Reef and Sin Cowe Island, Gaven Reef (South) lies within 12 nautical miles of the high-tide features at Gaven Reef (North) and Namyit Island, and that Subi Reef lies within 12 nautical miles of the high-tide feature of Sandy Cay on the reefs to the west of Thitu.{{refn|PCA Award, Section VI(B)(5)(d)(384), p. 174.&lt;ref name="PCA Award" /&gt;}}
: Regarding the status of features as rocks/islands (Submissions no. 3, 5, and 7)
:* Scarborough Shoal contains, within the meaning of Article 121(1) of the Convention, naturally formed areas of land, surrounded by water, which are above water at high tide. However, under Article 121(3) of the Convention, the high-tide features at Scarborough Shoal are rocks that cannot sustain human habitation or economic life of their own and accordingly shall have no exclusive economic zone or continental shelf.{{refn|PCA Award, Section VI(C)(5)(f)(643), p. 259.&lt;ref name="PCA Award" /&gt;}}
:* Johnson Reef, Cuarteron Reef, and Fiery Cross Reef contain, within the meaning of Article 121(1) of the Convention, naturally formed areas of land, surrounded by water, which are above water at high tide. However, for purposes of Article 121(3) of the Convention, the high-tide features at Johnson Reef, Cuarteron Reef, and Fiery Cross Reef are rocks that cannot sustain human habitation or economic life of their own and accordingly shall have no exclusive economic zone or continental shelf.{{refn|PCA Award, Section VI(C)(5)(f)(644), p. 259.&lt;ref name="PCA Award" /&gt;}}
:* The high-tide features at Gaven Reef (North) and McKennan Reef are rocks that cannot sustain human habitation or economic life of their own and accordingly shall have no exclusive economic zone or continental shelf.{{refn|PCA Award, Section VI(C)(5)(f)(645), p.259.&lt;ref name="PCA Award" /&gt;}}
:*Mischief Reef and Second Thomas Shoal are both low-tide elevations that generate no maritime zones of their own [and] that none of the high-tide features in the Spratly Islands are capable of sustaining human habitation or an economic life of their own within the meaning of those terms in Article 121(3) of the Convention. All of the high-tide features in the Spratly Islands are therefore legally rocks for purposes of Article 121(3) and do not generate entitlements to an exclusive economic zone or continental shelf. There is, accordingly, no possible entitlement by China to any maritime zone in the area of either Mischief Reef or Second Thomas Shoal and no jurisdictional obstacle to the tribunal's consideration of the Philippines' Submission No. 5.{{refn|PCA Award, Section VI(C)(5)(f)(646), p.259-260.&lt;ref name="PCA Award" /&gt;}}
:* Both Mischief Reef and Second Thomas Shoal are located within 200 nautical miles of the Philippines’ coast on the island of Palawan and are located in an area that is not overlapped by the entitlements generated by any maritime feature claimed by China. It follows, therefore, that, as between the Philippines and China, Mischief Reef and Second Thomas Shoal form part of the exclusive economic zone and continental shelf of the Philippines.{{refn|PCA Award, Section VI(C)(5)(f)(647), p. 260.&lt;ref name="PCA Award" /&gt;}}
: Regarding alleged interference with the Philippines' sovereign rights in its EEZ and continental shelf (Submission no. 8)
:* China has, through the operation of its marine surveillance vessels with respect to M/V Veritas Voyager on 1 to 2 March 2011 breached Article 77 of the Convention with respect to the Philippines' sovereign rights over the non-living resources of its continental shelf in the area of Reed Bank [and] that China has, by promulgating its 2012 moratorium on fishing in the South China Sea, without exception for areas of the South China Sea falling within the exclusive economic zone of the Philippines and without limiting the moratorium to Chinese flagged vessels, breached Article 56 of the Convention with respect to the Philippines’ sovereign rights over the living resources of its exclusive economic zone.{{refn|PCA Award, Section VII(A)(5)(c)(716), p. 286.&lt;ref name="PCA Award" /&gt;}}
: Regarding alleged failure to prevent Chinese nationals from exploiting the Philippines' living resources (Submission no. 9)
:* China has, through the operation of its marine surveillance vessels in tolerating and failing to exercise due diligence to prevent fishing by Chinese flagged vessels at Mischief Reef and Second Thomas Shoal in May 2013, failed to exhibit due regard for the Philippines' sovereign rights with respect to fisheries in its exclusive economic zone. Accordingly, China has breached its obligations under Article 58(3) of the Convention.{{refn|PCA Award, Section VII(B)(5)(d)(757), p.297.&lt;ref name="PCA Award" /&gt;}}
: Regarding China's actions in respect of traditional fishing at Scarborough Shoal (Submission no. 10)
:*China has, through the operation of its official vessels at Scarborough Shoal from May 2012 onwards, unlawfully prevented Filipino fishermen from engaging in traditional fishing at Scarborough Shoal.{{refn|PCA Award, Section VII(C)(5)(c)(814), p. 318.&lt;ref name="PCA Award" /&gt;}}
: Regarding alleged failure to protect and preserve )the marine environment (Submissions no. 11 and 12(B))
:* China has, through its toleration and protection of, and failure to prevent Chinese fishing vessels engaging in harmful harvesting activities of endangered species at Scarborough Shoal, Second Thomas Shoal and other features in the Spratly Islands, breached Articles 192 and 194(5) of the Convention.{{refn|PCA Award, Section VII(D)(5)(e)(992), p. 397.&lt;ref name="PCA Award" /&gt;}}
:* China has, through its island-building activities at Cuarteron Reef, Fiery Cross Reef, Gaven Reef (North), Johnson Reef, Hughes Reef, Subi Reef and Mischief Reef, breached Articles 192, 194(1), 194(5), 197, 123, and 206 of the Convention.{{refn|PCA Award, Section VII(D)(5)(e)(993), p. 397.&lt;ref name="PCA Award" /&gt;}}
:Regarding occupation and construction activities on Mischief Reef (Submission no. 12)
:*China has, through its construction of installations and artificial islands at Mischief Reef without the authorisation of the Philippines, breached Articles 60 and 80 of the Convention with respect to the Philippines' sovereign rights in its exclusive economic zone and continental shelf [and], as a low-tide elevation, Mischief Reef is not capable of appropriation.{{refn|PCA Award, Section VII(E)(5)(c)(1043), p. 415.&lt;ref name="PCA Award" /&gt;}}
:Regarding operation of law enforcement vessels in a dangerous manner (Submission no. 13)
:*China has, by virtue of the conduct of Chinese law enforcement vessels in the vicinity of Scarborough Shoal, created serious risk of collision and danger to Philippine vessels and personnel. The Tribunal finds China to have violated Rules 2, 6, 7, 8, 15, and 16 of the COLREGS and, as a consequence, to be in breach of Article 94 of the Convention.{{refn|PCA Award, Section VII(F)(5)(d)(1109), p. 435.&lt;ref name="PCA Award" /&gt;}}
: Regarding aggravation or extension of the dispute between the parties (Submission No. 14)
:* China has in the course of these proceedings aggravated and extended the disputes between the Parties through its dredging, artificial island-building, and construction activities [in several particulars itemized  in the award].{{refn|PCA Award, Section VIII(E)(4)(1181), p. 464.&lt;ref name="PCA Award" /&gt;}}
: Regarding the future conduct of the parties (Submission no. 15)
:* Both Parties are obliged to comply with the Convention, including its provisions regarding the resolution of disputes, and to respect the rights and freedoms of other States under the Convention. Neither Party contests this.{{refn|PCA Award, Section IX(D)(1201), p. 469.&lt;ref name="PCA Award" /&gt;}}

There are countries and multinational bodies that have expressed support or opposition to the Philippines' move to take the South China Sea dispute to the Permanent Court of Arbitration. These entities however may not necessarily support either sides when it comes to the ownership of the disputed area affected by the case.

====ASEAN====
Malaysia and Vietnam, who has territorial claims in the South China Sea, as well as Australia, Indonesia, Japan, Singapore and Thailand sent observers to the proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thediplomat.com/2015/12/amid-south-china-sea-tensions-japan-strengthes-ties-with-philippines-vietnam/|title=Amid South China Sea Tensions, Japan Strengthens Ties With Philippines, Vietnam|author1=Mina Pollmann|author2= The Diplomat|work=The Diplomat}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globalnation.inquirer.net/132852/7-countries-send-observers-to-monitor-ph-case-vs-china|title=7 countries send observers to monitor PH case vs China|first=Niña P.|last=Calleja|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2016, before the tribunal issued its ruling, Malaysia's foreign ministry released what it said was a joint statement of ASEAN expressing "serious concern" over land reclamation activities in the South China Sea. Within hours of issuing the statement, Malaysia announced that ASEAN wanted the statement retracted for "urgent amendments". Malaysian Foreign Ministry's Secretary General Othman Hashim later claimed that ASEAN's foreign ministers had "unanimously agreed" to the statement at a meeting, and that "Subsequent developments pertaining to the media statement took place after the departure of the ASEAN foreign ministers".&lt;ref&gt;[https://english.kyodonews.jp/news/2016/06/416964.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen later gave a speech condemning reports that Cambodia had had the statement retracted in order to please China, saying, "Cambodia will not be a puppet of anyone on the South China Sea issue."&lt;ref name="vosneutrality"&gt;[https://english.kyodonews.jp/news/2016/06/417263.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Hun Sen suggested the case was a "political conspiracy" and that the ruling "will not be fair",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.todayonline.com/world/asia/cambodian-pm-denies-role-asean-u-turn-south-china-sea|title=Hun Sen denies Cambodia caved in to Chinese pressure on Asean statement|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also said that "Cambodia will just choose to stay neutral on this issue."&lt;ref name="vosneutrality" /&gt; A few days after Hun Sen's speech, the Cambodian People's Party, which Hun Sen heads, issued a statement backing him. According to the statement, “The CPP would like to reject unjust allegations that Cambodia has destroyed the issuing of a joint statement from Asean on the issue of the South China Sea both in Kunming recently and in 2012.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.khmertimeskh.com/news/26488/cpp-backs-pm-on-south-china-sea/ |title = CPP Backs PM on South China Sea }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 July, shortly before the tribunal issued its verdict, Cambodia's foreign ministry issued a statement reiterating that Cambodia would not join any ASEAN statement on the verdict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfaic.gov.kh/?page=detail&amp;ctype=article&amp;id=1916&amp;lg=en|title=Statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation on Cambodia's Position over South China Sea|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin of the case is ''Pierringer v. Hogan''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1956523995404055605 Pierringer v. Hogan], 124 N.W.2d 106, 21 Wis.2d 182 (1963)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==

The '''Queensland Public Service''' provides [[public service]]s to the people of [[Queensland]], Australia on behalf of the [[Government of Queensland]]. Typically these are services that are deemed important by the government and which the government believes will be delivered less efficiently, effectively or cheaply if outsourced to the private marketplace.

== Organisation structure ==

The [[Queensland Premier]] selects a subset of the [[Members of the Queensland Legislative Assembly]] to be [[Ministers of State|ministers]] who collectively form the [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]]. Typically the ministers are members of the same political party as the premier or a closely aligned party. Each minister is assigned one or more portfolios (areas of responsibility), e.g.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = System of government {{!}} About Queensland and its government|url = http://www.qld.gov.au/about/how-government-works/system-of-government/|website = www.qld.gov.au|accessdate = 14 November 2015|first = |last = |publisher = [[Queensland Government]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* services for residents such as [[healthcare]] and [[education]]
* services to regulate business and promote the development of the economy, including the [[agriculture]], [[mining]], and [[tourism]] industries (three key export industries for Queensland)
* services that provide infrastructure such as [[transport]], [[public works]] and [[emergency service]]s
* services that underpin all of the above, such as [[treasury]] 
Each portfolio has an associated set of departments and agencies which work to provide a wide range of public services related to that portfolio and the administration of legislation related to that portfolio. The leader of each department is known as the [[Director-general|Director-General]], who is the chief executive officer for the department and reports to the relevant Minister.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Director-General then employs staff within the department to provide the services. The Directors-General and their staff are generally known collectively as the Queensland Public Service and the personnel are known as public servants.

Unlike Ministers, who are chosen by elections and political processes, Directors-General and their staff are traditionally selected on merit to positions which are independent of the elections and political processes. However, as some Ministers have felt their vision for their portfolios have been frustrated by a Director-General who did not embrace their vision, Directors-General are now sometimes replaced by an incoming Minister who makes their own appointment (often by invitation) of a person who the Minister believe shares their vision. While such Directors-General are technically public servants, they are generally regarded as political appointments and their tenure is often linked to the tenure of the Minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Premier sacks directors-general|url = http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/premier-annastacia-palaszczuk-sacks-directorsgeneral-20150225-13oulq.html|website = Brisbane Times|accessdate = 2015-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Statutory authorities ==
A [[statutory authority]] is an organisation established under separate legislation to manage a particular aspect of government administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.qld.gov.au/about/how-government-works/system-of-government/#_statutory-bodies|title=System of Government|publisher=Queensland Government|accessdate=14 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most statutory bodies have their own board of management, selected or appointed in different ways. However, all must report to a Minister.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Statutory authorities have varying degrees of independence to the government and public service. Some statutory authorities are dependent on government subsidies and grants and hence likely to very highly attuned to the wishes of the Minister and/or Director-General; others are funded in other ways (e.g. providing services) and enjoy greater independence as a consequence. However, as all statutory authorities exist under Queensland legislation, the Minister can assert control by changing the legislation within the [[Queensland Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.premiers.qld.gov.au/publications/categories/reviews/assets/part-a-report-independent-review-of-govt-bodies.pdf|title = A Public Interest Map: An Independent Review of Queensland Government Boards, Committees and Statutory Authorities|date = 1 December 2008|accessdate = 14 November 2015|website = |publisher = [[Queensland Government]]|last = Webbe|first = Simone|pages = 33–41|last2 = Weller|first2 = Pat}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strictly, employees of statutory authorities are not part of the Queensland Public Service, but where their positions are funded by the Queensland Government they are often treated as members of the Queensland Public Service for statistical and budgetary purposes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Statistics ==
At 30 June 2015, there were 243,163 staff (203,348.50 full-time equivalent) employees in 20 Queensland Government departments and 15 other organisations included for statistical purposes. The three largest government employers are [[Queensland Health]], the [[Department of Education and Training (Queensland)|Department of Education and Training]] and the [[Queensland Police Service]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.psc.qld.gov.au/publications/workforce-statistics/assets/qtly-workforce-profile-june15.pdf|title = Queensland Public Sector Quarterly Workforce Profile as at June 2015|date = |accessdate = 14 November 2015|website = |publisher = [[Queensland Government]]|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''ribbon of Saint George''' (also known as '''Saint George's ribbon''' and the '''Georgian ribbon'''; {{lang-ru|Георгиевская ленточка}}, ''Georgiyevskaya lentochka'', not to be confused with the [[Guards Ribbon]]) is a widely recognized symbol of remembrance of the Soviet people who fought in the Great Patriotic War, WWII. The ribbon consists of a black and orange bicolour pattern, with three black and two orange stripes. It appears as a component of many high [[military decorations]] awarded by the [[Russian Empire]], and the current [[Russia|Russian Federation]].

The stripes signify the fire and fog of war. While the symbol is primarily related to WWII, it has recently{{when|date=November 2018}} become more associated with Russian nationalism.
The symbol was promoted by the post-soviet Russian state as a way to unify people and remember and respect those that fought.

It was also promoted in 2005 as a response to the liberal [[Orange Revolution]] in [[Ukraine]].&lt;ref name=kp5&gt;{{cite news|title=Ukraine breaks from Russia in commemorating victory|url=http://www.kyivpost.com/content/kyiv-post-plus/ukraine-breaks-from-russia-in-commemorating-victory-388068.html|accessdate=8 May 2015|agency=Kyiv Post| quote=""In the 1960-70s there were no St. George's Ribbons seen during the Victory Day parades.

In Russia, the ribbon of Saint George is also used by civilians as a [[patriotism|patriotic]] symbol and as a symbol of [[Loyalty|public support]] to the [[Government of Russia|Russian government]], particularly since 2014.&lt;ref name=OD150501&gt;{{cite news |url= https://opendemocracy.net/od-russia/oleg-kashin/hunting-swastikas-in-russia |title= Hunting swastikas in Russia |first= Oleg |last= Kashin |authorlink=Oleg Kashin|publisher= OpenDemocracy.net |date= 1 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Ukraine and the [[Baltic states]] ([[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]]), the symbol has become widely associated with [[Russophilia|Russian nationalist]] and separatist sentiment.&lt;ref name=RFE150507&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.rferl.org/content/victory-day-st-george-ribbon-orange-and-black/26999911.html |title=For Victory Day, Post-Soviets Show Their Colors – Just Not Orange And Black |first= Ihar |last= Karney |first2= Daisy |last2= Sindelar |work=[[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]] |date= 7 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Georgian ribbon emerged as part of the [[Order of St. George|Order of Saint George]], established in 1769 as the highest military decoration of [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]] (and re-established in 1998 by [[Decree of the President of Russia|Presidential decree]] signed by then [[President of Russia]] [[Boris Yeltsin]]). While the Order of Saint George was normally not a collective award, the ribbon was sometimes granted to regiments and units that performed brilliantly during wartime and constituted an integral part of some collective battle honours (such as [[Colours, standards and guidons|banners]] and [[Pennon|pennant]]s). When not awarded the full Order, some distinguished officers were granted ceremonial swords, adorned with the Georgian ribbon.&lt;ref name="ria"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://en.rian.ru/analysis/20070611/66883914.html|title=National symbolism in Russia: the old and the new |work=[[RIA Novosti]] |author=Anatoly Korolev and Dmitry Kosyrev |date=11 June 2007 |accessdate=23 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1806, distinctive Georgian banners were introduced as a further battle honour awarded to meritorious Guards and [[Russian Imperial Guard|Leib Guard]] regiments. The pike on which these flags were mounted was topped by the [[Cross of Saint George]] and adorned with 4,44&amp;nbsp;cm wide Georgian ribbons. It remained the highest collective military award in the [[Imperial Russian Army]] until the Revolution in 1917. It is worth noting that the tsarist version was yellow and black, not orange and black like the revived Soviet version.&lt;ref name="facts"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://russian7.ru/2014/04/5-faktov-o-georgievskoj-lente/ |script-title=ru:5 фактов о георгиевской ленте |trans-title=5 Facts about the Saint George Ribbon |work=Russia7 |author=Alexei Rudevich |date=25 April 2014 |accessdate=23 February 2015 |language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The symbolism of the orange and black (or yellow and black) is thought to represent fire and gunpowder of war, or the death and resurrection of [[Saint George]], or the colours of the original [[Coat of arms of the Russian Empire|Russian imperial coat of arms]] (black eagle on a golden background).&lt;ref name="facts"/&gt; Another theory is that it is, in fact, German in origin, derived from the [[or (tincture)|or]] and [[Sable (heraldry)|sable]] stripe patterns found on the heraldry of the [[House of Ascania]], from which Catherine II originated, or the County of [[Ballenstedt]], the house's ancient demesne.&lt;ref name="ribbon"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://sovet.geraldika.ru/article/39938 |script-title=ru:Георгиевская ленточка: победа прихоти над культурой |trans-title=Ribbon of Saint George: fads prevail over culture |work=Saint George |author=Mikhail Medvedev |date=8 May 2017   |accessdate=3 September 2017 |language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The title of the Soviet Guards was first introduced on 18 September 1941 in accordance with the decision of the Headquarters of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief ({{lang-ru|Ставка Верховного Главнокомандующего}}, [[Stavka]], ''Verkhovnogo Glavnokomanduyushchego'') and by the order No. 308 of the [[People's Commissar]] of Defense for the distinguished services during the [[Yelnya Offensive]]. The 100th, 127th, 153rd and 161st Rifle Divisions were renamed into the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th Guards Divisions, respectively. The units and formations nominated for the Soviet Guard title received special Guards banner in accordance with the decision of the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet]] of the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. On 21 May 1942, the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR|Presidium]] of the [[Supreme Soviet of the USSR]] introduced Guards [[Military rank|rank]]s and Guards [[badge]]s to be worn of the right side of the chest. Both included the Georgian ribbon pattern. In June 1943, they introduced the Guards Red Banners for the land forces and in February 1944 – for the naval forces. Georgian ribbons adorned the banners exactly as in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="facts"/&gt;

Established on 8 November 1943, the [[Order of Glory]] (''Orden Slavy'') was an [[Order (decoration)|order]] of the Soviet Union. It was awarded to non-commissioned officers and the rank-and-file of the armed forces, as well as to junior lieutenants of the air force, for bravery in the face of the enemy. The ribbon of the Order was orange with three black stripes – the same as that of the [[Cross of Saint George]].

One of the most honourable medals in the Soviet Union, the medal [[Medal "For the Victory over Germany in the Great Patriotic War 1941–1945"|"For the Victory over Germany"]] ({{lang-ru|За победу над Германией}}, ''Za pobedu nad Germaniyey'') also features Saint George stripes. It was awarded to all the soldiers and officers who participated in the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] campaigns, and was the first award to be universally granted to all the veterans, for the most part, right after the end of the war. Afther war by [[Jubilee Medal "Forty Years of Victory in the Great Patriotic War 1941–1945"]] 1945–1985.

The ribbon – along with the [[Flag of Russia|Russian tricolored flag]] and the [[Russian Navy Ensign]] – was also used by the [[Anti-Sovietism|anti-Soviet]] [[Russian Liberation Army]] that fought alongside [[Nazi Germany]] during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=kp5 /&gt;

== 2005 Georgievskaya Lenta Action ==
In 2005, the 60th anniversary of [[Victory Day (May 9)|Victory Day]], news agency [[RIA Novosti]] and a youth civic organization launched a campaign that called on volunteers to distribute ribbons in the streets ahead of Victory Day.&lt;ref name=kp5 /&gt;&lt;ref name="ria"/&gt; Since then the ribbon is worn by civilians in Russia and other former republics of the Soviet Union as an act of commemoration and remembrance.&lt;ref name="ria"/&gt; For the naming of the ribbons the [[diminutive]] form is used: георгиевская ленточка (''georgiyevskaya lentochka'', "small George ribbon").&lt;ref name="ria"/&gt; Since 2005 the ribbon is distributed every year all over Russia, and around the world in the preparation for 9 May and is on that day widely to be seen on wrists, lapels, and cars.&lt;ref name=grps2005/&gt;&lt;ref name="ria"/&gt; The motto that goes with it is "We remember, we are proud!"&lt;ref name="ria"/&gt;

[[Yulia Latynina]] and other journalists have speculated the Russian government introduced the ribbon as a [[public relations]] response to the 2004 [[Orange Revolution]] in [[Ukraine]] in which demonstrators had adopted [[orange ribbon]]s as their symbol.&lt;ref name=kp5 /&gt;&lt;ref name=grps2005/&gt;

During the [[2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine|events of 2014 in Ukraine]] it was used by [[Antimaidan]] activists and pro-Russian population of Ukraine (especially in the south-east regions) as a symbol of pro-Russian and separatist sentiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rferl.org/content/russia-ukraine-st-george-ribbon-wwii-commemoration/25375013.html |title=Kyiv Ditches Separatist-Linked Ribbon As WWII Symbol |publisher=[[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]] |first=Claire |last=Bigg |date=May 6, 2014 |accessdate=2014-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=colUWP&gt;{{cite web |last=Sindelar |first=Daisy |title=What's Orange and Black and Bugging Ukraine? |url=http://www.rferl.org/content/ukraine-colorado-beetle-separatists/25365793.html |work=[[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]] |date=April 28, 2014 |accessdate=18 May 2014}}&lt;br&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/05/world/europe/kievs-reins-weaken-as-chaos-spreads.html?_r=0 Ukraine’s Reins Weaken as Chaos Spreads], [[The New York Times]] (4 May 2014)&lt;br&gt;{{uk icon}} [http://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2014/06/18/7029494/ Lyashko in Lviv poured green], [[Ukrayinska Pravda]] (18 June 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; The ribbon is also worn by members of the [[Donbass People's Militia]] paramilitary group. [[Euromaidan]] activists started making derogatory reference to the Ribbon of Saint George as the "Colorado Ribbon", as the colors of the ribbon coincide with the colors of a [[Colorado potato beetle]].&lt;ref name=colUWP/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mk.ru/politics/article/2014/03/31/1006237-aktivistka-maydana-quoteto-ya-sozhgla-tri-koloradskie-lentyiquot.html|script-title=ru:Активистка Майдана: "Это я сожгла три колорадские ленты"|date=March 30, 2014|publisher=[[Moskovskij Komsomolets]]|language=Russian|accessdate=13 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time the term "Kolorad" has become an [[ethnic slur]] for Russians.&lt;ref&gt;[https://themoscowtimes.com/articles/talking-smack-about-ukrainians-and-russians-37647 "Talking Smack About Ukrainians and Russians"], ''[[The Moscow Times]]'', July 24, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2014 the veterans of [[Kropyvnytskyi|Kirovohrad]] banned the symbol from [[Victory Day]] celebrations "in order to prevent provocations between the activists of different movements". Instead, only Ukrainian state symbols would be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unian.net/society/910959-kirovogradskie-veteranyi-otkazalis-ot-georgievskih-lent-na-9-maya.html |title=Кировоградские ветераны отказались от георгиевских лент на 9 мая : Новости УНИАН |publisher=Unian.net |date=2014-04-23 |accessdate=2014-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next month [[Cherkasy]] urged veterans and supporters not to wear the ribbon or any other party symbols.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unian.net/politics/911947-predsedatel-cherkasskoy-oga-prizval-otkazatsya-na-9-maya-ot-georgievskih-lent.html |title=Председатель Черкасской ОГА призвал отказаться на 9 мая от георгиевских лент : Новости УНИАН |publisher=Unian.net |date=2014-04-26 |accessdate=2014-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ukrainian government [[Victory Day over Nazism in World War II|replaced the ribbon]] with a red-and-black [[remembrance poppy]], like those associated with [[Remembrance Day]] in Western Europe in 2014.&lt;ref name=kp5 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Yaffa |first=Joshua |url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/newsdesk/2014/05/vladimir-putins-victory-day-in-crimea.html |title=Vladimir Putin's Victory Day in Crimea |publisher=The New Yorker |date= |accessdate=2014-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 16, 2017 the St. George Ribbon was officially banned in the country, with those who produce or promote the symbol subject to fine or temporary arrest. According to Speaker [[Andriy Parubiy]], the symbol had become a symbol of "Russia's war and occupation of Ukraine."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-bans-st-georges-ribbon-separatist-symbol/28491961.html|title=Ukrainian Lawmakers Back Ban On Ribbon Embraced As Patriotic Symbol In Russia|last=|first=|date=2017-05-16|website=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Belarus===
On 5 May 2014, the [[Belarusian Republican Youth Union]] encouraged activists not to use the ribbon. Other officials reported that the decision not to use the symbol was related to the situation in Ukraine, "where the ribbon is used by militants and terrorists".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.svoboda.org/a/25379021.html|title=Георгиевская лента напугала Лукашенко|publisher=|accessdate=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In time for Victory Day 2015, the ribbon's colors were replaced by the red, green and white from the [[Flag of Belarus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thanhniennews.com/world/russians-embrace-kremlinbacked-wwii-ribbon-42876.html|title=Russians embrace Kremlin-backed WWII ribbon|publisher=|accessdate=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko arrived on 7 May 2015 in Moscow with a Saint George ribbon combined with the flag of Belarus placed on the lapel of his jacket, thus showing his personal positive attitude to the ribbon.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

===Canada===
During preparation for the first Victory Day parade in the Canadian city of [[Winnipeg]] on 10 May 2014, the Russian embassy distributed Ribbons of Saint George to participants. The move was considered controversial in view of the ongoing events in Ukraine with the [[Ukrainian Canadian Congress]] calling the ribbon a "symbol of terrorism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/local/ethnic-tension-258585441.html|publisher=WinnipegFreePress|date=9 May 2014|accessdate=9 May 2014|title=Pro-Russia parade planned for city riles local Ukrainians}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Возложение венка к Могиле Неизвестного Солдата - 02.jpg|thumb|Kazakh President [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]] during the [[2015 Moscow Victory Day Parade]]]]

===Kazakhstan===
Some parties made statements intended to discourage the use of the ribbon in Kazakhstan in 2014 for Victory Day celebrations, suggesting that red (of the Red Army) and turquoise (the national color of Kazakhstan) should be used instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dialog.kz/articles/day-zhest/2014-05-06/nazarbaev-zapretil-georgievskie-lentochki|script-title=ru:Черно-оранжевые ленты не будут использоваться в ходе празднования Дня Победы в Казахстане.|publisher=Dialog.kz|language=Russian|accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, no official authority issued any comments.

===Latvia===
The government of Latvia proposed the ban on the use of any Ribbons of Saint George by law in May 2014; earlier, Latvia imposed a ban on the use of all Soviet symbols at public events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rapsinews.com/news/20140507/271270403.html|accessdate=10 September 2014|title=Latvia proposes ban on Russian St. George's ribbon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lithuania===

==Russian nationalist and government loyalist symbol==
The ribbon has been adopted by Russian nationalist and government loyalist groups. During the [[2011–13 Russian protests]], protestors demonstrating against electoral fraud in the [[Russian legislative election, 2011|2011 elections]] carried white ribbons.

The '''Separate Representation of Voters Act''' No. 46 was introduced in [[South Africa]] on 18 June 1951.  Part of the legislation during the [[apartheid]] era, the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] introduced it to enforce racial segregation, and was part of a deliberate process to remove all non-white people from the voters' roll and revoke the [[Cape Qualified Franchise]] system.  

This act was declared invalid by the [[Supreme Court of South Africa|Supreme Court]] when challenged in the case of ''Harris v Minister of the Interior 1952(2) SA 428(AD)''; this gave rise to the [[Coloured vote constitutional crisis]]. The government, however, was able to circumvent the court's decision by increasing the number of Appellate Division judges from five to eleven, and increasing the size of the Senate from forty-eight to eighty-nine.  These changes enabled the government to successfully introduce the [[South Africa Act Amendment Act]] No 9 of 2 March 1956, effectively overturning the Supreme Court's decision and revalidating the act.  This amendment was repealed by the Republic of South Africa Constitution Act 32 of 1961. This case was one of many where South Africa's parliamentary sovereignty enabled the passing of laws without being subject to judicial review on substantive grounds. The judiciary was bound therefore leaving the legislature and executive to act independently from the third arm of government. Arguably this silencing of the judiciary allowed the Apartheid state to become further entrenched in the legal sphere of South Africa.

The act as a whole was repealed by section 4 of the [[Separate Representation of Voters Amendment Act]] No 50 of 27 March 1968.  This bill introduced the ''Coloured Persons Representative Council'', consisting of forty elected members and twenty nominated members.  This council could make laws on [[finance]], [[local government]], [[education]], [[community welfare]] and [[pension]]s, rural [[town|settlement]]s and [[agriculture]] which affected [[coloured]] people.  A bill could only be introduced when approved by the Minister of Coloured Relations, as well as requiring the approval of the white [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]].  This act was repealed in 1983 by section 101(1) of the Republic of South Africa Constitution Act No 110.

In the [[United States]], a '''Social Security number''' ('''SSN''') is a nine-digit number issued to [[United States nationality law|U.S. citizens]], [[Permanent residence (United States)|permanent residents]], and temporary (working) residents under section 205(c)(2) of the Social Security Act, codified as {{uscsub|42|405|c|2}}. The number is issued to an individual by the [[Social Security Administration]], an [[Independent agencies of the United States government|independent agency of the United States government]]. Although its primary purpose is to track individuals for [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] purposes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/ssb/v69n2/v69n2p55.html |first=Carolyn |last=Pickett |magazine=Social Security Bulletin |volume=69 |number=2 |year=2009 |publisher=United States Social Security Administration |access-date=October 19, 2018 |title=The Story of the Social Security Number}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Social Security number has [[Feature creep|become]] a ''[[de facto]]'' [[national identification number]] for [[Taxation in the United States|taxation]] and other purposes.&lt;ref name="AmericanChronicle"/&gt;

A Social Security number may be obtained by applying on Form SS-5, application for A Social Security Number Card.&lt;ref&gt;{{USCFR|20|422|103}}(b)&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Social Security numbers were first issued by the Social Security Administration in November 1935 as part of the [[New Deal]] Social Security program. Within three months, 25 million numbers were issued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ssa.gov/history/1930.html |publisher=United States Social Security Administration |access-date=October 19, 2018 |title=Social Security: Chronology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 24, 1936, 1,074 of the nation's 45,000 post offices were designated "typing centers" to type up Social Security cards that were then sent to Washington, D.C. On December 1, 1936, as part of the publicity campaign for the new program, Joseph L. Fay of the Social Security Administration selected a record from the top of the first stack of 1,000 records and announced that the first Social Security number in history was assigned to John David Sweeney, Jr., of [[New Rochelle, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ssa.gov/history/ssn/firstcard.html |publisher=United States Social Security Administration |work=Social Security History |access-date=October 19, 2018 |title=The "First" Social Security Number; The Lowest Number}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Ogden Standard Examiner |date=December 2, 1936 |page=8 |location=Ogden, Utah |title=First Applicant on Pension List |url=https://newspaperarchive.com/ogden-standard-examiner-dec-02-1936-p-8/ |access-date=October 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before 1986, people often did not obtain a Social Security number until the age of about 14,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |access-date=October 19, 2018 |title=Social Security Numbers Issued: A 20-Year Review |url=https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/ssb/v56n1/v56n1p83.pdf |journal=Social Security Journal |volume=56 |last1=Long |first1=Wayne S. |date=Spring 1993 |issue=1 |page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; since the numbers were used for income tracking purposes, and those under that age seldom had substantial income&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |access-date=October 19, 2018 |doi=10.1002/sim.4780121805 |title=A strategy for assembling samples of adult twin pairs in the United States |volume=12 |last1=Goldberg |date=October 17, 1993 |first1=Jack |issue=18 |pages=1693–1702 |url=https://www.academia.edu/11871886/A_strategy_for_assembling_samples_of_adult_twin_pairs_in_the_United_States |journal=Statistics in Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tax Reform Act of 1986]] required parents to list Social Security numbers for each dependent over the age of 5 for whom the parent wanted to claim a [[tax deduction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |access-date=October 19, 2018 |publisher=United States Social Security Administration |title=Tax Reform Act of 1986 |url=https://www.ssa.gov/history/ssn/reagantax.html |work=Social Security History}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before this act, parents claiming tax deductions were simply trusted not to lie about the number of children they supported. During the first year of the Tax Reform Act, this anti-fraud change resulted in seven million fewer minor dependents being claimed. The disappearance of these dependents is believed to have involved either children who never existed or tax deductions improperly claimed by non-custodial parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Who Are the Ineligible EITC Recipients? |journal=National Tax Journal |first=Jeffrey B. |last=Liebman |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/41789513.pdf |access-date=October 19, 2018 |volume=53 |jstor=41789513 |date=December 2000 |pages=1165–1186}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, the threshold was lowered to 2 years old, and in 1990, the threshold was lowered yet again to 1 year old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ssa.gov/history/ssn/ssnchron.html |publisher=Social Security Administration |access-date=October 19, 2018 |title=Social Security Number Chronology}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, an SSN is required regardless of the child's age to receive an exemption.{{citation needed|reason=Without a legal reference, like the rest, this stands out as being the most questionable.|date=April 2016}} Since then, parents have often applied for Social Security numbers for their children soon after birth; today, it can be done on the application for a [[birth certificate]].&lt;ref name="SSNChildren"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ssa.gov/pubs/10023.html |publisher=Social Security Administration |access-date=October 19, 2018 |date=December 2017 |title=Social Security Numbers For Children}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose and use ==

The original purpose of this number was to track individuals' accounts within the Social Security program.  It has since come to be used as an identifier for individuals within the United States, although rare errors occur where duplicates do exist.  As numbers are now assigned by the central issuing office of the SSA, it is unlikely that duplication will ever occur again. A few duplications did occur when prenumbered cards were sent out to regional SSA offices and (originally) Post Offices.

Employee, patient, student, and [[Credit history|credit]] records are sometimes indexed by Social Security number.

The [[Military of the United States|U.S. Armed Forces]] has used the Social Security number as an identification number for Army and Air Force personnel since July 1, 1969, the Navy and Marine Corps for their personnel since January 1, 1972, and the Coast Guard for their personnel since October 1, 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.archives.gov/personnel-records-center/social-security-numbers |publisher=National Archives |access-date=October 19, 2018 |title=Service Numbers and Social Security Numbers}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, the United States military used a much more complicated system of [[Service number (United States)|service numbers]] that varied by service.

Beginning in June 2011, DOD began removing the Social Security number from military identification cards. It is replaced by a unique DOD identification number, formerly known as the [[EDIPI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jim |last=Garamone |date=April 4, 2011 |title=DOD removes SSAN from ID cards |url=https://www.army.mil/article/54310/dod_to_drop_social_security_numbers_from_id_cards |access-date=October 19, 2018 |work=U.S. Army}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Non-universal status ===
[[File:Social security card.gif|thumb|right|200px|An old Social Security card with the "not for identification" message]]

[[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] was originally a universal tax, but when [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] was passed in 1965, objecting religious groups in existence prior to 1951 were allowed to opt out of the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=AmishNews.com |url=http://www.amishnews.com/amisharticles/amishss.htm |access-date=October 19, 2018 |title="Pay Unto Caesar": The Amish &amp; Social Security}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of this, not every American is part of the Social Security program, and not everyone has a number. However, a social security number is required for parents to claim their children as dependents for federal income tax purposes,&lt;ref name="SSNChildren" /&gt; and the Internal Revenue Service requires all corporations to obtain SSNs (or alternative identifying numbers) from their employees, as described below. The [[Amish|Old Order Amish]] have fought to prevent universal Social Security by overturning rules such as a requirement to provide a Social Security number for a hunting license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://chippewa.com/article_8e69504b-81cb-5586-bdcb-616356e2b064.html |date=August 30, 1999 |work=The Chippewa Herald |access-date=October 19, 2018 |title=Amish reject giving Social Security numbers to get licenses}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social Security cards printed from January 1946 until January 1972 expressly stated that people should not use the number and card for identification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |access-date=October 19, 2018 |publisher=United States Social Security Administration |dead-url=yes |title=Version History |url=http://www.ssa.gov/history/ssn/ssnversions.html |work=Social Security History |archive-date=June 29, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120629234649/http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/view/3911}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since nearly everyone in the United States now has an SSN, it became convenient to use it anyway and the message was removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |access-date=October 19, 2018 |last=Pear |first=Robert |title=The Nation; Not for Identification Purposes (Just Kidding) |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/26/weekinreview/the-nation-not-for-identification-purposes-just-kidding.html |work=The New York Times |date=July 26, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, Social Security numbers have become ''[[de facto]]'' [[national identification number]]s.&lt;ref name="AmericanChronicle"&gt;{{cite news |access-date=October 19, 2018 |last=Kouri |first=Jim |dead-url=yes |title=Social Security Cards: De Facto National Identification |url=http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/viewArticle.asp?articleID=3911 |work=American Chronicle |date=March 9, 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120629234649/http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/view/3911 |archive-date=June 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although some people do not have an SSN assigned to them, it is becoming increasingly difficult to engage in legitimate financial activities such as applying for a loan or a bank account without one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/document/2682567/Social-Security-Number-Not-Required |publisher=Scribd.com |date=April 29, 2008 |access-date=October 19, 2018 |title=Social Security Number Not Required}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the government cannot require an individual to disclose their SSN without a legal basis, companies may refuse to provide service to an individual who does not provide an SSN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Office of Public Enquiries, Social Security Administration |first=Charles H. |last=Mullen |url=https://mail.hiwaay.net/asc/ |title=Letter to Mr. Scott McDonald |date=March 18, 1998 |access-date=October 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |access-date=October 19, 2018 |publisher=United States Social Security Administration |title=Can I refuse to give my Social Security number to a private business? |url=https://faq.ssa.gov/en-us/Topic/article/KA-02232 |work=Frequently Asked Questions |date=May 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The card on which an SSN is issued is still not suitable for primary identification as it has no photograph, no physical description, and no birth date. All it does is confirm that a particular number has been issued to a particular name. Instead, a [[driver's license]] or state ID card is used as an identification for adults.

=== Use required for federal tax purposes ===
[[Internal Revenue Code]] section 6109(d) provides: "The social security account number issued to an individual for purposes of section 205(c)(2)(A) of the Social Security Act [codified as {{uscsub|42|405|c|2|A}}] shall, except as shall otherwise be specified under regulations of the Secretary [of the Treasury or his delegate], be used as the identifying number for such individual for purposes of this title [the Internal Revenue Code, title 26 of the [[United States Code]]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{uscsub|26|6109|d}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Internal Revenue Code also provides, when required by regulations prescribed by the Secretary [of the Treasury or his delegate]:
# Inclusion in returns: Any person required under the authority of this title to make a return, statement, or other document shall include in such return, statement, or other document such identifying number as may be prescribed for securing proper identification of such person.
# Furnishing number to other persons: Any person with respect to whom a return, statement, or other document is required under the authority of this title to be made by another person or whose identifying number is required to be shown on a return of another person shall furnish to such other person such identifying number as may be prescribed for securing his proper identification.&lt;ref&gt;{{uscsub|26|6109|a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to U.S. Treasury regulations, any person who, after October 31, 1962, works as an employee for wages subject to Social Security taxes, Medicare taxes, or U.S. federal income tax withholdings is required to apply for "an account number" using "Form SS-5."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2018-title26-vol17/xml/CFR-2018-title26-vol17-sec31-6011b-2.xml 26 C.F.R. sec. 31.6011(b)-2(a)(1)(ii)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Why won't this work with the CFR site?... --&gt;

A taxpayer who is not eligible to have a Social Security number must obtain an alternative [[Taxpayer Identification Number]].

== Types of Social Security cards ==

Three different types of Social Security cards are issued. The most common type contains the cardholder's name and number.  Such cards are issued to U.S. citizens and U.S. permanent residents. There are also two restricted types of Social Security cards:
* One reads "not valid for employment." Such cards cannot be used as proof of work authorization, and are not acceptable as a List C document on the I-9 form.
* The other reads "valid for work only with DHS authorization", or the older, "valid for work only with INS authorization." These cards are issued to people who have temporary work authorization in the U.S.  They can satisfy the I-9 requirement, if they are accompanied by a work authorization card.

In 2004 Congress passed The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act; parts of which mandated that the Social Security Administration redesign the Social Security Number (SSN) Card to prevent forgery. From April 2006 through August 2007, [[Social Security Administration]] (SSA) and [[United States Government Publishing Office|Government Printing Office]] (GPO) employees were assigned to redesign the Social Security Number Card to the specifications of the Interagency Task Force created by the Commissioner of Social Security in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security.

The new SSN card design utilizes both covert and overt security features created by the SSA and GPO design teams.

== Identity theft ==
[[File:Dog Tag WWII P.jpg|thumb|[[Dog tag]] from [[World War II]] (possibly Army-Air Corps), labeled "P" for [[Protestant]].]]

Many citizens and [[privacy]] advocates are concerned about the disclosure and processing of Social Security numbers.  Furthermore, researchers at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] have demonstrated an algorithm that uses publicly available personal information to reconstruct a given SSN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/science/2009/07/social-insecurity-numbers-open-to-hacking/ |first=John |last=Timmer |publisher=Ars Technica |date=July 17, 2009 |access-date=October 19, 2018 |title=New algorithm guesses SSNs using date and place of birth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SSN is frequently used by those involved in [[identity theft]], since it is interconnected with many other forms of identification, and because people asking for it treat it as an [[authentication|authenticator]]. Financial institutions generally require an SSN to set up [[bank account]]s, [[credit card]]s, and loans—partly because they assume that no one except the person it was issued to knows it.

Exacerbating the problem of using the Social Security number as an identifier is the fact that the Social Security card contains no [[Biometrics|biometric]] identifiers of any sort, making it essentially impossible to tell whether a person using a certain SSN truly belongs to someone without relying on other documentation (which may itself have been falsely procured through use of the fraudulent SSN). Congress has proposed federal laws that restrict the use of SSNs for identification and bans their use for a number of commercial purposes—e.g., rental applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |access-date=October 19, 2018 |publisher=News.cnet.com |last=Broache |title=Congress may slap restrictions on SSN use - CNET News |url=http://news.cnet.com/Congress+may+slap+restrictions+on+SSN+use/2100-7348_3-6071441.html?tag=nefd.top |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120711052547/http://news.cnet.com/Congress-may-slap-restrictions-on-SSN-use/2100-7348_3-6071441.html |archive-date=2012-07-11 |first=Anne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) offers alternatives to SSNs in some places where providing untrusted parties with identification numbers is essential. Tax return preparers must obtain and use a [[Preparer Tax Identification Number]] (PTIN) to include on their client's tax returns (as part of signature requirements). Day care services have tax benefits, and even a sole proprietor should give parents an EIN (employer identification number) to use on their tax return.

The Social Security Administration has suggested that, if asked to provide his or her Social Security number, a citizen should ask which law requires its use.&lt;ref name="howcaniprotect"/&gt; In accordance with §7213 of the [[9/11 Commission Implementation Act of 2004]] and {{USCFR|20|422|103|(e)(2)}}, the number of replacement Social Security cards per person is generally limited to three per calendar year and ten in a [[life]]time.&lt;ref name="howcaniprotect"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ssa.gov/pubs/10002.html |publisher=Social Security Administration |access-date=October 19, 2018 |title=Your Social Security Number And Card, "How can I protect my Social Security number?"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Identity confusion has also occurred because of the use of local Social Security numbers by the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and the Republic of Palau, whose numbers overlap with those of residents of New Hampshire and Maine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |access-date=October 19, 2018 |publisher=The Plain Dealer |first=Bill |last=Meyer |title=How many Americans' Social Security numbers were officially duplicated for Pacific islanders? |url=https://www.cleveland.com/nation/index.ssf/2009/08/how_many_americans_social_secu.html |date=August 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Replacement numbers ==

A person can request a new Social Security number, but only under certain conditions;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Can I change my Social Security number?|url=https://faq.ssa.gov/en-us/Topic/article/KA-02220 |website=Social Security Administration |access-date=October 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Where sequential numbers assigned to members of the same family are causing problems.
* In the event of duplicates having been issued.
*In cases where the person has been a victim of domestic violence or harassment, and there is a clear need to change their number for their personal safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10093.pdf |website=Social Security Administration |access-date=October 19, 2018 |title=New Numbers for Domestic Violence Victims |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*When a person has been a victim of identity theft, and their Social Security number continues to be problematic.
* Where a person has a demonstrable religious objection to a number (such as certain Christians being averse to the number [[Number of the Beast|666]]).

For all of these conditions, credible third-party evidence such as a restraining order or police report, is required.

== Structure ==

The Social Security number is a nine-digit number in the format "AAA-GG-SSSS".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ssa.gov/history/ssn/geocard.html |access-date=October 19, 2018 |author=Social Security Administration |title=The SSN Numbering Scheme}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number is divided into three parts: the first three digits, known as the ''area number'' because they were formerly assigned by geographical region; the middle two digits, known as the ''group number''; and the final four digits, known as the ''serial number.''

On June 25, 2011, the SSA changed the SSN assignment process to "SSN randomization".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ssa.gov/employer/randomization.html |publisher=Socialsecurity.gov |access-date=October 19, 2018 |title=Social Security Number Randomization}}&lt;/ref&gt; SSN randomization affected the SSN assignment process in the following ways:

# It eliminated the geographical significance of the first three digits of the SSN, referred to as the area number, by no longer allocating specific numbers by state for assignment to individuals.
# It eliminated the significance of the highest group number assigned for each area number, and, as a result, the High Group List is frozen in time and can be used for validation of only those SSNs issued prior to the randomization implementation date (see section "Valid SSNs").
# Previously unassigned area numbers have been introduced for assignment, excluding area numbers 000, 666 and 900–99.
Because [[Individual Taxpayer Identification Number]]s (ITINs) are issued by the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS), they were not affected by this SSA change.

=== Historical structure ===
Prior to the 2011 randomization process, the first three digits or [[#List of Social Security Area Numbers|area number]] were assigned by geographical region. Prior to 1973, cards were issued in local Social Security offices around the country and the area number represented the office code where the card was issued. This did not necessarily have to be in the area where the applicant lived, since a person could apply for their card in any Social Security office. Beginning in 1973, when the SSA began assigning SSNs and issuing cards centrally from [[Baltimore]], the area number was assigned based on the [[ZIP Code]] in the mailing address provided on the application for the original Social Security card. The applicant's mailing address did not have to be the same as their place of residence. Thus, the area number did not necessarily represent the state of residence of the applicant regardless of whether the card was issued prior to, or after, 1973.

Generally, numbers were assigned beginning in the [[Northeastern United States|northeast]] and moving south and westward, so that people applying from addresses on the east coast had the lowest numbers and those on the west coast had the highest numbers. As the areas assigned to a locality were exhausted, new areas from the pool were assigned, so some states had noncontiguous groups of numbers.

The middle two digits or ''group number'' range from 01 to 99. Even before SSN randomization, the group numbers were not assigned consecutively within an area. Instead, for administrative reasons, group numbers were issued in the following order:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ssa.gov/history/ssn/geocard.html |publisher=SocialSecurity.gov |access-date=October 19, 2018 |title=The SSN Numbering Scheme}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#  odd numbers from 01 through 09
#  even numbers from 10 through 98
#  even numbers from 02 through 08
#  odd numbers from 11 through 99

As an example, group number 98 would be issued before 11.

The last four digits are ''serial numbers''. Before SSN randomization took effect, they represented a straight numerical sequence of digits from 0001 to 9999 within the group.

===  Valid SSNs  ===

Prior to June 25, 2011, a valid SSN could not have an area number between 734 and 749, or above 772, the highest area number the Social Security Administration had allocated. Effective June 25, 2011, the SSA assigns SSNs randomly and allows for the assignment of area numbers between 734 and 749 and above 772 through the 800s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ssa.gov/employer/stateweb.htm |publisher=Social Security Administration |access-date=October 19, 2018 |title=Social Security Number Allocations}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This should not be confused with Tax Identification Numbers (TINs), which include additional area numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/taxpayer-identification-numbers-tin |title=Taxpayer Identification Numbers (TIN) |publisher=Internal Revenue Service |date=May 2, 2018 |access-date=October 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some special numbers are never allocated:
*  Numbers with all zeros in any digit group (''000''-##-####, ###-''00''-####, ###-##-''0000'').&lt;ref name="FAQInvalid"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ssa.gov/employer/randomization.html |publisher=Social Security Administration |access-date=October 19, 2018 |title=Social Security Number Randomization}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |access-date=October 19, 2018 |publisher=United States Social Security Administration |title=RM 10201.035 Invalid Social Security Numbers (SSNs) |url=https://secure.ssa.gov/apps10/poms.nsf/lnx/0110201035 |work=Program Operations Manual System (POMS) |date=June 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*  Numbers with 666 or 900–999 ([[Individual Taxpayer Identification Number]]) in the first digit group.&lt;ref name="FAQInvalid" /&gt;

Until 2011, the SSA published the last group number used for each area number.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ssa.gov/employer/ssnvhighgroup.htm |publisher=Social Security Administration |access-date=October 19, 2018 |title=High Group List And Other Ways To Determine If An SSN Is Valid}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since group numbers were allocated in a regular pattern, it was possible to identify an unissued SSN that contained an invalid group number. Now numbers are assigned randomly, and fraudulent SSNs are not easily detectable with publicly available information. Many online services, however, provide SSN validation.

Unlike many similar numbers, no [[check digit]] is included.

===Exhaustion and re-use===

The Social Security Administration does not reuse Social Security numbers. It has issued over 450 million since the start of the program, and at a use rate of about 5.5 million per year. It says it has enough to last several generations without reuse or changing the number of digits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ssa.gov/history/hfaq.html |publisher=United States Social Security Administration |access-date=October 19, 2018 |title=Q20: Are Social Security numbers reused after a person dies?}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there have been instances where multiple individuals have been inadvertently assigned the same Social Security number.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/3004654/government/a-tale-of-two-women-same-birthday-same-social-security-number-same-big-data-mess.html |publisher=PC World |first=Katherine |last=Noyes |date=November 12, 2015 |access-date=October 19, 2018 |title=A tale of two women: same birthday, same Social Security number, same big-data mess}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== SSNs used in advertising ==
[[File:Walletssn2.gif|thumb|The promotional [[Social Security card]] as distributed by the [[F.W. Woolworth Company]]]]

Some SSNs used in advertising have rendered those numbers invalid. One famous instance of this occurred in 1938 when the [[E. H. Ferree Company]] in [[Lockport (city), New York|Lockport, New York]], decided to promote its product by showing how a Social Security card would fit into its [[wallet]]s. A sample card, used for display purposes, was placed in each wallet, which was sold by [[F.W. Woolworth Company|Woolworth]] and other department stores across the country; the wallet manufacturer's vice president and treasurer Douglas Patterson used the actual SSN of his secretary, Hilda Schrader Whitcher.

Even though the card was printed in red (the real card is printed in blue) and had "Specimen" printed across the front, many people used Whitcher's SSN as their own. The Social Security Administration's account of the incident also claims that the fake card was half the size of a real card, despite a miniature card's being useless for its purpose and despite  Whitcher's holding two cards of apparently identical size in the accompanying photograph. Over time, the number that appeared (078-05-1120) has been claimed by a total of over 40,000 people as their own.&lt;ref name="Misused"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ssa.gov/history/ssn/misused.html |title=Social Security Cards Issued by Woolworth |publisher=Social Security Administration |access-date=October 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SSA initiated an advertising campaign stating that it was incorrect to use the number (Hilda Whitcher was issued a new SSN). However, the number was found to be in use by 12 individuals as late as 1977.&lt;ref name="Misused" /&gt;

More recently, [[Todd Davis]] distributed his SSN in advertisements for his company's [[LifeLock]] identity theft protection service, which allowed his identity to be stolen over a dozen times.&lt;ref name="13times"&gt;{{cite web |access-date=October 19, 2018 |last=Zetter |title=LifeLock CEO's Identity Stolen 13 Times |url=https://www.wired.com/2010/05/lifelock-identity-theft/ |work=Wired |date=May 18, 2010 |first=Kim}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |access-date=October 19, 2018 |work=ComputerWorld |date=May 19, 2010 |first=Jaikumar |last=Vijayan |title=LifeLock CEO said to be victim of identity theft 13 times |url=https://www.computerworld.com/article/2517761/data-privacy/lifelock-ceo-said-to-be-victim-of-identity-theft-13-times.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The above table is only valid for SSN issued before June 2011. On June 25, 2011, the SSA changed the SSN assignment process to "SSN randomization".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ssa.gov/employer/randomization.html |publisher=SocialSecurity.gov |access-date=October 19, 2018 |title=Social Security Number Randomization}}&lt;/ref&gt; SSN randomization affects the SSN assignment process. [[Social Security number#Structure|Among its changes]], it eliminates the geographical significance of the first three digits of the SSN, previously referred to as the Area Number, by no longer allocating the Area Numbers for assignment to individuals in specific states.  The table above is based on out-of-date information.  Numbers in the range of 650-699 most certainly have been issued (see related comment on the Talk page).

{{Main|Terrorism}}
{{terrorism}}
'''Terrorism financing''' refers to activities that provide financing or financial support to individual [[terrorist]]s or [[non-state actor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Financial Weapons of War, Minnesota Law Review (2016), available at: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2765010&lt;/ref&gt;  A government that maintains a list of terrorist organizations normally will also pass laws to prevent [[money laundering]] being used to finance those organizations.

Laws against money laundering and terror financing are used around the world. In the [[United States]], the [[Patriot Act]] was passed after the [[September 11 attacks]], giving the government [[anti-money laundering]] powers to monitor financial institutions. The Patriot Act has generated a [[USA PATRIOT Act#Controversy|great deal of controversy]] in the United States since its enactment. The United States has also collaborated with the United Nations and other countries to create the [[Terrorist Finance Tracking Program]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/eu-ups-its-fight-against-terrorist-financing/a-18903083|title=EU ups its fight against terrorist financing|work=DW.COM}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/what-we-do/policies/crisis-and-terrorism/tftp/index_en.htm|title=DGs - Migration and Home Affairs - What we do - ...Crisis &amp; Terrorism - Terrorist Finance Tracking Programme|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laws created attempted to thwart the financing of [[terrorism]] (CFT) and money laundering. Initially the focus of CFT efforts was on non-profit organizations, unregistered [[money services business]]es (MSBs) (including so called underground banking or ‘[[Hawala]]s’) and the criminalisation of the act itself. The [[Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering]] (FATF) made nine special recommendations for CFT (first eight then a year later added a ninth). These nine recommendations have become the global standard for CFT and their effectiveness is assessed almost always in conjunction with anti-money laundering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fatf-gafi.org|title=FATF-GAFI.ORG - Financial Action Task Force (FATF)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[FATF Blacklist]] (the NCCT list) mechanism was used to coerce countries to bring about change.

== Money laundering ==
{{Main|Money laundering}}
Often linked in legislation and regulation, terrorism financing and money laundering are conceptual opposites. Money laundering is the process where cash raised from criminal activities is made to look legitimate for re-integration into the financial system, whereas terrorism financing cares little about the source of the funds, but it is what the funds are to be used for that defines its scope.

An in-depth study of the symbiotic relationship between [[organised crime in the United States|organised crime]] and terrorist organizations detected within the United States of America and other areas of the world referred to as crime-terror nexus points has been published in the forensic literature.&lt;ref&gt;Perri, Frank S., Lichtenwald, Terrance G., and MacKenzie, Paula M. (2009). [http://www.all-about-psychology.com/support-files/crime-terror-nexus.pdf Evil Twins: The Crime-Terror Nexus].

The Perri, Lichtenwald and MacKenzie article emphasizes the importance of multi-agency working groups and the tools that can be used to identify, infiltrate, and dismantle organizations operating along the crime-terror nexus points.

Terrorists use low value but high volume fraud activity to fund their operations.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} Paramilitary groups{{which|date=May 2013}} in [[Northern Ireland]] are using{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} legitimate businesses such as hotels, pubs and taxi operators to launder money and fund political activities. Even beyond Ireland, terrorists are buying out/controlling front-end businesses especially cash-intensive businesses including in some cases money services businesses to move monies.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} Bulk cash smuggling and placement through cash-intensive businesses is one typology. They are now also moving monies through the new online payment systems. They also use trade linked schemes to launder monies. Nonetheless, the older systems have not given way. Terrorists also continue to move monies through MSBs/[[Hawala]]s, and through international ATM transactions.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Charities also continue to be used in countries where controls are not so stringent.

== Suspicious activity ==
[[Operation Green Quest]], a US multi-agency task force established in October 2001 with the official purpose of countering terrorism financing considers the following patterns of activity as indicators of the collection and movement of funds that could be associated with terrorism financing:

* Account transactions that are inconsistent with past deposits or withdrawals such as cash, [[cheque]]s, [[wire transfer]]s, etc.
* Transactions involving a high volume of incoming or outgoing wire transfers, with no logical or apparent purpose that come from, go to, or transit through locations of concern, that is sanctioned countries, non-cooperative nations and sympathizer nations.
* Unexplainable clearing or negotiation of third party cheques and their deposits in foreign bank accounts.
* Structuring at multiple branches or the same branch with multiple activities.
* Corporate layering, transfers between bank accounts of related entities or charities for no apparent reasons.
* Wire transfers by charitable organisations to companies located in countries known to be bank or [[tax haven]]s.
* Lack of apparent [[Fundraising|fund raising]] activity, for example a lack of small cheques or typical donations associated with charitable bank deposits.
* Using multiple accounts to collect funds that are then transferred to the same foreign beneficiaries
* Transactions with no logical economic purpose, that is, no link between the activity of the organization and other parties involved in the transaction.
* Overlapping corporate officers, bank signatories, or other identifiable similarities associated with addresses, references and financial activities.
* Cash debiting schemes in which deposits in the US correlate directly with ATM withdrawals in countries of concern. Reverse transactions of this nature are also suspicious.
* Issuing cheques, money orders or other [[financial instruments]], often numbered sequentially, to the same person or business, or to a person or business whose name is spelled similarly.

It would be difficult to determine by such activity alone whether the particular act was related to terrorism or to [[organized crime]]. For this reason, these activities must be examined in context with other factors in order to determine a terrorism financing connection. Simple transactions can be found to be suspect and money laundering derived from terrorism will typically involve instances in which simple operations had been performed (retail [[foreign exchange market|foreign exchange]] operations, international transfer of funds) revealing links with other countries including FATF blacklisted countries. Some of the customers may have [[Criminal record|police records]], particularly for trafficking in narcotics and weapons and may be linked with foreign terrorist groups. The funds may have moved through a [[State Sponsors of Terrorism|state sponsor of terrorism]] or a country where there is a terrorism problem. A link with a [[Politically exposed person]] (PEP) may ultimately link up to a terrorism financing transaction. A charity may be a link in the transaction. Accounts (especially student) that only receive periodic deposits withdrawn via ATM over two months and are dormant at other periods could indicate that they are becoming active to prepare for an attack.

==Germany==
In July 2010, [[Germany]] outlawed the [[Internationale Humanitäre Hilfsorganisation e.V.|Internationale Humanitäre Hilfsorganisation]] (IHH), saying it has used donations to support projects in Gaza that are related to [[Hamas]], which is considered by the European Union to be a terrorist organization,&lt;ref name="Hilfsorganisation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3918670,00.html|title=Germany bans group accused of Hamas links|work=ynet}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IHH"/&gt; while presenting their activities to donors as humanitarian help. German Interior Minister [[Thomas de Maiziere]] said, "[[Donations]] to so-called social welfare groups belonging to Hamas, such as the millions given by IHH, actually support the terror organization Hamas as a whole." &lt;ref name="Hilfsorganisation"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IHH"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/germany-outlaws-ihh-over-claimed-hamas-links-1.301483|title=Germany Outlaws Charity Over Alleged Hamas Links|work=Haaretz.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Australia==
In 2009, an investigation carried out by the [[Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre]] (AUSTRAC) and other agencies, determined that funds were being sent from Australia for use by the Somalia-based terrorist group, [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|al-Shabaab]]. Money was remitted, with false names used to obscure the money trail. This investigation lead to the ultimate arrest of the suspects on charges of conspiring to commit a terrorist attack on an [[Holsworthy Barracks terror plot|Australian army base]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.austrac.gov.au/book/export/html/508  |title=Case studies - Remittance services (money transfers): Case 21 – Australian terror suspects sent funds to Somalia to support terrorist group |work=[[AUSTRAC]]|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In 2014, Australian authorities feared that money being transferred from Australia could be used for [[terrorism in Somalia]]. In 2015 Australian banks ceased providing money-transfer facilities to Somalia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-10-17/somali-australians-plead-with-westpac-to-not-close/5822138  |title=Somali Australians plead with Westpac to not close remittance accounts |author=McGrath, Pat|date=17 October 2014|work=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/leader/east/westpac-to-stop-somali-money-transfers-on-march-31/story-fngnvlxu-1227281376048  |title=Westpac to stop Somali money transfers on March 31 |author=Armitage, Laura|date=30 March 2015|work=[[Herald Sun]]|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''uninsured motorist clause''' is a provision commonly found in [[United States]] automobile [[car insurance|insurance]] policies that provides for a driver to receive damages for any injury he or she receives from an uninsured, negligent driver. The owner of the policy pays a premium to the insurance company to include this clause. Although not exclusive, this coverage is typically added to an automobile insurance policy. In the event of a qualifying accident, the insurance company pays the difference between what the uninsured driver can pay and what the injured driver would be entitled to as if the uninsured motorist had proper insurance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url        = http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/uninsured+motorist+clause

 |website    = http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/
 |accessdate = 5/9/2013
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This type of coverage is meant to prevent the possibility that a motorist will have to pay for medical expenses and property damage to his vehicle as a result of the accident with the underinsured at-fault motorist.  The ramifications related to being hit by an underinsured motorist vary by individual state laws.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.azinsuranceteam.com/should-i-invest-in-uninsured-and-underinsured-motorist-coverage-.html "Should I Invest In Uninsured and Underinsured Motorist Coverage?"], ''AZ Insurance Team''.  Retrieved 2016-11-20&lt;/ref&gt;

It is mandatory for the insurance carrier to provide such coverage in some states, such as [[Underinsured/uninsured motorist coverage in Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]], Illinois, Maryland, and New York.

==Defining an uninsured motorist for the purpose of an uninsured motorist clause==
There are three types of uninsured motorists defined under the uninsured motorist clause: 
# Individuals who do not have liability coverage for the vehicle he or she is operating. In most states, it is a crime to be uninsured in this manner.
# When an individual flees the scene of an [[Traffic collision|accident]] without leaving sufficient information to identify him or herself, the individual is considered uninsured for the purposes of an uninsured motorist provision. Note, however, that a positive ID of the [[Vehicle registration plate|license plates]] in a hit and run accident will often be considered by insurance companies sufficient information to identify the negligent [[hit and run (vehicular)|Hit and run]] driver. Such identification will often lead to the denial of an uninsured motorist claim, as insurance companies will often litigate the claim, bringing in the [[registered owner]] of the vehicle with matching plates, even when that person denies involvement in the accident. Some states don't allow uninsured motorist property damage to be used in hit-and-run collisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=hit-and-run claims|url=http://www.esurance.com/claims-info/claim-types/hit-and-run-claims|publisher=esurance|accessdate=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these states, your collision coverage may be able to help pay for your car repairs. 
#* California
#* Colorado
#* Illinois
#* Louisiana
#* Ohio
# A stolen vehicle is uninsured from the time it has been stolen. A person who has been injured by a stolen vehicle may qualify for an uninsured claim.

A few states require physical contact for uninsured claims. If contact is required, it can be any kind of contact, such as that between two cars, but can also consist of a vehicle contacting the leg of a motorcyclist or a motorcycle tire.

==Bodily Injury Coverage==
===Uninsured Motorist===
Uninsured Motorist Bodily Injury Coverage covers a victim's medical expenses, lost wages, and other injury related expenses in an instance where the other driver is not insured. This coverage applies only if the other party is found to be at fault for the incident. Depending on the state, the insurance company may or may not require the victim to identify the other vehicle/driver. Many states will cover a hit and run incident.

===Underinsured Motorist===
Underinsured Motorist Bodily Injury Coverage protects a driver by financially compensating him for his injury in the event that he is injured in an accident by someone else who negligently caused his injuries when the driver or owner has liability coverage for his or her vehicle that is less than the amount of the victim's liability coverage. Underinsured coverage may also be referred to as an underinsured motorist clause or endorsement or SUM, which is an abbreviation for Supplementary Underinsured Motorist coverage.

==Litigating an uninsured motorist claim==
Most states require a victim to sue the uninsured motorist (or a fictitious [[John Doe]] hit and run driver when litigating the second category of uninsured motorist claim) for his injuries in order to prevail on a breach of contract action against the insurance carrier. Some states, such as Virginia, require that the victim actually obtain a judgment against the uninsured motorist (while serving the uninsured motorist carrier in the lawsuit so that the carrier can defend the suit) and then demand payment from the uninsured motorist carrier prior to suing the carrier for any breach of an uninsured motorist provision. Normally there is no need to sue the carrier in such states as Virginia unless there is a dispute as to coverage.  Liability is rarely an issue in cases against John Doe defendants and in any regard, must be litigated in the first suit against the John Doe, if at all. The insurance company will ordinarily pay the judgment, up to the policy limits, once a court determines that an uninsured motorist was at fault. Some states' laws also allow additional insurance coverage to the insured policyholder through policy stacking provisions, whereby a claim may be made against multiple uninsured motorist policies.
