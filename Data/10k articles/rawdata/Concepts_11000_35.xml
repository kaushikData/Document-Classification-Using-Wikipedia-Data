The '''2013 New York divorce torture plot''' was a [[sting operation]] conducted by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] against a gang that had been kidnapping [[Jewish]] men and torturing them into granting their wives [[Get (divorce document)|gets]] (religious divorces). It began with the apprehension of Rabbi '''David Wax''',&lt;ref name="Guns Forced"&gt;Loder, Stephanie (May 15, 2014) [http://www.app.com/story/news/crime/jersey-mayhem/2014/05/15/orthodox-jewish-divorce/2149822/ "Stun Guns Forced Orthodox Divorce, Prosecutors Say"], ''Asbury Park Press''&lt;/ref&gt; and culminated in the arrest of a group of rabbis from [[New York (state)|New York]] under the direction of '''Mendel Epstein''', including '''Jay Goldstein''', '''Binyamin Stimler''', and '''Martin Wolmark''', who were involved in the planned kidnapping and torture of a fictitious Jewish husband in [[Middlesex County, New Jersey]], with the purpose of obtaining from him a ''get''. Epstein and his men were found guilty of attempted kidnapping in 2015, and were sentenced to prison, while Epstein's son, '''David Epstein''', was acquitted.&lt;ref&gt;Mullen, Shannon (April 21, 2015) [http://www.app.com/story/news/local/jackson-lakewood/lakewood/2015/04/21/lakewood-rabbi-kidnapping-trial/26125057/ "Rabbi Guilty of Kidnapping Conspiracy, Jury Finds"], ''Asbury Park Press''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
{{Main article|Jewish views on marriage#Divorce}}
A Jewish man is allowed to divorce his wife for virtually any reason by first receiving her permission, and then giving her a [[Get (divorce document)|get]]. If she is unwilling, and his complaint against her is substantial, he can pursue a [[heter meah rabbanim]] and remarry, although one is rarely awarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewfaq.org/divorce.htm|title=Judaism 101: Divorce|website=www.jewfaq.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{rquote|right|You have to watch the man, what his habits are, where he goes, how and where you can grab him. If you have a plan, then you call the people who do the kidnapping... There is such a thing called a stun gun, and they put such a tape or something so that it shouldn't leave a mark on the surface. They administer electric shocks and it's not a dangerous thing that can damage or kill.|Epstein co-conspirator Jay Goldstein describing the gang's abduction and torture methods during a recorded phone call on December 28, 1996.&lt;ref name="Bad Rabbi"/&gt;}}
A Jewish woman seeking a divorce from her husband must present her complaint to a [[beth din]] with the implication of a serious physical blemish or character defect. The husband must be willing to divorce his wife, for if he gives the get unwillingly, the divorce is invalid, and any future offspring of the wife would be considered [[mamzer]]s. If the circumstances truly warrant a divorce and the husband is unwilling, the [[dayan (rabbinic judge)|dayan]] has the prerogative of instituting community shunning measures to "coerce him until he agrees," with physical force being reserved only for the rarest of cases.&lt;ref&gt;Malinowitz, Chaim; [http://www.jlaw.com/Articles/getart3.html "The New York State Get Bill and its Halachic Ramifications"]; ''Jewish Law Articles''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="times"&gt;Goldstein, Joseph; Schwirtz, Michael (October 11, 2013) [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/11/nyregion/rabbis-accused-in-kidnapping-plot-to-force-men-to-grant-divorces/ "Rabbis Said to Use Torture For Fee to Force Divorce"], ''The New York Times'' {{dead link|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="torture"&gt;Bandler, Jonathan; Lieberman, Steve (October 10, 2013) [https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/10/10/rabbis-fbi-divorce-sting/2959369/ "FBI Arrests N.Y. Rabbis in Jewish Divorce-gang Probe], ''USA Today''&lt;/ref&gt;

It was in this grey area of [[halakha]] that in the mid-1980s a [[rabbi]] from [[Brooklyn]], New York, Mendel Epstein, began to advocate for women seeking religious divorces from their husbands.&lt;ref name="Wild"&gt;Dickter, Adam (October 16, 2013) [https://jewishweek.timesofisrael.com/accused-kidnap-rabbi-known-for-wild-west-rules/ "Accused Kidnap Rabbi Known For ‘Wild West’ Rules"], ''The New York Jewish Week''&lt;/ref&gt; Dubbed '''The Prodfather''' by the press due to his boast of using a [[cattle prod]] against his victims, Epstein started a divorce-gang which coerced these men to give the ''get''s through the use of violence.&lt;ref&gt;Mullen, Shannon (December 15, 2015) [http://www.app.com/story/news/local/jackson-lakewood/lakewood/2015/12/15/lakewood-rabbi-epstein-divorce-gets/77351110/ "10-year Sentence for Lakewood 'Prodfather' Rabbi"], ''Asbury Park Press''&lt;/ref&gt; Although U.S. laws prohibit [[kidnapping]], [[assault]], and [[torture]], some rabbis have gone on record anonymously to sanction these otherwise "inhumane" acts against "angry husbands."&lt;ref&gt;Ben-Gedalyahu, Tzvi (October 10, 2013) [http://www.jewishpress.com/news/fbi-arrests-ny-rabbis-for-beating-husbands-refusing-divorce/2013/10/10/ "FBI Arrests NY Rabbis for Beating Husbands Who Refuse Divorce"], ''Jewish Press''&lt;/ref&gt; If a man got so scared from this treatment as to suffer a [[heart attack]], Epstein would instruct his gang to "Take a right turn and let him die."&lt;ref name="NYDN1"&gt;Blau, Reuven (April 22, 2015) [http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/orthodox-rabbi-guilty-kidnapping-beating-jewish-husbands-article-1.2193597/ "N.J. Jury Finds Orthodox Rabbi Guilty of Kidnap-Divorce Plot], ''New York Daily News''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, [[fathers' rights movement|Father's Rights]] activist Monty Weinstein staged a protest with twenty-five people outside Epstein's home, with some carrying signs that read "Stop Mendel Epstein!"&lt;ref name="Bad Rabbi"/&gt;

== Victims ==
* '''Abraham Rubin''': On October 23, 1996 in [[Borough Park, Brooklyn]], Rubin was shoved into a van, beaten and [[Electroshock weapon|stun-gunned]] in his genitals until he agreed to give his wife a get. After his 3-hour ordeal, he was left bruised, bloodied, handcuffed and blindfolded at the entrance to a cemetery. Charges were dropped against his attackers by Brooklyn [[district attorney]] [[Charles Hynes]] in 2000, after Rubin "could not identify any of his assailants."&lt;ref name="Bad Rabbi"&gt;Samaha, Albert (December 4, 2013) [http://www.villagevoice.com/news/bad-rabbi-tales-of-extortion-and-torture-depict-a-divorce-brokers-brutal-grip-on-the-orthodox-community-6440276 "Bad Rabbi: Tales of Extortion and Torture Depict a Divorce Broker's Brutal Grip on the Orthodox Community"], ''The Village Voice''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="times"/&gt;{{dead link|date=August 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;Saul, Josh; Italiano, Laura (October 11, 2013) [https://nypost.com/2013/10/11/orthodox-rabbis-beat-me-stun-gunned-my-genitals-suit/ "Rabbis beat me, stun-gunned my genitals"], ''New York Post''&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Stephen Weiss''': An accountant, Weiss came forward in 1998, alleging that his jaw, leg, and arm were broken in 1992 by members of a ring run by Epstein and Martin Wolmark, but no arrests were made. ''[[Newsday]]'' interviewed an additional dozen residents of Borough Park and [[Midwood, Brooklyn]], all of whom claimed that they were harassed, threatened, or assaulted by men working for their estranged wives. Hynes agreed to look into the charges but, despite pressure from the victims, declined to prosecute.&lt;ref name="Orthodox Hit"&gt;Shaer, Matthew (September 2, 2014) [https://www.gq.com/story/epstein-orthodox-hit-squad "Epstein Orthodox Hit Squad"], ''GQ''&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Israel Markowitz''': On December 1, 2009, Markowitz was lured from Brooklyn to [[Lakewood Township, New Jersey]] under the pretense of receiving employment at a [[Paper shredder|document shredding]] establishment.&lt;ref name="Guns Forced"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Officially Ties"&gt;Samaha, Albert (May 23, 2014) [http://www.villagevoice.com/news/indictment-officially-ties-rabbis-to-three-divorce-extortion-kidnappings-6675293 "Indictment Officially Ties Rabbis to Three Divorce Extortion Kidnappings"], ''The Village Voice''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gecan, Alex N.

* '''Yisrael Bryskman''': On October 16, 2010, Bryskman, an [[Israel]]i citizen, was lured from New York to the Lakewood home of David Wax, an accomplice of Epstein, where he was promised employment as a typist of [[Talmud]]ic texts.&lt;ref name="Officially Ties"/&gt; Bryskman entered Wax's home shortly before midnight, was shown into a second-story bedroom, and was immediately punched in the face, breaking his nose. He was then forced to the floor, blindfolded, handcuffed, and ankle-tied.&lt;ref name="December 15"/&gt; A pool of blood appeared on the carpet, ruining it. Wax, who wore a [[cowboy hat]] during the attack, presented Bryskman with a [[body bag]], "to get [you] used to the size."&lt;ref name="Violent Scheme"&gt;Hutchinson, Bill (May 6, 2014) [http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/n-rabbi-pleads-guilty-violent-scheme-force-jewish-divorce-article-1.1781952 "N.J. Rabbi Pleads Guilty to Violent Scheme to Force a Jewish Divorce"], ''New York Daily News''&lt;/ref&gt; He was then kicked in the ribs, burned with acid, and threatened to be urinated upon, [[rat torture|fed to rats]], and buried alive, until he agreed to give his wife a get.&lt;ref name="Orthodox Hit"/&gt; Wax was paid $100,000 from the wife's family for the document, half of which went to Epstein, and he attempted to extort an additional $50,000&lt;ref name="Guns Forced"/&gt; from Bryskman's father in Israel over the phone, threatening that if he didn't comply, he'd receive a "special gift - it's called a bullet...in your head."&lt;ref name="Bad Rabbi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Orthodox Hit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Violent Scheme"/&gt;
* '''Usher Chaimowitz''' and '''Menachem Teitelbaum''': On August 22, 2011, in Brooklyn, Chaimowitz and his roommate Teitelbaum were assaulted, tied up, and beaten for two hours until Chaimowitz agreed to give his wife a get. Teitelbaum was punched in the face, had four of his teeth knocked out, his head pushed through a wall, and his mouth stuffed with dirty socks when he tried to scream for help. When he asked why they were beating him, seeing that Chaimowitz was the one they were after, one of his attackers quoted the Talmudic dictum, "Woe to the evildoer, woe to his neighbor."&lt;ref name="December 15"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Men Hold"&gt;Jones, Abigail (April 8, 2015) [http://www.newsweek.com/2015/04/17/fighting-be-free-lengths-orthodox-jewish-women-will-go-get-320536.html "In Orthodox Jewish Divorce, Men Hold All the Cards"], ''Newsweek''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spoto, MaryAnn (March 2, 2015) [http://www.nj.com/ocean/index.ssf/2015/03/brooklyn_man_testifies_he_was_victim_in_lakewood_r.html "'Give A Divorce,' Attackers Yelled As They Beat Men, Victim Testifies In Lakewood Rabbi Trial"], ''NJ.com''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wax implicates Epstein ==
In October 2010, David Wax and his wife Judy were arrested for their part in the Bryskman kidnapping, and Wax subsequently agreed to testify as a government witness, claiming Epstein was the head of the operation and that his son David was present in the bedroom during the Bryskman beating.&lt;ref name="Trial Underway"&gt;Spoto, MaryAnn (February 18, 2015) [http://www.nj.com/ocean/index.ssf/2015/02/lakewood_rabbi_and_three_others.html"Lakewood Rabbi Trial Underway for Kidnap, Torture of Husbands"], ''NJ.com''&lt;/ref&gt; Their relationship dated back to the 1980s, when Epstein had forced a divorce for Wax's sister. The Bryskman case was what led federal authorities in New Jersey to begin their investigation of Mendel Epstein for his role in the crime.&lt;ref name="David Wax"&gt;Samaha, Albert (May 7, 2014) [https://www.villagevoice.com/2014/05/07/david-wax-pleads-guilty-implicates-mendel-epstein-in-nj-divorce-extortion-case/ "David Wax Pleads Guilty, Implicates Mendel Epstein in NJ Divorce Extortion Case"], ''The Village Voice''&lt;/ref&gt;

== FBI sting operation ==
In the summer of 2013, a woman dialed Martin Wolmark, an accomplice of Epstein, and told him a story about a husband who refused to give her a get.&lt;ref name="Bad Rabbi"/&gt; Wolmark said:

{{quote | You need special rabbis who are going to take this thing and see it through to the end...getting a guy like Mendel Epstein who's a hired hand...You need to get him to New York where someone either could harass him or nail him, plain and simple.&lt;ref name="For Role"&gt;(December 14, 2015) [https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/15/nyregion/rabbi-sentenced-for-role-in-divorce-coercion-ring.html "Rabbi Sentenced for Role in Divorce-Coercion Ring"], ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blau, Reuven (February 19, 2015) [http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/rabbi-forced-divorce-plot-spoke-hired-hand-call-article-1.2122195 "Rabbi Accused in Forced Divorce Plot is Called 'Hired Hand' who would 'Harass or Nail' Husband in Phone Recording"], ''New York Daily News''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On August 14, 2013, she visited Epstein in Lakewood with another man she said was her brother. Epstein said to the two visitors:

{{quote | This is an expensive thing to do. Basically what we are going to be doing is kidnapping a guy for a couple of hours and beating him up and torturing him and then getting him to give the get.&lt;ref name="Bad Rabbi"/&gt;}}

The man then asked about Epstein's effectiveness, to which he replied:

{{quote | Wait a minute here. I guarantee you that if you're in the van, you'd give a get to your wife. You probably love your wife, but you'd give a get when they finish with you. Hopefully, there won't even be a mark on him. We prefer not to leave a mark. Because then when you do, they do go to the police, the police look at the guy. . . and basically the reaction of the police is, if the guy does not have a mark on him, then, 'Is there some Jewish crazy affair here?' They don't get involved.&lt;ref name="Bad Rabbi"/&gt;}}

Epstein explained he would need $10,000 to approve the coercion at the [[beth din]], and $60,000 for the "tough guys", who would use [[karate]],&lt;ref name="Wild"/&gt; rope, a screwdriver, and plastic bags over the men's heads to get them to cooperate.&lt;ref name="Officially Ties"/&gt; And if all else fails, then:

{{quote | We take an electric cattle prod. If it can get a bull that weighs five tons to move, you put it in certain parts of the body and in one minute the guy will know.&lt;ref name="Bad Rabbi"/&gt;}}

Epstein also told the woman that he would not be present at the attack, planning instead to be out and about, and suggested that she do the same, explaining that being seen in public would provide them with an alibi.&lt;ref name="torture"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boyer, Barbara (January 25, 2017) [http://www.philly.com/philly/news/new_jersey/Rabbis-in-strong-arm-divorces-challenge-convictions.html"Rabbis in Strong-arm Religious Divorces Ask Court to Overturn Convictions"], ''Philly.com''&lt;/ref&gt;

The man and woman turned out to be undercover FBI agents.&lt;ref name="times"/&gt;{{dead link|date=August 2016}}&lt;ref name="Men Hold"/&gt;

== Arrests ==
On October 9, 2013, 8 men wearing [[Halloween mask]]s, [[ski masks]], and [[bandanas]] &amp;ndash; one wore a [[Metallica]] [[ T-shirt]] on top of his clothes &amp;ndash; came to a warehouse in [[Middlesex County, New Jersey]], where they [[Muscle contraction|flexed]] and [[Shadowboxing|shadow-boxed]] as they waited for their prey, the 'recalcitrant husband' who did not exist.&lt;ref name="Trial Underway"/&gt;&lt;ref name="New Details"&gt;Lieberman, Steve and Bandler, Jonathan (October 11, 2013).

Epstein was arrested separately in Brooklyn.&lt;ref name="twelve"&gt;(October 11, 2013) [http://westchester.news12.com/news/prominent-rabbi-mendel-epstein-arrested-in-divorce-extortion-case/ "Two Prominent Orthodox Jewish Rabbis Arrested in Divorce Extortion Case"]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''News12 Westchester''&lt;/ref&gt;

During a federal court hearing the following day in [[Trenton, New Jersey]], Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Gribko told a judge, "They didn't do it out of religious conviction. They did it for money."&lt;ref name="Divorce:Feds"/&gt;

On May 6, 2014, Wax pleaded guilty in federal court in New Jersey to conspiracy to commit kidnapping. He named the men arrested the previous October as his accomplices.&lt;ref name="David Wax"/&gt;

== Criminal trials ==
The trial of the main defendants commenced on February 18, 2015 at the [[United States District Court for the District of New Jersey]] in Trenton.&lt;ref name="Trial Underway"/&gt; On April 21, they appeared before District Judge [[Freda L. Wolfson]], whereupon Mendel Epstein was convicted of conspiracy to commit kidnapping, while accomplices Jay Goldstein and Binyamin Stimler were additionally convicted of attempted kidnapping. David Epstein was acquitted, in part by defence attorney Henry Mazurek's contention that David was in a business meeting in [[Cincinnati]] during Usher Chaimowitz's beating.&lt;ref name="Trial Underway"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spoto, MaryAnn (March 26, 2015) [http://www.nj.com/ocean/index.ssf/2015/03/lakewood_rabbis_son_wasnt_involved_in_forced_divor.html "Lakewood Rabbi's Son Wasn't Involved in Forced Divorce, Executive Testifies"], ''NJ.com''&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 14, Martin Wolmark, who had pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit extortion, was sentenced to more than 3 years in prison.&lt;ref name="For Role"/&gt; The next day, at his own sentencing, Mendel Epstein told the judge: 

{{quote | Over the years, I guess, I got caught up in my tough guy image. Truthfully, it helped me &amp;ndash; the reputation &amp;ndash; convince many of these reprobates to do the right thing."&lt;ref name="Rabbi Sentenced"&gt;Spoto, MaryAnn (December 15, 2015) [http://www.nj.com/ocean/index.ssf/2015/12/lakewood_rabbi_sentenced_to_10_years_in_prison_for.html"Lakewood Rabbi Sentenced to 10 years in Prison for Divorce Kidnappings"], ''NJ.com''&lt;/ref&gt;}} 

Epstein and Stimler were sentenced to 10 years and 3 years respectively. Wolfson said during the proceeding that "No one is permitted to commit acts of violence against another," and that the sentence was necessary in order to deter others in the [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] community from engaging in similar paid vigilantism.&lt;ref name="Rabbi Sentenced"/&gt;

One day later, Goldstein was sentenced to 8 years imprisonment. Six other co-defendants also pleaded guilty before trial, and were sentenced to up to 4 years.&lt;ref name="NYDN1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="December 15"&gt;{{cite web|author1=U.S. Attorney’s Office District of New Jersey|title=Two Orthodox Jewish Rabbis Sentenced To Prison For Conspiring To Kidnap Jewish Husbands, Force Them To Consent To Religious Divorces|url=https://www.justice.gov/usao-nj/pr/two-orthodox-jewish-rabbis-sentenced-prison-conspiring-kidnap-jewish-husbands-force-them|date=December 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(Apr 21, 2015) [https://www.fbi.gov/newark/press-releases/2015/three-orthodox-jewish-rabbis-convicted-of-conpsiracy-to-kidnap-jewish-husbands-in-order-to-force-them-to-consent-to-religious-divorces/ "Three Orthodox Jewish Rabbis Convicted of Conspiracy to Kidnap Jewish Husbands in Order to Force Them to Consent to Religious Divorces"], ''U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=U.S. Attorney’s Office District of New Jersey|title=Orthodox Jewish Rabbi Sentenced To Eight Years In Prison For Conspiring To Kidnap Jewish Husbands, Force Them To Consent To Religious Divorces|url=https://www.justice.gov/usao-nj/pr/orthodox-jewish-rabbi-sentenced-eight-years-prison-conspiring-kidnap-jewish-husbands|date=December 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reactions ==
Rabbinical judge David Eidensohn of Monsey, New York said, "I'm shocked that people who call themselves rabbis would get involved in coercion." According to Eidensohn, if a woman obtains a get in such a manner and remarries, "her marriage is not legal and she would be considered living in sin. If she has children, the children are considered born out of wedlock, and that's considered a disgrace in the community."&lt;ref name="New Details"/&gt;

[[Samuel Heilman]], professor of sociology and Jewish studies at [[Queens College, City University of New York|Queens College]] said, "Using force, that's the way it used to be done centuries ago. Most Jews don't operate like that anymore, but in this community... it's a sort of fundamentalist view."&lt;ref&gt;Nicosia, Mareesa (October 13, 2013).

[[Moshe David Tendler]], rabbi and professor of medical ethics at [[Yeshiva University]] said, "The idea that a beth din can issue an order for coercion is baloney, a hoax." While conceding that he had "been with [Epstein] on matters," Tendler nevertheless considered him "unreliable."&lt;ref name="New Details"/&gt;

'''Air rights''' are the property interest in the "space" above the earth's surface. Generally speaking, owning, or renting, land or a [[building]] includes the right to use and develop the space above the land without interference by others.

This legal concept is encoded in the Latin phrase ''[[Cuius est solum, eius est usque ad coelum et ad inferos]]'' ("''Whoever owns the soil, it is theirs up to Heaven and down to Hell''."), which appears in [[medieval Roman law]] and is credited to 13th-century [[glossator]] [[Accursius]]; it was notably popularized in [[common law]] in ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'' (1766) by [[William Blackstone]]; see [[Cuius est solum, eius est usque ad coelum et ad inferos#Origins|origins of phrase]] for details.&lt;!-- See refs there --&gt;

== Air travel ==
&lt;!---knowledgeable people can add other countries here, but the first part is germane to all countries---&gt;
{{Further information|Flyover rights}}
Property rights defined by points on the ground were once believed to extend indefinitely upward. This notion remained unchallenged before [[air travel]] became popular in the early 20th century. To promote air transport, legislators established a legal right for the public to transit at high altitudes, regardless of real estate ownership.&lt;ref&gt;Paris Convention of 1919 (Convention for the Regulation of Aerial Navigation, Oct. 13, 1919, 11 L.N.T.S. 173) and the Pan American Convention on Commercial Aviation, U.S.-Cuba, Feb. 20, 1928, see 47 Stat. 1901)&lt;/ref&gt;  Both the public easement in the space at these higher altitudes and landowner rights to the exclusive use of the airspace at lower altitudes have been well documented by the U.S. judiciary.

New technologies have again raised questions about ownership of "space" and the upward bounds of national sovereignty.  With the advent of space travel above earth's atmosphere, the height at which national sovereignty extends and therefore nations can regulate transit is often debated.

===United States===
[[File:Building cantilever New York.JPG|thumb|right|A building is cantilevered over two other buildings in [[New York City]]]]
In the [[United States]], the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) has the sole authority to control all "publicly owned" [[airspace]], exclusively determining the rules and requirements for its use.&lt;ref&gt;49 U.S.C. 180, 49 U.S.C.A. 18 , §&amp;nbsp;40103 "use of airspace"&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, the Federal Aviation Act provides that: "The [[Federal government of the United States|United States Government]] has exclusive sovereignty of airspace of the United States",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/49/40103- |title=49 U.S.C. 40103(a)(1) |accessdate=2009-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but not all the airspace is "possessed" by the United States.  For non-public airspace, Congress has provided authority for the FAA to purchase this non-public airspace near airports to accommodate planes taking off and landing.&lt;ref&gt;49 U.S.C §&amp;nbsp;40110&lt;/ref&gt;  The "navigable airspace" in which the public has a right of transit without affecting a landowner's property rights has been set at the height of 500&amp;nbsp;ft in urban or suburban areas,&lt;ref&gt;"Argent v. U.S. 124 F.3rd 1277,1281 (1997) citing Lacey v. United States, 219 Ct.Cl. 551, 595 F.2d 614, 616 (1979) (treating 500 feet as line of demarcation between compensatable property taking and non-compensatable overflights); Matson v. United States, 145 Ct.Cl. 225, 171 F.Supp. 283, 286 (1959) (providing compensation for flights under 500 feet).Aaron v. United States, 160 Ct.Cl. 295, 311 F.2d 798, 801 (1963) (allowing claims based on flights below 500ft, while denying those based on flights over 500ft).”&lt;/ref&gt; and 360 feet above the surface or tallest structure in rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. v Causby 328 U.S. 256,264-266 (1946) and Causby v U.S. 75 F.262 Ct.Cl (1948)&lt;/ref&gt;   The exact altitude(s) at which the  airspace over private land becomes "public" airspace, or where the upward bounds of national sovereignty extends is often debated, but the Supreme Court rulings and space treaties are clear.  A landowner's domain extends up to at least 365 feet above the ground. see [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17209011020287234065 Causby v US (1946)],&lt;ref&gt;U.S. v Causby 328 U.S. 256,264-266 (1946) and Causby v U.S. 75 F.262 Ct.Cl (1948)&lt;/ref&gt; and no nation can prevent orbits above the Earth's atmosphere.

The FAA is required to pay financial compensation to property owners when their property interests are taken for overflights.   Compensated landowners may then be required to waive any putative damages for interference with "air rights" in order to avoid [[lawsuit]]s from future owners' nuisance claims against low flying aircraft.  This is called a navigation or navigational [[easement]].

The low cost of [[unmanned aerial vehicle]]s (also called drones) in the 2000s re-raised legal questions regarding whose permission is required to fly at low altitudes; the landowner, the FAA or both.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=317074394&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the FAA reestablished that navigable airspace is the space above 500 feet,&lt;ref&gt;Doc. No. 18334, 54 FR 34294, Aug. 18, 1989, as amended by Amdt. 91-311, 75 FR 5223, Feb. 1, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; the FAA also set regulations which allow drones to fly below 400 feet in order to prevent interference with planes above that height.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-06-28/pdf/2016-15079.pdf F.R. 2016 6-28-2016 Pgs 42063- 42214 DOC #: 2016-15079]&lt;/ref&gt;  The FAA's actions are expected to see challenges in the judiciary.{{fact|date=December 2017}}

== Railroads and air rights ==
[[Rail transport|Railroads]] were the first companies to realize the potential of making money from their air rights. A good example of this is [[Grand Central Terminal]] in [[New York City]], where [[William J. Wilgus]], chief engineer of the [[New York Central Railroad|New York Central and Hudson River Railroad]], devised a plan to earn profit from air rights. At first, the railroad simply constructed a platform above the rail yards to allow for the development of buildings overhead. By 1954, the railroad began to realize it could sell more air rights and Grand Central Terminal was proposed to be replaced by a 50-story tower. This is how the [[MetLife Building|Pan Am Building]] came to be built next to the station, after public protest regarding the demolition of Grand Central Terminal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gray |first=Christopher |title=Grand Central Terminal; The 23-Story, Beaux-Arts 1913 Tower That Wasn't |newspaper=The New York Times |date=October 11, 1998 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/11/realestate/streetscapes-grand-central-terminal-23-story-beaux-arts-1913-tower-that-wasn-t.html |accessdate=2009-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach has been used in Chicago since the construction of the [[One Prudential Plaza|Prudential Building]] in 1955 above active railroad tracks of the Illinois Central Railroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Dedicate New Prudential 41 Story Building |last=Fuller|first=Ernest |date=December 9, 1955 |url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1955/12/09/page/13/article/dedicate-new-prudential-41-story-building |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |accessdate=September 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, to the west of the Chicago River, [[River Point]] and [[150 North Riverside]] were built above tracks leading to the Amtrak station.

Building on platforms over railroad tracks is still potentially very profitable. In the mid-2000s, New York's [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] (MTA) attempted to sell air rights to the [[New York Jets]] so that they could build the [[West Side Stadium]] over Manhattan's [[West Side Yard]], near [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|Penn Station]], as part of the [[Hudson Yards Redevelopment]]. The [[Hudson Yards (development)|Hudson Yards mega-development]] was eventually built over the rail yard. In Brooklyn, the [[Barclays Center]] and [[Pacific Park, Brooklyn|Pacific Park]] have been constructed over Atlantic Yards.

== Roads and air rights ==
Similar to railroads, builders of [[highway]]s have proposed selling their air rights; [[Boston]] did this in connection with the [[Big Dig (Boston, Massachusetts)|Big Dig]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=McCown |first=James |date=September 4, 2002 |title=Boston Air Rights |journal=Architecture Week |volume=113 |issue=4 |url=http://www.architectureweek.com/2002/0904/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Los Angeles|city of Los Angeles]] funded a $100,000 feasibility study [[RFP]] in January 2007 to explore building a freeway cap park in [[Hollywood]].  The park would be built above [[U.S. Route 101 in California|US highway 101]] and contain {{convert|24|acre|m2}} of new parkland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hollywoodfreewaycentralpark.org/ » Community-Wide Hollywood Central Park Meeting&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Air rights in development ==
The owner of the land has the exclusive development rights in the 'space' above his lands. Under common law, building a 'hangover' that breaks the vertical plane of a neighbor's property is a trespass and the property owner has the right to remove the offending structure. The airspace is property and retains developmental rights which can be sold or transferred. Thus in a dense downtown area, each building in the area may have the right to thirty-five stories of airspace above his own property. The owners of an older building of only three stories high could make a great deal of money by selling their building and allowing a thirty-five-story skyscraper to be built in its place. For example, a skyscraper developer may purchase the unused airspace from an adjacent landowner in order to develop a broader building. In November 2005, Christ Church in New York sold its vertical development rights for a record $430 per square foot, making more than $30 million on the sale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bagli |first=Charles V. |title=$430 a Square Foot, for Air?

'''Allofeeding''' is a type of [[Evolutionary models of food sharing|food sharing]] [[Behavior|behaviour]] observed in [[Cooperative breeding|cooperatively breed]]ing species of [[bird]]s. Allofeeding refers to a parent, sibling or unrelated adult bird feeding [[altricial]] [[hatchling]]s, which are dependent on [[parental care]] for their survival.&lt;ref name="barrows"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=yaXMBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA13&amp;dq=evolution+of+allofeeding&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjE9ePx_sHRAhWLq1QKHUJ1CC8Q6AEINjAF#v=onepage&amp;q=evolution%20of%20allofeeding&amp;f=false|title=Animal Behavior Desk Reference|last=Barrows|first=Edward M.|publisher=CRC Press|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4398-3652-1|edition=3rd|location=Boca Raton, FL}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allofeeding also refers to food sharing between adults of the same species.&lt;ref name="handicap"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=ImjqhNqjiqsC&amp;pg=PA137&amp;dq=evolution+of+allofeeding&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi-jfi2gMLRAhVIhlQKHVOQAHE4ChDoAQgfMAE#v=onepage&amp;q=evolution%20of%20allofeeding&amp;f=false|title=The Handicap Principle: A Missing Piece of Darwin's Puzzle|last1=Zahavi|first1=Amotz|last2=Zahavi|first2=Avishag|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=1997|isbn=0-19-510035-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allofeeding can occur between mates during mating rituals, [[Courtship display|courtship]], egg laying or incubation, between peers of the same species, or as a form of parental care.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Susan M.|date=1980|title=Demand Behavior: A New Interpretation of Courtship Feeding|jstor=1367395|journal=The Condor|volume=82|issue=3|pages=291–295|doi=10.2307/1367395}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":33"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Halley|first=Matthew R.|last2=Holmes|first2=Aaron L.|last3=Robinson|first3=W.

Allofeeding evolved for different reasons in different species of birds. While Sagebrush Brewer’s Sparrows allofeed to reduce [[predation]] during incubation, Sichuan Jays allofeed to increase a female’s nutritional level prior to egg laying, and Chinstrap Penguins allofeed to strengthen the bond between the pair during chick guarding.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":44"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jing|first=Yu|last2=Fang|first2=Yun|last3=Strickland|first3=Dan|last4=Lu|first4=Nan|last5=Sun|first5=Yue-Hua|date=2009|title=Alloparenting in the Rare Sichuan Jay (Perisoreus Internigrans) - Cuidado Aloparental en la Especie Rara Perisoreus internigrans|journal=The Condor|volume=111|issue=4|pages=662–667|doi=10.1525/cond.2009.080114|jstor=10.1525/cond.2009.080114}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":54"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mori|first=Yoshihisa|last2=Kokubun|first2=Nobuo|last3=Shin|first3=Hyoung-Chul|last4=Takahashi|first4=Akinori|date=2010-10-01|title=An observation of between-mates feeding behaviour in chick-guarding chinstrap penguins|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00300-010-0842-8|journal=Polar Biology|language=en|volume=33|issue=10|pages=1437–1438|doi=10.1007/s00300-010-0842-8|issn=0722-4060}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

While parental allofeeding is a common form of parental care among many species of birds, the practice is not inherently restricted to biological parents and their young, and is often done for reasons unrelated to the well-being of the chicks. Arabian Bablers, for instance, peer allofeed in an attempt at increasing their social rank, whereas the King Penguin considers those 'non-breeders' who allofeed chicks to be  altruistic and highly revered. And the far more practical Barn Owl, of course, peer allofeeds merely to reduce sibling rivalry/competition during meal times.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carlisle|first=Tamsie R.|last2=Zahavi|first2=Amotz|date=1986-04-01|title=Helping at the nest, allofeeding and social status in immature arabian babblers|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00299665|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|language=en|volume=18|issue=5|pages=339–351|doi=10.1007/BF00299665|issn=0340-5443}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":63"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roulin|first=A.|last2=Monstiers|first2=B.

Although many species of birds exhibit allofeeding, there are some species that do not perform allofeeding, such as Siberian Jays.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt;

== Allofeeding between mates ==
Many species of migratory [[songbird]]s display allofeeding during the [[incubation period]].&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; During the incubation period, a male songbird will feed its mate, while she sits on the eggs through beak-to-beak interaction.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; This allofeeding behaviour is suggested to be adaptive because the male is indirectly investing in its offspring.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; The male uses its energy to forage and retrieve food, and to feed the female.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; This behaviour of the male reduces nutritional stress of the female because it reduces the amount of time the female spends foraging.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; In addition, the allofeeding behaviour decreases the number of times a female has to leave the nest, which in turn extends the incubation period and reduces the risk of nest being detected by a predator.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; Overall, allofeeding behaviour contributes to increased fitness and is therefore considered advantageous.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; However, Nolan (1958) theorizes that allofeeding is a non-adaptive and is derived from anticipatory parental care.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt;

Allofeeding during the incubation period can also transpire through both the male and the female interchangeably feeding each other via beak-to-beak interactions, while a mate receiving the food incubates the eggs.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; Once feeding is completed, the recipient now becomes the feeder and the mate that was just foraging incubates the eggs. For example, Sagebrush Brewer’s Sparrows (''Spizella breweri breweri'') allofeed in this manner.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; A recent study by Halley et al., 2015, examined allofeeding in twenty-four nests of Sagebrush Brewer’s Sparrows.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; This study revealed that allofeeding occurred at low frequencies (55%) in nests with biparental incubation and no allofeeding occurred in uniparental nests.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; This study suggests that allofeeding is an intraspecific signal required to maintain social bonds between mates, in addition to increasing the nutrition levels of females and concealment of the nest.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; Furthermore, the study found that incubation sessions per hour were higher in biparental nests with allofeeding than in biparental nests without allofeeding.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; These findings indicate that allofeeding is beneficial because it reduces the risk of predation from visually oriented predators through increased nest concealment,&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; which can maximize the fitness of males while increasing the fitness of females.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt;

There have been many documented observations of allofeeding between mates (mate allofeeding).&lt;ref name=":54" /&gt; However, in penguins allofeeding between mates is rare.&lt;ref name=":54" /&gt; In 2010, [[Chinstrap penguin|Chinstrap Penguins]] (''P. antarctica'') allofeeding was reported during the period of chick guarding.&lt;ref name=":54" /&gt; The researchers witnessed a male feeding a female, which had a large chick in its nest.&lt;ref name=":54" /&gt; The behaviour was engaged by the female frequently pecking the side of the male’s bill to stimulate the male to regurgitate its food.&lt;ref name=":54" /&gt; This resulted in the male regurgitating its food into the female’s open mouth. This allofeeding behaviour was identical to the manner in which a chick begs its parent for food.&lt;ref name=":54" /&gt; Notably, during this behaviour the female kept the attention of male when the chick tried to gain the male’s attention.&lt;ref name=":54" /&gt; It is proposed that mate allofeeding in Chinstrap Penguins was performed to strengthen the bond between the pair.&lt;ref name=":54" /&gt;

Allofeeding between mates can also occur during courtship.&lt;ref name=":54" /&gt; Courtship allofeeding occurs in half of bird subfamilies and mainly appears in monogamous bird species.&lt;ref name=":54" /&gt; Courtship allofeeding is hypothesized to strengthen the bond between pairs or increase a female’s nutritional level before laying eggs.&lt;ref name=":54" /&gt; For example, in the Sichuan Jay ([[Sichuan jay|''P. internigrans'']]), females are fed by only one male during courtship.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt; It is suggested that allofeeding the female during courtship, increases a female’s nutritional level before egg laying.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt; This behaviour was also recorded in the Grey Jays (''[[Grey jay|P. canadensis]]'').&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt;  Other species of birds display allofeeding during courtship. Additionally, courtship allofeeding in some birds species is hypothesized to strengthen the bond between pairs.&lt;ref name=":54" /&gt;

=== ''Aptenodytes patagonicus'' ===
[[File:Emperor-feeding_hg.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Emperor-feeding_hg.jpg|thumb|Emperor Penguin (''Aptenodytes patagonicus)'' feeding its offspring]]
A parent feeding a non-biological chick via bill-to-bill interactions is a form of allofeeding.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lecomte|first=Nicolas|last2=Kuntz|first2=Gregoire|last3=Lambert|first3=Nicolas|last4=Gendner|first4=Jean-Paul|last5=Handrich|first5=Yves|last6=Maho|first6=Yvon Le|last7=Bost|first7=Charles-André|title=Alloparental feeding in the king penguin|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0003347205004173|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=71|issue=2|pages=457–462|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2005.07.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jouventin|first=Pierre|last2=Barbraud|first2=Christophe|last3=Rubin|first3=Michel|title=Adoption in the emperor penguin, Aptenodytes forsteri|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/0003-3472(95)80102-2|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=50|issue=4|pages=1023–1029|doi=10.1016/0003-3472(95)80102-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parental allofeeding occurs in all altricial species of birds to ensure proper growth, development, and to prevent starvation of their offspring.&lt;ref name=":113"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eggers|first=Sönke|last2=Griesser|first2=Michael|last3=Ekman|first3=Jan|date=2005-01-01|title=Predator-induced plasticity in nest visitation rates in the Siberian jay (Perisoreus infaustus)|url=http://academic.oup.com/beheco/article/16/1/309/206728/Predatorinduced-plasticity-in-nest-visitation|journal=Behavioral Ecology|language=en|volume=16|issue=1|pages=309–315|doi=10.1093/beheco/arh163|issn=1045-2249}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of allofeeding has been shown to be a form of parental care in some species, such as in King Penguins ([[King penguin|''A. patagonicus'']]).&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; King Penguins are pelagic seabirds.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; King Penguin chicks form dense groups called crèches during winter for social thermoregulation when food availability is low.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; The formation of crèches results from the parents interchangeably leaving starving chicks to gather food from the sea.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; A study by Lecomte et al., 2015 examined the allofeeding behaviour in King Penguins, in which they marked the white underbellies of 74 non-breeding adults and 103 breeding pairs with a unique dark colouring called dye-mark code of Nyanzol-D.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Lecomte et al. (2015) found 22% of the marked adults feed 65% of the chicks in crèches, revealing that allofeeding behaviour was most common during the breeding season.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Lecomte et al. (2015) also identified that most of the 22% of adult King Penguins demonstrating allofeeding behaviour were unable to successfully breed along with few breeders performing the behaviour.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; The allofeeding behaviour resulted in more feedings for chicks,&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; which is consistent with study by Pierre et al. (1994) that showed that allofeeding in penguins increases the chick growth rate from 35g/day to 190g/day.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; From these results, Lecomte et al., (2015) concluded that allofeeding increased the survival rate of chicks in crèches.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; The results imply that parental allofeeding in King Penguins is an altruistic behaviour, where allofeeding benefits the young at a cost to the non-biological parent.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Notably, no direct benefits to the non-biological parents have been described.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; The cost of allofeeding non-biological chicks resulted in no detrimental effects to the fitness of the [[Alloparenting|alloparent]], because the cost of allofeeding is low (several grams) when compared to the nutritional costs of an adult king penguin, which is several kilograms.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; However, it is suggested that allofeeding many chicks may cost each chick lost meals that can cause negative effects on the fitness of allofed chicks.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; In addition, allofeeding decreases when non-biological parents had offspring.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

=== ''Pseudomonas antarctica'' ===
The [[Chinstrap penguin|Chinstrap Penguin]] (''P. antarctica'') is another species of penguin that displays allofeeding.&lt;ref name=":54" /&gt; Allofeeding in the Chinstrap Penguin has been observed between the female and its offspring.&lt;ref name=":54" /&gt; Similar to mate allofeeding in this species, the offspring of a female will peck the side of the female’s bill to signal the female to regurgitate its food into the chick's open mouth.&lt;ref name=":54" /&gt;

=== ''Perisoreus internigrans'' ===
In Sichuan Jays ([[Sichuan jay|''P. Internigrans'']]), females are not the only sex that participates in the allofeeding of their offspring.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt; During their first week of life, the chicks are only fed by the male.&lt;ref name=":73"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://britishbirds.co.uk/article/studies-of-less-familiar-birds-162-siberian-jay/|title=Studies of less Familiar birds 162 Siberian Jay - British Birds|last=Blomgren|first=Arne Blomgren|date=|work=British Birds|access-date=2018-03-12|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The male forages and stores food in a pouch within its throat. At the nest, the male regurgitates the semi-digested food from its pouch into the mouths of its chicks.&lt;ref name=":73" /&gt; After the first week, the male continues to feed the chicks while the female begins feeding the chicks.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt; The female uses the same method as the male.&lt;ref name=":73" /&gt;

== Peer allofeeding ==

=== ''Turdoides sqamiceps'' ===
There have been many reported cases of allofeeding between siblings in several species of birds.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; For example, the Arabian Babblers ([[Arabian babbler|''T. sqamiceps'']]) are a territorial, desert inhibiting species of bird that participate in cooperative breeding.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; In this species, non-breeders show numerous types of cooperative behaviour, including allofeeding.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;  Adult and immature Babblers, as well as previous and newly fledged Babblers, will frequently engage in allofeeding behaviour.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

Carlisle et al. (1986) revealed that Arabian Babblers participate in peer allofeeding in order to increase social rank, which increases fitness.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; This allofeeding behaviour is supported by the Zahavi's hypothesis.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; An individual (a dominate Babbler) can increase in social rank by allofed a subordinate Babbler.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; On the contrary, an individual (a subordinate Babbler) can decrease in social rank when they are allofed by a dominate Babbler.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;  Subordinate Babblers have been observed refusing to be allofeed by dominate Babbler.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; The refusal resulted in the dominate Babbler becoming aggressive with the subordinate - hitting or chasing the subordinate.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; Dominate Babblers also showed the same aggressive behaviours when a subordinate tried to allofeed it.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

=== ''Tyto alba'' ===
Another species that exhibits peer allofeeding is the [[Barn owl|Barn Owl]] (''T. alba'').&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt; Barn Owl nest siblings establish a hierarchy for the sharing of food resources via vocal negotiations.&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt; It is suggested that Barn Owl nest siblings show peer allofeeding to reduce sibling competition in the food sharing hierarchy.&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt; Peer allofeeding observed in 60 nestling pairs revealed that the behaviour occurs by a donor sibling placing the food item on the ground in front of the receiver sibling, which transfers the food item to its bill using its talons.&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt; Alternatively, the donor sibling uses its bill to place the food item in the bill of the receiver sibling.&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt; As well, peer allofeeding behaviour in Barn Owl siblings is proposed to increase the [[inclusive fitness]] of the peer performing the allofeeding.&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt;

== Intraspecific allofeeding ==

=== ''Perisoreus Internigrans'' ===
[[File:Perisoreus_canadensis_feeding_at_nest.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Perisoreus_canadensis_feeding_at_nest.jpg|thumb|Gray Jays (''Perisoreus canadensis)'' feeding offspring at the nest]]
Intraspecific allofeeding in Sichuan Jays (''[[Sichuan jay|P. internigrans]]'') is performed during the nestling and fledging period by non-breeders.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt; One to three non-breeders support a nesting breeding pair by feeding the chicks, regurgitating the food from their throat pouches.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":73" /&gt; In 2009, Jing et al. determined that two non-breeders contributed to 44% of feedings in the nest of two Sichuan Jays.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt;  Jing et al. (2009) suggest that allofeeding behaviour contributes to increased nest survival.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt;

In Sichuan Jays, allofeeding is hypothesized to be evolutionary selected.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt; In this species, two to three non-breeders will allofeed the young of a breeding pair.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt; The large body mass (21% heavier than Siberian Jays) of the Sichuan Jays, and the presence of more than one non-breeder, allows one non-breeder to ward off a predator while another non-breeder protects the young from additional predators.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt; Both the large body mass of the non-breeders and the presence of multiple non-breeders reduces the risk of injury or death when predators are encountered.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt; This reveals that the benefits of allofeeding the young outweighs the cost of injury or death of the non-breeder and/or chick when more than one non-breeder is present.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt; Peer allofeeding has also been observed in the Gray Jay (''[[Grey jay|P. canadensis]]'').&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt; In the Gray Jay, non-breeders allofeed the young after fledging.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt;

Not all species of jays allofeed their young, such as the Siberian Jay (''[[Siberian jay|P. infaustus]]'').&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt; In the Siberian Jays, non-breeders do not allofeed the chicks of a breeding pair.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt; It is predicted that Siberian Jays do not display allofeeding because the cost of predation is too high.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt; Siberian Jays are continuously threatened by a more dangerous predators, the Eurasian Sparrowhawk and Northern Goshawk, then Gray Jays, which are threatened by Eurasian red squirrel.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt;  One non-breeder per breeding pair and the small size (21% less body mass than the Sichuan Jays) of the Siberian Jays, in combination with continuous risk of predation, reveals that the non-breeding Siberian Jays are unable to confront predators and protect the nest simultaneously.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt; This indicates that the cost of allofeeding the young is more costly to the non-breeder when one non-breeder is present because an encounter with a predator increases the risk of injury and death of both the young and the non-breeder.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt; This reveals that the benefit of allofeeding the young does not exceed the cost of injury or death of non-breeder and/or young.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt; This is consistent with the predator-avoidance hypothesis, suggesting that the cost of allofeeding in the Siberian Jays prevents allofeeding from being evolutionary selected.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt;

'''BDSM''' is a variety of often [[Eroticism|erotic]] practices or [[Sexual roleplay|roleplaying]] involving [[bondage (BDSM)|bondage]], [[discipline (BDSM)|discipline]], [[dominance and submission]], [[sadomasochism]], and other related interpersonal dynamics. Given the wide range of practices, some of which may be engaged in by people who do not consider themselves as practicing BDSM, inclusion in the BDSM community or subculture is usually dependent upon [[self-identification]] and shared experience.

[[File:BDSM acronym.svg|thumb|The BDSM initialism.]]
The term "BDSM" is first recorded in a [[Usenet]] posting from 1991,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/14168#eid289098363|title = BDSM ''n.'' (in entry B, ''n.'')|date = June 2013|accessdate = 29 November 2015|website = Oxford English Dictionary Online|publisher = Oxford University Press|subscription = yes|edition = draft}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is interpreted as a combination of the abbreviations B/D (Bondage and Discipline), D/s (Dominance and submission), and S/M (Sadism and Masochism). BDSM is now used as a catch-all phrase covering a wide range of activities, forms of [[interpersonal relationship]]s, and distinct subcultures. BDSM communities generally welcome anyone with a non-normative streak who identifies with the community; this may include [[cross-dresser]]s, [[body modification]] enthusiasts, [[animal roleplay]]ers, [[rubber fetishism|rubber fetishists]], and others.

Activities and relationships within a BDSM context are often characterized by the participants taking on complementary, but unequal roles; thus, the idea of [[Consent (BDSM)|informed consent]] of both the partners is essential. The terms "submissive" and "dominant" are often used to distinguish these roles: the dominant partner ("dom") takes psychological control over the submissive ("sub"). The terms "top" and "bottom" are also used: the top is the instigator of an action while the bottom is the receiver of the action. The two sets of terms are subtly different: for example, someone may choose to act as bottom to another person, for example, by being whipped, purely recreationally, without any implication of being psychologically dominated by them, or a submissive may be ordered to massage their dominant partner.  Despite the bottom performing the action and the top receiving they have not necessarily switched roles.

The abbreviations "sub" and "dom" are frequently used instead of "submissive" and "dominant". Sometimes the female-specific terms "mistress", "domme" or "[[dominatrix]]" are used to describe a dominant woman, instead of the gender-neutral term "dom". Individuals who can change between top/dominant and bottom/submissive roles—whether from relationship to relationship or within a given relationship—are known as ''[[Top, bottom, switch (BDSM)#Switch|switches]]''. The precise definition of roles and self-identification is a common subject of debate within the community.&lt;ref name="Terms"&gt;{{cite web|last=Grau|first=Johnson|url=http://www.leathernroses.com/generalbdsm/ssbbfaqdefines.htm|title=What do B&amp;D, S&amp;M, D&amp;S, "top", "bottom" mean|publisher=Leather Roses|date=1995|accessdate=27 January 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080111223259/http://www.leathernroses.com/generalbdsm/ssbbfaqdefines.htm| archivedate= 11 January 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fundamentals ==

[[File:Man Cuffed to Bedrail.jpg|thumb|upright|A man handcuffed to a bed and blindfolded.]]

"BDSM" is an umbrella term for certain kinds of erotic behavior between consenting adults. There are distinct [[subculture]]s under this umbrella term. Terminology for roles varies widely among the subcultures. ''[[Top (BDSM)|Top]]'' and ''[[Top (BDSM)|dominant]]'' are widely used for those partner(s) in the relationship or activity who are, respectively, the physically active or controlling participants. ''[[Bottom (BDSM)|Bottom]]'' and ''[[Bottom (BDSM)|submissive]]'' are widely used for those partner(s) in the relationship or activity who are, respectively, the physically receptive or controlled participants. The interaction between tops and bottoms—where physical or mental control of the bottom is surrendered to the top—is sometimes known as "power exchange", whether in the context of an encounter or a relationship.&lt;ref name="bdsmdict"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.xeromag.com/fvbdglossary.html |title=Dictionary of BDSM Terms |accessdate=26 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BDSM actions can often take place during a specific period of time agreed to by both parties, referred to as "play", a "scene", or a "session". Participants usually derive pleasure from this, even though many of the practices—such as inflicting pain or [[erotic humiliation|humiliation]] or being restrained — would be unpleasant under other circumstances. Explicit [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]], such as [[sexual penetration]], may occur within a session, but is not essential.&lt;ref name='sexual'&gt;{{Cite book |first1=Phillip |last1=Miller |first2=Molly |last2=Devon |first3=William A. |last3=Granzig |title=Screw the Roses, Send Me the Thorns: The Romance and Sexual Sorcery of Sadomasochism |page=55 |publisher=Mystic Rose Books |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-9645960-0-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such explicit sexual interaction is, for legal reasons, seen only rarely in public play spaces, and it is sometimes specifically banned by the rules of a party or playspace. Whether it is a public "playspace"—ranging from a party at an established community dungeon to a hosted play "zone" at a nightclub or social event—the parameters of allowance can vary. Some have a policy of [[panties]]/[[nipple sticker]] for women (underwear for men) and some allow full [[nudity]] with explicit sexual interaction allowed.&lt;ref name="bdsmdict" /&gt;

[[File:Caged woman.jpg|thumb|upright|A caged woman at [[Folsom Street Fair]], USA. The red marks on her body are from consensual whipping done at the Fair.]]
The fundamental principles for the exercise of BDSM require that it should be performed with the informed consent of all involved parties. Since the 1980s, many practitioners and organizations have adopted the motto (originally from the statement of purpose of GMSMA—a gay SM activist organization) "[[safe, sane and consensual]]", commonly abbreviated as "SSC", which means that everything is based on safe activities, that all participants be of sufficiently sound/sane mind to consent, and that all participants do consent.&lt;ref&gt;Bill Henkin, Sybil Holiday: Consensual Sadomasochism : How to Talk About It and How to Do It Safely, Page 64, Publisher: Daedalus Publishing Company 2006, {{ISBN|978-1-881943-12-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is mutual consent that makes a clear legal and ethical distinction between BDSM and such crimes as sexual assault or [[domestic violence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://sexsupport.org/abusevsere.html|title = VICSS / Difference between Abuse and Power Exchange by the NLA, Dutch SM Media Information Center and Powerrotics|accessdate = 10 December 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071216091307/https://sexsupport.org/abusevsere.html| archivedate= 16 December 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some BDSM practitioners prefer a code of behavior that differs from "SSC" and is described as "[[risk-aware consensual kink]]" (RACK), indicating a preference for a style in which the ''individual'' responsibility of the involved parties is emphasized more strongly, with each participant being responsible for his or her own well-being. Advocates of RACK argue that SSC can hamper discussion of risk because no activity is truly "safe", and that discussion of even low-risk possibilities is necessary for truly informed consent. They further argue that setting a discrete line between "safe" and "not-safe" activities ideologically denies consenting adults the right to evaluate risks vs rewards for themselves; that some adults will be drawn to certain activities regardless of the risk; and that BDSM play—particularly higher-risk play or [[edgeplay]]—should be treated with the same regard as extreme sports, with both respect and the demand that practitioners educate themselves and practice the higher-risk activities to decrease risk. RACK may be seen as focusing primarily upon awareness and informed consent, rather than accepted safe practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.withinreality.com/rackssc.html|title = Rack vs. SSC|accessdate = 13 November 2006|year = 2003|website = Within Reality}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consent is the most important criterion here. The consent and compliance for a sadomasochistic situation can be granted only by people who can judge the potential results. For their consent, they must have relevant information (extent to which the scene will go, potential risks, if a safeword will be used, what that is, and so on) at hand and the necessary mental capacity to judge. The resulting consent and understanding is occasionally summarized in a written "[[Contract (BDSM)|contract]]", which is an agreement of what can and cannot take place.&lt;ref&gt;Dossie Easton, Janet W. Hardy: The New Topping Book, Greenery Press (CA) 2002, {{ISBN|978-1-890159-36-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, BDSM play is usually structured such that it is possible for the consenting partner to withdraw his or her consent at any point during a scene;&lt;ref&gt;Dossie Easton, Janet W. Hardy: The New Topping Book. Page 72, Greenery Press (CA) 2002, {{ISBN|978-1-890159-36-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example, by using a [[safeword]] that was agreed on in advance.&lt;ref name=sm101&gt;{{Cite book |authorlink=Jay Wiseman |last=Wiseman |first=Jay |title=SM 101: A Realistic Introduction |publisher=Greenery Press |location=California |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-9639763-8-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dossie Easton, Janet W. Hardy: The New Topping Book. Page 71, Greenery Press (CA) 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Use of the agreed safeword (or occasionally a "safe symbol" such as dropping a ball or ringing a bell, especially when speech is restricted) is seen by some as an explicit withdrawal of consent. Failure to honor a safeword is considered serious misconduct and could even change the sexual consent situation into a crime, depending on the relevant law,&lt;ref name=sm101 /&gt; since the bottom or top has explicitly revoked his or her consent to any actions that follow the use of the safeword (see [[BDSM#Legal status|Legal status]]). For other scenes, particularly in established relationships, a safeword may be agreed to signify a warning ("this is getting too intense") rather than explicit withdrawal of consent; and a few choose not to use a safeword at all.

The initialism ''BDSM'' includes these psychological and physiological facets:
* [[Bondage (BDSM)|Bondage]] and [[Discipline (BDSM)|Discipline]] (''B&amp;D'')
* [[Dominance and submission]] (''D&amp;s'')
** [[Male dominance (BDSM)|Male dominance]]
** [[Male submission]]
** [[Female dominance]]
** [[Female submission]]
* Sadism and Masochism (or [[Sadomasochism]]) (''S&amp;M'')

This model for differentiating among these aspects of BDSM is increasingly used in literature today.&lt;ref name="Terms"/&gt;{{Failed verification|date=November 2015}} Nevertheless, it is only an attempt at phenomenological differentiation. Individual tastes and preferences in the area of [[human sexuality]] may overlap among these areas, which are discussed separately here.

Bondage and discipline are two aspects of BDSM that do not seem to relate to each other because of the type of activities involved, but they have conceptual similarities, and that is why they appear jointly. Contrary to the other two types, B&amp;D does not define the tops and bottoms itself, and is used to describe the general activities with either partner being the receiver and the giver.&lt;ref name="Zakfar, A Professional Dominatrix 2010"&gt;Zakfar, A Professional Dominatrix, 2010, Lulu.com, {{ISBN|978-0-557-64184-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''bondage'' describes the practice of physical restraint. Bondage is usually, but not always, a sexual practice.&lt;ref&gt;Matthias T. J. Grimme: ''Das Bondage-Handbuch. Anleitung zum erotischen Fesseln''. Charon-Verlag, Hamburg 1999, {{ISBN|978-3-931406-16-5}}. (German)&lt;/ref&gt; While bondage is a very popular variation within the larger field of BDSM, it is nevertheless sometimes differentiated from the rest of this field.&lt;ref&gt;Lee "Bridgett" Harrington: Shibari You Can Use: Japanese Rope Bondage and Erotic Macramé, Mystic Productions 2007, {{ISBN|978-0-615-14490-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2015 study of over 1,000 Canadians showed that about half of all men held fantasies of bondage, and almost half of all women did as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Joyal|first=Christian C.|last2=Cossette|first2=Amélie|last3=Lapierre|first3=Vanessa|date=February 2015|title=What Exactly Is an Unusual Sexual Fantasy?|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1743609515309449|journal=The Journal of Sexual Medicine|volume=12|issue=2|pages=328–340|doi=10.1111/jsm.12734|pmid=25359122|issn=1743-6095}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strictly speaking, bondage means binding the partner by tying their appendages together; for example, by the use of handcuffs or ropes, or by lashing their arms to an object. Bondage can also be achieved by spreading the appendages and fastening them with chains or ropes to a [[Saint Andrew's Cross (BDSM)|St. Andrew's cross]] or [[spreader bar]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Jay |last=Wiseman |title=Jay Wiseman's Erotic Bondage Handbook |publisher=Greenery Press |location=CA |year=2000 |isbn=978-1-890159-13-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''discipline'' describes psychological restraining, with the use of rules and punishment to control overt behavior.&lt;ref name="Zakfar, A Professional Dominatrix 2010"/&gt; Punishment can be pain caused physically (such as caning), humiliation caused psychologically (such as a public flagellation) or loss of freedom caused physically (for example, chaining the submissive partner to the foot of a bed). Another aspect is the structured training of the bottom.&lt;ref&gt;Bill Henkin, Sybil Holiday: Consensual Sadomasochism: How to Talk About It and How to Do It Safely, Page 71. Daedalus Publishing Company, 1996, {{ISBN|978-1-881943-12-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

"[[Dominance and submission (BDSM)|Dominance and submission]]" (also known as '''D&amp;s''', '''Ds''' or '''D/s''') is a set of behaviors, customs and rituals relating to the giving and accepting of control of one individual over another in an erotic or lifestyle context. It explores the more mental aspect of BDSM. This is also the case in many relationships not considering themselves as sadomasochistic; it is considered to be a part of BDSM if it is practiced purposefully. The range of its individual characteristics is thereby wide.&lt;ref name=BBC20050922 &gt;{{cite news |title=Face to face: Dominatrix and submissive |date=22 September 2005 |newspaper=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/4271098.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bent forward strappado.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Strappado bondage|Strappado]] with rope and a spreader bar. This practice has a distinct effect of immobilization and pain.]]

Often, "[[Contract (BDSM)|contracts]]" are set out in writing to record the formal consent of the parties to the power exchange, stating their common vision of the relationship dynamic.&lt;ref name="bdsmdict" /&gt; The purpose of this kind of agreement is primarily to encourage discussion and negotiation in advance, and then to document that understanding for the benefit of all parties. Such documents have not been recognized as being legally binding, nor are they intended to be. These agreements are binding in the sense that the parties have the expectation that the negotiated rules will be followed. Often other friends and community members may witness the signing of such a document in a ceremony, and so parties violating their agreement can result in loss of face, respect or status with their friends in the community.

In general, as compared to conventional relationships, BDSM participants go to great lengths to negotiate the important aspects of their relationships in advance, and to take great care in learning about and following safe practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.evilmonk.org/a/wiseman10.cfm |title=Negotiation and Negotiation Forms |last1=Wiseman |first1=Jay |accessdate=26 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In D/S, the dominant is the top and the submissive is the bottom. In S/M, the sadist is usually the top and the masochist the bottom, but these roles are frequently more complicated or jumbled (as in the case of being dominant, masochists who may arrange for their submissive to carry out S/M activities on them). As in B/D, the declaration of the top/bottom may be required,&lt;ref name="Zakfar, A Professional Dominatrix 2010"/&gt; though sadomasochists may also play without any power exchange at all, with both partners equally in control of the play.

=== Etymology ===

The term ''[[sadomasochism]]'' is derived from the words ''sadism'' and ''masochism''. These terms differ somewhat from the same terms used in psychology, since those require that the sadism or masochism cause significant distress or involve non-consenting partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/unique-everybody-else/201307/bdsm-personality-and-mental-health |title=BDSM, Personality and Mental Health |first1=Scott A. |last1=McGreal |publisher=Psychology Today |accessdate=26 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sadomasochism'' refers to the aspects of BDSM surrounding the exchange of physical or emotional pain. Sadism describes sexual pleasure derived by inflicting [[pain]], degradation, humiliation on another person or causing another person to suffer. On the other hand, the masochist enjoys being hurt, humiliated, or suffering within the consensual scenario.&lt;ref name="bdsmdict" /&gt; Sadomasochistic scenes sometimes reach a level that appear more extreme or cruel than other forms of BDSM—for example, when a masochist is brought to tears or is severely bruised—and is occasionally unwelcome at BDSM events or parties.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} Sadomasochism does not imply enjoyment through causing or receiving pain in other situations (for example, accidental injury, medical procedures).{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}

[[File:Sade (van Loo).png|thumb|upright=0.7|left|''Portrait of [[Marquis de Sade]]'' by [[Charles-Amédée-Philippe van Loo]] (1761).]]
The terms ''sadism'' and ''masochism'' are derived from the names of the [[Marquis de Sade]] and [[Leopold von Sacher-Masoch]], based on the content of the authors' works. Although the names of de Sade and Sacher-Masoch are attached to the terms sadism and masochism respectively, the scenes described in de Sade's works do not meet modern BDSM standards of informed consent.&lt;ref&gt;cp: Marquis de Sade: The 120 Days of Sodom, Pbl. ReadHowYouWant, (1 December 2006), {{ISBN|978-1-4250-3448-1}}, pages 407–409 "'You'll have no further use for these,' he muttered, casting each article into a large grate. 'No further need for this mantelet, this dress, these stockings, this bodice, no,' said he when all had been consumed, 'all you'll need now is a coffin.'"&lt;/ref&gt; BDSM is solely based on consensual activities, and based on its system and laws. The concepts presented by de Sade are not in accordance with the BDSM culture, even though they are sadistic in nature.&lt;ref name="Zakfar, A Professional Dominatrix 2010"/&gt;  In 1843 the Ruthenian physician [[Heinrich Kaan]] published ''Psychopathia sexualis'' ("Psychopathy of Sex"), a writing in which he converts the sin conceptions of Christianity into medical diagnoses. With his work the originally theological terms "perversion", "aberration" and "deviation" became part of the scientific terminology for the first time.{{Dubious|date=January 2011}} The German psychiatrist [[Richard Freiherr von Krafft-Ebing|Richard von Krafft Ebing]] introduced the terms "sadism" and "masochism" to the medical community in his work ''Neue Forschungen auf dem Gebiet der Psychopathia sexualis'' ("New research in the area of Psychopathy of Sex") in 1890.&lt;ref&gt;Details describing the development of the theoretical construct "perversion" by Krafft-Ebing and his relation to this terms, see Andrea Beckmann, ''Journal of Criminal Justice and Popular Culture'', 2001; 8(2) 66–95 online at [http://www.albany.edu/scj/jcjpc/vol8is2/beckmann.html Deconstructing Myths]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905, [[Sigmund Freud]] described "sadism" and "masochism" in his ''[[Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality]]'' as diseases developing from an incorrect development of the child psyche and laid the groundwork for the scientific perspective on the subject in the following decades. This led to the first time use of the compound term ''sado-masochism'' (German ''sado-masochismus'') by the Viennese psychoanalytic [[Isidor Isaak Sadger]] in their work, ''Über den sado-masochistischen Komplex'' ("Regarding the sadomasochistic complex") in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;Isidor Isaak Sadger: ''Über den sado-masochistischen Komplex''. in: Jahrbuch für psychoanalytische und psychopathologische Forschungen, Bd. 5, 1913, S. 157–232 (German)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the later 20th century, BDSM activists have protested against these conceptual models, as they were derived from the philosophies of two singular historical figures. Both Freud and Krafft-Ebing were psychiatrists; their observations on sadism and masochism were dependent on psychiatric patients, and their models were built on the assumption of [[psychopathology]].&lt;ref&gt;Krueger &amp; Kaplan 2001, p. 393: "The DSM nomenclature referring to sexual psychopathology has been criticized as being vague and not having undergone DSM field trials." ('''Note:''' "DSM" here is not related to "BDSM". It is the standard abbreviation for the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]''.)&lt;/ref&gt; BDSM activists{{Who|date=November 2014}} argue that it is illogical to attribute human behavioural phenomena as complex as sadism and masochism to the 'inventions' of two historic individuals. Advocates of BDSM{{Who|date=November 2014}} have sought to distinguish themselves from widely held notions of antiquated psychiatric theory by the adoption of the initialized term, "BDSM" as a distinction from the now common usage of those psychological terms, abbreviated as "S&amp;M".{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

== Behavioral and physiological aspects ==

[[File:Le Rêve d'un flagellant by George Topfer.jpg|thumb|upright|BDSM is commonly misconceived to be "all about pain".&lt;ref name="barker13"/&gt;  This 1921 art of a [[clothed male, naked female]] is an illustration of [[Male dominance (BDSM)|male dominance]] and [[female submission]].]]

On a physical level, BDSM is commonly misconceived to be "all about pain".&lt;ref name="barker13"&gt;{{Harvnb|Barker|Iantaffi|Gupta|2007|pp=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most often, though, BDSM practitioners are primarily concerned with power, humiliation, and pleasure.&lt;ref name="barker13"/&gt; Of the three categories of BDSM, only sadomasochism specifically requires pain, but this is typically a means to an end, as a vehicle for feelings of humiliation, dominance, etc. The aspects of D/S and B/D may not include physical suffering at all, but include the sensations experienced by different emotions of the mind.&lt;ref name="barker13"/&gt;

Dominance &amp; submission of power is an entirely different experience, and is not always psychologically associated with physical pain. Many BDSM activities might not involve any kind of pain or humiliation, but just the exchange of power and control.&lt;ref name="Zakfar, A Professional Dominatrix 2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="barker13" /&gt; During the activities, the practitioners may feel [[endorphin]]s comparable to the so-called "runner's high" or to the afterglow of [[orgasm]].&lt;ref&gt;Goldberg, Jeff (1988). Anatomy of a Scientific Discovery. Bantam Books, 1988. {{ISBN|978-0-553-34631-2}}; {{ISBN|978-0-553-17616-2}} (British edition); {{ISBN|978-0-553-05261-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The corresponding [[trance]]-like mental state is also known as "[[Subspace (BDSM)|subspace]]" for the submissive, or "[[topspace]]" for the dominant. Some use the term "body stress" to describe this physiological sensation.&lt;ref&gt;Fries, DS (2002). Opioid Analgesics. In Williams DA, Lemke TL. Foye's Principles of Medicinal Chemistry (5th ed.). Philadelphia: Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins. {{ISBN|978-0-683-30737-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This experience of [[algolagnia]] is important, but is not the only motivation for many BDSM practitioners. The philosopher [[Edmund Burke]] defines this sensation of pleasure derived from pain by the word ''sublime''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=On Taste: On the Sublime and Beautiful; Reflections on the French Revolution; A Letter to a Noble Lord; with Introduction, Notes and Illustrations |first=Edmund |last=Burke |publisher=P. F. Collier &amp; son |year=1909 |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Research has shown that couples engaging in consensual BDSM tend to show hormonal changes that indicate decreases in stress and increases in emotional bonding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sagarin|first=BradJ.|last2=Cutler|first2=Bert|last3=Cutler|first3=Nadine|last4=Lawler-Sagarin|first4=Kimberly A.|last5=Matuszewich|first5=Leslie|date=1 April 2009|title=Hormonal Changes and Couple Bonding in Consensual Sadomasochistic Activity|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|language=English|volume=38|issue=2|pages=186–200|doi=10.1007/s10508-008-9374-5|issn=0004-0002|pmid=18563549}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a wide array of BDSM practitioners who take part in sessions for which they do not receive any personal gratification. They enter such situations solely with the intention to allow their partners to fulfill their own needs or [[Sexual fetishism|fetishes]]. [[Professional dominant]]s do this in exchange of money for the session activities, but non-professionals do it for the sake of their partners.&lt;ref name="Zakfar, A Professional Dominatrix 2010" /&gt;

In some BDSM sessions, the top exposes the bottom to a wide range of sensual experiences, for example: pinching, biting, scratching with fingernails, [[erotic spanking]] or the use of objects such as [[Crop (implement)|crops]], [[whip]]s, liquid [[wax]], [[ice cube]]s, [[Wartenberg wheel]]s, and [[erotic electrostimulation]] devices.&lt;ref&gt;William Brame, Gloria Brame: Different Loving: The World of Sexual Dominance and Submission (Paperback), Villard, 1996, {{ISBN|978-0-679-76956-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fixation by [[handcuffs]], [[rope]]s or [[chain]]s may be used as well. The repertoire of possible "toys" is limited only by the imagination of both partners. To some extent, everyday items like [[Clothespin|clothes-pins]], [[wooden spoon]]s or [[plastic wrap]] are used as pervertables.&lt;ref&gt;Claudia Varrin: The Art Of Sensual Female Dominance: A Guide for Women, Citadel, 2000, {{ISBN|978-0-8065-2089-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is commonly considered that a pleasurable BDSM experience during a session is very strongly dependent upon the top's competence and experience and the bottom's physical and mental state at the time of the session. Trust and [[sexual arousal]] help the partners enter a shared mindset.&lt;ref&gt;John Warren, PhD: The Loving Dominant, Greenery Press (CA), 2nd Rev Ed, {{ISBN|978-1-890159-20-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bill Henkin, Sybil Holiday: Consensual Sadomasochism : How to Talk About It and How to Do It Safely, Daedalus Publishing Company 1996, {{ISBN|978-1-881943-12-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Safety ===
{{See also|Risk-aware consensual kink}}
Aside from the general advice related to [[safe sex]], BDSM sessions often require a wider array of safety precautions than [[vanilla sex]] (sexual behaviour without BDSM elements).&lt;ref name=sm101 /&gt; In theory, to ensure consent related to BDSM activity, pre-play [[Negotiation (BDSM)|negotiations]] are commonplace, especially among partners who do not know each other very well. In practice, pick-up scenes at clubs or parties may sometimes be low in negotiation (much as pick-up sex from singles bars may not involve much negotiation or disclosure). These negotiations concern the interests and fantasies of each partner and establish a framework of both acceptable and unacceptable activities.&lt;ref&gt;David Stein: ''S/M's Copernican Revolution:From a Closed World to the Infinite Universe'' and ''Safe Sane Consensual: The Evolution of a Shibboleth'' available at [https://archive.is/20141004110503/http://www.alternativechannel.tv/?p=66 s/m-leather history]&lt;/ref&gt; This kind of discussion is a typical "unique selling proposition" of BDSM sessions and quite commonplace.&lt;ref&gt;Bill Henkin, Sybil Holiday: Consensual Sadomasochism : How to Talk About It and How to Do It Safely, pages 80–94, Daedalus Publishing Company 1996, {{ISBN|978-1-881943-12-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[safeword]]s are often arranged to provide for an immediate stop of any activity if any participant should so desire.&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Cameron, Don Kulick: Language and Sexuality, Page 24, Cambridge University Press 2003, {{ISBN|978-0-521-00969-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Safewords are words or phrases that are called out when things are either not going as planned or have crossed a threshold one cannot handle. They are something both parties can remember and recognize and are, by definition, not words commonly used playfully during any kind of scene. Words such as ''no'', ''stop'', and ''don't'', are often inappropriate as a safeword if the roleplaying aspect includes the illusion of non-consent. The most commonly used safewords are ''red'' and ''yellow'', with ''red'' meaning that play must stop immediately, and ''yellow'' meaning that the activity needs to slow down.&lt;ref&gt;Tristan Taormino (Editor): The Ultimate Guide to Kink: BDSM, Role Play and the Erotic Edge, page 26, Cleis Press 2012, {{ISBN|978-1573447799}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At most clubs and group-organized BDSM parties and events, [[Dungeon Monitor|dungeon monitors]] (DMs) provide an additional safety net for the people playing there, ensuring that house rules are followed and safewords respected.

BDSM participants are expected to understand practical safety aspects. For instance, they are expected to recognize that parts of the body can be damaged, such as nerves and blood vessels by [[contusion]], or that skin that can be scarred. Using crops, whips, or [[Cat of nine tails|floggers]], the top's fine motor skills and anatomical knowledge can make the difference between a satisfying session for the bottom and a highly unpleasant experience that may even entail severe physical harm.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph W. Bean: Flogging, Greenery Press (CA), 2000, {{ISBN|978-1-890159-27-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The very broad range of [[Sex toy|BDSM "toys"]] and physical and psychological control techniques often requires a far-reaching knowledge of details related to the requirements of the individual session, such as [[anatomy]], [[physics]], and [[psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;Jack Rinella: The Toybag Guide Series, Greenery Press (CA), e.g. The Toybag Guide to Hot Wax and Temperature Play, {{ISBN|978-1-890159-57-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arne Hoffmann, ''Das Lexikon des Sadomasochismus. Der Inside-Führer zur dunklen Erotik: Praktiken und Instrumente, Personen und Institutionen, Literatur und Film, Politik und Philosophie'', Page 42, Schwarzkopf &amp; Schwarzkopf 2000, {{ISBN|978-3-89602-290-5}} (German)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Phillip Miller, Molly Devon, William A. Granzig: ''Screw the Roses, Send Me the Thorns: The Romance and Sexual Sorcery of Sadomasochism'', pp. 95, Mystic Rose Books 1995, {{ISBN|978-0-9645960-0-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these risks, BDSM activities usually result in far less severe injuries than sports like boxing and football, and BDSM practitioners do not visit emergency rooms any more often than the general population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barker|Iantaffi|Gupta|2007|pp=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is necessary to be able to identify each person's psychological "[[wikt:squick|squicks]]" or triggers in advance to avoid them. Such losses of emotional balance due to sensory or emotional overload are a fairly commonly discussed issue. It is important to follow participants' reactions [[Empathy|empathetically]] and continue or stop accordingly.&lt;ref name=sm101 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dossie Easton, Janet W. Hardy: The New Topping Book. Page 111&lt;/ref&gt; For some players, sparking "freakouts" or deliberately using triggers may be a desired outcome. Safewords are one way for BDSM practices to protect both parties. However, partners should be aware of each other's psychological states and behaviors to prevent instances where the "freakouts" prevent the use of safewords.

At one end of the spectrum are those who are indifferent to, or even reject physical stimulation. At the other end of the spectrum are bottoms who enjoy discipline and [[erotic humiliation]] but are not willing to be subordinate to the person who applies it. The bottom is frequently the partner who specifies the basic conditions of the session and gives instructions, directly or indirectly, in the negotiation, while the top often respects this guidance. Other bottoms often called "brats" try to incur punishment from their tops by provoking them or "misbehaving". Nevertheless, a purist "school" exists within the BDSM community, which regards such "topping from the bottom" as rude or even incompatible with the standards of BDSM relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.submissiveguide.com/2009/01/5-ways-to-recognize-topping-from-the-bottom/|title=5 Ways to Recognize Topping from the Bottom|author=lunaKM|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141010090227/http://www.submissiveguide.com/2009/01/5-ways-to-recognize-topping-from-the-bottom/|archivedate=10 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Types of relationships ===
;Play

BDSM practitioners sometimes regard the practice of BDSM in their sex life as [[sexual roleplaying|roleplaying]] and so often use the terms "play" and "playing" to describe activities where in their roles. Play of this sort for a specified period of time is often called a "session", and the contents and the circumstances of play are often referred to as the "scene". It is also common in personal relationships to use the term "kink play" for BDSM activities, or more specific terms for the type of activity. The relationships can be of varied types.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Makai|first1=Michael|title=Domination &amp; Submission: The BDSM Relationship Handbook|date=September 2013|publisher=Createspace|isbn=978-1492775973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Long term
Early writings on BDSM both by the academic and BDSM community spoke little of long-term relationships with some in the gay leather community suggesting short-term play relationships to be the only feasible relationship models, and recommending people to get married and "play" with BDSM outside of marriage. In recent times though writers of BDSM and sites for BDSM have been more focused on long-term relationships.

A 2003 study, the first to look at these relationships, fully demonstrated that "quality long-term functioning relationships" exist among practitioners of BDSM, with either sex being the top or bottom (homosexual couples were not looked at).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cutler|2003|pp=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; Respondents in the study expressed their BDSM orientation to be built into who they are, but considered exploring their BDSM interests an ongoing task, and showed flexibility and adaptability in order to match their interests with their partners.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;{{Harvnb|Cutler|2003|pp=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "perfect match" where both in the relationship shared the same tastes and desires was rare, and most relationships required both partners to take up or put away some of their desires.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; The BDSM activities that the couples partook in varied in sexual to nonsexual significance for the partners who reported doing certain BDSM activities for "couple bonding, stress release, and spiritual quests".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cutler|2003|pp=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most reported issue amongst respondents was not finding enough time to be in role with most adopting a lifestyle wherein both partners maintain their dominant or submissive role throughout the day.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{Harvnb|Cutler|2003|pp=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amongst the respondents, it was typically the bottoms who wanted to play harder, and be more restricted into their roles when there was a difference in desire to play in the relationship.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{Harvnb|Cutler|2003|pp=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author of the study, Bert Cutler, speculated that tops may be less often in the mood to play due to the increased demand for responsibility on their part: being aware of the safety of the situation and prepared to remove the bottom from a dangerous scenario, being conscious of the desires and limits of the bottom, and so on.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; The author of the study stressed that successful long-term BDSM relationships came after "early and thorough disclosure" from both parties of their BDSM interests.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

Many of those engaged in long-term BDSM relationships learned their skills from larger BDSM organizations and communities&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cutler|2003|pp=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a lot of discussion by the respondents on the amount of control the top possessed in the relationships with almost non-existent discussion of the top "being better, or smarter, or of more value" than the bottom.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{Harvnb|Cutler|2003|pp=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Couples were generally of the same mind of whether or not they were in an ongoing relationship, but in such cases the bottom was not locked up constantly, but that their role in the context of the relationship was always present, even when the top was doing non-dominant activities such as household chores, or the bottom being in a more dominant position.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; In its conclusion the study states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The respondents valued themselves, their partners, and their relationships. All couples expressed considerable goodwill toward their partners. The power exchange between the cohorts appears to be serving purposes beyond any sexual satisfaction, including experiencing a sense of being taken care of and bonding with a partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cutler|2003|pp=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The study further goes on to list three aspects that made the successful relationships work: early disclosure of interests and continued transparency, a commitment to personal growth, and the use of the dominant/submissive roles as a tool to maintain the relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cutler|2003|pp=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his closing remarks, the author of the study theorizes that due to the serious potential for harm, couples in BDSM relationships develop increased communication that may be higher than in mainstream relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cutler|2003|pp=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Professional services
A professional [[dominatrix]] or [[professional dominant]], often referred to within the culture as a "pro-dom(me)", offers services encompassing the range of bondage, discipline, and dominance in exchange for money. The term "dominatrix" is little-used within the non-professional BDSM scene. A non-professional dominant woman is more commonly referred to simply as a "domme", "dominant", or "[[femdom]]" (short for female dominance). There are also services provided by professional female submissives ("pro-subs"). A professional submissive consents to her client's dominant behavior within negotiated limits, and often works within a professional [[dungeon (BDSM)|dungeon]]. [[Professional submissive]]s, although far more rare, do exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.professionalsubmissives.com/|title=Directory of Professional Submssives|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the people who work as subs normally have tendencies towards such activities, especially when sadomasochism is involved.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Males also work as professional "tops" in BDSM, and are called "masters" or "doms". However it is much more rare to find a male in this profession. A male "pro-dom" typically only works with male clientele.&lt;ref name="Zakfar, A Professional Dominatrix 2010"/&gt;

=== Scenes ===
In BDSM, a ''scene'' is the stage or setting where BDSM activity takes place, as well as the activity itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=BDSM Glossary |url=https://www.xeromag.com/fvbdglossary.html |website=Xeromag |accessdate=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.domsub.info/glossary.shtml |title=What is D/s |accessdate=2012-01-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204120709/http://www.domsub.info/glossary.shtml |archivedate=4 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }} Dom Sub Glossary&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ober |first1=Lauren |title=Kink 101 |url=https://www.sevendaysvt.com/vermont/kink-101/Content?oid=2139583 |website=Seven Days |accessdate=5 October 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mistresssky.com/terms.html |title=DEFINITIONS OF BDSM TERMS |accessdate=29 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224221722/http://www.mistresssky.com/terms.html |archivedate=24 February 2012 |df= }} Mistress Sky terms&lt;/ref&gt; The physical place where a BDSM activity takes place is usually called a [[Dungeon (BDSM)|dungeon]], though some prefer less dramatic terms, including "playspace", or "club". A BDSM activity can, but need not, involve [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]] or [[sexual roleplay]]. A characteristic of many [[BDSM relationship]]s is the [[Power exchange (BDSM)|power exchange]] from the bottom to the dominant partner, and bondage features prominently in BDSM scenes and sexual roleplay.

'The Scene' (including use of the definite article 'the') is also used in the BDSM community to refer to the BDSM community as a whole. Thus someone who is on 'the Scene', and prepared to play in public, might take part in 'a scene' at a public [[Play party (BDSM)|play party]].&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book|ref = harv|last = Aggrawal|first = Anil|year = 2008|title = Forensic and Medico-Legal Aspects of Sexual Crimes and Unusual Sexual Practices|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=uNkNhPZQprcC|publisher  = CRC Press|isbn = 978-1-4200-4308-2|accessdate = 5 July 2010}} P.147-148, 154, 172, 174&lt;/ref&gt;

A scene can take place in private between two or more people, and can involve a domestic arrangement, such as [[servitude (BDSM)|servitude]] or a casual or committed lifestyle [[Master/slave (BDSM)|master/slave relationship]]. BDSM elements may involve settings of [[Master/slave (BDSM)#Slave training|slave training]] or punishment for breaches of instructions.

A scene can also take place in a club, where the [[Play (BDSM)|play]] can be viewed by others. When a scene takes place in a public setting, it may be because the participants enjoy being watched by others, or because of the [[bondage equipment|equipment]] available, or because having third parties present adds safety for play partners who have only recently met.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.novad.org/Primer/Definitions.html |title=Definition of Terms |accessdate=2012-01-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120101092731/http://www.novad.org/Primer/Definitions.html |archivedate=1 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }} Novad Primer Definitions&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Etiquette ===
Standard social etiquette rules still apply when at a BDSM event, such as not intimately touching someone you do not know, not touching someone else's belongings (including toys), and abiding by dress codes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dominantguide.com/325/basics-of-dungeon-etiquette/ |title=Basics of Dungeon Etiquette|date=29 April 2013|author=Rev|website=Dominant Guide|accessdate=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many events open to the public also have rules addressing alcohol consumption, recreational drugs, cell phones, and photography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rascal's Club Rules|url=http://www.rascals-club.com/rules.html|website=Rascal's Club|accessdate=25 May 2018|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A specific scene takes place within the general conventions and [[etiquette]] of BDSM, such as requirements for mutual [[Consent (BDSM)|consent]] and agreement as to the [[Limits (BDSM)|limits]] of any BDSM activity. This agreement can be incorporated into a [[Contract (BDSM)|formal contract]]. In addition, most clubs have additional rules which regulate how onlookers may interact with the actual participants in a scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kinkyplayspace.com/club-etiquette/ |title=General Club Etiquette for ANY Fetish Play Club |publisher=kinkyplayspace}}&lt;/ref&gt; As is the general rule in BDSM, these are founded on the catchphrase "safe, sane, and consensual".

=== Parties and clubs ===
BDSM [[Play party (BDSM)|play parties]] are events in which BDSM practitioners and other similarly interested people meet in order to communicate, share experiences and knowledge, and to "play" in an erotic atmosphere. The parties show similarities with ones in the [[dark culture]], being based on a more or less strictly enforced [[dress code]]; most often clothing made of latex, leather or vinyl/PVC, lycra and so on., emphasizing the body's shape and the primary and secondary sexual characteristic. The requirement for such dress codes differ. While some events have none, others have a policy in order to create a more coherent atmosphere and to prevent onlookers from taking part.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.datenschlag.org/txt/smpabes.html datenschlag.org] (German)&lt;/ref&gt;

At these parties, BDSM can be publicly performed on a stage, or more privately in separate "dungeons".&lt;ref&gt;Dossie Easton, Janet W. Hardy: ''The New Topping Book''. Page 163&lt;/ref&gt; A reason for the relatively fast spread of this kind of event is the opportunity to use a wide range of "playing equipment", which in most apartments or houses is unavailable. Slings, St. Andrew's crosses (or similar restraining constructs), spanking benches, and punishing supports or cages are often made available. The problem of noise disturbance is also lessened at these events, while in the home setting many BDSM activities can be limited by this factor. In addition, such parties offer both [[Exhibitionism|exhibitionists]] and [[Voyeurism|voyeurs]] a forum to indulge their inclinations without social criticism. Sexual intercourse is not permitted within most public BDSM play spaces or not often seen in others, because it is not the emphasis of this kind of play. In order to ensure the maximum safety and comfort for the participants certain standards of behavior have evolved; these include aspects of [[courtesy]], [[privacy]], respect and safewords.&lt;ref name=sm101 /&gt; Today BDSM parties are taking place in most of the larger cities in the Western world.

This scene appears particularly on the Internet, in publications, and in meetings such as at [[fetish club]]s (like [[Torture Garden (fetish club)|Torture Garden]]), SM parties, gatherings called [[Munch (BDSM)|munches]], and erotic fairs like [[Venus Berlin]]. The annual [[Folsom Street Fair]] is the world's largest BDSM event and is held in San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://folsomstreetfair.org/|title=Folsom Street Fair|accessdate=11 December 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071215163221/http://folsomstreetfair.org/| archivedate= 15 December 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has its roots in the gay leather movement. The weekend long festivities include a wide range of sadomasochistic erotica in a public clothing optional space between 8th and 13th streets with nightly parties associated with the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Folsom-Street-Fair-attracts-whippers-usual-5771032.php|title=Fantasy becomes reality at Folsom Street Fair|accessdate=13 February 2017|date=2014-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also conventions such as [[National Leather Association International|Living in Leather]] and [[Black Rose (BDSM organization)|Black Rose]].

== Psychology ==
It has often been assumed that a preference for BDSM is a consequence of childhood abuse. Research indicates that there is no evidence for this claim.&lt;ref name="a2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Demographic and Psychosocial Features of Participants in Bondage and Discipline, "Sadomasochism" or Dominance and Submission (BDSM): Data from a National Survey |url=http://www.niu.edu/user/tj0bjs1/bdsm/Richters,%20de%20Visser,%20Rissel,%20Grulich,%20&amp;%20Smith%20(2008).pdf |journal=The Journal of Sexual Medicine |date=1 July 2008 |issn=1743-6109 |pages=1660–1668 |volume=5 |issue=7 |doi=10.1111/j.1743-6109.2008.00795.x |first=Juliet |last=Richters |first2=Richard O. |last2=De Visser |first3=Chris E. |last3=Rissel |first4=Andrew E. |last4=Grulich |first5=Anthony M.A. |last5=Smith |pmid=18331257 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161020021649/http://www.niu.edu/user/tj0bjs1/bdsm/Richters%2C%20de%20Visser%2C%20Rissel%2C%20Grulich%2C%20%26%20Smith%20%282008%29.pdf |archivedate=20 October 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some reports suggest that people abused as children may have more BDSM injuries and have difficulty with safe words being recognized as meaning stop the previously consensual behavior,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jozifkova|first=Eva|date=11 August 2013|title=Consensual Sadomasochistic Sex (BDSM): The Roots, the Risks, and the Distinctions Between BDSM and Violence|journal=Current Psychiatry Reports|language=en|volume=15|issue=9|pages=392|doi=10.1007/s11920-013-0392-1|pmid=23933978|issn=1523-3812}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus, it is possible that people choosing BDSM as part of their lifestyle, who also were previously abused, may have had more police or hospital reports of injuries. There is also a link between transgender individuals who have been abused and violence occurring in BDSM activities&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cook-Daniels|first=Loree|last2=Munson|first2=Michael|date=5 May 2010|title=Sexual Violence, Elder Abuse, and Sexuality of Transgender Adults, Age 50+: Results of Three Surveys|journal=Journal of GLBT Family Studies|volume=6|issue=2|pages=142–177|doi=10.1080/15504281003705238|issn=1550-428X|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of reasons commonly given for why a sadomasochist finds the practice of S&amp;M enjoyable, and the answer is largely dependent on the individual. For some, taking on a role of compliance or helplessness offers a form of therapeutic escape; from the stresses of life, from responsibility, or from guilt. For others, being under the power of a strong, controlling presence may evoke the feelings of safety and protection associated with childhood. They likewise may derive satisfaction from earning the approval of that figure ''(see: [[Servitude (BDSM)]])''. A sadist, on the other hand, may enjoy the feeling of power and authority that comes from playing the dominant role, or receive pleasure vicariously through the suffering of the masochist. It is poorly understood, though, what ultimately connects these emotional experiences to sexual gratification, or how that connection initially forms.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}
Joseph Merlino, author and psychiatry adviser to the ''[[New York Daily News]]'', said in an interview that a sadomasochistic relationship, as long as it is consensual, is not a psychological problem:
{{quote|It's a problem only if it is getting that individual into difficulties, if he or she is not happy with it, or it's causing problems in their personal or professional lives. If it's not, I'm not seeing that as a problem. But assuming that it did, what I would wonder about is what is his or her biology that would cause a tendency toward a problem, and dynamically, what were the experiences this individual had that led him or her toward one of the ends of the spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;[[n:Dr. Joseph Merlino on sexuality, insanity, Freud, fetishes and apathy#Gender identity and Heteronormativity|Interview with Dr. Joseph Merlino]], David Shankbone, ''[[Wikinews]]'', October 5, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
It is agreed on by some psychologists that experiences during early [[Psychosexual development|sexual development]] can have a profound effect on the character of sexuality later in life. Sadomasochistic desires, however, seem to form at a variety of ages. Some individuals report having had them before puberty, while others do not discover them until well into adulthood. According to one study, the majority of male sadomasochists (53%) developed their interest before the age of 15, while the majority of females (78%) developed their interest afterwards (Breslow, Evans, and Langley 1985). The prevalence of sadomasochism within the general population is unknown. Despite female sadists being less visible than males, some surveys have resulted in comparable amounts of sadistic fantasies between females and males.&lt;ref name="Fedoroff640"&gt;{{harvnb|Fedoroff|2008|p=640}}: "...surveys have found no difference in frequency of sadistic fantasies in men and women."&lt;/ref&gt; The results of such studies demonstrate that one's sex does not determine preference for sadism.&lt;ref name="Fedoroff644"&gt;{{harvnb|Fedoroff|2008|p=644}}: "This review indicates that sexual sadism, as currently defined, is a heterogeneous phenomenon."&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a phenomenological study of nine individuals involved in sexual masochistic sessions who regarded pain as central to their experience,&lt;ref&gt;Kurt, H., &amp; Ronel, N. (in print). Addicted to Pain. International Journal of Offender Therapy and Comparative Criminology.&lt;/ref&gt; sexual masochism was described as an addiction-like tendency, with several features resembling that of drug addiction: craving, intoxication, tolerance and withdrawal. It was also demonstrated how the first masochistic experience is placed on a pedestal, with subsequent use aiming at retrieving this lost sensation, much as described in the descriptive literature on addiction. The addictive pattern presented in this study suggests an association with [[behavioral spin]] as found in problem gamblers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bensimon | first1 = M. | last2 = Baruch | first2 = A. | last3 = Ronel | first3 = N. | year = 2013 | title = The experience of gambling in an illegal casino: The gambling spin process | url = | journal = European Journal of Criminology | volume = 10 | issue = 1| pages = 3–21 | doi=10.1177/1477370812455124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A non-representative survey on the sexual behaviour of American students published in 1997 and based on questionnaires had a response rate of about 8–9%. Its results showed 15% of homosexual and bisexual males, 21% of lesbian and female bisexual students, 11% of heterosexual males and 9% of female heterosexual students committed to BDSM related fantasies.&lt;ref name="elliott" /&gt; In all groups the level of practical BDSM experiences were around 6%. Within the group of openly lesbian and bisexual females the quote was significantly higher, at 21%. Independent of their sexual orientation, about 12% of all questioned students, 16% of lesbians and female bisexuals and 8% of heterosexual males articulated an interest in spanking. Experience with this sexual behaviour was indicated by 30% of male heterosexuals, 33% of female bisexuals and lesbians, and 24% of the male gay and bisexual men and female heterosexual women.&lt;ref name="elliott" /&gt; Even though this study was not considered representative, other surveys indicate similar dimensions in a differing target groups.&lt;ref&gt;Brokmann, Angela: ''Macht und Erotik'', 1996, Sexologisches Institut e.

A representative study done from 2001 to 2002 in Australia found that 1.8% of sexually active people (2.2% men, 1.3% women but no significant sex difference) had engaged in BDSM activity in the previous year. Of the entire sample, 1.8% men and 1.3% women had been involved in BDSM. BDSM activity was significantly more likely among bisexuals and homosexuals of both sexes. But among men in general, there was no relationship effect of age, education, language spoken at home, or relationship status. Among women, in this study, activity was most common for those between 16 and 19 years of age and least likely for females over 50 years. Activity was also significantly more likely for women who had a regular partner they did not live with, but was not significantly related with speaking a language other than English or education.&lt;ref name="a2" /&gt;

Another representative study, published in 1999 by the German Institut für rationale Psychologie, found that about 2/3 of the interviewed women stated a desire to be at the mercy of their sexual partners from time to time. 69% admitted to fantasies dealing with sexual submissiveness, 42% stated interest in explicit BDSM techniques, 25% in bondage.&lt;ref&gt;Arne Hoffmann, ''Lexikon der Tabubrüche'', Schwarzkopf&amp;Schwarzkopf, 2003, {{ISBN|978-3-89602-517-3}} (German)&lt;/ref&gt; A 1976 study in the general US population suggests three percent have had positive experiences with Bondage or master-slave roleplaying.

[http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/resources/FAQ.html#bdsm kinseyinstitute.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Some elements of BDSM have been popularized through increased media coverage since the middle 1990s. Thus both black leather clothing, sexual jewellery such as chains and dominance roleplay appear increasingly outside of BDSM contexts.

According to yet another survey of 317,000 people in 41 countries, about 20% of the surveyed have at least used masks, blindfolds or other bondage utilities once, and 5% explicitly connected themselves with BDSM.&lt;ref name="Durex"&gt;Durex Global Sex Survey 2005, P.15 Online [http://www.durex.com/cm/gss2005results.asp Durex Global Sex Survey 2005]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090315002702/http://www.durex.com/cm/gss2005results.asp |date=15 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, 19% mentioned spanking as one of their practices and 22% confirmed the use of blindfolds or handcuffs.&lt;ref name="Durex"/&gt;

=== Medical categorization ===
{{see also|Sexual sadism disorder|Sexual masochism disorder}}
Reflecting changes in [[social norm]]s, modern medical opinion is now moving away from regarding BDSM activities as medical disorders, unless they are nonconsensual or involve significant distress or harm.

==== DSM ====
In the past, the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM), the [[American Psychiatric Association]]'s manual, defined some BDSM activities as sexual disorders.&lt;ref name=Gerson2015&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/01/bdsm-versus-the-dsm/384138/|title=BDSM Versus the DSM|last=Gerson|first=Merissa Nathan|date=2015-01-13|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2018-07-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following campaigns from advocacy organizations including the [[National Coalition for Sexual Freedom]],&lt;ref name=Gerson2015/&gt; the current version of the DSM, [[DSM-5]], excludes consensual BDSM from diagnosis when the sexual interests cause no harm or distress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dsm5.org/Documents/Paraphilic%20Disorders%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf |title=Paraphilic Disorders |last= |first= |date=2013 |website=dsm5.org |publisher=American Psychiatric Association |access-date=26 August 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160724010712/https://www.dsm5.org/Documents/Paraphilic%20Disorders%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf |archivedate=24 July 2016 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ICD ====
The [[World Health Organization]]'s [[International Classification of Diseases]] (ICD) has made similar moves in recent years.

Section F65 of the current revision, [[ICD-10]], indicates that "mild degrees of sadomasochistic stimulation are commonly used to enhance otherwise normal sexual activity". The diagnostic guidelines for the ICD-10 state that this class of diagnosis should only be made "if sadomasochistic activity is the most important source of stimulation or necessary for sexual gratification".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The ICD-10 Classification of Mental and Behavioural Disorders: Clinical descriptions and diagnostic guidelines | chapter = Sadomasochism, F65.5 | page = 172 | chapter-url = http://www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/bluebook.pdf | accessdate= 8 March 2014 | publisher = World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, an organization called [[ReviseF65]] has worked to remove sadomasochism from the ICD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Reiersøl O, Skeid S |title=The ICD diagnoses of fetishism and sadomasochism |journal=Journal of Homosexuality |volume=50 |issue=2–3 |pages=243–62 |year=2006 |pmid=16803767 |doi=10.1300/J082v50n02_12 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, Denmark became the first [[European Union]] country to have completely removed sadomasochism from its national classification of diseases. This was followed by Sweden in 2009, Norway in 2010 and Finland 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.revisef65.org/Sweden.html|title=Fetish and SM diagnoses deleted in Sweden|publisher=ReviseF65|date=17 November 2008|accessdate=4 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.revisef65.org/friskmelding_eng.html|title=SM and fetish off the Norwegian sick list|publisher=[[ReviseF65]]|date=6 February 2010|accessdate=4 March 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100206222549/http://www.revisef65.org/friskmelding_eng.html| archivedate= 6 February 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.revisef65.org/finland_eng.html|title=Finland joins Nordic sexual reform|publisher=[[ReviseF65]]|date=13 May 2011|accessdate=7 June 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110621034733/http://www.revisef65.org/finland_eng.html|archive-date=21 June 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent surveys on the spread of BDSM fantasies and practices show strong variations in the range of their results.&lt;ref name="Fakten"&gt;{{cite web |title=Nackte Fakten – Statistik für Zahlenfetischisten |language=German |accessdate=9 November 2008 |url=http://www.datenschlag.org/txt/statistik.html | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081208192334/http://www.datenschlag.org/txt/statistik.html| archivedate= 8 December 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, researchers assume that 5 to 25 percent of the population practices sexual behavior related to pain or dominance and submission. The population with related fantasies is believed to be even larger.&lt;ref name="Fakten"/&gt;

The ICD is in the process of revision, and recent drafts have reflected these changes in social norms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Giami|first=Alain|date=2 May 2015|title=Between DSM and ICD: Paraphilias and the Transformation of Sexual Norms|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|language=en|volume=44|issue=5|pages=1127–1138|doi=10.1007/s10508-015-0549-6|issn=0004-0002|url=http://cesp-2016.vjf.inserm.fr/wp-content/uploads/productions/6_Giami_Arch-Sex-Behav_2015.pdf|pmid=25933671}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2018|07}}, the final advance preview of the [[ICD-11]] has de-pathologised most things listed in ICD-10 section F65, characterizing as pathological only those activities which are either coercive, or involving significant risk of injury or death, or distressing to the individual committing them, and specifically excluding consensual sexual sadism and masochism from being regarded as pathological.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://icd.who.int/browse11/l-m/en#/http://id.who.int/icd/entity/2110604642|title=ICD-11 - Mortality and Morbidity Statistics - Paraphilic disorders|website=icd.who.int|language=en|access-date=2018-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://icd.who.int/browse11/l-m/en#/http://id.who.int/icd/entity/1890228613|title=ICD-11 - Mortality and Morbidity Statistics - 6D33 Coercive sexual sadism disorder|website=icd.who.int|language=en|access-date=2018-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://revisef65.net/2018/05/27/bdsm-fetishism-sadomasochism-global-milestone-human-rights-reform|title=WHO takes bdsm and fetishism off the sick list|website=revisef65.net|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final advance text is to be officially presented to the members of the WHO in 2019, ready to come into effect in 2022.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.who.int/news-room/detail/18-06-2018-who-releases-new-international-classification-of-diseases-(icd-11)|title=WHO releases new International Classification of Diseases (ICD 11)|work=World Health Organization|access-date=2018-07-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All these symbols are indicative of her [[sexual roleplay|roleplaying]] a BDSM pet [[Sexual slavery (BDSM)|slave]].]]

Some people who feel attracted by the situations usually compiled under the term BDSM reach a point where they decide to [[come out of the closet]], though many sadomasochists keep themselves [[closet(ed)|closeted]]. Even so, depending upon a survey's participants, about 5 to 25 percent of the US population show affinity to the subject.&lt;ref name="elliott"&gt;Elliott, Leland / Brantley, Cynthia, ''Sex on Campus'', 1997, Random House, New York&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Janus, Samuel S. / Janus, Cynthia L., 1994 ''The Janus Report on Sexual Behavior'', Wiley, New York, {{ISBN|978-0-471-01614-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other than a few artists and writers,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|first=Jillian|last=Keenan|title=Finding the Courage to Reveal a Fetish|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/11/fashion/modern-love-a-spanking-fetish-is-not-revealed-easily.html|journal=The New York Times|date=9 November 2012|accessdate=13 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; practically no celebrities are publicly known as sadomasochists.

Public knowledge of one's BDSM lifestyle can have devastating vocational and social effects for sadomasochists. Many face severe professional consequences&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Jillian |last=Keenan|title=Can You Really Be Fired for Being Kinky? Absolutely |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/outward/2014/10/28/the_jian_ghomeshi_case_echoes_many_kinksters_worst_fears_being_outed_and.html |journal=Slate|date=28 October 2014|accessdate=13 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[social rejection]] if they are exposed, either voluntarily or involuntarily, as sadomasochists.

Within feminist circles the discussion has been split roughly into two camps: some who see BDSM as an aspect or reflection of oppression (for example, [[Alice Schwarzer]]) and, on the other side, pro-BDSM feminists, often grouped under the banner of [[sex-positive feminism]] (see [[Samois]]); both of them can be traced back to the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Alice Schwarzer: "Weiblicher Masochismus ist Kollaboration!" from EMMA Heft 2, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

Some feminists have criticized BDSM for eroticizing power and violence, and for reinforcing [[misogyny]]. They argue that women who engage in BDSM are making a choice that is ultimately bad for women.&lt;ref&gt;Alice Schwarzer, Emma Heft 2, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist defenders of BDSM argue that consensual BDSM activities are enjoyed by many women and validate the sexual inclinations of these women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bdsmreport.org/bdsm-and-feminism-an-insiders-view/ BDSM and Feminism: An Insider's View by Tammy Jo Eckhart] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150529111714/http://bdsmreport.org/bdsm-and-feminism-an-insiders-view/ |date=29 May 2015 }}, May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that there is no connection between consensual kinky activities and sex crimes, and that feminists should not attack other women's sexual desires as being "anti-feminist". They also state that the main point of feminism is to give an individual woman free choices in her life; which includes her sexual desire. While some feminists suggest connections between consensual BDSM [[Scene (BDSM)|scenes]] and non-consensual rape and [[sexual assault]], other sex-positive ones find the notion insulting to women.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gayle Rubin]]: ''Thinking Sex: Notes for a Radical Theory of the Politics of Sexuality''. In Carole S. Vance (Ed.), ''Pleasure and Danger: exploring female sexuality'', pp. 267–319. Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, Boston 1984. {{ISBN|978-0-04-440867-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Wendy McElroy]]: ''A Woman's Right to Pornography''. Saint Martin's Press 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-312-15245-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is often mentioned that in BDSM, roles are not fixed to [[gender]], but personal preferences. The dominant partner in a heterosexual relationship may be the woman rather than the man; or BDSM may be part of male/male or female/female sexual relationships. Finally, some people [[Switch (BDSM)|switch]], taking either a dominant or submissive role on different occasions. Several studies investigating the possibility of correlation between BDSM pornography and the violence against women also indicate a lack of correlation. As an example, Japan is listed as the country with the lowest sexual crime rate out of all the industrialized nations, despite being known for its distinct BDSM and [[bondage pornography]] (see [[Pornography in Japan]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Diamond |first1=Milton |last2=Uchiyama |first2=Ayako |title=Pornography, Rape and Sex Crimes in Japan |journal=International Journal of Law and Psychiatry |url=http://www.hawaii.edu/PCSS/biblio/articles/1961to1999/1999-pornography-rape-sex-crimes-japan.html |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=1–22 |year=1999 |doi=10.1016/S0160-2527(98)00035-1 |author1link=Milton Diamond |pmid=10086287 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991 a lateral survey came to the conclusion that between 1964 and 1984, despite the increase in amount and availability of sadomasochistic pornography in the US, Germany, Denmark and Sweden there is no correlation with the national number of rapes to be found.&lt;ref&gt;[[Berl Kutchinsky]], ''Pornography and Rape: Theory and Practice?'' in: International Journal of Law and Psychiatry, Vol. 14, 1991, P. 47–66&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Operation Spanner]] in the UK proves that BDSM practitioners still run the risk of being [[Social stigma|stigmatized]] as criminals. In 2003, the media coverage of [[Jack McGeorge]] showed that simply participating and working in BDSM support groups poses risks to one's job, even in countries where no law restricts it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Pleasure, Pain, and Saddam Hussein |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2074821/ |periodical=[[Slate.com]] |first1=Timothy |last1=Noah |date=3 December 2002 |accessdate=9 November 2008 |postscript= | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081123071440/http://www.slate.com/id/2074821/| archivedate= 23 November 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here a clear difference can be seen to the situation of homosexuality.{{Clarify|date=January 2015}} The psychological strain appearing in some individual cases is normally neither articulated nor acknowledged in public. Nevertheless, it leads to a difficult psychological situation in which the person concerned can be exposed to high levels of emotional stress.&lt;ref name="moser"&gt;[[Charles Allen Moser|Charles Moser]], in ''Journal of Social Work and Human Sexuality'' 1988, (7;1, S.43–56)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the stages of "self awareness", he or she realizes their desires related to BDSM scenarios or decides to be open for such. Some authors call this ''internal coming-out''. Two separate surveys on this topic independently came to the conclusion that 58 percent and 67 percent of the sample respectively, had realized their disposition before their 19th birthday. Other surveys on this topic show comparable results.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andreas Spengler|Spengler, Andreas]]: ''Sadomasochisten und ihre Subkulturen'', Campus Verlag, 1979, Frankfurt am Main / New York (German)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.datenschlag.org/umfrage/dpb1_ergebnisse.html|title=Datenschlag Peinliche Befragung I - Alte Fragen neu gestellt Ergebnisse|first=|last=|date=|website=Datenschlag survey|language=de|accessdate=28 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Independent of age, coming-out can potentially result in a difficult life crisis, sometimes leading to thoughts or acts of suicide. While homosexuals have created support networks in the last decades, sadomasochistic support networks are just starting to develop in most countries. In German speaking countries they are only moderately more developed.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Daschek und Axel Konrad: ''Empirische Untersuchung über den Zusammenhang zwischen ausgewählten Faktoren und inklinierendem sexuellem Sadomasochismus'', online [http://www.schlagabtausch-hd.de/sm-studie.php sm-study] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071122135714/http://www.schlagabtausch-hd.de/sm-studie.php |date=22 November 2007 }} (German)&lt;/ref&gt; The Internet is the prime contact point for support groups today, allowing for local and international networking. In the US [[National Coalition for Sexual Freedom#Kink Aware Professionals|Kink Aware Professionals]] (KAP) a privately funded, non-profit service provides the community with referrals to psychotherapeutic, medical, and legal professionals who are knowledgeable about and sensitive to the BDSM, fetish, and leather community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncsfreedom.org/kap/index.php?option=com_keyword&amp;id=270|title=ncsfreedom.org|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611150428/http://www.ncsfreedom.org/kap/index.php?option=com_keyword&amp;id=270|archivedate=11 June 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the US and the UK, the [[Woodhull Freedom Foundation &amp; Federation]], [[National Coalition for Sexual Freedom]] (NCSF) and [[Sexual Freedom Coalition]] (SFC) have emerged to represent the interests of sadomasochists. The German [[Bundesvereinigung Sadomasochismus]] is committed to the same aim of providing information and driving press relations. In 1996 the website and mailing list [[Datenschlag]] went online in German and English providing the largest [[bibliography]], as well as one of the most extensive historical collections of sources related to BDSM.

=== Social (non-medical) research ===
Richters et al. (2008) study also found that people who engaged in BDSM were more likely to have experienced a wider range of sexual practices (e.g. [[Oral sex|oral]] or [[anal sex]], more than one partner, [[group sex]], [[phone sex]], viewed [[pornography]], used a [[sex toy]], [[fisting]], [[Anilingus|rimming]], etc.). They were, however, not any more likely to have been coerced, unhappy,  anxious, or experiencing [[Sexual dysfunction|sexual difficulties]]. On the contrary, men who had engaged in BDSM scored lower on a psychological distress scale than men who did not.&lt;ref name="a2" /&gt;

There have been few studies on the psychological aspects of BDSM using modern scientific standards. Psychotherapist [[Charles Allen Moser|Charles Moser]] has said there is no evidence for the theory that BDSM has common symptoms or any common psychopathology, emphasizing that there is no evidence that BDSM practitioners have any special psychiatric other problems based on their sexual preferences.&lt;ref name="moser" /&gt;

Problems do sometimes occur in the area of self classification by the person concerned. During the phase of the "coming-out", self-questioning related to one's own "normality" is quite common. According to Moser, the discovery of BDSM preferences ''can'' result in fear of the current non-BDSM relationship's destruction. This, combined with the fear of discrimination in everyday life, leads in some cases to a double life which can be highly burdensome. At the same time, the denial of BDSM preferences can induce stress and dissatisfaction with one's own "vanilla"-lifestyle, feeding the apprehension of finding no partner. Moser states that BDSM practitioners having problems finding BDSM partners would probably have problems in finding a non-BDSM partner as well. The wish to remove BDSM preferences is another possible reason for psychological problems since it is not possible in most cases. Finally, the scientist states that BDSM practitioners seldom commit violent crimes. From his point of view, crimes of BDSM practitioners usually have no connection with the BDSM components existing in their life. Moser's study comes to the conclusion that there is no scientific evidence, which could give reason to refuse members of this group work- or safety certificates, adoption possibilities, custody or other social rights or privileges. The Swiss psychoanalyst Fritz Morgenthaler shares a similar perspective in his book, ''Homosexuality, Heterosexuality, Perversion'' (1988). He states that possible problems result not necessarily from the non-normative behavior, but in most cases primarily from the real or feared reactions of the social environment towards their own preferences.&lt;ref&gt;Fritz Morgenthaler: ''Homosexuality, Heterosexuality, Perversion'', Analytic, April 1988, {{ISBN|978-0-88163-060-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1940 psychoanalyst [[Theodor Reik]] reached implicitly the same conclusion in his standard work ''[[Aus Leiden Freuden. Masochismus und Gesellschaft]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Theodor Reik: ''Aus Leiden Freuden. Masochismus und Gesellschaft'', Fischer, 1983, {{ISBN|978-3-596-26768-2}} (German)&lt;/ref&gt;

Moser's results are further supported by a 2008 Australian study by Richters ''et al.'' on the demographic and psychosocial features of BDSM participants. The study found that BDSM practitioners were no more likely to have experienced sexual assault than the control group, and were not more likely to feel unhappy or anxious. The BDSM males reported higher levels of psychological well-being than the controls. It was concluded that "BDSM is simply a sexual interest or subculture attractive to a minority, not a pathological symptom of past abuse or difficulty with 'normal' sex."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Richters | first1 = J. | last2 = De Visser | first2 = R.

=== Gender differences in research ===
{{See also|Feminist views on BDSM}}
Several recent studies have been conducted on the gender differences and personality traits of BDSM practitioners. Wismeijer &amp; van Assen (2013) found that "the association of BDSM role and gender was strong and significant" with only 8% of women in the study being dominant compared to 75% being submissive.;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wismeijer | first1 = Andreas | last2 = van Assen | first2 = Marcel | year = 2013 | title = Psychological Characteristics of BDSM Practitioners | journal = The Journal of Sexual Medicine | volume = 10 | issue = 8| pages = 1943–1952 | doi = 10.1111/jsm.12192 | pmid = 23679066 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hébert &amp; Weaver (2014) found that 9% of women in their study were dominant compared to 88% submissive;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 =  Hébert | first1 = Ali | last2 = Weaver | first2 = Angela | year = 2014 | title = An examination of personality characteristics associated with BDSM orientations | journal =  The Canadian Journal of Human Sexuality | volume = 24 | issue = 1| pages = 49–62 | doi = 10.3138/cjhs.2467 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Weierstall1 &amp; Giebel (2017) likewise found a significant difference, with 19% of women in the study as dominant compared to 74% as submissive. They concluded that "men more often display an engagement in dominant practices, whereas females take on the submissive part. This result is inline with a recent study about mate preferences that has shown that women have a generally higher preference for a dominant partner than men do (Giebel, Moran, Schawohl, &amp; Weierstall, 2015). Women also prefer dominant men, and even men who are aggressive, for a short-term relationship and for the purpose of sexual intercourse (Giebel, Weierstall, Schauer, &amp; Elbert, 2013)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Weierstall | first1 = Roland | last2 =  Giebel | first2 = Gilda | year = 2017 | title = The Sadomasochism Checklist: A Tool for the Assessment of Sadomasochistic Behavior | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume = 46 | issue = 3| pages = 735–745 | doi = 10.1007/s10508-016-0789-0 | pmid = 27488306 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, studies on sexual fantasy differences between men and women show the latter prefer submissive and passive fantasies over dominant and active ones, with rape and force being common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wilson | first1 = Glenn | year = 2010 | title = The Sex Fantasy Questionnaire: An update | journal = Sexual and Relationship Therapy | volume = 25 | issue = 1| pages = 68–72 | doi = 10.1080/14681990903505799 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Gender differences in masochistic scripts ====
[[File:Female whipping two women.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A whipping scene where both dominant and submissives are female, Paris, 1930]]

One common belief of BDSM and kink is that women are more likely to take on masochistic roles than men. [[Roy Baumeister]] (2010) actually had more male masochists in his study than female, and fewer male dominants than female. The lack of statistical significance in these gender differences suggests that no assumptions should be made regarding gender and masochistic roles in BDSM. One explanation why we might think otherwise lies in our social and cultural ideals about [[femininity]]; masochism may emphasize certain stereotypically feminine elements through activities like [[Feminization (activity)|feminization]] of men and ultra-feminine clothing for women. But such tendencies of the submissive masochistic role should not be interpreted as a connection between it and the stereotypical female role—many masochistic scripts do not include any of these tendencies.&lt;ref name="a4" &gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baumeister | first1 = R. F. | year = 1988 | title = Gender differences in masochistic scripts | url = | journal = Journal of Sex Research | volume = 25 | issue = 4| pages = 478–499 | doi=10.1080/00224498809551477}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baumeister found that masochistic males experienced greater: severity of pain, frequency of humiliation (status-loss, degrading, oral), partner infidelity, active participation by other persons, and [[Cross-dressing|cross dressing]]. Trends also suggested that male masochism included more bondage and oral sex than female (though the data was not significant). Female masochists, on the other hand, experienced greater: frequency in pain, pain as punishment for 'misdeeds' in the relationship context, display humiliation, genital intercourse, and presence of non-participating audiences. The exclusiveness of dominant males in a heterosexual relationship happens because, historically, men in power preferred multiple partners. Finally, Baumeister observes a contrast between the 'intense sensation' focus of male masochism to a more 'meaning and emotion' centred female masochistic script.&lt;ref name="a4" /&gt;

Prior argues that although some of these women may appear to be engaging in traditional subordinate or submissive roles, BDSM allows women in both dominant and submissive roles to express and experience personal power through their sexual identities. In a study that she conducted in 2013, she found that the majority of the women she interviewed identified as bottom, [[Female submission|submissive]], captive, or slave/[[sexual slavery (BDSM)|sex slave]]. In turn, Prior was able to answer whether or not these women found an incongruity between their sexual identities and feminist identity. Her research found that these women saw little to no incongruity, and in fact felt that their feminist identity supported identities of submissive and slave. For them these are sexually and emotionally fulfilling roles and identities that, in some cases, feed other aspects of their lives. Prior contends that third wave feminism provides a space for women in BDSM communities to express their sexual identities fully, even when those identities seem counter-intuitive to the ideals of feminism. Furthermore, women who do identify as submissive, sexually or otherwise, find a space within BDSM where they can fully express themselves as integrated, well-balanced, and powerful women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Prior|first1=Emily|title=Women's Perspectives of BDSM Power Exchange|journal=Electronic Journal of Human Sexuality|date=2013|volume=16|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA365455101&amp;v=2.1&amp;u=txshracd2598&amp;it=r&amp;p=AONE&amp;sw=w&amp;asid=c799ed9c2682c1c57c56ec8c16af7e4d|accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Women in S/M culture ====

Levitt, Moser, &amp; Jamison's 1994 study provides a general, if outdated, description of characteristics of women in the sadomasochistic (S/M) subculture. They state that women in S/M tend to have higher education, become more aware of their desires as a young adult, are less likely to be married than the general population. The researchers found the majority of females identified as heterosexual and submissive, a substantial minority were versatile—able to switch between dominant and submissive roles—and a smaller minority identified with the dominant role exclusively. Oral sex, bondage and master-slave script were among the most popular activities, while feces/watersports were the least popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Levitt | first1 = E.

=== Orientation observances in research ===

BDSM is not a sexual orientation or identity, but it is considered one by some of its practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;Jillian Keenan, [http://www.slate.com/blogs/outward/2014/08/18/is_kink_a_sexual_orientation.html], ''Slate'', 18 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The BDSM and kink scene is more often seen as a diverse pansexual community. Often this is a non-judgmental community where gender, sexuality, orientation, preferences are accepted as is or worked at to become something a person can be happy with.&lt;ref&gt;Weiss, M. D. (2006). Working at play: BDSM sexuality in the San Francisco Bay area. Anthropologica, 229-245.&lt;/ref&gt; In research, studies have focused on bisexuality and its parallels with BDSM, as well as gay-straight differences between practitioners.

==== Differences and similarities between gay and straight men in S/M ====
[[File:Rubberist Male Top.JPG|thumb|upright=0.7|A [[gay]] male [[Top, bottom, switch (BDSM)#top|top]] cross-dressing in [[latex clothing]]]]

Demographically, Nordling et al.'s (2006) study found no differences in age, but 43% of gay male respondents compared to 29% of straight males had university level education. The gay men also had higher incomes than the general population, and tended to work in white collar jobs while straight men tended toward blue collar ones. Because there were not enough female respondents (22), no conclusions could be drawn from them.

Sexually speaking, the same 2006 study by Nordling et al. found that gay males were aware of their S/M preferences and took part in them at an earlier age, preferring [[Leather subculture|leather]], [[anal sex]], [[rimming]], [[dildo]]s and special equipment or uniform scenes. In contrast, straight men preferred verbal humiliation, mask and blindfolds, [[Gag (BDSM)|gags]], [[Latex and PVC fetishism|rubber/latex]] outfits, [[caning]], [[vaginal sex]], and [[cross-dressing]] among other activities. From the questionnaire, researchers were able to identify four separate sexual themes: [[Hypermasculinity|hyper-masculinity]], giving and receiving pain, physical restriction (i.e. bondage), and psychological humiliation. Gay men preferred activities that tended towards hyper-masculinity while straight men showed greater preference for humiliation. Though there were not enough female respondents to draw a similar conclusion with, the fact that there is a difference in gay and straight men suggests strongly that S/M (and BDSM in general) can not be considered a homogenous phenomenon. As Nordling et al. (2006) puts it, "People who identify as sadomasochists mean different things by these identifications." (54)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nordling | first1 = N. | last2 = Sandnabba | first2 = N. K. | last3 = Santtila | first3 = P. | last4 = Alison | first4 = L. | year = 2006 | title = Differences and similarities between gay and straight individuals involved in the sadomasochistic subculture | url = | journal = Journal of Homosexuality | volume = 50 | issue = 2–3| pages = 41–57 | doi=10.1300/j082v50n02_03| pmid = 16803758 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Bisexuality ====

In Steve Lenius' original 2001 paper he explored the acceptance of [[bisexuality]] in a supposedly [[Pansexuality|pansexual]] BDSM community. The reasoning behind this is that 'coming-out' had become primarily the territory of the gay and lesbian, with bisexuals feeling the push to be one or the other (and being right only half the time either way). What he found in 2001, was that people in BDSM were open to discussion about the topic of bisexuality and pansexuality and all controversies they bring to the table, but personal biases and issues stood in the way of actively using such labels. A decade later, Lenius (2011) looks back on his study and considers if anything has changed. He concluded that the standing of bisexuals in the BDSM and kink community was unchanged, and believed that positive shifts in attitude were moderated by society's changing views towards different sexualities and orientations. But Lenius (2011) does emphasize that the pansexual promoting BDSM community helped advance greater acceptance of alternative sexualities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lenius | first1 = S | year = 2001 | title = Bisexuals and BDSM | url = | journal = [[Journal of Bisexuality]] | volume = 1 | issue = 4| pages = 69–78 | doi=10.1300/j159v01n04_06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lenius | first1 = S | year = 2011 | title = A Reflection on "Bisexuals and BDSM: Bisexual People in a Pansexual Community"—Ten Years Later (and a Preview of the Next Sexual Revolution) | url = | journal = [[Journal of Bisexuality]] | volume = 11 | issue = 4| pages = 420–425 | doi=10.1080/15299716.2011.620466}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brandy Lin Simula (2012), on the other hand, argues that BDSM actively resists gender conforming and identified three different types of BDSM bisexuality: [[Genderqueer|gender-switching]], gender-based styles (taking on a different gendered style depending on gender of partner when playing), and rejection of gender (resisting the idea that gender matters in their play partners). Simula (2012) explains that practitioners of BDSM routinely challenge our concepts of sexuality by pushing the limits on pre-existing ideas of sexual orientation and gender norms. For some, BDSM and kink provides a platform in creating identities that are fluid, ever-changing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Simula | first1 = B. L. | year = 2012 | title = Does Bisexuality 'Undo' Gender?

=== History of psychotherapy and current recommendations ===
Psychiatry has an insensitive history in the area of BDSM. There have been many involvements by institutions of political power to marginalize subgroups and sexual minorities.&lt;ref name="a3" /&gt; Mental health professionals have a long history of holding negative assumptions and stereotypes about the BDSM community. Beginning with the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM]]-II, Sexual Sadism and Sexual Masochism have been listed as sexually deviant behaviours. Sadism and masochism were also found in the personality disorder section.&lt;ref&gt;American Psychiatric Association. (1968). Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (2nd ed.). Washington, DC: American Psychiatric Association.&lt;/ref&gt; This negative assumption has not changed significantly which is evident in the continued inclusion of Sexual Sadism and Sexual Masochism as [[paraphilia]]s in the [[DSM-IV-TR]].&lt;ref&gt;American Psychiatric Association. (2000). Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (4th ed. rev.). Washington, DC: American Psychiatric Association.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[DSM-5|DSM-V]], however, has depathologized the language around [[paraphilia]]s in a way that signifies "the APA's intent to not demand treatment for healthy consenting adult sexual expression".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ncsfreedom.org/press/blog/item/the-dsm-5-says-kink-is-ok.html|title=NCSF Blog|last=Admin|first=Blog|website=ncsfreedom.org|access-date=5 April 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160422123917/https://ncsfreedom.org/press/blog/item/the-dsm-5-says-kink-is-ok.html|archivedate=22 April 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; These biases and misinformation can result in pathologizing and unintentional harm to clients who identify as sadists and/or masochists and medical professionals who have been trained under older editions of the DSM can be slow to change in their ways of clinical practice.

According to Kolmes et al. (2006), major themes of biased and inadequate care to BDSM clients are:

* Considering BDSM to be unhealthy
* Requiring a client to give up BDSM activities in order to continue in treatment
* Confusing BDSM with abuse
* Having to educate the therapist about BDSM
* Assuming that BDSM interests are indicative of past family/spousal abuse
* Therapists misrepresenting their expertise by stating that they are BDSM-positive when they are not actually knowledgeable about BDSM practices

These same researchers suggested that therapists should be open to learning more about BDSM, to show comfort in talking about BDSM issues, and to understand and promote "safe, sane, consensual" BDSM.&lt;ref name="a3" /&gt;

There has also been research which suggests BDSM can be a beneficial way for victims of sexual assault to deal with their trauma, most notably by Corie Hammers, but this work is limited in scope and to date, has not undergone empirical testing as a treatment.

=== History of behavioral treatment ===
{{original research section|date=August 2016}}
Both terms were introduced to the medical field by German [[psychiatrist]] [[Richard von Krafft-Ebing]] in his 1886 compilation of case studies ''Psychopathia Sexualis''. Pain and physical violence are not essential in Krafft-Ebing's conception, and he defined "masochism" (German ''masochismus'') entirely in terms of control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last = von Krafft-Ebing |first = Richard |authorlink = Richard von Krafft-Ebing | title = Psychopathia Sexualis |year = 1886 | chapter-url = https://archive.org/details/psychopathiasexu00krafuoft |publisher = |page = 131 |chapter = Masochis |quote = [The masochist] is controlled by the idea of being completely and unconditionally subject to the will of a person of the opposite sex; of being treated by this person as by a master, humiliated and abused. This idea is coloured by lustful feeling; the masochist lives in fancies, in which he creates situations of this kind and often attempts to realise them}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sigmund Freud]], a psychoanalyst and a contemporary of Krafft-Ebing, noted that both were often found in the same individuals, and combined the two into a single dichotomous entity known as "sadomasochism" (German ''sadomasochismus'', often abbreviated as ''S&amp;M'' or ''S/M''). This observation is commonly verified in both literature and practice; many sadists and masochists{{Who|date=November 2014}} define themselves as "[[switch (BDSM)|switchable]]"—capable of taking pleasure in either role. However it has also been argued (Deleuze, ''Coldness and Cruelty'') that the concurrence of sadism and masochism in Freud's model should not be taken for granted.

Freud introduced the terms "primary" and "secondary" masochism. Though this idea has come under a number of interpretations, in a primary masochism the masochist undergoes a complete, not just a partial, rejection by the model or courted object (or sadist), possibly involving the model taking a rival as a preferred mate. This complete rejection is related to the death drive (''todestrieb'') in Freud's psychoanalysis. In a secondary masochism, by contrast, the masochist experiences a less serious, more feigned rejection and punishment by the model. Secondary masochism, in other words, is the relatively casual version, more akin to a charade, and most commentators are quick to point out its contrivedness.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

Rejection is not desired by a primary masochist in quite the same sense as the feigned rejection occurring within a mutually consensual relationship—or even where the masochist happens to be the one having actual initiative power (this is the confusion of the distinctions of casual appearance and discrete motives which underlies the analyses of [[Deleuze]] and [[Sartre]], for example).{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}{{Original research inline|date=November 2014}} In ''[[Things Hidden Since the Foundation of the World]]'', [[René Girard]] attempts to resuscitate and reinterpret Freud's distinction of primary and secondary masochism, in connection with his own philosophy.

Both Krafft-Ebing and Freud assumed that sadism in men resulted from the distortion of the aggressive component of the male sexual instinct. Masochism in men, however, was seen as a more significant aberration, contrary to the nature of male sexuality. Freud doubted that masochism in men was ever a primary tendency, and speculated that it may exist only as a transformation of sadism. Sadomasochism in women received comparatively little discussion, as it was believed that it occurred primarily in men. Both also assumed that masochism was so inherent to female sexuality that it would be difficult to distinguish as a separate inclination.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

[[Havelock Ellis]], in ''Studies in the Psychology of Sex'', argued that there is no clear distinction between the aspects of sadism and masochism, and that they may be regarded as complementary emotional states. He also made the important point that sadomasochism is concerned only with pain in regard to sexual pleasure, and not in regard to cruelty, as Freud had suggested. In other words, the sadomasochist generally desires that the pain be inflicted or received in love, not in abuse, for the pleasure of either one or both participants. This mutual pleasure may even be essential for the satisfaction of those involved.

Here, Ellis touches upon the often paradoxical nature of widely reported consensual S&amp;M practices. It is described as not simply pain to initiate pleasure, but violence—"or the simulation of involuntary violent acts"—said to express love. This irony is highly evident in the observation by many, that not only are popularly practiced sadomasochistic activities usually performed at the express request of the masochist, but that it is often the designated masochist who may direct such activities, through subtle emotional cues perceived or mutually understood and consensually recognized by the designated sadist.

In his essay ''Coldness and Cruelty'', (originally ''Présentation de Sacher-Masoch'', 1967) [[Gilles Deleuze]] rejects the term "sadomasochism" as artificial, especially in the context of the quintessentially modern masochistic work, Sacher-Masoch's ''Venus In Furs''. Deleuze's counterargument is that the tendency toward masochism is based on intensified desire brought on or enhanced by the acting out of frustration at the delay of gratification. Taken to its extreme, an intolerably indefinite delay is 'rewarded' by punitive perpetual delay, manifested as unwavering coldness. The masochist derives pleasure from, as Deleuze puts it, the "Contract": the process by which he can control another individual and turn the individual into someone cold and callous. The sadist, in contrast, derives pleasure from the "Law": the unavoidable power that places one person below another. The sadist attempts to destroy the [[Id, ego, and super-ego#Ego|ego]] in an effort to unify the [[Id, ego, and super-ego#Id|id]] and [[Id, ego, and super-ego#Super-ego|super-ego]], in effect gratifying the most base desires the sadist can express while ignoring or completely suppressing the will of the ego, or of the conscience. Thus, Deleuze attempts to argue that masochism and sadism arise from such different impulses that the combination of the two terms is meaningless and misleading. A masochist's perception of their own self-subjugating sadistic desires and capacities are treated by Deleuze as reactions to prior experience of sadistic objectification. (E.g. in terms of psychology, compulsively defensive appeasement of pathological guilt feelings as opposed to the volition of a strong free will.) The epilogue of ''Venus In Furs'' shows the character of Severin has become embittered by his experiment in the alleged control of masochism, and advocates instead the domination of women.{{Original research inline|date=November 2014}}

Before Deleuze, however, [[Sartre]] had presented his own theory of sadism and masochism, at which Deleuze's deconstructive argument, which took away the symmetry of the two roles, was probably directed. Because the pleasure or power in looking at the victim figures prominently in sadism and masochism, Sartre was able to link these phenomena to his famous philosophy of the "Look of the Other". Sartre argued that masochism is an attempt by the "For-itself" (consciousness) to reduce itself to nothing, becoming an object that is drowned out by the "abyss of the Other's subjectivity".&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Paul Sartre, ''[[Being and Nothingness]]''&lt;/ref&gt; By this Sartre means that, given that for the "for-itself" desire to attain a point of view in which it is both subject and object, one possible strategy is to gather and intensify every feeling and posture in which the self appears as an object to be rejected, tested, and humiliated; and in this way the for-itself strives toward a point of view in which there is only one subjectivity in the relationship, which would be both that of the abuser and the abused. Conversely, Sartre held sadism to be the effort to annihilate the subjectivity of the victim. That means that the sadist is exhilarated by the emotional distress of the victim because they seek a subjectivity that views the victim as both subject and object.

This argument may appear stronger if it is understood that this "look of the other" theory is either only an aspect of the faculties of desire, or somehow its primary faculty. This does not account for the turn that Deleuze took for his own theory of these matters, but the premise of "desire as 'look'" is associated with theoretical distinctions always detracted by Deleuze, in what he regarded as its essential error to recognize "desire as lack"—which he identified in the philosophical temperament of Plato, Socrates, and [[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]]. For Deleuze, insofar as desire is a lack it is reducible to the "look".{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

Finally, after Deleuze, [[René Girard]] included his account of sado-masochism in ''Things Hidden Since the Foundation of The World'', originally ''Des choses cachées depuis la fondation du monde'', 1978, making the chapter on masochism a coherent part of his theory of [[mimetic desire]]. In this view of sado-masochism, the violence of the practices are an expression of a peripheral rivalry that has developed around the actual love-object. There is clearly a similarity to Deleuze, since both in the violence surrounding the memory of mimetic crisis and its avoidance, and in the resistance to affection that is focused on by Deleuze, there is an understanding of the value of the love object in terms of the processes of its valuation, acquisition and the test it imposes on the suitor.{{Original research inline|date=November 2014}}

=== Clinical issues ===
Nichols (2006) compiled some common clinical issues: countertransference, non-disclosure, coming-out, partner/families, and bleed-through.&lt;ref name="a1" &gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nichols | first1 = M | year = 2006 | title = Psychotherapeutic issues with "kinky" clients: Clinical problems, yours and theirs | url = | journal = Journal of Homosexuality | volume = 50 | issue = 2–3| pages = 281–300 | doi=10.1300/j082v50n02_14| pmid = 16803768 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Countertransference]] is a common problem in clinical settings. Despite having no evidence, therapists may find themselves believing that their client's pathology is "self-evident". Therapists may feel intense disgust and aversive reactions. Feelings of countertransference can interfere with therapy. Another common problem is when clients conceal their sexual preferences from their therapists. This can compromise any therapy. To avoid non-disclosure, therapists are encouraged to communicate their openness in indirect ways with literatures and artworks in the waiting room. Therapists can also deliberately bring up BDSM topics during the course of therapy. With less informed therapists, sometimes they over-focus on clients' sexuality which detracts from original issues such as family relationships, depression, etc. A special subgroup that needs counselling is the "newbie". Individuals just coming out might have internalized shame, fear, and self-hatred about their sexual preferences. Therapists need to provide acceptance, care, and model positive attitude; providing reassurance, [[psychoeducation]], and [[bibliotherapy]] for these clients is crucial. The average age when BDSM individuals realize their sexual preference is around 26 years.&lt;ref name="a3" /&gt; Many people hide their sexuality until they can no longer contain their desires. However, they may have married or had children by this point. Therefore, therapists need to facilitate couple's counselling and disclosure. It is important for therapists to consider fairness to partner and family of clients. In situations when boundaries between roles in the bedroom and roles in the rest of the relationship blurs, a "bleed-through" problem has occurred. Therapists need to help clients resolve distress and deal with any underlying problems that led to the initial bleed-through.{{Original research inline|date=December 2014}}

Practices of BDSM survive from some of the oldest textual records in the world, associated with rituals to the Goddess [[Inanna]] ([[Ishtar]] in [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]). [[Cuneiform script|Cuneiform]] texts dedicated to Inanna which incorporate domination rituals. In particular she points to ancient writings such as Inanna and Ebih (in which the Goddess dominates Ebih), and Hymn to Inanna describing cross-dressing transformations and rituals "imbued with pain and ecstasy, bringing about initation{{sic|?}} and journeys of altered states of consciousness; punishment, moaning, ecstasy, lament and song, participants exhausting themselves in weeping and grief."&lt;ref&gt;Nomis, Anne O.

During the ninth century BC, [[Flagellation#Association with religion|ritual flagellations]] were performed in [[Artemis Orthia]], one of the most important religious areas of ancient [[Sparta]], where the [[Cult of Orthia]], a pre[[Olympic Gods|olympic]] religion, was practiced. Here ritual flagellation called ''diamastigosis'' took place, in which young adolescent men were whipped in a ceremony overseen by the priestess.&lt;ref&gt;Nomis, Anne O. (2013) "The Ancient Dominatrix Goddess and her Priestess Initiates" in "The History &amp; Arts of the Dominatrix" Mary Egan Publishing and Anna Nomis Ltd, pp.61-62&lt;/ref&gt; These are referred to by a number of ancient authors, including [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanius]] (III, 16: 10-11).&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias III, 16: 10-11 viewable at: http://www.theoi.com/Text/Pausanias3B.html#16&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the oldest graphical proofs of sadomasochistic activities is found in the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] [[Tomb of the Whipping]] near [[Tarquinia]], which dates to the fifth century BC. Inside the tomb there is [[fresco]] which portrays two men who flagellate a woman with a cane and a hand during an erotic situation.&lt;ref&gt;Mario Moretti/Leonard von Matt: Etruskische Malerei in Tarquinia. Cologne 1974, Page 90, figs. 762-63, {{ISBN|978-3-7701-0541-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another reference related to flagellation is to be found in the sixth book of the ''Satires'' of the ancient Roman Poet [[Juvenal]] (1st–2nd century A.D.),&lt;ref&gt;[[Juvenal]]: [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/juvenal-satvi.html Satires 6, Lines 474–511]&lt;/ref&gt; further reference can be found in [[Petronius]]'s ''[[Satyricon]]'' where a delinquent is whipped for sexual arousal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/petronius.html Petronius: Satyricon] (lat.)&lt;/ref&gt; Anecdotal narratives related to humans who have had themselves voluntary bound, flagellated or whipped as a substitute for sex or as part of foreplay reach back to the third and fourth century.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

In Pompeii, a whip-mistress figure with wings is depicted on the wall of the [[Villa of the Mysteries|Villa of Mysteries]], as part of an initiation of a young woman into the [[Mystery religion|Mysteries]]. The whip-mistress role drove the sacred initiation of ceremonial death and rebirth.&lt;ref name="Nomis, Anne O. 2013 pp.62-64"&gt;Nomis, Anne O.

The ''[[Kama Sutra]]'' of India describes four different kinds of hitting during lovemaking, the allowed regions of the human body to target and different kinds of joyful "cries of pain" practiced by bottoms. The collection of historic texts related to sensuous experiences explicitly emphasizes that [[impact play]], biting and pinching during sexual activities should only be performed consensually since only some women consider such behavior to be joyful. From this perspective the Kama Sutra can be considered as one of the first written resources dealing with sadomasochistic activities and safety rules. Further texts with sadomasochistic connotation appear worldwide during the following centuries on a regular basis.&lt;ref&gt;Kamasutra by Mallanaga Vatsyayana, translated by Wendy Doniger, Oxford University Press 2003, {{ISBN|978-0-19-283982-4}} Book II: Chapters 4,5,7,8, Pages 45–64.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are anecdotal reports of people willingly being bound or whipped, as a prelude to or substitute for sex, during the 14th century. The medieval phenomenon of [[courtly love]] in all of its slavish devotion and ambivalence has been suggested by some writers to be a precursor of BDSM.&lt;ref&gt;Denis de Rougemont (1956), Love in the Western World: Describing the ideal of chast love influenced by the [[Cathar]] doctrines&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arne Hoffmann: ''In Leder gebunden.

[[Charles Guyette]] was the first American to produce and distribute fetish related material (costumes, footwear, photography, props and accessories) in the US. His successor, [[Irving Klaw]], produced commercial sexploitation film and photography with a BDSM theme (most notably with [[Bettie Page]]) and issued fetish comics (known then as "chapter serials") by the now-iconic artists [[John Willie]], [[Gene Bilbrew]], and [[Eric Stanton]].

Stanton's model [[Bettie Page]] became at the same time one of the first successful models in the area of fetish photography and one of the most famous [[pin-up girl]]s of American mainstream culture. Italian author and designer [[Guido Crepax]] was deeply influenced by him, coining the style and development of European adult comics in the second half of the twentieth century. The artists [[Helmut Newton]] and [[Robert Mapplethorpe]] are the most prominent examples of the increasing use of BDSM-related motives in modern photography and the public discussions still resulting from this.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20021112205909/http://www.uce.ac.uk/mapplethorpe/ University of Central England in Birmingham]: Attempted Confiscation of Mapplethorn book by Officials in 1997 for being obscene.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alfred Binet]] first coined the term ''[[erotic fetishism]]'' in his 1887 book, ''Du fétichisme dans l’amour''&lt;ref&gt;Binet, A. (1887). "Du fétichisme dans l’amour" [=Fetishism in love] in: Revue Philosophique, 24, pp. 143–167&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard von Krafft-Ebing]] saw BDSM interests as the end of a continuum.&lt;ref&gt;von Krafft-Ebing R.

=== Leather movement ===
{{Main|Leather subculture}}
[[File:Leather Contingent Pride 2004.jpg|thumb|Start of the Leather contingent at the 2004 San Francisco [[gay pride]] [[pride parade|parade]].]]
Leather has been a predominantly gay male term to refer to one [[sexual fetishism|fetish]], but it can stand for many more. Members of the gay male leather community may wear leathers such as Motorcycle leathers, or may be attracted to men wearing leather. Leather and BDSM are seen as two parts of one whole. Much of the BDSM culture can be traced back to the gay male [[leather subculture|leather culture]], which formalized itself out of the group of men who were soldiers returning home after World War II (1939–1945).&lt;ref&gt;Robert Bienvenu, ''The Development of Sadomasochism as a Cultural Style in the Twentieth-Century United States'', 2003, Doctoral Dissertation, Online as PDF on [http://www.americanfetish.net/ Sadomasochism as a Cultural Style]&lt;/ref&gt; WWII was the setting where countless homosexual men and women tasted the life among homosexual peers. Post-war, homosexual individuals congregated in larger cities such as New York, Chicago, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. They formed leather clubs and bike clubs, some were fraternal services. The establishment of Mr. Leather Contest and Mr. Drummer Contest were made around this time. This was the genesis of the gay male leather community. Many of the members were attracted to extreme forms of sexuality, for which peak expression was in the pre-AIDS 1970s.&lt;ref name="a4b" &gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lenius | first1 = S | year = 2001 | title = Bisexuals and BDSM | url = | journal = Journal of Bisexuality | volume = 1 | issue = 4| pages = 69–78 | doi=10.1300/j159v01n04_06}}&lt;/ref&gt; This subculture is epitomized by the ''Leatherman's Handbook'' by [[Larry Townsend]], published in 1972, which describes in detail the practices and culture of gay male sadomasochists in the late 1960s and early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Townsend, Larry ''The Leatherman's Handbook'' 1972 Olympia Press, seventh edition 2004 available from L.T.

Alyson Pubns, 1996, {{ISBN|978-1-55583-281-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the early 1980s, lesbians also joined the leathermen as a recognizable element of the gay leather community. They also formed leather clubs, but there were some gender differences such as the absence of leatherwomen's bar. In 1981, the publication of ''[[Coming to Power]]'' by lesbian-feminist group [[Samois]] led to a greater knowledge and acceptance of BDSM in the lesbian community.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gayle Rubin]]: ''Samois'', Leather Times, 21:3–7., 2004, available from: [http://www.leatherarchives.org/resources/issue21.pdf leatherarchives.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327070824/http://www.leatherarchives.org/resources/issue21.pdf |date=27 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1990s, the gay men's and women's leather communities were no longer underground and played an important role in the kink community.&lt;ref name="a4b" /&gt;

Today the Leather Movement is generally seen as a part of the BDSM-culture instead of as a development deriving from gay subculture, even if a huge part of the BDSM-subculture was gay in the past. In the 1990s the so-called [[New Guard (leather subculture)|New Guard]] leather subculture evolved. This new orientation started to integrate psychological aspects into their play.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

=== Internet ===
In the late-eighties, the Internet provided a way of finding people with specialized interests around the world as well as on a local level, and communicating with them anonymously.&lt;ref name=sm101/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buzzle.com/articles/alternate-lifestyles-what-they-had-to-do-with-msn-chat.html|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130110170034/http://www.buzzle.com/articles/alternate-lifestyles-what-they-had-to-do-with-msn-chat.html|deadurl=yes|title=Alternate Lifestyles: What They Had to Do With MSN Chat|date=10 January 2013|archivedate=10 January 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This brought about an explosion of interest and knowledge of BDSM, particularly on the [[usenet]] group [[alt.sex.bondage]]. When that group became too cluttered with [[spamming|spam]], the focus moved to [https://groups.google.com/groups?q=soc.subculture.bondage-bdsm&amp;btnG=Google+Search soc.subculture.bondage-bdsm]. With an increased focus on forms of social media, [[FetLife]] was formed, which advertises itself as "a social network for the BDSM and fetish community". It operates similarly to other social media sites, with the ability to make friends with other users, events, and pages of shared interests.

In addition to traditional sex shops, which sell sex paraphernalia, there has also been an explosive growth of online [[adult toy]] companies that specialize in leather/latex gear and BDSM toys. Once a very [[niche market]], there are now very few sex toy companies that do not offer some sort of BDSM or [[Sexual fetishism|fetish]] gear in their catalog. Kinky elements seem to have worked their way into "[[Vanilla sex|vanilla]]" markets. The former niche expanded to an important pillar of the business with adult accessories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Birch|first=Dr Robert W.|url=http://www.leathernroses.com/generalbdsm/drbirchsextoys.htm|title=Adult Sex Toys|publisher=Leather Roses|accessdate=27 January 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080223075418/http://www.leathernroses.com/generalbdsm/drbirchsextoys.htm| archivedate= 23 February 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today practically all suppliers of sex toys do offer items which originally found usage in the BDSM subculture. Padded handcuffs, latex and leather garments, as well as more exotic items like soft whips for fondling and TENS for erotic electro stimulation can be found in catalogs aiming on classical vanilla target groups, indicating that former boundaries increasingly seem to shift.

During the last years the Internet also provides a central platform for networking among individuals who are interested in the subject. Besides countless private and commercial choices there is an increasing number of local networks and support groups emerging. These groups often offer comprehensive background and health related information for people who have been unwillingly outed as well as contact lists with information on [[psychologist]]s, physicians and lawyers who are familiar with BDSM related topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leathernroses.com/generalbdsm/generalbdsm.htm#toys|title=Implements/Toys|publisher=Leather Roses|accessdate=27 January 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080129080540/http://www.leathernroses.com/generalbdsm/generalbdsm.htm#breathcontrol| archivedate= 29 January 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 90 of the criminal code declares bodily injury (§§ 83-84) or the endangerment of physical security (§ 89) to not be subject to penalty in cases in which the victim has consented and the injury or endangerment does not offend moral sensibilities. Case law from the Austrian Supreme Court has consistently shown that bodily injury is only offensive to moral sensibilities, thus it is only punishable when a "serious injury" (a damage to health or an employment disability lasting more than 24 days) or the death of the "victim" results. A ''light injury'' is generally considered ''permissible'' when the "victim" has consented to it. In cases of threats to bodily well being the standard depends on the probability that an injury will actually occur. If serious injury or even death would be a likely result of a threat being carried out, then even the threat itself is considered punishable.&lt;ref name='Aus'&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislationline.org/download/action/download/id/6386/file/Germany_CC_am2016_de.pdf |title=Strafgesetzbuch (StGB)

In 2011, the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] ruled in ''[[R. v. J.A.]]'' that a person must have an active mind during the specific sexual activity in order to legally consent. The Court ruled that it is a criminal offence to perform a sexual act on an unconscious person—whether or not that person consented in advance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Woman can’t consent to sex while unconscious, Supreme Court rules |author= Mike Blanchfield|url= https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/998055--woman-can-t-consent-to-sex-while-unconscious-supreme-court-rules?bn=1|newspaper=[[The Toronto Star]] |date=27 May 2011 |accessdate=27 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to § 194 the charge of insult (slander) can only be prosecuted if the defamed person chooses to press charges. False imprisonment can be charged if the victim—when applying an objective view—can be considered to be impaired in his or her rights of free movement. According to § 228 of the German criminal code a person inflicting a bodily injury on another person with that person's permission violates the law only in cases where the act can be considered to have violated good morals in spite of permission having been given. On 26 May 2004 the Criminal Panel No. 2 of the [[Bundesgerichtshof]] (German Federal Court) ruled that sado-masochistically motivated physical injuries are not per se indecent and thus subject to § 228.&lt;ref&gt;Decision of the Bundesgerichtshof, 26 May 2004, 2 StR 505/03, which may be found at: BGHSt 49, 166 ([http://juris.bundesgerichtshof.de/cgi-bin/rechtsprechung/document.py?Gericht=bgh&amp;Art=en&amp;Datum=2004-5&amp;Seite=0&amp;nr=29672&amp;pos=19&amp;anz=244&amp;Blank=1.pdf bundesgerichtshof.de])&lt;/ref&gt;

Following cases in which sado-masochistic practices had been repeatedly used as pressure tactics against former partners in custody cases, the Appeals Court of [[Hamm]] ruled in February 2006 that sexual inclinations toward sado-masochism are no indication of a lack of capabilities for successful child-raising.&lt;ref&gt;Appeals Court of Hamm in its judgement of 1 February 2006, case number 10 UF 147/04, available online at the [http://www.justiz.nrw.de/ses/nrwesearch.php# Portal of the North Rhine-Westfalian Ministry of Justice] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041217060746/http://www.justiz.nrw.de/ses/nrwesearch.php |date=17 December 2004 }} (German)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Italy ===
In Italian law BDSM is right on the border between crime and legality, and everything lies in the interpretation of the legal code by the judge. This concept is that anyone willingly causing "injury" to another person is to be punished. In this context though "injury" is legally defined as "anything causing a condition of illness", and "illness" is ill-defined itself in two different legal ways. The first is "any anatomical or functional alteration of the organism" (thus technically including little scratches and bruises too); The second is "a significant worsening of a previous condition relevant to organic and relational processes, requiring any kind of therapy". This could make it somewhat risky to play with someone as later the "victim" may call foul play citing even an insignificant mark as evidence against the partner. Also any injury requiring over 20 days of medical care must be denounced by the professional medic who discovers it, leading to automatic indictment of the person who caused it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ayzad.com/ Ayzad], ''BDSM – Guida per esploratori dell'erotismo estremo'', Castelvecchi, 2004 {{ISBN|978-88-7615-025-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nordic countries ===
In September 2010 a Swedish court acquitted a 32-year-old man of assault for engaging in consensual BDSM play with a 16-year-old woman (the [[age of consent]] in Sweden is 15).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.se/29302/20100928|title=Man freed in landmark S&amp;M case|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014|date=2010-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Norway's legal system has likewise taken a similar position,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.revisef65.org/loven.html SM og loven] (Norwegian)&lt;/ref&gt; that safe and consensual BDSM play should not be subject to criminal prosecution. This parallels the stance of the mental health professions in the Nordic countries which have removed sadomasochism from their respective lists of psychiatric illnesses.

=== Switzerland ===
The age of consent in Switzerland is 16 years which also applies for BDSM play. Minors (i.e. those under 16) are not subject to punishment for BDSM play as long as the age difference between them is less than three years. Certain practices however require granting consent for light injuries with only those over 18 permitted to give consent. On 1 April 2002 Articles 135 and 197 of the Swiss Criminal Code were tightened to make ownership of ''"objects or demonstrations [...] which depict sexual acts with violent content"'' a punishable offense. This law amounts to a general criminalization of sado-masochism since nearly every sado-masochist will have some kind of media which fulfills this criterion. Critics also object to the wording of the law which puts sado-masochists in the same category as [[pedophilia|pedophiles]] and [[pederasty|pederasts]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ig-bdsm.ch/index.php?pid=24 Interessengemeinschaft BDSM Schweiz] (German)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
In British law, consent is an absolute defence to common assault, but not necessarily to actual bodily harm, where courts may decide that consent is not valid, as occurred in the case of [[R v Brown]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spannertrust.org/documents/sexualoffencesreview.asp|title=Spanner Trust submission to the Home Office Review Board on Sexual Offences|publisher=The Spanner Trust|accessdate=27 January 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071214235525/http://www.spannertrust.org/documents/sexualoffencesreview.asp| archivedate= 14 December 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, consensual activities in the UK may not constitute "assault occasioning actual or grievous bodily harm" in law. The [[Spanner Trust]] states that this is defined as activities which have caused injury "of a lasting nature" but that only a slight duration or injury might be considered "lasting" in law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The History of the Spanner Case|url=http://www.spannertrust.org/documents/spannerhistory.asp|publisher=[[Spanner Trust]]|accessdate=8 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision contrasts with the later case of R v Wilson in which conviction for non-sexual consensual branding within a marriage was overturned, the appeal court ruling that R v Brown was not an authority in all cases of consensual injury and criticizing the decision to prosecute.&lt;ref&gt;R v Wilson (1996). Text of ruling online at: {{cite web|title=R v Wilson (1996) 2 Cr App Rep 241|url=http://www.lawteacher.net/criminal-law/cases/consent-Wilson.php|publisher=LawTeacher.com|accessdate=8 February 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101228001313/http://www.lawteacher.net/criminal-law/cases/consent-Wilson.php|archivedate=28 December 2010|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following [[Operation Spanner]] the [[European Court of Human Rights]] ruled in January 1999 in [[Laskey, Jaggard and Brown v. United Kingdom]] that no violation of [[Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights|Article 8]] occurred because the amount of physical or psychological harm that the law allows between any two people, even consenting adults, is to be determined by the [[jurisdiction (area)|jurisdiction]] the individuals live in, as it is the State's responsibility to balance the concerns of [[public health]] and well-being with the amount of control a State should be allowed to exercise over its citizens. In the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill 2007, the British Government cited the Spanner case as justification for criminalizing images of consensual acts, as part of its proposed criminalization of possession of ''"[[extreme pornography]]"''.&lt;ref&gt;House of Commons: ''[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmbills/130/en/07130x-n.htm#index_link_206 Criminal Justice And Immigration Bill]''&lt;/ref&gt; Another contrasting case was that of Stephen Lock in 2013, who was cleared of actual bodily harm on the grounds that the woman consented. In this case, the act was deemed to be sexual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/gardener-cleared-of-assault-after-fifty-shades-of-greyinspired-sadomasochistic-sex-session-8461714.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Ben | last=Kendall | title=Gardener cleared of assault after Fifty Shades of Grey-inspired sadomasochistic sex session | date=22 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States Federal law does not list a specific criminal determination for consensual BDSM acts. Many BDSM practitioners cite the legal decision of [[People v. Jovanovic]], 95 N.Y.2d 846 (2000), or the "Cybersex Torture Case"{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}, which was the first U.S. appellate decision to hold (in effect) that one does not commit assault if the victim consents. However, many individual states do criminalize specific BDSM actions within their state borders. Some states specifically address the idea of "consent to BDSM acts" within their assault laws, such as the state of New Jersey, which defines "simple assault" to be "a disorderly persons offense unless committed in a fight or scuffle ''entered into by mutual consent'', in which case it is a petty disorderly persons offense".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://njlawman.com/legal%20research/2c.htm|title=New Jersey Criminal Offenses|author=|date=|website=njlawman.com|accessdate=28 November 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161104155828/http://njlawman.com/legal%20research/2c.htm|archivedate=4 November 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Oregon Ballot Measure 9]] was a [[initiative|ballot measure]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Oregon]] in 1992, concerning sadism, masochism, [[gay rights]], pedophilia, and [[public education]], that drew widespread national attention. It would have added the following text to the [[Oregon Constitution]]:
{{quote|All governments in Oregon may not use their monies or properties to promote, encourage or facilitate [[homosexuality]], [[pedophilia]], [[Sadism and Masochism|sadism]] or masochism. All levels of government, including [[public education]] systems, must assist in setting a standard for Oregon's youth which recognizes that these behaviors are abnormal, wrong, unnatural and perverse and they are to be discouraged and avoided.}}
It was defeated in 3 November 1992 [[general election]] with 638,527 votes in favor, 828,290 votes against.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sos.oregon.gov/blue-book/Documents/elections/initiative.pdf|title=Oregon Blue Book: Initiative, Referendum and Recall: 1988-1995|author=|date=|website=state.or.us|accessdate=28 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Coalition for Sexual Freedom]] collects reports about punishment for sexual activities engaged in by [[consenting adults]], and about its use in [[child custody]] cases.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

== Cultural aspects ==
{{See also|BDSM in culture and media}}
[[File:S&amp;M Dungeon 2 by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|left|Spanking with a [[paddle (spanking)|paddle]] in a BDSM dungeon in New York City.]]

Today the BDSM culture exists in most western countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwidebdsm.com/Club-&amp;amp-Munch-Directory |title=Worldwide Club and Munch Directory |accessdate=11 December 2007 |website=worldwidebdsm.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071227032451/http://www.worldwidebdsm.com/Club-%26amp-Munch-Directory |archivedate=27 December 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This offers BDSM practitioners the opportunity to discuss BDSM relevant topics and problems with like-minded people. This culture is often viewed as a [[subculture]], mainly because BDSM is often still regarded as "unusual" by some of the public. Many people hide their leaning from society since they are afraid of the incomprehension and of social exclusion. It is commonly known in the BDSM culture that there are practitioners living on all continents, but there is no documented evidence for many countries (due to restrictive laws and censorship motivated by politics or religion) except their presence in online BDSM communities and dating sites.{{Original research inline|date=December 2014}}

In contrast to frameworks seeking to explain sadomasochism through psychological, psychoanalytic, medical or forensic approaches, which seek to categorize behaviour and desires and find a root "cause", Romana Byrne suggests that such practices can be seen as examples of "aesthetic sexuality", in which a founding physiological or psychological impulse is irrelevant. Rather, sadism and masochism may be practiced through choice and deliberation, driven by certain aesthetic goals tied to style, pleasure, and identity. These practices, in certain circumstances and contexts, can be compared with the creation of art.&lt;ref&gt;Romana Byrne (2013) [https://books.google.com/books/about/Aesthetic_Sexuality.html?id=uccTAgAAQBAJ Aesthetic Sexuality: A Literary History of Sadomasochism], New York: Bloomsbury, pp.1-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Symbols ===
[[File:BDSM-rights-flag-Tanos.svg|150px|alt=BDSM Rights Flag colour|thumb|align=left|The BDSM rights flag.]]
[[File:Leather, Latex, and BDSM pride - Light.svg|150px|thumb|The [[leather pride flag]], a symbol of the BDSM and fetish subculture.]]
[[File:BDSM logo.svg|130px|thumb|[[Triskelion]]-type BDSM emblem.]]
One of the most commonly used symbols of the BDSM community is a derivation of a [[triskelion]] shape within a circle.&lt;ref name=Luminais&gt;{{cite book|last1=Luminais|first1=Misty|title=In the Habit of Being Kinky: Practice and Resistance in a BDSM Community, Texas, USA|date=May 2012|publisher=Washington State University|page=121|url=https://research.wsulibs.wsu.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/2376/4093/Luminais_wsu_0251E_10404.pdf?sequence=1|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Various forms of triskele have had many uses and many meanings in many cultures; its BDSM usage derives from the ''Ring of O'' in the classic book ''[[Story of O]]''. The BDSM Emblem Project claims copyright over one particular specified form of the triskelion symbol; other variants of the triskelion are free from such copyright claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://emblemproject.sagcs.net|title=Emblem Home Page|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[leather pride flag]] is a symbol for the [[leather subculture]] and also widely used within BDSM. In continental Europe, the ''[[Ring of O]]'' is widespread among BDSM practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Piontek|first1=Wolf|title=über den "Ring der O": Der Ring der O als Fetish und BDSM Symbol|url=http://www.fetish-jewels.com/ueberdenringdero/index.html|website=Fetish Jewels|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[triskelion]] as a BDSM symbol can easily be perceived as the three separate parts of the acronym BDSM; which are BD, DS, and SM (Bondage &amp; Discipline, Dominance &amp; Submission, Sadism &amp; Masochism). They are three separate items, that are normally associated together.

The BDSM rights flag, shown to the right, is intended to represent the belief that people whose sexuality or relationship preferences include BDSM practises deserve the same human rights as everyone else, and should not be discriminated against for pursuing BDSM with consenting adults.

The flag is inspired by the leather pride flag and BDSM emblem, but is specifically intended to represent the concept of BDSM rights and to be without the other symbols' restrictions against commercial use. It is designed to be recognisable by people familiar with either the leather pride flag or BDSM triskelion (or triskele) as "something to do with BDSM"; and to be distinctive whether reproduced in full colour, or in black and white (or another pair of colours).&lt;ref name="bdsmrights"&gt;{{cite web|title= BDSMrights.com |url=http://www.bdsmrights.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BDSM and [[fetish fashion|fetish items and styles]] have been spread widely in western societies' everyday life by different factors, such as [[avant-garde]] fashion, [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]], [[goth subculture]], and science fiction TV series,&lt;ref&gt;Fuentes Rodríguez, César: ''Mundo Gótico''. (Quarentena Ediciones, 2007, {{ISBN|978-84-933891-6-1}})&lt;/ref&gt; and are often not consciously connected with their BDSM roots by many people. While it was mainly confined to the [[Punk subculture|Punk]] and BDSM subcultures in the 1990s, it has since spread into wider parts of western societies.

===Movies and music===
* In music: the Romanian singer-songwriter [[Navi (Romanian singer)|Navi]] featured BDSM and [[Shibari]] scenes in her music video "Picture Perfect" (2014).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libertatea.ro/detalii/articol/navi-picture-perfect-videoclip-bondage-bdsm-shibari-511725.html|title=Videoclipul Care Nu Te Poate Lăsa Indiferent!

* In movies: While BDSM activity appeared initially in subtle form, in the 1960s famous works of literature like the ''[[Story of O]]'' and ''[[Venus in Furs]]'' were filmed explicitly. With the release of the 1986 film ''[[9½ Weeks]]'', the topic of BDSM was transferred to mainstream cinema. From the 1990s, cinematic representation of alternative sexualities, including BDSM, increased dramatically, as seen in documentary productions such as ''[[Graphic Sexual Horror]]'' (a 2009 film based on the website [[Insex]]), ''[[Kink (film)|Kink]]'' (a 2013 film based on the website [[Kink.com]]), and movies such as ''[[Fifty Shades of Grey (film)|Fifty Shades of Grey]]'' (2015) and its sequels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Falk|first1=G.|last2=Weinberg|first2=T.S.|title=Sadomasochism and Popular Western Culture|date=1983|publisher=NY Prometheus Books|location=Amherst, NY|pages=137–144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Theatre ===
Although it would be possible to establish certain elements related to BDSM in classical theater, not until the emergence of contemporary theatre would some plays have BDSM as the main theme. Exemplifying this are two works: one Austrian, one German, in which BDSM is not only incorporated, but integral to the storyline of the play.
* ''[[Worauf sich Körper kaprizieren]]'', Austria. Peter Kern directed and wrote the script for this comedy which is a present-day adaption of [[Jean Genet]]'s 1950 film, ''[[Un chant d'amour]]''. It is about a marriage in which the wife (film veteran Miriam Goldschmidt) submits her husband (Heinrich Herkie) and the butler (Günter Bubbnik) to her sadistic treatment, until two new characters take their places.&lt;ref&gt;[[Der Standard]], edición del 3 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Ach, Hilde]]'' (Oh, Hilda), Germany. This play by Anna Schwemmer premiered in Berlin. A young Hilde becomes pregnant, and after being abandoned by her boyfriend she decides to become a professional dominatrix to earn money. The play carefully crafts a playful and frivolous picture of the field of professional dominatrices.&lt;ref&gt;[[BILD]]-Zeitung, Berlín, 15 March 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Literature ===
{{main|Sadism and masochism in fiction}}
{{See also|List of BDSM authors}}
Although examples of literature catering to BDSM and fetishistic tastes were created in earlier periods, BDSM literature as it exists today cannot be found much earlier than [[World War II]].

The word Sadism originates from the works of [[Donatien Alphonse François, Marquis de Sade]], and the word Masochism originates from [[Leopold von Sacher-Masoch]], the author of ''[[Venus in Furs]]''. However, it is worth noting that the Marquis de Sade describes unconsented abuse in his works, such as in ''[[Justine (Sade novel)|Justine]]''. ''Venus in Furs'' describes a consented domme-sub relationship.

A central work in modern BDSM literature is undoubtedly the ''[[Story of O]]'' (1954) by [[Anne Desclos]] under the pseudonym [[Pauline Réage]].

Other notable works include ''[[9½ Weeks (book)|9½ Weeks]]'' (1978) by [[Elizabeth McNeill]], some works of the writer [[Anne Rice]] (''[[Exit to Eden]]'', and her ''[[The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty|Claiming of Sleeping Beauty]]'' series of books), [[Jeanne de Berg]] (''[[The Image (novel)|L'Image]]'' (1956) dedicated to [[Pauline Réage]]). Works from the [[Gor]] series by [[John Norman]], and naturally all the works of [[Patrick Califia]], [[Gloria Brame]], the group [[Samois]] and many of the writer [[Georges Bataille]] (Histoire de l'oeil-Story of the Eye, Madame Edwarda, 1937), as well as [[Bob Flanagan]]: ''Slave Sonnets'' (1986), ''Fuck Journal'' (1987), ''A Taste of Honey'' (1990). A common part of many of the poems of [[Pablo Neruda]] is a reflection on feelings and sensations arising from the relations of EPE or erotic exchange of power. The ''[[Fifty Shades trilogy|Fifty Shades]]'' trilogy is a series of very popular erotic romance novels by [[E. L. James]] which involve BDSM; however the novels have been criticized for their inaccurate and harmful depiction of BDSM.

In the 21st century, a number of prestigious university presses, such as [[Duke University]], [[Indiana University]] and [[University of Chicago]], have published books on BDSM written by professors, thereby lending academic legitimacy to this once taboo topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.chronicle.com/article/Scholars-in-Bondage/139251|title=Scholars in Bondage|journal=The Chronicle of Higher Education|date=20 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Art ===
{{See also|List of BDSM artists|List of BDSM photographers}}
* In photography: [[Eric Kroll]] and [[Irving Klaw]] (with [[Bettie Page]], the first well-known bondage model), and Japanese photographer [[Araki Nobuyoshi]], whose works are exhibited in several major art museums, galleries and private collections, such as the Baroness Marion Lambert, the world's largest holder of contemporary photographic art. Also [[Robert Mapplethorpe]], whose most controversial work is that of the underground BDSM scene in the late 1960s and early 1970s of New York. The homoeroticism of this work fuelled a national debate over the public funding of controversial artwork.
* Comic book drawings: [[Guido Crepax]] with ''Histoire d'O'' (1975), ''Justine'' (1979) and ''Venere in Pelliccia'' (1984); inspired by the work of [[Pauline Réage]], [[Marquis de Sade|Sade]] and [[Leopold von Sacher-Masoch]]. [[John Willie]] and the ''Adventures of Sweet Gwendoline'' (1984) which was the basis for the film ''[[The Perils of Gwendoline in the Land of the Yik-Yak|Gwendoline]]''. The ''[[Sunstone (comics)|Sunstone/Mercy]] (2011-ongoing)'' books by [[Stjepan Šejić|Stjepan Sejic]] have become very popular and are found in many conventional bookstores around the world.
* In graphic design: [[Eric Stanton]] and his work on dominance and female bondage, as well as [[Hajime Sorayama]] and Robert Bishop.
* In [[art deco]] sculpture: [[Bruno Zach]] produced perhaps his best known sculpture—called "The Riding Crop" (c. 1925)—which features a scantily clad [[dominatrix]] wielding a [[Crop (implement)|riding crop]].&lt;ref name=Bonhams&gt;{{cite web|title=Bruno Zach's 'Riding Crop Girl' hits World Record $150,602 at Bonhams art auction|url=https://www.justcollecting.com/miscellania/bruno-zachs-riding-crop-girl-hits-world-record-150-602-at-bonhams-art-auction)|website=justcollecting.com|accessdate=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Betamax''' (also called '''Beta''', as in its logo) is a consumer-level analog-recording and [[Videocassette#Cassette formats|cassette]] format of [[magnetic tape]] for [[video]].  It was developed by [[Sony]] and was released in [[Japan]] on May 10, 1975.&lt;ref name="McDonald2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=McDonald|first=Paul|title=Video and DVD Industries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G68TAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=6 June 2012|date=2007-08-06|publisher=British Film Institute|isbn=9781844571673|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Betamax device introduced in the United States was the LV-1901 console, which included a {{convert|19|in|cm|adj=on}} color monitor, and appeared in stores in early November 1975. The cassettes contain {{convert|0.50|in|mm|1|adj=mid|-wide}} [[videotape]] in a design similar to that of the earlier, professional {{convert|0.75|in|mm|adj=mid|-wide}}, [[U-matic]] format.  Betamax is obsolete, having lost the [[videotape format war]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia_term/0,2542,t=Betamax&amp;i=38569,00.asp |title=Betamax |publisher=Pcmag.com |date=1994-12-01 |accessdate=2012-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; to [[VHS]].  Production of Betamax recorders ceased in 2002; new Betamax cassettes were available until March 2016, when Sony stopped making and selling them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beta Video Cassette and Micro MV Cassette Tape End of Shipment Announcement|url=http://www.sony.co.jp/SonyInfo/News/Press/201511/15-1110/index.html|website=Sony Japan|publisher=Sony|accessdate=10 November 2015|date=10 November 2015|quote="In March 2016, Sony will end shipment of the Beta video cassette and micro cassette MV."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the rival videotape format VHS (introduced in Japan by JVC in October 1976&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.totalrewind.org/vhs/H_3300.htm] JVC HR-3300 release.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the United States by RCA in August 1977),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cedmagic.com/history/vbt200.html |title=CED in the History of Media Technology |publisher=Cedmagic.com |date=1977-08-23 |accessdate=2012-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Betamax has no [[Guard band#Recording|guard band]] and uses [[azimuth recording]] to reduce [[Crosstalk (electronics)|crosstalk]]. According to Sony's history webpages, the name had a double meaning: ''beta'' is the Japanese word used to describe the way in which signals are recorded on the tape; and the shape of the lowercase Greek letter [[Beta (letter)|beta]] (β) resembles the course of the tape through the transport. The suffix ''-max'', from the word "maximum", was added to suggest greatness.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20021017222845/http://www.sony.net/Fun/SH/1-13/h5.html "This is a revolution!"] Archive of Sony.net history&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1977, Sony issued the first long-play Betamax VCR, the SL-8200. This VCR had two recording speeds: normal, and the newer half speed. This provided two hours' recording on
the L-500 Beta videocassette. The SL-8200 was to compete against the VHS VCRs, which allowed up to 4, and later 6 and 8, hours of recording on one cassette.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rewindmuseum.com/betamax.htm |title=1975 – The Sony SL-8200 long play VCR |publisher=Rewindmuseum.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sanyo]] marketed a version as ''Betacord'', which also was casually called "Beta". In addition to Sony and Sanyo, Beta-format video recorders were manufactured and sold by [[Toshiba]], [[Pioneer Corporation|Pioneer]], [[Murphy Radio|Murphy]], [[Aiwa]], and [[NEC Corporation|NEC]].  The [[Zenith Electronics Corporation]] and [[WEGA]] Corporations contracted with [[Sony]] to produce VCRs for their product lines.  The department stores [[Sears]] (in the United States and Canada) and [[Quelle (company)|Quelle]] (in Germany) sold Beta-format VCRs under their house brands, as did the [[RadioShack]] chain of electronic stores. Betamax and VHS competed in a fierce [[Videotape format war|format war]], which saw VHS win in most markets.&lt;ref name="owen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediacollege.com/video/format/compare/betamax-vhs.html |title=The Betamax vs VHS Format War| author= Dave Owen| date= 2005 |publisher=Mediacollege.com |format= video|accessdate=2012-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Home and professional recording==
One other major consequence of the Betamax technology's introduction to the U.S. was the lawsuit ''[[Sony Corp. v. Universal City Studios]]'' (1984, the "Betamax case"), with the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] determining home videotaping to be legal in the United States, wherein home videotape cassette recorders were a legal technology since they had substantial noninfringing uses. This precedent was later invoked in ''[[MGM v. Grokster]]'' (2005), where the high court agreed that the same "substantial noninfringing uses" standard applies to authors and vendors of [[peer-to-peer]] file sharing software (notably excepting those who "actively induce" copyright infringement through "purposeful, culpable expression and conduct").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museum.tv/eotvsection.php?entrycode=betamaxcase |title= BETAMAX CASE |publisher=Museum.tv |date= |accessdate=2012-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Paul.

For the professional and broadcast video industry, Sony derived [[Betacam]] from Betamax. Released in 1982, Betacam became the most widely used videotape format in [[Electronic News Gathering|ENG]] (electronic news gathering), replacing the {{convert|.75|in|mm|abbr=on}} wide [[U-matic]] tape format. Betacam and Betamax are similar in some ways: they use the same videocassette shape, use the same oxide tape formulation with the same [[coercivity]], and record linear audio tracks in the same location of the tape. But in the key area of video recording, Betacam and Betamax are completely different. (For details, see the [[Betacam]] article.)

Sony also offered a range of industrial Betamax products, a Beta I-only format for industrial and institutional users. These were aimed at the same market as [[U-Matic]] equipment, but were cheaper and smaller. The arrival of Betacam reduced the demand for both industrial Beta and U-Matic equipment.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3NFAbjYD8MkC&amp;pg=PA38&amp;lpg=PA38&amp;dq=Betamax+Betamax+is+a+color-under+system&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=o2DvhcNqaN&amp;sig=ExW4ZhmE6e-3u_Ueq7pTd3_Gke8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vywrT-2ILYvKrAex9djIDA&amp;ved=0CFgQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=Betamax%20Betamax%20is%20a%20color-under%20system&amp;f=false |title=The filmmaker's handbook: a comprehensive guide for the digital age |author = Steven Ascher, Edward Pincus|page= 38 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Betamax also had a significant part to play in the music recording industry, when Sony introduced its [[Pulse-code modulation|PCM]] (Pulse Code Modulation) digital recording system as an encoding box/[[PCM adaptor]] that connected to a Betamax recorder. The Sony PCM-F1 adaptor was sold with a companion Betamax VCR SL-2000 as a portable [[digital audio]] recording system. Many recording engineers used this system in the 1980s and 1990s to make their first [[digital master]] recordings.

Initially, Sony was able to tout several Betamax-only features, such as BetaScan—a high speed picture search in either direction—and BetaSkipScan, a technique that allowed the operator to see where he was on the tape by pressing the FF key (or REW, if in that mode): the transport would switch into the BetaScan mode until the key was released. This feature is discussed in more detail on [[Peep Search]]. Sony believed that the M-Load transports used by VHS machines made copying these trick modes impossible. BetaSkipScan (Peep Search) is now available on miniature M-load formats, but even Sony was unable to fully replicate this on VHS. BetaScan was originally called "Videola" until the company that made the [[Moviola]] threatened legal action.

Sony would also sell a BetaPak, a small deck designed to be used with a camera. Concerned with the need for several pieces and cables to connect them, an integrated camera/recorder was designed, which Sony dubbed a "Camcorder"; the result was Betamovie. Betamovie used the standard-size cassette, but with a modified transport. The tape was wrapped 300[[Degree (angle)|°]] around a smaller, {{convert|44.671|mm|in|4|abbr=on}}-diameter head drum, with a single dual-azimuth head to write the video tracks. For playback, the tape would be inserted into a Beta-format deck. Due to the different geometry and writing techniques employed, playback within the camcorder was not feasible. SuperBeta and industrial Betamovie camcorders would also be sold by Sony.

===HiFi audio upgrade===
In June 1983, Sony introduced high fidelity audio to videotape as Beta Hi-Fi. For [[NTSC]], Beta HiFi worked by placing a pair of FM [[Carrier wave|carriers]] between the chroma (C) and luminance (Y) carriers, a process known as frequency multiplexing. Each head had a specific pair of carriers; in total, four individual channels were employed. Head A recorded its hi-fi carriers at 1.38(L) and 1.68(R) MHz, and the B head employed 1.53 and 1.83&amp;nbsp;MHz. The result was audio with an 80&amp;nbsp;dB dynamic range, with less than 0.005% [[wow (recording)|wow]] and [[flutter (electronics and communication)|flutter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.betainfoguide.net/BetaBetter.html |title=Why Beta is Better |publisher=Betainfoguide.net |date= |accessdate=2012-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the introduction of Beta Hi-Fi, Sony shifted the Y carrier up by 400&amp;nbsp;kHz to make room for the four FM carriers that would be needed for Beta Hi-Fi. All Beta machines incorporated this change, plus the ability to hunt for a lower frequency pre-AFM Y carrier. Sony incorporated an "antihunt" circuit, to stop the machine hunting for a Y carrier that wasn't there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palsite.com/format.html |title=Betamax the Better Format |publisher=Palsite.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Sony NTSC models were marketed as "Hi-Fi Ready" (with an SL-HFR prefix to the model's number instead of the usual SL or SL-HF). These Betamax decks looked like a regular Betamax model, except for a special 28-pin connector on the rear. If the user desired a Beta Hi-Fi model but lacked the funds at the time, he could purchase an "SL-HFRxx" and at a later date purchase the separate Hi-Fi Processor. Sony offered two outboard Beta Hi-Fi processors, the HFP-100 and HFP-200. They were identical except that the HFP-200 was capable of multi-channel TV sound, with the word "stereocast" printed after the Beta Hi-Fi logo. This was possible because unlike a VHS Hi-Fi deck, an NTSC Betamax didn't need an extra pair of heads. The HFP-x00 would generate the needed carriers which would be recorded by the attached deck, and during playback the AFM carriers would be passed to the HFP-x00. They also had a small "fine tracking" control on the rear panel for difficult tapes.

For [[PAL]], however, the bandwidth between the chroma and luminance carriers was not sufficient to allow additional FM carriers, so depth multiplexing was employed, wherein the audio track would be recorded in the same way that the video track was. The lower-frequency audio track was written first by a dedicated head, and the video track recorded on top by the video head. The head disk had an extra pair of audio-only heads with a different azimuth, positioned slightly ahead of the regular video heads, for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palsite.com/slospec.html |title=Sony SLO-1700 specs |publisher=Palsite.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sony was confident that VHS could not achieve the same audio performance feat as Beta Hi-Fi. However, to the chagrin of Sony, JVC did develop a VHS hi-fi system on the principle of depth multiplexing approximately a year after the first Beta Hi-Fi VCR, the SL-5200, was introduced by Sony. Despite initial praise as providing "CD sound quality", both Beta Hi-Fi and VHS HiFi suffered from "carrier buzz", where high frequency information bled into the audio carriers, creating momentary "buzzing" and other audio flaws. Both systems also used [[compander|companding]] noise-reduction systems, which could create "pumping" artifacts under some conditions. Both formats also suffered from interchange problems, where tapes made on one machine did not always play back well on other machines. When this happened and if the artifacts became too distracting, users were forced to revert to the old linear soundtrack.

===New standards: SuperBetamax and Extended Definition Betamax===
In early 1985, Sony would introduce a new feature, High Band or SuperBeta, by again shifting the Y carrier—this time by 800&amp;nbsp;kHz. This improved the bandwidth available to the Y sideband and increased the horizontal resolution from 240 to 290&amp;nbsp;lines on a regular-grade Betamax cassette. Since over-the-antenna and cable signals were only 300–330 lines resolution, SuperBeta could make a nearly identical copy of live television. However, the chroma resolution still remained relatively poor, limited to just under 0.4&amp;nbsp;MHz or approximately 30&amp;nbsp;lines resolution, whereas live broadcast [[chrominance]] resolution was over 100&amp;nbsp;lines. The heads were also narrowed to 29&amp;nbsp;[[Micrometre|μm]] to reduce crosstalk, with a narrower head gap to play back the higher carrier frequency at 5.6&amp;nbsp;MHz. Later, some models would feature further improvement, in the form of Beta-Is, a high band version of the Beta-I recording mode. There were some incompatibilities between the older Beta decks and SuperBeta, but most could play back a high band tape without major problems. SuperBeta decks had a switch to disable the SuperBeta mode for compatibility purposes. (SuperBeta was only marginally supported outside of Sony, as many licensees had already discontinued their Betamax line.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CT6UlAvKz88 |title=Sony SuperBetamax demo tape on youtube |publisher=Youtube.com |date=2010-09-03 |accessdate=2012-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.betamaxcollectors.com/sonysuperbetamaxmodelsl-hf600.html |title=Sony Super Betamax Model SL-HF600 |publisher=Betamaxcollectors.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, Sony would again push the envelope with ED Beta, or "Extended Definition" Betamax, capable of up to 500 lines of resolution, that equaled DVD quality (480 typical). In order to store the ~6.5&amp;nbsp;MHz-wide luma signal, with the peak frequency at 9.3&amp;nbsp;MHz, Sony used a metal formulation tape borrowed from the Betacam SP format (branded "ED-Metal") and incorporated some improvements to the transport to reduce mechanically induced aberrations in the picture. Beta ED also featured a luminance carrier deviation of 2.5&amp;nbsp;MHz, as opposed to the 1.2&amp;nbsp;MHz used in SuperBeta, improving contrast with reduced luminance noise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palsite.com/tapes.html |title=tapes Extended Definition" Betamax |publisher=Palsite.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sony introduced two ED decks and a camcorder in the late 1980s. The top end EDV-9500 (EDV-9300 in Canada) deck was a very capable editing deck, rivaling much more expensive U-Matic set-ups for its accuracy and features, but did not have commercial success due to lack of timecode and other pro features. Sony did market Beta ED to "semiprofessional" users, or "[[prosumers]]". One complaint about the EDC-55 ED CAM was that it needed a lot of light (at least 25&amp;nbsp;lux), due to the use of two CCDs instead of the typical single-CCD imaging device. The Beta ED lineup only recorded in BII/BIII modes, with the ability to play back BI/BIs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://joeclark.org/beta/BetterBetaList.html |title=Beta by Sony list |publisher=Joeclark.org |date=2004-12-26 |accessdate=2012-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the sharp decline in sales of Betamax recorders in the late 1980s and subsequent halt in production of new recorders by Sony in 2002, Betamax, SuperBetamax and EDBeta are still being used by a small number of people. Even though Sony stopped making new cassettes in 2016, new cassettes are still available for purchase at [[online shop]]s and used recorders are often found at [[flea market]]s, thrift stores or on [[Internet]] [[auction]] sites. Early format [[BetaCam]] cassettes—which are physically based on the Betamax cassette—continue to be available for use in the professional media.

The somewhat unintuitive analog resolution loss for 16:9 DVD compared to 4:3 DVD arises from the fact that analog resolution unit is "lines per picture height". When picture height is kept the same, the same 720 pixels are spread to a wider area in 16:9, hence lower horizontal resolution per picture height.

=== Tape lengths ===
Both [[Multi-standard television|NTSC and PAL/SECAM]] Betamax cassettes are physically identical (although the signals recorded on the tape are incompatible). However, as tape speeds differ between NTSC and PAL/SECAM, the playing time for any given cassette will vary accordingly between the systems. Other unusual lengths were produced from time to time, such as L-410.

* For NTSC only, BI is standard speed, BII is 1/2 speed, BIII is 1/3 speed

==Home movies==
{{Main article|Betamovie}}
Two-piece camera/VCR systems rapidly displaced [[Super 8 mm film]] as the medium of choice for shooting home movies and amateur films. These units included a portable VCR, which the videographer would carry by a shoulder strap, and a separate camera, which was connected to the VCR by a special cable. At this point, Beta had several advantages over VHS systems. The smaller Beta cassette made for smaller and lighter VCRs.

However, consumers wanted a one-piece solution. The first one-piece consumer camcorder, the Betamovie, came from Sony. A major requirement for a one-piece camcorder was miniaturizing the recording head drum, and Sony's solution to this involved a nonstandard video signal which would become standard only when played back on full-sized VCRs. A side effect of this was that Beta camcorders were record-only: consumers saw this as a major limitation.

VHS manufacturers found a better solution to drum miniaturization (it involved four heads doing the work of two). Because it used standard video signals, VHS camcorders could review footage in the camcorder and copy to another VCR for editing. This shifted the home movie advantage dramatically away from Beta, and was a primary reason for the loss of Beta market share: owners of Beta VCRs found that a VHS camcorder would allow them to copy and edit footage to their Beta deck – something that Betamovie could not do. If rental movies were not available in Beta, they could rent them in VHS and use their camcorder to play them. Owners of VHS VCRs could also choose a variant camcorder format called [[VHS-C]]. This used a miniaturized cassette to make a camcorder smaller and lighter than any Betamovie.

Sony could not duplicate the functionality of VHS-C camcorders, and seeing the rapid loss of market share, eventually introduced the [[Video8]] format. Their hope was that Video8 could replace both Beta and VHS for all uses. For more information, see the article on [[camcorders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507051842/http://www.floridahomemovies.com/wp/?page_id=185|archivedate=2017-05-07|url=http://www.floridahomemovies.com/wp/?page_id=185 |title=BetaMax history |publisher=Floridahomemovies.com|accessdate=2012-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==End of production==
On November 10, 2015, Sony announced that it would no longer be producing Betamax video cassettes.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-34776424 |title=Sony says goodbye to Betamax tapes|publisher=BBC News|date=2015-11-10|accessdate=2015-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Production and sales ended March 2016 after nearly 41 years of continuous production. Third party manufacturers continue to make new cassettes. While these cassettes are designed for use with the Betacam format, the cassettes are interchangeable with traditional Betamax systems.

==Legacy==
{{For|reasons Betamax lost to VHS|Videotape format war}}

The VHS format's defeat of the Betamax format became a classic [[marketing]] case study. Sony's attempt to dictate an industry standard backfired when [[JVC]] made the tactical decision to forgo Sony's offer of Betamax in favor of developing its own technology. JVC felt that accepting Sony's offer would yield results similar to the [[U-Matic]] deal, with Sony dominating.&lt;ref name="howells"&gt;John Howells. "The Management of Innovation and Technology: The Shaping of Technology and Institutions of the Market Economy" [hardcopy], pg 76–81&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1980, JVC's VHS format controlled 60% of the North American market.&lt;ref name="stern"&gt;{{cite web

In the United Kingdom, Betamax held a 25% market share in 1981, but by 1986, it was down to 7.5% and continued to decline further. By 1984, 40 companies made VHS format equipment in comparison with Beta's 12. Sony finally conceded defeat in 1988 when it, too, began producing VHS recorders (early models were made by [[Hitachi]]), though it still continued to produce Betamax recorders until 2002.&lt;ref name="owen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="scrapheap"&gt;{{cite news|title=Sony Finally Throws the Betamax on Scrapheap|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/aug/28/business/fi-beta28|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=August 28, 2002|accessdate=2012-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan, Betamax had more success and eventually evolved into Extended Definition Betamax, with 500+ lines of resolution.

The '''Bonville–Courtenay feud''' of 1455 engendered a series of raids, sieges, and attacks between two major [[Devon]] families, the [[House of Courtenay#The English House of Courtenay|Courtenays]] and the [[Baron Bonville|Bonvilles]], in [[south west England]], in the mid-fifteenth century. One of many such aristocratic feuds of the time, it became entwined with national politics due to the political weight of the protagonists. The Courtenay [[Earl of Devon|earls of Devon]] were the traditional powerbrokers in the region, but by this time a local baronial family, the Bonvilles, had become more powerful and rivalled the Courtenays for royal patronage. Eventually this rivalry spilled over into physical violence, including social disorder, murder and siege.

The Bonville-Courtenay feud is often given as an example of the degree to which law and order and respect for the king had broken down in the provinces. As a result, modern historians have often considered it a cause of the later [[Wars of the Roses]]; and indeed, the course of the feud often closely followed the sectarian politics of the day. The feud is perhaps most well known for culminating in an armed encounter at [[Clyst Heath|Clyst]] (called the fight, or sometimes the battle, of Clyst), near [[Exeter]], which resulted in loss of life.

The events at Clyst  resulted in government intervention in the politics of the west country. This was unusual, as the government did not have a good track-record of settling local disputes among the nobility. However, it is likely that this was done for reasons of higher politics; [[William Bonville, 1st Baron Bonville|William Bonville]] was by 1455 a Yorkist, and [[Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York|Richard, Duke of York]] had been made [[Lord Protector]]. Although in the short term it resulted in [[Thomas de Courtenay, 5th/13th Earl of Devon|Thomas de Courtenay, Earl of Devon]]'s incarceration, the Bonville–Courtenay feud did not come to an effective end until the protagonists were all killed in the early years of the civil wars.

==Background==
[[File:Tiverton , Tiverton Castle Ruins - geograph.org.uk - 1272097.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tiverton Castle]] ruins, the [[family seat]] of the Courtenays]]
The mid-fifteenth century suffered greatly from the private [[feud]]s of the [[nobility]], and the [[Wars of the Roses]] in general. Devonshire, whilst experiencing none of the pitched battles, was still ravaged by a private feud.&lt;ref&gt;Radford, G.H., 'The Fight at Clyst in 1455', ''The Devonshire Association'', 44 (1912), 252&lt;/ref&gt; This was between [[Thomas de Courtenay, 5th/13th Earl of Devon|Thomas Courtenay, Earl of Devon]], whose family had been [[Earl of Devon|earls of that county]] since 1335&lt;ref&gt;Cokayne, G.E. &amp; Gibbs, V.,(ed.), ''The Complete Peerage of Great Britain and Ireland'', 16 vols, rev. (London, 1916), 323&lt;/ref&gt; and [[William Bonville, 1st Baron Bonville]]. Their feud became inextricably tied to the national political scene, but originated in regional Devon society. In 2003, [[historian]] Martin Cherry agreed that the south west was to a great degree lawless at this time. However, he suggested that the Bonville-Courtenay feud, whilst being the best-known, is not the sole example of political upheaval in the region, which was common throughout the century.&lt;ref&gt;Kleineke, H., 'Why the West was Wild: Law and Disorder in Fifteenth-Century Cornwall and Devon', in: Clark, L.S., (ed.), ''The Fifteenth Century III: Authority and Subversion'' (Woodbridge, 2003), 76&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, historian [[R. L. Storey]] suggested that the [[civil war]]s which racked England for much of the fifteenth century had their origins in the breakdown of both the king's ability to govern, and law and order in the localities, and gave the Courtenay-Bonville feud as one such example.&lt;ref&gt;Storey, R.L., ''The End of the House of Lancaster'' (Guildford, 1966), 165–76.&lt;/ref&gt; The king, [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]], had been incapacitated by mental illness in August 1453.&lt;ref name="Wagner2001"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ubXnWRMt6uoC&amp;pg=PA113|title=Encyclopedia of the Wars of the Roses|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2001|isbn=978-1-85109-358-8|pages=113–|author=John A. Wagner}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the recall to court of the recalcitrant [[Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York|Richard, Duke of York]], his closest adult relative and a potential claimant to the throne.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/23503|title=Richard of York|website=www.oxforddnb.com|access-date=2017-03-18}} {{subscription required }}&lt;/ref&gt; York had been banished to his estates after a failed rebellion in 1452. The following year, with the king still incapacitated, York was appointed [[Lord Protector]] and First Councillor of the realm, for the duration of the king's illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/12953|title=Henry VI|website=www.oxforddnb.com|publisher=}} Retrieved 2017-03-18{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; He used this position to move against his chief rival, the hitherto dominant [[Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset|Edmund Beaufort, Duke of Somerset]], who was imprisoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/1855|title=Edmund Beaufort|website=www.oxforddnb.com|access-date=2017-03-18}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; By Christmas of 1454, King Henry had recovered from his illness, removing the basis for York's authority.&lt;ref&gt;Hicks, M.A., ''The Wars of the Roses'', (Yale, 2010), 107.&lt;/ref&gt; Henry and a select council of nobles decided to hold a great council at [[Leicester]]. York and his closest allies, his brother-in-law [[Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury|Richard Neville, Earl of Salisbury]] and Salisbury's son [[Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick|Richard, Earl of Warwick]], anticipated that charges might be brought against them at this assembly. They gathered an armed retinue and marched to stop the royal party from reaching Leicester, intercepting them at [[St Albans]]. Both militarily and politically it was a complete victory for York and the Nevilles. On 22 May 1455, at the [[First Battle of St Albans]] they captured the king and retook their places in government, while York's and the Nevilles' rivals, the [[Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset|Duke of Somerset]], the [[Henry Percy, 2nd Earl of Northumberland|Earl of Northumberland]], and [[Thomas Clifford, 8th Baron de Clifford|Lord Clifford]] were killed.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, A., ''The Wars of the Roses: Military Activity and English Society, 1452–97'', (London, 1981), 24&lt;/ref&gt; Among the royalists wounded were the [[Humphrey Stafford, 1st Duke of Buckingham|Duke of Buckingham]] and Somerset's son the [[Henry Beaufort, 3rd Duke of Somerset|Earl of Dorset]], the [[Thomas de Courtenay, 5th/13th Earl of Devon|Earl of Devon]], and the king's half-brother [[Jasper Tudor, Duke of Bedford|Jasper Tudor, Earl of Pembroke]].&lt;ref&gt;Hicks, M.A., ''The Wars of the Roses'', (Yale, 2010), 110.&lt;/ref&gt; York was appointed Protector of England, for the second time, by parliament a few months later.&lt;ref&gt;Hicks, M.A., ''The Wars of the Roses'', (Yale, 2010), 114&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor [[Ralph A. Griffiths]] places the fault for the feud between the Courtenays and Bonvilles firmly in the lap of King [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]], through whose "thoughtless liberality and government carelessness&amp;nbsp;... personal jealousies in the [[west country]] had been exacerbated."&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths, R.A., ''The Reign of Henry VI'', (Berkeley 1981), 577&lt;/ref&gt; However, more recently, Martin Cherry warned against seeing the feud as the same as the later civil wars writ small; they were, he says, "qualitatively" different, resulting in the ultimate disintegration of the earl's affinity, rather than symptomatic of his violence.&lt;ref&gt;Kleineke, H., 'Why the West was Wild: Law and Disorder in Fifteenth-Century Cornwall and Devon', in: Clark, L.S., (ed.), ''The Fifteenth Century III: Authority and Subversion'' (Woodbridge, 2003), 77&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Hicks (historian)|Michael Hicks]] has pointed out that although there were many other regional feuds at this time (including the [[John Talbot, 1st Viscount Lisle#Aggressive acquisition|Lisle]]-[[Berkeley family|Berkeley]] dispute, also waged in the west country), they did not have the same causes, or were necessarily caused by weak government at all: for instance, whereas the Bonville–Courtenay feud had territorial domination at its root, others, such as the Berkeley–Lisle dispute, were begun over contested [[inheritance]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Hicks, M.A., ''The Wars of the Roses'' (Totton, 2012), 96&lt;/ref&gt; Cherry has also suggested that the main cause of the Bonville–Courtenay dispute was the desperation of the earl to "gain access to crown patronage for himself and his clients" – something he was gradually failing to do in the face of competition.&lt;ref&gt;Cherry, M., 'The Struggle for Power in Mid-Fifteenth Century Devonshire', in Griffiths, R.A. (ed.), ''Patronage, the Crown and the Provinces in Later Medieval England'' (Gloucester, 1981), 123–4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Local politics===
[[File:Coat of Arms of Sir William Bonville, 1st Baron Bonville, KG.png|thumb|Coat of Arms of Sir William Bonville, 1st Baron Bonville]]
As noted, the feud between the Bonvilles and Courtenays was rooted in local Devonshire politics. The rivalry between them stemmed from the fact that they were major [[estate (land)|estate]] holders in the south west, and further, because both had claims to crown patronage. For example, William Bonville had fought in the [[Hundred Years' War]] for both Henry VI and his father, [[Henry V of England|Henry V]], whilst Devon through his wife was the king's cousin.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1912"&gt;Radford, G.H., 'The Fight at Clyst in 1455', ''The Devonshire Association'', 44 (1912), 253&lt;/ref&gt; Although the earl was both the greatest landowner and the highest ranking nobleman in the county, he had in recent years seen members of the lesser gentry and nobility (such as William Bonville) receive advancement in his stead.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1981"&gt;Griffiths, R.A., ''The Reign of Henry VI'', (Berkeley 1981), 574&lt;/ref&gt; Bonville had also furthered his own advancement by successively marrying into the lower nobility (a daughter of the [[Reginald Grey, 3rd Baron Grey de Ruthyn|Lord Grey of Ruthin]]) and then to an aunt of the Earl of Devon himself.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1981"/&gt; The main royal office in the area –  and therefore the main source of royal patronage –  was the stewardship of the highly profitable [[Duchy of Cornwall]]. Both men had held the office alternately over recent years. Tensions between the two have been traced back to 1437, when the stewardship was taken from Courtenay and granted to William Bonville. Courtenay did receive a royal grant of £100 ''per annum'' [[life annuity]] at this time. But, says Griffiths, this is unlikely to have made up for loss of the main royal office in the county.&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths, R.A., ''The Reign of Henry VI'', (Berkeley 1981), 574–5&lt;/ref&gt; Certainly, within two years, severe attacks were being launched on Bonville's property, and by 1440, relations between the two were, Griffiths says, "at breaking point." This tension became apparent in open manifestations of military strength; manifestations worrying enough to government to lead to them both being summoned before council.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;Griffiths, R.A., ''The Reign of Henry VI'', (Berkeley 1981), 575&lt;/ref&gt; In 1441 the stewardship was returned to the Earl of Devon, although Radford questions whether Bonville actually ever physically surrendered the office, as in November that year an [[arbitration]] took place between them to "end all [of their] differences."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1912"/&gt;

There followed a four-year period of peace; but this could simply be accounted for by the fact that Bonville spent that time in service in [[Gascony]], which, it has been suggested, may have been one of the conditions of the arbitration.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; It was, though, only a temporary peace for the region as by 1449 the earl besieged Bonville (now promoted to the [[baronage]] in recognition of his success in France)&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;Griffiths, R.A., ''The Reign of Henry VI'', (Berkeley 1981), 576&lt;/ref&gt; in his castle of [[Taunton Castle|Taunton]] for a year.&lt;ref&gt;Radford, G.H., 'The Fight at Clyst in 1455', ''The Devonshire Association'', 44 (1912), 254&lt;/ref&gt; Courtenay supported [[Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York|Richard, Duke of York]] in his 1452 rebellion at [[Dartford]], even joining him in the field against the king. This [[treason]] resulted in him forfeiting his royal offices in the south west, including not only the stewardship of the duchy – which was finally granted to Bonville for life – but [[Lydford Castle]], the [[Forest of Dartmoor]], and the [[River Exe|Water of Exe]].&lt;ref&gt;Radford, G.H., 'The Fight at Clyst in 1455', ''The Devonshire Association'', 44 (1912), 255&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, as his ally the duke was eclipsed in government, Courtenay was eclipsed by Bonville in the south west. Courtenay had –  in imitation of his ally –  waged a local war against Bonville and Bonville's ally, the [[James Butler, 5th Earl of Ormond|Earl of Wiltshire]], between 1451–5. Raising an army of 5–6,000 men, he forced Wiltshire to desert his manor of Lackham, and then returned to the siege of Taunton. The siege was only lifted when the Duke of York arrived unannounced three days later, and took the castle into his own hands, forcing a peace upon the two parties.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3" /&gt;

Bonville had, then, by April 1455, received much royal favour, including all the offices the earl had lost, as well as the constableship of [[Rougemont Castle|Exeter Castle]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1966"&gt;Storey, R.L., ''The End of the House of Lancaster'' (Guildford, 1966), 165&lt;/ref&gt; He was –  as one historian has called him –  "the King's lieutenant in the west." The Earl of Devon had already reacted against this hegemony during the Duke of York's first protectorate (1454–5) and joined the [[Curia regis|royal council]]. However, it appears that even the council itself did not trust him to keep the [[Queen's peace|King's peace]], as they placed him under a bond of £1,000 to do so. This he had disregarded,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1966"/&gt; and commenced another campaign against Bonville. This time, the Earl of Devon was accompanied by his sons, and, bringing a force of men into [[Exeter]] in April 1455, he attempted to ambush Bonville. This resulted in further government-imposed undertakings of good behaviour between the two parties. As the government was now headed by Courtenay's old ally, the Duke of York, it is likely that it was now that the earl decided to reject his alliance with York and give his support to the crown. He fought (and was wounded) at [[First Battle of St Albans|St Albans]] on 22 May that year, on the side of the king.&lt;ref&gt;Roskell, J.S., ''The Commons in the Parliament of 1422'' (Manchester, 1954), 155.&lt;/ref&gt; Bonville, meanwhile, through his wife, was related to the Harrington family of [[Hornby-with-Farleton|Hornby]], [[Lancashire]], who had close links to the [[House of Neville|Nevilles]] –  his father-in-law was [[Thomas Harrington (knight)|Thomas Harrington]], a [[feoffee]] and [[Bastard feudalism|retainer]] to the [[Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury|Earl of Salisbury]]. Bonville's new-found [[House of York|Yorkist]] sympathies seem to have driven the Earl of Devon to even greater violence in the county.&lt;ref&gt;Storey, R.L., ''The End of the House of Lancaster'' (Guildford, 1966), 166&lt;/ref&gt;

==The murder of Nicholas Radford==
[[File:Tower, Exeter castle (geograph 3468003).jpg|thumb|left|Tower at Exeter castle]]
From October 1455, Devon and his sons were committing acts of social disorder, seemingly intending to disrupt the administrative machinery of the county (of which Bonville, of course, was a part), for instance by preventing the local [[Justice of the peace|justices of the peace]] from holding quarterly sessions by force; they then proceeded to raise a small army at [[Tiverton, Devon|Tiverton]] under the leadership of Devon's eldest son, [[Thomas Courtenay, 6th/14th Earl of Devon|Thomas Courtenay]]. It was this force that was to be guilty of what [[R. L. Storey]] has called "the most notorious private crime of the century," due not only to the violence involved but the fact that it was "so obviously premeditated."&lt;ref&gt;Storey, R. L., ''The End of the House of Lancaster'' (Guildford, 1966), 167&lt;/ref&gt; This force made its way to [[Upcott, Cheriton Fitzpaine|Upcott]] on 23 October 1455, the home of [[Nicholas Radford]], a close associate and legal advisor to Bonville, and a respected member of the community who had previously been [[Recorder (judge)|recorder]] of the city of Exeter and [[member of parliament]]. Storey has suggested that being an experienced lawyer, he was most probably targeted by Devon and his sons for the very reason that he had aided Bonville's escape from Devon's litigation in the past;&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"&gt;Storey, R. L., ''The End of the House of Lancaster'' (Guildford, 1966), 168&lt;/ref&gt; and in January 1455 he had [[enfeoffed]] Bonville (and others) for land valued at £400.&lt;ref name="autogenerated5"&gt;Cherry, M., 'The Struggle for Power in Mid-Fifteenth Century Devonshire', in Griffiths, R.A. (ed.), ''Patronage, the Crown and the Provinces in Later Medieval England'' (Gloucester, 1981), 136&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas Courtenay's force attacked Radford's manor that night; they set fire to the wall and gates to draw him out. On their word, including Courtenay's solemn promise to do him no harm if he would speak with them, Radford let them in – although apparently he commented upon their large number. Whilst Radford and Devon's son drank wine, the latter's followers "ransacked"&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt; Radford's house, stealing goods up to the value of 1,000 [[Mark (currency)|marks]], including all his horses and the sheets off his [[Patient|invalid]] wife's bed.&lt;ref name="autogenerated6"&gt;Storey, R. L., ''The End of the House of Lancaster'' (Guildford, 1966), 169&lt;/ref&gt; On a pretext of meeting his father the earl, Courtenay persuaded Radford to accompany him when his force withdrew; however, he abandoned Radford on the road a short distance from the house, and six of Courtenay's men killed him.&lt;ref name="autogenerated6"/&gt; Devon subsequently dispatched a force to the [[chapel]] where Radford's body was; they performed, says Storey, a "mock inquest, one of them acting as coroner and others, with assumed names, as jurors. They brought in a verdict of [[suicide]]."&lt;ref name="autogenerated6"/&gt; They then forced Radford's servants to convey his corpse as if he had been a [[Heresy|heretic]] to the graveyard, where it was deposited unceremoniously into an open grave; the stones laid ready to build his memorial were then dropped on the body, crushing it. By making recognition of the body impossible, this prevented an official [[inquest]] being held into Radford's death.&lt;ref name="autogenerated6"/&gt;

==Following the murder==
The murder of Nicholas Radford, says R. L. Storey, was only "the curtain raiser" for further military activities. Devon proceeded to raise a force and occupy Exeter – "as if they were the city's lawful garrison" – until just before Christmas, seizing the [[Freedom of the City|keys of the city]];&lt;ref name="autogenerated7"&gt;Radford, G.H., 'The Fight at Clyst in 1455', ''The Devonshire Association'', 44 (1912), 257&lt;/ref&gt; various houses in the city belonging to Bonville and his supporters were ransacked, and members of the [[Exeter Cathedral|Cathedral]] were arrested and forced to buy their freedom. In one case, a man was bodily removed from the choir whilst celebrating [[Mass (Catholic Church)|Mass]]. Both Bonville and Courtenay had 'extensive relations' with the Cathedral, dating back to the 1430s, but the Courtenays had greatly contributed to its expansion in the previous century.&lt;ref&gt;Attreed, L., 'Arbitration and the Growth of Urban Liberties in Late Medieval England', Journal of British Studies, 31 (1992), 227–8&lt;/ref&gt; Their actions in 1455 were probably inspired by the fact that Radford had entrusted much of his wealth to the safe-keeping of the church, and Devon saw an opportunity to enrich himself; possibly, says Storey, he was forced to take such action to be able to pay his men.&lt;ref&gt;Storey, R.L., ''The End of the House of Lancaster'' (Guildford, 1966), 170&lt;/ref&gt; Martin Cherry has pointed to the lack of references to any martial expenses on the earl's behalf in the extant accounts, as indicating that his campaign effectively paid for itself.&lt;ref name="autogenerated5"/&gt; During the same period, Devon, "in warlike fashion and like an insurrection"&lt;ref name="autogenerated7"/&gt; also besieged [[Powderham Castle]], which belonged to his distant cousin and Bonville ally, Sir [[Philip Courtenay (died 1463)|Philip Courtenay]]; the latter resisted, and Bonville came to his assistance. Prior to doing this, however, he raided the Earl of Devon's house at [[Colcombe Castle]] and proceeded to ransack it. Bonville attempted to lift the siege at Powderham on 19 November, but was repulsed by Devon, and lost two men in the fight,&lt;ref name="autogenerated8"&gt;Storey, R.L., ''The End of the House of Lancaster'' (Guildford, 1966), 171&lt;/ref&gt; which may have involved up to a thousand men.&lt;ref&gt;Radford, G.H., 'The Fight at Clyst in 1455', ''The Devonshire Association'', 44 (1912), 258&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Devon continued his attempts to persuade the city of Exeter to raise a force on his behalf – which they refused to do – before leaving Exeter on 15 December,&lt;ref name="autogenerated8"/&gt; as Bonville approached, on his way to Powderham. The two forces met at Clyst, just south west of Exeter.&lt;ref&gt;Radford, G.H., 'The Fight at Clyst in 1455', ''The Devonshire Association'', 44 (1912), 260&lt;/ref&gt;

==The fight at Clyst==
[[File:MapBattleOfClystHeath1455.PNG|thumb|Map of the location of the Clyst engagement, 1455]]
Devon marched from Exeter to encounter Bonville at [[Clyst Heath]]; there are very few extant sources for the event, and only one chronicler provides any details, saying he "departed out of the city with his people into the field of Clyst, and there bickered and fought with the Lord Bonville and put them to flight, and so returned again that night into the city."&lt;ref name="autogenerated9"&gt;Storey, R.L., ''The End of the House of Lancaster'' (Guildford, 1966), 171–2&lt;/ref&gt; Many bones were discovered when the site was excavated in 1800, although some, Storey points out, must belong to those killed in the [[Prayer Book Rebellion#Clyst Heath massaacre | 1549 engagement on the same site]]. Although difficult to assess the extent to which the engagement can be described as a battle (one chronicler estimated the dead at twelve men)&lt;ref name="autogenerated10"&gt;Cherry, M., 'The Crown &amp; Political Society in Devon' (PhD thesis, University of Wales (Swansea), 1981), 307&lt;/ref&gt; it does appear to have been decisive in Devon's favour. The earl returned to Exeter, where the [[Mayor of Exeter|mayor]] had "tactfully" laid on a celebration.&lt;ref name="autogenerated9"/&gt; Hannes Kleineke has described the mayor's decision to illuminate the city walls on the earl's return as "pragmatic",&lt;ref&gt;Kleineke, H., '"þe Kynges Cite"– Exeter in the Wars of the Roses', in Clarke, L. (ed.), ''Conflicts, Consequences and the Crown in the Later Middle Ages: The Fifteenth Century VII''  (Woodbridge, 2007), 156&lt;/ref&gt; whilst Cherry explains the mayor's behaviour as being due to the fact that the earl, "in his peculiar manner, [had behaved] punctiliously" to the mayor.&lt;ref name="autogenerated10" /&gt; The earl subsequently sent a [[sortie (siege warfare)|sortie]] led by [[Thomas Carrew]]&lt;ref&gt;Storey, R.L., ''The End of the House of Lancaster'' (Guildford, 1966), 172&lt;/ref&gt; to attack Bonville's [[manor]] at [[Old Shute House#Bonville|Shute]] where they faced no resistance and pillaged freely, stealing Bonville's cattle, furnishings, and food.&lt;ref&gt;Orme, N., 'Representation and Rebellion in the Later Middle Ages', in Kain, R. &amp; W. Ravenhill (eds.), ''Historical Atlas of South-West England'' (Exeter, 1999), 141, 144.&lt;/ref&gt; The weeks preceding the battle had been accompanied by what has been called "exchange[s] of formal declarations of war disguised in the chivalric mode of challenges to a duel."&lt;ref name="autogenerated10" /&gt; Michael Hicks has suggested that, in spite of the earl's clear superiority in numbers, it was Bonville who "goaded the earl into a fair fight," and that "in the spirit of chivalry" the confrontation at Clyst was his fault.&lt;ref&gt;Hicks, M.A., The Wars of the Roses, (Yale, 2010), 116&lt;/ref&gt; Cherry too has suggested that Bonville and Courtenay of Powderham deliberately attempted to recruit members of the earl's historical tenantry, further poisoning relations,&lt;ref&gt;Cherry, M. 'The Courtenay Earls of Devon: The Formation and Disintegration of a Late Medieval Aristocratic Affinity', ''Southern History'', 1 (1979), 95&lt;/ref&gt; and also that, although doubtless the earl has deserved the 'universally bad press' he has received from modern historians, he was still "reluctant to go to war," and that he did so "only after all other methods of achieving his aims&amp;nbsp;... had failed."&lt;ref&gt;Cherry, M., 'The Struggle for Power in Mid-Fifteenth Century Devonshire', in Griffiths, R.A. (ed.), ''Patronage, the Crown and the Provinces in Later Medieval England'' (Glourcester, 1981), 123&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response from government==
[[File:PowderhamCastle FromUnderGatehouse.jpg|thumb|200px|Powderham Castle, west front, viewed from under the Victorian gatehouse. The leftmost tower dates from 1390–1450 as does the main high central block, which originally housed a full-height [[great hall]].&lt;ref&gt;Powderham Castle guide book, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
However decisive the Earl of Devon's victory had been, it had also drawn the attention of the government. This was still under the control of Bonville's allies, York, Salisbury, and Warwick, but had up until that point the Yorkists had failed to intervene in this local feud. The feud has been described as an example of local activities influencing parliament itself,&lt;ref&gt;Lander, J.R., 'Henry Vl and the Duke of York's Second Protectorate, 1455-6', ''Bulletin of the John Rylands Library'', 3 (1960), 59&lt;/ref&gt; and Griffiths said it was used as "a pretext for demanding York's appointment as protector."&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths, R.A., ''The Reign of Henry VI'', (Berkeley 1981), 755&lt;/ref&gt; When parliament reassembled on 12 November it was presented with reports that Devon was leading an army of about 4,000 men and including 400 cavalry to London. The king was still incapacitated. Unable to manage the situation; the Duke of York used the immediate necessity for intervention as a mechanism for being formally appointed Protector. He did not immediately hasten to the south west to punish the Earl of Devon, though. The earl was merely dismissed from his role on the [[Justice of the peace|commission of the peace]] in early December.&lt;ref&gt;Storey, R.L., ''The End of the House of Lancaster'' (Guildford, 1966), 172–3&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, the local gentry were ordered to be ready to assist York. The duke did not set out until news was received of the Clyst confrontation. One chronicler states that following his defeat, Bonville "fled, and came to Grenewiche to the kyng, and the kyng sent him agayne to the lord protectour;"&lt;ref&gt;Lander, J.R., 'Henry Vl and the Duke of York's Second Protectorate, 1455-6', ''Bulletin of the John Rylands Library'', 3 (1960), 64&lt;/ref&gt; although it is also possible that he was committed to the [[Fleet Prison]] for a short time.&lt;ref&gt;Cherry, M., 'The Crown &amp; Political Society in Devon' (Ph.D thesis, University of Wales (Swansea) 1981), 303&lt;/ref&gt; When finally York left for the south west, he summoned the Earl of Devon to [[Shaftesbury]] where the earl was arrested and sent to the [[Tower of London]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated11"&gt;Storey, R.L., ''The End of the House of Lancaster'' (Guildford, 1966), 173&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
The Earl of Devon remained imprisoned for only a few months. It is possible that an attempt was made to bring him to trial in February, but if so, it was probably – in Storey's words – "countermanded." This could have been, he suggests, indicative of York's "waning" position, as the protectorate was soon to come to an end:&lt;ref name="autogenerated11"/&gt; Cherry has said that the king's resumption of personal power in February 1456 must have come as "a considerable relief" to the earl.&lt;ref name="autogenerated12"&gt;Cherry, M., 'The Struggle for Power in Mid-Fifteenth Century Devonshire', in Griffiths, R.A. (ed.), ''Patronage, the Crown and the Provinces in Later Medieval England'' (Gloucester, 1981), 138&lt;/ref&gt; He seems to have taken the Yorkists' eclipse as a further opportunity to continue the feud, which provoked governmental admonishment in March, when his son [[John Courtenay, 15th Earl of Devon|John Courtenay]], with 500 armed men, again prevented the Exeter justices of the peace from sitting, and evicted them. [[Letters patent|Commissions]] of ''[[oyer and terminer]]'' were issued in August, being led by Bonville's ally the [[James Butler, 5th Earl of Ormond|Earl of Wiltshire]].&lt;ref&gt;Storey, R.L., ''The End of the House of Lancaster'' (Guildford, 1966), 173–4&lt;/ref&gt; Although Bonville presented a long list of offences committed by Devon to the council (whilst mitigating his own involvement), the crown "was obviously unimpressed" by this, and eventually not only restored Devon to commission of the peace (12 September 1456) but also pardoned him and his sons for any involvement in the murder of Radford, eventually even appointing him to the lucrative office of keeper of the forest and park of [[Clarendon Park, Wiltshire|Clarendon]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated12"/&gt; The region subsequently remained quiet; Bonville was of advanced age and Devon was possibly unwell, as he died in [[Abingdon-on-Thames|Abingdon]] within eighteen months.&lt;ref&gt;Storey, R.L., ''The End of the House of Lancaster'' (Guildford, 1966), 174&lt;/ref&gt; His will was executed by some of the most important men on the Queen's council.&lt;ref name="autogenerated12"/&gt;

The region took no active part in the ensuing civil wars until the [[Battle of Tewkesbury]] in 1471, but both parties to the feud were killed in the civil wars over the next few years. The new [[Thomas Courtenay, 6th/14th Earl of Devon|Earl of Devon]], who had killed Radford, was a thorough supporter of the [[House of Lancaster|Lancastrian]] regime. After the [[House of York|Yorkist]] victory at the [[Battle of Northampton (1460)|Battle of Northampton]] in June 1460, he took his troops northwards to [[Margaret of Anjou]]&lt;ref name="autogenerated12"/&gt; in [[York]], where, in April 1461, he was executed by the new king, [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]] after the [[Battle of Towton]]. Bonville's son and grandson had been killed with the [[Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York|Duke of York]] and the [[Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury|Earl of Salisbury]] at the [[Battle of Wakefield]] in December 1460, and Bonville himself, captured after the [[Second Battle of St Albans]] was summarily beheaded&lt;ref&gt;Storey, R.L., ''The End of the House of Lancaster'' (Guildford, 1966), 174–5&lt;/ref&gt; – probably, so the chroniclers tell us, after a mock trial directly instigated by the Earl of Devon.&lt;ref&gt;Cherry, M., 'The Struggle for Power in Mid-Fifteenth Century Devonshire', in Griffiths, R.A. (ed.), ''Patronage, the Crown and the Provinces in Later Medieval England'' (Gloucester, 1981), 138–9&lt;/ref&gt;

In philosophy, the '''Cartesian Other''', part of a thought experiment, is any other than the mind of the individual thinking about the experiment. The Other includes the individual's own body. According to the philosopher [[Descartes]], there is a divide intrinsic to consciousness, such that you cannot ever bridge the space between your own consciousness and that of another.

This "other" is in essence theoretical, since one cannot ever be [[empirical]]ly shown such an "other."

Put differently, Descartes concluded ''[[cogito ergo sum]]'', "I think, therefore I am," that is, that the presence of a self of which to speak (an "I") proves its existence to oneself; however, according to his [[Descartes#Philosophical work|Wax Argument]], one could never similarly demonstrate the existence of the "other."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8924">The term '''corporate donation''' refers to any financial contribution made by a corporation to another organization that furthers the contributor's own objectives. Two major kinds of such donations deserve specific consideration, charitable as well as political donations.

==Charitable donations==
Corporations give to charitable causes, either because of the personal convictions of influential leaders within the corporation, or more commonly to help establish the public perception that the corporation is a good [[Corporate citizenship|corporate citizen]].

===Types===
Corporate charitable giving can be divided into direct cash and non-cash contributions. Direct cash giving comes from corporate headquarters, regional offices, or company sponsored foundations. Examples of direct cash contributions include:
* Community grants to support local community efforts or nonprofits - 100% of Fortune 500 companies provide some form of community grant or sponsor at least one fundraising event.&lt;ref name=GUSA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.givingusareports.org/products/GivingUSA_2011_ExecSummary_Print.pdf|title=givingusareports.org|website=www.givingusareports.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Matching gift]]s - Corporate donations to nonprofits as a match to employee giving. Approximately 65% of Fortune 500 companies offer these programs.&lt;ref name=DTD&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doublethedonation.com/FAQ/OurDatabase.php|title=Double the Donation Customer Support|website=www.doublethedonation.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Volunteer grant]]s - Giving to nonprofits in recognition of employee-volunteer service to that organization. Approximately 40% of Fortune 500 companies offer these programs.&lt;ref name=DTD/&gt;

Non-cash contributions are contributions of equipment, supplies or time, and do not include cash contributions. Examples of non-cash contributions include:
* Donation of new or used equipment or supplies, such as computers and other electronic equipment, office supplies, and targeted supplies such as clothing, canned goods, or paper products.
* Use of organizational services/facilities, such as financial and administrative support, computer services, printing, mailing or copying, or targeted professional services and support.
* Application of professional services, such as tax and financial advice, strategic planning and organizational development, graphic arts and copy writing, and legal assistance.

Non-cash contributions can also be interpreted through an organization's policy to allow employees [[paid time off]] when performing volunteer work.

===Annual charitable giving figures===
Total corporate cash donations in 2010 are estimated to be $15.29 billion in the United States.&lt;ref name=GUSA/&gt; Of that, ~80%-85% came from corporate grants and sponsorship of fundraising events while ~15%-20% or $2–$3 billion came from corporate [[matching gifts]] and [[volunteer grants]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.corporatephilanthropy.org/pdfs/giving_in_numbers/GivinginNumbers2011.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political donations ==

There is a wide range of models of [[political finance]] in democracies; political donations by individuals and organizations are one of many sources of funding.

=== United States ===

In the US, corporations are prohibited from making expenditures to influence federal elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fec.gov/pages/brochures/fecfeca.shtml#Contribution_Limits|title=Home - FEC.gov|website=FEC.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=52 U.S. Code § 30118 |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/52/30118 |website=Legal Information Institute |accessdate=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar restrictions exist in many state elections and have been upheld by the US Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-election-idUSBREA360XH20140407|title=Supreme Court declines to hear Iowa campaign finance challenge|date=7 April 2014|publisher=|via=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corporations may make donations to [[Political Action Committees]] (PACs); PACs generally have strict limits on their ability to advocate on behalf of specific parties or candidates, or even to coordinate their activities with political campaigns. PACs are subject to disclosure requirements at the federal and state levels. The ability of corporations to engage in such independent expenditures has been subject to intense debate after the US Supreme Court struck down, on free-speech grounds, limits in [[Citizens United v. FEC]], a case involving the creation of a film critical of [[Hillary Clinton]] by a [[nonprofit corporation]].

Donations are closely tracked by a number of organizations, including the [[Center for Responsive Politics]] (opensecrets.org). Such organizations often group donations under specific corporations, but such donations refer to contributions from individuals and PACs associated with the corporation, not "corporate donations".

Corporate donations to PACs and Super PACs are a [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] issue and subject to intense political debate in the US. Proponents of tighter regulations of political donations by corporations argue&lt;ref&gt;Warwick Smith, [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/11/political-donations-corrupt-democracy-in-ways-you-might-not-realise Political donations corrupt democracy]&lt;/ref&gt; that corporate donations corrupt democracy. Other research suggests that post-election lobbying and access to politicians, rather than campaign contributions, shapes and reinforces policy decision by politicians&lt;ref&gt;John R. Wright: [http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=8975727&amp;fileId=S0003055400192573 Contributions, Lobbying, and Committee Voting in the U.S. House of Representatives], American Political Science Review 84(2), 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Germany ===

In Germany, both individuals and corporations may make unlimited contributions to political parties. These contributions are partially tax exempt and partially matched by government funds; contributions of more than 10000 Euros are reportable.

During the 2013 election cycle in Germany, corporations and other organizations made direct contributions to German political parties in the amount of at least 24.2 million Euros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/wirtschaft/article138941661/Parteispenden-Wer-von-wem-wie-viel-Geld-bekommt.html|title=Parteispenden – Welche Unternehmen wem wie viel zahlen - WELT|website=DIE WELT}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to public subsidies of political parties and membership dues, such donations in Germany generally represent about 15% of the total revenue of major political parties; see [[Party finance in Germany]].

=== Other countries ===

Australia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and Turkey have no limits on either contributions for parliamentary elections or on spending on such elections; in Belgium, Canada, Chile, France, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Japan, South Korea, Poland, and Slovenia, there are limits on both contributions and spending; Austria, Hungary, Italy, New Zealand, Slovakia, the United Kingdom have no limits on contributions but do have limits on spending; Finland and the United States have limits on contributions but not on spending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prospect.org/article/how-our-campaign-finance-system-compares-other-countries|title=How Our Campaign Finance System Compares to Other Countries|last=Waldman|first=Paul|publisher=prospect.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Culture theory''' is the branch of comparative [[anthropology]] and [[semiotics]] (not to be confused with [[cultural sociology]] or [[cultural studies]]) that seeks to define the [[heuristic]] concept of [[culture]] in [[operationalism|operational]] and/or [[scientific method|scientific]] terms.

==Overview==
In the 19th century, "[[culture]]" was used by some to refer to a wide array of [[human]] activities, and by some others as a synonym for "[[civilization]]".  In the 20th century, [[Anthropology|anthropologists]] began theorizing about culture as an object of scientific analysis.  Some used it to distinguish human [[Adaptation (biology)|adaptive strategies]] from the largely [[instinct]]ive adaptive strategies of [[animal]]s, including the adaptive strategies of other [[primate]]s and non-human [[Hominidae|hominid]]s, whereas others used it to refer to symbolic [[representation (arts)|representations]] and expressions of human experience, with no direct adaptive value.  Both groups understood culture as being definitive of [[human nature]].

According to many [[theory|theories]] that have gained wide acceptance among anthropologists, culture exhibits the way that humans interpret their [[biology]] and their [[social environment|environment]]. According to this point of view, culture becomes such an integral part of human [[existentialism|existence]] that it ''is'' the human environment, and most cultural [[Social change|change]] can be attributed to human adaptation to [[history|historical events]].  Moreover, given that culture is seen as the primary adaptive mechanism of humans and takes place much faster than [[human evolution|human biological evolution]], most cultural change can be viewed as culture adapting to itself.

Although most anthropologists try to define culture in such a way that it separates human beings from other animals, many human traits are similar to those of other animals, particularly the traits of other primates.  For example, [[chimpanzee]]s have big [[brain]]s, but human brains are bigger.  Similarly, [[bonobo]]s exhibit complex [[non-human animal sexuality|sexual behaviour]], but human beings exhibit much more complex [[human sexuality|sexual behaviours]].  As such, anthropologists often debate whether [[human behaviour]] is different from [[ethology|animal behaviour]] in degree rather than in kind; they must also find ways to distinguish cultural behaviour from sociological behaviour and [[psychological]] behavior.

Acceleration and amplification of these various aspects of culture change have been explored by complexity economist, [https://web.archive.org/web/20110123150543/http://tuvalu.santafe.edu/~wbarthur/Papers/Papers.html W. Brian Arthur]. In his book, ''The Nature of Technology'', Arthur attempts to articulate a [[theory of change]] that considers that existing technologies (or material culture) are combined in unique ways that lead to novel new technologies. Behind that novel combination is a purposeful effort arising in human motivation. This articulation would suggest that we are just beginning to understand what might be required for a more robust theory of culture and culture change, one that brings coherence across many disciplines and reflects an integrating elegance.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12359">'''Defensive pessimism '''is a [[cognitive strategy]] identified by [[Nancy Cantor]] and her students in the mid-1980s.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Norem, J.K. (2001). [https://www.academia.edu/download/34814974/Optimisrm.pdf#page=69 Defensive pessimism, optimism, and pessimism]. In Chang, Edward (Ed). ''Optimism &amp; pessimism: Implication for theory, research, and practice'' (pp. 77–100). Washington DC: American Psychological Association.&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals use defensive pessimism as a strategy to prepare for anxiety-provoking events or performances. When implementing defensive pessimism, individuals set low expectations for their performance, regardless of how well they have done in the past. Defensive pessimists then think through specific negative events and setbacks that could adversely influence their goal pursuits. By envisioning possible negative outcomes, defensive pessimists can take action to avoid or prepare for them.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Norem, J. K. (2008). Defensive pessimism, anxiety, and the complexity of evaluating self-regulation. ''Social and Personality Psychology Compass, 2,'' 121-134.&lt;/ref&gt; Using this strategy, defensive pessimists can advantageously harness anxiety that might otherwise harm their performance.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Norem. J. K., &amp; Cantor, N. (1986) [https://www.academia.edu/download/44539514/Norem_CantorJPSP86.pdf Defensive pessimism: Harnessing anxiety as motivation]. ''Journal of Personality and Psychology, 51,'' 1208–1217.&lt;/ref&gt;

Defensive pessimism is utilized in a variety of domains, and [[public speaking]] provides a good example of the process involved in this strategy. Defensive pessimists could alleviate their anxiety over public speaking by imagining possible obstacles such as forgetting the speech, being thirsty, or staining their shirts before the event. Because defensive pessimists have thought of these problems, they can appropriately prepare to face the challenges ahead. The speaker could, for instance, create note cards with cues about the speech, place a cup of water on the podium to alleviate thirst, and bring a bleach pen to remove shirt stains. These preventative actions both reduce anxiety and promote superior performance.

==Strategy effectiveness==
Though defensive pessimists are less satisfied with their performances and rate themselves higher in "need for improvement," they do not actually perform worse than people with a more optimistic strategy. Norem and Cantor (1986) investigated whether encouraging defensive pessimists, and thereby interfering with their typical negative thinking, would result in worse performances. Participants in the study were in either encouragement or non-encouragement scenarios as they prepared to complete anagram and puzzle tasks. In the encouragement condition, the defensive pessimists were told that, based on their GPA, they should expect to do well. Defensive pessimists performed worse when encouraged than the defensive pessimists whose strategy was not manipulated.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Defensive pessimism is an adaptive strategy for those who struggle with anxiety: their performance decreases if they are unable to appropriately manage and counteract their anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;Norem, J. (2001). ''The Positive Power of Negative Thinking''. Cambridge, MA: Basic Books&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key components==

===Prefactual thinking===
[[File:The Prefactual Thought Experiment.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Temporal representation of a prefactual thought experiment.&lt;ref&gt;Taken from Yeates, 2004, p.143.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Prefactual (i.e., "before the fact") thinking is an essential component of defensive pessimism. Synonymous with [[anticipation]], it denotes a cognitive strategy in which people imagine possible outcomes of a future scenario. The term '''prefactual''' was specifically coined by Lawrence J. Sanna, in 1998,&lt;ref&gt;He did so in order to contrast and distinguish the ''[[Thought_experiment#Prefactual|prefactual sort of thought experiment]]'' from both ''[[Thought_experiment#Semifactual|the semifactual]]'' and ''[[Thought_experiment#Counterfactual|the counterfactual sort of thought experiments]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; to denote those activities that speculate on possible future outcomes, given the present, and ask "What will be the outcome if event E occurs?"

The imagined outcomes are either positive/desirable, negative/undesirable, or neutral. Prefactual thinking can be advantageous because it allows the individual to prepare for possible outcomes of a scenario.

For defensive pessimists, prefactual thinking offers the primary and critical method to alleviate anxiety.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Usually, this prefactual thinking is paired with a pessimistic outlook, resulting in negative/undesirable imagined scenarios. With regard to the earlier example, the public speaking defensive pessimist anticipates forgetting the speech or becoming thirsty as opposed to giving an amazing speech and receiving a standing ovation.

===Anxiety===
As defensive pessimism is motivated by a need to manage anxiety, it is unsurprisingly also correlated with trait anxiety and [[neuroticism]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Negative mood states promote defensive pessimists' goal attainment strategy by facilitating the generation of potential setbacks and negative outcomes that could arise during goal pursuit, which can then be anticipated and prevented. When defensive pessimists are encouraged into positive or even just neutral mood states, they perform worse on experimental tasks than when in a negative mood state. They are more anxious because they are prevented from properly implementing their preferred cognitive strategy for goal attainment.&lt;ref&gt;del Valle, C. H. &amp; Mateos, P. M. (2008). Dispositional pessimism, defensive pessimism and optimism: The effect of induced mood on prefactual and counterfactual thinking and performance. ''Cognition and Emotion, 22''(8). 1600-1612.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Self-esteem==
Defensive pessimism is generally related to lower [[self-esteem]] since the strategy involves self-criticism, pessimism, and discounting previous successful performances. Indeed, Norem and Burdzovic Andreas (2006) found that, compared to optimists, defensive pessimists had lower self-esteem entering college. At the end of four years of college, however, the self-esteem of the defensive pessimists had increased to nearly equal levels as optimists. The self-esteem of optimists had not changed, and the self-esteem of pessimists who did not employ defensive pessimism had fallen slightly by the end of college.&lt;ref&gt;Norem, J. K., &amp; Burdzovic Andreas, J. (2006). Understanding journeys: Individual  growth analysis as a tool for studying individual differences in change over time. In A. D. Ong  &amp; M. van Dulmen (Eds.), ''Handbook of Methods in Positive Psychology'' (pp. 1036-1058). London: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; While defensive pessimism may have implications for self-esteem, it appears that these effects lessen over time.

==Compared to pessimism==
Unlike [[pessimism]], defensive pessimism is not an internal, global, and stable attribution style, but rather a cognitive strategy utilized within the context of certain goals.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Pessimism involves rumination about possible negative outcomes of a situation without proactive behavior to counteract these outcomes. Defensive pessimism, on the other hand, utilizes the foresight of negative situations in order to prepare against them. The negative possible outcomes of a situation often motivate defensive pessimists to work harder for success. Since defensive pessimists are anxious, but not certain, that negative situations will arise, they still feel that they can control their outcomes.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Norem, J. K. (2008). Defensive pessimism as a positive self-critical tool. In Chang, Edward (Ed). ''Self-criticism and self enhancement: Theory and research and clinical implications'' (pp. 89-104). Washington DC: American Psychological Association.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a defensive pessimist would not avoid all job interviews for fear of failing one. Instead, a defensive pessimist would anticipate possible challenges that could come in an upcoming job interview – such as dress code, stubborn interviewers, and tough questions – and prepare rigorously to face them. Defensive pessimism is not a reaction to stressful events nor does it entail ruminating on events of the past, and should therefore be distinguished from pessimism as a trait or a more general negative outlook. Instead, defensive pessimists are able to stop using this strategy once it is no longer beneficial (i.e., does not serve a preparatory role).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Compared to other cognitive strategies==

===Self-handicapping===
Elliot and Church (2003) determined that people adopt defensive pessimism or self-handicapping strategies for the same reason: to deal with anxiety-provoking situations. [[Self-handicapping]] is a cognitive strategy in which people construct obstacles to their own success to keep failure from damaging their self-esteem. The difference between self-handicapping and defensive pessimism lies in the motivation behind the strategies. Beyond managing anxiety, defensive pessimism is further motivated by a desire for high achievement. Self-handicappers, however, feel no such need. Elliot and Church found that the self-handicapping strategy undermined goal achievement while defensive pessimism aided achievement. People who self-handicapped were high in avoidance motivation and low in approach motivation. They wanted to avoid anxiety but were not motivated to approach success. Defensive pessimists, on the other hand, were motivated to approach success and goal attainment while simultaneously avoiding the anxiety associated with performance. Although it was found that defensive pessimism was positively correlated with goals related to both performance-avoidance and performance-avoidance, it was not found to be a predictor of one's mastery of goals. &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Elliot, A.J., Church, M.A. (2003). [https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7a8a/a7a6ec3688e79c203b11215ee95d9e1743d1.pdf A Motivational Analysis of Defensive Pessimism and Self-Handicapping]. ''Journal of Personality, 71''(3), 369-396.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Strategic optimism===
In research, defensive pessimism is frequently contrasted with strategic optimism, another cognitive strategy. When facing performance situations, strategic optimists feel that they will end well. Therefore, though they plan ahead, they plan only minimally because they do not have any anxiety to face. While defensive pessimists set low expectations, feel anxious, and rehearse possible negative outcomes of situations, strategic optimists set high expectations, feel calm, and do not reflect on the situation any more than absolutely necessary.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer, S.M. &amp; Norem, J.K. (1996). Reflection and distraction: Defensive pessimism, strategic optimism, and performance. ''Personal Social Psychology Bulletin, 22,'' 354–365.&lt;/ref&gt; Strategic optimists start out with different motivations and obstacles: unlike defensive pessimists, strategic optimists do not have any anxiety to surmount. In spite of their differences in motivation, strategic optimists and defensive pessimists have similar objective performance outcomes.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; For both strategic optimists and defensive pessimists, their respective cognitive strategies are adaptive and promote success.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2664">[[File:Elifbaja shqip.jpg|thumb|The new ''Elifbaja shqip'' by [[Rexhep Voka]] in 1911]]
The '''Elifba alphabet''' ({{lang-sq|Elifbaja}}, from {{lang-ota|الفبا|Elifbâ}}) was the main writing system for the [[Albanian language]] during the time of the [[Ottoman Empire]] from 14th century to 1911. This Albanian variant of the [[Abjad]] [[Ottoman Turkish alphabet|Ottoman-Persian script]] was used to write the Albanian language. The last version of the ''Elifbaja shqip'' was invented by the leader of the [[Albanian National Awakening]], Moslem scholar [[Rexhep Voka]] (1847-1917).

The [[Ottoman Turkish alphabet]] was mainly favored by [[Albanian people|Albanian]] [[Muslims]], but also used by some [[Christians]]. After being especially used during the [[Bejte]] poetry, a [[Primer (textbook)|primer]] for the Albanian language in [[Arabic script]] was published in 1861 in [[Constantinople]] by [[Daut Boriçi|Mullah Daut Boriçi]], the leader of the [[League of Prizren]].&lt;ref name="Norris"&gt;{{citation| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RGmzir-ITtUC&amp;pg=PA76&amp;dq=Daut+Bori%C3%A7i&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwBWoVChMIwtachLbDyAIVhG4-Ch10UwDg#v=onepage&amp;q=Daut%20Bori%C3%A7i&amp;f=false| title=Islam in the Balkans: Religion and Society Between Europe and the Arab World|author=H. T. Norris| page=76|year=1993| publisher=University of South Carolina Press| isbn=9780872499775}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1909 and 1910 there were movements by Young Turks supporters to adopt an [[Arabic alphabet]], as they considered the Latin script to be [[Islamization of Albania|un-Islamic]]. In [[Elbasan]], Muslim clerics led a demonstration for the Arabic script, telling their congregations that using the Latin script would make them infidels. In 1911, the Young Turks dropped their opposition to the Latin script, and the [[Latin alphabet]] was invented. In order to eliminate ambiguity in the pronunciation of the Arabic script, [[Rexhep Voka]] developed a customized Arabic alphabet consisting of 44 consonants and vowels, which he published in 1911. However, it was hardly used anymore due to the [[Congress of Monastir]]. Tiranli Fazli then used this script to publish a thirty-two page grammar. Only one Albanian newspaper at the time ever appeared in Arabic script, and it lasted a brief period. Regardless of what script appeared, such material raised Albanian national consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Elsie: ''The Currents of Moslem and Bektash Writing in Albania (1850–1950).''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3542">'''Fassinger's model of gay and lesbian identity development''' is an attempt to model [[Sexual identity|gay and lesbian identity]] development, taking into account cultural and contextual influences. First presented by Ruth E. Fassinger in 1996 as a model of [[lesbian]] identity development, it was validated for men the following year.

== Research ==
In 1991, Susan R. McCarn, a colleague of Fassinger's, studied [[Identity (social science)|identity development]] among a group of thirty-eight lesbians diversifying in age, education, race, ethnicity, and occupation.&lt;ref name=original&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCarn|first=S. R.|title=Validation of a model of sexual minority (lesbian) identity development|journal=Unpublished master's thesis.|year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; The analysis of the results of this study lead to the establishment of two processes and four phases, in 1996.&lt;ref name=processes&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fassinger|first=R. E.|author2=McCarn, S. R.|title=Revisioning sexual minority identity formation: A new model of lesbian identity and its implications for counseling and research|journal=Counseling Psychologist|volume=24|pages=508–534|url=http://www.uk.sagepub.com/thomas2e/study/articles/section6/Article107.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, Fassinger and Brett A. Miller explored a similarly diverse group of gay men, validating the theory for men.&lt;ref name=validation&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fassinger|first=R. E.|author2=McCarn, S. R.|title=Validation of an inclusive model of homosexual identity formation in a sample of gay men|journal=Journal of Homosexuality|year=1997|volume=32|issue=2|pages=53–78|doi=10.1300/j082v32n02_04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theory ==
Fassinger proposed two processes of identity development: Individual sexual identity relating to one's internal awareness and acceptance of self, and group membership identity relating to one's role in the gay/lesbian community.&lt;ref name=difference&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fassinger|first=R. E.|title=Lesbian, gay, and bisexual identity and student development theory|journal=Working with lesbian, gay bisexual, and transgender college students: A handbook for faculty and administrators|year=1998|pages=13–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Both processes consist of four sequential phases, in which an individual can reside in a different phase for each process:
# Awareness: perceiving oneself as different from other people
# Exploration: investigating feelings of attraction for individuals of the same sex
# Deepening/Commitment: internalizing the sense of self as a gay or lesbian person
# Internalization/Synthesis: incorporating one's sexual identity into one's overall identity

Individuals can repeat phases as new environmental contexts occur, and development in one process can influence development in the other.

For the group membership identity process, Fassinger offers specific markers for the demonstration of each phase:
# Awareness of the existence of people with different sexual orientations
# Exploration of one's relationship to the gay and/or lesbian community
# Commitment to the gay and lesbian community, including an acceptance of the potentially negative consequences
# Internalizing the minority group identity across contexts

'''Final Utility''' is the [[utility]] of a [[good (economics)|good]] when applied to our least desirable use of it. It is the estimated utility of the last use of a supply, i.e., the least important use of that supply. For example, if a ''use'' of a good must be given up, it will logically be the ''last'' use of the good we would choose. This is because we give up the least important of our satisfactions first—which would be the uses satisfied by the last good since we satisfy our more important needs first.

For example, if we lost a unit of a good, the ''[[value (economics)|value]]'' of the loss would be the value of the least important use of the good. This last good, which represents its final utility, was being applied to our least important wants. In the case of the lost good, it is replaced and the value to which we can assign the loss is not the value of the first most important use of the good, but the least important—what we call the final utility.&lt;ref&gt;[[Böhm-Bawerk]], Eugen von. "The Law of Final Utility - Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk - Mises Daily ." The Ludwig von Mises Institute . http://mises.org/daily/4637 (accessed April 29, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the law of [[marginal utility]], the value of each good in a stock of identical goods is [[utility]] of the last and most easily dispensable unit.&lt;ref&gt;von Böhm-Bawerk, Eugen, trans. George Reisman. "Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk’s “Value, Cost, and Marginal Utility”." Ludwig von Mises Institute. mises.org/pdf/asc/2002/asc8-reisman.pdf (accessed April 30, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; That is why price is said to be determined by supply and demand: the price reflects the (approximate and average) value of the good, but most closely reflects the value of the last use. If there is a shortage of supply, the good will cease being applied to its least important uses. All else being equal, the price will increase and the increase in price represents, so to speak, the value we attribute to the ''new'' last use. Before, with a larger supply, the last use was of less value to us. With a smaller supply the value of the last use is necessarily more important because we always satisfy our more important wants first. Therefore, the increase in price can be seen as a reflection of the increase in value we attribute to the last use of the supply.

[[Ludwig von Mises]] writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"When face with the problem of the value to be attached to one unit of a homogeneous supply, man decides on the basis of the value of the least important use he makes of the units of the whole supply; he decides on the basis of marginal utility."&lt;ref name="humanaction_ch7sec1"&gt;[[Ludwig von Mises]]. [http://mises.org/humanaction/chap7sec1.asp VII. Action Within The World], 1. The Law of Marginal Utility, ''[[Human Action]]'', online version, referenced 2011-04-30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Example==

If a hurricane struck Florida and there was a shortage of water, everything else equal, the [[price]] of bottled water would increase. Water in Florida, before this [[shortage]], was used for drinking water, cooking, watering plants, and bathing. With the tap off, the price of bottled water has increased to such an extent that bottled water will surely not be purchased for watering plants or bathing. That is, the increase in price reflects the increase in the value we attribute to the last use of the last unit in the [[supply (economics)|supply]] of the [[good (economics)|good]]. To explain, before the hurricane, water was valued according to the fact that it would be used for bathing and watering plants. Now, with a shortage, it is valued according to its ability to quench thirst and cook food. The latter uses importance is "approximated" in the price of the good. The bottled water which now costs, say, $20 a bottle, is an approximation of the [[value (economics)|value]] attribute to drinking water, cooking water, and whatever else it might be used for at the higher price—given that previous uses are not considered due to the shortage of supply and its corollary, the increase in price. That is why it is said that a homogeneous stock of goods is valued according to its final utility—according to its last use of a stock of a good.

A supply of a good will be applied to most important wants first and least important wants last. When there is a shortage, all else being equal, the price increases. The smaller supply is being used for the most important wants, but is not being used for the least important wants. In this sense, we can say the increase in price represents the increase in value which the last unit of the supply is filling. Before water cost very little and was used for washing and watering plants. Now, since there is not enough for washing and watering plants and it is instead being used exclusively to drink and cook—the value we attribute to those activities is, in a sense, communicated through the higher price. The price reflects that importance of the last use of a supply—and in this case the supply was truncated to only allow for the more important uses.

Final utility is the logical conclusion of [[marginal utility]] and a corner stone of [[price]] theory.

'''Geltungsjude''' was the term for people who were considered [[Jews]] by the first supplementary decree to the [[Nuremberg Laws]] from 14 November 1935. The term wasn't used officially, but was coined because the persons were deemed (''gelten'' in [[German language|German]]) Jews rather than exactly belonging to any of the categories of the previous Nuremberg Laws. There were three categories of Geltungsjuden: 1. offspring of an intermarriage who belonged to the Jewish community after 1935; 2. offspring of an intermarriage who was married to a Jew after 1935; 3. illegitimate child of a Geltungsjude, born after 1935.

==Definition==
The definition of these persons in the decree is as follows:
:''ARTICLE 5  (2)  A Jew is also an individual'' [jüdischer Mischling] ''who is descended from two full-Jewish grandparents if:''
::''(a)  he was a member of the Jewish religious community when this law was issued, or joined the community later;''
::''(b)  when the law was issued, he was married to a person who was a Jew, or was subsequently married to a Jew;''
::''(c)  he is the issue from a marriage with a Jew, in the sense of Section I, which was contracted after the coming into effect of the [[Nuremberg Laws|Law for the Protection of German Blood and Honor of 15 September 1935]];''
::''(d)  he is the issue of an extramarital relationship with a Jew, in the sense of Section I, and was born out of wedlock after 31 July 1936.''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mtsu.edu/~baustin/nurmlaw2.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Each of these is ''considered'' a Jew, hence the name ''Geltungsjude''. The term ''jüdischer [[Mischling]]'' in the first sentence means ''Jewish half-breed''. A person with two Jewish grandparents who satisfied none of the criteria (a) through (d) was not considered a "Geltungsjude" but a [[Mischling|Mischling of the First Degree]]. (See also the article on the [[Mischling test]].)

==Consequences==
''Geltungsjuden'' were not citizens of the [[Nazi Germany|Reich]] anymore and did not have the right to vote. They were also prohibited to marry a ''quarter Jew''. In the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia|Protectorate]], they were routinely deported. They were sometimes deported from the "Old Reich" (Altreich), and only very rarely from Austria{{cn|date=March 2017}}.

In contrast, while Mischlinge of the First Degree within the Old Reich were subject to various forms of discrimination, they were at least in principle exempt from deportation. Their status as "provisional citizens" was subject of an intra-regime tug-of-war between maximalists like [[Heydrich]] (who wanted them treated like Jews) and minimalists who pleaded against "throwing  out the Aryan with the Jewish blood" (such as [[Wilhelm Stuckart]] and his assistant [[Hans Globke]]).

'''High society''', also called in some contexts simply "society", is the behavior and lifestyle of people with the highest levels of wealth and [[social status]]. It includes their related affiliations, [[social event]]s and practices.&lt;ref&gt;Foulkes, Nick. ''High Society: The History of America's Upper Class'' . Assouline, 2008. {{ISBN|2759402886}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nancy W. Ellenberger, "The Transformation of London 'Society' at the End of Victoria's Reign: Evidence from the Court Presentation Records." ''Albion'' 22.04 (1990): 633-653.&lt;/ref&gt; Upscale [[social club]]s were open to men based on assessments of their ranking and role within high society.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara J. Black, "The Pleasure of Your Company in Late‐Victorian Clubland." ''Nineteenth‐Century Contexts'' 32#4 (2010): 281-304.&lt;/ref&gt;  In American high society, the ''[[Social Register]]'' was traditionally a key resource for identifying qualified members. From a global perspective, see [[upper class]]. The quality of housing, clothing, servants and dining were visible marks of membership.&lt;ref&gt;Yuri Lotman, '' High Society Dinners: Dining in Tsarist Russia.'' (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

==19th century==
The term became common in the late 19th century, especially when the newly arrived rich in key cities such as [[New York City]], [[Boston]], and [[Newport, Rhode Island]], built great mansions and sponsored highly publicized parties.&lt;ref&gt;Wayne Craven, ''Gilded Mansions: Grand Architecture and High Society'' (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; The media lavished attention on them, especially when newspapers devoted whole sections to weddings, funerals, parties and other events sponsored by the local high society. In major cities, a [[Social Register]] was published that listed the names and addresses of people who properly belonged. Informal identifiers appeared, such as the [[Upper ten thousand|"upper tens"]] in mid-19th century New York City, or "the 400," [[Ward McAllister]]'s late 19th-century term for the number of people [[Caroline Webster Schermerhorn Astor|Mrs. William Backhouse Astor, Jr's]] ballroom could supposedly accommodate,&lt;ref&gt;Mooney, James E. "Astor [née Schermerhorn] Caroline (Webster)" in {{cite enc-nyc2}}, p.72&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite gotham}}, pp.962-963&lt;/ref&gt; although the actual number was 273.&lt;ref&gt;Mooney, James E. "Society" in {{cite enc-nyc2}}, pp.1199-1201&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Debutante]]s are young female members of high society being officially presented for the first time, at [[debutante ball]]s or [[cotillion]]s. An example of a high society debutante ball is the prestigious [[International Debutante Ball]] at the [[Waldorf Astoria New York|Waldorf Astoria Hotel]] in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Columbia|first1=David Patrick|title=Women of Distinction|url=http://www.newyorksocialdiary.com/party-pictures/2013/women-of-distinction|publisher=NYSD|accessdate=30 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Litovsky|first1=Dina|title=Society Swans: Scenes From the 60th Annual International Debutante Ball|url=https://www.thecut.com/2015/01/scenes-from-the-international-debutante-ball.html|publisher=The Cut/New York Magazine|accessdate=29 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Effron|first1=Lauren|title=What It Takes to Be a High-Society Debutante|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/takes-high-society-debutante/story?id=28553448|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=29 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gold and silver mining, in the mid 19th century brought enormous wealth overnight to certain small towns such as [[Central City, Colorado]] and [[Leadville, Colorado]]. The new rich typically build a lavish opera house in the mining town, but then moved to a major city, especially Denver or San Francisco, where their wealth could be more suitably displayed and enjoyed.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas J. Noel, "Colorado's Rush to Culture A Gold Rush Legacy." ''Journal of the West'' 49#2 (2010): 41-49.&lt;/ref&gt;   When the men attended to business affairs, women generally took charge of comings and goings and doings in high society.&lt;ref&gt;Newport Historical Society Staff, "The Business Of Leisure: The Gilded Age In Newport," ''Newport History'' (1989) 62#3 pp 97-126.&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting with the Stuyvesant luxury apartment house that opened in 1869, and [[The Dakota]] in 1884, affluent New Yorkers discovered the advantages of apartment living, where a full-time staff handled the upkeep and maintenance, as well as security.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Birmingham, ''Life at the Dakota'' (1979)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Alpern, ''New York's Fabulous Luxury Apartments: With Original Floor Plans from the Dakota, River House, Olympic Tower and Other Great Buildings'' (1987) covers 75 famous buildings starting in 1869.&lt;/ref&gt;

In most French cities the very rich, often holding an old aristocratic title, maintained an elaborate high society well into the 20th century. Ten to twenty servants demonstrated the taste for conspicuous consumption. The richest households in Paris typically employed 30 servants.  After 1945 the supply of servants dried up and there was a move to smaller inner city apartments in elite neighborhoods.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth C. Macknight, "A ‘theatre of rule’?

== Art ==
[[File:Mrs William Astor (Caroline Webster Schermerhorn), by Carolus-Duran.jpg|thumb|336x336px|Mrs. William Astor painted by Carolus-Duran in 1890, presented at the 1894 Great Portrait Exhibition]]
Art in this time was almost exclusively linked to the possession of money. The art of high society focused greatly on absorbing cultures from around the world, and referencing great architecture from the past, and commissioning artists that were from Europe. The culture was to possess knowledge and artifacts from other cultures or at least replicated it very well.

Acquiring rare and valuable items was another way of high society representing its prestige. Art was also a way of representing taste level and someones ability to commission the right artist or chose the best piece to have installed in their homes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=High Society. American Portraits of the Gilded Age|last=Gallat|first=Barbara Dayer|publisher=Bucerius Kunst Forum. Distributed by Merrell|year=2008|isbn=978-3777445458|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Portraiture ===
Portrait painters were in high demand in London.  Meanwhile, the smaller corps of American artists shifted their focus from painting the great landscapes of America to making portraits of great Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Meaghan Clarke, "(Re) Viewing Whistler and Sargent: portraiture at the fin-de-siècle." ''RACAR: revue d'art canadienne/Canadian Art Review'' (2005): 74-86.&lt;/ref&gt;  However art historians generally ignored the society artists such as [[John Singer Sargent]] (1856 – 1925) until the late 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Franz Schulze, "J. S. Sargent, Partly Great." ''Art in America'' (1980) 68#2 pp 90-96&lt;/ref&gt;

Portraiture became the most common art in order for people in high society to record and have evidence of their accomplishment and valuable possessions.
[[File:Sargent Portrait of Lady Helen Vincent 1904.jpg|thumb|left| "Portrait of Lady Helen Vincent" by J.S. Sargent, 1904]] 


New York City started its ''Great Portrait Exhibition'', focused on high society. The exhibition became a place for people to see Who's Who in New York City high society and focused more on the names of the people in the portraits rather than the quality of the portraits. The art community focused on portraiture, and changed art into a circle that created a tight knit between, patronage, artist, and critiques.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Architecture ===
[[Stanford White]] (1853-1906) was the most influential architect for High Society.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; High Society was also immortalized through the building of mansions glittered in decadence and detail that were reminiscent of the renaissance, and the Victorian gothic. These massive homes were visible in dense cities like New York, they sprinkled main avenues that belonged to the wealth or middle class and stayed clear of the poor areas that were dense and littered with filth and the poor working class. [[Richard Morris Hunt]] played a large role in giving many members of High Society what they were looking for: homes that represented their cosmopolitan outlook and outshine all that was around it.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For more on the homes of this time era see [[List of Gilded Age mansions]].

==Sociology==
Members of high society depend greatly on the people and social circles they are surrounded by. In many cases an elite member can confirm status by having, servants, people who remove a task from everyday life, or artists and performers, who they can use their talent and skills at their disposal.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

Social groups play the most important role in establishing members of high society. Members of high society usually must attend social gatherings throughout the year while also putting together social gatherings in their own homes. The sociological distinction is the use of [[social capital]] in order to attend or be invited to certain events. Members of high society tend to be aware of the connections that should be made in order to move up the social ladder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Sociology of Elite Distinction|last=Daloz|first=Jean-Pascal|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK|year=2010|isbn=978-0-230-24683-6|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent decades==
High society is less visible in the 21st century—privacy is much more valued, and the very expensive housing is not as conspicuous to ordinary pedestrians as the famous old mansions. There are far fewer servants, but much more attention to security. Remote ski resorts in places like Vail and Aspen are especially popular with high society.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Duke Richey, ''Living it Up in Aspen: Post-war America, Ski Town Culture, and the New Western Dream, 1945--1975'' (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;  The quality of housing remains important. Moneyed society in New York City looks for apartments that are:

&lt;blockquote&gt;near good schools, restaurants, museums, and all the city offers, they offer privacy, security, and stately architecture, with an almost obsessive attention to detail in the woodwork, fine wood floors, moldings, brass door handles, and many other handcrafted features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Geoffrey Lynch|title=Manhattan Classic: New York's Finest Prewar Apartments|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TJauAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA10|year=2014|publisher=Princeton Architectural Press|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Philanthropy is a high-prestige activity in high society. As in the case of one prominent heiress, her "millions often went to supporting institutions geared toward improving life for less-fortunate New Yorkers—libraries, universities, hospitals, public gardens and conservation groups among them."&lt;ref&gt;Susman, Tina. [http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-brooke-astor16-2009sep16,0,4530218.story "Trial shines a spotlight on New York's high society"], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' (September 16, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;  Sociologist Francie Ostrower states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The wealthy take philanthropy and adapt it into an entire way of life that serves as a vehicle for the social and cultural life of their class. This is reflected in the widespread popularity of educational and cultural causes among donors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Francie Ostrower|title=Why the Wealthy Give: The Culture of Elite Philanthropy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eGzgvm_hCbIC|year=1997|publisher=Princeton UP}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An '''honesty box''' is a method of charging for a service such as admission or car parking, or for a product such as home-grown produce and flowers, which relies upon each visitor paying at a box using the [[honour system]]. Tickets are not issued and such sites are usually unattended. When used in [[camping sites]] and other [[park]] settings, they are sometimes referred to as an '''iron ranger''' as there is often an iron cash box instead of an actual [[park ranger]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.homernews.com/stories/101508/arts_14_001.shtml Don Henry's prolific metal sculpture abounds in Homer 'Divas and Dolls'  ''Michael Armstrong, Homer News, 10-15-08'']&lt;/ref&gt; Some stores also use them for selling newspapers to avoid queues at a [[cash register|till]].&lt;ref name=Times&gt;{{cite journal

Such boxes are typically used in [[rural]] areas where the low number of customers and other visitors, along with the low quantity and/or value of the products on offer, means that an attendant would not bring a positive return on investment.&lt;ref name=Times/&gt; Many are also domestically run operations where attendance is not feasible.

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 147-0510, Berlin, Lustgarten, Kundgebung der HJ.jpg|thumb|Hitler Youth members performing the Nazi salute at a rally at the [[Lustgarten]] in Berlin, 1933]]

'''Indoctrination''' is the process of [[wikt:inculcate|inculcating]] a person with [[idea]]s, [[attitude (psychology)|attitudes]], [[cognition|cognitive strategies]] or professional [[methodology|methodologies]] (see [[doctrine]]).&lt;ref&gt;Funk and Wagnalls: "To instruct in doctrines; esp., to teach partisan or sectarian dogmas"; I.A. Snook, ed. 1972. ''Concepts of Indoctrination'' (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul).&lt;/ref&gt; [[human|Humans]] are a social animal inescapably shaped by [[culture|cultural]] context, and thus some degree of indoctrination is implicit in the parent–child relationship, and has an essential function in forming stable communities of shared values. 

In the political context, indoctrination is often analyzed as a tool of [[class conflict|class warfare]], where institutions of the state are identified as "conspiring" to maintain the status quo. Specifically the public educational system, the police, and mental health establishment are a commonly cited ''modus operandi'' of public pacification. In the extreme, an entire state can be implicated. [[George Orwell]]'s book ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' famously singled out explicit, state-mandated [[propaganda]] initiatives of [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] regimes. Opinions differ on whether other forms of government are less doctrinaire, or merely achieve the same ends through less obvious methods. 

The precise boundary between education and indoctrination often lies in the eye of the beholder. Some distinguish indoctrination from education on the basis that the indoctrinated person is expected not to question or [[critical thinking|critically examine]] the doctrine they have learned.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, J., 1964. "Education and indoctrination", in T.H.B. Hollins, ed. ''Aims in Education: the philosophic approach'' (Manchester University Press).&lt;/ref&gt; As such the term may be used [[pejorative]]ly or as a [[buzz word]], often in the context of [[political opinion]]s, [[theology]], religious [[dogma]] or [[antireligion|anti-religious]] convictions. 

The term is closely linked to [[socialization]]; however, in common discourse, ''indoctrination'' is often associated with negative [[connotation]]s, while ''socialization'' functions as a generic descriptor conveying no specific value or connotation (some choosing to hear socialization as an inherently positive and necessary contribution to social order, others choosing to hear socialization as primarily an instrument of social [[oppression]]). Matters of doctrine (and indoctrination) have been contentious and divisive in human society dating back to antiquity. The expression attributed to [[Titus Lucretius Carus]] in the first century BCE ''quod ali cibus est aliis fuat acre venenum'' (what is food to one, is to others bitter poison) remains pertinent.

==Religious==
Religious indoctrination, the original sense of ''indoctrination'', refers to a process of imparting [[doctrine]] in an authoritative way, as in [[catechism]]. Most religious groups among the [[revealed religion]]s instruct new members in the principles of the religion; this is now not usually referred to as ''indoctrination'' by the religions themselves, in part because of the negative connotations the word has acquired. [[Mystery religion]]s require a period of indoctrination before granting access to [[esoteric]] knowledge. (cf. [[Information security]])

As a pejorative term, ''indoctrination'' implies forcibly or coercively causing people to act and think on the basis of a certain [[ideology]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[OED]], ''indoctrination''.&lt;/ref&gt; Some secular critics believe that all religions indoctrinate their adherents, as children, and the accusation is made in the case of [[religious extremism]].&lt;ref name="Harris (2011)"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harris|first1=Sam|title=The moral landscape|date=2011|publisher=Simon and Schuster.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sects such as [[Scientology]] use personality tests and peer pressures to indoctrinate new members.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Scientology beliefs and practices]].&lt;/ref&gt; Some religions have commitment ceremonies for children 13 years and younger, such as [[Bar Mitzvah]], [[Confirmation]], and [[Shichi-Go-San]]. In Buddhism, [[temple boy]]s are encouraged to follow the faith while young.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} Critics of religion, such as [[Richard Dawkins]], maintain that the children of religious parents are often unfairly indoctrinated.&lt;ref&gt;Dawkins, Richard. ''The God Delusion''. New York: Bantam Books, 2006. pp. 25, 28, 206, 367.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, indoctrination can occur, and often does occur with great frequency, in non-religious contexts. For example, in the 20th century, the former [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania]] and the former [[USSR]] instituted programs of government-sponsored atheistic indoctrination in order to promote [[state atheism]], specifically [[Marxist–Leninist atheism]], within their citizenry.&lt;ref name="Jacques1995"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jacques|first1=Edwin E.|title=The Albanians: An Ethnic History from Prehistoric Times to the Present|date=1995|publisher=McFarland|page=447|isbn=0899509320|quote=This Marxist-Leninist class revolution, therefore, demanded an atheistic indoctrination of the working masses and the elimination of all religious convictions.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Franzmann2006"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Franzmann|first1=Manuel|title=Religiosität in der säkularisierten Welt|date=2006|publisher=Springer-Verlag|page=89|quote=However, another conspicuous result of our comparison is that some Eastern European countries, in spite of decades of atheist indoctrination, have a considerable percentage of believers in God - Albania for instance, whose Communist rulers once claimed it was the world's first totally atheist country, or Russia, where the percentage of believers surged in the late eighties and rose dramatically once again in the course of the nineties.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sabrina P. Ramet]], a professor of political science, documented that "from kindergarten onward children [were] indoctrinated with an aggressive form of atheism" and "to denounce parents who follow religious practices at home."&lt;ref name=Ramet1990&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ramet|first1=Sabrina P.|authorlink=Sabrina P. Ramet|title=Catholicism and Politics in Communist Societies|date=1990|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=0822310473|pages=232–33|quote=From kindergarten onward children are indoctrinated with an aggressive form of atheism and trained to hate and distrust foreigners and to denounce parents who follow religious practices at home.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after the death of Albania's leader, [[Enver Hoxha]] in 1985, his successor, [[Ramiz Alia]], adopted a relatively tolerant stance toward religious practice, referring to it as "a personal and family matter." Émigré clergymen were permitted to reenter the country in 1988 and officiate at religious services. [[Mother Teresa]], an ethnic Albanian, visited Tirana in 1989, where she was received by the foreign minister and by Hoxha's widow. In December 1990, the ban on religious observance was officially lifted, in time to allow thousands of Christians to attend Christmas services (see [[Freedom of religion in Albania]]).

Similarly, in the former Soviet Union, "science education [in] Soviet schools [was] used as a vehicle for atheistic indoctrination", with teachers being instructed to prepare their course "so as to conduct anti-religious educations at all times," in order to comport with state-sanctioned Marxist–Leninist values.&lt;ref name="Witt1961"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Witt|first1=Nicholas De|title=Education and Professional Employment in the U.S.S.R.|date=1961|publisher=National Academies|page=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1997, several years after the fall of the Soviet Union, the Russian government passed a law recognizing [[Religion in Russia|religion as being important to Russian history]] with [[Orthodox Christianity]] ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Православие Pravoslaviye), Russia's traditional and largest religion, declared a part of Russia's "historical heritage."

==Military==
{{main|Recruit training}}
The initial psychological preparation of soldiers during training is referred to (non-pejoratively) as indoctrination.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

==Information security==
In the field of [[information security]], indoctrination is the initial briefing and instructions given before a person is granted access to [[Classified information|secret information]].&lt;ref&gt;The [[National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual]] defines indoctrination as "the initial security instructions/briefing given a person prior to granting access to classified information."&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jainism''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|dʒ|eɪ|n|ɪ|z|əm}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title="Jainism" (ODE)|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/Jainism|website=Oxford Dictionaries}}&lt;/ref&gt; traditionally known as '''''Jain Dharma''''',{{sfn|Sangave|2006|p=15}} is an ancient [[Indian religions|Indian religion]].{{sfn|Sangave|2001|p=185, Quote: "Jainism is an ancient Indian religion and from ancient times to the present day, it has continued to flourish, along with other religions, in different parts of India".}} Followers of Jainism are called "Jains", a word derived from the Sanskrit word ''[[Arihant (Jainism)|jina]]'' (victor) and connoting the path of victory in crossing over life's stream of rebirths through an ethical and spiritual life&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/topic/Tirthankara Tirthankara: Jainism], Encyclopedia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt; Jains trace their history through a succession of twenty-four victorious saviours and teachers known as ''[[tirthankara]]s'', with the first being [[Rishabhanatha]], who according to Jain tradition lived millions of years ago, and twenty-fourth being the [[Mahāvīra]] around 500 BCE. Jains believe that Jainism is an eternal ''[[Dharma (Jainism)|dharma]]'' with the ''tirthankaras'' guiding every cycle of the [[Jain cosmology]].

The main religious premises of Jainism are ''[[Ahimsa in Jainism|ahiṃsā]]'' ("non-violence"), ''[[Anekantavada|anekāntavāda]]'' ("many-sidedness"), ''[[aparigraha]]'' ("non-attachment") and ''[[asceticism]]''. Devout Jains take five main vows: ''[[Ahimsa|ahiṃsā]]'' ("non-violence"), ''[[satya]]'' ("truth"), ''[[asteya]]'' ("not stealing"), ''[[brahmacharya]]'' ("celibacy or chastity"), and ''[[aparigraha]]'' ("non-attachment"). These principles have impacted Jain culture in many ways, such as leading to a predominantly vegetarian lifestyle that avoids harm to animals and their life cycles. ''[[Parasparopagraho Jivanam|Parasparopagraho Jīvānām]]'' ("the function of souls is to help one another") is the motto of Jainism. ''[[Namokar Mantra|Ṇamōkāra mantra]]'' is the most common and basic prayer in Jainism.{{sfn|Voorst|2015|p=107}}

Jainism has two major ancient sub-traditions, [[Digambara]]s and [[Śvētāmbara]]s; and several smaller sub-traditions that emerged in the 2nd millennium CE. The Digambaras and Śvētāmbaras have different views on ascetic practices, gender and which Jain texts can be considered canonical. [[Jain monasticism|Jain mendicants]] are found in all Jain sub-traditions, with [[Laity|laypersons]] (''[[Śrāvaka (Jainism)|śrāvakas]]'') supporting the mendicants' spiritual pursuits with resources.

Jainism has between four and five million followers, with most Jains residing in [[Jainism in India|India]].{{sfn|Melton|Baumann|2010|p=lix, 1395}} Outside India, some of the largest Jain communities are present in [[Jainism in Canada|Canada]], [[Jainism in Europe|Europe]], [[Jainism in Africa|Kenya]], the [[Jainism in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]], [[Jainism in Hong Kong|Hong Kong]], [[Suriname]], [[Fiji]], and the [[Jainism in the United States|United States]]. Major Jain festivals include [[Paryushana]] and Daslakshana, [[Mahavir Jayanti]], and [[Diwali (Jainism)|Diwali]].

==Main principles==
===Non-violence (''ahimsa'')===
{{anchor|ahiṃsā}}{{Main|Ahimsa in Jainism}}
[[File:Ahinsa Parmo Dharm.jpg|thumb|Painting with the message ''Ahiṃsā Paramo [[Dharma (Jainism)|Dharma]]'' ("non-violence is the highest virtue or religion")]]

[[File:Ahimsa.svg|thumb|The hand with a wheel on the palm symbolizes [[Ahimsa in Jainism|''Ahiṃsā'' in Jainism]]. The word in the middle is ''ahiṃsā''. The wheel represents the ''[[dharmachakra]]'', which stands for the resolve to halt the ''saṃsāra'' ('transmigration') through relentless pursuit of truth and non-violence.]]

The principle of ''[[Ahimsa in Jainism|ahimsa]]'' ("non-violence" or "non-injury") is a fundamental tenet of Jainism.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=160}} It believes that one must abandon all violent activity, and without such a commitment to non-violence all religious behavior is worthless.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=160}} In Jain theology, it does not matter how correct or defensible the violence may be, one must not kill any being, and "non-violence is one's highest religious duty".{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=160}}{{sfn|Markham|Lohr|2009|p=71}}

Jain texts such as ''[[Acharanga Sutra|Acaranga Sūtra]]'' and ''[[Tattvartha Sutra|Tattvarthasūtra]]'' state that one must renounce all killing of living beings, whether tiny or large, movable or immovable.{{sfn|Price|2010|p=90}}{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=160-162}} Its theology teaches that one must neither kill another living being, nor cause another to kill, nor consent to any killing directly or indirectly.{{sfn|Price|2010|p=90}}{{sfn|Markham|Lohr|2009|p=71}} Furthermore, Jainism emphasizes non-violence against all beings not only in action but also in speech and in thought.{{sfn|Price|2010|p=90}}{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=160-162}} It states that instead of hate or violence against anyone, "all living creatures must help each other".{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=160-162}}{{refn|group=note|This view, however, is not shared by all Jain sub-traditions. For example, the Terapanthi Jain tradition, with about 250,000 followers, considers both good karma such as compassionate charity, and bad karma such as sin, as binding one's soul to worldly morality. It states that any karma leads to a negation of the "absolute non-violence" principle, given man's limited perspective. It recommends that the monk or nun seeking salvation must avoid hurting or helping any being in any form.{{sfn|Flügel|2002|pp=1266-1267}}}} Violence negatively affects and destroys one's soul, particularly when the violence is done with intent, hate or carelessness, or when one indirectly causes or consents to the killing of a human or non-human living being.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=160-162}}

The idea of reverence for non-violence (''ahiṃsā'') is founded in Hindu and Buddhist canonical texts, and it may have origins in more ancient [[Historical Vedic religion|Brahmanical]] Vedic thoughts.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=160}}&lt;ref&gt;John Arapura in K. R. Sundararajan and Bithika Mukerji Ed. (1997), Hindu spirituality: Postclassical and modern, {{ISBN|978-81-208-1937-5}}; Chapter 20, pages 392–417&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A Izawa (2008), Empathy for Pain in Vedic Ritual, Journal of the International College for Advanced Buddhist Studies, Kokusai Bukkyōgaku Daigakuin Daigaku, Vol. 12, pages 78-81&lt;/ref&gt; However, no other Indian religion has developed the non-violence doctrine and its implications on everyday life as has Jainism.{{sfn|Sethia|2004|p=2}}{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=176–177}}{{sfn|Winternitz|1993|pp=408–409}}

The theological basis of non-violence as the highest religious duty has been interpreted by some Jain scholars not to "be driven by merit from giving or compassion to other creatures, nor a duty to rescue all creatures", but resulting from "continual self-discipline", a cleansing of the soul that leads to one's own spiritual development which ultimately affects one's salvation and release from rebirths.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=88–89, 257–258}} Causing injury to any being in any form creates bad [[Karma in Jainism|karma]] which affects one's rebirth, future well being and suffering.{{sfn|Taylor|2008|pp=892–894}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= The violence of non-violence: a study of some Jain responses to non-Jain religious practices |journal=The Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies| volume=15| year= 1992| number = 1|author=Phyllis Granoff|url= https://journals.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/jiabs/article/viewFile/8791/2698}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Late medieval Jain scholars re-examined the ''Ahiṃsā'' doctrine when one is faced with external threat or violence. For example, they justified violence by monks to protect nuns.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=162-163}}{{sfn|Lorenzen|1978|pp=61–75}} According to Dundas, the Jain scholar Jinadatta Suri wrote during a time of Muslim destruction of temples and persecution that "anybody engaged in a religious activity who was forced to fight and kill somebody would not lose any spiritual merit but instead attain deliverance".{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=163}} However, such examples in Jain texts that condone fighting and killing under certain circumstances are relatively rare.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=162-163}}{{refn|group=note|Jain literature, like Buddhist and Hindu literature, has also debated the aspects of violence and non-violence in food creation.{{sfn|Olson|2014|pp=1–7}}}}

===Many-sided reality (''anekāntavāda'')===
{{Main|Anekāntavāda}}
The second main principle of Jainism is ''anekāntavāda'' or ''anekantatva'',{{sfn|Charitrapragya|2004|pp=75–79}}{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=229–231}} a word derived from ''anekānta'' ("not one ended, sided", "many-sidedness" or "manifoldness") and ''vada'' ("doctrine", "way").{{sfn|Charitrapragya|2004|pp=75–79}}{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=229–231}}&lt;ref name="grimes34"&gt;Grimes, John (1996) p. 34; {{cite book|author=Philip C. Almond|title=Mystical Experience and Religious Doctrine: An Investigation of the Study of Mysticism in World Religions|url={{Google books|CBSn4dR087YC|page=|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}} |year=1982|publisher= Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-90-279-3160-3|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''anekāntavāda'' doctrine states that truth and reality is complex and always has multiple aspects. Reality can be experienced, but it is not possible to totally express it with language. Human attempts to communicate is ''Naya'', explained as "partial expression of the truth".{{sfn|Charitrapragya|2004|pp=75–79}} Language is not Truth, but a means and attempt to express Truth. From Truth, according to Mahāvīra, language returns and not the other way round.{{sfn|Charitrapragya|2004|pp=75–79}}&lt;ref name=iepmahav/&gt; One can experience the truth of a taste, but cannot fully express that taste through language. Any attempts to express the experience is ''syāt'', or valid "in some respect" but it remains a "perhaps, just one perspective, incomplete".&lt;ref name=iepmahav&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/jain/ Jain philosophy], IEP, Mark Owen Webb, Texas Tech University&lt;/ref&gt; In the same way, spiritual truths are complex, they have multiple aspects, and language cannot express their plurality, yet through effort and appropriate karma they can be experienced.{{sfn|Charitrapragya|2004|pp=75–79}} Since reality is many-sided the great error, according to Jainism, is ''ekānta'' (one-sidedness) where some relative truth is treated as an absolute truth to the exclusion of others.&lt;ref name="The Metaphysics of Paradox"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Schwartz |first1=Wm. Andrew |title=The Metaphysics of Paradox: Jainism, Absolute Relativity, and Religious Pluralism |date=2018 |publisher=Lexington Books |isbn=9781498563925 |url=https://rowman.com/ISBN/9781498563925/The-Metaphysics-of-Paradox-Jainism-Absolute-Relativity-and-Religious-Pluralism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''anekāntavāda'' premise of the Jains is ancient, as evidenced by its mention in Buddhist texts such as the ''Samaññaphala Sutta''. The Jain Agamas suggest that Mahāvīra's approach to answering all metaphysical philosophical questions was a "qualified yes" (''syāt'').{{sfn|Matilal|1990|pp=301–305}}{{sfn|Balcerowicz|2015|pp=205–218}} These texts identify ''anekāntavāda'' doctrine to be one of the key differences between the teachings of the Mahāvīra and those of the Buddha. The Buddha taught the Middle Way, rejecting extremes of the answer "it is" or "it is not" to metaphysical questions. The Mahāvīra, in contrast, taught his followers to accept both "it is", and "it is not", with "perhaps" qualification and with reconciliation to understand the Absolute Reality.{{sfn|Matilal|1998|pp=128–135}} ''Syādvāda'' (predication [[logic]]) and ''nayavāda'' (perspective [[epistemology]]) of Jainism expand on the concept of ''anekāntavāda''. ''Syādvāda'' recommends the expression of ''anekānta'' by prefixing the epithet ''syād'' to every phrase or expression describing the "permanent being".{{sfn|Koller|2000|pp=400–407}}{{sfn|Sangave|2006|p=48-51}} There is no creator God in Jainism; existence has neither beginning nor end, and the permanent being is conceptualized as ''jiva'' ("soul") and ''ajiva'' ("matter") within a dualistic ''anekāntavāda'' framework.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=90–99, 104–105, 229–233}}

According to Paul Dundas, in contemporary times the ''anekāntavāda'' doctrine has been interpreted by some Jains as intending to "promote a universal religious tolerance", and a teaching of "plurality" and "benign attitude to other [ethical, religious] positions". Dundas states this is problematic and a misreading of Jain historical texts and Mahāvīra's teachings.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=232–234}} The "many pointedness, multiple perspective" teachings of the Mahāvīra is a doctrine about the nature of [[Absolute (philosophy)|absolute reality]] and human existence, and it is sometimes called "non-absolutism" doctrine.{{sfn|Sethia|2004|pp=86-91}} However, it is not a doctrine about tolerating or condoning activities such as sacrificing or killing animals for food, nor violence against disbelievers or any other living being as "perhaps right".{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=232–234}} The five vows for Jain monks and nuns, for example, are strict requirements and there is no "perhaps" or "that is just one perspective" about them.{{sfn|Long|2009|pp=98–106}} Similarly, since ancient times, Jainism co-existed with Buddhism and Hinduism according to Dundas, but Jainism was highly critical of the knowledge systems and ideologies of its rivals, and vice versa.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=233}}

===Non-attachment (''aparigraha'')===
{{anchor|aparigraha}}{{Main|Aparigraha}}

The third main principle in Jainism is ''aparigraha'' which means non-attachment to worldly possessions.{{sfn|Natubhai Shah|2004|p=112}} For ascetics, Jainism requires a vow of complete non-possession of any property. For Jain laypersons, it recommends limited possession of property that has been honestly earned, and giving excess property to charity.{{sfn|Natubhai Shah|2004|p=112}} According to Natubhai Shah, ''aparigraha'' applies to both the material and the psychic. Material possessions refer to various forms of property. Psychic possessions refer to emotions, likes and dislikes, and attachments of any form. Unchecked attachment to possessions is said to result in direct harm to one's personality.{{sfn|Natubhai Shah|2004|pp=112-113}}

Jainism views attachments to material or emotional possessions as what leads to passions, which in turn leads to violence.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=160}} According to the ''aparigraha'' principle, a Jain monk or nun is expected to be homeless and family-less with no emotional longings or attachments.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=117, 152}} The ascetic is a wandering mendicant in the Digambara tradition, or a resident mendicant in the [[Śvētāmbara]] tradition.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=117, 152}}

In addition, Jain texts mention that "attachment to possessions" (''parigraha'') is of two kinds: attachment to internal possessions (''ābhyantara parigraha''), and attachment to external possessions (''bāhya parigraha'').{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2012|p=76}} For internal possessions, Jainism identifies four key passions of the mind (''[[Kashaya (Jainism)|kashaya]]''): anger, pride (ego), deceitfulness, and greed. In addition to the four passions of the mind, the remaining ten internal passions are: wrong belief, the three sex-passions (male sex-passion, female sex-passion, neuter sex-passion), and the six defects (laughter, like, dislike, sorrow, fear, disgust).{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2012|p=77}}{{sfn|Jaini|1998|pp=118–119}}

===Jain ethics and five vows===

[[File:Nishidhi stone with 14th century Old Kannada inscription from Tavanandi forest.JPG|''[[Doddahundi nishidhi inscription|Nishidhi stone]]'', depicting the vow of ''sallekhana'', 14th century, [[Karnataka]]|thumb]]
Jainism teaches five ethical duties, which it calls five vows. These are called ''anuvratas'' ("small vows") for Jain laypersons, and ''mahavratas'' ("great vows") for Jain mendicants.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=228–231}} For both, its moral precepts preface that the Jain has access to a ''[[guru]]'' ("teacher", "counsellor"), ''deva'' ("Jina", "god"), doctrine, and that the individual is free from five offences: doubts about the faith, indecisiveness about the truths of Jainism, sincere desire for Jain teachings, recognition of fellow Jains, and admiration for their spiritual pursuits.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|p=228}} Such a person undertakes the following Five vows of Jainism:
# ''[[Ahiṃsā]]'', "intentional non-violence" or "noninjury":{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|p=228}} The first major vow taken by Jains is to cause no harm to other human beings, as well as all living beings (particularly animals).{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|p=228}} This is the highest ethical duty in Jainism, and it applies not only to one's actions, but demands that one be non-violent in one's speech and thoughts.&lt;ref name=pkshah5v&gt;{{citation |last=Shah |first=Pravin K | title=Five Great Vows (Maha-vratas) of Jainism |url= http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~pluralsm/affiliates/jainism/jainedu/5greatvows.htm |publisher=Harvard University Literature Center |date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Vijay K.

# ''[[Brahmacharya]]'', "celibacy": Abstinence from sex and sensual pleasures is prescribed for Jain monks and nuns. For laypersons, the vow means chastity, faithfulness to one's partner.&lt;ref name=pkshah5v/&gt;{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=228–231}}
# ''[[#aparigraha|Aparigraha]]'', "non-possessiveness": This includes non-attachment to material and psychological possessions, avoiding craving and greed.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=228–231}} Jain monks and nuns completely renounce property and social relations, own nothing and are attached to no one.{{sfn|Natubhai Shah|2004|p=112}}{{sfn|Long|2009|p=109}}

==Practices==
===Asceticism===
{{Main|Asceticism}}
Of all the major Indian religions, Jainism has had the strongest austerity-driven ascetic tradition, and it is an essential part of a mendicant's spiritual pursuits.{{sfn|Cort|2001a|pp=118-122}}{{sfn|Caillat|2003b|p=113}}{{sfn|Flügel|2003|pp=169-174, 178-198 with footnotes}} Ascetic life may include nakedness symbolizing non-possession of even clothes, fasting, body mortification, penance, and other austerities, in order to burn away past karma and stop producing new karma, both of which are believed in Jainism to be essential for reaching ''siddha'' and ''moksha'' ("liberation from rebirths", and "salvation").{{sfn|Cort|2001a|pp=118-122}}{{sfn|Fujinaga|2003|pp=205-212 with footnotes}}{{sfn|Balcerowicz|2015|pp=144–150}}

Jain texts like ''Tattvartha Sūtra'' and ''Uttaradhyayana Sūtra'' discuss ascetic austerities to great lengths and formulations. Six outer and six inner practices are most common, and oft-repeated in later Jain texts.{{sfn|Cort|2001a|pp=120-121}} According to John Cort, outer austerities include complete fasting, eating limited amounts, eating restricted items, abstaining from tasty foods, mortifying the flesh, and guarding the flesh (avoiding anything that is a source of temptation).{{sfn|Cort|2001a|pp=120-122}} Inner austerities include expiation, confession, respecting and assisting mendicants, studying, meditation, and ignoring bodily wants in order to abandon the body.{{sfn|Cort|2001a|pp=120-122}}

Lists of internal and external austerities in Jainism varies with the text and tradition.{{sfn|Flügel|2003|p=182 with footnote 3}}{{sfn|Johnson|1995|pp=196–197}} Asceticism is viewed as a means to control desires, and a means to purify the ''jiva'' ("soul").{{sfn|Flügel|2003|pp=169-174, 178-198 with footnotes}} The ''tirthankaras'' of Jainism, such as the Mahāvīra (Vardhamana) set an example of leading an ascetic life by performing severe austerities for twelve years.{{sfn|Cort|2001a|pp=121-122}}&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Jain|first1=Shanti Lal|title=ABC of Jainism|year=1998|publisher=Jnanodaya Vidyapeeth |isbn=81-7628-0003|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Balcerowicz|2015|pp=15–18, 41–43}}

===Food and fasting===
{{Main|Jain vegetarianism|Fasting in Jainism}}

The practice of non-violence towards all living beings has led to Jain culture being [[Jain vegetarianism|vegetarian]]. Devout Jains practice [[lacto-vegetarianism]], that is eat no eggs, but accept dairy products if there is no violence against animals during their production. [[Veganism]] is encouraged if there are concerns about animal welfare.{{sfn|Voorst|2015|p=105}} Jain monks and nuns do not eat [[List of root vegetables|root vegetables]] such as potatoes, onions and garlic because tiny organisms are injured when the plant is pulled up, and because a bulb or tuber's ability to sprout is seen as characteristic of a higher living being.{{sfn|Sangave|1980|p=260}}{{refn|group=note|In Jainism, the ''ahiṃsā'' precept for a mendicant requires avoidance of touching or disturbing any living being including plants. It also mandates never swimming in water, nor lighting or fire or extinguish one, nor thrashing arms in the air as such actions can torment or hurt other beings that live in those states of matter.{{sfn|Taylor|2008|pp=892–894}}}}

Jains fast on different occasions throughout the year, particularly during festivals.{{sfn|Wiley|2009|p=85}} This practice is called ''upavasa'', ''tapasya'' or ''vrata''.{{sfn|Wiley|2009|pp=85-86}} According to Singh, this takes on various forms and may be practised based on one's ability.{{sfn|Ram Bhushan Prasad Singh|2008|pp=92–94}} Some examples include Digambara fasting for ''Dasa-laksana-parvan'' where a Jain layperson eats only one or two meals per day, drinking only boiled water for ten days, or fasting completely on the first and last day of the festival.{{sfn|Wiley|2009|p=72}} With these practices the layperson mimics the practices of a Jain mendicant during the festival.{{sfn|Wiley|2009|p=72}} A similar practice is found among Śvētāmbara Jains on eight day ''paryusana'' with ''samvatsari-pratikramana''.{{sfn|Wiley|2009|pp=72, 85-86}}

The fasting practice is believed to remove karma from one's soul and allow one to gain merit (''punya'').{{sfn|Wiley|2009|p=85}} A "one day" fast in Jain tradition lasts about 36 hours, starting at sunset before the day of the fast and ending 48 minutes after the sunrise the day after.{{sfn|Wiley|2009|p=85}} Among laypeople, fasting is more commonly observed by women, where it is believed that this shows her piety, religious purity, gains her and her family prestige, leads to merit earning and helps ensure future well-being for her family. Some religious fasts are observed as a group where Jain women bond socially and support each other.{{sfn|Wiley|2009|p=86}} Long fasts are celebrated by friends and families with special ceremonies.{{sfn|Wiley|2009|p=86}}

Jainism considers meditation (''dhyana'') a necessary practice, but its goals are very different from those in Buddhism and Hinduism.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=166-169}} In Jainism, meditation is concerned more with stopping karmic attachments and activity, not as a means to transformational insights or self-realization in other Indian religions.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=166-169}} Meditation in early Jain literature is a form of austerity and ascetic practice in Jainism, while in late medieval era the practice adopted ideas from other Indian traditions. According to Paul Dundas, this lack of meditative practices in early Jain texts may be because substantial portions of ancient Jain texts were lost.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=166-169}}

{{anchor|samayika}}According to [[Padmanabh Jaini]], ''[[Sāmāyika]]'' is a practice of "brief periods in meditation" in Jainism that is a part of ''siksavrata'' ("ritual restraint").{{sfn|Jaini|1998|pp=180–181}} The goal of ''Sāmāyika'' is to achieve equanimity, and it is the second ''siksavrata''.{{refn|group=note|The first is desavakasika (staying in a restrained surrounding, cutting down worldly activities). The third is ''posadhopavasa'' (fasting on the 8th and 14th days on lunar waxing and waning cycles). The fourth is ''dana'' (giving alms to Jain monks, nuns or spiritual people).{{sfn|Jaini|1998|pp=180–181}}}} The ''samayika'' ritual is practiced at least three times a day by mendicants, while a layperson includes it with other ritual practices such as ''Puja'' in a Jain temple and doing charity work.{{sfn|Jaini|1998|pp=180–182}}{{sfn|S.A. Jain|1992|p=261}}{{sfn|Natubhai Shah|2004|pp=128–131}} According to Johnson, as well as Jaini, ''samayika'' connotes more than meditation, and for a Jain householder is the voluntary ritual practice of "assuming temporary ascetic status".{{sfn|Johnson|1995|pp=189–190}}{{refn|group=note|According to Dundas, ''samayika'' seems to have meant "correct behavior" in early Jainism.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=170}}}}

The Digambara Jain scholar Kundakunda, in his ''Pravacanasara'' states that a Jain mendicant should meditate on "I, the pure self". Anyone who considers his body or possessions as "I am this, this is mine" is on the wrong road, while one who meditates, thinking the antithesis and "I am not others, they are not mine, I am one knowledge" is on the right road to meditating on the "soul, the pure self".{{sfn|Johnson|1995|pp=137–143}}{{refn|group=note|This meditative focus contrasts with the ''[[anatta]]'' focus of Buddhism, and the ''[[Atman (Hinduism)|atman]]'' focus in various ''[[vedanta]]'' schools of Hinduism such as ''[[advaita]]'' and ''[[vishistadvaita]]'' schools.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993| pp=74, 102, Part I: 1–3, 10–11, 24, Part II: 20–28}}{{sfn|Mahony|1997|pp= 171-177, 222}}}}

===Rituals and worship===
{{Main|Jain rituals}}
[[File:Shravanbelgola Gomateshvara feet prayer1.jpg|thumb|Praying at the feet of a statue of [[Bahubali]]]]

There are many rituals in Jainism's various sects. According to Dundas, the ritualistic lay path among Śvētāmbara Jains is "heavily imbued with ascetic values", where the rituals either revere or celebrate the ascetic life of Tirthankaras, or mendicants, or progressively get closer to psychologically and physically living ever more like an ascetic.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=187-189}}{{sfn|Jaini|1998|pp=162-165, 295-296}} The ultimate ritual is ''sallekhana'', a religious death through ascetic abandonment of food and drinks.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=187-189}} The Digambara Jains follow the same theme, but the details differ from Śvētāmbaras, and according to Dundas, the life cycle and religious rituals are closer to the liturgy found among Hindu traditions.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=187-189}} The overlap in Jain and Hindu rituals is largely in the life cycle (rites-of-passage) rituals, according to Padmanabh Jaini, and likely one that developed over time because Jains and Hindus societies overlapped, and rituals were viewed as necessary and secular ceremonies.{{sfn|Jaini|1998|pp=291-299}}{{sfn|Wiley|2009|pp=186-187}}

Jains do not believe in a creator god, but do ritually worship numerous deities.{{sfn|Jaini|1998|pp=162-165, 295-296}} The Jinas are prominent and a large focus of this ritualism, but they are not the only ''deva'' in Jainism. A Jina as ''deva'' is not an [[avatar]] (incarnation) in Jainism, but the highest state of omniscience that an ascetic ''tirthankara'' achieved.{{sfn|Jaini|1998|pp=295-299}} Out of the 24 Tirthankaras, Jain devotional worship is predominantly addressed to four: Mahāvīra, [[Parshvanatha]], [[Neminatha]] and [[Rishabhanatha]].{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=40}} Among the non-''tirthankara'' saints, devotional worship is common for [[Bahubali]] among the Digambaras.{{sfn|Cort|2010|pp=182-184}} Some of Jaina rituals remember the five life events of the ''tirthankaras'', called the ''[[Panch Kalyanaka]]'', are rituals such as the ''[[Panch Kalyanaka Pratishtha Mahotsava]]'', ''Panch Kalyanaka Puja'' and ''Snatrapuja''.{{sfn|Jaini|1998|pp=196, 343, 347}}{{sfn|Jaini|1998|pp=196–199}}

[[File:A Jain ritual offerings and puja recital at a temple, worship in Jainism.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|Jain worship may include ritual offerings and recitals.{{sfn|Wiley|2009|pp=45-46, 215}}]]
The basic worship ritual practised by Jains is ''darsana'' ("seeing") of ''deva'', which includes Jina,{{sfn|Lindsay Jones|2005|p=4771}} or other [[Yaksha|yaksas]], gods and goddesses such as Brahmadeva, 52 Viras, Padmavati, Ambika and 16 Vidyadevis (Sarasvati, Lakshmi, others).{{sfn|Wiley|2009|pp=33, 59, 92, 138, 191}}{{sfn|Cort|1987|pp=235–255}}{{sfn|Mishra|Ray|2016|pp=141–148}} The Terapanthi sub-tradition of Digambaras do not worship many of the deities popular among mainstream Digambaras, and they limit their ritual worship to Tirthankaras.{{sfn|Dalal|2010a|p=365}} The worship ritual is called the ''devapuja'', is found in all Jaina sub traditions, which share common features.{{sfn|Jaini|1998|pp=199–200}} Typically, the Jaina layperson enters the temple inner sanctum in simple clothing and bare feet, with a plate filled with offerings, bows down, says the [[namaskar]]a, completes his or her litany and prayers, sometimes is assisted by the temple priest, leaves the offerings and then departs.{{sfn|Jaini|1998|pp=199–200}}

Jain practices include performing ''[[abhisheka]]'' ("ceremonial bath") of the images.{{sfn|Pal|1986|p=29}} Some Jain sects employ a ''pujari'' (also called ''upadhye'') for rituals, who may be a non-Jain (a Hindu), to perform special rituals and other priestly duties at the temple.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=204-205}}{{sfn|Salvadori|1989|pp=169–170}} More elaborate worship includes ritual offerings such as rice, fresh and dry fruits, flowers, coconut, sweets, and money. Some may light up a lamp with camphor and make auspicious marks with sandalwood paste. Devotees also recite Jain texts, particularly the life stories of the tirthankaras.{{sfn|Babb|1996|pp=32–33}}{{sfn|Wiley|2009|pp=45-46, 215}}

The traditional Jains, like Buddhists and Hindus, believe in the efficacy of [[mantra]]s and that certain sounds and words are inherently auspicious, powerful and spiritual.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=81-82}}&lt;ref name="Nayanar 2005b, p.35 Gāthā 1.29"&gt;Nayanar (2005b), p.{{nbsp}}35 Gāthā 1.29&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous of the mantras, broadly accepted in various sects of Jainism, is the "five homage" (''[[Namokar Mantra|panca namaskara]]'') mantra which is believed to be eternal and existent since the first ford-maker's time.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=81-82}} The medieval era Jain worship practices, according to Ellen Gough, also developed tantric diagrams of the ''Rishi-mandala'' where the ''tirthankaras'' are portrayed.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Gough (2012), Shades of Enlightenment: A Jain Tantric Diagram and the Colours of the Tirthankaras, International Journal of Jaina Studies, Volume 8, Number 1, pages 1-47; [http://gsas.yale.edu/news/studying-jainism-and-its-tantric-ritual-diagrams-india Summary Archive: Studying Jainism and its Tantric Ritual Diagrams in India, Ellen Gough]&lt;/ref&gt; The Tantric traditions within Jainism use mantra and rituals that are believed to accrue merit for rebirth realms.{{sfn|Cort|2001b|pp=417–419}}

===Festivals===
{{Main|Jain festivals}}
[[File:Das Lakshana (Paryusana) celebrations, New York City Jain temple 2.JPG|thumb|Celebrating [[Das Lakshana]] (Paryusana), [[Jain Center of America]], New York City]]
Jains celebrate many annual festivals. Many of the major festivals in Jainism fall in and around the ''comasu'' (Sanskrit: ''chaturmasa'') period of the calendar. {{sfn|Cort|2001a|pp=146-147}} It is the four month monsoon period when the Jain ascetics are mandated to remain in residence at one place in the Jain tradition, rather than be traveling or going around Indian villages and towns and never staying in one place for more than a month. The ''comasu'' period allows the four orders of the Jain community to be together and participate in the festive remembrances.

The most important annual Jain festival is called the ''Paryushana'' by Svetambaras and ''Dasa lakshana parva'' by the Digambaras. It is celebrated from the 12th day of waning moon in the traditional luni-solar month of [[Bhadra (Hindu calendar)|Bhadrapada]] in the [[Hindu calendar|Indian calendar]]. This typically falls in August or September of the Gregorian calendar.{{sfn|Dalal|2010a|pp=164, 284}}{{sfn|Melton|2011|p=673}} It lasts eight days for Svetambaras, and ten days among the Digambaras.{{sfn|Dalal|2010a|pp=164, 284}} It is a time when lay people fast and pray. The five vows are emphasized during this time.{{sfn|Melton|2011|p=673}} Svetambaras recite the ''Kalpasūtras'', while Digambaras read their own texts. The festival is an occasion where Jains make active effort to stop cruelty towards other life forms, freeing animals in captivity and preventing slaughter of animals.{{sfn|Dalal|2010a|pp=164, 284}}

The last day involves a focused prayer/meditation session known as ''[[Samvatsari]]''. Jains consider this as a day of atonement, granting forgiveness to others, seeking forgiveness from all living beings, physically or mentally asking for forgiveness and resolving to treat everyone in the world as friends.{{sfn|Dalal|2010a|pp=164, 284}} Forgiveness is asked by saying "''[[Micchami Dukkadam]]''" or "''Khamat Khamna''" to others. This means, "If I have offended you in any way, knowingly or unknowingly, in thought, word or action, then I seek your forgiveness." The literal meaning of ''Paryushana'' is "abiding" or "coming together".{{sfn|Cort|1995|p=160}}

[[Mahavir Jayanti]] celebrates the birth of Mahāvīra. It is celebrated on the 13th day of the luni-solar month of [[Chaitra]] in the traditional Indian calendar. This typically falls in March or April of the Gregorian calendar.{{sfn|Dalal|2010a|p=220}}{{sfn|Natubhai Shah|2004|p=211}} The festivities include visiting Jain temples, pilgrimages to shrines, reading Jain texts and processions of Mahāvīra by the community. At his legendary birthplace of Kundagrama in [[Bihar]], north of Patna, special events are held by Jains.{{sfn|Dalal|2010a|p=220}}

[[Diwali (Jainism)|Diwali]] is observed by Jains as the anniversary of Mahāvīra's attainment of ''[[Moksha (Jainism)|moksha]]''.{{sfn|Pechilis|Raj|2013|p=86}} The Hindu festival of [[Diwali]] is also celebrated on the same date (''Kartika Amavasya''). Jain temples, homes, offices, and shops are decorated with lights and [[Diya (lamp)|''diyas'']] ("small oil lamps"). The lights are symbolic of knowledge or removal of ignorance. Sweets are often distributed. On Diwali morning, ''Nirvan Ladoo'' is offered after praying to Mahāvīra in all Jain temples across the world. The Jain new year starts right after Diwali.{{sfn|Pechilis|Raj|2013|p=86}} Some other festivals celebrated by Jains are [[Akshaya Tritiya]] and [[Raksha Bandhan]], similar to those in the Hindu communities.{{sfn|Pechilis|Raj|2013|p=85}}{{sfn|Dalal|2010a|p=164}}

Jainism monastic organization is a part of Jain society called ''sangh''.{{sfn|Cort|2001a|pp=48-49}} A ''sangh'' has a four-fold order, or ''caturvidh, sakal sangh''.{{sfn|Cort|2001a|pp=48-49}} This consists of ''sadhu'' (male ascetics, ''muni''), ''sadhvi'' (female ascetics, ''aryika''), ''[[Śrāvaka (Jainism)|śrāvaka]]'' ("laymen"), and ''śrāvikā'' ("laywoman").{{sfn|Balcerowicz|2009|p=17}}{{sfn|Natubhai Shah|2004|pp=2–3}} The latter two support the ascetics and their monastic organizations called ''gacch'' or ''samuday'', in autonomous regional Jain congregations.{{sfn|Cort|2001a|pp=48-49}}

Digambar tradition has two main monastic orders [[Mula Sangh]] and the [[Kashtha Sangh]], both led by [[Bhattaraka]]s. Other notable monastic orders include the [[Digambara Terapanth]] which emerged in the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;John E.

Jaipur: Rawat, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Śvētāmbaras have their own ''sanghs'', but unlike Digambaras which have had predominantly ''sadhu sanghs'' (male monastic organizations), they have major ''sadhu'' and ''sadhvi'' ''sanghs'' (monks and nuns).{{sfn|Cort|2001a|pp=48-59}}

According to Śvētāmbara Jain texts, from ''Kalpasūtras'' onwards, its monastic community has had more ''sadhvis'' than ''sadhus'' (female than male mendicants). In ''Tapa Gacch'' of the modern era, the ratio of ''sadhvis'' to ''sadhus'' (nuns to monks) is about 3.5 to 1.{{sfn|Cort|2001a|p=47}} In contrast to Śvētāmbara, the Digambara sect monastic community has been predominantly male.{{sfn|Flügel|2006|pp=314–331, 353–361}} In the Digambara tradition, a male human being is considered closest to the apex with the potential to achieve his soul's liberation from rebirths through asceticism. Women must gain karmic merit, to be reborn as man, and only then can they achieve spiritual liberation in the Digambara sect of Jainism.{{sfn|Long|2013|pp=36–37}}{{sfn|Harvey|2016|pp=182–183}} The Śvētāmbaras disagree with the Digambaras, believing that women can also achieve liberation from ''[[Saṃsāra]]'' through ascetic practices.{{sfn|Harvey|2016|pp=182–183}}{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=55–59}}

The Jain monastic organization shares many parallels with those found in Buddhist and Brahmanical-Hindu monasticism.{{sfn|Johnston|2000|pp=681–683}}{{sfn|Caillat|2003a|pp=30-34 with footnote 28}} They all have similar rules, hierarchical structure, practices such as not traveling during the four-month monsoon season and celibacy.{{sfn|Caillat|2003a|pp=30-34 with footnote 28}} According to William Johnston, this is not likely from mutual borrowing of ideas, but because these traditions emerged from the same ancient Indian monastic traditions that preceded the Buddha and the Mahāvīra.{{sfn|Johnston|2000|pp=681–683}} There are some differences. For example, the Jain and Hindu monastic community has been traditionally more mobile and had an itinerant lifestyle, while Buddhist monks have favored belonging to a ''sangha'' (monastery) and staying in its premises.{{sfn|Hirakawa|1993|pp=4–7}} Buddhist monastic rules forbid a monk to go outside without wearing the sangha's distinctive ruddy robe, or to use wooden bowls.{{sfn|Johnston|2000|pp=681–683}} In contrast, Jain monastic rules have either required no clothes (Digambara) or white (Śvētāmbara) and the use of wooden or empty gourd as the begging bowl.{{sfn|Johnston|2000|pp=681–683}} The Jain monastic rules have encouraged the use of mouth cover, as well as a broom to gently remove any insect that comes in their path.{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2013|p=197}}{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=152, 163–164}}{{sfn|Jaini|1998|p=190}}

===Supplementary vows and ''Sallekhana''===
Jainism also prescribes seven supplementary vows which include three ''guņa vratas'' ("merit vows") and four ''śikşā vratas''.{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2012|p=87–88}}{{sfn|Tukol|1976|p=5}}

The ''[[Sallekhana]]'' (or ''Santhara'') vow is a "religious death" ritual vow observed at the end of life, historically by Jain monks and nuns, but rare in the modern age.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=179-180}} In this vow, there is voluntary and gradual reduction of food and liquid intake to end one's life by choice and with dispassion,{{sfn|Jaini|2000|p=16}}{{sfn|Tukol|1976|p=7}} In Jainism this is believed to reduce negative karma that affects a soul's future rebirths.{{sfn|Williams|1991|pp=166–167}}

==Traditions and sects==
{{Main|Jain schools and branches}}

===Digambaras and Śvētāmbaras===
The Jain community is divided into two major [[Religious denomination|denominations]], [[Digambara]] and [[Śvētāmbara]]. Monks of the Digambara ("sky-clad") tradition do not wear clothes. Female monastics of the Digambara sect wear unstitched plain white [[saree]]s and are referred to as ''[[Aryika]]s''. Śvētāmbara ("white-clad") monastics, on the other hand, wear seamless white clothes.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=45}}

During Chandragupta Maurya's reign, Jain tradition states that ''Acharya'' Bhadrabahu predicted a twelve-year-long famine and moved to Karnataka with his disciples. [[Sthulabhadra]], a pupil of ''Acharya'' Bhadrabahu, stayed in Magadha.{{sfn|Clarke|Beyer|2009|p=326}} Later, when followers of ''Acharya'' Bhadrabahu returned, they found those who had remained at Magadha had started wearing white clothes, which was unacceptable to the others who remained naked.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=47}} This is how Jains believe the Digambara and Śvētāmbara schism began, with the former being naked while the latter wore white clothes.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|p=46}} Digambara saw this as being opposed to the Jain tenet of ''aparigraha'' which, according to them, required not even possession of clothes, i.e. complete nudity. In the 5th-century CE, the Council of Valabhi was organized by Śvētāmbara, which Digambara did not attend. At the council, the Śvētāmbara adopted the texts they had preserved as canonical scriptures, which Digambara have ever since rejected. This council solidified the historic schism between these two major traditions of Jainism.{{sfn|Price|2010|pp=104–105}}{{sfn|Fohr|2015|pp=21–22}} The earliest record of Digambara beliefs is contained in the Prakrit ''Suttapahuda'' of [[Kundakunda]].{{sfn|Jaini|1991|p=3}}

Other than rejecting or accepting different ancient Jain texts, Digambaras and Śvētāmbara differ in other significant ways such as:
* Śvētāmbaras trace their practices and dress code to the teachings of Parshvanatha, the 23rd ''tirthankara'', which they believe taught only Four restraints (a claim, scholars say are confirmed by the ancient Buddhist texts that discuss Jaina monastic life). Mahāvīra taught Five vows, which Digambara follow.{{sfn|Jones|Ryan|2006|p=211}}{{sfn|Umakant P. Shah|1987|p=5}}{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=31–33}} The Digambara sect disagrees with the Śvētāmbara interpretations,{{sfn|Jaini|2000|pp=27–28}} and reject the theory of difference in Parshvanatha and Mahāvīra's teachings.{{sfn|Umakant P. Shah|1987|p=5}}
* Digambaras believe that both Parshvanatha and Mahāvīra remained unmarried, whereas Śvētāmbara believe the 23rd and 24th did indeed marry. According to the Śvētāmbara version, Parshva married Prabhavati,{{sfn|Kailash Chand Jain|1991|p=12}} and Mahāvīra married Yashoda who bore him a daughter named Priyadarshana.{{sfn|Natubhai Shah|2004|pp=73–74}}{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=21}} The two sects also differ on the origin of [[Trishala]], Mahāvīra's mother,{{sfn|Natubhai Shah|2004|pp=73–74}} as well as the details of Tirthankara's biographies such as how many auspicious dreams their mothers had when they were in the wombs.{{sfn|Umakant P. Shah|1987|p=17}}
* Digambara believe Rishabha, [[Vasupujya]] and [[Neminatha]] were the three ''tirthankaras'' who reached omniscience while in sitting posture and other ''tirthankaras'' were in standing ascetic posture. In contrast, Śvētāmbaras believe it was Rishabha, Nemi and Mahāvīra who were the three in sitting posture.{{sfn|Umakant P. Shah|1987|pp=79-80}}
* Digambara monasticism rules are more rigid.{{sfn|Dalal|2010a|p=167}}
* Digambara [[iconography]] are plain, Śvētāmbara icons are decorated and colored to be more lifelike.{{sfn|Dalal|2010a|p=167}}

Excavations at Mathura revealed Jain statues from the time of the [[Kushan Empire]] (c.{{nbsp}}1st century CE). ''Tirthankara'' represented without clothes, and monks with cloth wrapped around the left arm, are identified as the ''Ardhaphalaka'' ("half-clothed") mentioned in texts. The [[Yapaniya]]s, believed to have originated from the ''Ardhaphalaka'', followed Digambara nudity along with several Śvētāmbara beliefs.{{sfn|Jaini|2000|p=167}}

===Other sub-traditions===
Both of the major Jain traditions evolved into sub-traditions over time. For example, the devotional worship traditions of Śvētāmbara are referred to as ''[[Murtipujaka|Murti-pujakas]]'', those who live in and around Jain temples became ''Deravasi'' or ''Mandira-margi''. Those who avoid temples and pursue their spirituality at a designated monastic meeting place came to be known as ''[[Sthānakavāsī]]''.{{sfn|Dalal|2010a|p=341}}&lt;ref name=sthanakavasibrit&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/topic/Sthanakavasi Sthanakavasi], JAIN SECT, Encyclopaedia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt; About the 18th century, the Śvētāmbara and Digambara traditions saw an emergence of separate Terapanthi movements.&lt;ref name=sthanakavasibrit/&gt;{{sfn|Cort|2001a|pp=41, 60}}{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=155-157, 249-250, 254-259}} Some scholars such as Malvaniya state that these ideas entered Jainism from an influence of Islam, while others such as Dundas state that these ideas, debates and movements can be traced in more ancient texts than the start of Islam.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=249}}

In the modern era, according to Flügel, new Jaina religious movements that are a "primarily devotional form of Jainism" have developed which resemble "Jain Mahayana" style devotionalism.{{sfn|Flügel|2005|pp=194–243}}

===Gender and spiritual liberation===
A male human being is considered closest to the apex with the potential to achieve liberation, particularly through asceticism. In the Digambara traditional belief, women must gain karmic merit, to be reborn as man, and only then can they achieve spiritual liberation.{{sfn|Long|2013|pp=36–37}}{{sfn|Harvey|2016|pp=182–183}} However, this view has been historically debated within Jainism and different Jaina sects have expressed different views, particularly the Śvētāmbara sect that believes that women too can achieve spiritual liberation from rebirths in ''Saṃsāra''.{{sfn|Harvey|2016|pp=182–183}}{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp= 55–59}} The ''Śvētāmbaras'' state the 19th ''Tirthankara'' [[Māllīnātha]] was female.{{sfn|Vallely|2002|p=15}}  However, Digambara reject this, and worship Mallinatha as a male.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=56}}

==Beliefs and philosophy==

{{Jain philosophy}}

===''Dravya'' ("Substance")===
{{Main|Dravya}}
[[File:Dravya.jpeg|thumb|upright=1.15|Chart showing the classification of ''dravya'' and ''astikaya'']]
The ''dravya'' in Jainism are fundamental entities, called ''astikaya'' (literally, "collection that exists").{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=93-94}} They are believed to be eternal, and the [[ontology|ontological]] building blocks that constitute and explain all existence, whether perceived or not.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=93-94}}{{sfn|Jaini|1998|p=81–89}}

According to the Śvētāmbara tradition of Jainism, there are five eternal substances in existence: Soul (''jiva''), Matter (''pudgala''), Space (''akasha''), motion (''Dharma'') and rest (''Adharma'').&lt;ref name=britdravyajain/&gt;{{refn|group=note|The ontological categories and definition of ''dharma'' as motion, and ''adharma'' as rest, is unique to Jainism among Indian religions.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=95}} However, like other Indian religions, ''dharma'' also means "moral virtue" in Jainism, while ''adharma'' also means "immorality, unethical behavior".&lt;ref name=britdravyajain/&gt;}} To this list of five, the Digambara Jain tradition adds "Time" (''kala'') as the sixth eternal substance.&lt;ref name=britdravyajain/&gt;{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=93-94}}{{sfn|Doniger|1999|p=551}} In both traditions, the substance of space is conceptualized as "world space" (''lokakasha'') and "non-world space" (''alokiakasha''). Further, both soul and matter are considered as active ontological substances, while the rest are inactive.&lt;ref name=britdravyajain/&gt; Another categorization found in Jain philosophy is ''jiva'' and ''ajiva'', the latter being all ''dravya'' that is not ''jiva''.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=93-94}}{{sfn|Jaini|1998|p=81–89}}

====''Jīva'' ("Soul"), ''Ajīva'' ("Non-Soul")====
{{Main|Jīva (Jainism)| Ajiva}}

''Jiva'' means "soul" in Jainism, and is also called ''jivatman''.{{sfn|Long|2013|pp=83-85}} It is a core concept and the fundamental focus of the Jain theology.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=93-94}}{{sfn|Jaini|1998|p=97–101}} The soul is believed to be eternal, and a substance that undergoes constant modifications, in every life, after every rebirth of a living being.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=93-94}}{{sfn|Long|2013|pp=122-125}} ''Jiva'' consists of pure consciousness in the Jain thought, has innate "free will" that causes it to act but is believed to be intangible and formless.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=93-94}} It is the soul that experiences existence and gains knowledge, not mind nor body both believed to a heap of matter.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=94-95}}{{sfn|Champat Rai Jain|1929b|pp=15-16}} Jain philosophy further believes that the soul is the mechanism of rebirth, and karma accumulation. It is the same size in all living beings, such as a human being, a tiny insect and a large elephant. ''Jiva'' is everywhere, filling and infused in every minuscule part of the entire ''loka'' (realm of existence), according to Jainism.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=94-95}} The soul has the potential to reach omniscience and eternal bliss, and end the cycles of rebirth and associated suffering, which is the goal of Jain spirituality.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=94-95}}{{sfn|Jaini|1998|p=97–106}}

The ''jiva'' is believed to rely on other ''dravya'' to function.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=93-94}} The Jain philosophy completely separates body (matter) from the soul (consciousness).&lt;ref name=britdravyajain&gt;{{citation |title=Dravya – Jainism |url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/dravya |work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Souls reside in bodies and journey endlessly through ''[[Saṃsāra (Jainism)|saṃsāra]]'' (that is, realms of existence through cycles of rebirths and redeaths).{{sfn|Wiley|2009|p=91}}

''Jivas'' are believed to be of two types, stationary and mobile. Illustration of the former are plants, while moving ''jivas'' include examples such as human beings, animals, gods, hell beings and insects.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=95-96}} ''Jivas'' are further classified in Jain philosophy by assigned number of senses which range from one sensory organ to five sensory organs.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=95-96}} Inert world such as air, fire or clod of dirt, considered non-sensate in contemporary science, are asserted in historic texts of Jainism to be living and with sensory powers.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Key Chapple (2001), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/20027724 The Living Cosmos of Jainism: A Traditional Science Grounded in Environmental Ethics], ''Daedalus'', MIT Press, Vol. 130, No. 4, pages 207-224&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ajiva'' consists of everything other than ''jiva''.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=93-96}} Life processes such as breath, means of knowledge such as language, all emotional and biological experiences such as pleasure and pain are all believed in Jainism to be made of ''pudgala'' ("matter"). These interact with ''tattva'' or reality to create, bind, destroy or unbind karma particles to the soul.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=96-98}}{{sfn|Soni|1991|pp=75–88}}

According to Dundas, ''Dharma'' as a metaphysical substance in Jain philosophy may be understood as "that which carries" instead of the literal sense of ordinary physical motion. Thus, ''dharma'' includes all verbal and mental activity, that contribute to karma and purification of the soul.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=95-96}}

===''Tattva'' ("Reality")===
{{Main|Tattva (Jainism)}}
[[File:Tattva.jpg|thumb|The 7 [[Tattva (Jainism)|Tattvas]] of Jain philosophy]]
''Tattva'' connotes "Reality, Truth" in Jain philosophy, and is the framework for salvation. According to Digambara Jains, there are seven ''tattvas'', while Śvētāmbaras believe in nine ''tattvas'':{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=177-187}}{{sfn|Jaini|1998|p=151}}{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=96-98}}
* The sentient (''jiva'', soul)
* The insentient (''ajiva'')
* The karmic influx (''[[Asrava|Āsrava]]'') to the soul
* Good karma (''punya'', merits), found in the ''tattva'' theory of Śvētāmbara, but not of Digambaras
* Bad karma (''papa'', negatives), found in the ''tattva'' theory of Śvētāmbara, but not of Digambaras
* The bondage (''[[Bandha (Jainism)|Bandha]]'') of karmic particles to the soul, thereby causing its change, which cumulatively determines the future rebirths{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=188-190}}{{sfn|Jaini|1980|pp=219–228}}
* The stoppage (''[[Saṃvara]]'') of karmic influx
* The dissociation and wiping away of past karmic particles (''[[Nirjara|Nirjarā]]'') from the soul
* The liberation (''[[Moksha (Jainism)|Moksha]]'')

The true insight in Jain philosophy is considered as "faith in the ''tattvas''".{{sfn|Jaini|1998|p=151}} The spiritual goal in Jainism is to reach ''[[moksha]]'' for ascetics, but for most Jain laypersons and ascetics it is to accumulate good karma that leads to better rebirth and a step closer to liberation.{{sfn|Bailey|2012|p=108}}{{sfn|Long|2013|pp=18, 98-100}}

===Soul and Karma===
{{Main|Karma in Jainism}}
According to Jainism, the existence of "a bound and ever changing soul" is a self-evident truth, an axiom which does not need to be proven.{{sfn|Jaini|1998|p=103}} There are numerous souls, but every one of them has three qualities (''[[Guṇa]]''): consciousness (''caitanya'', most important quality of soul), bliss (''sukha'') and vibrational energy (''virya'').{{sfn|Jaini|1998|pp=104-106}} The vibration draws karmic particles to the soul and creates bondages, but is also what adds merit or demerit to the soul.{{sfn|Jaini|1998|pp=104-106}}

Karma, like in other Indian religions, connotes in Jainism the universal cause and effect law. However, it is envisioned as a material substance (subtle matter) that can bind to the soul, travel with the soul substance in bound form between rebirths, and affect the suffering and happiness experienced by the ''jiva'' in the ''lokas''.{{sfn|Long|2013|pp=92-95}} Karma is also believed to obscure and obstruct the innate nature and striving of the soul, as well as its spiritual potential in the next rebirth.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=99-103}}

The relationship between the soul and karma, states Padmanabh Jaini, can be explained with the analogy of gold. Like gold is always found mixed with impurities in its original state, Jainism holds that the soul is not pure at its origin but is always impure and defiled like natural gold. One can exert effort and purify gold, similarly, Jainism states that the defiled soul can be purified by proper refining methodology.{{sfn|Jaini|1998|p=107}} Karma either defiles the soul further, or refines it to a cleaner state, and this affects future rebirths.{{sfn|Jaini|1998|pp=107-115}} Karma is thus an [[efficient cause]] (''nimitta'') in Jain philosophy, but not the [[material cause]] (''upadana''). The soul is believed to be the material cause.{{sfn|Jaini|1998|pp=117-118}}

''Tirthankara-nama-karma'' is a special type of karma, bondage of which raises a soul to the supreme status of a ''tirthankara''.{{sfn|Champat Rai Jain|1929b|p=48}}

[[File:Jiva.jpg|thumb|left|Classification of ''Saṃsāri Jīvas'' (transmigrating souls) in Jainism]]
Jain texts state that souls exist as "clothed with material bodies", where it entirely fills up the body.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|p=194}} There are five types of bodies in the Jaina thought: earthly (e.g. most humans, animals and plants), metamorphic (e.g. gods, hell beings, fine matter, some animals and a few humans who can morph because of their perfections), transference type (e.g. good and pure substances realized by ascetics), fiery (e.g. heat that transforms or digests food), and karmic (the substrate where the karmic particles reside and which make the soul ever changing).{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=195-196}}

Jain philosophy further divides the earthly body by symmetry, number of sensory organs, vitalities (''ayus''), functional capabilities and whether one body hosts one soul or one body hosts many.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=195-198}} Every living being has one to five senses, three ''balas'' (power of body, language and mind), respiration (inhalation and exhalation), and life-duration.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=198-201}}{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2012|p=34}} All living beings, in every realm including the gods and hell beings, accrue and destroy eight types of karma according to the elaborate theories in Jain texts.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=185-194}} Elaborate descriptions of the shape and function of the physical and metaphysical universe, and its constituents, are also provided in the [[Jain texts]].&lt;ref&gt;Shah, R. S. "JAINA MATHEMATICS: LORE OF LARGE NUMBERS." Bulletin of the Marathwada Mathematical Society 10.1 (2009): 43–61.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|p=241}} All of these elaborate theories attempt to illustrate and consistently explain the Jain karma theory in a deeply moral framework, much like Buddhism and Hinduism but with significant differences in the details and assumptions.{{sfn|Long|2013|pp=180-182}}

===Saṃsāra===
{{main|Saṃsāra (Jainism)|Vitalism (Jainism)}}
[[File:Gati or existences.jpg|right|thumb|[[Soul]]s are reborn in various realms of existence depending on their [[karma]]s, according to Jainism.]]
The conceptual framework of the Saṃsāra doctrine differs between the Jainism traditions and other Indian religions. For instance, in Jaina traditions, soul (''jiva'') is accepted as a truth, as is assumed in the Hindu traditions. It is not assumed in the Buddhist traditions. However, Saṃsāra or the cycle of rebirths, has a definite beginning and end in Jainism.{{Sfn|Jaini|1980|p=226}} The Jaina theosophy, unlike Hindu and Buddhist theosophies, asserts that each soul passes through 8,400,000 birth-situations, as they circle through ''Saṃsāra''.{{Sfn|Jaini|1980|p=228}}{{sfn|Jaini|2000|pp=130–131}} As the soul cycles, states Padmanabh Jaini, Jainism traditions believe that it goes through five types of bodies: earth bodies, water bodies, fire bodies, air bodies and vegetable lives.{{Sfn|Jaini|1980|pp=223-224}} With all human and non-human activities, such as rainfall, agriculture, eating and even breathing, minuscule living beings are taking birth or dying, their souls are believed to be constantly changing bodies. Perturbing, harming or killing any life form, including any human being, is considered a sin in Jainism, with negative karmic effects.{{Sfn|Jaini|1980|pp=224-225}}{{sfn|Sethia|2004|pp=30-31}}

Souls begin their journey in a primordial state, and exist in a state of consciousness continuum that is constantly evolving through ''Saṃsāra''.{{Sfn|Jaini|1980|p=227}} Some evolve to a higher state; some regress asserts the Jaina theory, a movement that is driven by the karma.{{Sfn|Jaini|1980|pp=227-228}} Further, Jaina traditions believe that there exist ''Abhavya'' ("incapable"), or a class of souls that can never attain ''[[moksha]]'' ("liberation").{{Sfn|Jaini|1980|p=226}}{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=104-105}} The ''Abhavya'' state of soul is entered after an intentional and shockingly evil act.{{Sfn|Jaini|1980|p=225}} Jainism considers souls as pluralistic each in a karma-samsara cycle, and does not subscribe to ''[[Advaita Vedanta|Advaita]]''-style ("not two") [[nondualism]] of Hinduism, or ''[[Madhyamaka|Advaya]]''-style nondualism of Buddhism.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=104-105}} A liberated soul in Jainism is one who has gone beyond ''Saṃsāra'', is at the apex, is omniscient, remains there eternally, and is known as a ''Siddha''.{{Sfn|Jaini|1980|pp=222-223}}

===Cosmology===
{{Main|Jain cosmology}}

[[File:Jain universe.JPG|thumb|left|Rebirth ''loka'' (realms of existence) in Jain cosmology.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=90-92}}]]

Jain texts propound that the universe consists of many eternal ''lokas'' ("realms of existence"). As in Buddhism and Hinduism, Jain cosmology believes both time and the universe are eternal without beginning and end, and that the universe is transient (impermanent in attributes) at the same time.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|p=241}}{{sfn|Long|2013|pp=83-85}} The universe, body, matter and time are considered in Jain philosophy as separate from the soul (''jiva'' or ''jivatman''). Their interaction explains life, living, death and rebirth.{{sfn|Long|2013|pp=83-85}}

[[File:Jain Cosmic Time Cycle.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Division of time in Jain cosmology.]]
According to the Jain texts, the universe is divided into three parts, the upper, middle, and lower worlds, called respectively ''urdhva loka'', ''madhya loka'', and ''adho loka''.{{sfn|Shah|1998b|p=25}} As with the realms of existences, ''Kāla'' ("time") is without beginning and eternal;{{sfn|Doniger|1999|p=551}} the cosmic wheel of time, called ''kālachakra'', rotates ceaselessly. According to Jain texts, in this part of the universe, there are six periods of time within two aeons (''ara''), and in the first aeon the universe generates, and in the next it degenerates.{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2011|p=46}} Thus, the worldly cycle of time is divided into two parts or half-cycles, ''utsarpiṇī'' ("ascending") and ''[[avasarpiṇī]]'' ("descending").{{sfn|Doniger|1999|p=551}} ''Utsarpiṇī'' is a period of progressive prosperity, where happiness increases, while ''avasarpiṇī'' is a period of increasing sorrow and immorality.{{sfn|Upinder Singh|2016|p=313}}{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=271–272}} According to Jain cosmology, it is currently the fifth ''ara'' of ''avasarpiṇī'' (half time cycle of degeneration). The present age is one of sorrow and misery, of religious decline, where the height and shape of living beings shrink. Jain thought holds that after the sixth ''ara'', the universe will be reawakened in the new cycle and the start of ''utsarpiṇī'' ''aras''.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=13}}{{sfn|Champat Rai Jain|1929b|p=124}}{{sfn|Dalal|2010a|p=27}}

According to Jain texts, sixty-three illustrious beings, called ''[[śalākāpuruṣa]]s'', are born on this earth in every ''Dukhama-sukhamā'' ''ara''.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=134–135}} The Jain universal history is a compilation of the deeds of these illustrious persons.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=12}} They comprise twenty-four ''Tīrthaṅkaras'', twelve ''[[chakravartin]]s'', nine ''[[balabhadra]]'', nine ''narayana'', and nine ''pratinarayana''.{{sfn|Joseph|1997|p=178}}{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=134–135, 285}}{{refn|group=note|Balabhadra is also referred to as Baladeva, Narayana as Vasudeva or Vishnu, and Pratinarayana as Prativasudeva in Jain texts.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=134–135, 285}}}}

A ''chakravartī'' is an emperor of the world and lord of the material realm.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=134–135}} Though he possesses worldly power, he often finds his ambitions dwarfed by the vastness of the cosmos. Jain ''[[purana]]s'' give a list of twelve ''chakravartins'' ("universal monarchs"). They are golden in complexion.{{sfn|Umakant P. Shah|1987|p=72}} One of the ''chakravartins'' mentioned in Jain scriptures is [[Bharata Chakravartin]]. Jain texts like ''[[Harivamsa Purana]]'' and Hindu Texts like ''Vishnu Purana'' state that Indian subcontinent came to be known as ''Bharata varsha'' in his memory.{{sfn|Sangave|2001|p=106}}{{sfn|Kailash Chand Jain|1991|p=5}}

There are nine sets of ''balabhadra'', ''narayana'', and ''pratinarayana''. The ''balabhadra'' and ''narayana'' are brothers.{{sfn|Jaini|2000|p=377}} ''Balabhadra'' are nonviolent heroes, ''narayana'' are violent heroes, and ''pratinarayana'' the villains. According to the legends, the ''narayana'' ultimately kill the ''pratinarayana''. Of the nine ''balabhadra'', eight attain liberation and the last goes to heaven. On death, the ''narayana'' go to hell because of their violent exploits, even if these were intended to uphold righteousness.{{sfn|Umakant P. Shah|1987|pp=73–76}}

[[Jain cosmology]] divides the worldly cycle of time into two parts (''avasarpiṇī'' and ''utsarpiṇī''). According to Jain belief, in every half-cycle of time, twenty-four ''tīrthaṅkaras'' are born in the human realm to discover and teach the Jain doctrine appropriate for that era.{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2015|p=175}}{{sfn|Jansma|Jain|2006|p=28}}{{sfn|Lindsay Jones|2005|p=4764}} The word ''tīrthankara'' signifies the founder of a ''[[Tirtha (Jainism)|tirtha]]'', which means a fordable passage across a sea. The ''tīrthaṅkaras'' show the 'fordable path' across the sea of interminable births and deaths.{{sfn|Balcerowicz|2009|p=16}} [[Rishabhanatha]] is said to be the first ''tīrthankara'' of the present half-cycle (''avasarpiṇī''). Mahāvīra (6th century BC) is revered as the twenty fourth ''tīrthankara'' of ''avasarpiṇī''.{{sfn|Natubhai Shah|2004|pp=21–28}}{{sfn|Zimmer|1953|pp=182–183}} Jain texts explain that Jainism has always existed and will always exist.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=12}}

In Jainism, perfect souls ''with'' the body are called ''[[Arihant (Jainism)|arihant]]'' ("victors") and perfect souls ''without'' the body are called ''[[Siddha]]s'' ("liberated souls").{{Sfn|Jaini|1980|pp=222-223}}{{sfn|Rankin|Mardia|2013|p=40}}{{sfn|Zimmer|1953|p=182}}

===God===

{{Main|God in Jainism}}
{{See also|Pañca-Parameṣṭhi}}
According to Jainism, the universe was never created, nor will it ever cease to exist. It is independent and self-sufficient, does not require a creator nor any superior power to govern it, nor a judge nor destroyer.{{sfn|Long|2013|pp=83-85}}{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=241-242}} In this belief, it is distinct from the monotheistic Abrahamic religions; it is similar to Buddhism. It shares premises with the non-theistic part of the spectrum of diverse beliefs found in different traditions within Hindu philosophy and distinct from theistic Hindu traditions.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=241-243}}

Jain texts reject the idea of a creator, ruler or destroyer god and postulate an [[Jainism and non-creationism|eternal universe]]. However, Jainism believes in the world of gods and hell beings who are born, and who die to be reborn like living beings in the earthly realm of existence.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=247-249, 262-263}}{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=20-21, 34-35, 74, 91, 95-96, 103}} Those souls who live in the body of a god do so because of their positive karma. They have a metamorphic body, that is they are believed in Jain thought to be able to change their body at will. The gods live a life of happiness, fun and frolic, whose wishes are automatically fulfilled.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=262-263}} They also possess a more transcendent knowledge about material things and can anticipate events in the human realms.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=262-263}} However, once their past karmic merit is exhausted, the souls leave the "god body" and are reborn again as humans, animals or other beings.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=262-263}}{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=91, 95-96}}

===Epistemology===
{{Main|Jain epistemology}}
Jain philosophy accepts three reliable means of knowledge (''[[pramana]]''). It holds that correct knowledge is based on perception (''pratyaksa''), inference (''anumana'') and testimony (''sabda'' or the word of scriptures).&lt;ref&gt;John A. Grimes, A Concise Dictionary of Indian Philosophy: Sanskrit Terms Defined in English, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791430675}}, page 238&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jsoni367&gt;Jayandra Soni (2000), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1400179 Basic Jaina Epistemology], Philosophy East and West, University of Hawai'i Press, Vol. 50, No. 3, pages 367-377&lt;/ref&gt; These ideas are elaborated in Jain texts such as ''Tattvarthasūtra'', ''Parvacanasara'', ''Nandi'' and ''Anuyogadvarini''.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=75-76, 131, 229-230}}&lt;ref name=jsoni367/&gt; Some Jain texts add analogy (''upamana'') as the fourth reliable means, in a manner similar to [[pramana|epistemological theories]] found in other Indian religions.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=229-230}}

In Jainism, ''jnāna'' ("knowledge") is said to be of five kinds—''[[Kevala Jnana]]'' ("Omniscience"), ''Śrutu Jñāna'' ("Scriptural Knowledge"), ''Mati Jñāna'' ("Sensory Knowledge"), ''Avadhi Jñāna'' ("Clairvoyance"), and ''Manah prayāya Jñāna'' ("Telepathy").{{sfn|S.A. Jain|1992|p=16}} According to the Jain text ''Tattvartha sūtra'', the first two are indirect knowledge and the remaining three are direct knowledge.{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2011|p=6}}

===Salvation, liberation===
{{Main|Moksha (Jainism)||Ratnatraya|Gunasthana}}
[[File:MahaveeJi.jpg|thumb|The three [[Shikhara|shikhar]] (top) of a [[Jain temple]] represents ''Ratnatraya'' (three jewels)]]

According to Jainism, purification of soul and liberation can be achieved through the path of three jewels:{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2011|p=6}}{{sfn|Cort|2001a|pp=6-7}}{{sfn|Fohr|2015|pp=9–10, 37}}
# ''Samyak darśana'' ("Correct View") {{nsndns}} Faith in basic tenets of Jainism, acceptance of the self-evident truth of soul (''jīva''){{sfn|Jaini|1998|pp=141-147}}
# ''Samyak jnana'' ("Correct Knowledge") {{nsndns}} Knowledge of the ''tattvas'' without any doubt or misapprehension{{sfn|Jaini|1998|pp=148, 200}}
# ''Samyak charitra'' (Correct Conduct) {{nsndns}} behavior consistent with the Five vows{{sfn|Jaini|1998|pp=148, 200}}

Jain texts often add ''samyak tap'' (Correct Asceticism) as the fourth jewel, thereby emphasizing their belief in ascetic practices as the means to liberation ([[moksha]]).{{sfn|Cort|2001a|p=7}} The four jewels of orthodox Jain ideology are called ''moksha marg''.{{sfn|Cort|2001a|pp=6-7}} According to Jain texts, the liberated pure soul (''Siddha'') goes up to the summit of universe (''[[Siddhashila]]'') and dwells there in eternal bliss.{{sfn|S.A.

==Scriptures and texts==
{{Main|Jain literature|Jain Agamas}}

[[File:Jain Agamas.jpeg|thumb|upright=0.85|Stela depicting ''Śhrut Jnāna'', or complete scriptural knowledge]]

Jain scriptures are called ''Agamas''. They are believed to have been verbally transmitted by the [[oral tradition]] from one generation to the next, much like the ancient Buddhist and Hindu texts.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=60-61}} The Jain tradition believes that their religion is eternal, and the teachings of their first ''Tirthankara Rishabhanatha'' were their scriptures millions of years ago.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp= 109–110}} The mythology states that the ''tirthankara'' taught in a divine preaching hall called ''[[samavasarana]]'', which were heard by the gods, the ascetics and laypersons. The discourse delivered is called ''Śhrut Jnāna'' and comprises eleven ''[[Jain Agamas#Angas|angas]]'' and fourteen ''[[purvas]]''.{{sfn|Champat Rai Jain|1929b|p=135}} The discourse is remembered and transmitted by the ''[[Ganadhara]]s'' ("chief disciples"), and is composed of twelve ''angas'' ("departments"). It is symbolically represented by a tree with twelve branches.{{sfn|Champat Rai Jain|1929b|p=136}}

According to the Jain tradition, an ''araha'' ("worthy one") speaks meaning that is then converted into ''sūtra'' (''sutta'') by his disciples, and from such ''sūtras'' emerge the doctrine.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=61}} The creation and transmission of the ''Agama'' is the work of disciples in Jainism. These texts, historically for Jains, have represented the truths uttered by their ''tirthankaras'', particularly the Mahāvīra.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=61}} In every cycle of Jain cosmology, twenty-four ''tirthankaras'' appear and so do the Jain scriptures for that ''ara''.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=109–110}} The spoken scriptural language is believed to be ''[[Magadhi Prakrit|Ardhamagadhi]]'' by the Śvētāmbara Jains, and a form of sonic resonance by the Digambara Jains. These then become coded into ''duvala samgagani pidaga'' (twelve limbed baskets by disciples), but transmitted orally.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=60-61}} In the 980th year after Mahāvīra's death (~5th century CE), the texts were written down for the first time by the Council of Valabhi.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=110–111}}

The Śvētāmbaras believe that they have the original Jain scriptures. The Śvētāmbara belief is denied by the Digambaras, who instead believe the scriptures were lost.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=61}}{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=121-122}} The Śvētāmbaras state that their collection of 45 works represent a continuous tradition, though they accept that their collection is also incomplete because of a lost Anga text and four lost Purva texts.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=112-113}} The Digambara sect of Jainism believes that Āchārya [[Bhutabali]] was the last ascetic who had partial knowledge of the original canon. According to them, Digambara ''Āchāryas'' recreated the oldest-known Digambara Jain texts, including the four ''anuyoga''.{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2016|p=xii}}{{sfn|Jaini|1998|p=78-81}}{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|p=124}} According to von Glasenapp, the Digambara texts partially agree with the enumerations and works of older Śvētāmbara texts, but in many cases there are also gross differences between the texts of the two major Jain traditions.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=121-122}}

The Śvētāmbara consider their 45 text collection as canonical.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=112-113}} The Digambaras created a secondary canon between 600 and 900 CE, compiling it into four groups: history, cosmography, philosophy and ethics.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=123-124}} This four-set collection is called the "four ''Vedas''" by the Digambaras.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=123-124}}{{refn|group=note|Not to be confused with the four ''[[Veda]]s'' of Hinduism.{{sfn|Dalal|2010a|pp=164-165}}}}

The most popular and influential texts of Jainism have been its non-canonical literature. Of these, the ''[[Kalpa Sūtra]]s'' are particularly popular among Śvētāmbaras, which they attribute to Bhadrabahu (c. 300 BCE). This ancient scholar is revered in the Digambara tradition, and they believe he led their migration into the ancient south Karnataka region, and created their tradition.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=125-126}} Śvētāmbaras disagree, and they believe that Bhadrabahu moved to Nepal, not into peninsular India.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=125-126}} Both traditions, however, consider his ''Niryuktis'' and ''Samhitas'' as important texts. The earliest surviving Sanskrit text by [[Umaswati]] called the ''[[Tattvarthasūtra]]'' is considered authoritative Jain philosophy text by all traditions of Jainism. {{Sfn|Jones|Ryan|2007|pp=439–440}}{{Sfn|Umāsvāti|1994|p=xi–xiii, Quote: "That Which Is, known as the ''Tattvartha Sūtra'' to Jains, is recognized by all four Jain traditions as the earliest, most authoritative and comprehensive summary of their religion."}}{{sfn|Dundas|2006|pp=395–396}} His text has the same importance in Jainism as ''[[Vedanta Sūtras]]'' and ''[[Yogasūtras]]'' have in [[Hinduism]].{{Sfn|Umāsvāti|1994|p=xiii}}{{sfn|Jones|Ryan|2007|pp=439–440}}{{sfn|Johnson|1995|pp=46–51, 91–96}}

In the Digambara tradition, the texts written by Kundakunda are highly revered and have been historically influential.{{sfn|Finegan|1989|p=221}}{{sfn|Balcerowicz|2003|pp=25-34}}{{sfn|Chatterjee|2000|p=282–283}} Other important Jain texts include: ''[[Samayasara]]'', ''[[Ratnakaranda śrāvakācāra]]'', and ''[[Niyamasara]]''.{{sfn|Jaini|1991|p=32–33}}

===Influence on Indian literature===
[[File:Mangulam inscription.jpg|thumb|[[Mangulam]] inscription dated 2nd century BCE]]
Parts of the [[Sangam literature]] in Tamil are attributed to Jaina authors. The authenticity and interpolations are controversial, because the Sangam literature presents Hindu ideas.{{sfn|Cush|Robinson|York|2012|pp=515, 839}} Some scholars state that the Jain portions of the Sangam literature were added about or after the 8th-century CE, and they are not the ancient layer.{{sfn|Zvelebil|1992|pp=13–16}}

Tamil Jain texts such as the ''[[Cīvaka Cintāmaṇi]]'' and ''[[Nālaṭiyār]]'' are credited to Digambara Jain authors.{{sfn|Cort|1998|p=163}}{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=116–117}} These texts have seen interpolations and revisions. For example, it is generally accepted now that the Jain nun Kanti inserted a 445-verse poem into ''Cīvaka Cintāmaṇi'' in the 12th century.{{sfn|Zvelebil|1992|pp=37–38}}{{sfn|Spuler|1952|pp=24–25, context: 22-27}} The Tamil Jain literature, according to Dundas, has been "lovingly studied and commented upon for centuries by Hindus as well as Jains".{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=116–117}} The themes of two of the Tamil epics, including the ''Silapadikkaram'', have an embedded influence of Jainism.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=116–117}}

Jain scholars also contributed to [[Kannada literature]].{{sfn|Cort|1998|p=164}} The Digambara Jain texts in Karnataka are unusual, in that they were written under the patronage of kings and regional aristocrats. These Jain texts describe warrior violence and martial valor as equivalent to a "fully committed Jain ascetic". They thus set aside the religious premise of absolute non-violence, possibly reflecting an effort to syncretise various doctrines and beliefs found in Hinduism and Jainism.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=118-120}}

Jain manuscript libraries, called ''bhandaras'' inside Jain temples, are the oldest surviving in India.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=83}} Jain libraries, including the Śvētāmbara collections at [[Patan, Gujarat]] and [[Jaisalmer|Jaiselmer, Rajasthan]], as well as the Digambara collections in Karnataka temples, have a large number of well-preserved manuscripts.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=83}}&lt;ref name="metmu"&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/jaim/hd_jaim.htm | title=Jain Manuscript Painting | publisher=Heilburnn Timeline of Art History | work=The Metropolitan Museum of Art |date=January 2012 |last=Guy| first= John }}&lt;/ref&gt; The manuscripts in the Jain libraries include Jaina literature, as well as Hindu and Buddhist texts. Almost all their texts have been dated to about, or after, the 11th century CE.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=83–84}} The largest and most valuable libraries are found in the [[Thar Desert]], hidden in the underground vaults of Jain temples. These collections have witnessed insect damage, and only a small portion of these manuscripts have been published and studied by scholars.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=83–84}}

==Comparison with Buddhism and Hinduism==
{{main|Buddhism and Jainism|Jainism and Hinduism}}
Jainism differs from both Buddhism and Hinduism in its ontological premises. All of them believe in impermanence, but Buddhism incorporates, amongst other things, the premise of ''[[anatta]]'' ("non-self", "no eternal self or soul"). Hinduism incorporates the premise of an eternal unchanging ''[[Atman (Hinduism)|atman]]'' ("self", "soul"), while Jainism incorporates the premises of a ''jiva'' ("self", "soul") that is both eternal and changing.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=87-88}}{{sfn|Wiley|2004|pp=2-5}}{{sfn|Long|2013|pp=122-125}} In Jaina thought, there are infinite eternal ''jivas'', predominantly all of which are in their cycles of rebirth, and a few who have liberated themselves through an ascetic life and become ''siddhas'' ("a perfect one").{{sfn|Hiriyanna|1993|pp=157–158, 168-169}} In contrast to Jainism, Hindu philosophies express a spectrum of views, ranging from [[advaita|nondualism]] where all souls are identical as Brahman and posited as interconnected one, to [[dvaita|dualism]] where souls are same and have Brahman-nature but are different from Brahman, and to other ideas.{{sfn|Hiriyanna|1993|pp=54–62, 77-82, 132}}{{sfn|Perrett|2013|pp=247–248}}{{sfn|Bartley|2013|pp=1-10, 76-79, 87-98}} Further, in Hindu thought, Jainism-style asceticism is not emphasized, rather liberation is achievable through alternate paths such as [[Jnana yoga]], [[Karma yoga]] and [[Bhakti yoga]].{{sfn|Raju|1985|pp=7–8}}{{sfn|Fowler|2012|pp=89–93}}{{sfn|Klostermaier|2007|pp=119–120}}

While both Hinduism and Jainism believe "soul exists" to be a self-evident truth, most Hindu systems consider it to be eternally present, infinite and the constant (''[[vibhu]]'') but some Hindu scholars proposed soul to be atomic. The Hindu thought generally discusses Atman and [[Brahman]] through a monistic or dualistic framework. In contrast, the Jaina thought denies the Hindu metaphysical concept of Brahman, and Jain philosophy considers the soul to be ever changing and bound to the body or matter for each lifetime, thereby having a finite size that infuses the entire body of a living being.{{sfn|Jaini|1998|pp=58, 102-105}}

Some early colonial scholars stated that Jainism like Buddhism was, in part, a rejection of the caste system in Hinduism.{{sfn|Nesfield|1885|pp=116–117}}{{sfn|Pope|1880|pp=40–41}} Later scholars, such as Gombrich state that this notion is an error for which "mainly Western authors are responsible".{{sfn|Alberts|2007|pp=258–259}} A caste system has been a historic part of Jain society.{{sfn|Juergensmeyer|2011|p=54}}{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=147-149, 304 footnote 24}}{{sfn|Babb|1996|pp=137–145, 54, 172}} According to Vilas Adinath Sangave, "caste system is a universal feature of the Jaina community", and the focus of Jainism has been the spiritual liberation of the individual rather than social reforms.{{sfn|Sangave|1980|pp=73, 316-317}}{{refn|group=note|According to [[Richard Gombrich]] and other scholars, Buddhism too was not a rejection or rebellion against any ancient caste system and it too was focused on individual's liberation from rebirths and suffering.

Jainism is similar to Buddhism in [[epistemology|epistemically]] rejecting the Vedas and the Hindu metaphysical concept for Reality called Brahman. Jainism and Hinduism, however, both believe "soul exists" as a self-evident truth, and in their historic theology and practice have been more similar than with Buddhism.{{sfn|Dalal|2010b|pp=174–175}}{{sfn|Solomon|Higgins|1998|pp=18–22}} Jains and Hindus have frequently intermarried over their history, particularly in northern, central and western regions of India.{{sfn|Juergensmeyer|2011|p=54}}{{sfn|Kelting|2009|pp=206 note 4}}

==Art and architecture==
{{Main|Jain art}}
[[File:Thirakoil-Parsava nathar.JPG|thumb|left|Ancient sculpture depicting Parshvanatha at [[Thirakoil]], [[Tamil Nadu]]]]
Jainism has contributed significantly to Indian art and architecture. Jain arts depict life legends of ''tirthankara'' or other important people, particularly with them in a seated or standing meditative posture. ''[[Yaksha]]s'' and ''[[yakshini]]s'', attendant spirits who guard the ''tirthankara'', are usually shown with them.{{sfn|Shah|1998b|p=184}} The earliest known Jain image is in the [[Patna]] museum. It is dated approximately to the 3rd century BCE.{{sfn|Shah|1998b|p=184}} Bronze images of Pārśva can be seen in the Prince of Wales Museum, Mumbai, and in the Patna museum; these are dated to the 2nd century BCE.{{sfn|Umakant P.

''Ayagapata'' is a type of [[votive]] tablet used in Jainism for donation and worship in the early centuries. These tablets are decorated with objects and designs central to Jain worship such as the ''[[stupa]]'', ''[[dharmacakra]]'' and ''[[triratna]]''. They present simultaneous trends or image and symbol worship. Numerous such stone tablets were discovered during excavations at ancient Jain sites like [[Kankali Tila]] near [[Mathura]] in Uttar Pradesh, India. The practice of donating these tablets is documented from 1st century BCE to 3rd century CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kishore|first=Kanika|date=2015-06-16|title=Symbol and Image Worship in Jainism|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0376983615569814|journal=Indian Historical Review|language=en|volume=42|issue=1|pages=17–43|doi=10.1177/0376983615569814}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Brit&gt;{{cite web|title=Ayagapata|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/46406/ayagapata|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jain|Fischer|1978|pp=9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Samavasarana]]'', a preaching hall of ''tirthankaras'' with various beings concentrically placed, is an important theme of Jain art.{{sfn|Wiley|2009|p=184}}

The [[Kirti Stambh|Jain tower in Chittor]], Rajasthan, is a good example of Jain architecture.{{sfn|Owen|2012|pp=1–2}} Decorated manuscripts are preserved in Jain libraries, containing diagrams from Jain cosmology.{{sfn|Shah|1998b|p=183}} Most of the paintings and illustrations depict historical events, known as ''Panch Kalyanaka'', from the life of the ''tirthankara''. Rishabha, the first ''tirthankara'', is usually depicted in either the [[lotus position]] or ''kayotsarga'', the standing position. He is distinguished from other ''tirthankara'' by the long locks of hair falling to his shoulders. Bull images also appear in his sculptures.{{sfn|Shah|1998b|p=113}} In paintings, incidents from his life, like his marriage and [[Indra]] marking his forehead, are depicted. Other paintings show him presenting a pottery bowl to his followers; he is also seen painting a house, weaving, and being visited by his mother Marudevi.{{sfn|Jain|Fischer|1978|p=16}} Each of the twenty-four ''tirthankara'' is associated with distinctive emblems, which are listed in such texts as ''Tiloyapannati'', ''Kahavaali'' and ''Pravacanasaarodhara''.{{sfn|Shah|1998b|p=187}}

A Jain temple, ''Derasar'' or ''Basadi'' is a [[place of worship]] for [[Jains]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.kamat.com/glossary/?whoID=234 |title=Basadi |work=kamat.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jain temples are built with various architectural designs,{{sfn|Singhvi|Chopra|2002|p=}}{{Page needed|date=March 2017}} but there are mainly two type of Jain temples:
# [[Shikhara|Shikar]]-''bandhi'' Jain temple (one with a dome)
# ''Ghar'' Jain temple ([[Jain house temple]] – one without a dome).

There is always a main deity also known as ''moolnayak'' in every Jain temple placed inside a sanctum called ''[[Garbhagriha|"Gambhara"]]'' (Garbha Griha). A ''[[manastambha]]'' ("column of honor") is a pillar that is often constructed in front of Jain temples.

There are 26 caves, 200 stone beds, 60 inscriptions, and over 100 sculptures in and around [[Madurai]]. This is also the site where Jain ascetics wrote great epics and books on grammar in Tamil.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=S. S.

The Udayagiri and Khandagiri Caves dating back to the 2nd–1st century BCE are dedicated to Jainism. They are rich with carvings of Jain ''tirthanakars'' and deities with inscriptions including the [[Hathigumpha inscription|''Hathigumpha'' inscription]] ("Elephant Cave" inscription).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.proel.org/index.php?pagina=alfabetos/dravidi |title=Source |work=proel.org }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Upinder Singh|2016|p=460}} Jain cave temples at [[Badami cave temples|Badami]], [[Mangi-Tungi]] and the Ellora Caves are considered important.{{sfn|Owen|2012|p=50}}

The [[Sittanavasal Cave]] temple is regarded as one of the finest examples of Jain art. It is the oldest and most famous Jain centre in the region. It possesses both an early Jain cave shelter, and a medieval rock-cut temple with excellent fresco paintings comparable to Ajantha paintings; the steep hill contains an isolated but spacious cavern. Locally, this cavern is known as ''"Eladipattam"'', a name that is derived from the seven holes cut into the rock that serve as steps leading to the shelter. Within the cave there are seventeen stone beds aligned in rows; each of these has a raised portion that could have served as a pillow-loft. The largest stone bed has a distinct [[Tamil-Brahmi]] inscription assignable to the 2nd century BCE, and some inscriptions belonging to the 8th century BCE are also found on the nearby beds. The Sittannavasal cavern continued to be the Holy Sramana Abode until the 7th and 8th centuries. Inscriptions over the remaining stone beds name mendicants such as Tol kunrattu Kadavulan, Tirunilan, Tiruppuranan, Tittaicharanan, Sri Purrnacandran, Thiruchatthan, Ilangowthaman, Sri Ulagathithan, and Nityakaran Pattakali as monks.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=S.

===Pilgrimages===
{{Main|Tirtha (Jainism)}}
Jain ''Tirtha'' ("pilgrim") sites are divided into the following categories:{{sfn|Titze|1998|p=}}
* ''Siddhakshetra''{{snds}}Site of the [[Moksha (Jainism)|''moksha'']] of an ''arihant'' (''kevalin'') or ''tirthankara'', such as: [[Mount Kailash|Ashtapada]], [[Shikharji]], [[Girnar]], [[Pawapuri]], [[Palitana]], [[Mangi-Tungi]], and [[Champapuri]] (capital of [[Anga]]).
* ''Atishayakshetra''{{snds}}Locations where divine events have occurred, such as: [[Mahavirji]], [[Rishabhdeo]], [[Kundalpur]], [[Tijara Jain Temple|Tijara]], and [[Aharji]].
* ''Puranakshetra''{{snds}} Places associated with the lives of great men, such as: [[Ayodhya]], [[Vidisha]], [[Hastinapur]], and [[Rajgir]].
* ''Gyanakshetra''{{snds}} Places associated with famous ''[[acharya]]s'', or centers of learning, such as [[Shravanabelagola]].

Outside contemporary India, Jain communities built temples in locations such as [[Nagarparkar]], [[Sindh]] ([[Pakistan]]). However, according to a UNESCO tentative world heritage site application, Nagarparkar was not a "major religious centre or a place of pilgrimage" for Jainism, but it was once an important cultural landscape before "the last remaining Jain community left the area in 1947 at Partition".&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/6111/ Nagarparkar Cultural Landscape], Tantative List, UNESCO World Heritage Centre&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statues and sculptures===
{{Main|Jain sculpture}}

Jain sculptures are mainly images depicting ''tīrthaṅkaras''. A sculpture could depict any of the twenty-four ''tīrthaṅkaras{{'}}s'' images. Parshvanatha, Rishabhanatha and Mahāvīra are among the more popular. These ''tīrthaṅkaras'' usually depicted in the lotus position or ''kayotsarga''.{{sfn|Arora||p=405}} Sculptures of ''chaumukha'' ("quadruple") images are also popular in Jainism. Sculptures of Arihant, [[Bahubali]], and protector deities like [[Ambika (Jainism)|Ambika]] are also found. ''Tirthanakar'' idols look similar and are differentiated by the symbol belonging to each ''tirthanakar'' except Parshvanatha. Statues of Parshvanath have a snake crown on head. There are a few differences between the Digambara and the Śvētāmbara depictions of idols.{{sfn|Cort|2010}} Digambara images are naked without any beautification, whereas Śvētāmbara depictions are clothed and decorated with temporary ornaments.{{sfn|Cort|2010}}

A monolithic, {{convert|18|m|ft|adj=on|abbr=off}} statue of Bahubali, referred to as ''[[Gommateshvara]]'', built in 981 CE by the Ganga minister and commander [[Chavundaraya]], is situated on a hilltop in Shravanabelagola in the [[Hassan district]] of Karnataka state. This statue was voted first in the SMS poll Seven Wonders of India conducted by ''[[The Times of India]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/2256323.cms |title=And India's 7 wonders are |newspaper=[[The Times of India]] |date= 5 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Statue of Ahiṃsā]] (depicting Rishabhanatha) was erected in the [[Nashik district]] in 2015; it is {{convert|33|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/70-crore-plan-for-idol-installation-at-Mangi-Tungi/articleshow/50037188.cms |title=70-crore plan for idol installation at Mangi-Tungi |work=[[The Times of India]] |date=4 December 2015 |last=Botekar |first=Abhilash |agency=TNN |location=[[Nashik]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Idols made from ''[[Ashtadhatu]]'' (literally "eight metals"), [[Akota Bronzes|Akota Bronze]], [[brass]], [[gold]], [[silver]], stone [[monolith]]s, [[Rock-cut architecture|rock cut]], and precious stones are popular in Jainism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url={{Google books|clUmKaWRFTkC|page=|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}}|title=Indian Sculpture: Circa 500 B.C.-A.D. 700|publisher=Los Angeles County Museum of Art|first=Pratapaditya|last=Pal|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/jais/hd_jais.htm|title=Met Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large number of ''ayagapata'', [[votive]] tablets for offerings and the worship of ''tīrthankara'', were excavated from [[Kankali Tila]], [[Mathura]]. These sculptures date from the 2nd century BCE to the 12th century CE.{{sfn|Jain|Fischer|1978|pp=9–10}}

===Symbols===
{{Main|Jain symbols}}
[[File:Jain Prateek Chihna.svg|thumb|upright=0.8|The Jain emblem]]
Jain icons and arts incorporate symbols such as swastika, om, and the ''Ashtamangala''.

====Swastika====
The [[swastika]] is an important Jain symbol. Its four arms symbolise the four realms of existence in which rebirth occurs according to Jainism: humans, heavenly beings, hellish beings and non-humans (plants and animals).{{sfn|Cort|2001a|p=17}}{{sfn|Jansma|Jain|2006|p=123}} This is conceptually similar to the six realms of rebirth represented by ''[[bhavachakra]]'' in Buddhism.{{sfn|Cort|2001a|p=17}} It is usually shown with three dots on the top, which represent the three jewels mentioned in ancient texts such as ''Tattvartha sūtra'' and ''Uttaradhyayana sūtra'': correct faith, correct understanding and correct conduct. These jewels are the means believed in Jainism to lead one to the state of spiritual perfection, a state that is symbolically represented by a crescent and one dot on top representing the liberated soul.{{sfn|Cort|2001a|pp=17-18}}

====Symbol of ''Ahiṃsā''====
The hand with a wheel on the palm symbolizes [[Ahimsa in Jainism|''ahimsā'' in Jainism]] with ''ahiṃsā'' written in the middle. The wheel represents the ''[[dharmachakra]]'' ("Wheel of the Dharma"), which stands for the resolve to halt the ''saṃsāra'' ("wandering") through the relentless pursuit of ''ahimsā'' ("compassion").

====''Om''====
[[File:Om_jaïn_orange.svg|thumb|upright=0.45|[[Om#Jainism|Om]] in Jainism]]
In Jainism, [[Om#Jainism|''Om'']] is considered a condensed form of reference to the ''Pañca-Parameṣṭhi'', by their initials ''A+A+A+U+M'' (''{{IAST|o[[pluti|3]]}}{{IAST|m}}''). According to the ''[[Dravyasamgraha]]'' by Acharya [[Nemicandra]], ''AAAUM'' (or just ''Om'') is a one syllable short form of the initials of the five parameshthis: "''Arihant'', ''[[Ashiri]]'', ''[[Acharya]]'', ''[[Upajjhaya]]'', ''Muni''".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.cs.colostate.edu/~malaiya/om.html |title=Om – significance in Jainism, Languages and Scripts of India, Colorado State University|work=cs.colostate.edu }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=410–411}} The ''Om'' symbol is also used in ancient Jain scriptures to represent the five lines of the [[Namokara Mantra|''Ṇamōkāra'' Mantra]].{{Sfn|Agarwal|2012|p=135}}{{Sfn|Agarwal|2013|p=80}}

====Jain emblem====
In 1974, on the 2500th anniversary of the nirvana of Mahāvīra, the Jain community chose one image as an emblem to be the main identifying symbol for Jainism.{{Sfn|Robinson|2006|p=225}} The overall shape depicts the three ''loka'' ("realms of rebirth") of Jain cosmology i.e., heaven, human world and hell. The semi-circular topmost portion symbolizes ''Siddhashila'', which is a zone beyond the three realms. The Jain swastika is present in the top portion, and the symbol of ''Ahiṃsā'' in the lower portion. At the bottom of the emblem is the Jain mantra, ''[[Parasparopagraho Jivanam|Parasparopagraho Jīvānām]]''. According to Vilas Sangave, the mantra means "all life is bound together by mutual support and interdependence".{{sfn|Sangave|2001|p=123}} According to Anne Vallely, this mantra is from sūtra 5.21 of Umaswati's ''Tattvarthasūtra'', and it means "souls render service to one another".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Anne Vallely|editor=Stephen Bullivant and Michael Ruse|title=The Oxford Handbook of Atheism|url={{Google books|93VoAgAAQBAJ|page=|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}} |year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-166739-8|page=358}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Jain flag ====
[[File:Jain flag.jpg|thumb|Jain Flag]]
The five colours of the [[Jain flag]] represent the ''[[Pañca-Parameṣṭhi]]'' and the five vows, small as well as great:{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2012|p=iv}}
* White – represents the ''[[Arihant (Jainism)|arihants]]'', souls who have conquered all passions (anger, attachments, aversion) and have attained omniscience and eternal bliss through self-realisation. It also denotes peace or ''[[Ahimsa in Jainism|ahiṃsā]]'' ("non-violence ").
* Red – represents the ''[[Siddha]]'', souls that have attained salvation and truth. It also denotes ''satya''  ("truthfulness")
* Yellow – represents the [[Acharya (Jainism)|''acharya'']] the Masters of Adepts. The colour also stands for ''achaurva'' ("non-stealing").
* Green – represents the ''[[upadhyaya]]'' ("adepts"), those who teach scriptures to monks. It also signifies ''[[brahmacharya]]'' ("chastity").
* Black – represents the [[Jain ascetics]].  It also signifies ''[[aparigraha]]'' ("non-possession").

====''Ashtamangala''====
The ''[[Ashtamangala]]'' are a set of eight auspicious symbols, which are different in the Digambara and Śvētāmbar traditions.{{sfn|Titze|1998|p=234}}

In the Digambara tradition, the eight auspicious symbols are [[Chatra (umbrella)|Chatra]], ''[[Dhvaja]]'', ''[[Kalasha]]'', [[Chaamara]], [[Mirror]], Chair, [[Hand fan]] and Vessel. In the Śvētāmbar tradition, these are Swastika, ''[[Srivatsa]]'', ''[[Nandavarta]]'', ''Vardhmanaka'' ("food vessel"), ''Bhadrasana'' ("seat"), ''[[Kalasha]]'' ("pot"), ''Darpan'' ("mirror") and pair of fish.{{Sfn|Titze|1998|p=234}}

===Origins===
{{See also|Timeline of Jainism|Śramaṇa}}

The origins of Jainism are obscure.{{sfn|Rankin|Mardia|2013|p=975}}{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|p=13}} The Jains claim their religion to be eternal, and consider [[Rishabhanatha]] to be the founder in the present time-cycle, the first of 24 Jain ''tirthankaras'' in Jain belief, and someone who lived for 8,400,000 purva years.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|p=16}} According to one hypothesis, such as one by [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan]], the first vice president of India, Jainism was in existence before the Vedas were composed.{{sfn|Jambuvijaya|2002|p=114}}{{sfn|Pande|1957|p=353}} According to historians, the first 22 of the 24 ''tirthankaras'' were mythical figures. These figures were supposed to have lived more than 85,000 years ago. They were five to hundred times taller than average human beings and lived for thousands of years.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title= Rishabhanatha, in ''Encyclopaedia Britannica'' | url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Rishabhanatha |publisher=Editors of the Encyclopaedia Britannica |year=2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Sangave|2001|pp=104, 129}}{{sfn|Saraswati|1908|p=444}} The 23rd ''tirthankara'', [[Parshvanatha]], is generally accepted to be based on an ancient historic human being{{sfn|Zimmer|1953|pp=183}}&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Paul |last=Dundas |title=Jainism |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |date=2013 |url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/299478/Jainism }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Jaini|1998|p=10}} of uncertain dates, possibly 8th–7th century BCE.

Some confessional Jain scholars such as Parikh have argued that some images such as those of the bull in [[Indus Valley Civilization]] seal may be related to Jainism, but such claims are highly speculative and a subjective interpretation. This theory has not been accepted by most scholars because very little is known about the Indus Valley iconography and script.{{sfn|Long|2013|pp=53-54}} Jainism, like Buddhism, is one of the ''[[Sramana]]'' traditions of ancient India, those that rejected the [[Veda]]s and developed their own scriptures.{{sfn|Lochtefeld|2002|p=639}}&lt;ref&gt;P. Billimoria (1988), Śabdapramāṇa: Word and Knowledge, Studies of Classical India Volume 10, Springer, {{ISBN|978-94-010-7810-8}}, pages 1-30&lt;/ref&gt;

There is inscriptional evidence for the presence of Jain monks in south India by the second or first centuries BC, and archaeological evidence of Jain monks in Saurashtra in Gujarat by the second century CE.{{sfn|Cort|2010|p=202}} Statues of Jain ''tirthankara'' have been found dating back to second century BC.{{sfn|Upinder Singh|2016|p=444}}

===Political history===
[[File:Udayagiri Caves - Rani Gumpha 01.jpg|thumb|[[Udayagiri and Khandagiri Caves]] built by [[King Kharavela]] of [[Mahameghavahana dynasty]] in 2nd century BCE]]
Information regarding the political history of Jainism is uncertain and fragmentary. Jains consider the king [[Bimbisara]] (c. 558–491 BCE), [[Ajatashatru]] (c. 492–460 BCE), and [[Udayin]] (c. 460-440 BCE) of the [[Haryanka dynasty]] as a patron of Jainism.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|p=41}}

Jain tradition states that [[Chandragupta Maurya]] (322–298 BCE), the founder of the [[Mauryan Empire]] and grandfather of [[Ashoka]], became a monk and disciple of Jain ascetic [[Bhadrabahu]] during later part of his life. According to historians, Chandragupta's story appears in various versions in Buddhist, Jain, and Hindu texts.{{sfn|Mookerji|1988|pp=4–21, 232–237}} Broadly, Chandragupta was born into a humble family, abandoned, raised as a son by another family, then with the training and counsel of Chanakya of ''[[Arthashastra]]'' fame ultimately built one of the largest empires in ancient India.&lt;ref name=britchandrag&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/biography/Chandragupta Chandragupta Maurya, EMPEROR OF INDIA], Encyclopaedia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rothermund2004p63"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Roger Boesche|author=Roger Boesche|title=The First Great Political Realist: Kautilya and His Arthashastra|url={{Google books|K85NA7Rg67wC|page=|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}} |year=2003|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=978-0-7391-0607-5|pages=7–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jain history, late in his life, Chandragupta renounced the empire he built and handed over his power to his son, became a Jaina monk, and headed to meditate and pursue spirituality in the Deccan region, under the Jaina teacher Bhadrabahu at Shravanabelagola.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|p=42}} There state Jain texts, he died by fasting, a Jaina ascetic method of ending one's life by choice (''Sallenkana vrata'').&lt;ref name=britchandrag/&gt;{{sfn|Mookerji|1988|pp=39–46, 234-236}}&lt;ref name="Rothermund2004p63"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Hermann Kulke|author2=Dietmar Rothermund|title=A History of India|url={{Google books|RoW9GuFJ9GIC|page=|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}} |year=2004|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-32920-0|pages=63–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 3rd century BCE emperor Ashoka, in his pillar edicts, mentions several ancient Indian religious groups including the ''Niganthas'' (Jaina).{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|p=43}}

According to another Jain legend, King [[Salivahana]] of the late 1st century CE was a patron of Jainism, as were many others in the early centuries of the 1st millennium CE. But von Glasenapp states that the historicity of these stories is difficult to establish.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|p=51}} Archeological evidence suggests that Mathura was an important Jain centre between the 2nd century BCE and the 5th century CE. Inscriptions from the 1st and 2nd century CE show that the schism between Digambara and Śvētāmbara had already taken place.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|p=49}}

King Harshavardhana of the 7th century grew up in [[Shaivism]], following his family, but he championed Jainism, Buddhism and all traditions of Hinduism.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|p=52}} King Ama of the 8th century converted to Jainism, and the Jaina pilgrimage tradition was well established in his era.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=52-54}} Mularaja, the founder of [[Chalukya dynasty]], constructed a Jain temple, even though he was not a Jain.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|p=56}}

In the second half of the 1st century CE, Hindu kings sponsored and helped build major Jaina cave temples. For example, the Hindu [[Rashtrakuta]] dynasty started the early group of Jain temples,&lt;ref name=pereira21&gt;{{cite book|author=José Pereira|title=Monolithic Jinas|url={{Google books|LMTgiygj4-oC|page=PA24|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}}|year=1977|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-2397-6|pages=21–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Seuna (Yadava) dynasty|Yadava dynasty]] built many of the middle and later Jain group of temples at the [[Ellora Caves]] between 700 and 1000 CE.&lt;ref name=asiintro&gt;[http://asi.nic.in/asi_monu_whs_ellora.asp World Heritage Sites - Ellora Caves], Archeological Survey of India (2011), Government of India&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Madan&gt;{{cite book|title=India through the ages|last=Gopal|first=Madan|year= 1990| page= 178|editor=K.S.

===Interaction with other religions===

Buddhist texts refer to Mahāvīra as ''Nigantha Nataputta''.{{sfn|Sangave|2001|p=105}}

Beyond the times of the Mahāvīra and the Buddha, the two ascetic ''sramana'' ("seeker") religions competed for followers as well as the merchant trade networks that sustained them.{{sfn|Hirakawa|1993|pp=4–7}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jason Neelis|title=Early Buddhist Transmission and Trade Networks: Mobility and Exchange Within and Beyond the Northwestern Borderlands of South Asia|url={{Google books|GB-JV2eOr2UC|page=|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}} |year=2010|publisher=BRILL Academic|isbn=90-04-18159-8|pages=72–76}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their mutual interaction, along with those of Hindu traditions, have been significant. In some cases the titles of the Buddhist and Jaina texts are the same or similar but present different doctrines.{{sfn|Dundas|2003b|pp=ix–xi, 151–162}}

Royal patronage has been a key factor in the growth as well as the decline of Jainism.{{sfn|Natubhai Shah|2004|pp=69–70}} The Pallava King [[Mahendravarman I]] (600{{nsndns}}630 CE) converted from Jainism to Shaivism under the influence of [[Appar]].{{sfn|Lochtefeld|2002|p=409}} His work ''[[Mattavilasa Prahasana]]'' ridicules certain Shaiva sects and the Buddhists and also expresses contempt towards Jain ascetics.{{sfn|Arunachalam|1981|p=170}} Sambandar converted the contemporary [[Pandyan Dynasty|Pandya]] king to Shaivism. During the 11th century, [[Basava]], a minister to the Jain [[Kalachuris of Kalyani|Kalachuri]] king [[Bijjala II|Bijjala]], succeeded in converting numerous Jains to the [[Lingayatism|Lingayat]] Shaivite sect. The Lingayats destroyed various temples belonging to Jains and adapted them to their use.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=75–77}} The [[Hoysala Dynasty|Hoysala]] King [[Vishnuvardhana]] (c.{{nbsp}}1108{{nsndns}}1152 CE) became a follower of the [[Vaishnava]] sect under the influence of [[Ramanuja]], after which Vaishnavism grew rapidly in what is now Karnataka.{{sfn|Das|2005|p=161}}

[[File:La grotte Jain Indra Sabha Ellora Caves, India.jpg|thumb|left|The Indra Sabha cave at the [[Ellora Caves]], are co-located with Hindu and Buddhist monuments.]]
Jainism and Hinduism influenced each other. Jain texts declare some of the Hindu gods as blood relatives of legendary ''tirthankara''. Neminatha, the 22nd ''tirthankara'' for example is presented as a cousin of Krishna in Jain Puranas and other texts.&lt;ref name=britneminatha&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/biography/Arishtanemi Arishtanemi: JAINA SAINT], Encyclopaedia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Long|2009|p=42}} However, Jain scholars such as [[Haribhadra]] also wrote satires about Hindu gods, mocking them with novel outrageous stories where the gods misbehave and act unethically.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=236-237}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John R. Hinnells|title=Who's Who of World Religions|url={{Google books|CDSxCwAAQBAJ|page=PA145|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}}|year=1991|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |isbn=978-1-349-09500-1|pages=145–146}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hindu gods are presented by some Jain writers as persecuting, tempting, afraid of, or serving a legendary Jina before he gains omniscience. In other stories, one or more Jinas easily defeat the Hindu deities such as [[Vishnu]], or [[Rama]] and [[Sita]] who come to pay respect to a Jina at a major Jain pilgrimage site such as Mount Satrunjaya.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=113-115, 222-223, 236-237}}

The Jain and Hindu communities have often been very close and mutually accepting. Some Hindu temples have included a Jain ''Tirthankara'' within its premises in a place of honour.{{sfn|Long|2009|pp=5-6}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ramesh Chandra Sharma|author2=Pranati Ghosal|title=Jaina Contribution to Varanasi |url={{Google books|YoLXAAAAMAAJ|page=|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}} |year=2006|publisher=Jnanapravaha|isbn=978-81-246-0341-3|pages=100–103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly numerous temple complexes feature both Hindu and Jain monuments, with [[Badami cave temples]] and [[Khajuraho]] among some of the most well known.{{Sfn|Michell|2014|p=38-52, 60-61}}&lt;ref&gt;Trudy King et al., Asia and Oceania: International Dictionary of Historic Places, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-1884964046}}, pages 468-470&lt;/ref&gt;

Jainism faced persecution during and after the [[Muslim conquests on the Indian subcontinent]].{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=145-146, 124}} Muslims rulers, such as [[Mahmud Ghazni]] (1001), [[Mohammad Ghori]] (1175) and [[Alauddin Khalji|Ala-ud-din Muhammed Shah Khalji]] (1298) further oppressed the Jain community.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=74–75}} They vandalised idols and destroyed temples or converted them into mosques. They also burned Jain books and killed Jains. There were significant exceptions, such as Emperor [[Akbar]] (1542{{nsndns}}1605) whose legendary religious tolerance, out of respect for Jains, ordered the release of caged birds and banned the killing of animals on the Jain festival of Paryusan.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=146}} After Akbar, Jains faced an intense period of Muslim persecution in the 17th century.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=220-221}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Truschke|first=Audrey|date=2015-09-01|title=Dangerous Debates: Jain responses to theological challenges at the Mughal court*|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/modern-asian-studies/article/dangerous-debates-jain-responses-to-theological-challenges-at-the-mughal-court/8A3F928B34C46E3583FF6577968805A4|journal=Modern Asian Studies|volume=49|issue=5|pages=1311–1344|doi=10.1017/S0026749X14000055|issn=0026-749X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jain community were the traditional bankers and financiers, and this significantly impacted the Muslim rulers. However, they rarely were a part of the political power during the Islamic rule period of the Indian subcontinent.{{sfn|Cort|1998|pp=85-86}}

===Colonial era===
Colonial era reports and Christian missions variously viewed Jainism as either a sect of Hinduism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=British India|title=Various Census of India: 1871-1872|url={{Google books|4AEJAAAAQAAJ|page=|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}} |year=1867|publisher=Government of India|pages=31 note 140}}&lt;/ref&gt; or Buddhism, or as a distinct religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Edward Washburn Hopkins|title=The Religions of India|url={{Google books|O0IvAAAAYAAJ|page=PA283|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}}|year=1902|publisher=Ginn &amp; Company|page=283}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=A.J.

These criticisms, states [[John E. Cort|John Cort]], were flawed and also ignored similar practices within sects of Christianity.{{sfn|Cort|2010|pp=12-16, 200-207, 218-219, 251 with note 10}}

The British colonial government in India, as well as Indian princely states, passed laws that made monks roaming naked in streets a crime, one that led to arrest. This law particularly impacted the Digambara monks.{{sfn|Flügel|2006|pp=348–349}} The Akhil Bharatiya Jaina Samaj opposed this law, and argued that it interfered with the religious rights of Jains. Acharya [[Shantisagar]] entered Bombay (now Mumbai) in 1927, but was forced to cover his body. He then led an India-wide tour as the naked monk with his followers, to various Digambara sacred sites, and was welcomed by kings of the Maharashtra provinces.{{sfn|Flügel|2006|pp=348–349}} Shantisagar fasted to oppose the restrictions imposed on Digambara monks by the [[British Raj]] and prompted their discontinuance.{{sfn|Natubhai Shah|2004|p=56}} The colonial era laws that banned naked monks remained effective through World War II, but they were abolished by independent India after it gained independence.{{sfn|Flügel|2006|pp=359–360}}

Jainism has been praised for some of its practices and beliefs.
[[Mahatma Gandhi]], who was greatly influenced by Jainism, said:{{sfn|Rudolph|Rudolph|1984|p=171}}
{{quote|No religion in the World has explained the principle of ''Ahiṃsā'' so deeply and systematically as is discussed with its applicability in every human life in Jainism. As and when the benevolent principle of ''Ahiṃsā'' or non-violence will be ascribed for practice by the people of the world to achieve their end of life in this world and beyond, Jainism is sure to have the uppermost status and Mahāvīra is sure to be respected as the greatest authority on ''Ahiṃsā''.{{sfn|Janardan Pandey|1998|p=50}}}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5319">'''Job control''' is a person's ability to [[Social influence|influence]] what happens in his or her work environment, in particular to influence matters that are relevant to his or her personal goals. Job control may include control over work tasks, control over the work pace and physical movement, control over the social and technical environment, and freedom from supervision.

Workplace autonomy has been seen as a specialized form of the more general concept of control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ganster|first=Daniel|url=http://www.ilo.org/iloenc/part-v/psychosocial-and-organizational-factors/factors-intrinsic-to-the-job/item/18-autonomy-and-control|title=Autonomy and Control|publisher=ILO|accessdate=2015-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Workplace autonomy''' is the freedom of a person to determine what he or she does at work, and how.

== Association with other factors ==
For [[Georges Friedmann]], the quality of work depends on the employees' [[Skill (labor)|skills]] and on their capacity to control [[decision-making]] at work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.llakes.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/31.-Gallie.pdf|last=Gallie|first=Duncan|title=Skills, Job Control and the Quality of Work: The Evidence from Britain, Geary Lecture 2012|journal=The Economic and Social Review|volume=43|issue=3, Autumn|year=2012|pages=325–341}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Blauner]] found that job control is closely linked with [[occupational prestige]] and [[job satisfaction]].&lt;ref name="hollowell_2013_p85-86"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hollowell|first=Peter G|title=Lorry Driver Ils 154|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SfREAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA86|date=8 October 2013|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-136-25290-7|pages=85–86}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dunkerley_2013_p69"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dunkerley|first=David|title=The Foreman|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SjkNekNgt5cC&amp;pg=PA69|date=2 May 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-93217-6|pages=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; Job satisfaction and job control tend to be higher for [[management|managerial]] and [[professional]] workers than for unskilled workers.&lt;ref name="hollowell_2013_p85-86"/&gt;

A meta-analysis of 1986 found an association of high levels of perceived control with "high levels of job satisfaction […], [[Organizational commitment|commitment]], involvement, [[Job performance|performance]] and [[motivation]], and low levels of physical symptoms, emotional distress, role stress, [[absenteeism]], intent to turnover, and [[Turnover (employment)|turnover]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Spector|first=Paul E.|url=http://hum.sagepub.com/content/39/11/1005.abstract|title=Perceived Control by Employees: A Meta-Analysis of Studies Concerning Autonomy and Participation at Work|journal=Human Relations November|date=1986|volume=39|issue=11|pages=1005–1016|doi=10.1177/001872678603901104}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, within the [[job demands-resources model|job demands–resources model]] it is assumed that [[resource]]s such as job control counterbalance job strain and to contribute to motivation. In support of this approach, results of a 2003 study suggest that "as job demands increase, high job control is needed to limit fatigue, whereas either high job control or high job social support is needed to enhance [[intrinsic motivation|intrinsic work motivation]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=van Yperen|first1=Nico W.|last2=Hagedoorn|first2=Mariët|title=Do high job demands increase intrinsic motivation or fatigue or both? The role of job control and social support|journal=Academy of Management Journal|date=2003|volume=46|issue=3|pages=339–348|doi=10.2307/30040627}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Increasing job control is an intervention shown to help counteract [[Nervous exhaustion|exhaustion]] and [[cynicism (contemporary)|cynicism]] in the workplace, which are two symptoms of [[occupational burnout]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hatinen | first1 = M. | last2 = Kinnunen | first2 = U. | last3 = Pekkonen | first3 = M. | last4 = Kalimo | first4 = R. | year = 2007 | title = Comparing two burnout interventions: Perceived job control mediates decreases in burnout | url = | journal = International Journal of Stress Management | volume = 14 | issue = 3| pages = 227–248 | doi=10.1037/1072-5245.14.3.227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Job control has also been linked to the ''meaningfulness'' and the ''manageability'' components of [[salutogenesis]].&lt;ref name="BauerJenny2013-p81"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Georg F. Bauer|author2=Gregor J.

The '''[[Causses|Causse]] du Larzac''' is a [[limestone]] [[karst]] [[plateau]] in the south of the [[Massif Central]], [[France]], situated between [[Millau]] ([[Aveyron]]) and [[Lodève]] ([[Hérault]]). It is an agricultural area, where [[Lacaune (sheep)|sheep]] produce milk for [[Roquefort cheese]].

==Geography==
The [[communes of France|communes]] of the Larzac are:
*[[Cornus, Aveyron|Cornus]]
*[[Creissels]]
*[[La Cavalerie]]
*[[La Couvertoirade]]
*[[La Roque-Sainte-Marguerite]]

*[[Vissec]]

The Larzac is served by junctions 46 to 51 of the [[A75 autoroute]].

==History==
{{Main| Fight for the Larzac}}
In October 1970, [[Michel Debré]],  the French Minister of Defense, decided for strategic purposes to expand a military camp outside the village of La Cavalerie in the French ''[[Departments of France|département]]'' of [[Aveyron]], from 30&amp;nbsp;km² to 170&amp;nbsp;km², without consulting the local population. Local farmers objected and decided to fight against the project, through actions such as occupation of empty farms purchased by the Army in anticipation of this expansion. French syndicalist and peasant activist [[José Bové]] moved there during this period in support of the protests. Communards from the nearby Community of the Ark, led by the pacifist [[Lanza del Vasto]], were also very active in opposition to the camp. The workers of the occupied and self-managed [[Lip factory]] also took part in the movement.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flickr.com/photos/jean-paul-margnac/sets/72157594436265379/ Lip Larzac 1973 - photos]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following ten years of [[nonviolent resistance]], the plan was cancelled by President [[François Mitterrand]] after his election in 1981.

Because of its history it was chosen as the site of a massive meeting against the [[World Trade Organization]] which took place in August 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monde-solidaire.org/larzac-2003/uk/ “The World Is Not For Sale” Gathering on the Larzac against the world trade organization (8-10 August 2003)]&lt;/ref&gt; [[José Bové]] currently resides in Larzac - he secured nearly 500,000 votes in the 2007 presidential elections.

==Sights==
Five medieval fortified villages, related to the [[Knights Templar]] and the [[Knights Hospitaller]] are located on the Larzac plateau:

The '''lesser of two evils principle''' (or '''lesser evil principle''' and '''lesser-evilism''') is the principle that when faced with selecting from two immoral options, the one which is least immoral should be chosen.

== In modern elections ==
In 2012, ''[[Huffington Post]]'' columnist Sanford Jay Rosen stated that the idea became a common practice for left-leaning voters in the [[United States]] due to their overwhelming disapproval of the United States government's support for the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name=hufevil&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/sanford-jay-rosen/obama-reelection_b_1913745.html|author=Stanford Jay Rosen|title=Don't Get Fooled Again: Why Liberals and Progressives Should Vote Enthusiastically for President Obama|publisher=Huffington Post|date=2012-09-25|accessdate=2013-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rosen stated: "Beginning with the [[United States presidential election, 1968|1968 presidential election]], I often have heard from liberals that they could not vote for the lesser of two evils. Some said they would not vote; some said they would vote for a third party candidate. That mantra delivered us to Richard Nixon in [[United States presidential election, 1972|1972]] until Watergate did him in. And it delivered us to [[George W. Bush]] and [[Dick Cheney]] in [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000]] until they were termed out in 2009".&lt;ref name=hufevil /&gt; Opponents of the modern usage of these terms in reference to [[electoral politics]] include [[revolutionaries]] who oppose the existing system as a whole as well as political moderates who advocate that [[Third party (politics)|third parties]] be given greater exposure in that system. For a particular voter in an election with more than two candidates, if the voter believes the most preferred candidate cannot win, the voter may be tempted to vote for the most favored viable candidate as a [[necessary evil]] or the lesser of two evils.

Supporters of lesser-evil tactics in the United States often cite United States politician [[Ralph Nader's presidential campaigns]] as examples of what can happen when a third-party candidate receives a significant number of votes. They claim that the mere existence of the third-party candidate essentially steals votes ("tilts" or "tips the scales") from the more progressive of the two main candidates and puts the election in favor of the "worse" candidate—because the small percentage that goes towards the third party candidate is a part "wasted" that could have instead gone to the lesser-evil candidate. For example, as the [[Green Party of the United States|Green Party]] candidate in [[Ralph Nader presidential campaign, 2000|2000]], Nader garnered 2.7% of the popular vote and as a result is considered by some Democrats to have tipped the election to Bush. One counterargument is that Nader's candidacy likely increased turnout among liberals and that [[Al Gore]] took four of the five states—and thirty of the fifty-five electoral college votes—in which the outcome was decided by less than one percent of the vote. Others argue that supporters of Nader and other third party candidates draw from voters who would not vote for either Democrats or Republicans.

In the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 United States presidential election]], both major candidates of the major parties—[[Hillary Clinton]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]) and [[Donald Trump]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]])—had a disapproval rating close to 60% by August 31, 2016.&lt;ref name=washpostdislike&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/08/31/a-record-number-of-americans-now-dislike-hillary-clinton/|author=Aaron Blake|title=A record number of Americans now dislike Hillary Clinton|publisher=Washington Post|date=2016-08-31|accessdate=2016-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Green Party candidate [[Jill Stein]] invoked this idea in her campaign in her slogan "Don't vote for the lesser evil, fight for the greater good". 

In elections between only two candidates where one is mildly unpopular and the other immensely unpopular, opponents of both candidates frequently advocate a vote for the mildly unpopular candidate. For example, in the second round of the [[French presidential election, 2002|2002 French presidential election]] graffiti in Paris told people to "vote for the crook, not the fascist". The "crook" in those scribbled public messages was [[Jacques Chirac]] of [[Rally for the Republic]] and the "fascist" was [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]] of the [[National Front (France)|National Front]]. Chirac eventually won the second round having garnered 82% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/node/1109370 |title=Chirac’s new challenge |publisher=The Economist |date=2002-05-06 |accessdate=2011-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Hong Kong Chief Executive election, 2017|2017 Hong Kong Chief Executive election]], the "lesser evil" debate rose within the [[Pro-democracy camp in Hong Kong|pro-democracy camp]] as the pro-democrats did not field any candidate in order to make use of their votes in the Beijing-dominated [[Election Committee]] to boost the chance for an alternative establishment candidate. Some pro-democrats inclined to support [[John Tsang]], a relatively moderate [[pro-Beijing camp|pro-establishment]] candidate to prevent a perceived hardliner [[Carrie Lam]] from winning. Radical pro-democracy legislator [[Leung Kwok-hung]] refuted the "lesser evil" strategy, thinking it would cost the pro-democrats' moral high ground and announced his own candidacy in order to persuade the pro-democrat electors from voting for Tsang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=‘Long Hair’ Leung Kwok-hung enters chief executive race, urging allies not to vote for ‘lesser evils’|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/2069091/long-hair-leung-kwok-hung-enters-ce-race-urging-allies-not-vote|date=8 February 2017|newspaper=South China Morning Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mythology ==
"[[Between Scylla and Charybdis]]" is an idiom derived from [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]''. In the story, [[Odysseus]] chose to go near [[Scylla]] as the lesser of two evils. He lost six of his companions, but if he had gone near [[Charybdis]] all would be doomed. Because of such stories, having to navigate between the two hazards eventually entered idiomatic use. Another equivalent English seafaring phrase is "Between a rock and a hard place".&lt;ref&gt;Definition from the ''Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English'' [http://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/Scylla-and-Charybdis available online]&lt;/ref&gt; The Latin line ''incidit in scyllam cupiens vitare charybdim'' ("he runs into Scylla, wishing to avoid Charybdis") had earlier become proverbial, with a meaning much the same as [[jumping from the frying pan into the fire]]. [[Erasmus]] recorded it as an ancient proverb in his ''[[Adagia]]'', although the earliest known instance is in the ''[[Alexandreis]]'', a 12th-century Latin [[epic poetry|epic poem]] by [[Walter of Châtillon]].&lt;ref&gt;Noted by [[Edward Charles Harington]] in [https://books.google.com/books?id=7mIEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA10 ''Notes and Queries'' 5th Series, '''8''' (7 July 1877:14)].&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10153">{{distinguish|Coordinate lines}}
In [[geometry]], '''line coordinates''' are used to specify the position of a [[Line (geometry)|line]] just as point coordinates (or simply [[Coordinate system|coordinates]]) are used to specify the position of a point.

==Lines in the plane==
There are several possible ways to specify the position of a line in the plane. A simple way is by the pair {{nowrap|(''m'', ''b'')}} where the equation of the line is ''y''&amp;nbsp;= ''mx''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''b''. Here ''m'' is the [[slope]] and ''b'' is the [[y-intercept|''y''-intercept]]. This system specifies coordinates for all lines that are not vertical. However, it is more common and simpler algebraically to use coordinates {{nowrap|(''l'', ''m'')}} where the equation of the line is ''lx''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''my''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0. This system specifies coordinates for all lines except those that pass through the origin. The geometrical interpretations of ''l'' and ''m'' are the negative reciprocals of the ''x'' and [[y-intercept|''y''-intercept]] respectively.

The exclusion of lines passing through the origin can be resolved by using a system of three coordinates {{nowrap|(''l'', ''m'', ''n'')}} to specify the line in which the equation, ''lx''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''my''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0. Here ''l'' and ''m'' may not both be 0. In this equation, only the ratios between ''l'', ''m'' and ''n'' are significant, in other words if the coordinates are multiplied by a non-zero scalar then line represented remains the same. So {{nowrap|(''l'', ''m'', ''n'')}} is a system of [[homogeneous coordinates]] for the line.

If points in the [[real projective plane]] are represented by homogeneous coordinates {{nowrap|(''x'', ''y'', ''z'')}}, the equation of the line is ''lx''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''my''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''nz''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, provided {{nowrap|(''l'', ''m'', ''n'') ≠ (0,0,0) .}} In particular, line coordinate {{nowrap|(0, 0, 1)}} represents the line ''z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, which is the [[line at infinity]] in the [[projective plane]]. Line coordinates {{nowrap|(0, 1, 0)}} and {{nowrap|(1, 0, 0)}} represent the ''x'' and ''y''-axes respectively.

==Tangential equations==
Just as ''f''(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 can represent a [[curve]] as a subset of the points in the plane, the equation φ(''l'',&amp;nbsp;''m'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 represents a subset of the lines on the plane. The set of lines on the plane may, in an abstract sense, be thought of as the set of points in a projective plane, the [[Duality (projective geometry)|dual]] of the original plane. The equation φ(''l'',&amp;nbsp;''m'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 then represents a curve in the dual plane. 

For a curve ''f''(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 in the plane, the [[tangent]]s to the curve form a curve in the dual space called the [[dual curve]]. If φ(''l'',&amp;nbsp;''m'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 is the equation of the dual curve, then it is called the '''tangential equation''', for the original curve. A given equation φ(''l'',&amp;nbsp;''m'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 represents a curve in the original plane determined as the [[Envelope (mathematics)|envelope]] of the lines that satisfy this equation. Similarly, if φ(''l'',&amp;nbsp;''m'',&amp;nbsp;''n'') is a [[homogeneous function]] then φ(''l'',&amp;nbsp;''m'',&amp;nbsp;''n'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 represents a curve in the dual space given in homogeneous coordinates, and may be called the homogeneous tangential equation of the enveloped curve.

Tangential equations are useful in the study of curves defined as envelopes, just as Cartesian equations are useful in the study of curves defined as loci.

==Tangential equation of a point==
A linear equation in line coordinates has the form ''al''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''bm''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''c''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, where ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' are constants. Suppose (''l'',&amp;nbsp;''m'') is a line that satisfies this equation. If ''c'' is not 0 then ''lx''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''my''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, where ''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''a''/''c'' and ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''b''/''c'', so every line satisfying the original equation passes though the point (''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y''). Conversely, any line through (''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'') satisfies the original equation, so ''al''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''bm''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''c''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 is the equation of set of lines through (''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y''). For a given point (''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y''), the equation of the set of lines though it is ''lx''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''my''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, so this may be defined as the tangential equation of the point. Similarly, for a point (''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'',&amp;nbsp;''z'') given in homogeneous coordinates, the equation of the point in homogeneous tangential coordinates is ''lx''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''my''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''nz''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.

==Formulas==
The intersection of the lines (''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and (''l''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is the solution to the linear equations 

:&lt;math&gt;l_1x+m_1y+1=0&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;l_2x+m_2y+1=0.&lt;/math&gt;

By [[Cramer's rule]], the solution is

:&lt;math&gt;x=\frac{m_1-m_2}{l_1m_2-l_2m_1},\,y=-\frac{l_1-l_2}{l_1m_2-l_2m_1}.&lt;/math&gt;

The lines (''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), (''l''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and (''l''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''m''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) are [[Concurrent lines|concurrent]] when the [[determinant]]

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{vmatrix}
  l_1 &amp; m_1 &amp; 1 \\
  l_2 &amp; m_2 &amp; 1 \\
  l_3 &amp; m_3 &amp; 1
\end{vmatrix}=0.&lt;/math&gt;

For homogeneous coordinates, the intersection of the lines (''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and (''l''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is

:&lt;math&gt;(m_1n_2-m_2n_1,\,l_2n_1-l_1n_2,\,l_1m_2-l_2m_1).&lt;/math&gt;

The lines (''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), (''l''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and (''l''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''m''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) are [[Concurrent lines|concurrent]] when the [[determinant]]

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{vmatrix}
  l_1 &amp; m_1 &amp; n_1 \\
  l_2 &amp; m_2 &amp; n_2 \\
  l_3 &amp; m_3 &amp; n_3
\end{vmatrix}=0.&lt;/math&gt;

Dually, the coordinates of the line containing (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''z''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and (''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) are
:&lt;math&gt;(y_1z_2-y_2z_1,\,x_2z_1-x_1z_2,\,x_1y_2-x_2y_1).&lt;/math&gt;

==Lines in three-dimensional space==
{{main|Plücker coordinates}}
For two given points in the [[real projective plane]], (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''z''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and (''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), the three determinants

:&lt;math&gt;y_1z_2-y_2z_1,\,x_2z_1-x_1z_2,\,x_1y_2-x_2y_1&lt;/math&gt;

determine the [[projective line]] containing them.

Similarly, for two points in '''RP'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;,  (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''z''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''w''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and (''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''w''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), the line containing them is determined by the six determinants 

:&lt;math&gt;x_1y_2-x_2y_1,\,x_1z_2-x_1z_2,\,y_1z_2-y_2z_1,\,x_1w_2-x_2w_1,\,y_1w_2-y_2w_1,\,z_1w_2-z_2w_1.&lt;/math&gt;

This is the basis for a system of homogeneous line coordinates in three-dimensional space called ''Plücker coordinates''. Six numbers in a set of coordinates only represent a line when they satisfy an additional equation. This system maps the space of lines in three-dimensional space to [[projective space]] '''RP'''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;, but with the additional requirement the space of lines corresponds to the [[Klein quadric]], which is a [[manifold]] of dimension four.

More generally, the lines in ''n''-dimensional projective space are determined by a system of ''n''(''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)/2 homogeneous coordinates that satisfy a set of (''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;2)(''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;3)/2 conditions, resulting in a manifold of dimension&amp;nbsp;2(''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1).

==With complex numbers==
[[Isaak Yaglom]] has shown&lt;ref name=Yaglom68&gt;[[Isaak Yaglom]] (1968) ''Complex Numbers in Geometry'', [[Academic Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; how [[dual number]]s provide coordinates for oriented lines in the Euclidean plane, and [[split-complex number]]s form line coordinates for the [[hyperbolic plane]]. The coordinates depend on the presence of an origin and reference line on it. Then, given an arbitrary line its coordinates are found from the intersection with the reference line. The distance ''s'' from the origin to the intersection and the angle &amp;theta; of inclination between the two lines are used:
:&lt;math&gt;z = (\tan \frac {\theta}{2}) (1 + s \epsilon)&lt;/math&gt; is the dual number&lt;ref name=Yaglom68/&gt;{{rp|81}} for a Euclidean line, and

:&lt;math&gt;z = (\tan \frac {\theta}{2}) (\cosh s + j \sinh s)&lt;/math&gt; is the split-complex number&lt;ref name=Yaglom68/&gt;{{rp|118}} for a line in the Lobachevski plane.

Since there are lines ultraparallel to the reference line in the Lobachevski plane, they need coordinates too: There is a unique [[ultraparallel theorem|common perpendicular]], say ''s'' is the distance from the origin to this perpendicular, and ''d'' is the length of the segment between reference and the given line.
:&lt;math&gt;z = (\tanh \frac {d}{2}) (\sinh s + j \cosh s)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the ultraparallel line.&lt;ref name=Yaglom68/&gt;{{rp|118}}

The motions of the line geometry are described with [[linear fractional transformation]]s on the appropriate complex planes.&lt;ref name=Yaglom68/&gt;{{rp|87,123}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1927">In [[mathematics]], a sequence {{math|''a''}} = {{math| (''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} of nonnegative real numbers is called a '''logarithmically concave sequence''', or a '''log-concave sequence''' for short, if {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ≥ ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''−1&lt;/sub&gt;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''+1&lt;/sub&gt;}} holds for {{math|0 &lt; ''i'' &lt; ''n'' }}.

'''Remark:''' some authors (explicitly or not) add two further hypotheses in the definition of log-concave sequences:
* {{math|''a''}}  is non-negative
* {{math|''a''}}  has no internal zeros; in other words, the support of {{math|''a''}} is an interval of {{math|'''Z'''}}.
These hypotheses mirror the ones required for [[Logarithmically_concave_function|log-concave functions]].

Sequences that fulfill the three conditions are also called '''Pòlya Frequency sequences of order 2''' ('''PF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''' sequences). Refer to chapter 2 of &lt;ref name="brenti"&gt;Brenti, F. (1989). Unimodal Log-Concave and Pòlya Frequency Sequences in Combinatorics. American Mathematical Society.&lt;/ref&gt; for a discussion on the two notions. 
For instance, the sequence {{math|(1,1,0,0,1)}} checks the concavity inequalities but not the internal zeros condition.

Examples of log-concave sequences are given by the [[binomial coefficient]]s along any row of [[Pascal's triangle]] and the [[Newton's inequalities|elementary symmetric means]] of a finite sequence of real numbers.

==Early life==
Beddoe came from a military family. He was born in Abyad, [[Egypt]],&lt;ref name="“telegraph.co.uk"/&gt; where his father, [[World War II]] veteran Lieutenant Colonel Arthur Beddoe&lt;ref name="“wishful-thinking.org"&gt;{{cite news |title=WW2 Memorial Great Rissington, Gloucestershire, St John the Baptist's Churchyard |url=http://places.wishful-thinking.org.uk/GLS/GreatRissington/MIs.html |accessdate=5 September 2017 |date=5 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; was serving at the time of his birth.&lt;ref name="“nationalarchives.gov.uk"&gt;{{cite news |title=Welsh Regiment: 1/4th Battalion |url=http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C675408 |accessdate=5 September 2017 |date=5 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father had a very distinguished military career and before his posting to Egypt was an infantry battalion commanding officer in [[Welsh Regiment]] during the [[Second World War]]. Judge Beddoe takes pride in his Welsh heritage.&lt;ref name="“ww1infantrycos.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news |title=Parole Board of England and Wales |url=http://www.ww1infantrycos.co.uk/welshreg.html |accessdate=5 September 2017 |date=5 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career at the Bar==
Beddoe was educated at [[Tonbridge School]] and [[Peterhouse, Cambridge]]. He was [[called to the bar]] as a member of [[Gray's Inn]] in 1979 and thereafter practised as a [[barrister]] at 36 Bedford Row chambers&lt;ref name="“36group.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news |title=36 Bedford Row: Former Members |url=https://36group.co.uk/door-tenants-former-members |accessdate=15 August 2017 |date=15 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he practised from 1980 specialising in [[prosecution]] work, including prosecution of several cases of fraud, [[tax evasion]], [[organised crime]] and murder, until 2005,&lt;ref name="“www.thegovernmentsays.com"&gt;{{cite news |title=14 December 2007 Judicial Appointments |url=http://www.thegovernmentsays.com/history/2007-12-14 |accessdate=15 August 2017 |date=15 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; when he was appointed Standing Counsel to the [[Revenue and Customs Prosecutions Office]].&lt;ref name="“telegraph.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="“lexisweb.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news |title=R v Cornfield: Martin Beddoe instructed by the Revenue and Customs Prosecutions Office for the Revenue |url=http://lexisweb.co.uk/cases/2006/october/r-v-cornfield |accessdate=15 August 2017 |date=15 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served in that capacity until December 2007, when he was appointed circuit judge.&lt;ref name="“www.m2.com"&gt;{{cite news |title=Appointment of a Circuit Judge – His Honour Judge Beddoe |url=http://www.m2.com/m2/web/story.php/20072A1F22F550AC51A0802573B100011AA1 |accessdate=15 August 2017 |date=15 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Standing Counsel to HMRC===
Beddoe served as a Standing Counsel to the [[Revenue and Customs Prosecutions Office]] for 3 years, until December 2007, dealing with numerous high level drug importations and diversion cases, including some of the largest fraud prosecutions in the country such as the largest diversion fraud ever prosecuted at the time.&lt;ref name="“telegraph.co.uk"/&gt;

===Prosecutor===
Beddoe was a senior prosecutor in [[Peterborough]] Crown Court, Cambridgeshire. Throughout his career he successfully prosecuted many criminal cases including prosecution of a fraudster who was found guilty of involvement in a £1.5&amp;nbsp;million fraud in 2002,&lt;ref name="“worksopguardian.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news |title=Fraudster on the run|url=http://www.worksopguardian.co.uk/news/fraudster-on-the-run-1-626865 |accessdate=16 August 2017 |date=16 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a solicitor who plead guilty to stealing £350,000 in fees from clients in 2005.&lt;ref name="“www.bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news |title=Solicitor pleads guilty to theft |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/leicestershire/4634803.stm |accessdate=16 August 2017 |date=16 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Solicitor Christopher McChrystal was arrested in October 2004 after the [[Law Society]] referred his case to the police.&lt;ref name="“www.solicitorstribunal.org.uk"&gt;{{cite news |title=www.solicitorstribunal.org.uk |url=http://www.solicitorstribunal.org.uk/sites/default/files-sdt/9159-2004%20-%20McChrystal.pdf |accessdate=16 August 2017 |date=16 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; McChrystal was subsequently struck off after Lincoln Crown Court's finding that he used the clients' money to make an investment into his business.&lt;ref name="“www.solicitorstribunal.org.uk"/&gt; In 2003 Beddoe was a senior prosecutor in court cases resulting from Operation Harrier,&lt;ref name="“justiceinspectorates.gov.uk"&gt;{{cite news |title=THE INSPECTORATE'S REPORT ON CPS CAMBRIDGESHIRE |url=http://www.justiceinspectorates.gov.uk/crown-prosecution-service/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2014/04/Cambs0103Rep.pdf |accessdate=16 August 2017 |date=16 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; a clean-up operation which has declared all-out war against Class A drugs in [[Peterborough]], Cambridgeshire.&lt;ref name="“peterboroughtoday.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news |title=A TEAM of prosecutors has moved into a city police station to deal with the mass arrests resulting from drugs crackdown Operation Harrier |url=http://www.peterboroughtoday.co.uk/news/environment/crime-extra-lawyers-to-handle-mass-drug-arrests-1-101561|accessdate=16 August 2017 |date=16 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defence counsel===
Beddoe has defended at the criminal bar in drug cases, fraud, homicide and other serious crime.&lt;ref name="“zoominfo"&gt;{{cite news |title=Martin Beddoe: barrister |url=https://www.zoominfo.com/p/Martin-Beddoe/636223420 |accessdate=15 October 2017 |date=15 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also dealt with Courts Martial, Inquests and Public Enquiries. In 2005 he successfully defended Jason Smith, British soldier who served eight years in the British Army. The court heard that Smith's successful Army career was halted prematurely due to a back injury and he had struggled to come to terms with it. In March 2005, as a result of his post-traumatic stress disorder, Smith had carried out a raid of a petrol station in Northampton at knife-point, but later dropped 45 in cash as the owner and several villagers gave chase.&lt;ref name="“northamptonchron.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news |title=A FORMER soldier who saw active service in Bosnia and Northern Ireland has escaped a prison sentence for an armed robbery at a petrol station in a Northamptonshire village |url=http://www.northamptonchron.co.uk/news/no-jail-term-after-petrol-station-raid-1-909379 |accessdate=15 October 2017 |date=15 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sentencing Jason Smith to a two-year suspended sentence, Judge Nigel Daly told him: {{quote|It is the first time you have been in court and you are of previous good character and here you are in relation to a very serious offence. You had considerable problems with your finances and then suffered a reactive depression brought on by the spiralling debts.&lt;ref name="“northamptonchron.co.uk"/&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9628">The '''signature''' {{nowrap|(''v'', ''p'', ''r'')}} of a [[metric tensor]] ''g'' (or equivalently, a real [[quadratic form]] thought of as a real [[symmetric bilinear form]] on a finite-dimensional vector space) is the number (counted with multiplicity) of positive, zero, and negative [[eigenvalue]]s of the real [[symmetric matrix]] {{nowrap|''g''&lt;sub&gt;''ab''&lt;/sub&gt;}}  of the metric tensor with respect to a [[Basis (linear algebra)|basis]]. In physics, the ''v'' represents for the time or virtual dimension, and the ''p'' for the space and physical dimension. Alternatively, it can be defined as the dimensions of a maximal positive and null subspace. By [[Sylvester's law of inertia]] these numbers do not depend on the choice of basis. The signature thus classifies the metric up to a choice of basis. The signature is often denoted by a pair of integers {{nowrap|(''v'', ''p'')}} implying ''r'' = 0 or as an explicit list of signs of eigenvalues such as {{nowrap|(+, −, −, −)}} or {{nowrap|(−, +, +, +)}} for the signature {{nowrap|(1, 3, 0)}}, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Rowland, Todd. "Matrix Signature." From MathWorld--A Wolfram Web Resource, created by Eric W. Weisstein. http://mathworld.wolfram.com/MatrixSignature.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The signature is said to be '''indefinite''' or '''mixed''' if both ''v'' and ''p'' are nonzero, and degenerate if ''r'' is nonzero. A [[Riemannian metric]] is a metric with a [[definite bilinear form|positive definite]] signature {{nowrap|(''v'', p)}}. The [[Lorentz metric|Lorentzian metric]] is a metric signature {{nowrap|(''v'', ''p'')}} with two eigenvalues.

There is another notion of '''signature''' of a nondegenerate metric tensor given by a single number ''s'' defined as {{nowrap|(''v''−''p'')}}, where ''v'' and ''p'' are as above, which is equivalent to the above definition when the dimension ''n'' = ''v'' + ''p'' is given or implicit.  For example, ''s'' = 1 − 3 = −2 for {{nowrap|(+, −, −, −)}} and its mirroring ''s' '' = −''s'' = +2 for {{nowrap|(−, +, +, +)}}.

== Definition ==
The signature of a metric tensor is defined as the signature of the corresponding [[quadratic form]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Landau|first1=L.D.|authorlink1=Lev Landau|last2=Lifshitz|first2=E.M.|authorlink2=Evgeny Lifshitz|title=The Classical Theory of Fields|series=Course of Theoretical Physics|volume=2|edition=4th|publisher=[[Butterworth&amp;ndash;Heinemann]]|isbn=0 7506 2768 9|year=2002|orig-year=1939|pages=245&amp;ndash;246}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the number {{nowrap|(''v'', ''p'', ''r'')}} of positive and zero [[eigenvalues]] of any matrix (i.e. in any basis for the underlying vector space) representing the form, counted with their [[algebraic multiplicity]]. Usually, {{nowrap|''r'' {{=}} 0}} is required, which is the same as saying a metric tensor must be nondegenerate, i.e. no nonzero vector is orthogonal to all vectors.

By Sylvester's law of inertia, the numbers {{nowrap|(''v'', ''p'', ''r'')}} are basis independent.

== Properties ==

=== Signature and dimension ===
By the [[spectral theorem]] a symmetric ''n'' × ''n'' matrix over the reals is always [[diagonalizable]], and has therefore exactly ''n'' real eigenvalues (counted with [[algebraic multiplicity]]). Thus {{nowrap|1=''v'' + ''p'' = ''n'' = dim(''V'')}}.

=== Sylvester's law of inertia: independence of basis choice and existence of orthonormal basis ===
According to [[Sylvester's law of inertia]], the signature of the scalar product  (a.k.a. real symmetric bilinear form), ''g'' does not depend on the choice of basis. Moreover, for every metric ''g'' of signature {{nowrap|(''v'', ''p'', ''r'')}} there exists a basis such that 
{{nowrap|1=''g''&lt;sub&gt;''ab''&lt;/sub&gt; = +1}} for {{nowrap|1=''a'' = ''b'' = 1, ..., ''v''}}, {{nowrap|1=''g''&lt;sub&gt;''ab''&lt;/sub&gt; = −1}} for {{nowrap|1=''a'' = ''b'' = ''v'' + 1, ..., ''v'' + ''p''}} and {{nowrap|1=''g''&lt;sub&gt;''ab''&lt;/sub&gt; = 0}} otherwise. It follows that there exists an [[isometry]] {{nowrap|(''V''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) → (''V''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)}} if and only if the signatures of ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are equal.  Likewise the signature is equal for two [[congruent matrices]] and classifies a matrix up to congruency. Equivalently, the signature is constant on the orbits of the general linear group GL(''V'') on the space of symmetric rank 2 contravariant tensors ''S''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; and classifies each orbit.

===Geometrical interpretation of the indices ===
The number ''v'' (resp.  ''p'') is the maximal dimension of a vector subspace on which the scalar product ''g'' is positive-definite (resp. negative-definite), and ''r'' is the dimension of the [[Symmetric bilinear form#Orthogonality and singularity|radical]] of the scalar product ''g'' or the [[null space|null subspace]] of [[symmetric matrix]] {{nowrap|''g''&lt;sub&gt;''ab''&lt;/sub&gt;}} of the [[scalar product]]. Thus a nondegenerate scalar product has signature {{nowrap|(''v'', ''p'', 0)}}, with {{nowrap|1=''v'' + ''p'' = ''n''}}. A duality of the special cases {{nowrap|(''v'', ''p'', 0)}} correspond to two scalar eigenvalues which can be transformed into each other by the mirroring reciprocally.

== Examples ==

=== Matrices ===
The signature of the {{nowrap|''n'' × ''n''}} [[identity matrix]] is {{nowrap|(''v'', ''p'', 0)}} where {{nowrap|1=''n'' = ''v'' + ''p''}}. The [[diagonal matrix]] of a signature is the number of positive, negative and zero numbers on its [[main diagonal]].

The following matrices have both the same signature {{nowrap|(1, 1, 0)}}, therefore they are congruent because of [[Sylvester's law of inertia]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 0  \\ 0 &amp; -1 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; 1  \\ 1 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix}. &lt;/math&gt;

=== Scalar products ===
The standard [[scalar product]] defined on &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{R}^n &lt;/math&gt; has the n-dimensional signatures {{nowrap|(''v'', ''p'', ''r'')}}, where {{nowrap|1=''v'' + ''p'' = ''n''}} and rank {{nowrap|1=''r ''=''0''}}.

In physics, the [[Minkowski space]] is a spacetime manifold &lt;math&gt;\R^4&lt;/math&gt; with ''v=1'' and ''p=3'' bases, and has a scalar product defined by either the &lt;math&gt;\check g&lt;/math&gt; matrix:
:&lt;math&gt;\check g=\begin{pmatrix} -1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;
which has signature &lt;math&gt;(1, 3, 0)^-&lt;/math&gt; and known as space-supremacy or space-like; Or the mirroring signature &lt;math&gt;(1,3, 0)^+&lt;/math&gt;, known virtual-supremacy or time-like with the &lt;math&gt;\hat g&lt;/math&gt; matrix. 
:&lt;math&gt;\hat g=\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 \end{pmatrix}=-\check g&lt;/math&gt;

== How to compute the signature ==
There are some methods for computing the signature of a matrix.
* For any [[nondegenerate]] [[symmetric matrix]] of {{nowrap|''n'' × ''n''}}, [[Matrix diagonalization|diagonalize]] it (or find all of [[eigenvalue]]s of it) and count the number of positive and negative signs.
* For a symmetric matrix, the characteristic polynomial will have all real roots whose signs may in some cases be completely determined by [[Descartes' rule of signs]].
* Lagrange algorithm gives a way to compute an [[orthogonal basis]], and thus compute a diagonal matrix congruent (thus, with the same signature) to the other one: the signature of a diagonal matrix is the number of positive, negative and zero elements on its diagonal.
* According to Jacobi's criterion, a symmetric matrix is positive-definite if and only if all the determinants of its main minors are positive.

== Signature in physics ==
In mathematics, the usual convention for any [[Riemannian manifold]] is to use a positive-definite [[metric tensor]] (meaning that after diagonalization, elements on the diagonal are all positive).

In [[theoretical physics]], [[spacetime]] is modeled by a [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]].  The signature counts how many time-like or space-like characters are in the spacetime, in the sense defined by [[special relativity]]: as used in [[particle physics]], the metric has an eigenvalue on the time-like subspace, and its mirroring eigenvalue on the space-like subspace.
In the specific case of the [[Minkowski space|Minkowski metric]],
: &lt;math&gt; ds^2 = c^2 dt^2 - dx^2 - dy^2 - dz^2 &lt;/math&gt; ,
the metric signature is &lt;math&gt;(1, 3, 0)^+&lt;/math&gt; or (+, −, −, −) if its eigenvalue is defined in the time direction, or &lt;math&gt;(1, 3, 0)^-&lt;/math&gt; or (−, +, +, +) if the eigenvalue is defined in the three spatial directions ''x'', ''y'' and ''z''. 
(Sometimes the opposite [[Sign (mathematics)|sign]] convention is used, but with the one given here ''s'' directly measures [[proper time]].)

==Signature change==
If a metric is regular everywhere then the signature of the metric is constant. However if one allows for metrics that are degenerate or discontinuous on some hypersurfaces, then signature of the metric may change at these surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

'''Military democracy''' is a term used to describe the war-based society of historical peoples. An example is [[Frederick Engels]]' characterization:

{{cquote|"The military commander, the council, and the popular assembly formed the organs of military democracy, military because war and the organization of war were now the regular functions of life of the people. The wealth of their neighbors excited the greed of the peoples, who began to regard acquisition of wealth as one of the main purposes in life. They were barbarians: plunder appeared to them easier and even more honorable than productive work. War, once waged simply to avenge aggression or as a means of enlarging territory that had become inadequate, was now waged for the sake of plunder alone, and became a regular profession. . . . The growth of slavery had already begun to brand working for a living as slavish and more ignominious than engaging in plunder."&lt;ref name=Helfen-191&gt;{{cite book|author=Otto Maenchen-Helfen|title=The World of the Huns: Studies in Their History and Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CrUdgzSICxcC&amp;pg=PA191|year=1973|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-01596-8|pages=191–}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

According to Engels, the [[Greek Heroic Age]] was a typical example of military democracy.&lt;ref name=Helfen-191/&gt; [[Lewis Henry Morgan]] spoke of two features: "the military state of society, and the system of administration consisting of an elective and removable supreme chief, a council of elders and a popular assembly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Yu.

'''Mortality salience''' is the awareness by an individual that his or her [[death]] is inevitable.

The term derives from [[terror management theory]], which proposes that mortality salience causes existential [[anxiety]] that may be buffered by an individual's cultural worldview and/or sense of [[self-esteem]].

==Terror management theory==

{{Main|Terror management theory}}

Mortality salience engages the conflict that humans have to face both their instinct to avoid death completely, and their intellectual knowledge that avoiding death is ultimately futile.  According to terror management theory, when human beings begin to contemplate their mortality and their vulnerability to death, feelings of terror emerge because of the simple fact that humans want to avoid their inevitable death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Whitley |first=Bernard |last2=Kite |first2=Mary |date=2010 |title=The Psychology of Prejudice and Discrimination (2 ed.) |url= |location=Belmont, CA |publisher=Wadsworth |pages=251–254 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mortality salience comes into effect, because humans contribute all of their actions to either avoiding death or distracting themselves from the contemplation of it. Thus, terror management theory asserts that almost all human activity is driven by the [[fear of death]].

Most research done on terror management theory revolves around the mortality salience paradigm. It has been found that religious individuals as well as religious [[Fundamentalism|fundamentalists]] are less vulnerable to mortality salience manipulations, and so religious believers engage in cultural worldview defense to a lesser extent than nonreligious individuals.&lt;ref name="Wojtkowiak"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wojtkowiak |first=Joanna |last2=Rutjens |first2=Bastiaan T. |date=2011 |title=The postself and terror management theory: Reflecting on after death identity buffers existential threat |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508619.2011.557008 |journal=The International Journal for the Psychology of Religion |publisher=Routledge |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=137–144 |doi=10.1080/10508619.2011.557008 |access-date=October 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Self-esteem==

Mortality salience is highly manipulated by one's self-esteem. Individuals with low self-esteem are more apt to experience the effects of mortality salience, whereas individuals with high self-esteem are better able to cope with the idea that their death is uncontrollable. As an article states, "according to terror management theory, increased self-esteem should enhance the functioning of the cultural anxiety buffer and thereby provide protection against death concerns".&lt;ref name=terror&gt;{{cite journal |last=Harmon-Jones |first=Eddie |last2=Simon |first2=Linda |last3=Greenberg |first3=Jeff |last4=Pyszczynski |first4=Tom |last5=Solomon |first5=Sheldon |last6=McGregor |first6=Holly |date=1997 |title=Terror management theory and self-esteem: Evidence that increased self-esteem reduces mortailty salience effects |url=http://www.socialemotiveneuroscience.org/pubs/hj_etal97tm.pdf |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |publisher=American Psychological Association |volume=72 |issue=1 |pages=24–36 |doi= 10.1037/0022-3514.72.1.24|access-date=October 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Potential to cause worldview defense==

Mortality salience has the potential to cause worldview defense, a psychological mechanism that strengthens people's connection with their [[in-group]] as a [[defense mechanism]]. Studies also show that mortality salience can lead people to feel more inclined to punish minor moral transgressions. One such study divided a group of judges into two groups—one that was asked to reflect upon their own mortality, and one group that was not. The judges were then asked to set a bond for an alleged prostitute. The group that had reflected on mortality set an average bond of $455, while the control group's average bond was $50.&lt;ref name="wakeof911"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pyszczynski|first=Thomas|author2=Jeff Greenberg |author3=Sheldon Solomon |title=In the Wake of 9/11: The Psychology of Terror |publisher=American Psychological Association|date=2003|isbn= 9781557989543|url=https://books.google.com/?id=IaCgHQAACAAJ&amp;dq=in+the+wake+of+9/11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study found that mortality salience could cause an increase in support for martyrdom and military intervention. It found that students who had reflected on their mortality showed preference towards people who supported martyrdom, and indicated they might consider martyrdom themselves. They also found that, especially among students who were politically conservative, mortality salience increased support for military intervention, but not among students who were politically liberal.&lt;ref name="martyrdom"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pyszczynski|first=Tom|author2=Abdolhossein Abdollahi |author3=Sheldon Solomon |author4=Jeff Greenberg |author5=Florette Cohen |author6=David Weise |title=Mortality Salience, Martyrdom, and Military Might: The Great Satan Versus the Axis of Evil |journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|publisher=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|volume=32|issue=4|url=http://psp.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/32/4/525|accessdate=2009-04-07|pmid=16513804|doi=10.1177/0146167205282157|year=2006|pages=525–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender, emotion and sex==

A study tested "the hypothesis that mortality salience intensifies gender differences in reactions to sexual and emotional infidelity". In the study, participants were asked to work through packets that had mortality salience manipulation questions in each. In the results, they found that "sex is more relevant to the self-esteem of men than women and being in a committed relationship is relatively more important to women than for men". Therefore, when linking mortality salience to [[gender]], [[emotion]], and [[sex]], men are more likely to suffer from sexual infidelity, and women are more likely to suffer from emotional infidelity. The results of this study showed that there is a logistic regression revealing a significant three-way interaction between gender, sex value, and mortality salience for the item pitting "passionate sex" against "emotional attachment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Goldenberg |first=Jamie |last2=Landau |first2=Mark J. |last3=Pyszczynski |first3=Tom |last4=Cox |first4=Cathy R. |last5=Greenberg |first5=Jeff |last6=Solomon |first6=Sheldon |last7=Dunnam |first7=Heather |date=December 2003 |title=Gender-Typical Response to Sexual and Emotional Infidelity as a Function of Mortality Salience Induced Self-Esteemed Striving |url=http://psp.sagepub.com/content/29/12/1585.abstract |journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin |publisher=Society for Personality and Social Psychology |volume=29 |issue=12 |pages=1585–1595 |doi=10.1177/0146167203256880 |access-date=October 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Individuals exposed to near-death experiences==

With mortality salience, humans who have encountered [[near-death experiences]] develop a greater sense of self and meaning to life. It has been shown that individuals who face these experiences tend to invest more into relationships, political beliefs, religious beliefs, and other beliefs over material things. As a patient with AIDS shared, "Because of my illness I have nothing to hide. It has freed me because now I am completely honest".{{citation need|date=October 2015}} Developing a cultural worldview provides humans with comfort from the thought of their own inevitable death. This coping mechanism has shown to highly improve the self-worth of humans and highly alleviates existential anxiety.

{{Governance}}
{{distinguish redirect|Open source government|Adoption of free and open-source software by public institutions{{!}}Open source software in government}}
'''Open-source governance''' (also known as '''open politics''') is a [[political philosophy]] which advocates the application of the philosophies of the [[open-source]] and [[open-content]] movements to [[democracy|democratic]] principles to enable any interested citizen to add to the creation of policy, as with a [[wiki]] document. Legislation is democratically opened to the general citizenry, employing their [[collective wisdom]] to benefit the decision-making process and improve democracy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=450zYUjsPNQC&amp;pg=PT56 Open-source democracy: how online communication is changing offline politics] by [[Douglas Rushkoff]], published by [[Demos (UK think tank)|Demos]]. Page 56 et al&lt;/ref&gt;

Theories on how to constrain, limit or enable this participation vary.  Accordingly, there is no one dominant theory of how to go about authoring legislation with this approach. There are a wide array of projects and movements which are working on building open-source governance systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Related_projects|title=Related projects|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[Left-libertarianism|left-libertarian]] and [[radical center (politics)|radical centrist]] organizations around the globe have begun advocating open-source governance and its related political ideas as a reformist alternative to current governance systems. Often, these groups have their origins in [[decentralization|decentralized]] structures such as the Internet and place particular importance on the need for anonymity to protect an individual's right to free speech in democratic systems. Opinions vary, however, not least because the principles behind open-source government are still very loosely defined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/1841026/Upholding_online_anonymity_in_Internet_governance_Affordances_ethical_frameworks_and_regulatory_practices|title=Upholding online anonymity in Internet governance: Affordances, ethical frameworks, and regulatory practices|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications of the principles ==

In practice, several applications have evolved and been used by actual democratic institutions in the developed world:&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wwxKluxdL-kC&amp;pg=PT369 Service-oriented architecture governance for the services driven enterprise]; Eric A. Marks&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Open-government]] mechanisms including those for public participation and engagement, such as the use of [[IdeaScale]], [[Google Moderator]], [[Semantic MediaWiki]], GitHub, and other software by actual ruling governments – these mechanisms are well-developed, especially in the UK and the USA.,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gfzzrnHy5cQC&amp;pg=PA241 Knowledge governance: processes and perspectives]; Snejina Michailova, [[Nicolai J. Foss]], [[Oxford University Press]]. Page 241 et al&lt;/ref&gt; or by civil society and citizens directly for example, Opengovpioneers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://opengovpioneers.miraheze.org/wiki/Main_Page|title=Open Government Pioneer Project|website=opengovpioneers.miraheze.org|language=en|access-date=2017-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the UK.
*[[Open politics|Open-politics]] [[web forum|forums]] and [[wiki]]s, where political issues and arguments can be debated, either within or between political party constraints, taking three distinct forms:
**Political-party-platform development, in which ideas are solicited from anyone or almost anyone and openly discussed to a point but the ranking and devotion of resources to developing ideas is reserved to party members or supporters. A variant is the non-partisan think-tank or citizen-advocacy group-platform development as has become common in Canada, for example the [[Dominion Institute]] policywiki.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/technology/as-one-experiment-ends-a-new-one-begins-for-policy-wiki/article654853/  As one experiment ends, a new one begins for Policy Wiki] [[The Globe and Mail]] / [[Dominion Institute]] policywiki&lt;/ref&gt;
**[[Citizen journalism]] forums obeying stricter rules to ensure equal [[power relationship]]s than is typically the case in blogs, strictly designed to balance libel and [[free speech]] laws for a local jurisdiction (following laws strictly is part of the open politics ideal).
**Open party mechanisms to actually govern and operate formal political parties without the usual insider politics and interest groups that historically have taken over such parties;  these experiments have been limited and typically take the form of parties run by referenda or online. An example of this is Italy's [[Five Star Movement]].
*In the [[California Assembly]], [[Crowdsourced legislation]] via a 'wiki bills' website is being initiated via an online wiki, with an introduction deadline of early February, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;(Jan 8, 2015) "[http://www.crescentavalleyweekly.com/news/01/08/2015/gatto-promotes-wiki-bill-project/ Gatto Promotes 'Wiki Bill' project]" ''Crescenta Valley Weekly'' '''6'''(19) p.1,8 accessdate=2015-01-14&lt;/ref&gt;
*Hybrid mechanisms which attempt to provide journalistic coverage, political platform development, political transparency, strategic advice, and critique of a ruling government of the same party all at the same time.  [[Dkosopedia]] is the best known example of this.

Some models are significantly more sophisticated than a plain wiki, incorporating semantic tags, levels of control or scoring to mediate disputes – however this always risks empowering a clique of moderators more than would be the case given their trust position within the democratic entity – a parallel to the common wiki problem of [[official vandalism]] by persons entrusted with power by owners or publishers (so-called "sysop vandalism" or "administrative censorship").

== Common and simultaneous policy ==

Some advocates of these approaches, by analogy to software code, argue{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} for a "central codebase" in the form of a set of policies that are maintained in a public registry and that are ''infinitely reproducible''. "[[Distribution (business)|Distributions]]" of this policy-base are released (periodically or dynamically) for use in localities, which can apply "patches" to customize them for their own use.  Localities are also able to cease subscribing to the central policy-base and "fork" it or adopt someone else's policy-base. In effect, the government stems from emergent cooperation and self-correction among members of a community. As the policies are put into practice in a number of localities, problems and issues are identified and solved, and where appropriate communicated back to the core.

These goals for instance were cited often during the [[Green Party of Canada]]'s experiments with open-political-platform development.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}  As one of over a hundred national [[Green party]] entities worldwide and the ability to co-ordinate policy among provincial and municipal equivalents within Canada, it was in a good position to maintain just such a central repository of policy, despite being legally separate from those other entities.

== Difference from prior initiatives ==
Open-source governance differs from previous open-government initiatives in its broader emphasis on collaborative processes.

==History==
The "Imagine Halifax" (IH) project was designed to create a citizens' forum for elections in [[Halifax Urban Area|Halifax, Nova Scotia]] in fall 2004.  Founded by Angela Bischoff, the widow of [[Tooker Gomberg]], a notable advocate of combining [[direct action]] with open politics methods, IH brought a few dozen activists together to compile a platform (using live meetings and email and seedwiki followup).  When it became clear that candidates could not all endorse all elements of the platform, it was then turned into questions for candidates in the election.  The best ideas from candidates were combined with the best from activists – the final scores reflected a combination of convergence and originality.  In contrast to most such questionnaires, it was easier for candidates to excel by contributing original thought than by simply agreeing.  One high scorer, [[Andrew Younger]], had not been involved with the project originally but was elected and appeared on TV with project leader [[Martin Willison]].  The project had not only changed its original goal from a partisan platform to a citizen questionnaire, but it had recruited a previously uninvolved candidate to its cause during the election.  A key output of this effort was a [[glossary]] of about 100 keywords relevant to municipal laws.

The 2004–05 [[Green Party of Canada#Internet innovation|Green Party of Canada Living Platform]] was a much more planned and designed effort at open politics.  As it prepared itself for an electoral breakthrough in the [[Canadian federal election, 2004|2004 federal election]], the [[Green Party of Canada]] began to compile citizen, member and expert opinions in preparation of its platform.  During the election, it gathered input even from [[Internet troll]]s including supporters of other parties, with no major problems: [[anonymity]] was respected and, if they were within the terms of use, comments remained intact.  Despite, or perhaps because of, its early success, it was derailed by [[Jim Harris (politician)|Jim Harris]], the party's leader, when he discovered that it was a threat to his status as a [[party boss]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} The Living Platform split off as another service entirely out of GPC control and eventually evolved into OpenPolitics.ca&lt;ref&gt;[http://files.uniteddiversity.com/Decision_Making_and_Democracy/Decision_Making_Handout.pdf Decision Making Handout]&lt;/ref&gt; and a service to promote wiki usage among citizens and  political groups.

The [[Liberal Party of Canada]] also attempted a deep policy renewal effort in conjunction with its leadership race in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://annemclellan.com/edmonton2_e.pdf Liberal Party of Canada Renewal Commission, Notes from Task Force on Women Meeting]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liberal.ca/|title=Liberal Party of Canada|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While candidates in that race, notably [[Carolyn Bennett]], [[Stéphane Dion]] and [[Michael Ignatieff]], all made efforts to facilitate web-threaded policy-driven conversations between supporters, all failed to create lateral relationships and thus also failed to contribute much to the policy renewal effort.

Numerous very different projects related to open-source governance collaborate under the umbrella of the [[Metagovernment]] project;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Active_projects|title=Active projects|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metagovernment uses the term "collaborative governance",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Collaborative_governance|title=Collaborative governance|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; most of which are building platforms of open-source governance.

Audrey reported that the motivation for her work was personal uncertainty about the nature and accuracy of models, estimates and assumptions used to prepare policies released with the 2014 Australian Federal Government Budget, and whether and to what extent their real world impact is assessed following implementation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/linux.conf.au/2015/Case_Room_3/Wednesday/Evaluating_Government_Policies_Using_Open_Source_Models.webm|title=Evaluating Government Policies Using Open Source Models|author=Audrey Lobo-Pulo|accessdate=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A white paper on "Evaluating Government Policies using Open Source Models" was released on September 10, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://phoensight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Phoensight-Evaluating-Government-Policies-using-Open-Source-Models-Sept-2015-1.pdf|title=Evaluating Government Policies using Open Source Models|work=Phoensight}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Open politics as a distinct theory {{anchor|Open politics}} ==

The open-politics theory, a narrow application of open-source governance, combines aspects of the [[free software]] and [[open-content]] movements, promoting [[decision-making]] methods claimed to be more open, less antagonistic, and more capable of determining what is in the [[public interest]] with respect to [[public policy]] issues.  It takes special care for instance to deal with equity differences, geographic constraints, defamation versus free political speech, accountability to persons affected by decisions, and the actual standing law and institutions of a jurisdiction.  There is also far more focus on compiling actual positions taken by real entities than developing theoretical "best" answers or "solutions".  One example, [http://discoursedb.org DiscourseDB], simply lists articles pro and con a given position without organizing their argument or evidence in any way.

While some interpret it as an example of "open-source politics", open politics is not a top–down theory but a set of best practices from [[citizen journalism]], [[participatory democracy]] and [[deliberative democracy]], informed by [[e-democracy]] and [[netroots]] experiments, applying argumentation framework for issue-based argument as they evolved in academic and military use through the 1980s to present.  Some variants of it draw on the theory of [[scientific method]] and [[market method]]s, including [[prediction market]]s and [[anticipatory democracy]].

Its advocates often engage in legal lobbying and advocacy to directly change laws in the way of the broader application of the technology, e.g. opposing [[political libel]] cases in Canada, fighting [[libel chill]] generally, and calling for clarification of privacy and human rights law especially as they relate to citizen journalism.  They are less focused on tools although the [[semantic mediawiki]] and [[tikiwiki]] platforms seem to be generally favored above all others.

{{Policy Debate}}
'''Policy debate''' is a form of [[debate#competitive debate|debate competition]]&lt;!-- took away the clarify me because the link now explains better --&gt; in which teams of two advocate for and against a resolution that typically calls for policy change by the United States federal government. It is also referred to as '''cross-examination debate''' (sometimes shortened to '''Cross-X''', '''CX''', '''Cross-ex''', or '''C-X''') because of the 3-minute questioning period following each [[constructive speech]]. Affirmative teams generally present a ''plan'' as a proposal for implementation of the resolution.

High school policy debate is sponsored by various organizations including the [[National Speech and Debate Association]], [[National Association of Urban Debate Leagues]], [[Catholic Forensic League]], [[Stoa USA]], and the [[National Christian Forensics and Communications Association]], as well as many other regional speech organizations. Collegiate policy debates are generally competed under the guidelines of [[National Debate Tournament]] (NDT) and the [[Cross Examination Debate Association]] (CEDA), which have been joined at the collegiate level. A one-person policy format is sanctioned by the [[National Forensic Association]] (NFA) on the collegiate level as well.

==History==
Academic debate had its origins in intracollegiate debating societies, in which students would engage in (often public) debates against their classmates. [[Wake Forest University]]'s debate program claims to have its origins in student literary societies founded on campus in the mid-1830s, which first presented joint "orations" in 1854.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Abbreviated Timeline: Wake Debate|url=http://groups.wfu.edu/debate/HistoryPages/AbbreviatedTimeline.html|publisher=Wake Forest University}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many debating societies that were founded at least as early as the mid-nineteenth century are still active today, though they have generally shifted their focus to intercollegiate competitive debate. In addition to Wake Forest, the debate society at [[Northwestern University]] dates to 1855.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.debate.northwestern.edu |title=Debate Society, School of Communication, Northwestern University |publisher=Debate.northwestern.edu |accessdate=2014-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Boston College]]'s Fulton Debating Society, which was founded in 1868, continues to stage an annual public "Fulton Prize Debate" between teams of its own students after the intercollegiate debate season has ended. Other universities continue similar traditions.

Intercollegiate debates have been held since at least as early as the 1890s. Historical records indicate that debates between teams from [[Wake Forest University]] and Trinity College (later [[Duke University]]) occurred beginning in 1897.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Century of Intercollegiate Debate|url=http://groups.wfu.edu/debate/HistoryPages/Intercollegiatedebate.html|publisher=Wake Forest University}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, a debate between students from Boston College and [[Georgetown University]] occurred on May 1, 1895, in Boston.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Donovan|first=Charles F.|title=Debate at Boston College: People, Places, Traditions|date=November 1991|publisher=Boston College, Office of the University Historian|url=http://www.bc.edu/content/dam/files/schools/cas_sites/communication/pdf/Donovan-Debate-history.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Whitman College]] debated [[Washington State University]], [[Willamette University]], and the [[University of Idaho]] in the late 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cat.sckans.edu/frederick_debate/history.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-12-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051201083247/http://cat.sckans.edu/frederick_debate/history.htm |archivedate=2005-12-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Southwestern claims that the first debate held on its campus was between Southwestern and Fairmount College (which eventually became [[Wichita State University]]) but that debate could not have occurred prior to 1895, the year Fairmount College began classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webs.wichita.edu/?u=aboutwsu&amp;p=/wsu_history_long/ |title=ABOUT WSU - Wichita State University |publisher=Webs.wichita.edu |accessdate=2014-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid-1970s, structured rules for lengths of speeches developed. Each side (affirmative and negative) was afforded two opening "constructive" speeches, and two closing [[Rebuttal speech|"rebuttal" speeches]], for a total of eight speeches per debate. Each speaker was cross-examined by an opponent for a period following his or her constructive speech. Traditionally rebuttals were half the length of constructives, but when a style of faster delivery speed became more standard in the late 1980s this time structure became problematic. Wake Forest University introduced reformed speech times in both its college (9‑6 instead of 10‑5) and high school (8‑5 instead of 8‑4) tournaments, which spread rapidly to become the new [[de facto]] standards.

In 2014, debaters Ameena Ruffin and Korey Johnson made history by being the first black women to win the Cross Examination Debate Association tournament, which is the largest college debate tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Meet The First Black Women to Win a National Debate Conference|url = http://www.essence.com/2014/08/04/meet-first-black-women-win-national-debate-conference|website = Essence.com|access-date = 2016-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style and delivery==

===Speed===
{{main|Spreading (debate)}}

Policy debaters' speed of delivery will vary from league to league and tournament to tournament. In many tournaments, debaters will speak very quickly in order to read as much evidence and make as many arguments as possible within the time-constrained speech. Speed reading or spreading is normal at the majority of national circuit policy debate tournaments.

Some feel that the rapid-fire delivery makes debate harder to understand for the lay person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kang|first=Jay|title=High School Debate at 350 WPM|url=https://www.wired.com/magazine/2012/01/ff_debateteam/|publisher=Wired|accessdate=27 March 2012|date=20 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rapid delivery is encouraged by those who believe that increased quantity and diversity of argumentation makes debates more educational. Others, citing scientific studies, claim that learning to speak faster also increases short- and long-term memory{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}. A slower style is preferred by those who want debates to be understandable to lay people and those who claim that the pedagogical purpose of the activity is to train rhetorical skills. This is often a argument made by those who oppose in-round spreading - that the use of incomprehensible speeds makes debate less appealing to lay people. Many further claim that the increased speed encourages debaters to make several poor arguments, as opposed to a few high-quality ones. Most debaters will vary their rate of delivery depending upon the judge's preferences.

===Flowing===
{{Main|Flow (policy debate)}}
Debaters utilize a specialized form of note taking, called ''flowing'', to keep track of the arguments presented during a debate. Conventionally, debater's flowing is divided into separate ''flows'' for each different argument in the debate round ([[kritik]]s, [[Disadvantage|disads]], [[Topicality (policy debate)|topicalities]], case, etc.). There are multiple methods of flowing but the most common style incorporates columns of arguments made in a given speech which allows the debater to match the next speaker's responses up with the original arguments. Certain shorthands for commonly used words are used to keep up with the rapid rate of delivery. The abbreviations or stand-in symbols vary between debaters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cheshire|first=David|title=25 Tips for Taking a Better Flowsheet|journal=Rostrum|year=2000|url=http://debate.uvm.edu/NFL/rostrumlib/CheshierNov00.pdf|accessdate=30 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:laptopflowing.jpg|thumb|200px|Judges at the 2007 [[NDT]] using a combination of laptops, quills, and [[papyrus]]]] --&gt;Flowing on a laptop has become more and more popular among high school and college debaters, despite the reservations of certain schools, tournaments, and judges. Some debaters use a basic computer spreadsheet; others use specialized flowing templates, which includes embedded shortcut keys for the most common formatting needs.

==Theory==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2009|}}

Although there are many accepted standards in policy debate, there is no written formulation of rules. Sometimes debaters will in fact debate about how policy debate should work. These arguments are known as "theory arguments", and they are most often brought up when one team believes the actions of the other team are unfair and therefore warrant a loss. In more recent years, however, theory arguments have not been nearly as present in the Novice level as before.

===Burdens of the affirmative===

When the Affirmative team presents a plan, they take upon themselves the Burden of Proof to prove that their plan should be adopted. They must prove that their plan is an example of the resolution, and they must prove that the plan is a good idea. The Affirmative traditionally must uphold this burden using evidence from published sources, to avoid ridiculous cases.

====Stock issues====
{{Main|Stock issues}}
One traditional way to judge policy debate states that the affirmative team must win certain issues, called the '''stock issues'''. They are generally interpreted to be as follows:
* '''Disadvantages'''
How many negative disadvantages will the plan have? Will its disadvantages outweigh its advantages?
* '''Solvency'''
Will the plan solve the harms and can it even happen in the real world? How much of an impact will the plan have?
* '''Harms'''
What is the problem in the status quo to justify implementation of the plan? Is the plan important enough to even warrant consideration or make a difference?
* '''Inherency'''
Is the affirmative's plan happening already, and if not, why?
* '''[[Topicality (policy debate)|Topicality]]'''
Is the plan an example of the resolution? Does the affirmative team's proposed policy comply with the wording of the resolution?

The "stock issues" are also commonly described as Significance, Harms, Inherency, Topicality, and Solvency. The "stock issues" are then taught collectively as "The S.H.I.T.S." . Stock issues are taught extensively to novice debaters, but typically become less relevant as debaters move into more complex and less traditional arguments. Stock issues are strongly associated with traditional policy debate, and are typically stressed in advanced debates only if the judge is known to have traditionalist preferences. In some places (notably the West Coast), there is the additional stock issue of disadvantages; or a 'bad thing' that may occur as a result of passing the plan.

==Advantages and disadvantages==

Most affirmative teams today generally frame their case around advantages, which are good effects of their plan. The negative team will often present disadvantages which contend that the affirmative plan causes undesirable consequences. In an attempt to make sure that their advantages/disadvantages outweigh those of the other team, debaters often present extreme scenarios such as the [[Human extinction|extinction of the human race]] or a [[Nuclear warfare|global nuclear war]].

===Negation theory===
Negation Theory contends that the [[negative (policy debate)|negative]] need only negate the [[affirmative (policy debate)|affirmative]] instead of having to negate the [[resolution (policy debate)|resolution]]. The acceptance of negation theory allows negative teams to run arguments such as topical counter plans that may affirm the resolution but still negate the affirmative's specific plan.

===Negative strategy===
After the affirmative presents its case, the negative can attack the case with many different arguments, which include:
* Topicality: The Negative will attempt to argue that the Affirmative team does not fall under the rubric of the resolution and should be rejected immediately regardless of the merits or advantages of the plan. This is a type of "meta-debate" argument, as both sides then spend time defining various words or phrases in the resolution, laying down standards for why their definition(s) or interpretation(s) is superior. Most yearly topics have at least one or two commonly run Affirmative cases that are only arguably topical, so Topicality is often justified as a check or deterrent on and against such plans, which usually have quite strategic components. If run correctly, they are the strongest arguments against case.
* [[Disadvantage]]s: The negative can claim that there are disadvantages, or adverse effects of the plan, which outweigh any advantages claimed. In order to outweigh any positive effects of the affirmative case, impacts must be arguably "larger" than those of the opposing team. The negative must say what is good now, and how the affirmative's plan causes the impact of their disadvantage.
* [[Counterplan]]s: The negative can present a counter solution to the affirmative case's problem which does not have to affirm the resolution (The negative does not have to be topical in making a counterplan). This is generally accompanied by on-case arguments that the affirmative's plan does not solve, as well as disadvantages that link to the affirmative case but not the counterplan. Counterplans narrow down the on-case arguments to: advantages the counterplan can not borrow, the inherency, and the solvency. Upon the negative running a counterplan, most debates boil down to the solvency of the affirmative case, and the disadvantages. Counterplans must be competitive with the plan. This means that the counterplan must either be mutually exclusive with the affirmative (for example, one cannot both increase oil production (a hypothetical plan) and decrease oil production (a hypothetical counterplan) or be undesirable in conjunction with the plan (the negative must win that the inclusion of the plan would cause some form of harm that the counterplan alone would avoid).
* [[Kritik]]s: The negative can claim that the affirmative is guilty of a certain mindset or assumption that should be grounds for rejection or a different mutually exclusive alternative to the Affirmatives plan. Kritiks are sometimes a reason to reject the entire affirmative advocacy without evaluating its policy; other times, kritiks can be evaluated within the same framework for evaluation as the affirmative case. Examples of some areas of literature for kritiks include [[biopower]], [[racism]], [[statism|centralized government]], and [[anthropocentrism]]. Kritiks arose in the early 1990s, with the first kritiks based in [[deconstructionist]] philosophy about the intrinsic ambiguity of language and were championed by debaters Shane Stafford and Bill Shanahan. Kritiks today have evolved to sometimes include the affirmative advocacy within their alternatives. These kritiks argue that the ontological or epistemological assumptions behind the affirmative are flawed and ought to be rejected, but the plan itself is fine. For example, an affirmative could argue that it would be good to reduce our nuclear stockpile to avoid global proliferation out of fear of rogue states acquiring nuclear weapons. The negative could respond with an aff-inclusive kritik that argues that it would be good to reduce our nuclear stockpile because nuclear weapons are unethical, but that we ought not conceptualize other states as fundamentally dangerous.
* Theory: Sometimes the subject matter of the affirmative's case will create an uneven playing field from the beginning. In these cases, the negative can resort to making objections as to the procedure or content of the affirmative case. These objections often are "theoretical" in that they try to make objections based upon what bad can/has come to debate from the infraction.

==Evidence==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Debateimage.jpg|thumb|Tubs of evidence{{pufc|Debateimage.jpg|date=24 January 2013}}]] --&gt;
{{Main|Evidence (policy debate)}}
Evidence in debates is organized into units called ''cards'' (because such evidence was originally printed on note cards, though the practice has long been out of favor). Cards are designed to condense an author's argument so that debaters have an easy way to access the information. A card is composed of three parts: the tag, the cite, and the body. The ''tag'' is the debater's summary of the argument presented in the body. A tag is usually only one or two sentences. The ''cite'' contains all relevant citation information (that is, the author, date of publication, journal, title, etc.). Although every card should contain a complete citation, only the author's name and date of publication are typically spoken aloud in a speech. Some teams will also read the author's qualifications if they wish to emphasize this information. The ''body'' is a fragment of the author's original text. The length of a body can vary greatly—cards can be as short as a few sentences and as long as two or more pages. Most cards are between one and five paragraphs in length. The body of a card is often underlined or highlighted in order to eliminate unnecessary or redundant sentences when the card is read in a round. In a round, the tag is read first, followed by the cite and the body.

As pieces of evidence accumulate use, multiple colors of highlighting and different thicknesses of underlining often occur, sometimes making it difficult to determine which portion of the evidence was read. If debaters stop before finishing the underlined or highlighted portion of a card, it is considered good form to "mark" the card to show where one stopped reading. To otherwise misrepresent how much of a card was read—either by stopping early or by skipping underlined or highlighted sections—is known as "cross-reading" or "clipping" which is generally considered cheating. Although many judges overtly condemn the practice on their paradigms, it is hard to enforce, especially if judges permit debaters to be excessively unclear. Opponents will generally stand behind a debater whom they believe to be cross-reading or clipping, as if waiting to take a card (see below), and silently read along with them in an attempt to get their opponent to stop or the judge to notice.

As cards are read in round, it is common for an opponent to collect and examine even while a speech is still going on. This practice originated in part because cards are read at a rate faster than conversational speed but also because the un-underlined portions of cards are not read in round. Taking the cards during the speech allows the opponent to question the author's qualifications, the original context of the evidence, etc. in [[cross-examination]]. It is generally accepted whichever team is using preparation time has priority to read evidence read previously during a round by both teams. As a result, large amounts of evidence may change hands after the use of preparation time but before a speech. Most judges will not deduct from a team's preparation time for time spent finding evidence which the other team has misplaced.

After a round, judges often "call for cards" to examine evidence whose merit was contested during the round or whose weight was emphasized during rebuttals so that they can read the evidence for themselves. Although widespread, this practice is explicitly banned at some tournaments, most notably [[National Catholic Forensic League]] nationals, and some judges refuse to call for cards because they believe the practice constitutes "doing work for debaters that should have been done during round". Judges may also call for evidence for the purpose of obtaining its citation information so that they can produce the evidence for their own school. Opponents and spectators are also generally allowed to collect citations in this manner, and some tournaments send scouts to rounds to facilitate the collection of cites for every team at the tournament, information which is sometimes published online.

==Judging==

A judge refers to the individual responsible for determining the winner and loser of a policy debate round as well as assessing the relative merit of the participant speakers.  Judges must resolve the complex issues presented in short time while, ideally, avoiding inserting their own personal beliefs that might cloud impartiality. 

Some circuits see ''lay'' or inexperienced judges recruited from the community as an important "part of the game." Debaters in these circuits must be able to adapt from presentations to individuals with no debate experience at all, to judges who have themselves been debaters. This use of lay judges significantly impacts delivery and argumentation as the rapid-fire style and complex debate-theory [[argument]]s are frequently incomprehensible to lay judges. For this reason, other circuits restrict policy debate judging to qualified judges, generally ex-debaters. The use of lay judges, and its impact in speed, presentation and argumentation is a source of great controversy in the US high school debate community.

===Speaker points===
The judge is charged not only with selecting a winner, but also must allot points to each competitor. Known as "speaker points" or simply "speaks", its goal is to provide a numerical evaluation of the debaters' speaking skills. Speaker point schemes vary throughout local state and regional organizations particularly at the high school level. However, the method accepted by most national organizations such as the National Forensic League, Tournament of Champions, National Catholic Forensic League, Cross-Examination Debate Association, and National Debate Tournament, use values ranging from 1 to 30. In practice, within these organizations the standard variation is 26‑29, where 26's are given to extremely poor speakers, where a perfect score is considered incredibly rare and warranted only by an outstanding performance. Most tournaments accept halfpoint gradiations, for example 28.5s. Generally, speaker points are seen as secondary in importance to wins and losses, yet often correlate with a team's win/loss rate. In other words, the judge usually awards the winning team cumulatively higher speaker points than the losing team. If the judge does not, the decision is considered a "low-point win". Low-point wins simply mean that the team with better argumentation spoke worse, but are often rare, because judges will vote for teams that speak better, and award better speaker points to victorious teams.

In some smaller jurisdictions, the judge ranks the speakers 1‑4 instead of awarding them speaker points. Either speaker-point calculation may be used to break ties among teams with like records. Some areas also use speaker rankings in addition to speaker points in order to differentiate between speakers awarded the same number of points.

At a majority of tournaments, debaters also receive "speaker awards", which are awarded to the debaters who received the greatest number of speaker points. Many tournaments also drop the highest and lowest score received by each debater, in order to ensure that the speaker award calculations are fair and consistent, despite the preferences of different judges. The amount of speaker awards given out varies based on the number of debaters competing at any given tournament. For instance, a small local tournament might only award trophies or plaques to the top three debaters, whereas a widely attended "national circuit" tournament might give out awards to the top ten or fifteen speakers.

===Paradigms===
Experienced debate judges (who were generally debaters in high school and/or college) generally carry a mindset that favors certain arguments and styles over others. Depending on what mindset, or paradigm, the judge uses, the debate can be drastically different. Because there is no one view of debate agreed upon by everyone, many debaters question a judge about their paradigm and/or their feelings on specific arguments before the round.

Not every judge fits perfectly into one paradigm or another. A judge may say that they are "tabula rasa" or tab for short, or willing to listen to anything, but draw the line at arguments they consider to be offensive (such as arguments in favor of racism). Or, a judge might be a "policymaker", but still look at the debate in an offense/defense framework like a games-playing judge.

Examples of paradigms include:
* '''Stock issues:''' In order for the affirmative team to win, their plan must retain all of the [[stock issues]], which are Harms, Inherency, Solvency, Topicality, and Significance. For the negative to win, they only need to prove that the affirmative fails to meet one of the stock issues. These judges are more likely to dislike newer arguments such as kritiks and some theoretical points.
* '''Policymaker:''' At the end of the round, the judge compares the affirmative plan with either the negative counterplan or the status quo. Whichever one is a better policy option is the winner. The better policy option is determined by comparing the advantages and disadvantages of each.
* '''''[[Tabula rasa]]''''': From the [[Latin]] for "blank slate", the judge attempts to come into the round with no predispositions. These judges typically expect debaters to "debate it out", which includes telling the judge what paradigm they should view the round in.
* '''Games player:''' Views debate as a game. Judges who use this paradigm tend to be concerned with whether or not each team has a fair chance at winning the debate. They usually view the debate flow as a gameboard, and look at arguments according to an offence/defense structure.
* '''Speaking skills/communications:''' This type of judge is concerned with good presentation and persuasion skills. They tend to vote for teams that are more articulate, and present arguments in the most appealing way. These judges usually disapprove of speed.
* '''Hypothesis tester:''' In order for the affirmative to win, they convince the judge to support the resolution. Conversely, the negative must convince the judge to negate the resolution.
* '''Kritikal:''' Judges who prefer kritik debates and look to who most effectively breaks free from educationally harmful mindset such as [[patriarchy]], [[racism]], or [[orientalism]].

==Competition==
{{Main|Policy debate competitions}}

===Tournaments===
Most high school debaters debate in local tournaments in their city, state or nearby states. Thousands of tournaments are held each year at high schools throughout the US.

A small subset of high school debaters, mostly from elite public and private schools, travel around the country to tournaments in what is called the 'national circuit.' The championship of the national circuit is usually considered to be the [[Tournament of Champions (debate)|Tournament of Champions]], also called the T.O.C, at the [[University of Kentucky]], which requires formal qualification in the form of two or more bids to the tournament. Bids are achieved by reaching a certain level of elimination rounds (for example, quarter-finals) at select, highly competitive, and carefully chosen tournaments across the country based upon the quality of debaters they attract and the diversity of locations from across the United States they represent.

===Urban debate===
[[Urban debate league]]s give students in urban school districts an opportunity to participate in policy debate. There are currently urban debate leagues in 24 of the largest cities in the United States. In total, more than 500 high schools participate in the league and more than 40,000 students have competed in urban debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Urban Debate QuickFacts |url=http://urbandebate.org/quickfacts.shtml |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411183813/http://www.urbandebate.org/quickfacts.shtml |archivedate=April 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Championships===

====High school====

There is some dispute over what constitutes the "national championship" in the United States per se, but two tournaments generally compete for the title:
The [[Tournament of Champions (debate)|Tournament of Champions]] held at the [[University of Kentucky]], and the National Speech and Debate tournament sponsored by the [[National Forensic League]] (now known as the National Speech &amp; Debate Association). For the highest level of competition, the Tournament of Champions is generally considered to be the more prestigious title to hold.
* Other national championships include:
** The Grand National Tournament of the [[National Catholic Forensic League]].
** The National Championship of the [[National Association of Urban Debate Leagues]] (NAUDL).
** The National Debate Coaches' Association Championship (NDCA)
** The [[National Christian Forensics and Communications Association]] (NCFCA)
** The National Invitational Tournament of Champions (NITOC) of [[Stoa USA]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stoausa.org/nitoc-2011] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101106224157/http://www.stoausa.org/nitoc-2011|date=November 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** The National Speech and Debate Association National Tournament (NSDA).

====TFA debate====
In Texas, some debate occurs on the [[Texas Forensic Association]] (TFA) level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Texas Forensics Association|url=http://www.tfa.org|accessdate=27 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This organization includes mostly the progressive judging paradigms and favors many off topic arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Debate Shack|url=http://www.angelfire.com/ak/kritiklemur|accessdate=27 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  TFA is geared towards the larger schools/programs who tend to be in the suburban areas in the major cities in the eastern part of the state.  The other type of debate is UIL. UIL is open to all public schools throughout Texas.

TFA State policy debate tends to favor a multitude of off-case arguments and teams that favor a progressive style; while UIL State tends to be more policy focused.

====College====
There is no single unified national championship in college debate; though the [[National Debate Tournament]] (NDT), the [[Cross Examination Debate Association]] (CEDA) and the [[American Debate Association]] (ADA) all host national tournaments. The NDT committee issues a ranking report of the top 16 teams in the country ("first round bids") for automatic advancement to the NDT in early February. The report roughly determines a regular season champion called the 'Copeland Award' for the team rated the highest over the course of the year through early February.

===Institutes and camps===
{{Main|Debate camp}}
While once attended by only highly competitive policy debaters, many high school students now attend debate institutes, which are typically held at colleges in the summer. Most institutes range from about two to seven weeks.

Many institutes divide students into work groups, or "labs", based on skill level and experience. Many even offer specialized "advanced" or "scholars" workshops, to which acceptance is highly limited.

==Resolutions==
A '''resolution''' or '''topic''' is a statement which the [[affirmative (policy debate)|affirmative team]] affirms and the [[negative (policy debate)|negative team]] negates. Resolutions are selected annually by affiliated schools. Most resolutions from the 1920s to 2005 have begun "Resolved: that The United States federal government should" although some variations from this structure have been apparent both before the NDT-CEDA merger and with the 2006–2007 college policy debate topic, which limited the affirmative agent to the [[United States Supreme Court]].

At the college level, a number of topics are proposed and interested parties write "topic papers" discussing the pros and cons of that individual topic. Each school then gets one vote on the topic. The single topic area voted on then has a number of proposed topic wordings, one is chosen, and it is debated by affiliated students nationally for the entire season (standard academic school year).

At the high-school level, "topic papers" are also prepared but the voting procedure is different. These papers are then presented to a topic selection committee which rewords each topic and eventually narrows down the number of topics to five topics. Then the five resolutions are put to a two-tiered voting system. State forensic associations, the National Forensic League, and the National Catholic Forensic League all vote on the five topics, narrowing it down to two. Then the two topics are again put to a vote, and one topic is selected.
* The 2010-2011 high school resolution was:

Resolved: The United States federal government should substantially reduce its military and/or police presence in one or more of the following: South Korea, Japan, Afghanistan, Kuwait, Iraq, Turkey.
* The 2011–2012 high school resolution was:

Resolved: The United States federal government should substantially increase its exploration and/or development of space beyond the Mesosphere.
* The 2012–2013 high school resolution was:

Resolved: The United States federal government should substantially increase its transportation infrastructure investment in the United States.
* The 2013–2014 high school resolution was:

Resolved: The United States federal government should substantially increase its economic engagement toward Cuba, Mexico or Venezuela.
* The 2014–2015 high school resolution was:

Resolved: The United States federal government should substantially increase its non-military exploration and/or development of the Earth's oceans.
* The 2015–2016 high school resolution was:

Resolved: The United States federal government should substantially curtail its domestic surveillance.
* The 2016–2017 high school resolution was:
Resolved: The United States federal government should substantially increase its economic and/or diplomatic engagement with the People's Republic of China.

Resolved: The United States federal government should substantially increase its funding and/or regulation of primary and/or secondary education in the United States.
* The 2018-2019 high school resolution is:
Resolved: The United States federal government should substantially reduce its restrictions on legal immigration to the United States.

In addition to speeches, policy debates may allow for a certain amount of preparation time, or "[[prep time]]," during a debate round. NFL rules call for 5&amp;nbsp;minutes of total prep time that can be used, although in practice high school debate tournaments usually give 8&amp;nbsp;minutes of prep time. College debates typically have 10&amp;nbsp;minutes of preparation time. The preparation time is used at each team's preference; they can use different amounts of preparation time before any of their speeches, or even none at all. Prep time can be allocated strategically to intimidate or inconvenience the other team:  for instance, normally a 1AR requires substantial prep time, so a well-executed "stand up 1AR," delivered after no prep time intimidates the negative team and takes away from time that the 2NR may have used to prepare the parts of his/her speech which do not rely on what the 1AR says.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3125">{{Redirect|Product of categories|the operation on objects of a category|Product (category theory)}}

In the mathematical field of [[category theory]], the '''product''' of two categories ''C'' and ''D'', denoted {{nowrap| ''C'' × ''D''}} and called a '''product category''', is an extension of the concept of the [[Cartesian product]] of two sets. Product categories are used to define [[Functor#Bifunctors and multifunctors|bifunctors and multifunctors]].{{sfn|Mac Lane|1978}}

==Definition==
The product category {{nowrap| ''C'' × ''D''}} has:
*as objects:
*:pairs of objects {{nowrap| (''A'', ''B'')}}, where ''A'' is an object of ''C'' and ''B'' of ''D'';
*as arrows from {{nowrap| (''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)}} to  {{nowrap| (''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''B''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)}}:
*:pairs of arrows {{nowrap| (''f'', ''g'')}}, where {{nowrap| ''f'' : ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; → ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} is an arrow of ''C'' and {{nowrap| ''g'' : ''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; → ''B''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} is an arrow of ''D'';
*as composition, component-wise composition from the contributing categories:
*:{{nowrap|1= (''f''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) &lt;small&gt;o&lt;/small&gt; (''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) = (''f''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;small&gt;o&lt;/small&gt; ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;small&gt;o&lt;/small&gt; ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)}};
*as identities, pairs of identities from the contributing categories:
*:1&lt;sub&gt;(''A'', ''B'')&lt;/sub&gt; = (1&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt;, 1&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt;).

==Relation to other categorical concepts==
For [[small category|small categories]], this is the same as the action on objects of the [[categorical product]] in the category '''[[Category of small categories|Cat]]'''. A [[functor]] whose domain is a product category is known as a [[bifunctor]]. An important example is the [[Hom functor]], which has the product of the [[Dual (category theory)|opposite]] of some category with the original category as domain:

:Hom : ''C''&lt;sup&gt;op&lt;/sup&gt; × ''C'' → '''Set'''.

==Generalization to several arguments==
Just as the binary Cartesian product is readily generalized to an [[Cartesian product#n-ary product|''n''-ary Cartesian product]], binary product of two categories can be generalized, completely analogously, to a product of ''n'' categories. The product operation on categories is commutative and associative, [[up to isomorphism]], and so this generalization brings nothing new from a theoretical point of view.

'''Progressive illumination''' is a theological concept describing the [[hermeneutics|hermeneutical]] practice of orthodox theological development, most notably in [[Christianity]]; though the practice exists in many religions, especially [[Abrahamic religions]].  The term is used mostly among [[Christian theology|Christian theologians]].  It is distinct from [[progressive revelation (Christianity)|progressive revelation]] in that it does not describe the reception from God of new divine texts, or any novel concept that has no accepted foundation.  Rather it describes God-given understanding of existing revelation in a better and more accurate way.&lt;ref&gt;Kimble, Eugene, Ph.D. [http://www.bsmi.org/download/kimble/Biblical_Theology_Hermeneutical_Principles_20020926.pdf Biblical Theology: Hermeneutical Principles of Progressive Revelation], Retrieved 18 August 2012, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;  It usually refers to understanding a [[Special revelation|biblical concept]] better, but the term also encompasses understanding [[general revelation|creation]] better, even through scientific inquiry.

'''Public records''' are documents or pieces of information that are not considered [[confidential]] and generally pertain to the conduct of government.

For example, in [[California]], when a couple fills out a [[marriage license]] application, they have the option of checking the box as to whether the [[marriage]] is "confidential" (Record will be closed, and not opened to public once recorded) or "public" (record will become public record once recorded). Essentially, if the marriage record is public, a copy of the record can be ordered from the [[county]] in which the marriage occurred.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090107012514/http://www.publicrecords101.com/ "Article from Public Records 101"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Since the earliest organised [[Society|societies]], with [[tax]]ation, disputes, and so on, records of some sort have been needed. In ancient [[Babylon]] records were kept in [[cuneiform writing]] on clay tablets. In the [[Inca]] empire of [[South America]], which did not have writing, records were kept via an elaborate form of knots in cords, [[quipu]], whose meaning has been lost.

In [[Western Europe]] in the [[Late Middle Ages]] public records included [[census]] records as well as records of birth, death, and marriage; an example is the 1086 ''[[Domesday Book]]'' of [[William the Conqueror]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/normans/doomsday_01.shtml "The Domesday Book", BBC]&lt;/ref&gt; The details of [[Royal intermarriage|royal marriage]] agreements, which were effectively [[International treaty|international treaties]], were also recorded. The United Kingdom Public Record Office Act, which formalised record-keeping by setting up the [[Public Record Office]], was passed in 1838.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/information-management/legislation/history-of-pra.htm "History of the Public Records Acts", The National Archives]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public records==
* Records of [[law court]] proceedings
* Marriage records
* Death records
* Voting rolls

==Access to public records==
{{Expand section|date=March 2011}}
Although public records are records of public business, they are not necessarily available without restriction, although [[Freedom of Information legislation]] (FOI) that has been gradually introduced in many jurisdictions since the 1960s has made access easier. Each government has policies and regulations that govern the availability of information contained in public records. A common restriction is that data about a person is not normally available to others; for example, the [[California Public Records Act]] (PRA) states that "except for certain explicit exceptions, personal information maintained about an individual may not be disclosed without the person's consent".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=gov&amp;group=06001-07000&amp;file=6250-6270 California Public Records Act] CA Codes (gov:6250-6270) - Official California Legislative Information&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] papers were subject to the [[thirty-year rule]]: until the introduction of FOI legislation, Cabinet papers were not available for thirty years; some information could be withheld for longer. {{As of|2011}} the rule still applies to some information, such as [[minutes]] of Cabinet meetings.

Some companies provide access, for a fee, to many public records available on the Internet. Many of them specialize in particular types of information, while some offer access to different types of record, typically to professionals in various fields. Some companies sell software with a promise of unlimited access to public records, but may provide nothing more than basic information on how to access already available and generally free public websites.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011|reason=for whole paragraph}}

Each year news media, civic groups, libraries, nonprofits, schools and others interested groups sponsor "Sunshine Week." Sunshine Week occurs in mid-March, coinciding with [[James Madison]]'s birthday and National Freedom of Information Day on the 16th.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sunshine Week|url=http://sunshineweek.rcfp.org/|website=Sunshine Week|accessdate=13 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the week is to highlight the idea that "government functions best when it operates in the open."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dukes|first1=Tyler|title=Sunshine Week to celebrate government transparency|url=http://www.wral.com/sunshine-week-to-celebrate-government-transparency/15520676/|accessdate=13 March 2016|publisher=WRAL|date=13 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many states, [[State legislature (United States)|state legislatures]] are often exempt from public-records laws that apply to state executive officials and local officials. In 2016, the Associated Press made a request for the emails and daily schedules of state legislative leaders (speakers of state Houses and presidents of state Senates) in all 50 states; a majority denied the request.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lieb|first1=David A.|title=Many state legislatures exempt themselves from record laws|url=http://www.thenewstribune.com/news/politics-government/article65959872.html|agency=Associated Press|date=March 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Court records===
Of particular significance was the evolution of the common-law right "to access court records to inspect and to copy".  The expectation inherent in the common law right to access court records is that any person may come to the office of the clerk of the court during business hours and request to inspect court records, with almost instantaneous access. Such right is a central safeguard of the integrity of the courts.  Any decision to conceal court records requires a sealing order. The right to access court records is also central to liberty: There is no conceivable way to exercise the Habeas Corpus right, deemed by the late Justice Brennan&lt;ref&gt;[[William J. Brennan, Jr.]]&lt;/ref&gt; as "the cornerstone" of the United States Constitution, absent access to court records as public records.

In the United States the [[common law]] right to "access court records to inspect and to copy" was reaffirmed by the U.S.&amp;nbsp;Supreme Court in ''Nixon v Warner Communications, Inc'' (1978), where the court found various parts of the right to access court records as inherent to the First, Fourth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments. In the United States access to court records is governed by Civil Rights in the Amendments to the United States Constitution, not by the Freedom of Information Act.

As court records become increasingly more accessible online, concerns about the undermining of private information has become a significant issue. In the past, obtaining court records required people to physically go to a courthouse and request documents, making privacy concerns essentially obsolete. However, with the relative ease at which people can now access these records, highly sensitive information (i.e. victim names, social security numbers, etc.) are at risk of being publicly exploited.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ardia|first=David S.|date=2017|title="Privacy and Court Records: Online Access and the Loss of Practical Obscurity."|url=|journal=University of Illinois Law Review 2017|volume=4|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the United States===
Access to U.S.&amp;nbsp;national public records is guided by the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] (FOIA). Requests for access to records pursuant to FOIA may be refused by federal agencies if information requested is subject to exemption, or some information may be redacted (deleted).

In addition to the national FOIA, all [[Freedom of information in the United States|states have some form of FOI legislation]]. For example, [[Colorado]] has the Colorado Open Records Act (CORA);&lt;ref&gt;[http://198.187.128.12/colorado/lpext.dll?f=templates&amp;fn=fs-main.htm&amp;2.0 Colorado Open Records Act] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070803205616/http://198.187.128.12/colorado/lpext.dll?f=templates&amp;fn=fs-main.htm&amp;2.0 |date=August 3, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[New Jersey]] the law is known as the Open Public Records Act (OPRA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nj.gov/grc/act.html Open Public Records Act]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many degrees of accessibility to public records between states, with some making it fairly easy to request and receive documents, and others with many exemptions and restricted categories of documents. One state that is fairly responsive to [[public records requests]] is [[New York (state)|New York]], which utilizes the Committee on Open Government to assist citizens with their requests.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dos.ny.gov/coog/ Committee on Open Government]&lt;/ref&gt; A state that was fairly restrictive in how they respond to public records requests is [[Pennsylvania]], where the law formerly presumed that all documents are exempt from disclosure, unless they can be proven otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;[https://triblive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/opinion/columnists/vassilaros/s_519212.html Pa.'s open secret] By Dimitri Vassilaros(July 27, 2007)- ''Pittsburgh Tribune-Review''&lt;/ref&gt; This was changed by a 2008 bill that went into effect in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.openrecords.pa.gov/Documents/RTKL/pa_righttoknowlaw.pdf |publisher=Pennsylvania Office of Open Records |title=Pennsylvania’s New Right to Know Law}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The California Public Records Act (''California Government Code'' §§6250-6276.48) covers the [[arrest]] and booking records of inmates in the State of California [[Types of incarceration facilities|jails and prison]]s, which are not covered by [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment rights]] ([[freedom of speech]] and of the [[Freedom of the press|press]]). Public access to arrest and booking records is seen as a critical safeguard of liberty.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

====Uses of public records====
With the advent of the Internet and the information age, access to public records in the United States to anyone who wishes to view them has dramatically increased. Third parties such as the [[information broker]] industry make regular use of public records to compile readily accessible profiles on millions of people, and may make a profit from the service of recompiling and mining the data.

Public record data is used for multiple purposes, such as ensuring that child support payments are made as determined by the courts,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/cse/pubs/2008/annual_report/ Office of Child Support Enforcement] FY 2005 Annual Report to Congress May 2008&lt;/ref&gt; assisting [[credit bureau]]s in keeping accurate data&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ftc.gov/os/testimony/040615idtheftssntest.pdf FTC.gov]&lt;/ref&gt; and helping to pay [[pension]] benefits to retirees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://waysandmeans.house.gov/legacy.asp?file=legacy/socsec/107cong/5-22-01/5-22lero.htm Waysandmeans.house.gov] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061228081839/http://waysandmeans.house.gov/legacy.asp?file=legacy%2Fsocsec%2F107cong%2F5-22-01%2F5-22lero.htm |date=2006-12-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Access to criminal records in the United States====
Individual criminal histories are generally considered to be public records in the United States and are often accessed via criminal history [[background check]]s, but "access and use of [[FBI]]-maintained criminal history record information has been traditionally limited and controlled in large measure to protect the privacy of the individuals to whom the records pertain."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/ag_bgchecks_report.pdf THE ATTORNEY GENERAL’S REPORT ON CRIMINAL HISTORY BACKGROUND CHECKS], U.S. Department of Justice, Office of the Attorney General, June 2006, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; The federal [[Fair Credit Reporting Act]] imposes "fair information-practice requirements by consumer reporting agencies that report public record information, such as criminal history records, for employment purposes," and some state consumer-protection laws impose more restrictive regulations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/ag_bgchecks_report.pdf THE ATTORNEY GENERAL’S REPORT ON CRIMINAL HISTORY BACKGROUND CHECKS], U.S. Department of Justice, Office of the Attorney General, June 2006, pp. 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Reporters' Committee for Freedom of the Press]], in the United States, arrest records "are generally open to the public unless they concern an active or ongoing investigation. A few states restrict the information that can be obtained from an arrest record, especially when it concerns individuals who were never charged, were acquitted or had their records expunged. Again, the determination will often result in a balancing test comparing the public's interest in disclosure against the individual privacy interest."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rcfp.org/private-eyes/arrest-records Media Law Resources: Arrest Records], Reporters' Committee for Freedom of the Press.&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, protective custody and [[juvenile delinquency]] records are exempted from most state open-records laws, such that access is "limited to the juvenile, his or her parents or guardians, or other parties directly involved in a legal matter."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rcfp.org/private-eyes/juvenile-records Juvenile Records], Reporters' Committee for Freedom of the Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Destruction of public records====
In early 2018, the National Archives put up a webpage, [https://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/resources/unauthorizeddispositionoffederalrecords "Unauthorized Disposition of Federal Records,"] to publish all instances of investigations into possible unauthorized destruction of records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Howard|first1=Alex|title=National Archives publishes online dashboard of its investigations into lost, altered or destroyed public records|url=https://sunlightfoundation.com/2018/04/24/national-archives-publishes-online-dashboard-of-its-investigations-into-lost-altered-or-destroyed-public-records/|accessdate=25 May 2018|publisher=Sunlight Foundation|date=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the remoteness of points in region beta, they will be reached faster than most points in the nearby region alpha.]]
The '''region-beta paradox''' denotes the phenomenon that people can sometimes recover more quickly from more intense emotions or pain than from less distressing experiences. The hypothesized reason is that intense states trigger psychological defense processes that reduce the distress, while less intense states do not trigger the same psychological defense processes and, therefore, less effective attenuation of the stress occurs. However, people typically predict intense states to last longer.&lt;ref name="Gilbert2004"/&gt;

The paradox has been observed in the psychological effects of exposure to terrorist attacks.&lt;ref name=Brandon2007/&gt; This is likely related to activation of [[Coping (psychology)|coping]], [[cognitive dissonance]] and other forms of mental mobilization.&lt;ref name="Zimbardo1966"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Taylor1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wilson2003/&gt;

It has been computationally modelled in an [[affective computing]] model.&lt;ref name="Steephen2013"/&gt;

==Origin of name==
The name originates from the illustration in the paper by [[Daniel Gilbert (psychologist)|Gilbert]] et al.&lt;ref name="Gilbert2004"/&gt; that introduced the paradox. They consider a commuter who has the habit of walking to destinations within a mile of her origin, and biking to more distant destinations. Since the bike is faster the commuter will reach some distant locations more quickly than a nearer destinations (region beta in their diagram), reversing the normal tendency to arrive later at more distant locations.

This [[Monotonic function|non-monotonicity]] applies to states where interventions can be chosen, but are not chosen below certain thresholds (because of cost etc.). For example, injured people may be more likely to seek out effective means to speed their recovery (taking medicine, going to a doctor, undergoing surgery) when the injury is more severe than for mild injuries, making the lesser injuries last longer.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6668">The following system is Mendelson's (1997, 289–293) '''ST''' [[type theory]]. 
ST is equivalent with Russell's ramified theory plus the [[Axiom of reducibility]]. 
The [[domain of discourse|domain of quantification]] is partitioned into an ascending hierarchy of types, with all [[individual]]s assigned a type. Quantified variables range over only one type; hence the underlying logic is [[first-order logic]]. '''ST''' is "simple" (relative to the type theory of ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'') primarily because all members of the [[relation (mathematics)|domain]] and [[relation (mathematics)|codomain]] of any [[relation (mathematics)|relation]] must be of the same type.
There is a lowest type, whose individuals have no members and are members of the second lowest type. Individuals of the lowest type correspond to the [[urelement]]s of certain set theories. Each type has a next higher type, analogous to the notion of [[successor function|successor]] in [[Peano arithmetic]]. While '''ST''' is silent as to whether there is a maximal type, a [[transfinite number]] of types poses no difficulty. These facts, reminiscent of the Peano axioms, make it convenient and conventional to assign a [[natural number]] to each type, starting with 0 for the lowest type. But type theory does not require a prior definition of the naturals.

The symbols peculiar to '''ST''' are primed variables and infix &lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt;. In any given formula, unprimed variables all have the same type, while primed variables (&lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt;) range over the next higher type. The [[atomic formula]]s of '''ST''' are of two forms, &lt;math&gt;x=y&lt;/math&gt; ([[identity (mathematics)|identity]]) and &lt;math&gt;y\in x'&lt;/math&gt;. The [[infix]] symbol &lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt; suggests the intended [[model theory|interpretation]], set membership.

All variables appearing in the definition of identity and in the axioms ''Extensionality'' and ''Comprehension'', range over individuals of one of two consecutive types. Only unprimed variables (ranging over the "lower" type) can appear to the left of '&lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt;', whereas to its right, only primed variables (ranging over the "higher" type) can appear. The first-order formulation of '''ST''' rules out quantifying over types. Hence each pair of consecutive types requires its own axiom of Extensionality and of Comprehension, which is possible if ''Extensionality'' and ''Comprehension'' below are taken as [[axiom scheme|axiom schemata]] "ranging over" types.

* '''Identity''', defined by &lt;math&gt;x=y\leftrightarrow\forall z' [x\in z'\leftrightarrow y\in z']&lt;/math&gt;.
* '''[[Axiom of extensionality|Extensionality]]'''.  An [[axiom schema]]. &lt;math&gt;\forall x[x\in y' \leftrightarrow x\in z'] \rightarrow [y'=z']&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;\Phi(x)&lt;/math&gt; denote any [[first-order logic|first-order formula]] containing the [[free variable]] &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.

* '''Comprehension'''.  An [[axiom schema]]. &lt;math&gt;\exists z'\forall x[x\in z'\leftrightarrow \Phi(x)]&lt;/math&gt;.

: ''Remark''. Any collection of elements of the same type may form an object of the next higher type. Comprehension is schematic with respect to &lt;math&gt;\Phi(x)&lt;/math&gt; as well as to types.

* '''[[Axiom of infinity|Infinity]]'''.  There exists a nonempty [[binary relation]] &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; over the individuals of the lowest type, that is [[Reflexive relation|irreflexive]], [[transitive relation|transitive]], and strongly connected: &lt;math&gt;\forall x,y [x\neq y\rightarrow[xRy\vee yRx]]&lt;/math&gt; and with codomain contained in domain.

: ''Remark''. Infinity is the only true axiom of '''ST''' and is entirely mathematical in nature. It asserts that &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is a strict [[total order]], with a [[relation (mathematics)|codomain]] contained in its [[relation (mathematics)|domain]]. If 0 is assigned to the lowest type, the type of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is 3. Infinity can be satisfied only if the (co)domain of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is [[Infinity|infinite]], thus forcing the existence of an infinite set. If relations are defined in terms of [[ordered pair]]s, this axiom requires a prior definition of ordered pair; the Kuratowski definition, adapted to '''ST''', will do. The literature does not explain why the usual [[axiom of infinity]] (there exists an [[inductive set (axiom of infinity)|inductive set]]) of [[ZFC]] of other set theories could not be married to '''ST'''.

'''ST''' reveals how type theory can be made very similar to [[axiomatic set theory]]. Moreover, the more elaborate [[Ontology (information science)|ontology]] of '''ST''', grounded in what is now called the "iterative conception of set," makes for axiom (schemata) that are far simpler than those of conventional set theories, such as [[ZFC]], with simpler ontologies. Set theories whose point of departure is type theory, but whose axioms, [[Ontology (information science)|ontology]], and terminology differ from the above, include [[New Foundations]] and [[Scott&amp;ndash;Potter set theory]].

== Formulations based on equality ==

{{Expand section|date=September 2009}}

Church's type theory has been extensively studied by two of Church's students, [[Leon Henkin]] and [[Peter B. Andrews (mathematician)|Peter B. Andrews]]. Since '''ST''' is a [[higher order logic]], and in higher order logics one can define propositional connectives in terms of [[logical equivalence]] and quantifiers, in 1963 Henkin developed a formulation of '''ST''' based on equality, but in which he restricted attention to propositional types. This was simplified later that year by Andrews in his
[[Q zero|theory '''Q&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''']].&lt;!--does anyone else call it this way? --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]: [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/type-theory-church/ Church's Type Theory]" &amp;ndash; by Peter Andrews (adapted from his book).&lt;/ref&gt; In this respect '''ST''' can be seen as a particular kind of a higher-order logic, classified by [[P.T. Johnstone]] in ''Sketches of an Elephant'', as having a [[lambda-signature]], that is a higher-order [[signature (logic)|signature]] that contains no relations, and uses only products and arrows (function types) as [[type constructors]]. Furthermore, as Johnstone put it, '''ST''' is "logic-free" in the sense that it contains no logical connectives or quantifiers in its formulae.&lt;ref&gt;P.T. Johnstone, ''Sketches of an elephant'', p. 952&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sake Sommelier of the Year''' is an annual competition jointly organised by the '''[[Sake Sommelier Association]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=AFWS seeks out UK Sake Sommelier of the Year|url=http://www.harpers.co.uk/news/afws-seeks-out-uk-sake-sommelier-of-the-year/348161.article|newspaper=Harpers.co.uk|date=8 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Held in [[London]] it is the first of its kind to be held outside [[Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=In the English county of Sake sommelier training Japanese boom intoxicating world|url=http://sake.newsclipping.net/archives/4330/|newspaper=Tokyo Shimbun|date=4 January 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140109194131/http://sake.newsclipping.net/archives/4330|archivedate=9 January 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sake popularity surging abroad but markrting needed|url= http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2014/01/07/national/sake-popularity-surging-abroad-but-marketing-needed-2/#.Us7N89tQ3IU|newspaper=The Japan Times|date=7 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The competition aims to find the most skilful [[Sake]] [[Sommelier]]s bringing them to the attention of their customers and raising the profile of their establishments. More than 50 sommeliers from [[Europe]], [[Asia]] and the [[Middle East]] entered the first competition in 2013.

In 2015, two new titles were introduced to both encourage and reward contribution to the world of sake; Young Sake Ambassador and Sake Ambassador.

== Judging Process ==
The Sake Sommelier of the Year is open to any professionals involved in the service of sake.

After registering, applicants are sent a first-round questionnaire. From these, three finalist are chosen to compete in the live competition where they will be judged on knowledge, blind tasting, sake matching, and practical skill.

An enormous amount of learning and confidence-building takes place by taking part in the competition.

== The Sake Sommelier of the Year judging panels==

The competition's judging panel represent a countrywide mix of the most experienced, innovative, respected and awarded faces in the industry including founders of '''[[Sake Sommelier Association]]'''

== Overall Winners 2013 - 2016 ==

The Sake Sommelier of the Year is held annually and is sponsored by one of the world's oldest family-owned sake companies '''Gekkeikan'''
.

The first competition was held on 11 November '''2013''' at the '''[[Forte Group|Westbury Hotel]]''' in [[London]], and was won by [[UAE]] Sommelier '''Rajan Rengasamy''', [[wine]] supplier [[Spinneys]].

In '''2014''', the Sake Sommelier of the Year was held on 24 November at the Westbury Hotel in London for the second time and was won by '''Noel Pusch''' of Zuma Abu Dhabi.

In '''2015''', the competition was held on 23 November at the Millennium Hotel, Knightsbridge London and was won by '''Miguel A. Hernandez''' of Kouzu.

In '''2016''', the most recent competition was held on 21 November at the Millennium Hotel, Knightsbridge London and was won by '''Venkadesh Thanga Mariappan''' of the Bonnington Jumeirah Lakes Tower Hotel, UAE.

The winner of the Sake Sommelier of the Year will win a unique trip to Japan.

== Young Sake Ambassador ==
The Young Sake Ambassador is an annual award given to someone aged 18-30 who has had little to no previous experience with sake, but who shows a great interest, enthusiasm, and desire to contribute to the world of sake, and expand the knowledge and appreciation of sake either in their own community or with an aspiration to help it grow worldwide.

The aim of this award is to bring a fresh mind-set into the sake industry worldwide. The selected Young Sake Ambassador of the Year will be expected to spend a year contributing to the promotion of sake with the [[Sake Sommelier Association|Sake Sommelier Association's]] support.

== Sake Ambassador==

Awarded every two years, the Sake Ambassador is bestowed upon someone for their outstanding dedication to the world of sake. The individual will have been working for sake diplomacy, contributing to the understanding and appreciation of sake throughout their country.

'''''Schadenfreude''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ʃ|ɑː|d|ən|f|r|ɔɪ|d|ə}}; {{IPA-de|ˈʃaːdn̩ˌfʁɔʏ̯də|lang|Schadenfreude-native-german.flac}}; {{abbrlink|lit.|literal translation}} 'harm-joy') is the experience of pleasure, joy, or self-satisfaction that comes from learning of or witnessing the troubles, failures, or humiliation of another. It is one of four related emotions or concepts.

Schadenfreude is a complex negative emotion. Rather than feeling sympathy towards someones misfortune, schadenfreude evokes joyful feelings that take pleasure from watching someone fail. This emotion is displayed more in children than adults, however adults also experience schadenfreude, they are just better at concealing their expressions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Paulus |first1=Shannon |title=Schadenfreude is a Childish Emotion |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/schadenfreude-childish-emotion-180952163/ |website=smithsonian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;,

== Etymology ==
''Schadenfreude'' is borrowed from [[German language|German]]; it is a compound of ''Schaden'', "damage, harm", and ''Freude'', "joy". The German word was first mentioned in English texts in 1852 and 1867, and first used in English running text in 1895.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', 1982, [http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/172271 ''s.v.'']&lt;/ref&gt; In German, it was first attested in the 1740s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/search?q=%22schadenfreude%22&amp;lr=lang_de&amp;source=lnt&amp;tbs=lr%3Alang_1de%2Ccdr%3A1%2Ccd_min%3A1%2F1%2F1600%2Ccd_max%3A12%2F31%2F1750&amp;tbm=bks Google Books] (the 1659 and 1700 dates are incorrect)&lt;/ref&gt;

Though [[Proper noun|common nouns]] are normally not capitalised in English, ''Schadenfreude'' is sometimes capitalised following the German [[German orthography#Spelling of nouns|convention]].

==What motivates schadenfreude==
Researchers have found that there are three driving forces behind schadenfreude: aggression, rivalry, and justice. The people who experience schadenfreude usually have low self esteem. Seeing another person fail brings them a small surge of confidence. Whereas, seeing someone who is successful poses as a threat to their sense of self and seeing the 'mighty' fall can be a source of comfort&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hendricks |first1=Scotty |title=3 types of Schadenfreude and when you feel them |url=https://bigthink.com/mind-brain/schadenfreude-and-psychopathy}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

*Schadenfreude that is agression based involves group identity. With aggression based schadenfreude, it involves a group such as a team or family.

*Rivalry schadenfreude is individualistic. It happens when a person goes out of their way to dominate another persons actions in order to see them fail.

*Justice based schadenfreude is the type of joy a person experiences when someone gets busted for doing something wrong. For example, a successful person who cheats and robs finally gets caught for his wrongdoing, the schadenfreude experienced here would be justice.

== Synonyms ==
''Schadenfreude'' has equivalents in other languages (for example, German, Dutch, Arabic, Hebrew, Bangla, Czech, Norwegian and Finnish), but no commonly used precise English single-word equivalent. There are other ways to express the concept in English.

"Epicaricacy" is a seldom-used direct equivalent,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Byrne |first=Josefa H. |year=1984 |title=Mrs. Byrne's Dictionary of Unusual, Obscure, and Preposterous Words |publisher=Pocket |location= |isbn=0-671-49782-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; borrowed from [[Greek lan

"[[Tall poppy syndrome]]" is a cultural phenomenon where people of high status are resented, attacked, cut down, or criticized because they have been classified as better than their peers. This is similar to begrudgery, the resentment or envy of the success of a peer. If someone were to feel joy by the victim’s fall from grace, they would be experiencing ''Schadenfreude''.

A "Roman holiday" is a metaphor from [[George Gordon, Lord Byron|Byron's]] poem ''[[Childe Harold's Pilgrimage]]'', where a [[gladiator]] in [[ancient Rome]] expects to be "butchered to make a Roman holiday" while the audience would take pleasure from watching his suffering. The term suggests debauchery and disorder in addition to sadistic enjoyment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Roman%20holiday |title=Roman holiday – Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date=2007-04-25 |accessdate=2010-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Morose delectation" (''delectatio morosa'' in [[Latin language|Latin]]), meaning "the habit of dwelling with enjoyment on evil thoughts".&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/adorai/oed/morose definition of morose delectation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414034751/http://web.mit.edu/adorai/oed/morose |date=April 14, 2016}}, ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''&lt;/ref&gt; was considered by the medieval church to be a sin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2074.htm#6 ''Prima Secundae Partis, Q. 74''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160702011344/http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2074.htm#6 |date=July 2, 2016}}, ''The [[Summa Theologica]] of St. [[Thomas Aquinas]]'', Second and Revised Edition, 1920; Literally translated by Fathers of the English Dominican Province, Online Edition Copyright © 2006 by Kevin Knight.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=RPUuyWtO3eoC&amp;pg=PA139&amp;lpg=PA139&amp;dq=%22morose+delectation%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=QpmslAISN-&amp;sig=nL01zLP7iH1kR44-MBqhOGJilsc#PPA139,M1 ''Chapter 6 Proposing the Story of the World''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160827225210/https://books.google.com/books?id=RPUuyWtO3eoC&amp;pg=PA139&amp;lpg=PA139&amp;dq=%22morose+delectation%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=QpmslAISN-&amp;sig=nL01zLP7iH1kR44-MBqhOGJilsc#PPA139,M1 |date=August 27, 2016}}, Richard John Neuhaus, Catholic Matters: Confusion, Controversy, and the Splendor of Truth, Basic Books, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; [[France|French]] writer [[Pierre Klossowski]] maintained that the appeal of [[Sadomasochism|sadism]] is morose delectation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minerva.mic.ul.ie//vol10/Religion.html ''Heterodox Religion and Post-Atheism: Bataille / Klossowski/ Foucault''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426064629/http://www.minerva.mic.ul.ie/ |date=April 26, 2016}}, Jones Irwin, ISSN 1393-614X Minerva – An Internet Journal of Philosophy Vol. 10 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre Klossowski|Klossowski, Pierre]]. 1991.

"Gloating" is an English word of similar meaning, where "[[gloat]]" means "to observe or think about something with triumphant and often malicious satisfaction, gratification, or delight" (e.g., to gloat over an enemy's misfortune).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/gloat "Dictionary definition of gloat"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160827125609/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/gloat |date=August 27, 2016}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Gloating is different from ''Schadenfreude'' in that it does not necessarily require malice (one may gloat to a friend about having defeated him in a game without ill intent), and that it describes an action rather than a state of mind (one typically gloats to the subject of the misfortune or to a third party). Also, unlike ''Schadenfreude'', where the focus is on another's misfortune, gloating often brings to mind inappropriately celebrating or bragging about one's own good fortune without any particular focus on the misfortune of others.

== Related emotions or concepts ==
Permutations of the concept of pleasure at another's unhappiness are: pleasure at another's happiness, displeasure at another's happiness, and displeasure at another's unhappiness. Words for these concepts are sometimes cited as [[antonym]]s to ''Schadenfreude'', as each is the [[opposite (semantics)|opposite]] in some way.

Pleasure at another's happiness is described by the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] concept of ''[[mudita]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.muditajournal.com/archives/000266.php ''The Upside of Shadenfreude''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160413072532/http://www.muditajournal.com/archives/000266.php |date=April 13, 2016}}, Joshua Zader, Mudita Journal, December 6, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sirtumble.blogspot.com/2005/02/are-you-schadenfreude-or-mudita.html ''Are you Schadenfreude or Mudita?''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311235315/http://sirtumble.blogspot.com/2005/02/are-you-schadenfreude-or-mudita.html |date=March 11, 2016}}, Sirtumble, One of Six Billion..., February 6, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nell |first1=Regen |title=Regen |journal=Iowa City Public Library and the International Writing Program Panel Series |date=September 16, 2011 |url=https://iwp.uiowa.edu/sites/iwp/files/Regan_ICPL2011_0.pdf |accessdate=17 July 2017 |ref=https://iwp.uiowa.edu/ |series=The International Writing Program |publisher=University of Iowa}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the concept of "[[compersion]]" in the [[polyamory]] community.

Displeasure at another's happiness is involved in [[envy]], and perhaps in [[jealousy]]. The recent coinage "freudenschade" similarly means sorrow at another's success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://groups.yahoo.com/group/wwftd/message/1226 |title=Yahoo Groups "worthless word for the day is ... freudenschade" |publisher=Groups.yahoo.com |accessdate=2010-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080513182307/http://daily.stanford.edu/article/2006/4/28/freudenschade Daily Stanford (2006) "Freudenschade"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Displeasure at another's unhappiness is [[sympathy]], [[pity]], or [[compassion]].

"[[Sadistic personality disorder|Sadism]]" is pleasure derived from the ''infliction'' of pain, whereas schadenfreude is pleasure on ''observing'' misfortune and in particular the fact that the other somehow deserved the misfortune.&lt;ref&gt;Aaron Ben-Ze'ev, "The personal comparative concern in schadenfreude" in Wilco W. can Dijk, Jaap W. Ouwerkerk, eds., ''Schadenfreude: Understanding Pleasure at the Misfortune of Others'', Cambridge 2014, {{ISBN|1107017505}}, p. 86''f''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Neologisms and variants ==
[[Neologisms]] and [[portmanteau]] words were coined from the word as early as 1993, when Lincoln Caplan, in his book ''Skadden: Power, Money, and the Rise of a Legal Empire'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Latest activity 19 hours ago |title=Skadden: Power, Money, and the Rise of a Legal Empire (9780374524241): Lincoln Caplan: Books |publisher=Amazon.com |isbn=0374524246}}&lt;/ref&gt; used the word ''Skaddenfreude'' to describe the delight that competitors of [[Skadden Arps]] took in its troubles of the early 1990s. Others include ''spitzenfreude'', coined by ''[[The Economist]]'' to refer to the fall of [[Eliot Spitzer prostitution scandal|Eliot Spitzer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/world/unitedstates/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10852872 |title=Premium content |publisher=Economist.com |date=2008-03-13 |accessdate=2010-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Schadenford'', coined by ''[[Toronto Life]]'' in regard to Canadian politician [[Rob Ford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=When the Ford jokes stop |author=Bartley Kives |url=http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/opinion/columnists/when-the-ford-jokes-stop-208982891.html |newspaper=[[Winnipeg Free Press]] |date=26 May 2013 |accessdate=26 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Literary usage and philosophical analysis ==
The [[Book of Proverbs]] mentions an emotion similar to ''Schadenfreude'': "Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth, and let not thine heart be glad when he stumbleth: Lest the LORD see it, and it displease him, and he turn away his wrath from him." (Proverbs 24:17–18, [[King James Version]]).

In the ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'', [[Aristotle]] used ''epikhairekakia'' (ἐπιχαιρεκακία in Greek) as part of a triad of terms, in which ''epikhairekakia'' stands as the opposite of ''[[phthonos]]'' (φθόνος), and ''[[Archenemy|nemesis]]'' (νέμεσις) occupies the mean. ''Nemesis'' is "a painful response to another's undeserved good fortune", while ''phthonos'' is a painful response to any good fortune, deserved or not. The ''epikhairekakos'' (ἐπιχαιρέκακος) person takes pleasure in another's ill fortune.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pedrick |first=Victoria |authorlink= |author2=Oberhelman, Steven M. |year=2006 |title=The Soul of Tragedy: Essays on Athenian Drama |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago, IL |isbn=978-0-226-65306-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Page:The ethics of Aristotle.djvu/68|''Nicomachean Ethics'', 2.7.1108b1-10]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lucretius]] characterises the emotion in an extended [[simile]] in ''[[De rerum natura]]'': ''Suave, mari magno turbantibus aequora ventis, e terra magnum alterius spectare laborem'', "It is pleasant to watch from the land the great struggle of someone else in a sea rendered great by turbulent winds." The abbreviated [[List of Latin phrases|Latin tag]] ''suave mare magno'' recalled the passage to generations familiar with the Latin classics.&lt;ref&gt;[[Patrick O'Brian]]'s usage of the tag in his Aubrey-Maturin historical novels is reflected in Dean King's companion lexicon ''A Sea of Words'' (3rd ed.2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Caesarius of Heisterbach]] regards "delight in the adversity of a neighbour" as one of the "daughters of envy ... which follows anger" in his ''Dialogue on Miracles''.&lt;ref&gt;''Dialogus miraculorum'', IV, 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[17th century philosophy|17th century]], [[Robert Burton (scholar)|Robert Burton]] wrote in his work ''[[The Anatomy of Melancholy]]'', "Out of these two [the concupiscible and irascible powers] arise those mixed affections and passions of [[anger]], which is a desire of revenge; hatred, which is inveterate anger; zeal, which is offended with him who hurts that he loves; and ἐπιχαιρεκακία, a compound affection of joy and hate, when we rejoice at other men's mischief, and are grieved at their prosperity; [[pride]], [[self-love]], emulation, envy, [[shame]], &amp;c., of which elsewhere."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |year=1621 |title=The Anatomy of Melancholy |author=Robert Burton |pages=t. 1, sect. 1, memb. 2, subsect. 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosopher [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] mentioned ''Schadenfreude'' as the most evil sin of human feeling, famously saying "To feel envy is human, to savor schadenfreude is diabolic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Schopenhauer |first=Arthur |title=The Essays of Arthur Schopenhauer On Human Nature |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/10739/pg10739.html |work=On Human Nature |quote=But it is ''Schadenfreude'', a mischievous delight in the misfortunes of others, which remains the worst trait in human nature. It is a feeling which is closely akin to cruelty, and differs from it, to say the truth, only as theory from practice.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbi [[Harold S. Kushner]] in his book ''[[When Bad Things Happen to Good People]]'' describes ''Schadenfreude'' as a universal, even wholesome reaction that cannot be helped. "There is a German psychological term, ''Schadenfreude'', which refers to the embarrassing reaction of relief we feel when something bad happens to someone else instead of to us." He gives examples and writes, "[People] don't wish their friends ill, but they can’t help feeling an embarrassing spasm of gratitude that [the bad thing] happened to someone else and not to them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |year=1981 |title=When Bad Things Happen to Good People |author=Harold S. Kushner |publisher=first published by Schocken Books |page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Susan Sontag]]'s book ''[[Regarding the Pain of Others]]'', published in 2003, is a study of the issue of how the pain and misfortune of some people affects others, namely whether [[war photography]] and [[War art|war paintings]] may be helpful as anti-war tools, or whether they only serve some sense of ''Schadenfreude'' in some viewers.

[[Philosopher]] and [[sociologist]] [[Theodor Adorno]] defined schadenfreude as "... largely unanticipated delight in the suffering of another, which is cognized as trivial and/or appropriate."&lt;ref&gt;Cited in {{cite book |author=Portmann, John |title=When bad things happen to other people |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=2000 |isbn=0-415-92335-2 |oclc= |doi= |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scientific studies ==
A ''[[New York Times]]'' article in 2002 cited a number of scientific studies of ''Schadenfreude'', which it defined as "delighting in others' misfortune". Many such studies are based on [[social comparison theory]], the idea that when people around us have bad luck, we look better to ourselves. Other researchers have found that people with low [[self-esteem]] are more likely to feel ''Schadenfreude'' than are those who have high self-esteem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=St. John |first=Warren |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE3D6153CF937A1575BC0A9649C8B63 |title=Sorrow So Sweet: A Guilty Pleasure in Another's Woe |newspaper=The New York Times |date=24 August 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2003 study examined intergroup ''Schadenfreude'' within the context of sports, specifically an international football (soccer) competition. The study focused on the German and Dutch football teams and their fans. The results of this study indicated that the emotion of''Schadenfreude'' is very sensitive to circumstances that make it more or less legitimate to feel such malicious pleasure towards a sports rival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Leach |first=C. |author2=Spears, R. |author3=Branscombe, N.

A 2011 study by Cikara and colleagues using [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) examined ''Schadenfreude'' among [[Boston Red Sox]] and [[New York Yankees]] fans, and found that fans showed increased activation in brain areas correlated with self-reported pleasure ([[ventral striatum]]) when observing the rival team experience a negative outcome (e.g., a [[strikeout]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Us Versus Them Social Identity Shapes Neural Responses to Intergroup Competition and Harm |url=http://pss.sagepub.com/content/22/3/306 |journal=Psychological Science |date=2011-03-01 |issn=0956-7976 |pmc=3833634 |pmid=21270447 |pages=306–313 |volume=22 |issue=3 |doi=10.1177/0956797610397667 |first=Mina |last=Cikara |first2=Matthew M. |last2=Botvinick |first3=Susan T. |last3=Fiske}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, fans exhibited increased activation in the [[Anterior cingulate cortex|anterior cingulate]] and insula when viewing their own team experience a negative outcome.

A 2006 experiment about justice served suggests that men, but not women, enjoy seeing "bad people" suffer. The study was designed to measure empathy, by watching which brain centers are stimulated when subjects observed via fMRI see someone experiencing physical [[pain]]. Researchers expected that the brain's empathy center of subjects would show more stimulation when those seen as "good" got an electric shock, than would occur if the shock was given to someone the subject had reason to consider "bad". This was indeed the case, but for male subjects, the brain's pleasure centers also lit up when someone got a shock that the male thought was "well-deserved".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Singer T |author2=Seymour B |author3=O'Doherty JP |author4=Stephan KE |author5=Dolan RJ |author6=Frith CD |title=Empathic neural responses are modulated by the perceived fairness of others |journal=Nature |volume=439 |issue=7075 |pages=466–9 |date=January 2006 |pmid=16421576 |doi=10.1038/nature04271 |url= |pmc=2636868 |bibcode=2006Natur.439..466S}} [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/19/science/19revenge.html?ex=1139547600&amp;en=5cb415405edddd2e&amp;ei=5070l Lay-summary] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416211358/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/19/science/19revenge.html?ex=1139547600&amp;en=5cb415405edddd2e&amp;ei=5070l |date=April 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brain-scanning studies show that ''Schadenfreude'' is correlated with envy in subjects. Strong feelings of envy activated physical pain nodes in the brain's dorsal [[anterior cingulate cortex]]; the brain's reward centers, such as the [[ventral striatum]], were activated by news that other people envied had suffered misfortune. The magnitude of the brain's ''Schadenfreude'' response could even be predicted from the strength of the previous envy response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/323/5916/937 |journal=Science |date=2009-02-13 |title=When Your Gain Is My Pain and Your Pain Is My Gain: Neural Correlates of Envy and Schadenfreude |doi=10.1126/science.1165604 |last1=Takahashi |first1=H. |last2=Kato |first2=M. |last3=Matsuura |first3=M. |last4=Mobbs |first4=D. |last5=Suhara |first5=T. |last6=Okubo |first6=Y. |volume=323 |issue=5916 |pages=937–9 |pmid=19213918 |bibcode=2009Sci...323..937T }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/17/science/17angi.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=17 February 2009 |title=In Pain and Joy of Envy, the Brain May Play a Role |first=Natalie |last=Angier}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study conducted in 2009 provides evidence for people's capacity to feel ''Schadenfreude'' in response to negative events in politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Combs |first=D. J. Y.|author2=Powell, C. A. J. |author3=Schurtz, D. R. |author4=Smith, R.

It was reported in the study that the likelihood of experiencing feelings of ''Schadenfreude'' depends upon whether an individual's own party or the opposing party is suffering harm. This study suggests that the domain of politics is prime territory for feelings of ''Schadenfreude'', especially for those who identify strongly with their political party.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21010">'''Self-licensing''' (aka [[noble cause corruption]], '''''moral self-licensing''''', '''''moral licensing''''', '''''licensing effect''''', '''moral credential effect''') is a term used in [[social psychology]] and [[marketing]] to describe the [[subconscious]] phenomenon whereby increased confidence and security in one’s [[self-image]] or [[self-concept]] tends to make that individual worry less about the consequences of subsequent [[immoral]] behavior and, therefore, more likely to make immoral choices and act immorally.&lt;ref name=Sachdeva&gt;{{cite journal|title=Sinning saints and saintly sinners: The paradox of  moral self-regulation|journal=Psychological Science|year=2009|volume=20|issue=4|pages=523–528|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2009.02326.x|pmid=19320857|last1=Sachdeva|first1=S|last2=Iliev|first2=R|last3=Medin|first3=D.

A large subset of this effect, the '''moral credential effect''', is a bias that occurs when a person's track record as a good egalitarian establishes in them an unconscious ethical certification, endorsement, or license that increases the likelihood of less egalitarian decisions later. This effect occurs even when the audience or moral peer group is unaware of the affected person's previously established moral credential. For example, individuals who had the opportunity to recruit a woman or African American person in one setting were more likely to say later, in a different setting, that a job would be better suited for a man or a Caucasian person.{{r|Monin2001}} Similar effects also appear to occur when a person observes another person from a group they identify with making an egalitarian decision.&lt;ref name="Kouchaki2011"/&gt;

Self-licensing can have negative societal consequences since it has a permissive effect on behaviors such as racial prejudice and discrimination, selfishness, poor dietary and health habits, and excessive energy consumption.

==Definitions==
Researchers Uzma Khan and Ravi Dhar describe the phenomena as follows:&lt;ref name=Khan2/&gt;

{{quote|The moral licensing effect is a non conscious effect that operates by providing a moral boost in the self-concept, which increases the preference for a relative immoral action subsequently by dampening the negative self attributions associated with such behavior.

Prior choices that activate and boost the self-concept, are likely to subsequently license more self-indulgent choices...Licensing can operate through an expression of the intent to be virtuous, which reduces negative self-attributions associated with the purchase of relative luxuries.}}

Similarly, Anna Merritt and colleagues have explained that

{{quote|Past good deeds can liberate individuals to engage in behaviors that are immoral, unethical, or otherwise problematic, behaviors that they would otherwise avoid for fear of feeling or appearing immoral.&lt;ref name=Merritt/&gt;}}

==Group membership==
It has been found that moral credentials can be obtained vicariously. That is, a person will behave as if they themselves have moral credentials when that person observes another person from a group they identify with making an egalitarian decision.&lt;ref name="Kouchaki2011"/&gt; In research that draws on [[social identity theory]] it was also found that group membership moderates the effectiveness of moral credentials in mitigating perceptions of prejudice. Specifically, it was observed that displays of moral credentials have more effect between people who share [[ingroups and outgroups|in-group]] status.&lt;ref name=Krumm2008/&gt;

==Examples==
Research suggests that self-licensing affects moral self-regulation and individual behavior in a variety of contexts; for example, it can influence consumer purchases, political opinions, charitable giving, energy policy and home energy use, job hiring, racial attitudes, health-related decision-making, [[risky sexual behavior]], alcohol consumption, and [[dietary supplement]] use.&lt;ref name=Khan2&gt;{{cite journal|title=Licensing effect in consumer choice |journal=Journal of Marketing Research|year=2006|volume=43|issue=2 |pages=259–266 |url=http://faculty.som.yale.edu/ravidhar/documents/LicensingEffectinConsumerChoice.pdf|doi=10.1509/jmkr.43.2.259|last1=Khan|first1=Uzma|last2=Dhar|first2=Ravi}} [http://www.marketingpower.com/AboutAMA/Pages/AMA%20Publications/AMA%20Journals/Journal%20of%20Marketing%20Research/TOCs/SUM_2006.2/Licensing_Effect.aspx Executive summary].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kuo&gt;{{cite news|last=Kuo|first=Iris|title='Licensing effect' seen in dieting, charity, hiring|accessdate=2012-08-09|newspaper=Knight Ridder/Tribune Information Services|date=February 1, 2006|url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/latest-news/article24453595.html|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160529093131/http://www.mcclatchydc.com/latest-news/article24453595.html|archivedate=May 29, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rosenwald&gt;{{cite news|last=Rosenwald|first=Michael S|title=Why going green won't make you better or save you money|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/16/AR2010071606839.html|accessdate=2012-08-09|newspaper=Washington Post|date=July 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Chernev&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chernev|first=Alexander|title=The Dieter's Paradox|journal=Journal of Consumer Psychology|volume=21|issue=2|pages=178–183|year=2010|doi=10.1016/j.jcps.2010.08.002 |url=http://www.myscp.org/pdf/short%20articles/JCPS_10-00088_180.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Chiou&gt;{{cite journal|title=Ironic effects of dietary supplementation: illusory invulnerability created by taking dietary supplements licenses health-risk behaviors |journal=Psychological Science |year=2011 |volume=22 |issue=8 |pmid=21764996 |doi=10.1177/0956797611416253 |pages=1081–1086 |last1=Chiou |first1=W.

{{quote|We drink Diet Coke – with Quarter Pounders and fries at McDonald's. We go to the gym – and ride the elevator to the second floor. We install tankless water heaters – then take longer showers. We drive SUVs to see Al Gore's speeches on global warming.&lt;ref name=Rosenwald/&gt;}}

===Dietary supplement use and unhealthy behavior===
A 2011 study published by researchers in Taiwan indicated that people who take [[multivitamin]] pills, especially those who believe that they are receiving significant health benefits from supplement use, are more prone to subsequently engage in unhealthy activities.&lt;ref name=Chiou/&gt;&lt;ref name=Goldacre/&gt;&lt;ref name=Huget/&gt; Participants in the study were divided into two groups, both of which were given [[placebo]] pills; one group was correctly informed that the pills contained no active ingredients and the other group was told that the pills were multivitamin supplements. Survey results showed that participants who thought that they had received a multivitamin were predisposed to smoking more cigarettes and more likely to believe that they were invulnerable to harm, injury, and disease as compared with subjects who knew that they were given a placebo. Participants who believed they were given a multivitamin were also less likely to exercise and to choose healthier food, and had a higher desire to engage in "hedonic activities that involve instant gratification but pose long-term health hazards", such as casual sex, sunbathing, wild parties, and excessive drinking. In the 'multivitamin' group, the more supplements a participant used, the less likely they were to exercise, and smoking was highest among participants who expressed a conscious belief that multivitamins increased health. 
 
The study's authors argued that because dietary supplements are perceived as conferring health advantages, use of such supplements may create an illusory sense of invulnerability that disinhibits unhealthy behaviors. Overall, the study shows that people who take supplements may feel that merely taking a pill is a sufficient contribution to healthful living to enjoy other activities without regard to health, and it exposes a potential hypocrisy among supplement users.&lt;ref name=Huget/&gt; The authors advised:

{{quote|Smokers who take dietary supplements can fool themselves into thinking they are protected against cancer and other diseases. Reminding health conscious smokers that multivitamins don't prevent cancer may help them control their smoking or even encourage them to stop.&lt;ref name=Healthdaily&gt;{{cite news|title='Licensing effect' negating the benefit of vitamins|url=http://www.healthdaily.co.uk/wellbeing/2011/08/04/licensing-effect-negating-the-benefit-of-vitamins|newspaper=Health Daily|date=August 4, 2011|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022152225/http://www.healthdaily.co.uk/wellbeing/2011/08/04/licensing-effect-negating-the-benefit-of-vitamins|archivedate=October 22, 2013|df=}} Cites {{harvtxt|Chiou|Yang|Wan|2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Commenting on the implications of the study, [[Ben Goldacre]] said:

{{quote|Believing, incorrectly, that you've done something healthy by taking a vitamin pill makes you more likely to take genuine, concrete, real-world risks with your health. It's a chilling thought, but ideas aren't without impact, and every time we humour a harmless myth – that vitamin pills are healthy, that some fashionable berry prevents cancer – we might be doing more harm than we think.&lt;ref name=Goldacre/&gt;}}

===Consumer purchasing decisions===
Researchers Khan and Dhar investigated the influence of self-licensing on consumer decisions regarding the purchase of luxury goods. They reasoned that "relative preferences for a luxury option will be higher if people's prior decisions provide a boost to their relevant self-concept". Due to the self-licensing effect, "a prior intent to be virtuous boosts respondents' self-concepts, thus reducing negative self-attributions associated with the purchase of relative luxuries". Furthermore, they predicted that consumers may be unaware of how their prior decision influences their subsequent choices; i.e. the process underlying the licensing effect may be largely nonconscious.&lt;ref name=Khan2/&gt; In the study, some participants were first asked to select from a list a charity organizations for which they would willingly volunteer three hours a week. Later, these people—and participants who hadn't been asked to volunteer—were asked whether they would buy designer jeans or an identically priced vacuum cleaner, assuming that they had enough money to buy only one. Participants who were asked to imagine having committed the charitable act before shopping were more than twice as likely to choose the jeans. The authors noted that "People don't even have to do good for this effect to happen…Even if they plan to do something good, it will give them a boost in their self-image. Any type of situation where you have guilt involved, you will see this, and so this happens in luxury goods."&lt;ref name=Kuo/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rosenwald/&gt;

A study by University of Toronto behavioral marketing professor Nina Mazar and Chen-Bo Zhong found that people who bought green products were more likely to cheat and steal than those who bought conventional products.&lt;ref name=Rosenwald/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mazar2010"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Do Green Products Make Us Better People?|journal=Psychological Science|volume=21|issue=4|pages=494–498|date=2010|doi=10.1177/0956797610363538|pmid=20424089|last1=Mazar|first1=N|last2=Zhong|first2=C. B.|url=http://www.chilleesys.com/scp/assets/mazar.pdf|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160529094546/http://www.chilleesys.com/scp/assets/mazar.pdf|archivedate=2016-05-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers conducted an experiment in which they asked college students to shop for products online from either an [[eco-friendly]] or a conventional store. Each subject was then asked to divide a small sum of money between themselves and a stranger in a paradigm known as the [[dictator game]], in which participants can cheat to make more money. The shoppers from the green store were more dishonest than those at the conventional store, which brought them higher earnings in the game. The authors suggested that the results could be accounted for by the licensing effect, noting that "When we engage in a good deed, that gives us a kind of satisfaction. With that self-satisfied feeling can come tacit permission to behave more selfishly next time we have the opportunity". The authors added that "purchasing green products may license indulgence in self-interested and unethical behaviors", and concluded:

{{quote|We find that mere exposure to green products and the purchase of them lead to markedly different behavioral consequences. In line with the halo associated with green consumerism, people act more altruistically after mere exposure to green than conventional products; however, people act less altruistically and are more likely to cheat and steal after purchasing green products as opposed to conventional products.}}

===Energy use===
Researchers have invoked the self-licensing effect to explain why consumers who opt for energy-efficient products increase their energy usage so as to offset any potential gains. Energy economist Lucas Davis published a study showing that after getting high-efficiency washers, consumers increased clothes washing by nearly 6 percent.&lt;ref name=Davis&gt;{{cite journal|title=Durable goods and residential demand for energy and water: evidence from a field trial|journal=[[RAND]] Journal of Economics|year=2008|volume=39|issue=2|pages=530–46|doi=10.1111/j.0741-6261.2008.00026.x|jstor=25474381|last1=Davis|first1=Lucas W.|url=http://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/ldavis/Davis%20RAND%202008.pdf|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160529122439/http://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/ldavis/Davis%20RAND%202008.pdf|archivedate=2016-05-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies have shown that people leave energy-efficient lights on longer than conventional lights, and that many people who make their homes more energy efficient turn their heating up and ultimately see no reduction in energy costs.&lt;ref name=Rosenwald/&gt;

===Political opinions and racial bias===
{{main|Moral credential effect}}
The self-licensing effect was examined by Monin and Miller in a 2001 study which demonstrated that when participants established credentials as non-prejudiced persons, they were more willing to express politically incorrect opinions despite the fact that the audience was unaware of their credentials.&lt;ref name=monin/&gt; Subsequent research by Monin and Daniel Effron showed that an opportunity to endorse [[Barack Obama]] during the 2008 presidential election made his supporters more likely to express views that favored Whites at the expense of African-Americans.&lt;ref name=Effron&gt;{{cite journal|title=Endorsing Obama licenses favoring Whites|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|year=2009|volume=45|issue=3|pages=590–593 |url=http://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/jesss/Effron,%20Cameron,%20&amp;%20Monin,%202009.pdf|doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2009.02.001|last1=Effron|first1=Daniel A.|last2=Cameron|first2=Jessica S.|last3=Monin|first3=Benoît|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stanford&gt;{{cite news|title=Backing Obama gives some voters license to favor whites over blacks, study shows|url=http://news.stanford.edu/pr/2009/pr-obamarac-030409.html|accessdate=2012-08-09|newspaper=Stanford University News Service|date=March 2, 2009}} Cites {{harvtxt|Effron|Cameron|Monin|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially, the endorsement made people feel like they had shown that they were not biased, giving them a license to subsequently express racially prejudicial views.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3641">[[File:Idealstadt.jpg|thumb|Plan of Sforzinda]]
'''Sforzinda''' is a visionary [[ideal city]] named after [[Francesco Sforza]], then Duke of [[Milan]]. It was designed  by [[Italian Renaissance|Renaissance]] architect Antonio di Pietro Averlino (c. 1400 - c. 1469), also known as "Averulino"  or  [[Filarete]].  Although Sforzinda was never built, certain aspects of its design are described in considerable detail. The basic layout of the city is an eight point star, created by overlaying two squares so that all the corners were equidistant. This shape is then inscribed within a perfect circular moat. This shape is iconographic and probably ties to Filarete’s interest in magic and astrology. Consistent with ''Quattrocento'' or fifteenth century notions concerning the talismanic power of geometry and the crucial importance of astrology, Filarete provides, in addition to pragmatic advice on materials, construction, and fortifications, notes on how to propitiate celestial harmony within Sforzinda.

In terms of planning, each of the outer points of the star had towers, while the inner angles had gates. Each of the gates was an outlet of radial avenues that each passed through a market square, dedicated to certain goods. All the avenues finally converged in a large square which was centrally located. The town contained three squares – one for the prince’s palace, one for the cathedral, and one for the market. Because the Renaissance was much taken with the idea of the canal town, in Filarete's Sforzinda every other street had a canal for cargo transport. The canal system also connected with the river, and thus the outside world, for the import and export of goods. The city also contained many buildings, including parishes and separate schools for boys and girls. An example of a building that appears in the treatise is Filarete’s House of Vice and Virtue, a ten-story structure with a brothel on the bottom and an academy of learning on the higher levels. Filarete did much study on representation of Vices and Virtues, and there are suggestions that his radial design for the city was inspired by [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]]’s Earthly City, whose circular shape was divided into sections, each of which had its own Vice and Virtue.

The design of Sforzinda may have been in part a direct response to the congested cities of the Medieval period, whose organic growth did not ordinarily depend on conscious [[Planned community|city planning]],&lt;ref&gt;Exceptions are the new cities, called ''[[bastide]]s'', founded from the 12th to 14th centuries in southeastern France, in order to replace destroyed cities and organize defence and growth. Among those, [[Monpazier]], [[Beaumont-du-Périgord]] and [[Villeréal]] may be cited.&lt;/ref&gt; which meant they could be difficult to navigate or control. In part, the Renaissance humanist interest in classical texts may have stimulated preoccupations with geometry in city layouts, as for example, in [[Plato]]'s description of [[Atlantis]]. Filarete’s ideal plan was meant to reflect on society – where a perfect city form would be the image of a perfect society, an idea that was typical of the humanist views prevalent during the Renaissance. The Renaissance ideal city, implied the centralized power of a prince in its organization, an idea following closely on the heels of [[Dante]]’s that “The human race is at its best under a monarch.” Thus it could be argued that the Renaissance ideal city form was tensioned between the perceived need for a centralized power and the potential reality of tyranny.

'''Spinozism''' (also spelled '''Spinozaism''') is the [[monism|monist]] [[philosophy|philosophical]] system of [[Benedict de Spinoza]] that defines "[[God]]" as a singular self-subsistent Substance, with both matter and thought being attributes of such.

In a letter to [[Henry Oldenburg]], Spinoza wrote: "as to the view of certain people that I identify god with nature (taken as a kind of mass or corporeal matter), they are quite mistaken".&lt;ref&gt;Correspondence of Benedict de Spinoza, Wilder Publications (March 26, 2009), {{ISBN|1-60459-156-0}}, letter 73&lt;/ref&gt; For Spinoza, our universe (cosmos) is a ''mode'' under two ''attributes'' of [[Thought]] and [[Extension (metaphysics)|Extension]]. God has infinitely many other attributes which are not present in our world. According to German philosopher [[Karl Jaspers]], when Spinoza wrote "''Deus sive Natura''" ("God or Nature") Spinoza meant God was ''[[Natura naturans]]'' not ''[[Natura naturata]]'', that is, "a dynamic nature in action, growing and changing, not a passive or static thing."

==Core doctrine==
In Spinozism, the concept of a personal relationship with God comes from the position that one is a part of an infinite interdependent "organism." Spinoza argued that everything is a derivative of God, interconnected with all of existence. Although humans experience only thought and extension, what happens to one aspect of existence will affect others. Thus, Spinozism teaches a form of [[determinism]] and [[ecology]], and uses these as a basis for morality.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

Additionally, a core doctrine of Spinozism is that the universe is essentially [[deterministic]]. All that happens or will happen could not have unfolded in any other way. Spinoza claimed that the third kind of knowledge, [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]], is the highest kind. More specifically, he defined intuition as the ability of the human intellect to intuit knowledge based upon its accumulated understanding of the world.

Spinoza's [[metaphysics]] consists of one thing, Substance, and its modifications (modes). Early in ''The Ethics'' Spinoza argues that there is only one Substance, which is absolutely [[Infinity|infinite]], self-caused, and eternal. Substance causes an infinite number of attributes (the intellect perceiving an abstract concept or essence) and modes (things following from attributes and modes). He calls this Substance "[[God]]", or "[[Nature]]". In fact, he takes these two terms to be [[synonymous]] (in the [[Latin]] the phrase he uses is ''"Deus sive Natura"''), but readers often disregard his neutral monism. During his time, this statement was seen as literally equating the existing world with God&amp;nbsp;- for which he was accused of atheism. Spinoza asserted that the whole of the [[natural]] [[universe]] is made of one Substance &amp;ndash; God or Nature &amp;ndash; and its modifications (modes).
{{quote|It cannot be overemphasized how the rest of Spinoza's philosophy, his philosophy of mind, epistemology, psychology, moral philosophy, political philosophy, and philosophy of religion&amp;nbsp;– flows more or less directly from the metaphysical underpinnings in Part I of the ''Ethics''.&lt;ref&gt;Della Rocca, Michael. (2008). ''Spinoza''. Routledge., pg. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
One should, however, remember the neutral monist position. While the natural universe humans experience in the realm of mind and physical reality is part of God, it is only two modes&amp;nbsp;– thought and extension&amp;nbsp;– that are part of infinite modes emanating from God.

Spinoza's doctrine was considered radical at the time he published, and he was widely seen as the most infamous atheist-heretic of Europe. His philosophy was part of the philosophic debate in Europe during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], along with [[Cartesianism]]. Specifically, Spinoza disagreed with Descartes on substance duality, Descartes' views on the will and the intellect, and the subject of free will.&lt;ref&gt;Michael L. Morgan, ed., ''Spinoza: Complete Works'', translated by Samuel Shirley (Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing, 2002), 119n6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Substance===
Spinoza defines "Substance" as follows:
{{quote|By substance I understand what is in itself and is conceived through itself, ''i.e.'', that whose concept does not require the concept of another thing, from which it must be formed. (E1D3)&lt;ref name="curley85" &gt;Curley, Edwin M. (1985). The Collected Works of Spinoza. Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
This means, essentially, that Substance is just whatever can be thought of without relating it to any other idea or thing. For example, if one thinks of a [[particular]] [[Object (philosophy)|object]], one thinks of it as a kind of thing, ''e.g.'', ''x'' is a cat. Substance, on the other hand, is to be conceived of by itself, without understanding it as a particular kind of thing, because it isn't a particular thing.

===Attributes===
Spinoza defines "attribute" as follows:
{{quote|By attribute I understand what the intellect perceives of a substance, as constituting its essence. (E1D4)&lt;ref name=curley85 /&gt;}}
From this it can be seen that Attributes are related to Substance. It is not clear, however, even from Spinoza's direct definition, whether, a) Attributes are really the way(s) Substance is, or b) Attributes are simply ways to understand Substance, but not necessarily the ways it really is.
Spinoza thinks that there are an ''infinite'' number of Attributes, but there are two Attributes for which Spinoza thinks we can have knowledge. Namely, ''thought'' and ''extension''.&lt;ref name=sep4&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spinoza-attributes/ Stanford.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Thought ====
The attribute of thought is how Substance can be understood to be composed of thoughts, ''i.e.'', thinking things. When we understand a particular thing through the Attribute of thought, we are understanding the mode as an ''idea'' of something (either another idea, or an object).

==== Extension ====
The Attribute of extension is how Substance can be understood to be physically extended in space. Particular things that occupy space are what is meant by ''extended''. It [[Logical consequence|follows from]] this that if Substance and God are identical, in Spinoza's view, and contrary to the traditional conception, [[God]] has extension as one of his Attributes.

===Modes===
Modes are particular modifications of substance, ''i.e.'', particular things in the world. Spinoza gives the following definition:
{{quote|By mode I understand the affections of a substance, ''or'' that which is in another through which it is also conceived. (E1D5)&lt;ref name=curley85 /&gt;}}

===Substance monism===
The argument for there only being one Substance (or, more colloquially, one kind of stuff) in the universe occurs in the first fourteen propositions of ''The Ethics.'' The following proposition expresses Spinoza's commitment to substance monism:
{{quote|Except God, no substance can be or be conceived. (E1P14)&lt;ref name=curley85 /&gt;}}
Spinoza takes this proposition to follow directly from everything he says prior to it. Spinoza's [[monism]] is contrasted with Descartes' [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] and Leibniz's [[Pluralism (philosophy)|pluralism]]. Thus, Spinoza avoids the unsolvable problem of how mind and body interact, which troubled Descartes in his ''Meditations on First Philosophy.'' Specifically, how can immaterial mind interface with material body, and vice-versa? They exist in wholly different categories.

===Causality and Modality===
The issue of [[causality]] and [[Modal logic|modality]] ([[Logical possibility|possibility]] and [[Metaphysical necessity|necessity]]) in Spinoza's philosophy is contentious.&lt;ref name=sep5&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spinoza-modal/ Stanford.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; Spinoza's philosophy is, in one sense, thoroughly [[determinism|deterministic]] (or necessitarian). This can be seen directly from Axiom 3 of ''The Ethics'':
{{quote|From a given determinate cause the effect follows necessarily; and conversely, if there is no determinate cause, it is impossible for an effect to follow. (E1A3)&lt;ref name=curley85 /&gt;}}
Yet Spinoza seems to make room for a kind of freedom, especially in the fifth and final section of ''The Ethics'', ''"On the Power of the Intellect, or on Human Freedom"'':
{{quote|I pass now to the remaining Part of the Ethics, which concerns the means or way to Freedom. Here, then, I shall treat of the power of reason, showing what it can do against the affects, and what Freedom of Mind, or blessedness, is. (E5, Preface)&lt;ref name=curley85 /&gt;}}
So Spinoza certainly has a use for the word 'freedom', but he equates "Freedom of Mind" with "blessedness", a notion which is not traditionally associated with [[Free will|freedom of the will]] at all.

====The principle of sufficient reason (PSR)====
Though the [[Principle of sufficient reason|PSR]] is most commonly associated with [[Gottfried Leibniz]], it is arguably found in its strongest form in Spinoza's philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Della Rocca, Michael. (2008). ''Spinoza'', Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;
Within the context of Spinoza's philosophical system, the PSR can be understood to unify causation and explanation.&lt;ref name="Della Rocca, Spinoza, 2008"&gt;Della Rocca, ''Spinoza'', 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; What this means is that for Spinoza, questions regarding the ''reason'' why a given phenomenon is the way it is (or exists) are always answerable, and are always answerable in terms of the relevant cause(s). This constitutes a rejection of [[teleology|teleological]], or [[final cause|final causation]], except possibly in a more restricted sense for human beings.&lt;ref name=curley85 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Della Rocca, Spinoza, 2008"/&gt; Given this, Spinoza's views regarding causality and modality begin to make much more sense.

===Parallelism&lt;!--linked from 'Psychophysical parallelism'--&gt;===
Spinoza's philosophy contains as a key proposition the notion that mental and physical (thought and extension) phenomena occur in parallel, but without causal interaction between them. He expresses this proposition as follows:
{{quote|The order and connection of ideas is the same as the order and connection of things. (E2P7)&lt;ref name=curley85 /&gt;}}
His proof of this proposition is that:
{{quote|The knowledge of an effect depends on, and involves, the knowledge of its cause. (E1A4)&lt;ref name=curley85 /&gt;}}
The reason Spinoza thinks [[Psychophysical parallelism|parallelism]] follows from this axiom is that, since the idea we have of each thing requires knowledge of its cause, such a cause must be understood under the same attribute. Further, there is only one substance, so whenever we understand some chain of ideas concerning things, we understand that the way the ideas are causally related must be the same as the way the things themselves are related, since the ideas and the things are the same modes, but understood under different attributes.

==Pantheism controversy==
{{main|Pantheism controversy}}

In 1785, [[Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi]] published a condemnation of Spinoza's [[pantheism]], after [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]] was thought to have confessed on his deathbed to being a "Spinozist", which was the equivalent in his time of being called a [[heretic]]. Jacobi claimed that Spinoza's doctrine was pure materialism, because all Nature and God are said to be nothing but extended [[Substance theory|substance]]. This, for Jacobi, was the result of Enlightenment rationalism and it would finally end in absolute [[atheism]]. [[Moses Mendelssohn]] disagreed with Jacobi, saying that there is no actual difference between [[theism]] and pantheism. The entire issue became a major intellectual and religious concern for European civilization at the time, which [[Immanuel Kant]] rejected, as he thought that attempts to conceive of transcendent reality would lead to [[Antinomy|antinomies]] (statements that could be proven both right and wrong) in thought.

The attraction of Spinoza's philosophy to late eighteenth-century Europeans was that it provided an alternative to [[materialism]], atheism, and [[deism]]. Three of Spinoza's ideas strongly appealed to them:
* the unity of all that exists;
* the regularity of all that happens; and
* the identity of spirit and nature.

Spinoza's "God or Nature" [''Deus sive Natura''] provided a living, natural God, in contrast to the [[Newtonian mechanics|Newtonian mechanical]] "[[First Cause]]" or the dead mechanism of the [[Julien Offray de La Mettrie|French "Man Machine]]." Coleridge and Shelley saw in Spinoza's philosophy a ''religion of nature''&lt;ref name=tws908&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spinoza inspired the poet Shelley to write his essay "The Necessity of Atheism."&lt;ref name=tws9912/&gt;

Spinoza was considered to be an atheist because he used the word "God" [Deus] to signify a concept that was different from that of traditional Judeo–Christian monotheism. "Spinoza expressly denies personality and consciousness to God; he has neither intelligence, feeling, nor will; he does not act according to purpose, but everything follows necessarily from his nature, according to law...."&lt;ref&gt;Frank Thilly, ''A History of Philosophy'', § 47, Holt &amp; Co., New York, 1914&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Spinoza's cool, indifferent God differs from the concept of an anthropomorphic, fatherly God who cares about humanity.&lt;ref&gt;"I believe in Spinoza's God who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of what exists, not in a God who concerns himself with fates and actions of human beings.” These words were spoken by Albert Einstein, upon being asked if he believed in God by Rabbi Herbert Goldstein of the Institutional Synagogue, New York, April 24, 1921, published in the New York Times, April 25, 1929; from ''Einstein: The Life and Times'' Ronald W. Clark, New York: World Publishing Co., 1971, p. 413; also cited as a telegram to a Jewish newspaper, 1929, Einstein Archive 33–272, from Alice Calaprice, ed., ''The Expanded Quotable Einstein'', Princeton, NJ: Princeton University&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern interpretations==
German philosopher [[Karl Jaspers]] believed that Spinoza, in his philosophical system, did not mean to say that God and Nature are interchangeable terms, but rather that God's transcendence was attested by his infinitely many attributes, and that two attributes known by humans, namely Thought and Extension, signified God's ''immanence''.&lt;ref name="ts64"&gt;Karl Jaspers, Spinoza (Great Philosophers), Harvest Books (October 23, 1974), {{ISBN|0-15-684730-2}}, Pages: 14 and 95&lt;/ref&gt; Even God under the attributes of thought and extension cannot be identified strictly with our world. That world is of course "divisible"; it has parts. But Spinoza insists that "no attribute of a substance can be truly conceived from which it follows that the substance can be divided" (Which means that one cannot conceive an attribute in a way that leads to division of substance), and that "a substance which is absolutely infinite is indivisible" (''Ethics'', Part I, Propositions 12 and 13).&lt;ref name="ts65"&gt;Genevieve Lloyd, Routledge Philosophy GuideBook to Spinoza and The Ethics (Routledge Philosophy Guidebooks), Routledge; 1 edition (October 2, 1996), {{ISBN|0-415-10782-2}}, Page: 40&lt;/ref&gt; Following this logic, our world should be considered as a mode under two attributes of thought and extension. Therefore, the pantheist formula "One and All" would apply to Spinoza only if the "One" preserves its transcendence and the "All" were not interpreted as the totality of finite things.&lt;ref name=ts64/&gt;

French philosopher [[Martial Guéroult]] suggested the term "[[panentheism]]", rather than "pantheism" to describe Spinoza's view of the relation between God and the world. The world is not God, but it is, in a strong sense, "in" God. Not only do finite things have God as their cause; they cannot be conceived without God.&lt;ref name=ts65/&gt; In other words, the world is a [[subset]] of God. American philosopher [[Charles Hartshorne]], on the other hand, suggested the term "[[Classical Pantheism]]" to describe Spinoza's philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Hartshorne and William Reese, "Philosophers Speak of God," Humanity Books, 1953, ch 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison to Eastern philosophies==
Similarities between Spinoza's philosophy and Eastern philosophical traditions have been discussed by many authorities. The 19th-century German Sanskritist [[Theodore Goldstücker]] was one of the early figures to notice the similarities between Spinoza's religious conceptions and the [[Vedanta]] tradition of India, writing that Spinoza's thought was "...&amp;nbsp;a western system of philosophy which occupies a foremost rank amongst the philosophies of all nations and ages, and which is so exact a representation of the ideas of the Vedanta, that we might have suspected its founder to have borrowed the fundamental principles of his system from the Hindus, did his biography not satisfy us that he was wholly unacquainted with their doctrines... We mean the philosophy of Spinoza, a man whose very life is a picture of that moral purity and intellectual indifference to the transitory charms of this world, which is the constant longing of the true Vedanta philosopher... comparing the fundamental ideas of both we should have no difficulty in proving that, had Spinoza been a Hindu, his system would in all probability mark a last phase of the Vedanta philosophy."&lt;ref&gt;Literary Remains of the Late Professor Theodore Goldstucker, W. H. Allen, 1879. p32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Westminster Review, Volumes 78–79, Baldwin, Cradock, and Joy, 1862. p1862&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been said that Spinozism is similar to the [[Hindu]] doctrines of [[Samkhya]] and [[Yoga]]. Though within the various existing Indian traditions there exist many traditions which astonishingly had such similar doctrines from ages, out of which most similar and well known are the [[Kashmiri Shaivism]] and [[Nath]] tradition, apart from already existing Samkhya and Yoga.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=eKF4AvtQnXEC&amp;pg=PA133 Disguised and overt Spinozism around 1700&amp;nbsp;– Page 133]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Max Muller]], in his lectures, noted the striking similarities between Vedanta and the system of Spinoza, saying "the Brahman, as conceived in the Upanishads and defined by Sankara, is clearly the same as Spinoza's 'Substantia'."&lt;ref&gt;Three Lectures on the Vedanta Philosophy. F. Max Muller. Kessinger Publishing, 2003. p123&lt;/ref&gt; [[Helena Blavatsky]], a founder of the [[Theosophical Society]] also compared Spinoza's religious thought to Vedanta, writing in an unfinished essay "As to Spinoza's Deity&amp;nbsp;– natura naturans&amp;nbsp;– conceived in his attributes simply and alone; and the same Deity&amp;nbsp;– as natura naturata or as conceived in the endless series of modifications or correlations, the direct outflowing results from the properties of these attributes, it is the Vedantic Deity pure and simple."&lt;ref&gt;''H.P Blavatsky's Collected Writings'', Volume 13, pages 308–310. Quest Books&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Symbolic equation''' is the term used in [[Melanie Klein|Kleinian]] psychoanalysis for states of thinking which equate current objects with those of the past, rather than finding a ''resemblance'' between the two sets.

==Origins==
[[Hanna Segal]] developed the concept of the symbolic equation in the 1950s, during her examination of concrete thinking in the schizophrenic.&lt;ref&gt;J-M Quinodoz, ''Listening to Hanna Segal'' (2007) p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; Its roots however have been traced back as far as Freud's ''[[Studies on Hysteria]]'' of 1895, where he noted how a phrase like a 'stab in the heart' could be concretised in terms of the original physical sensations behind it, so that "we find a symbolic version in concrete images and sensations of more artificial turns of speech".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in J-M Quinodoz, ''Listening to Hanna Segal'' (2007) p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
Symbolic equations have been connected to the [[Splitting (psychology)|splitting]] of the [[Paranoid-schizoid and depressive positions|paranoid-schizoid position]];&lt;ref&gt;J Segal, ''Melanie Klein'' (London 2001) p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; alternatively they can be seen as the result of a failure to make distinctions between self and others, or between real and [[Idealization|idealised]] objects.&lt;ref&gt;R Anderson ed., ''Clinical Lectures on Klein and Bion'' (London 1992) p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
*[[Psychological trauma]] can lead to a collapse of the boundaries between inner and outer worlds, so that anything reminiscent of the trauma becomes by symbolic equation the trauma itself.&lt;ref&gt;F Busch ed., ''Mentalization'' (2011) p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;
*Anxiety in nursing is correlated with the varying ability to relate symbolically to patients: where the latter are seen as symbolising the nurse's own damaged inner objects, care can be provided with manageable anxiety, but where patients are symbolically ''equated'' with parts of the self, anxiety spikes, leading either to despair or to [[Grandiosity|grandiose]] attempts at healing.&lt;ref&gt;M Rustin, ''Social Defences Against Anxiety'' (2014) p. 127-8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternate usages==
*In classical psychoanalysis, symbolic equation is used merely to specify the object to which a symbol relates, as when [[Otto Fenichel]] write of "the symbolic equation money = feces".&lt;ref&gt;O Fenicjel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (London 1946) p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;
*For [[Jacques Lacan]]'s linguistically based [[Symbolic order]], a symbolic equation would mark the presence of (unarticulated) meaning, prior to its entrance into a linguistic code.&lt;ref&gt;M Charles, ''Working with Trauma'' (2011) p. 7-8&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11573">'''Symbolic speech''' is a legal term in [[United States law]] used to describe actions that purposefully and discernibly convey a particular message or statement to those viewing it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/results.pl?co=dictionary.lp.findlaw.com&amp;topic=bf/bf7657c95bca28020ec9503b1c50a000 "symbolic speech"]. ''Law Dictionary'', [[FindLaw]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Symbolic speech is recognized as being [[Protected speech|protected]] under the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] as a form of speech, but this is not expressly written as such in the document. One possible explanation as to why the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Framers]] did not address this issue in the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] is because the primary forms for both political debate and protest in their time were verbal expression and published word, and they may have been unaware of the possibility of future people using non-verbal expression.&lt;ref name="Epstein 1998 pp. 258-280"&gt;Epstein, Lee and Walker, Thomas G. (1998) "Constitutional Law for a Changing America: rights, liberties, and justice" 3rd ed. pp. 258-280 Washington D.C.: Congressional Quarterly Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Symbolic speech is distinguished from [[pure speech]], which is the communication of ideas through spoken or written words or through conduct limited in form to that necessary to convey the idea.

Although the First Amendment only limited the Congress, symbolic speech has also restricted state governments starting with ''[[Gitlow v. New York]]'' (1925).

== O'Brien test ==
While writing the majority opinion for ''[[United States v. O'Brien]]'', [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[Earl Warren|Warren]] described a series of guidelines used to determine whether a law that restricts speech violates the First Amendment. These guidelines must remain neutral in relation to the subject of the speech at hand (i.e., a speech that criticizes government action and is believed to violate a law must be treated the same way as a speech under identical circumstance, but praises the government as opposed to criticizing.) The ''O'Brien'' test is not meant to be the absolute deciding factor in cases involving non-verbal speech, but an additional tool to invoke against prohibitions. &lt;br /&gt; The ''O'Brien'' test is thus: The law in question must
* be within the Constitutional power of the government to enact.
* further an important or substantial government interest.
** That interest must be unrelated to the suppression of speech (or "content neutral", as phrased in later cases)
** Prohibit no more speech than is essential to further that interest.

==Major cases==
===''Tinker v. Des Moines''===
{{main|Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District}}
In December 1965, a group of five students, including lead plaintiff John Tinker and his sister Mary Beth Tinker, wore black [[armband]]s overlaid with a white [[peace sign]] between the dates of December 16 and New Years Day. The principals of the students' schools had previously threatened to suspend any students who participated in the protest. Despite the warning, the small group of students proceeded to carry out their dissent, and were duly suspended. [[American Civil Liberties Union|ACLU]] attorneys representing the students argued that the armbands constituted a form of symbolic speech and, because their demonstration was suppressed, their First Amendment rights were unconstitutionally restrained. The court voted 7–2 in favor of Tinker, finding that the suspension had violated the First Amendment.{{Clarify|date=September 2009}} &lt;ref name="Epstein 1998 pp. 258-280"/&gt;  [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Justice]] [[Abe Fortas|Fortas]], delivering the opinion of the court, held the following:
*"In wearing armbands, the petitioners were quiet and passive. They were not disruptive, and did not impinge upon the rights of others. In these circumstances, their conduct was within the protection of the [[Freedom of speech in the United States|Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment]] and the [[Due Process|Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth]]."
*"First Amendment rights are available to teachers and students, subject to application in light of the special characteristics of the school environment."
*"A prohibition against expression of opinion, without any evidence that the rule is necessary to avoid substantial interference with school discipline or the rights of others, is not permissible under the First and Fourteenth Amendments."&lt;ref&gt;Syllabus for ''Tinker v. Des Moines''&lt;/ref&gt;

===''United States v. O'Brien''===
{{main|United States v. O'Brien}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"On the morning of March 31, 1966, David Paul O'Brien and three companions burned their [[Selective Service System|Selective Service registration certificates]] on the steps of the South Boston Courthouse. A sizable crowd, including several agents of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], witnessed the event. Immediately after the burning, members of the crowd began attacking O'Brien and his companions. An FBI agent ushered O'Brien to safety inside the courthouse. After he was advised of his right to counsel and to silence, O'Brien stated to FBI agents that he had [[Draft-card burning|burned his registration certificate]] because of his beliefs, knowing that he was violating federal law. He produced the charred remains of the certificate, which, with his consent, were photographed.

For this act, O'Brien was indicted, tried, convicted, and sentenced in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. He did not contest the fact that he had burned the certificate. He stated in argument to the jury that he burned the certificate publicly to influence others to adopt his anti-war beliefs, as he put it, "so that other people would reevaluate their positions with Selective Service, with the armed forces, and reevaluate their place in the culture of today, to hopefully consider my position."&lt;ref&gt;The facts of O'Brien's protest, arrest, and trial are summarized in the Supreme Court's opinion, ''United States v. O'Brien'', 391 U.S. 367, 369-70 (1968).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The court ruled 7–1 against O'Brien. In the opinion of the court, Chief Justice Warren wrote that while the First Amendment does protect freedom of speech, it does not protect all things that may extraneously be labeled 'symbolic speech'. As such, O'Brien's protest was not protected because the United States had a [[Strict scrutiny|compelling interest]] in preventing the destruction or mutilation of draft cards. To help himself and future justices determine what may be protected under the free speech clause, he developed a series of requirements that laws must meet in order to stay out of conflict with the First, and thus be considered constitutional, known now as the ''O'Brien'' test.&lt;ref name="Epstein 1998 pp. 258-280"/&gt;

===''Texas v. Johnson''===
{{main|Texas v. Johnson}}
In 1984, during a protest against the policies of the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan administration]] in Dallas, Texas, Gregory Lee Johnson doused an [[Flag of the United States|American flag]] that was given to him by a fellow demonstrator with kerosene and [[Flag Burning|set it alight]] while those around him chanted "America the red, white and blue, we spit on you." He was later arrested and convicted on a flag desecration law in Texas, and sentenced to one year in prison and a $2,000 fine. 
The court ruled 5 to 4 in favor of Johnson. Justice [[William J. Brennan, Jr.|Brennan]] wrote that because such other actions in relation to the flag (such as saluting, and displaying) are considered to be a form of expression, so must too the burning be, and that Johnson's protest was "'Sufficiently imbued with elements of communication' to implicate the First Amendment." He also explained that the relevance of the ''O'Brien'' test is limited "in which 'the governmental interest is unrelated to the suppression of free expression'", as the Texas law in question had its interest in preventing any violent reaction that may spring from those witnessing the burning of the flag. This case helped solidify the condition that any law that inhibits freedom of speech must have an important and compelling interest to do so.&lt;ref name="amazon.com"&gt;Epstein, Lee and Walker, Thomas G.

[https://www.amazon.com/dp/1933116803]&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Cohen v. California''===
{{main|Cohen v. California}}
In 1968, Paul Cohen entered a Los Angeles Courthouse wearing a jacket that displayed the words "Fuck the Draft" knowing that the jacket displayed these words. Though he had removed the jacket and placed it under his arm before entering the courthouse, a [[police]] officer witnessed the jacket and slogan in the corridor and arrested him for "willingly and unlawfully and [[Malice (legal term)|maliciously]] disturbing the [[peace]] and quiet by engaging in tumultuous and offensive conduct." &lt;ref name="amazon.com"/&gt;

The Court voted 5–4 in favor of Cohen. Justice [[John Marshall Harlan II|Harlan]] wrote "[A]bsent a more particularized and compelling reason for its actions, the State may not, consistently with the First and Fourteenth Amendments, make the simple public display of this single four-letter [[Expletive attributive|expletive]] a criminal offense." In the court's opinion, Harlan also penned the now famous line "one man's [[vulgarity]] is another's [[Lyric poetry|lyric]]".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Cohen v. California]]'', 403 U.S. 15 (1971)&lt;/ref&gt;

(2000). Increasing tootling: The effects of a peer-monitored group contingency program on students' reports of peers' prosocial behaviors. Psychology in the Schools, 37(3), 263-270.&lt;/ref&gt; Tootling is like tattling but refers to the reporting of only positive, rather than inappropriate, social behaviors.&lt;ref name="Skinner 2002"&gt;Skinner, C.H., Neddenriep, C.E., Robinson, S.L., Ervin, R., &amp; Jones, K. (2002). Altering educational environments through positive peer reporting: Prevention and remediation of social problems associated with behavior disorders. Psychology in the Schools, 39(2), 191-202.&lt;/ref&gt;  The idea behind this concept is if young children can learn to tattle on inappropriate behavior, then they are capable of monitoring and reporting [[prosocial behavior]].&lt;ref name="Skinner 2002" /&gt;  The objective of tootling is to get students to engage in more prosocial behaviors and to be aware and appreciative of these behaviors in others.&lt;ref name="Skinner 2002" /&gt; Tootling is also helpful for teachers to foster awareness of positive behaviors and increase praise while downplaying a focus on negative behaviors and punishment.&lt;ref name="Skinner 2002" /&gt;  The word "tootling" is a combination of "tattling" (monitoring and reporting classmates antisocial behavior&lt;ref name="Cashwell, T.

Best Practices for the Inclusive Classroom. Waco, Tx: Prufrock Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Tootling Process'''''&lt;ref name="Skinner 2002" /&gt;

# The tootling process begins with a group training session to teach students how to appropriately report positive peer behaviors. Students are not allowed to report on their own behaviors.  They are given clear examples of tootling and then asked to give their own examples. At this point, the teacher or trainer offers feedback and/or [[reinforcement]]. Students are then given index cards that will be taped to their desks and used to record tootles.  A correct "tootle" states a) the name of the "helper" b) the name of the "helpee" c) a description of the observed prosocial behavior.  A group feedback chart is created, to count the cumulative number of tootles, and a group reward or reinforcer (typically an activity) is chosen.
#
# At the beginning of each school day, the students are given an index card that is then taped to the desk.  Students quietly record any observations of peers helping peers seen throughout the day.  If a student fills an entire card, he/she can turn it in for a new card.  At the end of the day, students hand in their cards. The teacher then counts the tootles, only counting helping behaviors, and fills in the feedback chart.  If the same instance is recorded multiple times, they all count.  The next day, the teacher announces the number of tootles recorded and may read some examples aloud and offer praise.  Once the set number of tootles is reached, the class earns the group reward.
#
# After the goal is met, this process can be repeated.  Some alterations may be to make the tootle criteria more difficult or stringent or to choose a new group reward.  It is encouraged to get suggestions from students for group rewards and to choose them randomly to ensure reinforcement for as many students as possible.

In [[mathematics]], a '''tuple''' is a finite ordered list (sequence) of [[Element (mathematics)|elements]].  An '''{{math|''n''}}-tuple''' is a [[sequence]] (or ordered list) of {{math|''n''}} elements, where {{math|''n''}} is a non-negative [[integer]]. There is only one 0-tuple, an empty sequence, or empty tuple, as it is referred to. An {{math|''n''}}-tuple is [[Recursive definition|defined inductively]] using the construction of an [[ordered pair]].

Mathematicians usually write tuples by listing the elements within parentheses "&lt;math&gt;(\text{ })&lt;/math&gt;" and separated by commas; for example, &lt;math&gt;(2, 7, 4, 1, 7)&lt;/math&gt; denotes a 5-tuple. Sometimes other symbols are used to surround the elements, such as square brackets "[ ]" or angle brackets "&lt; &gt;". Braces "{ }" are only used in defining arrays in some programming languages such as [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and Visual Basic, but not in mathematical expressions, as they are the standard notation for [[set (mathematics)|sets]]. The term ''tuple'' can often occur when discussing other mathematical objects, such as [[Vector (mathematics and physics)|vectors]].

In [[computer science]], tuples come in many forms. In [[Dynamic programming language|dynamically typed languages]], such as [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]], lists are commonly used as tuples.{{citation needed|date =May 2017}} Most typed [[functional programming|functional programming languages]] implement tuples directly as [[product type]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wiki.haskell.org/Algebraic_data_type|title=Algebraic data type - HaskellWiki|author=|date=|website=wiki.haskell.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; tightly associated with [[algebraic data type]]s, [[pattern matching]], and [[Assignment_(computer_science)#Parallel_assignment|destructuring assignment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment|title=Destructuring assignment|author=|date=|website=MDN Web Docs}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many programming languages offer an alternative to tuples, known as [[Record (computer science)|record types]], featuring unordered elements accessed by label.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5525795/does-javascript-guarantee-object-property-order|title=Does JavaScript Guarantee Object Property Order?|author=|date=|website=Stack Overflow}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few programming languages combine ordered tuple product types and unordered record types into a single construct, as in [[Struct (C programming language)|C structs]] and Haskell records. [[Relational database]]s may formally identify their [[row (database)|row]]s (records) as ''tuples''.

Tuples also occur in [[relational algebra]]; when programming the [[semantic web]]  with the [[Resource Description Framework]] (RDF); in [[linguistics]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199202720.001.0001/acref-9780199202720-e-2276|title= N‐tuple - Oxford Reference|work= oxfordreference.com|accessdate= 1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The term originated as an abstraction of the sequence: single, double, triple, quadruple, quintuple, sextuple, septuple, octuple, ..., {{math|''n''}}‑tuple, ..., where the prefixes are taken from the [[Latin]] names of the numerals. The unique 0‑tuple is called the null tuple. A 1‑tuple is called a singleton, a 2‑tuple is called an ordered pair and a 3‑tuple is a triple or triplet. {{math|''n''}} can be any nonnegative [[integer]]. For example, a [[complex number]] can be represented as a 2‑tuple, a [[quaternion]] can be represented as a 4‑tuple, an [[octonion]] can be represented as an 8‑tuple and a [[sedenion]] can be represented as a 16‑tuple.

Although these uses treat ''‑tuple'' as the suffix, the original suffix was ''‑ple'' as in "triple" (three-fold) or "decuple" (ten‑fold). This originates from  [[medieval Latin]]  ''plus'' (meaning "more") related to [[Greek language|Greek]] ‑πλοῦς, which replaced the classical and late antique  ''‑plex'' (meaning "folded"), as in "duplex".&lt;ref&gt;''OED'', ''s.v.'' "triple", "quadruple", "quintuple", "decuple"&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Compare the etymology of [[ploidy]], from the Greek for -fold.}}

==Properties==
The general rule for the identity of two {{math|''n''}}-tuples is
: &lt;math&gt;(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n) = (b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n)&lt;/math&gt; [[if and only if]] &lt;math&gt;a_1=b_1,\text{ }a_2=b_2,\text{ }\ldots,\text{ }a_n=b_n.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus a tuple has properties that distinguish it from a [[Set (mathematics)|set]].
# A tuple may contain multiple instances of the same element, so &lt;br/&gt;tuple &lt;math&gt;(1,2,2,3) \neq (1,2,3)&lt;/math&gt;; but set &lt;math&gt;\{1,2,2,3\} = \{1,2,3\}&lt;/math&gt;.
# Tuple elements are ordered: tuple &lt;math&gt;(1,2,3) \neq (3,2,1)&lt;/math&gt;, but set &lt;math&gt;\{1,2,3\} = \{3,2,1\}&lt;/math&gt;.
# A tuple has a finite number of elements, while a set or a [[multiset]] may have an infinite number of elements.

==Definitions==

There are several definitions of tuples that give them the properties described in the previous section.

===Tuples as functions===
If we are dealing with sets, an {{math|''n''}}-tuple can be regarded as a [[Function (mathematics)#Definition|function]], {{math|''F''}},  whose domain is the tuple's implicit set of element indices, {{math|''X''}}, and whose codomain, {{math|''Y''}}, is the tuple's set of elements. Formally:
: &lt;math&gt;(a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n) \equiv (X,Y,F)&lt;/math&gt;
where:
: &lt;math&gt;
    \begin{align}
      X &amp; = \{1, 2, \dots, n\}                       \\
      Y &amp; = \{a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\}                \\
      F &amp; = \{(1, a_1), (2, a_2), \ldots, (n, a_n)\}. \\
    \end{align}
  &lt;/math&gt;
In slightly less formal notation this says:
:&lt;math&gt; (a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n) := (F(1), F(2), \dots, F(n)).&lt;/math&gt;

===Tuples as nested ordered pairs===
Another way of modeling tuples in Set Theory is as nested [[ordered pair]]s. This approach assumes that the notion of ordered pair has already been defined; thus a 2-tuple 
# The 0-tuple (i.e. the empty tuple) is represented by the empty set &lt;math&gt;\emptyset&lt;/math&gt;.
# An {{math|''n''}}-tuple, with {{math|''n'' &gt; 0}}, can be defined as an ordered pair of its first entry and an {{math|(''n'' − 1)}}-tuple (which contains the remaining entries when {{math|''n'' &gt; 1)}}:
#: &lt;math&gt;(a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots, a_n) = (a_1, (a_2, a_3, \ldots, a_n))&lt;/math&gt;
This definition can be applied recursively to the {{math|(''n'' − 1)}}-tuple:
: &lt;math&gt;(a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots, a_n) = (a_1, (a_2, (a_3, (\ldots, (a_n, \emptyset)\ldots))))&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, for example:
: &lt;math&gt;
    \begin{align}
         (1, 2, 3) &amp; = (1, (2, (3, \emptyset)))      \\
      (1, 2, 3, 4) &amp; = (1, (2, (3, (4, \emptyset)))) \\
    \end{align}
  &lt;/math&gt;

A variant of this definition starts "peeling off" elements from the other end:
# The 0-tuple is the empty set &lt;math&gt;\emptyset&lt;/math&gt;.
# For {{math|''n'' &gt; 0}}:
#: &lt;math&gt;(a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots, a_n) = ((a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots, a_{n-1}), a_n)&lt;/math&gt;
This definition can be applied recursively:
: &lt;math&gt;(a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots, a_n) = ((\ldots(((\emptyset, a_1), a_2), a_3), \ldots), a_n)&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, for example:
: &lt;math&gt;
    \begin{align}
         (1, 2, 3) &amp; = (((\emptyset, 1), 2), 3)      \\
      (1, 2, 3, 4) &amp; = ((((\emptyset, 1), 2), 3), 4) \\
    \end{align}
  &lt;/math&gt;

===Tuples as nested sets===
Using [[ordered pair#Kuratowski definition|Kuratowski's representation for an ordered pair]], the second definition above can be reformulated in terms of pure [[set theory]]:
# The 0-tuple (i.e. the empty tuple) is represented by the empty set &lt;math&gt;\emptyset&lt;/math&gt;;
# Let &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; be an {{math|''n''}}-tuple &lt;math&gt;(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n)&lt;/math&gt;, and let &lt;math&gt;x \rightarrow b \equiv (a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n, b)&lt;/math&gt;. Then, &lt;math&gt;x \rightarrow b \equiv \{\{x\}, \{x, b\}\}&lt;/math&gt;.  (The right arrow, &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;, could be read as "adjoined with".)

In this formulation:
: &lt;math&gt;
   \begin{array}{lclcl}
     ()      &amp; &amp;                     &amp;=&amp; \emptyset                                    \\
             &amp; &amp;                     &amp; &amp;                                              \\
     (1)     &amp;=&amp; ()    \rightarrow 1 &amp;=&amp; \{\{()\},\{(),1\}\}                          \\
             &amp; &amp;                     &amp;=&amp; \{\{\emptyset\},\{\emptyset,1\}\}            \\
             &amp; &amp;                     &amp; &amp;                                              \\
     (1,2)   &amp;=&amp; (1)   \rightarrow 2 &amp;=&amp; \{\{(1)\},\{(1),2\}\}                        \\
             &amp; &amp;                     &amp;=&amp; \{\{\{\{\emptyset\},\{\emptyset,1\}\}\},     \\
             &amp; &amp;                     &amp; &amp; \{\{\{\emptyset\},\{\emptyset,1\}\},2\}\}    \\
             &amp; &amp;                     &amp; &amp;                                              \\
     (1,2,3) &amp;=&amp; (1,2) \rightarrow 3 &amp;=&amp; \{\{(1,2)\},\{(1,2),3\}\}                    \\
             &amp; &amp;                     &amp;=&amp; \{\{\{\{\{\{\emptyset\},\{\emptyset,1\}\}\}, \\
             &amp; &amp;                     &amp; &amp; \{\{\{\emptyset\},\{\emptyset,1\}\},2\}\}\}, \\
             &amp; &amp;                     &amp; &amp; \{\{\{\{\{\emptyset\},\{\emptyset,1\}\}\},   \\
             &amp; &amp;                     &amp; &amp; \{\{\{\emptyset\},\{\emptyset,1\}\},2\}\},3\}\}                                       \\
    \end{array}
  &lt;/math&gt;

=={{anchor|n-tuple}}{{math|''n''}}-tuples of {{math|''m''}}-sets ==

In [[discrete mathematics]], especially [[combinatorics]] and finite [[probability theory]], {{math|''n''}}-tuples arise in the context of various counting problems and are treated more informally as ordered lists of length {{math|''n''}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|D'Angelo|West|2000|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{math|''n''}}-tuples whose entries come from a set of {{math|''m''}} elements are also called ''arrangements with repetition'', ''[[Permutation#Permutations_of_multisets|permutations of a multiset]]'' and, in some non-English literature, ''variations with repetition''. The number of {{math|''n''}}-tuples of an {{math|''m''}}-set is {{math|''m''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. This follows from the combinatorial [[rule of product]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|D'Angelo|West|2000|p=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; If {{math|''S''}} is a finite set of [[cardinality]] {{math|''m''}}, this number is the cardinality of the {{math|''n''}}-fold [[Cartesian product#Cartesian power|Cartesian power]] {{math|''S'' × ''S'' × ... ''S''}}. Tuples are elements of this product set.

== Type theory ==
{{main|Product type}}
In [[type theory]], commonly used in [[programming language]]s, a tuple has a [[product type]]; this fixes not only the length, but also the underlying types of each component. Formally:
: &lt;math&gt;(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n) : \mathsf{T}_1 \times \mathsf{T}_2 \times \ldots \times \mathsf{T}_n&lt;/math&gt;
and the [[Projection (mathematics)|projection]]s are term constructors:
: &lt;math&gt;\pi_1(x) : \mathsf{T}_1,~\pi_2(x) : \mathsf{T}_2,~\ldots,~\pi_n(x) : \mathsf{T}_n&lt;/math&gt;

The tuple with labeled elements used in the [[#Relational_model|relational model]] has a [[Record (computer science)|record type]]. Both of these types can be defined as simple extensions of the [[simply typed lambda calculus]].&lt;ref name="pierce2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pierce|first=Benjamin|title=Types and Programming Languages|publisher=MIT Press|year=2002|isbn=0-262-16209-1|pages=126–132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion of a tuple in type theory and that in set theory are related in the following way: If we consider the natural [[model theory|model]] of a type theory, and use the Scott brackets to indicate the semantic interpretation&lt;!-- do not link; that article needs to be a dab first--&gt;, then the model consists of some sets &lt;math&gt;S_1, S_2, \ldots, S_n&lt;/math&gt; (note: the use of italics here that distinguishes sets from types) such that:
: &lt;math&gt;[\![\mathsf{T}_1]\!] = S_1,~[\![\mathsf{T}_2]\!] = S_2,~\ldots,~[\![\mathsf{T}_n]\!] = S_n&lt;/math&gt;
and the interpretation of the basic terms is:
: &lt;math&gt;[\![x_1]\!] \in [\![\mathsf{T}_1]\!],~[\![x_2]\!] \in [\![\mathsf{T}_2]\!],~\ldots,~[\![x_n]\!] \in [\![\mathsf{T}_n]\!]&lt;/math&gt;.

The {{math|''n''}}-tuple of type theory has the natural interpretation as an {{math|''n''}}-tuple of set theory:&lt;ref&gt;Steve Awodey, [http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/awodey/preprints/stcsFinal.pdf ''From sets, to types, to categories, to sets''], 2009, [[preprint]]&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;[\![(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)]\!] = (\,[\![x_1]\!], [\![x_2]\!], \ldots, [\![x_n]\!]\,)&lt;/math&gt;
The [[unit type]] has as semantic interpretation the 0-tuple.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7348">'''''Upeksha''''' in [[Sanskrit]] or '''''[[Upekkha]]''''' in [[Pali]] means [[equanimity]], non-attachment, even-mindedness or letting go. ''Upeksha'' does not mean indifference. It is the fourth element of true love and has as its seed the wisdom of equality that removes all boundaries, discrimination and prejudices while leading to the sublime unity where there is no self and no other; without ''Upeksha'', love becomes possessive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Teachings on Love|author=Thich Nhat Hanh|publisher=Readhowyouwant.com|page=12|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5K6o6IitGogC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=Upeksha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wyELUaKpNIXZrQeS14GQBQ&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Upeksha&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Equanimity or ''Upeksha'' grows out of mindfulness, then one becomes master of every situation no matter what the situation is without it one cannot take anything in one’s stride; its significance is that one really lives unconditionally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Zen Therapy|author=David Brazier|publisher=Constable and Robinson Ltd.|page=90|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SQ6cR_3IyWMC&amp;pg=PT90&amp;dq=Upeksha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wyELUaKpNIXZrQeS14GQBQ&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The understanding that our happiness and that of others is inseparable moves us directly into the fourth ''[[Brahmavihara]]'', ''Upeksha''. Equanimity of ''Upeksha'' carries the ability to take a large view and to look over the whole situation not bound by one side or the other, its near-enemy is in-difference which is difficult to recognise because it masquerades on the surface as even-mindedness; indifference causes retreat to a form of denial like repression, don’t care-can’t be bothered attitude. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Teaching, Learning and Loving|author=Daniel Patrick Liston|publisher=Routledge|page=175|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i_dJ6xrnGaQC&amp;pg=PA175&amp;dq=Upeksha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IyoLUbbULIfqkAWy3YDQCQ&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Upeksha&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Yoga]], ''maîtri'', ''karuna'', ''mudita'' and ''upeksha'' are only different aspects of universal sympathy, which remove all perversities in our nature and unite us with our fellow-men. This is the positive aspect of the mind with reference to abstinence from injuring (''[[ahimsa]]'') which will cleanse the mind and make it fit for ''[[Śraddhā]]'' etc., prepare it to become steady with a view to attaining true discriminative knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Yoga as Philosophy and Religion|author=Surendra Nath Dasgupta|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|page=137|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=osW7uQU2E-IC&amp;pg=PA137&amp;dq=Upeksha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wyELUaKpNIXZrQeS14GQBQ&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Upeksha&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a ''karmasthana'' that holds a very high place in ''[[sadhana]]''. Like equality in [[Bhagavad Gita]], ''upeksha'' of the [[Buddhists]] operates on many levels, and ten kinds of upeksha are enumerated; it is the equality called the six-limbed upeksha which renounces all the creaturely reactions of the six senses when anything agreeable or disagreeable presents itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Meditations:Yoga, Gods, Religions|author=Ram Swarup|publisher=Voice of India|page=19,60|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pqzWAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Upeksha&amp;dq=Upeksha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IyoLUbbULIfqkAWy3YDQCQ&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAjgK}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Samadhi]] may also involve the cultivation of the four states called [[Brahmavihara]]s which four states are - "goodwill" (''maîtri''), "compassion" (''karuna''), "sympathetic joy" (''mudita'') and "equanimity" (''upeksha''). Practised to perfection these states take one to pure the mind-states on the plane of formlessness that are proximate to the apex of existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of  Asian Philosophy|author=Oliver Leaman|publisher=Taylor and Francis|page=536|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=snU6hyIVMawC&amp;pg=PA536&amp;dq=Upeksha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IyoLUbbULIfqkAWy3YDQCQ&amp;ved=0CFAQ6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Upeksha&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Upeksha'' as a power includes freedom from all kinds of desires and birth because it has no preference for one thing more than the other. It is opposed to individuality. This power manifests as ten kinds which are  – ''Sadangopeksha'' (when there is neither pleasure nor displeasure), ''Brahma-wiharopeksha'' (when the mind is equally affected towards all beings), ''Bowdyangopeksha'' (when the mind is equally affected towards all thoughts), ''Wiryopeksha'' (when the mind is equally affected by the same force of determination), ''Sankharopeksha'' (when the mind is equally affected towards all kinds of wisdom), ''Wedanopeksha'' (when the mind is sensible to neither pleasure nor pain), ''Widarsanopeksha'' (when the mind is not affected by what is seen), ''Tatramadyastopeksha'' (when all modes of upeksha are applied together), ''Dhyanopeksha'' (when the impermanency of sensible-objects is regarded with an even mind)and ''Parisudi-upeksha'' (when the mind is equally affected towards all that is necessary to secure freedom from the cleaving to existence). All upekshas may be possessed by one and the same person but the second cannot be possessed without the first.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Manual of Buddhism, in its Modern Development|author=Robert Spence Hardy|page=505|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w3cOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA505&amp;dq=Upeksha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MzILUeiLMI_KrAfH94GQCg&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwADgU#v=onepage&amp;q=Upeksha&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Theosophists, ''maitri'', ''karuna'', ''mudita'' and ''upeksha'' are the four qualities of a ''[[Jivanmukta]]'' who favours ''Sishya'' ("disciple") who attains ''[[Moksha|mukti]]'', ''Bhakta'' ("devotee") who gains his noble ends, ''Udasina'' ("indifferent person") who begins to cherish love for virtuous deeds and ''Pathaka'' (a "sinner") whose sins are purged, and whose ''lakshanas'' are ''akkrodha'' ("absence of hatred"), ''arogya'' ("sound health"), ''jitendriyathawam'' ("conquest of passions"), ''daya'' (kindness), ''kshama'' (forbearance), ''janapriyathawa'' (popularity), ''alobha'' ("absence of avarice"), ''dathruthawa'' (generosity), ''abhaya'' (courage) and ''nairmalaya'' (cleanliness).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Theosophist October 1886 to April 1187|page=119|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WcqKzRYREm8C&amp;pg=PA119&amp;dq=Upeksha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=WmALUeGJHI2GrAf0l4C4Aw&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAjgU#v=onepage&amp;q=Upeksha&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Virilization''' or '''masculinization'''&lt;!-- NOTE: The term "masculinization" redirects here. Because of this, and WP:Alternative title, the term should be bolded and mentioned in the lead. --&gt; is the biological development of [[sex differences]], changes that make a [[male]] body different from a [[female]] body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/virilization|title=Virilization definition and meaning {{!}} Collins English Dictionary|website=www.collinsdictionary.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the changes of virilization are produced by [[androgen]]s. Virilization is most commonly used in three medical and [[biology of gender]] contexts: prenatal [[sexual differentiation]], the postnatal changes of normal male [[puberty]], and excessive androgen effects in females.

==Prenatal virilization==
In the prenatal period, virilization refers to closure of the [[perineum]], thinning and wrinkling (rugation) of the [[scrotum]], growth of the [[phallus]], and closure of the [[urethral groove]] to the tip of the [[penis]]. In this context, ''masculinization'' is synonymous with ''virilization.''

Prenatal virilization of genetic females and undervirilization of genetic males are common causes of [[ambiguous genitalia]] and [[intersex]] conditions.

===High===
Prenatal virilization of a genetically female fetus can occur when an excessive amount of androgen is produced by the fetal [[adrenal gland]]s or is present in maternal blood. In the severest form of [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]], complete masculinization of a genetically female fetus results in an apparently normal male anatomy with no palpable [[testes]]. More often, the virilization is partial and the genitalia are ambiguous.

It can also be associated with [[progestin-induced virilisation]].

===Low===
''Undervirilization'' can occur if a genetic male cannot produce enough androgen or the body tissues cannot respond to it. Extreme undervirilization occurs when no significant androgen hormones can be produced or the body is completely insensitive to androgens. Both result in a female body. Partial undervirilization produces ambiguous genitalia part-way between male and female. The mildest degree of undervirilization may be a slightly small penis. Examples of undervirilization are [[androgen insensitivity syndrome]], [[5 alpha reductase deficiency]], and some forms of [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]].

==Normal virilization==
{{See also|Puberty#Changes in males}}
In common as well as medical usage, virilization often refers to the process of normal male [[puberty]]. These effects include growth of the penis and testes, accelerated growth, [[Pubarche|development of pubic hair]], and other androgenic hair of face, torso, and limbs, [[Voice change|deepening of the voice]], increased musculature, thickening of the jaw, prominence of the neck cartilage, and broadening of the shoulders.

==Abnormal childhood virilization==
Virilization can occur in childhood in both males and females due to excessive amounts of androgens. Typical effects of virilization in children are [[pubic hair]], accelerated growth and bone maturation, increased [[muscle strength]], [[Acne vulgaris|acne]], and adult body odor. In males, virilization may signal [[precocious puberty]], while [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]] and androgen producing tumors (usually) of the [[gonad]]s or adrenals are occasional causes in both sexes.

==In adolescent or adult females==
Virilization in females can manifest as [[clitoris|clitoral]] enlargement, increased muscle strength, acne, [[hirsutism]], frontal hair thinning, deepening of the voice, and [[menstrual period|menstrual]] disruption due to [[anovulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Women's Gynecologic Health|first1=Kerri Durnell |last1=Schuiling|first2= Frances E.|last2= Likis|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers|year= 2005|isbn=0-7637-4717-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some of the possible causes of virilization in females are:

* [[Androgen]]-producing tumors of the
** [[ovary|ovaries]]
** [[adrenal gland]]s (see [[adrenal tumor]])
** [[pituitary gland]] (see [[pituitary adenoma]])
* [[Hyperthecosis]]
* [[Hypothyroidism]]
* [[Anabolic steroid]] exposure
* [[Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency]] (late-onset)
* [[Conn's syndrome]]

== Medically induced virilization in transgender people ==
{{See also|Hormone replacement therapy (female-to-male)}}Transgender people who were [[Sex assignment|medically assigned female at birth]] sometimes elect to take [[Hormone replacement therapy (female-to-male)|hormone replacement therapy]]. This process causes virilization by inducing many of the effects of a typically male puberty. Many of these effects are permanent, but some effects can be reversed if the transgender individual stops or pauses their medical treatment.

=== Permanent virilization effects ===
* Deepening of the voice
* Growth of facial and body hair
* Male-pattern [[baldness]]
* Enlargement of the [[clitoris]]
* [[Breast atrophy]] – possible shrinking and/or softening of breasts

=== Reversible virilization effects ===
* Further muscle development (especially upper body)
* Increased sweat and changes in body odor
* Prominence of veins and coarser skin
* Alterations in blood lipids ([[cholesterol]] and [[triglycerides]])
* Increased red blood cell count

==Demasculinization==
Demasculinization refers to the reversal of virilization. Some but not all aspects of virilization are reversible. Demasculinization occurs naturally with [[andropause]], pathologically with [[hypogonadism]], and artificially or medically with [[antiandrogen]]s, [[estrogen (medication)|estrogen]]s, and [[orchiectomy]].

The '''will to power''' ({{lang-de|der Wille zur Macht}}) is a prominent concept in the [[philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche]]. The will to power describes what [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]] may have believed to be the main driving force in humans – achievement, ambition, and the striving to reach the highest possible position in life. These are all manifestations of the will to power; however, the concept was never systematically defined in Nietzsche's work, leaving its interpretation open to debate.&lt;ref&gt;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nietzsche-moral-political/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alfred Adler]] incorporated the will to power into his [[individual psychology]]. This can be contrasted to the other [[Vienna|Viennese]] schools of [[psychotherapy]]: [[Sigmund Freud]]'s [[Pleasure principle (psychology)|pleasure principle]] (will to pleasure) and [[Viktor Frankl]]'s [[logotherapy]] (will to meaning). Each of these schools advocates and teaches a very different essential driving force in human beings.

== ''Kraft'' vs. ''Macht'' ==

Some of the misconceptions of the will to power, including [[Influence and reception of Friedrich Nietzsche#Nietzsche and fascism|Nazi appropriation of Nietzsche's philosophy]], arise from overlooking Nietzsche's distinction between ''Kraft'' (force) and ''Macht'' (power).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Golomb |first1=Jacob |date=2002 |title=Nietzsche, Godfather of Fascism? On the Uses and Abuses of a Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kraft'' is primordial strength that may be exercised by anything possessing it, while ''Macht'' is, within Nietzsche's philosophy, closely tied to sublimation and "self-overcoming", the conscious channeling of ''Kraft'' for creative purposes.

== Early influences ==

Nietzsche's early thinking was influenced by that of [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], whom he first discovered in 1865. Schopenhauer puts a central emphasis on will and in particular has a concept of the "[[will to live]]". Writing a generation before Nietzsche, he explained that the [[universe]] and [[everything]] in it is driven by a primordial will to live, which results in a desire in all living creatures to avoid death and to procreate. For Schopenhauer, this will is the most fundamental aspect of reality – more fundamental even than being.

Another important influence was [[Roger Joseph Boscovich]], whom Nietzsche discovered and learned about through his reading, in 1866, of [[Friedrich Albert Lange|Friedrich Albert Lange's]] 1865 ''[[Geschichte des Materialismus]]'' (''History of Materialism''). As early as 1872, Nietzsche went on to study Boscovich’s book ''Theoria Philosophia Naturalis'' for himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Whitlock |first=Greg |title=Roger Boscovich, Benedict de Spinoza and Friedrich Nietzsche: The Untold Story |journal=Nietzsche Studien |volume=25 |year=1996 |issue=1 |pages=200–220 |doi=10.1515/9783110244441.200 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nietzsche makes his only reference in his published works to Boscovich in ''[[Beyond Good and Evil]]'', where he declares war on "soul-atomism".&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, ''Beyond Good and Evil'', trans. Walter Kaufmann (1886; New York: Vintage Books, 1966), §12.&lt;/ref&gt;  Boscovich had rejected the idea of "materialistic atomism", which Nietzsche calls "one of the best refuted theories there is".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Anderson |first=R. Lanier |year=1994 |month= |title=Nietzsche’s Will to Power as a Doctrine of the Unity of Science |journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science |volume=25 |issue=5 |pages=738 &lt;!--|accessdate= 2008-10-13 --&gt;|postscript= "Boscovich's theory of centers of force was prominent in Germany at the time. Boscovich’s theory 'is echoed in [[Immanuel Kant|Immanuel Kant’s]] ''Metaphysical Foundations of Natural Science'', which reduces matter to force altogether. Kant’s view, in turn, became very influential in German physics through the work of [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] and his followers. By the time Nietzsche wrote, treating matter in terms of fields of force was the dominant understanding of the fundamental notions of physics.{{'"}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of centers of force would become central to Nietzsche's later theories of "will to power".

== Appearance of the concept in Nietzsche's work ==

As the 1880s began, Nietzsche began to speak of the "Desire for Power" (''Machtgelüst''); this appeared in ''[[Human, All Too Human|The Wanderer and his Shadow]]'' (1880) and ''[[The Dawn (book)|Daybreak]]'' (1881). ''Machtgelüst'', in these works, is the pleasure of the feeling of [[power (social and political)|power]] and the hunger to overpower.

[[Wilhelm Roux]] published his ''The Struggle of Parts in the Organism'' (''Der Kampf der Teile im Organismus'') in 1881, and Nietzsche first read it that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Gregory |last=Moore |title=Nietzsche, Biology, Metaphor |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2002 |isbn=0521812305 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was a response to Darwinian theory, proposing an alternative mode of evolution. Roux was a disciple of and influenced by [[Ernst Haeckel]]&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Müller-Lauter, "The Organism as Inner Struggle: Wilhelm Roux’s Influence on Nietzsche", in ''Nietzsche: His Philosophy of Contradictions and the Contradictions of His Philosophy'', trans. David J. Parent (Chicago: University of Illinois Press, 1999), 161–82.&lt;/ref&gt; who believed the struggle for existence occurred at the [[cell (biology)|cellular]] level. The various cells and tissues struggle for finite resources, so that only the strongest survive. Through this mechanism, the body grows stronger and better adapted. Lacking modern [[gene]]tic theory, Roux's model  assumed a [[Lamarckism|Lamarckian]] or [[pangenesis|pangenetic]] model of inheritance.

Nietzsche began to expand on the concept of ''Machtgelüst'' in ''[[The Gay Science]]'' (1882), where in a section titled "On the doctrine of the feeling of power",&lt;ref&gt;Section 13&lt;/ref&gt; he connects the desire for cruelty with the pleasure in the feeling of power. Elsewhere in ''The Gay Science'' he notes that it is only "in intellectual beings that pleasure, displeasure, and will are to be found",&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, ''The Gay Science'', trans. Walter Kaufman (1887; New York: Vintage Books, 1974), §127.&lt;/ref&gt; excluding the vast majority of organisms from the desire for power.

[[Léon Dumont]] (1837–77), whose 1875 book ''Théorie Scientifique de La Sensibilité, le Plaisir et la Peine'' Nietzsche read in 1883,&lt;ref&gt;Robin Small, ''Nietzsche in Context'' (Burlington, VT: Ashgate, 2001), 166.&lt;/ref&gt; seems to have exerted some influence on this concept. Dumont believed that pleasure is related to increases in force.&lt;ref&gt;Small, ''Nietzsche in Context'', 167.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Wanderer'' and ''Daybreak'', Nietzsche had speculated that pleasures such as cruelty are pleasurable because of exercise of power. But Dumont provided a physiological basis for Nietzsche’s speculation. Dumont’s theory also would have seemed to confirm Nietzsche’s claim that pleasure and pain are reserved for intellectual beings, since, according to Dumont, pain and pleasure require a coming to consciousness and not just a sensing.

In 1883 Nietzsche coined the phrase "Wille zur Macht" in ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]''. The concept, at this point, was no longer limited to only those intellectual beings that can actually experience the feeling of power; it now applied to all life. The phrase ''Wille zur Macht'' first appears in part 1, "1001 Goals" (1883), then in part 2, in two sections, "Self-Overcoming" and "Redemption" (later in 1883). "Self-Overcoming" describes it in most detail, saying it is an "unexhausted procreative will of life". There is will to power where there is life and even the strongest living things will risk their lives for more power. This suggests that the will to power is stronger than the will to survive.

Schopenhauer's "Will to life" thus became a subsidiary to the will to power, which is the stronger will. Nietzsche thinks his notion of the will to power is far more useful than Schopenhauer's will to live for explaining various events, especially human behavior—for example, Nietzsche uses the will to power to explain both [[ascetic]], life-denying impulses and strong, life-affirming impulses in the European tradition,{{clarify|date=January 2016}} as well as both [[master and slave morality]]. He also finds the will to power to offer much richer explanations than [[utilitarianism]]'s notion that all people really want to be happy, or the [[Plato]]nist's notion that people want to be unified with the Good.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

Nietzsche read [[William Rolph]]’s ''Biologische Probleme'' around mid-1884, and it clearly interested him,&lt;ref&gt;Moore, ''Nietzsche, Biology, Metaphor'', 47.&lt;/ref&gt; for his copy is heavily annotated.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas H. Brobjer, "Nietzsche’s Reading and Private Library, 1885–1889", ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' 58, no. 4 (Oct 1997): 663–93.&lt;/ref&gt; He made many notes concerning Rolph. Rolph was another [[evolution]]ary [[anti-Darwinist]] like Roux, who wished to argue for evolution by a different mechanism than the struggle for existence. Rolph argued that all life seeks primarily to expand itself. Organisms fulfill this need through assimilation, trying to make as much of what is found around them into part of themselves, for example by seeking to increase intake and nutriment. Life forms are naturally insatiable in this way.

Nietzsche's next published work was ''[[Beyond Good and Evil]]'' (1886), where the influence of Rolph seems apparent. Nietzsche writes,
{{quote|Even the body within which individuals treat each other as equals&amp;nbsp;... will have to be an incarnate will to power, it will strive to grow, spread, seize, become predominant&amp;nbsp;– not from any morality or immorality but because it is living and because life simply is will to power.&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, ''Beyond Good and Evil'', §259.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
''Beyond Good and Evil'' has the most references to "will to power" in his published works, appearing in 11 aphorisms.&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, ''Beyond Good and Evil'', §§ 22, 23 36, 44 ("''Macht-Willen''," translated "power-will"), 51, 186, 198, 211, 227, 257 ("''Willenskräfte und Macht-Begierden''", translated "strength of will and lust for power"), 259.&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of Rolph and its connection to "will to power" also continues in book 5 of ''Gay Science'' (1887) where Nietzsche describes "will to power" as the instinct for "expansion of power" fundamental to all life.&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, ''The Gay Science'', §349.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karl Wilhelm von Nägeli|Karl Wilhelm von Nägeli's]] 1884 book ''Mechanisch-physiologische Theorie der Abstammungslehre'', which Nietzsche acquired around 1886 and subsequently read closely,&lt;ref&gt;Brobjer says it is the most heavily annotated book of his 1886 reading, "Nietzsche’s Reading and Private Library", 679.&lt;/ref&gt; also had considerable influence on his theory of will to power. Nietzsche wrote a letter to Franz Overbeck about it, noting that it has "been sheepishly put aside by Darwinists".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{cite journal |first=Anette |last=Horn |title=Nietzsche’s interpretation of his sources on Darwinism: Idioplasma, Micells and military troops |journal=South African Journal of Philosophy |volume=24 |issue=4 |year=2005 |pages=260–272 |doi=10.4314/sajpem.v24i4.31426 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nägeli believed in a "perfection principle", which led to greater complexity. He called the seat of heritability the idioplasma, and argued, with a military metaphor, that a more complex, complicatedly ordered idioplasma would usually defeat a simpler rival.&lt;ref&gt;Horn, "Nietzsche's Interpretation of his Sources", 265–66.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, he is also arguing for internal evolution, similar to Roux, except emphasizing complexity as the main factor instead of strength.

Thus, Dumont’s pleasure in the expansion of power, Roux’s internal struggle, Nägeli’s drive towards complexity, and Rolph’s principle of insatiability and assimilation are fused together into the biological side of Nietzsche’s theory of will to power, which is developed in a number of places in his published writings.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, ''Nietzsche, Biology, Metaphor'', 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Having derived the "will to power" from three anti-Darwin evolutionists, as well as Dumont, it seems appropriate that he should use his "will to power" as an anti-Darwinian explanation of evolution. He expresses a number of times&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Nietzsche, ''Beyond Good &amp; Evil'', §13; ''Gay Science'', §349; ''Genealogy of Morals'', II:12.&lt;/ref&gt; the idea that adaptation and the struggle to survive is a secondary drive in the evolution of animals, behind the desire to expand one’s power – the "will to power".

Nonetheless, in his notebooks he continues to expand the theory of the will to power.&lt;ref&gt;The phrase will to power appears in "147 entries of the Colli and Montinari edition of the Nachlass. ... one-fifth of the occurrences of Wille zur Macht have to do with outlines of various lengths of the projected but ultimately abandoned book".  Linda L. Williams, "Will to Power in Nietzsche's Published Works and the Nachlass", ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' 57, no. 3 (1996): 447–63, 450.&lt;/ref&gt; Influenced by his earlier readings of Boscovich, he began to develop a physics of the will to power. The idea of matter as centers of force is translated into matter as centers of will to power. Nietzsche wanted to slough off the theory of matter, which he viewed as a relic of the metaphysics of substance.&lt;ref&gt;Whitlock, "Boscovich, Spinoza and Nietzsche", 207.&lt;/ref&gt;

These ideas of an all inclusive [[physics]] or [[metaphysics]] built upon the will to power do not appear to arise anywhere in his published works or in any of the final books published posthumously, except in the above-mentioned aphorism from ''Beyond Good &amp; Evil'', where he references Boscovich (section 12). It does recur in his notebooks, but not all scholars treat these ideas as part of his thought.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Williams, "Will to Power in Nietzsche's Published Works and the Nachlass".&lt;/ref&gt;

== Will to power and eternal recurrence ==

Throughout the 1880s, in his notebooks, Nietzsche developed a theory of the [[Eternal return|"eternal recurrence of the same"]] and much speculation on the physical possibility of this idea and the mechanics of its actualization occur in his later notebooks. Here, the will to power as a potential physics is integrated with the postulated eternal recurrence. Taken literally as a theory for how things are, Nietzsche appears to imagine a physical universe of perpetual struggle and force that repeatedly completes its cycle and returns to the beginning.&lt;ref&gt;For discussion, see Whitlock, "Roger Boscovich, Benedict de Spinoza and Friedrich Nietzsche"; Moles, "Nietzsche’s Eternal Recurrence as Riemannian Cosmology"; Christa Davis Acampora, "Between Mechanism and Teleology: Will to Power and Nietzsche’s Gay 'Science{{'"}}, in ''Nietzsche &amp; Science'', 171–188 (Burlington, VT: Ashgate, 2004); Stack, "Nietzsche and Boscovich’s Natural Philosophy"; and Small "The Physics of Eternal Recurrence", in ''Nietzsche in Context'', 135–152.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars believe that Nietzsche used the concept of eternal recurrence metaphorically.  But others, such as Paul Loeb, have argued that "Nietzsche did indeed believe in the truth of cosmological eternal recurrence."&lt;ref&gt;Loeb, Paul, The Death of Nietzsche's Zarathustra, Cambridge University Press, 2010, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; By either interpretation the acceptance of eternal recurrence raises the question of whether it could justify a trans-valuation of one's life, and be a necessary precursor to the overman in her/his perfect acceptance of all that is, for the love of life itself and [[amor fati]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

== Interpretations ==
In contemporary Nietzschean scholarship, some interpreters have emphasized the will to power as a psychological principle because Nietzsche applies it most frequently to human behavior. However, in Nietzsche's unpublished notes (later published by his sister as "The Will to Power"), Nietzsche sometimes seemed to view the will to power as a more (metaphysical) general force underlying ''all'' reality, not just human behavior—thus making it more directly analogous to Schopenhauer's will to live. For example, Nietzsche claims the "''world is the will to power—and nothing besides!''".&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, ''The Will To Power'', §1067&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, in relation to the entire body of Nietzsche's published works, many scholars have insisted that Nietzsche's principle of the will to power is less metaphysical and more pragmatic than Schopenhauer's will to live: while Schopenhauer thought the will to live was what was most real in the universe, Nietzsche can be understood as claiming only that the will to power is a particularly useful principle for his purposes.

Some interpreters also upheld a biological interpretation of the ''Wille zur Macht'', making it equivalent with some kind of [[social Darwinism]]. For example, the concept was appropriated by some [[Nazi]]s such as [[Alfred Bäumler]], who may have drawn influence from it or used it to justify their expansive quest for power.

This reading was criticized by [[Martin Heidegger]] in his 1930s courses on Nietzsche—suggesting that raw physical or political power was not what Nietzsche had in mind.  This is reflected in the following passage from Nietzsche's notebooks:

{{Quote|I have found strength where one does not look for it: in simple, mild, and pleasant people, without the least desire to rule—and, conversely, the desire to rule has often appeared to me a sign of inward weakness: they fear their own slave soul and shroud it in a royal cloak (in the end, they still become the slaves of their followers, their fame, etc.) The powerful natures dominate, it is a necessity, they need not lift one finger. Even if, during their lifetime, they bury themselves in a garden house!&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Nietzsche. ''[[The Will to Power (manuscript)|Nachlass]]'', Fall 1880 6 [206]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Opposed to a biological and voluntary conception of the ''Wille zur Macht'', Heidegger also argued that the will to power must be considered in relation to the ''[[Übermensch]]'' and the ''[[Eternal return|thought of eternal recurrence]]''—although this reading itself has been criticized by [[Mazzino Montinari]] as a "macroscopic Nietzsche".&lt;ref&gt;[[Mazzino Montinari]], ''Friedrich Nietzsche'' (1974), 121.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gilles Deleuze]] also emphasized the connection between the will to power and eternal return.  Both Jacques Derrida and Gilles Deleuze were careful to point out that the primary nature of will to power is unconscious.  This means that the drive to power is always already at work unconsciously, perpetually advancing the will of the one over the other.  This thus creates the state of things in the observable or conscious world still operating through the same tension.  Derrida is careful not to confine the will to power to human behavior, the mind, metaphysics, nor physical reality individually.  It is the underlying life principle inaugurating all aspects of life and behavior, a self-preserving force.  A sense of entropy and the eternal return, which are related, is always indissociable from the will to power.  The eternal return of all memory initiated by the will to power is an entropic force again inherent to all life.

Opposed to this interpretation, the "will to power" can be understood (or misunderstood) to mean a struggle against one's surroundings that culminates in personal growth, self-overcoming, and self-perfection, and assert that the power held over others as a result of this is coincidental. Thus Nietzsche wrote:

{{Quote|My idea is that every specific body strives to become master over all space and to extend its force (its will to power) and to thrust back all that resists its extension. But it continually encounters similar efforts on the part of other bodies and ends by coming to an arrangement ("union") with those of them that are sufficiently related to it: thus they then conspire together for power. And the process goes on.&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, ''The Will to Power'', §636 = {{Cite book|title=Digitale kritische Gesamtausgabe, Nachgelassene Fragmente 1888, 14[186]|url=http://www.nietzschesource.org/#eKGWB/NF-1888,14[186]}} &lt;/ref&gt;}}

It would be possible to claim that rather than an attempt to 'dominate over others', the "will to power" is better understood as the tenuous equilibrium in a system of forces' relations to each other. While a rock, for instance, does not have a conscious (or unconscious) "will", it nevertheless acts as a site of resistance within the "will to power" dynamic. Moreover, rather than 'dominating over others', "will to power" is more accurately positioned in relation to the subject (a mere [[synecdoche]], both fictitious and necessary, for there is "no doer behind the deed," (see ''[[On the Genealogy of Morals]]'')) and is an idea behind the statement that words are "seductions" within the process of [[Self-esteem|self-mastery]] and [[self-overcoming]]. The "will to power" is thus a "cosmic" inner force acting in and through both animate and inanimate objects. Not just instincts but also higher level behaviors (even in humans) were to be reduced to the ''will to power''. This includes both such apparently{{Request quotation|date=June 2011}} harmful acts as physical [[violence]], lying, and domination, on one hand, and such apparently non-harmful acts as gift-giving, [[love]], and praise on the other—though its manifestations can be altered significantly, such as through art and aesthetic experience. In ''[[Beyond Good and Evil]]'', he claims that philosophers' "will to truth" (i.e., their apparent desire to dispassionately seek objective, absolute truth) is actually nothing more than a manifestation of their will to power; this will can be life-affirming or a manifestation of [[nihilism]], but it is the will to power all the same.

Other Nietzschean interpreters dispute the suggestion that Nietzsche's concept of the will to power is merely and only a matter of narrow, harmless, humanistic self-perfection.  They suggest that, for Nietzsche, power means self-perfection ''as well as'' outward, political, elitist, [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] domination. Nietzsche, in fact, explicitly and specifically defined the egalitarian state-idea as the embodiment of the will to power in decline:

{{Quote|To speak of just or unjust in itself is quite senseless; in itself, of course, no injury, assault, exploitation, destruction can be 'unjust,' since life operates essentially, that is in its basic functions, through injury, assault, exploitation, destruction and simply cannot be thought of at all without this character. One must indeed grant something even more unpalatable: that, from the highest biological standpoint, legal conditions can never be other than exceptional conditions, since they constitute a partial restriction of the will of life, which is bent upon power, and are subordinate to its total goal as a single means: namely, as a means of creating greater units of power. A legal order thought of as sovereign and universal, not as a means in the struggle between power complexes but as a means of preventing all struggle in general perhaps after the [[communism|communistic]] cliché of Dühring, that every will must consider every other will its equal—would be a principle hostile to life, an agent of the dissolution and destruction of man, an attempt to assassinate the future of man, a sign of weariness, a secret path to nothingness.&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, ''On the Genealogy of Morals'', II:11&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Individual psychology ===
{{main|Individual psychology}}
[[Alfred Adler]] borrowed heavily from Nietzsche's work to develop his second Viennese school of psychotherapy called individual psychology. Adler (1912) wrote in his important book ''Über den nervösen Charakter (The Neurotic Constitution)'':

{{quote|Nietzsche's "Will to power" and "Will to seem" embrace many of our views, which again resemble in some respects the views of Féré and the older writers, according to whom the sensation of pleasure originates in a feeling of power, that of pain in a feeling of feebleness (Ohnmacht).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Adler, Alfred|authorlink=Alfred Adler|year=1912–1917|title=The Neurotic Constitution|pages=ix|publisher=Moffat, Yard and Company|location=New York|url=https://archive.org/details/neuroticconstitu00adle|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Adler's adaptation of the will to power was and still is in contrast to Sigmund Freud's [[Pleasure principle (psychology)|pleasure principle]] or the "will to pleasure", and to Viktor Frankl's [[logotherapy]] or the "will to meaning".&lt;ref&gt;Seidner, Stanley S. (June 10, 2009) [https://docs.google.com/gview?a=v&amp;q=cache:FrKYAo88ckkJ:www.materdei.ie/media/conferences/a-secular-age-parallel-sessions-timetable.pdf+%22Stan+Seidner%22&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us "A Trojan Horse: Logotherapeutic Transcendence and its Secular Implications for Theology"]. ''Mater Dei Institute''&lt;/ref&gt; Adler's intent was to build a movement that would rival, even supplant, others in psychology by arguing for the holistic integrity of psychological well-being with that of [[social equality]].  His interpretation of Nietzsche's will to power was concerned with the individual patient's overcoming of the [[Superiority complex|superiority-]][[Inferiority complex|inferiority]] dynamic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Ansbacher |first1= Heinz |authorlink1= Heinz Ansbacher |last2= Ansbacher |first2= Rowena R. |title= The Individual Psychology of Alfred Adler |year= 1956 |publisher= Harper Perennial (1964) |pages= 132–133 |isbn= 0-06-131154-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Man's Search for Meaning'', Frankl compared his third Viennese school of psychotherapy with Adler's psychoanalytic interpretation of the will to power:

{{quote|... the striving to find a meaning in one's life is the primary motivational force in man.  That is why I speak of a ''will to meaning'' in contrast to the pleasure principle (or, as we could also term it, the ''will to pleasure'') on which Freudian psychoanalysis is centered, as well as in contrast to the ''will to power'' stressed by Adlerian psychology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Frankl |first= Viktor |authorlink= Viktor Frankl |title= Man's Search for Meaning |year= 1959 |publisher= Beacon Press |location= Boston, Massachusetts |page= 154 |isbn= 0-671-02337-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== In fiction and popular culture ==

The 1999 [[4x]] strategy game [[Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri]] refers to the will to power by naming one of its available technologies by that name. A quote from ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'' is given when the technology is discovered by the player.

The character of 'The Jackal' in the 2008 Ubisoft game Far Cry 2 quotes from Beyond Good and Evil and the Will to Power. 

The 2016 4x strategy game [[Stellaris (video game)|Stellaris]] also includes a technology with this name.

Bob Rosenberg, founder of [[freestyle music]] group [[Will to Power (band)|Will to Power]] chose the name for the group as an homage to German philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s theory of an individual's fundamental "will to power".&lt;ref name="Bronson"&gt;[[Fred Bronson|Bronson, Fred]] (2003). ''The Billboard Book of No. 1 Hits'', 5th Edition (Billboard Publications), page 715.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first title in the ''[[Xenosaga]]'' trilogy is [[Xenosaga Episode I|''Xenosaga Episode I: Der Wille zur Macht'']].

On September 8th, 2017, melodic death metal band Arch Enemy released an album entitled "Will to Power". &lt;ref&gt;http://www.archenemy.net/en/band/discography&lt;/ref&gt;

The book makes an appearance in the 1933 Barbara Stanwyck movie ''[[Baby Face (film)|Baby Face]]''.

In ''[[Smallville]]'' (Season 1, Episode 17), the Lex Luthor character reveals that his father gave him a copy of the book for his tenth birthday.

== Algorithm ==

=== Input ===

Let {{mvar|V}} be a vector space and {{mvar|U}}, {{mvar|W}} two finite-dimensional subspaces of {{mvar|V}} with the following [[spanning set]]s:
:&lt;math&gt;U = \langle u_1, \ldots, u_n\rangle&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;W = \langle w_1, \ldots, w_k\rangle.&lt;/math&gt;
Finally, let &lt;math&gt;B_1, \ldots, B_m&lt;/math&gt; be [[linear independence|linearly independent]] vectors so that &lt;math&gt;u_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;w_i&lt;/math&gt; can be written as
:&lt;math&gt;u_i = \sum_{j=1}^m a_{i,j}B_j&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;w_i = \sum_{j=1}^m b_{i,j}B_j.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Output ===

The algorithm computes the base of the [[Linear subspace#Sum|sum]] &lt;math&gt;U + W&lt;/math&gt; and a base of the [[Linear subspace#Intersection|intersection]] &lt;math&gt;U \cap W&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Algorithm ===

The algorithm creates the following [[block matrix]] of size &lt;math&gt;((n+k) \times (2m))&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}
a_{1,1}&amp;a_{1,2}&amp;\cdots&amp;a_{1,m}&amp;a_{1,1}&amp;a_{1,2}&amp;\cdots&amp;a_{1,m}\\
\vdots&amp;\vdots&amp;&amp;\vdots&amp;\vdots&amp;\vdots&amp;&amp;\vdots\\
a_{n,1}&amp;a_{n,2}&amp;\cdots&amp;a_{n,m}&amp;a_{n,1}&amp;a_{n,2}&amp;\cdots&amp;a_{n,m}\\
b_{1,1}&amp;b_{1,2}&amp;\cdots&amp;b_{1,m}&amp;0&amp;0&amp;\cdots&amp;0\\
\vdots&amp;\vdots&amp;&amp;\vdots&amp;\vdots&amp;\vdots&amp;&amp;\vdots\\
b_{k,1}&amp;b_{k,2}&amp;\cdots&amp;b_{k,m}&amp;0&amp;0&amp;\cdots&amp;0
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Using [[elementary row operations]], this matrix is transformed to the [[row echelon form]]. Then, it has the following shape:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}
c_{1,1}&amp;c_{1,2}&amp;\cdots&amp;c_{1,m}&amp;*&amp;*&amp;\cdots&amp;*\\
\vdots&amp;\vdots&amp;&amp;\vdots&amp;\vdots&amp;\vdots&amp;&amp;\vdots\\
c_{q,1}&amp;c_{q,2}&amp;\cdots&amp;c_{q,m}&amp;*&amp;*&amp;\cdots&amp;*\\
0&amp;0&amp;\cdots&amp;0&amp;d_{1,1}&amp;d_{1,2}&amp;\cdots&amp;d_{1,m}\\
\vdots&amp;\vdots&amp;&amp;\vdots&amp;\vdots&amp;\vdots&amp;&amp;\vdots\\
0&amp;0&amp;\cdots&amp;0&amp;d_{l,1}&amp;d_{l,2}&amp;\cdots&amp;d_{l,m}\\
0&amp;0&amp;\cdots&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;\cdots&amp;0\\
\vdots&amp;\vdots&amp;&amp;\vdots&amp;\vdots&amp;\vdots&amp;&amp;\vdots\\
0&amp;0&amp;\cdots&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;\cdots&amp;0
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
Here, &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; stands for arbitrary numbers, and the vectors 
&lt;math&gt;(c_{p,1}, c_{p,2}, \ldots, c_{p,m})&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;p \in \{1, \ldots, q\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(d_{p,1}, \ldots, d_{p,m})&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;p\in \{1, \ldots, l\}&lt;/math&gt; are nonzero.

Then &lt;math&gt;(y_1, \ldots, y_q)&lt;/math&gt; with
:&lt;math&gt;y_i := \sum_{j=1}^m c_{i,j}B_j&lt;/math&gt; 
is a basis of &lt;math&gt;U+W&lt;/math&gt;
and &lt;math&gt;(z_1, \ldots, z_l)&lt;/math&gt; with
:&lt;math&gt;z_i := \sum_{j=1}^m d_{i,j}B_j&lt;/math&gt; 
is a basis of &lt;math&gt;U \cap W&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Proof of correctness ===

First, we define &lt;math&gt;\pi_1 : V \times V \to V, (a, b) \mapsto a&lt;/math&gt; to be the projection to the first component.

Let
&lt;math&gt;H:=\{(u,u) \mid u\in U\}+\{(w,0) \mid w\in W\} \subseteq V\times V.&lt;/math&gt;
Then &lt;math&gt;\pi_1(H) = U+W&lt;/math&gt; and
&lt;math&gt;H\cap(0\times V)=0\times(U\cap W)&lt;/math&gt;.

Also, &lt;math&gt;H \cap (0 \times V)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[kernel (linear algebra)|kernel]] of &lt;math&gt;{\pi_1|}_H&lt;/math&gt;, the projection [[restriction (mathematics)|restricted]] to {{mvar|H}}.
Therefore, &lt;math&gt;\dim(H) = \dim(U+W)+\dim(U\cap W)&lt;/math&gt;.

The Zassenhaus Algorithm calculates a basis of {{mvar|H}}. In the first {{mvar|m}} columns of this matrix, there is a basis &lt;math&gt;y_i&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;U+W&lt;/math&gt;.

The rows of the form &lt;math&gt;(0, z_i)&lt;/math&gt; (with &lt;math&gt;z_i \neq 0&lt;/math&gt;) are obviously in &lt;math&gt;H \cap (0 \times V)&lt;/math&gt;. Because the matrix is in [[row echelon form]], they are also linearly independent.
All rows which are different from zero (&lt;math&gt;(y_i, *)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(0, z_i)&lt;/math&gt;) are a basis of {{mvar|H}}, so there are &lt;math&gt;\dim(U \cap W)&lt;/math&gt; such &lt;math&gt;z_i&lt;/math&gt;s. Therefore, the &lt;math&gt;z_i&lt;/math&gt;s form a basis of &lt;math&gt;U \cap W&lt;/math&gt;.

== Example ==
Consider the two subspaces &lt;math&gt;U = \left\langle \begin{pmatrix} 1\\ -1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} \right\rangle &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;
W = \left\langle \begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ 0 \\ -3 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 5 \\ -3 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} \right\rangle
&lt;/math&gt; of the vector space &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^4&lt;/math&gt;.

Using the [[standard basis]], we create the following matrix of dimension &lt;math&gt;(2 + 2) \times (2 \cdot 4)&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; -1 &amp;0&amp;1 &amp; &amp; 1 &amp; -1 &amp;0&amp;1 \\
0&amp;0&amp;1&amp;-1&amp; &amp;0&amp;0&amp;1&amp;-1 \\ \\
5&amp;0&amp;-3&amp;3&amp; &amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0 \\
0&amp;5&amp;-3&amp;-2&amp; &amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0 \end{pmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

Using [[elementary row operations]], we transform this matrix into the following matrix:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp;0&amp;0&amp; &amp;*&amp;*&amp;*&amp;* \\
0&amp;1&amp;0&amp;-1&amp; &amp;*&amp;*&amp;*&amp;*\\
0&amp;0&amp;1&amp;-1&amp; &amp;*&amp;*&amp;*&amp;*\\ \\
0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp; &amp;1&amp;-1&amp;0&amp;1 \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt; (some entries have been replaced by "&lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt;" because they are irrelevant to the result).

Therefore,
&lt;math&gt;\left(\begin{pmatrix} 1\\0\\0\\0\end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} 0\\1\\0\\-1\end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} 0\\0\\1\\-1\end{pmatrix}\right)&lt;/math&gt; is a basis of &lt;math&gt;U+W&lt;/math&gt;, and
&lt;math&gt;
\left(\begin{pmatrix} 1\\-1\\0\\1\end{pmatrix}\right)
&lt;/math&gt; is a basis of &lt;math&gt;U \cap W&lt;/math&gt;.
