'''Aerugite''' is a rare complex [[nickel]] [[arsenate]] mineral with a variably reported formula: Ni&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;(AsO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;AsO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. It forms green to deep blue-green [[trigonal]] crystals. It has a [[Mohs hardness]] of 4 and a [[specific gravity]] of 5.85 to 5.95.

It was first described in 1858 in either the [[South Terres]] mine of [[Cornwall]], [[England]] or in [[Erzgebirge]], [[Saxony]], [[Germany]]. The origin is disputed. The most common occurrence is as an incrustation on furnace walls in which [[ore]]s are ''roasted''. Its name comes from the [[Latin]] word ''[[wikt:aerugo#Latin|aerugo]]'' for ''copper rust''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5176">The '''Ames process''' is a process by which pure [[uranium]] metal is obtained. It can be achieved by mixing any of the uranium [[halide]]s (commonly [[uranium tetrafluoride]]) with [[Magnesium|magnesium metal]] powder or [[aluminium]] metal powder.

== History ==

The Ames process was used on August 3, 1942 by a group of chemists led by [[Frank Spedding]] and [[Harley Wilhelm]] at the [[Ames Laboratory]] as part of the [[Manhattan Project]].&lt;ref&gt;Frank H. Spedding, Harley A. Wilhelm, and Wayne H. Keller, [http://www.google.com/patents?id=RlpaAAAAEBAJ&amp;printsec=abstract&amp;zoom=4&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;output=html "Production of uranium", U.S. Patent no. 2,830,894] (filed: 7 Nov. 1947; issued: 15 April 1958).&lt;/ref&gt; It is a type of [[thermite]]-based purification, which was patented in 1895 by German chemist [[Hans Goldschmidt]].&lt;ref&gt;H. Goldschmidt, "Verfahren zur Herstellung von Metallen oder Metalloiden oder Legierungen derselben" (Process for the production of metals or metalloids or alloys of the same), Deutsche Reichs Patent no. 96317 (13 March 1895).&lt;/ref&gt; Development of the Ames process came at a time of increased research into mass uranium-metal production. The desire for increased production was motivated by a fear of [[Nazi Germany]] developing [[nuclear weapons]] before the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]. The process originally involved mixing powdered uranium tetrafluoride and powdered magnesium together. This mixture was placed inside an iron pipe that was welded shut on one side and capped shut on another side. This container, called a "bomb" by Spedding,&lt;ref&gt;In laboratory jargon, pressure vessels, such as steel autoclaves and gas cylinders, are commonly called "bombs".&lt;/ref&gt; was placed into a furnace.  When heated to a temperature of {{convert|1500|C}}, the contents of the container reacted violently, leaving a 35-gram [[ingot]] of pure uranium metal. The process was quickly scaled up; by October 1942 the "Ames Project" was producing metal at a rate of {{convert|100|lb}} per week. The uranium tetrafluoride and magnesium were sealed in a refractory-lined reactor vessel, still referred to as a "bomb". The [[thermite]] reaction was initiated by furnace heating the assembly to {{convert|600|C}}; the large difference in density between [[slag]] and metal allowed complete separation in the liquid state, yielding slag-free metal.&lt;ref&gt;The Metal Thorium, Proceedings of the Conference on Thorium, Oct 11, 1956, American Society for Metals &amp; US Atomic Energy Commission, H. Wilhem, Editor, 1958.&lt;/ref&gt; By July 1943, the production rate exceeded {{convert|130000|lb}} of uranium metal per month.  Approximately 1000 tons of uranium ingots were produced at Ames before the process was transferred to industry.&lt;ref&gt;1972–1973 Ames Laboratory Highlights, Ames Laboratory, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, ERDA 0575.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ames project received the [[Army-Navy "E" Award]] for Excellence in Production on October 12, 1945, signifying 2.5 years of excellence in industrial production of metallic uranium as a vital war material. [[Iowa State University]] is unique among educational institutions to have received this award for outstanding service, an honor normally given to industry.

==Ames process for rare-earth metals==
The metallothermic reduction of anhydrous rare-earth fluorides to [[rare-earth metals]] is also referred to as the Ames process.

The study of rare earths was also advanced during World War II:  Synthetic plutonium was believed to be rare-earth-like, it was assumed that knowledge of rare earths would assist in planning for and the study of transuranic elements; [[ion-exchange]] methods developed for actinide processing were forerunners to processing methods for rare-earth oxides; methods used for [[uranium]] were modified for [[plutonium]], which were subsequently the basis for rare-earth metal preparation.&lt;ref&gt;A. H. Danne, Chapter 8: Metallothermic Preparation of Rare Earth Metals, The Rare Earths, F. H. Spedding &amp; A. H. Daane (ed), John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. 1961.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Architectural Engineering''', also known as '''Building Engineering''' or '''Architecture Engineering''', is the application of [[engineering]] principles and [[technology]] to [[building design]] and [[construction]]. Definitions of an '''architectural engineer''' may refer to:
* An engineer in the [[structural engineering|structural]], [[mechanical engineering|mechanical]], [[electrical engineering|electrical]], construction or other engineering fields of building design and construction.
* A [[Professional engineer|licensed engineering professional]] in parts of the [[United States]].
*Architectural engineers are those who work with other engineers and architects for the designing and construction of buildings.

==Engineering for designer==

===Structural engineering===

{{Main|Structural engineering}}
Structural engineering involves the analysis and design of the built environment (buildings, bridges, equipment supports, towers and walls). Those concentrating on buildings are sometimes informally referred to as "building engineers". Structural engineers require expertise in [[strength of materials]], [[structural analysis]], and in predicting [[structural load]] such as from weight of the building, occupants and contents, and extreme events such as wind, rain, ice, and [[seismic design]] of structures which is referred to as [[earthquake engineering]]. Architectural Engineers sometimes incorporate structural as one aspect of their designs; the structural discipline when practiced as a specialty works closely with architects and other engineering specialists.

===Mechanical, Electrical and Plumbing (MEP)===
{{Main|Mechanical, Electrical and Plumbing}}
[[File:MEP Room Virginia Tech.JPG|thumb|right|200px|MEP room in a building]]

[[Mechanical engineering]] and [[electrical engineering]] engineers are specialists, commonly referred to as ([[Mechanical, Electrical and Plumbing]]) when engaged in the building design fields. Also known as "[[building services engineering]]" in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]] and [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www.cibse.org/Building-Services/What-s-so-special-about-Building-Services-Engineer/Building-Services-Engineers-Bring-Buildings-to-Lif|website =  Chartered Institute of Building Services Engineers|title = Building Services Engineers Bring Buildings to Life}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mechanical engineers often design and oversee the [[heating, ventilation and air conditioning]] (HVAC), [[plumbing]] and [[rain gutter]] systems. Plumbing designers often include design specifications for simple [[active fire protection]] systems, but for more complicated projects, [[fire protection engineering|fire protection engineers]] are often separately retained. Electrical engineers are responsible for the building's [[power distribution]], [[telecommunication]], [[fire alarm]], signalization, [[lightning protection]] and [[control systems]], as well as [[Architectural lighting design|lighting systems]].

==The architectural engineer (PE) in the United States==
{{Main|Architectural engineer (PE)}}
In many jurisdictions of the United States, the architectural engineer is a [[Professional engineer|licensed]] engineering professional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncees.org/Licensure.php |title=Licensure |publisher=NCEES |date= |accessdate=2013-10-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101230715/https://ncees.org/Licensure.php |archivedate=2012-11-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually a graduate of an architectural engineering university program preparing students to perform whole-building design in competition with architect-engineer teams; or for practice in one of structural, mechanical or electrical fields of building design, but with an appreciation of integrated architectural requirements. 

Formal architectural engineering education, following the engineering model of earlier disciplines, developed in the late 19th century, and became widespread in the United States by the mid-20th century.  With the establishment of a specific "architectural engineering" [[NCEES]] [[Professional Engineer]]ing registration examination in the 1990s, and first offering in April 2003, architectural engineering became recognized as a distinct engineering discipline in the United States. 

In most license-regulated jurisdictions, architectural engineers are not entitled to practice architecture unless they are also licensed as architects, and may be restricted from the practice of structural engineering on specific types of higher importance buildings such as hospitals.  Regulations and customary practice vary widely by region or city.

==The architect as architectural engineer{{anchor|Architect}}==
{{See also|Architect#Professional requirements}}
In some countries, the practice of architecture includes planning, designing and overseeing the building's construction, and architecture, as a [[profession]] providing [[architect#Architects in practice|architectural services]], is referred to as "architectural engineering". In Japan, a "first-class architect" plays the dual role of architect and building engineer, although the services of a licensed "structural design first-class architect" are required for buildings over a certain scale.&lt;ref name=JapanInfoCenter&gt;{{cite web|title=Architects / Building Engineers in Japan|url=http://www.jaeic.or.jp/k-pamphlet_e20130507.pdf|publisher=The Japan Architectural Education and Information Center|accessdate=2014-08-16|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some languages, such as [[Korean language|Korean]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]], "architect" is literally translated as "architectural engineer". In some countries, an "architectural engineer" (such as the ''ingegnere edile'' in Italy) is entitled to practice [[architecture]] and is often referred to as an architect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://architectplan.download/ Architecture Plan (in English)]&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=September 2018}} These individuals are often also structural engineers. In other countries, such as Germany, Austria, Iran, and most of the Arab countries, architecture graduates receive an engineering degree (''Dipl.-Ing. – Diplom-Ingenieur'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bak.de/site/498/default.aspx German Chamber of Architects] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070427191023/http://www.bak.de/site/498/default.aspx |date=April 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Spain, an "architect" has a technical university education and legal powers to carry out building structure and facility projects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-1999-21567 "Ley de Ordenación de la Edificación" (Building Management Act)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Brazil, architects and engineers used to share the same accreditation process (Conselho Federal de Engenheiros, Arquitetos e Agrônomos (CONFEA) – Federal Council of Engineering, Architecture and Agronomy). Now the Brazilian architects and urbanists have their own accreditation process (CAU – Architecture and Urbanism Council). Besides traditional architecture design training, Brazilian architecture courses also offer complementary training in engineering disciplines such as structural, electrical, hydraulic and mechanical engineering. After graduation, architects focus in architectural planning, yet they can be responsible to the whole building, when it concerns to small buildings (except in electric wiring, where the architect autonomy is limited to systems up to 30kVA, and it has to be done by an Electrical Engineer), applied to buildings, urban environment, built cultural heritage, landscape planning, interiorscape planning and regional planning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.confea.org.br/cgi/cgilua.exe/sys/start.htm?sid=1196 Resolução 1010/05 – Conselho Federal de Engenharia, Arquitetura e Urbanismo – CONFEA] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515160635/http://www.confea.org.br/cgi/cgilua.exe/sys/start.htm?sid=1196 |date=May 15, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/_ato2007-2010/2010/Lei/L12378.htm LEI nº 12.378, de 2010 – Presidência da República]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Greece licensed architectural engineers are graduates from architecture faculties that belong to the Polytechnic University,&lt;ref&gt;[[Polytechnic (Greece)]]&lt;/ref&gt; obtaining an "Engineering Diploma". They graduate after 5 years of studies and are fully entitled architects once they become members of the Technical Chamber of Greece (TEE – Τεχνικό Επιμελητήριο Ελλάδος).&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.tee.gr/ Technical Chamber of Greece (Τεχνικό Επιμελητήριο Ελλάδος)&lt;!-- Bot generated title (+ human editing) --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://portal.tee.gr/portal/page/portal/INTER_RELATIONS/english/role |title=Role &amp; Objectives |publisher=Technical Chamber of Greece |archivedate=2011-08-14 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110814025131/http://portal.tee.gr/portal/page/portal/INTER_RELATIONS/english/role }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Technical Chamber of Greece has more than 100,000 members encompassing all the engineering disciplines as well as architecture.
A prerequisite for being a member is to be licensed as a qualified engineer or architect and to be a graduate of an engineering and architecture schools of a Greek university, or of an equivalent school from abroad.
The Technical Chamber of Greece is the authorized body to provide work licenses to engineers of all disciplines as well as architects, graduated in Greece or abroad. The license is awarded after examinations. The examinations take place three to four times a year. The Engineering Diploma equals a master's degree in ECTS units (300) according to the Bologna Accords.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bologna Process#Qualifications Framework of the European Higher Education Area]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
{{Further|Engineer's degree}}
The architectural, structural, mechanical and electrical engineering branches each have well established educational requirements that are usually fulfilled by completion of a university program.
[[File:Air handling unit.JPG|thumb|225px|An [[air handling unit]] is used for the heating and cooling of air in a central location (click on image for legend). Bringing together knowledge of [[acoustic engineering]] and [[HVAC]] is one example of the multi-disciplined nature of architectural engineering]]

===Architectural engineering as a single integrated field of study===
{{Main|Building engineering education}}

What differentiates architectural engineering from architecture (architect) as a separate and single, integrated field of study, compared to other engineering disciplines, is its multi-disciplinary engineering approach. Through training in and appreciation of architecture, the field seeks integration of building systems within its overall building design. Architectural engineering includes the design of building systems including [[HVAC|heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC)]], plumbing, [[fire protection]], [[electrical]], [[lighting]], [[architectural acoustics]], and structural systems. In some university programs, students are required to concentrate on one of the systems; in others, they can receive a generalist architectural or building engineering degree.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11816">The core idea of [[Artificial Intelligence]] [[systems integration]] is making individual [[software component]]s, such as [[speech synthesizer]]s, interoperable with other components, such as common sense knowledgebases, in order to create larger, broader and more capable A.I. systems. The main methods that have been proposed for integration are message routing, or communication protocols that the software components use to communicate with each other, often through a middleware [[blackboard system]].

Most artificial intelligence systems involve some sort of integrated technologies, for example the integration of speech synthesis technologies with that of speech recognition. However, in recent years there has been an increasing discussion on the importance of systems integration as a field in its own right. Proponents of this approach are researchers such as [[Marvin Minsky]], [[Aaron Sloman]], [[Deb Roy]], [[Kristinn R. Thórisson]] and [[Michael A. Arbib]]. A reason for the recent attention A.I. integration is attracting is that there have already been created a number of (relatively) simple A.I. systems for specific problem domains (such as [[computer vision]], [[speech synthesis]], etc.), and that integrating what's already available is a more logical approach to broader A.I. than building monolithic systems from scratch.

== Why integration? ==
The focus on systems integration, especially with regard to modular approaches, derive from the fact that most intelligences of significant scales are composed of a multitude of processes and/or utilize multi-modal input and output. For example, a humanoid-type of intelligence would preferably have to be able to talk using speech synthesis, hear using speech recognition, understand using a logical (or some other undefined) mechanism, and so forth. In order to produce artificially intelligent software of broader intelligence, integration of these modalities is necessary.

== Challenges &amp; solutions ==
[[Image:Ai integration.jpg|thumb|An example of how multiple modules written in miscellaneous programming languages can be utilized on multiple computers in A.I. systems integration|300px]]
Collaboration is an integral part of [[software development]] as evidenced by the size of software companies and the size of their software departments. Among the tools to ease software collaboration are various procedures and standards that developers can follow to ensure quality, reliability and that their software is compatible with software created by others (such as [[W3C]] standards for webpage development). However, collaboration in fields of A.I. has been lacking, for the most part not seen outside of the respected schools, departments or research institutes (and sometimes not within them either). This presents practitioners of A.I. systems integration with a substantial problem and often causes A.I. researchers to have to 're-invent the wheel' each time they want a specific functionality to work with their software. Even more damaging is the "not invented here" syndrome, which manifests itself in a strong reluctance of A.I. researchers to build on the work of others.

The outcome of this in A.I. is a large set of "solution islands": A.I. research has produced numerous isolated software components and mechanisms that deal with various parts of intelligence separately. To take some examples:

*Speech synthesis
**FreeTTS from [[Carnegie Mellon University|CMU]]
*Speech recognition
**Sphinx from [[Carnegie Mellon University|CMU]]
*Logical reasoning
**Open[[Cyc]] from [[Cycorp]]
**[[Open Mind Common Sense]] Net from [[MIT]]

With the increased popularity of the [[free software movement]], a lot of the software being created, including A.I. systems, that is available for public exploit. The next natural step is to merge these individual software components into coherent, intelligent systems of a broader nature. As a multitude of components (that often serve the same purpose) have already been created by the community, the most accessible way of integration is giving each of these components an easy way to communicate with each other. By doing so, each component by itself becomes a module which can then be tried in various settings and configurations of larger architectures.

Many online communities for A.I. developers exist where tutorials, examples and forums aim at helping both beginners and experts build intelligent systems (for example the [http://ai-depot.com AI Depot], [http://www.generation5.org Generation 5]). However, few communities have succeeded in making a certain standard or a code of conduct popular to allow the large collection of miscellaneous systems to be integrated with any ease. Recently, however, there have been focused attempts at producing standards for A.I. research collaboration, [http://www.mindmakers.org Mindmakers.org] is an online community specifically created to harbor collaboration in the development of A.I. systems. The community has proposed the OpenAIR message and routing protocol for communication between software components, making it easier for individual developers to make modules instantly integrateble into other peoples' projects.

== Methodologies ==

=== Constructionist Design Methodology ===
The [[Constructionist design methodology]] (CDM, or 'Constructionist A.I.') is a formal methodology proposed in 2004, for use in the development of cognitive robotics, communicative humanoids and broad AI systems. The creation of such systems requires integration of a large number of functionalities that must be carefully coordinated to achieve coherent system behavior. CDM is based on iterative design steps that lead to the creation of a network of named interacting modules, communicating via explicitly typed streams and discrete messages. The OpenAIR message protocol (see below) was inspired by the CDM, and has frequently been used to aid in development of intelligent systems using CDM.

One of the first projects to use CDM was [https://web.archive.org/web/20070705035725/http://www.mindmakers.org/projects/MIRAGE Mirage], an embodied, graphical agent visualized through [[augmented reality]] which could communicate with human users and talk about objects present in the user's physical room. Mirage was created by [[Kristinn R. Thórisson]], the creator of CDM, and a number of students at [[Columbia University]] in 2004. The methodology is actively being developed at [[Reykjavik University]].

== Tools ==

===OpenAIR Protocol===
'''[[OpenAIR]]''' is a message routing and communication protocol that has been gaining in popularity over the past two years. The protocol is managed by [http://www.mindmakers.org Mindmakers.org], and is described on their site in the following manner:

"''OpenAIR is a routing and communication protocol based on a publish-subscribe architecture. It is intended to be the "glue" that allows numerous A.I. researchers to share code more effectively — "AIR to share". It is a definition or a blueprint of the "post office and mail delivery system" for distributed, multi-module systems. OpenAIR provides a core foundation upon which subsequent markup languages and semantics can be based, e.g. gesture recognition and generation, computer vision, hardware-software interfacing etc.; for a recent example see [http://www.mindmakers.org/projects/CVML CVML]''."[http://www.mindmakers.org/openair/airPage.jsp]

OpenAIR was created to allow software components that serve their own purpose to communicate with each other to produce large scale, overall behavior of an intelligent systems. A simple example would be to have a speech recognition system, and a speech synthesizer communicate with an [[expert system]] through OpenAIR messages, to create a system that can hear and answer various questions through spoken dialogue. CORBA (see below) is an older but similar architecture that can be used for comparison, but OpenAIR was specifically created for A.I. research, while CORBA is a more general standard.

The OpenAIR protocol has been used for collaboration on a number of A.I. systems, a list can be found on the [http://www.mindmakers.org Mindmakers project pages]. Psyclone is a popular platform to pair with the OpenAIR protocol (see below).

=== Psyclone AIOS ===
[http://www.cmlabs.com/psyclone/ Psyclone] is a software platform, or an AI operating system (AIOS), developed by [http://www.cmlabs.com Communicative Machines Laboratories] for use in creating large, multi modal A.I. systems. The system is an implementation of a [[blackboard system]] that supports the OpenAIR message protocol. Psyclone is available for free for non-commercial purposes and has therefore often been used by research institutes on low budgets and novice A.I. developers.

=== Elvin ===
Elvin is a content-based router with a central routing station, similar to the Psyclone AIOS (see above).

=== OAA ===
The OOA is a hybrid architecture that relies on a special inter-agent communication language (ICL) – a logic-based declarative language which is good for expressing high-level, complex tasks and natural language expressions.

=== CORBA ===
The [[CORBA|Common Object Request Broker Architecture ('''CORBA''')]] is a standard that enables [[software componentry|software components]] written in multiple [[programming language|computer languages]] and running on multiple computers to interoperate. CORBA is defined by the [[Object Management Group]] (OMG). CORBA follows similar principles as the OpenAIR protocol (see above), and can be used for A.I. systems integration.

=== MOSID ===
&lt;!--  Commented out: [[Image:Oki-logo.png|thumb|Open Knowledge Initiative Logo|120px]] --&gt;
The '''Messaging''' [[Open Service Interface Definition]] ('''OSID''') is an [[O.K.I.]] [[specification]] which provides a means of sending, subscribing and receiving messages. '''OSIDs''' are programmatic interfaces which comprise a [[Service Oriented Architecture]] for designing and building [[software reusability|reusable]] and [[interoperable]] [[software]].

[[File:John Flamsteed (Gemälde).jpg|thumb|190px|John Flamsteed]]
'''Astronomer Royal''' is a senior post in the [[Royal Households of the United Kingdom]]. There are two officers, the senior being the Astronomer Royal dating from 22 June 1675; the second is the [[Astronomer Royal for Scotland]] dating from 1834.

The post was created by [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] in 1675, at the same time as he founded the [[Royal Observatory Greenwich]]. He appointed [[John Flamsteed]], instructing him "{{sic|hide=y|forthwith to apply himself with |the most exact care and diligence to the rectifying the tables of the motions of the heavens, and the places of the fixed stars, so as to find out the so-much desired longitude of places, for the perfecting the art of navigation}}."&lt;ref&gt;F Baily, "An Account of the Rev. John Flamsteed", reprinted in [https://books.google.com/books?id=48L1w21XYI4C&amp;pg=PA293 vol.28,at p.293]. "The Museum of foreign literature, science and art", R Walsh et al., publ.

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Astronomer Royal was director of the Royal Observatory Greenwich from the establishment of the post in 1675 until 1972. The Astronomer Royal became an honorary title in 1972 without executive responsibilities and a separate post of [[Director of the Royal Greenwich Observatory]] was created to manage the institution.&lt;ref name="mccrea_rgo_1975"/&gt;&lt;ref name="meadows1975"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Astronomer Royal today receives a [[stipend]] of 100 [[Pound Sterling|GBP]] per year and is a member of the [[Royal Household]], under the general authority of the [[Lord Chamberlain]]. After the separation of the two offices, the position of Astronomer Royal has been largely honorary, though he remains available to advise the Sovereign on astronomical and related scientific matters, and the office is of great prestige.&lt;ref name="monarchywebsite"&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2015">The '''Australian National Commission for [[UNESCO]]''' was established under Section 7 of the ''United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization Act,'' 1947 (Cwlth) and is the [[Australian government]] organisation responsible for advising on the implementation of [[UNESCO]] policies and programmes in [[Australia]] and for advising on Australia's involvement with [[UNESCO]]. The Commission comprises a Secretariat and a total of eighteen (18) members, and operates under the Charter of the Australian National Commission for UNESCO, a statutory instrument pursuant to Section 7 the above legislation. As [[peace education]] is fundamental to the mission of [[UNESCO]], so too advising on the promotion and advancement of [[peace education]] in [[Australia]] is central to the role of the Australian National Commission for [[UNESCO]].

'''Avanti''' was established by the [[UK]] [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]] in 2002&lt;ref name="berr.gov.uk"&gt;[http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/file37735.pdf DTI The Construction Research Programme, February 2007] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227054835/http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/file37735.pdf |date=February 27, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to formulate an approach to collaborative working in order to enable [[construction]] [[project]] [[business partner|partners]] to work together effectively. The project was promoted by the [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.excitech.co.uk/DPJ/sublibrary.asp?vol=3&amp;iss=6 Design Productivity Journal] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061127013111/http://www.excitech.co.uk/DPJ/sublibrary.asp?vol=3&amp;iss=6 |date=November 27, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with the support of most of the largest UK firms in the construction industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.constructingexcellence.org.uk/ceavanti/companies.jsp |title=Full list of collaborative companies |access-date=2008-02-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081119051402/http://www.constructingexcellence.org.uk/ceavanti/companies.jsp |archive-date=2008-11-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Avanti also involved the [[buildingSMART|International Alliance for Interoperability]] (IAI), [[Loughborough University]] and Co-Construct, a network of five construction research and information organizations.

The Avanti programme aimed to help overcome problems caused by incomplete,
inaccurate and ambiguous information.&lt;ref name="RICS"&gt;[http://www.rics.org/NR/rdonlyres/B8DEFACA-CB65-43E7-8708-3308C2B7EE39/0/Construction_april06.pdf "An historical problem"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227054836/http://www.rics.org/NR/rdonlyres/B8DEFACA-CB65-43E7-8708-3308C2B7EE39/0/Construction_april06.pdf |date=February 27, 2008 }}, Construction Journal, [[Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors]], April 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The [[Tavistock Institute]] report (1965) printed an extract from an [[RICS]] meeting of 1910 which stated "Architectural information is invariably inaccurate, ambiguous and incomplete".&lt;ref name="RICS" /&gt; By the 1940s, the impact of this was valued at an additional 10% to the construction cost. By 1994 the [[Latham Report]] ''Constructing the Team'' suggested waste in the industry accounted for 25-30% of project costs. This figure is supported by earlier publications from the [[Building Research Establishment]] (BRE) and the [[BSRIA|Building Services Research and Information Association]] (BSRIA), which led to reports in 1987 from the Coordinating Committee for Project Information (now [[Construction Project Information Committee|CPIC]]) that recommended a common format and disciplined approach to reduce the problem. These suggestions were proven on DTI-funded projects and case studies at Endeavour House at [[London Stansted Airport]] and the BAA [[Heathrow Express]], which showed that significant savings in project cost and drawing production could be made by addressing people and process issues.

==The problem and approach==
Most construction projects are complex and involve co-ordination between many project participants both on- and off-site. As projects have increased in size and complexity, the number of participants involved in a single project has also increased. To improve collaboration between participants, the industry needs tools that work well, appropriate processes to implement them, and the right approach from the people involved. Tackling these points was at the heart of the Avanti action research programme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.modbs.co.uk/news/fullstory.php/aid/273/Moving_forward_with_collaborative_working.html Modern Building Services (MBS) Journal]&lt;/ref&gt;

Its purpose was to support live construction project teams, as they collaborate to deliver projects, by helping them apply the appropriate technologies. It worked through a team of partners representing each stage of the project process, with the objective of improving project and business performance through the use of [[information and communication technologies]] (ICT) to support collaborative working. It set out to show the advantages of [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] systems over conventional [[drawings]], with information managed as a [[database]] rather than a drawing cabinet, and aimed to demonstrate that [[3D Computer Aided Design]] systems could revolutionise projects, provided they were used for more than  [[Visualization (computer graphics)|visualisation]].

To reduce the risks involved in adopting new working methods, Avanti brought together areas of current best practice (such as [[Construction Project Information Committee|CPIC]] [[Methodology|protocols]]) that had previously gained too little market penetration to have significant impact on the sector. The objective was to deliver improved project and business performance by using ICT to support collaborative working.

Avanti focused on early access to all project information by all partners, on early involvement of the [[supply chain]], and on sharing of information, drawings and schedules, in an agreed and consistent manner. The Avanti approach was supported by handbooks, toolkits and on-site mentoring and was reliant on advice and materials provided by CPIC.

Avanti mobilised existing technologies to improve business performance by increasing the quality of information and predictability of outcomes and by reducing risk and waste. The core of the Avanti approach to a project's whole life cycle was based on team-working and access to a common [[information model]]. All CAD information was generated with the same origin, orientation and scale, and organised in layers that could be shared. All layers and CAD model files were named consistently within a specific Avanti convention to allow others to find the relevant CAD data.

==Guidance and Phases==
Learning from early projects, Avanti produced practical working documentation and tested the methods on live projects. This information supplemented the CPIC document [[Construction Project Information Committee#Code_of_Procedure_for_the_Construction_Industry|Code of Procedure for the Construction Industry]] and addressed problems of incomplete, inaccurate and ambiguous information. Avanti guidance included:
* ''Standard Method and Procedure'' - advice on classification standards, spatial and technical co-ordination, example file and directory structures, and naming conventions.
* ''Design Management Principles'' - comprising typical design management processes, information management processes, guidance on detailed task management and typical responsibilities of delivery team leaders.

The advice also covers areas such as:
* a business case on the commercial imperatives for collaborative ICT 
* guidance on ensuring the software chain supported the design and supply chains 
* authoring information in a common data environment and controlling the sharing of information in a multi-author environment 

For most projects, using this guidance consisted of three phases:

* ''Phase 1'': Change the poor industry practice of producing information to individual standards and throwing it ‘over the wall’ to the next person in the supply chain who then reproduces their own information. Using an agreed standard for the project, spatially co-ordinated and high-quality 2D information will then be produced for the parties involved.
* ''Phase 2'': Implementation of those same principles to generate 3D project models to produce 2D drawings and material measurement.
* ''Phase 3'': Full implementation of 3D object-oriented and [[Building information modeling|Building information modelling]] systems. Each live project captures the lessons learned and the benefits gained.

==Further development==
In July 2006, the Avanti DTI Project documentation and brand ownership was transferred to [[Constructing Excellence]]. Since the handover, Constructing Excellence endeavoured to promote the savings demonstrated on live projects. Further work was also carried out to make Avanti part of the update of [[BS 1192]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bsi-global.com/en/Shop/Publication-Detail/?pid=000000000030163398 British Standards, BS 1192:2007 Collaborative production of architectural, engineering and construction information. Code of practice]&lt;/ref&gt; The BS 5555 committee coded the methods.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bsi-global.com/en/Shop/Publication-Detail/?pid=000000000000294037  BS 5555]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Results==
Evaluation of the impacts of the Avanti project  showed: &lt;ref name="berr.gov.uk"/&gt;
* Early commitment offering up to 80% saving on implementation cost on medium size project.
* 50-85% saving on effort spent receiving information and formatting for reuse.
* 60-80% saving on effort spent finding information and documents.
* 75–80% saving in effort to achieve design co-ordination.
* 50% saving on time spent to assess tenders and award sub-contracts.
* 50% saving on effort in sub-contractor design approval.

==The future==
Constructing Excellence is developing a self-sustaining business to support roll out of the Avanti methodology to the UK construction industry. It will also draw on the results of other DTI-supported collaborative research such as ''Building Down Barriers''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mod.uk/NR/rdonlyres/B935410C-ACA9-4F1E-B4BC-FCF91D202B93/0/supplychainhandbook.pdf Building Down Barriers] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080312071152/http://www.mod.uk/NR/rdonlyres/B935410C-ACA9-4F1E-B4BC-FCF91D202B93/0/supplychainhandbook.pdf |date=March 12, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''bibliographic database''' is a [[database]] of [[bibliographic record]]s, an organized digital collection of references to published literature, including [[academic journal|journal]] and [[newspaper]] articles, conference [[proceedings]], reports, government and legal publications, [[patent]]s, [[book]]s, etc.  In contrast to [[library catalog]]ue entries, a large proportion of the bibliographic records in bibliographic databases describe articles, conference papers, etc., rather than complete [[monograph]]s, and they generally contain very rich subject descriptions in the form of [[Index term|keyword]]s, subject classification terms, or [[abstract (summary)|abstract]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=127 |title=International Encyclopedia of Information and Library Science| edition=Second |editor1-last=Feather |editor1-first=John| editor2-last=Sturges |editor2-first=Paul| publisher=Routledge| location=London| year=2003| ISBN=0-415-25901-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A bibliographic database may be general in scope or cover a specific [[academic discipline]] like [[computer science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kusserow|first1=Arne|last2=Groppe|first2=Sven|title=Getting Indexed by Bibliographic Databases in the Area of Computer Science|journal=Open Journal of Web Technologies|date=2014|volume=1|issue=2|doi=10.19210/OJWT_2014v1i2n02_Kusserow|url=https://www.ronpub.com/publications/ojwt/OJWT_2014v1i2n02_Kusserow.html|accessdate=26 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A significant number of bibliographic databases are proprietary, available by licensing agreement from vendors, or directly from the [[indexing and abstracting service]]s that create them.&lt;ref name="Reitz"&gt;{{cite book| chapter=bibliographic database | page=70 | title=Dictionary for Library and Information Science |last=Reitz |first= Joan M. |publisher= Libraries Unlimited | location= Westport, Connecticut | year= 2004| isbn=1-59158-075-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many bibliographic databases have evolved into [[digital library|digital libraries]], providing the full text of the indexed contents.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} Others converge with non-bibliographic scholarly databases to create more complete disciplinary [[search engine]] systems, such as [[Chemical Abstracts]] or [[Entrez]].

==History==
Prior to the mid-20th century, individuals searching for published literature had to rely on printed [[bibliographic index]]es, generated manually from [[index card]]s.  "During the early 1960s computers were used to digitize text for the first time; the purpose was to reduce the cost and time required to publish two American abstracting journals, the ''[[Index Medicus]]'' of the [[United States National Library of Medicine|National Library of Medicine]] and the ''[[Scientific and Technical Aerospace Reports]]'' of the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA). By the late 1960s such bodies of digitized alphanumeric information, known as bibliographic and numeric databases, constituted a new type of information resource.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=information processing|work=Encyclopædia Britannica Online| url=http://search.eb.com/eb/article-9106312| year=2010| accessdate=April 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Online interactive retrieval became commercially viable in the early 1970s over private telecommunications networks.  The first services offered a few databases of indexes and abstracts of scholarly literature.  These databases contained bibliographic descriptions of journal articles that were searchable by keywords in author and title, and sometimes by journal name or subject heading.  The user interfaces were crude, the access was expensive, and searching was done by librarians on behalf of 'end users'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| pages=89–90 |title=Scholarship in the Digital Age: Information, Infrastructure, and the Internet | last=Borgman |first=Christine L. | publisher=The MIT Press |location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | year= 2007 |isbn=978-0-262-02619-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charles Green''' (24 November 1888 – 26 September 1974), also known as '''Charlie Green''', was a British ship's cook, who took part in [[Ernest Shackleton|Sir Ernest Shackleton's]] [[Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition]] as the cook for the Weddell sea party on board the ''Endurance''. The son of a master baker, Charles learnt to bake, but ran away at the age of 22 to join the Merchant Navy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.enduranceobituaries.co.uk/green.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst in [[Buenos Aires]] on board the ''Andes'' in October 1914, he heard word that Shackleton had fired the expedition's cook, for drunkenness, and was subsequently hired.

During the expedition, Green was assisted by [[able seaman]] [[Perce Blackborow]], who had come on board as a stowaway. When the ship sank after being trapped in the Antarctic ice, he continued to cook for the crew during their camps on the Antarctic ice, with much more limited equipment and the use of a blubber stove. A few days after the crew arrived on [[Elephant Island]], Green collapsed from exhaustion, and was ordered to rest until he recovered.

After the crew were rescued, Green returned to England, where he joined the Royal Navy as a cook, taking part in the [[World War I|war]]. He was wounded in August 1918 whilst serving on the Destroyer H.M.S. Wakeful, and re-joined the Merchant Navy in 1919.

Green was invited to re-join Shackleton on another expedition to Antarctica, the [[Shackleton–Rowett Expedition]], along with many other crew members from ''Endurance''.  During this trip, Shackleton gave Green a set of lantern-slides, before his death shortly after arrival at South Georgia. The expedition continued without Shackleton, but was not a great success.

After returning to England in 1922, Green once again rejoined the Merchant Navy, working on board a variety of ships. Using his lantern slides, he gave many talks about the Endurance mission at ports around the World, and continued to give these lectures after retiring from the Navy in 1931.

He became a Fire Watcher during World War II within the city of Hull.

Green was one of the last surviving members of the ''Endurance'' crew, and attended the 50th Anniversary reunion in 1964 with the two remaining survivors.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.coolantarctica.com/Antarctica%20fact%20file/History/biography/green_charles.php&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[marketing]], the '''decoy effect''' (or '''attraction effect''' or '''asymmetric dominance effect''') is the phenomenon whereby consumers will tend to have a specific change in preference between two options when also presented with a third option that is ''asymmetrically dominated''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huber|first1=Joel|last2=Payne|first2=John W.|last3=Puto|first3=Christopher|title=Adding Asymmetrically Dominated Alternatives: Violations of Regularity and the Similarity Hypothesis|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|volume=9|issue=1|year=1982|pages=90–98|doi=10.1086/208899}}&lt;/ref&gt; An option is asymmetrically dominated when it is inferior in all respects to one option; but, in comparison to the other option, it is inferior in some respects and superior in others. In other words, in terms of specific attributes determining preferences, it is completely dominated by (i.e., inferior to) one option and only partially dominated by the other. When the asymmetrically dominated option is present, a higher percentage of consumers will prefer the dominating option than when the asymmetrically dominated option is absent. The asymmetrically dominated option is therefore a [[decoy]] serving to increase preference for the dominating option. The decoy effect is also an example of the violation of the [[independence of irrelevant alternatives]] [[axiom]] of [[decision theory]].

==Examples==
Suppose there is a [[consideration set]] (options to choose from in a menu) that involves [[MP3 players]]. Consumers will generally see higher storage capacity (number of [[Gigabyte|GB]]) and lower price as positive attributes; while some consumers may want a player that can store more songs, other consumers will want a player that costs less. In Consideration Set 1, two devices are available:

{| class="wikitable"
|+Consideration Set 1
|-
! !! A !! B
|-
! price
| $400 || $300
|-
! storage
| 30GB || 20GB
|}

In this case, some consumers will prefer ''A'' for its greater storage capacity, while others will prefer ''B'' for its lower price.

Now suppose that a new player, ''C'', the "decoy", is added to the market; it is more expensive than both ''A'', the "target", and ''B'', the "competitor", and has more storage than ''B'' but less than ''A'':

{| class="wikitable"
|+Consideration Set 2
|-
! !! A (target) !! B (competitor) !! C (decoy)
|-
! price
| $400 || $300 || $450
|-
! storage
| 30GB || 20GB || 25GB
|}

The addition of decoy ''C'' — which consumers would presumably avoid, given that a lower price can be paid for a model with more storage—causes ''A'', the dominating option, to be chosen more often than if only the two choices in Consideration Set 1 existed; ''C'' affects consumer preferences by acting as a basis of comparison for ''A'' and ''B''. Because ''A'' is better than ''C'' in both respects, while ''B'' is only partially better than ''C'', more consumers will prefer ''A'' now than did before. ''C'' is therefore a decoy whose sole purpose is to increase sales of ''A''.

Conversely, suppose that instead of ''C'', a player ''D'' is introduced that has less storage than both ''A'' and ''B'', and that is more expensive than ''B'' but not as expensive as ''A'':

{| class="wikitable"
|+Consideration Set 3
|-
! !! A (competitor) !! B (target) !! D (decoy)
|-
! price
| $400 || $300 || $350
|-
! storage
| 30GB || 20GB || 15GB
|}

The result here is similar: consumers will not prefer ''D'', because it is not as good as ''B'' in any respect. However, whereas ''C'' increased preference for ''A'', ''D'' has the opposite effect, increasing preference for ''B''.

Another example showed in Dan Ariely's &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Predictably-Irrational-Revised-Expanded-Decisions-ebook/dp/B002C949KE|title=Predictably Irrational, Revised and Expanded Edition: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions|last=results|first=search|date=2009-06-06|publisher=HarperCollins e-books|edition= Revised and Expanded|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Predictably Irrational was a true case used by ''The Economist'' magazine. In a subscription screen is presented 3 options like below:

# '''Economist.com subscription''' - US $59.00. One-year subscription to Economist.com. Includes online access to all articles from ''The Economist'' since 1997
# '''Print subscription''' - US $125.00. One-year subscription to the print edition of ''The Economist''
# '''Print &amp; web subscription''' - US $125.00. One-year subscription to the print edition of ''The Economist'' and online access to all articles from The Economist since 1997

When presented like above,16% of the students in the experiment conducted by Ariely chose the first option, 0% chose the middle option, and 84% chose the third option. Even though nobody picked the second option, when he removed that option the result was the inverse; 68% of the students picked the online only option, and 32% chose the print and web option.

==Measurement==

The decoy effect is usually measured by comparing the frequency of choice of the target, ''A'' in the absence of the decoy, ''C'', compared with when the decoy is present in the consideration set. The decoy effect can also be measured as how much more a consumer is ready to pay to choose the target rather than the competitor.&lt;ref name="CrosettoGaudeul2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crosetto|first1=Paolo|last2=Gaudeul|first2=Alexia|title=A monetary measure of the strength and robustness of the attraction effect|journal=Economics Letters|volume=149|year=2016|pages=38–43|issn=0165-1765|doi=10.1016/j.econlet.2016.09.031}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Studies==

In 2018, researchers from the [[University of Colorado at Denver]] and the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]] published a study of 168 workers in three food factories in China.  For the first 20 days of the study, workers were provided with spray bottles of sanitizer to clean their hands and workstations, which they were meant to do hourly.  Then the researchers offered workers the choice of their usual spray bottle or a less convenient option, specifically a squeeze bottle of sanitizer or a wash basin.  The workers increased their use of the original spray bottles from their baseline 60% to over 90%.
&lt;ref name="APS"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2018-05/afps-ge051718.php|title=Giving employees 'decoy' sanitizer options could improve hand hygiene|publisher=Eurekalert.com|author=Association for Psychological Science|date=May 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MengYanHui"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Decoy Effect as a Nudge: Boosting Hand Hygiene With a Worse Option|journal = Psychological Science|pages = 095679761876137|author1=Meng Li|author2=Yan Sun|author3=Hui Chen|date=May 14, 2018|doi=10.1177/0956797618761374|pmid = 29757701}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debate==

The debate on the existence and relevance of the attraction effect was recently renewed. New research points out that the attraction effect does not appear in realistic purchasing scenarios, for example when options are presented graphically, or when the target and the competitor are not exactly of the same value.&lt;ref name="YangLynn2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yang|first1=Sybil|last2=Lynn|first2=Michael|title=More Evidence Challenging the Robustness and Usefulness of the Attraction Effect|journal=Journal of Marketing Research|volume=51|issue=4|year=2014|pages=508–513|issn=0022-2437|doi=10.1509/jmr.14.0020|citeseerx=10.1.1.686.9374}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FrederickLee2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Frederick|first1=Shane|last2=Lee|first2=Leonard|last3=Baskin|first3=Ernest|title=The Limits of Attraction|journal=Journal of Marketing Research|volume=51|issue=4|year=2014|pages=487–507|issn=0022-2437|doi=10.1509/jmr.12.0061}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CrosettoGaudeul2016"/&gt;

The original authors had to underline again that the attraction effect occurs only if the consumer is close to indifference between the target and the competitor, if both dimensions of the products (in our example, price and storage capacity) are about as important as each other to the consumer, if the decoy is not too undesirable, and if the dominance relation is easy to identify.&lt;ref name="HuberPayne2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huber|first1=Joel|last2=Payne|first2=John W.|last3=Puto|first3=Christopher P.|title=Let's Be Honest About the Attraction Effect|journal=Journal of Marketing Research|volume=51|issue=4|year=2014|pages=520–525|issn=0022-2437|doi=10.1509/jmr.14.0208}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent study has indeed confirmed that the attraction effect persists when options are presented graphically, i.e., as [[scatter plots]].&lt;ref name="Dimara2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dimara|first1=Evanthia|last2=Bezerianos|first2=Anastasia|last3=Dragicevic|first3=Pierre|title=The attraction effect in information visualization|journal=IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics|volume=23|issue=1|year=2017|pages=471–480|issn=1077-2626|doi=10.1109/TVCG.2016.2598594|pmid=27875163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''heuristic technique''' ({{IPAc-en|h|j|ʊəˈr|ɪ|s|t|ɪ|k}}; {{lang-grc|εὑρίσκω}}, "find" or "discover"), often called simply a '''heuristic''', is any approach to problem solving, learning, or discovery that employs a practical method, not guaranteed to be optimal, perfect, logical, or rational, but instead sufficient for reaching an immediate goal. Where finding an optimal solution is impossible or impractical, heuristic methods can be used to speed up the process of finding a satisfactory solution. Heuristics can be mental shortcuts that ease the cognitive load of making a decision. Examples that employ heuristics include using a [[rule of thumb]], an [[ansatz|educated guess]], an [[intuition|intuitive]] judgment, a [[guesstimate]], stereotyping, [[profiling (information science)|profiling]], or [[common sense]].

==Overview==
Heuristics are the strategies derived from previous experiences with similar problems. These strategies rely on using readily accessible, though loosely applicable, information to control [[problem solving]] in human beings, machines, and abstract issues.&lt;ref&gt;[[Judea Pearl|Pearl, Judea]] (1983).  ''Heuristics: Intelligent Search Strategies for Computer Problem Solving''. New York, Addison-Wesley, p. vii.  {{ISBN|978-0-201-05594-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_q6VhhkczIYcC1nWEV2ejZfOGs/view?usp=sharing | title=Heuristic Reasoning: Studies in Applied Philosophy, Epistemology and Rational Ethics | publisher=Springer International Publishing | author=Emiliano, Ippoliti | year=2015 | location=Switzerland | pages=1–2 | isbn=978-3-319-09159-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most fundamental heuristic is [[trial and error]], which can be used in everything from matching nuts and bolts to finding the values of variables in algebra problems.

Here are a few other commonly used heuristics, from [[George Pólya]]'s 1945 book, ''[[How to Solve It]]'':&lt;ref&gt;[[George Pólya|Pólya, George]] (1945) ''How to Solve It: A New Aspect of Mathematical Method'', Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press. {{ISBN|0-691-02356-5}} &amp;nbsp; {{ISBN|0-691-08097-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation|
* If you are having difficulty understanding a problem, try drawing a picture.
* If you can't find a solution, try assuming that you have a solution and seeing what you can derive from that ("working backward").
* If the problem is abstract, try examining a concrete example.
* Try solving a more general problem first (the "[[inventor's paradox]]": the more ambitious plan may have more chances of success).}}

&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[List of psychology topics]] --&gt;
In [[psychology]], heuristics are simple, efficient rules, learned or [[hard-coded]] by evolutionary processes, that have been proposed to explain how people make decisions, come to judgements, and solve problems typically when facing complex problems or incomplete information. Researchers test if people use those rules with various [[methodology of heuristics|methods]]. These rules work well under most circumstances, but in certain cases lead to systematic errors or [[cognitive bias]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gigerenzer|first=Gerd|title=How to Make Cognitive Illusions Disappear: Beyond "Heuristics and Biases"|journal=European Review of Social Psychology|year=1991|volume=2|pages=83–115|url=http://library.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/ft/gg/gg_how_1991.pdf|accessdate=14 October 2012|doi=10.1080/14792779143000033}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|Heuristics in judgment and decision making}}
The study of heuristics in human decision-making was developed in the 1970s and 80s by psychologists [[Amos Tversky]] and [[Daniel Kahneman]],&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Kahneman, Amos Tversky, and Paul Slovic, eds. (1982) ''Judgment under Uncertainty: Heuristics &amp; Biases''. Cambridge, UK, Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0-521-28414-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the concept was originally introduced by Nobel laureate [[Herbert A. Simon]]. Simon's original, primary object of research was problem solving which showed that we operate within what he calls [[bounded rationality]]. He coined the term "[[satisficing]]", which denotes the situation where people seek solutions or accept choices or judgments that are "good enough" for their purposes, but could be optimized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.interaction-design.org/encyclopedia/heuristics_and_heuristic_evaluation.html |title=Heuristics and heuristic evaluation |publisher=Interaction-design.org |accessdate=2013-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rudolf Groner]] analyzed the history of heuristics from its roots in ancient Greece up to contemporary work in cognitive psychology and artificial intelligence,&lt;ref&gt;[[Rudolf Groner]], Marina Groner &amp; Walter F. Bischof (1983). Methods of heuristics. Hillsdale N.J., Lawrence Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; and proposed a cognitive style "heuristic versus algorithmic thinking" which can be assessed by means of a validated questionnaire.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rudolf Groner]] &amp; Marina Groner (1991). ''Heuristische versus algorithmische Orientierung als Dimension des individuellen kognitiven Stils. In K. Grawe, N. Semmer, R. Hänni (Hrsg.), Über die richtige Art, Psychologie zu betreiben ''. Göttingen, Hogrefe.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gerd Gigerenzer]] focused on the "fast and frugal" properties of heuristics, i.e., using heuristics in a way that is principally accurate and thus eliminating most cognitive bias.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gerd Gigerenzer]], Peter M. Todd, and the ABC Research Group (1999). ''Simple Heuristics That Make Us Smart''. Oxford, UK, Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-514381-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heuristics – like the [[recognition heuristic]] or the [[take-the-best heuristic]] – are viewed as special tools that tackle specific tasks (e.g., binary choice) under conditions of uncertainty&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Neth, Hansjörg  |author2=Gigerenzer, Gerd |title=Heuristics: Tools for an uncertain world |url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.726.1656&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|accessdate=10 August 2017|date=May 2015 |work= Emerging Trends in the Social and Behavioral Sciences |pages= 1–18  |doi=10.1002/9781118900772.etrds0394 |publisher=Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are organized in an "adaptive toolbox".&lt;ref&gt;Gigerenzer, Gerd, and Reinhard Selten, eds. (2002) ''Bounded rationality: The adaptive toolbox''. Cambridge, Massachusetts, MIT press. {{ISBN|978-0262571647}}&lt;/ref&gt; From one particular batch of research, Gigerenzer and Wolfgang Gaissmaier found that both individuals and organizations rely on heuristics in an adaptive way. They also found that ignoring part of the information [with a decision], rather than weighing all the options, can actually lead to more accurate decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Gigerenzer, Gerd  |author2=Gaissmaier, Wolfgang |title=Heuristic Decision Making |date=January 2011 |work= Annual Review of Psychology |volume=Vol. 62 |pages= 451–482  |ssrn=1722019 |publisher=Ssrn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1146/annurev-psych-120709-145346 | volume=62 | title=Heuristic Decision Making | journal=Annual Review of Psychology | pages=451–482 | pmid=21126183 | year=2011| author1=Gigerenzer | first1=G | last2=Gaissmaier | first2=W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heuristics, through greater refinement and research, have begun to be applied to other theories, or be explained by them. For example: the [[cognitive-experiential self-theory]] (CEST) also is an adaptive view of heuristic processing. CEST breaks down two systems that process information. At some times, roughly speaking, individuals consider issues rationally, systematically, logically, deliberately, effortfully, and verbally. On other occasions, individuals consider issues intuitively, effortlessly, globally, and emotionally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psych-it.com.au/Psychlopedia/article.asp?id=53 |title=Cognitive experiential self theory - Psychlopedia |doi=10.1177/1745691611429354 |publisher=psych-it.com.au |date=2008-10-18 |accessdate=2013-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this perspective, heuristics are part of a larger experiential processing system that is often adaptive, but vulnerable to error in situations that require logical analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Epstein | first1 = S. | last2 = Pacini | first2 = R. | last3 = Denes-Raj | first3 = V. | last4 = Heier | first4 = H. | year = 1996 | title = Individual differences in intuitive-experiential and analytical-rational thinking styles | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 71 | issue = 2| pages = 390–405 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.71.2.390 | pmid=8765488}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Daniel Kahneman and [[Shane Frederick]] proposed that cognitive heuristics work by a process called ''[[attribute substitution]]'', which happens without conscious awareness.&lt;ref name="revisited"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kahneman|first=Daniel|author2=Shane Frederick|title=Heuristics and Biases: The Psychology of Intuitive Judgment|editor=Thomas Gilovich |editor2=Dale Griffin |editor3=Daniel Kahneman|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|year=2002|pages=49–81|chapter=Representativeness Revisited: Attribute Substitution in Intuitive Judgment|isbn=978-0-521-79679-8|oclc=47364085}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this theory, when somebody makes a judgment (of a "target attribute") that is computationally complex, a rather easier calculated "heuristic attribute" is substituted. In effect, a cognitively difficult problem is dealt with by answering a rather simpler problem, without being aware of this happening.&lt;ref name="revisited" /&gt; This theory explains cases where judgments fail to show [[regression toward the mean]].&lt;ref name="kahneman_aer"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kahneman|first=Daniel|date=December 2003|title =Maps of Bounded Rationality: Psychology for Behavioral Economics|journal=American Economic Review|publisher=American Economic Association |volume=93 |issue=5|pages=1449–1475|doi=10.1257/000282803322655392|issn=0002-8282|url=http://www.econ.tuwien.ac.at/Lotto/papers/Kahneman2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heuristics can be considered to reduce the complexity of clinical judgements in healthcare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Heuristics, servants to intuition, in clinical decision making|first1= Jane |last1=Cioffi| year=1997| journal= [[Journal of Advanced Nursing]]| volume=26 |pages=203–208|doi= 10.1046/j.1365-2648.1997.1997026203.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Theorized psychological heuristics ===

==== Well known ====
* [[Anchoring and adjustment]] – Describes the common human tendency to rely more heavily on the first piece of information offered (the "anchor") when making decisions.  For example, in a study done with children, the children were told to estimate the number of jellybeans in a jar.  Groups of children were given either a high or low "base" number (anchor).  Children estimated the number of jellybeans to be closer to the anchor number that they were given.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Smith, H.|year=1999|title=Use of the anchoring and adjustment heuristic by children|journal=Current Psychology|volume=18|issue=3|pages=294–300|doi=10.1007/s12144-999-1004-4|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226776426_Use_of_the_Anchoring_and_Adjustment_Heuristic_by_Children}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Availability heuristic]] – A mental shortcut that occurs when people make judgments about the probability of events by the ease with which examples come to mind.  For example, in a 1973 Tversky &amp; Kahneman experiment, the majority of participants reported that there were more words in the English language that start with the letter K than for which K was the third letter.  There are actually twice as many words in the English Language that have K as the third letter as those that start with K, but words that start with K are much easier to recall and bring to mind.&lt;ref name="Harvey, N. 2007"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harvey | first1 = N | year = 2007 | title = Use of heuristics: Insights from forecasting research | url = | journal = Thinking &amp; Reasoning | volume = 13 | issue = 1| pages = 5–24 | doi = 10.1080/13546780600872502 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Representativeness heuristic]] – A mental shortcut used when making judgments about the probability of an event under uncertainty.   Or, judging a situation based on how similar the prospects are to the prototypes the person holds in his or her mind. For example, in a 1982 Tversky and Kahneman experiment, participants were given a description of a woman named Linda.  Based on the description, it was likely that Linda was a feminist.  Eighty to ninety percent of participants, choosing from two options, chose that it was more likely for Linda to be a feminist ''and'' a bank teller than only a bank teller.  The likelihood of two events cannot be greater than that of either of the two events individually. For this reason, the representativeness heuristic is exemplary of the [[conjunction fallacy]].&lt;ref name="Harvey, N. 2007"/&gt;
* [[Naïve diversification]] – When asked to make several choices at once, people tend to diversify more than when making the same type of decision sequentially.
* [[Escalation of commitment]] – Describes the phenomenon where people justify increased investment in a decision, based on the cumulative prior investment, despite new evidence suggesting that the cost, starting today, of continuing the decision outweighs the expected benefit. This is related to the [[sunk cost]] fallacy.
* [[Familiarity heuristic]] – A mental shortcut applied to various situations in which individuals assume that the circumstances underlying the past behavior still hold true for the present situation and that the past behavior thus can be correctly applied to the new situation. Especially prevalent when the individual experiences a high [[cognitive load]].

==== Lesser known ====
* [[Affect heuristic]]
* [[Contagion heuristic]]
* [[Effort heuristic]]
* [[Fluency heuristic]]
* [[Gaze heuristic]]
* [[Peak–end rule]]
* [[Recognition heuristic]]
* [[Scarcity heuristic]]
* [[Similarity heuristic]]
* [[Simulation heuristic]]
* [[Social proof]]
* [[Take-the-best heuristic]]

=== Cognitive maps ===
Heuristics were also found to be used in the manipulation and creation of [[cognitive maps]]. Cognitive maps are internal representations of our physical environment, particularly associated with spatial relationships. These internal representations of our environment are used as memory as a guide in our external environment. It was found that when questioned about maps imaging, distancing, etc., people commonly made distortions to images. These distortions took shape in the regularization of images (i.e., images are represented as more like pure abstract geometric images, though they are irregular in shape).

There are several ways that humans form and use cognitive maps. Visual intake is a key part of mapping. The first is by using ''landmarks''. This is where a person uses a mental image to estimate a relationship, usually distance, between two objects. The second is ''route-road'' knowledge, and is generally developed after a person has performed a task and is relaying the information of that task to another person. The third is a ''survey''. A person estimates a distance based on a mental image that, to them, might appear like an actual map. This image is generally created when a person's brain begins making image corrections. These are presented in five ways: 1. ''Right-angle bias'' is when a person straightens out an image, like mapping an intersection, and begins to give everything 90-degree angles, when in reality it may not be that way. 2. ''Symmetry heuristic'' is when people tend to think of shapes, or buildings, as being more symmetrical than they really are. 3. ''Rotation heuristic'' is when a person takes a naturally (realistically) distorted image and straightens it out for their mental image. 4. ''Alignment heuristic'' is similar to the previous, where people align objects mentally to make them straighter than they really are. 5. ''Relative-position heuristic'': people do not accurately distance landmarks in their mental image based on how well they remember that particular item.

Another method of creating cognitive maps is by means of auditory intake based on verbal descriptions. Using the mapping based from a person's visual intake, another person can create a mental image, such as directions to a certain location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sternberg|first=Robert J.|title=Cognitive Psychology|year=2012|publisher=Wadsworth, Cengage Learning|location=Belmont, CA|isbn=978-1-111-34476-4|pages=310–1315|edition=6th|author2=Karin Sternberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy ==
"Heuristic device" is used when an entity X exists to enable understanding of, or knowledge concerning, some other entity Y. A good example is a [[Physical model|model]] that, as [[Map/territory relation|it is never identical with what it models]], is a heuristic device to enable understanding of what it models. Stories, metaphors, etc., can also be termed heuristic in that sense. A classic example is the notion of [[utopia]] as described in [[Plato]]'s best-known work, ''[[Plato's Republic|The Republic]]''. This means that the "ideal city" as depicted in ''The Republic'' is not given as something to be pursued, or to present an orientation-point for development; rather, it shows how things would have to be connected, and how one thing would lead to another (often with highly problematic results), if one would opt for certain principles and carry them through rigorously.

"Heuristic" is also often used as a [[noun]] to describe a [[Rule of thumb|rule-of-thumb]], procedure, or method.&lt;ref&gt;[[Katarzyna Jaszczolt|K. M. Jaszczolt]] (2006). [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/defaults-semantics-pragmatics/ "Defaults in Semantics and Pragmatics"], The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, {{ISSN|1095-5054}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophers of science have emphasized the importance of heuristics in creative thought and constructing scientific theories.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roman Frigg]] and [[Stephan Hartmann]] (2006). [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/models-science/ "Models in Science"], The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, {{ISSN|1095-5054}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]'' by [[Karl Popper]]; and philosophers such as [[Imre Lakatos]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kiss | first1 = Olga | year = 2006 | title = Heuristic, Methodology or Logic of Discovery? Lakatos on Patterns of Thinking | url = http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/posc.2006.14.3.302 | journal = Perspectives on Science | volume = 14 | issue = 3| pages = 302–317 | doi=10.1162/posc.2006.14.3.302}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lindley Darden]], [[William C. Wimsatt]], and others.)

== Law ==
In [[legal theory]], especially in the theory of [[law and economics]], heuristics are used in the [[law]] when [[case method|case-by-case analysis]] would be impractical, insofar as "practicality" is defined by the interests of a governing body.&lt;ref&gt;Gerd Gigerenzer and Christoph Engel, eds. (2007). ''Heuristics and the Law'', Cambridge, The MIT Press, {{ISBN|978-0-262-07275-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The present securities regulation regime largely assumes that all investors act as perfectly rational persons.
In truth, actual investors face cognitive  limitations from biases, heuristics, and framing effects.

For instance, in all states in the [[United States]] the [[legal drinking age]] for unsupervised persons is 21 years, because it is argued that people need to be mature enough to make decisions involving the risks of [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] consumption. However, assuming people mature at different rates, the specific age of 21 would be too late for some and too early for others. In this case, the somewhat arbitrary deadline is used because it is impossible or impractical to tell whether an individual is sufficiently mature for society to trust them with that kind of responsibility.  Some proposed changes, however, have included the completion of an alcohol education course rather than the attainment of 21 years of age as the criterion for legal alcohol possession.  This would put youth alcohol policy more on a case-by-case basis and less on a heuristic one, since the completion of such a course would presumably be voluntary and not uniform across the population.

The same reasoning applies to [[patent law]]. [[Patent]]s are justified on the grounds that inventors must be protected so they have incentive to invent. It is therefore argued that it is in society's best interest that inventors receive a temporary government-granted [[monopoly]] on their idea, so that they can recoup investment costs and make economic profit for a limited period. In the United States, the length of this temporary monopoly is 20 years from the date the application for patent was filed, though the monopoly does not actually begin until the application has matured into a patent. However, like the drinking-age problem above, the specific length of time would need to be different for every product to be efficient. A 20-year term is used because it is difficult to tell what the number should be for any individual patent. More recently, some, including [[University of North Dakota]] law professor Eric E. Johnson, have argued that patents in different kinds of industries – such as [[software patent]]s – should be protected for different lengths of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Johnson | first1 = Eric E. | year = 2006 | title = Calibrating Patent Lifetimes | url = http://www.eejlaw.com/writings/Johnson_Calibrating_Patent_Lifetimes.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Santa Clara Computer &amp; High Technology Law Journal | volume = 22 | issue = | pages = 269–314 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stereotyping ==

Stereotyping is a type of heuristic that all people use to form opinions or make judgments about things they have never seen or experienced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bodenhausen|first1=Galen V.|title="On the Dialectics of Discrimination: Dual Processes in Social Stereotyping", in  Dual-process Theories in Social Psychology  edited by Shelly Chaiken and Yaacov Trope|date=1999|publisher=Guilford Press|location=NY|isbn=1572304219|pages=271–92|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5X_auIBx99EC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=24 March 2015|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; They work as a mental shortcut to assess everything from the social status of a person based on their actions to assumptions that a plant that is tall, has a trunk, and has leaves is a tree even though the person making the evaluation has never seen that particular type of tree before.

Stereotypes, as first described by journalist [[Walter Lippmann]] in his book ''[[Public Opinion (book)|Public Opinion]]'' (1922), are the pictures we have in our heads that are built around experiences as well as what we are told about the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kleg|first1=Milton|title=Hate Prejudice and Racism|date=1883|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany|isbn=0791415368|page=135|url=https://books.google.com/?id=aaMuQHO04I0C&amp;pg=PA135&amp;dq=stereotypes+lippmann+pictures+head#v=onepage&amp;q=stereotypes%20lippmann%20pictures%20head&amp;f=false|accessdate=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gökçen|first1=Sinan|title=Pictures in Our Heads|url=http://www.errc.org/cikk.php?cikk=2868|website=European Roma Rights Centre|accessdate=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Artificial intelligence ==
A [[Heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]] can be used in artificial intelligence systems while searching a solution space. The heuristic is derived by using some function that is put into the system by the designer or by adjusting the weight of branches based on how likely each branch is to lead to a goal node.

== Critiques and controversies ==
The concept of heuristics has critiques and controversies. The "We Cannot Be That Dumb" critique shows that the average person has low ability to make sound and effective judgments.&lt;ref&gt;"Heuristics and Biases" - The Psychology of Intuitive Judgment Edited by THOMAS GILOVICH, Cornell University DALE GRIFFIN, Stanford University DANIEL KAHNEMAN, Princeton University (page 8-9)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7735">'''High-energy X-rays''' or '''HEX-rays''' are very hard [[X-rays]], with typical energies of 80–1000&amp;nbsp;[[keV]] (1&amp;nbsp;MeV), about one order of magnitude higher than conventional X-rays (and well into [[gamma-ray]] energies over 120 keV). They are produced at modern [[synchrotron radiation]] sources such as the beamline ID15 at the [[European Synchrotron Radiation Facility]] (ESRF). The main benefit is the deep penetration into [[matter]] which makes them a probe for thick samples in [[physics]] and [[materials science]] and permits an in-air sample environment and operation. Scattering angles are small and diffraction directed forward allows for simple detector setups.

== Advantages ==

High-energy X-rays (HEX-rays) between 100 and 300&amp;nbsp;keV bear unique advantage over conventional hard X-rays, which lie in the range of 5–20&amp;nbsp;keV &lt;ref name=Liss&gt;{{ cite journal |vauthors=Liss KD, Bartels A, Schreyer A, Clemens H |title=High energy X-rays: A tool for advanced bulk investigations in materials science and physics |journal=Textures Microstruct. |month= |year=2003 |volume=35 |issue=3/4 |pages=219–52 |doi=10.1080/07303300310001634952 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They can be listed as follows:

*High penetration into materials due to a strongly reduced photo absorption cross section. The photo-absorption strongly depends on the atomic number of the material and the X-ray energy. Several centimeter thick volumes can be accessed in steel and millimeters in lead containing samples.
*No radiation damage of the sample, which can pin incommensurations or destroy the chemical compound to be analyzed.
*The [[Ewald sphere]] has a curvature ten times smaller than in the low energy case and allows whole regions to be mapped in a [[reciprocal lattice]], similar to electron diffraction.
*Access to diffuse scattering. This is absorption and not extinction limited{{what|reason=What is the difference?|date=July 2016}}  at low energies while volume enhancement{{what|reason=Definition?|date=July 2016}} takes place at high energies. Complete 3D maps over several [[Brillouin zone]]s can be easily obtained.
*High momentum transfers are naturally accessible due to the high momentum of the incident wave. This is of particular importance for studies of liquid, amorphous and nanocrystalline materials as well as [[pair distribution function]] analysis.
*Realization of the [[Materials oscilloscope]].
*Simple diffraction setups due to operation in air.{{what|reason=What does this little fragment mean?|date=July 2016}}
*Diffraction in forward direction for easy registration with a 2D detector. Forward scattering and penetration make sample environments easy and straight forward.
*Negligible polarization effects due to relative small scattering angles.
*Special non-resonant magnetic scattering.
*[[LLL interferometry]].
*Access to high-energy spectroscopic levels, both electronic and nuclear.
*Neutron-like, but complementary studies combined with high precision spatial resolution.
*Cross sections for [[Compton scattering]] are similar to coherent scattering or absorption cross sections.

==Applications==
[[File:HEX-2D-diffraction.png|thumb|right|250px|Two-dimensional [[powder diffraction]] setup for ''high-energy X-rays''. HEX-rays entering from the left are diffracted in forward direction at the sample and registered by a 2D detector such as an image plate.&lt;ref name="Liss"/&gt;]]
With these advantages, HEX-rays can be applied for a wide range of investigations. An overview, which is far from complete:

*Structural investigations of real materials, such as metals, ceramics, and liquids. In particular, in-situ studies of phase transitions at elevated temperatures up to the melt of any metal. Phase transitions, recovery, chemical segregation, recrystallization, twinning and domain formation are a few aspects to follow in a single experiment.
*Materials in chemical or operation environments, such as electrodes in batteries, fuel cells, high-temperature reactors, electrolytes etc. The penetration and a well-collimated pencil beam allows focusing in the region and material of interest while it undergoes a chemical reaction.
*Study of 'thick' layers, such as oxidation of steel in its production and rolling process, which are too thick for classical reflectometry experiments. Interfaces and layers in complicated environments, such as the intermetallic reaction of [[BlueScope|Zincalume]] surface coating on industrial steel in the liquid bath.
*In situ studies of industrial like strip casting processes for light metals. A casting setup can be set up on a beamline and probed with the HEX-ray beam in real time.
*Bulk studies in single crystals differ from studies in surface-near regions limited by the penetration of conventional X-rays. It has been found and confirmed in almost all studies, that critical scattering and correlation lengths are strongly affected by this effect.
*Combination of neutron and HEX-ray investigations on the same sample, such as contrast variations due to the different scattering lengths.
*Residual stress analysis in the bulk with unique spatial resolution in centimeter thick samples; in-situ under realistic load conditions.
*In-situ studies of thermo-mechanical deformation processes such as forging, rolling, and extrusion of metals.
*Real time texture measurements in the bulk during a deformation, phase transition or annealing, such as in metal processing.
*Structures and textures of geological samples which may contain heavy elements and are thick.
*High resolution triple crystal diffraction for the investigation of single crystals with all the advantages of high penetration and studies from the bulk.
*Compton spectroscopy for the investigation of momentum distribution of the valence electron shells.
*Imaging and tomography with high energies. Dedicated sources can be strong enough to obtain 3D tomograms in a few seconds. Combination of imaging and diffraction is possible due to simple geometries. For example, tomography combined with residual stress measurement or structural analysis.

{{DISPLAYTITLE:''It Came from Outer Space'' (book)}}
'''''It Came From Outer Space''''' was a 2003 publication of four versions of [[Ray Bradbury]]'s screen treatments written in 1952 for the [[It Came from Outer Space|movie]] of the same name that was released in 1953. The treatments range from a 37-page outline to a 119-page story. Bradbury did not write the final screenplay.
 
Bradbury's previously unpublished short story "A Matter of Taste" was the inspiration for his treatments, and was included in this edition. The collection was edited by [[Donn Albright]], who also edited Gauntlet Press' 2005 version of Bradbury's ''[[The Halloween Tree]]''.

==Early life and education==
Jan Lexell was born in [[Luleå|Luleå, Sweden]], where he attended [[elementary school]] and [[high school]]. As a junior, he was active in sports. He was a junior national team player in [[table tennis]] and took 5th place at the [[European Table Tennis Championships]] for [[Under-20 athletics|under-20s]] in 1975 as his best result.&lt;ref name=Riksidrott /&gt; After completing high school, he continued his education at [[Umeå University]]. He has said that it was his great interest in [[training]] and [[human body|the human body]] that led him to [[medical education]]. Lexell studied as a doctor and graduated in 1984. A year later, in 1985, he obtained a [[medical degree]], also at Umeå University, with the [[thesis]] "Distribution of different fiber types in human skeletal muscles".&lt;ref name=Lund /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Distribution of different fibre types in human skeletal muscles. Fibre type arrangement in m. vastus lateralis from three groups of healthy men between 15 and 83 years.|pmid=3711935}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his [[dissertation]], he continued his [[muscle]] research and [[Specialty (medicine)|specialist education]] to become a [[neurologist]] in Umeå. This took him to [[Liverpool University]] in the UK.&lt;ref name="Vetenskap"&gt;{{cite web|title=Träning och idrott i ett livsperspektiv|url=http://www.vetenskaphalsa.se/traning-och-idrott-i-ett-livsperspektiv/|publisher=Vetenskap och Hälsa|accessdate=12 April 2018|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995 he moved to [[Skåne]] to study [[rehabilitation medicine]]. In parallel with his clinical work and [[research]] in [[neurological rehabilitation]] in [[Lund]], he helped set up the Department of Health Sciences at Sunderby Hospital, Sweden, in 2000. His work there has led to almost 50 doctoral [[dissertations]].&lt;ref name=Luleå /&gt; Until 2010, Lexell was also [[adjunct professor]] of clinical [[Neurology|neuroscience]] at [[Luleå University of Technology]]. In 2013 he was appointed [[Professor]] of [[physical medicine and rehabilitation]] at [[Lund University]] and in 2016 as a [[visiting professor]] at the Department of Health Sciences, [[Luleå University of Technology]].&lt;ref name=Lund /&gt;&lt;ref name=Luleå /&gt;&lt;ref name="Vetenskap" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2250">The '''Large Optical Test and Integration Site''', or '''LOTIS''', is a facility at the [[Lockheed Martin Space Systems]] Company in [[Sunnyvale, CA]] for testing large optical components under realistic conditions.    LOTIS has large, thermally stabilized [[vacuum chamber]], vibration-isolated optical benches, and a large 6.5 meter telescope (run backwards as a collimator) to create images for the test optics to view.  It can generate images from the visible through the mid-wavelength IR.

The fabrication error in the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] main mirror is the classic example that shows the need for such testing.  In this case, a test facility such as LOTIS was not easily available, so the completed optics were not tested as a unit, and instead relied on careful testing of the individual components.  Unfortunately, due to a mis-assembled [[null corrector]], one of the tests was wrong, and a mis-[[Figuring|figured]] mirror was not discovered until the telescope was placed into service.  This is exactly the type of problem that LOTIS can detect, since it is designed to test large optical systems as a unit by creating realistic inputs and operating conditions for them.

'''Lentiviral vectors in gene therapy''' is a method by which genes can be inserted, modified, or deleted in organisms using [[lentivirus]].

Lentivirus are a family of [[virus]]es that are responsible for notable diseases like [[HIV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Lentiviral vectors for gene therapy | url = http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1346459/ | author = Knight SB | year = 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lentivirus is unique in that it has been the basis of research using viruses in [[gene]] therapy. To be effective in [[gene therapy]], there must be insertion, alteration and/or removal of [[host cell]] genes. To do this scientists use the lentivirus' mechanisms of infection to achieve a desired outcome to gene therapy.

To understand the capabilities of a lentiviral [[Vector_(molecular_biology)|vector]], one has to consider the biology of the infection process. The lentivirus is a retrovirus, meaning it has a single stranded [[RNA]] [[genome]] with a reverse transcriptase enzyme. Lentiviruses also have a [[viral envelope]] with protruding [[glycoproteins]] that aid in attachment to the host cell's outer membrane. The virus contains a [[reverse transcriptase]] molecule found to perform [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] of the viral genetic material upon entering the cell. Within the viral genome are RNA sequences that code for specific proteins that facilitate the incorporation of the viral sequences into the host cell genome. The "gag" domain codes for the structural components of the virus like the capsid, the matrix, nucleoproteins. The "pol" domain codes for the reverse transcriptase and integrase enzymes. Lastly, the "env" domain of the viral genome encodes for the glycoproteins and envelope on the surface of the virus.&lt;ref name="pmid12676350"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Brenner S, Malech HL |title=Current developments in the design of onco-retrovirus and lentivirus vector systems for hematopoietic cell gene therapy |journal=Biochim. Biophys. Acta |volume=1640 |issue=1 |pages=1–24 |date=April 2003 |pmid=12676350 |doi= 10.1016/S0167-4889(03)00024-7|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are multiple steps involved in the infection and replication of a lentivirus in a host cell. In the first step the virus uses its surface glycoproteins for attachment to the outer surface of a cell. More specifically, lentiviruses attach to the CD40 ligand glycoproteins on the surface of a hosts target cell. The viral material is then injected into the host cell's cytoplasm. Within the cytoplasm the viral reverse transcriptase enzyme performs reverse transcription of the viral RNA genome to create a viral DNA genome. The viral DNA is then sent into the nucleus of the host cell where it is incorporated into the host cell's genome with the help of the viral enzyme [[integrase]]. From now on, the host cell starts to transcribe the entire viral RNA and express the structural viral proteins, in particular those that form the viral capsid and the envelop. The lentiviral RNA and the viral proteins than assemble and the newly formed [[virions]]  burst from the host cell when enough are made.

== Use as a vector ==
Some experimental applications of lentiviral vectors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biology.kenyon.edu/slonc/gene-web/Lentiviral/Lentivi2.html|title=What are lentiviral vectors?}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been done in gene therapy in order to cure diseases like Diabetes mellitus, Murine haemophilia A, prostate cancer, chronic granulomatous disease, and vascular diseases. Therapy requires manipulation of the lentivirus genes and structure for delivery of specific genes to alter the course of the disease. Researchers and scientists do this through the use of transinfection, which is the action of infecting a cell with a microbe to gain different genes or desired traits. [[HIV]]-derived lentiviral vectors have been used for introducing libraries of [[complementary DNA]]s, [[short hairpin RNA]]s, and [[cis-regulatory element]]s into many targets, including [[embryonic stem cell]]s.&lt;ref name="pmid27609877"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Naldini L, Trono D, Verma IM | title=Lentiviral vectors, two decades later | journal= [[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume=353 | issue=6304 | pages=1101–1102 | year=2016 | DOI=10.1126/science.aah6192  | PMID = 27609877}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==

=== Vascular transplants ===

In a study designed to enhance the outcomes of vascular transplant through vascular endothelial cell gene therapy, the third generation of Lentivirus showed to be effective in the delivery of genes to moderate venous grafts and transplants in procedures like coronary artery bypass. Because the virus has been adapted to lose most of its genome, the virus becomes safer and more effective in transplanting the required genes into the host cell. A draw back to this therapy is explained in the study that long-term gene expression may require the use of promoters and can aid in a greater trans-gene expression. The researchers accomplished this by the addition of self-inactivating plasmids and creating a more universal tropism by pseudotyping a vesicular stomatis virus glycoprotein.&lt;ref name="pmid12818564"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dishart KL, Denby L, George SJ, Nicklin SA, Yendluri S, Tuerk MJ, Kelley MP, Donahue BA, Newby AC, Harding T, Baker AH | title = Third-generation lentivirus vectors efficiently transduce and phenotypically modify vascular cells: implications for gene therapy | journal = J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. | volume = 35 | issue = 7 | pages = 739–48 |date=July 2003 | pmid = 12818564 | doi = 10.1016/S0022-2828(03)00136-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chronic Granulomatous Disease===

In [[chronic granulomatous disease]] immune functioning is deficient as a result of the loss of nicotinomide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase ([[NADP]]) in [[phagocyte]] cells, which aids in lipid and nucleic acid synthesis. If this becomes deficient, the bodies immune responses become weakened. Study performed in mice emphasizes the use of lineage-specific lentiviral vectors for the production of NADP. Scientists developed this strain of lentivirus by transinfecting 293T cells with pseudotyped virus with the vesicular stomatitis G protein. The viral vector's responsibility was to increase the gene synthesis and production of NADP in these phagocytic cells. They did this to create an affinity for myeloid cells.&lt;ref name="pmid21544095"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Barde I, Laurenti E, Verp S, Wiznerowicz M, Offner S, Viornery A, Galy A, Trumpp A, Trono D | title = Lineage- and stage-restricted lentiviral vectors for the gene therapy of chronic granulomatous disease | journal = Gene Ther. | volume = 18 | issue = 11 | pages = 1087–97 |date=November 2011 | pmid = 21544095 | doi = 10.1038/gt.2011.65 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prostate cancer ===

With prostate cancer, the Lentivirus is transformed by being bound to [[trastuzumab]] to attach to androgen-sensitive LNCaP and castration-resistant C4-2 human prostate cancer cell lines. These two cells are primarily responsible for secretion of excess human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ([[HER-2]]), which is a hormone linked to prostate cancer. By attaching to these cells and changing their genomes, the Lentivirus can slow down, and even kill, the cancer causing cells. Researchers caused the specificity of the vector by manipulating the Fab region of the viral genome and pseudotyped it with the Sindbis virus.&lt;ref name="pmid19373278"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zhang KX, Moussavi M, Kim C, Chow E, Chen IS, Fazli L, Jia W, Rennie PS | title = Lentiviruses with trastuzumab bound to their envelopes can target and kill prostate cancer cells | journal = Cancer Gene Ther. | volume = 16 | issue = 11 | pages = 820–31 |date=November 2009 | pmid = 19373278 | doi = 10.1038/cgt.2009.28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Haemophilia A ===

Haemophilia A has also been studied in gene therapy with a lentiviral vector in mice. The vector targets the haematopoietic cells in order to increase the amount of factor VIII, which is affected in haemophilia A. But this continues to be a subject of study as the lentivirus vector was not completely successful in achieving this goal. They did this by trans-infecting the virus in a 293T cell, creating a virus known as 2bF8 expressing generation of viral vectors.&lt;ref name="pmid17269937"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shi Q, Wilcox DA, Fahs SA, Fang J, Johnson BD, DU LM, Desai D, Montgomery RR | title = Lentivirus-mediated platelet-derived factor VIII gene therapy in murine haemophilia A | journal = J. Thromb. Haemost. | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = 352–61 |date=February 2007 | pmid = 17269937 | doi = 10.1111/j.1538-7836.2007.02346.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rheumatoid arthritis ===

Studies have also found that injection of a lentiviral vector with [[Interleukin 10|IL-10]] expressing genes in utero in mice can suppress, and prevent, rheumatoid arthritis and create new cells with constant gene expression. This contributes to the data on stem cells and in utero inoculation of viral vectors for gene therapy. The target for the viral vector in this study, were the synovial cells. Normally functioning synovial cells produce [[TNFα]] and [[Interleukin 1|IL-1]].&lt;ref name="pmid21390071"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Roybal JL, Endo M, Radu A, Zoltick PW, Flake AW |title=Early gestational gene transfer of IL-10 by systemic administration of lentiviral vector can prevent arthritis in a murine model |journal=Gene Ther. |volume=18 |issue=7 |pages=719–26 |date=July 2011 |pmid=21390071 |doi=10.1038/gt.2011.23 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Diabetes mellitus ===

Like many of the in utero studies, the lentiviral vector gene therapy for diabetes mellitus is more effective in utero as the stem cells that become affected by the gene therapy create new cells with the new gene created by the actual viral intervention. The vector targets the cells within the pancreas to add insulin secreting genes to help control diabetes mellitus. Vectors were cloned using a [[cytomegalovirus]] promoter and then cotransinfected in the 293T cell.&lt;ref name="pmid16171885"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Oh TK, Li MZ, Kim ST |title=Gene therapy for diabetes mellitus in rats by intramuscular injection of lentivirus containing insulin gene |journal=Diabetes Res. Clin. Pract. |volume=71 |issue=3 |pages=233–40 |date=March 2006 |pmid=16171885 |doi=10.1016/j.diabres.2005.08.005 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== C+H+O compounds ==
Each hydrogen added to a molecule can be considered as a proton plus a one-electron reduction of the redox state, while each oxygen counts as a two-electron oxidation.  Thus a net addition of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O is a simple hydration with no net change in redox state and frequently occurs reversibly in aqueous solution.  These relationships may be viewed in the following table ([[peroxide]]s and radicals are excluded; unstable or hypothetical compounds are italicized).

The list includes figures for both fixed wired broadband subscriptions and mobile cellular subscriptions:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/ict/material/TelecomICT_Indicators_Definition_March2010_for_web.pdf Definitions of World Telecommunication/ICT Indicators, March 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220064242/http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/ict/material/TelecomICT_Indicators_Definition_March2010_for_web.pdf |date=2014-12-20 }}, [[International Telecommunication Union]]. Retrieved on 30 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Fixed-broadband access refers to high-speed fixed (wired) access to the public [[Internet]] at downstream speeds equal to, or greater than, 256 kbit/s{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}. This includes [[satellite Internet access]], [[cable modem]], [[Digital subscriber line|DSL]], [[Fiber to the x|fibre-to-the-home/building]], and other fixed (wired) broadband subscriptions. The totals are measured irrespective of the method of payment. 
* Mobile-cellular access refers to high-speed mobile access to the public [[Internet]] at advertised data speeds equal to, or greater than, 256 kbit/s{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}. To be counted, a mobile subscription must allow access to the greater Internet via [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] and must have been used to make a data connection using the [[Internet Protocol]] in the previous three months. [[Short Message Service|SMS]] and [[Multimedia Messaging Service|MMS]] messaging do not count as an active Internet data connection even if they are delivered via IP.

Penetration rate is the percentage (%) of a country's population that are subscribers. A dash (&amp;mdash;) is shown when data for 2012 is not available. Non-country and disputed areas are shown in ''italics''. [[Taiwan]] is listed as a sovereign country.

Note: Because a single Internet subscription may be shared by many people and a single person my have more than one subscription, the penetration rate will not reflect the actual level of access to broadband Internet of the population and penetration rates larger than 100% are possible.

== [[Political economy]] and [[economics]] ==

===''[[The Wealth of Nations]]''===
* [[Adam Smith]]
* An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, 1776.
* [[s:The Wealth of Nations|Read it on Wikisource]]

'''Description:''' The book is usually considered to be the beginning of modern [[economics]].&lt;ref name=Sandmo&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sandmo|first1=Agnar|title=Economics evolving : a history of economic thought|date=2011|publisher=Princeton Univ. Press|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=9780691148427}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|15}}&lt;ref name=Canterbury&gt;{{cite book|last1=Canterbury|first1=E. Ray|title=A brief history of economics : artful approaches to the dismal science|date=2011|publisher=World Scientific|location=Singapore|isbn=9789814304801|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|45}}  It begins with a discussion of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Later it critiques the [[mercantilism]] and a synthesis of the emerging economic thinking of his time. It is best known for the idea of the [[invisible hand]] , although this idea is only mentioned once in the book.&lt;ref name=Sandmo/&gt;{{rp|43,47}} Smith was critical of the 'vile maxim' of the 'masters of mankind', all for themselves and nothing for other people. The Butcher, the Baker, and the Brewer provide goods and services to each other out of self-interest; the unplanned result of this division of labor is a better standard of living for all three.&lt;ref name=Canterbury/&gt;{{rp|48}}

'''Importance:''' Topic creator, Breakthrough, Influence, Introduction

===''[[Principles of Political Economy and Taxation]]''===
* [[David Ricardo]]
* [[On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation]], 1817.

'''Description:''' Elaborates, clarifies and corrects previous theories, and adds important new concepts

'''Importance:''' Breakthrough, influence (esp on Marx), broadened scientific foundations of economics

===''[[Das Kapital]]''===
* [[Karl Marx]]
* Das Kapital, 1867
* [[s:Das Kapital|Das Kapital ''on Wikisource'']]
*[https://web.archive.org/web/20040625152156/http://www.econ.utah.edu/ehrbar/akmc.htm Annotations, Explanations and Clarifications to Capital].

'''Description:''' '''''Das Kapital''''' is a political-economic treatise by [[Karl Marx]]. Marx wrote this critical analysis of [[capitalism]] and of the [[political economy]] from the perspective of historical materialism, the view that history can be understood as a sequence of modes of production in which exploiting classes extract an economic surplus from exploited classes.

'''Importance:'''  Breakthrough, Influence

===''[[Progress and Poverty]]''===
* [[Henry George]]
* [[Progress and Poverty]], 1879.
* [[s:Progress and Poverty (George)|Progress and Poverty ''on Wikisource'']]

'''Description:''' Describes how poverty in the midst of plenty results from unequal rights to use natural resources, and declining wages in the face of increasing labor productivity results from the Law of Rent. Advocated [[Georgism]], specifically a [[land value tax]].

'''Importance:'''  Influence, Breakthrough...

=== Principles of Economics (Menger) ===
* [[Carl Menger]], 1871. ''[[Principles of Economics (Menger)|Principles of Economics]]'', trans. from German, 1981.
* [http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=1279&amp;Itemid=28 Link to German version]

''Influence'': Credited with co-founding of [[marginal utility]] analysis and the [[Austrian School of economics]].

== [[Microeconomics]] ==

===''[[Value and Capital]]''===
* [[John Hicks|John R. Hicks]]
* Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1939, 1946, 2nd ed.

'''Description:''' See '''Importance'''.

'''Importance:''' The book ''built'' on [[ordinal utility]]  and mainstreamed the now-standard distinction between the [[substitution effect]] and the [[income effect]] for an individual in [[Consumer theory|demand theory]] in the 2-good case. It generalized analysis to the case of one good and all other goods, that is, the ''[[composite good]]''. It aggregated individuals and businesses through demand and supply across the economy. It anticipated the [[aggregation problem]], most acutely for the stock of capital goods. It introduced [[general equilibrium theory]] to an English-speaking audience, refined the theory, and for the first time attempted a rigorous statement of stability conditions for general equilibrium.

==[[Macroeconomics]]==
Among the most important list of publication in macroeconomics are:

===''[[General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money]]''===
* [[John Maynard Keynes]], ''[[General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money]]'', 1936

'''Description''': In this book, Keynes put forward a theory based upon the notion of [[aggregate demand]] to explain variations in the overall level of economic activity, such as were observed in the [[Great Depression]]. The total income in a society is defined by the sum of consumption and investment; and in a state of unemployment and unused production capacity, one can only enhance employment and total income by first increasing expenditures for either consumption or investment.

'''Importance:'''  Topic creator, Breakthrough, Influence

==[[Game theory]]==

===[[Theory of Games and Economic Behavior]]===
* [[John von Neumann]] and [[Oskar Morgenstern]]
* Princeton University Press, 1944

'''Description:''' The book by the [[mathematician]] [[John von Neumann]] and [[economist]] [[Oskar Morgenstern]]. It contained a mathematical theory of economic and social organization, based on a theory of games of strategy.

This is now a classic work, upon which modern-day [[game theory]] is based. Game theory has since been widely used to analyze real-world phenomena from [[arms race]]s to optimal policy choices of presidential candidates, from vaccination policy to major league baseball salary negotiations. It is today established, both throughout the social sciences and in a wide range of other sciences.

It moved mathematics out of the appendices (as in John R. Hicks's [[Value and Capital]]) and helped change how standard economic analysis across subjects could be done with the same mathematical methods.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3545">'''MOATA''' was a 100&amp;nbsp;kW [[Thermal reactor|thermal]] [[Argonaut class reactor]] built at the [[Australian Atomic Energy Commission]] (later [[Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation|ANSTO]]) Research Establishment at [[Lucas Heights, New South Wales|Lucas Heights, Sydney]]. MOATA went [[Critical mass|critical]] at 5:50am on 10 April 1961 and ended operations on 31 May 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/8911|title=Moata reactor|last=Marks|first=A. P.|date=1962|publisher=Australian Atomic Energy Commission|others=Australian Atomic Energy Commission|location=Lucas Heights, N.S.W.}}&lt;/ref&gt; MOATA was the first reactor to be decommissioned in Australia in 2009.

== Background ==
The design of university training reactor MOATA was based on the [[Argonaut class reactor|Argonaut]] research reactor developed by the [[Argonne National Laboratory]] in the mid-1950s, in the [[United States]]. Moata is an Aboriginal name meaning "gentle-fire" or "fire-stick".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ansto.gov.au/AboutANSTO/OPAL/Decommissioningearlierreactors/Moata/index.htm|title=MOATA Research Reactor|publisher=Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426083224/http://www.ansto.gov.au/AboutANSTO/OPAL/Decommissioningearlierreactors/Moata/index.htm|archivedate=26 April 2015|accessdate=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

MOATA was designed and built by the Advanced Technology Laboratories and first went critical on 10 April 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilson|first=D. J.|date=1983|title=Reduced enrichment fuel and its reactivity effects in the University Training Reactor Moata|url=http://inis.iaea.org/Search/search.aspx?orig_q=RN:15010309|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of the reactor was for training scientists, however in the mid-1970s it was expanded to include activation analysis and [[neutron radiography]]. MOATA initially offered training in reactor control and neutron physics, later [[neutron activation analysis]], [[Neutron imaging|neutron radiography]], soil analysis and nuclear medicine research.

== Decommissioning ==
The reactor was shut down in 1995 as it was no longer possible, after 34 years, to economically justify its continued operations. Experimental data on [[nuclear fuel]] and moderator systems was also accumulated during the operation of the reactor. With the dismantling of the reactor complete in 2009, the site has been completely restored. It was the first reactor to be decommissioned in Australia. 

In 1995 the used fuel from the reactor was unloaded and in 2006, it was shipped to the United States under the [[United States Department of Energy|US DoE]] Foreign Research Reactor Spent Nuclear Fuel Acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Finlay|first=R.|last2=Miller|first2=R.|last3=Dimitrovski|first3=L.|last4=Domingo|first4=X.|last5=Landau|first5=P.|last6=Valery|first6=J.|last7=Laloy|first7=V.|date=|title=Australian research reactors spent fuel management: the path to sustainability|url=http://www.euronuclear.org/meetings/rrfm2017/pdf/fullpapers/RRFM2017-A0104.pdf|journal=Conference proceedings RRFM2017|language=English|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3111">The '''Mandelbaum effect''' is the tendency for the eye to focus nearby in conditions of poor visibility. It was first codified by J. Mandelbaum in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;J. Mandelbaum (1960), ''An accommodation phenomenon'', Archives of Ophthalmology 63:923-926, quoted in Jannick P. Rolland, ''et al.'', [ftp://ftp.cs.unc.edu/pub/publications/techreports/93-044.ps.gz ''Towards Quantifying Depth and Size Perception in 3D Virtual Environments''], University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, retrieved 2007-08-25.&lt;/ref&gt;  Because dirty glass can aggravate the effect, potentially causing a [[Aviator|pilot]] or driver to miss seeing an obstacle or hazard, it is a strong safety argument for keeping windows clean.&lt;ref name=flint&gt;David Flint and David Wood, [http://avia141.com/Ch5_overview.htm ''Human Factors In The Aviation Environment''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928200859/http://avia141.com/Ch5_overview.htm |date=2007-09-28 }}, San Jose State University, retrieved 2007-08-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discussion==

When visibility is poor, as at night during rainstorms or fog, the [[human eye|eye]] tends to relax and focus on its best distance, technically known as "empty field" or "dark focus".&lt;ref name=cbsse&gt;Commission on Behavioral and Social Sciences and Education (1985), [http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=916&amp;page=14 ''Emergent Techniques for Assessment of Visual Performance''], National Academy of Sciences, Washington, D.C., retrieved 2007-08-18.&lt;/ref&gt; This distance is usually just under one meter (one yard), but varies considerably among people. The tendency is aggravated by objects close to the eye, drawing focus closer.&lt;ref name=flint/&gt;

It has been shown that the Mandelbaum effect is not a refractive error in the usual sense: it is not a structural characteristic of the eyes, but the effect arises from normal variations of perception in the brain.&lt;ref name=cbsse/&gt; As in the aviation condition known as [[spatial disorientation]], it is posited that some people are severely affected by the effect, some mildly, and some not at all.&lt;ref&gt;L.R. Stark and D.A. Atchison (2003), [http://www.optometrists.asn.au/ceo/backissues/vol81/no3/947 ''Effect of an intervening screen on accommodation to a distant object''], Optometrists Association Australia, retrieved 2007-08-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Aviation accidents and incidents|aviation]] and [[automobile safety]] research, the Mandelbaum effect is a useful tool in determining bias in stressful conditions. There seem to be consistent patterns in pilots' and drivers' perceptions during poor visibility. Methods of compensating for the Mandelbaum effect are still subject to research.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley N. Roscoe (1995), [http://www.aero.ca/News2_95.html ''The Mandelbaum Effect And Other Phenomena and their Implication on Pilot Selection''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070821000242/http://www.aero.ca/News2_95.html |date=2007-08-21 }}, Aeronews, retrieved 2007-08-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2287">In [[political science]], the '''minimal effects hypothesis''' states that [[political campaign]]s only marginally persuade and convert voters. The hypothesis was formulated during early research into [[voting behavior]] between the 1940s and the 1960s, and this period formed the initial "minimum effects" era in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bennet |last2= Shanto|title=A New Era of Minimal Effects?|journal=Journal of Communication|date=2008|volume=58|issue=1|page=707|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.2008.00410.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hypothesis seemed solid and was associated with the general assumption that voters had clear positions on issues and knew where candidates stood on these issues. Since then the minimal effects hypothesis has been criticized and empirical research since the 1980s has suggested that voters do have uncertainties about candidates' positions and these uncertainties do influence voters' decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn Vavreck (2001) "Voter Uncertainty and Candidate Contact: New Influences on Voting Behavior", Chapter 6 in Roderick P. Hart and Daron R. Shaw, eds, ''Communication in U.S. Elections: New Agendas'', Rowman and Littlefield Publishers: Lanham, {{ISBN|0-7425-0069-1}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=t3AX0ndC0ycC&amp;pg=PA92#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false pp. 92-94].&lt;/ref&gt; These findings have led to renewed interest in research into the effects of campaigns, with recent published research appearing both for and against the minimal effects hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Robert E. Goodin and James Mahmud Rice (2009) "[http://www.jamesmahmudrice.info/Poll.pdf Waking Up in the Poll Booth]", ''Perspectives on Politics'', 7(4), December, pp. 901-910 and D.

'''Morphological analysis''' or '''general morphological analysis''' is a method developed by [[Fritz Zwicky]] (1967, 1969) for exploring all the possible solutions to a multi-dimensional, non-quantified complex problem.&lt;ref name = "GMA"&gt;Ritchey, T. (1998). [http://www.swemorph.com/ma.html General Morphological Analysis: A general method for non-quantified modeling].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
General morphology was developed by [[Fritz Zwicky]], the Bulgarian-born, Swiss-national [[astrophysicist]] based at the [[California Institute of Technology]]. Among others, Zwicky applied morphological analysis (MA) to astronomical studies and the development of jet and [[Spacecraft propulsion|rocket propulsion]] systems. As a problem-structuring and [[Problem solving|problem-solving]] technique, MA was designed for multi-dimensional, non-quantifiable problems where causal modeling and simulation do not function well, or at all. Zwicky developed this approach to address seemingly non-reducible complexity: using the technique of cross-consistency assessment (CCA) (Ritchey, 1998), the system allows for reduction by identifying the possible solutions that actually exist, eliminating the illogical solution combinations in a grid box rather than reducing the number of variables involved. A detailed introduction to morphological modeling is given in Ritchey (2002, 2006). A summary of some 80 published articles exemplifying the various applications of general morphology, including engineering design, technological forecasting, organizational development and policy analysis, is available in Álvarez &amp; Ritchey (2015).

===Morphological analysis of real-world problems===
Consider a complex, real-world problem, like those of marketing or making policies for a nation, where there are many governing factors, and most of them cannot be expressed as numerical time series data, as one would like to have for building mathematical models. 

The conventional approach here would be to break the system down into parts, isolate the vital parts (dropping the 'trivial' components) for their contributions to the output and solve the simplified system for creating desired models or scenarios. The disadvantage of this method is that real-world scenarios do not behave rationally: more often than not, a simplified model will break down when the contribution of the 'trivial' components becomes significant. Also, importantly, the behaviour of many components will be governed by the states of, and their relations with, other components – ones that may be seen to be minor before the analysis.

Morphological analysis, on the other hand, does not drop any of the components from the system itself, but works backwards from the output towards the system internals.&lt;ref&gt;Modelling Complex Socio-Technical Systems Using Morphological Analysis (Ritchey 2003-06)[http://www.swemorph.com/pdf/it-webart.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Again, the interactions and relations get to play their parts in MA and their effects are accounted for in the analysis.

The '''United States's Sculpin nuclear test series'''&lt;ref name=LT_1 /&gt; was a group of 7 [[nuclear test]]s conducted in 1990-1991. These tests &lt;ref group=note&gt;A bomb test may be a salvo test, defined as two or more explosions "where a period of time between successive individual explosions does not exceed 5 seconds and where the burial points of all explosive devices can be connected by segments of straight lines, each of them connecting two burial points and does not exceed 40 kilometers in length". {{cite paper|first=V.

 !style="background:#ffdead;" | Name &lt;ref group=note&gt;The US, France and Great Britain have code-named their test events, while the USSR and China did not, and therefore have only test numbers (with some exceptions &amp;ndash; Soviet peaceful explosions were named). Word translations into English in parentheses unless the name is a proper noun. A dash followed by a number indicates a member of a salvo event.  The US also sometimes named the individual explosions in such a salvo test, which results in "name1 &amp;ndash; 1(with name2)". If test is canceled or aborted, then the row data like date and location discloses the intended plans, where known.&lt;/ref&gt;
 !style="background:#efefef;" | Date time ([[Universal Time|UT]])
 !style="background:#ffdead;" | Local [[Time Zone|time zone]] &lt;ref group=note&gt;To convert the UT time into standard local, add the number of hours in parentheses to the UT time; for local daylight saving time, add one additional hour. If the result is earlier than 00:00, add 24 hours and subtract 1 from the day; if it is 24:00 or later, subtract 24 hours and add 1 to the day. All historical timezone data are derived from here:&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Timezone Historical Database| publisher=iana.com| url=http://www.ietf.org/timezones/| accessdate=March 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some locations are extremely accurate; others (like airdrops and space blasts) may be quite inaccurate. "~" indicates a likely pro-forma rough location, shared with other tests in that same area.&lt;/ref&gt;
 !style="background:#ffdead;" | [[Elevation]] + height &lt;ref group=note&gt;Elevation is the ground level at the point directly below the explosion relative to sea level; height is the additional distance added or subtracted by tower, balloon, shaft, tunnel, air drop or other contrivance. For rocket bursts the ground level is "N/A". In some cases it is not clear if the height is absolute or relative to ground, for example, ''Plumbbob/John''.  No number or units indicates the value is unknown, while "0" means zero. Sorting on this column is by elevation and height added together.&lt;/ref&gt;
 !style="background:#efefef;" | Delivery &lt;ref group=note&gt;Atmospheric, airdrop, balloon, gun, cruise missile, rocket, surface, tower, and barge are all disallowed by the [[Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty]]. Sealed shaft and tunnel are underground, and remained useful under the PTBT. Intentional cratering tests are borderline; they occurred under the treaty, were sometimes protested, and generally overlooked if the test was declared to be a peaceful use.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purpose &lt;ref group=note&gt;Include weapons development, weapon effects, safety test, transport safety test, war, science, joint verification and industrial/peaceful, which may be further broken down.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Otto Struve Tel Nima.JPG|240px|thumb|right|The telescope's dome]]

The '''Otto Struve Telescope''' was the first major [[telescope]] to be built at [[McDonald Observatory]].  Located in the [[Davis Mountains]] in West [[Texas]], the Otto Struve Telescope was designed by [[Warner &amp; Swasey Company]] and constructed between 1933 and 1939 by the [[Paterson-Leitch Company]]. Its {{convert|82|in|m|adj=on}} mirror was the second largest in the world at the time.&lt;ref&gt;It was second only to the [[Mount Wilson Observatory#100 inch .282.5 m.29 Hooker telescope|Mt. Wilson {{convert|100|in|m|adj=on}} telescope]].&lt;/ref&gt;  It was named after the Russian-American astronomer [[Otto Struve]] in 1966, three years after his death.

The Davis Mountains is an excellent location for astronomical research because of the clear dry air and moderately high elevation. The remote nature of the facility proved to be a significant challenge in transporting such a large mirror.  It was a very precarious journey for the Otto Struve Telescope's mirror to this remote part of Texas and up to the top of [[Mount Locke]]. The mirror was transported from the local town of [[Fort Davis, Texas|Fort Davis]] up the mountain by [[Carleton D. Wilson]], owner of a local trucking company, while locals cheered as they looked on.

The Otto Struve telescope is still in use today. It is updated with modern imaging detectors allowing astronomers to conduct many types of research.

==Notable science==
*The telescope was one of two used to set up and define the [[Harold Johnson (astronomer)|Johnson]]-[[William Wilson Morgan|Morgan]] [[UBV photometric system]].

==Contemporaries on commissioning==
The Otto Struve telescope saw first light in 1939, behind the 100-inch Hooker telescope and ahead of two large [[British Commonwealth]] telescopes, both in Canada. Many competing projects were delayed due to the war in the early 1940s.

Four largest telescopes in 1939:

== Description ==

The Pea galaxies, also known as Green Peas (GPs), are compact oxygen-rich emission line [[galaxy]] that were discovered at [[redshift]] between ''z'' = 0.112 and 0.360.&lt;ref name=gzdiscovery/&gt;  These low-mass galaxies have an upper size limit generally no bigger than {{convert|16300|ly|pc|lk=on}} across, and typically they reside in environments less than two-thirds the density of normal galaxy environments.&lt;ref name=gzdiscovery/&gt; An average GP has a redshift of ''z'' = 0.258, a mass of ~3,200 million {{Solar mass}} (~3,200 million solar masses), a star formation rate of {{Solar mass|~10}}/yr (~10 solar masses a year), an [[Doubly ionized oxygen|[O III]]] [[equivalent width]] of 69.4 [[nanometre|nm]] and a low [[metallicity]].&lt;ref name=gzdiscovery/&gt;&lt;ref name="Amorin 2010"&gt;{{cite journal| author=R.

They have a strong emission line at the [OIII] [[wavelength]] of 500.7&amp;nbsp;nm.

== History of discovery ==

===Years 2007 to 2010===

[[Galaxy Zoo]] (GZ) is a project online since July 2007 which seeks to [[Galaxy morphological classification|classify]] up to one million galaxies.&lt;ref name=GZ_Morph&gt;{{cite journal |author=C.J.

These "Pea galaxies" appear in the SDSS as unresolved green images. This is because the Peas have a very bright, or powerful, [[Spectral line]] in their spectra for highly-[[ionization|ionized]] [[oxygen]], which in SDSS color composites increases the [[luminosity]], or brightness, of the "r" color band with respect to the two other color bands "g" and "i". The "r" color band shows as green in SDSS images.&lt;ref name=gzdiscovery/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=SDSS Color |url=http://cas.sdss.org/dr6/en/proj/basic/color/ |accessdate=2010-01-23 |publisher=[[Sloan Digital Sky Survey]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enthusiasts, calling themselves the "Peas Corps" (another humorous play on the [[Peace Corps]]), collected over a hundred of these Peas, which were eventually placed together into a dedicated [[Conversation threading|discussion thread]] started by Carolin Cardamone in July 2008. The collection, once refined, provided values that could be used in a systematic computer search of the GZ database of one million objects, which eventually resulted in a sample of 251 Pea galaxies, also known as Green Peas (GPs).

In November 2009, authors C. Cardamone, Kevin Schawinski, M. Sarzi, S. Bamford, N. Bennert, C. Urry, [[Chris Lintott]], W. Keel and 9 others published a paper in the [[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]] titled "Galaxy Zoo Green Peas: Discovery of A Class of Compact Extremely Star-Forming Galaxies".&lt;ref name=gzdiscovery/&gt; Within this paper, 10 Galaxy Zoo volunteers are acknowledged as having made a particularly significant contribution. They are: Elisabeth Baeten, Gemma Coughlin, Dan Goldstein, Brian Legg, Mark McCallum, Christian Manteuffel, Richard Nowell, Richard Proctor, Alice Sheppard and Hanny Van Arkel. They are thanked for "giving Peas a chance".

It would be wrong to assume that the 80 GPs were all new discoveries. Out of the 80 original, 46 GPs have previous citations dated before November 2009 in the [[NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database]]. The original 80 GPs were part of a sample from [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey|SDSS]] data-release 7 (DR7), but did not include galaxies from other sources. Some of these other sources did include objects that might well have been classed as GPs if they were in the SDSS sample. One example of a paper that demonstrates this is: In April 2009, authors J. J. Salzer, A. L. Williams and C. Gronwall published a paper in [[the Astrophysical Journal]] Letters titled "A Population of Metal-Poor Galaxies with ~L* Luminosities at Intermediate Redshifts".&lt;ref name=Salzer_2009&gt;{{cite journal |author=John J. Salzer |author2=Anna L.Williams |author3=Caryl Gronwall |last-author-amp=yes |title=A Population of Metal-Poor Galaxies with ~L* Luminosities at Intermediate Redshifts |date=2009 |journal=The Astrophysical Journal Letters |volume=695 |issue=1 |bibcode=2009ApJ...695L..67S |doi=10.1088/0004-637X/695/1/L67 |arxiv=0903.3948 |pages=L67–L71}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this paper, "new spectroscopy and metallicity estimates for a sample of 15 star-forming galaxies with redshifts in the range 0.29&amp;nbsp;– 0.42" were presented. These objects were selected using the KPNO International Spectroscopic Survey (KISS).&lt;ref name=Salzer_KISS_2000&gt;{{cite journal |author=J. J. Salzer |display-authors=4 |author2=C.

Indeed, quoting from Salzer et al. 2009, section 4.1, it reads "A New Class of Galaxy? Given the large number of studies of metal abundances in galaxies with intermediate and high redshift mentioned in the Introduction, it may seem odd that systems similar to those described here have not been recognized previously."&lt;ref name=Salzer_2009/&gt;

In June 2010, authors R. Amorin, E. Perez-Montero and J. Vilchez published a paper in [[The Astrophysical Journal]] Letters titled "On the oxygen and nitrogen chemical abundances and the evolution of the "green pea" galaxies".&lt;ref name="Amorin 2010"/&gt; In it they explore issues concerning the [[metallicity]] of 79 GPs, disputing the original findings in Cardamone et al. They conclude, "arguing that recent interaction-induced inflow of gas, possibly coupled with a selective metal-rich gas loss drive by [[supernova]] winds may explain our findings and the known galaxy properties".&lt;ref name="Amorin 2010"/&gt; More details here:[[Pea galaxy#Two Papers by R.Amorin.2C J.M.Vilchez and E.Perez-Montero|Two papers by Amorin]]

===2011===

In February 2011, authors Y. Izotov, N. Guseva and T.

Through comparisons of the three objects using proven [[methodology]] and analysis of metallicity, they conclude that "the high nitrogen-to-oxygen ratios derived in some Green Pea galaxies may be caused by the fact that their SDSS spectra are spectra of composite nebulae made up of several components with different physical properties (such as metallicity).

===LyC Detection in J1152+3400, J1333+6246, J1442-0209, J1503+3644===

In October 2016, a study was published in the [[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|MNRAS]] entitled: "Detection of high Lyman continuum leakage from four low-redshift compact star-forming galaxies". Its authors are Y. I. Izotov, D. Schaerer, T. X. Thuan, G. Worseck, N. G. Guseva, I. Orlitova, A. Verhamme.&lt;ref name="Detect_LyC"/&gt; The abstract states: "Following our first detection reported in Izotov et al. (2016) [as above], we present the detection of Lyman continuum (LyC) radiation of four other compact star-forming galaxies observed with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) onboard the Hubble Space Telescope (HST)".

This study contains the methods and findings from Izotov et al. 2016 (a) which concentrated on one galaxy, whereas the above paper, Izotov et al. 2016 (b) has findings for four galaxies, all of which have LyC leakage. When compared with other known local galaxies that leak LyC, as listed in this article, Izotov et al. 2016 (a &amp; b) doubles the numbers of known leakers.&lt;ref name=Detect_LyC/&gt;&lt;ref name=J0925_Nature/&gt;

== Lyman Alpha Emission from Green Peas ==
[[File:Greenpea lya.jpg |thumbnail|GP Spectra indicating the resonant scattering of Lyα photons.]] In May 2015, authors Alaina Henry, Claudia Scarlata, Crystal Martin, and Dawn Erb published a paper titled: "Lyα Emission from Green Peas: The Role of Circumgalactic Gas Density, Covering, and Kinematics".&lt;ref name=Henry15/&gt;  The motivation of this work was to understand why some galaxies have Lyα emission, while others don't. A host of physical conditions in galaxies regulate the output of this spectral feature; hence, understanding its emission is fundamentally important for understanding how galaxies form and how they impact their intergalactic surroundings.

Henry et al. hypothesized that, since the GPs seem more like galaxies at redshift=z&gt;2, and Lyα is common at these redshifts, that Lyα would be common in the GPs as well. Observations with the HST using the COS, as in 'Description', proved this to be true for a sample of 10 GPs.&lt;ref name=Henry15/&gt; The spectra, shown here to the right, indicate resonant scattering of Lyα photons that are emitted near zero velocity. The wealth of data existing on the GPs, combined with the COS spectra, allowed Henry et al. to explore the physical mechanisms that regulate the Lyα output. These authors concluded that variations in the amount of neutral hydrogen gas, which scatters Lyα photons, are the cause of a factor of 10 difference in Lyα output in their sample.&lt;ref name=Henry15/&gt;

The spectrum of GP_J1219 (an image of which is in 'Description') shows its very strong flux measurements when compared to other 9 GPs.&lt;ref name=Henry15/&gt; Indeed, only GP_J1214 has a value approaching that of J1219. Note also the double peaks in some GPs and the velocity values of the emissions, indicating the inflow and outflow of matter in the GPs.&lt;ref name=Henry15/&gt;

== Two papers by A. Jaskot and M.S. Oey ==

In April 2013, authors A. Jaskot and M. Oey published a paper in [[The Astrophysical Journal]] titled "The Origin and Optical Depth of Ionizing Radiation in the "Green Pea" Galaxies".&lt;ref name="Jaskot"/&gt; Six "extreme" GPs are studied. Using these, they endeavour to narrow down the list of possibilities about what is producing the UV-radiation and the substantial amounts of high-energy [[photon]] that might be escaping from the GPs.&lt;ref name=Jaskot/&gt; Through trying to observe these photons in nearby galaxies such as the GPs, our understanding of how galaxies behaved in the early Universe might well be revolutionised. It is reported that the GPs are exciting candidates to help astronomers understand a major milestone in the development of the cosmos 13 billion years ago, during the epoch of [[reionization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Michigan_Uni_PR|url=http://www.ns.umich.edu/new/releases/21352-green-pea-galaxies-could-help-astronomers-understand-early-universe|accessdate=2014-03-27|publisher=[[University of Michigan]]|date=2013-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the publication, Jaskot and Oey write: "We are currently analyzing observations from IMACS and MagE on the [[Magellan Telescopes]] and COS and ACS on [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (HST) to distinguish between WR ([[Wolf-Rayet star]]) and the shock ionization scenarios and confirm the GPs’ [[optical depth]]s.&lt;ref name=Jaskot_GH2013/&gt;  The absence of WR features in the deeper IMACS spectra tentatively supports the shock scenario, although the detection limits do not yet definitively rule out the WR [[photoionization]] hypothesis."&lt;ref name=Jaskot_GH2013/&gt;

Color selection was by using the difference in the levels of three [[Optical filter]]s, in order to capture these color limits: u-r ≤ 2.5 (1), r-i ≤ -0.2 (2), r-z ≤ 0.5 (3), g-r ≥ r-i + 0.5 (4), u-r ≥ 2.5 (r-z) (5).&lt;ref name=gzdiscovery/&gt; If the diagram on the right (one of two in the paper) is looked at, the effectiveness of this color selection can be seen. The [[Color-color diagram]] shows ~100 GPs (green crosses), 10,000 comparison galaxies (red points) and 9,500 comparison [[quasar]] (purple stars) at similar redshifts to the GPs. The black lines show how these figures are on the diagram.

Comparing a GP to the [[Milky Way]] can be useful when trying to visualize these star-forming rates. An average GP has a mass of ~3,200 million {{Solar mass}} (~3,200 million solar masses).&lt;ref name=gzdiscovery/&gt; The Milky Way (MW) is a [[spiral galaxy]] and has a mass of ~1,125,000, million {{Solar mass}} (~1,125,000 million solar masses).&lt;ref name=Mass_Model&gt;{{cite journal| author=Paul J.McMillan| title=Mass models of the Milky Way| date=2011| journal=MNRAS| volume=414| issue=3| bibcode=2011MNRAS.414.2446M| doi=10.1111/j.1365-2966.2011.18564.x| arxiv=1102.4340| pages=2446–2457}}&lt;/ref&gt; So the MW has the mass of ~390 GPs.

Research has shown that the MW converts {{Solar mass|~2}}/yr (~2 solar masses per year) worth of [[interstellar medium]] into stars.&lt;ref name=Star_Form_rates&gt;{{cite journal| author=Laura Chomiuk| author2=Matthew S. Povich| title=Toward a Unification of Star Formation Rate Determinations in the Milky Way and Other Galaxies| date=2011| journal=The Astronomical Journal| volume=142| issue=6| bibcode=2011AJ....142..197C| doi=10.1088/0004-6256/142/6/197| arxiv=1110.4105| pages=197}}&lt;/ref&gt; An average GP converts {{Solar mass|~10}}/yr (~10 solar masses) of interstellar gas into stars, which is ~5 times the rate of the MW.&lt;ref name=gzdiscovery/&gt;

One of the original ways of recognizing GPs, before [[SQL]] programming was involved, was because of a discrepancy about how the SDSS labels them within Skyserver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=SDSS Skyserver | url=http://cas.sdss.org/dr7/en/ | publisher=[[Sloan Digital Sky Survey]] | accessdate=2010-01-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Out of the 251 of the original GP sample that were identified by the SDSS spectroscopic pipeline as having galaxy spectra, only 7 were targeted by the SDSS spectral fibre allocation as galaxies i.e. 244 were not.&lt;ref name=gzdiscovery/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=C.

== Two Papers by R.Amorin, J.M.Vilchez and E.Perez-Montero ==

In June 2010, authors R. Amorín, E. Pérez-Montero and J.M. Vílchez published a paper in  [[The Astrophysical Journal]] letters titled "On the Oxygen and Nitrogen Chemical Abundances and the Evolution of the "Green Pea" Galaxies", which disputes the metallicities calculated in the original Cardamone et al. GPs paper &lt;ref name=gzdiscovery/&gt;&lt;ref name="Amorin 2010"/&gt; Amorin et al. use a different methodology from Cardamone et al. to produce metallicity values more than one fifth (20%) of the previous values (about 20% solar or one fifth solar) for the 80 'starburst' GPs. These mean values are log[O/H]+12~8.05, which shows a clear offset of 0.65dex between the two papers' values. For these 80 GPs, Amorin et al., using a direct method, rather than strong-line methods as used in Cardamone et al., calculate physical properties, as well as [[oxygen]] and [[nitrogen]] ionic abundances.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | author=E. Pérez-Montero | author2=T. Contini | date=2009 | title=The impact of the nitrogen-to-oxygen ratio on ionized nebulae diagnostics based on [NII] emissionlines | journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]] | volume=398 |issue=2 |pages=949–960 | bibcode=2009MNRAS.398..949P | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2966.2009.15145.x | arxiv=0905.4621 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These metals pollute hydrogen and helium, which make up the majority of the substances present in galaxies. As these metals are produced in [[Supernova]], the older a galaxy is, the more metals it would have. As GPs are in the nearby, or older, Universe, they should have more metals than galaxies at an earlier time.
[[File:Nitrogen-to-oxygen vs. oxygen-to-hydrogen abundance ratio.jpg|thumb|left|N/O vs. O/H abundance ratio]]

Amorin et al. find that the amount of metals, including the abundance of nitrogen, are different from normal values and that GPs are not consistent with the mass-metallicity relation, as concluded by Cardamone et al.&lt;ref name=gzdiscovery/&gt;&lt;ref name='A&amp;AA ID. AAA026.158.169'&gt;{{ cite journal | author=J. Lequeux | display-authors=etal | date=1979 | title=Chemical composition and evolution of irregular and blue compact galaxies | journal=[[Astronomy and Astrophysics]] | volume=80 |issue=2 |pages=155–166 | bibcode=1979A&amp;A....80..155L }}&lt;/ref&gt; This analysis indicates that GPs can be considered as genuine metal-poor galaxies. They then argue that this oxygen under-abundance is due to a recent interaction-induced inflow of gas, possibly coupled with a selective metal-rich gas loss driven by Supernovae winds and that this can explain their findings.&lt;ref name="Tremonti 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | author=F. Kristian | author2=R. Davé | date=2008 | title=The Origin of the Galaxy Mass-Metallicity Relation and Implications for Galactic Outflows | journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]] | volume=385 |issue=4 |pages=2181–2204 | bibcode=2008MNRAS.385.2181F | doi= 10.1111/j.1365-2966.2008.12991.x | arxiv=0704.3100 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This further suggests that GPs are likely very short-lived as the intense star formation in them would quickly enrich the gas.&lt;ref name="Amorin 2010"/&gt;
[[File:Oxygen-to-hydrogen vs. stellar mass.jpg|thumb|O/H vs. stellar mass]]

In May 2011, R.Amorin, J.M.Vilchez and E.Perez-Montero published a conference proceeding paper titled "Unveiling the Nature of the "Green Pea" galaxies".&lt;ref name=PeaConference/&gt; In it they review recent scientific results and announcing a forthcoming paper on their recent observations at the [[Gran Telescopio Canarias]].&lt;ref name=PeaConference/&gt; This paper is also a modified report of a presentation at the Joint European and National Astronomy Meeting (JENAM) 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title=JENAM_2010 | url=http://www.jenam2010.org | accessdate=2011-06-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They conclude that GPs are a genuine population of metal-poor, luminous and very compact starburst galaxies. Amongst the data, five graphs illustrate the findings they have made. Amorin et al. use masses calculated by Izotov, rather than by Cardamone.&lt;ref name="Amorin 2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Izotovetal/&gt; The metallicities that Amorin et al. use agree with Izotov's findings, or vice versa, rather than Cardamone's.&lt;ref name="Amorin 2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Izotovetal/&gt;

The first graph (on the left; fig.1 in paper) plots the nitrogen/oxygen vs. oxygen/hydrogen abundance ratio. The 2D histogram of SDSS star forming galaxies is shown in logarithmic scale while the GPs are indicated by circles. This shows that GPs are metal-poor.

[[File:Nitrogen-to- oxygen vs. stellar mass.jpg|thumb|left|N/O vs. stellar mass]]
The second graph (on the right; fig.2 in paper) plots O/H vs. stellar mass. The 2D histogram of SDSS SFGs is shown in logarithmic scale and their best likelihood fit is shown by a black solid line. The subset of 62 GPs are indicated by circles and their best linear fit is shown by a dashed line. For comparison we also show the quadratic fit presented in Amorin ''et al.'' 2010 for the full sample of 80 GPs. SFGs at z ≥ 2 by Erb et al. are also shown by asterisks for comparison.&lt;ref name="Amorin 2010"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | author=D.K. Erb | display-authors=4 | author2=A.E.

The fourth graph (on the right; fig.4 in paper) plots O/H vs. B-band (rest-frame) absolute magnitude. The meaning of symbols is indicated. Distances used in computing (extinction corrected) absolute magnitudes were, in all cases, calculated using spectroscopic redshifts and the same cosmological parameters.

The fifth graph (on the left; fig.5 in paper) plots gas mass fraction vs. metallicity. Different lines correspond to closed-box models at different yields, as indicated in the legend. Open and filled circles are GPs which are above and below the fit to their MZR. Diamonds are values for the same Wolf-Rayet galaxies as in Fig. 4.&lt;ref name="Amorin 2010"/&gt;

== GTC-OSIRIS Spectrophotometry ==

In February 2012, authors R. Amorin, E. Perez-Montero, J. Vilchez and P. Papaderos published a paper titled "The star formation history and metal content of the "Green Peas". New detailed GTC-OSIRIS spectrophotometry of three galaxies" in which they presented the findings of observations carried out using the [[Gran Telescopio Canarias]] at the [[Roque de los Muchachos Observatory]]. They gather deep broad-band imaging and long-slit [[spectroscopy]] of 3 GPs using high precision equipment.&lt;ref name=Amorin_GTC/&gt;

Their findings show that the three GPs display relatively low [[Extinction (astronomy)]], low oxygen abundances and high nitrogen-to-oxygen ratios.&lt;ref name=Amorin_GTC /&gt; Also reported are the clear signatures of [[Wolf–Rayet star]]s, of which a population are found (between ~800 and ~1200).&lt;ref name=Amorin_GTC /&gt; A combination of population and evolutionary synthesis models strongly suggest a formation history dominated by starbursts.&lt;ref name=Amorin_GTC /&gt; These models show that these three GPs currently undergo a major starburst producing between ~4% and ~20% of their stellar mass. However, as these models imply, they are old galaxies having formed most of their stellar mass several [[billion]] years ago.&lt;ref name=Amorin_GTC /&gt; The presence of old stars has been spectroscopically verified in one of the three galaxies by the detection of [[Magnesium]].&lt;ref name=Amorin_GTC /&gt; Surface photometry, using data from the Hubble Space Telescope archive, indicates that the three GPs possess an exponential low surface brightness envelope (see [[Low-surface-brightness galaxy]]).&lt;ref name=Amorin_GTC /&gt; This suggests that GPs are identifiable with major episodes in the assembly history of local Blue Compact Dwarf galaxies.&lt;ref name=Amorin_GTC /&gt;

The three galaxies are (using SDSS references):&lt;ref name=Amorin_GTC /&gt;

== Comparison of Green Peas to Luminous Compact Galaxies ==

In February 2011, Yuri Izotov, Natalia Guseva and Trinh Thuan published a paper titled "Green Pea Galaxies and Cohorts: Luminous Compact Emission-line Galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey", examining the GPs and comparing these to a larger set of 803 Luminous Compact Galaxies (LCGs).&lt;ref name=Izotovetal/&gt; They use a different set of selection criteria from Cardamone et al. These are: a) a high extinction-corrected luminosity &gt; 3x10^40 [[Erg]]s s^-1 of the hydrogen beta emission line; (see [[Hydrogen spectral series]]) b) a high equivalent width greater than 5&amp;nbsp;nm; c) a strong [OIII] wavelength at the 436.3&amp;nbsp;nm emission line allowing accurate abundance determination; d) a compact structure on SDSS images; and e) an absence of obvious [[Active galactic nucleus|active galactic nuclei]] spectroscopic features.&lt;ref name=Izotovetal/&gt;

Its conclusions (shortened) are:

# The selected galaxies have redshifts between 0.02 and 0.63, a range equal or greater than a factor of 2 when compared to the GPs. They find the properties of LCGs and GPs are similar to Blue Compact Dwarf galaxies. Explaining how the colours of emission-line galaxies change with distance using SDSS, they conclude that GPs are just subsamples within a narrow redshift range of their larger LCG sample.&lt;ref name=Izotovetal/&gt;
# Although there were no upper limits on the Hydrogen beta luminosities, it was found that there was a 'self-regulating' mechanism which bound the LCGs to a limit of ~3x10^42 [[Erg]]s s^-1.&lt;ref name=Izotovetal/&gt;
# In the [OIII] wavelength 500.7&amp;nbsp;nm ratio to hydrogen beta vs. [NII] wavelength 658.3&amp;nbsp;nm ratio to hydrogen alpha, LCGs occupy the region, in the diagnostic diagram, of star-forming galaxies with the highest excitation. However, some [[Active galactic nucleus|active galactic nuclei]] also lie in this region in the diagnostic diagram.&lt;ref name=Izotovetal/&gt;
# The oxygen abundances 12 + log O/H in LCGs are in the range 7.6–8.4 with a median value of ~8.11, confirming Amorin et al.'s analysis of a subset of GPs.&lt;ref name="Amorin 2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Izotovetal/&gt; This range of oxygen abundances is typical of nearby lower-luminosity Blue Compact Dwarfs. These results show that the original Cardamone et al. median oxygen abundance of 12 + log O/H = ~8.7 is overestimated, as a different, [[Empirical evidence]] method was originally used, rather than the direct method by Amorin et al. and Izotov et al.&lt;ref name=gzdiscovery/&gt; There is no dependence of oxygen abundance on redshift.
# In the luminosity-metallicity diagram (fig. 8 in paper), LCGs are shifted by ~2 magnitudes brighter when compared to nearby emission-line galaxies. LCGs form a common luminosity-metallicity relation, as for the most actively star-forming galaxies. Some LCGs have oxygen abundances and luminosities similar to Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs), despite much lower redshifts, thus enabling the study of LBGs through LCGs.&lt;ref name=Izotovetal/&gt;

== Radio detection of Green Peas ==

In February 2012, authors Sayan Chakraborti, Naveen Yadav, Alak Ray and Carolin Cardamone published a paper titled "Radio Detection of Green Peas: Implications for Magnetic Fields in Young Galaxies" which deals with the magnetic properties of the GPs.&lt;ref name=RadioDetection/&gt; In it, they describe observations which have produced some unexpected results raising puzzling questions about the origin and evolution of [[magnetism]] in young galaxies.&lt;ref name=RadioDetection/&gt; The ages are estimated from looking at the star formation that the GPs currently have ongoing and then estimating the age of the most recent starburst. GPs are very young galaxies, with models of the observed stellar populations indicating that they are around 10^8 (one hundred million) years old (1/100th the age of the [[Milky Way]]).&lt;ref name=RadioDetection/&gt; There is some question as to whether the GPs all started from the same starburst or if multiple starbursts went on (much older stellar populations are hidden as we can't see the light from these).

Using data from the [[Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope]] (GMRT) and archive observations from the [[Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array]] (VLA), Chakraborti et al. produced a set of results which are based around the VLA FIRST detection of stacked [[flux]] from 32 GPs and three 3-hour low frequency observations from the GMRT which targeted the three most promising candidates which had expected fluxes at the milli-[[Jansky]] (mJy) level.

Chakraborti et al. find that the three GPs observed by the GMRT have a magnetic field of B~39 μ[[Gauss (unit)|G]], and more generally a figure of greater than B~30μG for all the GPs. This is compared to a figure of B~5μG for the [[Milky Way]].&lt;ref name=RadioDetection/&gt; The present understanding is of [[magnetic field]] growth based on the amplification of seed fields by [[dynamo theory]] and its action over a galaxy's lifetime.&lt;ref name=RadioDetection/&gt; The observations of GPs challenge that thinking.

Given the high star-forming rates of GPs generally, they are expected to host a large number of [[Supernova]]e. Supernovae accelerate electrons to high energies, near to the speed of light, which may then emit [[synchrotron radiation]] in [[radio spectrum]] frequencies.

A '''Road Weather Information System''' ('''RWIS''') comprises [[automatic weather station]]s (technically referred to as Environmental Sensor Stations (ESS)) in the field, a communication system for data transfer, and central systems to collect field data from numerous ESS. These stations measure real-time atmospheric parameters, pavement conditions, water level conditions, and visibility. Central RWIS hardware and software are used to process observations from ESS to develop [[Nowcasting (meteorology)|nowcasts]] or [[Weather forecasting|forecasts]], and display or disseminate road weather information in a format that can be easily interpreted by a manager. RWIS data are used by road operators and maintainers to support decision making.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/weather/faq.htm US FHWA Road Weather Management FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt; Real-time RWIS data is also used by [[Automatic Warning System|Automated Warning System]]s (AWS). The spatial and temporal resolution can be that of a [[mesonet]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6284">'''Scanning confocal electron microscopy''' ('''SCEM''') is an [[electron microscopy]] technique analogous to [[confocal microscopy|scanning confocal optical microscopy]] (SCOM). In this technique, the studied sample is illuminated by a focussed electron beam, as in other scanning microscopy techniques, such as [[scanning transmission electron microscopy]] or [[scanning electron microscopy]]. However, in SCEM, the collection optics is arranged symmetrically to the illumination optics to gather only the electrons that pass the beam focus. This results in superior depth resolution of the imaging. The technique is relatively new and is being actively developed.

== History ==

The idea of SCEM logically follows from SCOM and thus is rather old. However, practical design and construction of scanning confocal electron microscope is a complex problem first solved by [[Nestor J. Zaluzec]].&lt;ref&gt;Zaluzec, N.J. (2003) "Scanning confocal electron microscope" {{US Patent |6548810}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author = Zaluzec, N.J. |title = The Scanning Confocal Electron Microscope| journal = Microsc.

Several groups are currently working on construction of atomic resolution SCEM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.materials.ox.ac.uk/peoplepages/nellist.html| title =Dr. Peter Nellist| work=materials.ox.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, atomically resolved SCEM images have already been obtained &lt;ref name=stage&gt;{{cite journal| title =Development of Stage-scanning System for Confocal Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy| journal= E-J.

== Operation==
[[Image:SCEM.JPG|thumb|250px|Schematic of SCEM]]
The sample is illuminated by a focused electron beam, and the beam is re-focused on the detector, thus collecting only electrons passing through the focus. In order to produce an image, the beam should be laterally scanned. In the original design, this was achieved by placing synchronized scanning and descanning deflectors. Such design is complex and only a few custom-built setups exist. Another approach is to use stationary illumination and collection, but perform scan by moving the sample with a high-precision piezo-controlled holder. Such holders are readily available and can fit into most commercial electron microscopes thereby realizing the SCEM mode. As a practical demonstration, atomically resolved SCEM images have been recorded.&lt;ref name=stage/&gt;&lt;ref name=stage2/&gt;

== Advantages of SCEM ==
High energies of incident particles (200 keV electrons vs. 2 eV photons) result in much higher [[Angular resolution|spatial resolution]] of SCEM as compared to SCOM (lateral resolution &lt;1&amp;nbsp;nm vs. &gt;400&amp;nbsp;nm).

As compared to conventional [[electron microscopy]] ([[Transmission electron microscopy|TEM]], [[Scanning transmission electron microscopy|STEM]], [[Scanning electron microscope|SEM]]), SCEM offers 3-dimensional imaging. 3D imaging in SCEM was expected from the confocal geometry of SCEM, and it has recently been confirmed by theoretical modeling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title = Bloch wave-based calculation of imaging properties of high-resolution scanning confocal electron microscopy| doi =10.1016/j.ultramic.2008.04.005|journal =Ultramicroscopy| pmid = 18519159|volume =108| issue = 9|year =2008| pages = 981–8| author1 =Mitsuishi| first1 =K| last2 =Iakoubovskii| first2 =K| last3 =Takeguchi| first3 =M| last4 =Shimojo| first4 =M| last5 =Hashimoto| first5 =A| last6 =Furuya| first6 =K}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, it is predicted that a heavy layer (gold) can be identified in light matrix (aluminum) with ~10&amp;nbsp;nm precision in depth; this depth resolution is limited by the convergence angle of the electron beam and could be improved to a few nanometers in next-generation electron microscopes equipped with two fifth-order [[spherical aberration]] correctors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title =Confocal operation of a transmission electron microscope with two aberration correctors|journal = Appl.

A '''scientific instrument''' is, broadly speaking, a device or tool used for scientific purposes, including the study of both natural phenomena and theoretical research.&lt;ref name="HackmannReaders13"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1wJeAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA676&amp;lpg=PA675 |chapter=Scientific instruments |title=Reader's Guide to the History of Science |author=Hackmann, W. |editor=Hessenbruck, A. |publisher=Routledge |year=2013 |pages=675–77 |isbn=9781134263011 |accessdate=18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Historically, the definition of a scientific instrument has varied, based on usage, laws, and historical time period.&lt;ref name="HackmannReaders13" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FR71USvsPresb"&gt;{{cite journal |title=United States v. Presbyterian Hospital |journal=The Federal Reporter |volume=71 |pages=866–868 |year=1896 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nyc4AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA866}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the mid-nineteenth century such tools were referred to as "natural philosophical" or "philosophical" apparatus and instruments, and older tools from antiquity to the Middle Ages (such as the astrolabe and pendulum clock) defy a more modern definition of "a tool developed to investigate nature qualitatively or quantitatively."&lt;ref name="HackmannReaders13" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FR71USvsPresb" /&gt; Scientific instruments were made by instrument makers living near a center of learning or research, such as a university or research [[laboratory]]. Instrument makers designed, constructed, and refined instruments for specific purposes, but if demand was sufficient, an instrument would go into production as a commercial product.&lt;ref name="TurnerEarly87"&gt;{{cite book |title=Early Scientific Instruments: Europe, 1400-1800 |author=Turner, A.J. |publisher=Phillip Wilson Publishers |year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BediniEarly64"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39141 |title=Early American Scientific Instruments and Their Makers |author=Bedini, S.A. |publisher=Smithsonian Institution |year=1964 |accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By World War II, the demand for improved analyses of wartime products such as medicines, fuels, and weaponized agents pushed instrumentation to new heights.&lt;ref name="MukhopadhyayTheRise08"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Rise of Instruments during World War II |journal=Analytical Chemistry |author=Mukhopadhyay, R. |volume=80 |issue=15 |pages=5684–5691 |year=2008 |doi=10.1021/ac801205u|pmid=18671339 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, changes to instruments used in scientific endeavors — particularly analytical instruments — are occurring rapidly, with interconnections to computers and data management systems becoming increasingly necessary.&lt;ref name="McMahonAnal07"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4paUE12Hw0UC&amp;pg=PA1 |chapter=Chapter 1: Introduction |title=Analytical Instrumentation: A Guide to Laboratory, Portable and Miniaturized Instruments |author=McMahon, G. |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=2007 |pages=1–6 |isbn=9780470518557 |accessdate=18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KhandpurHandbook15"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yUp_CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT43 |chapter=Chapter 1: Fundamentals of Analytical Instruments |title=Handbook of Analytical Instruments |author=Khandpur, R.S. |publisher=McGraw Hill Education |year=2016 |isbn=9789339221362 |accessdate=18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope==
Scientific instruments vary greatly in size, shape, purpose, complication and complexity. This includes relatively simple [[laboratory equipment]] like [[weighing scale|scales]], [[ruler]]s, [[Chronometer watch|chronometer]]s, [[thermometer]]s, etc. Other simple tools developed in late 20th century or early 21st century are [[Foldscope]] (an optical microscope), KAS Periodic Table (SCALE),&lt;ref name=ShadabKAS17&gt;{{cite journal|title=KAS PERIODIC TABLE|journal=International Research Journal of Natural and Applied Sciences|author=Shadab, K.A.|volume=4|issue=7|pages=221–261|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; MasSpec Pen (pen that detects cancer), [[glucose meter]], etc. However, some scientific instruments can be quite large in size and significant in complexity, like [[particle collider]]s or [[radio-telescope]] antennas. Conversely [[Micrometre|microscale]] and [[Nanoscopic scale|nanoscale]] technologies are advancing to the point where instrument sizes are shifting towards the tiny, including nanoscale [[surgical instrument]]s, biological [[Nanorobotics|nanobots]], and [[bioelectronics]].&lt;ref name="OsianderMicro16"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tWPRBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA141 |chapter=Chapter 6: Micro Electro Mechanical Systems: Systems Engineering's Transition into the Nanoworld |title=Systems Engineering for Microscale and Nanoscale Technologies |author=Osiander, R. |editor1=Darrin, M.A.G.|editor2=Barth, J.L. |publisher=CRC Press |pages=137–172 |year=2016 |isbn=9781439837351 |accessdate=18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JamesNeuron15"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FgWhCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA227 |chapter=Chapter 21: Neuron Based Surgery: Are We There Yet?

==The digital era==
Instruments are increasingly based upon [[system     фсем   привет   ntegration|integration]] with [[computer]]s to improve and simplify control; enhance and extend instrumental functions, conditions, and parameter adjustments; and streamline data sampling, collection, resolution, analysis (both during and post-process), and storage and retrieval. Advanced instruments can be connected as a [[local area network]] (LAN) directly of via [[middleware]] and can be further integrated as part of an [[information management]] application such as a [[laboratory information management system]] (LIMS).&lt;ref name="WilkesIntegration94"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Integration of instruments and a laboratory information management system at the information level: An inductively coupled plasma spectrometer |journal=Chemometrics and Intelligent Laboratory Systems |author1=Wilkes, R.|author2=Megargle, R. |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=47–54 |year=1994 |doi=10.1016/0169-7439(94)90018-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CarvalhoIntegration13"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Integration of Analytical Instruments with Computer Scripting |journal=Journal of Laboratory Automation |author=Carvalho, M.C. |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=328–33 |year=2013 |doi=10.1177/2211068213476288|pmid=23413273 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Instrument connectivity can be furthered even more using [[internet of things]] (IoT) technologies, allowing for example laboratories separated by great distances to connect their instruments to a network that can be monitored from a workstation or mobile device elsewhere.&lt;ref name="PerkelTheInternet17"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.nature.com/news/the-internet-of-things-comes-to-the-lab-1.21383 |title=The Internet of Things comes to the lab |journal=Nature |author=Perkel, J.M. |volume=542 |issue=7639 |pages=125–126 |year=2017 |doi=10.1038/542125a|pmid=28150787 |bibcode=2017Natur.542..125P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Summer Science Program''' ('''SSP''') is an academic summer program where high school students experience college-level education and do research in [[celestial mechanics]] by studying the orbits of [[asteroid]]s or [[biochemistry]] by studying the kinetic properties of [[enzymes]]. The program was established in 1959 at [[The Thacher School]] in [[Ojai, California]]. It now takes place on two astrophysics campuses, [[New Mexico Tech]] in [[Socorro, New Mexico]] and [[University of Colorado, Boulder]] in [[Boulder, Colorado]], and one biochemistry campus, [[Purdue University]] in [[West Lafayette, Indiana]].

In the Astrophysics program, each team takes a series of images of a near-earth asteroid, then writes software to calculate its orbit and predict its future path. In the Biochemistry program, each team isolates and models an enzyme from a fungal crop pathogen, then designs a molecule to inhibit that enzyme.  

==Overview==
Each Summer Science Program campus hosts 36 participants and 7 faculty for 39 days. Faculty have integrated academic and residential roles. The participant experience is designed to be similar at all campuses. For the research, participants are organized into teams of three. The schedule includes classroom time, lab time, field trips (scientific and recreational) and guest lectures from working scientists and other professionals.&lt;ref name=SkyTel&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.summerscience.org/downloads/SkyTel.pdf |publisher=Sky &amp; Telescope |last=Furutani |first=Tracy |title=Asteroids, Teenagers, and Real Science |date=March 2001 |accessdate=December 24, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110617120910/http://www.summerscience.org/downloads/SkyTel.pdf |archivedate=June 17, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Past guest speakers have included [[Maarten Schmidt]], who has done pioneering work in quasars; [[Richard Feynman]], a Nobel laureate in physics; [[James Randi]], magician and debunker of pseudoscience; [[Mitch Kapor]], founder of [[Lotus Development]]; [[Paul MacCready]], creator of the [[Gossamer Condor]] and [[Gossamer Albatross]]; and [[Eric Allin Cornell]], a Nobel laureate in physics.

The application process and admission criteria are similar to that of selective colleges. Primarily juniors (rising seniors) are admitted, with a few sophomores each year. There is a program fee, inclusive of tuition, room &amp; board, and supplies. Need-based financial aid grants are available to cover part or all of the fee, with SSP guaranteeing to meet all demonstrated need. Donations to the nonprofit fund financial aid.

In 1991, the National Academies' Commission on Physical Sciences, Mathematics, and Applications observed that "All participants go on to college. About 37 percent of the pre-1985 graduates are now working in science and medicine, and 34 percent in engineering, mathematics, and computer science (including the [[Mitch Kapor|founder]] of [[Lotus Development Corporation]])."&lt;ref name="CPS"&gt;{{cite web

==History==
The program was established in 1959 at [[The Thacher School]] in [[Ojai, California]], as a response to the launch of [[Sputnik 1]] and the start of the [[Space Race]]. The Headmaster at Thacher was concerned that the country's top high school students were not being adequately informed and inspired about careers in the physical sciences. He decided to create an intense summer program to challenge such students and give them a taste of "doing real science," with assistance from Caltech, [[UCLA]], [[Claremont Colleges]], and [[Stanford]]. Financial support came from [[Hughes Aircraft]].&lt;ref name=SkyTel /&gt;&lt;ref name=FirstSSP /&gt;

The first SSP was led by Dr. Paul Routly and Dr. Foster Strong. In 1960, Dr. [[George O. Abell|George Abell]] joined the program for his first of more than 20 summers at SSP.&lt;ref name=SkyTel /&gt;

The first year, SSP had 26 students. The students used data from the "''Russian ephemeris''" (''Ephemyeredi Mahlikh Planyet'') to find asteroids to photograph, measured the positions, and submitted the data to the [[Minor Planet Center]] at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. The students were excited to find that when they calculated the orbit of [[9 Metis]], their data resulted in a significant correction to the Russian ephemeris.&lt;ref name=FirstSSP&gt;{{cite news

Women were admitted starting in 1969, and reached 50% of enrollment in 2010.

After 41 summers at Thacher, a significant threat to the continuation of SSP came in 2000, when Thacher School decided to use its entire campus for a different purpose.&lt;ref name="SkyTel" /&gt; SSP alumni incorporated Summer Science Program, Inc., solicited funding largely from the alumni community, and found a new host campus. Beginning in 2000, SSP was held at the Happy Valley School, located just across the Ojai Valley from The Thacher School.  In 2007, Happy Valley School was renamed [[Besant Hill School]].&lt;ref name="SkyTel" /&gt;

With the alumni rescue complete, they soon began looking to expand the program. In 2003 a second campus opened at New Mexico Tech in Socorro with the support of New Mexico Tech, [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]] and [[Sandia National Laboratory|Sandia]] national laboratories, and others.&lt;ref name=NMTpr&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nmt.edu/news/all-news/98-2003/2578-17june04g |title=New Mexico Tech News |publisher=New Mexico Tech |date=June 17, 2004 |accessdate=November 29, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528061126/http://www.nmt.edu/news/all-news/98-2003/2578-17june04g |archive-date=May 28, 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the California campus moved to [[Westmont College]] in [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]], then in 2015 to [[University of Colorado Boulder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In 2016, following three years of planning and preparation, a pilot of the first SSP in Biochemistry was held at [[Purdue University]] in West Lafayette, Indiana. Six alumni from the previous summer successfully ran through the new experiment. In 2017, the first SSP in Biochemistry was successfully held with 24 participants.  

Through 2017, over 2,500 participants have attended 75 programs. All alumni and former faculty are "members" of the nonprofit for life, along with other members named by the Board. The Members elect Trustees annually, have access to an online database for networking, and are invited to an Annual Dinner held each fall. 

==Astronomical work==
[[Image:AsteroidLaetitia(best).jpg|thumb|250|right|Example of an [[astrograph]]ic plate taken at SSP, in this case showing [[39 Laetitia]] (circled in blue). Reference stars are also circled.]]
For the first 50 years of the program, students took photographic images of [[main-belt asteroid]]s (between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter). Starting in 2009 students took digital images of (much fainter) [[near-Earth asteroid]]s (inside the orbit of Mars). The process of orbit determination is conceptually the same in both cases. First students take a series of images of asteroids. After identifying the asteroid, its position on the image relative to known stars is carefully calculated. That relative position is then used to determine the position of the asteroid in celestial coordinates ([[right ascension]] and [[declination]]) at the exact time the image was taken. The series of positions as the asteroid moves across the sky allows the student to fit an approximate orbit to the asteroid. The measured asteroid coordinates (not the calculated [[orbital elements]]) are submitted to the [[Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics]].

Over the decades SSP students have done their orbit determination calculations on mechanical calculators (1960s), then electronic calculators (1970s), then "mini-computers" (1980s), then personal computers (1990s and 2000s). In recent years they write their orbit determination programs in the [[Python (programming language)|Python programming language]], employing the [[Orbit determination|Gaussian method]].

'''The Lattice Project''' was once a distributed computing project that combined [[computing resource]]s, Grid middleware, specialized scientific application software and web services into a comprehensive [[Grid computing]] system for scientific analysis. It ran the Genetic Algorithm for Rapid Likelihood Inference (GARLI) software to determine the relationships between different genetic samples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://cmns.umd.edu/news-events/features/2243 | title=UMD-led Public Computational Biology Web Service Gains Popularity | first=Michael | last=Cummings | date=June 16, 2014 | access-date=September 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major aspect of the project makes use of the [[Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing]] ([[BOINC]]) platform.  The Lattice Project maintained a separate [https://web.archive.org/web/20120113084237/http://boinc.umiacs.umd.edu/ BOINC web site], but the site is dead as of this writing, causing this project to shut down because BOINC depends on this website to get setup information to set this project up on its clients.
