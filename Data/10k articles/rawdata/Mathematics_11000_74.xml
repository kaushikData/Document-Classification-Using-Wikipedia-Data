'''101''' ('''one hundred [and] one''') is the [[natural number]] following [[100 (number)|100]] and preceding [[102 (number)|102]].

It is variously pronounced "one hundred and one" / "a hundred and one", "one hundred one" / "a hundred one", and "one oh one". As an [[Ordinal number (linguistics)|ordinal number]], 101st (one hundred [and] first), rather than 101th, is the correct form.

==In mathematics==
'''101''' is:
*the 26th [[prime number]].
*a [[palindromic number]] in base 10, and so a [[palindromic prime]].
*a [[Chen prime]] since [[103 (number)|103]] is also prime, with which it makes a [[twin prime]] pair.
*a [[Sexy prime]] since 107 and 113 are also prime, with which it makes a sexy prime triplet.
*a [[unique prime]], because the period length of its reciprocal is unique among primes.
*an [[Eisenstein prime]] with no [[imaginary part]] and [[real part]] of the form &lt;math&gt;3n - 1&lt;/math&gt;.
*the sum of five consecutive primes ([[13 (number)|13]] + [[17 (number)|17]] + [[19 (number)|19]] + [[23 (number)|23]] + [[29 (number)|29]]).
*the fifth [[alternating factorial]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A005165|title=Sloane's A005165 : Alternating factorials|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*a [[centered decagonal number]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A062786|title=Sloane's A062786 : Centered 10-gonal numbers|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given 101, the [[Mertens function]] returns [[0 (number)|0]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A028442|title=Sloane's A028442 : Numbers n such that Mertens' function is zero|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the second prime having this property.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A100669|title=Sloane's A100669 : Zeros of the Mertens function that are also prime|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a 3-digit number in base 10, this number has a relatively simple [[divisibility rule|divisibility test]]. The candidate number is split into groups of four, starting with the rightmost four, and added up to produce a 4-digit number. If this 4-digit number is of the form 1000''a'' + 100''b'' + 10''a'' + ''b'' (where ''a'' and ''b'' are integers from 0 to 9), such as 3232 or 9797, or of the form 100''b'' + ''b'', such as 707 and 808, then the number is divisible by 101.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Stupid Divisibility Tricks 101 Ways to Stupefy Your Friends|first=Marc|last=Renault|journal=Math Horizons|volume=14|issue=2|date=November 2006|pages=18–21, 42|jstor=25678653}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the [[seven-segment display]] of a calculator, 101 is both a [[strobogrammatic prime]] and a [[dihedral prime]].

==In science==
* In [[mineralogy]], a [[Miller index]] of 101 is a crystal face that crosses the horizontal axis (a) and 3d vertical axis (c) but does not cross the 2d vertical axis (b).
* In physics and chemistry, it is the [[atomic number]] of [[mendelevium]], an actinide.
* In astronomy it is the Messier designation given to the [[Pinwheel Galaxy]] in Ursa Major.

==In books==
According to [[Books in Print]], more books are now published with a title that begins with '101' than '100'. They usually describe or discuss a list of items, such as ''101 Ways to...'' or ''101 Questions and Answers About...'' . This marketing tool is used to imply that the customer is given a little extra information beyond books that include only 100 items. Some books have taken this marketing scheme even further with titles that begin with '102', '103', or '1001'. The number is used in this context as a [[slang]] term when referring to "a 101 document" what is usually referred to as a [[statistical survey]] or overview of some topic.

[[Room 101]] is a torture chamber in the novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' by [[George Orwell]].

Creative Writing 101 by [[Raymond Carver]], "A writer's values and craft.  This was what the man (John Gardner) taught and what he stood for, and this is what I've kept by me in the years since that brief but all important time."

==In education==
{{ seealso |101 (topic)}}

In American university course numbering systems, the number 101 is often used for an introductory course at a beginner's level in a department's subject area. This common numbering system was designed to make [[articulation (education)|transfer between colleges]] easier. In theory, any numbered course in one [[academic institution]] should bring a student to the same standard as a similarly numbered course at other institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Forest, J.J.F. (2002) ''Higher education in the United States: an encyclopedia'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=sFFX9OIkF2IC&amp;lpg=PA73&amp;dq=course%20numbering%20systems&amp;pg=PA73#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.73.] ABC-CLIO. {{ISBN|1-57607-248-7}}. Retrieved October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The term was first introduced by the [[University of Buffalo]] in 1929.&lt;ref name="Slate"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Engber|first1=Daniel|title=101 101|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2006/09/101_101.html|website=Slate|accessdate=9 May 2017|date=6 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on this usage, the term "[[wikt:101|101]]" has been extended to mean an introductory level of [[learning]] or a collection of introductory materials to a topic.

'''129''' ('''one hundred [and] twenty-nine''') is the [[natural number]] following [[128 (number)|128]] and preceding [[130 (number)|130]].

==In mathematics==
129 is the sum of the first ten [[prime numbers]]. It is the smallest number that can be expressed as a sum of three squares in four different ways: &lt;math&gt;11^2+2^2+2^2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;10^2+5^2+2^2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;8^2+8^2+1^2&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;8^2+7^2+4^2&lt;/math&gt;.

129 is the product of only two primes, 3 and 43, making 129 a [[semiprime]]. Since 3 and 43 are both [[Gaussian prime]]s, this means that 129 is a [[Blum integer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A016105|title=Sloane's A016105 : Blum integers|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

129 is a [[repdigit]] in base 6 (333).

129 is a [[happy number]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A007770|title=Sloane's A007770 : Happy numbers|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Native language of the application is Spanish but an English version is also available.

An additional free statistical package, GenAlEx,&lt;ref&gt;Peakall, R. and Smouse P.E. (2012) GenAlEx 6.5: genetic analysis in Excel. Population genetic software for teaching and research-an update. Bioinformatics 28, 2537-2539.&lt;/ref&gt; is geared toward teaching as well as research and allows for complex genetic analyses to be employed and compared within the commonly used Microsoft Excel interface.  This software allows for calculation of analyses such as AMOVA, as well as comparisons with other types of closely related statistics including F-statistics and Shannon's index, and more.

'''Axiomatic semantics''' is an approach based on [[mathematical logic]] for proving the [[correctness of computer programs]]. It is closely related to [[Hoare logic]].

Axiomatic semantics define the meaning of a command in a program by describing its effect on assertions about the program state. The assertions are logical statements—predicates with variables, where the variables define the state of the program.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8618">In [[modular arithmetic]], '''Barrett reduction''' is a reduction [[algorithm]] introduced in 1986 by P.D. Barrett.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Barrett | first1 = P. | chapter = Implementing the Rivest Shamir and Adleman Public Key Encryption Algorithm on a Standard Digital Signal Processor | doi = 10.1007/3-540-47721-7_24 | title = Advances in Cryptology — CRYPTO' 86 | series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science | volume = 263 | pages = 311–323 | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-3-540-18047-0 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; A naive way of computing

:&lt;math&gt;c = a \,\bmod\, n. \, &lt;/math&gt;

would be to use a fast [[division algorithm]].  Barrett reduction is an algorithm designed to optimize this operation assuming &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is constant, and &lt;math&gt;a&lt;n^2&lt;/math&gt;, replacing divisions by multiplications.

== General idea ==

Let &lt;math&gt;s=1/n&lt;/math&gt; be the inverse of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; as a [[floating point]] number. Then

:&lt;math&gt;a \,\bmod\, n = a-\lfloor a s\rfloor n &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\lfloor x \rfloor&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[floor function]]. The result is exact, as long as &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; is computed with sufficient accuracy.

== Single-word Barrett reduction ==

Barrett initially considered an integer version of the above algorithm when the values fit into machine words.

When calculating &lt;math&gt;a \,\bmod\, n&lt;/math&gt; using the method above, but with integers, the obvious analogue would be to use division by &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="go"&gt;
func reduce(a uint) uint {
  q := a / n  // Division implicitly returns the floor of the result.
  return a - q * n
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

However, division can be expensive and, in cryptographic settings, may not be a constant-time instruction on some CPUs. Thus Barrett reduction approximates &lt;math&gt;1/n&lt;/math&gt; with a value &lt;math&gt;m/2^k&lt;/math&gt; because division by &lt;math&gt;2^k&lt;/math&gt; is just a right-shift and so is cheap.

In order to calculate the best value for &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; given &lt;math&gt;2^k&lt;/math&gt; consider:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{n} = \frac{{2^k}/{n}}{n(\frac{2^k}{n})} = \frac{{2^k}/{n}}{2^k} = \frac{m}{2^k}&lt;/math&gt;

In order for &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; to be an integer, we need to round &lt;math&gt;{2^k}/{n}&lt;/math&gt; somehow. Rounding to the nearest integer will give the best approximation but can result in &lt;math&gt;m/2^k&lt;/math&gt; being larger than &lt;math&gt;1/n&lt;/math&gt;, which can cause underflows. Thus &lt;math&gt;m = \lfloor {2^k}/{n} \rfloor&lt;/math&gt; is generally used.

Thus we can approximate the function above with:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="go"&gt;
func reduce(a uint) uint {
  q := (a * m) &gt;&gt; k // "&gt;&gt; k" denotes bitshift by k.
  return a - q * n
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

However, since &lt;math&gt;m/2^k \le 1/n&lt;/math&gt;, the value of &lt;code&gt;q&lt;/code&gt; in that function can end up being one too small, and thus &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; is only guaranteed to be within &lt;math&gt;[0, 2n)&lt;/math&gt; rather than &lt;math&gt;[0, n)&lt;/math&gt; as is generally required. A conditional subtraction will correct this:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="go"&gt;
func reduce(a uint) uint {
  q := (a * m) &gt;&gt; k
  a -= q * n
  if n &lt;= a {
    a -= n
  }
  return a
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt;m/2^k&lt;/math&gt; is only an approximation, the valid range of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; needs to be considered. The error of the approximation of &lt;math&gt;1/n&lt;/math&gt; is:

:&lt;math&gt;e = \frac{1}{n} - \frac{m}{2^k}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus the error in the value of &lt;code&gt;q&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;math&gt;ae&lt;/math&gt;. As long as &lt;math&gt;ae &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt; then the reduction is valid thus &lt;math&gt;a &lt; 1/e&lt;/math&gt;. The reduction function might not immediately give the wrong answer when &lt;math&gt;a \ge 1/e&lt;/math&gt; but the bounds on &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; must be respected to ensure the correct answer in the general case.

By choosing larger values of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, the range of values of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; for which the reduction is valid can be increased, but larger values of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; may cause overflow problems elsewhere.

=== Example ===

Consider the case of &lt;math&gt;n = 101&lt;/math&gt; when operating with 16-bit integers.

The smallest value of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; that makes sense is &lt;math&gt;k = 7&lt;/math&gt; because if &lt;math&gt;2^k &lt; n&lt;/math&gt; then the reduction will only be valid for values that are already minimal! For a value of seven, &lt;math&gt;m = \lfloor 2^k / n \rfloor = \lfloor 128 / 101 \rfloor = 1&lt;/math&gt;. For a value of eight &lt;math&gt;m = \lfloor 256 / 101 \rfloor = 2&lt;/math&gt;. Thus &lt;math&gt;k = 8&lt;/math&gt; provides no advantage because the approximation of &lt;math&gt;1/101&lt;/math&gt; in that case (&lt;math&gt;2/256&lt;/math&gt;) is exactly the same as &lt;math&gt;1/128&lt;/math&gt;. For &lt;math&gt;k = 9&lt;/math&gt;, we get &lt;math&gt;m = 512 / 101 = 5&lt;/math&gt;, which is a better approximation.

Now we consider the valid input ranges for &lt;math&gt;k = 7&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k = 9&lt;/math&gt;. In the first case, &lt;math&gt;e = 1/n - m/2^k = 1/101 - 1/128 = 27/12928&lt;/math&gt; so &lt;math&gt;a &lt; 1/e&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;a &lt; 478.81&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is an integer, effectively the maximum value is 478. (In practice the function happens to work for values up to 504.)

If we take &lt;math&gt;k = 9&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;e = 1/101 - 5/512 = 7/51712&lt;/math&gt; and so the maximum value of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is 7387. (In practice the function happens to work until 7473.)

The next value of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; that results in a better approximation is 13, giving &lt;math&gt;81/8192&lt;/math&gt;. However, note that the intermediate value &lt;math&gt;ax&lt;/math&gt; in the calculation will then overflow an unsigned 16-bit value when &lt;math&gt;810 \le a&lt;/math&gt;, thus &lt;math&gt;k = 7&lt;/math&gt; works better in this situation.

=== Proof for range for a specific k ===

Let &lt;math&gt;k_0&lt;/math&gt; be the smallest integer such that &lt;math&gt;2^{k_0}&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. Take &lt;math&gt;k_0+1&lt;/math&gt; as a reasonable value for &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; in the above equations. As in the code snippets above, let

* &lt;math&gt;q = \left\lfloor \frac{m a}{2^k} \right\rfloor &lt;/math&gt; and
* &lt;math&gt;r = a - q n&lt;/math&gt;.

Because of the [[floor function]], &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is an integer and &lt;math&gt;r \equiv a \pmod{n}&lt;/math&gt;. Also, if &lt;math&gt;a &lt; 2 ^ k&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;r &lt; 2n&lt;/math&gt;. In that case, writing the snippets above as an expression:
:&lt;math&gt;a \,\bmod\, n = \begin{cases} r &amp; \text{if } r&lt;n \\ r-n &amp; \text{otherwise} \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

The proof that &lt;math&gt;r &lt; 2n&lt;/math&gt; follows:

If &lt;math&gt;a &lt; 2 ^ k&lt;/math&gt;, then
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{2 ^ k} \cdot (2 ^ k \mod n) &lt; n&lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt;n\cdot\frac{m a \mod 2^k}{2^k} &lt; n&lt;/math&gt; regardless of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, it follows that
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{a\cdot (2 ^ k \mod n)}{2 ^ k} + n\cdot\frac{m a \mod 2^k}{2^k} &lt; 2n&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; a  - \left(a - \frac{a\cdot (2 ^ k \mod n)}{2 ^ k}\right) + \frac{(n \cdot  (m a \mod 2^k))}{2^k} &lt; 2n&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; a  - \left(\left\lfloor\frac{2 ^ k}{n}\right\rfloor \cdot \frac{n a}{2 ^ k}\right) + \frac{(n \cdot  (m a \mod 2^k))}{2^k} &lt; 2n&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; a  - \frac{m n a}{2 ^ k} + \frac{(n \cdot  (m a \mod 2^k))}{2^k} &lt; 2n&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; a  - \left(\frac{m a - (m a \mod 2^k)}{2^k}\right)\cdot n &lt; 2n&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; a  - \left\lfloor\frac{m a}{2 ^ k}\right\rfloor\cdot n &lt; 2n&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;r &lt; 2n&lt;/math&gt;

== Multi-word Barrett reduction ==

Barrett's primary motivation for considering reduction was the implementation of [[RSA (cryptosystem)|RSA]], where the values in question will almost certainly exceed the size of a machine word. In this situation, Barrett provided an algorithm that approximates the single-word version above but for multi-word values. For details see section 14.3.3 of the Handbook of Applied Cryptography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Alfred | last1 = Menezes | first2 = Paul | last2 = Oorschot | first3 = Scott | last3 = Vanstone | title = Handbook of Applied Cryptography | isbn = 0-8493-8523-7 | url = http://cacr.uwaterloo.ca/hac/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3696">In [[set theory]], the concept of [[cardinality]] is significantly developable without recourse to actually defining [[cardinal numbers]] as objects in the theory itself (this is in fact a viewpoint taken by [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]]; [[Frege cardinal]]s are basically [[equivalence class]]es on the entire [[universe (mathematics)|universe]] of sets, by [[equinumerous|equinumerosity]]). The concepts are developed by defining [[equinumerous|equinumerosity]] in terms of functions and the concepts of [[injective function|one-to-one]] and [[surjective function|onto]] (injectivity and surjectivity); this gives us a [[preorder|pseudo-ordering]] relation

:&lt;math&gt;A \leq_c B\quad \iff\quad (\exists f)(f : A \to B\ \mathrm{is\ injective})&lt;/math&gt;

on the whole universe by size. It is not a true partial ordering because [[antisymmetric relation|antisymmetry]] need not hold: if both &lt;math&gt;A \leq_c B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B \leq_c A&lt;/math&gt;, it is true by the [[Cantor–Bernstein–Schroeder theorem]] that &lt;math&gt;A =_c B&lt;/math&gt; i.e. ''A'' and ''B'' are equinumerous, but they do not have to be literally equal (see [[isomorphism]]). That at least one of &lt;math&gt;A \leq_c B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B \leq_c A&lt;/math&gt; holds turns out to be equivalent to the [[axiom of choice]].

Nevertheless, most of the ''interesting'' results on cardinality and its arithmetic can be expressed merely with =&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;.

The goal of a '''cardinal assignment''' is to assign to every set ''A'' a specific, unique set that is only dependent on the cardinality of ''A''. This is in accordance with [[Georg Cantor|Cantor]]'s original vision of a cardinals: to take a set and abstract its elements into canonical "units" and collect these units into another set, such that the only thing special about this set is its size. These would be totally ordered by the relation &lt;math&gt;\leq_c&lt;/math&gt; and =&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; would be true equality. As Y. N. Moschovakis says, however, this is mostly an exercise in mathematical elegance, and you don't gain much unless you are "allergic to subscripts." However, there are various valuable applications of "real" cardinal numbers in various [[model theory|models]] of set theory.

In modern set theory, we usually use the [[Von Neumann cardinal assignment]], which uses the theory of ordinal numbers and the full power of the axioms of [[Axiom of choice|choice]] and [[Axiom of replacement|replacement]]. Cardinal assignments do need the full axiom of choice, if we want a decent cardinal arithmetic and an assignment for ''all'' sets.

== Cardinal assignment without the axiom of choice ==

Formally, assuming the axiom of choice, the cardinality of a set ''X'' is the least ordinal α such that there is a bijection between ''X'' and α.  This definition is known as the [[von Neumann cardinal assignment]].  If the axiom of choice is not assumed we need to do something different.  The oldest definition of the cardinality of a set ''X'' (implicit in Cantor and explicit in Frege and [[Principia Mathematica]]) is as the set of all sets that are equinumerous with ''X'':  this does not work in [[ZFC]] or other related systems of [[axiomatic set theory]] because this collection is too large to be a set, but it does work in [[type theory]] and in [[New Foundations]] and related systems.  However, if we restrict from this class to those equinumerous with ''X'' that have the least [[rank (set theory)|rank]], then it will work (this is a trick due to [[Dana Scott]]:  it works because the collection of objects with any given rank is a set).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2149">In mathematics, the '''Chang number''' of an irreducible representation of a simple complex [[Lie algebra]] is its dimension modulo 1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''h'', where ''h'' is the [[Coxeter number]]. Chang numbers are named after {{harvtxt|Chang|1982}}, who rediscovered an element of order ''h''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 found by {{harvtxt|Kac|1981}}.

{{harvtxt|Kac|1981}} showed that there is a unique class of [[regular element (Lie theory)|regular element]]s σ of order ''h''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1, in the complex points of the corresponding [[Chevalley group]]. He showed that the trace of σ on an irreducible representation is &amp;minus;1, 0, or +1, and if ''h''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 is prime then the trace is congruent to the dimension mod ''h''+1.  This implies that the dimension of an irreducible representation is always &amp;minus;1, 0, or +1 mod&amp;nbsp;''h''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1  whenever ''h''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 is prime.

==Examples==
In particular, for the exceptional compact Lie groups [[G2 (mathematics)|''G''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], F4, E6, E7, and E8 the number ''h''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;= 7, 13, 13, 19, 31 is always prime, so the Chang number of an irreducible representation is always +1, 0, or &amp;minus;1.

For example, the first few irreducible representations of G2 (with Coxeter number ''h''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;6)  have dimensions 1, 7, 14, 27, 64, 77, 182, 189, 273, 286,...
These are congruent to 1, 0, 0, &amp;minus;1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, &amp;minus;1,... mod&amp;nbsp;7 =&amp;nbsp;''h''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12253">In [[wireless communication]]s, '''channel state information''' ('''CSI''') refers to known channel properties of a communication link. This information describes how a signal [[Multipath propagation|propagates]] from the transmitter to the receiver and represents the combined effect of, for example, [[scattering]], [[fading]], and power decay with distance. The method is called '''Channel estimation'''. The CSI makes it possible to adapt transmissions to current channel conditions, which is crucial for achieving [[bit error rate|reliable communication]] with high [[Bit rate|data rates]] in [[MIMO|multiantenna systems]].

CSI needs to be estimated at the receiver and usually [[quantization (signal processing)|quantized]] and [[feedback|fed back]] to the transmitter (although reverse-link estimation is possible in [[Time-division duplex|TDD]] systems). Therefore, the transmitter and receiver can have different CSI. The CSI at the transmitter and the CSI at the receiver are sometimes referred to as CSIT and CSIR, respectively.

== Different kinds of channel state information==

There are basically two levels of CSI, namely instantaneous CSI and statistical CSI.

'''Instantaneous CSI''' (or short-term CSI) means that the current channel conditions are known, which can be viewed as knowing the [[impulse response]] of a [[digital filter]]. This gives an opportunity to adapt the transmitted signal to the impulse response and thereby optimize the received signal for [[spatial multiplexing]] or to achieve low [[bit error rate]]s.

'''Statistical CSI''' (or long-term CSI) means that a statistical characterization of the channel is known. This description can include, for example, the type of [[Fading#Fading models|fading distribution]], the average channel gain, the [[Line-of-sight propagation|line-of-sight component]], and the [[Spatial Correlation|spatial correlation]]. As with instantaneous CSI, this information can be used for transmission optimization.

The CSI acquisition is practically limited by how fast the channel conditions are changing. In [[Fading#Slow versus fast fading|fast fading systems]] where channel conditions vary rapidly under the transmission of a single information symbol, only statistical CSI is reasonable. On the other hand, in [[Fading#Slow versus fast fading|slow fading systems]] instantaneous CSI can be estimated with reasonable accuracy and used for transmission adaptation for some time before being outdated.

In practical systems, the available CSI often lies in between these two levels; instantaneous CSI with some estimation/quantization error is combined with statistical information.

== Mathematical description ==

In a [[narrowband]] [[flat fading|flat-fading]] channel with multiple transmit and receive antennas ([[MIMO#Mathematical description|MIMO]]), the system is modeled as&lt;ref name=tulino/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{H}\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{n}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\mathbf{y}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; are the receive and transmit vectors, respectively, and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\mathbf{H}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\mathbf{n}&lt;/math&gt; are the channel matrix and the noise vector, respectively. The noise is often modeled as [[Complex normal distribution|circular symmetric complex normal]] with
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n} \sim \mathcal{CN}(\mathbf{0},\,\mathbf{S})&lt;/math&gt;
where the mean value is zero and the noise covariance matrix &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\mathbf{S}&lt;/math&gt; is known.

===Instantaneous CSI ===
Ideally, the channel matrix &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\mathbf{H}&lt;/math&gt; is known perfectly. Due to channel estimation errors, the channel information can be represented as&lt;ref name=bjornson/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{vec} (\mathbf{H}_{\textrm{estimate}}) \sim \mathcal{CN}(\mbox{vec}(\mathbf{H}),\,\mathbf{R}_{\textrm{error}})&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\mathbf{H}_{\textrm{estimate}}&lt;/math&gt; is the channel estimate and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\mathbf{R}_{\textrm{error}}&lt;/math&gt; is the estimation error covariance matrix. The [[Vectorization (mathematics)|vectorization]] &lt;math&gt;\mbox{vec}()&lt;/math&gt; was used to achieve the column stacking of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\mathbf{H}&lt;/math&gt;, as [[multivariate random variable]]s are usually defined as vectors.

=== Statistical CSI ===
In this case, the statistics of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\mathbf{H}&lt;/math&gt; are known. In a [[Rayleigh fading]] channel, this corresponds to knowing that&lt;ref name=kermoal/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{vec} (\mathbf{H}) \sim \mathcal{CN}(\mathbf{0},\,\mathbf{R})&lt;/math&gt;
for some known channel covariance matrix &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Estimation of CSI ==
Since the channel conditions vary, instantaneous CSI needs to be [[Estimation Theory|estimated]] on a short-term basis. A popular approach is so-called training sequence (or pilot sequence), where a known signal is transmitted and the channel matrix &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\mathbf{H}&lt;/math&gt; is estimated using the combined knowledge of the transmitted and received signal.

Let the training sequence be denoted &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{p}_1,\ldots,\mathbf{p}_N&lt;/math&gt;, where the vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p}_i&lt;/math&gt; is transmitted over the channel as
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}_i = \mathbf{H}\mathbf{p}_i + \mathbf{n}_i.&lt;/math&gt;
By combining the received training signals &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}_i&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;i=1,\ldots,N&lt;/math&gt;, the total training signalling becomes
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Y}=[\mathbf{y}_1,\ldots,\mathbf{y}_N] = \mathbf{H}\mathbf{P} + \mathbf{N}&lt;/math&gt;
with the training matrix &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathbf{P}=[\mathbf{p}_1,\ldots,\mathbf{p}_N]&lt;/math&gt; and the noise matrix &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathbf{N}=[\mathbf{n}_1,\ldots,\mathbf{n}_N]&lt;/math&gt;.

With this notation, channel estimation means that &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathbf{H}&lt;/math&gt; should be recovered from the knowledge of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathbf{Y}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathbf{P}&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Least-square estimation ===
If the channel and noise distributions are unknown, then the [[Least squares|least-square]] estimator (also known as the [[minimum-variance unbiased estimator]]) is&lt;ref name=biguesh/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{H}_{\textrm{LS-estimate}} = \mathbf{Y} \mathbf{P}^H(\mathbf{P} \mathbf{P}^H)^{-1} &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;()^H &lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[conjugate transpose]]. The estimation [[Mean squared error|Mean Square Error]] (MSE) is proportional to
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{tr} (\mathbf{P} \mathbf{P}^H)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{tr}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[Trace (linear algebra)|trace]]. The error is minimized when &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P} \mathbf{P}^H&lt;/math&gt; is a scaled [[identity matrix]]. This can only be achieved when &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is equal to (or larger than) the number of transmit antennas. The simplest example of an optimal training matrix is to select &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\mathbf{P}&lt;/math&gt; as a (scaled) identity matrix of the same size that the number of transmit antennas.

=== MMSE estimation ===
If the channel and noise distributions are known, then this [[A priori estimate|a priori]] information can be exploited to decrease the estimation error. This approach is known as [[Bayesian estimation]] and for Rayleigh fading channels it exploits that 
:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{vec} (\mathbf{H}) \sim \mathcal{CN}(0,\,\mathbf{R}), \quad \mbox{vec}(\mathbf{N}) \sim \mathcal{CN}(0,\,\mathbf{S}).&lt;/math&gt;

The [[MMSE estimator]] is the Bayesian counterpart to the least-square estimator and becomes&lt;ref name=bjornson/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{vec}(\mathbf{H}_{\textrm{MMSE-estimate}}) = \left(\mathbf{R}^{-1} + (\mathbf{P}^T \, \otimes\, \mathbf{I})^H \mathbf{S}^{-1} (\mathbf{P}^T \, \otimes\, \mathbf{I}) \right)^{-1} (\mathbf{P}^T \, \otimes\, \mathbf{I})^H \mathbf{S}^{-1} \mbox{vec}(\mathbf{Y}) &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[Kronecker product]] and the identity matrix &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathbf{I}&lt;/math&gt; has the dimension of the number of receive antennas. The estimation [[Mean squared error|Mean Square Error]] (MSE) is
:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{tr} \left(\mathbf{R}^{-1} + (\mathbf{P}^T \, \otimes\, \mathbf{I})^H \mathbf{S}^{-1} (\mathbf{P}^T \, \otimes\, \mathbf{I}) \right)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;
and is minimized by a training matrix &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathbf{P}&lt;/math&gt; that in general can only be derived through numerical optimization. But there exist heuristic solutions with good performance based on [[Water filling algorithm|waterfilling]]. As opposed to least-square estimation, the estimation error for [[Spatial Correlation|spatially correlated]] channels can be minimized even if &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is smaller than the number of transmit antennas.&lt;ref name=bjornson/&gt; Thus, MMSE estimation can both decrease the estimation error and shorten the required training sequence. It needs however additionally the knowledge of the channel correlation matrix &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt; and noise correlation matrix &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\mathbf{S}&lt;/math&gt;. In absence of an accurate knowledge of these correlation matrices, robust choices need to be made to avoid MSE degradation.&lt;ref name=yeli/&gt;&lt;ref name=nisar/&gt;

== Data-aided versus blind estimation ==
In a data-aided approach, the channel estimation is based on some known data, which is known both at the [[transmitter]] and at the [[radio receiver|receiver]], such as training sequences or pilot data.&lt;ref name=Zhuang2000/&gt; In a blind approach, the estimation is based only on the received data, without any known transmitted sequence. The [[tradeoff]] is the accuracy versus the overhead. A data-aided approach requires more [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] or it has a higher [[overhead information|overhead]] than a blind approach, but it can achieve a better channel estimation [[accuracy]] than a blind estimator.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19715">'''Chemical reaction network theory''' is an area of [[applied mathematics]] that attempts to [[mathematical model|model]] the behaviour of real world [[chemistry|chemical]] systems. Since its foundation in the 1960s, it has attracted a growing research community, mainly due to its applications in [[biochemistry]] and [[theoretical chemistry]]. It has also attracted interest from [[pure mathematics|pure mathematicians]] due to the interesting problems that arise from the [[mathematical structure]]s involved.

== History ==

Dynamical properties of reaction networks were studied in chemistry and physics after invention of the [[law of mass action]]. The essential steps in this study were introduction of [[detailed balance]] for the complex chemical reactions by [[Rudolf Wegscheider]] (1901),&lt;ref&gt;Wegscheider, R. (1901) [http://www.springerlink.com/content/q12x76713v015316/ Über simultane Gleichgewichte und die Beziehungen zwischen Thermodynamik und Reactionskinetik homogener Systeme], Monatshefte für Chemie / Chemical Monthly 32(8), 849--906.&lt;/ref&gt; development of the quantitative theory of chemical chain reactions by [[Nikolay Semyonov]] (1934),&lt;ref&gt;Semyonov's  Nobel Lecture [http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1956/semenov-lecture.html Some Problems Relating to Chain Reactions and to the Theory of Combustion]&lt;/ref&gt; development of kinetics of [[catalytic]] reactions by  [[Cyril Norman Hinshelwood]],&lt;ref&gt;Hinshelwood's  Nobel Lecture [http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1956/hinshelwood-lecture.html Chemical Kinetics in the Past Few Decades]&lt;/ref&gt; and many other results.

Three eras of chemical dynamics can be revealed in the flux of research and publications.&lt;ref&gt;A.N. Gorban, G.S. Yablonsky [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281411623_Three_Waves_of_Chemical_Dynamics Three Waves of Chemical Dynamics], Mathematical Modelling of Natural Phenomena 10(5) (2015), 1–5.&lt;/ref&gt; These eras may be associated with leaders: the first is the [[Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff|van 't Hoff]] era, the second may be called the [[Nikolay Semyonov|Semenov]]–[[Cyril Norman Hinshelwood|Hinshelwood]] era and the third is definitely the [[Rutherford Aris|Aris]] era. 
The "eras" may be distinguished based on the main focuses of the scientific leaders:
* Van’t Hoff was searching for the general law of chemical reaction related to specific chemical properties. The term "chemical dynamics" belongs to van’t Hoff.
* The Semenov-Hinshelwood focus was an explanation of critical phenomena observed in many chemical systems, in particular in flames. A concept [[chain reaction]]s elaborated by these researchers influenced many sciences, especially nuclear physics and engineering.
* Aris’ activity was concentrated on the detailed systematization of mathematical ideas and approaches.

The mathematical discipline "chemical reaction network theory" was originated by [[Rutherford Aris]], a famous expert in chemical engineering, with support of [[Clifford Truesdell]], the founder and editor-in-chief of the journal ''[[Archive for Rational Mechanics and Analysis]]''. The paper of R. Aris in this journal&lt;ref&gt;R. Aris, Prolegomena to the rational analysis of systems of chemical reactions, Archive for Rational Mechanics and Analysis, 1965, Volume 19, Issue 2, pp 81-99.&lt;/ref&gt; was communicated to the journal by C. Truesdell. It opened the series of papers of other authors (which were communicated already by R. Aris).  The well known papers of this series are the works of Frederick J. Krambeck,&lt;ref&gt;F.J. Krambeck, The mathematical structure of chemical kinetics in homogeneous single-phase systems, Archive for Rational Mechanics and Analysis, 1970, Volume 38, Issue 5, pp 317-347,&lt;/ref&gt; Roy Jackson, Friedrich Josef Maria Horn,&lt;ref&gt;F. J. M. Horn and R. Jackson, "General Mass Action Kinetics", ''Archive Rational Mech.'', '''47''':81, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Feinberg]]&lt;ref&gt;M. Feinberg, "Complex balancing in general kinetic systems", ''[[Archive for Rational Mechanics and Analysis|Arch. Rational Mech. Anal.]]'', '''49''':187–194, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; and others, published in the 1970s. In his second "prolegomena" paper,&lt;ref&gt;R. Aris, Prolegomena to the rational analysis of systems of chemical reactions II. Some addenda, Archive for Rational Mechanics and Analysis, 1968, Volume 27, Issue 5, pp 356-364&lt;/ref&gt; R. Aris mentioned the work of N.Z. Shapiro, L.S. Shapley (1965),&lt;ref&gt;N.Z. Shapiro, L.S. Shapley, Mass action law and the Gibbs free energy function, SIAM J. Appl. Math. 16 (1965) 353–375.&lt;/ref&gt; where an important part of his scientific program was realized.

== Overview ==

A chemical reaction network (often abbreviated to '''CRN''') comprises a [[set (mathematics)|set]] of [[reagent|reactants]], a set of products (often [[intersection (set theory)|intersecting]] the set of reactants), and a set of [[chemical reaction|reactions]]. For example, the pair of [[combustion]] reactions

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math chem&gt;
\begin{align}
\ce{{2H2} + O2} &amp; \ce{-&gt; 2H2O} \\
\ce{{C} + O2} &amp; \ce{-&gt; CO2}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|reaction 1}}}}

form a reaction network. The reactions are represented by the arrows. The reactants appear to the left of the arrows, in this example they are &lt;chem&gt;H2&lt;/chem&gt; ([[hydrogen]]), &lt;chem&gt;O2&lt;/chem&gt; ([[oxygen]]) and {{math|C}} ([[carbon]]). The products appear to the right of the arrows, here they are &lt;chem&gt;H2O&lt;/chem&gt; ([[water]]) and &lt;chem&gt;CO2&lt;/chem&gt; ([[carbon dioxide]]). In this example, since the reactions are [[reversible reaction|irreversible]] and neither of the products are used up in the reactions, the set of reactants and the set of products are [[disjoint sets|disjoint]].

Mathematical modelling of chemical reaction networks usually focuses on what happens to the concentrations of the various chemicals involved as time passes. Following the example above, let {{mvar|a}} represent the [[concentration]] of &lt;chem&gt;H2&lt;/chem&gt; in the surrounding air, {{mvar|b}} represent the concentration of &lt;chem&gt;O2&lt;/chem&gt;, {{mvar|c}} represent the concentration of &lt;chem&gt;H2O&lt;/chem&gt;, and so on. Since all of these concentrations will not in general remain constant, they can be written as a function of time e.g. &lt;math&gt;a(t), b(t)&lt;/math&gt;, etc.

These variables can then be combined into a vector

: &lt;math&gt;x(t) = \left(\begin{array}{c} a(t) \\ b(t) \\ c(t) \\ \vdots \end{array}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

and their evolution with time can be written

: &lt;math&gt;\dot{x} \equiv \frac{dx}{dt} = \left(\begin{array}{c} \frac{da}{dt} \\[6pt] \frac{db}{dt} \\[6pt] \frac{dc}{dt} \\[6pt] \vdots \end{array}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

This is an example of a [[continuous function|continuous]] [[autonomous system (mathematics)|autonomous]] [[dynamical system]], commonly written in the form &lt;math&gt;\dot{x} = f(x)&lt;/math&gt;. The number of molecules of each reactant used up each time a reaction occurs is constant, as is the number of molecules produced of each product. These numbers are referred to as the [[stoichiometry]] of the reaction, and the difference between the two (i.e. the overall number of molecules used up or produced) is the '''net stoichiometry'''. This means that the equation representing the chemical reaction network can be rewritten as

: &lt;math&gt;\dot{x} = \Gamma V(x)&lt;/math&gt;

Here, each column of the [[constant (mathematics)|constant]] [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; represents the net stoichiometry of a reaction, and so &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''stoichiometry matrix'''. &lt;math&gt;V(x)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[vector-valued function]] where each output value represents a reaction rate, referred to as the [[chemical kinetics|kinetics]].

== Common assumptions ==

For physical reasons, it is usually assumed that reactant concentrations cannot be negative, and that each reaction only takes place if all its reactants are present, i.e. all have non-zero concentration. For mathematical reasons, it is usually assumed that &lt;math&gt;V(x)&lt;/math&gt; is [[smooth function|continuously differentiable]].

It is also commonly assumed that no reaction features the same chemical as both a reactant and a product (i.e. no [[catalysis]] or [[autocatalysis]]), and that increasing the concentration of a reactant increases the rate of any reactions that use it up. This second assumption is compatible with all physically reasonable kinetics, including [[law of mass action|mass action]], [[Michaelis–Menten kinetics|Michaelis–Menten]] and [[Hill equation (biochemistry)|Hill]] kinetics. Sometimes further assumptions are made about reaction rates, e.g. that all reactions obey mass action kinetics.

Other assumptions include [[mass balance]], constant [[temperature]], constant [[pressure]], [[homogeneous (chemistry)|spatially uniform]] concentration of reactants, and so on.

== Types of results ==

As chemical reaction network theory is a diverse and well-established area of research, there is a significant variety of results. Some key areas are outlined below.

=== Number of steady states ===

These results relate to whether a chemical reaction network can produce significantly different behaviour depending on the initial concentrations of its constituent reactants. This has applications in e.g. modelling [[biology|biological]] switches&amp;mdash;a high concentration of a key chemical at steady state could represent a biological process being "switched on" whereas a low concentration would represent being "switched off".

For example, the [[catalytic trigger]] is a simplest catalytic reaction without [[autocatalysis]] that allows multiplicity of steady states (1976):&lt;ref&gt;M.G. Slin'ko, V.I. Bykov, G.S. [[Grigoriy Yablonsky|Yablonskii]], T.A. Akramov, "Multiplicity of the Steady State in Heterogeneous Catalytic Reactions", ''Dokl. Akad. Nauk SSSR'' '''226''' (4) (1976), 876.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;V.I. Bykov, V.I. Elokhin, G.S. [[Grigoriy Yablonsky|Yablonskii]], [https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02061998  "The simplest catalytic mechanism permitting several steady states of the surface"], ''React. Kinet. Catal. Lett.'' '''4''' (2) (1976), 191–198.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;chem&gt;{A2}+2Z &lt;=&gt; 2AZ&lt;/chem&gt;|{{EquationRef|reaction 2}}}}
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;chem&gt;{B}+Z &lt;=&gt; BZ &lt;/chem&gt;|{{EquationRef|reaction 3}}}}
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;chem&gt;{AZ}+BZ -&gt; {AB}+2Z &lt;/chem&gt;|{{EquationRef|reaction 4}}}}
This is the classical [[Langmuir–Hinshelwood kinetics|adsorption mechanism]] of catalytic oxidation.

Here, &lt;chem&gt;A2, B&lt;/chem&gt; and &lt;chem&gt;AB&lt;/chem&gt; are gases (for example, &lt;chem&gt;O2&lt;/chem&gt;, &lt;chem&gt;CO&lt;/chem&gt; and &lt;chem&gt;CO2&lt;/chem&gt;), &lt;chem&gt;Z&lt;/chem&gt; is the "adsorption place" on the surface of the solid catalyst (for example, &lt;chem&gt;Pt&lt;/chem&gt;), &lt;chem&gt;AZ&lt;/chem&gt; and &lt;chem&gt;BZ&lt;/chem&gt; are the intermediates on the surface (adatoms, adsorbed molecules or radicals).
This system may have two stable steady states of the surface for the same concentrations of the gaseous components.

===  Stability of steady states ===

Stability determines whether a given steady state solution is likely to be observed in reality. Since real systems (unlike [[deterministic system|deterministic]] models) tend to be subject to random background noise, an unstable steady state solution is unlikely to be observed in practice. Instead of them, stable oscillations or other types of [[attractor]]s may appear.

=== Persistence ===

Persistence has its roots in [[population dynamics]]. A non-persistent [[species]] in population dynamics can go extinct for some (or all) initial conditions. Similar questions are of interests to chemists and biochemists, i.e. if a given reactant was present to start with, can it ever be completely used up?

=== Existence of stable  periodic solutions ===

Results regarding stable periodic solutions attempt to rule out "unusual" behaviour. If a given chemical reaction network admits a stable periodic solution, then some initial conditions will converge to an infinite cycle of oscillating reactant concentrations. For some parameter values it may even exhibit [[quasiperiodic motion|quasiperiodic]] or [[chaos theory#Chaotic dynamics|chaotic]] behaviour. While stable periodic solutions are unusual in real-world chemical reaction networks, well known examples exist, such as the [[Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction]]s. The simplest catalytic oscillator (nonlinear self-oscillations without autocatalysis)
can be produced from the catalytic trigger by adding a "buffer" step.&lt;ref&gt;V.I. Bykov, G.S. Yablonskii, V.F. Kim, "On the simple model of kinetic self-oscillations in catalytic reaction of CO oxidation", ''Doklady AN USSR'' (Chemistry)  '''242''' (3) (1978), 637–639.&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;chem&gt;{B} + Z &lt;=&gt; (BZ)&lt;/chem&gt;|{{EquationRef|reaction 5}}}}
where (BZ) is an intermediate that does not participate in the main reaction.

=== Network structure and dynamical properties ===

One of the main problems of chemical reaction network theory is connection between network structure and properties of dynamics. This connection is important even for linear systems, for example, the simple cycle with equal interaction weights has the slowest decay of the oscillations among all linear systems with the same number of states.&lt;ref&gt;A.N. Gorban, N. Jarman, E. Steur, C. van Leeuwen, I.Yu. Tyukin, [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/275974205_Leaders_Do_Not_Look_Back_or_Do_They Leaders do not Look Back, or do They?] Math. Model. Nat. Phenom. Vol. 10, No. 3, 2015, pp. 212–231.&lt;/ref&gt;

For nonlinear systems, many connections between structure and dynamics have been discovered. First of all, these are results about stability.&lt;ref&gt;B.L. Clarke, Theorems on chemical network stability. The Journal of Chemical Physics. 1975, 62(3), 773-775.&lt;/ref&gt; For some classes of networks, explicit construction of Lyapunov functions is possible without apriori assumptions about special relations between rate constants. Two results of this type are well known: the ''deficiency zero theorem''&lt;ref&gt;M. Feinberg, Chemical reaction network structure and the stability of complex isothermal reactors—I. The deficiency zero and deficiency one theorems. Chemical Engineering Science. 1987  31, 42(10), 2229-2268.&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''theorem about systems without interactions between different components''.&lt;ref&gt;A.N. Gorban, V.I. Bykov,  G.S. Yablonskii, [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236161590_Thermodynamic_function_analogue_for_reactions_proceeding_without_interaction_of_various_substances Thermodynamic function analogue for reactions proceeding without interaction of various substances], Chemical Engineering Science, 1986 41(11),  2739-2745.&lt;/ref&gt;

The deficiency zero theorem gives sufficient conditions for the existence of the Lyapunov function in the classical [[Helmholtz free energy|free energy]] form &lt;math&gt;G(c)=\sum_i c_i \left(\ln \frac{c_i}{c_i^*} -1\right)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;c_i&lt;/math&gt; is the concentration of the ''i''th component. The theorem about systems without interactions between different components states that if a network consists of reactions of the form &lt;math&gt;n_{r}A_i \to \sum_i \beta_{rj}A_j&lt;/math&gt; (where ''r'' is the number of reaction, &lt;math&gt;A_i&lt;/math&gt; is the symbol of ''i''th component, &lt;math&gt;n_{r}\geq 1&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\beta_{rj}&lt;/math&gt; are non-negative integers) and allows the stoichiometric conservation law &lt;math&gt;M(c)=\sum_i m_i c_i=\text{const}&lt;/math&gt; (where all &lt;math&gt;m_i&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;), then the weighted &lt;math&gt;l_1&lt;/math&gt; distance &lt;math&gt;\sum_i m_i |c_i^1(t)-c_i^2(t)|&lt;/math&gt; between two solutions &lt;math&gt;c^1(t),c^2(t)&lt;/math&gt; with the same ''M''(''c'') monotonically decreases in time.

=== Model reduction ===

Modelling of large reaction networks meets various difficulties: the models include too many unknown parameters and high dimension makes the modelling computationally expensive. The model reduction methods were developed together with the first theories of complex chemical reactions&lt;ref name = "Gorban2018"&gt;A.N.Gorban, [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323257203_Model_reduction_in_chemical_dynamics_slow_invariant_manifolds_singular_perturbations_thermodynamic_estimates_and_analysis_of_reaction_graph Model reduction in chemical dynamics: slow invariant manifolds, singular perturbations, thermodynamic estimates, and analysis of reaction graph.] Current Opinion in Chemical Engineering 2018 21C, 48-59. &lt;/ref&gt;. Three simple basic ideas have been invented:
*The quasi-equilibrium (or pseudo-equilibrium, or partial equilibrium) approximation (a fraction of reactions approach their equilibrium fast enough and, after that, remain almost equilibrated).
*The quasi steady state approximation or QSS (some of species, very often these are some of intermediates or radicals, exist in relatively small amounts; they reach quickly their QSS concentrations, and then follow, as a slave, the dynamics of these other species remaining close to the QSS). The QSS is defined as the steady state under condition that the concentrations of other species do not change.
*The [[Rate-determining step|limiting step]] or bottleneck is a relatively small part of the reaction network, in the simplest cases it is a single reaction, which rate is a good approximation to the reaction rate of the whole network.

The quasi-equilibrium approximation and the quasi steady state methods  were developed further into the methods of slow [[Invariant manifold|invariant manifolds]] and computational [[Singular perturbation|singular perturbation]]. The methods of limiting steps gave rise to many methods of the analysis of the reaction graph.&lt;ref name = "Gorban2018"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3584">'''Concurrent validity''' is a type of evidence that can be gathered to defend the use of a test for predicting other outcomes. It is a parameter used in sociology, psychology, and other [[Psychometrics|psychometric]] or behavioral sciences.  Concurrent validity is demonstrated when a test correlates well with a measure that has previously been [[Validity (statistics)|validated]]. The two measures may be for the same construct, but more often used for different, but presumably related, constructs.

The two measures in the study are taken at the same time. This is in contrast to [[predictive validity]], where one measure occurs earlier and is meant to predict some later measure.&lt;ref&gt;McIntire, S.A. and Miller, L.A., Foundations of Psychological Testing,2nd Edition, Sage Publishing Co., 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In both cases, the (concurrent) predictive power of the test is analyzed using a simple [[correlation]] or [[linear regression]].

==Alignment with classical conceptions of validity ==
Concurrent validity and predictive validity are two types of [[Criterion validity|criterion-related validity]].  The difference between concurrent validity and predictive validity rests solely on the time at which the two measures are administered.  Concurrent validity applies to validation studies in which the two measures are administered at approximately the same time.  For example, an employment test may be administered to a group of workers and then the test scores can be correlated with the ratings of the workers' supervisors taken on the same day or in the same week.  The resulting correlation would be a concurrent validity coefficient. This type of evidence might be used to support the use of the employment test for future selection of employees.

Concurrent validity may be used as a practical substitute for predictive validity. In the example above, predictive validity would be the best choice for validating an employment test, because using the employment test on existing employees may not be a strong analog for using the tests for selection. Reduced [[motivation]] and [[restriction of range]] are just two possible biasing effects for concurrent validity studies.&lt;ref name="Sackett"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sackett |first=P.R. |last2=Lievens |first2=F. |last3=Berry |first3=C.M. |last4=Landers |first4=R.N. |year=2007 |title= A Cautionary Note on the Effects of Range Restriction on Predictor Intercorrelations |journal= Journal of Applied Psychology |volume=92 |issue=2 |pages=538–544 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6436643_A_cautionary_note_on_the_effects_of_range_restriction_on_predictor_intercorrelations/file/d912f50dd667aa5857.pdf |doi=10.1037/0021-9010.92.2.538 |pmid=17371098}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lane"&gt;{{citation |last=Lane |first=D.M. |title=Restriction of Range |url=http://davidmlane.com/hyperstat/A68809.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contrasting similar terms==
Concurrent validity differs from [[convergent validity]] in that it focuses on the power of the focal test to ''predict'' outcomes on another test or some outcome variable. Convergent validity refers to the observation of strong correlations between two tests that are assumed to measure the same construct. It is the interpretation of the focal test as a ''predictor'' that differentiates this type of evidence from convergent validity, though both methods rely on simple correlations in the statistical analysis.

[[Image:Cryptographic Hash Function.svg|thumb|375px|right|A cryptographic hash function (specifically [[SHA-1]]) at work. A small change in the input (in the word "over") drastically changes the output (digest). This is the so-called [[avalanche effect]].]]

A '''cryptographic hash function''' is a special class of [[hash function]] that has certain properties which make it suitable for use in [[cryptography]]. It is a mathematical [[algorithm]] that [[Map (mathematics)|maps]] data of arbitrary size to a [[bit string]] of a fixed size (a hash) and is designed to be a [[one-way function]], that is, a function which is [[Computational complexity theory#Intractability|infeasible]] to invert.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The only way to recreate the input data from an ideal cryptographic hash function's output is to attempt a [[brute-force search]] of possible inputs to see if they produce a match, or use a [[rainbow table]] of matched hashes. [[Bruce Schneier]] has called one-way hash functions "the workhorses of modern cryptography".&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
The input data is often called the ''message'', and the output (the ''hash value'' or ''hash'') is often called the ''message digest'' or simply the ''digest''.

The ideal cryptographic hash function has five main properties:
* it is [[Deterministic algorithm|deterministic]] so the same message always results in the same hash
* it is quick to compute the hash value for any given message
* it is [[Computational complexity theory#Intractability|infeasible]] to generate a message from its hash value except by trying all possible messages
* a small change to a message should change the hash value so extensively that the new hash value appears uncorrelated with the old hash value
* it is [[Computational complexity theory#Intractability|infeasible]] to find two different messages with the same hash value

Cryptographic hash functions have many [[information security|information-security]] applications, notably in [[digital signature]]s, [[message authentication codes]] (MACs), and other forms of [[authentication]]. They can also be used as ordinary [[hash function]]s, to index data in [[hash table]]s, for [[fingerprint (computing)|fingerprinting]], to detect duplicate data or uniquely identify files, and as [[checksum]]s to detect accidental data corruption. Indeed, in information-security contexts, cryptographic hash values are sometimes called (''digital'') ''fingerprints'', ''checksums'', or just ''hash values'', even though all these terms stand for more general functions with rather different properties and purposes.

==Properties==
Most cryptographic hash functions are designed to take a [[string (computer science)|string]] of any length as input and produce a fixed-length hash value.

A cryptographic hash function must be able to withstand all known [[Cryptanalysis#Types of cryptanalytic attack|types of cryptanalytic attack]]. In theoretical cryptography, the security level of a cryptographic hash function has been defined using the following properties:

* ''Pre-image resistance''
*: Given a hash value ''h'' it should be difficult to find any message ''m'' such that ''h'' = hash(''m''). This concept is related to that of a [[one-way function]]. Functions that lack this property are vulnerable to [[preimage attack]]s.
* ''Second pre-image resistance''
*: Given an input ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, it should be difficult to find a different input ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; such that {{nowrap|1=hash(''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) = hash(''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)}}. Functions that lack this property are vulnerable to [[preimage attack|second-preimage attacks]].
* ''[[Collision resistance]]''
*: It should be difficult to find two different messages ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; such that {{nowrap|1=hash(''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) = hash(''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)}}. Such a pair is called a cryptographic [[hash collision]]. This property is sometimes referred to as ''strong collision resistance.'' It requires a hash value at least twice as long as that required for pre-image resistance; otherwise collisions may be found by a [[birthday attack]].&lt;ref name="KatzLindell"&gt;{{cite book | title=Introduction to Modern Cryptography | publisher=Chapman &amp; Hall/CRC |author1=Katz, Jonathan  |author2=Lindell, Yehuda | year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Collision resistance implies second pre-image resistance, but does not imply pre-image resistance.{{sfn|Rogaway|Shrimpton|2004|loc=in Sec. 5. Implications}} The weaker assumption is always preferred in theoretical cryptography, but in practice, a hash-function which is only second pre-image resistant is considered insecure and is therefore not recommended for real applications.

Informally, these properties mean that a [[adversary (cryptography)|malicious adversary]] cannot replace or modify the input data without changing its digest. Thus, if two strings have the same digest, one can be very confident that they are identical. Second pre-image resistance prevents an attacker from crafting a document with the same hash as a document the attacker cannot control. Collision resistance prevents an attacker from creating two distinct documents with the same hash.

A function meeting these criteria may still have undesirable properties. Currently popular cryptographic hash functions are vulnerable to [[Length extension attack|''length-extension'' attacks]]: given {{nowrap|hash(''m'')}} and {{nowrap|len(''m'')}} but not ''m'', by choosing a suitable ''m''{{'}} an attacker can calculate {{nowrap|hash(''m'' {{!}}{{!}} ''m''{{'}})}} where || denotes [[concatenation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vnhacker.blogspot.com/2009/09/flickrs-api-signature-forgery.html|title=Flickr's API Signature Forgery Vulnerability |publisher=Thai Duong and Juliano Rizzo}}&lt;/ref&gt; This property can be used to break naive authentication schemes based on hash functions. The [[HMAC]] construction works around these problems.

In practice, collision resistance is insufficient for many practical uses.
In addition to collision resistance, it should be impossible for an adversary to find two messages with substantially similar digests; or to infer any useful information about the data, given only its digest. In particular, a hash function should behave as much as possible like a [[random function]] (often called a [[random oracle]] in proofs of security) while still being deterministic and efficiently computable. This rules out functions like the [[SWIFFT]] function, which can be rigorously proven to be collision resistant assuming that certain problems on ideal lattices are computationally difficult, but as a linear function, does not satisfy these additional properties.&lt;ref name="SWIFFT"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-540-71039-4_4 | title=SWIFFT: A Modest Proposal for FFT Hashing | publisher=Springer | accessdate=29 August 2016 | author=Lyubashevsky, Vadim and Micciancio, Daniele and Peikert, Chris and Rosen, Alon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Checksum algorithms, such as [[CRC32]] and other [[cyclic redundancy check]]s, are designed to meet much weaker requirements, and are generally unsuitable as cryptographic hash functions. For example, a CRC was used for message integrity in the [[Wired Equivalent Privacy|WEP]] encryption standard, but an attack was readily discovered which exploited the linearity of the checksum.

===Degree of difficulty===
In cryptographic practice, "difficult" generally means "almost certainly beyond the reach of any adversary who must be prevented from breaking the system for as long as the security of the system is deemed important". The meaning of the term is therefore somewhat dependent on the application since the effort that a malicious agent may put into the task is usually proportional to his expected gain. However, since the needed effort usually multiplies with the digest length, even a thousand-fold advantage in processing power can be neutralized by adding a few dozen bits to the latter.

For messages selected from a limited set of messages, for example [[password]]s or other short messages, it can be feasible to invert a hash by trying all possible messages in the set. Because cryptographic hash functions are typically designed to be computed quickly, special [[key derivation function]]s that require greater computing resources have been developed that make such [[brute force attack]]s more difficult.

In some [[Computational complexity theory|theoretical analyses]] "difficult" has a specific mathematical meaning, such as "not solvable in [[asymptotic computational complexity|asymptotic]] [[polynomial time]]". Such interpretations of ''difficulty'' are important in the study of [[provably secure cryptographic hash function]]s but do not usually have a strong connection to practical security. For example, an [[exponential time]] algorithm can sometimes still be fast enough to make a feasible attack. Conversely, a polynomial time algorithm (e.g., one that requires ''n''&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; steps for ''n''-digit keys) may be too slow for any practical use.

==Illustration==
An illustration of the potential use of a cryptographic hash is as follows: [[Alice and Bob|Alice]] poses a tough math problem to [[Alice and Bob|Bob]] and claims she has solved it. Bob would like to try it himself, but would yet like to be sure that Alice is not bluffing. Therefore, Alice writes down her solution, computes its hash and tells Bob the hash value (whilst keeping the solution secret). Then, when Bob comes up with the solution himself a few days later, Alice can prove that she had the solution earlier by revealing it and having Bob hash it and check that it matches the hash value given to him before. (This is an example of a simple [[commitment scheme]]; in actual practice, Alice and Bob will often be computer programs, and the secret would be something less easily spoofed than a claimed puzzle solution).

==Applications==

===Verifying the integrity of messages and files===
{{ main | File verification }}

An important application of secure hashes is verification of [[message integrity]]. Comparing message digests (hash digests over the message) calculated before, and after, transmission can determine whether any changes have been made to the message or [[computer file|file]].

[[MD5]], [[SHA1]], or [[SHA2]] hash digests are sometimes published on websites or forums to allow verification of integrity for downloaded files,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/security/use-md5-hashes-to-verify-software-downloads/374 | title=Use MD5 hashes to verify software downloads | publisher=TechRepublic | date=December 5, 2007 | accessdate=March 2, 2013 | last = Perrin | first = Chad}}&lt;/ref&gt; including files retrieved using [[file sharing]] such as [[Mirror website|mirroring]]. This practice establishes a [[chain of trust]] so long as the hashes are posted on a site authenticated by [[HTTPS]]. Using a cryptographic hash and a chain of trust prevents malicious changes to the file to go undetected. Other [[error detecting code]]s such as [[cyclic redundancy check]]s only prevent against non-malicious alterations of the file.

===Signature generation and verification===
{{ main | Digital signature }}

Almost all [[digital signature]] schemes require a cryptographic hash to be calculated over the message. This allows the signature calculation to be performed on the relatively small, statically sized hash digest. The message is considered authentic if the signature verification succeeds given the signature and recalculated hash digest over the message. So the message integrity property of the cryptographic hash is used to create secure and efficient digital signature schemes.

===Password verification===
{{main | Password hashing }}

[[Password]] verification commonly relies on cryptographic hashes. Storing all user passwords as [[cleartext]] can result in a massive security breach if the password file is compromised. One way to reduce this danger is to only store the hash digest of each password. To authenticate a user, the password presented by the user is hashed and compared with the stored hash. A password reset method is required when password hashing is performed; original passwords cannot be recalculated from the stored hash value.

Standard cryptographic hash functions are designed to be computed quickly, and, as a result, it is possible to try guessed passwords at high rates. Common [[graphics processing unit]]s can try billions of possible passwords each second. Password hash functions that perform [[Key stretching]] - such as [[PBKDF2]], [[scrypt]] or [[Argon2]] - commonly use repeated invocations of a cryptographic hash to increase the time (and in some cases computer memory) required to perform [[brute force attack]]s on stored password hash digests. A password hash requires the use of a large random, non-secret [[Salt (cryptography)|salt]] value which can be stored with the password hash. The salt randomizes the output of the password hash, making it impossible for an adversary to store tables of passwords and [[precomputation|precomputed]] hash values to which the password hash digest can be compared.

The output of a password hash function can also be used as a cryptographic key. Password hashes are therefore also known as Password Based [[key derivation function|Key Derivation Function]]s (PBKDFs).

===Proof-of-work===
{{ main | Proof-of-work system }}

A proof-of-work system (or protocol, or function) is an economic measure to deter [[denial-of-service attack]]s and other service abuses such as spam on a network by requiring some work from the service requester, usually meaning processing time by a computer. A key feature of these schemes is their asymmetry: the work must be moderately hard (but feasible) on the requester side but easy to check for the service provider. One popular system – used in [[Bitcoin mining]] and [[Hashcash]] – uses partial hash inversions to prove that work was done, to unlock a mining reward in Bitcoin and as a good-will token to send an e-mail in Hashcash.  The sender is required to find a message whose hash value begins with a number of zero bits. The average work that sender needs to perform in order to find a valid message is exponential in the number of zero bits required in the hash value, while the recipient can verify the validity of the message by executing a single hash function. For instance, in Hashcash, a sender is asked to generate a header whose 160 bit SHA-1 hash value has the first 20 bits as zeros. The sender will on average have to try 2&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt; times to find a valid header.

===File or data identifier===

A message digest can also serve as a means of reliably identifying a file; several [[Source Code Management|source code management]] systems, including [[Git (software)|Git]], [[Mercurial (software)|Mercurial]] and [[Monotone (software)|Monotone]], use the [[sha1sum]] of various types of content (file content, directory trees, ancestry information, etc.) to uniquely identify them. Hashes are used to identify files on [[peer-to-peer]] [[filesharing]] networks. For example, in an [[ed2k link]], an [[MD4]]-variant hash is combined with the file size, providing sufficient information for locating file sources, downloading the file and verifying its contents. [[Magnet URI scheme|Magnet links]] are another example. Such file hashes are often the top hash of a [[hash list]] or a [[Merkle tree|hash tree]] which allows for additional benefits.

One of the main applications of a [[hash function]] is to allow the fast look-up of a data in a [[hash table]]. Being hash functions of a particular kind, cryptographic hash functions lend themselves well to this application too.

However, compared with standard hash functions, cryptographic hash functions tend to be much more expensive computationally. For this reason, they tend to be used in contexts where it is necessary for users to protect themselves against the possibility of forgery (the creation of data with the same digest as the expected data) by potentially malicious participants.

==Hash functions based on block ciphers==
There are several methods to use a [[block cipher]] to build a cryptographic hash function, specifically a [[one-way compression function]].

The methods resemble the [[block cipher modes of operation]] usually used for encryption. Many well-known hash functions, including [[MD4]], [[MD5]], [[SHA-1]] and [[SHA-2]] are built from block-cipher-like components designed for the purpose, with feedback to ensure that the resulting function is not invertible. [[NIST hash function competition|SHA-3]] finalists included functions with block-cipher-like components (e.g., [[Skein hash function|Skein]], [[BLAKE (hash function)|BLAKE]]) though the function finally selected, [[Keccak]], was built on a [[sponge function|cryptographic sponge]] instead.

A standard block cipher such as [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES]] can be used in place of these custom block ciphers; that might be useful when an [[embedded system]] needs to implement both encryption and hashing with minimal code size or hardware area. However, that approach can have costs in efficiency and security. The ciphers in hash functions are built for hashing: they use large keys and blocks, can efficiently change keys every block, and have been designed and vetted for resistance to [[related-key attack]]s. General-purpose ciphers tend to have different design goals. In particular, AES has key and block sizes that make it nontrivial to use to generate long hash values; AES encryption becomes less efficient when the key changes each block; and related-key attacks make it potentially less secure for use in a hash function than for encryption.

== Hash function design ==

===Merkle–Damgård construction===
{{Main|Merkle–Damgård construction}}
[[Image:Merkle-Damgard hash big.svg|thumb|450px|right|The Merkle–Damgård hash construction.]]
&lt;!--This section is largely duplicated in [[one-way compression function]]. Both should be moved to [[Merkle–Damgård construction]]--&gt;
A hash function must be able to process an arbitrary-length message into a fixed-length output. This can be achieved by breaking the input up into a series of equal-sized blocks, and operating on them in sequence using a [[one-way compression function]]. The compression function can either be specially designed for hashing or be built from a block cipher. A hash function built with the Merkle–Damgård construction is as resistant to collisions as is its compression function; any collision for the full hash function can be traced back to a collision in the compression function.

The last block processed should also be unambiguously [[Padding (cryptography)|length padded]]; this is crucial to the security of this construction. This construction is called the [[Merkle–Damgård construction]]. Most common classical hash functions, including [[SHA-1]] and [[MD5]], take this form.

=== {{Anchor|wide pipe|narrow pipe}}Wide pipe vs narrow pipe ===
A straightforward application of the Merkle–Damgård construction, where the size of hash output is equal to the internal state size (between each compression step), results in a '''narrow-pipe''' hash design. This design causes many inherent flaws, including [[Length extension attack|length-extension]], multicollisions,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lucks|first=Stefan|date=2004|title=Design Principles for Iterated Hash Functions|url=https://eprint.iacr.org/2004/253|journal=|via=Cryptology ePrint Archive, Report 2004/253}}&lt;/ref&gt; long message attacks,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kelsey|first=John|last2=Schneier|first2=Bruce|date=2004|title=Second Preimages on n-bit Hash Functions for Much Less than 2^n Work|url=https://eprint.iacr.org/2004/304|journal=|via=Cryptology ePrint Archive: Report 2004/304}}&lt;/ref&gt; generate-and-paste attacks,{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}} and also cannot be parallelized. As a result, modern hash functions are built on '''wide-pipe''' constructions that have a larger internal state size — which range from tweaks of the Merkle–Damgård construction&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; to new constructions such as the [[sponge construction]] and [[HAIFA construction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference|last=Biham|first=Eli|last2=Dunkelman|first2=Orr|date=24 August 2006|title=A Framework for Iterative Hash Functions – HAIFA|url=https://eprint.iacr.org/2007/278|conference=Second NIST Cryptographic Hash Workshop|via=Cryptology ePrint Archive: Report 2007/278}}&lt;/ref&gt; None of the entrants in the [[NIST hash function competition]] use a classical Merkle–Damgård construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nandi|first=Mridul|last2=Paul|first2=Souradyuti|date=2010|title=Speeding Up The Widepipe: Secure and Fast Hashing|url=https://eprint.iacr.org/2010/193|journal=|via=Cryptology ePrint Archive: Report 2010/193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, truncating the output of a longer hash, such as used in SHA-512/256, also defeats many of these attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dobraunig|first=Christoph|last2=Eichlseder|first2=Maria|last3=Mendel|first3=Florian|date=February 2015|title=Security Evaluation of SHA-224, SHA-512/224, and SHA-512/256|url=http://www.cryptrec.go.jp/estimation/techrep_id2401.pdf|journal=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in building other cryptographic primitives==
Hash functions can be used to build other cryptographic primitives. For these other primitives to be cryptographically secure, care must be taken to build them correctly.

[[Message authentication code]]s (MACs) (also called keyed hash functions) are often built from hash functions. [[HMAC]] is such a MAC.

Just as [[block cipher]]s can be used to build hash functions, hash functions can be used to build block ciphers.  [[Luby-Rackoff]] constructions using hash functions can be provably secure if the underlying hash function is secure.  Also, many hash functions (including [[SHA-1]] and [[SHA-2]]) are built by using a special-purpose block cipher in a [[One-way compression function#Davies.E2.80.93Meyer|Davies–Meyer]] or other construction.  That cipher can also be used in a conventional mode of operation, without the same security guarantees.  See [[SHACAL]], [[BEAR (cipher)|BEAR]] and [[LION (cipher)|LION]].

[[Pseudorandom number generator]]s (PRNGs) can be built using hash functions.  This is done by combining a (secret) random seed with a counter and hashing it.

Some hash functions, such as [[Skein (hash function)|Skein]], [[Keccak]], and [[RadioGatún]] output an arbitrarily long stream and can be used as a [[stream cipher]], and stream ciphers can also be built from fixed-length digest hash functions. Often this is done by first building a [[cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator]] and then using its stream of random bytes as [[keystream]]. [[SEAL (cipher)|SEAL]] is a stream cipher that uses [[SHA-1]] to generate internal tables, which are then used in a keystream generator more or less unrelated to the hash algorithm.  SEAL is not guaranteed to be as strong (or weak) as SHA-1. Similarly, the key expansion of the [[HC-256|HC-128 and HC-256]] stream ciphers makes heavy use of the [[SHA-2|SHA-256]] hash function.

==Concatenation==

[[Concatenation|Concatenating]] outputs from multiple hash functions provides collision resistance as good as the strongest of the algorithms included in the concatenated result.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}  For example, older versions of [[Transport Layer Security|Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)]] use concatenated [[MD5]] and [[SHA-1]] sums.&lt;ref&gt;

quote: 'Concatenating ... is often used by implementors to "hedge bets" on hash functions. A combiner of the form MD5||SHA-1 as used in SSL3.0/TLS1.0 ... is an example of such a strategy.'

p. 99.
&lt;/ref&gt;
This ensures that a method to find collisions in one of the hash functions does not defeat data protected by both hash functions.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

For [[Merkle–Damgård construction]] hash functions, the concatenated function is as collision-resistant as its strongest component, but not more collision-resistant.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} [[Antoine Joux]] observed that 2-collisions lead to n-collisions: if it is feasible for an attacker to find two messages with the same MD5 hash, the attacker can find as many messages as the attacker desires with identical MD5 hashes with no greater difficulty.&lt;ref&gt;[[Antoine Joux]].

LNCS 3152/2004, pages 306–316 [http://www.springerlink.com/index/DWWVMQJU0N0A3UGJ.pdf Full text].&lt;/ref&gt; Among the n messages with the same MD5 hash, there is likely to be a collision in SHA-1.  The additional work needed to find the SHA-1 collision (beyond the exponential birthday search) requires only [[polynomial time]].&lt;ref name="urlGmane"&gt;{{cite web

==Cryptographic hash algorithms==

There are many cryptographic hash algorithms; this section lists a few algorithms that are referenced relatively often. A more extensive list can be found on the page containing a [[comparison of cryptographic hash functions]].

===MD5===
{{ Main | MD5 }}

MD5 was designed by Ronald Rivest in 1991 to replace an earlier hash function MD4, and was specified in 1992 as RFC 1321. Collisions against MD5 can be calculated within seconds which makes the algorithm unsuitable for most use cases where a cryptographic hash is required. MD5 produces a digest of 128 bits (16 bytes).

===SHA-1===
{{ Main | SHA-1 }}

SHA-1 was developed as part of the U.S. Government's Capstone project. The original specification - now commonly called SHA-0 - of the algorithm was published in 1993 under the title Secure Hash Standard, FIPS PUB 180, by U.S. government standards agency NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology). It was withdrawn by the NSA shortly after publication and was superseded by the revised version, published in 1995 in FIPS PUB 180-1 and commonly designated SHA-1. Collisions against the full SHA-1 algorithm can be produced using the [[SHA-1#SHAttered – first public collision|shattered attack]] and the hash function should be considered broken. SHA-1 produces a hash digest of 160 bits (20 bytes).

Documents may refer to SHA-1 as just "SHA", even though this may conflict with the other Standard Hash Algorithms such as SHA-0, SHA-2 and SHA-3.

===RIPEMD-160===
{{ Main | RIPEMD-160 }}

RIPEMD (RACE Integrity Primitives Evaluation Message Digest) is a family of cryptographic hash functions developed in Leuven, Belgium, by Hans Dobbertin, Antoon Bosselaers and Bart Preneel at the COSIC research group at the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, and first published in 1996. RIPEMD was based upon the design principles used in MD4, and is similar in performance to the more popular SHA-1. RIPEMD-160 has however not been broken.  As the name implies, RIPEMD-160 produces a hash digest of 160 bits (20 bytes).

===Whirlpool===
{{ Main | Whirlpool (cryptography) }}

In computer science and cryptography, Whirlpool is a cryptographic hash function. It was designed by Vincent Rijmen and Paulo S. L. M. Barreto, who first described it in 2000. Whirlpool is based on a substantially modified version of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). Whirlpool produces a hash digest of 512 bits (64 bytes).

===SHA-2===
{{ Main | SHA-2 }}

SHA-2 (Secure Hash Algorithm 2) is a set of cryptographic hash functions designed by the United States National Security Agency (NSA), first published in 2001.[3] They are built using the Merkle–Damgård structure, from a one-way compression function itself built using the Davies–Meyer structure from a (classified) specialized block cipher.

SHA-2 basically consists of two hash algorithms: SHA-256 and SHA-512. SHA-224 is a variant of SHA-256 with different starting values and truncated output. SHA-384 and the lesser known SHA-512/224 and SHA-512/256 are all variants of SHA-512. SHA-512 is more secure than SHA-256 and is commonly faster than SHA-256 on 64 bit machines such as [[X86-64|AMD64]].

The output size in bits is given by the extension to the "SHA" name, so SHA-224 has an output size of 224 bits (28 bytes), SHA-256 produces 32 bytes, SHA-384 produces 48 bytes and finally SHA-512 produces 64 bytes.

===SHA-3===
{{ Main  | SHA-3 }}

SHA-3 (Secure Hash Algorithm 3) was released by NIST on August 5, 2015. SHA-3 is a subset of the broader cryptographic primitive family Keccak. The Keccak algorithm is the work of Guido Bertoni, Joan Daemen, Michael Peeters, and Gilles Van Assche. Keccak is based on a sponge construction which can also be used to build other cryptographic primitives such as a stream cipher. SHA-3 provides the same output sizes as SHA-2: 224, 256, 384 and 512 bits.

Configurable output sizes can also be obtained using the SHAKE-128 and SHAKE-256 functions. Here the -128 and -256 extensions to the name imply the security strength of the function rather than the output size in bits.

===BLAKE2===
{{ Main | BLAKE2 }}

An improved version of BLAKE called BLAKE2 was announced in December 21, 2012. It was created by Jean-Philippe Aumasson, Samuel Neves, Zooko Wilcox-O'Hearn, and Christian Winnerlein with the goal to replace widely used, but broken MD5 and SHA-1 algorithms. When run on 64-bit x64 and ARM architectures, BLAKE2b is faster than SHA-3, SHA-2, SHA-1, and MD5. Although BLAKE nor BLAKE2 have not been standardized as SHA-3 it has been used in many protocols including the [[Argon2]] password hash for the high efficiency that it offers on modern CPUs. As BLAKE was a candidate for SHA-3, BLAKE and BLAKE2 both offer the same output sizes as SHA-3 - including a configurable output size.

==Attacks on cryptographic hash algorithms==

There is a long list of cryptographic hash functions but many have been found to be vulnerable and should not be used. For instance, NIST selected 51 hash functions&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Regenscheid, Ray Perlner, Shu-jen Chang, John Kelsey, Mridul Nandi, Souradyuti Paul, [https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/IR/nistir7620.pdf Status Report on the First Round of the SHA-3 Cryptographic Hash Algorithm Competition]&lt;/ref&gt; as candidates for round 1 of the SHA-3 hash competition, of which 10 were considered broken and 16 showed significant weaknesses and therefore didn't make it to the next round; more information can be found on the main article about the [[NIST hash function competition]]s.

Even if a hash function has never been broken, a [[Cryptographic attack#Amount of information available to the attacker|successful attack]] against a weakened variant may undermine the experts' confidence. For instance, in August 2004 collisions were found in several then-popular hash functions, including MD5.&lt;ref&gt;XiaoyunWang, Dengguo Feng, Xuejia Lai, Hongbo Yu, [https://eprint.iacr.org/2004/199.pdf Collisions for Hash Functions MD4, MD5, HAVAL-128 and RIPEMD]&lt;/ref&gt; These weaknesses called into question the security of stronger algorithms derived from the weak hash functions—in particular, SHA-1 (a strengthened version of SHA-0), RIPEMD-128, and RIPEMD-160 (both strengthened versions of RIPEMD).{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

On 12 August 2004, Joux, Carribault, Lemuet, and Jalby announced a collision for the full SHA-0 algorithm.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} Joux et al. accomplished this using a generalization of the Chabaud and Joux attack. They found that the collision had complexity 2&lt;sup&gt;51&lt;/sup&gt; and took about 80,000 CPU hours on a [[supercomputer]] with 256 [[Itanium 2]] processors—equivalent to 13 days of full-time use of the supercomputer.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

In February 2005, an attack on SHA-1 was reported that would find collision in about 2&lt;sup&gt;69&lt;/sup&gt; hashing operations, rather than the 2&lt;sup&gt;80&lt;/sup&gt; expected for a 160-bit hash function. In August 2005, another attack on SHA-1 was reported that would find collisions in 2&lt;sup&gt;63&lt;/sup&gt; operations. Other theoretical weaknesses of SHA-1 have been known:&lt;ref&gt;Xiaoyun Wang, Yiqun Lisa Yin, and Hongbo Yu, [http://people.csail.mit.edu/yiqun/SHA1AttackProceedingVersion.pdf Finding Collisions in the Full SHA-1]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Schneier, [http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2005/02/cryptanalysis_o.html Cryptanalysis of SHA-1] (summarizes Wang et al. results and their implications)&lt;/ref&gt; and in February 2017 Google announced a collision in SHA-1.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2017/02/23/google-sha-1-hack-why-it-matters/#3f73df04c8cd|title=Google Just 'Shattered' An Old Crypto Algorithm – Here's Why That's Big For Web Security|last=Fox-Brewster|first=Thomas|newspaper=Forbes|access-date=2017-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Security researchers recommend that new applications can avoid these problems by using later members of the SHA family, such as [[SHA-2]], or using techniques such as randomized hashing&lt;ref&gt;Shai Halevi, Hugo Krawczyk, [http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/hash/documents/HALEVI_UpdateonRandomizedHashing0824.pdf Update on Randomized Hashing]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Shai Halevi and Hugo Krawczyk, [http://www.ee.technion.ac.il/~hugo/rhash/ Randomized Hashing and Digital Signatures]&lt;/ref&gt; that do not require collision resistance.

A successful, practical attack broke MD5 used within certificates for [[Transport Layer Security]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Sotirov, Marc Stevens, Jacob Appelbaum, Arjen Lenstra, David Molnar, Dag Arne Osvik, Benne de Weger, [http://www.win.tue.nl/hashclash/rogue-ca/ MD5 considered harmful today: Creating a rogue CA certificate], accessed March 29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many cryptographic hashes are based on the [[Merkle–Damgård construction]]. All cryptographic hashes that directly use the full output of a Merkle–Damgård construction are vulnerable against [[length extension attack]]s. This makes the MD5, SHA-1, RIPEMD-160, Whirlpool and the SHA-256 / SHA-512 hash algorithms all vulnerable against this specific attack. SHA-3, BLAKE2 and the truncated SHA-2 variants are not vulnerable against this type of attack.

'''David Eugene Smith''' (January 21, 1860 – July 29, 1944) was an [[Americans|American]] mathematician, educator, and editor.

==Education and career==
David Eugene Smith is considered one of the founders of the field of mathematics education. Smith was born in Cortland, New York, to Abram P. Smith, attorney and surrogate judge, and Mary Elizabeth Bronson, who taught her young son Latin and Greek.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=DONOGHUE|first=EILEEN F.|title=In Search of Mathematical Treasures: David Eugene Smith and George Arthur Plimpton|journal=Historia Mathematica|year=1998|volume=25|issue=4|pages=359–365|doi=10.1006/hmat.1998.2203}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[Syracuse University]], graduating in 1881 (Ph. D., 1887; LL.D., 1905).  He studied to be a lawyer concentrating in arts and humanities, but accepted an instructorship in mathematics at the Cortland Normal School in 1884 &lt;ref name="maa"&gt;http://www.maa.org/history/presidents/smith.html&lt;/ref&gt; where he attended as a young man. While at the Cortland Normal School Smith became a member of the Young Men's Debating Club&lt;ref&gt;An Honorable Record: Some of the alumni of the Young Men's Debating Club. Cortland Evening Standard, Friday, April 12, 1895.&lt;/ref&gt; (today the [[Delphic Fraternity]].) He became a professor at the [[Michigan State Normal College]] in 1891 (later Eastern Michigan University), the principal at the [[State University of New York at Brockport|State Normal School]] in [[Brockport, New York]] (1898), and a professor of mathematics at [[Teachers College, Columbia University]] (1901) where he remained until his retirement in 1926.

Smith became president of the [[Mathematical Association of America]] in 1920&lt;ref name="maa" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Religio Mathematici. Presidential address delivered before the Mathematical Association of America, September 7, 1921|journal=The American Mathematical Monthly|volume=28|date=October 1921|pages=339–349|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.32044102896305;view=1up;seq=379|doi=10.2307/2972153}}&lt;/ref&gt; and served as the president of the [[History of Science Society]] in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;The History of Science Society [http://www.hssonline.org/about/society_presidents.html "The Society: Past Presidents of the History of Science Society"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212134009/http://www.hssonline.org/about/society_presidents.html |date=December 12, 2013 }}, accessed 4 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote a large number of publications of various types. He was editor of the ''Bulletin'' of the [[American Mathematical Society]]; contributed to other mathematical journals; published a series of textbooks; translated [[Felix Klein]]'s ''Famous Problems of Geometry'', Fink's ''History of Mathematics'', and the [[Treviso Arithmetic]]. He edited&lt;ref&gt;[[G. B.

A '''disperser''' is a one-sided [[randomness extractor|extractor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Ronen|last=Shaltiel|title=Recent developments in explicit constructions of extractors|journal=Bulletin of the EATCS|year=2002|volume=77|pages=67–95|url=https://cs.haifa.ac.il/~ronen/online_papers/survey.ps|accessdate=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where an extractor requires that every event gets the same [[probability]] under the [[Continuous uniform distribution|uniform distribution]] and the extracted distribution, only the latter is required for a disperser. So for a disperser, an event &lt;math&gt;A \subseteq \{0,1\}^{m}&lt;/math&gt; we have:
&lt;math&gt;Pr_{U_{m}}[A] &gt; 1 - \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;

'''Definition (Disperser):''' ''A'' &lt;math&gt;(k, \epsilon)&lt;/math&gt;''-disperser is a function''

&lt;math&gt;Dis: \{0,1\}^{n}\times \{0,1\}^{d}\rightarrow \{0,1\}^{m}&lt;/math&gt;

''such that for every distribution'' &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; ''on'' &lt;math&gt;\{0,1\}^{n}&lt;/math&gt; ''with'' &lt;math&gt;H_{\infty}(X) \geq k&lt;/math&gt; ''the support of the distribution'' &lt;math&gt;Dis(X,U_{d})&lt;/math&gt; ''is of size at least'' &lt;math&gt;(1-\epsilon)2^{m}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Graph theory==
An '''(''N'', ''M'', ''D'', ''K'', ''e'')-disperser''' is a [[bipartite graph]] with ''N'' vertices on the left side, each with degree ''D'', and ''M'' vertices on the right side, such that every [[subset]] of ''K'' vertices on the left side is connected to more than (1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''e'')''M'' vertices on the right.

An [[Extractor (mathematics)|extractor]] is a related type of graph that guarantees an even stronger property; every '''(''N'', ''M'', ''D'', ''K'', ''e'')-extractor''' is also an '''(''N'', ''M'', ''D'', ''K'', ''e'')-disperser'''.

==Other meanings==
A disperser is a high-speed mixing device used to disperse or dissolve pigments and other solids into a liquid.

An '''engineering technician'''  is primarily trained in the [[skill]]s and techniques related to a specific branch of [[engineering]], with a practical understanding of the relevant engineering concepts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos112.htm US Department of Labor job Description]&lt;/ref&gt; Engineering technicians often assist [[engineer]]s and [[Engineering technologist|technologist]]s in projects relating to [[research and development]], or focus on post-development activities like implementation or operation. An engineering technician is between a [[skilled worker|skilled craft worker]] and a technologist.

The [[Dublin Accord]] was signed in 2002 as an international agreement for the recognition of engineering technician qualifications. The Dublin Accord is analogous to the [[Washington Accord]] for [[engineer]]s and the [[Sydney Accord]] for [[engineering technologist]]s.

==Nature of work==
Engineering technicians help solve technical problems in many ways. They build or set up equipment, conduct experiments, and collect data and calculate results. They might also help to make a model of new equipment. Some technicians work in quality control, where they check products, do tests, and collect data. In manufacturing, they help to design and develop products. They also find ways to produce things efficiently.There are multiple fields in this job such as; software design, repair, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bls.gov/k12/science05.htm Engineering Technician&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
They may also be people who produce [[technical drawing]]s or [[engineering drawing]]s.

==Education==
Engineering technician diplomas and 2-year degrees are generally offered by [[technical school]]s and non-[[university]] [[higher education]] institutions like colleges of further education, [[industrial school]]s, and [[community college]]s. Many 4-year colleges and universities offer bachelor's degrees in engineering technology, but engineering technologists are somewhat different from technicians.&lt;ref name=BLS2&gt;{{cite web|title=Electrical and Electronic Engineering Technicians|url=http://www.bls.gov/ooh/architecture-and-engineering/electrical-and-electronic-engineering-technicians.htm#tab-2|work=Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2012-13 Edition|publisher=Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor|accessdate=November 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries, there were [[vocational education]] schools that may have also conferred the title without awarding any degrees.

Both [[Portugal]] and [[Spain]] use the title of ''engenharia técnica''/''ingeniería técnica'', literally "technical engineering", for the professionals who were awarded a short-cycle 3- to 4-year undergraduate degree ([[associate degree]] or [[bachelor's degree]]) in a [[technology|technical]] [[engineering]] field by colleges or technical engineering institutes in the case of Portugal, and universities in Spain. Spanish "technical engineers" have full competency in their respective professional field of engineering, being the difference that the three or four year Engineers have competence only in their speciality (Mechanical, Electrical, Chemical, etc.)and the "Engineering Superior School" Engineers have wider competences.

In the [[United States]], the Technology Accreditation Commission of the [[Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology]] (ABET) grants 2-year associate degree programs to students that meet a set of specified standards. These programs include at least a college algebra and trigonometry course and, if needed, one or two basic science courses at any accredited school. The number of math and science prerequisite courses depends on the branch of engineering that the student chooses.

Engineering technicians apply scientific and engineering skills usually gained in [[post secondary]] programs below the bachelor's degree level or through short-cycle bachelor's degrees. However, some university institutions award undergraduate degrees in the field of engineering which may confer the title of Engineering technician to the student, who is, however, eligible to become a fully chartered engineer after further studies at the master's degree level.  Engineering technicians are called professional engineers in the UK only.

==Certification==
In [[Canada]], the term '''certified engineering technician''' is protected by legislation and can only be used by technicians certified by provincial member organizations of the [[Canadian Council of Technicians and Technologists]], such as the [[Ontario Association of Certified Engineering Technicians and Technologists]] and the [http://www.aset.ab.ca  Association of Science and Engineering Technology Professionals of Alberta].

In the [[United Kingdom]], the term '''Engineering Technician''' and [[post-nominals]] '''EngTech''' are protected in civil law, and can only be used by technicians registered with the [[Engineering Council UK]].

The term [[engineer]] is not protected in the UK, however those holding EngTech accreditation can be employed as Engineers, providing they have the additional experience/qualifications.  In the UK the term "Engineer" is used by thousands of unskilled, semi-skilled and skilled trades.

In the eyes of professional engineers (but not the public) It is more acceptable to reserve the title 'Engineer' until you can fulfil the criteria required by the [[Engineering Council UK]] for Incorporated Engineer (IEng) or Chartered Engineer (CEng) status - A Bachelors / Masters Engineer Degree and additional professional practice experience (minimum 4 years), as well as a nominated sponsor who can verify your claims is the most common method for IEng/CEng accreditation.

This procedure helps reduce the saturation of the term 'Engineer', a concern to many who have completed years of undergraduate and postgraduate study and often work as 'Junior Support Engineers' for a number of years after graduation before being able to confidently state their profession.

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9257">'''[[Differential equation]]s''' arise in many problems in [[physics]], [[engineering]], and other sciences. The following examples show how to solve differential equations in a few simple cases when an exact solution exists.

== Separable first-order ordinary differential equations ==
{{see also|Separable partial differential equation}}
Equations in the form &lt;math&gt;\frac {dy}{dx} = f(x)g(y)&lt;/math&gt; are called separable and solved by &lt;math&gt;\frac {dy}{g(y)} = f(x)dx&lt;/math&gt; and thus 
&lt;math&gt;\int\frac {dy}{g(y)} = \int f(x)dx&lt;/math&gt;. Prior to dividing by &lt;math&gt;g(y)&lt;/math&gt;, one needs to check if there are stationary (also called equilibrium)
solutions &lt;math&gt;y=const&lt;/math&gt; satisfying &lt;math&gt;g(y)=0&lt;/math&gt;.

==Separable (homogeneous) first-order linear ordinary differential equations==
{{see also|Separable partial differential equation}}
A separable ''linear'' [[ordinary differential equation]] of the first order 
must be homogeneous and has the general form

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dt} + f(t) y = 0&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;f(t)&lt;/math&gt; is some known [[function (mathematics)|function]].  We may solve this by [[separation of variables]] (moving the ''y'' terms to one side and the ''t'' terms to the other side),

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{y} = -f(t)\, dt&lt;/math&gt;

Since the separation of variables in this case involves dividing by ''y'', we must check if the constant function ''y=0'' is a solution of the original equation. Trivially, if ''y=0'' then ''y'=0'', so ''y=0'' is actually a solution of the original equation. We note that ''y=0'' is not allowed in the transformed equation.

We solve the transformed equation with the variables already separated by [[Integral Calculus|Integrating]],

:&lt;math&gt;\ln |y| = \left(-\int f(t)\,dt\right) + C&lt;/math&gt;

where ''C'' is an arbitrary constant. Then, by [[exponentiation]], we obtain

:&lt;math&gt;y = \pm e^{\left(-\int f(t)\,dt\right) + C} = \pm e^{C} e^{-\int f(t)\,dt}&lt;/math&gt;.

Here, &lt;math&gt;e^{C}&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;\pm e^{C}\neq 0&lt;/math&gt;. But we have independently checked that ''y=0'' is also a solution of the original equation, thus 
:&lt;math&gt;y = A e^{-\int f(t)\,dt}&lt;/math&gt;.
with an arbitrary constant ''A'', which covers all the cases. It is easy to confirm that this is a solution by plugging it into the original differential equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dt} + f(t) y = -f(t) \cdot A e^{-\int f(t)\,dt} + f(t) \cdot A e^{-\int f(t)\,dt} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

Some elaboration is needed because ''&amp;fnof;''(''t'')  might not even be integrable. One must also assume something about the domains of the functions involved before the equation is fully defined. The solution above assumes the [[real number|real]] case.

If &lt;math&gt;f(t)=\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is a constant, the solution is particularly simple, &lt;math&gt;y = A e^{-\alpha t}&lt;/math&gt; and describes, e.g., if &lt;math&gt;\alpha&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, the exponential decay of radioactive material at the macroscopic level. If the value of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is not known a priori, it can be determined from two measurements of the solution. For example,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dt} + \alpha y = 0, y(1)=2, y(2)=1&lt;/math&gt;

gives &lt;math&gt;\alpha = \ln(2)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y = 4 e^{-\ln(2) t}= 2^{2-t}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Non-separable (non-homogeneous) first-order linear ordinary differential equations==
First-order linear non-homogeneous ODEs (ordinary [[differential equation]]s) are not separable. They can be solved by the following approach, known as an ''[[integrating factor]]'' method. Consider first-order linear ODEs of the general form:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx} + p(x)y = q(x)&lt;/math&gt;

The method for solving this equation relies on a special integrating factor, ''&amp;mu;'':

:&lt;math&gt;\mu = e^{\int_{x_0}^x p(t)\, dt}&lt;/math&gt;

We choose this integrating factor because it has the special property that its derivative is itself times the function we are integrating, that is:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d{\mu}}{dx} = e^{\int_{x_0}^x p(t)\, dt} \cdot p(x) = \mu p(x)&lt;/math&gt;

Multiply both sides of the original differential equation by ''&amp;mu;'' to get:

:&lt;math&gt;\mu{\frac{dy}{dx}} + \mu{p(x)y}  = \mu{q(x)}&lt;/math&gt;

Because of the special ''&amp;mu;'' we picked, we may substitute ''d&amp;mu;''/''dx'' for ''&amp;mu;''&amp;nbsp;''p''(''x''), simplifying the equation to:

:&lt;math&gt;\mu{\frac{dy}{dx}} + y{\frac{d{\mu}}{dx}} = \mu{q(x)}&lt;/math&gt;

Using the [[product rule (calculus)|product rule]] in reverse, we get:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}{(\mu{y})} = \mu{q(x)}&lt;/math&gt;

Integrating both sides:

:&lt;math&gt;\mu{y} = \left(\int\mu q(x)\, dx\right) + C&lt;/math&gt;

Finally, to solve for ''y'' we divide both sides by &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;y = \frac{\left(\int\mu q(x)\, dx\right) + C}{\mu}&lt;/math&gt;

Since ''&amp;mu;'' is a function of ''x'', we cannot simplify any further directly.

==Second-order linear ordinary differential equations==

===A simple example===
Suppose a mass is attached to a spring which exerts an attractive force on the mass [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the extension/compression of the spring. For now, we may ignore any other forces ([[gravity]], [[friction]], etc.).  We shall write the extension of the spring at a time ''t'' as&amp;nbsp;''x''(''t'').  Now, using [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's second law]] we can write (using convenient units):

: &lt;math&gt;m\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} +kx=0,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''m'' is the mass and ''k'' is the spring constant that represents a measure of spring stiffness. For simplicity's sake, let us take ''m=k'' as an example.

If we look for solutions that have the form &lt;math&gt;Ce^{\lambda t}&lt;/math&gt;, where ''C'' is a constant, we discover the relationship &lt;math&gt;\lambda^2+1=0&lt;/math&gt;, and thus &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; must be one of the [[complex number]]s &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;-i&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus, using [[Euler's formula]] we can say that the solution must be of the form:

: &lt;math&gt;x(t) = A \cos t + B \sin t&lt;/math&gt;

See a [http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=x%27%27%3D-x solution] by [[WolframAlpha]].

To determine the unknown constants ''A'' and ''B'',  we need ''initial conditions'', i.e. equalities that specify the state of the system at a given time (usually&amp;nbsp;''t''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0).

For example, if we suppose at ''t''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 the extension is a unit distance (''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1), and the particle is not moving (''dx''/''dt''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0). We have

: &lt;math&gt;x(0) = A \cos 0 + B \sin 0 = A = 1, &lt;/math&gt;

and so&amp;nbsp;''A''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1.

: &lt;math&gt;x'(0) = -A \sin 0 + B \cos 0 = B = 0, &lt;/math&gt;

and so ''B''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.

Therefore ''x''(''t'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;cos&amp;nbsp;''t''.  This is an example of [[simple harmonic motion]].

See a [http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=x%27%27%3D-x%2Cx%280%29%3D1%2Cx%27%280%29%3D0 solution] by [[Wolfram Alpha]].

===A more complicated model===
The above model of an oscillating mass on a spring is plausible but not very realistic: in practice, [[friction]] will tend to decelerate the mass and have magnitude proportional to its velocity (i.e.&amp;nbsp;''dx''/''dt'').  Our new differential equation, expressing the balancing of the acceleration and the forces, is

: &lt;math&gt;m\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + c \frac{dx}{dt} + kx=0,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the damping coefficient representing  friction.  Again looking for solutions of the form &lt;math&gt;Ce^{\lambda t}&lt;/math&gt;, we find that

: &lt;math&gt;m\lambda^2 + c \lambda + k = 0. &lt;/math&gt;

This is a [[quadratic equation]] which we can solve.  If &lt;math&gt;c^2&lt;4km&lt;/math&gt; there are two complex conjugate  roots ''a''&amp;nbsp;±&amp;nbsp;''ib'', and the solution (with the above boundary conditions) will look like this:

: &lt;math&gt;x(t) = e^{at} \left(\cos bt - \frac{a}{b} \sin bt \right) &lt;/math&gt;

Let us for simplicity take &lt;math&gt;m=1&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;0&lt;c=-2a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k=a^2+b^2&lt;/math&gt;.

The equation can be also solved in MATLAB symbolic toolbox as
&lt;source lang="matlab"&gt;
x = dsolve('D2x+c*Dx+k*x=0','x(0)=1','Dx(0)=0')
&lt;/source&gt;
although the solution looks rather ugly,
&lt;source lang="matlab"&gt;
x = (c + (c^2 - 4*k)^(1/2))/(2*exp(t*(c/2 - (c^2 - 4*k)^(1/2)/2))*(c^2 - 4*k)^(1/2)) - 
    (c - (c^2 - 4*k)^(1/2))/(2*exp(t*(c/2 + (c^2 - 4*k)^(1/2)/2))*(c^2 - 4*k)^(1/2))
&lt;/source&gt;

This is a model of a [[Damping|damped oscillator]]. The plot of displacement against time would look like this:

: [[Image:Damped Oscillation2.svg|400px|center]]

which resembles how one would expect a vibrating spring to behave as friction removes energy from the system.

==Linear systems of ODEs==

The following example of a first order linear systems of ODEs
: &lt;math&gt; y_1'=y_1+2y_2+t&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; y_2'=2y_1-2y_2+\sin(t)&lt;/math&gt;

can be easily solved symbolically using [[List_of_numerical_analysis_software|numerical analysis software]].

In [[mathematics]], the '''geometric–harmonic mean''' M(''x'', ''y'') of two positive [[real number]]s ''x'' and ''y'' is defined as follows: we form the [[geometric mean]] of ''g''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ''x'' and ''h''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ''y'' and call it ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, i.e. ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[square root]] of ''xy''.  We also form the [[harmonic mean]] of ''x'' and ''y'' and call it ''h''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, i.e. ''h''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of the [[arithmetic mean]] of the reciprocals of ''x'' and ''y''.  These may be done sequentially (in any order) or simultaneously.

Now we can iterate this operation with ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; taking the place of ''x'' and ''h''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; taking the place of ''y''. In this way, two [[sequence]]s (''g''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) and (''h''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) are defined:

:&lt;math&gt;g_{n+1} = \sqrt{g_n h_n}&lt;/math&gt;

and 

:&lt;math&gt;h_{n+1} = \frac{2}{\frac{1}{g_n} + \frac{1}{h_n}}&lt;/math&gt;

Both of these sequences [[limit (mathematics)|converge]] to the same number, which we call the '''geometric–harmonic mean''' M(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'') of ''x'' and&amp;nbsp;''y''. The geometric–harmonic mean is also designated as the '''harmonic–geometric mean'''.&amp;nbsp;(cf. Wolfram MathWorld below.)

The existence of the limit can be proved by the means of [[Bolzano&amp;ndash;Weierstrass theorem]] in a manner almost identical to the proof of existence of [[arithmetic–geometric mean]].

==Properties==
M(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'') is a number between the geometric and harmonic mean of ''x'' and ''y''; in particular it is between ''x'' and ''y''. M(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'') is also [[Homogeneous function|homogeneous]], i.e. if ''r''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0, then M(''rx'',&amp;nbsp;''ry'') =&amp;nbsp;''r'' M(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'').

If AG(''x'', ''y'') is the [[arithmetic–geometric mean]], then we also have

:&lt;math&gt;M(x,y) = \frac{1}{AG(\frac{1}{x},\frac{1}{y})}&lt;/math&gt;

==Inequalities==
We have the following inequality involving the Pythagorean means {''H'',&amp;nbsp;''G'',&amp;nbsp;''A''} and iterated Pythagorean means {''HG'',&amp;nbsp;''HA'',&amp;nbsp;''GA''}:

:&lt;math&gt;\min(x,y) \leq H(x,y) \leq HG(x,y) \leq G(x,y) \leq GA(x,y) \leq A(x,y) \leq \max(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;

where the iterated Pythagorean means have been identified with their parts {''H'',&amp;nbsp;''G'',&amp;nbsp;''A''} in progressing order:

* ''H''(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'') is the harmonic mean,
* ''HG''(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'') is the harmonic–geometric mean,
* ''G''(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'') =&amp;nbsp;''HA''(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'') is the geometric mean (which is also the harmonic–arithmetic mean),
* ''GA''(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'') is the geometric–arithmetic mean,
* ''A''(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'') is the arithmetic mean.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3822">In [[first-order logic]], a '''Herbrand structure''' '''S''' is a structure over a vocabulary '''&amp;sigma;''', that is defined solely by the syntactical properties of  '''&amp;sigma;'''. The idea is to take the symbols of terms as their values, e.g. the denotation of a constant symbol c is just 'c' (the symbol).

Herbrand structures play an important role in the foundations of [[logic programming]].&lt;ref&gt;http://logic.stanford.edu/herbrand/herbrand.html&lt;/ref&gt;
==Herbrand universe==
===Definition===

''Herbrand universe'' will serve as the universe in ''Herbrand structure''.

(1) The ''Herbrand universe of a first-order language'' L&lt;sup&gt;&amp;sigma;&lt;/sup&gt;, is the set of all [[Ground_term|ground terms]] of L&lt;sup&gt;&amp;sigma;&lt;/sup&gt;. If the language has no constants, then the language is extended by adding an arbitrary new constant. 

* It is countably infinite if &amp;sigma; is countable and a function symbol of arity greater than 0 exists. 
* In the context of first-order languages we also speak simply of the ''Herbrand universe of the vocabulary &amp;sigma;''.

(2) The ''Herbrand universe of a closed formula in Skolem normal form'' F, is the set of all terms without variables, that can be constructed using the function symbols and constants of F. If F has no constants, then F is extended by adding an arbitrary new constant.

* This second definition is important in the context of computational resolution.

===Example===

Let L&lt;sup&gt;&amp;sigma;&lt;/sup&gt; be a first-order language with the vocabulary 
* constant symbols: c
* function symbols: f(.), g(.)
then the Herbrand universe of L&lt;sup&gt;&amp;sigma;&lt;/sup&gt; (or &amp;sigma;) is {c, f(c), g(c), f(f(c)), f(g(c)), g(f(c)), g(g(c)), ...}.

Notice that the relation symbols are not relevant for a Herbrand universe.

==Herbrand structure==
A ''Herbrand structure'' interprets terms on top of a ''Herbrand universe''.
===Definition===

Let '''S''' be a [[Structure (mathematical logic)|structure]], with vocabulary '''&amp;sigma;''' and universe ''U''. Let ''T'' be the set of all terms over '''&amp;sigma;''' and ''T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' be the subset of all variable-free terms. '''S''' is said to be a ''Herbrand structure'' iff
# ''U'' = ''T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''
# f&lt;sup&gt;'''S'''&lt;/sup&gt;(t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., t&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) = f(t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., t&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) for every n-ary function symbol f &amp;isin; '''&amp;sigma;''' and t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., t&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;isin; ''T''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;
# c&lt;sup&gt;'''S'''&lt;/sup&gt; = c for every constant c &amp;isin; '''&amp;sigma;'''

===Remarks===

# ''U'' is the Herbrand universe of '''&amp;sigma;'''.
# A Herbrand structure that is a model of a theory '''T''', is called the ''Herbrand model'' of '''T'''.
===Examples===

For a constant symbol c and a 1-ary function symbol f(.) we have the following interpretation:
* ''U'' = { c, fc, ffc, fffc, ...}
* fc -&gt; fc, ffc -&gt; ffc, ...
* c -&gt; c

==Herbrand base==
In addition to the universe, defined in ''Herbrand universe'', and the term denotations, defined in ''Herbrand structure'', the ''Herbrand base'' completes the interpretation by denoting the relation symbols.

===Definition===

A ''Herbrand base'' is the set of all ground atoms of whose argument terms are the Herbrand universe.

===Examples===

For a 2-ary relation symbol R, we get with the terms from above:

{ R(c, c), R(fc, c), R(c, fc), R(fc, fc), R(ffc, c), ...}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1064">In [[algebraic geometry]], an '''ind-scheme''' is a set-valued [[functor]] that can be written (represented) as a [[direct limit]] (i.e., inductive limit) of [[closed immersion|closed embedding]] of [[scheme (mathematics)|schemes]].

== Examples ==
*&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}P^{\infty} = \varinjlim \mathbb{C}P^N&lt;/math&gt; is an ind-scheme.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3985">In [[statistics]], the '''Johansen test''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Johansen |first=Søren |title=Estimation and Hypothesis Testing of Cointegration Vectors in Gaussian Vector Autoregressive Models |journal=[[Econometrica]] |volume=59 |issue=6 |year=1991 |pages=1551–1580 |jstor=2938278 }}&lt;/ref&gt; named after [[Søren Johansen]], is a procedure for testing [[cointegration]] of several, say ''k'', [[Order of integration|I(1)]] [[time series]]. For the presence of I(2) variables see Ch. 9 of his 1995 textbook.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BH7nCwAAQBAJ&amp;dq=Johansen+1995&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Likelihood-based Inference in Cointegrated Vector Autoregressive Models|last=Johansen|first=Søren|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1995|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This test permits more than one cointegrating relationship so is more generally applicable than the [[Engle–Granger test]] which is based on the [[Dickey–Fuller test|Dickey–Fuller]] (or the [[Augmented Dickey–Fuller test|augmented]]) test for [[unit root]]s in the residuals from a single (estimated) cointegrating relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Davidson |first=James |title=Econometric Theory|location= |publisher=Wiley |edition= |year=2000 |isbn=0-631-21584-0 |pages= |url={{Google books|shWtvsFbxlkC|Econometric Methods|page=|plainurl=yes}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two types of Johansen test, either with [[Trace (linear algebra)|trace]] or with [[eigenvalue]], and the inferences might be a little bit different. The null hypothesis for the trace test is that the number of cointegration vectors is ''r''=''r''*&lt;''k'', vs. the alternative that ''r''=''k''. Testing proceeds sequentially for ''r''*=1,2,etc. and the first non-rejection of the null is taken as an estimate of ''r''. The null hypothesis for the "maximum eigenvalue" test is as for the trace test but the alternative is ''r''=''r''*+1 and, again, testing proceeds sequentially for ''r''*=1,2,etc., with the first non-rejection used as an estimator for ''r''.

Just like a [[unit root test]], there can be a constant term, a trend term, both, or neither in the model.  For a general [[Vector autoregression|VAR]](''p'') model:

:&lt;math&gt;X_{t}=\mu+\Phi D_{t}+\Pi_{p}X_{t-p}+\cdots+\Pi_{1}X_{t-1}+e_{t},\quad t=1,\dots,T&lt;/math&gt;

There are two possible specifications for error correction: that is, two VECM (vector [[error correction model]]s):

1. The longrun VECM:
::&lt;math&gt;\Delta X_t =\mu+\Phi D_{t}+\Pi X_{t-p}+\Gamma_{p-1}\Delta X_{t-p+1}+\cdots+\Gamma_{1}\Delta X_{t-1}+\varepsilon_t,\quad t=1,\dots,T&lt;/math&gt;
:where
::&lt;math&gt;\Gamma_i = \Pi_1 + \cdots + \Pi_i - I,\quad i=1,\dots,p-1. \, &lt;/math&gt;

2. The transitory VECM:
::&lt;math&gt;\Delta X_{t}=\mu+\Phi  D_{t}-\Gamma_{p-1}\Delta X_{t-p+1}-\cdots-\Gamma_{1}\Delta X_{t-1}+\Pi X_{t-1}+\varepsilon_{t},\quad t=1,\cdots,T&lt;/math&gt;
:where
::&lt;math&gt;\Gamma_i = \left(\Pi_{i+1}+\cdots+\Pi_p\right),\quad i=1,\dots,p-1. \, &lt;/math&gt;

Be aware that the two are the same. In both VECM (Vector Error Correction Model),

: &lt;math&gt;\Pi=\Pi_{1}+\cdots+\Pi_{p}-I. \, &lt;/math&gt;

Inferences are drawn on Π, and they will be the same, so is the explanatory power.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5342">'''''L'''''-'''notation''' is an [[asymptotic analysis|asymptotic]] notation analogous to [[big-O notation]], denoted as &lt;math&gt;L_n[\alpha,c]&lt;/math&gt; for a [[bound variable]] &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; [[limit (mathematics)|tending to infinity]]. Like big-O notation, it is usually used to roughly convey the [[Computational complexity theory|computational complexity]] of a particular [[algorithm]].

==Definition==
It is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;L_n[\alpha,c]=e^{(c+o(1))(\ln n)^\alpha(\ln\ln n)^{1-\alpha}}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''c'' is a positive constant, and &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is a constant &lt;math&gt;0 \leq \alpha \leq 1&lt;/math&gt;.

L-notation is used mostly in [[computational number theory]], to express the complexity of algorithms for difficult [[number theory]] problems, e.g. sieves for [[integer factorization]] and methods for solving [[discrete logarithm]]s.  The benefit of this notation is that it simplifies the analysis of these algorithms.  The &lt;math&gt;e^{c(\ln n)^\alpha(\ln\ln n)^{1-\alpha}}&lt;/math&gt; expresses the dominant term, and the  &lt;math&gt;e^{o(1)(\ln n)^\alpha(\ln\ln n)^{1-\alpha}}&lt;/math&gt; takes care of everything smaller.
&lt;!-- Expand this, add some math and cites, and it may be a useful addition
Many advanced number theory algorithms have not been fully studied and not much is definitely known about their complexity and behaviour. The breadth of L-notation, allowing one to span polynomial to exponential growth rates, and its looseness, allowing theorems and heuristic analyses to be made more easily, have made its use popular in this relatively niche field.
--&gt;

When &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is 0, then

:&lt;math&gt;L_n[\alpha,c] = L_n[0, c] = e^{(c + o(1)) \ln\ln n} = (\ln n)^{c + o(1)}\,&lt;/math&gt;

is a [[polynomial function]] of ln&amp;nbsp;''n''; when &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is 1 then 

:&lt;math&gt;L_n[\alpha,c] = L_n[1, c] = e^{(c + o(1)) \ln n} = n^{c + o(1)}\,&lt;/math&gt;

is a fully [[exponential function]] of ln&amp;nbsp;''n'' (and thereby polynomial in ''n'').

If &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is between 0 and 1, the function is [[Sub-exponential time|subexponential]] of ln&amp;nbsp;''n'' (and [[superpolynomial]]).

==Examples==
Many general-purpose [[integer factorization]] algorithms have [[Time complexity#Sub-exponential time|subexponential time complexities]]. The best is the [[general number field sieve]], which has an expected running time of

:&lt;math&gt;L_n[1/3, c] = e^{(c+o(1))(\ln n)^{1/3}(\ln \ln n)^{2/3}}&lt;/math&gt;

for &lt;math&gt; c = (64/9)^{1/3} \approx 1.923&lt;/math&gt;.  The best such algorithm prior to the number field sieve was the [[quadratic sieve]] which has running time

:&lt;math&gt;L_n[1/2, 1] = e^{(1+o(1))(\ln n)^{1/2}(\ln \ln n)^{1/2}}.\,&lt;/math&gt;

For the [[elliptic curve]] [[discrete logarithm]] problem, the fastest general purpose algorithm is the [[baby-step giant-step]] algorithm, which has a running time on the order of the square-root of the group order ''n''.  In ''L''-notation this would be 

:&lt;math&gt;L_n[1, 1/2] = n^{1/2+o(1)}.\,&lt;/math&gt;

The existence of the [[AKS primality test]], which runs in [[polynomial time]], means that the time complexity for [[primality testing]] is known to be at most

:&lt;math&gt;L_n[0, c] = (\ln n)^{c+o(1)}\,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''c'' has been proven to be at most 6.&lt;ref&gt;Hendrik W. Lenstra Jr. and Carl Pomerance, "Primality testing with Gaussian periods", preprint, 2011, http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~carlp/aks041411.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

L-notation has been defined in various forms throughout the literature.  The first use of it came from [[Carl Pomerance]] in his paper "Analysis and comparison of some integer factoring algorithms".&lt;ref&gt;Carl Pomerance, "Analysis and comparison of some integer factoring algorithms", In Mathematisch Centrum Computational Methods in Number Theory, Part 1, pp. 89-139, 1982, http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~carlp/PDF/analysiscomparison.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  This form had only the &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; parameter: the &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; in the formula was &lt;math&gt;1/2&lt;/math&gt; for the algorithms he was analyzing.  Pomerance had been using the letter &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; (or lower case &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;) in this and previous papers for formulae that involved many logarithms.

The formula above involving two parameters was introduced by [[Arjen Lenstra]] and [[Hendrik Lenstra]] in their article on "Algorithms in Number Theory".&lt;ref&gt;Arjen K. Lenstra and Hendrik W. Lenstra, Jr, "Algorithms in Number Theory", in Handbook of Theoretical Computer Science (vol. A): Algorithms and Complexity, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was introduced in their analysis of a [[discrete logarithm]] algorithm of [[Don Coppersmith|Coppersmith]].  This is the most commonly used form in the literature today.

The Handbook of Applied Cryptography defines the L-notation with a big &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt; around the formula presented in this article.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred J. Menezes, Paul C. van Oorschot and Scott A. Vanstone. Handbook of Applied Cryptography. CRC Press, 1996. {{isbn|0-8493-8523-7}}. http://www.cacr.math.uwaterloo.ca/hac/.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is not the standard definition.  The big &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt; would suggest that the running time is an upper bound.  However, for the integer factoring and discrete logarithm algorithms that L-notation is commonly used for, the running time is not an upper bound, so this definition is not preferred.

In [[probability theory]], the '''law''' (or '''formula''') '''of total probability''' is a fundamental rule relating [[Marginal probability|marginal probabilities]] to [[conditional probabilities]]. It expresses the total probability of an outcome which can be realized via several distinct events—hence the name.

==Statement==
The law of total probability is&lt;ref name= ZK&gt;Zwillinger, D., Kokoska, S. (2000) ''CRC Standard Probability and Statistics Tables and Formulae'', CRC Press. {{isbn|1-58488-059-7}} page 31.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[proposition]] that if &lt;math&gt;\left\{{B_n : n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots}\right\}&lt;/math&gt; is a finite or [[Countable set|countably infinite]] [[partition of a set|partition]] of a [[sample space]] (in other words, a set of [[pairwise disjoint]] [[Event (probability theory)|event]]s whose [[union (set theory)|union]] is the entire sample space) and each event &lt;math&gt;B_n&lt;/math&gt; is [[measurable set|measurable]], then for any event &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; of the same [[probability space]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\Pr(A)=\sum_n \Pr(A\cap B_n)&lt;/math&gt;

or, alternatively,&lt;ref name=ZK/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Pr(A)=\sum_n \Pr(A\mid B_n)\Pr(B_n),&lt;/math&gt;

where, for any &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; for which &lt;math&gt;\Pr(B_n) = 0 &lt;/math&gt; these terms are simply omitted from the summation, because  &lt;math&gt;\Pr(A\mid B_n)&lt;/math&gt; is finite.

The summation can be interpreted as a [[weighted average]], and consequently the marginal probability, &lt;math&gt;\Pr(A)&lt;/math&gt;, is sometimes called "average probability";&lt;ref name="Pfeiffer1978"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul E. Pfeiffer|title=Concepts of probability theory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_mayRBczVRwC&amp;pg=PA47|year=1978|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|isbn=978-0-486-63677-1|pages=47–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; "overall probability" is sometimes used in less formal writings.&lt;ref name="Rumsey2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Deborah Rumsey|authorlink= Deborah J. Rumsey |title=Probability for dummies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vj3NZ59ZcnoC&amp;pg=PA58|year=2006|publisher=For Dummies|isbn=978-0-471-75141-0|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The law of total probability can also be stated for conditional probabilities. Taking the &lt;math&gt;B_n&lt;/math&gt; as above, and assuming &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is an event [[Independence (probability theory)|independent]] with any of the &lt;math&gt;B_n&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\Pr(A \mid C) = \sum_n \Pr(A \mid C \cap B_n) \Pr(B_n \mid C) = \sum_n \Pr(A \mid C \cap B_n) \Pr(B_n) &lt;/math&gt;

==Informal formulation==
The above mathematical statement might be interpreted as follows: ''given an outcome &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, with known conditional probabilities given any of the &lt;math&gt;B_n&lt;/math&gt; events, each with a known probability itself, what is the total probability that &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; will happen?'' The answer to this question is given by &lt;math&gt;\Pr(A)&lt;/math&gt;.

==Example==
Suppose that two factories supply [[light bulb]]s to the market. Factory ''X''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s bulbs work for over 5000 hours in 99% of cases, whereas factory ''Y''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s bulbs work for over 5000 hours in 95% of cases. It is known that factory ''X'' supplies 60% of the total bulbs available and Y supplies 40% of the total bulbs available. What is the chance that a purchased bulb will work for longer than 5000 hours?

Applying the law of total probability, we have:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\Pr(A) &amp; = \Pr(A\mid B_X) \cdot \Pr(B_X) + \Pr(A\mid B_Y) \cdot \Pr(B_Y) \\[4pt]
&amp; = {99 \over 100} \cdot {6 \over 10} + {95 \over 100} \cdot {4 \over 10} = {{594 + 380} \over 1000} = {974 \over 1000}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where
* &lt;math&gt;\Pr(B_X)={6 \over 10}&lt;/math&gt; is the probability that the purchased bulb was manufactured by factory ''X'';
* &lt;math&gt;\Pr(B_Y)={4 \over 10}&lt;/math&gt; is the probability that the purchased bulb was manufactured by factory ''Y'';
* &lt;math&gt;\Pr(A\mid B_X)={99 \over 100}&lt;/math&gt; is the probability that a bulb manufactured by ''X'' will work for over 5000 hours;
* &lt;math&gt;\Pr(A\mid B_Y)={95 \over 100}&lt;/math&gt; is the probability that a bulb manufactured by ''Y'' will work for over 5000 hours.

Thus each purchased light bulb has a 97.4% chance to work for more than 5000 hours.

==Other names==
The term '''''law of total probability''''' is sometimes taken to mean the '''law of alternatives''', which is a special case of the law of total probability applying to [[discrete random variable]]s.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} One author even uses the terminology "continuous law of alternatives" in the continuous case.&lt;ref name="Baclawski2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kenneth Baclawski|title=Introduction to probability with R|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Kglc9g5IPf4C&amp;pg=PA179|year=2008|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4200-6521-3|page=179}}&lt;/ref&gt; This result is given by Grimmett and Welsh&lt;ref&gt;''Probability: An Introduction'', by [[Geoffrey Grimmett]] and [[Dominic Welsh]], Oxford Science Publications, 1986, Theorem 1B.&lt;/ref&gt;  as the '''partition theorem''', a name that they also give to the related [[law of total expectation]].

'''Lodovico de Ferrari''' (2 February 1522 &amp;ndash; 5 October 1565) was an [[Italians|Italian]] [[mathematician]].

Born in [[Bologna, Italy]], Lodovico's grandfather, [[Bartholomew de Ferrari]], was forced out of Milan to Bologna. Lodovico settled in [[Bologna, Italy]] and he began his career as the servant of [[Gerolamo Cardano]].  He was extremely bright, so Cardano started teaching him mathematics.  Ferrari aided Cardano on his solutions for [[quadratic equations]] and [[cubic equation]]s, and was mainly responsible for the solution of [[quartic equation]]s that Cardano published. While still in his teens, Ferrari was able to obtain a prestigious teaching post in Rome after Cardano resigned from it and recommended him.  Ferrari retired when young at 42 years old, and wealthy. He then moved back to his home town of Bologna where he lived with his widowed sister Maddalena to take up a professorship of mathematics at the University of Bologna in 1565. Shortly thereafter, he died of white [[arsenic]] poisoning, according to a legend - because of his sisters.&lt;ref name="ShuchatGindikin2007"&gt;Alan Shuchat; Simon Gindikin.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7056">In [[graph theory]], the '''Lovász conjecture''' (1969) is a classical problem on [[Hamiltonian path]]s in graphs. It says:
: Every finite connected [[vertex-transitive graph]] contains a [[Hamiltonian path]].
Originally [[László Lovász]] stated the problem in the opposite way, but
this version became standard.  In 1996 [[László Babai]] published a conjecture sharply contradicting this conjecture,&lt;ref&gt;[[László Babai]], [http://www.cs.uchicago.edu/research/publications/techreports/TR-94-10 Automorphism groups, isomorphism, reconstruction], in ''Handbook of Combinatorics'', Vol. 2, Elsevier, 1996, 1447-1540.&lt;/ref&gt; but both conjectures remain widely open. It is not even known if a single counterexample would necessarily lead to a series of counterexamples.  

== Historical remarks ==
The problem of finding Hamiltonian paths in highly symmetric graphs is quite old. As [[Donald Knuth]] describes it in volume 4 of ''[[The Art of Computer Programming]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Knuth|Donald E. Knuth]], [[The Art of Computer Programming]], Vol. 4, draft of section 7.2.1.2.&lt;/ref&gt; the problem originated in [[United Kingdom|British]] [[change ringing|campanology]] (bell-ringing). Such Hamiltonian paths and cycles are also closely connected to [[Gray code]]s. In each case the constructions are explicit.

== Variants of the Lovász conjecture ==
=== Hamiltonian cycle ===
Another version of '''Lovász conjecture''' states that
: ''Every finite connected [[vertex-transitive graph]] contains a Hamiltonian cycle'' except the five known counterexamples.

There are 5 known examples of vertex-transitive graphs with no Hamiltonian cycles (but with Hamiltonian paths): the [[complete graph]] &lt;math&gt;K_2&lt;/math&gt;, the [[Petersen graph]], the [[Coxeter graph]] and two graphs derived from the Petersen and Coxeter graphs by replacing each vertex with a triangle.&lt;ref&gt;Royle, Gordon [http://www.cs.uwa.edu.au/~gordon/remote/foster/#census "Cubic Symmetric Graphs (The Foster Census)."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720005020/http://www.cs.uwa.edu.au/~gordon/remote/foster/ |date=2008-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cayley graphs===
None of the 5 vertex-transitive graphs with no Hamiltonian cycles is a Cayley graph. This observation leads to a weaker version of the conjecture:
: ''Every finite connected [[Cayley graph]] contains a Hamiltonian cycle''.

The advantage of the Cayley graph formulation is that such graphs correspond to a [[finite group]] &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and a
[[Generating set of a group|generating set]] &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;. Thus one can ask for which &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; the conjecture holds rather than attack it in full generality.

===Directed Cayley graph===
For directed Cayley graphs (digraphs) the Lovász conjecture is false. Various counterexamples were obtained by [[Robert Alexander Rankin]].  Still, many of the below results hold in this restrictive setting.

==Special cases==
[[File:Steinhaus-Johnson-Trotter-Permutohedron.svg|thumb|A Hamiltonian path in the [[permutohedron]], a Cayley graph of the symmetric group with Coxeter generators]]
Every directed Cayley graph of an [[abelian group]] has a Hamiltonian path; however, every cyclic group whose order is not a prime power has a directed Cayley graph that does not have a Hamiltonian cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

In 1986,  D. Witte proved that the Lovász conjecture holds for the Cayley graphs of [[p-group]]s.  It is open even for [[dihedral group]]s, although for special sets of generators some progress has been made.

When group &lt;math&gt;G = S_n&lt;/math&gt; is a [[symmetric group]], there are many attractive generating sets.  For example, the Lovász conjecture holds in the following cases of generating sets:
* &lt;math&gt;a = (1,2,\dots,n), b = (1,2)&lt;/math&gt; (long cycle and a [[Transposition (mathematics)|transposition]]).
* &lt;math&gt;s_1 = (1,2), s_2 = (2,3), \dots, s_{n-1} = (n-1,n)&lt;/math&gt; ([[Coxeter group|Coxeter generators]]). In this case a Hamiltonian cycle is generated by the [[Steinhaus–Johnson–Trotter algorithm]].
* any set of transpositions corresponding to a [[Tree (graph theory)|labelled tree]] on &lt;math&gt;\{1,2,..,n\}&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;a =(1,2), b = (1,2)(3,4)\cdots, c = (2,3)(4,5)\cdots&lt;/math&gt;

Stong has shown that the conjecture holds for the Cayley graph of the [[wreath product]] '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;wr&amp;nbsp;'''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; with the natural minimal generating set when ''m'' is either even or three. In particular this holds for the [[cube-connected cycles]], which can be generated as the Cayley graph of the wreath product '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;wr&amp;nbsp;'''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==General groups==
For general finite groups, only a few results are known:
* &lt;math&gt;S=\{a,b\}, (ab)^2=1&lt;/math&gt; ([[Robert Alexander Rankin|Rankin]] generators)
* &lt;math&gt;S=\{a,b,c\}, a^2= b^2=c^2=[a,b]=1&lt;/math&gt; ([[Rapaport–Strasser]] generators)
* &lt;math&gt;S=\{a,b,c\}, a^2=1, c = a^{-1}ba&lt;/math&gt; ([[Igor Pak|Pak]]–[[Radoš Radoičić|Radoičić]] generators&lt;ref&gt;[[Igor Pak]], [[Radoš Radoičić]], [http://www.math.ucla.edu/~pak/papers/hamcayley9.pdf Hamiltonian paths in Cayley graphs], 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;)
* &lt;math&gt;S=\{a,b\}, a^2 = b^s =(ab)^3 = 1, &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;|G|,s = 2~mod ~4&lt;/math&gt; (here we have (2,s,3)-[[Presentation of a group|presentation]], Glover–Marušič theorem&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=Henry H.|last1=Glover|first2=Dragan |last2=Marušič |arxiv=math/0508647|title= Hamiltonicity of cubic Cayley graphs|
journal=[[Journal of the European Mathematical Society ]]| volume=9 |year=2007|issue= 4|pages= 775–787|doi=10.4171/JEMS/96|mr=2341831}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Finally, it is known that for every finite group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; there exists a generating set of size at most &lt;math&gt;\log_2 |G|&lt;/math&gt; such that the corresponding Cayley graph is Hamiltonian (Pak-Radoičić). This result is based on [[classification of finite simple groups]].

The Lovász conjecture was also established for random generating sets of size &lt;math&gt;\Omega(\log^5 |G|)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Krivelevich|first1=Michael|authorlink1=Michael Krivelevich|last2=Sudakov|first2=Benny|authorlink2=Benny Sudakov|title=Sparse pseudo-random graphs are Hamiltonian|journal=Journal of Graph Theory|date=2003|volume=42|pages=17–33|doi=10.1002/jgt.10065}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lustre''' is a [[Formal methods|formally defined]], [[Declarative programming language|declarative]], and [[Synchronous programming language|synchronous]] [[dataflow programming]] language for programming reactive systems. It began as a research project in the early 1980s. A formal presentation of the language can be found in the 1991 Proceedings of the IEEE.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.i6.in.tum.de/pub/Main/TeachingWs2009Echtzeitsysteme/procieee1991-3.pdf] N. Halbwachs et al. ''The Synchronous Data Flow Programming Language LUSTRE.'' In Proc. IEEE 1991 Vol. 79, No. 9. Accessed 17 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993 it progressed to practical, industrial use in a commercial product as the core language of the industrial environment [[SCADE]], developed by [[Esterel Technologies]]. It is now used for critical control software in [[Airbus|aircraft]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SCADE Success Stories|url=http://www.esterel-technologies.com/success-stories/|accessdate=8 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eurocopter Group|helicopters]], and [[nuclear power plants]].

==Structure of Lustre programs==

A Lustre program is a series of ''node'' definitions, written as:
 node foo(a : bool) returns (b : bool);
 let
   b = not a;
 tel

Where &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt; is the name of the node, &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; is the name of the single input of this node and &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; is the name of the single output.
In this example the node &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt; returns the negation of its input &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;, which is the expected result.

===Inner variables===
Additional internal variables can be declared as follow: 
  node Nand(X,Y: bool) returns (Z: bool);
    var U: bool;
  let
    U = X and Y;
    Z = not U;
  tel
Note: The equations order doesn't matter, the order of lines &lt;code&gt;U = X and Y;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Z = not U;&lt;/code&gt; doesn't change the result.

===Special operators===
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| &lt;code&gt;pre&lt;/code&gt; ''p'' || Returns the previous value of ''p''
|-
| ''p'' &lt;code&gt;-&gt;&lt;/code&gt; ''q'' || Set ''p'' as the initial value of the expression ''q''
|-
|}

==Examples==

===Edge detection===
 node Edge (X : bool) returns (E : bool);
 let
   E = false -&gt; X and not pre X;
 tel

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2348">In [[mathematics]], '''Maclaurin's inequality''', named after [[Colin Maclaurin]], is a refinement of the [[inequality of arithmetic and geometric means]]. 

Let ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; be [[positive number|positive]] [[real number]]s, and for ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''n'' define the averages ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; as follows:

:&lt;math&gt; S_k = \frac{\displaystyle \sum_{ 1\leq i_1 &lt; \cdots &lt; i_k \leq n}a_{i_1} a_{i_2} \cdots a_{i_k}}{\displaystyle {n \choose k}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The numerator of this fraction is the [[elementary symmetric polynomial]] of degree ''k'' in the ''n'' variables ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, that is, the sum of all products of ''k'' of the numbers ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; with the indices in increasing order. The denominator is the number of terms in the numerator, the [[binomial coefficient]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle {n\choose k}.&lt;/math&gt;

Maclaurin's inequality is the following chain of [[inequality (mathematics)|inequalities]]:

:&lt;math&gt; S_1 \geq \sqrt{S_2} \geq \sqrt[3]{S_3} \geq \cdots \geq \sqrt[n]{S_n}&lt;/math&gt;

with equality if and only if all the ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are equal.

For ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2, this gives the usual inequality of arithmetic and geometric means of two numbers. Maclaurin's inequality is well illustrated by the case ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; {} \quad \frac{a_1+a_2+a_3+a_4}{4} \\[8pt]
&amp; {} \ge \sqrt{\frac{a_1a_2+a_1a_3+a_1a_4+a_2a_3+a_2a_4+a_3a_4}{6}} \\[8pt]
&amp; {} \ge \sqrt[3]{\frac{a_1a_2a_3+a_1a_2a_4+a_1a_3a_4+a_2a_3a_4}{4}} \\[8pt]
&amp; {} \ge \sqrt[4]{a_1a_2a_3a_4}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Maclaurin's inequality can be proved using the [[Newton's inequalities]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5595">In [[Euclidean geometry]], '''Musselman's theorem''' is a property of certain [[circle (geometry)|circle]]s defined by an arbitrary [[triangle]].

[[File:Musselman theorem.svg|thumb|400px]]

Specifically, let &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; be a triangle, and &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; its [[vertex (geometry)|vertices]].  Let &lt;math&gt;A^*&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;B^*&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;C^*&lt;/math&gt; be the vertices of the [[reflection triangle]] &lt;math&gt;T^*&lt;/math&gt;, obtained by mirroring each vertex of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; across the opposite side.&lt;ref name=grinberg/&gt;  Let &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt; be the [[circumcenter]] of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;.  Consider the three circles &lt;math&gt;S_A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;S_B&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;S_C&lt;/math&gt; defined by the points &lt;math&gt;A\,O\,A^*&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;B\,O\,B^*&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;C\,O\,C^*&lt;/math&gt;, respectively.  The theorem says that these three '''Musselman circles''' meet in a point &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, that is the [[circle inversion|inverse]] with respect to the circumcenter of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; of the [[isogonal conjugate]] or the [[nine-point center]] of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=wolfram/&gt;

The common point &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Gilbert point]] of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, which is point &lt;math&gt;X_{1157}&lt;/math&gt; in [[Kimberling center|Clark Kimberling's list]] of [[triangle center]]s.&lt;ref name=wolfram/&gt;&lt;ref name=kimberlingX1157/&gt;

== History ==
The theorem was proposed as an advanced problem by [[John Rogers Musselman]] and [[René Goormaghtigh]] in 1939,&lt;ref name=muss1939/&gt; and a proof was presented by them in 1941.&lt;ref name=muss1941/&gt;  A generalization of this result was stated and proved by Goormaghtigh.&lt;ref name=ayme/&gt;

== Goormaghtigh’s generalization ==
The generalization of Musselman's theorem by Goormaghtigh does not mention the circles explicitly.

As before, let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; be the vertices of a triangle &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt; its circumcenter.  Let &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; be the [[orthocenter]] of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, that is, the intersection of its three [[altitude (triangle)|altitude lines]].  Let &lt;math&gt;A'&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;B'&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;C'&lt;/math&gt; be three points on the segments &lt;math&gt;OA&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;OB&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;OC&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;OA'/OA=OB'/OB=OC'/OC = t&lt;/math&gt;.  Consider the three lines &lt;math&gt;L_A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;L_B&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;L_C&lt;/math&gt;, perpendicular to &lt;math&gt;OA&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;OB&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;OC&lt;/math&gt; though the points  &lt;math&gt;A'&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;B'&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;C'&lt;/math&gt;, respectively. Let &lt;math&gt;P_A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;P_B&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;P_C&lt;/math&gt; be the intersections of these perpendicular with the lines &lt;math&gt;BC&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;CA&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;AB&lt;/math&gt;, respectively.

It had been observed by [[Joseph Jean Baptiste Neuberg|Joseph Neuberg]], in 1884, that the three points &lt;math&gt;P_A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;P_B&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;P_C&lt;/math&gt; lie on a common line &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=neuberg1884/&gt;  Let &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; be the projection of the circumcenter &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt; on the line &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;N'&lt;/math&gt; the point on &lt;math&gt;ON&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;ON'/ON = t&lt;/math&gt;.  Goormaghtigh proved that &lt;math&gt;N'&lt;/math&gt; is the inverse with respect to the circumcircle of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; of the isogonal conjugate of the point &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; on the [[Euler line]] &lt;math&gt;OH&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;QH/QO = 2t&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=nguyen2005/&gt;&lt;ref name=barbu2012/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7812">The '''one-way''' or '''measurement based quantum computer''' ('''MBQC''') is a method of [[quantum computing]] that first prepares an [[Quantum entanglement|entangled]] ''resource state'', usually a [[cluster state]] or [[graph state]], then performs single [[qubit]] measurements on it.  It is "one-way" because the resource state is destroyed by the measurements.

The outcome of each individual measurement is random, but they are related in such a way that the computation always succeeds.  In general the choices of [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]] for later measurements need to depend on the results of earlier measurements, and hence the measurements cannot all be performed at the same time.

==Equivalence to quantum circuit model==
Any one-way computation can be made into a [[quantum circuit]] by using [[quantum gate]]s to prepare the resource state.  For cluster and graph resource states, this requires only one two-qubit gate per bond, so is efficient.

Conversely, any quantum circuit can be simulated by a one-way computer using a two-dimensional cluster state as the resource state, by laying out the circuit diagram on the cluster; Z measurements (&lt;math&gt;\{|0\rangle,|1\rangle\}&lt;/math&gt; basis) remove physical qubits from the cluster, while measurements in the X-Y plane (&lt;math&gt;|0\rangle\pm e^{i\theta}|1\rangle&lt;/math&gt; basis) [[Quantum teleportation|teleport]] the logical qubits along the "wires" and perform the required quantum gates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=R. Raussendorf |author2=D. E. Browne |author3=H. J. Briegel  |last-author-amp=yes | title=Measurement based Quantum Computation on Cluster States| journal=Phys. Rev. A| year=2003| volume=68 | issue=2 | pages=022312 |arxiv=quant-ph/0301052|doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.68.022312|bibcode = 2003PhRvA..68b2312R }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is also polynomially efficient, as the required size of cluster scales as the size of the circuit (qubits x timesteps), while the number of measurement timesteps scales as the number of circuit timesteps.

==Topological cluster state quantum computer==
Measurement-based computation on a periodic 3D lattice cluster  state can be used to implement topological quantum error correction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Robert Raussendorf |author2=Jim Harrington |author3=Kovid Goyal | title=Topological fault-tolerance in cluster state quantum computation | journal=New Journal of Physics | volume=9 | pages=199 | year=2007 |arxiv = quant-ph/0703143 |bibcode = 2007NJPh....9..199R |doi = 10.1088/1367-2630/9/6/199 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Topological cluster state computation is closely related to Kitaev's [[toric code]], as the 3D topological cluster state can be constructed and measured over time by a repeated sequence of gates on a 2D array.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Robert Raussendorf |author2=Jim Harrington | title=Fault-tolerant quantum computation with high threshold in two dimensions | journal=Phys. Rev. Lett. | volume=98 | pages=190504 | year=2007 | arxiv=quant-ph/0610082| doi=10.1103/physrevlett.98.190504 | pmid=17677613| bibcode=2007PhRvL..98s0504R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementations==
One-way quantum computation has been demonstrated by running the 2 qubit [[Grover's algorithm]] on a 2x2 cluster state of photons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=P. Walther, K. J. Resch, T.

Cluster states have also been created in [[optical lattice]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Olaf Mandel |author2=Markus Greiner |author3=Artur Widera |author4=Tim Rom |author5=Theodor W. Hänsch |author6=Immanuel Bloch | title=Controlled collisions for multi-particle entanglement of optically trapped atoms| journal=Nature| year=2003| volume=425 | pages=937–40|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v425/n6961/full/nature02008.html|doi=10.1038/nature02008 | pmid=14586463 | issue=6961|arxiv = quant-ph/0308080 |bibcode = 2003Natur.425..937M }}&lt;/ref&gt; but were not used for computation as the atom qubits were too close together to measure individually.

==AKLT state as a resource ==
It has been shown that the ([[spin (physics)|spin]] &lt;math&gt; \tfrac{3}{2}&lt;/math&gt;) [[AKLT]] state on a 2D [[Honeycomb lattice]] can be used as a resource for MBQC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Tzu-Chieh Wei |author2=Ian Affleck |author3=Robert Raussendorf  |last-author-amp=yes | title=Two-dimensional Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki state on the honeycomb lattice is a universal resource for quantum computation|journal=PRA| year=2012| volume=86| issue=032328 | url=http://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.86.032328| arxiv=1009.2840| doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.86.032328 |bibcode=2012PhRvA..86c2328W}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Akimasa Miyake | title=Quantum computational capability of a 2D valence bond solid phase | journal=Annals of Physics| year=2011| volume=236| issue=7| pages=1656–1671| url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003491611000455| arxiv=1009.3491 | doi=10.1016/j.aop.2011.03.006| bibcode=2011AnPhy.326.1656M}}&lt;/ref&gt;
More recently it has been shown that a spin-mixture AKLT state can be used as a resource.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Spin mixture AKLT states for universal quantum computation| arxiv=1310.5100|author1=Tzu-Chieh Wei |author2=Poya Haghnegahdar |author3=Robert Raussendorf |bibcode=2014PhRvA..90d2333W|doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.90.042333}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4345">An [[incidence structure]] &lt;math&gt;C=(P,L,I)&lt;/math&gt; consists of points &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, lines &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;, and flags &lt;math&gt;I \subseteq P \times L&lt;/math&gt; where a point &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is said to be incident with a line &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;(p,l) \in I&lt;/math&gt;. It is a ([[Wikt:finite|finite]]) '''partial geometry''' if there are [[integer]]s &lt;math&gt;s,t,\alpha\geq 1&lt;/math&gt; such that:

* For any pair of distinct points &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;, there is at most one line incident with both of them.
* Each line is incident with &lt;math&gt;s+1&lt;/math&gt; points.
* Each point is incident with &lt;math&gt;t+1&lt;/math&gt; lines.
* If a point &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and a line &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; are not incident, there are exactly &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; pairs &lt;math&gt;(q,m)\in I&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is incident with &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is incident with &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;.

A partial geometry with these parameters is denoted by &lt;math&gt;pg(s,t,\alpha)&lt;/math&gt;.

==Properties==
* The number of points is given by &lt;math&gt;\frac{(s+1)(s t+\alpha)}{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; and the number of lines by &lt;math&gt;\frac{(t+1)(s t+\alpha)}{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;.
* The point graph (also known as the [[Collinearity#Collinearity graph|collinearity graph]]) of a &lt;math&gt;pg(s,t,\alpha)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[strongly regular graph]]: &lt;math&gt;srg((s+1)\frac{(s t+\alpha)}{\alpha},s(t+1),s-1+t(\alpha-1),\alpha(t+1))&lt;/math&gt;.
* Partial geometries are dual structures: the dual of a &lt;math&gt;pg(s,t,\alpha)&lt;/math&gt; is simply a &lt;math&gt;pg(t,s,\alpha)&lt;/math&gt;.

==Special case==
* The [[generalized quadrangle]]s are exactly those partial geometries &lt;math&gt;pg(s,t,\alpha)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\alpha=1&lt;/math&gt;.
* The [[Steiner system]]s are precisely those partial geometries &lt;math&gt;pg(s,t,\alpha)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\alpha=s+1&lt;/math&gt;.

==Generalisations==
A [[partial linear space]] &lt;math&gt;S=(P,L,I)&lt;/math&gt; of order &lt;math&gt;s, t&lt;/math&gt; is called a semipartial geometry if there are [[integer]]s &lt;math&gt;\alpha\geq 1, \mu&lt;/math&gt; such that:

* If a point &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and a line &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; are not incident, there are either &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; or exactly &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; pairs &lt;math&gt;(q,m)\in I&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is incident with &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is incident with &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt;.
* Every pair of non-collinear points have exactly &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; common neighbours.

A semipartial geometry is a partial geometry if and only if &lt;math&gt;\mu = \alpha(t+1)&lt;/math&gt;.

It can be easily shown that the collinearity graph of such a geometry is strongly regular with parameters 
&lt;math&gt;(1 + s(t + 1) +  s(t+1)t(s - \alpha + 1)/\mu, s(t+1), s - 1 + t(\alpha - 1), \mu)&lt;/math&gt;.

A nice example of such a geometry is obtained by taking the affine points of &lt;math&gt;PG(3, q^2)&lt;/math&gt; and only those lines that intersect the plane at infinity in a point of a fixed Baer subplane; it has parameters &lt;math&gt;(s, t, \alpha, \mu) = (q^2 - 1, q^2 + q, q, q(q + 1))&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Pierre Samuel''' (12 September 1921&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;{{MacTutor Biography|id=Samuel}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; 23 August 2009&lt;ref name="obit"&gt; Obituary of Pierre Samuel (LeMonde)  [http://www.lemonde.fr/carnet/article/2009/08/28/pierre-samuel-mathematicien_1232920_3382.html]&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[France|French]] [[mathematician]], known for his work in [[commutative algebra]] and its applications to [[algebraic geometry]]. The two-volume work ''Commutative Algebra'' that he wrote with [[Oscar Zariski]] is a classic. Other books of his covered [[projective geometry]] and [[algebraic number theory]]. 

==Career==
Samuel ran a [[Paris]] seminar during the 1960s, and became Professeur émérite at the [[Université Paris-Sud]] (Orsay). His lectures on unique factorization domains published by the [[Tata Institute of Fundamental Research]] played a significant role in computing the [[Picard group]] of a [[Zariski surface]] via the work of  Jeffrey Lang and collaborators. The method was inspired by earlier work of [[Nathan Jacobson]] and [[Pierre Cartier (mathematician)|Pierre Cartier]] another outstanding member of the [[Bourbaki group]]. [[Nick Katz|Nicholas Katz]] related this to the concept of ''p''-curvature of a connection introduced by [[Alexander Grothendieck]].

He was a member of the [[Bourbaki group]], and filmed some of their meetings. A French television documentary on Bourbaki broadcast some of this footage in 2000.

Samuel was also active in issues of [[social justice]], including concerns about [[Environment (biophysical)|environmental]] degradation (where he was influenced by Grothendieck), and [[arms control]].&lt;ref name="amsletter"&gt; Pierre Samuel Letter to the American Mathematical Society [http://www.ams.org/notices/200503/commentary.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; He died in Paris in August 2009.&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt;

His doctoral students include [[Lucien Szpiro]] and [[Daniel Lazard]].

==Awards and honors==
In 1958 he was an invited speaker (''Relations d'équivalence en géométrie algébrique'') at the [[International Congress of Mathematicians|ICM]] in [[Edinburgh]]. In 1969 he won the [[Lester R. Ford Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Samuel, Pierre|title=Unique Factorization|journal=Amer. Math.

[[Image:2-adic integers with dual colorings.svg|thumb|300px|The [[p-adic integer|2-adic integers]], with selected corresponding characters on [[Prüfer group|their Pontryagin dual group]]]]

In mathematics, specifically in [[harmonic analysis]] and the theory of [[topological group]]s, '''Pontryagin duality''' explains the general properties of the [[Fourier transform]] on [[locally compact group|locally compact abelian groups]], such as &lt;math&gt;\R&lt;/math&gt;, the [[circle group|circle]], or [[finite cyclic group]]s. The '''Pontryagin duality theorem''' itself states that locally compact [[Abelian group|abelian groups]] identify naturally with their [[Dual space#Double dual|bidual]].

The subject is named after [[Lev Semenovich Pontryagin]] who laid down the foundations for the theory of locally compact abelian groups and their duality during his early mathematical works in 1934. Pontryagin's treatment relied on the group being [[second-countable space|second-countable]] and either compact or discrete. This was improved to cover the general locally compact abelian groups by [[Egbert van Kampen]] in 1935 and [[André Weil]] in 1940.

==Introduction==
Pontryagin duality places in a unified context a number of observations about functions on the real line or on finite abelian groups:

* Suitably regular complex-valued [[periodic function]]s on the real line have [[Fourier series]] and these functions can be recovered from their Fourier series;
* Suitably regular complex-valued functions on the real line have Fourier transforms that are also functions on the real line and, just as for periodic functions, these functions can be recovered from their Fourier transforms; and
* Complex-valued functions on a [[abelian group#Finite_abelian_groups|finite abelian group]] have [[discrete Fourier transform]]s which are functions on the [[#The dual group|dual group]], which is a (non-canonically) isomorphic group. Moreover, any function on a finite group can be recovered from its discrete Fourier transform.

The theory, introduced by [[Lev Pontryagin]] and combined with [[Haar measure]] introduced by [[John von Neumann]], [[André Weil]] and others depends on the theory of the [[#The dual group|dual group]] of a [[Locally compact space|locally compact]] abelian group.

It is analogous to the [[dual vector space]] of a vector space: a finite-dimensional vector space ''V'' and its dual vector space ''V*'' are not naturally isomorphic, but their [[endomorphism]] algebras (matrix algebras) are: &lt;math&gt;\text{End}(V) \cong \text{End}(V^*),&lt;/math&gt; via the transpose. Similarly, a group ''G'' and its dual group &lt;math&gt;\widehat{G}&lt;/math&gt; are not in general isomorphic, but their [[group algebra]]s are: &lt;math&gt;C(G) \cong C(\widehat{G})&lt;/math&gt; via the Fourier transform, though one must carefully define these algebras analytically. More categorically, this is not just an isomorphism of endomorphism algebras, but an isomorphism of categories – see [[#Categorical considerations|categorical considerations]].

==Locally compact abelian groups==

A [[topological group]] is called ''[[locally compact group|locally compact]]'' if the underlying topological space is [[locally compact space|locally compact]] and [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]]. It's called ''abelian'' if the underlying group is [[abelian group|abelian]].

===Examples===

Examples of locally compact [[abelian group|abelian]] groups are:

* &lt;math&gt;\R^n&lt;/math&gt; for ''n'' a positive integer,  with vector addition as group operation.
*  The [[positive real numbers]] &lt;math&gt;\R^+&lt;/math&gt; with multiplication as operation.  This group is isomorphic to &lt;math&gt;(\R, +)&lt;/math&gt; by the exponential map.
* Any finite abelian group, with the [[discrete topology]].  By the [[structure theorem for finite abelian groups]], all such groups are products of cyclic groups.
* The integers &lt;math&gt;\Z&lt;/math&gt; under addition, again with the discrete topology.
* The [[circle group]], denoted &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}&lt;/math&gt; for [[torus]]. This is the group of complex numbers of [[absolute value|modulus]] 1. &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}&lt;/math&gt; is isomorphic as a topological group to the [[quotient group]] &lt;math&gt;\R/\Z&lt;/math&gt;.
* The field &lt;math&gt;\Q_p&lt;/math&gt; of [[p-adic number|''p''-adic number]]s under addition, with the usual ''p''-adic topology.

===The dual group===

If &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is a locally compact ''abelian'' group, a [[Character (mathematics)|character]] of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is  a [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] [[group homomorphism]] from &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; with values in the [[circle group]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}&lt;/math&gt;.  The set of all characters on &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; can be made into a locally compact abelian group, called the ''dual group'' of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and denoted &lt;math&gt;\widehat G&lt;/math&gt;. The group operation on the dual group is given by pointwise multiplication of characters, the inverse of a character is its complex conjugate and the [[topology]] on the space of characters is that of [[uniform convergence]] on [[compact set]]s (i.e., the [[compact-open topology]], viewing &lt;math&gt;\widehat{G}&lt;/math&gt; as a subset of the space of all continuous functions from &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}&lt;/math&gt;.).  This topology in general is not metrizable.  However, if the group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is a [[separable space|separable]] locally compact abelian group, then the dual group is metrizable.

This is analogous to the [[dual space]] in linear algebra: just as for a vector space &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; over a field &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;, the dual space is &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Hom}(V, K)&lt;/math&gt;, so too is the dual group &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Hom}(G, \mathbb{T})&lt;/math&gt;. More abstractly, these are both examples of [[representable functor]]s, being represented respectively by &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}&lt;/math&gt;.

A group that is isomorphic (as topological groups) to its dual group is called ''self-dual''. While the [[real numbers|reals]] and finite [[cyclic group]]s are self-dual, the group and the dual group are not ''naturally'' isomorphic, and should be thought of as two different groups.

====Examples of dual groups====

The dual of &lt;math&gt;\Z&lt;/math&gt; is isomorphic to the circle group &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}&lt;/math&gt;. A character on the [[infinite cyclic group]] of integers &lt;math&gt;\Z&lt;/math&gt; under addition is determined by its value at the generator 1. Thus for any character &lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\Z&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\chi(n) = \chi(1)^n&lt;/math&gt;.  Moreover, this formula defines a character for any choice of &lt;math&gt;\chi(1)&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}&lt;/math&gt;.  The topology of uniform convergence on compact sets is in this case the topology of [[pointwise convergence]].  This is the topology of the circle group inherited from the complex numbers.

The dual of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}&lt;/math&gt; is canonically isomorphic with &lt;math&gt;\Z&lt;/math&gt;. Indeed, a character on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}&lt;/math&gt; is of the form &lt;math&gt;z\mapsto z^n&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; an integer.  Since &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}&lt;/math&gt; is compact, the topology on the dual group is that of uniform convergence, which turns out to be the [[discrete topology]].

The group of real numbers &lt;math&gt;\R&lt;/math&gt;, is isomorphic to its own dual; the characters on &lt;math&gt;\R&lt;/math&gt; are of the form &lt;math&gt;r\mapsto e^{i\theta r}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; a real number.  With these dualities, the version of the Fourier transform to be introduced next coincides with the classical [[Fourier transform]] on &lt;math&gt;\R&lt;/math&gt;.

Analogously, the group of &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;-adic numbers &lt;math&gt;\Q_p&lt;/math&gt; is isomorphic to its dual. (In fact, any finite extension of &lt;math&gt;\Q_p&lt;/math&gt; is also self-dual.) It follows that the [[adele ring|adele]]s are self-dual.

==The Pontryagin duality theorem==

:'''Theorem.''' There is a canonical isomorphism  &lt;math&gt;G\cong\widehat{\widehat{G}}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; between any locally compact abelian group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and its double dual.

[[Canonical form|Canonical]] means that there is a naturally defined map &lt;math&gt;ev_G\colon G \to \widehat{\widehat{G}}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;; more importantly, the map should be [[functorial]] in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. The canonical isomorphism is defined on &lt;math&gt;x\in G&lt;/math&gt; as follows:

: &lt;math&gt; ev_G(x) = \{\chi \mapsto \chi(x) \} \ \text{ i.e. } \ ev_G(x)(\chi):=\chi(x) \in\mathbb{T}.&lt;/math&gt;

In other words, each group element &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is identified to the evaluation character on the dual. This is strongly analogous to the [[Dual space#Injection into the double-dual|canonical isomorphism]] between a [[finite-dimensional vector space]] and its [[double dual]], &lt;math&gt;V \cong V^{**}&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is a finite abelian group, then &lt;math&gt;G \cong \widehat{G}&lt;/math&gt; but this isomorphism is not canonical. Making this statement precise (in general) requires thinking about dualizing not only on groups, but also on maps  between the groups, in order to treat dualization as a [[functor]] and prove the identity functor and the dualization functor are not naturally equivalent. Also it should be noted that the duality theorem implies that for any group (not necessarily finite) the dualization functor is an exact functor.

===Haar measure===
{{main|Haar measure}}

One of the most remarkable facts about a locally compact group ''G'' is that it carries an essentially unique natural [[Measure (mathematics)|measure]], the [[Haar measure]], which allows one to consistently measure the "size" of sufficiently regular subsets  of ''G''.  "Sufficiently regular subset" here means a [[Borel set]]; that is, an element of the [[sigma-algebra|σ-algebra]] generated by the [[compact set]]s. More precisely,  a '''right Haar measure''' on a locally compact group ''G'' is a countably additive measure μ defined on the Borel sets of ''G'' which is ''right invariant'' in the sense that μ(''Ax'') = μ(''A'') for  ''x'' an element of ''G'' and ''A'' a Borel subset of ''G'' and  also satisfies some regularity conditions (spelled out in detail in the article on [[Haar measure]]). Except for positive scaling factors, a Haar measure on ''G'' is unique.

The Haar measure on ''G'' allows us to define the notion of [[integral]] for ([[complex number|complex]]-valued) Borel functions defined on the group.  In particular, one may consider various [[Lp space#Lp spaces|''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;'' spaces]] associated to the Haar measure μ. Specifically,

:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal L^p_\mu(G) = \left  \{f: G \to \Complex \ \Big| \ \int_G |f(x)|^p\ d \mu(x) &lt; \infty \right \}. &lt;/math&gt;

Note that, since any two Haar measures on ''G'' are equal up to a scaling factor, this ''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''-space is independent of the choice  of Haar measure and thus perhaps could be written as ''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;(G)''.  However, the ''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''-norm on this space depends on the choice of Haar measure, so if one wants to talk about isometries it is important to keep track of the Haar measure being used.

=== Fourier transform and Fourier inversion formula for ''L''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-functions ===

The dual group of a locally compact abelian group is used as the underlying space for an abstract version of the [[Fourier transform]].  If &lt;math&gt;f \in L^1(G)&lt;/math&gt;, then the Fourier transform  is the function &lt;math&gt;\widehat f&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\widehat{G}&lt;/math&gt; defined by

:&lt;math&gt; \widehat f(\chi) = \int_G f(x) \overline{\chi(x)}\ d\mu(x),&lt;/math&gt;

where the integral is relative to [[Haar measure]] &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.  This is also denoted &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{F}f)(\chi)&lt;/math&gt;. Note the Fourier transform depends on the choice of Haar measure. It is not too difficult to show that the Fourier transform of an &lt;math&gt;L^1&lt;/math&gt; function on &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is a bounded continuous function on &lt;math&gt;\widehat{G}&lt;/math&gt; which [[Riemann-Lebesgue lemma|vanishes at infinity]].

:'''Fourier Inversion Formula for &lt;math&gt;L^1&lt;/math&gt;-Functions.''' For each Haar measure &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; there is a unique Haar measure &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\widehat{G}&lt;/math&gt; such that whenever &lt;math&gt;f \in L^1(G)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\widehat f \in L^1(\widehat{G})&lt;/math&gt;, we have
::&lt;math&gt; f(x) = \int_{\widehat{G}} \widehat f(\chi)\chi(x)\ d\nu(\chi) \qquad \mu\text{-almost everywhere} &lt;/math&gt;
:If &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is continuous then this identity holds for all &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.

The ''inverse Fourier transform'' of an integrable function on &lt;math&gt;\widehat{G}&lt;/math&gt; is given by

:&lt;math&gt; \check{g} (x) = \int_{\widehat{G}} g(\chi) \chi(x)\ d\nu(\chi),&lt;/math&gt;

where the integral is relative to the Haar measure &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; on the dual group &lt;math&gt;\widehat{G}&lt;/math&gt;. The measure &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\widehat{G}&lt;/math&gt; that appears in the Fourier inversion formula is called the [[Pushforward measure|dual measure]] to &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; and may be denoted &lt;math&gt;\widehat{\mu}&lt;/math&gt;.

The various Fourier transforms can be classified in terms of their domain and transform domain (the group and dual group) as follows:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;"
! Transform !! Original domain !! Transform domain
|-
| style="text-align: center;"| Fourier transform || &lt;math&gt;\R&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\R&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| [[Fourier series]] || &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\Z&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| [[Discrete-time Fourier transform]] (DTFT) || &lt;math&gt;\Z&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| [[Discrete Fourier transform]] (DFT) || &lt;math&gt;\Z/(n)&lt;/math&gt;|| &lt;math&gt;\Z/(n)&lt;/math&gt;
|}

As an example, suppose &lt;math&gt;G=\R^n&lt;/math&gt;, so we can think about &lt;math&gt;\widehat{G}&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;\R^n&lt;/math&gt; by the pairing &lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{v}, \mathbf{w}) \mapsto e^{i \mathbf{v}\cdot \mathbf{w}}.&lt;/math&gt; If &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the Lebesgue measure on Euclidean space, we obtain the ordinary [[Fourier transform]] on &lt;math&gt;\R^n&lt;/math&gt; and the [[dual measure]] needed for the Fourier inversion formula is &lt;math&gt;\widehat{\mu} = (2\pi)^{-n}\mu&lt;/math&gt;. If we want to get a Fourier inversion formula with the same measure on both sides (that is, since we can think about &lt;math&gt;\R^n&lt;/math&gt; as its own dual space we can ask for &lt;math&gt;\widehat{\mu}&lt;/math&gt; to equal &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;) then we need to use

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 \mu &amp;= (2 \pi)^{-\frac{n}{2}} \times \text{Lebesgue measure} \\
\widehat{\mu} &amp;= (2 \pi)^{-\frac{n}{2}} \times \text{Lebesgue measure}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

However, if we change the way we identify &lt;math&gt;\R^n&lt;/math&gt; with its dual group, by using the pairing

:&lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{v}, \mathbf{w}) \mapsto e^{2\pi i \mathbf{v}\cdot \mathbf{w}},&lt;/math&gt;

then Lebesgue measure on &lt;math&gt;\R^n&lt;/math&gt; is equal to its own [[dual measure]].  This convention minimizes the number of factors of &lt;math&gt;2\pi&lt;/math&gt; that show up in various places when computing Fourier transforms or inverse Fourier transforms on Euclidean space. (In effect it limits the &lt;math&gt;2\pi&lt;/math&gt; only to the exponent rather than as some messy factor outside the integral sign.)  Note that the choice of how to identify &lt;math&gt;\R^n&lt;/math&gt; with its dual group affects the meaning of the term "self-dual function", which is a function on &lt;math&gt;\R^n&lt;/math&gt; equal to its own Fourier transform: using the classical pairing &lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{v}, \mathbf{w}) \mapsto e^{i\mathbf{v}\cdot \mathbf{w}}&lt;/math&gt; the function &lt;math&gt;e^{-\frac{1}{2} x^2}&lt;/math&gt; is self-dual, but using the (cleaner) pairing &lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{v}, \mathbf{w}) \mapsto e^{2\pi{i}{\mathbf v}\cdot {\mathbf w}}&lt;/math&gt; makes &lt;math&gt;e^{-\pi x^2}&lt;/math&gt; self-dual instead.

=== The group algebra ===
The space of integrable functions on  a locally compact abelian group ''G'' is an [[algebra]], where multiplication is convolution: the convolution of two integrable functions ''f'' and ''g'' is defined as

:&lt;math&gt; (f  *  g)(x) = \int_G f(x - y) g(y)\ d \mu(y).&lt;/math&gt;

:'''Theorem.''' The Banach space &lt;math&gt;L^1(G)&lt;/math&gt; is an associative and commutative algebra under convolution.

This algebra is referred to as the ''Group Algebra'' of ''G''. By the [[Fubini's theorem|Fubini–Tonelli theorem]], the convolution is submultiplicative with respect to the &lt;math&gt;L^1&lt;/math&gt; norm, making &lt;math&gt;L^1(G)&lt;/math&gt; a [[Banach algebra]]. The Banach algebra &lt;math&gt;L^1(G)&lt;/math&gt; has a multiplicative identity element if and only if ''G'' is a discrete group, namely the function that is 1 at the identity and zero elsewhere. In general, however, it has an [[approximate identity]] which is a net (or generalized sequence) &lt;math&gt;\{e_i\}_{i \in I}&lt;/math&gt; indexed on a directed set &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; f  *  e_i \to f. &lt;/math&gt;

The Fourier transform takes convolution to multiplication, i.e. it is a homomorphism of abelian Banach algebras &lt;math&gt;L^1(G) \to C_0(\widehat{G})&lt;/math&gt;  (of norm ≤ 1):

:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{F}( f  *  g)(\chi) = \mathcal{F}(f)(\chi) \cdot \mathcal{F}(g)(\chi).&lt;/math&gt;

In particular, to every group character on ''G'' corresponds a unique ''multiplicative linear functional'' on the group algebra defined by

:&lt;math&gt; f \mapsto \widehat{f}(\chi).&lt;/math&gt;

It is an important property of the group algebra that these exhaust the set of non-trivial (that is, not identically zero) multiplicative linear functionals on the group algebra; see section 34 of {{harv|Loomis|1953}}. This means the Fourier transform is a special case of the [[Gelfand transform]].

=== Plancherel and &lt;math&gt;L^2&lt;/math&gt; Fourier inversion theorems ===
As we have stated, the dual group of a locally compact abelian group is a locally compact abelian group in its own right and thus has a Haar measure, or more precisely a whole family of scale-related Haar measures.

:'''Theorem.''' Choose a Haar measure &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; be the dual measure on &lt;math&gt;\widehat{G}&lt;/math&gt; as defined above. If &lt;math&gt;f :  G \to \Complex&lt;/math&gt; is continuous with compact support then &lt;math&gt;\widehat{f} \in L^2(\widehat{G})&lt;/math&gt; and
:: &lt;math&gt; \int_G |f(x)|^2 \ d \mu(x) = \int_{\widehat{G}} \left |\widehat{f}(\chi) \right |^2 \ d \nu(\chi).&lt;/math&gt;
:In particular, the Fourier transform is an &lt;math&gt;L^2&lt;/math&gt; isometry from the complex-valued continuous functions of compact support on ''G'' to the &lt;math&gt;L^2&lt;/math&gt;-functions on &lt;math&gt;\widehat{G}&lt;/math&gt; (using the &lt;math&gt;L^2&lt;/math&gt;-norm with respect to μ for functions on ''G'' and the &lt;math&gt;L^2&lt;/math&gt;-norm with respect to ν for functions on &lt;math&gt;\widehat{G}&lt;/math&gt;).

Since the complex-valued continuous functions of compact support on ''G'' are &lt;math&gt;L^2&lt;/math&gt;-dense, there is a unique extension of the Fourier transform from that space to a [[unitary operator]]

: &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{F}: L^2_\mu(G) \to L^2_\nu(\widehat{G}).&lt;/math&gt;

and we have the formula

: &lt;math&gt; \forall f \in L^2(G): \qquad \int_G |f(x)|^2 \ d \mu(x) = \int_{\widehat{G}} \left  |\widehat{f}(\chi) \right |^2 \ d \nu(\chi).&lt;/math&gt;

Note that for non-compact locally compact groups ''G'' the space &lt;math&gt;L^1(G)&lt;/math&gt; does not contain &lt;math&gt;L^2(G)&lt;/math&gt;, so the Fourier transform of general &lt;math&gt;L^2&lt;/math&gt;-functions on ''G'' is "not" given by any kind of integration formula (or really any explicit formula). To define the &lt;math&gt;L^2&lt;/math&gt; Fourier transform one has to resort to some technical trick such as starting on a dense subspace like the continuous functions with compact support and then extending the isometry by continuity to the whole space. This unitary extension of the Fourier transform is what we mean by the Fourier transform on the space of square integrable functions.

The dual group also has an inverse Fourier transform in its own right; it can be characterized as the inverse (or adjoint, since it is unitary) of the &lt;math&gt;L^2&lt;/math&gt; Fourier transform. This is the content of the &lt;math&gt;L^2&lt;/math&gt; Fourier inversion formula which follows.

:'''Theorem.'''  The adjoint of the Fourier transform restricted to continuous functions of compact support is the inverse Fourier transform
::&lt;math&gt;  L^2_\nu(\widehat{G}) \to L^2_\mu(G) &lt;/math&gt;
:where &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; is the dual measure to &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;.

In the case &lt;math&gt;G = \mathbb{T}&lt;/math&gt; the dual group &lt;math&gt;\widehat{G}&lt;/math&gt; is naturally isomorphic to the group of integers &lt;math&gt;\Z&lt;/math&gt; and the Fourier transform specializes to the computation of coefficients of [[Fourier series]] of periodic functions.

If ''G'' is a finite group, we recover the [[discrete Fourier transform]].  Note that this case is very easy to prove directly.

==Bohr compactification and almost-periodicity==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Discrete space]] --&gt;

One important application of Pontryagin duality is the following characterization of compact abelian topological groups:

:'''Theorem'''. A locally compact ''abelian'' group ''G'' is compact [[if and only if]] the dual group &lt;math&gt;\widehat{G}&lt;/math&gt; is discrete. Conversely, ''G'' is  discrete if and only if &lt;math&gt;\widehat{G}&lt;/math&gt; is compact.

That ''G'' being compact implies &lt;math&gt;\widehat{G}&lt;/math&gt; is discrete or that ''G'' being discrete implies that &lt;math&gt;\widehat{G}&lt;/math&gt; is compact is an elementary consequence of the definition of the compact-open topology on &lt;math&gt;\widehat{G}&lt;/math&gt; and does not need Pontryagin duality. One uses Pontryagin duality to prove the converses.

The [[Bohr compactification]] is defined for any topological group ''G'', regardless of whether ''G'' is locally compact or abelian. One use made of Pontryagin duality between compact abelian groups and discrete abelian groups is to characterize the  Bohr compactification of an arbitrary abelian ''locally compact'' topological group. The ''Bohr compactification'' ''B(G)'' of ''G'' is &lt;math&gt;\widehat{H}&lt;/math&gt;, where ''H'' has the group structure &lt;math&gt;\widehat{G}&lt;/math&gt;, but given the [[discrete topology]]. Since the [[inclusion map]]

: &lt;math&gt; \iota: H \to \widehat{G} &lt;/math&gt;	

is continuous and a homomorphism, the dual morphism

: &lt;math&gt; G \sim \widehat{\widehat{G}} \to \widehat{H} &lt;/math&gt;
			
is a morphism into a compact group which is easily shown to satisfy the requisite [[universal property]].

See also [[almost periodic function]].

==Categorical considerations ==

It is useful to regard the dual group [[functor]]ially.  In what follows, '''LCA''' is the category of locally compact abelian groups and continuous group homomorphisms. The dual group construction of &lt;math&gt;\widehat{G}&lt;/math&gt; is a contravariant functor '''LCA''' → '''LCA''', represented (in the sense of [[representable functor]]s) by the circle group &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;\widehat{G}= \text{Hom}(G, \mathbb{T}).&lt;/math&gt;  In particular, the double dual functor &lt;math&gt;G \to \widehat{\widehat{G}}&lt;/math&gt; is ''covariant''.

:'''Theorem'''. The dual group functor is an [[equivalence of categories]] from '''LCA''' to '''LCA'''&lt;sup&gt;op&lt;/sup&gt;.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

:'''Theorem'''.  The double dual functor is [[natural transformation|naturally isomorphic]] to the identity functor on '''LCA'''.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

This isomorphism is analogous to the [[double dual]] of [[finite-dimensional vector space]]s (a special case, for real and complex vector spaces).

The duality interchanges the subcategories of discrete groups and [[compact group]]s. If ''R'' is a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] and ''G'' is a left ''R''-[[module (mathematics)|module]], the dual group &lt;math&gt;\widehat{G}&lt;/math&gt; will become a right ''R''-module; in this way we can also see that discrete left ''R''-modules will be Pontryagin dual to compact right ''R''-modules. The ring End(''G'') of [[endomorphism]]s in '''LCA''' is changed by duality into its [[opposite ring#Constructing new rings from given ones|opposite ring]] (change the multiplication to the other order). For example, if ''G'' is an infinite cyclic discrete group, &lt;math&gt;\widehat{G}&lt;/math&gt; is a circle group: the former has &lt;math&gt;\text{End}(G) = \Z&lt;/math&gt; so this is true also of the latter.

==Generalizations==

===Non-commutative theory===
Such a theory cannot exist in the same form for non-commutative groups ''G'', since in that case the appropriate dual object &lt;math&gt;\widehat{G}&lt;/math&gt; of isomorphism classes of representations cannot only contain one-dimensional representations, and will fail to be a group. The generalisation that has been found useful in [[category theory]] is called [[Tannaka–Krein duality]]{{Citation needed|reason=unveriviable and unsufficient citation about the source|date=May 2017}}; but this diverges from the connection with [[harmonic analysis]], which needs to tackle the question of the Plancherel measure on &lt;math&gt;\widehat{G}&lt;/math&gt;.

There are analogues of duality theory for noncommutative groups, some of which are formulated in the language of [[C-star algebra|C*-algebras]].{{Citation needed|reason=unveriviable and unsufficient citation about the source|date=May 2017}}

=== Others ===

When ''G'' is a Hausdorff abelian topological group, the group &lt;math&gt;\widehat{G}&lt;/math&gt; with the compact-open topology is a Hausdorff abelian topological group and the natural mapping from ''G'' to its double-dual ''G^^'' makes sense.  If this mapping is an isomorphism, we say that ''G'' satisfies Pontryagin duality. This has been extended in a number directions beyond the case that ''G'' is locally compact.

* S.Kaplan, in "Extensions of the Pontryagin duality" ("part I: infinite products", Duke Math. J. 15 (1948) 649–658, and "part II: direct and inverse limits", same journal, 17 (1950), 419–435) showed that arbitrary products and countable inverse limits of locally compact (Hausdorff) abelian groups satisfy Pontryagin duality. Note that an infinite product of locally compact non-compact spaces is not locally compact.
* Later, in 1975, R.Venkataraman ("Extensions of Pontryagin Duality", Math. Z. 143, 105-112) showed, among other facts, that every open subgroup of an abelian topological group which satisfies Pontryagin duality itself satisfies Pontryagin duality.
* More recently, S. Ardanza-Trevijano and M.J. Chasco have extended the results of Kaplan mentioned above. They showed, in "The Pontryagin duality of sequential limits of topological Abelian groups", Journal of Pure and Applied Algebra 202 (2005), 11–21, that direct and inverse limits of sequences of abelian groups satisfying Pontryagin duality also satisfy Pontryagin duality if the groups are metrizable or ''k''&lt;sub&gt;''ω''&lt;/sub&gt;-spaces but not necessarily locally compact, provided some extra conditions are satisfied by the sequences.

However, there is a fundamental aspect that changes if we want to consider Pontryagin duality beyond the locally compact case. In E. Martin-Peinador, ''A reflexible admissible topological group must be locally compact'', Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 123 (1995), 3563–3566, it is proved that if ''G'' is a Hausdorff abelian topological group that satisfies Pontryagin duality and the natural evaluation pairing:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases} G \times \widehat{G} \to \mathbb{T} \\ (x, \chi) \mapsto \chi(x) \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

is continuous, then ''G'' is locally compact. Thus any non-locally compact example of Pontryagin duality is a group where the natural evaluation pairing of ''G'' and &lt;math&gt;\widehat{G}&lt;/math&gt; is not continuous.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17321">In [[recursion theory|computability theory]] '''Post's theorem''', named after [[Emil Post]], describes the connection between the [[arithmetical hierarchy]] and the [[Turing degree]]s. 

== Background ==
{{See also|Arithmetical_hierarchy#Relation_to_Turing_machines}}
The statement of Post's theorem uses several concepts relating to [[Structure (mathematical logic)#Definable_relations|definability]] and [[recursion theory]].  This section gives a brief overview of these concepts, which are covered in depth in their respective articles. 

The [[arithmetical hierarchy]] classifies certain sets of natural numbers that are definable in the language of Peano arithmetic.   A [[formula (mathematical logic)|formula]]  is said to be &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^{0}_m&lt;/math&gt; if it is an existential statement in [[prenex normal form]] (all quantifiers at the front) with &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; alternations between existential and universal quantifiers applied to a formula with [[bounded quantifier]]s only.  Formally a formula &lt;math&gt;\phi(s)&lt;/math&gt; in the language of Peano arithmetic is a &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^{0}_m&lt;/math&gt; formula if it is of the form
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\exists n^1_1\exists n^1_2\cdots\exists n^1_{j_1}\right)\left(\forall n^2_1 \cdots \forall n^2_{j_2}\right)\left(\exists n^3_1\cdots\right)\cdots\left(Q_1 n^m_1 \cdots \right)\rho(n^1_1,\ldots n^m_{j_m},x_1,\ldots,x_k)&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; contains only [[bounded quantifier]]s and ''Q'' is &lt;math&gt;\forall&lt;/math&gt; if ''m'' is even and &lt;math&gt;\exists&lt;/math&gt; if ''m'' is odd.

A set of natural numbers ''A'' is said to be &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_m&lt;/math&gt; if it is definable by a &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_m&lt;/math&gt; formula, that is, if there is a &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_m&lt;/math&gt; formula &lt;math&gt;\phi(s)&lt;/math&gt; such that each number ''n'' is in ''A'' if and only if &lt;math&gt;\phi(n)&lt;/math&gt; holds.   It is known that if a set is &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_m&lt;/math&gt; then it is &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_n&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;n &gt; m&lt;/math&gt;, but for each ''m'' there is a &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_{m+1}&lt;/math&gt; set that is not &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_m&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus the number of quantifier alternations required to define a set gives a measure of the complexity of the set.

Post's theorem uses the relativized arithmetical hierarchy as well as the unrelativized hierarchy just defined.   A set ''A'' of natural numbers is said to be &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_m&lt;/math&gt; relative to a set ''B'', written &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^{0,B}_m&lt;/math&gt;, if
''A'' is definable by a &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_m&lt;/math&gt; formula in an extended language that includes a predicate for membership in ''B''.

While the arithmetical hierarchy measures definability of sets of natural numbers, [[Turing degrees]] measure the level of uncomputability of sets of natural numbers.    A set ''A'' is said to be [[Turing reduction|Turing reducible]] to a set ''B'', written &lt;math&gt;A \leq_T B&lt;/math&gt;, if there is an [[oracle Turing machine]] that, given an oracle for ''B'', computes the [[Indicator function|characteristic function]] of ''A''.
The [[Turing jump]] of a set ''A'' is a form of the [[Halting problem]] relative to ''A''.  Given a set ''A'',
the Turing jump &lt;math&gt;A'&lt;/math&gt; is the set of indices  of oracle Turing machines that halt on input ''0'' when run with oracle ''A''.   It is known that every set ''A'' is Turing reducible to its Turing jump, but the Turing jump of a set is never Turing reducible to the original set.  

Post's theorem uses finitely iterated Turing jumps.  For any set ''A'' of natural numbers, the notation
&lt;math&gt;A^{(n)}&lt;/math&gt; indicates the ''n''-fold iterated Turing jump of ''A''.  Thus &lt;math&gt;A^{(0)}&lt;/math&gt; is just ''A'', and &lt;math&gt;A^{(n+1)}&lt;/math&gt; is the Turing jump of &lt;math&gt;A^{(n)}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Post's theorem and corollaries ==

Post's theorem establishes a close connection between the arithmetical hierarchy and the Turing degrees of the form &lt;math&gt;\emptyset^{(n)}&lt;/math&gt;, that is, finitely iterated Turing jumps of the empty set.  (The empty set could be replaced with any other computable set without changing the truth of the theorem.)

Post's theorem states:
#A set ''B'' is &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is [[recursively enumerable]] by an oracle Turing machine with an oracle for &lt;math&gt;\emptyset^{(n)}&lt;/math&gt;, that is, if and only if ''B'' is &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^{0,\emptyset^{(n)}}_1&lt;/math&gt;.
#The set &lt;math&gt;\emptyset^{(n)}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_n&lt;/math&gt;-complete for every &lt;math&gt;n &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;.  This means that every &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_n&lt;/math&gt; set is [[many-one reduction|many-one reducible]] to &lt;math&gt;\emptyset^{(n)}&lt;/math&gt;. 

Post's theorem has many corollaries that expose additional relationships between the arithmetical
hierarchy and the Turing degrees.  These include:
#Fix a set ''C''. A set ''B'' is &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^{0,C}_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt; if and only if ''B'' is &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^{0,C^{(n)}}_1&lt;/math&gt;.  This is the relativization of the first part of Post's theorem to the oracle ''C''.
#A set ''B'' is &lt;math&gt;\Delta_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;B \leq_T \emptyset^{(n)}&lt;/math&gt;. More generally, ''B'' is &lt;math&gt;\Delta^C_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;B \leq_T C^{(n)}&lt;/math&gt;.
#A set is defined to be arithmetical if it is &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_n&lt;/math&gt; for some ''n''.  Post's theorem shows that, equivalently, a set is arithmetical if and only if it is Turing reducible to &lt;math&gt;\emptyset^{(m)}&lt;/math&gt; for some ''m''.

== Proof of Post's theorem ==
===Formalization of Turing machines in first-order arithmetic===
The operation of a [[Turing machine]] T on input n can be formalized logically in [[first-order arithmetic]]. For example, we may use [[First-order_logic#Non-logical_symbols|symbol]]s A&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;, B&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; for the tape configuration, machine state and location along the tape after k steps, respectively. T's [[transition system]] determines the relation between (A&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;,B&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;,C&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;) and (A&lt;sub&gt;k+1&lt;/sub&gt;,B&lt;sub&gt;k+1&lt;/sub&gt;,C&lt;sub&gt;k+1&lt;/sub&gt;); their initial values (for k=0) are the input, the initial state and zero, respectively. The machine halts if and only if there is a number k such that B&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; is the halting state.

The exact relation depends on the specific implementation of the notion of Turing machine (e.g. their alphabet, allowed mode of motion along the tape, etc.)

In case T halts at time n&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, the relation between  (A&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;,B&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;,C&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;) and (A&lt;sub&gt;k+1&lt;/sub&gt;,B&lt;sub&gt;k+1&lt;/sub&gt;,C&lt;sub&gt;k+1&lt;/sub&gt;) must be satisfied only for k bounded from above by n&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.

Thus there is a formula &lt;math&gt;\varphi(n,n_1)&lt;/math&gt; in [[first-order arithmetic]] with no un[[bounded quantifier]]s, such that T halts on input n at time n&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; at most if and only if &lt;math&gt;\varphi(n,n_1)&lt;/math&gt; is satisfied.

===Implementation example===
For example, for a [[prefix code|prefix-free]] Turing machine with binary alphabet and no blank symbol, we may use the following notations:
*A&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; is the 1-[[Arity|ary]] [[First-order_logic#Non-logical_symbols|symbol]] for the configuration of the whole tape after k steps (which we may write as a number with [[least significant bit|LSB]] first, the value of the m-th location on the tape being its m-th LSB bit). In particular A&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the initial configuration of the tape, which corresponds the input to the machine.
*B&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; is the 1-[[Arity|ary]] symbol for the Turing machine state after k steps. In particular B&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = q&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt;, the initial state of the Turing machine.
*C&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; is the 1-[[Arity|ary]] symbol for the Turing machine location on the tape after k steps. In particular C&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.
*M(q,b) is the transition function of the Turing machine, written as a function from a doublet (machine state, bit read by the machine) to a triplet (new machine state, bit written by the machine, +1 or -1 machine movement along the tape).
*bit(j ,m) is the j-th bit of a number m. This can be written as a first-order arithmetic formula with no unbounded quantifiers.

For a [[prefix code|prefix-free]] Turing machine we may use, for input n, the initial tape configuration &lt;math&gt;t(n)= cat(2^{ceil(log_2 n)}-1,0,n)&lt;/math&gt; where cat stands for concatenation; thus t(n) is a log(n)-length string of 1-s followed by 0 and then by n. 

The operation of the Turing machine at the first n&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; steps can thus be written as the conjunction of the initial conditions and the following formulas, quantified over k for all k&lt;n&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;:
*&lt;math&gt;(B_{k+1}, bit(C_k ,A_{k+1}), D) = M(B_k, bit(C_k ,A_k))&lt;/math&gt;. Since M has a finite domain, this can be replaced by a first-order [[Quantifier-free formula|quantifier-free]] arithmetic formula. The exact formula obviously depends on M.
*&lt;math&gt;C_{k+1} = C_k+D&lt;/math&gt; 
*&lt;math&gt;\forall j: j\ne C_k \rightarrow bit(j ,A_{k+1}) = bit(j ,A_k)&lt;/math&gt;. Note that at the first n&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; steps, T never arrives at a location along the tape greater than n&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. Thus the [[universal quantifier]] over j can be [[bounded quantifier|bounded]] by n&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;+1, as bits beyond this location have no relevance for the machine's operation.

T halts on input n at time n&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; at most if and only if &lt;math&gt;\varphi(n,n_1)&lt;/math&gt; is satisfied, where:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}\varphi(n,n_1) =&amp; (A_0=t(n)) \land (B_0=q_I) \land (C_0=0) \land (B_{n_1}=q_H)\\ &amp;\land \forall k&lt;n_1: ((B_{k+1},bit(C_k,A_{k+1}),1) = M(B_k,bit(C_k,A_k)) \land C_{k+1}=C_k+1)&amp;\\ &amp;\lor ((B_{k+1},bit(C_k ,A_{k+1}),-1) = M(B_k,bit(C_k,A_k)) \land C_{k+1}=C_k-1))&amp; \\&amp;\land \forall j&lt;n_1+1: j\ne C_k \rightarrow (bit(j,A_{k+1})=bit(j,A_k)) &amp; \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

This is a first-order arithmetic formula with no unbounded quantifiers, i.e. it is in &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_0&lt;/math&gt;.

===Recursively enumerable sets===
Let S be a set that can be recursively enumerated by a [[Turing machine]]. Then there is a Turing machine T that for every n in S, T halts when given n as an input.

This can be formalized by the first-order arithmetical formula presented above. The members of S are the numbers n satisfying the following formula:

&lt;math&gt;\exists n_1:\varphi(n,n_1)&lt;/math&gt;

This formula is in &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_1&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, S is in &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_1&lt;/math&gt;.
Thus every recursively enumerable set is in &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_1&lt;/math&gt;. 

The converse is true as well: for every formula &lt;math&gt;\varphi(n)&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_1&lt;/math&gt; with k existential quantifiers, we may enumerate the k-tuples of natural numbers and run a Turing machine that goes through all of them until it finds the formula is satisfied. This Turing machine halts on precisely the set of natural numbers satisfying &lt;math&gt;\varphi(n)&lt;/math&gt;, and thus enumerates its corresponding set.

===Oracle machines===

Similarly, the operation of an [[oracle machine]] T with an oracle O that halts after at most n&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; steps on input n can be described by a first-order formula &lt;math&gt;\varphi_O(n,n_1)&lt;/math&gt;, except that the formula &lt;math&gt;\varphi_1(n,n_1)&lt;/math&gt; now includes:
* A new predicate, O&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;, giving the oracle answer. This predicate must satisfy some formula to be discussed below.
* An additional tape - the oracle tape - on which T has to write the number m for every call O(m) to the oracle; writing on this tape can be logically formalized in a similar manner to writing on the machine's tape. Note that an oracle machine that halts after at most n&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; steps has time to write at most n&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; digits on the oracle tape. So the oracle can only be called with numbers m satisfying &lt;math&gt;m&lt;2^{n_1}&lt;/math&gt;.

If the oracle is for a decision problem, O&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; is always "Yes" or "No", which we may formalize as 0 or 1. Suppose the decision problem itself can be formalized by a first-order arithmetic formula &lt;math&gt;\psi^O(m)&lt;/math&gt;.
Then T halts on n after at most n&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; steps if and only if the following formula is satisfied:
&lt;math&gt;\varphi_O(n,n_1) =\forall m&lt;2^{n_1}:((\psi^O(m)\rightarrow (O_m=1)) \land(\lnot\psi^O(m)\rightarrow (O_m=0))) \land {\varphi_O}_1(n,n_1)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;{\varphi_O}_1(n,n_1)&lt;/math&gt; is a first-order formula with no unbounded quantifiers.

===Turing jump===

If O is an oracle to the halting problem of a machine T', then &lt;math&gt;\psi^O(m)&lt;/math&gt; is the same as "there exists m&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; such that T' starting with input m is at the halting state after m&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; steps". 
Thus:
&lt;math&gt;\psi^O(m) = \exists m_1: \psi_H(m,m_1)&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\psi_H(m,m_1)&lt;/math&gt; is a first-order formula that formalizes T'. If T' is a Turing machine (with no oracle), &lt;math&gt;\psi_H(m,m_1)&lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_0 = \Pi^0_0&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. it has no unbounded quantifiers).

Since there is a finite number of numbers m satisfying &lt;math&gt;m&lt;2^{n_1}&lt;/math&gt;, we may choose the same number of steps for all of them: there is a number m&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, such that T' halts after m&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; steps precisely on those inputs &lt;math&gt;m&lt;2^{n_1}&lt;/math&gt; for which it halts at all.

Moving to [[prenex normal form]], we get that the oracle machine halts on input n if and only if the following formula is satisfied:
&lt;math&gt;\varphi(n) =\exists n_1\exists m_1 \forall m_2 :(\psi_H(m,m_2)\rightarrow (O_m=1)) \land(\lnot\psi_H(m,m_1)\rightarrow (O_m=0))) \land {\varphi_O}_1(n,n_1)&lt;/math&gt;

(informally, there is a "maximal number of steps" m&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; such every oracle that does not halt within the first m&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; steps does not stop at all; however, for every m&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, each oracle that halts after m&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; steps does halt).

Note that we may replace both n&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and m&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; by a single number - their maximum - without changing the truth value of &lt;math&gt;\varphi(n)&lt;/math&gt;. Thus we may write:
&lt;math&gt;\varphi(n) =\exists n_1 \forall m_2 :(\psi_H(m,m_2)\rightarrow (O_m=1)) \land(\lnot\psi_H(m,n_1)\rightarrow (O_m=0))) \land {\varphi_O}_1(n,n_1)&lt;/math&gt;

For the oracle to the halting problem over Turing machines, &lt;math&gt;\psi_H(m,m_1)&lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt;\Pi^0_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\varphi(n)&lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_2&lt;/math&gt;. Thus every set that is recursively enumerable by an oracle machine with an oracle for &lt;math&gt;\emptyset ^{(1)}&lt;/math&gt;, is in &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_2&lt;/math&gt;.

The converse is true as well: Suppose &lt;math&gt;\varphi(n)&lt;/math&gt; is a formula in &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_2&lt;/math&gt; with k&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; existential quantifiers followed by k&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; universal quantifiers. Equivalently, &lt;math&gt;\varphi(n)&lt;/math&gt; has k&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; existential quantifiers followed by a negation of a formula in &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_1&lt;/math&gt;; the latter formula can be enumerated by a Turing machine and can thus be checked immediately by an oracle for &lt;math&gt;\emptyset ^{(1)}&lt;/math&gt;.

We may thus enumerate the k&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-tuples of natural numbers and run an oracle machine with an oracle for &lt;math&gt;\emptyset ^{(1)}&lt;/math&gt; that goes through all of them until it finds a satisfaction for the formula. This oracle machine halts on precisely the set of natural numbers satisfying &lt;math&gt;\varphi(n)&lt;/math&gt;, and thus enumerates its corresponding set.

===Higher Turing jumps===

More generally, suppose every set that is recursively enumerable by an oracle machine with an oracle for &lt;math&gt;\emptyset ^{(p)}&lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_{p+1}&lt;/math&gt;. Then for an oracle machine with an oracle for &lt;math&gt;\emptyset ^{(p+1)}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\psi^O(m) = \exists m_1: \psi_H(m,m_1)&lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_{p+1}&lt;/math&gt;.

Since &lt;math&gt;\psi^O(m)&lt;/math&gt; is the same as &lt;math&gt;\varphi(n)&lt;/math&gt; for the previous Turing jump, it can be constructed (as we have just done with &lt;math&gt;\varphi(n)&lt;/math&gt; above) so that &lt;math&gt;\psi_H(m,m_1)&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\Pi^0_p&lt;/math&gt;. After moving to prenex formal form the new &lt;math&gt;\varphi(n)&lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_{p+2}&lt;/math&gt;.

By induction, every set that is recursively enumerable by an oracle machine with an oracle for &lt;math&gt;\emptyset ^{(p)}&lt;/math&gt;, is in &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_{p+1}&lt;/math&gt;.

'''The other direction''' can be proven by induction as well: Suppose every formula in &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_{p+1}&lt;/math&gt; can be enumerated by an oracle machine with an oracle for &lt;math&gt;\emptyset ^{(p)}&lt;/math&gt;.

Now Suppose &lt;math&gt;\varphi(n)&lt;/math&gt; is a formula in &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_{p+2}&lt;/math&gt; with k&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; existential quantifiers followed by k&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; universal quantifiers etc. Equivalently, &lt;math&gt;\varphi(n)&lt;/math&gt; has k&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; existential quantifiers followed by a negation of a formula in &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_{p+1}&lt;/math&gt;; the latter formula can be enumerated by an oracle machine with an oracle for &lt;math&gt;\emptyset ^{(p)}&lt;/math&gt; and can thus be checked immediately by an oracle for &lt;math&gt;\emptyset ^{(p+1)}&lt;/math&gt;.

We may thus enumerate the k&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-tuples of natural numbers and run an oracle machine with an oracle for &lt;math&gt;\emptyset ^{(p+1)}&lt;/math&gt; that goes through all of them until it finds a satisfaction for the formula. This oracle machine halts on precisely the set of natural numbers satisfying &lt;math&gt;\varphi(n)&lt;/math&gt;, and thus enumerates its corresponding set.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17812">'''Presburger arithmetic''' is the [[first-order predicate calculus|first-order theory]] of the [[natural number]]s with [[addition]], named in honor of [[Mojżesz Presburger]], who introduced it in 1929. The [[signature (mathematical logic)|signature]] of Presburger arithmetic contains only the addition operation and equality, omitting the multiplication operation entirely. The axioms include a schema of [[mathematical induction|induction]].

Presburger arithmetic is much weaker than [[Peano arithmetic]], which includes both addition and multiplication operations. Unlike Peano arithmetic, Presburger arithmetic is a [[Decidability (logic)|decidable theory]]. This means it is possible to algorithmically determine, for any sentence in the language of Presburger arithmetic, whether that sentence is provable from the axioms of Presburger arithmetic. The asymptotic running-time [[Analysis of algorithms|computational complexity]] of this [[decision problem]] is at least [[Double exponential function|doubly exponential]], however, as shown by {{harvtxt|Fischer|Rabin|1974}}.

==Overview==
The language of Presburger arithmetic contains constants 0 and 1 and a binary function +, interpreted as addition. In this language, the axioms of Presburger arithmetic are the [[universal closure]]s of the following:
# ¬(0 = ''x'' + 1)
# ''x'' + 1 = ''y'' + 1 → ''x'' = ''y''
# ''x'' + 0 = ''x''
# ''x'' + (''y'' + 1) = (''x'' + ''y'') + 1
# Let ''P''(''x'') be a [[first-order logic|first-order formula]] in the language of Presburger arithmetic with a  free variable ''x'' (and possibly other free variables). Then the following formula is an axiom:
::(''P''(0) &amp;and; &amp;forall;''x''(''P''(''x'') &amp;rarr; ''P''(''x'' + 1))) &amp;rarr; &amp;forall;''y'' ''P''(''y'').

(5) is an [[axiom schema]] of [[Mathematical Induction|induction]], representing infinitely many axioms. Since the axioms in the schema in (5) cannot be replaced by any finite number of axioms, Presburger arithmetic is not finitely axiomatizable in first-order logic.

Presburger arithmetic cannot formalize concepts such as [[divisibility]] or [[prime number]]. Generally, any number concept leading to multiplication cannot be defined in Presburger arithmetic, since that leads to incompleteness and undecidability. However, it can formulate individual instances of divisibility; for example, it proves "for all ''x'', there exists ''y'' : (''y'' + ''y'' = ''x'') ∨ (''y'' + ''y'' + 1 = ''x'')". This states that every number is either even or odd.

==Properties==

[[Mojżesz Presburger]] proved Presburger arithmetic to be:
* [[Consistency proof|consistent]]: There is no statement in Presburger arithmetic which can be deduced from the axioms such that its negation can also be deduced.
* [[Completeness (logic)|complete]]: For each statement in the language of Presburger arithmetic, either it is possible to deduce it from the axioms or it is possible to deduce its negation. 
* [[Decidability (logic)|decidable]]: There exists an [[algorithm]] which decides whether any given statement in Presburger arithmetic is a theorem or a nontheorem.

The decidability of Presburger arithmetic can be shown using [[quantifier elimination]], supplemented by reasoning about arithmetical congruence (Enderton 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;188).

[[Peano arithmetic]], which is Presburger arithmetic augmented with multiplication, is not decidable, as a consequence of the negative answer to the [[Entscheidungsproblem]]. By [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]], Peano arithmetic is incomplete and its consistency is not internally provable (but see [[Gentzen's consistency proof]]).

The decision problem for Presburger arithmetic is an interesting example in [[computational complexity theory]] and [[computation]]. Let ''n'' be the length of a statement in Presburger arithmetic. Then [[Michael J. Fischer|Fischer]] and [[Michael O. Rabin|Rabin]] (1974) proved that any decision algorithm for Presburger arithmetic has a worst-case runtime of at least &lt;math&gt;2^{2^{cn}}&lt;/math&gt;, for some constant ''c''&gt;0.  Hence, the decision problem for Presburger arithmetic is an example of a decision problem that has been proved to require more than exponential run time. Fischer and Rabin also proved that for any reasonable axiomatization (defined precisely in their paper), there exist theorems of length ''n'' which have [[double exponential function|doubly exponential]] length proofs. Intuitively, this means there are computational limits on what can be proven by computer programs. Fischer and Rabin's work also implies that Presburger arithmetic can be used to define formulas which correctly calculate any algorithm as long as the inputs are less than relatively large bounds. The bounds can be increased, but only by using new formulas. On the other hand, a triply exponential upper bound on a decision procedure for Presburger Arithmetic was proved by Oppen (1978). A more tight complexity bound was shown using alternating complexity classes by {{harvtxt|Berman|1980}}.

The set of true statements in Presburger arithmetic (PA) is complete for TimeAlternations(2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;sup&gt;O(1)&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, n).  Thus, its complexity is between double exponential nondeterministic time (2-NEXP) and double exponential space (2-EXPSPACE). Completeness is under polynomial time many-to-one reductions.  (Also, note that while Presburger arithmetic is commonly abbreviated PA, in mathematics in general PA usually means Peano arithmetic.)

For a more fine-grained result, let PA(i) be the set of true Σ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; PA statements, and PA(i, j) the set of true Σ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; PA statements with each quantifier block limited to j variables.  '&lt;' is considered to be quantifier-free; here, bounded quantifiers are counted as quantifiers.&lt;br/&gt;
PA(1, j) is in P, while PA(1) is NP-complete.&lt;br/&gt;
For i &gt; 0 and j &gt; 2, PA(i + 1, j) is [[Polynomial_hierarchy|Σ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;P&lt;/sup&gt;-complete]]. The hardness result only needs j&gt;2 (as opposed to j=1) in the last quantifier block.&lt;br/&gt;
For i&gt;0, PA(i+1) is [[Exponential_hierarchy|Σ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;EXP&lt;/sup&gt;-complete]] (and is TimeAlternations(2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;sup&gt;O(i)&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, i)-complete). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | last1 = Haase | first1 = Christoph | title = Subclasses of Presburger Arithmetic and the Weak EXP Hierarchy | book-title = Proceedings CSL-LICS | publisher = ACM | date = 2014 | pages = 47:1&amp;ndash;47:10 | doi = 10.1145/2603088.2603092 | arxiv = 1401.5266 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
Because Presburger arithmetic is decidable,  [[automatic theorem prover]]s for Presburger arithmetic exist. For example, the [[Coq]] proof assistant system features the tactic omega for Presburger arithmetic and the [[Isabelle (proof assistant)|Isabelle proof assistant]] contains a verified quantifier elimination procedure by Nipkow (2010). The double exponential complexity of the theory makes it infeasible to use the theorem provers on complicated formulas, but this behavior occurs only in the presence of nested quantifiers: Oppen and Nelson (1980) describe an automatic theorem prover which uses the [[simplex algorithm]] on an extended Presburger arithmetic without nested quantifiers to prove some of the instances of quantifier-free Presburger arithmetic formulas. More recent [[satisfiability modulo theories]] solvers use complete [[integer programming]] techniques to handle quantifier-free fragment of Presburger arithmetic theory (King, Barrett, Tinelli 2014).

Presburger arithmetic can be extended to include multiplication by constants, since multiplication is repeated addition. Most array subscript calculations then fall within the region of decidable problems.  This approach is the basis of at least five proof-of-[[Correctness (computer science)|correctness]] systems for [[computer programs]], beginning with the [[Stanford Pascal Verifier]] in the late 1970s and continuing through to Microsoft's [[Spec sharp|Spec#]] system of 2005.

==Presburger-definable integer relation==

Some properties are now given about integer [[Finitary relation|relations]] definable in Presburger Arithmetic. For the sake of simplicity, all relations considered in this sections are over natural integers.

A relation is  Presburger-definable if and only if it is a [[semilinear set]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ginsburg|first1=Seymour|last2=Spanier|first2=Edwin Henry|title=Semigroups, Presburger Formulas, and Languages|journal=Pacific Journal of Mathematics|date=1966|volume=16|pages=285–296}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A unary integer relation &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, that is, a set of natural integers, is Presburger-definable if and only if it is ultimately periodic. That is, if there exists a threshold &lt;math&gt;t\in \N&lt;/math&gt; and a positive period &lt;math&gt;p\in\N^{&gt;0}&lt;/math&gt; such that, for all integer &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;|n|\ge t&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;n\in R&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;n+p\in R&lt;/math&gt;.

By the [[Cobham–Semenov theorem]], a relation is Presburger-definable if and only if it is definable in [[Büchi arithmetic]] of base &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;k\ge2&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=Alan | last=Cobham | title=On the base-dependence of sets of numbers recognizable by finite automata | journal=Math.

An integer relation &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is Presburger-definable if and only if all sets of integers which are definable in first order logic with addition and &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; (that is, Presburger Arithmetic plus a predicate for &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;) are Presburger-definable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Michaux|first1=Christian|last2=Villemaire|first2=Roger|title=Presburger Arithmetic and Recognizability of Sets of Natural Numbers by Automata: New Proofs of Cobham's and Semenov's Theorems|journal=Ann.

===Muchnik's characterization===
Presburger-definable relations admit another characterization: by Muchnik's theorem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Muchnik|first1=Andrei A.|title=The definable criterion for definability in Presburger arithmetic and its applications|journal=Theor. Comput. Sci.|date=2003|volume=290|pages=1433–1444|doi=10.1016/S0304-3975(02)00047-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is more complicated to state, but led to the proof of the two former characterizations. Before Muchnik's theorem can be stated, some additional definitions must be introduced.

Let &lt;math&gt;R\subseteq\N^d&lt;/math&gt; be a set, the section &lt;math&gt;x_i=j&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, for &lt;math&gt;i&lt;d&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;j\in\N&lt;/math&gt; is defined as 

:&lt;math&gt;\left \{(x_0,\ldots,x_{i-1},x_{i+1},\ldots,x_{d-1})\in\N^{d-1}\mid(x_0,\ldots,x_{i-1},j,x_{i+1},\ldots,x_{d-1})\in R \right \}.&lt;/math&gt;

Given two sets &lt;math&gt;R,S\subseteq\N^d&lt;/math&gt; and a &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;-tuple of integers &lt;math&gt;(p_0,\ldots,p_{d-1})\in\N^d&lt;/math&gt;, the set &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is called &lt;math&gt;(p_0,\dots,p_{d-1})&lt;/math&gt;-periodic in &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; if, for all &lt;math&gt;(x_0,\ldots,x_{d-1})\in S&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;(x_0+p_0,\dots,x_{d-1}+p_{d-1})\in S,&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;(x_0,\ldots,x_{d-1})\in R&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;(x_0+p_0,\dots,x_{d-1}+p_{d-1})\in R&lt;/math&gt;. For &lt;math&gt;s\in\N&lt;/math&gt;, the set  &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is said to be  &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;-periodic in &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; if it is  &lt;math&gt;(p_0,\ldots,p_{d-1})&lt;/math&gt;-periodic for some &lt;math&gt;(p_0,\dots,p_{d-1})\in\Z^d&lt;/math&gt; such that  

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=0}^{d-1}|p_i|&lt;s.&lt;/math&gt;

Finally, for &lt;math&gt;k,x_0,\dots,x_{d-1}\in\N&lt;/math&gt; let 

:&lt;math&gt;C(k,(x_0,\ldots,x_{d-1}))= \left \{(x_0+c_0,\dots,x_{d-1}+c_{d-1})\mid 0\leqslant c_i&lt; k \right \}&lt;/math&gt; 

denote the cube of size &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; whose lesser corner is &lt;math&gt;(x_0,\dots,x_{d-1})&lt;/math&gt;.

:'''Muchnik's Theorem.''' &lt;math&gt;R\subseteq\N^d&lt;/math&gt; is Presburger-definable if and only if:
:* if &lt;math&gt;d &gt; 1&lt;/math&gt; then  all sections of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; are Presburger-definable and 
:* there exists &lt;math&gt;s\in\N&lt;/math&gt; such that, for every &lt;math&gt;k\in\N&lt;/math&gt;, there exists &lt;math&gt;t\in\N&lt;/math&gt; such that for all &lt;math&gt;(x_0,\dots,x_{d-1})\in\N^d&lt;/math&gt; with 
:::&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=0}^{d-1}x_i&gt;t,&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;-periodic in &lt;math&gt;C(k,(x_0,\dots,x_{d-1}))&lt;/math&gt;.

Intuitively, the integer &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; represents the length of a shift, the integer &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is the size of the cubes and &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is the threshold before the periodicity. This result remains true when the condition 

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=0}^{d-1}x_i&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; 

is replaced either by &lt;math&gt;\min(x_0,\ldots,x_{d-1})&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; or by &lt;math&gt;\max(x_0,\ldots,x_{d-1})&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.

This characterization led to the so-called "definable criterion for definability in Presburger arithmetic", that is: there exists a first-order formula with addition and a &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;-ary predicate &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; which holds if and only if &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is interpreted by a Presburger-definable relation. Muchnik's theorem also allows one to prove that it is decidable whether an [[automatic sequence]] accepts a Presburger-definable set.

In [[measure theory]], '''[[projection (mathematics)|projection]] map ''' plays an important role in treating product spaces: The [[product sigma-algebra]] of [[measurable space]]s is defined to be the finest such that the projection mappings will be [[measurable function|measurable]]. Sometimes for some reasons product spaces are equipped with sigma-algebra different than ''the'' product sigma-algebra. In these cases the projections need not be measurable at all.

The projected set of a measurable set is called [[analytic set]] and need not be a measurable set. However, in some cases, either relatively to the product sigma-algebra or relatively to some other sigma-algebra, projected set of measurable set is indeed measurable.

[[Henri Lebesgue]] himself, one of the founders of measure theory, was mistaken about that fact. In a paper from 1905 he wrote that the projection of Borel set in the [[plane (geometry)|plane]] onto the [[real line]] is again a Borel set.&lt;ref&gt;Lebesgue, H. (1905) [https://eudml.org/doc/234955 Sur les fonctions représentables analytiquement]. Journal de Mathématiques Pures et Appliquées. Vol. 1, 139–216.&lt;/ref&gt; The mathematician [[Mikhail Yakovlevich Suslin]] found that error about ten years later, and his following research has led to [[descriptive set theory]].&lt;ref name="Moschovakis"&gt;{{cite book | authorlink=Yiannis N. Moschovakis | author=Moschovakis, Yiannis N. | title=Descriptive Set Theory|url=http://www.math.ucla.edu/~ynm/books.htm | publisher=North Holland | year=1980|page=2 |isbn=0-444-70199-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fundamental mistake of Lebesgue was to think that projection commutes with decreasing intersection, while there are simple counterexamples to that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://almostsure.wordpress.com/2016/11/08/measurable-projection-and-the-debut-theorem/#more-1873 |title=Measurable Projection and the Debut Theorem |last=Lowther |first=George |date=8 November 2016 |website=Almost Sure |access-date=21 March 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic examples==

As an example for not measurable projection, one can take the space &lt;math&gt;X := \left\{ 0,1 \right\}&lt;/math&gt; with the sigma-algebra &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F} := \left\{ \emptyset, \left\{ 0\right\}, \left\{ 1\right\}, \left\{ 0,1\right\} \right\}&lt;/math&gt; and the space &lt;math&gt;X := \left\{ 0,1 \right\}&lt;/math&gt; with the sigma-algebra &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{G} := \left\{ \emptyset, \left\{ 0,1\right\} \right\}&lt;/math&gt;. The diagonal set &lt;math&gt;\left\{ \left(0,0\right),\left(1,1\right)\right\} \subset X\times Y&lt;/math&gt; is not measurable relatively to &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}\otimes\mathcal{G}&lt;/math&gt;, although the both projections are measurable sets.

The common example for a non-measurable set which is a projection of a measurable set, is in [[Lebesgue sigma-algebra]]. Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt; be Lebesgue sigma-algebra of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}'&lt;/math&gt; be the Lebesgue sigma-algebra of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt;. For any bounded &lt;math&gt;N \subset \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; not in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt;, the set &lt;math&gt;N \times \left\{ 0 \right\}&lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}'&lt;/math&gt;, since [[Lebesgue measure]] is [[complete measure|complete]] and the product set is contained in a set of zero measure.

Still one can see that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}'&lt;/math&gt; is not the product sigma-algebra &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L} \otimes \mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt; but its completion. As for such example in product sigma-algebra, one can take the space &lt;math&gt;\left\{ 0,1\right\} ^{\mathbb{R}}&lt;/math&gt; (or any product along a set with cardinality greater than continuum) with the product sigma-algebra &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \mathcal{F}=\bigotimes_{t\in\mathbb{R}}\mathcal{F}_{t}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_{t}=\left\{ \emptyset,\left\{ 0\right\} ,\left\{ 1\right\} ,\left\{ 0,1\right\} \right\} &lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;t \in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;. In fact, in this case "most" of the projected sets are not measurable, since the cardinality of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0\cdot2^{\aleph_0}=2^{\aleph_0}&lt;/math&gt;, whereas the cardinality of the projected sets is &lt;math&gt;2^{2^{\aleph_0}}&lt;/math&gt;. There are also examples of Borel sets in the plane which their projection to the real line is not a Borel set, as suslin showed.&lt;ref name="Moschovakis" /&gt;

==Measurable projection theorem==

The following theorem gives a sufficient condition for the projection of measurable sets to be measurable.

Let &lt;math&gt;\left(X, \mathcal{F}\right)&lt;/math&gt; be a measurable space and let &lt;math&gt;\left(Y,\mathcal{B}\right)&lt;/math&gt; be a [[polish space]] where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B}&lt;/math&gt; is its Borel sigma-algebra. Then for every set in the product sigma-algebra &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F} \otimes \mathcal{B}&lt;/math&gt;, the projected set onto &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is in [[universally measurable set]] relatively to &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite book |last=Crauel |first=Hans |date= |title=Random Probability Measures on Polish Spaces |url=https://books.google.com/?id=RhT_aZGqmQEC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;dq=measurable+projection+theorem#v=onepage&amp;q=measurable%20projection%20theorem&amp;f=false |location=London |publisher=CRC Press |page=13 |isbn=0415273870 |series=STOCHASTICS MONOGRAPHS|author-link= |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An important spacial case of this theorem is that the projection of any Borel set ot &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; onto &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^{n-k}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;k&lt;n&lt;/math&gt; is Lebesgue-measurable, even though it is not necessarily a Borel set. In addition, it means that the former example of non-Lebesgue-measurable set of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; which is a projection of some measurable set of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt;, is the only sort of such example.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4478">In [[mathematics]], specifically in [[topology]], a '''pseudo-Anosov map''' is a type of a [[diffeomorphism]] or [[homeomorphism]] of a [[Surface (topology)|surface]]. It is a generalization of a linear [[Anosov diffeomorphism]] of the [[torus]]. Its definition relies on the notion of a '''measured foliation''' introduced by [[William Thurston]], who also coined the term "pseudo-Anosov diffeomorphism" when he proved his [[Nielsen–Thurston classification|classification of diffeomorphisms of a surface]].

== Definition of a measured foliation ==
A '''measured foliation''' ''F'' on a closed surface ''S'' is a geometric structure on ''S'' which consists of a singular [[foliation]] and a measure in the transverse direction. In some neighborhood of a regular point of ''F'', there is a "flow box" ''&amp;phi;'': ''U'' → '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; which sends the leaves of ''F'' to the horizontal lines in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. If two such neighborhoods ''U''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''U''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; overlap then there is a '''transition function''' ''&amp;phi;''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; defined on ''&amp;phi;''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;(''U''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;), with the standard property

: &lt;math&gt; \phi_{ij}\circ\phi_j=\phi_i,&lt;/math&gt;

which must have the form

: &lt;math&gt; \phi(x,y)=(f(x,y),c\pm y)&lt;/math&gt;

for some constant ''c''. This assures that along a simple curve, the variation in ''y''-coordinate, measured locally in every chart, is a geometric quantity (i.e. independent of the chart) and permits the definition of a total variation along a simple closed curve on ''S''. A finite number of singularities of ''F'' of the type of "''p''-pronged saddle", ''p''≥3, are allowed. At such a singular point, the differentiable structure of the surface is modified to make the point into a conical point with the total angle ''&amp;pi;p''. The notion of a diffeomorphism of ''S'' is redefined with respect to this modified differentiable structure. With some technical modifications, these definitions extend to the case of a surface with boundary.

== Definition of a pseudo-Anosov map ==
A homeomorphism

:&lt;math&gt;f: S \to S &lt;/math&gt;

of a closed surface ''S'' is called '''pseudo-Anosov''' if there exists a transverse pair of measured foliations on ''S'', ''F''&lt;sup&gt;''s''&lt;/sup&gt; (stable) and ''F''&lt;sup&gt;''u''&lt;/sup&gt; (unstable), and a real number ''&amp;lambda;''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1 such that the foliations are preserved by ''f'' and their transverse measures are multiplied by 1/''&amp;lambda;'' and ''&amp;lambda;''. The number ''&amp;lambda;'' is called the '''stretch factor''' or '''dilatation''' of ''f''.

== Significance ==
Thurston constructed a compactification of the [[Teichmüller space]] ''T''(''S'') of a surface ''S'' such that the action induced on ''T''(''S'') by any diffeomorphism ''f'' of ''S'' extends to a homeomorphism of the Thurston compactification. The dynamics of this homeomorphism is the simplest when ''f'' is a pseudo-Anosov map: in this case, there are two fixed points on the Thurston boundary, one attracting and one repelling, and the homeomorphism behaves similarly to a hyperbolic automorphism of the [[Poincaré half-plane]]. A "generic" diffeomorphism of a surface of genus at least two is isotopic to a pseudo-Anosov diffeomorphism.

== Generalization ==
Using the theory of '''train tracks''', the notion of a pseudo-Anosov map has been extended to self-maps of graphs (on the topological side) and outer automorphisms of [[free group]]s (on the algebraic side). This leads to an analogue of Thurston classification for the case of automorphisms of free groups, developed by [[Mladen Bestvina|Bestvina]] and Handel.

'''Quantum key distribution''' ('''QKD''') is a [[secure communication]] method which implements a [[cryptographic protocol]] involving components of [[quantum mechanics]]. It enables two parties to produce a shared [[randomness|random]] secret [[key (cryptography)|key]] known only to them, which can then be used to encrypt and decrypt [[messages]]. It is often incorrectly called [[quantum cryptography]], as it is the best-known example of a quantum cryptographic task.

An important and unique property of quantum key distribution is the ability of the two communicating users to detect the presence of any third party trying to gain [[information theory|knowledge]] of the key. This results from a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics: the process of measuring a [[Physical system|quantum system]] in general disturbs the system. A third party trying to eavesdrop on the key must in some way measure it, thus introducing detectable anomalies. By using [[quantum superposition]]s or [[quantum entanglement]] and transmitting information in [[quantum state]]s, a communication system can be implemented that detects eavesdropping. If the level of eavesdropping is below a certain threshold, a key can be produced that is guaranteed to be secure (i.e. the eavesdropper has no information about it), otherwise no secure key is possible and communication is aborted.

The security of encryption that uses quantum key distribution relies on the foundations of quantum mechanics, in contrast to traditional [[public key cryptography]], which relies on the computational difficulty of [[One-way function|certain mathematical functions]], and cannot provide any mathematical proof as to the actual complexity of reversing the one-way functions used. QKD has provable security based on [[information theory]], and [[forward secrecy]].

Quantum key distribution is only used to produce and distribute a key, not to transmit any message data. This key can then be used with any chosen [[encryption algorithm]] to encrypt (and decrypt) a message, which can then be transmitted over a standard [[communication channel]]. The algorithm most commonly associated with QKD is the [[one-time pad]], as it is [[provably secure]] when used with a secret, random key.&lt;ref&gt;C. E. Shannon , Bell Syst. Tech. J. 28, 656 (1949)&lt;/ref&gt; In real-world situations, it is often also used with encryption using [[symmetric key algorithms]] like the [[Advanced Encryption Standard]] algorithm.

== Quantum key exchange ==
Quantum communication involves encoding information in quantum states, or [[qubit]]s, as opposed to classical communication's use of [[bit]]s. Usually, [[photons]] are used for these quantum states. Quantum key distribution exploits certain properties of these quantum states to ensure its security. There are several different approaches to quantum key distribution, but they can be divided into two main categories depending on which property they exploit.

; Prepare and measure protocols : In contrast to classical physics, the act of measurement is an integral part of quantum mechanics. In general, measuring an unknown quantum state changes that state in some way. This is a consequence of [[quantum indeterminacy]] and can be exploited in order to detect any eavesdropping on communication (which necessarily involves measurement) and, more importantly, to calculate the amount of information that has been intercepted.

; Entanglement based protocols : The quantum states of two (or more) separate objects can become linked together in such a way that they must be described by a combined quantum state, not as individual objects. This is known as [[Quantum entanglement|entanglement]] and means that, for example, performing a measurement on one object affects the other. If an entangled pair of objects is shared between two parties, anyone intercepting either object alters the overall system, revealing the presence of the third party (and the amount of information they have gained).

These two approaches can each be further divided into three families of protocols: discrete variable, continuous variable and distributed phase reference coding. Discrete variable protocols were the first to be invented, and they remain the most widely implemented. The other two families are mainly concerned with overcoming practical limitations of experiments. The two protocols described below both use discrete variable coding.

=== BB84 protocol: Charles H. Bennett and Gilles Brassard (1984) ===
{{Main|BB84}}
This protocol, known as [[BB84]] after its inventors and year of publication, was originally described using [[photon polarization]] states to transmit the information.&lt;ref&gt;C. H. Bennett and G. Brassard. Quantum cryptography: Public key distribution and coin tossing. In Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Computers, Systems and Signal Processing, volume 175, page 8. New York, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; However, any two pairs of [[Conjugate variables|conjugate]] states can be used for the protocol, and many [[optical fibre]] based implementations described as BB84 use phase encoded states. The sender (traditionally referred to as [[Alice and Bob|Alice]]) and the receiver (Bob) are connected by a [[quantum communication channel]] which allows [[quantum states]] to be transmitted. In the case of photons this channel is generally either an optical fibre or simply [[free space]]. In addition they communicate via a public classical channel, for example using broadcast radio or the internet. The protocol is designed with the assumption that an [[eavesdropper]] (referred to as Eve) can interfere in any way with the quantum channel, while the classical channel needs to be [[authenticated]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A largely self-contained and complete security proof for quantum key distribution |first1=Marco |last1=Tomamichel |first2=Anthony |last2=Leverrier |date=2017 |arxiv=1506.08458 |doi=10.22331/q-2017-07-14-14 |journal=Quantum |volume=1 |pages=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Cryptographic security of quantum key distribution |first1=Christopher |last1=Portmann |first2=Renato |last2=Renner |arxiv=1409.3525}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The security of the protocol comes from encoding the information in [[Orthogonality|non-orthogonal states]]. [[Quantum indeterminacy]] means that these states cannot in general be measured without disturbing the original state (see [[No cloning theorem]]). BB84 uses two pairs of states, with each pair [[Conjugate variables|conjugate]] to the other pair, and the two states within a pair orthogonal to each other. Pairs of orthogonal states are referred to as a [[Basis (linear algebra)|basis]]. The usual polarization state pairs used are either the [[linear polarization|rectilinear basis]] of vertical (0°) and horizontal (90°), the [[linear polarization|diagonal basis]] of 45° and 135° or the [[circular polarization|circular basis]] of left- and right-handedness. Any two of these bases are conjugate to each other, and so any two can be used in the protocol. Below the rectilinear and diagonal bases are used.

The first step in BB84 is quantum transmission. Alice creates a random [[bit]] (0 or 1) and then randomly selects one of her two bases (rectilinear or diagonal in this case) to transmit it in. She then prepares a photon polarization state depending both on the bit value and basis, as shown in the adjacent table. So for example a 0 is encoded in the rectilinear basis (+) as a vertical polarization state, and a 1 is encoded in the diagonal basis (x) as a 135° state. Alice then transmits a single photon in the state specified to Bob, using the quantum channel. This process is then repeated from the random bit stage, with Alice recording the state, basis and time of each photon sent.

According to quantum mechanics (particularly [[quantum indeterminacy]]), no possible measurement distinguishes between the 4 different polarization states, as they are not all orthogonal. The only possible measurement is between any two orthogonal states (an orthonormal basis). So, for example, measuring in the rectilinear basis gives a result of horizontal or vertical. If the photon was created as horizontal or vertical (as a rectilinear [[eigenstate]]) then this measures the correct state, but if it was created as 45° or 135° (diagonal eigenstates) then the rectilinear measurement instead returns either horizontal or vertical at random. Furthermore, after this measurement the photon is polarized in the state it was measured in (horizontal or vertical), with all information about its initial polarization lost.

As Bob does not know the basis the photons were encoded in, all he can do is to select a basis at random to measure in, either rectilinear or diagonal. He does this for each photon he receives, recording the time, measurement basis used and measurement result. After Bob has measured all the photons, he communicates with Alice over the public classical channel. Alice broadcasts the basis each photon was sent in, and Bob the basis each was measured in. They both discard photon measurements (bits) where Bob used a different basis, which is half on average, leaving half the bits as a shared key.

To check for the presence of an eavesdropper, Alice and Bob now compare a predetermined subset of their remaining bit strings. If a third party (usually referred to as Eve, for "eavesdropper") has gained any information about the photons' polarization, this introduces errors in Bob's measurements. Other environmental conditions can cause errors in a similar fashion. If more than &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; bits differ they abort the key and try again, possibly with a different quantum channel, as the security of the key cannot be guaranteed. &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is chosen so that if the number of bits known to Eve is less than this, [[privacy amplification]] can be used to reduce Eve's knowledge of the key to an arbitrarily small amount at the cost of reducing the length of the key.

=== E91 protocol: Artur Ekert (1991) ===

[[Artur Ekert]]'s scheme uses entangled pairs of photons. These can be created by Alice, by Bob, or by some source separate from both of them, including eavesdropper Eve. The photons are distributed so that Alice and Bob each end up with one photon from each pair.

The scheme relies on two properties of entanglement. First, the entangled states are perfectly correlated in the sense that if Alice and Bob both measure whether their particles have vertical or horizontal polarizations, they always get the same answer with 100% probability. The same is true if they both measure any other pair of complementary (orthogonal) polarizations. This necessitates that the two distant parties have exact directionality synchronization. However, the particular results are completely random; it is impossible for Alice to predict if she (and thus Bob) will get vertical polarization or horizontal polarization. Second, any attempt at eavesdropping by Eve destroys these correlations in a way that Alice and Bob can detect.

Similarly to [[BB84]], the protocol involves a private measurement protocol before detecting the presence of Eve. The measurement stage involves Alice measuring each photon she receives using some basis from the set &lt;math&gt; Z_{0}, Z_{\frac{\pi}{8}}, Z_{\frac{\pi}{4}}&lt;/math&gt; while Bob chooses from  &lt;math&gt; Z_{0}, Z_{\frac{\pi}{8}}, Z_{-\frac{\pi}{8}}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;Z_{\theta}&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;\{|\uparrow \rangle, \; |\rightarrow \rangle\}&lt;/math&gt; basis rotated by &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;. They keep their series of basis choices private until measurements are completed. Two groups of photons are made: the first consists of photons measured using the same basis by Alice and Bob while the second contains all other photons. To detect eavesdropping, they can compute the test statistic &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; using the correlation coefficients between Alice's bases and Bob's similar to that shown in the [[Bell test experiments]]. Maximally entangled photons would result in &lt;math&gt;|S|=2\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;. If this were not the case, then Alice and Bob can conclude Eve has introduced local realism to the system, violating [[Bell's Theorem]]. If the protocol is successful, the first group can be used to generate keys since those photons are completely anti-aligned between Alice and Bob.

== Information reconciliation and privacy amplification ==
The quantum key distribution protocols described above provide Alice and Bob with nearly identical shared keys, and also with an estimate of the discrepancy between the keys. These differences can be caused by eavesdropping, but also by imperfections in the transmission line and detectors. As it is impossible to distinguish between these two types of errors, guaranteed security requires the assumption that all errors are due to eavesdropping. Provided the error rate between the keys is lower than a certain threshold (20% as of April 2007&lt;ref&gt;H. Chau, Physical Review A 66, 60302 (2002) ([http://hub.hku.hk/bitstream/123456789/43370/1/75688.pdf]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }})&lt;/ref&gt;), two steps can be performed to first remove the erroneous bits and then reduce Eve's knowledge of the key to an arbitrary small value. These two steps are known as '''information reconciliation''' and '''privacy amplification''' respectively, and were first described in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;C. H. Bennett, F. Bessette, G. Brassard, L. Salvail and J. Smolin "[http://cs.uccs.edu/~cs691/crypto/BBBSS92.pdf Experimental Quantum Cryptography]" Journal of Cryptology vol.5, no.1, 1992, pp. 3-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Information reconciliation''' is a form of error correction carried out between Alice and Bob's keys, in order to ensure both keys are identical. It is conducted over the public channel and as such it is vital to minimise the information sent about each key, as this can be read by Eve. A common protocol used for information reconciliation is the '''cascade protocol''', proposed in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;G. Brassard and L. Salvail "Secret key reconciliation by public discussion" Advances in Cryptology: Eurocrypt 93 Proc. pp 410-23 (1993) ([http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.42.9686])&lt;/ref&gt; This operates in several rounds, with both keys divided into blocks in each round and the [[parity (telecommunication)|parity]] of those blocks compared. If a difference in parity is found then a [[binary search]] is performed to find and correct the error. If an error is found in a block from a previous round that had correct parity then another error must be contained in that block; this error is found and corrected as before. This process is repeated recursively, which is the source of the cascade name. After all blocks have been compared, Alice and Bob both reorder their keys in the same random way, and a new round begins. At the end of multiple rounds Alice and Bob have identical keys with high probability; however, Eve has additional information about the key from the parity information exchanged. However, from a coding theory point of view information reconciliation is essentially source coding with side information, in consequence any coding scheme that works for  this problem can be used for information reconciliation. Lately turbocodes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |first1= Kim-Chi |last1=Nguyen |first2= Gilles |last2=Van Assche |first3= Nicolas J. |last3= Cerf |title= Side-Information Coding with Turbo Codes and its Application to Quantum Key Distribution |date= 10–13 October 2004 |eprint= cs/0406001}} Parma, Italy.&lt;/ref&gt; LDPC codes &lt;ref&gt;D. Elkouss and J. Martinez-Mateo and V. Martin, Quantum Information &amp; Computation 11, 226 (2011) ([http://www.dma.fi.upm.es/jmartinez/doc/qic-11-34_0226-0238.pdf])&lt;/ref&gt; and polar codes &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite arxiv |eprint = 1204.5882v3|last1 = Nguyen|first1 = Kim-Chi|title = High Performance Error Correction for Quantum Key Distribution using Polar Codes|author2 = Gilles Van Assche|last3 = Cerf|first3 = Nicolas J.|class = quant-ph|year = 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been used for this purpose improving the efficiency of the cascade protocol.

'''Privacy amplification''' is a method for reducing (and effectively eliminating) Eve's partial information about Alice and Bob's key. This partial information could have been gained both by eavesdropping on the quantum channel during key transmission (thus introducing detectable errors), and on the public channel during information reconciliation (where it is assumed Eve gains all possible parity information). Privacy amplification uses Alice and Bob's key to produce a new, shorter key, in such a way that Eve has only negligible information about the new key. This can be done using a [[universal hashing|universal hash function]], chosen at random from a publicly known set of such functions, which takes as its input a binary string of length equal to the key and outputs a binary string of a chosen shorter length. The amount by which this new key is shortened is calculated, based on how much information Eve could have gained about the old key (which is known due to the errors this would introduce), in order to reduce the probability of Eve having any knowledge of the new key to a very low value.

The highest bit rate system currently demonstrated exchanges secure keys at 1 Mbit/s (over 20&amp;nbsp;km of optical fibre) and 10 kbit/s (over 100&amp;nbsp;km of fibre), achieved by a collaboration between the [[University of Cambridge]] and [[Toshiba]] using the [[BB84]] protocol with [[decoy state]] pulses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |arxiv = 0810.1069v1|last1 = Nguyen|first1 = Kim-Chi|title = Gigahertz decoy quantum key distribution with 1 Mbit/s secure key rate|journal = Optics Express|volume = 16|issue = 23|pages = 18790–7|author2 = Gilles Van Assche|last3 = Cerf|first3 = Nicolas J.|last4 = Sharpe|first4 = A.

Also in June 2017, as part of the [[Quantum Experiments at Space Scale]] project, Chinese physicists led by [[Pan Jianwei]] at the [[University of Science and Technology of China]] measured entangled photons over a distance of 1203&amp;nbsp;km between two ground stations, laying the groundwork for future intercontinental quantum key distribution experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/06/chinas-quantum-satellite-achieves-spooky-action-record-distance |title=China's quantum satellite achieves 'spooky action' at a record distance |date=2017-06-15 |accessdate=2017-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Photons were sent from one ground station to the satellite they had named ''[[Micius (satellite)|Micius]]'' and back down to another ground station, where they "observed a survival of two-photon entanglement and a violation of Bell inequality by 2.37 ± 0.09 under strict Einstein locality conditions" along a "summed length varying from 1600 to 2400 kilometers."&lt;ref&gt;J.

=== Commercial ===

There are currently four companies offering commercial quantum key distribution systems; [[ID Quantique]] (Geneva), [[MagiQ Technologies, Inc.]] (New York), [[QuintessenceLabs]] (Australia) and SeQureNet (Paris). Several other companies also have active research programs, including [[Toshiba]], [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]], [[IBM]], [[Mitsubishi]], [[NEC]] and [[Nippon Telegraph and Telephone|NTT]] (See [[#External links|External links]] for direct research links).

The world's first [[computer network]] protected by quantum key distribution was implemented in October 2008, at a scientific conference in Vienna. The name of this network is [[Secure Communication based on Quantum Cryptography|SECOQC]] ('''Se'''cure '''Co'''mmunication Based on '''Q'''uantum '''C'''ryptography) and the [[European Union|EU]] funded this project. The network used 200&amp;nbsp;km of standard [[fibre optic cable]] to interconnect six locations across Vienna and the town of [[St Poelten]] located 69&amp;nbsp;km to the west.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/7661311.stm|title='Unbreakable' encryption unveiled|date=9 October 2008|publisher=|accessdate=18 August 2016|via=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== SwissQuantum ====
[[Id Quantique]] has successfully completed the longest running project for testing Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) in a field environment. The main goal of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20150228080058/http://swissquantum.idquantique.com/ SwissQuantum network project] installed in the Geneva metropolitan area in March 2009, was to validate the reliability and robustness of QKD in continuous operation over a long time period in a field environment. The quantum layer operated for nearly 2 years until the project was shut down in January 2011 shortly after the initially planned duration of the test.

==== Chinese networks ====
In May 2009, a hierarchical quantum network was demonstrated in [[Wuhu]], [[China]]. The hierarchical network consisted of a backbone network of four nodes connecting a number of subnets. The backbone nodes were connected though an optical switching quantum router. Nodes within each subnet were also connected though an optical switch, which were connected to the backbone network though a trusted relay.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

The Tokyo QKD Network&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uqcc2010.org/highlights/index.html Tokyo QKD Network unveiled at UQCC 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; was inaugurated on the first day of the UQCC2010 conference. The network involves an international collaboration between 7 partners; [[NEC]], [[Mitsubishi Electric]], [[Nippon Telegraph and Telephone|NTT]] and [[NICT]] from Japan, and participation from Europe by [[Toshiba]] Research Europe Ltd. (UK), [[Id Quantique]] (Switzerland) and All Vienna (Austria). "All Vienna" is represented by researchers from the [[Austrian Institute of Technology]] (AIT), the [[Institute for Quantum Optics and Quantum Information]] (IQOQI) and the [[University of Vienna]].

==== Los Alamos National Laboratory ====
A hub-and-spoke network has been operated by Los Alamos National Laboratory since 2011. All messages are routed via the hub. The system equips each node in the network with quantum transmitters—i.e., lasers—but not with expensive and bulky photon detectors. Only the hub receives quantum messages. To communicate, each node sends a one-time pad to the hub, which it then uses to communicate securely over a classical link. The hub can route this message to another node using another one time pad from the second node. The entire network is secure only if the central hub is secure. Individual nodes require little more than a laser: Prototype nodes are around the size of a box of matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|eprint=1305.0305|last1=Hughes|first1=Richard J.|last2=Nordholt|first2=Jane E.|last3=McCabe|first3=Kevin P.|last4=Newell|first4=Raymond T.|last5=Peterson|first5=Charles G.|last6=Somma|first6=Rolando D.|title=Network-Centric Quantum Communications with Application to Critical   Infrastructure Protection|class=quant-ph|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Attacks and security proofs ==

===Intercept and resend ===
The simplest type of possible attack is the intercept-resend attack, where Eve measures the quantum states (photons) sent by Alice and then sends replacement states to Bob, prepared in the state she measures. In the BB84 protocol, this produces errors in the key Alice and Bob share. As Eve has no knowledge of the basis a state sent by Alice is encoded in, she can only guess which basis to measure in, in the same way as Bob. If she chooses correctly, she measures the correct photon polarization state as sent by Alice, and resends the correct state to Bob. However, if she chooses incorrectly, the state she measures is random, and the state sent to Bob cannot be the same as the state sent by Alice. If Bob then measures this state in the same basis Alice sent, he too gets a random result&amp;mdash;as Eve has sent him a state in the opposite basis—with a 50% chance of an erroneous result (instead of the correct result he would get without the presence of Eve). The table below shows an example of this type of attack.

The probability Eve chooses the incorrect basis is 50% (assuming Alice chooses randomly), and if Bob measures this intercepted photon in the basis Alice sent he gets a random result, i.e., an incorrect result with probability of 50%. The probability an intercepted photon generates an error in the key string is then 50% × 50% = 25%. If Alice and Bob publicly compare &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; of their key bits (thus discarding them as key bits, as they are no longer secret) the probability they find disagreement and identify the presence of Eve is

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;P_d = 1 - \left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^n&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

So to detect an eavesdropper with probability &lt;math&gt;P_d = 0.999999999&lt;/math&gt; Alice and Bob need to compare &lt;math&gt;n = 72&lt;/math&gt; key bits.

=== Man-in-the-middle attack ===
Quantum key distribution is vulnerable to a [[man-in-the-middle attack]] when used without authentication to the same extent as any classical protocol, since no known principle of quantum mechanics can distinguish friend from foe. As in the classical case, Alice and Bob cannot authenticate each other and establish a secure connection without some means of verifying each other's identities (such as an initial shared secret). If Alice and Bob have an initial shared secret then they can use an unconditionally secure authentication scheme (such as [[Carter-Wegman MAC|Carter-Wegman]],&lt;ref&gt;M. N. Wegman and J. L. Carter, "New hash functions and their use in authentication and set equality, Journal of Computer and System Sciences", 22, pp 265-279, (1981)&lt;/ref&gt;) along with quantum key distribution to exponentially expand this key, using a small amount of the new key to authenticate the next session.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite arxiv |eprint = quant-ph/0701168|last1 = Nguyen|first1 = Kim-Chi|title = Using quantum key distribution for cryptographic purposes: A survey|author2 = Gilles Van Assche|last3 = Cerf|first3 = Nicolas J.|year = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several methods to create this initial shared secret have been proposed, for example using a 3rd party&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zhang | first1 = Z. | last2 = Liu | first2 = J. | last3 = Wang | first3 = D. | last4 = Shi | first4 = S. | year = 2007 | title = Quantum direct communication with authentication | url = | journal = Phys.

Unconditionally secure authentication|publisher=|accessdate=18 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Photon number splitting attack ===
In the [[BB84]] protocol Alice sends quantum states to Bob using single photons. In practice many implementations use laser pulses attenuated to a very low level to send the quantum states. These laser pulses contain a very small number of photons, for example 0.2 photons per pulse, which are distributed according to a [[Poissonian distribution]]. This means most pulses actually contain no photons (no pulse is sent), some pulses contain 1 photon (which is desired) and a few pulses contain 2 or more photons. If the pulse contains more than one photon, then Eve can split off the extra photons and transmit the remaining single photon to Bob. This is the basis of the photon number splitting attack,&lt;ref&gt;G. Brassard, N. Lütkenhaus, T. Mor, and B. C. Sanders. "Limitations on practical quantum cryptography." Physical Review Letters, 85(6):1330+ (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; where Eve stores these extra photons in a quantum memory until Bob detects the remaining single photon and Alice reveals the encoding basis. Eve can then measure her photons in the correct basis and obtain information on the key without introducing detectable errors.

Even with the possibility of a PNS attack a secure key can still be generated, as shown in the GLLP security proof;&lt;ref name="GLLP" /&gt; however, a much higher amount of privacy amplification is needed reducing the secure key rate significantly (with PNS the rate scales as &lt;math&gt;t^2&lt;/math&gt; as compared to &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; for a single photon sources, where &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is the transmittance of the quantum channel).

There are several solutions to this problem. The most obvious is to use a true single photon 
source instead of an attenuated laser. While such sources are still at a developmental stage QKD has been carried out successfully with them.&lt;ref&gt;P. M. Intallura, M. B. Ward, O. Z. Karimov, Z. L. Yuan, P. See, A. J. Shields, P. Atkinson, and D. A. Ritchie, Appl. Phys. Lett. 91, 161103 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; However, as current sources operate at a low efficiency and frequency key rates and transmission distances are limited. Another solution is to modify the BB84 protocol, as is done for example in the [[SARG04]] protocol,&lt;ref&gt;V. Scarani, A. Ac´ın, G. Ribordy and N. Gisin, Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 057901 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; in which the secure key rate scales as &lt;math&gt;t^{3/2}&lt;/math&gt;. The most promising solution is the [[decoy states]]&lt;ref name="HwangDecoy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VWDecoy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wangDecoy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LoDecoy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PracticalDecoy"/&gt; in which Alice randomly sends some of her laser pulses with a lower average photon number. These [[decoy states]] can be used to detect a PNS attack, as Eve has no way to tell which pulses are signal and which decoy. Using this idea the secure key rate scales as &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, the same as for a single photon source. This idea has been implemented successfully first at the University of Toronto,&lt;ref&gt;Y.Zhao, B. Qi, X. Ma, H.-K. Lo, and L. Qian, Phys. Rev. Lett., 96, 070502 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Y.Zhao, B. Qi, X. Ma, H.-K. Lo, and L. Qian, in Proc. IEEE ISIT, pp. 2094--2098 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; and in several follow-up QKD experiments,&lt;ref&gt;Z. L. Yuan, A. W. Sharpe, and A. J. Shields, Appl. Phys. Lett. 90, 011118 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; allowing for high key rates secure against all known attacks.

=== Denial of service ===
Because currently a dedicated fibre optic line (or line of sight in free space) is required between the two points linked by quantum key distribution, a [[denial of service attack]] can be mounted by simply cutting or blocking the line. This is one of the motivations for the development of [[quantum network|quantum key distribution networks]], which would route communication via alternate links in case of disruption.

===Trojan-horse attacks ===
A quantum key distribution system may be probed by Eve by sending in bright light from the quantum channel and analyzing the back-reflections in a Trojan-horse attack. In a recent research study it has been shown that Eve discerns Bob's secret basis choice with higher than 90% probability, breaching the security of the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jain | first1 = N. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2014 | title = Trojan-horse attacks threaten the security of practical quantum cryptography | journal = New Journal of Physics | volume = 16 | issue = 12| page = 123030 | doi=10.1088/1367-2630/16/12/123030| arxiv = 1406.5813 | bibcode = 2014NJPh...16l3030J }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Security proofs ===
If Eve is assumed to have unlimited resources, for example both classical and quantum computing power, there are many more attacks possible. BB84 has been proven secure against any attacks allowed by quantum mechanics, both for sending information using an ideal photon source which only ever emits a single photon at a time,&lt;ref&gt;P. W. Shor and J. Preskill, Physical Review Letters 85, 441 (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; and also using practical photon sources which sometimes emit multiphoton pulses.&lt;ref name="GLLP"&gt;D. Gottesman, H.-K. Lo, N. L¨utkenhaus, and J. Preskill, Quant. Inf. Comp. 4, 325 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; These proofs are unconditionally secure in the sense that no conditions are imposed on the resources available to the eavesdropper; however, there are other conditions required:
# Eve cannot physically access Alice and Bob's encoding and decoding devices.
# The random number generators used by Alice and Bob must be trusted and truly random (for example a [[Hardware random number generator|Quantum random number generator]]).
# The classical communication channel must be authenticated using an [[Man-in-the-middle attack#Quantum cryptography|unconditionally secure authentication]] scheme.
# The message must be encrypted using [[one-time pad]] like scheme.

== Quantum hacking ==
Hacking attacks target vulnerabilities in the operation of a QKD protocol or deficiencies in the components of the physical devices used in construction of the QKD system. If the equipment used in quantum key distribution can be tampered with, it could be made to generate keys that were not secure using a [[random number generator attack]]. Another common class of attacks is the [[Trojan horse]] attack&lt;ref&gt;Vakhitov, A. V. Makarov and D. R. Hjelme, J. Mod. Opt. 48, 2023 (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; which does not require physical access to the endpoints: rather than attempt to read Alice and Bob's single photons, Eve sends a large pulse of light back to Alice in between transmitted photons. Alice's equipment reflects some of Eve's light, revealing the state of Alice's basis (e.g., a polarizer). This attack can be detected, e.g. by using a classical detector to check the non-legitimate signals (i.e. light from Eve) entering Alice's system. It is also conjectured{{by whom|date=February 2018}} that most hacking attacks can similarly be defeated by modifying the implementation, though there is no formal proof.

Several other attacks including faked-state attacks,&lt;ref&gt;V. Makarov and D. R. Hjelme, J. Mod. Opt. 52, 691. (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; phase remapping attacks,&lt;ref&gt;C.-H. F. Fung, B. Qi, K. Tamaki, and H.-K. Lo, Phys. Rev. A 75, 032314. (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; and time-shift attacks&lt;ref&gt;B. Qi, C.-H. F. Fung, H.-K. Lo, and X. Ma, Quant. Info. Compu. 7, 43 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; are now known. The time-shift attack has even been demonstrated on a commercial quantum cryptosystem.&lt;ref&gt;Y. Zhao, C.-H. F. Fung, B. Qi, C. Chen, and H.-K. Lo, Phys. Rev. A 78:042333 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; This is the first demonstration of quantum hacking against a non-homemade quantum key distribution system. Later on, the phase-remapping attack was also demonstrated on a specially configured, research oriented open QKD system (made and provided by the Swiss company [[Id Quantique]] under their Quantum Hacking program).&lt;ref&gt;F. Xu, B. Qi, and H.-K. Lo, New J. Phys. 12, 113026 (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the first ‘intercept-and-resend’ attacks on top of a widely used QKD implementation in commercial QKD systems. This work has been widely reported in media.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/05/18/quantum_crypto_attack/ Quantum crypto boffins in successful backdoor sniff - Erroneous error-handling undermines bulletproofness] retrieved 2010-05-26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2010/100520/full/news.2010.256.html|title=Quantum crack in cryptographic armour|first=Zeeya|last=Merali|date=20 May 2010|accessdate=18 August 2016|via=www.nature.com|doi=10.1038/news.2010.256|journal=Nature}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.economist.com/node/16681905 | work=The Economist | title=Light fantastic | date=26 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/42667 |title=Quantum cryptography system hacked - physicsworld.com |access-date=26 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111108030705/http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/42667 |archive-date=8 November 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This has sparked research on new approaches to securing communications networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= Richard Hughes and Jane Nordholt |title= Refining Quantum Cryptography |journal=Science|pages= 1584–6 |volume= 333 |date= 16 September 2011|doi= 10.1126/science.1208527|pmid= 21921186|issue= 6049|bibcode = 2011Sci...333.1584H |url= https://zenodo.org/record/1230916 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Counterfactual quantum key distribution==
The task of distributing a secret key could be achieved even when the particle (on which the secret information, e.g. polarization, has been encoded) does not traverse through the quantum channel using a protocol developed by Tae-Gon Noh.&lt;ref&gt;Tae-Gon Noh, ''Counterfactual Quantum Cryptography,'' Physical Review Letters, 103, Issue 23, 230501 (2009) serves to explain how this non-intuitive or counterfactual idea actually works.&lt;/ref&gt; Here Alice generates a photon which randomly takes either path (a) or path (b). Path (a) stays inside Alice's secure device and path (b) goes to Bob. By rejecting the photons that Bob receives and only accepting the ones he doesn't receive, Bob &amp; Alice can set up a secure channel, i.e. Eve's attempts to read the ''counterfactual'' photons would still be detected. This protocol uses the quantum phenomenon whereby the possibility that a photon can be sent has an effect even when it isn't sent. So-called [[interaction-free measurement]] also uses this quantum effect, as for example in the [[Elitzur-Vaidman bomb-testing problem|bomb testing problem]], whereby you can determine which bombs are not duds without setting them off, except in a [[counterfactual definiteness|counterfactual]] sense.

== History ==
Quantum cryptography was proposed first by [[Stephen Wiesner]], then at Columbia University in New York, who, in the early 1970s, introduced the concept of quantum conjugate coding. His seminal paper titled "Conjugate Coding" was rejected by IEEE Information Theory but was eventually published in 1983 in SIGACT News (15:1 pp.&amp;nbsp;78–88, 1983). In this paper he showed how to store or transmit two messages by encoding them in two "conjugate observables", such as linear and circular polarization of light, so that either, but not both, of which may be received and decoded. He illustrated his idea with a design of unforgeable bank notes. A decade later, building upon this work, [[Charles H. Bennett (computer scientist)|Charles H. Bennett]], of the IBM [[Thomas J. Watson Research Center]],  and [[Gilles Brassard]], of the [[University of Montreal]], proposed a method for secure communication based on Wiesner’s "conjugate observables". In 1990, [[Artur Ekert]], then a Ph.D. student at [[Wolfson College, Oxford|Wolfson College, University of Oxford]], developed a different approach to quantum key distribution based on peculiar quantum correlations known as quantum entanglement.

== Future ==
The current commercial systems are aimed mainly at governments and corporations with high security requirements. Key distribution by courier is typically used in such cases, where traditional key distribution schemes are not believed to offer enough guarantee. This has the advantage of not being intrinsically distance limited, and despite long travel times the transfer rate can be high due to the availability of large capacity portable storage devices. The major difference of quantum key distribution is the ability to detect any interception of the key, whereas with courier the key security cannot be proven or tested. QKD (Quantum Key Distribution) systems also have the advantage of being automatic, with greater reliability and lower operating costs than a secure human courier network.

Factors preventing wide adoption of quantum key distribution outside high security areas include the cost of equipment, and the lack of a demonstrated threat to existing key exchange protocols. However, with optic fibre networks already present in many countries the infrastructure is in place for a more widespread use.

An Industry Specification Group (ISG) of the European Telecommunications Standards Institute ([[ETSI]]) has been set up to address standardisation issues in quantum cryptography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.etsi.org/technologies-clusters/technologies/quantum-key-distribution |title=ETSI - Quantum Key Distribution |work=etsi.org |year=2014 |accessdate=28 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A European Metrology Research Programme project ‘Metrology for Industrial Communications’ is developing the measurements required to characterise the optical components of faint-pulse QKD systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://projects.npl.co.uk/MIQC/index.html |title=MIQC - European Metrology Research Programme (EMRP) |work=projects.npl.co.uk |year=2014 |accessdate=28 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], in the [[representation theory]] of [[algebraic group]]s, a [[linear representation]] of an algebraic group is said to be '''rational''' if, viewed as a map from the group to the general linear group, it is a [[rational map]] of algebraic varieties.

Finite direct sums and products of rational representations are rational.

A rational &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; module is a module that can be expressed as a sum (not necessarily direct) of rational representations.

The rigid transformations include [[rotation (mathematics)|rotations]], [[translation (mathematics)|translations]], [[reflection (mathematics)|reflections]], or their combination.  Sometimes reflections are excluded from the definition of a rigid transformation by imposing that the transformation also preserve the [[orientation (mathematics)|handedness]] of figures in the Euclidean space (a reflection would not preserve handedness; for instance, it would transform a left hand into a right hand).  To avoid ambiguity, this smaller class of transformations is known as '''proper rigid transformations''' (informally, also known as '''roto-translations''').  In general, any proper rigid transformation can be decomposed as a rotation followed by a translation, while any rigid transformation can be decomposed as an [[improper rotation]] followed by a translation (or as a sequence of reflections).

Any object will keep the same [[shape]] and size after a proper rigid transformation.

All rigid transformations are examples of [[affine transformations]]. The set of all (proper and improper) rigid transformations is a [[group (mathematics)|group]] called the [[Euclidean group]], denoted E(''n'') for ''n''-dimensional Euclidean spaces. The set of proper rigid transformation is called special Euclidean group, denoted SE(''n'').

In [[kinematics]], proper rigid transformations in a 3-dimensional Euclidean space, denoted SE(3), are used to represent the [[Displacement (vector)|linear]] and [[angular displacement]] of [[Rigid body|rigid bodies]]. According to [[Chasles' theorem (kinematics)|Chasles' theorem]], every rigid transformation can be expressed as a [[screw displacement]].

== Formal definition ==
A rigid transformation is formally defined as a transformation that, when acting on any vector '''v''', produces a transformed vector ''T''('''v''') of the form
:''T''('''v''') = ''R'' '''v''' + '''t'''
where ''R''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; = ''R''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; (i.e., ''R'' is an [[orthogonal transformation]]), and '''t''' is a vector giving the translation of the origin.

A proper rigid transformation has, in addition,
: [[determinant|det]](R) = 1
which means that ''R'' does not produce a reflection, and hence it represents a [[rotation (mathematics)|rotation]] (an orientation-preserving orthogonal transformation). Indeed, when an orthogonal transformation matrix produces a reflection, its determinant is –1.

==Distance formula==
A measure of distance between points, or [[metric space|metric]], is needed in order to confirm that a transformation is rigid.  The [[Euclidean distance]] formula for R&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; is the generalization of the [[Pythagorean theorem]].  The formula gives the distance squared between two points '''X''' and '''Y''' as the sum of the squares of the distances along the coordinate axes, that is
:&lt;math&gt; d(\mathbf{X},\mathbf{Y})^2 = (X_1-Y_1)^2 + (X_2-Y_2)^2 + \ldots + (X_n-Y_n)^2 = (\mathbf{X}-\mathbf{Y})\cdot(\mathbf{X}-\mathbf{Y}). &lt;/math&gt;
where '''X'''=(X&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, X&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) and '''Y'''=(Y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, Y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., Y&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;), and the dot denotes the [[scalar product]].

Using this distance formula, a rigid transformation ''g'':R&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;→R&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; has the property,
:&lt;math&gt;d(g(\mathbf{X}), g(\mathbf{Y}))^2 = d(\mathbf{X}, \mathbf{Y})^2.&lt;/math&gt;

==Translations and linear transformations==
A [[translation (geometry)|translation]] of a vector space adds a vector '''d''' to every vector in the space, which means it is the transformation ''g''('''v'''):'''v'''→'''v'''+'''d'''.  It is easy to show that this is a rigid transformation by computing,
:&lt;math&gt;d(\mathbf{v}+\mathbf{d},\mathbf{w}+\mathbf{d})^2 = (\mathbf{v}+\mathbf{d} - \mathbf{w}-\mathbf{d})\cdot(\mathbf{v}+\mathbf{d} - \mathbf{w} -\mathbf{d})=(\mathbf{v} - \mathbf{w})\cdot(\mathbf{v}- \mathbf{w}) = d(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{w})^2.&lt;/math&gt;

A linear transformation of a vector space, ''L'':R&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;→ R&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;, has the property that the transformation of a vector, '''V'''=a'''v'''+b'''w''', is the sum of the transformations of its components, that is,
:&lt;math&gt; L(\mathbf{V})=L(a\mathbf{v}+b\mathbf{w})=aL(\mathbf{v})+bL(\mathbf{w}).&lt;/math&gt;
Each linear transformation ''L'' can be formulated as a matrix operation, which means ''L'':'''v'''→[L]'''v''', where [L] is an nxn matrix.

A linear transformation is a rigid transformation if it satisfies the condition,
:&lt;math&gt;d([L]\mathbf{v}, [L]\mathbf{w})^2 = d(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{w})^2,&lt;/math&gt;
that is
:&lt;math&gt;d([L]\mathbf{v}, [L]\mathbf{w})^2=([L]\mathbf{v}-[L]\mathbf{w})\cdot([L]\mathbf{v}-[L]\mathbf{w})=([L](\mathbf{v}-\mathbf{w}))\cdot([L](\mathbf{v}-\mathbf{w})).&lt;/math&gt;
Now use the fact that the scalar product of two vectors '''v'''.'''w''' can be written as the matrix operation '''v'''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;'''w''', where the T denotes the matrix transpose, we have
:&lt;math&gt;d([L]\mathbf{v}, [L]\mathbf{w})^2 = (\mathbf{v}-\mathbf{w})^T[L]^T[L](\mathbf{v}-\mathbf{w}).&lt;/math&gt;
Thus, the linear transformation ''L'' is rigid if its matrix satisfies the condition
:&lt;math&gt;[L]^T[L]=[I], &lt;/math&gt;
where [I] is the identity matrix.  Matrices that satisfy this condition are called ''orthogonal matrices.''  This condition actually requires the columns of these matrices to be orthogonal unit vectors.

Matrices that satisfy this condition form a mathematical [[group (mathematics)|group]] under the operation of matrix multiplication called the ''orthogonal group of nxn matrices'' and denoted ''O(n)''.

Compute the determinant of the condition for an [[orthogonal matrix]] to obtain
:&lt;math&gt; \det([L]^T[L]) =\det[L]^2 =\det[I] =1,&lt;/math&gt;
which shows that the matrix [L] can have a determinant of either +1 or -1.  Orthogonal matrices with determinant -1 are reflections, and those with determinant +1 are rotations.  Notice that the set of orthogonal matrices can be viewed as consisting of two manifolds in R&lt;sup&gt;nxn&lt;/sup&gt; separated by the set of singular matrices.

The set of rotation matrices is called the ''special orthogonal group,'' and denoted ''SO(n).''  It is an example of a [[Lie group]] because it has the structure of a manifold.

Also the structure of the article is confusing, as the relation between the different lists appearing in it is unclear (some lists seem explanations of the way of obtaining previous lists, and some lists seem duplicates, as expressing the same things in different terms.

[[File:Unit circle angles color.svg|250px|thumb|The primary solution angles in the form (cos,sin) on the [[unit circle]] are at multiples of 30 and 45 degrees.]]
{{Trigonometry}}
'''Exact [[algebraic expression]]s for [[trigonometric]] values''' are sometimes useful, mainly for simplifying solutions into [[Nth root|radical]] forms which allow further simplification.

All [[trigonometric number]]s – sines or cosines of rational multiples of 360° – are [[algebraic number]]s (solutions of [[polynomial equation]]s with integer coefficients); moreover they may be expressed in terms of radicals of [[complex number]]s; but not all of these are expressible in terms of ''real'' radicals. When they are, they are expressible more specifically in terms of square roots.

All values of the sines, cosines, and tangents of angles at 3° increments are expressible in terms of square roots, using identities – the [[list of trigonometric identities#Half-angle formulae|half-angle identity]], the [[list of trigonometric identities#Double-angle formulae|double-angle identity]], and the [[list of trigonometric identities#Angle sum and difference identities|angle addition/subtraction identity]] – and using values for 0°, 30°, 36°, and 45°. For an angle of an integer number of degrees that is not a multiple 3° ({{sfrac|{{pi}}|60}} [[radian]]s), the values of sine, cosine, and tangent cannot be expressed in terms of real radicals.

According to [[Niven's theorem]], the only rational values of the sine function for which the argument is a [[rational number]] of degrees are&amp;nbsp;0,&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|1|2}}, &amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;−{{sfrac|1|2}}, and&amp;nbsp;−1.

According to [[Baker's theorem]], if the value of a sine, a cosine or a tangent is algebraic, then the angle is either a rational number of degrees or a [[transcendental number]] of degrees. That is, if the angle is an algebraic, but non-rational, number of degrees, the trigonometric functions all have transcendental values.

==Scope of this article==
The list in this article is incomplete in several senses. First, the trigonometric functions of all angles that are integer multiples of those given can also be expressed in radicals, but some are omitted here.

Second, it is always possible to apply the half-angle formula to find an expression in radicals for a trigonometric function of one-half of any angle on the list, then half of that angle, etc.

Third, expressions in real radicals exist for a trigonometric function of a rational multiple of {{pi}} if and only if the denominator of the fully reduced rational multiple is a power of 2 by itself or the product of a power of 2 with the product of distinct [[Fermat prime]]s, of which the known ones are 3, 5, 17, 257, and 65537.

Fourth, this article only deals with trigonometric function values when the expression in radicals is in ''real'' radicals – roots of real numbers. Many other trigonometric function values are expressible in, for example, cube roots of [[complex number]]s that cannot be rewritten in terms of roots of real numbers. For example, the trigonometric function values of any angle that is one-third of an angle ''θ'' considered in this article can be expressed in cube roots and square roots by using the [[cubic equation|cubic equation formula]] to solve
:&lt;math&gt;4\cos^3 \frac \theta 3 - 3\cos \frac \theta 3 = \cos\theta,&lt;/math&gt;

but in general the solution for the cosine of the one-third angle involves the cube root of a complex number (giving ''[[casus irreducibilis]]'').

In practice, all values of sines, cosines, and tangents not found in this article are approximated using the techniques described at ''[[Trigonometric tables]]''.

==Table of some common angles==
&lt;!-- copied from [[List of trigonometric identities#angles]]. --&gt;
Several different [[units of angle measure]] are widely used, including [[degree (angle)|degree]]s, [[radian]]s, and [[gradian]]s ([[gon (angle)&lt;!-- deliberately going through redirect here --&gt;|gon]]s):
:1 full circle ([[turn (geometry)|turn]])&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;360&amp;nbsp;degrees&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2{{pi}} radians &amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp; 400 gons.

==Further angles==
[[File:Exact trigonometric table for multiples of 3°.jpg|thumb|Exact trigonometric table for multiples of 3 degrees.]]
Values outside the [0°,&amp;nbsp;45°] angle range are trivially derived from these values, using circle axis [[coordinate rotations and reflections|reflection]] [[symmetry]]. (See [[List of trigonometric identities#Reflections, shifts, and periodicity|List of trigonometric identities]].)

In the entries below, when a certain number of degrees is related to a regular polygon, the relation is that the number of degrees in each angle of the polygon is (''n''&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;2) times the indicated number of degrees (where ''n'' is the number of sides). This is because the sum of the angles of any ''n''-gon is 180°&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;(''n''&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;2) and so the measure of each angle of any regular ''n''-gon is 180°&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;(''n''&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;2)&amp;nbsp;÷&amp;nbsp;''n''. Thus for example the entry "45°: square" means that, with ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4, 180°&amp;nbsp;÷&amp;nbsp;''n'' =&amp;nbsp;45°, and the number of degrees in each angle of a square is (''n''&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;2)&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;45° =&amp;nbsp;90°.

==Notes==

===Uses for constants===
As an example of the use of these constants, consider the volume of a [[regular dodecahedron]], where ''a'' is the length of an edge:
:&lt;math&gt;V=\frac{5a^3\cos36^\circ}{\tan^2{36^\circ}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Using
:&lt;math&gt;\cos 36^\circ=\frac{\sqrt5+1}{4},\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\tan 36^\circ=\sqrt{5-2\sqrt5},\,&lt;/math&gt;
this can be simplified to:
:&lt;math&gt;V=\frac{a^3\left(15+7\sqrt5\right)}{4}.\,&lt;/math&gt;

===Derivation triangles===
[[File:Polygontriangle.gif|thumb|right|Regular polygon (''n''-sided) and its fundamental right triangle. Angles: ''a''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|180°|''n''}} and ''b''&amp;nbsp;=90(1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|2|''n''}})°]]

The derivation of sine, cosine, and tangent constants into radial forms is based upon the [[constructible polygon|constructibility]] of right triangles.

Here right triangles made from symmetry sections of regular polygons are used to calculate fundamental trigonometric ratios. Each right triangle represents three points in a regular polygon: a vertex, an edge center containing that vertex, and the polygon center. An ''n''-gon can be divided into 2''n'' right triangles with angles of {{sfrac|180|''n''}}, 90&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|180|''n''}}, 90} degrees, for ''n'' in 3, 4, 5, &amp;hellip;

Constructibility of 3, 4, 5, and 15-sided polygons are the basis, and angle bisectors allow multiples of two to also be derived.

==Calculated trigonometric values for sine and cosine==

===The trivial values===
In degree format, sin and cos of 0, 30, 45, 60, and 90 can be calculated from their right angled triangles, using the Pythagorean theorem.

In radian format, sin and cos of {{pi}} / 2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; can be expressed in radical format by recursively applying the following:
:&lt;math&gt;2\cos\theta = \sqrt{2 + 2\cos2\theta} = \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2 + 2\cos4\theta}} = \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2+2\cos8\theta}}} &lt;/math&gt; and so on.
:&lt;math&gt;2\sin\theta = \sqrt{2 - 2\cos2\theta} = \sqrt{2 - \sqrt{2 + 2\cos4\theta}} = \sqrt{2 - \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2+2\cos8\theta}}} &lt;/math&gt; and so on.

For example:
:&lt;math&gt;\cos\frac{\pi}{2^1} = \frac{0}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\cos\frac{\pi}{2^2} = \frac{\sqrt{2+0}}{2}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sin\frac{\pi}{2^2} = \frac{\sqrt{2-0}}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\cos\frac{\pi}{2^3} = \frac{\sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2}}}{2}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sin\frac{\pi}{2^3} = \frac{\sqrt{2 - \sqrt{2}}}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\cos\frac{\pi}{2^4} = \frac{\sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2}}}}{2}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sin\frac{\pi}{2^4} = \frac{\sqrt{2 - \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2}}}}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\cos\frac{\pi}{2^5} = \frac{\sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2}}}}}{2}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sin\frac{\pi}{2^5} = \frac{\sqrt{2 - \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2}}}}}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\cos\frac{\pi}{2^6} = \frac{\sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2}}}}}}{2}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sin\frac{\pi}{2^6} = \frac{\sqrt{2 - \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2}}}}}}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
and so on.

:&lt;math&gt;\cos\frac{\pi}{3 \times 2^2} = \frac{\sqrt{2 + \sqrt{3}}}{2}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sin\frac{\pi}{3 \times 2^2} = \frac{\sqrt{2 - \sqrt{3}}}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\cos\frac{\pi}{3 \times 2^3} = \frac{\sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{3}}}}{2}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sin\frac{\pi}{3 \times 2^3} = \frac{\sqrt{2 - \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{3}}}}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\cos\frac{\pi}{5 \times 2^0} = \frac{\sqrt{5}+1}{4}&lt;/math&gt; ( Therefore &lt;math&gt;2 + 2\cos\frac{\pi}{5} = 2 + \sqrt{1.25} + 0.5&lt;/math&gt; )

and so on.

===Radical form, sin and cos of {{sfrac|{{pi}}|(5 &amp;times; 3 &amp;times; 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;)}}===
:&lt;math&gt;\cos\frac{\pi}{15 \times 2^1} = \frac{\sqrt{\sqrt{\sqrt{0.703125}+1.875} + \sqrt{0.3125} + 1.75}}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\cos\frac{\pi}{15 \times 2^2} = \frac{\sqrt{2 + \sqrt{\sqrt{\sqrt{0.703125}+1.875} + \sqrt{0.3125} + 1.75}}}{2}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sin\frac{\pi}{15 \times 2^2} = \frac{\sqrt{2 - \sqrt{\sqrt{\sqrt{0.703125}+1.875} + \sqrt{0.3125} + 1.75}}}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

===Radical form, sin and cos of {{sfrac|{{pi}}|(17 &amp;times; 2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;)}}===
If &lt;math&gt;M = 2(17+\sqrt{17})&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;N = 2(17-\sqrt{17})&lt;/math&gt; then
:&lt;math&gt;\cos\frac{\pi}{17} = \frac{\sqrt{M-4+2(\sqrt{N}+\sqrt{2(2M-N+\sqrt{17N}-\sqrt{N}-8\sqrt{M})})}}{8}.&lt;/math&gt;
Therefore, applying induction:
:&lt;math&gt;\cos\frac{\pi}{17 \times 2^0} = \frac{\sqrt{30+2\sqrt{17}+\sqrt{136-8\sqrt{17}} + \sqrt{272+48\sqrt{17}+8\sqrt{34-2\sqrt{17}} \times (\sqrt{17}-1)-64\sqrt{34+2\sqrt{17}}}}}{8};&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\cos\frac{\pi}{17 \times 2^{n+1}} = \frac{\sqrt{2 + 2\cos\frac{\pi}{17 \times 2^n}}}{2}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sin\frac{\pi}{17 \times 2^{n+1}} = \frac{\sqrt{2 - 2\cos\frac{\pi}{17 \times 2^n}}}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

The induction above can be applied in the same way to all the remaining [[Fermat prime]]s (F&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;=2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;+1=2&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;+1='''257''' and F&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;=2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;+1=2&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;+1='''65537'''), the factors of {{pi}} whose cos and sin radical expressions are known to exist but are very long to express here.

D = 2&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt; - 1 = 4,294,967,295 is the largest '''odd''' integer denominator for which radical forms for sin({{pi}}/D) and cos ({{pi}}/D) are known to exist.

Using the radical form values from the sections above, and applying cos(A-B) = cosA cosB + sinA sinB, followed by induction, we get -

:&lt;math&gt;\cos\frac{\pi}{255 \times 2^0} = \frac{\sqrt{2 + 2\cos(\frac{\pi}{15}-\frac{\pi}{17})}}{2}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sin\frac{\pi}{255 \times 2^0} = \frac{\sqrt{2 - 2\cos(\frac{\pi}{15}-\frac{\pi}{17})}}{2};&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\cos\frac{\pi}{255 \times 2^{n+1}} = \frac{\sqrt{2 + 2\cos\frac{\pi}{255 \times 2^n}}}{2}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sin\frac{\pi}{255 \times 2^{n+1}} = \frac{\sqrt{2 - 2\cos\frac{\pi}{255 \times 2^n}}}{2};&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, using the radical form values from the sections above, and applying cos(A-B) = cosA cosB + sinA sinB, followed by induction, we get -

:&lt;math&gt;\cos\frac{\pi}{65535 \times 2^0} = \frac{\sqrt{2 + 2\cos(\frac{\pi}{255}-\frac{\pi}{257})}}{2}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sin\frac{\pi}{65535 \times 2^0} = \frac{\sqrt{2 - 2\cos(\frac{\pi}{255}-\frac{\pi}{257})}}{2};&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\cos\frac{\pi}{65535 \times 2^{n+1}} = \frac{\sqrt{2 + 2\cos\frac{\pi}{65535 \times 2^n}}}{2}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sin\frac{\pi}{65535 \times 2^{n+1}} = \frac{\sqrt{2 - 2\cos\frac{\pi}{65535 \times 2^n}}}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

Finally, using the radical form values from the sections above, and applying cos(A-B) = cosA cosB + sinA sinB, followed by induction, we get -

:&lt;math&gt;\cos\frac{\pi}{4294967295 \times 2^0} = \frac{\sqrt{2 + 2\cos(\frac{\pi}{65535}-\frac{\pi}{65537})}}{2}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sin\frac{\pi}{4294967295 \times 2^0} = \frac{\sqrt{2 - 2\cos(\frac{\pi}{65535}-\frac{\pi}{65537})}}{2};&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\cos\frac{\pi}{4294967295 \times 2^{n+1}} = \frac{\sqrt{2 + 2\cos\frac{\pi}{4294967295 \times 2^n}}}{2}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sin\frac{\pi}{4294967295 \times 2^{n+1}} = \frac{\sqrt{2 - 2\cos\frac{\pi}{4294967295 \times 2^n}}}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

The radical form expansion of the above is very large, hence expressed in the simpler form above.

===''n'' &amp;times; {{sfrac|{{pi}}|(5 &amp;times; 2&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;)}}===
[[File:Ptolemy Pentagon.svg|right|thumb|Chord(36°) = {{sfrac|''a''|''b''}} = {{sfrac|1|''φ''}}, i.e., the reciprocal of the [[golden ratio]], from [[Ptolemy's theorem]]]]

====Geometrical method====
Applying [[Ptolemy's theorem]] to the [[cyclic quadrilateral]] ABCD defined by four successive vertices of the pentagon, we can find that:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{crd} 36^\circ = \operatorname{crd} (\angle\mathrm{ADB}) = \frac{a}{b} =\frac{2}{1+\sqrt{5}}=\frac{\sqrt{5}-1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

which is the reciprocal {{sfrac|1|''φ''}} of the [[golden ratio]]. '''crd''' is the [[chord (geometry)#Chords in trigonometry|chord]] function,
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{crd}\ {\theta}=2\sin\frac{\theta}{2}.\,&lt;/math&gt;

(See also [[Ptolemy's table of chords]].)

Thus
:&lt;math&gt;\sin 18^\circ=\frac{1}{1+\sqrt{5}}=\frac{\sqrt{5}-1}{4}.&lt;/math&gt;

(Alternatively, without using Ptolemy's theorem, label as X the intersection of AC and BD, and note by considering angles that triangle AXB is [[isosceles]], so AX&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;AB&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''a''. Triangles AXD and CXB are [[similar triangles|similar]], because AD is parallel to BC. So XC&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''a''·({{sfrac|''a''|''b''}}). But AX&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;XC&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;AC, so ''a''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;|''b''}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''b''. Solving this gives {{sfrac|''a''|''b''}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|1|''φ''}}, as above).

Similarly
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{crd}\ 108^\circ=\operatorname{crd}(\angle\mathrm{ABC})=\frac{b}{a}=\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2},&lt;/math&gt;

so
:&lt;math&gt;\sin 54^\circ=\cos 36^\circ=\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{4}.&lt;/math&gt;

====Algebraic method====
If θ is 18° or -54°, then 2θ and 3θ add up to 5θ = 90° or -270°, therefore sin 2θ is equal to cos 3θ.
:&lt;math&gt;(2\sin\theta)\cos\theta = \sin2\theta = \cos3\theta = 4\cos^3\theta-3\cos\theta = (4\cos^2\theta-3)\cos\theta = (1-4\sin^2\theta)\cos\theta&lt;/math&gt;
:So, &lt;math&gt;4\sin^2\theta+2\sin\theta-1=0&lt;/math&gt;, which implies &lt;math&gt;\sin\theta = \sin(18^\circ , -54^\circ) = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{5}}{4}.&lt;/math&gt;
Therefore,
:&lt;math&gt;\sin(18^\circ) = \cos(72^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{5}-1}{4}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sin(54^\circ) = \cos(36^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{5}+1}{4}&lt;/math&gt; and
:&lt;math&gt;\sin(36^\circ) = \cos(54^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{10-2\sqrt{5}}}{4}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sin(72^\circ) = \cos(18^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{10+2\sqrt{5}}}{4}.&lt;/math&gt;

Alternately, the multiple-angle formulas for functions of 5''x'', where ''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;{18, 36, 54, 72, 90} and 5''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;{90, 180, 270, 360, 450}, can be solved for the functions of ''x'', since we know the function values of 5''x''. The multiple-angle formulas are:
:&lt;math&gt;\sin5x=16\sin^5 x-20\sin^3 x+5\sin x,\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\cos5x=16\cos^5 x-20\cos^3 x+5\cos x.\,&lt;/math&gt;
*When sin&amp;nbsp;5''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 or cos&amp;nbsp;5''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, we let ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;sin&amp;nbsp;''x'' or ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;cos&amp;nbsp;x and solve for ''y'':
::&lt;math&gt;16y^5-20y^3+5y=0.\,&lt;/math&gt;
:One solution is zero, and the resulting [[quartic function|quartic equation]] can be solved as a quadratic in ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.
*When sin&amp;nbsp;5''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 or cos&amp;nbsp;5''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, we again let ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;sin&amp;nbsp;''x'' or ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;cos&amp;nbsp;x and solve for ''y'':
::&lt;math&gt;16y^5-20y^3+5y-1=0,\,&lt;/math&gt;
:which factors into:
::&lt;math&gt;(y-1)\left(4y^2+2y-1\right)^2=0.\,&lt;/math&gt;

===''n'' &amp;times; {{sfrac|{{pi}}|20}}===
:9° is 45&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;36, and 27° is 45&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;18; so we use the subtraction formulas for sine and cosine.

===''n'' &amp;times; {{sfrac|{{pi}}|30}}===
:6° is 36&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;30, 12° is 30&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;18, 24° is 54&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;30, and 42° is 60&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;18; so we use the subtraction formulas for sine and cosine.

===''n'' &amp;times; {{sfrac|{{pi}}|60}}===
:3° is 18&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;15, 21° is 36&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;15, 33° is 18&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;15, and 39° is 54&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;15, so we use the subtraction (or addition) formulas for sine and cosine.

==Strategies for simplifying expressions==

===Rationalizing the denominator===
:If the denominator is a square root, multiply the numerator and denominator by that radical.
:If the denominator is the sum or difference of two terms, multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. The conjugate is the identical, except the sign between the terms is changed.
:Sometimes you need to rationalize the denominator more than once.

===Splitting a fraction in two===
:Sometimes it helps to split the fraction into the sum of two fractions and then simplify both separately.

===Squaring and taking square roots===
:If there is a complicated term, with only one kind of radical in a term, this plan may help. Square the term, combine like terms, and take the square root. This may leave a big radical with a smaller radical inside, but it is often better than the original.

===Simplifying nested radical expressions===
{{Main|Nested radical}}
In general nested radicals cannot be reduced. But if
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{a \pm b\sqrt c}\,&lt;/math&gt;
with ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' rational, we have
:&lt;math&gt;R=\sqrt{a^2-b^2c}\,&lt;/math&gt;
is rational, then both
:&lt;math&gt;d=\frac{a + R}{2}\text{ and }e=\frac{a - R}{2}\,&lt;/math&gt;
are rational; then we have
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{a\pm b\sqrt c}=\sqrt{d}\pm\sqrt{e}. \,&lt;/math&gt;
For example,
:&lt;math&gt;4\sin18^\circ=\sqrt{6-2\sqrt5}=\sqrt5-1. \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;4\sin15^\circ=2\sqrt{2-\sqrt{3}}=\sqrt{2}\left(\sqrt{3}-1\right).&lt;/math&gt;

{{refimprove|date=August 2014}}

An '''X mark''' (also known as a '''cross''', '''x''', '''ex''' , X, ✕, ☓, ✖, ✗, ✘, etc.) used to indicate the concept of negation (for example "no, this has not been verified" or "no, I don't agree") as well as an indicator (for example in election [[Ballot|ballot papers]] or in [[x marks the spot (disambiguation)|x marks the spot]]). Its opposite is often considered to be the [[check mark]] or tick (or the [[marujirushi|O mark]] used in [[Japan]], [[Korea]] and [[Taiwan]]). In Japanese, the X mark (❌) is called "batsu" (ばつ) and can be expressed by someone by crossing their arms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://genkienglish.net/marubatsu.htm|title=What is Maru Batsu?|website=genkienglish.net|access-date=2016-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{SpecialChars}}
In some countries such as France it is common for people to check a square box with a cross rather than a [[check mark]], while in others the check mark (✓) or even a [[v]] mark{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} is used.

It is also used as a replacement for a [[signature]] for a person who is blind or [[illiterate]] and thus cannot write his or her name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.notarypublicstamps.com/blog/2013/12/notarizing-blind-illiterate-individuals/ | title=Notarizing for Blind and Illiterate Individuals | publisher=American Association of Notaries | date=December 2, 2013 | accessdate=5 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Typically, the writing of an X used for this purpose must be witnessed to be valid.

As a verb, to '''ex '''(or '''x''', notably one of the shortest English words)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of X at Merriam-Webster|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/x|work=[[Merriam-Webster]] |publisher=Merriam-Webster, Inc.|accessdate=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''off'''/'''out''' or to '''cross off'''/'''out''' means to add such a mark. It is quite common, especially on printed forms and document, for there to be squares in which to place x marks, or interchangeably checks.

It is also traditionally used on maps to indicate locations, most famously on [[treasure map]]s.

[[Unicode]] provides various related symbols, including:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Symbol || Unicode Code point (hex) || Name
|-
| &lt;big&gt;☐&lt;/big&gt; || U+2610 || [[ballot box|BALLOT BOX]] ([[checkbox]])
