==General==
[[Fruit picking]] robots, [[driverless tractor]] / sprayers, and [[sheep shearing]] robots are designed to replace [[labor (economics)|human labor]]. 
In most cases, a lot of factors have to be considered (e.g., the size and color of the fruit to be picked) before the commencement of a task. 
Robots can be used for other [[horticultural]] tasks such as [[pruning]], [[weeding]], [[Pesticide application#Spray application|spraying]] and monitoring. 
Robots can also be used in [[livestock]] applications (livestock robotics) such as [[automatic milking]], washing and castrating. Robots like these have many benefits for the agricultural industry, including a higher quality of fresh produce, lower production costs, and a decreased need for manual labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-38089984|title=In the future, will farming be fully automated?|last=Belton|first=Padraig|date=2016-11-25|newspaper=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can also be used to automate manual tasks, such as weed or bracken spraying, where the use of [[tractor]]s and other manned vehicles is too dangerous for the operators.

==Designs==
[[File:Amazone BoniRob Feldroboter-Entwicklungsprojekt.jpg|thumbnail|Fieldwork Robot]]
The [[Mechanical engineering|mechanical design]] consists of an end effector, manipulator, and gripper. Several factors must be considered in the design of the [[manipulator (device)|manipulator]], including the task, [[economic efficiency]], and required motions. The [[end effector]] influences the market value of the fruit and the [[Robot end effector|gripper's]] design is based on the [[crop (agriculture)|crop]] that is being harvested.

===End effectors===
An [[end effector]] in an agricultural robot is the device found at the end of the [[robotic arm]], used for various agricultural operations. Several different kinds of end effectors have been developed. In an agricultural operation involving [[grape]]s in [[Japan]], end effectors are used for harvesting, berry-thinning, spraying, and bagging. Each was designed according to the nature of the task and the shape and size of the target fruit. For instance, the end effectors used for harvesting were designed to grasp, cut, and push the bunches of grapes.

[[Thinning|Berry thinning]] is another operation performed on the grapes, and is used to enhance the [[market value]] of the grapes, increase the grapes' size, and facilitate the bunching process. For berry thinning, an end effector consists of an upper, middle, and lower part. The upper part has two plates and a rubber that can open and close. The two plates compress the grapes to cut off the [[rachis]] branches and extract the bunch of grapes. The middle part contains a plate of needles, a compression spring, and another plate which has holes spread across its surface. When the two plates compress, the needles punch holes through the grapes. Next, the lower part has a cutting device which can cut the bunch to standardize its length.

For spraying, the end effector consists of a spray nozzle that is attached to a manipulator. In practice, producers want to ensure that the chemical liquid is evenly distributed across the bunch. Thus, the design allows for an even distribution of the chemical by making the nozzle to move at a constant speed while keeping distance from the target.

The final step in grape production is the bagging process. The bagging end effector is designed with a bag feeder and two mechanical fingers. In the bagging process, the bag feeder is composed of slits which continuously supply bags to the fingers in an up and down motion. While the bag is being fed to the fingers, two leaf springs that are located on the upper end of the bag hold the bag open. The bags are produced to contain the grapes in bunches. Once the bagging process is complete, the fingers open and release the bag. This shuts the leaf springs, which seals the bag and prevents it from opening again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=525635&amp;tag=1|title=Agricultural Robot in Grape Production System|last2=Kondo|first2=N.|date=|website=Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Xplore Digital Library|publisher=|last3=Shibano|first3=Y.|last1=Monta|first1=M.|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gripper===
The [[Robot end effector|gripper]] is a grasping device that is used for harvesting the target crop. Design of the gripper is based on simplicity, low cost, and effectiveness. Thus, the design usually consists of two mechanical fingers that are able to move in [[Synchronization|synchrony]] when performing their task. Specifics of the design depend on the task that is being performed. For example, in a procedure that required plants to be cut for harvesting, the gripper was equipped with a sharp blade.

===Manipulator===
The [[manipulator (device)|manipulator]] allows the [[Robot end effector|gripper]] and end effector to navigate through their environment. The manipulator consists of four-bar parallel links that maintain the gripper's position and height. The manipulator also can utilize one, two, or three [[pneumatic actuator]]s. [[Pneumatic]] [[actuator]]s are [[Pneumatic motor|motors]] which produce [[linear]] and [[Rotary motion|rotary]] motion by converting [[compressed air]] into [[energy]]. The pneumatic actuator is the most effective actuator for agricultural robots because of its high power-weight ratio. The most cost efficient design for the manipulator is the single actuator configuration, yet this is the least flexible option.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vagostudio.com/giulio/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/JFR06.pdf|title=Agricultural Robot for Radicchio Harvesting|last2=Reina|first2=Giulio|date=|website=Journal of Field Robotics|publisher=Wiley InterScience|doi=10.1002/rob|last1=Foglia|first1=Mario|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
The first development of robotics in agriculture can be dated as early as the 1920s, with research to incorporate automatic vehicle guidance into agriculture beginning to take shape.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yaghoubi|first=Sajjad|date=June 2013|title=Autonomous Robots for Agricultural Tasks and Farm Assignment and Future Trends in Agro Robots|url=|journal=InternationalJournalofMechanical&amp;MechatronicsEngineering|volume=13|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This research led to the advancements between the 1950s and 60s of autonomous agricultural vehicles.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The concept was not perfect however, with the vehicles still needing a cable system to guide their path.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Robots in agriculture continued to develop as technologies in other sectors began to develop as well. It was not until the 1980s, following the development of the computer, that [[machine vision]] guidance became possible.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Other developments over the years included the harvesting of oranges using a robot both in France and the US.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harrell|first=Roy|date=March–April 1987|title=Economic Analysis of Robotic Citrus Harvesting in Florida|url=|journal=American Society of Agricultural Engineers|volume=30 |issue=2|pages=298–304|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While robots have been incorporated in indoor industrial settings for decades, outdoor robots for the use of agriculture are considered more complex and difficult to develop.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.intechopen.com/books/service_robot_applications/agricultural_robots_-_applications_and_economic_perspectives|title=Service Robot Applications|last=S.|first=Pedersen|last2=S.|first2=Fountas|last3=S.|first3=Blackmore|date=2008-08-01|publisher=InTech|isbn=9789537619008|language=en|doi=10.5772/6048}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to concerns over safety, but also over the complexity of picking crops subject to different environmental factors and unpredictability.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/node/15048711|title=Fields of automation|website=The Economist|language=en|access-date=2018-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Demand in the Market ===
There are concerns over the amount of labor the agricultural sector needs. With an aging population, Japan is unable to meet the demands of the agricultural labor market.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Similarly, the United State currently depends on a large number of immigrant workers, but between the decrease in seasonal farmworkers and increased efforts to stop immigration by the government, they too are unable to meet the demand.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/08/wave-of-agriculture-robotics-holds-potential-to-ease-farm-labor-crunch.html|title=From strawberries to apples, a wave of agriculture robotics may ease the farm labor crunch|last=Daniels|first=Jeff|date=2018-03-08|work=CNBC|access-date=2018-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Businesses are often forced to let crops rot due to an inability to pick them all by the end of the season.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Additionally, there are concerns over the growing population that will need to be fed over the next years.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2017/05/robots-agriculture/|title=Robots Wielding Water Knives Are the Future of Farming|work=WIRED|access-date=2018-05-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, there is a large desire to improve agricultural machinery to make it more cost efficient and viable for continued use.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Current Applications and Trends ===
Much of the current research continues to work towards autonomous agricultural vehicles. This research is based on the advancements made in driver-assist systems and [[Autonomous car|self-driving cars]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

While robots have already been incorporated in many areas of agricultural farm work, they are still largely missing in the harvest of various crops. This has started to change as companies begin to develop robots that complete more specific tasks on the farm. The biggest concern over robots harvesting crops comes from harvesting soft crops such as strawberries which can easily be damaged or missed entirely.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Despite these concerns, progress in this area is being made. According to Gary Wishnatzki, the co-founder of Harvest Croo Robotics, one of their strawberry pickers currently being tested in Florida can "pick a 25-acre field in just three days and replace a crew of about 30 farm workers".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Similar progress is being made in harvesting apples, grapes, and other crops.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Another goal being set by agricultural companies involves the collection of data.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; There are rising concerns over the growing population and the decreasing labor available to feed them.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Data collection is being developed as a way to increase productivity on farms.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; AgriData is currently developing new technology to do just this and help farmers better determine the best time to harvest their crops by scanning fruit trees.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

==Applications==
Robots have many fields of application in agriculture. Some examples and prototypes of robots include the Merlin Robot Milker, Rosphere, [[Harvest Automation]], Orange Harvester, lettuce bot,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jan/09/robots-farm-future|title=Robot farmers are the future of agriculture, says government|date=|website=|publisher=The Guardian|last1=Harvey|first1=Fiona|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and weeder. One case of a large scale use of robots in farming is the milk bot. It is widespread among British dairy farms because of its efficiency and nonrequirement to move. According to David Gardner (chief executive of the Royal Agricultural Society of England), a robot can complete a complicated task if its repetitive and the robot is allowed to sit in a single place. Furthermore, robots that work on repetitive tasks (e.g. milking) fulfill their role to a consistent and particular standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2013/09/23/robot-farming-4055079/|title=Agriculture shock: How robot farmers will take over our fields|date=23 September 2013|website=|publisher=Metro|last1=Jenkins|first1=David|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another field of application is [[horticulture]]. One horticultural application is the development of RV100 by [[Harvest Automation|Harvest Automation Inc.]] RV 100 is designed to transport potted plants in a [[greenhouse]] or outdoor setting. The functions of RV100 in handling and organizing potted plants include spacing capabilities, collection, and consolidation. The benefits of using RV100 for this task include high placement accuracy, [[autonomous]] outdoor and indoor function, and reduced [[Cost-of-production theory of value|production costs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.harvestai.com|title=Products|last=|first=|date=2016|website=|publisher=Harvest Automation|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States]] military's '''Air Force Satellite Communications''' ('''AFSATCOM''') is a network of ground and space systems to allow rapid dissemination of communications to a worldwide audience.  AFSATCOM's creation was during the height of the [[Cold War]] to guarantee that [[Emergency Action Messages]] would be received by [[Strategic Air Command]] nuclear forces.

==Operations==
AFSATCOM operations used leased transponders off [[United States Navy]] [[Fleet Satellite Communications]] (FLTSATCOM) satellites for [[Emergency Action Message|EAM]] transmission.

'''Alert correlation''' is a type of [[long analysis]]. It focuses on the process of clustering alerts (events), generated by [[Network intrusion detection system|NIDS]] and [[Host-based intrusion detection system|HIDS]] computer systems, to form higher-level pieces of information.

Example of simple alert correlation is grouping invalid login attempts to report single incident like "10000 invalid login attempts on host X".

==Operation==
The anti-griddle maintains a constant temperature of -30°F (c. -34.4°C) by pumping a [[refrigerant]] through a compressor to remove heat from its [[steel]] surface.&lt;ref&gt;"Kitchen-Counter: The future of food." Popular Science. 2007: 62.

The            finished product has a crunchy outer texture while the inside remains soft or creamy.

The '''Atomic Energy Act of 1954''', 42 U.S.C. §§ 2011-2021, 2022-2286i, 2296a-2297h-13, is a [[United States federal law]] that is, according to the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]], "the fundamental U.S. law on both the [[civilian]] and the [[military]] uses of [[nuclear material]]s."&lt;ref name=NRCsumm&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/governing-laws.html#aea-1954 |title=NRC: Our Governing Legislation: Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as Amended in NUREG-0980 |publisher=U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission |accessdate=April 7, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; It covers the laws for the development, regulation, and disposal of nuclear materials and facilities in the United States.

It was an amendment to the [[Atomic Energy Act of 1946]] and substantially refined certain aspects of the law, including increased support for the possibility of a civilian nuclear industry. Notably it made it possible for the government to allow private companies to gain technical information ([[Restricted Data]]) about nuclear energy production and the production of fissile materials, allowing for greater exchange of information with foreign nations as part of President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]'s [[Atoms for Peace]] program, and reversed certain provisions in the 1946 law which had made it impossible to patent processes for generating nuclear energy or fissile materials.

The H.R. 9757 legislation was passed by the 83rd U.S. Congressional session and signed into law by President [[Presidency of Dwight D. Eisenhower|Dwight Eisenhower]] on August 30, 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=10012 |title=Dwight D.

[[Image:Multiplexed_Analogue_Components_transmission_(simulation).jpg|thumb|300px|Simulated MAC signal. From left to right: digital data, chrominance and luminance]]

'''B-MAC''' is a form of analog video encoding, specifically a type of ([[Multiplexed Analogue Components]] (MAC) encoding.  MAC encoding was designed in the mid 80s for use with Direct Broadcast Satellite systems.  Other analog video encoding systems include [[NTSC]], [[PAL]] and [[SECAM]].  Unlike the [[Frequency-division multiplexing|FDM]] method used in those, MAC encoding uses a [[Time-division multiplexing|TDM]] method.  B-MAC was a proprietary MAC encoding used by [[Scientific-Atlanta]] for encrypting broadcast video services; the full name was "Multiple Analogue Component, Type B".

B-MAC uses teletext-style non-return-to-zero (NRZ) signaling with a capacity of 1.625 Mbit/s. The video and audio/data signals are therefore combined at baseband.
* Both PAL (626/50) and NTSC (525/60) versions of B-MAC were developed and used.

User base (PAL/NTSC zones)
* This system was used in Australia for [[TVRO]] until 2000.
* B-MAC was used for satellite broadcasts of the [[American Forces Radio and Television Service]] from the early 1980s until 1996-1997 when the analogue standard was replaced by the digital [[PowerVu]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Scientific-Atlanta's PowerVu Technology Helping AFRTS Expand the Delivery of A Touch of Home to Military Abroad |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/scientific-atlantas-powervu-technology-helping-afrts-expand-the-delivery-of-a-touch-of-home-to-military-abroad-76982662.html |location=[[Atlanta, GA]] |publisher=[[Scientific Atlanta]] |agency=[[PR Newswire]]  |accessdate=2014-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* B-MAC has not been used for DTH applications since [[Primestar]] switched to an all-digital delivery system in the mid-1990s.

== Technical details ==
MAC transmits luminance and chrominance data separately in time rather than separately in frequency (as other analog television formats do, such as composite video).

Audio and Scrambling (selective access)
* Audio, in a format similar to [[NICAM]] was transmitted digitally rather than as an FM subcarrier.
* The MAC standard included a standard scrambling system, EuroCrypt, a precursor to the standard DVB-CSA encryption system.

'''BBC Research &amp; Development''' is the national technical research department of the [[BBC]].

==Function==
It has responsibility for researching and developing advanced and emerging media technologies for the benefit of the corporation, and wider UK and European media industries, and is also the technical design authority for a number of major technical infrastructure transformation projects for the UK broadcasting industry.

==Structure==
BBC R&amp;D is part of the wider [[BBC Design &amp; Engineering]], and is led by Andy Conroy, Controller Research &amp; Development.&lt;ref name="andyconroy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/blog/2015/09/introduction-to-the-controller|title=Introduction to the Controller|work=BBC R&amp;D Blog|date=9 September 2015|accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the North Lab moved into [[MediaCityUK]] in [[City of Salford|Salford]]  along with several other departments of the BBC, whilst the South Lab remained in [[BBC White City|White City]] in London.

==History==
[[Image:Rainbow over Kingswood Warren - geograph.org.uk - 137535.jpg|thumb|Former site at [[Kingswood Warren]]]]
The department as it stands today was formed in 1993 from the merger of the BBC Designs Department and the BBC Research Department. From 2006 to 2008 it was known as '''Research and Innovation'''  but has since reverted to its original name. '''BBC Research &amp; Development''' has made major contributions to broadcast technology, carrying out original research in many areas, and developing items like the [[peak programme meter]] (PPM) which became the basis for many world standards.

===Innovations===
It has also been involved in many well known consumer technologies such as [[teletext]], [[Digital Audio Broadcasting|DAB]], [[NICAM]] and [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]]. It was at the forefront of development of [[FM broadcasting|FM radio]], stereo FM, and [[Radio Data System|RDS]]. These innovations have led to [[Queen's Awards for Enterprise|Queen's Awards for Innovation]] in 1969, 1974, 1983, 1987, 1992, 1998, 2001 and 2011.

In the 1970s, its engineers designed the famous [[LS3/5A]] studio monitor for use in [[outside broadcasting]] units.&lt;ref name=hfa1979bbchomeservice&gt;Prakel, David (August 1979). [http://www.g4dcv.co.uk/ls35a/pics/BBC%27s_home_service.pdf "BBC's Home Service"], ''Hi-Fi Answers'', pp67&amp;ndash;9 (Courtesy link)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H.D. Harwood, BSc, M.E.

[http://www.theabsolutesound.com/articles/stirling-broadcast-ls35a-v2-loudspeaker/ "Stirling Broadcast LS3/5a V2 Loudspeaker"]. ''The Absolute Sound''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Closure of Kingswood Warren and move to London and Salford===
In early 2010 the department had approximately 135 staff based at three locations:  White City in London, Kingswood Warren in [[Kingswood, Surrey]], and the R&amp;D (North Lab) at the BBC's Manchester offices at New Broadcasting House, Oxford Road, [[Manchester]]. In early 2010 the Kingswood Warren site was vacated and the bulk of the department relocated to Centre House, in [[White City, London]] co-locating with the main campus of the BBC in London, whilst a significant number have moved to the new North Lab in [[MediaCityUK]] in [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]].

==Future projects==
BBC R&amp;D engineers and researchers are currently active on approximately 50 projects, including 7 active national and international collaborative research efforts.

These include R&amp;D projects built around [[BBC Redux]]&lt;ref name="notube"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://labs.notu.be/1/bbc/about.html|title=NoTube Archive Browser Experiment 1|work=NoTube Archive Browser|date=19 December 2011|accessdate=13 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110306190402/http://labs.notu.be/1/bbc/about.html|archive-date=6 March 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="james-archak"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://custard-cat.blogspot.co.uk/2009/11/archak-bbc-research-and-development.html|title=ArcHak|work=CustardCat|first=Bruce|last=James|date=5 November 2009|accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="browser-extensions"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/researchanddevelopment/2010/08/-prototyping-weeknotes-29-2708.shtml|title=Prototyping Weeknotes #29|date=27 August 2010|accessdate=13 May 2012|work=BBC Research &amp; Development Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dtg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dtg.org.uk/news/news.php?id=4296|title=BBC R&amp;D develops 'mood based navigation'|work=News|publisher=[[Digital TV Group]]|author=DTG staff|date=18 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="campbell"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/researchanddevelopment/2012/01/an-interface-for-mood-based-navigation.shtml|title=An Affective Interface for Mood-Based Navigation|first=Rosie|last=Campbell|date=16 January 2012|accessdate=13 May 2012|work=BBC Research &amp; Development Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="redux-mood-testing"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/projects/2009/10/mulitmedia_classification.shtml|work=Projects|title=Multimedia Classification|author=BBC Research and Development|accessdate=13 May 2012|quote=User Evaluation on BBC Redux (by BBC staff) …}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="annual-2009-2010"&gt;{{cite report|url=http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/rd/pubs/annual-review/bbc_rd_annual_review_2009-2010.pdf|title=Highlights of the Year|work=BBC R&amp;D Annual Review 2009–2010|date=10 March 2011|accessdate=13 May 2012|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|title=Highlights of the Year|work=BBC R&amp;D Annual Report 2010–2011|url=http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/rd/pubs/annual-review/bbc_rd_annual_review_2010-2011.pdf|page=5|date=15 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;—the [[proof of concept]] for the cross-platform, [[Flash video]]-based streaming version of the [[BBC iPlayer]].&lt;ref name="bird"&gt;{{cite paper|url=http://www.uknof.org.uk/uknof13/Bird-Redux.pdf|first=Tom|last=Bird|date=28 May 2009|title=BBC Redux|publisher=[[UKNOF]] 13|location=Sheffield|pages=2–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|15}}

'''Bristol Temple Quarter Enterprise Zone''' is an [[enterprise zone]] in [[Bristol]], England, focused on creative, high-tech and low-carbon industries. Covering an area of {{convert|70|ha}}, it is based around [[Bristol Temple Meads railway station]], which is being redeveloped by [[Network Rail]]. It also contains the area around the existing [[Temple Quay]] development, and the Silverthorne Lane and Avon Riverside areas. It includes the site of the planned [[Bristol Arena]],&lt;ref name=BP1&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/enterprising-idea-radically-new-approach/story-19489241-detail/story.html |title=An enterprising idea with a radically new approach |newspaper=[[Bristol Post]] |date=8 July 2013 |accessdate=18 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402095845/http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/enterprising-idea-radically-new-approach/story-19489241-detail/story.html |archivedate=2 April 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the site of the [[University of Bristol]]'s planned Temple Quarter Campus.

==Establishment==
The creation of the zone was announced by Chancellor [[George Osborne]] in the Budget of March 2011,&lt;ref name=BP2&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/Bristol-enterprise-zone-looks-momentum/story-20963315-detail/story.html |title=Bristol enterprise zone looks to keep up the momentum |newspaper=Bristol Post |date=16 April 2014 |accessdate=18 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402100649/http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/Bristol-enterprise-zone-looks-momentum/story-20963315-detail/story.html |archivedate=2 April 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was launched in 2012.&lt;ref name=BP1/&gt; The zone offers streamlined [[planning permission|planning controls]] and reduced [[business rates in England and Wales|business rates]]. Rates generated by the zone are channelled to five other areas in the region,&lt;ref name=BBC2&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-13681651 |title=Land near Temple Meads named as Bristol enterprise zone |work=[[BBC News Online]] |date=7 June 2011 |accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; designated Enterprise Areas. These are [[Avonmouth]] (focusing on manufacturing and distribution), [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] (media and publishing), [[Emersons Green]] including [[Bristol and Bath Science Park]], [[Filton]] (high-tech) and [[Weston-super-Mare]] (business services). Development of the enterprise zone is coordinated by West of England Local Enterprise Partnership, [[Bristol City Council]], the [[Homes and Communities Agency]] (HCA) and Network Rail.&lt;ref name=BP1/&gt;

==Station and surrounds==
Network Rail is redeveloping the station,&lt;ref name=BP1/&gt; in conjunction with its [[21st-century modernisation of the Great Western Main Line|electrification of the Great Western line]] which will cut the journey time from Temple Meads to [[London Paddington station]] to 80 minutes.&lt;ref name=BP2/&gt; Station Approach Road will be turned into a public square and the station's main entrance moved to the north side of the station.&lt;ref name=BBC6&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-20328428 |title=Bristol Temple Meads station to get £100m investment |work=BBC News Online |date=14 November 2012 |accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2015, the council announced changes to the layout of the roads around the station, with the removal of Temple Circus roundabout and provision of better routes for pedestrians and cyclists.&lt;ref name=BBC5&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-30775854 |title=Bristol's Temple Gate layout change planned in £21m revamp |work=BBC News Online |date=12 January 2015 |accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Across Station Approach from the station,&lt;ref name=BP2/&gt; the Temple Gate redevelopment by TCN UK is a creative and digital campus for [[small and medium-sized enterprises]]. Redeveloped buildings include Bristol and Exeter House and Temple Studios. The latter opened in 2013.&lt;ref name=BP1/&gt; 

[[File:2014 at Bristol Temple Meads Engine Shed - lounge area.JPG|thumb|Engine Shed's lounge area]]
Engine Shed is a new use for part of the Old Station, [[Brunel]]'s original building, in partnership with the [[University of Bristol]].&lt;ref name=BP1/&gt; Opened in December 2013,&lt;ref name=Thompson1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.southwestbusiness.co.uk/sectors/construction-and-commercial-property/09072015134027-how-to-build-engine-shed-2-as-a-home-for-high-tech-high-growth-businesses-in-bristol-in-the-face-of-risk-averse-property-investors/ |title=How to build Engine Shed 2 as a home for high-tech high-growth businesses in Bristol in the face of risk averse property investors |last=Thompson |first=Gavin |work=SouthWestBusiness |date=9 July 2015 |accessdate=11 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it hosts [[business incubators]], including [[SETsquared]] and WebStart Bristol, which support a cluster of hi-tech [[startup companies]].&lt;ref name=G1&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2014/feb/10/bristol-tech-industries |title=Why tech industries are thriving in the south-west of England |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=10 February 2014 |accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Engine Shed leases its office space to the incubators, who in turn sub-let space on more flexible terms to the companies, which are selected for their high growth potential, and high expected benefits for the regional economy.&lt;ref name=Thompson1/&gt; In December 2015, with the building fully occupied, additional space was made available in the form of Boxworks, which was rapidly constructed by ForwardSpace next to Engine Shed using 20 [[intermodal container|shipping containers]].

==Temple Quarter Campus==
In November 2016, the University of Bristol announced that it will build a £300 million Temple Quarter Campus for c. 5,000 students, directly to the east of the station. It will replace an empty [[sorting office]] building, formerly operated by [[Royal Mail]] but derelict since 1997. The campus, which will include a new [[business school]], digital research facilities and a student village, is expected to open in 2021. It will also host Engine Shed 2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/bristol-university-to-take-over-royal-mail-sorting-offices-by-temple-meads-for-new-300m-campus/story-29935566-detail/story.html |newspaper=Bristol Post |title=Bristol University to take over old sorting office by Temple Meads for new £300m campus |last=Yong |first=Michael |date=29 November 2016 |accessdate=29 November 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''charge-coupled device''' ('''CCD''') is a device for the movement of [[electric charge|electrical charge]], usually from within the device  to an area where the charge can be manipulated, for example conversion into a digital value. This is achieved by "shifting" the signals between stages within the device one at a time. CCDs move charge between capacitive ''bins'' in the device, with the shift allowing for the transfer of charge between bins.

In recent years CCD has become a major technology for [[digital imaging]]. In a CCD [[image sensor]], [[pixel]]s are represented by [[Doping (semiconductor)|p-doped]] [[MOSFET#Metal–oxide–semiconductor structure|metal-oxide-semiconductors]] (MOS) capacitors. These capacitors are biased above the threshold for inversion when image acquisition begins, allowing the conversion of incoming [[photon]]s into electron charges at the semiconductor-oxide interface; the CCD is then used to read out these charges. Although CCDs are not the only technology to allow for light detection, CCD image sensors are widely used in professional, medical, and scientific applications where high-quality image data are required. In applications with less exacting quality demands, such as consumer and professional [[digital camera]]s, [[active pixel sensor]]s, also known as complementary metal-oxide-semiconductors ([[CMOS]]) are generally used; the large quality advantage CCDs enjoyed early on has narrowed over time.

==History==
[[File:Nobel Prize 2009-Press Conference KVA-19.jpg|thumb|240px|George E. Smith and Willard Boyle, 2009]]
The charge-coupled device was invented in 1969 in the United States at [[American Telephone &amp; Telegraph|AT&amp;T]] [[Bell Labs]] by [[Willard Boyle]] and [[George E. Smith]].&lt;ref name="patent"&gt;See {{US Patent|3792322}} and {{US Patent|3796927}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The lab was working on [[semiconductor]] [[bubble memory]] when Boyle and Smith conceived of the design of what they termed, in their notebook, "Charge 'Bubble' Devices".&lt;ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The device could be used as a [[shift register]]. The essence of the design was the ability to transfer charge along the surface of a semiconductor from one storage capacitor to the next. The concept was similar in principle to the [[bucket-brigade device]] (BBD), which was developed at [[Philips Research Labs]] during the late 1960s. The first patent ({{US Patent|4,085,456}}) on the application of CCDs to imaging was assigned to [[Michael F. Tompsett|Michael Tompsett]].&lt;ref&gt;{{US Patent|4,085,456}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first working CCD made with integrated circuit technology was a simple 8-bit shift register.&lt;ref&gt;

Development of the device progressed at a rapid rate. By 1971, Bell researchers led by Michael Tompsett were able to capture images with simple linear devices.&lt;ref&gt;

Several companies, including [[Fairchild Semiconductor]], [[RCA]] and [[Texas Instruments]], picked up on the invention and began development programs.

==Basics of operation==
[[File:CCD charge transfer animation.gif|thumb|250px|right|The charge packets (electrons, blue) are collected in ''potential wells'' (yellow) created by applying positive voltage at the gate electrodes (G). Applying positive voltage to the gate electrode in the correct sequence transfers the charge packets.]]

In a CCD for capturing images, there is a photoactive region (an [[epitaxy|epitaxial]] layer of silicon), and a transmission region made out of a [[shift register]] (the CCD, properly speaking).

An image is projected through a [[lens (optics)|lens]] onto the capacitor array (the photoactive region), causing each capacitor to accumulate an electric charge proportional to the [[light]] intensity at that location. A one-dimensional array, used in line-scan cameras, captures a single slice of the image, whereas a two-dimensional array, used in video and still cameras, captures a two-dimensional picture corresponding to the scene projected onto the focal plane of the sensor. Once the array has been exposed to the image, a control circuit causes each capacitor to transfer its contents to its neighbor (operating as a shift register). The last capacitor in the array dumps its charge into a [[charge amplifier]], which converts the charge into a [[voltage]]. By repeating this process, the controlling circuit converts the entire contents of the array in the semiconductor to a sequence of voltages. In a digital device, these voltages are then sampled, digitized, and usually stored in memory; in an analog device (such as an analog video camera), they are processed into a continuous analog signal (e.g. by feeding the output of the charge amplifier into a low-pass filter), which is then processed and fed out to other circuits for transmission, recording, or other processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[Gilbert F.

==Detailed physics of operation==

=== Charge generation ===
Before the MOS capacitors are exposed to light, they are [[biasing|biased]] into the depletion region; in n-channel CCDs, the silicon under the bias gate is slightly ''p''-doped or intrinsic. The gate is then biased at a positive potential, above the threshold for strong inversion, which will eventually result in the creation of a ''n'' channel below the gate as in a [[MOSFET]]. However, it takes time to reach this thermal equilibrium: up to hours in high-end scientific cameras cooled at low temperature.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, the specsheet of PI/Acton's [http://www.princetoninstruments.com/Uploads/Princeton/Documents/Datasheets/Princeton_Instruments_SPEC-10_2K_eXcelon_rev_N3_9.22.2011.pdf SPEC-10 camera] specifies a dark current of 0.3 electron per pixel per hour at -110 °C.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially after biasing, the holes are pushed far into the substrate, and no mobile electrons are at or near the surface; the CCD thus operates in a non-equilibrium state called deep depletion.&lt;ref name=sze&gt;{{cite book

}} Chapter 13.6.&lt;/ref&gt;
Then, when [[electron–hole pair]]s are generated in the depletion region, they are separated by the electric field, the electrons move toward the surface, and the holes move toward the substrate. Four pair-generation processes can be identified:
* photo-generation (up to 95% of [[quantum efficiency]]),
* generation in the depletion region,
* generation at the surface, and
* generation in the neutral bulk.

The last three processes are known as dark-current generation, and add noise to the image; they can limit the total usable integration time. The accumulation of electrons at or near the surface can proceed either until image integration is over and charge begins to be transferred, or thermal equilibrium is reached. In this case, the well is said to be full. The maximum capacity of each well is known as the well depth,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccd.com/ccd103.html Apogee CCD University - Pixel Binning]&lt;/ref&gt; typically about 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; electrons per pixel.&lt;ref name=sze /&gt;

=== Design and manufacturing ===
The photoactive region of a CCD is, generally, an [[epitaxial]] layer of [[silicon]]. It is lightly ''p'' doped (usually with [[boron]]) and is grown upon a [[substrate (materials science)|substrate]] material, often p++. In buried-channel devices, the type of design utilized in most modern CCDs, certain areas of the surface of the silicon are [[ion implantation|ion implanted]] with [[phosphorus]], giving them an n-doped designation. This region defines the channel in which the photogenerated charge packets will travel. [[Simon Sze]] details the advantages of a buried-channel device:&lt;ref name=sze /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;This thin layer (= 0.2–0.3 micron) is fully depleted and the accumulated photogenerated charge is kept away from the surface. This structure has the advantages of higher transfer efficiency and lower dark current, from reduced surface recombination. The penalty is smaller charge capacity, by a factor of 2–3 compared to the surface-channel CCD.&lt;/blockquote&gt; The gate oxide, i.e. the [[capacitor]] [[dielectric]], is grown on top of the epitaxial layer and substrate.

Later in the process, [[polysilicon]] gates are deposited by [[chemical vapor deposition]], patterned with [[photolithography]], and etched in such a way that the separately phased gates lie perpendicular to the channels. The channels are further defined by utilization of the [[LOCOS]] process to produce the [[channel stop]] region.

Channel stops are thermally grown [[oxide]]s that serve to isolate the charge packets in one column from those in another. These channel stops are produced before the polysilicon gates are, as the LOCOS process utilizes a high-temperature step that would destroy the gate material. The channel stops are parallel to, and exclusive of, the channel, or "charge carrying", regions.

Channel stops often have a p+ doped region underlying them, providing a further barrier to the electrons in the charge packets (this discussion of the physics of CCD devices assumes an [[electron]] transfer device, though hole transfer is possible).

The clocking of the gates, alternately high and low, will forward and reverse bias the diode that is provided by the buried channel (n-doped) and the epitaxial layer (p-doped). This will cause the CCD to deplete, near the [[p–n junction]] and will collect and move the charge packets beneath the gates—and within the channels—of the device.

CCD manufacturing and operation can be optimized for different uses. The above process describes a frame transfer CCD. While CCDs may be manufactured on a heavily doped p++ wafer it is also possible to manufacture a device inside p-wells that have been placed on an n-wafer. This second method, reportedly, reduces smear, [[dark current (physics)|dark current]], and [[infrared]] and red response. This method of manufacture is used in the construction of interline-transfer devices.

Another version of CCD is called a peristaltic CCD. In a peristaltic charge-coupled device, the charge-packet transfer operation is analogous to the peristaltic contraction and dilation of the [[digestive system]]. The peristaltic CCD has an additional implant that keeps the charge away from the silicon/[[silicon dioxide]] interface and generates a large lateral electric field from one gate to the next. This provides an additional driving force to aid in transfer of the charge packets.

==Architecture==
The CCD image sensors can be implemented in several different architectures. The most common are full-frame, frame-transfer, and interline. The distinguishing characteristic of each of these architectures is their approach to the problem of shuttering.

In a full-frame device, all of the image area is active, and there is no electronic shutter. A mechanical shutter must be added to this type of sensor or the image smears as the device is clocked or read out.

With a frame-transfer CCD, half of the silicon area is covered by an opaque mask (typically aluminum). The image can be quickly transferred from the image area to the opaque area or storage region with acceptable smear of a few percent. That image can then be read out slowly from the storage region while a new image is integrating or exposing in the active area. Frame-transfer devices typically do not require a mechanical shutter and were a common architecture for early solid-state broadcast cameras. The downside to the frame-transfer architecture is that it requires twice the silicon real estate of an equivalent full-frame device; hence, it costs roughly twice as much.

The interline architecture extends this concept one step further and masks every other column of the image sensor for storage. In this device, only one pixel shift has to occur to transfer from image area to storage area; thus, shutter times can be less than a microsecond and smear is essentially eliminated. The advantage is not free, however, as the imaging area is now covered by opaque strips dropping the [[fill factor (image sensor)|fill factor]] to approximately 50 percent and the effective [[quantum efficiency]] by an equivalent amount. Modern designs have addressed this deleterious characteristic by adding microlenses on the surface of the device to direct light away from the opaque regions and on the active area. Microlenses can bring the fill factor back up to 90 percent or more depending on pixel size and the overall system's optical design.

The choice of architecture comes down to one of utility. If the application cannot tolerate an expensive, failure-prone, power-intensive mechanical shutter, an interline device is the right choice. Consumer snap-shot cameras have used interline devices. On the other hand, for those applications that require the best possible light collection and issues of money, power and time are less important, the full-frame device is the right choice. Astronomers tend to prefer full-frame devices. The frame-transfer falls in between and was a common choice before the fill-factor issue of interline devices was addressed. Today, frame-transfer is usually chosen when an interline architecture is not available, such as in a back-illuminated device.

CCDs containing grids of [[pixel]]s are used in [[digital camera]]s, [[image scanner|optical scanners]], and video cameras as light-sensing devices. They commonly respond to 70 percent of the [[Ray_(optics)#incident_ray|incident]] light (meaning a quantum efficiency of about 70 percent) making them far more efficient than [[photographic film]], which captures only about 2 percent of the incident light.

[[Image:2.1 MP CCD Close Up.JPG|thumb|right|CCD from a 2.1 [[megapixel]] [[Hewlett-Packard]] digital camera]]

Most common types of CCDs are sensitive to near-infrared light, which allows [[infrared photography]], [[night-vision]] devices, and zero [[lux]] (or near zero lux) video-recording/photography. For normal silicon-based detectors, the sensitivity is limited to 1.1&amp;nbsp;μm. One other consequence of their sensitivity to infrared is that infrared from [[remote control]]s often appears on CCD-based digital cameras or camcorders if they do not have infrared blockers.

Cooling reduces the array's [[dark current (physics)|dark current]], improving the sensitivity of the CCD to low light intensities, even for ultraviolet and visible wavelengths. Professional observatories often cool their detectors with [[liquid nitrogen]] to reduce the dark current, and therefore the [[thermal noise]], to negligible levels.

===Frame transfer CCD===
[[File:IECCD55-20.jpg|thumb|top|A frame transfer CCD sensor]]

The frame transfer CCD imager was the first imaging structure proposed for CCD Imaging by Michael Tompsett at Bell Laboratories. A '''frame transfer CCD''' is a specialized CCD, often used in [[astronomy]] and some [[professional video camera]]s, designed for high exposure efficiency and correctness.

The normal functioning of a CCD, astronomical or otherwise, can be divided into two phases: exposure and readout. During the first phase, the CCD passively collects incoming [[photon]]s, storing [[electron]]s in its cells. After the exposure time is passed, the cells are read out one line at a time. During the readout phase, cells are shifted down the entire area of the CCD. While they are shifted, they continue to collect light. Thus, if the shifting is not fast enough, errors can result from light that falls on a cell holding charge during the transfer. These errors are referred to as "vertical smear" and cause a strong light source to create a vertical line above and below its exact location. In addition, the CCD cannot be used to collect light while it is being read out. Unfortunately, a faster shifting requires a faster readout, and a faster readout can introduce errors in the cell charge measurement, leading to a higher noise level.

A frame transfer CCD solves both problems: it has a shielded, not light sensitive, area containing as many cells as the area exposed to light. Typically, this area is covered by a reflective material such as aluminium. When the exposure time is up, the cells are transferred very rapidly to the hidden area. Here, safe from any incoming light, cells can be read out at any speed one deems necessary to correctly measure the cells' charge. At the same time, the exposed part of the CCD is collecting light again, so no delay occurs between successive exposures.

The disadvantage of such a CCD is the higher cost: the cell area is basically doubled, and more complex control electronics are needed.

===Intensified charge-coupled device===
{{Main article|Image intensifier}}
An intensified charge-coupled device (ICCD) is a CCD that is optically connected to an image intensifier that is mounted in front of the CCD.

An image intensifier includes three functional elements: a [[photocathode]], a [[micro-channel plate]] (MCP) and a [[phosphor]] screen. These three elements are mounted one close behind the other in the mentioned sequence. The photons which are coming from the light source fall onto the photocathode, thereby generating photoelectrons. The photoelectrons are accelerated towards the MCP by an electrical control voltage, applied between photocathode and MCP. The electrons are multiplied inside of the MCP and thereafter accelerated towards the phosphor screen. The phosphor screen finally converts the multiplied electrons back to photons which are guided to the CCD by a fiber optic or a lens.

An image intensifier inherently includes a [[shutter (photography)|shutter]] functionality: If the control voltage between the photocathode and the MCP is reversed, the emitted photoelectrons are not accelerated towards the MCP but return to the photocathode. Thus, no electrons are multiplied and emitted by the MCP, no electrons are going to the phosphor screen and no light is emitted from the image intensifier. In this case no light falls onto the CCD, which means that the shutter is closed. The process of reversing the control voltage at the photocathode is called ''gating'' and therefore ICCDs are also called gateable CCD cameras.

Besides the extremely high sensitivity of ICCD cameras, which enable single photon detection, the gateability is one of the major advantages of the ICCD over the [[charge-coupled device#Electron-multiplying CCD|EMCCD]] cameras. The highest performing ICCD cameras enable shutter times as short as 200 [[picosecond]]s.

ICCD cameras are in general somewhat higher in price than EMCCD cameras because they need the expensive image intensifier. On the other hand, EMCCD cameras need a cooling system to cool the EMCCD chip down to temperatures around 170 [[Kelvin|K]]. This cooling system adds additional costs to the EMCCD camera and often yields heavy condensation problems in the application.

ICCDs are used in [[night vision devices]] and in various scientific applications.

=== Electron-multiplying CCD ===
[[Image:EMCCD2 color en.svg|thumb|Electrons are transferred serially through the gain stages making up the multiplication register of an [[#Electron-multiplying CCD|EMCCD]]. The high voltages used in these serial transfers induce the creation of additional charge carriers through impact ionisation.]]
[[Image:Output vs input electrons.png|thumb|in an [[#Electron-multiplying CCD|EMCCD]] there is a dispersion (variation) in the number of electrons output by the multiplication register for a given (fixed) number of input electrons (shown in the legend on the right). The probability distribution for the number of output electrons is plotted [[logarithm]]ically on the vertical axis for a simulation of a multiplication register. Also shown are results from the [[empiricism|empirical]] fit equation shown on this page.]]

An '''electron-multiplying CCD''' (EMCCD, also known as an L3Vision CCD, a product commercialized by e2v Ltd., GB, L3CCD or Impactron CCD, a now-discontinued product offered in the past by Texas Instruments) is a charge-coupled device in which a gain register is placed between the shift register and the output amplifier. The gain register is split up into a large number of stages. In each stage, the electrons are multiplied by [[impact ionization]] in a similar way to an [[avalanche diode]]. The gain probability at every stage of the register is small (''P'' &lt; 2%), but as the number of elements is large (N &gt; 500), the overall gain can be very high (&lt;math&gt;g = (1 + P)^N&lt;/math&gt;), with single input electrons giving many thousands of output electrons. Reading a signal from a CCD gives a noise background, typically a few electrons. In an EMCCD, this noise is superimposed on many thousands of electrons rather than a single electron; the devices' primary advantage is thus their negligible readout noise. It is to be noted that the use of [[avalanche breakdown]] for amplification of photo charges had already been described in the {{US patent|3761744}} in 1973 by George E. Smith/Bell Telephone Laboratories.

EMCCDs show a similar sensitivity to [[charge-coupled device#Intensified charge-coupled device|intensified CCDs]] (ICCDs). However, as with ICCDs, the gain that is applied in the gain register is stochastic and the ''exact'' gain that has been applied to a pixel's charge is impossible to know. At high gains (&gt; 30), this uncertainty has the same effect on the [[signal-to-noise ratio]] (SNR) as halving the [[quantum efficiency]] (QE) with respect to operation with a gain of unity. However, at very low light levels (where the quantum efficiency is most important), it can be assumed that a pixel either contains an electron &amp;mdash; or not. This removes the noise associated with the stochastic multiplication at the risk of counting multiple electrons in the same pixel as a single electron. To avoid multiple counts in one pixel due to coincident photons in this mode of operation, high frame rates are essential. The dispersion in the gain is shown in the graph on the right. For multiplication registers with many elements and large gains it is well modelled by the equation:

&lt;math&gt;P\left (n \right ) = \frac{\left
 (n-m+1\right )^{m-1}}{\left (m-1 \right )!\left
 (g-1+\frac{1}{m}\right )^{m}}\exp \left ( -
 \frac{n-m+1}{g-1+\frac{1}{m}}\right )&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;n \ge m &lt;/math&gt;

where ''P'' is the probability of getting ''n'' output electrons given ''m'' input electrons and a total mean multiplication register gain of ''g''.

Because of the lower costs and better resolution, EMCCDs are capable of replacing ICCDs in many applications. ICCDs still have the advantage that they can be gated very fast and thus are useful in applications like [[range gate|range-gated imaging]]. EMCCD cameras indispensably need a cooling system &amp;mdash; using either [[thermoelectric cooling]] or liquid nitrogen &amp;mdash; to cool the chip down to temperatures in the range of {{convert|-65|to|-95|C}}. This cooling system unfortunately adds additional costs to the EMCCD imaging system and may yield condensation problems in the application. However, high-end EMCCD cameras are equipped with a permanent hermetic vacuum system confining the chip to avoid condensation issues.

The low-light capabilities of EMCCDs find use in astronomy and biomedical research, among other fields.  In particular, their low noise at high readout speeds makes them very useful for a variety of astronomical applications involving low light sources and transient events such as [[lucky imaging]] of faint stars, high speed [[photon counting]] photometry, [[Fabry-Pérot|Fabry-Pérot spectroscopy]] and high-resolution spectroscopy. More recently, these types of CCDs have broken into the field of biomedical research in low-light applications including [[small animal imaging]], [[single-molecule|single-molecule imaging]], [[Raman spectroscopy]], [[super resolution microscopy]] as well as a wide variety of modern [[fluorescence microscopy]] techniques thanks to greater SNR in low-light conditions in comparison with traditional CCDs and ICCDs.

In terms of noise, commercial EMCCD cameras typically have clock-induced charge (CIC) and dark current (dependent on the extent of cooling) that together lead to an effective readout noise ranging from 0.01 to 1 electrons per pixel read. However, recent improvements in EMCCD technology have led to a new generation of cameras capable of producing significantly less CIC, higher charge transfer efficiency and an EM gain 5 times higher than what was previously available. These advances in low-light detection lead to an effective total background noise of 0.001 electrons per pixel read, a noise floor unmatched by any other low-light imaging device.&lt;ref&gt;

== Use in astronomy ==
Due to the high quantum efficiencies of CCDs (for a [[quantum efficiency]] of 100%, one count equals one photon), linearity of their outputs, ease of use compared to photographic plates, and a variety of other reasons, CCDs were very rapidly adopted by astronomers for nearly all UV-to-infrared applications.

Thermal noise and [[cosmic ray]]s may alter the pixels in the CCD array. To counter such effects, astronomers take several exposures with the CCD shutter closed and opened. The average of images taken with the shutter closed is necessary to lower the random noise. Once developed, the [[dark frame subtraction|dark frame average image is then subtracted]] from the open-shutter image to remove the dark current and other systematic defects ([[dead pixel]]s, hot pixels, etc.) in the CCD.

The [[Hubble Space Telescope]], in particular, has a highly developed series of steps (“data reduction pipeline”) to convert the raw CCD data to useful images.&lt;ref name = "ESO-Hainaut-CCD image processing"&gt;

CCD cameras used in [[astrophotography]] often require sturdy mounts to cope with vibrations from wind and other sources, along with the tremendous weight of most imaging platforms. To take long exposures of galaxies and nebulae, many astronomers use a technique known as [[autoguider|auto-guiding]]. Most autoguiders use a second CCD chip to monitor deviations during imaging. This chip can rapidly detect errors in tracking and command the mount motors to correct for them.

[[Image:SDSSFaceplate.gif|thumb|right|Array of 30 CCDs used on the [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey]] telescope imaging camera, an example of "drift-scanning".]]

An unusual astronomical application of CCDs, called drift-scanning, uses a CCD to make a fixed telescope behave like a tracking telescope and follow the motion of the sky. The charges in the CCD are transferred and read in a direction parallel to the motion of the sky, and at the same speed. In this way, the telescope can image a larger region of the sky than its normal field of view. The [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey]] is the most famous example of this, using the technique to a survey of over a quarter of the sky.

In addition to imagers, CCDs are also used in an array of analytical instrumentation  including [[spectrometer]]s&lt;ref&gt;V. Deckert and W. Kiefer, Scanning multichannel technique for improved spectrochemical measurements with a CCD camera and its application to Raman spectroscopy, ''Appl. Spectros.''

Digital color cameras generally use a [[Bayer filter|Bayer mask]] over the CCD. Each square of four pixels has one filtered red, one blue, and two green (the [[human eye]] is more sensitive to green than either red or blue). The result of this is that [[luminance]] information is collected at every pixel, but the color resolution is lower than the luminance resolution.

Better color separation can be reached by three-CCD devices ([[3CCD]]) and a [[dichroic prism|dichroic beam splitter prism]], that splits the [[image]] into [[red]], [[green]] and [[blue]] components. Each of the three CCDs is arranged to respond to a particular color. Many [[professional video camera|professional video]] camcorders, and some semi-professional camcorders, use this technique, although developments in competing CMOS technology have made CMOS sensors, both with beam-splitters and bayer filters, increasingly popular in high-end video and digital cinema cameras. Another advantage of 3CCD over a Bayer mask device is higher [[quantum efficiency]] (and therefore higher light sensitivity for a given aperture size). This is because in a 3CCD device most of the light entering the aperture is captured by a sensor, while a Bayer mask absorbs a high proportion (about 2/3) of the light falling on each CCD pixel.

For still scenes, for instance in microscopy, the resolution of a Bayer mask device can be enhanced by [[microscanning]] technology. During the process of [[co-site sampling|color co-site sampling]], several frames of the scene are produced. Between acquisitions, the sensor is moved in pixel dimensions, so that each point in the visual field is acquired consecutively by elements of the mask that are sensitive to the red, green and blue components of its color. Eventually every pixel in the image has been scanned at least once in each color and the resolution of the three channels become equivalent (the resolutions of red and blue channels are quadrupled while the green channel is doubled).

===Sensor sizes===
{{Main article|Image sensor format}}
Sensors (CCD / CMOS) come in various sizes, or image sensor formats. These sizes are often referred to with an inch fraction designation such as 1/1.8″ or 2/3″ called the [[optical format]]. This measurement actually originates back in the 1950s and the time of [[video camera tube|Vidicon tubes]].

[[Image:Vertical smear.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Vertical smear]]
When a CCD exposure is long enough, eventually the electrons that collect in the "bins" in the brightest part of the image will overflow the bin, resulting in blooming. The structure of the CCD allows the electrons to flow more easily in one direction than another, resulting in vertical streaking.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Some anti-blooming features that can be built into a CCD reduce its sensitivity to light by using some of the pixel area for a drain structure.&lt;ref&gt;

[[James M. Early]] developed a vertical anti-blooming drain that would not detract from the light collection area, and so did not reduce light sensitivity.

One might argue that he invented the [[sewing machine]].  He was born in Germany, but was in England at the time of invention.  For his invention of a double pointed needle with an eye at one end, he received the British Patent No. 701 (1755).&lt;ref name="sewing"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://indecohotels.com/sewingmachinebeginning.html |title=Sewing Machine Beginning |accessdate=2012-12-17|work=Sewing}}&lt;/ref&gt; but after in 1830 [[Barthélemy Thimonnier]] reinvented the [[sewing machine]].

'''Civic Agriculture''' is the trend towards locally based [[agriculture]] and food production that is tightly linked to a community's social and economic development. Civic agriculture is geared towards meeting consumer demands in addition to boosting the local economy in the process through jobs, entrepreneurship, and community sustainability.&lt;ref name="Civic Agriculture"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bBnyuu709BgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Civic+Agriculture:+Reconnecting+Farm,+Food,+and+Community&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwioxeH7pfXeAhWrtlkKHWeVDvYQ6AEIMDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Civic%20Agriculture:%20Reconnecting%20Farm,%20Food,%20and%20Community&amp;f=false|title=Civic Agriculture: Reconnecting Farm, Food, and Community|last=Lyson|first=Thomas A.|date=2004|publisher=UPNE|isbn=9781584654148|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=November 2018}} The term was first coined by Thomas Lyson, professor of Sociology at Cornell, to represent an alternative means of sustainability for rural agricultural communities in the era of industrialized agriculture.&lt;ref name="Civic Agriculture" /&gt;{{Page needed|date=November 2018}}&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Civic agriculture is geared towards fostering a self sustainable local economy through an integral community structure in which the entire community is in some part responsible for their food production.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Origin ==
Civic agriculture is a means by which rural agricultural communities can remain subsistent in a largely industrialized agriculture sector.  The term was coined by the late Thomas A. Lyson, Department of Development Sociology, Cornell University, at the 1999 Rural Sociology Society Annual Meeting.&lt;ref name="Civic Agriculture" /&gt;{{Page needed|date=November 2018}} In his 2004 book, ''Civic Agriculture: Reconnecting Farm, Food and Community''  Lyson argues that in containing food production for a specific community to that community, one is further connecting the community so that it may be economically independent and socially unified. Lyson expounds on his ideas, arguing that because of the interlocked relationship between the food economy and consumers, people have a civic duty to support important agricultural engagements. In his book, Lyson claims that communities that show an active involvement in civic agriculture aid economic development by supporting their local food production.&lt;ref name="Civic Agriculture" /&gt;{{Page needed|date=November 2018}} Thus, in committing to civic agriculture, local communities contribute to an economic growth in the agricultural sector.

Manifestations of movement towards Civic Agriculture:
* [[Community Supported Agriculture]] ([[Community Supported Agriculture|CSA]])
* [[Farmer's markets]]
*Specialized agricultural districts
*Alternative food stores
* [[Artisanal food]]
* [[consumers' cooperative|Consumer cooperatives]]

== Local Economy ==
The basis of civic agriculture is rooted in pre-industrialization farming practices. Farmers today are turning to civic agriculture in order to remain economically viable within an industrialized society and corporate agriculture practices. Civic agriculture promotes the sustainability of the local economy by containing the source and production of food to a particular region.&lt;ref name="Civic Agriculture" /&gt;{{Page needed|date=November 2018}} Dependent upon the advanced nature of the civic agriculture production, that region is then reliant upon a small subset of farmers for the majority of their food goods. Thus, that subset of farmers must farm a variety of commodities in order to provide for the region.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This practice fosters entrepreneurship within the community by treating farming as an economically viable practice, creates jobs through employment of the local community, and keeps the production and consumption of agriculture in one region making that region economically sustainable within itself.&lt;ref name="Civic Agriculture" /&gt;{{Page needed|date=November 2018}}

== Community Support ==
Civic agriculture connects the community by eliminating the fragmented nature of agriculture production. It reconnects farmers to the community and creates a social connection between the farmers and the community that is dependent upon them. The community is linked together by the prospect of its success being dependent upon the success of the collective. Civic agriculture ensures locally oriented practices that serve as a driving force for the way in which the community operates socially and politically. Socially, the general well being of the community becomes a primary concern when civic agriculture is being practiced.&lt;ref name="Civic Agriculture" /&gt;{{Page needed|date=November 2018}}

== Thomas Lyson &amp; Lyson Center for Civic Agriculture and Food Systems ==
Thomas Lyson was a notable sociologist who spent much of his professional career analyzing the possible impacts and outcomes of civic agriculture. After coining the phrase in 1999, Lyson  used his time as a professor at Cornell University to propose ways that rural communities could support themselves not only by providing food to the community, but also by providing jobs and thus supporting the local, rural economy.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lysoncenter.org/index.php/about-the-lyson-center/layout|title=Thomas A. Lyson|website=www.lysoncenter.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lyson's interest in rural community subsistence stemmed from his time spent traveling the globe, specifically in the back roads of Appalachia.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; In his novel ''Civic Agriculture: Reconnecting Farm, Food, and Community'', Lyson warns against the increasingly industrial approach being developed in the world of agriculture today as being detrimental to the independent family farm which serves as the backbone of the rural community.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dupuis|first=E.

An animal '''collar''' is a device that attached to the neck of an animal to allow it to be harnessed, tied up or for various other reasons.

*'''Pet collar'''. A piece of material put around the neck of certain pet animals, such as dogs, cats or pigs, for control, identification, or other purposes. Identification tags and medical information is often placed on collars. Collars are also useful for controlling the animal, as they provide a handle for grabbing or means of leading. Similar collars are used with non-pet animals, such as zoo animals and livestock. Pet collars can be made of [[leather]], [[nylon]] or [[metal]]. Metal collars are normally used for larger and dangerous dogs. They can come with traditional or quick-release buckles. Collars are sometimes used for [[fashion]] purposes.
*'''Cat collar'''. Similar to dog collars, but often include a bell to warn fauna of the cat's presence. Collars used on cats are smaller and thinner. They can be made of leather, nylon or other types of materials. Some of the cat collars have a solution impregnated which is helpful in fighting against [[flea]], [[tick]] and [[mosquito]]es.
*'''Anti-bark dog collar''', or '''bark control collar'''. Produces a citronella spray or a high pitched sound in response to loud noise, to distract and deter a dog from barking. Bark control collars come in different designs and with various modalities to keep a dog quiet. Other than citronella bark collars, there are the sonic or [[Ultrasound|ultrasonic]] collars which also use [[vibration]] to stop a dog barking. These collars produce a very high [[resonance]] tone which cannot be heard by [[humans]] and which comes as a response to barking. Once a dog has worn the collar for a while, the sound or the vibration will cause it distress which will eventually lead to deterring it barking. Other bark control collars include devices that produce a mild electrical sensation whenever the dog barks. These types of collars must have a failsafe mechanism incorporated to make sure that the device is automatically turned off after a certain period of time. Many designs come with a combination of the bark collars mentioned above. Another type of bark control collar is the escalation one, a device that produces quiet sounds which keep increasing in intensity if the dog does not cease barking. They have proven{{citation needed|date=August 2011}} to be more effective than the other types of bark control collars because the dog may get used to stop barking before the device produces sounds of high levels of output. However, the use of such collars is controversial. Many do not see these options as [[safe]] and viable, especially considering the electrical ones. Some pet owners criticize these devices, seeing in them a method of [[torture]]. As a result, it is recommended{{Who|date=August 2011}} that all the other options such as training, trying to understand the communication or seeking professional advice should be considered before choosing these bark control collars.
*'''Training collar or [[shock collar]]'''. These (usually for dogs) use an electric shock to improve animal training, reinforce commands and eliminate any bad habits. It may be combined with an "[[Pet fence|invisible fence]]", a signal wire surrounding the dog's permitted area, the dog receiving a shock if it strays too near it.
*'''Choke collars''' are also a type of training collars. They are made of different materials with high resistance such as metal or various composites. This type of collar is suitable for obedience training as it tightens around the [[neck]] of the dog if it goes further than the owner allows it to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trainingcollar.com/| title=Silent Training Choke Collar|date=|accessdate= 4 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is mainly used on dogs.
*{{anchor|flea collar}}'''Insect collar''' or '''flea collar'''. Impregnated with chemicals that repel or kill external [[parasite]]s. They are usually a supplementary collar, worn in addition to the conventional buckle collar on a dog. They are also used on horses. The effectiveness of flea collars is arguable. Although they are convenient because of their [[cost]] and of their accessibility as well as the comfort they provide for the pet, they only protect them from fleas that could be found around the neck. Flea collars are considered to be more effective in preventing infestation with external parasites rather than fighting against them. Flea collars are best used when a proper disinfestation has been performed, both indoor and [[outdoor]]. These collars are primarily worn by cats and dogs. A number of the [[insecticides]] used in these flea collars are toxic.&lt;ref name="tbs"&gt;[http://www.thebugsquad.com/fleas/flea-collar-on-pets Flea Collar – Do They Work or Endanger Your Pet?] - The Bug Squad, Updated 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Although they are usually safely secured around the neck, remember that the poison can easily be transferred from one pet to another if you have a couple animals in the home. Beware of flea collars that are promoted as being "natural" as they often contain [[essential oils]] and herbs that are dangerous to certain pets (like cats) as their bodies cannot metabolize it.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}
*'''Pig hunting dog collar'''. This collar integrates a wide collar and a breastplate for dogs that hunt pigs. They are made from multiple layers of extra tough fabric or leather to protect the vital carotid artery and jugular vein of pig hunting dogs should they be attacked. Some of the pig hunting dog collars come in the form of a full-body protection collar. These collars provide good protection for the dog's [[chest]], neck and [[rib cage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bristlebusters.com.au/FULL-BODY-COLLAR.html|title=Duncan's Full Body Collar|date=|accessdate=4 June 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100607041823/http://www.bristlebusters.com.au/FULL-BODY-COLLAR.html|archivedate=7 June 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Elizabethan collar]]'''. Shaped like a lamp shade to prevent an animal from licking something on their body, such as a wound.
*'''Tie-up collar'''. Used for bulls and other cattle, these may be a chain (sometimes covered in plastic hose), or a collar of heavy leather or synthetic material fastened with a heavy duty buckle.
*'''Animal tracking collar'''. Used for [[tracking animal migration]], or to locate lost pets. In its simplest form contains a [[Electric beacon|radio beacon]] to allow the location of the animal. More sophisticated devices may contain a [[GPS tracking]] unit to record the animal's track, other sensors to record water depth or other environmental information, and a [[mobile phone]] or other radio transmitter to report location and other data. May have a timed or remotely controlled release device.
*'''Horse collars'''.
**'''Full collar''' or '''[[Horse Collar]]'''. Used for horses or other [[draught animal]]s, this consists of a robustly constructed [[leather]] device stuffed with [[straw]] or other material, that sits comfortably on the animal's shoulders around its lower neck, supporting a set of [[Horse harness#Parts of the harness|hame]]s that transfer the draught forces from the animal to the traces.
**'''[[Breastplate (tack)|Breast collar]]''' or '''breastplate'''. Two forms: One is a simpler type of draught collar for lighter loads, consisting of a padded strap around the chest of the animal. The other is similar, but is attached to a [[saddle]] and used when riding a horse to prevent the saddle from sliding back.
**'''Horse tie-up collar'''. A collar designed to teach horses to tie up and to tie stallions at public events. It is constructed from double-stitched wide leather (sometimes fleece lined), with heavy duty dees sewn into each end. The collar is placed on a horse just behind the poll strap of a headcollar (headstall) which is used in conjunction, and a strong rope passes through the headcollar to secure the two dees so that the horse's wind is not impaired in any way. This manner of application will reduce the likelihood of the collar slipping and injuring or choking the horse. Sometimes used for tethering horses, they are expensive and are potentially dangerous if the horse should become entangled in the tether or frightened etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilovedogfriendly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/NEWC-Code-of-Practice-for-Tethering-Equines-Nov-2006-Rev-1-300913.pdf Code of Practice for Tethering Equines]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
**'''Mare collar'''. A simple buckled neck strap that has a plastic ID tag attached.
**'''Headcollar''' or '''[[halter]]'''. Not strictly a collar, this consists of straps around the head for tethering, tying or leading horses or other livestock.
**'''Cribbing or wind-sucking collar'''. The "Nutcracker" collar is an adjustable strap with a lightweight aluminium 'nutcracker'. It is placed around a horse's neck to help prevent windsucking by stopping the flexing of the neck muscles whenever it tries to suck in air. Other varieties are also available, too.
**'''Cornell Collar''' A device developed for use on racehorses to prevent dorsal displacement of the soft palate during racing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.racingnsw.com.au/pdf/vi.CornellCollar.pdf Cornell Collar] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080819164906/http://www.racingnsw.com.au/pdf/vi.CornellCollar.pdf |date=19 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
**'''Neck cradle'''. Used on horses to prevent them chewing at injuries and dressings.

[[File:Daniel grant on 'Dynamic Cat'.JPG|thumb|A yellow neck strap on a racehorse.]]
**'''Neck strap'''. A simple narrow leather strap buckled around a horse's neck to give security to [[jockey]]s and other riders. Up until several years it was only used by beginner riders, but has now become popular with jockeys who ride with a very short stirrup leather. Another form of neck strap (or rope) is the one used by cowboys when roping. This style is shorter and placed closer to the horse's head with the lariat passing through it, in order to keep the horse facing the calf after it has been roped. It also refers to the part of a martingale, which buckles around the horse's neck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bucklin|first=Gincy Self|title=How Your Horse Wants You to Ride: Starting Out, Starting Over|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I8kBfota_zMC&amp;pg=PA131&amp;lpg=PA131&amp;dq=Jockey+and+%22neck+strap%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=50BEfOz_C2&amp;sig=f74McGRLPj0BtnUyqjbqP_CbDqM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=lATjTYrTBtHOrQfquJWbBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CFkQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|work=Google Books|publisher=Howell Book House|accessdate=30 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A loose neck collar is also used on harness racing horses when the reins are passed through it.

Collars can be dangerous for pets that live in [[crate]]s or which might get stuck in [[tree branch]]es and that is why safety collars have been developed. There is a particular type of safety collar which is intended for both dogs and cats. Breakaway collars are especially designed to prevent the pet from choking or getting stuck because of their collar. They feature a clever design that releases quickly when a small amount of [[pressure]] is applied, such as the cat hanging from a tree branch. The clasp will release, which quickly gets the pet out of a possibly desperate situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.safepetcollar.com/|title=Safe Pet Collars Deals|date=|accessdate=4 June 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100509151708/http://www.safepetcollar.com/|archivedate=9 May 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is recommended that pets have their collar removed before sleeping in a wired crate.

'''''Core77''''' is an online design magazine dedicated to the practice and produce of the field of [[industrial design]].  It serves as a resource for students, practitioners and fans of the field, as well as a venue for essays and reports on the topic of design in general. Historically, most of the magazine's content has been produced by volunteer contributors.

The site began as the graduate thesis of Stuart Constantine and Eric Ludlum in their final year at Brooklyn, New York's [[Pratt Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;Palacio, Bryony Gomez  and Armin Vit: ''Graphic Design, Referenced: A Visual Guide to the Language, Applications, and History of Graphic Design''. Rockport: Quayside, 2009, p.114. {{ISBN|978-1-59253-447-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The site was launched in March 1995 and has been updated on a monthly basis since. It was first hosted at Interport, an early [[ISP]] in New York City; later it moved to its own domain.

Core77's popularity as a general design destination for the public has grown in recent years, leading to references of the site in ''[[The New York Times]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Koerner |first=Brendan |date=December 31, 2006 |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/31/business/yourmoney/31goods.html?adxnnl=1&amp;adxnnlx=1191816411-46cB7hK1DfjvCnKcQhVFYg |title=And Now, Memory on a Twig }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/15/magazine/15FOB-consumed-t.html |title=Reality Bytes |website=nytimes.com |date=2009-11-13 |accessdate=2017-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/1571835/core77-rescue-pop-shelters-haiti-and-chile|title=ID students recognized by the Core77 Design Awards|website=fastcompany.com |date=2010-03-05 |accessdate=2017-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[PC Magazine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Monson, Kyle.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3454">[[File:Cyanometer.jpg|thumb|Horace-Bénédict de Saussure's cyanometer, 1760]]
A '''cyanometer''' (from [[cyan]] and [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/-meter -meter]) is an [[measuring instrument|instrument for measuring]] 'blueness', specifically the colour intensity of blue [[sky]]. It is attributed to  [[Horace-Bénédict de Saussure]] and [[Alexander von Humboldt]]. It consists of squares of paper dyed in graduated shades of blue and arranged in a color circle or square that can be held up and compared to the color of the sky.

De Saussure is credited with inventing the cyanometer in 1789.&lt;ref&gt;H-B de Saussure, Description d'un cyanomètre ou d'un appareil destiné à mesurer la transparence de l'air, Mem. Acad. Roy. Turin, 1788-89, 4,  409&lt;/ref&gt; De Saussure's cyanometer had 53 sections, ranging from white to varying shades of blue (dyed with [[Prussian blue]]) and then to black,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/Issues/2010/October/SaussuresCyanometer.asp Saussure's cyanometer], from the Royal Society of Chemistry.&lt;/ref&gt; arranged in a circle; he used the device to measure the color of the sky at [[Geneva]], [[Chamonix]], and [[Mont Blanc]].&lt;ref&gt;Pedro Lilienfeld, "A Blue Sky History." (2004). ''Optics and Photonics News''. Vol. 15, Issue 6, pp. 32-39. {{doi|10.1364/OPN.15.6.000032}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Saussure concluded, correctly, that the color of the sky was dependent on the amount of suspended particles in the atmosphere.

Humboldt was also an eager user of the cyanometer on his voyages and explorations in South America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Why the sky is blue: discovering the color of life | author = Götz Hoeppe | isbn = 978-0-691-12453-7 | url =  https://books.google.com/books?id=-7inyeQbBjQC&amp;pg=PA110 | page =110 | year = 2007 | publisher = [[Princeton University]] | location = Princeton, New Jersey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The blueness of the [[atmosphere]] indicates transparency and the amount of [[water vapour]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5962">A '''design engineer''' is a person who may be involved in any of various engineering disciplines including [[civil engineer|civil]], [[mechanical engineering|mechanical]], [[electrical engineering|electrical]], [[chemical engineer|chemical]], [[textiles]], [[Aerospace engineer|aerospace]], [[Nuclear engineer|nuclear]], [[Manufacturing Engineer|manufacturing]],  [[systems engineer|systems]], and [[structural]] /[[building]]/[[architectural]].
Design engineers tend to work on products and systems that involve adapting and using complex scientific and mathematical techniques.  The emphasis tends to be on utilizing [[engineering physics]] and sciences to develop solutions for society.

The design engineer usually works with a team of engineers and other designers to develop conceptual and detailed designs that ensure a product actually functions, performs and is fit for its purpose. They may work with industrial designers and marketers to develop the product concept and specifications to meet customer needs and may direct the design effort. In many engineering areas, a distinction is made between the design engineer and the planning engineer in design; [[analysis]] is important for planning engineers while synthesis is more paramount for design engineers.

When the design involves public safety, the design engineer is usually required to be licensed, for example, a [[Regulation and licensure in engineering|professional engineer]] in the U.S and Canada.  There is usually an "industrial exemption" for design engineers working on project internal to companies and not delivering professional services directly to the public.

==Design engineer tasks==
Design engineers may work in a team along with other designers to create the drawings necessary for [[prototyping]] and production, or in the case of buildings, for [[construction]].  However, with the advent of [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] and solid modeling software, the design engineers may create the drawings themselves, or perhaps with the help of many corporate service providers.

The next responsibility of many design engineers is prototyping. A model of the product is created and reviewed. Prototypes are either functional or non-functional. Functional "alpha" prototypes are used for testing; non-functional prototypes are used for form and fit checking. [[Virtual prototyping]] and hence for any such software solutions may also be used. This stage is where design flaws are found and corrected, and tooling, manufacturing fixtures, and packaging are developed.

Once the "alpha" prototype is finalized after many iterations, the next step is the "beta" pre-production prototype. The design engineer, working with an [[industrial engineer]], [[manufacturing engineer]], and [[quality control|quality engineer]], reviews an initial run of components and assemblies for design compliance and fabrication/manufacturing methods analysis.  This is often determined through [[statistical process control]]. Variations in the product are correlated to aspects of the process and eliminated. The most common metric used is the [[process capability index]] C&lt;SUB&gt;pk&lt;/SUB&gt;. A C&lt;SUB&gt;pk&lt;/SUB&gt; of 1.0 is considered the baseline acceptance for full production go-ahead.

The design engineer may follow the product and make requested changes and corrections throughout the life of the product. This is referred to as "cradle to grave" engineering. The design engineer works closely with the manufacturing engineer throughout the product life cycle. 

The design process is an information intensive one, and design engineers have been found to spend 56% of their time engaged in various information behaviours, including 14% actively searching for information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Robinson | first1 = M. A. | year = 2010 | title = An empirical analysis of engineers' information behaviors | doi = 10.1002/asi.21290 | journal = Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology | volume = 61 | issue = 4| pages = 640–658 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to design engineers' core technical competence, research has demonstrated the critical nature of their personal attributes, project management skills, and cognitive abilities to succeed in the role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Robinson | first1 = M. A. | last2 = Sparrow | first2 = P. R. | last3 = Clegg | first3 = C. | last4 = Birdi | first4 = K. | year = 2005 | title = Design engineering competencies: Future requirements and predicted changes in the forthcoming decade | doi = 10.1016/j.destud.2004.09.004 | journal = Design Studies | volume = 26 | issue = 2| pages = 123–153 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amongst other more detailed findings, a recent [[work sampling]] study&lt;ref name="Robinson (2012) DS"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Robinson | first1 = M. A. | year = 2012 | title = How design engineers spend their time: Job content and task satisfaction | doi = 10.1016/j.destud.2012.03.002 | journal = Design Studies | volume = 33 | issue = 4| pages = 391–425 }}&lt;/ref&gt; found that design engineers spend 62.92% of their time engaged in technical work, 40.37% in social work, and 49.66% in computer-based work. There was considerable overlap between these different types of work, with engineers spending 24.96% of their time engaged in technical and social work, 37.97% in technical and non-social, 15.42% in non-technical and social, and 21.66% in non-technical and non-social.

'''Digital Ocean, Inc.,''' was a maker of wireless products from 1992 to 1998.

It was eventually bought by [[Harris Semiconductor]] and its assets made part of Harris's Intersil Division, which was spun off in 1999 into [[Intersil|Intersil Corporation]].

The company was founded in May 1992 by Jeffery Alholm and headquartered in Lenexa, [[Kansas]].&lt;ref name="Starting Up in, Yes, Kansas, By Robert Bellinger"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bellinger|first=Robert|title=Starting Up in, Yes, Kansas|url=https://docs.google.com/open?id=0BzYhO2GOsZXuc0xPSDRBZXp1OXM|publisher=Unknown|accessdate=21 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several contracts with [[Apple Inc.]],&lt;ref name="InfoWorld, Vol. 17, Issue 2, 9 January 1995, Newton-based PDA Announced- Digital Ocean’s Tarpon the Result of Joint Venture with Apple, by Tom Quinlan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PR Newswire via The Free Library. 3 Nov 1995.

It was a co-developer of the [[IEEE 802.11]] wireless standard and of the industry’s first 802.11 chipset. It developed the Seahorse, arguably the world's first [[smartphone]].&lt;ref name="Digital Ocean Selects PCSI's CDPD Solution for its Seahorse Handheld Computer. Business Wire, 25 March 1996.

Digital Ocean was granted approximately 20 patents for its development of wireless technologies.

In 1998 it was sold with its assets to [[Harris Semiconductor]] to become part of their [[Intersil]] division; Intersil was then spun off from Harris one year later.

The Grouper line of products were networking devices that used spread-spectrum radio waves to communicate. Groupers could be attached to any PowerBook or used freestanding with any desktop Mac. Placing one Grouper on a wired network would have it serve as a hub for up to 15 other wireless Groupers. Keeping with Digital Ocean's theme, the collection of networked computers was called a school.

Digital Ocean developed and sold a complete family of [[LocalTalk]] and [[ethernet]] wireless network adapters for use with [[Macintosh]] desktops, [[PowerBook]]s, and [[Newton (platform)|Newtons]]. In addition, the company’s [[microcellular]] roaming permitted virtually unlimited wireless coverage areas. Their Starfish Access Points deployed microcellular roaming over a building or campus, allowing seamless wireless LAN connections over the entire area, similar to cellular telephones.

In 1996, Digital Ocean partnered with two other companies to provide Apple and PC platforms with their first ability to be on the same wireless LAN network through a single access point. The solution viewed each computer as an agnostic system when accessing the network, which placed all computers on equal footing in regards to their ability to communicate across an enterprise.&lt;ref name="First Wireless LAN Solution for Mixed PC and Macintosh Environments Now Available From Digital Ocean, Digital Equipment Corporation, and Lucent Technologies.

This work led to one common MAC chip for the three parties. Although branded differently for each partner, this common chip came from one manufacturing line and was then sorted and sold by AT&amp;T/Lucent, Harris Semiconductor/Intersil (which by 1998 had acquired Digital Ocean and its assets), and Aironet/Cisco.

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="82953">In [[engineering]] and [[science]], '''dimensional analysis''' is the analysis of the relationships between different [[physical quantities]] by identifying their [[base quantity|base quantities]] (such as [[length]], [[mass]], [[time]], and [[electric charge]]) and [[units of measure]] (such as miles vs. kilometers, or pounds vs. kilograms) and tracking these dimensions as calculations or comparisons are performed. The [[conversion of units]] from one dimensional unit to another is often somewhat complex. Dimensional analysis, or more specifically the '''factor-label method''', also known as the '''unit-factor method''', is a widely used technique for such conversions using the rules of [[algebra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=David |last=Goldberg|title=Fundamentals of Chemistry|edition=5th |publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2006|isbn=978-0-07-322104-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=James |last=Ogden|title=The Handbook of Chemical Engineering|publisher=Research &amp; Education Association|year=1999|isbn=978-0-87891-982-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kentchemistry.com/links/Measurements/dimensionalanalysis.htm |title=Dimensional Analysis or the Factor Label Method |website=Mr Kent's Chemistry Page}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of '''physical dimension''' was introduced by [[Joseph Fourier]] in 1822.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Fourier |first=Joseph |title=Theorie analytique de la chaleur |publisher=Firmin Didot |location=Paris |year=1822 |language=fr |url=https://books.google.com/?id=TDQJAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PR3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Physical quantities that are of the same kind (also called ''commensurable'') have the same dimension (length, time, mass) and can be directly compared to each other, even if they are originally expressed in differing units of measure (such as yards and meters).  If physical quantities have different dimensions (such as length vs. mass), they cannot be expressed in terms of similar units and cannot be compared in quantity (also called ''incommensurable''). For example, asking whether a kilogram is larger than an hour is meaningless.

Any physically meaningful [[equation]] (and any [[inequality (mathematics)|inequality]]) will have the same dimensions on its left and right sides, a property known as ''dimensional homogeneity''. Checking for dimensional homogeneity is a common application of dimensional analysis, serving as a plausibility check on [[Formal proof|derived]] equations and computations.  It also serves as a guide and constraint in deriving equations that may describe a physical system in the absence of a more rigorous derivation.

== Concrete numbers and base units ==

A lot of parameters and the measurements(m) in the physical sciences and engineering are expressed as a [[concrete number]] – a numerical quantity(q) and a corresponding dimensional unit.  Often a quantity is expressed in terms of several other quantities; for example, speed is a combination of length and time, e.g. 60 miles per hour or 1.4&amp;nbsp;kilometers per second.  Compound relations with "per" are expressed with [[Division (mathematics)|division]], e.g. 60&amp;nbsp;mi/1&amp;nbsp;h.  Other relations can involve [[multiplication]] (often shown with a [[centered dot]] or [[wikt:juxtaposition|juxtaposition]]), powers (like m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for square meters), or combinations thereof.

A set of [[Base unit (measurement)|base unit]]s for a [[system of measurement]] is a conventionally chosen set of units, none of which can be expressed as a combination of the others, and in terms of which all the remaining units of the system can be expressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.bipm.org/utils/common/documents/jcgm/JCGM_200_2012.pdf |author=JCGM 200 |year=2012 |title=International vocabulary of metrology – Basic and general concepts and associated terms (VIM) |edition=3rd |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923224356/http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/documents/jcgm/JCGM_200_2012.pdf |archive-date=2015-09-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, units for [[length]] and [[time]] are normally chosen as base units.  Units for [[volume]], however, can be factored into the base units of length (m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), thus they are considered derived or compound units.

Sometimes the names of units obscure the fact that they are derived units. For example, a [[newton (unit)|newton]] (N) is a unit of [[force]], which will have units of mass (kg) times acceleration (m⋅s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;). The newton is defined as {{nowrap|1=1 N = 1 kg⋅m⋅s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

=== Percentages and derivatives ===
Percentages are dimensionless quantities, since they are ratios of two quantities with the same dimensions.  In other words, the % sign can be read as "hundredths", since {{nowrap|1=1% = 1/100}}.

Taking a derivative with respect to a quantity adds the dimension of the variable one is differentiating with respect to, in the denominator. Thus:
* position (''x'') has the dimension L (length);
* derivative of position with respect to time (''dx''/''dt'', [[velocity]]) has dimension LT&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; – length from position, time due to the derivative;
* the second derivative (''d''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''x''/''dt''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = (''dx''/''dt'') / ''dt'', [[acceleration]]) has dimension LT&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;.
In economics, one distinguishes between [[stocks and flows]]: a stock has units of "units" (say, widgets or dollars), while a flow is a derivative of a stock, and has units of "units/time" (say, dollars/year).

In some contexts, dimensional quantities are expressed as dimensionless quantities or percentages by omitting some dimensions. For example, [[debt-to-GDP ratio]]s are generally expressed as percentages: total debt outstanding (dimension of currency) divided by annual GDP (dimension of currency) – but one may argue that in comparing a stock to a flow, annual GDP should have dimensions of currency/time (dollars/year, for instance), and thus Debt-to-GDP should have units of years, which indicates that Debt-to-GDP is the number of years needed for a constant GDP to pay the debt, if all GDP is spent on the debt and the debt is otherwise unchanged.

== Conversion factor ==
{{Main article|Conversion factor}}
In dimensional analysis, a ratio which converts one unit of measure into another without changing the quantity is called a [[conversion factor]].  For example, kPa and bar are both units of pressure, and {{nowrap|1=100 kPa = 1 bar}}.  The rules of algebra allow both sides of an equation to be divided by the same expression, so this is equivalent to {{nowrap|1=100 kPa / 1 bar = 1}}.  Since any quantity can be multiplied by 1 without changing it, the expression "{{nowrap|100 kPa / 1 bar}}" can be used to convert from bars to kPa by multiplying it with the quantity to be converted, including units.  For example, {{nowrap|1=5 bar × 100 kPa / 1 bar = 500 kPa}} because {{nowrap|1=5 × 100 / 1 = 500}}, and bar/bar cancels out, so {{nowrap|1=5 bar = 500 kPa}}.

== Dimensional homogeneity ==
{{See also|Apples and oranges}}
The most basic rule of dimensional analysis is that of dimensional homogeneity.&lt;ref&gt;John Cimbala and Yunus Cengel (2006), ''Essential of Fluid Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications'', McGraw-Hill. Chapter 7: "Dimensional Analysis and Modeling", Section 7-2: "Dimensional homogeneity" [http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/0073138355/student_view0/chapter7/]&lt;/ref&gt; Only commensurable quantities (physical quantities having the same dimension) may be ''compared,'' ''equated,'' ''added,'' or ''subtracted.''
However, the dimensions form an [[abelian group]] under multiplication, so:
:One may take ''ratios'' of ''incommensurable'' quantities (quantities with different dimensions), and ''multiply'' or ''divide'' them.

For example, it makes no sense to ask whether 1 hour is more, the same, or less than 1 kilometer, as these have different dimensions, nor to add 1 hour to 1 kilometer.  However, it makes perfect sense to ask whether 1 mile is more, the same, or less than 1 kilometer being the same dimension of physical quantity even though the units are different. On the other hand, if an object travels 100&amp;nbsp;km in 2 hours, one may divide these and conclude that the object's average speed was 50&amp;nbsp;km/h.

The rule implies that in a physically meaningful ''expression'' only quantities of the same dimension can be added, subtracted, or compared. For example, if ''m''&lt;sub&gt;man&lt;/sub&gt;, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;rat&lt;/sub&gt; and ''L''&lt;sub&gt;man&lt;/sub&gt; denote, respectively, the mass of some man, the mass of a rat and the length of that man, the dimensionally homogeneous expression {{nowrap|''m''&lt;sub&gt;man&lt;/sub&gt; + ''m''&lt;sub&gt;rat&lt;/sub&gt;}} is meaningful, but the heterogeneous expression {{nowrap|''m''&lt;sub&gt;man&lt;/sub&gt; + ''L''&lt;sub&gt;man&lt;/sub&gt;}} is meaningless. However, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;man&lt;/sub&gt;/''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;man&lt;/sub&gt; is fine. Thus, dimensional analysis may be used as a [[sanity check]] of physical equations: the two sides of any equation must be commensurable or have the same dimensions.

Even when two physical quantities have identical dimensions, it may nevertheless be meaningless to compare or add them. For example, although [[torque]] and [[energy]] share the dimension {{dimanalysis|length=2|mass=1|time=−2}}, they are fundamentally different physical quantities.

To compare, add, or subtract quantities with the same dimensions but expressed in different units, the standard procedure is first to convert them all to the same units. For example, to compare 32 [[metre]]s with 35 [[yard]]s, use 1 yard = 0.9144&amp;nbsp;m to convert 35 yards to 32.004&amp;nbsp;m.

A related principle is that any physical law that accurately describes the real world must be independent of the units used to measure the physical variables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Frits J. |last=de Jong|first2=Wilhelm |last2=Quade|title=Dimensional analysis for economists|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F5BRAAAAMAAJ|year=1967|publisher=North Holland |page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, [[Newton's laws of motion]] must hold true whether distance is measured in miles or kilometers.  This principle gives rise to the form that conversion factors must take between units that measure the same dimension: multiplication by a simple constant.  It also ensures equivalence; for example, if two buildings are the same height in feet, then they must be the same height in meters.

== The factor-label method for converting units ==

The factor-label method is the sequential application of conversion factors expressed as fractions and arranged so that any dimensional unit appearing in both the numerator and denominator of any of the fractions can be cancelled out until only the desired set of dimensional units is obtained. For example, 10 [[miles per hour]] can be converted to [[meters per second]] by using a sequence of conversion factors as shown below:

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{10\ \cancel{\text{mile}}}{1\ \cancel{\text{hour}}} \times \frac{1609.344\text{ meter}}{1\ \cancel{\text{mile}}} \times \frac{1\ \cancel{\text{hour}}}{3600\text{ second}} = 4.4704\ \frac{\text{meter}}{\text{second}}. &lt;/math&gt;

It can be seen that each conversion factor is equivalent to the value of one. For example, starting with 1 mile = 1609.344 meters and dividing both sides of the equation by 1 mile yields 1 mile / 1 mile = 1609.344 meters / 1 mile, which when simplified yields 1 = 1609.344 meters / 1 mile.

So, when the units ''mile'' and ''hour'' are cancelled out and the arithmetic is done, 10 miles per hour converts to 4.4704 meters per second.

As a more complex example, the [[concentration]] of [[nitrogen oxides]] (i.e., [[NOx|&lt;math chem&gt;\color{Blue}\ce{NO}_x&lt;/math&gt;]]) in the [[flue gas]] from an industrial [[furnace]] can be converted to a [[mass flow rate]] expressed in grams per hour (i.e., g/h) of &lt;math chem&gt;\ce{NO}_x&lt;/math&gt; by using the following information as shown below:

; NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; concentration := 10 [[parts per notation|parts per million]] by volume = 10 ppmv = 10 volumes/10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; volumes
; NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; molar mass := 46&amp;nbsp;kg/kmol = 46&amp;nbsp;g/mol
; Flow rate of flue gas := 20 cubic meters per minute = 20 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/min
: The flue gas exits the furnace at 0 °C temperature and 101.325 kPa absolute pressure.
: The [[standard conditions of temperature and pressure#Molar volume of a gas|molar volume]] of a gas at 0 °C temperature and 101.325 kPa is 22.414 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/[[kmol]].

:&lt;math chem&gt;
\frac{10\ \cancel{\ce{m}^3\ \ce{NO}_x}}{10^6\ \cancel{\ce{m}^3\ \ce{gas}}} \times
\frac{20\ \cancel{\ce{m}^3\ \ce{gas}}}{1\ \cancel{\ce{minute}}} \times
\frac{60\ \cancel{\ce{minute}}}{1\ \ce{hour}} \times
\frac{1\ \cancel{\ce{kmol\ NO}_x}}{22.414\ \cancel{\ce{m}^3\ \ce{NO}_x}} \times
\frac{46\ \cancel{\ce{kg\ NO}_x}}{1\ \cancel{\ce{kmol\ NO}_x}} \times
\frac{1000\ \ce{g\ NO}_x}{1 \cancel{\ce{kg\ NO}_x}} =
24.63\ \frac{\ce{g\ NO}_x}{\ce{hour}}
&lt;/math&gt;

After canceling out any dimensional units that appear both in the numerators and denominators of the fractions in the above equation, the NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; concentration of 10 ppm&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; converts to mass flow rate of 24.63&amp;nbsp;grams per hour.

=== Checking equations that involve dimensions ===
The factor-label method can also be used on any mathematical equation to check whether or not the dimensional units on the left hand side of the equation are the same as the dimensional units on the right hand side of the equation. Having the same units on both sides of an equation does not ensure that the equation is correct, but having different units on the two sides (when expressed in terms of base units) of an equation implies that the equation is wrong.

For example, check the [[Gas Laws|Universal Gas Law]] equation of {{nowrap|1=''PV'' = ''nRT''}}, when:
* the pressure ''P'' is in pascals (Pa)
* the volume ''V'' is in cubic meters (m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)
* the amount of substance ''n'' is in moles (mol)
* the [[Gas constant|universal gas law constant ''R'']] is 8.3145 Pa⋅m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/(mol⋅K)
* the temperature ''T'' is in kelvins (K)

:&lt;math chem&gt;\ce{Pa.m^3} = \frac{\cancel{\ce{mol}}}{1} \times
\frac{\ce{Pa.m^3}}{\cancel{\ce{mol}}\ \cancel{\ce{K}}} \times \frac{\cancel{\ce{K}}}{1}
&lt;/math&gt;

As can be seen, when the dimensional units appearing in the numerator and denominator of the equation's right hand side are cancelled out, both sides of the equation have the same dimensional units.

=== Limitations ===
The factor-label method can convert only unit quantities for which the units are in a linear relationship intersecting at 0. Most units fit this paradigm. An example for which it cannot be used is the conversion between [[degrees Celsius]] and [[kelvin]]s (or [[degrees Fahrenheit]]). Between degrees Celsius and kelvins, there is a constant difference rather than a constant ratio, while between degrees Celsius and degrees Fahrenheit there is neither a constant difference nor a constant ratio. There is, however, an [[affine transform]] (&lt;math&gt;x \mapsto ax+b&lt;/math&gt;, rather than a [[linear transform]] &lt;math&gt;x \mapsto ax&lt;/math&gt;) between them.

For example, the freezing point of water is 0&amp;nbsp;°C and 32&amp;nbsp;°F, and a 5&amp;nbsp;°C change is the same as a 9&amp;nbsp;°F change. Thus, to convert from units of Fahrenheit to units of Celsius, one subtracts 32&amp;nbsp;°F (the offset from the point of reference), divides by 9&amp;nbsp;°F and multiplies by 5&amp;nbsp;°C (scales by the ratio of units), and adds 0&amp;nbsp;°C (the offset from the point of reference). Reversing this yields the formula for obtaining a quantity in units of Celsius from units of Fahrenheit; one could have started with the equivalence between 100&amp;nbsp;°C and 212&amp;nbsp;°F, though this would yield the same formula at the end.

Hence, to convert the numerical quantity value of a temperature ''T''[F] in degrees Fahrenheit to a numerical quantity value ''T''[C] in degrees Celsius, this formula may be used:

:''T''[C] = (''T''[F] − 32) × 5/9.

To convert ''T''[C] in degrees Celsius to ''T''[F] in degrees Fahrenheit, this formula may be used:

:''T''[F] = (''T''[C] × 9/5) + 32.

== Applications ==
Dimensional analysis is most often used in physics and chemistry – and in the mathematics thereof – but finds some applications outside of those fields as well.

=== Mathematics ===
A simple application of dimensional analysis to mathematics is in computing the form of the [[N-sphere#Volume of the n-ball|volume of an ''n''-ball]] (the solid ball in ''n'' dimensions), or the area of its surface, the [[n-sphere|''n''-sphere]]: being an ''n''-dimensional figure, the volume scales as &lt;math&gt;x^n,&lt;/math&gt; while the surface area, being &lt;math&gt;(n-1)&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional, scales as &lt;math&gt;x^{n-1}.&lt;/math&gt; Thus the volume of the ''n''-ball in terms of the radius is &lt;math&gt;C_nr^n,&lt;/math&gt; for some constant &lt;math&gt;C_n.&lt;/math&gt; Determining the constant takes more involved mathematics, but the form can be deduced and checked by dimensional analysis alone.

=== Finance, economics, and accounting ===
In finance, economics, and accounting, dimensional analysis is most commonly referred to in terms of the [[Stock and flow|distinction between stocks and flows]]. More generally, dimensional analysis is used in interpreting various [[financial ratios]], economics ratios, and accounting ratios.
* For example, the [[P/E ratio]] has dimensions of time (units of years), and can be interpreted as "years of earnings to earn the price paid".
* In economics, [[debt-to-GDP ratio]] also has units of years (debt has units of currency, GDP has units of currency/year).
* More surprisingly, [[bond duration]] also has units of years, which can be shown by dimensional analysis, but takes some financial intuition to understand.
* [[Velocity of money]] has units of 1/years (GDP/money supply has units of currency/year over currency): how often a unit of currency circulates per year.
* Interest rates are often expressed as a percentage, but more properly percent per annum, which has dimensions of 1/years.

=== Fluid mechanics ===
In fluid mechanics, dimensional analysis is performed in order to obtain dimensionless [[Buckingham π theorem|Pi terms]] or groups. According to the principles of dimensional analysis, any prototype can be described by a series of these terms or groups that describe the behaviour of the system. Using suitable Pi terms or groups, it is possible to develop a similar set of Pi terms for a model that has the same dimensional relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Waite |first1=Lee |last2=Fine |first2=Jerry |title=Applied Biofluid Mechanics |date=2007 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |isbn=978-0-07-147217-3 |page=260 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, Pi terms provide a shortcut to developing a model representing a certain prototype. Common dimensionless groups in fluid mechanics include:

* [[Reynolds number]] (Re), generally important in all types of fluid problems:
*: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Re} = \frac{\rho\,Vd}{\mu}&lt;/math&gt;.
* [[Froude number]] (Fr), modeling flow with a free surface:
*: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Fr} = \frac{V}{\sqrt{g\,L}}.&lt;/math&gt;
* [[Euler number (physics)|Euler number]] (Eu), used in problems in which pressure is of interest:
*: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Eu} = \frac{\Delta p}{\rho V^2}.&lt;/math&gt;
* [[Mach number]] (M), important high speed flows where the velocity approaches or exceeds the local speed of sound:
*: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{M} = \frac{V}{c},&lt;/math&gt; where: {{mvar|c}} is the local speed of sound.

== History ==
The origins of dimensional analysis have been disputed by historians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Macagno |first=Enzo O. |title=Historico-critical review of dimensional analysis |journal=Journal of the Franklin Institute |volume=292 |issue=6 |pages=391–40 |year=1971 |doi= 10.1016/0016-0032(71)90160-8|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0016003271901608}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Martins 1981"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Martins |first=Roberto De A. |title=The origin of dimensional analysis |journal=Journal of the Franklin Institute |volume=311 |issue=5 |pages=331–7 |year=1981 |doi= 10.1016/0016-0032(81)90475-0|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0016003271901608}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 19th-century French mathematician [[Joseph Fourier]] is generally credited with having made important contributions&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Mason |first=Stephen Finney |title=A history of the sciences |publisher=Collier Books |location=New York |year=1962 |page=169 |isbn=978-0-02-093400-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; based on the idea that physical laws like [[Newton's second law|{{nowrap|1=''F'' = ''ma''}}]] should be independent of the units employed to measure the physical variables. This led to the conclusion that meaningful laws must be homogeneous equations in their various units of measurement, a result which was eventually formalized in the [[Buckingham π theorem]]. However, the first application of dimensional analysis has been credited to the Italian scholar [[François Daviet de Foncenex]] (1734–1799). It was published in 1761, 61 years before the publication of Fourier's work.&lt;ref name="Martins 1981"/&gt;

[[James Clerk Maxwell]] played a major role in establishing modern use of dimensional analysis by distinguishing mass, length, and time as fundamental units, while referring to other units as derived.&lt;ref name="maxwell"&gt;{{Citation |last=Roche |first=John J |title=The Mathematics of Measurement: A Critical History |publisher=Springer |year=1998 |page=203 |isbn=978-0-387-91581-4 |quote=[https://books.google.com/books?id=eiQOqS-Q6EkC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=ISBN978-0387915814&amp;pg=PA203#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Beginning apparently with Maxwell, mass, length and time began to be interpreted as having a privileged fundamental character and all other quantities as derivative, not merely with respect to measurement, but with respect to their physical status as well.]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Maxwell defined length, time and mass to be "the three fundamental units", he also noted that gravitational mass can be derived from length and time by assuming a form of [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]] in which the [[gravitational constant]] ''G'' is taken as unity, thereby defining {{nowrap|1=M = L&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;T&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;ref name="maxwell2"&gt;{{Citation |last=Maxwell |first=James Clerk |title=A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism |year=1873 |page=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By assuming a form of [[Coulomb's law]] in which [[Coulomb's constant]] ''k''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is taken as unity, Maxwell then determined that the dimensions of an electrostatic unit of charge were {{nowrap|1=Q = L&lt;sup&gt;3/2&lt;/sup&gt;M&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;T&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}},&lt;ref name="maxwell3"&gt;{{Citation |last=Maxwell |first=James Clerk |title=A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism |year=1873 |page=45 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which, after substituting his {{nowrap|1=M = L&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;T&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;}} equation for mass, results in charge having the same dimensions as mass, viz. {{nowrap|1=Q = L&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;T&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

Dimensional analysis is also used to derive relationships between the physical quantities that are involved in a particular phenomenon that one wishes to understand and characterize.  It was used for the first time {{harv|Pesic|2005}} in this way in 1872 by [[Lord Rayleigh]], who was trying to understand why the sky is blue.  Rayleigh first published the technique in his 1877 book ''The Theory of Sound''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Baron John William Strutt |last=Rayleigh |title=The Theory of Sound|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kvxYAAAAYAAJ|year=1877|publisher=Macmillan }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original meaning of the word ''dimension'', in Fourier's ''Theorie de la Chaleur'', was the numerical value of the exponents of the base units. For example, acceleration was considered to have the dimension 1 with respect to the unit of length, and the dimension −2 with respect to the unit of time.{{sfnp|Fourier |1822 |page=[https://books.google.com/?id=TDQJAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA156 156]}} This was slightly changed by Maxwell, who said the dimensions of acceleration are LT&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;, instead of just the exponents.&lt;ref name="maxwell4"&gt;{{Citation |last=Maxwell |first=James Clerk |title=A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism, volume 1 |year=1873 |page=5 |url=https://archive.org/stream/electricandmagne01maxwrich#page/n41/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mathematical examples ==
The [[Buckingham π theorem]] describes how every physically meaningful equation involving ''n'' variables can be equivalently rewritten as an equation of {{nowrap|''n'' − ''m''}} dimensionless parameters, where ''m'' is the rank of the dimensional matrix. Furthermore, and most importantly, it provides a method for computing these dimensionless parameters from the given variables.

A dimensional equation can have the dimensions reduced or eliminated through [[nondimensionalization]], which begins with dimensional analysis, and involves scaling quantities by [[characteristic units]] of a system or [[natural units]] of nature. This gives insight into the fundamental properties of the system, as illustrated in the examples below.

=== Definition ===
The dimension of a [[physical quantity]] can be expressed as a product of the basic physical dimensions such as [[length]], [[mass]] and [[time]], each raised to a [[Rational number|rational]] [[Exponentiation|power]]. The ''dimension'' of a physical quantity is more fundamental than some ''scale'' [[units of measurement|unit]] used to express the amount of that physical quantity.  For example, ''mass'' is a dimension, while the [[kilogram]] is a particular scale unit chosen to express a quantity of mass. Except for [[natural units]], the choice of scale is cultural and arbitrary.

There are many possible choices of basic physical dimensions. The [[International System of Units|SI standard]] recommends the usage of the following dimensions and corresponding symbols: [[length]] (L), [[mass]] (M), [[time]] (T), [[electric current]] (I), [[absolute temperature]] (Θ), [[amount of substance]] (N) and [[luminous intensity]] (J). The symbols are by convention usually written in [[roman type|roman]] [[sans serif]] typeface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = SI Brochure (8th edition). Section 1.3: Dimensions of quantities | url = http://www.bipm.org/en/si/si_brochure/chapter1/1-3.html | publisher = [[BIPM]] | accessdate = 2013-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mathematically, the dimension of the quantity ''Q'' is given by 
:&lt;math&gt;\text{dim}~{Q} = \mathsf{L}^a\mathsf{M}^b\mathsf{T}^c\mathsf{I}^d\mathsf{\Theta}^e\mathsf{N}^f\mathsf{J}^g&lt;/math&gt;
where ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d'', ''e'', ''f'', ''g'' are the dimensional exponents. Other physical quantities could be defined as the base quantities, as long as they form a [[linearly independent]] [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]]. For instance, one could replace the dimension of [[electrical current]] (I) of the SI basis with a dimension of [[electric charge]] (Q), since Q = IT.

As examples, the dimension of the physical quantity [[speed]] ''v'' is
:&lt;math&gt;\text{dim}~v = \frac{\text{length}}{\text{time}} = \frac{\mathsf{L}}{\mathsf{T}} = \mathsf{LT}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;
and the dimension of the physical quantity [[force (physics)|force]] ''F'' is
:&lt;math&gt;\text{dim}~F = \text{mass} \times \text{acceleration} = \text{mass} \times \frac{\text{length}}{\text{time}^2} = \frac{\mathsf{ML}}{\mathsf{T}^2} = \mathsf{MLT}^{-2}&lt;/math&gt;

The unit chosen to express a physical quantity and its dimension are related, but not identical concepts. The units of a physical quantity are defined by convention and related to some standard; e.g., length may have units of metres, feet, inches, miles or micrometres; but any length always has a dimension of L, no matter what units of length are chosen to express it. Two different units of the same physical quantity have [[conversion of units|conversion factors]] that relate them. For example, 1&amp;nbsp;[[inch|in]] = 2.54&amp;nbsp;[[centimetre|cm]]; in this case (2.54&amp;nbsp;cm/in) is the conversion factor, which is itself dimensionless. Therefore, multiplying by that conversion factor does not change the dimensions of a physical quantity.

There are also physicists that have cast doubt on the very existence of incompatible fundamental dimensions of physical quantity,&lt;ref name="duff"&gt;{{Citation |last1=Duff |first1=M.J. |last2=Okun |first2=L.B. |last3=Veneziano |first3=G. |title=Trialogue on the number of fundamental constants |journal=Journal of High Energy Physics |volume=03 |page=023 |date=September 2002 |doi=10.1088/1126-6708/2002/03/023 |arxiv=physics/0110060|bibcode = 2002JHEP...03..023D |issue=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although this does not invalidate the usefulness of dimensional analysis.

=== Mathematical properties ===
{{Main article|Buckingham π theorem}}

The dimensions that can be formed from a given collection of basic physical dimensions, such as M, L, and T, form an [[abelian group]]: The identity is written as 1; {{nowrap|1=L&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = 1}}, and the inverse to L is 1/L or L&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. L raised to any rational power ''p'' is a member of the group, having an inverse of L&lt;sup&gt;−''p''&lt;/sup&gt; or 1/L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;.  The operation of the group is multiplication, having the usual rules for handling exponents ({{nowrap|1=L&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; × L&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; = L&lt;sup&gt;''n''+''m''&lt;/sup&gt;}}).

This group can be described as a [[vector space]] over the rational numbers, with for example dimensional symbol M&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;''j''&lt;/sup&gt;T&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; corresponding to the vector {{nowrap|(''i'', ''j'', ''k'')}}. When physical measured quantities (be they like-dimensioned or unlike-dimensioned) are multiplied or divided by one other, their dimensional units are likewise multiplied or divided; this corresponds to addition or subtraction in the vector space. When measurable quantities are raised to a rational power, the same is done to the dimensional symbols attached to those quantities; this corresponds to [[scalar multiplication]] in the vector space.

A basis for such a vector space of dimensional symbols is called a set of [[Base quantity|base quantities]], and all other vectors are called derived units. As in any vector space, one may choose different [[Basis (linear algebra)|bases]], which yields different systems of units (e.g., [[ampere#Proposed future definition|choosing]] whether the unit for charge is derived from the unit for current, or vice versa).

The group identity 1, the dimension of dimensionless quantities, corresponds to the origin in this vector space.

The set of units of the physical quantities involved in a problem correspond to a set of vectors (or a matrix). The [[Kernel (linear algebra)#nullity|nullity]] describes some number (e.g., ''m'') of ways in which these vectors can be combined to produce a zero vector. These correspond to producing (from the measurements) a number of dimensionless quantities, {π&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., π&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;}. (In fact these ways completely span the null subspace of another different space, of powers of the measurements.) Every possible way of multiplying (and [[Exponent (mathematics)|exponentiating]]) together the measured quantities to produce something with the same units as some derived quantity ''X'' can be expressed in the general form

:&lt;math&gt;X = \prod_{i=1}^m (\pi_i)^{k_i}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Consequently, every possible [[dimensional analysis#Commensurability|commensurate]] equation for the physics of the system can be rewritten in the form

:&lt;math&gt;f(\pi_1,\pi_2, ..., \pi_m)=0\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Knowing this restriction can be a powerful tool for obtaining new insight into the system.

The dimension of physical quantities of interest in [[mechanics]] can be expressed in terms of base dimensions M, L, and T – these form a 3-dimensional vector space. This is not the only valid choice of base dimensions, but it is the one most commonly used. For example, one might choose force, length and mass as the base dimensions (as some have done), with associated dimensions F, L, M; this corresponds to a different basis, and one may convert between these representations by a [[change of basis]]. The choice of the base set of dimensions is thus a convention, with the benefit of increased utility and familiarity. The choice of base dimensions is not arbitrary, because the dimensions must form a basis: they must [[Linear span|span]] the space, and be [[linearly independent]].

For example, F, L, M form a set of fundamental dimensions because they form a basis that is equivalent to M, L, T: the former can be expressed as [F = ML/T&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;], L, M, while the latter can be expressed as M, L, [T = (ML/F)&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;].

On the other hand, length, velocity and time {{nowrap|(L, V, T)}} do not form a set of as base dimensions, for two reasons:
* There is no way to obtain mass – or anything derived from it, such as force – without introducing another base dimension (thus, they do not ''span the space'').
* Velocity, being expressible in terms of length and time (V = L/T), is redundant (the set is not ''linearly independent'').

=== Other fields of physics and chemistry ===
Depending on the field of physics, it may be advantageous to choose one or another extended set of dimensional symbols. In electromagnetism, for example, it may be useful to use dimensions of M, L, T, and Q, where Q represents the dimension of [[electric charge]].  In [[thermodynamics]], the base set of dimensions is often extended to include a dimension for temperature, Θ.  In chemistry, the [[amount of substance]] (the number of molecules divided by the [[Avogadro constant]], ≈ {{val|6.02|e=23|u=mol-1}}) is defined as a base dimension, N, as well.
In the interaction of [[relativistic plasma]] with strong laser pulses, a dimensionless [[relativistic similarity parameter]], connected with the symmetry properties of the collisionless [[Vlasov equation]], is constructed from the plasma-, electron- and critical-densities in addition to the electromagnetic vector potential. The choice of the dimensions or even the number of dimensions to be used in different fields of physics is to some extent arbitrary, but consistency in use and ease of communications are common and necessary features.

=== Polynomials and transcendental functions ===
[[Scalar (physics)|Scalar]] arguments to [[transcendental function]]s such as [[Exponential function|exponential]], [[Trigonometric function|trigonometric]] and [[logarithm]]ic functions, or to [[inhomogeneous polynomials]], must be [[dimensionless number|dimensionless quantities]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}  (Note: this requirement is somewhat relaxed in Siano's orientational analysis described below, in which the square of certain dimensioned quantities are dimensionless.)

&lt;!--see discussion page/transcendental functions This requirement is clear when one observes the [[Taylor expansion]]s for these functions (a sum of various powers of the function argument). For example, the logarithm of 3&amp;nbsp;kg is undefined even though the logarithm of&amp;nbsp;3 is nearly&amp;nbsp;0.477. An attempt to compute ln&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;kg would produce, if one naively took ln&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;kg to mean the dimensionally meaningless "ln&amp;nbsp;(1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;kg)",

: &lt;math&gt;2\,\mathrm{kg} - \frac{4\,\mathrm{kg}^2}{2} + \cdots&lt;/math&gt;

which is dimensionally incompatible – the sum has no meaningful dimension – requiring the argument of transcendental functions to be dimensionless.

Another way to understand this problem is that the different coefficients ''scale'' differently under change of units – were one to reconsider this in grams as "ln&amp;nbsp;3000&amp;nbsp;g" instead of "ln&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;kg", one could compute ln&amp;nbsp;3000, but in terms of the Taylor series, the degree 1 term would scale by 1000, the degree-2 term would scale by 1000&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and so forth – the overall output would not scale as a particular dimension.
--&gt;
While most mathematical identities about dimensionless numbers translate in a straightforward manner to dimensional quantities, care must be taken with logarithms of ratios: the identity log(a/b) = log a − log b, where the logarithm is taken in any base, holds for dimensionless numbers a and b, but it does ''not'' hold if a and b are dimensional, because in this case the left-hand side is well-defined but the right-hand side is not.

Similarly, while one can evaluate [[monomials]] (''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;) of dimensional quantities, one cannot evaluate polynomials of mixed degree with dimensionless coefficients on dimensional quantities: for ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the expression (3&amp;nbsp;m)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;9&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; makes sense (as an area), while for ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''x'', the expression (3&amp;nbsp;m)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;m&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;9&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;m does not make sense.

However, polynomials of mixed degree can make sense if the coefficients are suitably chosen physical quantities that are not dimensionless.  For example,

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{2} \cdot \left(-32\frac{\text{foot}}{\text{second}^2}\right) \cdot t^2 + \left(500\frac{\text{foot}}{\text{second}}\right) \cdot t. &lt;/math&gt;

This is the height to which an object rises in time&amp;nbsp;''t'' if the acceleration of gravity is 32&amp;nbsp;feet&amp;nbsp;per&amp;nbsp;second&amp;nbsp;per&amp;nbsp;second and the initial upward speed is 500&amp;nbsp;feet&amp;nbsp;per&amp;nbsp;second.  It is not even necessary for ''t'' to be in ''seconds''.  For example, suppose ''t''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.01&amp;nbsp;minutes.  Then the first term would be

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
      &amp;\frac{1}{2} \cdot \left(-32\frac{\text{foot}}{\text{second}^2}\right) \cdot (0.01 \text{ minute})^2 \\[10pt]
  ={} &amp;\frac{1}{2} \cdot -32 \cdot \left(0.01^2\right) \left(\frac{\text{minute}}{\text{second}}\right)^2 \cdot \text{foot} \\[10pt]
  ={} &amp;\frac{1}{2} \cdot -32 \cdot \left(0.01^2\right) \cdot 60^2 \cdot \text{foot}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Incorporating units ===
The value of a dimensional physical quantity ''Z'' is written as the product of a [[Units of measurement|unit]] [''Z''] within the dimension and a dimensionless numerical factor, ''n''.&lt;ref name=Pisanty13&gt;For a review of the different conventions in use see: {{cite web |url=http://physics.stackexchange.com/q/77690 |title=Square bracket notation for dimensions and units: usage and conventions |last1=Pisanty |first1= E|date=2013-09-17 |website=Physics Stack Exchange  |accessdate=2014-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;Z = n \times [Z] = n [Z]&lt;/math&gt;

When like-dimensioned quantities are added or subtracted or compared, it is convenient to express them in consistent units so that the numerical values of these quantities may be directly added or subtracted. But, in concept, there is no problem adding quantities of the same dimension expressed in different units. For example, 1 meter added to 1 foot is a length, but one cannot derive that length by simply adding 1 and 1. A [[Conversion of units|conversion factor]], which is a ratio of like-dimensioned quantities and is equal to the dimensionless unity, is needed:

:&lt;math&gt; 1 \ \mbox{ft} = 0.3048 \ \mbox{m} \ &lt;/math&gt;  is identical to &lt;math&gt; 1 = \frac{0.3048 \ \mbox{m}}{1 \ \mbox{ft}}.\ &lt;/math&gt;

The factor &lt;math&gt; 0.3048 \ \frac{\mbox{m}}{\mbox{ft}} &lt;/math&gt; is identical to the dimensionless 1, so multiplying by this conversion factor changes nothing. Then when adding two quantities of like dimension, but expressed in different units, the appropriate conversion factor, which is essentially the dimensionless 1, is used to convert the quantities to identical units so that their numerical values can be added or subtracted.

Only in this manner is it meaningful to speak of adding like-dimensioned quantities of differing units.

=== Position vs displacement ===
{{Main article|Affine space}}
Some discussions of dimensional analysis implicitly describe all quantities as mathematical vectors. (In mathematics scalars are considered a special case of vectors{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}; vectors can be added to or subtracted from other vectors, and, inter alia, multiplied or divided by scalars. If a vector is used to define a position, this assumes an implicit point of reference: an [[origin (mathematics)|origin]]. While this is useful and often perfectly adequate, allowing many important errors to be caught, it can fail to model certain aspects of physics. A more rigorous approach requires distinguishing between position and displacement (or moment in time versus duration, or absolute temperature versus temperature change).

Consider points on a line, each with a position with respect to a given origin, and distances among them. Positions and displacements all have units of length, but their meaning is not interchangeable:
* adding two displacements should yield a new displacement (walking ten paces then twenty paces gets you thirty paces forward),
* adding a displacement to a position should yield a new position (walking one block down the street from an intersection gets you to the next intersection),
* subtracting two positions should yield a displacement,
* but one may ''not'' add two positions.
This illustrates the subtle distinction between ''affine'' quantities (ones modeled by an [[affine space]], such as position) and ''vector'' quantities (ones modeled by a [[vector space]], such as displacement).
* Vector quantities may be added to each other, yielding a new vector quantity, and a vector quantity may be added to a suitable affine quantity (a vector space ''[[group action|acts on]]'' an affine space), yielding a new affine quantity.
* Affine quantities cannot be added, but may be subtracted, yielding ''relative'' quantities which are vectors, and these ''relative differences'' may then be added to each other or to an affine quantity.

Properly then, positions have dimension of ''affine'' length, while displacements have dimension of ''vector'' length. To assign a number to an ''affine'' unit, one must not only choose a unit of measurement, but also a [[Origin (mathematics)|point of reference]], while to assign a number to a ''vector'' unit only requires a unit of measurement.

Thus some physical quantities are better modeled by vectorial quantities while others tend to require affine representation, and the distinction is reflected in their dimensional analysis.

This distinction is particularly important in the case of temperature, for which the numeric value of [[absolute zero]] is not the origin 0 in some scales. For absolute zero,
: 0 K = −273.15 °C = −459.67 °F = 0 °R,
but for temperature differences,
: 1 K = 1 °C ≠ 1 °F = 1 °R.
(Here °R refers to the [[Rankine scale]], not the [[Réaumur scale]]).
Unit conversion for temperature differences is simply a matter of multiplying by, e.g., 1&amp;nbsp;°F / 1 K (although the ratio is not a constant value). But because some of these scales have origins that do not correspond to absolute zero, conversion from one temperature scale to another requires accounting for that. As a result, simple dimensional analysis can lead to errors if it is ambiguous whether 1 K means the absolute temperature equal to −272.15&amp;nbsp;°C, or the temperature difference equal to 1&amp;nbsp;°C.

=== Orientation and frame of reference ===
Similar to the issue of a point of reference is the issue of orientation: a displacement in 2 or 3 dimensions is not just a length, but is a length together with a ''direction''. (This issue does not arise in 1 dimension, or rather is equivalent to the distinction between positive and negative.) Thus, to compare or combine two dimensional quantities in a multi-dimensional space, one also needs an orientation: they need to be compared to a [[frame of reference]].

This leads to the [[#Extensions|extensions]] discussed below, namely Huntley's directed dimensions and Siano's orientational analysis.

== Examples ==

=== A simple example: period of a harmonic oscillator ===
What is the period of [[Harmonic oscillator|oscillation]] {{mvar|T}} of a mass {{mvar|m}} attached to an ideal linear spring with spring constant {{mvar|k}} suspended in gravity of strength {{mvar|g}}? That period is the solution for {{mvar|T}} of some dimensionless equation in the variables {{mvar|T}}, {{mvar|m}}, {{mvar|k}}, and {{mvar|g}}.
The four quantities have the following dimensions:  {{mvar|T}}  [T];  {{mvar|m}}  [M]; {{mvar|k}} [M/T&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]; and  {{mvar|g}} [L/T&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]. From these we can form only one dimensionless product of powers of our chosen variables, &lt;math&gt;G_1&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;T^2 k/m&lt;/math&gt; {{nowrap|1=[T&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; · M/T&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; / M = 1]}}, and putting &lt;math&gt;G_1 = C&lt;/math&gt; for some dimensionless constant {{mvar|C}} gives the dimensionless equation sought.  The dimensionless product of powers of variables is sometimes referred to as a dimensionless group of variables; here the term "group" means "collection" rather than mathematical [[Group (mathematics)|group]].  They are often called [[dimensionless number]]s as well.

Note that the variable {{mvar|g}} does not occur in the group. It is easy to see that it is impossible to form a dimensionless product of powers that combines {{mvar|g}} with {{mvar|k}}, {{mvar|m}}, and {{mvar|T}}, because {{mvar|g}} is the only quantity that involves the dimension L. This implies that in this problem the {{mvar|g}} is irrelevant. Dimensional analysis can sometimes yield strong statements about the ''irrelevance'' of some quantities in a problem, or the need for additional parameters. If we have chosen enough variables to properly describe the problem, then from this argument we can conclude that the period of the mass on the spring is independent of {{mvar|g}}: it is the same on the earth or the moon. The equation demonstrating the existence of a product of powers for our problem can be written in an entirely equivalent way:  &lt;math&gt;T = \kappa \sqrt\tfrac{m}{k}&lt;/math&gt;, for some dimensionless constant κ (equal to &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{C}&lt;/math&gt; from the original dimensionless equation).

When faced with a case where dimensional analysis rejects a variable ({{mvar|g}}, here) that one intuitively expects to belong in a physical description of the situation, another possibility is that the rejected variable is in fact relevant, but that some other relevant variable has been omitted, which might combine with the rejected variable to form a dimensionless quantity. That is, however, not the case here.

When dimensional analysis yields only one dimensionless group, as here, there are no unknown functions, and the solution is said to be "complete" – although it still may involve unknown dimensionless constants, such as {{mvar|κ}}.

=== A more complex example: energy of a vibrating wire ===
Consider the case of a vibrating wire of [[length]] ''ℓ'' (L) vibrating with an [[amplitude]] ''A'' (L).  The wire has a [[linear density]] ''ρ'' (M/L) and is under [[Tension (physics)|tension]] ''s'' (ML/T&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), and we want to know the [[energy]] ''E'' (ML&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/T&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) in the wire.  Let ''π''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''π''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; be two dimensionless products of [[Power (mathematics)|powers]] of the variables chosen, given by
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \pi_1 &amp;= \frac{E}{As} \\
  \pi_2 &amp;= \frac{\ell}{A}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The linear density of the wire is not involved. The two groups found can be combined into an equivalent form as an equation
:&lt;math&gt;F\left(\frac{E}{As}, \frac{\ell}{A}\right) = 0 ,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''F'' is some unknown function, or, equivalently as
:&lt;math&gt;E = As f\left(\frac{\ell}{A}\right) ,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''f'' is some other unknown function.  Here the unknown function implies that our solution is now incomplete, but dimensional analysis has given us something that may not have been obvious: the energy is proportional to the first power of the tension.  Barring further analytical analysis, we might proceed to experiments to discover the form for the unknown function ''f''.  But our experiments are simpler than in the absence of dimensional analysis.  We'd perform none to verify that the energy is proportional to the tension.  Or perhaps we might guess that the energy is proportional to ''ℓ'', and so infer that {{nowrap|1=''E'' = ''ℓs''}}.  The power of dimensional analysis as an aid to experiment and forming hypotheses becomes evident.

The power of dimensional analysis really becomes apparent when it is applied to situations, unlike those given above, that are more complicated, the set of variables involved are not apparent, and the underlying equations hopelessly complex.  Consider, for example, a small pebble sitting on the bed of a river.  If the river flows fast enough, it will actually raise the pebble and cause it to flow along with the water.  At what critical velocity will this occur?  Sorting out the guessed variables is not so easy as before.  But dimensional analysis can be a powerful aid in understanding problems like this, and is usually the very first tool to be applied to complex problems where the underlying equations and constraints are poorly understood. In such cases, the answer may depend on a [[dimensionless number]] such as the [[Reynolds number]], which may be interpreted by dimensional analysis.

=== A third example: demand versus capacity for a rotating disc ===
Consider the case of a thin, solid, parallel-sided rotating disc of axial thickness ''t'' (L) and radius ''R'' (L).  The disc has a density ''ρ'' (M/L&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), rotates at an angular velocity ''ω'' (T&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) and this leads to a stress ''S'' (ML&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;T&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;) in the material.  There is a theoretical linear elastic solution, given by Lame, to this problem when the disc is thin relative to its radius, the faces of the disc are free to move axially, and the plane stress constitutive relations can be assumed to be valid.  As the disc becomes thicker relative to the radius then the plane stress solution breaks down.  If the disc is restrained axially on its free faces then a state of plane strain will occur.  However, if this is not the case then the state of stress may only be determined though consideration of three-dimensional elasticity and there is no known theoretical solution for this case.  An engineer might, therefore, be interested in establishing a relationship between the five variables.  Dimensional analysis for this case leads to the following (5&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2) non-dimensional groups:

: demand/capacity = ''ρR''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''ω''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/''S''
: thickness/radius or aspect ratio = ''t''/''R''

[[File:Dimensional analysis 01.jpg|thumb|Dimensional analysis and numerical experiments for a rotating disc]]

Through the use of numerical experiments using, for example, the finite element method, the nature of the relationship between the two non-dimensional groups can be obtained as shown in the figure.  As this problem only involves two non-dimensional groups, the complete picture is provided in a single plot and this can be used as a design/assessment chart for rotating discs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ramsay|first1=Angus|title=Dimensional Analysis and Numerical Experiments for a Rotating Disc|url=http://www.ramsay-maunder.co.uk/knowledge-base/technical-notes/dimensional-analysis--numerical-experiments-for-a-rotating-disc/|website=Ramsay Maunder Associates|accessdate=15 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Extensions ==

=== Huntley's extension: directed dimensions ===
Huntley {{harv|Huntley|1967}} has pointed out that it is sometimes productive to refine our concept of dimension. Two possible refinements are:
* The magnitude of the components of a vector are to be considered dimensionally distinct. For example, rather than an undifferentiated length dimension L, we may have L&lt;sub&gt;{{mvar|x}}&lt;/sub&gt; represent dimension in the x-direction, and so forth. This requirement stems ultimately from the requirement that each component of a physically meaningful equation (scalar, vector, or tensor) must be dimensionally consistent.
* Mass as a measure of quantity is to be considered dimensionally distinct from mass as a measure of inertia.

As an example of the usefulness of the first refinement, suppose we wish to calculate the [[trajectory#Range and height|distance a cannonball travels]] when fired with a vertical velocity component &lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{y}&lt;/math&gt; and a horizontal velocity component &lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{x}&lt;/math&gt;, assuming it is fired on a flat surface. Assuming no use of directed lengths, the quantities of interest are then &lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{x}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{y}&lt;/math&gt;, both dimensioned as LT&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, {{mvar|R}}, the distance travelled, having dimension L, and {{mvar|g}} the downward acceleration of gravity, with dimension LT&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;.

With these four quantities, we may conclude that the equation for the range {{mvar|R}} may be written:

:&lt;math&gt;R \propto V_\text{x}^a\,V_\text{y}^b\,g^c.\,&lt;/math&gt;

Or dimensionally

:&lt;math&gt;\mathsf{L} = \left(\frac{\mathsf{L}}{\mathsf{T}}\right)^{a+b} \left(\frac{\mathsf{L}}{\mathsf{T}^2}\right)^c\,&lt;/math&gt;

from which we may deduce that &lt;math&gt;a + b + c = 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a + b + 2c = 0&lt;/math&gt;, which leaves one exponent undetermined. This is to be expected since we have two fundamental dimensions L and T, and four parameters, with one equation.

If, however, we use directed length dimensions, then &lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{x}&lt;/math&gt; will be dimensioned as L&lt;sub&gt;{{math|x}}&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, &lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{y}&lt;/math&gt; as L&lt;sub&gt;{{math|y}}&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, {{mvar|R}} as L&lt;sub&gt;{{math|x}}&lt;/sub&gt; and {{mvar|g}} as L&lt;sub&gt;{{math|y}}&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;. The dimensional equation becomes:

:&lt;math&gt;
  \mathsf{L}_\mathrm{x} =
    \left(\frac{\mathsf{L}_\mathrm{x}}{\mathsf{T}}\right)^a
    \left(\frac{\mathsf{L}_\mathrm{y}}{\mathsf{T}}\right)^b 
    \left(\frac{\mathsf{L}_\mathrm{y}}{\mathsf{T}^2}\right)^c
&lt;/math&gt;

and we may solve completely as &lt;math&gt;a = 1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b = 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c = -1&lt;/math&gt;. The increase in deductive power gained by the use of directed length dimensions is apparent.

In a similar manner, it is sometimes found useful (e.g., in fluid mechanics and thermodynamics) to distinguish between mass as a measure of inertia (inertial mass), and mass as a measure of quantity (substantial mass). For example, consider the derivation of [[Poiseuille's Law]]. We wish to find the rate of mass flow of a viscous fluid through a circular pipe. Without drawing distinctions between inertial and substantial mass we may choose as the relevant variables
* &lt;math&gt;\dot{m}&lt;/math&gt; the mass flow rate with dimension MT&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;p_\text{x}&lt;/math&gt; the pressure gradient along the pipe with dimension ML&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;T&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;
* {{mvar|&amp;rho;}} the density with dimension ML&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;
* {{mvar|&amp;eta;}} the dynamic fluid viscosity with dimension ML&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;T&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;
* {{mvar|r}} the radius of the pipe with dimension L

There are three fundamental variables so the above five equations will yield two dimensionless variables which we may take to be &lt;math&gt;\pi_1 = \dot{m}/\eta r&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\pi_2 = p_\mathrm{x}\rho r^5/\dot{m}^2&lt;/math&gt; and we may express the dimensional equation as

:&lt;math&gt;C = \pi_1\pi_2^a = \left(\frac{\dot{m}}{\eta r}\right)\left(\frac{p_\mathrm{x}\rho r^5}{\dot{m}^2}\right)^a&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|C}} and {{mvar|a}} are undetermined constants. If we draw a distinction between inertial mass with dimension &lt;math&gt;M_\text{i}&lt;/math&gt; and substantial mass with dimension &lt;math&gt;M_\text{s}&lt;/math&gt;, then mass flow rate and density will use substantial mass as the mass parameter, while the pressure gradient and coefficient of viscosity will use inertial mass. We now have four fundamental parameters, and one dimensionless constant, so that the dimensional equation may be written:

:&lt;math&gt;C = \frac{p_\mathrm{x}\rho r^4}{\eta \dot{m}}&lt;/math&gt;

where now only {{mvar|C}} is an undetermined constant (found to be equal to &lt;math&gt;\pi/8&lt;/math&gt; by methods outside of dimensional analysis). This equation may be solved for the mass flow rate to yield [[Poiseuille's law]].

=== Siano's extension: orientational analysis ===

Huntley's extension has some serious drawbacks:

* It does not deal well with vector equations involving the ''[[cross product]],''
* nor does it handle well the use of ''angles'' as physical variables.

It also is often quite difficult to assign the L, L&lt;sub&gt;{{math|x}}&lt;/sub&gt;, L&lt;sub&gt;{{math|y}}&lt;/sub&gt;, L&lt;sub&gt;{{math|z}}&lt;/sub&gt;, symbols to the physical variables involved in the problem of interest. He invokes a procedure that involves the "symmetry" of the physical problem. This is often very difficult to apply reliably: It is unclear as to what parts of the problem that the notion of "symmetry" is being invoked. Is it the symmetry of the physical body that forces are acting upon, or to the points, lines or areas at which forces are being applied? What if more than one body is involved with different symmetries?

Consider the spherical bubble attached to a cylindrical tube, where one wants the flow rate of air as a function of the pressure difference in the two parts. What are the Huntley extended dimensions of the viscosity of the air contained in the connected parts? What are the extended dimensions of the pressure of the two parts? Are they the same or different? These difficulties are responsible for the limited application of Huntley's addition to real problems.

Angles are, by convention, considered to be dimensionless variables, and so the use of angles as physical variables in dimensional analysis can give less meaningful results. As an example, consider the projectile problem mentioned above. Suppose that, instead of the x-  and y-components of the initial velocity, we had chosen the magnitude of the velocity {{mvar|v}} and the angle {{mvar|θ}} at which the projectile was fired. The angle is, by convention, considered to be dimensionless, and the magnitude of a vector has no directional quality, so that no dimensionless variable can be composed of the four variables {{mvar|g}}, {{mvar|v}}, {{mvar|R}}, and {{mvar|θ}}. Conventional analysis will correctly give the powers of {{mvar|g}} and {{mvar|v}}, but will give no information concerning the dimensionless angle {{mvar|θ}}.

{{harvs|txt=yes|last=Siano|year1=1985-I|year2=1985-II}} has suggested that the directed dimensions of Huntley be replaced by using ''orientational symbols'' {{math|1&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;1&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;1&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;}} to denote vector directions, and an orientationless symbol 1&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. Thus, Huntley's L&lt;sub&gt;{{math|x}}&lt;/sub&gt; becomes L&amp;thinsp;1&lt;sub&gt;{{math|x}}&lt;/sub&gt; with L specifying the dimension of length, and {{math|1&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;}} specifying the orientation. Siano further shows that the orientational symbols have an algebra of their own.  Along with the requirement that {{math|1=1&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; = 1&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, the following multiplication table for the orientation symbols results:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{c|cccc}

Note that the orientational symbols form a group (the [[Klein four-group]] or "Viergruppe"). In this system, scalars always have the same orientation as the identity element, independent of the "symmetry of the problem".  Physical quantities that are vectors have the orientation expected:  a force or a velocity in the z-direction has the orientation of {{math|1&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;}}.  For angles, consider an angle {{mvar|θ}} that lies in the z-plane.  Form a right triangle in the z-plane with {{mvar|θ}} being one of the acute angles.  The side of the right triangle adjacent to the angle then has an orientation {{math|1&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;}} and the side opposite has an orientation {{math|1&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;}}.  Then, since {{math|1=tan(''θ'') = 1&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;/1&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; = ''θ''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;...}} we conclude that an angle in the xy-plane must have an orientation {{math|1=1&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;/1&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; = 1&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;}}, which is not unreasonable.  Analogous reasoning forces the conclusion that {{math|1=sin(''θ'')}} has orientation {{math|1&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;}} while {{math|cos(''θ'')}} has orientation 1&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.  These are different, so one concludes (correctly), for example, that there are no solutions of physical equations that are of the form {{math|''a'' cos(''θ'') + ''b'' sin(''θ'')}}, where {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} are real scalars. Note that an expression such as &lt;math&gt;\sin(\theta+\pi/2)=\cos(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; is not dimensionally inconsistent since it is a special case of the sum of angles formula and should properly be written:

:&lt;math&gt;
  \sin\left(a\,1_\text{z} + b\,1_\text{z}\right) =
    \sin\left(a\,1_\text{z}) \cos(b\,1_\text{z}\right) +
    \sin\left(b\,1_\text{z}) \cos(a\,1_\text{z}\right),
&lt;/math&gt;

which for &lt;math&gt;a = \theta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b = \pi/2&lt;/math&gt; yields &lt;math&gt;\sin(\theta\,1_\text{z} + [\pi/2]\,1_\text{z}) = 1_\text{z}\cos(\theta\,1_\text{z})&lt;/math&gt;. Physical quantities may be expressed as complex numbers (e.g. &lt;math&gt;e^{i\theta}&lt;/math&gt;) which imply that the complex quantity {{mvar|i}} has an orientation equal to that of the angle it is associated with ({{math|1&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;}} in the above example).

The assignment of orientational symbols to physical quantities and the requirement that physical equations be orientationally homogeneous can actually be used in a way that is similar to dimensional analysis to derive a little more information about acceptable solutions of physical problems.  In this approach one sets up the dimensional equation and solves it as far as one can.  If the lowest power of a physical variable is fractional, both sides of the solution is raised to a power such that all powers are integral.  This puts it into "normal form".  The orientational equation is then solved to give a more restrictive condition on the unknown powers of the orientational symbols, arriving at a solution that is more complete than the one that dimensional analysis alone gives. Often the added information is that one of the powers of a certain variable is even or odd.

As an example, for the projectile problem, using orientational symbols, θ, being in the xy-plane will thus have dimension {{math|1&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;}} and the range of the projectile {{mvar|R}} will be of the form:

:&lt;math&gt;R = g^a\,v^b\,\theta^c\text{ which means }\mathsf{L}\,1_\mathrm{x} \sim
\left(\frac{\mathsf{L}\,1_\text{y}}{\mathsf{T}^2}\right)^a \left(\frac{\mathsf{L}}{\mathsf{T}}\right)^b\,1_\mathsf{z}^c.\,&lt;/math&gt;

Dimensional homogeneity will now correctly yield {{math|1=''a'' = −1}} and {{math|1=''b'' = 2}}, and orientational homogeneity requires that {{mvar|c}} be an odd integer. In fact the required function of theta will be {{math|sin(''θ'')cos(''θ'')}} which is a series of odd powers of {{mvar|θ}}.

It is seen that the Taylor series of {{math|sin(''θ'')}} and {{math|cos(''θ'')}} are orientationally homogeneous using the above multiplication table, while expressions like {{math|cos(''θ'') + sin(''θ'')}} and {{math|exp(''θ'')}} are not, and are (correctly) deemed unphysical.

It should be clear that the multiplication rule used for the orientational symbols is not the same as that for the cross product of two vectors.  The cross product of two identical vectors is zero, while the product of two identical orientational symbols is the identity element.

== Dimensionless concepts ==

=== Constants ===
{{Main article|Dimensionless quantity}}
The dimensionless constants that arise in the results obtained, such as the C in the Poiseuille's Law problem and the &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; in the spring problems discussed above, come from a more detailed analysis of the underlying physics and often arise from integrating some differential equation.  Dimensional analysis itself has little to say about these constants, but it is useful to know that they very often have a magnitude of order unity.  This observation can allow one to sometimes make "[[back of the envelope]]" calculations about the phenomenon of interest, and therefore be able to more efficiently design experiments to measure it, or to judge whether it is important, etc.

=== Formalisms ===
Paradoxically, dimensional analysis can be a useful tool even if all the parameters in the underlying theory are dimensionless, e.g., lattice models such as the [[Ising model]] can be used to study phase transitions and critical phenomena. Such models can be formulated in a purely dimensionless way. As we approach the critical point closer and closer, the distance over which the variables in the lattice model are correlated (the so-called correlation length, &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; ) becomes larger and larger. Now, the correlation length is the relevant length scale related to critical phenomena, so one can, e.g., surmise on "dimensional grounds" that the non-analytical part of the free energy per lattice site should be &lt;math&gt;\sim 1/\xi^{d}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is the dimension of the lattice.

It has been argued by some physicists, e.g., [[Michael Duff (physicist)|M. J. Duff]],&lt;ref name="duff"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |last=Duff |first=M.J. |eprint=hep-th/0208093v3 |title=Comment on time-variation of fundamental constants |version= |date=July 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the laws of physics are inherently dimensionless. The fact that we have assigned incompatible dimensions to Length, Time and Mass is, according to this point of view, just a matter of convention, borne out of the fact that before the advent of modern physics, there was no way to relate mass, length, and time to each other. The three independent dimensionful constants: ''[[Speed of light|c]]'', ''[[Planck constant|ħ]]'', and ''[[Gravitational constant|G]]'', in the fundamental equations of physics must then be seen as mere conversion factors to convert Mass, Time and Length into each other.

Just as in the case of critical properties of lattice models, one can recover the results of dimensional analysis in the appropriate scaling limit; e.g., dimensional analysis in mechanics can be derived by reinserting the constants ''ħ'', ''c'', and ''G'' (but we can now consider them to be dimensionless) and demanding that a nonsingular relation between quantities exists in the limit &lt;math&gt;c\rightarrow \infty&lt;/math&gt;,  &lt;math&gt;\hbar\rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G\rightarrow  0&lt;/math&gt;. In problems involving a gravitational field the latter limit should be taken such that the field stays finite.

=== Natural units ===
{{main article|Natural units}}

If {{nowrap|1=''c'' = ''ħ'' = 1}}, where ''c'' is the [[speed of light]] and ''ħ'' is the [[reduced Planck constant]], and a suitable fixed unit of energy is chosen, then all quantities of length ''L'', mass ''M'' and time ''T'' can be expressed (dimensionally) as a power of energy ''E'', because length, mass and time can be expressed using speed ''v'', action ''S'', and energy ''E'':&lt;ref name=Martin08/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;M = \frac{E}{v^2},\quad L = \frac{Sv}{E}, \quad t = \frac{S}{E} &lt;/math&gt;

though speed and action are dimensionless ({{nowrap|1=''v'' = ''c'' = 1}} and {{nowrap|1=''S'' = ''ħ'' = 1}}) – so the only remaining quantity with dimension is energy. In terms of powers of dimensions:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathsf{E}^n = \mathsf{M}^p\mathsf{L}^q\mathsf{T}^r = \mathsf{E}^{p-q-r} &lt;/math&gt;

This is particularly useful in particle physics and high energy physics, in which case the energy unit is the electron volt (eV). Dimensional checks and estimates become very simple in this system.

However, if electric charges and currents are involved, another unit to be fixed is for electric charge, normally the [[electron charge]] ''e'' though other choices are possible.

'''File sharing''' is the practice of distributing or providing access to [[digital media]], such as computer programs, [[multimedia]] (audio, images and video), documents or [[E-book|electronic books]]. File sharing may be achieved in a number of ways. Common methods of [[Computer data storage|storage]], [[Data transmission|transmission]] and dispersion include manual sharing utilizing removable media, centralized servers on [[computer network]]s, World Wide Web-based [[hyperlink]]ed documents, and the use of distributed [[peer-to-peer]] networking.

==Types==

===Peer-to-peer file sharing===
[[Peer-to-peer file sharing]] is based on the [[peer-to-peer]] (P2P) application architecture. [[Shared resource|Shared files]] on the computers of other [[User (system)|users]] are indexed on directory servers. P2P technology was used by popular services like [[Napster]] and [[Limewire]]. The most popular protocol for P2P sharing is [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]].

===File sync and sharing services===
[[Cloud computing|Cloud-based]] [[file synchronization|file syncing and sharing]] services implement automated file transfers by updating files from a dedicated sharing directory on each user's networked devices. Files placed in this folder also are typically accessible through a website and mobile app, and can be easily shared with other users for viewing or collaboration. Such services have become popular via consumer-oriented [[file hosting service]]s such as [[Dropbox (service)|Dropbox]] and [[Google Drive]].

[[rsync]] is a more traditional program released in 1996 which synchronizes files on a direct machine-to-machine basis.

[[Data synchronization]] in general can use other approaches to share files, such as [[distributed filesystem]]s, [[version control]], or [[Web mirror|mirrors]].

==History==
{{Main|File sharing timeline}}
&lt;!-- pre-1999 --&gt;Files were first exchanged on [[removable media]]. Computers were able to access remote files using [[filesystem]] mounting, [[bulletin board systems]] (1978), [[Usenet]] (1979), and [[FTP]] servers (1985). [[Internet Relay Chat]] (1988) and [[Hotline Communications|Hotline]] (1997) enabled users to communicate remotely through [[online chat|chat]] and to exchange files. The [[mp3]] encoding, which was standardized in 1991 and substantially reduced the size of [[Audio file format|audio files]], grew to widespread use in the late 1990s. In 1998, [[MP3.com]] and [[Audiogalaxy]] were established, the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] was unanimously passed, and the first [[Portable media player|mp3 player]] devices were launched.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

In June 1999, [[Napster]] was released as an unstructured centralized peer-to-peer system,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KeIENcC2BPwC&amp;pg=PA532&amp;lpg=PA532&amp;dq=napster+first#PPA532,M1 |title=Reliable distributed systems: technologies, Web services, and applications - Kenneth P. Birman - Google Books |via=[[Google Books]] |accessdate=January 20, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170905151657/https://books.google.com/books?id=KeIENcC2BPwC&amp;pg=PA532&amp;lpg=PA532&amp;dq=napster+first#PPA532,M1 |archivedate=September 5, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; requiring a central server for indexing and peer discovery. It is generally credited as being the first peer-to-peer file sharing system.

[[Gnutella]], [[eDonkey2000]], and [[Freenet]] were released in 2000, as MP3.com and Napster were facing litigation. [[Gnutella]], released in March, was the first decentralized file sharing network. In the gnutella network, all connecting software was considered equal, and therefore the network had no [[Single point of failure|central point of failure]]. In July, [[Freenet]] was released and became the first anonymity network. In September the [[eDonkey2000]] client and server software was released.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

In 2001, [[Kazaa]] and [[Poisoned]] for the Mac was released. Its [[FastTrack]] network was distributed, though unlike gnutella, it assigned more traffic to 'supernodes' to increase routing efficiency. The network was proprietary and encrypted, and the Kazaa team made substantial efforts to keep other clients such as [[Morpheus (computer program)|Morpheus]] off of the FastTrack network.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

In July 2001, Napster was sued by several recording companies and lost in [[A&amp;M Records, Inc. v. Napster, Inc.]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Menta | first=Richard | title=RIAA Sues Music Startup Napster for $20 Billion | date=December 9, 1999 | publisher=MP3 Newswire | url=http://www.mp3newswire.net/stories/napster.html | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601112815/http://www.mp3newswire.net/stories/napster.html | archivedate=June 1, 2013 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of Napster, it has been ruled that an online service provider could not use the "transitory network transmission" safe harbor in the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act|DMCA]] if they had control of the network with a server.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://w2.eff.org/IP/P2P/p2p_copyright_wp.php |title=EFF: What Peer-to-Peer Developers Need to Know about Copyright Law |publisher=W2.eff.org |accessdate=January 20, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120115034129/http://w2.eff.org/IP/P2P/p2p_copyright_wp.php |archivedate=January 15, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after its loss in court, Napster was shut down to comply with a court order. This drove users to other P2P applications and file sharing continued its growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Menta | first=Richard | title=Napster Clones Crush Napster.

Until its decline in 2004, Kazaa was the most popular file sharing program despite bundled [[malware]] and legal battles in the Netherlands, Australia, and the United States. In 2002, a Tokyo district court ruling shut down File Rogue, and the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) filed a lawsuit that effectively shut down Audiogalaxy.

[[File:Pro piracy demonstration.jpg|thumb|Demonstrators protesting [[The Pirate Bay raid]] in 2006]]

From 2002 through 2003, a number of [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]] services were established, including [[Suprnova.org]], [[isoHunt]], [[TorrentSpy]], and [[The Pirate Bay]]. In 2002, the RIAA was filing lawsuits against Kazaa users. As a result of such lawsuits, many universities added file sharing regulations in their school administrative codes (though some students managed to circumvent them during after school hours). With the shutdown of eDonkey in 2005, eMule became the dominant client of the eDonkey network. In 2006, police raids took down the [[Razorback2]] eDonkey server and temporarily took down [[The Pirate Bay]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

“The File Sharing Act was launched by Chairman Towns in 2009, this act prohibited the use of applications that allowed individuals to share federal information amongst one another. On the other hand, only specific file sharing application were made available to federal computers” (United States.Congress.House). In 2009, the [[Pirate Bay trial]] ended in a guilty verdict for the primary founders of the tracker. The decision was appealed, leading to a second guilty verdict in November 2010. In October 2010, Limewire was forced to shut down following a court order in [[Arista Records LLC v. Lime Group LLC]] but the gnutella network remains active through open source clients like [[Frostwire]] and [[gtk-gnutella]]. Furthermore, multi-protocol file sharing software such as [[MLDonkey]] and [[Shareaza]] adapted in order to support all the major file sharing protocols, so users no longer had to install and configure multiple file sharing programs.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

On January 19, 2012, the [[United States Department of Justice]] shut down the popular domain of [[Megaupload]] (established 2005). The file sharing site has claimed to have over 50,000,000 people a day.&lt;ref name="megaupload_wp"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/department-of-justice-site-hacked-after-megaupload-shutdown-anonymous-claims-credit/2012/01/20/gIQAl5MNEQ_story.html?tid=pm_business_pop |title=Department of Justice site hacked after Megaupload shutdown, Anonymous claims credit.

==Public opinion of file sharing==
In 2004 there were an estimated 70 million people participating in online file sharing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/2004/march17/fileshare-317.html |title=Law professors examine ethical controversies of peer-to-peer file sharing|last = Delgado |first = Ray |work=Stanford Report |publisher=[[Stanford University]] |date=March 17, 2004 |accessdate=January 20, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625030926/http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/2004/march17/fileshare-317.html |archivedate=June 25, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a [[CBS News]] poll in 2009, 58% of [[United States|Americans]] who follow the file sharing issue, considered it acceptable "if a person owns the music CD and shares it with a limited number of friends and acquaintances"; with 18- to 29-year-olds this percentage reached as much as 70%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/09/18/opinion/polls/main573990.shtml |title=Poll: Young Say File Sharing OK |publisher=[[CBS News]] |date=February 11, 2009 |accessdate=January 20, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111130162846/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/09/18/opinion/polls/main573990.shtml |archivedate=November 30, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his survey of file-sharing culture, Caraway (2012) noted that 74.4% of participants believed musicians should accept file sharing as a means for promotion and distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/viewFile/1216/720|title = Survey of File-Sharing Culture|date = 2012|accessdate = November 25, 2015|website = [[International Journal of Communication]]|publisher = [[USC Annenberg Press]], [[Creative Commons license]] (by-nc-nd)|last = Caraway|first = Brett Robert |deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304090451/http://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/viewFile/1216/720|archivedate = March 4, 2016|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic impact==
According to David Glenn, writing in ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]'', "A majority of economic studies have concluded that file sharing hurts sales".&lt;ref name="HigherEdu"&gt;Glenn, David. Dispute Over the Economics of File Sharing Intensifies, ''[[Chronicle.com]]'', July 17, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; A literature review by Professor Peter Tschmuck found 22 [[independent study|independent studies]] on the effects of music file sharing. "Of these 22 studies, 14 – roughly two-thirds – conclude that unauthorized downloads have a 'negative or even highly negative impact' on recorded music sales. Three of the studies found no significant impact while the remaining five found a positive impact."&lt;ref&gt;Hart, Terry. [http://www.copyhype.com/2012/02/more-evidence-for-copyright-protection/ More Evidence for Copyright Protection] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205093806/http://www.copyhype.com/2012/02/more-evidence-for-copyright-protection/ |date=February 5, 2012 }}, copyhype.com, February 1, 2012. "The literature review looked at a 23rd study but did not classify it here since the author presented a mixed conclusion: the overall effect of unauthorized downloads is insignificant, but for unknown artists, there is a 'strongly negative' effect on recorded music sales."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;AJ Sokolov, Daniel . [http://www.heise.de/ct/meldung/Wissenschaftler-Studien-ueber-Tauschboersen-unbrauchbar-1020532.html Wissenschaftler: Studien über Tauschbörsen unbrauchbar] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603034104/http://www.heise.de/ct/meldung/Wissenschaftler-Studien-ueber-Tauschboersen-unbrauchbar-1020532.html |date=June 3, 2013 }}, ''[[c't]]'' magazine, June 11, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

A study by economists [[Felix Oberholzer-Gee]] and Koleman Strumpf in 2004 concluded that music file sharing's effect on sales was "statistically indistinguishable from zero".&lt;ref name="levine"&gt;Levine, Robert. ''Free Ride: How the Internet Is Destroying the Culture Business and How the Culture Business Can Fight Back'', Bodley Head,  February 2011, {{ISBN|1847921485}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unc.edu/~cigar/papers/FileSharing_March2004.pdf|format=PDF|title=The Effect of File Sharing on Record Sales: An Empirical Analysis|last=Oberholzer|first=Felix|author2=Koleman Strumpf|accessdate=June 13, 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080613031108/http://www.unc.edu/~cigar/papers/FileSharing_March2004.pdf|archivedate=June 13, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This research was disputed by other economists, most notably Stan Liebowitz, who said Oberholzer-Gee and Strumpf had made multiple assumptions about the music industry "that are just not correct."&lt;ref name="levine" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|ssrn=1014399|title=How Reliable is the Oberholzer-Gee and Strumpf Paper on File-Sharing?|last=Liebowitz|first=Stan J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://musicbusinessresearch.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/paper-stan-j-liebowitz1.pdf|format=PDF|title=The Key Instrument in the Oberholzer-Gee/Strumpf File-Sharing Paper is Defective|last=Liebowitz|first=Stan J.|accessdate=June 13, 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100827225353/http://musicbusinessresearch.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/paper-stan-j-liebowitz1.pdf|archivedate=August 27, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2010, ''Billboard'' reported that Oberholzer-Gee and Strumpf had "changed their minds", now finding "no more than 20% of the recent decline in sales is due to sharing".&lt;ref&gt;Peoples, Glenn. [http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/content_display/industry/e3i82a006de3290b1a63323f3e4ee910ca9 Researchers Change Tune, Now Say P2P Has Negative Impact ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101209002810/http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/content_display/industry/e3i82a006de3290b1a63323f3e4ee910ca9 |date=December 9, 2010 }} ''Billboard''. June 22, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; However, citing [[Nielsen SoundScan]] as their source, the co-authors maintained that illegal downloading had not deterred people from being original. "In many creative industries, monetary incentives play a reduced role in motivating authors to remain creative. Data on the supply of new works are consistent with the argument that file sharing did not discourage authors and publishers. Since the advent of file sharing, the production of music, books, and movies has increased sharply."&lt;ref&gt;Oberholzer &amp; Strumpf. "File Sharing and Copyright" ''NBER Innovation Policy &amp; the Economy'', Vol. 10, No. 1, 2010. "Artists receive a significant portion of their remuneration not in monetary form – many of them enjoy fame, admiration, social status, and free beer in bars – suggesting a reduction in monetary incentives might possibly have a reduced impact on the quantity and quality of artistic production."&lt;/ref&gt; Glenn Peoples of ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' disputed the underlying data, saying "SoundScan's number for new releases in any given year represents new commercial titles, not necessarily new creative works."&lt;ref&gt;Peoples, Glenn.

July 26, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The RIAA likewise responded that "new releases" and "new creative works" are two separate things. "[T]his figure includes re-releases, new compilations of existing songs, and new digital-only versions of catalog albums. SoundScan has also steadily increased the number of retailers (especially non-traditional retailers) in their sample over the years, better capturing the number of new releases brought to market. What Oberholzer and Strumpf found was better ability to track new album releases, not greater incentive to create them."&lt;ref&gt;Friedlander, Joshua P. &amp; Lamy, Jonathan. [http://www.ifpi.org/content/library/view_35.pdf Illegal Downloading = Fewer Musicians] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121074926/http://www.ifpi.org/content/library/view_35.pdf |date=January 21, 2012 }} ifpi.org, July 19, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2006 study prepared by Birgitte Andersen and Marion Frenz, published by [[Industry Canada]], was "unable to discover any direct relationship between P2P file-sharing and CD purchases in Canada".&lt;ref&gt;[http://strategis.ic.gc.ca/epic/site/ippd-dppi.nsf/en/h_ip01456e.html The Impact of Music Downloads and P2P File-Sharing on the Purchase of Music: A Study for Industry Canada] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914010619/http://strategis.ic.gc.ca/epic/site/ippd-dppi.nsf/en/h_ip01456e.html |date=September 14, 2008 }}, Birgitte Andersen and Marion Frenz&lt;/ref&gt; The results of this survey were similarly criticized by academics and a subsequent revaluation of the same data by Dr. George R. Barker of the [[Australian National University]] reached the opposite conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;Peoples, Glenn.

Only 25% of people say they would not have bought the music if it were not available on P2P for free." Barker thus concludes; "This clearly suggests P2P network availability is reducing music demand of 75% of music downloaders which is quite contrary to Andersen and Frenz's much published claim."&lt;ref&gt;Barker, George R.

According to the 2017 paper "Estimating displacement rates of copyrighted content in the EU" by the [[European Commission]], illegal usage increases game sales, stating "The overall conclusion is that for games, illegal online transactions induce more legal transactions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cdn.netzpolitik.org/wp-upload/2017/09/displacement_study.pdf|title=Estimating displacement rates of copyrighted content in the EU|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=February 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A paper in journal ''[[Operations Research: A Journal of the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences|Management Science]]'' found that file sharing decreased the chance of survival for low ranked albums on music charts and increased exposure to albums that were ranked high on the music charts, allowing popular and well known artists to remain on the music charts more often. This had a negative impact for new and less known artists while promoting the work of already popular artists and celebrities.&lt;ref&gt;Bhattacharjee, Sudip., Gopal, Ram D., Lertwachara, Kaveepan. Marsden, James R. &amp; Telang, Rahul. [http://mansci.journal.informs.org/content/53/9/1359.full.pdf+html The Effect of Digital Sharing Technologies on Music Markets: A Survival Analysis of Albums on Ranking Charts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214152135/http://mansci.journal.informs.org/content/53/9/1359.full.pdf+html |date=February 14, 2012 }} ''Management Science'' 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

A more recent study that examined pre-release file sharing of music albums, using BitTorrent software, also discovered positive impacts for "established and popular artists but not newer and smaller artists." According to Robert G. Hammond of [[North Carolina State University]], an album that leaked one month early would see a modest increase in sales. "This increase in sales is small relative to other factors that have been found to affect album sales."

&lt;blockquote&gt;"File-sharing proponents commonly argue that file sharing democratizes music consumption by 'leveling the playing field' for new/small artists relative to established/popular artists, by allowing artists to have their work heard by a wider audience, lessening the advantage held by established/popular artists in terms of promotional and other support. My results suggest that the opposite is happening, which is consistent with evidence on file-sharing behavior."&lt;ref&gt;Hammond. Robert G. "[http://www4.ncsu.edu/~rghammon/Hammond_File_Sharing_Leak.pdf Profit Leak? Pre-Release File Sharing and the Music Industry] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120523032458/http://www4.ncsu.edu/~rghammon/Hammond_File_Sharing_Leak.pdf |date=May 23, 2012 }}" May 2012. File sharing benefits mainstream albums such as pop music but not albums in niche genres such as indie music. ... Further, the finding that file sharing redistributes sales toward established/popular artists is inconsistent with claims made by proponents of file sharing that file sharing democratizes music consumption."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Billboard'' cautioned that this research looked only at the pre-release period and not continuous file sharing following a release date. "The problem in believing [[Copyright infringement#"Piracy"|piracy]] helps sales is deciding where to draw the line between legal and illegal ... Implicit in the study is the fact that both buyers and sellers are required in order for pre-release file sharing to have a positive impact on album sales. Without iTunes, Amazon and Best Buy, file-sharers would be just file sharers rather than purchasers. If you carry out the 'file sharing should be legal' argument to its logical conclusion, today's retailers will be tomorrow's file-sharing services that integrate with their respective cloud storage services."&lt;ref&gt;Peoples, Glenn.

===Availability===
Many argue that file-sharing has forced the owners of entertainment content to make it more widely available legally through fee or advertising on demand on the internet. In a 2011 report by [[Sandvine]] showed that [[Netflix]] traffic had come to surpass that of [[Bittorrent]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/images_blogs/epicenter/2011/05/SandvineGlobalInternetSpringReport2011.pdf Global Internet Phenomena Report - Spring 2011] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113020428/http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/epicenter/2011/05/SandvineGlobalInternetSpringReport2011.pdf |date=January 13, 2012 }} Sandvine Global Internet Waterloo, Ontario, Canada.

==Copyright issues==
{{main|Legal aspects of file sharing}}
File sharing raises copyright issues and has led to many lawsuits. In the [[United States]], some of these lawsuits have even reached the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]]. For example, in ''[[MGM Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd.|MGM v. Grokster]]'', the Supreme Court ruled that the creators of P2P networks can be held liable if their software is marketed as a tool for copyright infringement.

On the other hand, not all file sharing is illegal. Content in the [[public domain]] can be freely shared. Even works covered by [[copyright]] can be shared under certain circumstances. For example, some artists, publishers, and [[record label]]s grant the public a license for unlimited distribution of certain works, sometimes with conditions, and they advocate [[free content]] and file sharing as a promotional tool.

[[File:Rechentisch.png|thumb|300px|right|[[Counting board]] ([[woodcut]], probably from Strasbourg). The lines and the spaces between the lines function like the wires or rods on an [[abacus]]. The [[place value]] is marked at the end.]]
{{Numismatics}}
'''Jetons''' or '''jettons''' are [[Token coin|tokens]] or [[coin]]-like medals produced across Europe from the 13th through the 17th centuries. They were produced as counters for use in calculation on a [[counting board]], a lined board similar to an [[abacus]]. They also found use as a money substitute in games, similar to modern casino chips or [[poker chip]]s. 

Thousands of different jetons exist, mostly of religious and educational designs, as well as portraits, the last of which most resemble coinage, somewhat similar to modern, non-circulation [[commemorative coins]]. The spelling "[[wikt:jeton|jeton]]" is from the French; the English spell it "[[wikt:jetton|jetton]]".

==Roman calculi==
The Romans similarly used [[pebble]]s (in Latin: ''calculi'' "little stones", whence English ''calculate''). Addition is straightforward, and relatively efficient algorithms for multiplication and division were known.

==Arabic numerals==
As [[Arabic numerals]] and the [[zero (number)|zero]] came into use, "pen reckoning" gradually displaced "counter casting" as the common accounting method. Jetons for calculation were commonly used in Europe from about 1200 to 1400, and remained in occasional use into the early nineteenth century.

==Middle Ages==
From the late 13th century to the end of the 14th century, purpose-made jetons were produced in England, similar in design to contemporary Edwardian [[penny|pennies]]. Although they were made of brass they were often pierced or indented at the centre to avoid them being plated with silver and pass them off as real silver coins. By the middle of the 14th century, English jetons were being produced at a larger size, similar to the groat. 

==Late Middle Ages==
[[File:Rekenaar 1553.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Jeton, Nuremberg, c. 1553, the moneychanger, diameter 28&amp;nbsp;mm]]
Throughout the 15th century, competition from [[France]] and the [[Low Countries]] ended jeton manufacture in England, but this did not last long. [[Nuremberg]] jeton masters initially started by copying counters of their European neighbours, but by the mid 16th century they gained a monopoly by mass-producing cheaper jetons for commercial use. Later – "counter casting" being obsolete – the production shifted to jetons for use in games and toys, sometimes copying more or less famous jetons with a political background as the following.

In the Low Countries, the respective mints in the late Middle Ages in general produced the counters for the official bookkeeping. These mostly show the effigy of the ruler within a flattering text and on the reverse the ruler's [[escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]] and the name or city of the accounting office.

==16th century onwards==
[[File:Jeton vernietiging Armada.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Jeton, Dordrecht 1588, the invincible Armada destroyed, diameter 30&amp;nbsp;mm]]

During the [[Dutch Revolt]] (1568–1609) this pattern changed and by both parties, the North in front, about 2,000 different, mostly political, jetons (Dutch: ''Rekenpenning'') were minted depicting the victories, ideals and aims. Specifically in the last quarter of the 16th century, where "Geuzen" or "beggars" made important military contributions to the Dutch side and bookkeeping was already done without counters, the production in the North was just for propaganda.

The mints and treasuries of the big estates in Central Europe used their own jetons and then had a number of them struck in gold and silver as New Year gifts for their employees who in turn commissioned jetons with their own mottoes and coats-of-arms. In the sixteenth century, the Czech Royal Treasury bought between two and three thousand pieces at the beginning of each year.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Modern use==
In the 21st century, Jetons continue to be used in some countries to denominate the substitutes for coins in coin-operated [[Payphone|public telephones]] or [[vending machine]]s, because automatic valuation of coins by machines is unreliable or impossible due to several factors. They are usually made of metal or hard plastic, and are generally called tokens in English-speaking countries.

In France and other countries, ''jeton'' is also a small (as a token, so to speak) amount of [[money]] paid to members of a [[society]] or a legislative chamber each time they are present in a [[meeting]].

In the [[German language]], the word ''Jeton'' refers specifically to [[casino token]]s.

In the [[Polish language]], the word ''żeton'', pronounced similarly to French ''jeton'', refers both to tokens used in the vending machines, phones etc., as well to those used in the casinos. The word ''жетон'' has the same use in the [[Russian language]], as does the word ''jeton'' in the [[Romanian language]] and ''žetoon'' in the [[Estonian language]].

In the [[Hungarian language]] the word ''zseton'' is (somewhat dated) slang for money, particularly coins.

== Cameras ==

=== Rangefinder film cameras ===
Seiki Kogaku (now Canon) began to develop and subsequently to produce rangefinder cameras with the Kwanon prototype in 1933, based on the Leica II 35mm camera, with separate rangefinder and view finder systems (3 windows). Production began with the Hansa Canon on the Leica III format through WWII.  Post war Canon resumed production of pre-war designs in early 1946 with the JII viewfinder and the S1 rangefinder.  But in late 1946 they introduced the SII which departed from the Leica design by offering a combined viewfinder/rangefinder system, reducing the windows on the front of the camera to two.  However, in most other respects these cameras remained visually similar to the Leica III.

* [[Kwanon]] (1933) Nippon Kogaku (now Nikon) provided Seiki Kogaku with funding, Nikkor lenses, rangefinders, and technical assistance
* [[Canon Inc.|Canon]] (1936) Known today as the "Original Canon" The viewfinder moved to the top of the camera, differing from the Leica
* [[Hansa Canon]] (1936) Omiya Trading Co marketed original Canon with the Hansa name above the Canon name on the top
* [[Canon S]] (1939) Standard model.  The word “Hansa” disappeared from the brand name, and was replaced with just “Canon” 
* [[Canon NS]] (1939) New Standard. A Canon S without the slow shutter speeds
* [[Canon J]] (1939) J stands for Junior a non-rangefinder model.
* [[Canon J II]] (1946) Similar if not the same as prewar cameras
* [[Canon S]] (1946) Similar if not the same as prewar cameras
* [[Canon S II]] (1946)  A redesign with combined range finder and viewfinder functions - two windows
* [[Canon II B]] (1949)
* [[Canon II C]] (1950)
* [[Canon III]] (1951)
* [[Canon IV]] (1951)
* [[Canon III A]] (1951)
* [[Canon IV S]] (1952)
* [[Canon II A]] (1952)
* [[Canon II D]] (1952)
* [[Canon IV SB]] (1952)
* [[Canon II AF]] (1953)
* [[Canon II F]] (1953)
* [[Canon II AX]] (1953)
* [[Canon II S]] (1954)
* [[Canon IV Sb2]] (1954)
* [[Canon II S2]] (1955)
* [[Canon II D2]] (1955)
* [[Canon II F2]] (1955)

In 1956, Canon departed from the Leica II Style and developed a more contemporary look, along with a Contax style self-timer level to the left of the lens mount.   This was the first Canon camera with a swing-open camera back for film loading. Upper end models had a new three-mode viewfinders and winding triggers.

* [[Canon VT]] (1956)
* [[Canon L2]] (1957)
* [[Canon VT Deluxe]] (1957)
* [[Canon L1]] (1957)
* [[Canon L3]] (1957)
* [[Canon VL]] (1958)
* [[Canon VL2]] (1958)
* [[Canon VI T]] (1958)
* [[Canon VI L]] (1958)
* [[Canon P (Populaire)]] (1959)
* [[Canonet]] (1961) Lower priced simpler camera
* [[Canon 7]] (1961) Including a built-in meter and improved viewfinder system.

Canon partnered with US manufacturer [[Bell &amp; Howell]] between 1961–1976 and a few Canon products were sold in the US under the Bell &amp; Howell brand e.g. Canon 7 Rangefinder, Canon EX-EE, and the Canon TX.

=== SLR cameras ===
''(See also:[[Template:Table of Canon SLR]])''

==== [[Canon Canonflex|Canonflex]] [[single-lens reflex camera|SLR]] ====
Canon developed and produced the Canon R lens mount for film SLR cameras in 1959. The FL lens mount replaced R-mounts in 1964.
* [[Canonflex]] (1959) - Planned as Canon's first professional-class SLR camera body, but it was not successful.  Available with builtin motor-drive option (not detachable).
* [[Canonflex R2000]] (1960) - An upgrade with 1/2000 shutter speed (up from 1/1000)
* [[Canonflex RP]] (1960) - simplified Canonflex without the interchangeable prism/viewer
* [[Canonflex RM]] (1962) - A redesign of the RP with builtin metering and a lower profile prism.  Offered with an f/1.2 58mm lens option

==== [[Canon FL|FL]]-mount [[single-lens reflex camera|SLR]] ====
Canon developed and produced the [[Canon FL]] [[lens mount|lens-mount]] standard for [[Photographic film|film]] [[Single-lens reflex camera|SLR]] [[camera]]s from 1964 to replace the [[Canon R]] lens-mount standard. The [[Canon FD|FD]] [[lens mount]] standard replaced FL-mounts in 1971.
* [[Canon FX]] (1964)
* [[Canon FP]] (1964)
* [[Canon Pellix]] (1965)
* [[Canon FT QL]] (1966)
* [[Canon Pellix QL]] (1966)
* [[Canon TL]] (1968)

==== [[Canon EE|EE]]-mount [[single-lens reflex camera|SLR]] ====
In 1969 Canon introduced an economy camera/lens system where the rear three elements (in two groups) were built-on-to the camera, and several front element options could be interchanged.  This had been used by Zeiss-Ikon in their mid-level cameras of their Contaflex series, and by Kodak in early interchangeable lenses for the top-end Retina series (later going to full lenses).  Canon offered four lens options: 35mm f/3.5, 50mm f/1.8, 95mm f/3.5, and 1255mm f/3.5.

Through the lens metering was center weighted and automatic exposure was shutter speed priority.  Only two cameras were offered and the line was not successful.

* [[Canon EXEE]] (1969)
* [[Canon EX Auto]] (1972) improved auto flash features

==== [[Canon FD|FD]]-mount [[single-lens reflex camera|SLR]] ====
Canon developed and produced the [[Canon FD]] [[lens mount]] standard for [[Photographic film|film]] [[Single-lens reflex camera|SLR]] [[camera]]s from 1971 to replace the [[Canon FL|FL]] [[lens mount]] standard.
The FD mount had two variants&amp;nbsp;– original lenses used a breechlock collar to mount whilst later versions used a standard bayonet twist lock with a short twist action.
The EF [[lens mount]] standard superseded FD-mounts in 1987. [[Canon Inc.|Canon]] ceased to produce [[Canon FD lens mount|FD]]-mount cameras in 1994.

===== F series =====
* [[Canon F-1]] (1971) - Reputed as Canon's first successful professional-class SLR camera body.  The 1959 Canonflex professional camera system (above) failed and was down-featured for the consumer market.
* [[Canon FTb]] (1971)
* [[Canon FTb]]n (1973)
* [[Canon EF camera|Canon EF]] (1973)
* [[Canon TLb]] (1974)
* [[Canon TX]] (1975)
* [[Canon F-1n]] (1976)
* [[Canon New F-1]] (1981)

===== A series =====
* [[Canon AE-1]] (1976)
* [[Canon AT-1]] (1977)
* [[Canon A-1]] (1978)
* [[Canon AV-1]] (1979)
* [[Canon AE-1 Program]] (1981)
* [[Canon AL-1]] (1982)

===== T series =====
* [[Canon T50]] (1983)
* [[Canon T70]] (1984)
* [[Canon T80]] (1985)
* [[Canon T90]] (1986)
* [[Canon T60]] (1990)

==== [[Canon EOS|EOS]] ====
In 1987, Canon introduced the [[Canon EOS|EOS]] Single-lens reflex camera system along with the [[Canon EF lens mount|EF]] lens-mount standard to replace the 16-year-old [[Canon FD|FD]] lens-mount standard; EOS became the sole SLR camera-system used by Canon {{As of|2005|alt=today}}. Canon also used EOS for its [[Digital data|digital]] SLR cameras.   All current [[Photographic film|film]] and [[Digital data|digital]] [[Single-lens reflex camera|SLR]] cameras produced by Canon {{As of|2005|alt=today}} use the [[Canon EOS|EOS]] [[autofocus]] system. Canon introduced this system in 1987 along with the [[Canon EF lens mount|EF]] [[lens mount]] standard. The last non-EOS based SLR camera produced by Canon, the [[Canon T90]] of 1986,  is widely regarded as the template for the EOS line of camera bodies, although the T90 employed the older [[Canon FD|FD]] lens-mount standard.

====NoteJet====
Beginning in Spring 1993, Canon produced a series of notebooks with integrated inkjet printers called NoteJet. The initial price for the first-model NoteJet was U.S. $2,499.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Lewis |first=Peter H. |title=Canon laptop has a built-in ink-jet printer |publisher=[[Baltimore Sun]] |date=1993-04-19 |url= http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1993-04-19/business/1993109128_1_printer-and-computer-office-printers-ink-jet-printer |accessdate=2014-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NoteJet lineup was eventually discontinued, and computers belonging to the series are valued by collectors.

== Printers ==
Canon printers are supplied with Canon Advanced Printing Technology (CAPT), a printer driver software-stack developed by Canon. The company claims that its use of [[data compression]] reduces their printer's memory requirement, good quality compared to conventional laser printers, and also claim that it increases the [[Bit rate|data transfer rate]] when printing high-resolution graphics.&lt;ref&gt;

=== [[Canon PIXMA Series|PIXMA series]] ===
Since about 2005 Canon introduced a numbering scheme for some whereby the least significant (non-zero) digit signifies the geographic region (“3” signifying Japan) the device is sold in. This leads to a large number of models, all belonging to the same family, but possibly incompatible to some degree, and also makes it difficult to ascertain whether a device is unique or part of an existing family. The software driver filename will often use the family designation.

Some MP devices have fax capability (MP740).

EF-S lenses are built for APS-C 1.6x crop sensors, so it will only work with models that use this sensor size, such as: Canon EOS Digital Rebel series ([[Canon EOS 300D|300D]] through [[Canon EOS 750D|750D]] and [[Canon EOS 760D|760D]], [[Canon EOS 100D|100D]], and [[Canon EOS 1000D|1000D]] through [[Canon EOS 1200D|1200D]]), and newer cameras in the prosumer Canon EOS Digital series ([[Canon EOS 20D|20D]] through [[Canon EOS 80D|80D]], [[Canon EOS 20Da|20Da]], [[Canon EOS 60D#EOS 60Da|60Da]], [[Canon EOS 7D|7D]], and [[Canon EOS 7D Mark II|7D MkII]]). When EF-S lenses are used on a 35mm (full frame) camera, the back element will hit the mirror assembly or cause massive amounts of vignetting since the sensor is bigger than the image produced by the lens.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3852">&lt;!--This article originally described exclusively the TSA locks. I have moved a very much cut-down version into the Transportation Security Administration article and linked this article to it. Personally I think this article is not notable, but will leave others to judge. pol098--&gt; &lt;!-- I've cleaned up the article and moved all of the TSA-specific stuff to its own section or the [[Travel Sentry]] while adding some general info about luggage locks as well. --~~~~ --&gt;
[[File:Suitcase2.jpg|thumb|Built-in TSA luggage lock using Travel Sentry standard]]
[[File:Travel Sentry Lock.jpg|thumb|Combination padlock using Travel Sentry TSA Lock system]]
A '''luggage lock''' is a [[Lock (security device)|lock]] used to prevent [[luggage]] from opening by accident, usually with little or no security in mind, although they may serve as a deterrent to potential thieves. They may be built into luggage, or may be external locks such as [[padlock]]s or lockable straps. They are typically relatively simple low security locks.

==Security==

{{for|the 2015 incident where TSA master keys were leaked|Transportation Security Administration#Luggage locks}}

Luggage locks are typically low security locks. The shackles have a small diameter, and are easy to clip using bolt cutters or similar equipment. Luggage locks based on a [[pin tumbler lock]] design usually use only three or four pins, making them susceptible to lockpicking,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtJx3j7AhQk|title=How to open TSA luggage locks}}&lt;/ref&gt; even with tools as simple as a bent paperclip.
&lt;!--
    Note to editors:
    This article is about luggage locks in general. Editors wishing to add information specific to TSA-approved
    luggage locks may want to edit the following article instead: [[Travel Sentry]]
    --~~~~
--&gt;

==TSA Accepted==
{{main|Transportation Security Administration#Luggage locks}}
In the [[United States]] the [[Transportation Security Administration]] (TSA) requires access to luggage without the passenger being present; to allow travelers to lock their luggage they have accepted [[Transportation Security Administration#TSA luggage locks|certain locks]] which they can open and relock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=|title= TSA Recognized Baggage Locks|publisher= Transportation Security Administration|accessdate=July 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The TSA recommend&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tsa.gov/travel/travel-tips|title=Travel Tips|publisher=Transportation Security Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt; that TSA accepted locks be used, as luggage locked using other methods must be opened by force in order to be inspected.

Luggage locks accepted by the TSA can be opened by the authorities using publicly known universal "master" keys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.travelsentry.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=47&amp;Itemid=53&amp;lang=en|title=Lock
|publisher=Travel Sentry |accessdate=July 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Locks using this system are produced to meet standards set by [[Travel Sentry]]. Under agreement with the TSA, it is Travel Sentry that sets the standards for these locks and approves each design. Every lock with the Travel Sentry identifying mark (red diamond) is accepted by the TSA.

Some TSA accepted locks feature an indicator which will appear red if opened by a master key, so the owner will know that their bag has been accessed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://searchalertlocks.com/|title=Search Alert Lock|publisher=Search Alert|accessdate=November 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2410">A '''medical calculator''' is a type of medical [[computer software]], whose purpose is to allow easy calculation of various scores and indices, presenting the user with a friendly interface that hides the complexity of the formulas. Most offer further helpful information such as result interpretation guides and medical literature references.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-users.med.cornell.edu/~spon/picu/calc/medcalc.htm?name1=Medical+Calculators&amp;type1=2Active Cornell Medical Calculators]&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, such calculators are intended for use by health care professionals, and use by the general public is discouraged.

Medical calculators arose because modern [[medicine]] makes frequent use of scores and indices that put [[physician]]s' memory and calculation skills to the test.&lt;ref name="Lee-2009"&gt;
{{cite journal | author=Lee P. | title=Design of infusion rate calculator tools for intravenous therapy | journal=Nurs Stand. | year=2009 | issue=23 | pages=43–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advent of personal computers, the Internet and Web, and more recently [[personal digital assistant]]s (PDAs) have formed an environment conducive to their development, spread and use.

==Types of calculators==

===Hardware devices===
Purpose-built devices for specific medical calculations are available from various commercial sources. Pharma-Insight Inc. in Canada is one of the only companies in the world that is able to make custom specific medical calculators built to perform a specific medical calculation to make dosing or other calculation easy. Some of the standard units they make include eGFR, CrCl, BMI, BSA, DAS and many other custom units designed for a specific purpose.  There are two ways to make a calculator using an array that looks up an answer based on a large array of data or where the calculator computes the answer using a mathematical equation.

===PDA===
Software-based medical calculators are available for various PDA-platforms, including the [[iPhone]], [[Palm OS|Palm]] and [[Pocket PC]]. Handheld battery powered portable units are available and can be manufactured in smaller quantities than before thanks to OTP (one Time Programmable) chips.

===Online Calculators===
Various websites are available that provide calculations from a browser based input form.

'''Memory management''' is a form of [[Resource management (computing)|resource management]] applied to [[computer memory]].  The essential requirement of memory management is to provide ways to dynamically allocate portions of memory to programs at their request, and free it for reuse when no longer needed. This is critical to any advanced computer system where more than a single [[Process (computing)|process]] might be underway at any time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gibson|first=Steve|author1-link=Steve Gibson (computer programmer)|title=Tech Talk: Placing the IBM/Microsoft XMS Spec Into Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZzoEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA34|magazine=[[InfoWorld]]|date=August 15, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several methods have been devised that increase the effectiveness of memory management. [[Virtual memory]] systems separate the memory addresses used by a process from actual physical addresses, allowing separation of processes and increasing the size of the [[virtual address space]] beyond the available amount of [[Random-access memory|RAM]] using [[paging]] or swapping to [[secondary storage]]. The quality of the virtual memory manager can have an extensive effect on overall system performance.

== Details ==
{{expand section|date=November 2016}}

Application-level memory management is generally categorized as either automatic memory management, usually involving [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]], or [[manual memory management]].

=== {{Anchor|DYNAMIC|HEAP|ALLOCATION}}Dynamic memory allocation ===
[[File:External Fragmentation.svg|thumb|450px|An example of external fragmentation]]
{{See also|C dynamic memory allocation}}

The task of fulfilling an allocation request consists of locating a block of unused memory of sufficient size. Memory requests are satisfied by allocating portions from a large pool of memory called the ''heap'' or ''free store''.{{efn|Not to be confused with the unrelated [[heap (data structure)|heap]] data structure.}} At any given time, some parts of the heap are in use, while some are "free" (unused) and thus available for future allocations.

Several issues complicate the implementation, such as [[fragmentation (computer)#External fragmentation|external fragmentation]], which arises when there are many small gaps between allocated memory blocks, which invalidates their use for an allocation request. The allocator's [[metadata (computing)|metadata]] can also inflate the size of (individually) small allocations. This is often managed by [[chunking (computing)|chunking]]. The memory management system must track outstanding allocations to ensure that they do not overlap and that no memory is ever "lost" (i.e. that there be no "[[memory leak]]").

==== Efficiency ====
The specific dynamic memory allocation algorithm implemented can impact performance significantly. A study conducted in 1994 by [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] illustrates the [[computational overhead|overheads]] involved for a variety of allocators. The lowest average [[instruction path length]] required to allocate a single memory slot was 52 (as measured with an instruction level [[Profiling (computer programming)|profiler]] on a variety of software).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1002/spe.4380240602| title = Memory allocation costs in large C and C++ programs| journal = Software: Practice and Experience| volume = 24| issue = 6| pages = 527–542| date=June 1994 | last1 = Detlefs | first1 = D. | last2 = Dosser | first2 = A. | last3 = Zorn | first3 = B. | url = http://www.eecs.northwestern.edu/~robby/uc-courses/15400-2008-spring/spe895.pdf| citeseerx = 10.1.1.30.3073}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Implementations ====
Since the precise location of the allocation is not known in advance, the memory is accessed indirectly, usually through a [[Pointer (computer programming)|pointer]] [[reference (computer science)|reference]]. The specific algorithm used to organize the memory area and allocate and deallocate chunks is interlinked with the [[kernel (computing)|kernel]], and may use any of the following methods:

===== {{Anchor|FIXED-SIZE}}Fixed-size blocks allocation =====
{{main|Memory pool}}

Fixed-size blocks allocation, also called memory pool allocation, uses a [[free list]] of fixed-size blocks of memory (often all of the same size). This works well for simple [[embedded system]]s where no large objects need to be allocated, but suffers from [[Fragmentation (computing)|fragmentation]], especially with long memory addresses. However, due to the significantly reduced overhead this method can substantially improve performance for objects that need frequent allocation / de-allocation and is often used in [[video games]].

===== Buddy blocks =====
{{details|Buddy memory allocation}}

In this system, memory is allocated into several pools of memory instead of just one, where each pool represents blocks of memory of a certain [[power of two]] in size, or blocks of some other convenient size progression. All blocks of a particular size are kept in a sorted [[linked list]] or [[Tree data structure|tree]] and all new blocks that are formed during allocation are added to their respective memory pools for later use. If a smaller size is requested than is available, the smallest available size is selected and split. One of the resulting parts is selected, and the process repeats until the request is complete. When a block is allocated, the allocator will start with the smallest sufficiently large block to avoid needlessly breaking blocks. When a block is freed, it is compared to its buddy. If they are both free, they are combined and placed in the correspondingly larger-sized buddy-block list.

===== Slab allocation =====
{{main|Slab allocation}}

This memory allocation mechanism preallocates memory chunks suitable to fit objects of a certain type or size.&lt;ref name=silberschatz&gt;{{cite book|author1=Abraham Silberschatz|authorlink1=Abraham Silberschatz|author2=Peter B. Galvin|title=Operating system concepts|publisher=Wiley|year=2004|isbn=0-471-69466-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; These chunks are called caches and the allocator only has to keep track of a list of free cache slots. Constructing an object will use the any one of the free cache slots and destructing an object will add a slot back to the free cache slot list. This technique alleviates memory fragmentation and is efficient as there is no need to search for a suitable portion of memory, as any open slot will suffice.

===== Stack allocation =====
{{main|Stack-based memory allocation}}

{{expand section|date=November 2016}}

=== Automatic variables  ===
{{main|Automatic variable}}
In many programming language implementations, all variables declared within a procedure (subroutine, or function) are local to that function; the runtime environment for the program automatically allocates memory for these variables on program execution entry to the procedure, and automatically releases that memory when the procedure is exited. Special declarations may allow local variables to retain values between invocations of the procedure, or may allow local variables to be accessed by other procedures. The automatic allocation of local variables makes [[Recursion (computer science)|recursion]] possible, to a depth limited by available memory.  

==== Garbage collection ====
{{main|Garbage collection (computer science)}}
Garbage collection is a strategy for automatically detecting memory allocated to objects that are no longer usable in a program, and returning that allocated memory to a pool of free memory locations. This method is in contrast to "manual" memory management where a programmer explicitly  codes memory requests and memory releases in the program. While automatic garbage has the advantages of reducing programmer workload and preventing certain kinds of memory allocation bugs, garbage collection does require memory resources of its own, and can compete with the application program for processor time.

== Systems with virtual memory ==
{{Main|Memory protection|Shared memory (interprocess communication)}}

[[Virtual memory]] is a method of decoupling the memory organization from the physical hardware. The applications operate on memory via ''virtual addresses''. Each attempt by the application to access a particular virtual memory address results in the virtual memory address being translated to an actual ''physical address''.  In this way the addition of virtual memory enables granular control over memory systems and methods of access.

In virtual memory systems the operating system limits how a [[Process (computing)|process]] can access the memory. This feature, called [[memory protection]], can be used to disallow a process to read or write to memory that is not allocated to it, preventing malicious or malfunctioning code in one program from interfering with the operation of another.

Even though the memory allocated for specific processes is normally isolated, processes sometimes need to be able to share information. [[Shared memory (interprocess communication)|Shared memory]] is one of the fastest techniques for [[inter-process communication]].

Memory is usually classified by access rate into [[primary storage]] and [[secondary storage]]. Memory management systems, among other operations, also handle the moving of information between these two levels of memory.

'''''Modern Marvels''''' is an American worldwide [[television series]] that formerly aired on the [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]]. The program focuses on how technologies affect and are used in modern society. It is among History's first, and longest-running programs, having first aired on History's first day of broadcasting on January 1, 1995, and its last episode aired on April 11, 2015.

''Modern Marvels'' has produced over 650 one-hour episodes covering various topics involving (to list a few) [[science]], [[technology]], [[electronics]], [[mechanics]], [[engineering]], [[architecture]], [[industry]], [[mass production]], [[manufacturing]], and [[agriculture]]. Each episode typically discusses the history and production of several related items; for instance, an episode on [[distilled spirit]]s discusses the production of [[bourbon whiskey|bourbon]] in [[Kentucky]], [[scotch whisky]] in [[Scotland]], and [[tequila]] in [[Mexico]]. To fit the network's format, ''Modern Marvels'' focuses a significant portion of the episode on the [[history]] of the subject.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.com/home.do] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080912200945/http://www.history.com/home.do |date=September 12, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show began to premiere new episodes in January 2010, not having done so through all of 2009.&lt;ref name=episodes&gt;[http://www.history.com/shows/modern-marvels/episodes Modern Marvels Episode Guide]. History.com.&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2010, History Channel began to air older episodes that had been edited to fit a 30-minute time slot, under the title ''Modern Marvels: Essentials''.

In October 2011, ''Modern Marvels'' began airing first-run episodes on [[H2 (TV channel)|History 2]] (formerly History International) in addition to its main run on History Channel.

Reruns of the series currently air on the digital broadcast network [[Quest_(U.S._TV_network)|Quest]].

==''Engineering Disasters''==
{{distinguish|Extreme Engineering}}
Occasionally, ''Modern Marvels'' aired a special [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] called ''Engineering Disasters''. These periodic episodes describe the circumstances of situations in which technology does not work correctly, such as building collapses and airplane crashes, resulting in spectacular (and sometimes fatal) failures. Including an episode on [[New Orleans]] and another on the 1970s,  24 original ''Engineering Disasters'' episodes have been  on ''Modern Marvels''. The packaging on the box set of ''Engineering Disasters'' 4-20 plus New Orleans describes the series as such: "Dark clouds with silver linings, ''Modern Marvels: Engineering Disasters'' presents the tragic, yet invaluable, handmaidens of technological progress." &lt;ref&gt;Modern Marvels: Engineering Disasters - (5 DVD set, back panel)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Modern Marvels.JPG|thumb|left|A former title screenshot of ''Modern Marvels'']]

==Introduction==
Distinct from other History Channel series, the introduction of ''Modern Marvels'' features visuals and sounds of a [[Screw|bolt]] being turned by a ratchet [[wrench]], followed by a partially [[computer-generated imagery|computer-generated]] sequence involving [[construction worker]]s building and hanging the title.

==Narration==
Several [[narrator]]s were used in the history of the series. The last and longest-running is [[Lloyd Sherr|Max Raphael]], who has also narrated other History Channel series, such as ''[[Command Decisions]].''

The History Channel has repackaged some episodes that originally aired in other [[television series|series]] and stand-alone [[television special|specials]] into episodes of ''Modern Marvels'', such as ''[[Ice Road Truckers]]'', which originally aired in 2000 as part of the series ''[[Suicide Missions]]''. These episodes are not narrated by Raphael.

==Production==
[[Bruce Nash]] is credited with creating the series. [[Don Cambou]] has acted as [[executive producer]] on over 350 episodes for Actuality Productions, the production company behind the series.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6903">'''Moisture vapor transmission rate''' ('''MVTR'''), also '''water vapor transmission rate''' ('''WVTR'''), is a measure of the passage of water vapor through a substance.

There are many industries where moisture control is critical.   Moisture sensitive [[food]]s and [[pharmaceutical]]s  are put in [[packaging]] with controlled MVTR to achieve the required [[Quality (business)|quality]], [[safety]], and [[shelf life]].  In [[clothing]], MVTR as a measure of breathability has contributed to greater comfort for wearers of clothing for outdoor activity. The [[building material]]s industry also manages the moisture barrier properties in architectural components to ensure the correct moisture levels in the internal spaces of buildings. [[Optoelectronic]] devices based on organic material, generally named [[OLED]]s, need an encapsulation with low values of WVTR to guarantee same performances over the device lifetime.

==Measurement==
There are various techniques to measure MVTR, ranging from [[gravimetric]] techniques that measure the gain or loss of moisture by mass, to highly sophisticated instrumental techniques that in some designs can measure extremely low transmission rates. Special care has to be taken in measuring porous substances such as fabrics, as some techniques are not appropriate. For very low levels, many techniques do not have adequate resolution. Numerous [[international standard|standard]] methods are described in [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]], [[ASTM]], [[British Standards|BS]], [[DIN]] etc.—these are quite often industry-specific. Instrument manufacturers are often able to provide test methods developed to fully exploit the specific design which they are selling. The search for the most appropriate instrument is a zealous task which is in itself part of the measurement.&lt;ref name="wvtrtestultrabarriers"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mocon.com/pdf/permeation/wvtrtestultrabarriers.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413141950/http://www.mocon.com/pdf/permeation/wvtrtestultrabarriers.pdf |archivedate=2014-04-13 |df= }}, Water Vapor Permeation Testing of Ultra-Barriers: Limitations of Current Methods and Advancements Resulting in Increased Sensitivity, M. Stevens et Al.&lt;/ref&gt;

The conditions under which the measurement is made has a considerable influence on the result. Both the temperature and humidity gradients across the sample need to be measured, controlled and recorded with the result. An MVTR result without specifying these conditions is almost meaningless. Certainly no two results should be compared unless the conditions are known. 
The most common international unit for the MVTR is g/m²/day. In the USA, g/100in²/day is also in use, which is 0.064516 (approximately 1/15) of the value of g/m²/day units. Typical rates in aluminium foil laminates may be as low as 0.001 g/m²/day, whereas the rate in fabrics can measure up to several thousand g/m²/day.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Often, barrier testing is conducted on a sheet of material. Calculations based on that can be useful when designing completed structures, clothing, and packages.  Seams, creases, access points, and heat seals are critical to end-use performance.  For example, the glass of a bottle may have an effective total barrier, but the [[screw cap]] closure and the closure liner might not.  Performance [[verification and validation]] of complete containers, structures,  or irregular objects is often recommended.

For the special case of [[OLED]]s, where the levels of allowed permeation are in the 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;g/m²/day level

'''Monolithic Memories, Inc.''' ('''MMI''') produced [[bipolar junction transistor|bipolar]] PROMs, [[programmable logic device]]s, and logic circuits (including [[7400 series|7400 series TTL]]).

A team of MMI engineers,under the direction of Ze'ev Drori and  headed by [[John Birkner]] and H. T. Chua, invented the class of devices known as [[Programmable Array Logic]] ('''PAL''').

MMI was founded in 1969 by former [[Fairchild Semiconductor]] engineer [[Ze'ev Drori]], later the President and CEO of [[Tesla Motors]]. In 1987, under the stewardship of President [[Irwin Federman]], it was merged with [[Advanced Micro Devices]] in a $442 million stock swap&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1987-05-04/business/fi-4817_1_chip-industry Los Angeles Times: "Synergy of Contrasting Personalities Behind Chip Merger" by DONNA K.

The first attempts in building permanent '''movie theaters'''&lt;ref&gt;The term "movie theater" defines in this article a room with the permit required to show films to the populace and which is permanently used solely for this purpose, according to its definition by Kurt Berglund in "Stockholms alla biografer" p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; '''in [[Stockholm]] '''were made in the end of the 1890s when the [[cinematograph]] had been demonstrated at [[General Art and Industrial Exposition of Stockholm (1897)|General Art and Industrial Exposition of Stockholm in 1897]]. Prior to the demonstration, only travellers demonstrated the concept of the movie theater as a form of entertainment.

In 1905, the city had ten movie theaters, and by the end of 1909 the number had risen to 25 permanent movie theaters. The highest number of movie theaters operating at the same time in Stockholm City was 110. In 2009, the number of movie theatres had declined to a dozen or less. The highest number of people visiting movie theaters in Stockholm was 16,8 million, which was noted in 1956.

The city's oldest movie theater, which still operates today is Zita, which opened under the name ''Vinter-Palatset ''(''the Winter Palace'') in 1913. The most beautiful movie theater is the Skandia Theater, which opened in 1923 and was built according to architect [[Gunnar Asplund]]s plans. It was described by art experts at the time as a masterpiece, and is one of the few remaining movie theaters in the city that can only show one film at a time. The Skandia Theater was renovated to its original condition in 2001, and is protected under the Cultural Environment Protection Act.

'''Nair''' is a [[hair removal]] product manufactured by [[Church &amp; Dwight]]. It was purchased from [[Carter-Wallace]] in 2001.

The brand is mainly known for its [[Chemical depilatory|depilatories]] that work by breaking the [[disulfide bond]]s of the [[keratin]] molecules in hair. This reduces the [[Ultimate tensile strength|tensile strength]] of the keratin so greatly that the hair can be wiped away. Nair's slogans include: ''"The Less That You Wear, the More You Need Nair!"''; ''"Like Never Before"''; and ''"We wear short shorts, Nair for short shorts"''. The initial ad for the "short shorts" commercial won a [[Clio Awards | Clio]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.naircare.com/en/Women/Heritage&lt;/ref&gt;  It was based on the 1958 song "[[Short Shorts]]".  Nair is a [[portmanteau]] of "No hair."

==Active ingredients==
Two of the active ingredients are [[calcium hydroxide]] (slaked lime) and [[sodium hydroxide]] (lye), which raise the pH of hair, chemically breaking it down. Some formulations also contain potassium thioglycolate, which breaks down the disulphide bonds in the hair's keratin thus weakening it enough to be simply wiped away. Products such as Nair often combine softening agents such as [[mineral oil]] to help offset the harsh active ingredients.

{{Nanotechnology}}

A '''''nanofoundry''''' is considered to be a [[foundry]] that performs on a scale similar to [[nanotechnology]]. This concept makes it similar to the role that the [[Molecular assembler|nanofactory]] would play because it is considered to be a [[factory]] that operates on that same scale model. The closest thing that nature has to a nanofoundry is the simple [[Cell (biology)|biological cell]].&lt;ref name="futurehistorian"&gt;[http://historianofthefuture.com/biocnvrg.html ''Bioconvergence - Progenitor of the Nanotechnology Age''] at Historian of the Future&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Summary==
===General information===
''[[In silico]]'' biology attempts to duplicate nature by creating a virtual cell with the complete cycle of metabolism.&lt;ref name="futurehistorian"/&gt; The idea of creating an artificial cell along with working nanofoundries is highlighted in the phenomena of [[bioconvergence]]; which may advance us from the [[Information Age]] to the "Nanotechnology Age.&lt;ref name="futurehistorian"/&gt;" Nanofoundries and artificial cells are creating a world where [[health care]], the very definition of "medicine", along with [[life]] itself is entering a state of transition.&lt;ref name="futurehistorian"/&gt; This phenomenon is directly in parallel with changes in the procedures used in [[agriculture]], managing our bioresources, ultimately leading up to the ''de facto'' equivalent of [[Bioresource engineering|bio-engineering]] entire ecosystems from scratch.&lt;ref name="futurehistorian"/&gt;

{{As of|2011}} the latest area of research involved using both micro- and nano-focused [[ion beam]]s is found using [[Nanorobotics|nanomachining]].&lt;ref name="usurrey"&gt;[http://www.nanotechnology.surrey.ac.uk/research/nanofoundry ''Nanofoundry''] at University of Surrey (United Kingdom)&lt;/ref&gt; Preliminary studies have indicated that tissues can be successfully grown on three-dimensional structures while using ion beams on a substrate.&lt;ref name="usurrey"/&gt;

On a larger scale, materials that appear to be smooth still have an abrasive appearance to them.&lt;ref name="physorg"&gt;[http://www.physorg.com/news186916551.html ''Nano-foundry technique yields ultra-durable probes from diamond''] at Physorg.com&lt;/ref&gt; Using the nanoscale, however, [[atom]]s rub off one a time.&lt;ref name="physorg"/&gt; This creates new challenges for [[researcher]]s who build their devices that are only 10 atoms wide.&lt;ref name="physorg"/&gt;

===Current progress===
One of the first nanofoundries has been set up at the [[University of Madras]] in [[Chennai]], [[Tamil Nadu]], [[India]].&lt;ref name="usefulproducts"&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-08-14/chennai/28301715_1_w-selvamurthy-drdo-development-organisation ''DRDO to set up nano foundry in Madras varsity''] at India Times&lt;/ref&gt; Knowledge about nanotechnology would be converted into useful [[Final goods|consumer good]]s through the usage of nanofoundries.&lt;ref name="usefulproducts"/&gt; Scientists do not want nanotechnology to be confined to publishing [[Academic publishing|research paper]]s in journals when it could be useful for creating nanotechnology-enhanced consumer products that would be beneficial in our 21st century society.&lt;ref name="usefulproducts"/&gt; By converting the nanotechnology curriculum of the major universities into a more industry-oriented format, it makes the technology more practical for employers as well as consumers.&lt;ref name="usefulproducts"/&gt;

The ability to grow more complex structures with a high ratio allows for [[Pharmaceutical drug|drug]] release devices, [[biosensor]]s, [[nanoreactor]]s, and other countless discoveries.&lt;ref name="usurrey"/&gt; During the following decades to come, researchers will scramble to construct the world's first nuclear [[nanobeam]] complex.&lt;ref name="usurrey"/&gt; This facility would offer state-of-the-art facilities to a wide range of disciplines; including the conventional sciences.&lt;ref name="usurrey"/&gt;

Commercial manufacturing could easily be scaled up thanks to nanofoundries.&lt;ref name="physorg"/&gt; Nanofactories will most likely use metal nanoparticles instead of glass, plastic or rare earth minerals that are currently used to make most of our products.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mlive.com/prnewswire/index.ssf?/mlive/story/?catSetID=&amp;catID=&amp;nrid=189894961&amp;page=51 Six USC Research Teams Complete Startup Boot Camp and Receive Nearly $500K to Commercialize Technologies] at Michigan Live&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Perfume''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|p|ɜːr|f|j|uː|m}}, {{IPAc-en|US|p|ər|ˈ|f|j|uː|m}}; {{lang-fr|parfum}}) is a mixture of fragrant [[essential oil]]s or [[aroma compound]]s, [[Fixative (perfumery)|fixative]]s and [[solvent]]s, used to give the human body, animals, food, objects, and living-spaces an agreeable [[scent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/perfume|title= Perfume – Definition and More from Dictionary|work= merriam-webster.com}}wtf
&lt;/ref&gt;
It is usually in liquid form and used to give a pleasant scent to a person's body.
Ancient texts and archaeological excavations show the use of perfumes in some of the earliest human civilizations. Modern perfumery began in the late 19th century with the commercial synthesis of aroma compounds such as [[vanillin]] or [[coumarin]], which allowed for the composition of perfumes with smells previously unattainable solely from natural aromatics alone.

==History==
{{main|History of perfume}}

[[File:Egypte louvre 021.jpg|thumbnail|left|Egyptian scene depicting the preparation of lily perfume, 4th century BC]]

The word ''perfume'' derives from the Latin ''perfumare'', meaning "to smoke through". Perfumery, as the art of making perfumes, began in ancient [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], and was further refined by the [[ancient Rome|Romans]] and the Arabs.

The world's first-recorded [[chemist]] is considered a woman named [[Tapputi]], a perfume maker mentioned in a [[cuneiform]] tablet from the 2nd millennium BC in Mesopotamia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Strathern, Paul |title= Mendeleyev's Dream – The Quest For the Elements|location= New York | publisher= Berkley Books|year= 2000|isbn= 0-425-18467-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; She distilled flowers, oil, and [[Acorus calamus|calamus]] with other [[aromatic]]s, then filtered and put them back in the still several times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Levey|first=Martin|title= Early Arabic Pharmacology: An Introduction Based on Ancient and Medieval Sources|publisher= Brill Archive|year=1973|page= 9|isbn= 90-04-03796-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In India, perfume and perfumery existed in the [[Indus civilization]] (3300 BC – 1300 BC). One of the earliest distillations of [[Ittar]] was mentioned in the Hindu Ayurvedic text ''[[Charaka Samhita]]'' and ''[[Sushruta Samhita]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Agriculture Diversification: Problems and Perspectives|author1= A.K.

They were discovered in an ancient perfumery, a {{convert|3230|sqft|m2|-2|adj=on|order=flip|sp=us}} factory&lt;ref name=NG070329/&gt; housing at least 60 stills, mixing bowls, funnels, and perfume bottles.

In the 9th century the [[Alchemy and chemistry in Islam|Arab chemist]] [[Al-Kindi]] (Alkindus) wrote the ''Book of the Chemistry of Perfume and Distillations'', which contained more than a hundred recipes for fragrant [[oils]], salves, aromatic waters, and substitutes or imitations of costly drugs. The book also described 107 methods and recipes for perfume-making and perfume-making equipment, such as the [[alembic]] (which still bears its Arabic name.&lt;ref&gt;al-Hassani, Woodcok and Saoud (2006) 1001 Inventions; Muslim Heritage in Our World, FSTC, p.22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author= M.

[[File:Arheologicheski-Perfume.jpg|thumb|A Byzantine [[alembic]] used to distil perfumes.]]

The Persian chemist Ibn Sina (also known as [[Avicenna]]) introduced the process of extracting oils from flowers by means of [[distillation]], the procedure most commonly used today. He first experimented with the [[rose]]. Until his discovery, liquid perfumes consisted of mixtures of oil and crushed herbs or petals, which made a strong blend. [[Rose water]] was more delicate, and immediately became popular. Both the raw ingredients and the distillation technology significantly influenced western perfumery and scientific developments, particularly [[chemistry]].

The art of perfumery was known in western Europe from 1221, taking into account the [[monk]]s' recipes of Santa Maria delle Vigne or [[Santa Maria Novella]] of [[Florence]], Italy.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} In the east, the [[Hungarians]] produced in 1370 a perfume made of scented oils blended in an alcohol solution – best known as [[Hungary Water]] – at the behest of [[Elisabeth of Poland|Queen Elizabeth of Hungary]]. The art of perfumery prospered in [[Renaissance]] Italy, and in the 16th century the personal perfumer to [[Catherine de' Medici]] (1519–1589), Rene the [[Florence|Florentine]] (Renato il fiorentino), took Italian refinements to France. His laboratory was connected with her apartments by a secret passageway, so that no formulae could be stolen en route. Thanks to Rene, France quickly became one of the European centers of perfume and [[cosmetics]] manufacture. Cultivation of flowers for their perfume essence, which had begun in the 14th century, grew into a major industry in the south of France.

Between the 16th and 17th centuries, perfumes were used primarily by the wealthy to mask [[body odor]]s resulting from infrequent bathing. Partly due to this patronage, the perfume industry developed. In 1693, Italian barber Giovanni Paolo Feminis created a perfume water called Aqua Admirabilis,&lt;ref&gt;Compare: {{cite book

By the 18th century the [[Grasse]] region of France, [[Sicily]], and [[Calabria]] (in Italy) were growing aromatic plants to provide the growing perfume industry with raw materials. Even today, Italy and France remain the center of European perfume design and [[trade]].

Perfume types reflect the concentration of aromatic compounds in a solvent, which in fine fragrance is typically [[ethanol]] or a mix of water and ethanol. Various sources differ considerably in the definitions of perfume types. The intensity and longevity of a perfume is based on the concentration, intensity and longevity of the aromatic compounds, or perfume oils, used. As the percentage of aromatic compounds increases, so does the intensity and longevity of the scent. Specific terms are used to describe a fragrance's approximate concentration by the percent of perfume oil in the volume of the final product. The most widespread terms&lt;ref name="NYT71218"&gt;{{cite news |author1=Tynan Sinks |title=The Difference Between Perfume, Cologne and Other Fragrances |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/12/smarter-living/differences-perfume-cologne-fragrance.html?fb=0&amp;recb=home-living.control&amp;recid=17KSsjadYlQApm7TCIQPhRUe8tk&amp;contentCollection=smarter-living&amp;mData=articles%255B%255D%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.nytimes.com%252F2018%252F07%252F12%252Fsmarter-living%252Fdifferences-perfume-cologne-fragrance.html%253Ffb%253D0%2526recb%253Dhome-living.control%2526recid%253D17KSsjadYlQApm7TCIQPhRUe8tk%26articles%255B%255D%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.nytimes.com%252F2018%252F07%252F11%252Fsmarter-living%252Fhow-to-start-knitting.html%253Ffb%253D0%2526recb%253Dhome-living.control%2526recid%253D17KSsjadYlQApm7TCIQPhRUe8tk&amp;hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=smarterLiving-promo-region&amp;region=smarterLiving-promo-region&amp;WT.nav=smarterLiving-promo-region |accessdate=July 13, 2018 |work=The New York Times |date=July 12, 2018 |quote=You’ll see all sorts of names in the fragrance section: perfume, eau de toilette, parfum, eau de cologne. What makes them different — and in many cases, more expensive?}}&lt;/ref&gt; are:
* '''parfum''' or '''extrait''', in English known as perfume extract, pure perfume, or simply perfume: 15–40% aromatic compounds ([[International Fragrance Association|IFRA]]: typically ~20%);
* '''esprit de parfum''' (ESdP): 15–30% aromatic compounds, a seldom used strength concentration in between EdP and perfume;
* '''eau de parfum''' (EdP) or '''parfum de toilette''' (PdT) (The strength usually sold as "perfume"&lt;ref name="NYT71218"/&gt;): 10–20% aromatic compounds (typically ~15%); sometimes called "eau de perfume" or "millésime"; parfum de toilette is a less common term, most popular in the 1980s, that is generally analogous to eau de parfum;
* '''[[eau de toilette]]''' (EdT): 5–15% aromatic compounds (typically ~10%);
* '''[[eau de Cologne]]''' (EdC): often simply called cologne: 3–8% aromatic compounds (typically ~5%); see below for more information on the confusing nature of the term "cologne";
* '''eau fraiche''': products sold as "splashes", "mists", "veils" and other imprecise terms. Generally these products contain 3% or less aromatic compounds and are diluted with water rather than oil or alcohol.&lt;ref name="NYT71218"/&gt;

There is much confusion over the term "cologne", which has three meanings. The first and oldest definition refers to a family of fresh, citrus-based fragrances distilled using extracts from citrus, floral, and woody ingredients. Supposedly these were first developed in the early 18th century in [[Cologne, Germany]], hence the name. This type of "classical cologne" describes unisex compositions "which are basically citrus blends and do not have a perfume parent."&lt;ref name="Glossary C"&gt;{{cite web|title=Glossary (C) |url=http://www.fragrance.org/glossary.php?l=C |publisher=The Fragrance Foundation |accessdate=7 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100731203552/http://www.fragrance.org/glossary.php?l=C |archivedate=31 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include Mäurer &amp; Wirtz's ''[[4711]]'' (created in 1799), and Guerlain's ''Eau de Cologne Impériale'' (1853).

In the 20th century, the term took on a second meaning. Fragrance companies began to offer lighter, less concentrated interpretations of their existing perfumes, making their products available to a wider range of customers. Guerlain, for example, offered an Eau de Cologne version of its flagship perfume ''[[Shalimar (perfume)|Shalimar]]''. In contrast to classical colognes, this type of modern cologne is a lighter, diluted, less concentrated interpretation of a more concentrated product, typically a pure parfum. The cologne version is often the lightest concentration from a line of fragrance products.&lt;ref name="Glossary C"/&gt;

Finally, the term "cologne" has entered the English language as a generic, overarching term to denote a fragrance worn by a man, regardless of its concentration. The actual product worn by a man may technically be an eau de toilette, but he may still say that he "wears cologne". A similar problem surrounds the term "perfume", which can be used a generic sense to refer to fragrances marketed to women, whether or not the fragrance is actually an extrait.

Classical colognes first appeared in Europe in the 17th century. The first fragrance labeled a "parfum" extract with a high concentration of aromatic compounds was Guerlain's ''[[Jicky]]'' in 1889. Eau de Toilette appeared alongside parfum around the turn of the century. The EdP concentration and terminology is the most recent. Parfum de toilette and EdP began to appear in the 1970s and gained popularity in the 1980s.

===Imprecise terminology===
[[File:J.B. Filz Vienna 2007.jpg|thumb|upright|J.B. Filz in Vienna. Perfumeries with long traditions, such as J.B. Filz, created their own scents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wien.info/en/lifestyle-scene/trendy/scents-from-vienna|title=Scents from Vienna|work=wien.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The wide range in the percentages of aromatic compounds that may be present in each concentration means that the terminology of extrait, EdP, EdT, and EdC is quite imprecise. Although an EdP will often be more concentrated than an EdT and in turn an EdC, this is not always the case. Different perfumeries or perfume houses assign different amounts of oils to each of their perfumes. Therefore, although the oil concentration of a perfume in EdP dilution will necessarily be higher than the same perfume in EdT from within a company's same range, the actual amounts vary among perfume houses. An EdT from one house may have a higher concentration of aromatic compounds than an EdP from another.

Furthermore, some fragrances with the same ''product name'' but having a different ''concentration'' may not only differ in their dilutions, but actually use different perfume oil mixtures altogether. For instance, in order to make the EdT version of a fragrance brighter and fresher than its EdP, the EdT oil may be "tweaked" to contain slightly more top notes or fewer base notes. ''[[Chanel No. 5]]'' is a good example: its parfum, EdP, EdT, and now-discontinued EdC concentrations are in fact different compositions (the parfum dates to 1921, whereas the EdP was not developed until the 1980s). In some cases, words such as ''extrême'', ''intense'', or ''concentrée'' that might indicate a higher aromatic concentration are actually completely different fragrances, related only because of a similar perfume ''accord''. An example of this is Chanel's ''Pour Monsieur'' and ''Pour Monsieur Concentrée''.

As a rule of thumb, women's fragrances tend to have higher levels of aromatic compounds than men's fragrances. Fragrances marketed to men are typically sold as EdT or EdC, rarely as EdP or perfume extracts. Women's fragrances used to be common in all levels of concentration, but today are mainly seen in parfum, EdP and EdT concentrations.

===Solvent types===
Perfume oils are often diluted with a solvent, though this is not always the case, and its necessity is disputed. By far the most common solvent for perfume is oil dilution is an alcohol solution, typically a mixture of ethanol and water or a [[rectified spirit]]. Perfume oil can also be diluted by means of neutral-smelling oils such as fractionated [[coconut oil]], or liquid [[wax]]es such as [[jojoba oil]].

===Applying fragrances===
The conventional application of pure perfume (parfum extrait) in Western cultures is at pulse points, such as behind the ears, the nape of the neck, and the insides of wrists, elbows and knees, so that the pulse point will warm the perfume and release fragrance continuously. According to perfumer [[Sophia Grojsman]] behind the knees is the ideal point to apply perfume in order that the scent may rise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://forward.com/news/144873/perfume-nose-conjures-up-perfect-scents/ | title=Perfume 'Nose' Conjures Up Perfect Scents | publisher=forward.com | accessdate=8 August 2015 | author=Berger, Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern perfume industry encourages the practice of layering fragrance so that it is released in different intensities depending upon the time of the day. Lightly scented products such as bath oil, shower gel, and body lotion are recommended for the morning; eau de toilette is suggested for the afternoon; and perfume applied to the pulse points for evening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Agata A.

==Describing a perfume==
[[File:Fougère Royale by Paul Parquet - Bottle.jpg|thumb|upright|An original bottle of ''Fougère Royale'' by [[Houbigant Parfum|Houbigant]]. Created by [[Paul Parquet]] in 1884, it is one of the most important modern perfumes and inspired the eponymous [[Fougère]] class of fragrances.]]

[[File:Fragrance pyramid.svg|thumb|upright|Fragrance pyramid]]

The precise formulae of commercial perfumes are kept [[Trade secret|secret]]. Even if they were widely published, they would be dominated by such complex ingredients and odorants that they would be of little use in providing a guide to the general consumer in description of the ''experience'' of a scent. Nonetheless, connoisseurs of perfume can become extremely skillful at identifying components and origins of scents in the same manner as wine experts.&lt;ref name=Burr&gt;{{cite book | author=Burr, Chandler | title=The Emperor of Scent: A Story of Perfume, Obsession, and the Last Mystery of the Senses | year=2003 | location=New York | publisher=Random House | isbn=0-375-50797-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most practical way to start describing a perfume is according to the elements of the ''fragrance notes'' of the scent or the "family" it belongs to, all of which affect the overall impression of a perfume from first application to the last lingering hint of scent.&lt;ref name=Fortineau&gt;Perfume connoisseurs speak of a fragrance's "sillage", or the discernible trail it leaves in the air when applied. Fortineau, Anne-Dominique (2004). "Chemistry Perfumes Your Daily Life". ''Journal of Chemical Education''.81(1)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Edwards1&gt;Edwards, Michael (2006). "Fragrances of the World 2006". ''Crescent House Publishing''. {{ISBN|0-9756097-1-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trail of scent left behind by a person wearing perfume is called its ''sillage'', after the French word for "[[wake]]", as in the trail left by a boat in water.

===Fragrance notes===
{{main| Note (perfumery)}}

Perfume is described in a musical metaphor as having three sets of ''notes'', making the harmonious scent ''accord''. The notes unfold over time, with the immediate impression of the top note leading to the deeper middle notes, and the base notes gradually appearing as the final stage. These notes are created carefully with knowledge of the evaporation process of the perfume.
*'''Top notes''': Also called the '''''head notes'''''. The scents that are perceived immediately on application of a perfume. Top notes consist of small, light molecules that evaporate quickly. They form a person's initial impression of a perfume and thus are very important in the selling of a perfume. Examples of top notes include mint, lavender and coriander.
*'''Middle notes''': Also referred to as '''''heart notes'''''. The scent of a perfume that emerges just prior to the dissipation of the top note. The middle note compounds form the "''heart''" or main body of a perfume and act to mask the often unpleasant initial impression of base notes, which become more pleasant with time. Examples of middle notes include seawater, sandalwood and jasmine.
*'''Base notes''': The scent of a perfume that appears close to the departure of the middle notes. The base and middle notes together are the main theme of a perfume. Base notes bring depth and solidity to a perfume. Compounds of this class of scents are typically rich and "deep" and are usually not perceived until 30 minutes after application. Examples of base notes include tobacco, amber and musk.
The scents in the top and middle notes are influenced by the base notes; conversely, the scents of the base notes will be altered by the types of fragrance materials used as middle notes. Manufacturers who publish perfume notes typically do so with the fragrance components presented as a ''fragrance pyramid''&lt;ref&gt;[https://blog.lebermuth.com/fragrance-101-understanding-the-fragrance-pyramid Fragrance 101 Understanding The Fragrance Pyramid]&lt;/ref&gt;, using imaginative and abstract terms for the components listed.

===Olfactive families===
Grouping perfumes can never be a completely objective or final process. Many fragrances contain aspects of different families. Even a perfume designated as "single flower", however subtle, will have undertones of other aromatics. "True" unitary scents can rarely be found in perfumes as it requires the perfume to exist only as a singular aromatic material.

Classification by olfactive family is a starting point for a description of a perfume, but it cannot by itself denote the specific characteristic of that perfume.

====Traditional====

[[File:Opium by YSL.jpg|thumb|upright|Opium by YSL, of amber or oriental fragrance class]]
[[File:Joy Jean Patou.jpg|thumb|upright|A floral bouquet, Joy from [[Jean Patou]]]]
The traditional classification which emerged around 1900 comprised the following categories:
*'''Single Floral''': Fragrances that are dominated by a scent from one particular flower; in French called a ''soliflore''. (e.g. [[Serge Lutens]]' ''Sa Majeste La Rose'', which is dominated by rose.)
*'''Floral Bouquet''': Is a combination of fragrance of several flowers in a perfume compound. Examples include ''Quelques Fleurs'' by [[Houbigant (perfume)|Houbigant]] and ''[[Joy (perfume)|Joy]]'' by [[Jean Patou]].
*'''Amber or "Oriental"''': A large fragrance class featuring the sweet slightly animalic scents of [[ambergris]] or [[labdanum]], often combined with [[vanilla]], [[tonka bean]], flowers and woods. Can be enhanced by camphorous oils and [[incense]] resins, which bring to mind [[Victorian era]] imagery of the Middle East and [[Far East]]. Traditional examples include [[Guerlain]]'s ''[[Shalimar (perfume)|Shalimar]]'', [[Yves Saint Laurent (brand)|Yves Saint Laurent]]'s ''[[Opium (perfume)|Opium]]'' and Chanel's ''Coco Mademoiselle''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chanel.com/en_US/fragrance-beauty/Fragrance-Coco-Mademoiselle-COCO-MADEMOISELLE-PARFUM-88207|title=Coco Mademoiselle from Chanel|publisher=www.chanel.com |accessdate=13 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Woody''': Fragrances that are dominated by woody scents, typically of [[agarwood]], [[sandalwood]], [[cedar wood|cedarwood]], and [[vetiver]]. Patchouli, with its [[camphor]]aceous smell, is commonly found in these perfumes. A traditional example here would be Myrurgia's ''Maderas De Oriente'' or [[Chanel]] ''Bois des Îles''. A modern example would be [[Balenciaga]] ''Rumba''.
*'''Leather''': A family of fragrances which features the scents of [[honey]], [[tobacco]], wood and wood [[tar]]s in its middle or base notes and a scent that alludes to leather. Traditional examples include [[Robert Piguet]]'s ''Bandit'' and [[Pierre Balmain|Balmain]]'s ''Jolie Madame''.
*'''[[Chypre]]''' ({{IPA-fr|ʃipʁ|IPA}}): Meaning ''[[Cyprus]]'' in French, this includes fragrances built on a similar accord consisting of [[bergamot orange|bergamot]], [[oakmoss]], and [[labdanum]]. This family of fragrances is named after the eponymous 1917 perfume by [[François Coty]], and one of the most famous extant examples is [[Guerlain]]'s ''[[Mitsouko (perfume)|Mitsouko]]''.
*'''[[Fougère]]''' ({{IPA-fr|fu.ʒɛʁ|IPA}}): Meaning ''[[fern]]'' in French, built on a base of [[lavender]], [[coumarin]] and [[oakmoss]]. [[Houbigant (perfume)|Houbigant]]'s ''Fougère Royale'' pioneered the use of this base. Many men's fragrances belong to this family of fragrances, which is characterized by its sharp herbaceous and woody scent. Some well-known modern fougères are [[Fabergé]] ''Brut'' and [[Guy Laroche]] ''Drakkar Noir''.

==== Modern ====
[[File:Perfume.ogv|thumb|Perfume being sprayed in the air.]]
Since 1945, due to great advances in the technology of perfume creation (i.e., compound design and synthesis) as well as the natural development of styles and tastes, new categories have emerged to describe modern scents:
*'''Bright Floral''': combining the traditional Single Floral &amp; Floral Bouquet categories. A good example would be [[Estée Lauder Companies|Estée Lauder]]'s ''Beautiful''.
*'''Green''': a lighter and more modern interpretation of the Chypre type, with pronounced cut grass, crushed green leaf and cucumber-like scents. Examples include Estée Lauder's ''Aliage'', Sisley's ''Eau de Campagne'', and Calvin Klein's ''Eternity''.
*'''Aquatic''', '''Oceanic''', or '''Ozonic''': the newest category in perfume history, first appearing in 1988 [[Davidoff]] ''[[Cool Water (perfume)|Cool Water]]'' (1988), Christian Dior's ''Dune'' (1991), and many others. A clean smell reminiscent of the ocean, leading to many of the modern [[androgynous]] perfumes. Generally contains [[calone]], a synthetic scent discovered in 1966, or other more recent synthetics. Also used to accent floral, oriental, and woody fragrances.
*'''Citrus''': An old fragrance family that until recently consisted mainly of "freshening" eau de colognes, due to the low tenacity of citrus scents. Development of newer fragrance compounds has allowed for the creation of primarily citrus fragrances. A good example here would be Faberge ''Brut''.
*'''Fruity''': featuring the aromas of fruits other than citrus, such as peach, cassis (black currant), mango, passion fruit, and others. A modern example here would be Ginestet ''Botrytis''.
*'''Gourmand''' ({{IPA-fr|ɡuʁmɑ̃|lang}}): scents with "edible" or "dessert"-like qualities. These often contain notes like vanilla, [[tonka bean]] and [[coumarin]], as well as synthetic components designed to resemble food flavors. A sweet example is [[Thierry Mugler]]'s ''Angel''.

====Fragrance wheel====
{{main|Fragrance wheel}}
[[File:Wheel2.gif|thumb|Fragrance Wheel perfume [[classification chart]], ver. 1983]]
The Fragrance wheel is a relatively new classification method that is widely used in retail and in the fragrance industry. The method was created in 1983 by [[Michael Edwards (fragrance expert)|Michael Edwards]], a consultant in the perfume industry, who designed his own scheme of fragrance classification. The new scheme was created in order to simplify fragrance classification and naming scheme, as well as to show the relationships between each of the individual classes.&lt;ref name="OGrantInterview"&gt;{{cite web |author= Osborne, Grant |date= 1 May 2001 |title= Interview with Michael Edwards |url= http://www.basenotes.net/interviews/int-medwards.html |accessdate= 17 December 2006 |publisher= Basenotes |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070206133603/http://www.basenotes.net/interviews/int-medwards.html |archivedate= 6 February 2007 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The five standard families consist of ''Floral'', ''Oriental'', ''Woody'', ''Aromatic Fougère'', and ''Fresh'', with the first four families borrowing from the classic terminology and the last consisting of newer bright and clean smelling citrus and oceanic fragrances that have arrived in the past generation due to improvements in fragrance technology. Each of the families are in turn divided into subgroups and arranged around a wheel.
In this classification scheme, ''Chanel No.5'', which is traditionally classified as an aldehydic floral, would be located under the Soft Floral sub-group, and amber scents would be placed within the Oriental group. As a class, [[chypre]] perfumes are more difficult to place since they would be located under parts of the Oriental and Woody families. For instance, Guerlain's ''Mitsouko'' is placed under Mossy Woods, but Hermès ''Rouge'', a chypre with more floral character, would be placed under Floral Oriental.

==Aromatics sources==

===Plant sources===
[[File:Citrus x limon Blüten und Schädlinge.JPG|thumb|upright|Citrus tree blossom]]
[[File:Myrrh.JPG|thumb|Resins in perfumery include [[myrrh]]]]
[[File:Frankincense 2005-12-31.jpg|thumb|Frankincense]]

Plants have long been used in perfumery as a source of essential oils and aroma compounds. These aromatics are usually [[secondary metabolites]] produced by plants as protection against [[herbivore]]s, infections, as well as to attract [[pollinator]]s. Plants are by far the largest source of fragrant compounds used in perfumery. The sources of these compounds may be derived from various parts of a plant. A plant can offer more than one source of aromatics, for instance the aerial portions and seeds of [[coriander]] have remarkably different odors from each other. [[Orange (fruit)|Orange]] leaves, blossoms, and fruit zest are the respective sources of [[petitgrain]], [[neroli]], and [[orange oil]]s.
* '''[[Bark (botany)|Bark]]''': Commonly used barks include [[cinnamon]] and [[cascarilla]]. The fragrant oil in [[sassafras]] root bark is also used either directly or purified for its main constituent, [[safrole]], which is used in the synthesis of other fragrant compounds.
* '''[[Flower]]s''' and '''[[blossom]]s''': Undoubtedly the largest and most common source of perfume aromatics. Includes the flowers of several species of [[rose]] and [[jasmine]], as well as [[osmanthus]], [[plumeria]], [[Acacia farnesiana|mimosa]], [[tuberose]], [[Narcissus (plant)|narcissus]], [[Pelargonium graveolens|scented geranium]], [[Vachellia farnesiana|cassie]], [[ambrette]] as well as the blossoms of [[citrus]] and [[ylang-ylang]] trees. Although not traditionally thought of as a flower, the unopened flower buds of the [[clove]] are also commonly used. Most orchid flowers are not commercially used to produce essential oils or absolutes, except in the case of [[vanilla]], an orchid, which must be pollinated first and made into seed pods before use in perfumery.
* '''[[Fruit]]s''': Fresh fruits such as [[apple]]s, [[strawberry|strawberries]], [[cherry|cherries]] rarely yield the expected odors when extracted; if such fragrance notes are found in a perfume, they are more likely to be of synthetic origin. Notable exceptions include blackcurrant leaf, [[litsea|litsea cubeba]], vanilla, and [[juniper|juniper berry]]. The most commonly used fruits yield their aromatics from the rind; they include citrus such as [[orange (fruit)|oranges]], [[lemon]]s, and [[lime (fruit)|limes]]. Although [[grapefruit]] rind is still used for aromatics, more and more commercially used grapefruit aromatics are artificially synthesized since the natural aromatic contains [[sulfur]] and its degradation product is quite unpleasant in smell.
* '''[[Leaves]]''' and '''[[twigs]]''': Commonly used for perfumery are [[lavender]] leaf, [[patchouli]], [[Common sage|sage]], [[violet (plant)|violets]], [[rosemary]], and citrus leaves. Sometimes leaves are valued for the "green" smell they bring to perfumes, examples of this include [[hay]] and [[tomato]] leaf.
* '''[[Resin]]s''': Valued since antiquity, resins have been widely used in [[incense]] and perfumery. Highly fragrant and antiseptic resins and resin-containing perfumes have been used by many cultures as medicines for a large variety of ailments. Commonly used resins in perfumery include [[labdanum]], [[frankincense]]/[[olibanum]], [[myrrh]], [[balsam of Peru]], [[benzoin (resin)|benzoin]]. [[Pine]] and [[fir]] resins are a particularly valued source of [[terpene]]s used in the [[organic synthesis]] of many other synthetic or naturally occurring aromatic compounds. Some of what is called [[amber]] and [[copal]] in perfumery today is the resinous secretion of fossil [[conifer]]s.
*'''[[Root]]s, [[rhizome]]s and [[bulb]]s''': Commonly used terrestrial portions in perfumery include [[iris (plant)|iris]] [[rhizome]]s, [[vetiver]] roots, various rhizomes of the [[ginger]] family.
* '''[[Seed]]s''': Commonly used seeds include [[tonka bean]], [[Daucus carota|carrot seed]], [[coriander]], [[caraway]], [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]], [[nutmeg]], [[mace (spice)|mace]], [[cardamom]], and [[anise]].
* '''[[Wood]]s''': Highly important in providing the base notes to a perfume, wood oils and distillates are indispensable in perfumery. Commonly used woods include [[sandalwood]], [[rosewood]], [[agarwood]], [[birch]], [[Cedrus|cedar]], [[juniper]], and [[pine]]. These are used in the form of macerations or dry-distilled (rectified) forms.
*'''Rom [[terpenes]]'''. Orchid scents

===Animal sources===

[[File:Ambergris.jpg|thumb|[[Ambergris]]]]
*'''[[Ambergris]]''': Lumps of [[oxidize]]d fatty compounds, whose precursors were secreted and expelled by the [[sperm whale]]. Ambergris should not be confused with [[amber|yellow amber]], which is used in jewelry. Because the harvesting of ambergris involves no harm to its animal source, it remains one of the few animalic fragrancing agents around which little controversy now exists.
*'''[[Castoreum]]''': Obtained from the odorous sacs of the North American beaver.

*'''[[Honeycomb]]''': From the honeycomb of the [[honeybee]]. Both beeswax and honey can be solvent extracted to produce an absolute. Beeswax is extracted with ethanol and the ethanol evaporated to produce beeswax absolute.
*'''[[Musk]]''': Originally derived from a gland (sac or pod) located between the genitals and the umbilicus of the Himalayan male [[musk deer]] Moschus moschiferus, it has now mainly been replaced by the use of [[synthetic musk]]s sometimes known as "white musk".

===Other natural sources===
* '''[[Lichen]]s''': Commonly used lichens include [[oakmoss]] and [[treemoss]] thalli.
* '''[[Brown algae|"Seaweed"]]''': Distillates are sometimes used as [[essential oil]] in perfumes. An example of a commonly used seaweed is ''[[Fucus vesiculosus]]'', which is commonly referred to as bladder wrack. Natural seaweed fragrances are rarely used due to their higher cost and lower potency than synthetics.

===Synthetic sources===
{{main| Aroma compound}}
Many modern perfumes contain [[chemical synthesis|synthesized]] odorants. Synthetics can provide fragrances which are not found in nature. For instance, [[Calone]], a compound of synthetic origin, imparts a fresh ozonous metallic marine scent that is widely used in contemporary perfumes. Synthetic aromatics are often used as an alternate source of compounds that are not easily obtained from natural sources. For example, [[linalool]] and [[coumarin]] are both naturally occurring compounds that can be inexpensively synthesized from [[terpenes]]. Orchid scents (typically ''[[salicylic acid|salicylates]]'') are usually not obtained directly from the plant itself but are instead synthetically created to match the fragrant compounds found in various orchids.

One of the most commonly used classes of synthetic aromatics by far are the [[synthetic musk|white musk]]s. These materials are found in all forms of commercial perfumes as a neutral background to the middle notes. These musks are added in large quantities to laundry detergents in order to give washed clothes a lasting "clean" scent.

The majority of the world's synthetic aromatics are created by relatively few [[:Category:Fragrance companies|companies]]. They include:
* [[International Flavors and Fragrances]] (IFF)
* [[Givaudan]]
* [[Firmenich]]
* [[Takasago International Corporation|Takasago]]
* [[Symrise]]
Each of these companies patents several processes for the production of aromatic synthetics annually.

===Characteristics===

|-
!|Variance
|Natural scents will vary from each supplier based on when and where they are harvested, how they are processed, and the extraction method itself. This means that a certain flower grown in Morocco and in France will smell different, even if the same method is used to grow, harvest, and extract the scent. As such, each perfumer will prefer flowers grown in one country over another, or one extraction method to the next. However, due to a natural scent's mixed composition, it is easy for unscrupulous suppliers to adulterate the actual raw materials by changing its ''source'' (adding Indian jasmine into Grasse jasmine) or the ''contents'' (adding linalool to rosewood) to increase their [[profit margin]].
|Much more consistent than natural aromatics. However, differences in organic synthesis may result in minute differences in concentration of impurities. If these impurities have low smell (detection) thresholds, the differences in the scent of the synthetic aromatic will be significant.
|-
!|Components
|Contains many different organic compounds, each adding a different note to the overall scent. Certain naturally derived substances have a long history of use, but this cannot always be used as an indicator of whether they are safe or not. Possible allergenic or carcinogenic compounds.

Sometimes [[Chirality (chemistry)|chiral]] mixtures of isomers, such as in the case of [[Iso E Super]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iso E Super® |publisher=International Flavors &amp; Fragrances |year=2007 |url=http://www.iff.com/Ingredients.nsf/0/E69A1213546C4F8B80256993003995C6 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080223080634/http://www.iff.com/Ingredients.nsf/0/E69A1213546C4F8B80256993003995C6 |archivedate=23 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the almost pure composition of one chemical compound, the same molecules found diluted in nature will have a different scent and effect on the body, if used undiluted.
|-
!|Scent uniqueness
|Reminiscent of its originating material, although extraction may capture a different "layer" of the scent, depending on the how the extraction method denatures the odoriferous compounds.
|Similar to natural scents yet different at the same time. Some synthetics attempt to mimic natural notes, while others explore the entire spectrum of scent. Novel scent compounds not found in nature will often be unique in their scent.
|-
!|Scent complexity
|Deep and complex fragrance notes. Soft, with subtle scent nuances. Highly valued for ideal composition.
|Pure and pronounced fragrance notes. Often monotonous in nature, yet reminiscent of other natural scents.
|-
!|Price
|Dependent on extraction method. More expensive, but not always, as prices are determined by the labor and difficulty of properly extracting each unit of the natural materials, as well as its quality. Typically the relationship between, longevity of a perfume, cost and the concentration of essential oils follows the graph below:
[[File:Cologne Strength vs. Cost vs. Cologne Concentration.jpg|thumb|This chart shows the typical relationship between price of perfume, its longevity and the concentration of essential oils.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cost Curve|url=http://www.topcolognesformen.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|Dependent on synthesis method. Generally cheaper, but not necessarily. Synthetic aromatics are not necessarily cheaper than naturals, with some synthetics being more costly than most natural ingredients due to various factors such as the long synthesis routes, low availability of precursor chemicals, and low overall yield. However, due to their low odor threshold, they should be diluted when making a perfume.

==Obtaining natural odorants==
{{main|Fragrance extraction}}
[[File:Itar vendor in Hyderabad.JPG|thumb|Itar (herbal perfume) vendor on the street of [[Hyderabad]], India, who can compose an original perfume for the customer]]
Before perfumes can be composed, the odorants used in various perfume compositions must first be obtained. Synthetic odorants are produced through [[organic synthesis]] and purified. Odorants from natural sources require the use of various methods to extract the aromatics from the raw materials. The results of the extraction are either [[essential oil]]s, absolutes, concretes, or butters, depending on the amount of [[wax]]es in the extracted product.&lt;ref name=Camps&gt;Camps, Arcadi Boix (2000). "Perfumery Techniques in Evolution". ''Allured Pub Corp''. {{ISBN|0-931710-72-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All these techniques will, to a certain extent, distort the odor of the aromatic compounds obtained from the raw materials. This is due to the use of heat, harsh solvents, or through exposure to oxygen in the extraction process which will denature the aromatic compounds, which either change their odor character or renders them odorless.
* '''[[Solvent extraction|Maceration/Solvent extraction]]''': The most used and economically important technique for extracting aromatics in the modern perfume industry. Raw materials are submerged in a solvent that can dissolve the desired aromatic compounds. ''Maceration'' lasts anywhere from hours to months. Fragrant compounds for woody and fibrous plant materials are often obtained in this manner as are all aromatics from animal sources. The technique can also be used to extract odorants that are too volatile for ''distillation'' or easily [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denatured]] by heat. Commonly used solvents for ''maceration/solvent extraction'' include [[ethane]], [[hexane]], and [[dimethyl ether]]. The product of this process is called a "[[Concrete (perfumery)|concrete]]."
** ''[[Supercritical fluid extraction]]'': A relatively new technique for extracting fragrant compounds from a raw material, which often employs [[Supercritical carbon dioxide|Supercritical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]. Due to the low heat of process and the relatively nonreactive solvent used in the extraction, the fragrant compounds derived often closely resemble the original odor of the raw material.
**''[[Ethanol extraction]]'': A type of solvent extraction used to extract fragrant compounds directly from dry raw materials, as well as the impure oily compounds materials resulting from solvent extraction or enfleurage. Ethanol extraction from fresh plant materials contain large quantities of water, which will also be extracted into the ethanol.
* '''[[Distillation]]''': A common technique for obtaining aromatic compounds from [[plant]]s, such as [[orange blossom]]s and [[rose]]s. The raw material is heated and the fragrant compounds are re-collected through [[condensation]] of the distilled vapor.
[[File:Fragonard small perfume distillery.JPG|thumb|upright|An old perfume still on display at [[Musée du Parfum|Fragonard]]]]
** ''Steam distillation'': Steam from boiling water is passed through the raw material, which drives out their volatile fragrant compounds. The condensate from distillation are settled in a [[Florentine flask]]. This allows for the easy separation of the fragrant oils from the water. The water collected from the condensate, which retains some of the fragrant compounds and oils from the raw material is called [[hydrosol]] and sometimes sold. This is most commonly used for fresh plant materials such as [[flower]]s, [[leaf|leaves]], and [[Plant stem|stems]].
** ''Dry/destructive distillation'': The raw materials are directly heated in a still without a carrier solvent such as water. Fragrant compounds that are released from the raw material by the high heat often undergo anhydrous [[pyrolysis]], which results in the formation of different fragrant compounds, and thus different fragrant notes. This method is used to obtain fragrant compounds from fossil [[amber]] and fragrant [[wood]]s where an intentional "burned" or "toasted" odor is desired.
** ''Fractionation'': Through the use of a [[fractionation column]], different fractions distilled from a material can be selectively excluded to modify the scent of the final product. Although the product is more expensive, this is sometimes performed to remove unpleasant or undesirable scents of a material and affords the perfumer more control over their composition process.
* '''Expression''': Raw material is squeezed or compressed and the [[essential oil]]s are collected. Of all raw materials, only the fragrant oils from the peels of fruits in the citrus family are extracted in this manner since the oil is present in large enough quantities as to make this extraction method economically feasible.
* '''[[Enfleurage]]''': Absorption of aroma materials into solid fat or wax and then extraction of odorous oils with [[ethanol|ethyl alcohol]]. Extraction by [[enfleurage]] was commonly used when [[distillation]] was not possible because some fragrant compounds [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denature]] through high heat. This technique is not commonly used in the modern industry due to prohibitive costs and the existence of more efficient and effective extraction methods.&lt;ref name=Fortineau/&gt;

==Fragrant extracts==
[[File:38034290 aromater3.jpg|thumb|upright|Indian Patchouli - Tincture]]
Although fragrant extracts are known to the general public as the generic term "[[essential oil]]s", a more specific language is used in the fragrance industry to describe the source, purity, and technique used to obtain a particular fragrant extract.
Of these extracts, only ''absolutes'', ''essential oils'', and ''tinctures'' are directly used to formulate perfumes.
*'''Absolute''': Fragrant materials that are purified from a ''pommade'' or ''concrete'' by soaking them in [[ethanol]]. By using a slightly [[hydrophilic]] compound such as ethanol, most of the fragrant compounds from the waxy source materials can be extracted without dissolving any of the fragrantless waxy molecules. Absolutes are usually found in the form of an oily liquid.
*'''Concrete''': Fragrant materials that have been extracted from raw materials through ''solvent extraction'' using volatile [[hydrocarbon]]s. Concretes usually contain a large amount of wax due to the ease in which the solvents dissolve various [[hydrophobic]] compounds. As such concretes are usually further purified through distillation or ethanol based solvent extraction. Concretes are typically either waxy or resinous solids or thick oily liquids.
*'''[[Essential oil]]''': Fragrant materials that have been extracted from a source material directly through ''distillation'' or ''expression'' and obtained in the form of an oily liquid. Oils extracted through expression are sometimes called ''expression oils''.
*'''Pomade''': A fragrant mass of solid fat created from the ''[[enfleurage]]'' process, in which odorous compounds in raw materials are adsorbed into animal fats. Pommades are found in the form of an oily and sticky solid.
*'''[[Tincture]]''': Fragrant materials produced by directly soaking and infusing raw materials in [[ethanol]]. Tinctures are typically thin liquids.&lt;ref name=Fortineau/&gt;

Products from different extraction methods are known under different names even though their starting materials are the same. For instance, orange blossoms from ''[[Citrus aurantium]]'' that have undergone solvent extraction produces "orange blossom absolute" but that which have been steam distilled is known as "neroli oil".

==Composing perfumes==
[[File:Lesbos - Perfume formula by Will Inrig.jpg|thumb|Perfume formula]]

Perfume compositions are an important part of many industries ranging from the luxury goods sectors, food services industries, to manufacturers of various household chemicals. The purpose of using perfume or fragrance compositions in these industries is to affect customers through their [[olfaction|sense of smell]] and entice them into purchasing the perfume or perfumed product. As such there is significant interest in producing a perfume formulation that people will find aesthetically pleasing.

===The perfumer===
{{main|Perfumer}}
[[File:Ernst, Rodolphe - The Perfume Maker.jpg|thumb|left|''The Perfume Maker'', by [[Rodolphe Ernst]]]]
The job of composing perfumes that will be sold is left up to an expert on perfume composition or known in the fragrance industry as the ''perfumer''. They are also sometimes referred to affectionately as a "''Nez''" (French for ''nose'') due to their fine sense of smell and skill in smell composition.

The composition of a perfume typically begins with a ''brief'' by the perfumer's employer or an outside customer. The customers to the perfumer or their employers, are typically fashion houses or large [[corporation]]s of various industries.&lt;ref&gt;Islam, G., Endrissat, N., &amp; Noppeney, C. (2016). Beyond “the Eye” of the Beholder: Scent innovation through analogical reconfiguration. Organization Studies, 0170840615622064. http://doi.org/10.1177/0170840615622064.&lt;/ref&gt; The perfumer will then go through the process of blending multiple perfume mixtures and sell the formulation to the customer, often with modifications of the composition of the perfume. 
The perfume composition will then be either used to enhance another product as a ''functional fragrance'' ([[shampoo]]s, [[make-up]], [[detergent]]s, car interiors, etc.), or marketed and sold directly to the public as a ''fine fragrance''.&lt;ref name=Burr /&gt;

===Technique===
[[File:Blotter strips.jpg|right|thumb|Paper blotters (fr:''mouillettes'') are commonly used by perfumers to sample and smell perfumes and odorants.]]
Although there is no single "correct" technique for the formulation of a perfume, there are general guidelines as to how a perfume can be constructed from a concept. Although many ingredients do not contribute to the smell of a perfume, many perfumes include colorants and anti-oxidants to improve the marketability and shelf life of the perfume, respectively.

====Basic framework====
Perfume oils usually contain tens to hundreds of ingredients and these are typically organized in a perfume for the specific role they will play. These ingredients can be roughly grouped into four groups:
*''Primary scents'' (Heart): Can consist of one or a few main ingredients for a certain concept, such as "rose". Alternatively, multiple ingredients can be used together to create an "abstract" primary scent that does not bear a resemblance to a natural ingredient. For instance, jasmine and rose scents are commonly blends for abstract floral fragrances. [[Cola]] flavourant is a good example of an abstract primary scent.
*''Modifiers'': These ingredients alter the primary scent to give the perfume a certain desired character: for instance, fruit [[ester]]s may be included in a floral primary to create a fruity floral; [[calone]] and citrus scents can be added to create a "fresher" floral. The cherry scent in cherry cola can be considered a modifier.
*''Blenders'': A large group of ingredients that smooth out the transitions of a perfume between different "layers" or bases. These themselves can be used as a major component of the primary scent. Common blending ingredients include [[linalool]] and hydroxycitronellal.
*''Fixatives'': Used to support the primary scent by bolstering it. Many resins, wood scents, and amber bases are used as fixatives.

The top, middle, and base notes of a fragrance may have separate primary scents and supporting ingredients. The perfume's [[fragrance oil]]s are then blended with [[Ethanol|ethyl alcohol]] and water, aged in tanks for several weeks and filtered through processing equipment to, respectively, allow the perfume ingredients in the mixture to stabilize and to remove any sediment and particles before the solution can be filled into the perfume bottles.&lt;ref name=cbyear&gt;{{Cite book| first=Chandler| last=Burr| title=The Perfect Scent: A Year Inside the Perfume Industry in Paris &amp; New York| publisher=Henry Holt and Co.| year=2008| isbn=978-0-8050-8037-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fragrance bases====
[[File:Perfume Organ, Grasse.jpg|upright|thumb|A "perfume organ", where perfumers play around with hundreds of essences, in [[Grasse]]]]
Instead of building a perfume from "ground up", many modern perfumes and colognes are made using ''fragrance bases'' or simply '''bases'''. Each base is essentially modular perfume that is blended from essential oils and aromatic chemicals, and formulated with a simple concept such as "fresh cut grass" or "juicy sour apple". Many of [[Guerlain]]'s ''Aqua Allegoria'' line, with their simple fragrance concepts, are good examples of what perfume fragrance bases are like.

The effort used in developing bases by fragrance companies or individual perfumers may equal that of a marketed perfume, since they are useful in that they are reusable. On top of its reusability, the benefit in using bases for construction are quite numerous:
#Ingredients with "difficult" or "overpowering" scents that are tailored into a blended base may be more easily incorporated into a work of perfume
#A base may be better scent approximations of a certain thing than the extract of the thing itself. For example, a base made to embody the scent for "fresh dewy rose" might be a better approximation for the scent concept of a rose after rain than plain [[rose oil]]. Flowers whose scents cannot be extracted, such as [[gardenia]] or [[hyacinth (plant)|hyacinth]], are composed as bases from data derived from [[headspace technology]].
#A perfumer can quickly rough out a concept from a brief by combining multiple bases, then present it for feedback. Smoothing out the "edges" of the perfume can be done after a positive response.

===Reverse engineering===
Creating perfumes through reverse engineering with analytical techniques such as [[Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry]] (GC/MS) can reveal the "general" formula for any particular perfume. The difficulty of GC/MS analysis arises due to the complexity of a perfume's ingredients. This is particularly due to the presence of natural essential oils and other ingredients consisting of complex chemical mixtures. However, "anyone armed with good GC/MS equipment and experienced in using this equipment can today, within days, find out a great deal about the formulation of any perfume... customers and competitors can analyze most perfumes more or less precisely."&lt;ref&gt;Calkin, Robert R. &amp; Jellinek, J. Stephen (1994). "Perfumery: practice and principles". ''John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.''. {{ISBN|0-471-58934-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antique or badly preserved perfumes undergoing this analysis can also be difficult due to the numerous degradation by-products and impurities that may have resulted from breakdown of the odorous compounds. Ingredients and compounds can usually be ruled out or identified using [[gas chromatograph]] (GC) smellers, which allow individual chemical components to be identified both through their physical properties and their scent. Reverse engineering of best-selling perfumes in the market is a very common practice in the fragrance industry due to the relative simplicity of operating GC equipment, the pressure to produce marketable fragrances, and the highly lucrative nature of the perfume market.&lt;ref name=cbyear/&gt;

===Copyright===
[[File:Fakeperfumes.jpg|right|thumb|[[Counterfeit]] perfumes]]
It is doubtful whether perfumes qualify as appropriate copyright subject matter under the US [[Copyright Act of 1976|Copyright Act]]. The issue has not yet been addressed by any US court. A perfume's scent is not eligible for [[trademark]] protection because the scent serves as the functional purpose of the product.&lt;ref name="cp"&gt;{{citation | author=David A. Einhorn | author2=Lesley Portnoy | title=The Copyrightability of Perfumes: I Smell a Symphony | journal=Intellectual Property Today |date=April 2010 | url=http://www.iptoday.com/issues/2010/04/the-copyrightability-perfumes-i-smell-symphony.asp }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 the [[Dutch Supreme Court]] granted copyright protection to [[Lancôme]]'s perfume ''Tresor'' (''Lancôme v. Kecofa''). The [[French Supreme Court]] has twice taken the position that perfumes lack the creativity to constitute copyrightable expressions (''Bsiri-Barbir v. Haarman &amp; Reimer'', 2006; ''Beaute Prestige International v. Senteur Mazal'', 2008).&lt;ref name="cp" /&gt;

==Health and environmental issues==

Perfume ingredients, regardless of natural or synthetic origins, may all cause health or environmental problems when used. Although the areas are under active research, much remains to be learned about the effects of fragrance on human health and the environment.

===Health===

====Immunological; asthma and allergy====
Evidence in peer-reviewed journals shows that some fragrances can cause asthmatic reactions in some individuals, especially those with severe or atopic asthma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kumar P, Caradonna-Graham VM, Gupta S, Cai X, Rao PN, Thompson J |title=Inhalation challenge effects of perfume scent strips in patients with asthma |journal=Ann.

In some cases, an excessive use of perfumes may cause [[allergy|allergic]] reactions of the skin. For instance, [[acetophenone]], [[ethyl acetate]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} and [[acetone]]&lt;ref name=cbyear/&gt; while present in many perfumes, are also known or potential respiratory [[allergen]]s. Nevertheless, this may be misleading, since the harm presented by many of these chemicals (either natural or synthetic) is dependent on environmental conditions and their concentrations in a perfume. For instance, linalool, which is listed as an irritant, causes skin irritation when it degrades to peroxides, however the use of antioxidants in perfumes or reduction in concentrations can prevent this. As well, the [[furanocoumarin]] present in natural extracts of grapefruit or [[celery]] can cause severe allergic reactions and increase sensitivity to ultraviolet radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Furanocoumarins as potent chemical defenses |first=May |last=Berenbaum |url=http://www.life.illinois.edu/berenbaum/newpage1.htm|date=June 14, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some research on natural aromatics have shown that many contain compounds that cause skin irritation.&lt;ref name="udgiv"&gt;Environmental and Health Assessment of Substances in Household Detergents and Cosmetic Detergent Products [http://www2.mst.dk/common/Udgivramme/Frame.asp?pg=http://www2.mst.dk/udgiv/Publications/2001/87-7944-596-9/html/kap12_eng.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303232246/http://www2.mst.dk/common/Udgivramme/Frame.asp?pg=http%3A%2F%2Fwww2.mst.dk%2Fudgiv%2FPublications%2F2001%2F87-7944-596-9%2Fhtml%2Fkap12_eng.htm|date=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However some studies, such as IFRA's research claim that [[opoponax]] is too dangerous to be used in perfumery, still lack scientific consensus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/health/ph_risk/committees/04_sccp/docs/sccp_o_025b.pdf|title=EC.europa.eu|publisher=|accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is also true that sometimes inhalation alone can cause skin irritation.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Balsam of Peru is used as a marker for [[perfume allergy]]. Its presence in a cosmetic is denoted by the [[INCI]] term ''Myroxylon pereirae''.&lt;ref name="rook"&gt;{{citation | author=M. H. Beck | author2=S. M. Wilkinson | chapter=Contact Dermatitis: Allergic | title=Rook's Textbook of Dermatology | volume=2 | edition=8th | year=2010 | publisher=Wiley | page=26.40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Balsam of Peru has been banned by the [[International Fragrance Association]] since 1982 from use as a fragrance compound, but may be present as an extract or distillate in other products, where mandatory labelling is not required for usage of 0.4% or less.&lt;ref name="google3"/&gt;

====Carcinogenicity====
There is scientific evidence that nitro-musks such as [[musk xylene]] could cause cancer in some specific animal tests. These reports were evaluated by the EU Scientific Committee for Consumer Safety (SCCS, formerly the SCCNFP &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/health/scientific_committees/consumer_safety/index_en.htm|title=Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety (SCCS) - Public Health - European Commission|website=Public Health|accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and musk xylene was found to be safe for continued use in cosmetic products.&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/health/ph_risk/committees/sccp/documents/out280_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It is in fact part of the procedures of the Cosmetic Regulation in Europe that materials classified as carcinogens require such a safety evaluation by the authorities to be allowed in cosmetic consumer products.

Although other ingredients such as polycyclic [[synthetic musk]]s, have been reported to be positive in some in-vitro hormone assays,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Schreurs RH, Legler J, Artola-Garicano E, etal |title=In vitro and in vivo antiestrogenic effects of polycyclic musks in zebrafish |journal=Environ. Sci. Technol. |volume=38 |issue=4 |pages=997–1002 |date=February 2004 |pmid=14998010 |doi= 10.1021/es034648y|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schreurs RH, Sonneveld E, Jansen JH, Seinen W, van der Burg B |title=Interaction of polycyclic musks and UV filters with the estrogen receptor (ER), androgen receptor (AR), and progesterone receptor (PR) in reporter gene bioassays |journal=Toxicol. Sci. |volume=83 |issue=2 |pages=264–72 |date=February 2005 |pmid=15537743 |doi=10.1093/toxsci/kfi035 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; these reports have been reviewed by various authorities. For example, for one of the main polycyclic musks [[Galaxolide|Galaxolide (HHCB)]] these reviews includes those of the EU Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety,&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/health/ph_risk/committees/sccp/documents/out179_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the EU's Priority Substances Review,&lt;ref&gt;http://echa.europa.eu/documents/10162/947def3b-bbbf-473b-bc19-3bda7a8da910&lt;/ref&gt; the EU Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risk,&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/health/ph_risk/committees/04_scher/docs/scher_o_086.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and more recently also the US EPA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/oppt/existingchemicals/pubs/workplans.html|title=TSCA Work Plan Chemicals - Existing Chemicals - OPPT - US EPA&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=|accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The outcome of all of these reviews over the past decade or so is that there is no safety concerns for human health. Reviews with similar positive outcome exists for another main polycyclic musk (AHTN) as well for instance on its safe use in cosmetics by the EU.&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/health/ph_risk/committees/sccp/documents/out176_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Many natural aromatics, such as oakmoss absolutes,&lt;ref name=udgiv/&gt;&lt;ref name="OakAranol"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Rastogi SC, Bossi R, Johansen JD, etal |title=Content of oak moss allergens atranol and chloroatranol in perfumes and similar products |journal=Contact Derm. |volume=50 |issue=6 |pages=367–70 |date=June 2004 |pmid=15274728 |doi=10.1111/j.0105-1873.2004.00379.x |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[basil]] oil, [[rose oil]] and many others contain allergens or carcinogenic compounds, the safety of which is either governed by regulations (e.g. allowed methyl eugenol levels in the EU Cosmetics Regulation (Entry{{nbsp}}102, Annex{{nbsp}}III of the EU Cosmetics Regulation.&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CONSLEG:2009R1223:20130711:en:PDF&lt;/ref&gt;) or through various limitations set by the International Fragrance Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifraorg.org/en-us/standards|title=standards - IFRA International Fragrance Association - in every sense|website=www.ifraorg.org|accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Toxicity====
Certain chemicals found in perfume are often toxic, at least for small insects if not for humans. For example, the compound Tricyclodecenyl allyl ether is often found in synthetic perfumes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.docstoc.com/docs/55017187/Insect-Repellents---Patent-6660288|title=Insect Repellents – PDF|work=Docstoc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/EP1119250.html|title=INSECT REPELLENTS – QUEST INTERNATIONAL B.V.|work=freepatentsonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has [[insect repellent]] property.

===Environmental===
[[File:Flickr - dlisbona - Perfume stall in Cairo metro.jpg|thumb|upright|Perfume stall in [[Cairo]]]]

====Pollution====
Synthetic musks are pleasant in smell and relatively inexpensive, as such they are often employed in large quantities to cover the unpleasant scent of laundry detergents and many personal cleaning products. Due to their large-scale use, several types of synthetic musks have been found in human fat and milk,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Duedahl-Olesen L, Cederberg T, Pedersen KH, Højgård A |title=Synthetic musk fragrances in trout from Danish fish farms and human milk |journal=Chemosphere |volume=61 |issue=3 |pages=422–31 |date=October 2005 |pmid=16182860 |doi=10.1016/j.chemosphere.2005.02.004 |url=http://orbit.dtu.dk/en/publications/synthetic-musk-fragrances-in-trout-from-danish-fish-farms-and-human-milk(477f6612-140a-40f8-b794-fd61aca8aaab).html}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in the sediments and waters of the [[Great Lakes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Peck AM, Linebaugh EK, Hornbuckle KC |title=Synthetic Musk Fragrances in Lake Erie and Lake Ontario Sediment Cores |journal=Environ. Sci. Technol. |volume=40 |issue=18 |pages=5629–35 |date=September 2006 |pmid=17007119 |doi= 10.1021/es060134y|url= |pmc=2757450}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These pollutants may pose additional health and environmental problems when they enter human and animal diets.

====Species endangerment====
The demands for aromatic materials such as sandalwood, agarwood, and musk have led to the endangerment of these species, as well as illegal trafficking and harvesting.

===Safety regulations===
The perfume industry in the US is not directly regulated by the FDA, instead the FDA controls the safety of perfumes through their ingredients and requires that they be tested to the extent that they are ''[[Generally recognized as safe]]'' (GRAS). Due to the need for protection of trade secrets, companies rarely give the full listing of ingredients regardless of their effects on health. In Europe, as from 11 March 2005, the mandatory listing of a set of 26 recognized fragrance allergens was enforced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2003:066:0026:0035:EN:PDF|title="DIRECTIVE 2003/15/EC"|publisher=|accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The requirement to list these materials is dependent on the intended use of the final product. The limits above which the allegens are required to be declared are 0.001% for products intended to remain on the skin, and 0.01% for those intended to be rinsed off. This has resulted in many old perfumes like chypres and [[fougère]] classes, which require the use of oakmoss extract, being reformulated.

==Preserving perfume==
[[File:Dokumentation av utställningen Passion för parfym, 2007, Hallwylska museet - Hallwylska museet - 86456.tif|thumb|upright|Perfumes in a museum]]

Fragrance compounds in perfumes will degrade or break down if improperly stored in the presence of [[heat]], [[light]], [[oxygen]], and [[Dirt|extraneous organic materials]].
Proper preservation of perfumes involves keeping them away from sources of heat and storing them where they will not be exposed to light. An opened bottle will keep its aroma intact for several years, as long as it is well stored.&lt;ref name=Burr /&gt; However, the presence of oxygen in the head space of the bottle and environmental factors will in the long run alter the smell of the fragrance.

Perfumes are best preserved when kept in light-tight [[aluminium]] bottles or in their original packaging when not in use, and refrigerated to relatively low temperatures: between 3–7&amp;nbsp;°C (37–45&amp;nbsp;°F). Although it is difficult to completely remove oxygen from the headspace of a stored flask of fragrance, opting for spray dispensers instead of rollers and "open" bottles will minimize oxygen exposure. Sprays also have the advantage of isolating fragrance inside a bottle and preventing it from mixing with dust, skin, and detritus, which would degrade and alter the quality of a perfume.

There exist several [[archives]] and [[museums]] devoted to the preservation of historical perfumes, namely the [[Osmothèque]], which stocks over 3,000 perfumes from the past two millennia in their original formulations. All scents in their collection are preserved in non-[[actinic]] glass flasks flushed with [[argon]] gas, stored in [[Thermal insulation|thermally insulated]] compartments maintained at {{convert|12|°C|°F|1}} in a large vault.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beautyfashion.com/archives/LOsmotheque.html Colton, Sarah, "L’Osmothèque—Preserving The Past To Ensure The Future", Beauty Fashion] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615174831/http://www.beautyfashion.com/archives/LOsmotheque.html |date=15 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peter J. Baxandall''' (1921, [[Kingston upon Thames]], [[Surrey]] – 1995, [[Malvern, Worcestershire|Malvern]], [[Worcestershire]]) was an English [[audio engineer]] and [[electronics engineer]] and a pioneer of the use of analog electronics in audio. He is probably best known for what is now called the Baxandall [[tone control circuit]], first published in a paper in ''[[Wireless World]]''.

==Biography==
Baxandall attended [[King's College School]] in London, then got his BSc in electrical engineering at [[Bute Building|Cardiff Technical College]] (1942). He was a radio instructor for the [[Fleet Air Arm]] for two years, and then worked for the [[Telecommunications Research Establishment]] (at the Circuit Research Division headed by [[Frederic Calland Williams]]), later renamed and merged to form the [[Royal Signals and Radar Establishment]], until his retirement in 1971. After retiring he worked as a consultant on various audio projects including loudspeakers, tape duplication, and microphone calibration. During this time he continued to publish, including a "seminal chapter" on [[electrostatic loudspeaker]]s. The [[Audio Engineering Society]] made him a Fellow in 1980, and in 1993 awarded him with a Silver Medal for his contributions to the field.&lt;ref name="fincham"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fincham|first=Laurie|year=1996|title=In Memoriam: Peter Baxandall|journal=Journal of the Audio Engineering Society|publisher=[[Audio Engineering Society]]|volume=44|issue=9|page=796|url=http://www.aes.org/aeshc/docs/jaes.obit/JAES_V44_9_PG796.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Baxandall circuit==
Baxandall's bass and treble circuit, when made public in ''Wireless World'' (1952), "swept all others before it".&lt;ref name="Self2010"/&gt; An early version of the design had already won him an award in 1950 (a $25 watch) at the British Sound Recording Association, a predecessor of the [[Audio Engineering Society]]. The design is now employed in millions of hi-fi systems (Baxandall received no royalties for his work).&lt;ref name="fincham"/&gt;

It exists in several versions—Baxandall's original had two capacitors per potentiometer, but it is possible to use only one at either the treble or bass potentiometers, or both.&lt;ref name="Self2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Self|first=Douglas|title=Small Signal Audio Design|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PvKPEFu2PVkC&amp;pg=PA259|accessdate=28 May 2012|year=2010|publisher=Focal|isbn=9780240521770|pages=259–68}}&lt;/ref&gt; It finds an application in [[High fidelity|hi-fi audio equipment]] and in amplifiers and effects for musical instruments.&lt;ref name="J.Dailey2011"&gt;{{cite book|last1=J.|first1=Denton Dailey,|last2=Dailey|first2=Denton J.|title=Electronics for Guitarists|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PPg5_lPQJyMC&amp;pg=PA47|accessdate=28 May 2012|year=2011|publisher=Springer|isbn=9781441995353|pages=47–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ampeg GVT5-110, GVT15H, and GVT52-112|last=Thompson|first=Art|date=December 2011|work=[[Guitar Player]]|pages=96–102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32576">[[File:MAKS-2007-Radar.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Airborne pulse-Doppler radar antenna]]
A '''pulse-Doppler radar''' is a [[radar]] system that determines the range to a target using pulse-timing techniques, and uses the [[Doppler effect]] of the returned signal to determine the target object's velocity. It combines the features of pulse radars and [[continuous-wave radar]]s, which were formerly separate due to the complexity of the [[electronics]].

Pulse-Doppler systems were first widely used on [[fighter aircraft]] starting in the 1960s. Earlier radars had used pulse-timing in order to determine range and the angle of the antenna (or similar means) to determine the bearing. However, this only worked when the radar antenna was not pointed down; in that case the reflection off the ground overwhelmed any returns from other objects. As the ground moves at the same speed but opposite direction of the aircraft, Doppler techniques allow the ground return to be filtered out, revealing aircraft and vehicles. This gives pulse-Doppler radars "[[look-down/shoot-down]]" capability. A secondary advantage in military radar is to reduce the transmitted power while achieving acceptable performance for improved safety of stealthy radar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.raytheon.com/capabilities/products/apq174/|title=AN/APQ-174/186 Multi-Mode Radar|publisher=[[Raytheon]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pulse-Doppler techniques also find widespread use in [[Weather radar|meteorological radars]], allowing the radar to determine [[wind speed]] from the velocity of any precipitation in the air. Pulse-Doppler radar is also the basis of [[synthetic aperture radar]] used in [[radar astronomy]], [[remote sensing]] and mapping. In air traffic control, they are used for discriminating aircraft from clutter. Besides the above conventional surveillance applications, pulse-Doppler radar has been successfully applied in healthcare, such as fall risk assessment and fall detection, for nursing or clinical purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=6038799&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D6038799|title=Automatic fall detection based on Doppler radar motion signature|publisher=IEEE PervasiveHealth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The earliest radar systems failed to operate as expected. The reason was traced to Doppler effects that degrade performance of systems not designed to account for moving objects. Fast-moving objects cause a phase-shift on the transmit pulse that can produce signal cancellation. Doppler has maximum detrimental effect on [[moving target indicator]] systems, which must use reverse phase shift for Doppler compensation in the detector.

Doppler weather effects (precipitation) were also found to degrade [[radar|conventional radar]] and moving target indicator radar, which can mask aircraft reflections. This phenomenon was adapted for use with [[weather radar]] in the 1950s after declassification of some World War II systems.

Pulse-Doppler radar was developed during World War II to overcome limitations by increasing [[pulse repetition frequency]]. This required the development of the [[klystron]], the [[traveling wave tube]], and solid state devices. Pulse-Doppler is incompatible with other high power microwave amplification devices that are not [[Coherence (physics)|coherent]].

Early examples of military systems include the [[AN/SPG-51]]B developed during the 1950s specifically for the purpose of operating in hurricane conditions with no performance degradation.

The [[Hughes AN/ASG-18 Fire Control System]] was a prototype airborne radar/combination system for the planned [[North American XF-108 Rapier]] interceptor aircraft for the United States Air Force, and later for the [[Lockheed YF-12]]. The US's first pulse-Doppler radar,&lt;ref&gt;Pace 1991, p.&amp;nbsp;152.&lt;/ref&gt; the system had [[look-down/shoot-down]] capability and could track one target at a time.

[[Weather]], [[Chaff (countermeasure)|chaff]], [[Terrain mask|terrain]], [[Blue Angels|flying techniques]], and [[Stealth aircraft|stealth]] are common tactics used to hide aircraft from radar. Pulse-Doppler radar eliminates these weaknesses.

It became possible to use pulse-Doppler radar on aircraft after digital computers were incorporated in the design. Pulse-Doppler provided [[look-down/shoot-down]] capability to support air-to-air missile systems in most modern military aircraft by the mid 1970s.

==Principle==
[[File:Dopplerradar.gif|thumb|Principle of pulse-Doppler radar]]

===Range measurement===
[[File:Radarops.gif|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Principle of pulsed radar]]
Pulse-Doppler systems measure the range to objects by measuring the elapsed time between sending a pulse of radio energy and receiving a reflection of the object. Radio waves travel at the [[speed of light]], so the distance to the object is the elapsed time multiplied by the speed of light, divided by two - there and back.

===Velocity measurement===
[[File:Doppler effect diagrammatic.png|thumb|400px|Change of wavelength caused by motion of the source]]

Pulse-Doppler radar is based on the [[Doppler effect]], where movement in range produces frequency shift on the signal reflected from the target.

:&lt;math&gt;\text{Doppler frequency} = \frac{2 \times \text{transmit frequency} \times \text{range velocity}}{C}.&lt;/math&gt;

[[Radial velocity]] is essential for pulse-Doppler radar operation. As the reflector moves between each transmit pulse, the returned signal has a [[phase (waves)|phase]] difference, or ''phase shift'', from pulse to pulse. This causes the reflector to produce Doppler modulation on the reflected signal.

Pulse-Doppler radars exploit this phenomenon to improve performance.

The amplitude of the successively returning pulse from the same scanned volume is
:&lt;math&gt;I = I_0 \sin\left(\frac{4\pi (x_0 + v \Delta t)}{\lambda}\right) = I_0 \sin(\Theta_0 + \Delta\Theta),&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; is the distance radar to target,
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the radar wavelength,
:&lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; it the time between two pulses.

So
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta\Theta = \frac{4\pi v \Delta t}{\lambda}.&lt;/math&gt;

This allows the radar to separate the reflections from multiple objects located in the same volume of space by separating the objects using a [[spread spectrum]] to segregate different signals:
:&lt;math&gt;v = \text{target speed} = \frac{\lambda\Delta\Theta}{4\pi \Delta t},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\Delta\Theta&lt;/math&gt; is the phase shift induced by range motion.

===Benefits===

Rejection speed is selectable on pulse-Doppler aircraft-detection systems so nothing below that speed will be detected. A one degree antenna beam illuminates millions of square feet of terrain at {{convert|10|mi|km}} range, and this produces thousands of detections at or below the horizon if Doppler is not used.

Pulse-Doppler radar uses the following signal processing criteria to exclude unwanted signals from slow-moving objects. This is also known as clutter rejection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aess.cs.unh.edu/radar%20se%20Lecture%2013.html|title=Clutter Rejection (Pulse Doppler), Radar Systems Engineering|publisher=IEEE New Hampshire Section, University of New Hampshire}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rejection velocity is usually set just above the prevailing wind speed (10 to 100 mile/hour or 15 to 150&amp;nbsp;km/hour). The velocity threshold is much lower for [[weather radar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/divisions/radar/pathtonexrad.pdf|title=Path to Nexrad, Doppler Radar Development at the National Severe Storm Laboratory|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Severe Storm Laboratory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \left\vert \frac{\text{Doppler frequency} \times C}{2 \times \text{transmit frequency}} \right\vert &gt; \text{velocity  threshold}.&lt;/math&gt;

In airborne pulse-Doppler radar, the velocity threshold is offset by the speed of the aircraft relative to the ground.

:&lt;math&gt; \left\vert \frac{\text{Doppler frequency} \times C}{2 \times \text{transmit frequency}} - \text{ground speed} \times \cos\Theta \right\vert &gt; \text{velocity threshold},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Theta&lt;/math&gt; is the angle offset between the antenna position and the aircraft flight trajectory.

Surface reflections appear in almost all radar. '''Ground clutter''' generally appears in a circular region within a radius of about {{convert|25|mi}} near ground-based radar. This distance extends much further in airborne and space radar. Clutter results from radio energy being reflected from the earth surface, buildings, and vegetation. Clutter includes weather in radar intended to detect and report aircraft and spacecraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wxbeacon.com/vws/doppler_descr.php|title=How does Doppler Radar Work?|publisher=Weather Beacon Doppler Radar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clutter creates a vulnerability region in [[Radar signal characteristics#The radar signal in the time domain|pulse-amplitude time-domain radar]]. Non-Doppler radar systems cannot be pointed directly at the ground due to excessive false alarms, which overwhelm computers and operators. Sensitivity must be reduced near clutter to avoid overload. This vulnerability begins in the low-elevation region several beam widths above the horizon, and extends downward. This also exists throughout the volume of moving air associated with weather phenomenon.

Pulse-Doppler radar corrects this as follows.
* Allows the radar antenna to be pointed directly at the ground without overwhelming the computer and without reducing sensitivity.
* Fills in the vulnerability region associated with [[radar signal characteristics#The radar signal in the time domain|pulse-amplitude time-domain radar]] for small object detection near terrain and weather.
* Increases detection range by 300% or more in comparison to [[moving target indication]] (MTI) by improving sub-clutter visibility.&lt;ref name=scv&gt;{{cite web|title=Subclutter Visibility and Improvement Factor|url=http://www.radartutorial.eu/18.explanations/ex17.en.html|accessdate=January 29, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101200238/http://www.radartutorial.eu/18.explanations/ex17.en.html|archivedate=January 1, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Clutter (radar)|Clutter rejection capability]] of about 60&amp;nbsp;dB is needed for [[look-down/shoot-down]] capability, and pulse-Doppler is the only strategy that can satisfy this requirement. This eliminates vulnerabilities associated with the low-elevation and below-horizon environment.

[[Pulse compression]], and [[moving target indicator]] (MTI) provide up to 25&amp;nbsp;dB sub-clutter visibility. MTI antenna beam is aimed above horizon to avoid excessive false alarm rate, which renders systems vulnerable. Aircraft and some missiles exploit this weakness using a technique called '''flying below the radar''' to avoid detection ([[Nap-of-the-earth]]). This flying technique is ineffective against pulse-Doppler radar.

Pulse-Doppler provides an advantage when attempting to detect missiles and [[Stealth aircraft|low observability aircraft]] flying near terrain, sea surface, and weather.

Audible Doppler and target size support passive vehicle type classification when [[identification friend or foe]] is not available from a [[Transponder (aviation)|transponder signal]]. Medium [[pulse repetition frequency]] (PRF) reflected microwave signals fall between 1,500 and 15,000 cycle per second, which is audible. This means a [[helicopter]] sounds like a helicopter, a [[Jet aircraft|jet]] sounds like a jet, and [[propeller aircraft]] sound like propellers. [[Glider (aircraft)|Aircraft with no moving parts]] produce a tone. The actual size of the target can be calculated using the audible signal.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}

===Detriments===
[[Image:Radar-Dilemne Doppler.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Maximum range from reflectivity (red) and unambiguous Doppler velocity range (blue) with a fix pulse repetition rate.]]Ambiguity processing is required when target range is above the red line in the graphic, which increases scan time.

Scan time is a critical factor for some systems because vehicles moving at or above the speed of sound can travel one mile (1.6&amp;nbsp;km) every few seconds, like the [[Exocet]], [[Harpoon (missile)|Harpoon]], [[Kh-22|Kitchen]], and [[Air-to-air missile]]. The maximum time to scan the entire volume of the sky must be on the order of a dozen seconds or less for systems operating in that environment.

Pulse-Doppler radar by itself can be too slow to cover the entire volume of space above the horizon unless fan beam is used. This approach is used with the AN/SPS 49(V)5 Very Long Range Air Surveillance Radar, which sacrifices elevation measurement to gain speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/weaps/an-sps-49.htm|title=AN/SPS-49 Very Long-Range Air Surveillance Radar|publisher=[[Federation of American Scientists]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pulse-Doppler antenna motion must be slow enough so that all the return signals from at least 3 different PRFs can be processed out to the maximum anticipated detection range. This is known as [[Dwell time (radar)|dwell time]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.radartutorial.eu/01.basics/Dwell%20Time%20and%20Hits%20per%20Scan.en.html|title=Dwell Time and Hits Per Scan|publisher=Radartutorial}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antenna motion for pulse-Doppler must be as slow as radar using [[Moving target indication|MTI]].

Search radar that include pulse-Doppler are usually dual mode because best overall performance is achieved when pulse-Doppler is used for areas with high false alarm rates (horizon or below and weather), while conventional radar will scan faster in free-space where false alarm rate is low (above horizon with clear skies).

The antenna type is an important consideration for multi-mode radar because undesirable phase shift introduced by the radar antenna can degrade [[performance measurement]]s for sub-clutter visibility.

==Signal processing==
The signal processing enhancement of pulse-Doppler allows small high-speed objects to be detected in close proximity to large slow moving reflectors. To achieve this, the transmitter must be coherent and should produce low [[phase noise]] during the detection interval, and the receiver must have large instantaneous [[dynamic range]].

* [[Pulse-Doppler signal processing|Pulse-Doppler signal processing detailed explanation]]

Pulse-Doppler signal processing also includes ambiguity resolution to identify true range and velocity.

* [[Ambiguity resolution|Ambiguity resolution detailed explanation]]

The received signals from multiple PRF are compared to determine true range using the range ambiguity resolution process.

* [[Range ambiguity resolution|Range ambiguity resolution detailed explanation]]

The received signals are also compared using the frequency ambiguity resolution process.

* [[Frequency ambiguity resolution|Frequency ambiguity resolution detailed explanation]]

===Range resolution===

The range resolution is the minimal range separation between two objects traveling at the same speed before the radar can detect two discrete reflections:
:&lt;math&gt;\text{range resolution} = \frac{C}{\text{PRF} \times (\text{number of samples between transmit pulses})}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Velocity resolution===

The velocity resolution is the minimal radial velocity difference between two objects traveling at the same range before the radar can detect two discrete reflections:
:&lt;math&gt;\text{velocity resolution} = \frac{C \times \text{PRF}}{\text{transmit frequency} \times \text{filter size in transmit pulses}}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Special consideration==

Pulse-Doppler radar has special requirements that must be satisfied to achieve acceptable performance.

===Pulse repetition frequency===
{{main|Pulse repetition frequency}}
Pulse-Doppler typically uses [[medium pulse repetition frequency]] (PRF) from about 3&amp;nbsp;kHz to 30&amp;nbsp;kHz. The range between transmit pulses is 5&amp;nbsp;km to 50&amp;nbsp;km.

Range and velocity cannot be measured directly using medium PRF, and ambiguity resolution is required to identify true range and speed. Doppler signals are generally above 1&amp;nbsp;kHz, which is audible, so audio signals from medium-PRF systems can be used for passive target classification.

===Angular measurement===

Radar systems require angular measurement. Transponders are not normally associated with pulse-Doppler radar, so sidelobe suppression is required for practical operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radartutorial.eu/13.ssr/sr09.en.html|title=Side Lobe Suppression|publisher=Radartutorial.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mit.edu/6.933/www/Fall2000/mode-s/sidelobe.html|title=Side Lobe Suppression|publisher=[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tracking radar systems use angle error to improve accuracy by producing measurements perpendicular to the radar antenna beam. Angular measurements are averaged over a span of time and combined with radial movement to develop information suitable to predict target position for a short time into the future.

The two angle error techniques used with tracking radar are monopulse and conical scan.

* [[Monopulse radar]]
* [[Conical scanning]]

===Coherency===
Pulse-Doppler radar requires a [[Coherence (physics)#Spectral coherence|coherent oscillator]] with very little noise. [[Phase noise]] reduces sub-clutter visibility performance by producing apparent motion on stationary objects.

[[Cavity magnetron]] and [[crossed-field amplifier]] are not appropriate because noise introduced by these devices interfere with detection performance. The only amplification devices suitable for pulse-Doppler are [[klystron]], [[traveling wave tube]], and solid state devices.

===Scalloping===
{{main|Radar scalloping}}
Pulse-Doppler signal processing introduces a phenomenon called scalloping. The name is associated with a series of holes that are scooped-out of the detection performance.

Scalloping for pulse-Doppler radar involves blind velocities created by the clutter rejection filter. Every volume of space must be scanned using 3 or more different PRF. A two PRF detection scheme will have '''detection gaps''' with a pattern of discrete ranges, each of which has a blind velocity.

===Windowing===

[[Ringing artifacts]] pose a problem with search, detection, and ambiguity resolution in pulse-Doppler radar.

Ringing is reduced in two ways.

First, the [[Windowing functions#Tukey window|shape of the transmit pulse]] is adjusted to smooth the leading edge and trailing edge so that RF power is increased and decreased without an abrupt change. This creates a transmit pulse with smooth ends instead of a square wave, which reduces ringing phenomenon that is otherwise associated with target reflection.

Second, the shape of the receive pulse is adjusted using a [[window function]] that minimizes ringing that occurs any time pulses are applied to a filter. In a digital system, this adjusts the phase and/or amplitude of each sample before it is applied to the [[fast Fourier transform]]. The [[Windowing functions#Dolph–Chebyshev window|Dolph-Chebyshev window]] is the most effective because it produces a flat processing floor with no ringing that would otherwise cause false alarms.&lt;ref name=dolph&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/sasp/Dolph_Chebyshev_Window.html|title=Dolph-Chebyshev Window| accessdate = January 29, 2011| publisher = [[Stanford University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antenna===

Pulse-Doppler radar is generally limited to mechanically aimed antennas and active phase array.

Mechanical RF components, such as wave-guide, can produce Doppler modulation due to phase shift induced by vibration. This introduces a requirement to perform full spectrum operational tests using shake tables that can produce high power mechanical vibration across all anticipated audio frequencies.

Doppler is incompatible with most electronically steered phase-array antenna. This is because the phase-shifter elements in the antenna are non-reciprocal and the phase shift must be adjusted before and after each transmit pulse. Spurious phase shift is produced by the sudden impulse of the phase shift, and settling during the receive period between transmit pulses places Doppler modulation onto stationary clutter. That receive modulation corrupts the [[measure of Performance|measure of performance]] for sub-clutter visibility. Phase shifter settling time on the order of 50ns is required. Start of receiver sampling needs to be postponed at least 1 phase-shifter settling time-constant (or more) for each 20&amp;nbsp;dB of sub-clutter visibility.

Most antenna phase shifters operating at PRF above 1&amp;nbsp;kHz introduce spurious phase shift unless special provisions are made, such as reducing phase shifter settling time to a few dozen nanoseconds.&lt;ref name=phase-shifters&gt;{{cite web|url=http://accelconf.web.cern.ch/accelconf/LINAC08/papers/thp089.pdf|title=High Power L Band Fast Phase Shifter|accessdate=August 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following gives the maximum permissible settling time for antenna [[phase shift module]]s.

:&lt;math&gt;T = \frac{1}{e^\frac{\text{SCV}}{20} \times S \times \text{PRF}},&lt;/math&gt;

where
:''T'' = phase shifter settling time,
:''SCV'' = sub-clutter visibility in [[Decibel|dB]],
:''S'' = number of range samples between each transmit pulse,
:''PRF'' = maximal design pulse repetition frequency.

The antenna type and scan performance is a practical consideration for multi-mode radar systems.

===Diffraction===
Choppy surfaces, like waves and trees, form a diffraction grating suitable for bending microwave signals. Pulse-Doppler can be so sensitive that [[diffraction]] from mountains, buildings or wave tops can be used to detect fast moving objects otherwise blocked by solid obstruction along the line of sight. This is a very lossy phenomenon that only becomes possible when radar has significant excess sub-clutter visibility.

Refraction and ducting use transmit frequency at [[L-band]] or lower to extend the horizon, which is very different from diffraction. [[Refraction]] for [[over-the-horizon radar]] uses variable density in the air column above the surface of the earth to bend RF signals. An inversion layer can produce a transient [http://www.amateur-radio-wiki.net/index.php?title=Tropospheric_ducting troposphere duct] that traps RF signals in a thin layer of air like a wave-guide.

===Subclutter visibility===
Subclutter visibility involves the maximum ratio of clutter power to target power, which is proportional to dynamic range. This determines performance in heavy weather and near the earth surface.

:&lt;math&gt;\text{dynamic range} = \min \begin{cases} \tfrac{\text{carrier power}}{\text{noise power}} &amp; \text{transmit noise, where bandwidth is } \tfrac{\text{PRF}}{\text{filter size}}\\ 2^{\text{sample bits} + \text{filter size}} &amp; \text{receiver dynamic range} \end{cases}.&lt;/math&gt;

Subclutter visibility is the ratio of the smallest signal that can be detected in the presence of a larger signal.

:&lt;math&gt;\text{subclutter visibility} = \frac{\text{dynamic range}}{\text{CFAR detection threshold}}.&lt;/math&gt;

A small fast-moving target reflection can be detected in the presence of larger slow-moving clutter reflections when the following is true:

:&lt;math&gt;\text{target power} &gt; \frac{\text{clutter power}}{\text{subclutter visibility}}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Performance===
The pulse-Doppler radar equation can be used to understand trade-offs between different design constraints, like power consumption, detection range, and microwave safety hazards. This is a very simple form of modeling that allows performance to be evaluated in a sterile environment.

The theoretical range performance is as follows.

:&lt;math&gt; R = \left( \frac{P_t G_t A_r \sigma F D}{16 \pi^2 K_b T B N} \right)^\frac{1}{4}, &lt;/math&gt;

where
:''R'' = distance to the target,
:''P''&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; = transmitter power,
:''G''&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; = [[Gain (electronics)|gain]] of the transmitting antenna,
:''A''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; = effective aperture (area) of the receiving antenna,
:''σ'' = [[radar cross section]], or scattering coefficient, of the target,
:''F'' = [[Antenna gain|antenna pattern propagation factor]],
:''D'' = Doppler filter size (transmit pulses in each [[Fast Fourier transform]]),
:''K''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; = [[Boltzmann's constant]],
:''T'' = absolute temperature,
:''B'' = [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|receiver bandwidth (band-pass filter)]],
:''N'' = [[noise figure]].

This equation is derived by combining the [[Radar#Radar equation|radar equation]] with the [[Noise (electronics)|noise equation]] and accounting for in-band noise distribution across multiple detection filters. The value ''D'' is added to the standard radar range equation to account for both [[pulse-Doppler signal processing]] and [[Coherence (physics)|transmitter FM noise reduction]].

Detection range is increased proportional to the fourth root of the number of filters for a given power consumption. Alternatively, power consumption is reduced by the number of filers for a given detection range.

[[Pulse-Doppler signal processing]] integrates all of the energy from all of the individual reflected pulses that enter the filter. This means a [[pulse-Doppler signal processing]] system with 1024 elements provides 30.103&amp;nbsp;dB of improvement due to the type of signal processing that must be used with pulse-Doppler radar. The energy of all of the individual pulses from the object are added together by the filtering process.

Signal processing for a 1024 point filter improves performance by 30.103&amp;nbsp;dB, assuming compatible transmitter and antenna. This corresponds to 562% increase in maximal distance.

These improvements are the reason pulse-Doppler is essential for military and astronomy.

==Aircraft tracking uses==

Pulse-Doppler radar for aircraft detection has two modes.
* Scan
* Track

Scan mode involves frequency filtering, amplitude thresholding, and ambiguity resolution. Once a reflection has been [[Constant false alarm rate|detected]] and [[Ambiguity resolution|resolved]], the pulse-Doppler radar automatically transitions to tracking mode for the volume of space surrounding the track.

Track mode works like a [[phase-locked loop]], where Doppler velocity is compared with the range movement on successive scans. '''Lock''' indicates the difference between the two measurements is below a threshold, which can only occur with an object that satisfies [[classical mechanics|Newtonian mechanics]]. Other types of electronic signals cannot produce a lock. Lock exists in no other type of radar.

The '''lock criteria''' needs to be satisfied during normal operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.es.northropgrumman.com/solutions/awacs/assets/AWACS.pdf |title=AWACS Surveillance Radar |publisher=Norhrop Grummond |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227021024/http://www.es.northropgrumman.com/solutions/awacs/assets/AWACS.pdf |archivedate=2009-02-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* {{format link|Pulse-Doppler signal processing#Lock}}

Lock eliminates the need for human intervention with the exception of helicopters and [[Radar jamming and deception#Electronic jamming|electronic jamming]].

Weather phenomenon obey [[adiabatic process]] associated with [[air mass]] and not [[Newtonian mechanics]], so the lock criteria is not normally used for weather radar.

[[Pulse-Doppler signal processing]] selectively excludes low-velocity reflections so that no detections occurs below a threshold velocity. This eliminates terrain, weather, biologicals, and [[Radar jamming and deception#Mechanical jamming|mechanical jamming]] with the exception of decoy aircraft.

The target Doppler signal from the detection is converted from [[frequency domain]] back into [[time domain]] sound for the operator in track mode on some radar systems. The operator uses this sound for passive target classification, such as recognizing helicopters and electronic jamming.

===Helicopters===

Special consideration is required for aircraft with large moving parts because pulse-Doppler radar operates like a [[phase-locked loop]]. Blade tips moving near the speed of sound produce the only signal that can be detected when a [[helicopter]] is moving slow near terrain and weather.

Helicopters appears like a rapidly pulsing noise emitter except in a clear environment free from clutter. An audible signal is produced for passive identification of the type of airborne object. Microwave Doppler frequency shift produced by reflector motion falls into the audible sound range for human beings ({{nowrap|20 – 20,000 Hz}}), which is used for target classification in addition to the kinds of conventional [[radar display]] used for that purpose, like A-scope, B-scope, C-scope, and RHI indicator. The human ear may be able to tell the difference better than electronic equipment.

A special mode is required because the Doppler velocity feedback information must be unlinked from radial movement so that the system can transition from scan to track with no lock.

Similar techniques are required to develop track information for jamming signals and interference that cannot satisfy the lock criteria.

===Multi-mode===
Pulse-Doppler radar must be multi-mode to handle aircraft turning and crossing trajectory.

Once in track mode, pulse-Doppler radar must include a way to modify Doppler filtering for the volume of space surrounding a track when radial velocity falls below the minimum detection velocity. Doppler filter adjustment must be linked with a [[Pulse-Doppler signal processing#Track|radar track function]] to automatically adjust Doppler rejection speed within the volume of space surrounding the track.

Tracking will cease without this feature because the target signal will otherwise be rejected by the Doppler filter when radial velocity approaches zero because there is no change in frequency. 

Multi-mode operation may also include continuous wave illumination for [[semi-active radar homing]].

The '''quantum-confined [[Stark effect]]''' ('''QCSE''') describes the effect of an external [[electric field]] upon the light [[absorption spectrum]] or [[emission spectrum]] of a [[quantum well]] (QW).  In the absence of an external electric field, [[electron]]s and [[electron hole|holes]] within the quantum well may only occupy [[quantum state|states]] within a [[wikt:discrete|discrete]] set of energy subbands. Only a discrete set of frequencies of light may be absorbed or emitted by the system.  When an external electric field is applied, the electron states shift to lower energies, while the hole states shift to higher energies.  This reduces the permitted light absorption or emission frequencies.  Additionally, the external electric field shifts electrons and holes to opposite sides of the well, decreasing the overlap integral, which in turn reduces the recombination efficiency (i.e. fluorescence [[quantum yield]]) of the system. 
&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
The spatial separation between the electrons and holes is limited by the presence of the potential barriers around the quantum well, meaning that [[exciton]]s are able to exist in the system even under the influence of an electric field.  The quantum-confined Stark effect is used in QCSE [[optical modulator]]s, which allow optical communications signals to be switched on and off rapidly.

Even if Quantum Objects (Wells, Dots or Discs, for instance) emit and absorb light generally with higher energies than the [[band gap]] of the material, the QCSE may shift the energy to values lower than the gap. This was evidenced recently in the study of quantum discs embedded in a nanowire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zagonel|first=L.

== Theoretical description ==
The shift in absorption lines can be calculated by comparing the energy levels in unbiased and biased quantum wells.  It is a simpler task to find the energy levels in the unbiased system, due to its symmetry.  If the external electric field is small, it can be treated as a perturbation to the unbiased system and its approximate effect can be found using [[perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbation theory]].

=== Unbiased system ===
The potential for a quantum well may be written as
:&lt;math&gt;
 V(z) =
 \begin{cases}
 0; &amp; |z| &lt; L/2 \\
 V_0; &amp; \mbox{otherwise}
 \end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is the width of the well and &lt;math&gt;V_0&lt;/math&gt; is the height of the potential barriers.  The bound states in the well lie at a set of discrete energies, &lt;math&gt;E_n&lt;/math&gt; and the associated wavefunctions can be written using the envelope function approximation as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;\psi(\mathbf{r})=\phi_{n}(z)\frac{1}{\sqrt{A}}e^{i(k_{x}\cdot{x}+k_{y}\cdot{y})}u(\mathbf{r}).&lt;/math&gt;
In this expression, &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the cross-sectional area of the system, perpendicular to the quantisation direction, &lt;math&gt;u(\mathbf{r})&lt;/math&gt; is a periodic [[Bloch wave|Bloch function]] for the energy band edge in the bulk semiconductor and &lt;math&gt;\phi_n(z)&lt;/math&gt; is a slowly varying envelope function for the system.

If the quantum well is very deep, it can be approximated by the [[particle in a box]] model, in which &lt;math&gt;V_0 \to \infty&lt;/math&gt;.  Under this simplified model, analytical expressions for the bound state wavefunctions exist, with the form
:&lt;math&gt;
\phi_n(z) = \sqrt{\frac{2}{L}} \times
 \begin{cases}
\cos \left(\frac{n\pi z}{L}\right) &amp; n \, \text{odd} \\
\sin \left(\frac{n\pi z}{L}\right) &amp; n \, \text{even}
 \end{cases}.
&lt;/math&gt;
The energies of the bound states are
:&lt;math&gt;
E_n = \frac{\hbar^2n^2\pi^2}{2m^*L^2},
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;m^*&lt;/math&gt; is the [[effective mass (solid-state physics)|effective mass]] of an electron in a given semiconductor.

=== Biased system ===
Supposing the electric field is biased along the z direction,
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E}=E\mathbf{z},&lt;/math&gt;
the perturbing Hamiltonian term is
:&lt;math&gt;H'=eEz.&lt;/math&gt;
The first order correction to the energy levels is zero due to symmetry. 
:&lt;math&gt;E_n^{(1)} = \langle n^{(0)} | eEz | n^{(0)} \rangle =0&lt;/math&gt;.
The second order correction is, for instance n=1,
:&lt;math&gt;E_1^{(2)} = \sum_{k \ne 1} \frac{|\langle k^{(0)}|eEz|1^{(0)} \rangle|^2} {E_1^{(0)} - E_k^{(0)}} \approx \frac{|\langle 2^{(0)}|eEz|1^{(0)} \rangle|^2} {E_1^{(0)} - E_2^{(0)}} = -24\left(\frac{2}{3\pi}\right)^{6}\frac{e^{2}E^{2}m_e^{*}L^{4}}{\hbar^{2} }
&lt;/math&gt;
for electrons.

Similar calculations can be applied to holes by replacing the electron effective mass with the hole effective mass.

=== Absorption coefficient ===
Addition to energy level shift, the DC electric field causes decrease of absorption coefficient. Because electron and hole are forced to opposite direction by the field, the overlap of relating valence and conduction band in transition is decreased. Thus, according to [[Fermi's golden rule]], which says that transition probability is proportional to the overlap, optical transition strength is weakened. Using this, light absorption of materials can be controlled by changing electric field and can be used as an optical modulator.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3117">The '''roll center''' of a [[vehicle]] is the notional point at which the cornering forces in the suspension are reacted to the vehicle body.

There are two definitions of roll center. The most commonly used is the geometric (or kinematic) roll center; the [[Society of Automotive Engineers]] uses a force-based definition.&lt;ref&gt;An Introduction to Modern Vehicle Design edited by Julian Happian-Smith P293&lt;/ref&gt;

The location of the geometric roll center is solely dictated by the [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] geometry, and can be found using principles of the [[instant centre of rotation|instant center of rotation]]. The [[Society of Automotive Engineers|SAE's]] definition of the force based roll center is, "The point in the [[transverse plane|transverse vertical plane]] through any pair of wheel centers at which lateral forces may be applied to the [[sprung mass]] without producing suspension roll".

The lateral location of the roll center is typically at the center-line of the vehicle when the suspension on the left and right sides of the car are mirror images of each other.

The significance of the roll center can only be appreciated when the vehicle's center of mass is also considered. If there is a difference between the position of the [[center of mass]] and the roll center a [[moment arm]] is created. When the vehicle experiences [[angular velocity]] due to cornering, the size of the moment arm, combined with the stiffness of the springs and [[anti-roll bar]]s (anti-sway bars in some parts of the world), dictates how much the vehicle will roll. This has other effects too, such as dynamic load transfer.

==Application==

When the vehicle rolls the roll centers migrate. It is this movement of roll centers that vehicle dynamics seek to control and in most cases limit{{cn|date=May 2018}}. The rapid movement of roll centers when the system experiences small displacements can lead to stability problems with the vehicle{{cn|date=May 2018}}. The roll center height has been shown to affect behavior at the initiation of turns such as nimbleness and initial roll control.

==Testing methods==
Current methods of analyzing individual wheel instant centers have yielded more intuitive results of the effects of non-rolling weight transfer effects. This type of analysis is better known as the lateral-anti method.  This is where one takes the individual instant center locations of each corner of the car and then calculates the resultant vertical reaction [[vector (geometric)|vector]] due to lateral force. This value then is taken into account in the calculation of a jacking force and lateral weight transfer. This method works particularly well in circumstances where there are asymmetries in left to right suspension geometry.

The practical equivalent of the above is to push laterally at the tire contact patch and measure the ratio of the change in vertical load to the horizontal force.

'''''Scrapheap Challenge''''' is a British [[game show|television game show]] where teams of contestants build a working machine that could do a specific task, using materials available in a [[Wrecking yard|scrapheap]]. The series features teams of four or five given ten hours (based around [[sunset]]) to build vehicles, or machines to complete a specific task, such as being a [[trebuchet]], or complete a racecourse whilst acting as a [[gyroscope]]. The series ran for eleven series, and originally shown on [[Channel 4]]  The format was exported to the United States, where it was known as '''''Junkyard Wars'''''. The US show was also produced by RDF Media, and was originally shown on [[TLC (TV channel)|The Learning Channel]]. Repeats have aired on another Discovery network, the [[Science (TV channel)|Science Channel]].

==Format==
[[File:Scrapyard challenge vw beetle.jpg|thumb|left|An example of the type of vehicles created for Scrapheap Challenge, the Green Goddesses VW Beetle.]]
A typical episode featured a competition between two 4-person teams, each consisting of three regular members (with one designated the captain), plus an expert in the field related to the particular challenge. The judge for each episode is typically a specialist in (non-scrap) versions of the machine being constructed.

The challenges are many and varied, usually involving teams constructing a machine to achieve a particular objective. The final showdown usually consisted of either head-to-head races or individually run timed events. Examples of challenges included making a [[jet engine|jet]] [[automobile|car]], a [[Armoured vehicle-launched bridge|bridging machine]], a car-crusher, and a machine to fling a [[Mini|British Leyland Mini]] as far as possible.

Assistant producer Eve Kay had the idea for the show after watching a scene in the movie ''[[Apollo 13 (film)|Apollo 13]]'', where [[NASA]] engineers had only a short period of time to construct a carbon dioxide filter out of parts available on the space capsule.&lt;ref name="Culture Vultures" /&gt; The show also draws its inspiration from the 1980s TV series ''[[The Great Egg Race]]''.

==History and results==
The UK show was originally presented by [[Robert Llewellyn]], joined in series 2-4 by producer [[Cathy Rogers]], and in series 5-10 by [[Lisa Rogers]] (no relation). For series 11, both hosts were replaced with former ''Scrapheap'' contestant and judge [[Dick Strawbridge]].

Series 1 was titled ''Scrapheap'', and pitted the same two teams against each other each week. From series 2, the show was renamed ''Scrapheap Challenge'' and featured a [[Single-elimination tournament|knockout tournament]] between teams drawn from the general public. From series 3, a champion of champions contest was initiated.

Series 3 and 4 included a single US team in the field. Series 3 had The Nerds,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-nerds.org/ The New England Rubbish Deconstruction Society; The NERDS&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and series 4 had ''The Mulewrights'' brought in at the last minute when one team couldn't travel due to a livestock epidemic. Both US teams made it to the final round.

Series 9 was shown in two halves. The first eight episodes aired between 15 April and 3 June, and the remaining episodes between 4 November and 23 December 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.garfirth.com/ Steve G's Scrapheap and airing dates page]&lt;/ref&gt;

Series 11 saw Dick Strawbridge (formerly a competitor from series 1-3) return as an expert and judge, replacing Robert Llewellyn. The show was now produced by RDF Bristol and Exec. producer Jane Lomas and series producer [[John Macnish]] had to deliver the new series on a fraction of the budget of previous series. As well as a change in presenters the format of the series changed dramatically with teams of 'scrappers' from across the UK competing against Dick Strawbridge's home team known as 'Dick's Diamonds'. At the end of each episode a battle to determine the week's champion scrappers took place in a public venue in front of crowds of cheering fans. Series 11 of the UK show had its world premiere in Australia on [[ABC2]], with episode 1 airing on 1 July 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/tv/guide/abc2/200907/programs/ZX0031A001D1072009T183000.htm ABC2 schedule Wed 1 July 2009 'Scrapheap Challenge{{spaced ndash}} Chariot Jousting']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spin-offs==
===Full Metal Challenge===
{{Main|Full Metal Challenge}}

A spin-off from 2003 that had teams from around the world. Teams had a fixed budget and a month to build a vehicle to compete in a varied set of trials, such as auto "bowling", a race through a flooded course, a "car coaster", car "sumo" and other tests.

The winners were the Aquaholics from the UK. Hosted by [[Cathy Rogers]] and [[Henry Rollins]], it lasted one season.

===Scrappy Races (Rally)===
Another spin-off series was instituted from 2004 to 2006 and was broadcast following the main series. It was also presented by Robert Llewellyn and Lisa Rogers.

It involved several teams being allocated a budget and several weeks to construct a road-legal vehicle which, if classified as a car, must pass the Single Vehicle Approval test. However, a few of the teams managed to avoid taking the SVA test, either by using an unmodified car chassis, such as the Chaos Crew in Series 2, who placed the body shell from an ice cream truck onto the unchanged chassis of a Range Rover, or by using their livelihood in order to classify their vehicle as an agricultural show-piece (The Barley Pickers in series 1). The teams then drove to various tests in-convoy across the UK where they were given eight hours at a local scrapheap to modify their vehicles for the test{{spaced ndash}}although, for all but the final test, the vehicles had to be returned to road-legal condition afterwards. In Series 3, four teams were given vehicles and participated in 5 challenges in the [[Galloway Forest Park]]. They had to adapt the vehicles to perform two different tasks in each episode. This series was unusual for Scrapheap in that the build time was added together with the time taken to complete each stage.

Former [[North Dakota]] Governor [[Ed Schafer]] was one of many notable people appearing on the show. Schafer was on during the fifth season as a member of the High Flyers which lost to the Jet Doctors in the Fifth Series finale. The first season was filmed in the UK, and included a competition between the grand winner of UK series 3, Megalomaniacs, and the US season 1 champs the Long Brothers (who won).

The first season of the show was nominated for an Emmy award.

The show was reformatted as '''''Junkyard Mega-Wars''''' to consist of two regular captains, who each select three people to help in the challenge. The show was presented by [[Rossi Morreale]] and [[Bobbi Sue Luther]].

* '''Season 1''' (2002){{spaced ndash}}Captains: Bowser and Crash

== Early life and education ==

Sibyl M. Rock was born on August 1, 1909&lt;ref name="Nier"/&gt; in [[Butte, Montana]]. Her father was a telephone technician, which may have interested her in technology. She entered the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] in 1927,&lt;ref name="UC1927"&gt;{{cite book|title=Catalogue of Officers and Students for 1927-1928|date=1927|publisher=University of California at Los Angeles|location=Los Angeles, California|chapter=University of California at Los Angeles, Directory of Students, for Fall Semester 1927|page=102|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sgQ5AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA4-PA102|accessdate=6 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; earning a degree in Mathematics in 1931.&lt;ref name="UC1931"&gt;{{cite book|title=Register|date=1931|publisher=University of California at Los Angeles|location=Los Angeles, California|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; While at UCLA, she was president of the local chapter of [[Pi Mu Epsilon]], the national mathematics society.&lt;ref name=Sawyer /&gt; She also received a [[Phi Beta Kappa]] key.&lt;ref name=control&gt;{{cite journal |date=February 1955 |title=Sibyl Rock puts digits to work |journal=Control Engineering |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Phi Beta Kappa Key: The Official Publication of the United Chapters of Phi Beta Kappa|date=1928|publisher=Free Press Printing Company|location=New York|volume=7|page=584}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rock was employed as a "geophysical computer" in the [[petroleum industry]], first at Rieber Laboratories, and then in 1938 at [[Herbert Hoover, Jr.]]'s newly formed United Geophysical Corporation. She transferred into United's engineering and instrument subsidiary, Consolidated Engineering Corporation, when they began to develop the mass spectrometer as a commercial product.&lt;ref name=control /&gt; The first 21-101 Mass Spectrometer was delivered in December 1942.&lt;ref name=petroleum&gt;{{cite web |title=Petroleum Industry |publisher=[[Chemical Heritage Foundation]] |url=http://www.chemheritage.org/research/policy-center/oral-history-program/projects/critical-mass/oil.aspx |accessdate=15 October 2013 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120412224319/http://www.chemheritage.org/research/policy-center/oral-history-program/projects/critical-mass/oil.aspx |archivedate=12 April 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Meyerson&gt;{{cite journal |last=Meyerson |first=Seymour |date=1986 |title=Reminiscences of the early days of mass spectrometry in the petroleum industry |journal=Organic Mass Spectrometry |doi= 10.1002/oms.1210210406 |volume=21 |issue=4 |pages=197–208 |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/abstract/110438931/ABSTRACT |accessdate=2008-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Judson'&gt;{{Cite web |last=Judson |first=Charles |title=Consolidated Electrodynamics Corporation CEC 100 Series mass Spectrometers |publisher=American Society for Mass Spectrometry |url=http://msr.dom.wustl.edu/pubs-misc/cec-103c.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2018-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nier"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nier|first1=Keith A.|last2=Yergey|first2=Alfred L.|last3=Gale|first3=P.

In sales, she worked closely with people at chemical and refining companies who were potential customers for the mass spectrometer and early digital computers, identifying their needs and concerns. People such as [[Seymour Meyerson]], who worked for Standard Oil of Indiana, were active contributors to Rock's CEC Users' Group.&lt;ref name=Meyerson /&gt;&lt;ref name=chemheritage /&gt; Rock transferred again in 1952, to the organization's newly formed computer division.&lt;ref name=Sawyer /&gt; As of 1953, she was "in charge of sales and application functions of the Computer Division" with the title "Acting Manager, Application Service"&lt;ref name=Sawyer /&gt; and was the first female sales engineer of [[ElectroData Corporation]].&lt;ref name=control /&gt;

=== Mixture analysis, manuals and standards ===
[[File:Sibyl Rock Computing Manual 1946.jpg|thumb|right|The title page of Rock's 1946 CEC Computing Manual]]
By the mid-1940s Rock had made several outstanding contributions to the field. She devised many of the procedures of mixture analysis, and wrote the computing manuals used by CEC's customers, such as the ''Computing Manual: Analysis of Gas and Liquid Mixtures by Means of the Mass Spectrometer'' (1946). Her work contributed to the creation of standards for instruments and methods in a rapidly developing field.&lt;ref name=chemheritage /&gt;

She also did basic analysis, with Martin Shepherd of the National Bureau of Standards, of the first Pasadena smog samples.&lt;ref name=control /&gt;&lt;ref name=chemheritage /&gt;&lt;ref name=smog&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shepherd |first1=Martin |last2=Rock |first2=S.

=== Solving simultaneous equations ===

Rock was also instrumental in developing mathematical techniques for analyzing the results from mass spectrometers.&lt;ref name=Judson /&gt; In 1946, with [[Clifford Berry]], she developed an [[analog computer]] capable of solving multiple simultaneous linear equations, suitable for the analysis of data from mass spectrometers.&lt;ref name=chemheritage /&gt; They patented an analog computer that could efficiently solve a series of 12 simultaneous equations in 12 unknowns.&lt;ref name=Datatron&gt;{{cite web |last=Sawyer |first=Tom |title=Tom's Datatron 205 |url=http://tjsawyer.com/B205Home.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090113000309/http://tjsawyer.com/B205Home.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=13 January 2009 |others= |accessdate=15 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== User experience and ongoing development ===
[[File:Sibyl Rock to Harold Wiley 1943.jpg|thumb|right|A letter from Sibyl Rock to Harold Wiley regarding computing, 1943]] ]]
Mass-spectrometer users were developing instruments for their own purposes on a lab-by-lab basis, modifying and experimenting with them at a rapid rate. Feedback from the field and effective communication about needs and problems were critical to CEC's success in building and marketing mass spectrometers. Sibyl Rock was engaged in developing the instruments and the procedures for their use. She was also a key person assisting Consolidated's customers in the use of those instruments and techniques, including the use of Cliff Berry's analog computer.&lt;ref name=chemheritage /&gt;

Rock understood the technical aspects of how the instrument worked and the mathematical aspects of the calculations it was supposed to compute. Because she worked closely with CEC's customer base, she also understood the instrumentation needs of CEC's growing list of customers. Rock collaborated with [[Harold Wiley]], manager of chemical instruments, to review both old and new instruments, assessing their operational status and identifying needed improvements. Rock continuously drew upon her knowledge of the latest methods used by customers and their critiques and problem reports about the instrumentation, to improve CEC's products.&lt;ref name=chemheritage /&gt;

=== The Datatron ===

Clifford Berry encouraged CEC to develop a [[digital computer]]. [[Harry Huskey]] and [[Ernst Sejersted Selmer|Ernst Selmer]] were involved as lecturers and consultants in the development process.&lt;ref name=Alrich&gt;{{cite web |last=Alrich |first=John |title=First-Hand:Engineering the Technology of the Future: Building High-Speed Computing Machines in the 1950s |publisher=IEEE Global History Network |url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/First-Hand:Engineering_the_Technology_of_the_Future:_Building_High-Speed_Computing_Machines_in_the_1950s |accessdate=18 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sibyl Rock worked closely with Ernst Selmer on coding problems for the machine before it even existed in hardware. She also encouraged potential customers to try coding problems for the Datatron, ensuring that the system would perform in ways that would be useful to them. She helped customers with coding and ensured that their problems would run on the "breadboard" and "prototype" systems.&lt;ref name=Datatron /&gt;

Sibyl Rock once described her work as follows:

'For the past several years I have written Product Specifications for digital computers and related peripheral gear. The engineering design is done by engineers. The Product Specification forms a "contract" between engineering and marketing to assure that both interested parties know what is to be built. Because the engineer may be too optimistic as to what he can produce and what reliability he can achieve, and because marketing wants the moon for zero dollars, the product specification writer is needed as a negotiator.'&lt;ref name=Sawyer /&gt;

Formal announcement of the new ElectroData 203 computer took place in February 1954. By 1956, ElectroData became the third largest manufacturer of computers in the world, but lacked the funds necessary to expand successfully. On July 1, 1956 [[Burroughs Corporation]] purchased ElectroData Corporation from CEC. The basic architecture remained the same even though the computer was marketed under various names: the CEC 30-201, CEC 30-203, the ElectroData 204 and 205, and the Burroughs 205.

In 1961, the Datatron 205 was used during the first launch of a Saturn rocket at Cape Canaveral, to analyze real-time guidance data.&lt;ref name=Datatron /&gt;

== Personal life and death ==
Rock actively encouraged women and girls to become mathematicians and to take up careers in engineering.&lt;ref name=control /&gt;

She died November 17, 1981 in Los Angeles, California.&lt;ref name=SSDI /&gt;

== Scholarly publications ==
In addition to the manuals she wrote, Rock was active in scholarly publishing and coauthored significant papers with several of her colleagues,&lt;ref name=chemheritage /&gt; including:

{{refimprove|date=September 2015}}
'''Silver service''' (in [[British English]]) is a method of [[foodservice]] that usually includes serving food at the table. It is a technique of transferring food from a service dish to the guest's plate from the left.

It is performed by a waiter by using service forks and spoons from the diner's left. In France, it is known as ''service à l'anglaise'' ("English service").&lt;ref name="service_english"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.annuaires-nseo.com/restaurants/lexique.php?pg=314 | title=Le dictionnaire de la restauration | publisher=N’S&amp;amp;O | accessdate=29 September 2015 | language=fr | quote=SERVICE A L'ANGLAISE: Principe identique au service à la Française mais, muni d'un couvert de service dans la main droite, le serveur (ou la serveuse) effectue lui-même le service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
* Silver service food is served from the left, and drinks and plated meals are served from the right.{{fact|date=September 2015}}
* Meals are served to the diner from platters, not plated in the kitchen.
* The guest to the host's right is served first, usually a female guest.
* Service continues to the right.
* Plates are cleared from the right,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nzqa.govt.nz/nqfdocs/units/pdf/14438.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; glasses from the right; again by starting with the guest to the host's right.
* Glasses are stacked in a diagonal to the right and away, with [[wine]] (by course) in order and then water glass in front.

* At a wedding, The Bride is served first, followed by the Bride's mother, then the Bridegroom, then to the left of the "top table" with the bridal party, restarting again at the other side of the table with the "Best Man" first then any other member of the Bridegroom's party.

Silver service, like all formal food service, is oriented for a right-handed waiter, left-handed waiters may use their right hand: to serve the food, the waiter stands behind the guest and to the guest's left, holds or supports the platter with their left hand and serves the food with their right hand. It is common for the waiter to hold the serving-fork above the serving-spoon both in the right hand, and use the fingers to manipulate the two as a [[pincers (tool)|pincer]] for picking up, holding and transferring the food. This technique or form requires much practice and dexterity. 
  

A modification of silver service is known as butler service.&lt;ref name="butler_service"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.butlersguild.com/index.php?subject=45 | title=Table Settings | publisher=The International Guild of Professional Butlers | accessdate=29 September 2015 | quote=BUTLER: The most time consuming. When seated, warm plates are placed before the guests. The meal is presented to the guest. This service has limited use today. If you are the only one serving, the number of diners has to be kept small. Six is the largest that one person can serve and keep the food hot. Many people are not accustomed to serving themselves from a platter and the delay just lets the food get cold. | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721172956/http://www.butlersguild.com/index.php?subject=45 | archivedate=21 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In butler service, the diner helps himself from a serving plate held by the waiter (butler). Traditionally, this type of service was used on Sunday evenings, when the [[waiting staff]] had the evening off and the butler helped out at dinner.{{Fact|date=December 2007}} In [[France]], this kind of service is known as ''service à la francaise'' ("French service").&lt;ref name="propos-de-chef"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.propos-de-chef.com/conseil-maitre-hotel/differents-types-de-service-au-restaurant/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715123048/http://www.propos-de-chef.com/conseil-maitre-hotel/differents-types-de-service-au-restaurant/ |archivedate=2011-07-15 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

'''Suvača''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Сувача}}) in [[Kikinda]], [[Serbia]], is one of the three remaining [[horse mill|horse-powered dry mills]] in the whole of [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.travel.rs/sr/srbija/zanimljivosti/suvaca Suvača] at SerbianTravel {{sr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mlin"&gt;[http://www.kikindskimlin.rs/mlinnekad-suvaca.htm Mlin nekad / Kikindska suvača] {{sr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suvača in Kikinda is characteristic of the [[Vojvodina]] area of the 19th century. It was built in 1899, and the mill stopped working in 1945. It is located in the western part of town, on the corner of Nemanjina and Moravska streets. The plot of land is {{convert|728|m2}}. Suvača is a mill for grinding grain that uses the work of horses as its driving force. The mill uses one to five pairs of horses. One pair of horses was able to grind up to {{convert|100|kg}} of grain per hour. According to tradition, the taste of bread from wheat ground in Suvača was excellent and high quality. In addition to cereals, the mill at Suvača would process pepper and cinnamon.&lt;ref name="mlin" /&gt;

==Architecture==
[[File:Kikinda, Suvača.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Suvača in [[Kikinda]], [[Serbia]]]]
Suvača consists of three connected parts: the drive space, the mill space, and the miller's apartment. The drive space is the compartment with a pyramid roof where the device is located that runs the mill stones. Although the entire facility called Suvača, Suvača is essentially the part of the building in which the device is located.&lt;ref name="SANU"&gt;{{CHS-SANU|Link=661|Name=Сувача}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main building is a multi-pyramid shape where the most important part of Suvača—the circular area where the grinding took place—is located. This section of the building is about {{convert|15|m}} in diameter, with a ceiling height in the center of the pyramid of {{convert|8.55|m}}. The roof construction is wooden, and is covered in tile. The building relies on fourteen low and three stubby pillars of bricks. Between the columns, the space is enclosed by wooden slat fencing. On the south side, instead of fences, gates were set up using wooden lattices for the introduction of horses into the building. The miller's apartment consists of three rooms: a sitting room, a kitchen, and a cellar. These rooms are located next to the mill area.&lt;ref name="SANU" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mlin" /&gt;

==Protection==
In 1951, Suvača was placed under state protection, and in 1990 it was proclaimed a [[Monuments of Culture of Exceptional Importance (Serbia)|Monument of Culture of Exceptional Importance]].&lt;ref name="SANU" /&gt;

In March 2018 a reconstruction of the Suvača complex began. The entire wooden mechanism of the mill will be conserved and reconstructed. An additional object will be built within the complex. It is planned to serve as a souvenir and gift shop and as the workshop during certain happenings and festivities. Reconstruction is part of the wider cross-border project which includes the reconstructions of the windmills in [[Orom (Kanjiža)|Orom]], near [[Kanjiža]], and [[Kiskunfélegyháza]], in [[Hungary]]. The work should be finished by April 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | author = J.T.Crnogorac | title = С Мађарима обнављају сувачу | trans-title = Dry mill is being renovated jointly with the Hungarians | newspaper = [[Politika]] | page = 14 | language = Serbian | date = 6 May 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10784">The Tiva-C ({{aka}} TM4C) LaunchPads&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ti.com/launchpad TI LaunchPad Product Description]&lt;/ref&gt; are inexpensive self-contained, [[single-board microcontroller]]s, about the size of a credit card, featuring an [[ARM Cortex-M4F]] 32-bit [[CPU]] operating at 80 to 120&amp;nbsp;MHz, manufactured by [[Texas Instruments]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ti.com/lit/ml/spmt284/spmt284.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 
The TM4C Series TM4C123G LaunchPad&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ti.com/tool/ek-tm4c123gxl EK-TM4C123GXL LaunchPad Evaluation Kit]&lt;/ref&gt; is an upgrade from TI's Stellaris LaunchPad adding support options for motion control PWMs and USB Host functionality. The more recently released TM4C1294 Connected LaunchPad&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ti.com/tool/ek-tm4c1294xl EK-TM4C1294XL Connected LaunchPad Evaluation Kit]&lt;/ref&gt; is the first cloud-connected offering in TI's LaunchPad ecosystem and provides a solid foundation for beginning and evaluating embedded IoT designs.

There are many I/O pins (40 to 80 depending upon version) that have multi-personality. This means that they can be easily configured as digital inputs or outputs, analog inputs and outputs or other functions, allowing a great variety of applications, are just the multiple serial ports have the ability to interface with more items such as test cards or other communication modules, etc. Among those pins there are included the GND and POWER (3.3&amp;nbsp;V) pins.

The clock is 80 or 120&amp;nbsp;MHz (vers based), which makes them 5 to over 7 times faster than the [[Arduino Uno]]'s 16&amp;nbsp;MHz ATmega328P microcontroller. As with any Cortex M4, the [[CPU]] has some DSP (digital signal processor) instructions, with some limitations. One can do signal processing, for example, sampling a human voice with a good quality, able to be processed in MATLAB. {{citation needed|date=October 2014}} The CPU contains the optional [[floating-point unit]] with single-precision floating point operations supported.

They have an additional USB port which can act as USB host, allowing the connection of multiple devices and the "Connected" one has an integrated 10/100 Ethernet MAC+PHY for Internet connectivity. They also have a temperature sensor and on-board LED(s) and RGB LED(s), which allows you to generate various colors by combining the three basic colors (red, blue and green) of the additive color synthesis.

The Tiva/TM4C LaunchPads come preloaded with software to demonstrate many of the capabilities of the ARM microcontroller and with a quickstart application to get up and running within minutes.

=== Booster packs ===
Both Tiva C Series LaunchPads conform to a [http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/BYOB standard for BoosterPack layout] defined by Texas Instruments.

TI has a [http://www.ti.com/tool/boostxl-senshub Sensor Hub BoosterPack] designed exclusively to fit the TM4C123GXL LaunchPad.

==== Internet of Things ====

[[Internet of Things]] is made possible with the [http://www.ti.com/tool/cc3100boost SimpleLink Wi-Fi CC3100 BoosterPack].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ti.com/tool/cc3100boost&lt;/ref&gt;

==== LCD ====
A demonstration of [[liquid crystal display|LCD]] driving can be achieved with LaunchPad by fitting a [[Nokia|Nokia LCD]], graphic display (not included in the kit). However, the LCD interface consumes many of the [[input/output|I/O]] pins.

Another solution is the 320 x 240 pixel TFT QVGA display with resistive touch screen [http://www.kentecdisplay.com/plus/view.php?aid=86 Kentec 3.5" screen]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kentecdisplay.com/plus/view.php?aid=86&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://store.ti.com/BOOSTXL-K350QVG-S1.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; working through the [[SPI bus]].

=== Software ===
The LaunchPad comes preloaded with a RGB quickstart application

Supported by TivaWare for C Series software including the USB library and the peripheral driver library

Tiva C Series TM4C123G LaunchPad BoosterPack XL Interface, which features stackable headers to expand the capabilities of the Tiva C Series LaunchPad development platform

Support for the ARM Cortex-M4 DSP instructions is provided via ARM's [http://www.keil.com/pack/doc/CMSIS/DSP/html/index.html CMSIS-DSP software package]

TivaWare for C Series includes support for [[FreeRTOS]] and [http://www.ti.com/tool/ti-rtos TI-RTOS]

The LaunchPad LM4F120 and TM3C123G can also be programmed using [http://energia.nu Energia],&lt;ref&gt;http://energia.nu&lt;/ref&gt; an [[Arduino]]-like IDE based on the [[Wiring (development platform)|Wiring]] framework. Energia includes the libraries for the [http://www.ti.com/tool/cc3100boost SimpleLink Wi-Fi CC3100 BoosterPack].

=== Reprogramming ===
Software may be written for the LaunchPad using the [http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/Download_CCS assembly language] or [https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded GCC (GNU Cprogramming language)] with Energia, a free variant of the Arduino [[integrated development environment]] (IDE). A pre-installed bootloader program allows the board to be re-programmed with a standard USB 2.0 port (requiring no special hardware). The board also has ISP and [[JTAG]] ports for [[in-circuit programming]] and debugging.

=== Popularity ===
The LaunchPad is becoming popular among hobbyists for its low price of about $13 USD, its flexibility, the availability of free development software, and the ability to reprogram it without using special hardware.

== LaunchPad projects ==
Many fully usable projects have been built using the LaunchPad as a base platform, often with few or no additional parts.
There are free plans to convert the LaunchPad into a portable ARM-ISP device for programming a whole family of ARM devices. 
{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}
Several plans available on the web to convert a LaunchPad into an MP3 player. 
{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Its diversified products and services include information technology and communications equipment and systems, electronic components and materials, power systems, industrial and social infrastructure systems, consumer electronics, household appliances, medical equipment, office equipment, as well as lighting and logistics.

Toshiba was founded in 1939 as '''Tokyo Shibaura Denki K.K.''' through the merger of Shibaura Seisaku-sho (founded in 1875) and Tokyo Denki (founded in 1890). The company name was officially changed to Toshiba Corporation in 1978. 

In 2018 the company sold Westinghouse, one of its many prior acquisitions, which had included:
* Semp in 1977, 
* [[Westinghouse Electric Company|Westinghouse Electric LLC]] in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.toshiba.co.jp/about/press/2006_02/pr0601.htm|title=Toshiba Acquires Westnghouse From BNFL|date=6 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;, 
* [[Landis+Gyr]] in 2011, and 
* [[IBM]]'s [[point-of-sale]] business in 2012.

Toshiba is organized into four groupings: the Digital Products Group, the Electronic Devices Group, the Home Appliances Group and the Social Infrastructure Group. It is listed on the [[Tokyo Stock Exchange]], where it is a constituent of the [[Nikkei 225]] and [[TOPIX]] indices, the [[Osaka Securities Exchange]] and the [[Nagoya Stock Exchange]]. Toshiba is the ninth largest semiconductor manufacturer in the world.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

On 11 April 2017, Toshiba filed unaudited quarterly results because of uncertainties at Westinghouse, which had filed for [[Chapter 11 bankruptcy]] protection. Toshiba stated that "substantial doubt about the company's ability to continue as a going concern exists".&lt;ref name=bbc-20170411/&gt;

==History==
===1939 to 2000===
Toshiba was founded in 1939 by the merger of [[Shibaura Seisakusho]] (Shibaura Engineering Works)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shibaura.co.jp/e/company/history.html Corporate History | Shibaura Mechatronics Corporation].

Shibaura Seisakusho had been founded as [[Tanaka Seisakusho]] by [[Tanaka Hisashige]] in July 1875 as Japan's first manufacturer of [[telegraph]] equipment.&lt;ref name="Odagiri-Goto"&gt;{{cite book |last=Odagiri|first=Hiroyuki|title=Technology and Industrial Development in Japan |publisher=Clarendon Press, Oxford|year=1996|isbn=0-19-828802-6|page=158}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1904, it was renamed Shibaura Seisakusho. Through the first decades of the 20th century, Shibaura Seisakusho had become a major manufacturer of heavy electrical machinery as Japan modernized during the [[Meiji Era]] and became a world industrial power. Tokyo Denki was founded as [[Hakunetsusha]] in 1890 and had been Japan's first producer of incandescent electric lamps. It later diversified into the manufacture of other consumer products and in 1899 had been renamed Tokyo Denki. The merger of Shibaura and Tokyo Denki created a new company called Tokyo [[Shibaura]] Denki (Tokyo Shibaura Electric) ({{lang|ja-Hani|[[wikt:東京|'''東'''京]] [[wikt:芝浦|'''芝'''浦]] [[wikt:電気|電気]]}}). It was soon nicknamed Toshiba, but it was not until 1978 that the company was officially renamed Toshiba Corporation.

The group expanded rapidly, driven by a combination of organic growth and by acquisitions, buying heavy engineering and primary industry firms in the 1940s and 1950s. Groups created include [[EMI Music Japan|Toshiba Music Industries/Toshiba EMI]] (1960), Toshiba International Corporation (1970s) Toshiba Electrical Equipment (1974), Toshiba Chemical (1974), Toshiba Lighting and Technology (1989), Toshiba America Information Systems (1989) and Toshiba Carrier Corporation (1999).

Toshiba is responsible for a number of Japanese firsts, including radar (1912), the TAC digital computer (1954), transistor television and microwave oven (1959), [[videophone|color video phone]] (1971), Japanese [[word processor]] (1978), MRI system (1982), laptop personal computer (1986), NAND EEPROM (1991), DVD (1995), the [[Libretto (notebook)|Libretto]] sub-notebook personal computer (1996) and [[HD DVD]] (2005).

In 1977, Toshiba acquired the Brazilian company Semp (Sociedade Eletromercantil Paulista), subsequently forming Semp Toshiba through the combination of the two companies' South American operations.

In 1987, Tocibai Machine, a subsidiary of Toshiba, was accused of illegally selling CNC [[milling machine]]s used to produce very quiet [[submarine]] propellers to the [[Soviet Union]] in violation of the [[CoCom]] agreement, an international [[embargo]] on certain countries to [[COMECON]] countries. The [[Toshiba-Kongsberg scandal]] involved a subsidiary of Toshiba and the Norwegian company [[Kongsberg Defence &amp; Aerospace|Kongsberg Vaapenfabrikk]]. The incident strained relations between the [[United States]] and [[Japan]], and resulted in the arrest and prosecution of two senior executives, as well as the imposition of [[Economic sanctions|sanctions]] on the company by both countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Roderick|last=Seeman|title=Toshiba Case—CoCom - Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Control Revision|date=April 1987|publisher=The Japan Lawletter|url=http://japanlaw.info/lawletter/april87/fdf.htm|accessdate=18 September 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927102631/http://japanlaw.info/lawletter/april87/fdf.htm|archivedate=27 September 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senator [[John Heinz]] of Pennsylvania said "What Toshiba and Kongsberg did was ransom the security of the United States for $517 million."

===2000 to 2010===
In 2001, Toshiba signed a contract with [[Orion Electric]], one of the world's largest [[Original equipment manufacturer|OEM]] consumer video electronic makers and suppliers, to manufacture and supply finished consumer TV and video products for Toshiba to meet the increasing demand for the North American market. The contract ended in 2008, ending seven years of OEM production with Orion.

In December 2004, Toshiba quietly announced it would discontinue manufacturing traditional in-house [[cathode-ray tube]] (CRT) televisions. In 2006, Toshiba terminated production of in-house plasma TVs. To ensure its future competitiveness in the flat-panel digital television and display market, Toshiba has made a considerable investment in a new kind of display technology called [[Surface-conduction electron-emitter display|SED]]. Before [[World War II]], Toshiba was a member of the [[Mitsui|Mitsui Group]] [[zaibatsu]] ([[Family business|family-controlled]] [[vertical monopoly]]). Today Toshiba is a member of the Mitsui [[keiretsu]] (a set of companies with interlocking business relationships and shareholdings), and still has preferential arrangements with Mitsui Bank and the other members of the keiretsu.  Membership in a keiretsu has traditionally meant loyalty, both corporate and private, to other members of the keiretsu or allied keiretsu. This loyalty can extend as far as the [[beer]] the employees consume, which in Toshiba's case is [[Asahi Breweries|Asahi]].

In July 2005, [[BNFL]] confirmed it planned to sell [[Westinghouse Electric Company]], then estimated to be worth $1.8 billion (£1 billion).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BNFL plans to sell Westinghouse|date=1 July 2004|publisher=BBC News|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4640411.stm|accessdate=11 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bid attracted interest from several companies including Toshiba, [[General Electric]] and [[Mitsubishi Heavy Industries]] and when the ''[[Financial Times]]'' reported on 23 January 2006 that Toshiba had won the bid, it valued the company's offer at $5 billion (£2.8 billion). The sale of Westinghouse by the Government of the United Kingdom surprised many industry experts, who questioned the wisdom of selling one of the world's largest producers of nuclear reactors shortly before the market for nuclear power was expected to grow substantially; [[People's Republic of China|China]], the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]] are all expected to invest heavily in nuclear power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BNFL to sell US power plant arm|date=23 January 2004|publisher=BBC News|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4638960.stm|accessdate=11 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The acquisition of [[Westinghouse Electric Company|Westinghouse]] for $5.4 billion was completed on 17 October 2006, with Toshiba obtaining a 77 percent share, and partners [[The Shaw Group]] a 20 percent share and Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co. Ltd. a 3 percent share.

In late 2007, Toshiba took over from [[Discover Card]] as the sponsor of the top-most screen of [[One Times Square]] in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/03/business/worldbusiness/03toshiba.html|title=Back in Times Square, Toshiba Stands Tall|accessdate=20 November 2011|publisher=The New York Times|date=3 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It displays the iconic 60-second [[New Year's Eve|New Year's]] countdown on its screen, as well as messages, greetings, and advertisements for the company.

In January 2009, Toshiba acquired the [[Hard disk drive|HDD]] business of [[Fujitsu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Toshiba and Fujitsu reach HDD deal: Nikkei|publisher=Reuters|date=14 January 2009|url= https://www.reuters.com/article/innovationNews/idUSTRE50D5LN20090114|accessdate= 14 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/159631/article.html|title=Toshiba to Acquire Fujitsu's Hard-disk Drive Business|accessdate=24 December 2012|publisher=PC World|date=17 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010 to 2013===
Toshiba announced on 16 May 2011, that it had agreed to acquire all of the shares of the Swiss-based advanced-power-meter maker [[Landis+Gyr]] for $2.3 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704904604576332501074832920.html|title=Toshiba to Buy Swiss Power Meter Maker|accessdate=20 May 2011|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|date=20 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 the company released a series of television models including the WL768, YL863, VL963 designed in collaboration with Danish designer [[Timothy Jacob Jensen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work = Flat Panel |title = Toshiba's Jacob Jensen Design TVs  |url = http://www.flatpanelshd.com/news.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1284471787}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2012, Toshiba was accused of fixing the prices of LCD panels in the United States at a high level. While such claims were denied by Toshiba,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-18700689|title=Toshiba|date=4 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; they have agreed to settle alongside several other manufacturers for a total of $571 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.crn.com/news/mobility/240003498/toshiba-lg-au-optronics-to-settle-lcd-price-fixing-case.htm| title=Toshiba|date=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2013, Toshiba completed its acquisition of Vijai Electricals Limited plant at Hyderabad and set up its own base for manufacturing of transmission and distribution products (transformers and switchgears) under the Social Infrastructure Group in India as Toshiba Transmission &amp; Distribution Systems (India) Private Limited.

Toshiba announced in early 2015 that they would stop making televisions in its own factories. From 2015 onward, Toshiba televisions will be made by [[Compal Electronics|Compal]] for the U.S., or by [[Vestel]] and other manufacturers for the European market.

In January 2016, Toshiba's security division unveiled a new bundle of services for schools that use its surveillance equipment. The program, which is intended for both K-12 and higher education, includes education discounts, alerts and post-warranty support, among other features, on its IP-based security gear.&lt;ref&gt;Dian Schaffhauser, The Journal. “[https://thejournal.com/articles/2016/01/19/toshiba-intros-surveillance-education-program.aspx Toshiba Launches Surveillance Education Program].” 19 January 2016. 19 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of March 2016, Toshiba is preparing to start construction on a cutting-edge new semiconductor plant in Japan that will mass-produce chips based on the ultra-dense flash variant.

In September 2015, Toshiba shares fell to their lowest point in two and a half years. The firm said in a statement that its net losses for the quarterly period were 12.3 billion yen ($102m; £66m). The company noted poor performances in its televisions, home appliances and personal computer businesses.&lt;ref&gt;BBC News.

In December 2015, Muromachi said the episode had wiped about $8 billion off Toshiba's market value.  He forecast a record 550 billion yen (about US $4.6 billion) annual loss and warned the company would have to overhaul its TV and computer businesses.  Toshiba would not be raising funds for two years, he said.  The next week, a company spokesperson announced Toshiba would in early 2016 seek 300 billion yen ($2.5 billion), taking the company's indebtedness to more than 1 trillion yen (about $8.3 billion).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-29/toshiba-seeks-2-5-billion-credit-line-to-pay-for-restructuring |title=Toshiba Seeks $2.5 Billion Credit Line to Pay for Reforms |last1=Alpeyev |first1=Pavel |last2=Amano |first2=Takashi|publisher=Bloomberg |date=29 December 2015 |accessdate=8 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction delays, regulatory changes and cost overruns at Westinghouse built nuclear facilities [[Vogtle Electric Generating Plant|Vogtle units 3 and 4]] in Waynesboro, Georgia and [[Virgil C. Summer Nuclear Generating Station|VC Summer units 2 and 3]] in South Carolina, are cited as the main causes of the dramatic fall in Toshiba's financial performance and collapse in share price. Fixed priced construction contracts negotiated by Westinghouse with Georgia Power have left Toshiba with uncharted liabilities that will likely result in the sale of key Toshiba operating subsidiaries to secure the company's future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Crooks|first1=Ed|title=Toshiba brought to its knees by two US nuclear plants|url=https://www.ft.com/content/b7053ab4-f45e-11e6-95ee-f14e55513608|accessdate=20 February 2017|publisher=Financial Times|date=17 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 April 2017, Toshiba filed unaudited quarterly results. Auditors [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]] had not signed of the accounts because of uncertainties at Westinghouse. Toshiba stated that "substantial doubt about the company's ability to continue as a going concern exists".&lt;ref name=bbc-20170411&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-39564956 |title=Toshiba files unaudited results and says future is in doubt |work=BBC News |date=11 April 2017 |accessdate=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nasdaq-20170411&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nasdaq.com/article/toshiba-files-earnings-without-auditor-endorsement-delisting-risk-rises-20170411-00168 |title=Toshiba files earnings without auditor endorsement, delisting risk rises |agency=Reuters |newspaper=NASDAQ |date=11 April 2017 |accessdate=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 April 2017, Toshiba announced its decision to replace its auditor after less than a year.

Later that month, the company announced that it would pull out of its long-standing sponsorships of the Japanese television programs ''[[Sazae-san]]'', ''Nichiyō Gekijo'', and the video screens topping out [[One Times Square]] in [[New York City]].

===3D television===
In October 2010, Toshiba unveiled the Toshiba Regza GL1 21" LED backlit LCD TV glasses-free [[3D television|3D prototype]] at [[CEATEC]] 2010. This system supports 3D capability without glasses (utilising an integral imaging system of 9 parallax images with vertical lenticular sheet). The retail product was released in December 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2010/10/04/toshiba-regza-gl1-wants-you-to-put-down-the-glasses-enjoy-the-3|title=Toshiba Regza GL1 wants you to put down the glasses, enjoy the 3D|author=Vlad Savov|publisher=[[Engadget]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===HD DVD===
{{Details|HD DVD}}
[[File:Hd dvd logo.png|thumb]]
On 19 February 2008, Toshiba announced that it would be discontinuing its HD DVD storage format following defeat in a format "war" against [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Toshiba Announces Discontinuation of HD DVD Businesses|date=19 February 2008|publisher=Toshiba|url= http://www.toshiba.co.jp/about/press/2008_02/pr1903.htm|accessdate=15 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The HD DVD format had failed after most of the major US film studios backed the Blu-ray format, which was developed by [[Sony]], Panasonic, [[Philips]] and [[Pioneer Corporation]]. Conceding the abandonment of HD DVD, Toshiba's President, [[Atsutoshi Nishida]] said "We concluded that a swift decision would be best [and] if we had continued, that would have created problems for consumers, and we simply had no chance to win".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/2008/02/19/toshiba-hddvd-format-tech-cx_pco_0219paidcontent.html#bdb88d433c33|title=Toshiba Gives Up On HD DVD; To Be Out By End Of March|work=[[Forbes]]|date=19 Feb 2008|accessdate=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Toshiba continued to supply retailers with machines until the end of March 2008, and continued to provide technical support to the estimated one million people worldwide who owned HD DVD players and recorders. Toshiba announced a new line of stand-alone Blu-ray players as well as drives for PCs and laptops, and subsequently joined the BDA, the industry body which oversees development of the Blu-ray format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/8192840.stm#comments|title=Toshiba joins Blu-ray disc camp|work=BBC News|date=10 August 2009|accessdate=6 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===REGZA===
[[File:REGZA logo.svg|thumb]]
REGZA ('''R'''eal '''E'''xpression '''G'''uaranteed by Ama'''z'''ing '''A'''rchitecture) is a unified television brand owned and manufactured by Toshiba. In 2010 REGZA name disappeared from the North American market, and from March 2015&lt;ref&gt;https://www.toshiba.co.jp/about/ir/en/news/20150129_1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; new TVs carrying the Toshiba name are designed and produced by [[Compal Electronics]], a Taiwanese company, which Toshiba has licensed its name to.   REGZA is also used in [[Android (operating system)|Android]]-based smartphones that were developed by Fujitsu Toshiba Mobile Communications.

===Chromebook===
In October 2014, Toshiba released the Chromebook 2, a new version with a thinner profile and a much-improved display. The Chromebook runs exclusively on [[Chrome OS]] and gives users free Google Drive storage and access to a collection of apps and extensions at the Chrome Web Store.&lt;ref&gt;By Sara Angeles, BusinessNewsDaily. “[http://www.businessnewsdaily.com/7368-toshiba-chromebook-2-business.html Toshiba Chromebook 2: A Better Chromebook for Business?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141030182753/http://www.businessnewsdaily.com/7368-toshiba-chromebook-2-business.html |date=30 October 2014 }}.” 28 October 2014. 29 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===3D flash memory===
In March 2015, Toshiba announced the development of the first 48-layer, three-dimensional flash memory. The new flash memory is based on a vertical stacking technology that Toshiba calls BiCS (Bit Cost Scaling), stores two bits of data per transistor and can store 128Gbits (16GB) per chip.&lt;ref&gt;By Lucas Mearian, ComputerWorld. “[http://www.computerworld.com/article/2902310/toshiba-announces-industrys-densest-3d-flash-memory.html Toshiba announces industry's densest 3D flash memory].” 26 March 2015. 21 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental record==
Toshiba has been judged as making "low" efforts to lessen their impact on the environment. In November 2012, they came second from the bottom in [[Greenpeace]]'s 18th edition of the Guide to Greener Electronics that ranks electronics companies according to their policies on products, energy and sustainable operations.&lt;ref name=Greenpeace&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/Guide-to-Greener-Electronics/18th-Edition/|title=Guide to Greener Electronics|publisher=[[Greenpeace]]|date=November 2012|accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Toshiba received 2.3 of a possible 10 points, with the top company ([[WIPRO]]) receiving 7.1 points. "Zero" scores were received in the categories "Clean energy policy advocacy", "Use of recycled plastics in products" and "Policy and practice on sustainable sourcing of fibres for paper".

In 2010, Toshiba reported that all of its new LCD TVs comply with the [[Energy Star]] standards and 34 models exceed the requirements by 30% or more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toshiba.co.jp/dm_env/dme/develop.htm|title=Development of Environmentally Conscious Products: Toshiba Visual Products Company / Toshiba Storage Products Company Environmental Conservation Activities|publisher=Toshiba|accessdate=17 August 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110129005012/http://www.toshiba.co.jp/dm_env/dme/develop.htm|archive-date=29 January 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Toshiba also partnered with China's Tsinghua University in 2008 in order to form a research facility to focus on energy conservation and the environment.&lt;ref name=japancorp.net&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japancorp.net/Article.Asp?Art_ID=17699|title=Japan’s Corporate Network|date=14 April 2008|accessdate=27 April 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100812045537/http://www.japancorp.net/Article.Asp?Art_ID=17699|archive-date=12 August 2010|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new Toshiba Energy and Environment Research Center is located in Beijing where forty students from the university will work to research electric power equipment and new technologies that will help stop the global warming process.&lt;ref name=japancorp.net/&gt; Through this partnership, Toshiba hopes to develop products that will better protect the environment and save China.&lt;ref name=japancorp.net/&gt; This contract between Tsinghua University and Toshiba originally began in October 2007 when they signed an agreement on joint energy and environment research.&lt;ref name=japancorp.net/&gt; The projects that they conduct work to reduce car pollution and to create power systems that don’t negatively affect the environment.&lt;ref name=japancorp.net/&gt;

On 28 December 1970 Toshiba began the construction of unit 3 of the [[Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nuctrans.org/Nuc_Trans/locations/daiichi/daiichi.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050215185107/http://www.nuctrans.org/Nuc_Trans/locations/daiichi/daiichi.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=15 February 2005|title=Nuclear Reactor Maps: Fukushima-Daiichi|accessdate=21 March 2011|publisher=Nuclear Transparency in the Asia Pacific}}
&lt;/ref&gt; which was damaged in the [[Fukushima I nuclear accidents]] on 14 March 2011. In April 2011, CEO Norio Sasaki declared nuclear energy would "remain as a strong option" even after the Fukushima I nuclear accidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nb20110422n1.html|title=Silver lining in sight for makers of solar panels|accessdate=23 April 2011|last=Yasu|first=Mariko|author2=Maki Shiraki|date=22 April 2011|publisher=[[The Japan Times]] online|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5y9cK8XNe?url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nb20110422n1.html|archivedate=23 April 2011|quote=For Toshiba, Japan's biggest maker of nuclear reactors, atomic energy still has the edge over other power sources. "Even if we hypothetically say an accident occurs once in every 30 years and that we need to consider the cost for radiation leak problems, we're also left with an issue of reducing carbon dioxide", Toshiba President Norio Sasaki said in Tokyo last week. "Nuclear power will remain as a strong option."|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2013, Toshiba (Japan) entered the solar power business in Germany, installing PV systems on apartment buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ren21.net/Portals/0/documents/Resources/GSR/2014/GSR2014_full%20report_low%20res.pdf|title=Renewables 2014 Global Status Report, page 50|publisher=|accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2879">'''Train speed optimization''', also known as '''Zuglaufoptimierung''', is a system that reduces the need for [[train]]s to brake and accelerate, resulting in smoother and more efficient operation.

While train speed optimization needs some technical infrastructure, it is more of an operational concept than a technical installation. One can relatively easily implement train speed optimization using for instance [[cab signalling]] (e.g. using [[ETCS]]), but the presence of a cab signalling system does not necessarily mean that it uses train speed optimization. Train speed optimization may also be implemented using conventional [[Railway signalling|signalling]].

==Conventional signal operation==
Usually, trains are allowed to run at the maximum speed the track allows until the distant [[Railway signal|signal]] of next occupied block. This is inefficient in many cases, because this way the train comes to a halt in front of the red signal and has to accelerate again from zero.

==Advantages using train speed optimization==
If the train slows down much earlier, it reaches, given the right timing, the distant signal just when the home signal switches to green. This way, the train does not need to stop. Thus, wear on the brakes is reduced and the train uses less energy. But the main reason, especially for trains that accelerate slowly, is that the train passes the home signal at high speed, compared to the conventional case where the train often has to accelerate from standstill. This effectively increases track capacity, because the time it takes for the train to run from the distant signal (that has just turned green) to the home signal is often much less than the time it takes for a train to accelerate from the home signal.

==Equipment==
For a train speed optimization system to work, it is necessary to have a signalling system which is capable of displaying several different speeds, for instance 40, 60, 90 km/h and the full line speed, which also requires a [[train protection system]] that is able to handle these cases ([[cab signalling]] may replace these installations). Further, the track must be equipped with [[inductive loop]]s that detect the presence of trains with sufficient precision (or other means of detecting the positions of the trains). Finally a computer system is needed that is able to reasonably predict the movements of the trains for the next few minutes.

==Train speed optimization in practice==
The expensive and complicated installations usually only make sense for heavily used routes.

A '''train whistle''' or '''air whistle''' (originally referred to as a '''steam trumpet''') is an audible signaling device on a [[steam locomotive]], used to warn that the train is approaching, and to communicate with rail workers. Modern diesel and electric locomotives primarily use a powerful [[air horn]] instead of a whistle as an audible warning device. However, the word ''whistle'' continues to be used by railroaders in  referring to such signaling practices as "whistling off" (sounding the horn when a train gets underway).

The need for a whistle on a locomotive exists because trains move on fixed [[rail tracks|rails]] and thus are uniquely susceptible to [[collision]].  This susceptibility is exacerbated by a train's enormous weight and inertia, which make it difficult to quickly stop when encountering an obstacle. Hence a means of warning others of the approach of a train from a distance is necessary. As train whistles are inexpensive compared to other warning devices, the use of loud and distinct whistles became the preferred solution for railway operators.

[[Steam whistle]]s were almost always actuated with a [[pull cord]] (or sometimes a [[lever]]) that permitted proportional ([[tracker action|tracker]]) action, so that some form of "expression" could be put into the sound. Many locomotive operators would have their own style of blowing the whistle, and it was often apparent who was operating the locomotive by the sound. Modern locomotives often make use of a push button switch to operate the air horn, eliminating any possibility of altering the horn's volume or pitch.

==History==
[[File:British_Rail_Class_483_Air_whistle_closeup.jpg|thumb|right|Close-up of an air whistle mounted on a [[British Rail Class 483]] EMU working on the [[Island Line, Isle of Wight|Island Line]]. The whistles on the Class 483s were used by the previous [[British Rail Class 485 and 486| Class 485 and 486]] units and even the [[British Rail Class 71|Class 71]] locomotives and were fitted to the Class 483 units when the trains were rebuilt from [[1938 tube stock]] in 1989. Like the Class 483, Tube trains continue to use air whistles to this day, with modern stock still required to have them present.]]
John Holliday describes the history of train whistles as originating in 1832, when a stationmaster suggested, at the opening of the [[Leicester and Swannington Railway]], that the trains should have an audible signaling device. A local musical instrument builder was commissioned to provide a steam-powered whistle, then known as a "steam trumpet".

The article also describes a train collision with a cart, where the driver had blown a horn (steam whistles having not as yet been invented). One account states that Weatherburn, the engine driver, had "mouthblown his horn" at the crossing in an attempt to prevent the accident, but that no attention had been paid to this audible warning, perhaps because it had not been heard. Although nobody was injured, the accident was deemed serious enough to warrant George Stephenson’s personal intervention. Stephenson subsequently called a meeting of directors and accepted the suggestion of the company manager, Ashlin Bagster, that a horn or whistle which could be activated by steam should be constructed and fixed to the locomotives. Stephenson later visited a musical instrument maker in Duke Street in Leicester, who, on Stephenson's instructions, constructed a "steam trumpet", which was tested in the presence of the Board of Directors ten days later.

Stephenson mounted the whistle on the top of the boiler's steam dome, which delivers dry steam to the cylinders for locomotion. The device was apparently about {{convert|18|in|mm}} high and had an ever-widening trumpet shape with a {{convert|6|in|mm|adj=on}} diameter at its top or mouth. The company went on to mount similar devices on its other locomotives.

There is another account that sets the invention of the steam whistle against the actual opening of the line in 1832, rather than associating it with a specific incident.&lt;ref name=LC&gt;{{cite web|last=Butt|first=Stephen|title=The Steam Whistle|url=http://leicesterchronicler.com/whistle.htm|publisher=Leicester Chronicler|accessdate=2012-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==North American usage==
North American steam locomotive whistles have different sounds from one another. They come in many forms, from tiny little single-note shriekers (called "banshees" on the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]]) to larger plain whistles with deeper tones (a deep, plain train whistle is the "hooter" of the [[Norfolk &amp; Western]], used on their A- and Y-class [[Mallet locomotive]]s). Even more well known were the multi-chime train whistles. Nathan of New York copied and improved [[Casey Jones]]'s boiler-tube chime whistle by casting the six chambers into a single bell, with open "steps" on top to save on casting. This whistle is still considered the "king of train whistles".{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} It is the most copied train whistle in the United States, and many railroads' shops cast their own version of it.

Another very popular American train whistle was, again, a Nathan product. This was a five-note whistle, with a much shorter bell, and therefore, much higher in pitch. This whistle produced a bright G-major 6th chord (GBDEG) and, again, was heavily imitated, copies being made by many different railroads. 

The most popular American chime train whistle was the three-note version. These were either commercially made (Crosby, Lunkenheimer, Star Brass, Hancock Inspirator Co. among others) or shop-made by the railroads themselves. Some famous and very melodious shop-made train whistles were Pennsy's passenger chimes and the [[Baltimore and Ohio]]'s step-top three chimes. But the most beloved of all three-chime train whistles to the public and railroaders alike were the deep-chorded "steamboat minor" long-bells.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} A well known commercially made chime was Hancock Inspirator Company's three-note step top. These found use on almost every American railroad. Some railroads copied these also, examples being found on the old [[St. Louis–San Francisco Railway]] and [[Illinois Central]].

The [[Southern Railway (U.S.)|Southern Railway]] made three-chime train whistles. These were all distinctive, having top-mounted levers. They had short-bell three-chimes as well as their (highly copied) long-bell three-chimes on passenger engines, especially their PS4 engines, one of which resides today at the [[Smithsonian Institution]].

Two-note and four-note train whistles never caught on with North American railroads, with one exception: [[Canadian National Railway]] created a large four-chime step-top whistle for limited use on some of their locomotives. These were not common and only a few survive today in the hands of collectors. Otherwise, North American train whistles were of the single-note, three-note, five-note and six-note varieties.

These are a few American railroads with whistles valued by collectors:
* [[Southern Pacific]]&amp;nbsp;– six-chimes
* [[Union Pacific]]&amp;nbsp;– Hancock "steamboat" three-chimes
* [[Reading Railroad]]&amp;nbsp;– high-pitched passenger six-chimes and 'hooter' freight whistles
* [[Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad]]&amp;nbsp;– five-chimes and three-chimes
* [[Baltimore and Ohio]]&amp;nbsp;– three-chime step-tops and six-chimes
* [[Grand Trunk Western Railroad]]&amp;nbsp;– shop-made six-chimes (Nathan copies)
* [[New York Central]]&amp;nbsp;– shop-made six-chimes
* [[Norfolk and Western]]&amp;nbsp;– low pitched, distinctive sounding 'hooter' whistles and three-chime hancocks
* [[Pennsylvania Railroad]]&amp;nbsp;- medium-pitched three-chimes and high-pitched 'Banshees'

==UK usage==

In the United Kingdom, it is normal for diesel and electric multiple-units and locomotives to have two horns, of different pitches (rather like two-tone emergency road vehicles—police cars, etc.).  This has given rise to drivers "playing" unofficial combinations of low and high notes.  When passing through the local station in the Yorkshire town of [[Ilkley]], drivers soon began to play the first line of the chorus of the folk song, "[[On Ilkla Moor Baht 'at]]" on their horns, using a series of short blasts: low, h-i-g-h high high, low, high, until the practice was stopped by authorities.

The first four notes of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony—played during World War II as the [[Morse code]] ''V'' (for Victory)—can be sounded on a train horn as three short notes and a longer one, often the last note on the lower-tone horn.

Early railways, before continuous brakes, had the communication chain or cord from the carriages connected to a "brake whistle" on the engine.  This was usually of a lower note than the normal whistle used by the driver.

[[File:Lydham Manor 7827 Didcot (Whistles).jpg|thumb|GWR twin whistles, seen on [[GWR 7800 Class 7827 Lydham Manor|7827 ''Lydham Manor'']]]]
Engines of Britain's [[Great Western Railway]] carried two whistles, one low- and one high-pitched. The high-pitched whistle was for warning of the trains approach and for giving shunting signals. The low-pitched whistle was for sending braking instructions to the crew on the train before the advent of [[railway_brake#Continuous_brakes|continuous brakes]] and was retained for the same purpose for goods operations. Some whistle-signals required use of both whistles. Some Great Western "[[GWR Autocoach|autocoaches]]"—from where the driver operated the steam engine's regulator and brakes, when the engine was propelling one or more autocoaches—still had a whistle connection with the engine's brake whistle, although a gong (much like a tram gong) was fitted at the front of each autocoach and was operated by the driver using a foot treadle.

Back in the days of steam, when [[assisting engine]]s pushed long goods trains up steep gradients (or "banks"), the train would come to a halt at the bottom of the bank. The assisting engine—or "[[bank engine|banker]]"—would either be attached to the rear of the train, or just come up against the guard's brake van's buffers. Then the banker's driver would whistle—using a series of long blasts and shorts.  This told both the signalman and the driver of the train engine that he was ready.  The train engine's driver would reply in similar fashion and, with signals at clear, they would set off in unison.  If the banker was coupled to the train, when it reached the top of the bank, the train would stop or come to a crawl for the banker to be uncoupled; if not, the banker's driver would just ease off the regulator, allowing the train to continue on its way, with, of course, a whistled "goodbye".

==Noise complaints from train whistles==

It is not uncommon for the sound of a train's whistle to propagate for miles; yet vehicle operators still have a difficult time hearing the warning signal due to the vehicle's [[soundproofing]] and ambient noise within the cab (such as engine, road, radio, and conversation noises).

The need to blare a train's whistle loudly to be heard by the driver of a vehicle approaching a [[grade crossing]] has become a major disadvantage to the use of train whistles as a safety device and has caused much controversy among those living within earshot of the train's whistle. It has been documented that a train's whistle, when operating on [[compressed air]], driving an [[Horn loudspeaker#Exponential|exponential horn]], has been measured at a higher [[decibel]] levels within the homes of nearby residents than within the cab of a vehicle sitting at the grade crossing.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|title=Federal Railroad Administration [Docket No. FRA 1999–6439, Notice No. 18]|publisher=Federal Railroad Administration|url=http://safetydata.fra.dot.gov/OfficeofSafety/Default.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given the tonal design of the train whistle, the sound level, how often trains pass through a given community, the number of grade crossings in proximity, and the time of day (night) of occurrence, community residents residing near crossing sometimes feel that train whistles have a serious detrimental effect on the [[quality of life]] despite the gain in safety that sounding the horn provides to motorists and pedestrians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=96471&amp;page=1|title=Ill.

A grade-crossing that had two accidents during the comparison years, when contrasted with only one accident during the control period, would statistically yield a high percentage-wise improvement in safety, when in reality, it was the difference in only one accident for that grade-crossing.

Conversely, there are those who do not object to the train whistle, as they believe it provides an important safety feature.&lt;ref&gt;There were over 3000 wide ranging public comments regarding quiet zone rule.  70 FR 21844, [https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2005/04/27/05-8285/use-of-locomotive-horns-at-highway-rail-grade-crossings]&lt;/ref&gt;  Some people even like the sound of the whistle, as it calls to mind a nostalgic era, as with the riverboats and their steam whistles and [[calliope (music)|calliopes]].  However, no real studies have been performed by unbiased official entities to measure the real effects such noise has on a community.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.snponline.com/articles/2009/09/23/multiple_papers/news/allducounc_20090923_1028am_6.txt{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bendbulletin.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090908/NEWS0107/909080387/1001/NEWS01&amp;nav_category=NEWS01 |title=Seeking silent nights &amp;#124; Local/State &amp;#124; The Bulletin |publisher=Bendbulletin.com |date=2009-09-08 |accessdate=2009-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=ColbyRobertson |url=http://www.myfoxwausau.com/dpp/news/wausau/Whistle_Ban1031 |title=Whistle Ban |publisher=Myfoxwausau.com |date= |accessdate=2009-11-03 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bclocalnews.com/opinion/letters/60709442.html |title=CP local employees making efforts |publisher=BCLocalNews.com |date=2009-09-23 |accessdate=2009-11-03 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Michael Gilbert |url=http://www.opprairie.com/Articles-c-2009-09-22-199938.112113_Quiet_zone_gains_steam.html |title=Quiet zone gains steam |publisher=Opprairie.com |date=2009-09-22 |accessdate=2009-11-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120725144240/http://www.opprairie.com/Articles-c-2009-09-22-199938.112113_Quiet_zone_gains_steam.html |archivedate=2012-07-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessnorth.com/kuws.asp?RID=3063 |title=News From 91.3 KUWS |publisher=Businessnorth.com |date= |accessdate=2009-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Frankfort Station Staff |url=http://www.frankfortstation.com/Articles-c-2009-09-21-199887.112113_Frankfort_Hosts_Quiet_Zone_Open_House.html |title=Frankfort Hosts Quiet Zone Open House |publisher=Frankfortstation.com |date=2009-09-21 |accessdate=2009-11-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120725142611/http://www.frankfortstation.com/Articles-c-2009-09-21-199887.112113_Frankfort_Hosts_Quiet_Zone_Open_House.html |archivedate=2012-07-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sanclementetimes.com/index.php?mact=News,cntnt01,detail,0&amp;cntnt01articleid=1897&amp;cntnt01dateformat=%25B%20%25d%2C%20%25Y&amp;cntnt01returnid=99 |title=Local News You Can Use |publisher=San Clemente Times |date= |accessdate=2009-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quiet zones are created in municipalities where citizens of the community complain of the noise pollution from the increasing amount of trains which decreases their quality of life.    In order to be approved for quiet zones, extensive safety and traffic studies must be conducted.  Municipalities and the owners of the tracks must work together to ensure all federal regulations are being met.  Quiet zones require improvements which would include installing standard or conventional automatic warning devices such as gates with lights if not already installed Medians must be installed at the railroad crossings to ensure vehicles do not proceed into the opposite lane to go around the gates (4). Once all safety measures are completed train whistles will be silenced at the railroad crossings. Quiet zones silencing train whistles reduces noise pollution but also creates safer railroad crossings wherein the whole community benefits, not just those that live near the tracks.

==Illustrating the Doppler effect==
The example of the change in frequency in the whistle of a passing train is often used to explain the phenomena of the [[Doppler effect]]. It became a common classroom example after the introduction of trains, since at the time they were one of the few objects that moved quickly while sounding a relatively constant note.

==Whistle code==
Train whistles are used to communicate with other railroad workers on a train or in the yard. Different combinations of long and short whistles each have their own meaning. They are used to pass instructions, as a safety signal, and to warn of impending movements of a train. Despite the advent of modern radio communication, many of these whistle signals are still used today. (See also [[Train horn#Common horn signals|Train horn (Common horn signals)]].)

Signals illustrated below are for North American railroads, "'''o'''" for short sounds, and "'''–'''" for longer sounds.

===Other whistle codes===
Not all railroads use exactly the same whistle signals or assign the same meanings. Some railroads will use their own variations of the above. A few of the signals are obsolete because the workers they were used to communicate with (such as flagman) are now obsolete.

In [[Norway]], for example, the following whistle signals are used:

*'''''One short''''': Stand by or general acknowledgment.
*'''''Two short''''': Apply/increase manual brakes.
*'''''Three short''''': Apply manual brakes to stop the train as soon as possible.
*'''''One long''''': Approaching railroad station or blind curve.
*'''''One long, one short''''': Decrease manual brakes. When repeated, decrease brakes fully.
*'''''One long, two short''''': Prepared for change of tracks, crossing and/or other situations that necessitates a gentle approach.
*'''''Multiple short''''': Danger.

In [[Finland]], the following are some of the signals used:

*'''''One short''''': Engine is starting forward.
*'''''Two short''''': Engine about to run backwards.
*'''''One long, one short''''': Warning, used before arriving to a crossing.
*'''''Three long''''': Danger.

'''Yellowstone-Teton Clean Energy Coalition's''' (YTCEC) mission is to displace the use of [[petroleum]] in the regional transportation sector, improve air quality through reduced harmful exhaust emissions, and increase energy security and [[sustainability]]. This is accomplished primarily through the promotion of [[alternative fuels]] and vehicles, integrated transportation systems, and energy conservation strategies and technologies that benefit the public interest by reducing energy consumption, particularly of petroleum based fuels.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ytcleanenergy.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

As the sole regional designee of the [[United States Department of Energy|U.S. Department of Energy's]] [[Clean Cities]] program, Yellowstone-Teton Clean Energy Coalition (YTCEC) functions as Department of Energy's on-the-ground advocate focused on petroleum displacement activities in the Greater Yellowstone Region. Currently consisting of nearly 90 organizations across the country, the Clean Cities program has been responsible for displacing over {{convert|2.5|e9USgal|m3}} of petroleum fuel since its inception.&lt;ref&gt;http://www1.eere.energy.gov/cleancities/mission.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Affiliation with the Clean Cities Program provides YTCEC with access to regional and national support networks in order to bring a much broader perspective to local transportation projects. It also allows for access to unique funding opportunities related to supporting the Clean Cities mission. This affiliation, along with YTCEC's regional standing as a resource and advocate for sustainable and efficient transportation, creates an ideal scenario for YTCEC to function as a clean transportation leader within the Greater Yellowstone Community in order to lessen the detrimental impacts of local transportation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ytcleanenergy.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Yellowstone-Teton Clean Energy Coalition was created in a ceremony at [[Old Faithful]] in September, 2002 becoming one of some 90 coalitions around the USA designated by the Department of Energy to address the U.S.' dependence on imported crude oil and help find solutions to the nation's energy challenges. [[Yellowstone National Park]] serves as the coalition's cornerstone and highest profile stakeholder in collaboration with gateway communities, other parks and agencies and the private sector. One of the few truly rural Clean Cities programs, the Yellowstone-Teton Clean Energy Coalition encompasses southwest [[Montana]], eastern [[Idaho]] and western [[Wyoming]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ytcleanenergy.org/about.php&lt;/ref&gt;

The Clean Energy Coalition is a [[non-profit]] corporation with a board of 12 directors and administered by a coordinator. More than 100 "stakeholders" participate in Clean Energy Coalition events ranging from email information sharing to periodic meetings and special events.

The Clean Cities program grew out of [[United States Department of Energy|U.S. Department of Energy]] initiatives in response to Congress passing the 1992 [[Energy Policy Act of 1992|Energy Policy Act]] signed by then-President [[George H. W. Bush|George H.W. Bush]]. One of the Act's goals is to reduce the amount of petroleum used by the transportation sector by promoting the use of alternative fuels and technologies such as [[ethanol]], [[biodiesel]], [[natural gas]], [[propane]] and [[hybrid electric vehicles]] (HEVs). The Act mandated that a portion of all vehicles purchased for state and federal government use be [[Alternative fuel vehicles|Alternative Fuel Vehicles]] (AFVs), capable of burning one or more of the alternative fuels as well as [[gasoline]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www1.eere.energy.gov/cleancities/mission.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Greater Yellowstone Area (GYA) ==

One of the few truly rural Clean Cities Coalitions, Yellowstone-Teton Clean Energy Coalition encompasses areas of western Wyoming, southwestern Montana, and Eastern Idaho known as the [[Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem]]. The GYA encompasses more than {{convert|10|e6acre|km2}} and is the last intact, temperate ecosystem in the world. This ecosystem consists of two [[national park]]s (Yellowstone and [[Grand Teton National Park|Grand Teton]]), six [[United States National Forest|National Forests]] (Targhee, Custer, Shoshone, Gallatin, Bridger/Teton, Deerlodge) and two [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service|U.S. Fish and Wildlife]] sites ([[National Elk Refuge]], Red Lakes).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ytcleanenergy.org/gyarea.php&lt;/ref&gt;

This very diverse region boasts {{convert|13000|ft|m|abbr=on}} alpine peaks, the largest high elevation lake in North America, mountain deserts, the highest concentration of geo-thermal features in the world, and is home to the complete array of animal species that were present in pre-historic times. Additionally, there are permittees that operate three major ski resorts, a commercial airport, large concessioner operations, and dozens of tour guides and outfitters that provide visitor services. Collectively, the area accommodates over seven million visitors annually. Grand Teton and Yellowstone National Parks are Mandatory Class 1 Areas, as defined by the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|1977 Clean Air Act]]. These areas are subject to anti-degradation practices to maintain their status and protect them from impairment created by manmade air pollution. Notably, the GYA achieved a Clean Cities designation in 2002 as the Yellowstone-Teton Clean Energy Coalition, the only ecosystem to receive such recognition.

Any well-marketed deployment of alternative fuels/advanced vehicle technologies in this region will receive extensive public exposure to the millions of annual visitors, residents, and business owners in the various 'gateway' cities adjacent to the parks. Tremendous potential exists for collaboration across the region to deploy a variety of alternative fuels and advanced technologies. These will decrease regional consumption of petroleum, improve air quality, create a stronger, more diverse energy portfolio for the region, while setting an example for the nation. The opportunity to successfully display these technologies in use in Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks will serve to further promote their use in the surrounding communities of Cody, Jackson, Dubois, West Yellowstone, Gardiner, Bozeman, Livingston, and beyond.
