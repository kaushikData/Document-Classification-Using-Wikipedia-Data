The '''Abaza language''' (абаза бызшва, ''abaza byzšwa''; {{lang-ady|абазэбзэ}}) is a [[Northwest Caucasian languages|Northwest Caucasian language]] in [[Russia]] and many of the exiled communities in Turkey. In fact the language has gone through several different orthographies based primarily on Arabic, Roman, and Cyrillic letters. The syntax and phonology are rather unique{{what?|date=September 2018}} as its consonant to vowel ratio is remarkably high; making it quite similar to many other languages from the same parent chain. The language evolved during its popularity in the mid to late 1800s and eventually started to die out.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-968X.1956.tb00566.x/epdfr3_referer=wol&amp;tracking_action=preview_click&amp;show_checkout=1&amp;purchase_referrer=www.google.com&amp;purchase_site_license=LICENSE_DENIED_NO_CUSTOMER|title=The Structure and System in the Abaza Verbal  Complex|work=Abaza Language Structure|access-date=2017-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abaza is spoken by approximately 35,000 people in Russia, where it is written in a [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic alphabet]], as well as another 10,000 in [[Turkey]], where the [[Latin script]] is used.
It consists of two dialects, the Ashkherewa dialect and the T'ap'anta dialect, which is the literary standard. The language also consists of five sub dialects known as Psyzh-Krasnovostok, Abazakt, Apsua, Kubin-Elburgan and Kuvin.&lt;ref name="red book"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eki.ee/books/redbook/abazians.shtml|title=The Red Book of the Peoples of the Russian Empire|website=www.eki.ee|access-date=2017-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abaza, like its relatives in the family of [[Northwest Caucasian languages]], is a highly [[agglutinative language]]. For example, the verb in the English sentence "He couldn't make them give it back to her" contains four arguments (a term used in [[Valency (linguistics)|valency grammar]]): ''he'', ''them'', ''it'', ''to her''. Abaza marks arguments morphologically, and incorporates all four arguments as [[Pronoun|pronominal]] [[prefix]]es on the verb.&lt;ref&gt;Dixon, R.M.W. (2000). "A Typology of Causatives: Form, Syntax, and Meaning". In Dixon, R.M.W. &amp; Aikhenvald, Alexendra Y. ''Changing Valency: Case Studies in Transitivity''. Cambridge University Press. p 57&lt;/ref&gt; The Abaza language contains two dialects in accordance to the Tapanta and Shkaraua familial districts. The subdialects include Abazakt, Apsua, Kubin-Elburgan, Kuvin and Psyzh-Krasnovostok.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.endangeredlanguages.com/lang/1415|title=Did you know Abaza is vulnerable?|website=Endangered Languages|language=en|access-date=2017-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has a large consonantal inventory (63 phonemes) coupled with a minimal vowel inventory (two vowels). It is very closely related to [[Abkhaz language|Abkhaz]],&lt;ref name=EB&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor-first=Dale H. |editor-last=Hoiberg|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |title=Abkhaz|edition = 15th |year=2010|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Inc. |volume=I: A-ak Bayes |location=Chicago, Illinois |isbn=978-1-59339-837-8|pages=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it preserves a few phonemes which Abkhaz lacks, such as a [[voiced pharyngeal fricative]]. Work on Abaza has been carried out by W. S. Allen, Brian O'Herin, and [[John Colarusso]].

== History ==
The Abaza language has slowly died out. Different forms of cultural annihilation contributed to its fall, in areas of Russia, and over time its overall endangerment. The language can be broken into 5 different dialects and has several unique grammatical approaches to languages. The Abaza Language was at its peak usage in the mid to late 1800s. 

Abaza speakers along the Greater and Lesser Laba, Urup, and Greater and Lesser Zelenchuk rivers are from a wave of migrants in the 17th to 18th centuries who represent the Abaza speakers of today. The end of the Great Caucasian War in 1864 provided Russia with power and control of the local regions and contributed to the decrease in the popularity of pre-existing local languages prior to the war.

== Geographic distribution ==
The Abaza language is spoken in Russia and Turkey. Although it is endangered, it is still spoken in several regions across in Russia. These include Kara-Pago, Kubina, Psikh, El'burgan, Inzhich-Chukun, Koi-dan, Abaza-Khabl', Malo-Abazinka, Tapanta, Krasnovostochni, Novokuvinski, Starokuvinski, Abazakt and Ap-sua.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://joshuaproject.net/people_groups/10125/RS|title=Abaza in Russia|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grammar==

For most mainstream languages{{what?|date=September 2018}} the main clause is typically in the final part of the language. In the case of the Abaza language, it is the first clause that is there. Furthermore, within the clause the verbal complex is final. In the verbal structure for the usage of multiple pronouns certain pronouns are treated as nominal forms that a place makers. The existence of only two vowels makes it so that the main stressed syllables are highly important in differentiating verbiage. {{Cite web|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-968X.1956.tb00566.x/epdf?r3_referer=wol&amp;tracking_action=preview_click&amp;show_checkout=1&amp;purchase_referrer=www.google.com&amp;purchase_site_license=LICENSE_DENIED_NO_CUSTOMER|title=Phonology Manual|}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7316">In [[rhetoric]], '''anthimeria''', traditionally and more properly called '''antimeria''' (from the {{lang-el|ἀντί}}, ''antí'', "against, opposite" and μέρος, ''méros'', "part"), involves using one part of speech as another part of speech, such as using a noun as if it were a verb: "The little old lady turtled along the road." Using a noun as a verb has become so common that many nouns have also become verbs. For example, the noun "book" is now often used as a verb, as in the example "Let's book the flight". Other noun-as-verb usages include "I can keyboard that for you," "We need to scissor expenses," and "Desk him." Other substitutions could include an adjective used as a noun, as in "She dove into the foaming wet," interjection as verb, as in "Don't aha me!" a verb as a noun, as in "Help! I need some eat!" and so on.&lt;ref&gt;Corbett, Edward P. J. ''Classical Rhetoric for the Modern Student''.

There are a number of examples throughout the English language that demonstrate the evolution of specific words from one [[Part of speech|lexical category]] to another. For example, the word 'chill' originated as a noun that could be substituted as a synonym for 'cold'. Throughout the years, 'chill' grew to transition into a verb ('to chill vegetables') and then, subsequently, an adjective ('a chilly morning'). Most recently, 'chill' has yet again transformed into another part of speech, an "intransitive verb, meaning roughly 'to relax',"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Yagoda|first=Ben|title=Language: The moving parts of speech|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/09/opinion/09iht-edsafire.2150850.html|accessdate=23 October 2013|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; as author Ben Yagoda explains. Yagoda then quotes what he determines to be the starting point of this lexical shift through referencing the lyrics of [[The Sugarhill Gang]]'s 1979 hit '[[Rapper's Delight]]': "There's... a time to break and a time to chill/ To act civilized or act real ill".

===Slash===
A more unusual case of anthimeria is displayed not through a change in lexical category but a change in form altogether. The punctuation mark '[[Slash (punctuation)|/]]' was originally implemented to juxtapose two similarly related words or phrases, such as a 'friend/roommate', meaning that the referred person is both a friend and roommate to the speaker. However, younger generations have come to morph the symbol '/' into the written and spoken word of 'slash'. [[Anne Curzan]], a professor of English at the [[University of Michigan]], notes that the "emergence of a new conjunction/conjunctive adverb (let alone one stemming from a punctuation mark) is like a rare-bird sighting in the world of linguistics: an innovation in the slang of young people embedding itself as a function word in the language".&lt;ref name=slash&gt;{{cite web|last=Curzan|first=Anne|title=Slash: Not Just a Punctuation Mark Anymore|url=http://chronicle.com/blogs/linguafranca/2013/04/24/slash-not-just-a-punctuation-mark-anymore/|publisher=The Chronicle of Higher Education|accessdate=23 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The form change from symbol to word also brought about a change in usage, as the situational context of '/' was completely modified to conform to the needs of this new word. The usage of 'slash', according to Curzan, has multiple contextual uses, including the "distinguishing between (a) the activity that the speaker or writer was intending to do or should have been doing, and (b) the activity that the speaker or writer actually did or anticipated they would do...".&lt;ref name=slash /&gt; Curzan also finds that 'slash' has been used to "link a second related thought or clause to the first" as well as simply "introduc[ing] an afterthought that is also a topic shift".&lt;ref name=slash /&gt; Dispersed throughout her blog post entitled "[http://chronicle.com/blogs/linguafranca/2013/04/24/slash-not-just-a-punctuation-mark-anymore/ Slash: Not Just a Punctuation Mark Anymore]", Curzan has compiled a list of the numerous cases in which 'slash' can be employed, a set of data that she obtained through contributions from students in her undergraduate history of English course. A few examples include:

*"I went to class slash caught up on [[Game of Thrones]]."
*"Does anyone care if my cousin comes and visit slash stays with us Friday night?"
*"Has anyone seen my moccasins anywhere? Slash were they given to someone to wear home ever?"

==Temporary and permanent usage==
When classifying anthimeria, it is important to determine the difference between words that are popular for the time being as opposed to words that have become permanent fixtures in the English language. As noted above, the use of 'chill' has become a common occurrence in standard English, and the still-transitioning use of 'slash' seems to be well on its way to becoming a permanent conjunction. While still in the transformation stage of usage though, the majority of newly created words are revealed to be only fads, developed to serve a purpose only while the trend runs it course.

Helen Sword, a professor at the [[University of Auckland]], provides an example in the verb ''Eastwood'', a craze that swept the nation following [[Clint Eastwood at the 2012 Republican National Convention|Clint Eastwood's speech at the 2012 Republican National Convention]]. "Within weeks, the fad for ''Eastwooding'' – talking to an empty chair – had already petered out".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sword|first=Helen|title=Mutant Verbs|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/27/mutant-verbs/|accessdate=23 October 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although relevant to the current time period, the distinction between temporary and permanent "[[Conversion (word formation)|verbifications]]" and their equivalents is necessary in noting the evolution of the English language.

==Biography==
Arto Paasilinna&lt;ref name=pron&gt;{{IPA-fi|ˈɑr.to ˈpɑː.si.ˈlin.nɑ}}, approximately "AR-toh PAAH-sea-LEAN-nah".&lt;/ref&gt; was born on 20 April 1942 in the [[Alakylä]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}&lt;!--(even his Finnish bio doesn't mention "Alakylä" ; http://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kittilä mentions Alakylä in a list of "Kylät", boroughs/villages)--&gt; part of the municipality of [[Kittilä]], in [[Lapland, Finland]]. His parents were Väinö Paasilinna (1902–1950, born Gullstén, changed his surname in 1934 after a family conflict) and Hilda-Maria Paasilinna (1908–1983, born Niva).&lt;ref name=kuusela/&gt; The Paasilinnas had seven children, five sons and two daughters, including the writer [[Erno Paasilinna]]; the author, [[Member of European Parliament|MEP]] and TV personality [[Reino Paasilinna]]; the painter [[Sirpa Paasilinna-Schlagenwarth]]; and the writer [[Mauri Paasilinna]].&lt;ref name=kuusela&gt;Kuusela 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Paasilinna studied at the General and Elementary School Line at the Lapland Folk Academy.&lt;ref name=mfw-bio&gt;MFW 2008, Biography.&lt;/ref&gt; He initially worked as a journalist at ''Nuoren Voiman Liitto'', ''Nuori Voima-lehti'' and various newspapers as writer and editor.&lt;ref name=kuusela/&gt; At the weekly magazine ''[[Apu (magazine)|Apu]]'', he was an editor (1968–1970) and later a columnist (1975–1988).&lt;ref&gt;From [[:fi:Apu (lehti)]] and its translation at [[Apu (magazine)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, at the age of 33, Paasilinna found journalism growing "more superficial and meaningless" and desired a change;&lt;ref name="Polojärvi"&gt;Polojärvi 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; that summer, he sold his boat to fund the writing of ''[[The Year of the Hare (novel)|The Year of the Hare]]''.&lt;ref name="Polojärvi" /&gt; The book was an immediate success and from 1975 on Paasilinna became an independent writer&lt;ref name=kuusela/&gt;&lt;ref name=mfw-bio/&gt; able to support himself with his novels, signed to Finnish publisher [[SanomaWSOY|WSOY]] since 1977.&lt;ref name=kuusela/&gt; He still wrote journalism articles and was a columnist on Finnish radio.&lt;ref name="Polojärvi" /&gt;

In 2002, for Paasilinna's 60th anniversary, journalist Eino Leino published a biography of Paasilinna called ''Lentojätkä.

In 2008 and 2009 while still living in [[Espoo]], Paasilinna was featured in Finnish tabloids for his incoherent behaviour, including [[reckless driving]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iltasanomat.fi/uutiset/kotimaa/uutinen.asp?id=1558746|title=Arto Paasilinna kolaroi rajusti - ajoi moottoritietä väärään suuntaan|date=2008-07-19|work=Ilta-Sanomat|publisher=WSOY|language=Finnish|accessdate=27 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kaleva.fi/plus/juttu786214_page0.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120723192553/http://www.kaleva.fi/plus/juttu786214_page0.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-23 |title=Kirjailija Arto Paasilinna sai isot sakot kolaroinnistaan |date=2009-03-13 |publisher=Kaleva |language=Finnish |accessdate=27 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2009 he was rushed to a hospital due to a [[stroke]].

{{As of|2009}}, Paasilinna had published about 12 non-fiction books and 35 novels, with almost one novel each year from 1972 to 2009 (except 1973, 1978, 2002): as his publishers say, "The annual Paasilinna is as much an element of the Finnish autumn as falling birch leaves."&lt;ref name="tif"/&gt; He is "constantly being translated into new languages",&lt;ref name=fili&gt;FILI 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and 18&lt;ref name=wsoy&gt;WSOY 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; of his books have been translated overall into at least 27&lt;ref name=wsoy-lang&gt;WSOY 2009: Paasilinna is translated in 27 languages, being Albanian, Catalan, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Ersän, Estonian, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Icelandic, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Latvian, Lithuan, Mokshan, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Slovenian, Spanish, Swedish.&lt;/ref&gt; languages: the translations beyond neighboring Scandinavian countries include: 17 into Italian,&lt;ref&gt;[[:it:Arto Paasilinna]]&lt;/ref&gt; 16 into German,&lt;ref name="de.wikipedia.org"&gt;[[:de:Arto Paasilinna]]&lt;/ref&gt; 11 into French,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gallimard.fr/Gallimard-cgi/Appli_catal/fs_auteur.pl?nuauteur=12039&amp;fctx=1232479827&amp;tri=ta Available in the Folio paperback series] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720231314/http://www.gallimard.fr/Gallimard-cgi/Appli_catal/fs_auteur.pl?nuauteur=12039&amp;fctx=1232479827&amp;tri=ta |date=July 20, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 9 into Slovenian,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bukla.si/?action=landscape&amp;cat_id=7&amp;author_id=549]&lt;/ref&gt; 6 into Dutch,&lt;ref name="de.wikipedia.org" /&gt; 5 into Spanish,&lt;ref&gt;[[:es:Arto Paasilinna]]&lt;/ref&gt; 4 into Korean,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=au%3AArto+Paasilinna+ln%3Akor&amp;fq=&amp;se=ts&amp;sd=asc&amp;qt=sort_ts_asc Arto Paasilinna in Korean] at [[WorldCat]].&lt;/ref&gt; and 2 into English, Ukrainian&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calvaria.org/autor.php?aid%3D44 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725025044/http://www.calvaria.org/autor.php?aid=44 |archivedate=2011-07-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Catalan. Described as "The brightest star in the Finnish translated-literature firmament"&lt;ref name="Petäjä"&gt;Petäjä 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; by Finnish newspaper ''[[Helsingin Sanomat]]'', his success is claimed as having been "instrumental in generating the current level of interest in books from Finland"&lt;ref name="Petäjä" /&gt; by his publisher WSOY.

Paasilinna's books reflect quite common Finnish life, usually from a [[middle age|middle-aged]] male perspective, and in rural Finland.&lt;ref name=binder2002&gt;Binder 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Fast-paced, light and humorous in style, many of these narratives can be described as [[picaresque]]&lt;ref name=binder2002/&gt; adventure stories with often a satirical angle towards modern life. Certain of his stories have been described as modern fables,&lt;ref&gt;*For ''Year of the Hare'', from ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'': "A man abandons his conventional life and hits the road with a hare in this '''offbeat picaresque fable'''." 1996 [https://www.amazon.com/Year-Unesco-Collection-Representative-Works/dp/0720610176]
*For ''The Howling Miller'' "It is also '''a fable''' about the eternal struggle between freedom and repressive authority."[http://www.waterstones.com/waterstonesweb/displayProductDetails.do?sku=5864487]&lt;/ref&gt; such as ''The Year of the Hare'', which sets an ex-journalist's quest for authentic life and values in the Finnish backwoods against the emptiness and meaninglessness of modern consumer society. Vatanen, the hero of this novel, takes an injured young hare with him on his quest, nursing the animal back to health, while his own dissatisfaction with his former urban lifestyle becomes ever more evident.

His 1974 novel ''Paratiisisaaren Vangit'' appears as ''Prisonniers du Paradis''. This book is the humorous story of a UN charter that crashes on a deserted Pacific island. The passengers are lumberjacks and other forestry workers, midwives and nurses. As with ''The Year of the Hare'' (in French, ''Le lièvre de Vatanen''), the narrator is a journalist. The multinational castaways (Finnish, Swedish, Norwegian and English) give Paasilinna ample opportunity to poke fun at issues of language domination and national stereotypes. The castaways set up a [[cashless society]] in which the only remuneration comes in the form of a cup of alcohol distilled in their jungle café in exchange for work for the collectivity. There is also a family planning clinic offering free [[intrauterine device|IUDs]]. Soon, they find that they are not alone on the island and come up with a plan to get help.

Two of his novels, ''Lentävä kirvesmies'' and ''Rovasti Huuskosen petomainen miespalvelija'' were adapted to [[graphic novel]]s by [[Hannu Lukkarinen]].

'''Basal readers''' are [[textbooks]] used to teach [[reading (process)|reading]] and associated skills to schoolchildren.  Commonly called "reading books" or "readers" they are usually published as [[Anthology|anthologies]] that combine previously published [[short stories]], excerpts of longer narratives, and original works.  A standard basal series comes with individual identical books for students, a ''Teacher's Edition'' of the book, and a collection of workbooks, assessments, and activities.

==Description==
Basal readers are typically organized. Stories are chosen to illustrate and develop specific skills, which are taught in a pre-determined sequence. The teacher's editions are also tightly organized, containing much more than the answer key to the questions that usually appear at the end of each reading passage. The teacher's book also contains suggestions for pre-reading and post-reading activities and assessments, as well as scripted questions to ask students at specific points in a story.

==History==

{{globalize|date=December 2010}}
Basal readers have been in use in the [[United States]] since the mid-1860s, beginning with a series called the [[McGuffey Readers]].  This was the first reader published with the idea of having one text for each grade level.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}  Since then, teaching methodologies in school basals have shifted regularly.  The [[Scott Foresman|Scott Foresman Company]] published what is perhaps the most famous basal series, whose stories starred two children named [[Dick and Jane]].  Dick and Jane books emphasized memorizing words on sight, a method which came to be known as "look and say."  This philosophy came under attack in the late 1950s, largely due to Rudolf Flesch's book ''[[Why Johnny Can't Read]]''.  This was a scathing condemnation of the "look say" method, and advocated a return to programs that stressed teaching [[phonics]] to beginning readers.

During the 1970s and early 1980s, the pendulum did swing back toward a more phonics-based approach.  During the latter part of the 1980s, basal usage declined as reading programs began to turn to [[whole language]] programs that relied more heavily on trade books, rather than textbooks.  The 1990s and early years of the 21st century have seen a renewed interest in skills acquisition which has sparked a resurgence in basal dominance.

==Benefits==
The highly planned nature of basal readers is seen as one of their strengths, as this eases the load on teachers, particularly those who are inexperienced.  Specific skills can be easily targeted, tested, and remediated.  Those with very [[controlled vocabulary]] usage may ease difficulties for beginner or weak readers.  Students who are reading below grade level will receive some benefits from using the on-level basal. The exposure will prepare them for state testing. Using a basal reader as a starting point for grade level reading allows educators to quickly assess student reading level.  Basals are not meant to be the only resource a student uses, just the starting point.

'''Bauwaki''' (Bawaki) is a [[Papuan language]] of New Guinea, sometimes classified as a member of the [[Mailuan languages|Mailuan]] family. It is 70% lexically similar to [[Abia language|Abia]] of the [[Yareban languages|Yareban]] family. Dutton (1971) proposed it to be a 'bridge' between the [[Mailuan languages|Mailuan]] and Yareban language families.&lt;ref name=e18 /&gt;  O'oku, either a dialect or a closely related language, is similarly lexically 60% Yareban.

The history of [[Bible translations]] into the [[Konkani language]] begins with Ignazio Arcamone (1615–1683), an Italian Jesuit working in Salcette, [[Goa]] was the first to translate parts of the Bible to [[Konkani language]].&lt;ref name="mangalorean.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mangalorean.com/news.php?newstype=local&amp;newsid=29346|title=Mangalorean.com - Mangalore News Articles, Classifieds to Around the World|publisher=Mangalorean.com|accessdate=7 December 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141209070936/http://www.mangalorean.com/news.php?newstype=local&amp;newsid=29346|archivedate=9 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was published under the title "Sogllea Vorunsache Vanjel" from Rachol Seminary Printing Press in 1667.

'''Budu Dogon''' or '''''Bunoge''''', also known as '''Korandabo''', is a recently discovered [[Dogon language]] spoken in [[Mali]]. It was first reported online.[https://web.archive.org/web/20130615111624/http://www.rogerblench.info/Language/Niger-Congo/Dogon/Dogon%20page.htm] The plural suffix on nouns is closest to [[Kolum so]], suggesting it should be classified as a West Dogon language.

The people call themselves ''Budu'', and [[Tommo so|Tɔmmɔ-sɔ]] speakers call the language ''Budu-sɔ''. It has also been called ''Budu-Tagu'', the name of the principal Budu village.

The [[labiodental flap]], {{IPA|/ⱱ/}} is marginal, only occurring in two native Buwal words. The labial-velar plosives are also marginal; in particular, {{IPA|/kp/}} only occurs in one word, the [[ideophone]] ''kpaŋ''.

Buwal has the vowels {{IPA|/ə a/}}, which can occur in high, middle, or low tone. Each vowel has a variety of phonetic realizations. {{IPA|/ə/}} can occur as {{IPA|[i u ɪ ʏ ʊ]}}, and {{IPA|/a/}} can occur as {{IPA|[e o ɛ œ ɐ ɔ]}}. The [[schwa]] can be analyzed as a solely [[epenthetic vowel]]. They occur as [[rounded vowel|rounded]] [[allophone]]s when adjacent to a labialized consonant, and as [[front vowel]]s when the word is palatalized.

[[Palatalization (sound change)|Palatalization]] in Buwal occurs across an entire word, and also affects the affricate consonants {{IPA|/ts dz ⁿdz/}}, which surface as {{IPA|[tʃ dʒ ⁿdʒ]}} in a palatalized word. As a result, all of the vowels within a single word are either front or back, producing [[vowel harmony]]. An example of this contrast is between {{IPA|[mɐ̄ⁿdʊ́wɐ́n]}} 'rat' (underlyingly {{IPA|/māⁿdwán/}}), which is non-palatalized, and {{IPA|[mɛ̀vɛ̄ɗvɛ̄ɗɛ̄ŋ]}} (underlyingly {{IPA|/màvāɗvāɗāŋ/}}) 'turtle', which is palatalized. This process does not affect loanwords, e.g. {{IPA|[nɛ̀bɐ̄m]}} 'oil' (from [[Fula language|Fulfulde]] ''nebbam'') or {{IPA|[lɛ̀kʷól]}} 'school' (from [[French language|French]] ''l'école''). Some loanwords have been modified to accommodate Buwal phonology, e.g. {{IPA|[sɐ́j]}} 'tea', from Fulfulde ''sha'i''.&lt;ref&gt;Melanie Helen Viljoen, A grammatical description of the Buwal language, La Trobe University, 2013, 739 p.

In [[telecommunication]]s, the '''capture effect''', or '''FM capture effect''', is a phenomenon associated with [[Frequency modulation|FM]] reception in which only the stronger of two signals at, or near, the same [[frequency]] or channel will be [[demodulation|demodulated]].  

The capture effect is defined as the complete suppression of the weaker signal at the [[receiver (radio)|receiver]] [[limiter]] (if it has one) where the weaker signal is not [[Amplifier|amplified]], but [[attenuate]]d.  When both signals are nearly equal in strength, or are [[fading]] independently, the receiver may [[switch]] from one to the other and exhibit [[picket fencing]].

The capture effect can occur at the signal limiter, or in the [[demodulation]] stage, for circuits that do not require a signal limiter.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} Some types of [[Detector (radio)|radio receiver circuits]] have a stronger capture effect than others.  The measurement of how well a receiver can reject a second signal on the same frequency is called the capture ratio for a specific receiver. It is measured as the lowest ratio of the power of two signals that will result in the suppression of the smaller signal. 

Amplitude modulation, or [[AM broadcasting|AM]] [[radio]], [[Transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] is not subject to this effect.  This is one reason that the [[Airband|aviation]] industry, and others, have chosen to use AM for communications rather than FM, allowing multiple signals [[Transmission (telecommunications)|transmitted]] on the same channel to be heard.  Phenomena similar to the capture effect are described in AM when offset carriers of different strengths are present in the passband of a receiver.  For example, the aviation [[glideslope]] vertical guidance clearance beam is sometimes described as a "capture effect" system, even though it operates using AM signals.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

== Amplitude modulation immunity to capture effect ==
In FM demodulation the receiver tracks the modulated frequency shift of the desired carrier while discriminating against any other signal since it can only follow the deviation of one signal at a time. In AM, the receiver tracks the signal strength of the AM signal as the  basis for demodulation. This allows any other signal to be tracked as just another change in amplitude. So it is possible for an AM receiver to demodulate several carriers at the same time, resulting in an audio mix.

If the signals are close but not exactly on the same frequency, the mix will not only include the audio from both carriers, but depending on the carrier separation an audible tone (a beat signal) may be heard at a frequency equal to the difference in the carrier frequencies involved. For instance, if one carrier is at 1000.000 kHz, and the other is at 1000.150 kHz, then a 150 Hz "beat frequency" tone will result.

This mix can also occur when a second AM carrier is received on a channel that is adjacent to the desired channel if the receiver's ultimate bandwidth is wide enough to include the carriers of both signals. In the US AM broadcast bands this occurs at 10 kHz, which is the US channel spacing for the AM broadcast band. Elsewhere it can occur at 9 kHz, a commonly used channel spacing in many locales.

Modern SDR-based receivers can completely eliminate this by utilizing "brick-wall" filters narrower than the channel spacing that reduce signals outside the passband to inconsequential levels. Where such an overlap within the passband occurs, a high pitched whistle at precisely 9 or 10 kHz can be heard. This is particularly common at night when other carriers from adjacent channels are traveling long distances due to atmospheric bounce.

Because AM assumes short term changes in the amplitude to be information, any electrical impulse will be picked up and demodulated along with the desired carrier. Hence lightning causes crashing noises when picked up by an AM radio near a storm. In contrast, FM suppresses short term changes in amplitude and is therefore much less prone to noise during storms and during reception of electrical noise impulses. 

For [[digital modulation]] schemes it has been shown that for properly implemented [[on-off keying]]/[[amplitude-shift keying]] systems, [[co-channel interference|co-channel]] [[electronic selectivity|rejection]] can be better than for [[frequency-shift keying]] systems.

'''Chuvash''' ({{IPAc-en|tʃ|ʊ|ˈ|v|ɑː|ʃ}}; {{lang|cv|Чӑвашла}}, {{lang|cv-Latn|Căvašla}}, {{lang|cv-Latn|Çovaşla}}; {{IPA-cv|tɕəʋaʂˈla|IPA}})&lt;ref&gt;also known as ''Chăvash'', ''Chuwash'', ''Chovash'', ''Chavash'', ''Çovaş'', ''Çuvaş'' or ''Çuwaş''&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Turkic language]] spoken in [[European Russia|European]] [[Russia]], primarily in the [[Chuvash Republic]] and adjacent areas. It is the only surviving member of the [[Oghur languages|Oghur]] branch of Turkic languages. Because of this, Chuvash has diverged considerably from [[Common Turkic languages|the other Turkic languages]], which typically demonstrate [[mutual intelligibility]] among one another to varying degrees.

The writing system for the Chuvash language is based on the [[Cyrillic script]], employing all of the letters used in the [[Russian alphabet]] and adding four letters of its own: [[Ӑ]], [[Ӗ]], [[Ҫ]] and [[Ӳ]].

A fairly significant production and publication of literature in Chuvash still continues. According to [[UNESCO]]'s ''Index Translationum'', at least 202 books translated from Chuvash were published in other languages (mostly Russian) since ca. 1979.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/xtrans/bsresult.aspx?a=&amp;stxt=&amp;sl=chv&amp;l=&amp;pla=&amp;pub=&amp;tr=&amp;e=&amp;udc=&amp;d=&amp;from=&amp;to=&amp;tie=a Index Translationum: translations from Chuvash] - shows 202 titles, as of 2013-01-06. The index has data since ca. 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; However, as with most other languages of the former USSR, most of the translation activity took place before the [[dissolution of the USSR]]: out of the 202 translations, 170 books were published in the USSR,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/xtrans/bsresult.aspx?a=&amp;stxt=&amp;sl=chv&amp;l=&amp;c=SUN&amp;pla=&amp;pub=&amp;tr=&amp;e=&amp;udc=&amp;d=&amp;from=&amp;to=&amp;tie=a Index Translationum: translations from Chuvash, published in the USSR] - shows 170 titles&lt;/ref&gt; and just 17, in the post-1991 Russia (mostly, in the 1990s).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/xtrans/bsresult.aspx?a=&amp;stxt=&amp;sl=chv&amp;l=&amp;c=RUS&amp;pla=&amp;pub=&amp;tr=&amp;e=&amp;udc=&amp;d=&amp;from=&amp;to=&amp;tie=a Index Translationum: translations from Chuvash, published in Russia] - shows 17 titles&lt;/ref&gt; A similar situation takes place with the translation of books from other languages (mostly Russian) into Chuvash (the total of 175 titles published since ca. 1979, but just 18 of them in post-1991 Russia).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/xtrans/bsresult.aspx?a=&amp;stxt=&amp;sl=&amp;l=chv&amp;c=&amp;pla=&amp;pub=&amp;tr=&amp;e=&amp;udc=&amp;d=&amp;from=&amp;to=&amp;tie=a Index Translationum: translations into Chuvash]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Chuvash is the most distinctive of the [[Turkic languages]] and cannot be understood by speakers of other Turkic tongues. Chuvash is classified, alongside the extinct language [[Bulgar language|Bulgar]], as the only remaining member of the [[Oghuric]] branch of the Turkic language family. Since the surviving literary records for the non-Chuvash members of Oghuric are scant, the exact position of Chuvash within the Oghuric family cannot be determined.

The Oghuric branch is distinguished from the rest of the Turkic family (the [[Common Turkic]] languages) by two [[sound change]]s: ''r'' corresponding to Common Turkic ''z'', and ''l'' corresponding to Common Turkic ''ş''.&lt;ref&gt;Johanson (1998); cf. Johanson (2000, 2007) and the articles pertaining to the subject in Johanson &amp; Csató (ed., 1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

Formerly, scholars considered Chuvash not properly a Turkic language at all but, rather, a [[Turkicisation|Turkicised]] [[Finno-Ugric languages|Finno-Ugric]] ([[Uralic languages|Uralic]]) language.&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; Already the first scientific fieldwork mission to record Chuvash, by [[August Ahlqvist]] in 1856, however established its correct affiliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Mikko|last=Korhonen|year=1986|title=Finno-Ugrian Language Studies in Finland 1828-1918|location=Helsinki|publisher=Societas Scientiarum Fennica|isbn=951-653-135-0|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1873–1938===
The modern Chuvash alphabet was devised in 1873 by school inspector [[Ivan Yakovlev (educator)|Ivan Yakovlevich Yakovlev]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1918/apr/20.htm |title=Telegram to the Chairman of the Simbirsk Soviet |accessdate=30 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="CTchar"
| а || е || ы || и/і || у || ӳ || ӑ || ӗ || й || в || к || л || [[El with middle hook|ԡ]] || м || н || [[En with middle hook|ԣ]] || п || р || р́ || с || ҫ || т ||  т̌ || [[ђ]] || х || ш
|}

In 1938, the alphabet underwent significant modification which brought it to its current form.

===Previous systems===
The most ancient writing system, known as the [[Old Turkic alphabet]], disappeared after the [[Volga Bulgaria|Volga Bulgars]] converted to Islam. Later, the [[Arabic script]] was adopted. After the [[Mongol invasion of Volga Bulgaria|Mongol invasion]], writing degraded. After [[Peter the Great]]'s reforms Chuvash elites disappeared, blacksmiths and some other crafts were prohibited for non-Russian nations, the Chuvash were educated in Russian, while writing in runes recurred with simple folks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nasledie.nbchr.ru/nasledie/yazyk/runicheskaja-pismennost |title=Древнечувашская руническая письменность |work=Трофимов А.А |publisher=Национальная библиотека Чувашской Республики}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nasledie.nbchr.ru/nasledie/yazyk/ |title=Язык – основа национальной культуры|work=Э. Алос-и-Фонт. |publisher=Национальная библиотека Чувашской Республики}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phonology==
===Consonants===
The consonants are the following (the corresponding Cyrillic letters are in brackets): The [[stop consonant|stop]]s, [[sibilant]]s and [[affricate]]s are [[voiceless]] and [[fortis and lenis|fortes]] but become [[fortis and lenis|lenes]] (sounding similar to [[voiced]]) in intervocalic position and after [[liquid consonant|liquid]]s, [[nasal stop|nasals]] and [[semi-vowel]]s. Аннепе sounds like ''annebe'', but кушакпа sounds like ''kuzhakpa''. However, [[geminate consonant]]s do not undergo this lenition. Furthermore, the voiced consonants occurring in [[Russian language|Russian]] are used in modern Russian-language loans. Consonants also become [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalized]] before and after [[front vowel]]s.

According to Krueger (1961), the Chuvash vowel system is as follows (the precise [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] symbols are chosen based on his description since he uses a different transcription).

The following table is based on his version, with additional information from Petrov (2001). Again, the IPA symbols are not directly taken from the works so they could be inaccurate.

The vowels ӑ and ӗ are described as [[reduced vowel|reduced]], thereby differing in [[vowel quantity|quantity]] from the rest. In unstressed positions, they often resemble a [[schwa]] or tend to be dropped altogether in fast speech. At times, especially when stressed, they may be somewhat rounded and sound similar to {{IPA|/o/}} and {{IPA|/ø/}}.

Additionally, {{IPA|ɔ}} (о) occurs in loanwords from Russian where the syllable is unstressed in Russian.

===Word accent===
The usual rule given in grammars of Chuvash is that the last full (non-reduced) vowel of the word is stressed; if there are no full vowels, the first vowel is stressed.&lt;ref&gt;Dobrovolsky (1999), p. 539.&lt;/ref&gt; Reduced vowels that precede or follow a stressed full vowel are extremely short and non-prominent. One scholar, Dobrovolsky, however, hypothesises that there is in fact no stress in disyllabic words in which both vowels are reduced.&lt;ref&gt;Dobrovolsky (1999), p. 541.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dialects ==
There are two dialects of Chuvash:
* '''Viryal''', or '''Upper''' (which has both ''o'' and ''u''), and
* '''Anatri''', or '''Lower''' (which has ''u'' for both ''o'' and ''u'': up. totă "full", tută "taste" – lo. tută "full, taste" ).
The literary language is based on both the Lower and Upper dialects. Both [[Tatar language|Tatar]] and the neighbouring [[Uralic languages]] such as [[Mari language|Mari]] have influenced the Chuvash language, as have [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]], which have all added many words to the Chuvash lexicon.

==Morphology==
As characteristic of all Turkic languages, Chuvash is an [[agglutinative language]] and as such, has an abundance of [[suffix]]es but no native prefixes or prepositions, apart from the partly reduplicative [[intensive]] prefix, such as in: шурӑ - ''white'', шап-шурӑ - ''snow-white'', хура - ''black'', хуп-хура - ''jet black'', такӑр - ''flat'', так-такӑр - ''absolutely flat'', тулли - ''full'', тӑп-тулли - ''chock full'' (compare to [[Turkish language|Turkish]] beyaz - ''white'', bem-beyaz ''snow-white'', kara - ''black'', kap-kara - ''jet black'', düz - ''flat'', dümdüz - ''absolutely flat'', dolu - ''full'', dopdolu - ''chock full''). One word can have many suffixes, which can also be used to create new words like creating a verb from a noun or a noun from a verbal root. See [[#Vocabulary|Vocabulary]] below. It can also indicate the grammatical function of the word.

===Nouns and adjectives===
Chuvash nouns can take endings indicating the person of a possessor. They can take case-endings. There are six [[declension|noun cases]] in the Chuvash declension system:

[[Grammatical case]]:
* [[Nominative case|Nominative]] -
* [[Possessive]] (of), after consonants: -ӑн/-ӗн, after vowels: -н according to the vowel harmony
* [[Dative case|Dative]]-[[Accusative case|Accusative]] (for), after consonants: -а/-е, after vowels: -на/-не according to the vowel harmony
* [[Locative case|Locative]] (in, on), formed by adding -ра/-ре, -та/-те according to the vowel harmony
* [[Ablative case|Ablative]] (from), formed by adding -ран/-рен, -тан/-тен according to the vowel harmony
* [[Instrumental-comitative case|Instrumental]] (with), formed by adding  -па(лан)/-пе(лен) according to the vowel harmony
* [[Abessive case|Abessive]] (without), formed by adding -сӑр/-сӗр according to the vowel harmony
* [[Causative]], formed by adding -шӑн/-шӗн according to the vowel harmony

[[Plural]]:
* [[Nominative case|Nominative]]: -сем
* [[Possessive]]: -сен
* [[Dative case|Dative]]-[[Accusative case|Accusative]]: -сене
* [[Locative case|Locative]]: -сенче
* [[Ablative case|Ablative]]: -сенчен
* [[Instrumental-comitative case|Instrumental]]: -семпе
* [[Abessive case|Abessive]]: -семсĕр
* [[Causative]]: -семшĕн

Also:
* [[Terminative case|Terminative]]–[[antessive case|antessive]] (to), formed by adding -(ч)чен
* relic of [[distributive case|distributive]], formed by adding -серен: кунсерен "daily, every day", килсерен "per house", килмессерен "every time one comes"
* [[Semblative case|Semblative]] (as), formed by adding пек to pronouns in genitive or objective case (ман '''пек''' "like me", сан '''пек''' "like you", ун '''пек''' "like him, that way", пирӗн '''пек''' "like us", сирӗн '''пек''' "like you all", хам '''пек''' "like myself", хӑвӑн '''пек''' "like yourself", кун '''пек''' "like this"); adding -ла, -ле to nouns (этемле "humanlike", ленинла "like Lenin")
* [[Postfix (linguistics)|Postfix]]: ха (ha)
[[Adjective]]:
* [[Comparative]]: -рах/-рех
[[Verb]]:
* [[Infinitive]]: -ма(лла|лли|лăх)/-ме(лле|лли|лĕх), negative postfix мар
* [[Gerund]] (-ing): positive -ни, negative -манни/-менни
* [[Conditional mood]] if: -са(сă)н/-се(сĕ)н, negative -маса(сă)н/-месе(сĕ)н, even if: -са(сă)н та/-се(сĕ)н те, negative -маса(сă)н та/-месе(сĕ)н те

Taking кун (day) as an example:

{|class = "wikitable"
! Noun case
! Chuvash
! English
|-
| [[Nominative case|Nominative]]
| кун
| day, or the day
|-
| [[Possessive]]
| кунӑн
| of the day
|-
| [[Dative case|Dative]]-[[Accusative case|Accusative]]
| куна
| to the day
|-
| [[Locative case|Locative]]
| кунта
| in the day
|-
| [[Ablative case|Ablative]]
| кунтан
| of the day, or from the day
|-
| [[Instrumental case|Instrumental]]
| кунпа
| with the day
|}

Possession is expressed by means of constructions based on verbs meaning "to exist" and "not to exist" ("пур" and "ҫук"). For example, to say, "My cat had no shoes":

: {{lang|cv|кушак + -ӑн ура атӑ(и) + -сем ҫук + -ччӗ}}
: {{lang|cv|(кушакӑн ура аттисем ҫукччӗ)}}

which literally translates as "cat-mine-of foot-cover(of)-plural-his non-existent-was."

===Verbs===
Chuvash verbs exhibit person and can be made negative or impotential; they can also be made potential. Finally, Chuvash verbs exhibit various distinctions of tense mood, and aspect: a verb can be progressive, necessitative, aorist, future, inferential, present, past, conditional, imperative or optative.

| килеймерӗр
|align="right" | You (plural) had not been able to come.
|-
| килеймерӗр-и?
|align="right" | Have you (plural) not been able to come?
|}

===Vowel harmony===
[[Vowel harmony]] is the principle by which a native Chuvash word generally incorporates either exclusively back or hard vowels (а, ӑ, у, ы) and exclusively front or soft vowels (е, ӗ, ӳ, и). As such, a notation for a Chuvash suffix such as -тен means either -тан or -тен, whichever promotes vowel harmony; a notation such as -тпӗр means either -тпӑр, -тпӗр, again with vowel harmony constituting the deciding factor.

Chuvash has two classes of vowels: ''front'' and ''back'' (see the table [[Chuvash language#Vowels|above]]). Vowel harmony states that words may not contain both front and back vowels. Therefore, most grammatical suffixes come in front and back forms, e.g. Шупашкар'''та''' "in Cheboksary" but кил'''те''' "at home".

Two vowels cannot occur in succession.

====Exceptions====
Compound words are considered separate words with respect to vowel harmony: vowels do not have to harmonize between members of the compound (so forms like сӗтел|пукан "furniture" are permissible). In addition, vowel harmony does not apply for [[loanword]]s and some invariant suffixes (such as -ӗ); there are also a few native Chuvash words that do not follow the rule (such as анне "mother"). In such words suffixes harmonize with the final vowel; thus Анне'''пе''' "with the mother".

===Word order===
Word order in Chuvash is generally [[subject–object–verb]].

In [[Australia]] and New Zealand, '''cleanskin wine''' is a term for [[wine]] whose [[wine label|label]] does not indicate the [[winery]] or the [[winemaker]]'s name. It is typically sold at a low price.

Cleanskin labels usually only show the [[grape variety]] and the year of bottling, as well as other information required by Australian law - [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] content, volume, additives and standard drink information.

Cleanskin wines are typically sold cheaply in [[dozen]] lots for home consumption. They may be branded wines that were originally sold at a higher price and re-labelled as cleanskins, or they may be wines produced for the purpose of being sold as cleanskins. Consequently, the quality of various batches of cleanskin wine can vary significantly.

Cleanskin wine was introduced to Australia in the early 2000s as a way for the wine industry to cope with a massive oversupply of wine, and a resulting drop in prices. As a result, wine consumption in Australia has greatly increased as of 2006. Also, the price of cleanskin wine has dropped to around or below the price of [[beer]] or even [[bottled water]].

The word "cleanskin" comes from the Australian term for [[Livestock branding|unbranded]] cattle, and is also used to refer to [[Cleanskin(security)|undercover]] law enforcement agents.

[[File:EarthworksSoftware CutFillMap.jpg|thumb|Cut and fill software: view from above]]

In [[Earthworks (engineering)|earthmoving]], '''cut and fill''' is the process of constructing a [[railway]], [[road]] or [[canal]] whereby the amount of material from [[Cut (earthmoving)|cuts]] roughly matches the amount of fill needed to make nearby [[Embankment (transportation)|embankments]], so minimizing the amount of construction labor.

==Overview==
Cut slopes are rarely created greater than a slope of two to one (horizontal to vertical dimensions).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webs1.uidaho.edu/niatt_labmanual/Chapters/roadwaydesign/theoryandconcepts/CutAndFillSections.htm Roadway design theory and concepts]&lt;/ref&gt;
Cut sections of roadway or rail are characterized by the roadway being lower in elevation than the surrounding terrain. From an operational standpoint there are unique environmental effects associated with cut sections of roadway. For example, air pollutants can concentrate in the ‘'valleys'‘ created by the cut section.  Conversely, [[noise pollution]] is mitigated by cut sections since an effective blockage of line of sight sound propagation is created by the depressed roadway design.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/x1707075n815g604/ C.Michael Hogan, '' Analysis of highway noise''], Journal of Water, Air, &amp; Soil Pollution, Volume 2, Number 3, Biomedical and Life Sciences and Earth and Environmental Science Issue, Pages 387-392, September, 1973, Springer Verlag, Netherlands {{ISSN|0049-6979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fill section==
Fill sections manifest as elevated sections of a roadway or trackbed.  Environmental effects of fill sections are typically favorable with respect to air pollution dispersal, but in the matter of [[roadway noise|sound propagation]], exposure of nearby residents is generally increased, since [[sound wall]]s and other forms of sound path blockage are less effective in this geometry.

There are a variety of reasons for creating fills, among them reduction of [[Grade (slope)|grade]] along a route or elevation of the route above water, swampy ground, or areas where snow drifts frequently collect. Fills can also be used to cover tree stumps, rocks, or unstable soil, in which case material with a higher bearing capacity is placed on top of the obstacle in order to carry the weight of the roadway or railway and reduce differential settlement.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert L. Nichols, Jr., and David A. Day, P.E., ''Moving the Earth: The Workbook of Excavation,'' 5th ed. (New York: McGraw-Hill, 2005), pp. 8.16 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The practice of cut-and-fill was widely utilized to construct tracks along rolling terrain across the British Isles.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} It was later performed on new dwellings for returned soldiers in Ireland at the end of World War II. This application was developed by Irish railway engineer Lachlan J. Boland, who saw the benefits of introducing railway practices to residential construction.

== Software ==
A number of software products are available for calculating cut and fill.  A simple approach involves defining different earthworks features in a software program and then adjusting elevations manually to calculate the optimal cut and fill.  More sophisticated software is able to automatically balance cut and fill and take account of materials.  Software that can do this falls under the broad category of [[Comparison of Earthworks Estimation Software|earthworks estimation software]].

'''Dakshinaranjan Mitra Majumdar''' ({{lang-bn|দক্ষিণারঞ্জন মিত্র মজুমদার}}; 1877–1956) was a celebrated Indian writer in [[Bengali language|Bengali]] of [[fairy tales]] and children's literature. He was born at Ulail in Dhaka district of Bengal province in British India (now [[Dhaka District]] of [[Bangladesh]]). His major contribution to Bengali literature was the collection and compilation of Bengali folk and fairy tales in four volumes - ''[[Thakurmar Jhuli]]'' (Grandmother's Bag of Tales), ''Thakurdadar Jhuli'' (Grandfather's Bag of Tales), ''Thandidir Thale'' (Maternal-Grandmother's Bag of Tales) and ''Dadamashayer Thale'' (Maternal-Grandfather's Bag of Tales).&lt;ref name=pedia&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chakravarti|first1=Barun Kumar|title=Mitra Majumder, Dakshinaranjan|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Mitra_Majumder,_Dakshinaranjan|website=Banglapedia|accessdate=25 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="68014">'''Data retention''' defines the policies of [[persistent data]] and [[records management]] for meeting legal and business [[data archive|data archival]] requirements; although sometimes interchangeable, not to be confused with the [[Data Protection Act 1998]].

The different data retention policies weigh legal and [[data privacy|privacy]] concerns against economics and [[need to know|need-to-know]] concerns to determine the retention time, archival rules, data formats, and the permissible means of [[computer data storage|storage]], [[data access|access]], and [[encryption]].

In the field of [[telecommunication]]s, '''data retention''' generally refers to the storage of [[call detail record]]s (CDRs) of [[telephony]] and [[internet]] [[traffic]] and [[database transaction|transaction]] data ([[Internet Protocol Detail Record|IPDRs]]) by governments and commercial organisations. In the case of government data retention, the data that is stored is usually of telephone calls made and received, [[email]]s sent and received, and [[website]]s visited. [[Telephone tapping#Location data|Location data]] is also collected.

The primary objective in government data retention is [[traffic analysis]] and [[mass surveillance]]. By analysing the retained data, governments can identify the locations of individuals, an individual's associates and the members of a group such as political opponents. These activities may or may not be lawful, depending on the constitutions and laws of each country. In many jurisdictions access to these databases may be made by a government with little or no judicial oversight.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

In the case of commercial data retention, the data retained will usually be on transactions and web sites visited.

Data retention also covers data collected by other means (e.g., by [[Automatic number-plate recognition]] systems) and held by government and commercial organisations.

A data retention policy is a recognized and proven protocol within an organization for retaining information for operational use while ensuring adherence to the laws and regulations concerning them. The objectives of a data retention policy are to keep important information for future use or reference, to organize information so it can be searched and accessed at a later date and to dispose of information that is no longer needed.&lt;ref name="Data retention policy"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Rouse |first1=Margaret |title=Data retention policy |url=http://searchdatabackup.techtarget.com/definition/data-retention-policy |publisher=TechTarget |accessdate=30 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The data retention policies within an organization are a set of guidelines that describes which data will be archived, how long it will be kept, what happens to the data at the end of the retention period (archive or destroy) and other factors concerning the retention of the data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Rouse |first1=Margaret|title=Data retention |url=http://searchstorage.techtarget.com/definition/data-retention |publisher=TechTarget |accessdate=30 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A part of any effective data retention policy is the permanent deletion of the retained data; achieving secure deletion of data by encrypting the data when stored, and then deleting the encryption key after a specified retention period. Thus, effectively deleting the data object and its copies stored in online and offline locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Li |first1=J |last2=Singhal |first2=S |last3=Swaminathan |first3=R |last4=Karp |first4=AH |title=Managing Data Retention Policies at Scale |journal=IEEE Xplore |date=19 October 2012 |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=393–406 |doi=10.1109/TNSM.2012.101612.110203 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Amendment (Data Retention) Act 2015}}
In 2015, the Australian government introduced [[Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Amendment (Data Retention) Act 2015|mandatory data retention laws]] that allows data to be retained up to two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Australia passes controversial new metadata law|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-32061421|accessdate=28 March 2015|work=BBC News|date=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scheme is estimated to cost at least AU$400 million per year to implement, working out to at least $16 per user per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Scott|first1=Elise|title=Metadata laws pass parliament|url=https://au.news.yahoo.com/a/26809707/metadata-laws-pass-parliament/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20150408084812/https://au.news.yahoo.com/a/26809707/metadata-laws-pass-parliament/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=8 April 2015|accessdate=28 March 2015|work=AAP|publisher=7 News|date=27 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It will require telecommunication providers and ISPs to retain telephony, Internet and email metadata for two years, accessible without a warrant, and could possibly be used to [[Trade group efforts against file sharing|target file sharing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Knott |first1=Matthew |title=Malcolm Turnbull introduces legislation for metadata retention scheme |url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/malcolm-turnbull-introduces-legislation-for-metadata-retention-scheme-20141030-11e101.html |accessdate=14 November 2014 |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=30 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Malcolm |first1=Jeremy |title=To Nobody's Surprise, Australian "Terrorism" Law May Be Used for Copyright Enforcement |url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/11/nobodys-surprise-australian-terrorism-law-may-be-used-copyright-enforcement |accessdate=14 November 2014 |publisher=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation|EFF]] |date=3 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Attorney-General of Australia|Attorney-General]] has broad discretion on which agencies are allowed to access metadata, including private agencies.&lt;ref name="afr"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kerin|first1=John|title=What new metadata laws mean for you|url=http://www.afr.com/news/politics/what-new-metadata-laws-mean-for-you-20150327-1m3l9j|accessdate=28 March 2015|work=Australian Financial Review|ref=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== European Union ==
On 15 March 2006, the [[European Union]] adopted the [[Data Retention Directive]], on "the retention of data generated or processed in connection with the provision of publicly available electronic communications services or of public communications networks and amending Directive 2002/58/EC".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Directive 2006/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 March 2006 on the retention of data generated or processed in connection with the provision of publicly available electronic communications services or of public communications networks and amending Directive 2002/58/EC |url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2006:105:0054:0063:EN:PDF |date=April 13, 2006 |work=Official Journal of the European Union }}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/12/14/eu_data_retention_vote/ |work=[[The Register]] |title=MEPs vote for mandatory data retention |date=December 14, 2005 |accessdate=2011-12-21 |author=John Leyden }}&lt;/ref&gt; It requires Member States to ensure that communications providers retain the necessary data as specified in the Directive for a period of between 6 months and 2 years  in order to:

* Trace and identify the source of a communication;
* Trace and identify the destination of a communication;
* Identify the date, time, and duration of a communication;
* Identify the type of communication;
* Identify the communication device;
* Identify the location of mobile communication equipment.

The data is required to be available to "competent" national authorities in specific cases, "for the purpose of the investigation, detection and prosecution of serious crime, as defined by each Member State in its national law".

The Directive covers [[fixed telephony]], [[mobile telephony]], Internet access, email, and [[VoIP]]. Member States were required to transpose it into national law within 18 months—no later than September 2007. However, they may if they wish postpone the application of the Directive to Internet access, email, and VoIP for a further 18 months after this date. A majority of Member States exercised this option. All 28 EU States have notified the European Commission about the transposition of the Directive into their national law. Of these, however, Germany and Belgium have only transposed the legislation partially.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Data retention |url=http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/what-we-do/policies/police-cooperation/data-retention/index_en.htm |publisher=Directorate-General of the European Commission |accessdate=8 March 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140311170440/http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/what-we-do/policies/police-cooperation/data-retention/index_en.htm |archivedate=11 March 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A report evaluating the Directive was published by the European Commission in April 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2011:0225:FIN:en:PDF |title=Evaluation report on the Data Retention Directive (Directive 2006/24/EC) |format=PDF |publisher=[[European Commission]] |date=18 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It concluded that data retention was a valuable tool for ensuring criminal justice and public protection, but that it had achieved only limited harmonisation. There were serious concerns from service providers about the compliance costs and from civil society organisations who claim that mandatory data retention was an unacceptable infringement of the fundamental right to privacy and the protection of personal data. The Commission is now reviewing the legislation.

In response to the report, on May 31, 2011, the [[European Data Protection Supervisor]] expressed some concerns on the European Data Retention Directive, underlining that the Directive "does not meet the requirements imposed by the fundamental rights to privacy and data protection".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edps.europa.eu/EDPSWEB/webdav/site/mySite/shared/Documents/Consultation/Opinions/2011/11-05-30_Evaluation_Report_DRD_EN.pdf |title=Opinion of the European Data Protection Supervisor on the Evaluation report from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on the Data Retention Directive (Directive 2006/24/EC) |format=PDF |publisher=European Data Protection Supervisor |date=31 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 April 2014, the Court of Justice of the European Union declared the Directive 2006/24/EC invalid for violating fundamental rights. The Council's Legal Services have been reported to have stated in closed session that paragraph 59 of the European Court of Justice's ruling "suggests that general and blanket data retention is no longer possible".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vorratsdatenspeicherung.de/content/view/745/79/lang,en/ |title=EU lawyers tell Member States: Blanket communications data retention "no longer possible" |publisher=Stoppt die Vorratsdatenspeicherung! |date=23 June 2014 |accessdate=22 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A legal opinion funded by the Greens/EFA Group in the European Parliament finds that the blanket retention data of unsuspicious persons generally violates the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, both in regard to national telecommunications data retention laws and to similar EU data retention schemes (PNR, TFTP, TFTS, LEA access to EES, Eurodac, VIS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Franziska Boehm |author2=Mark D Cole |url=http://www.uni-muenster.de/Jura.itm/hoeren/materialien/boehm/Boehm_Cole-Data_Retention_Study-June_2014.pdf |title=Data Retention after the Judgement of the Court of Justice of the European Union |publisher=[[The Greens–European Free Alliance]] |format=PDF |date=30 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===

====Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act 2014====
The Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act came into force in 2014. It is the answer by the United Kingdom parliament after a declaration of invalidity was made by the Court of Justice of the European Union in relation to Directive 2006/ 24/EC in order to make provision, about the retention of certain communications data.&lt;ref name="DRIP"&gt;{{cite web |title=Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act 2014 |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2014/27/pdfs/ukpga_20140027_en.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=[[Office of Public Sector Information]] |accessdate=31 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition, the purpose of the act is to:

* Amend the grounds for issuing interception warrants, or granting or giving certain authorizations or notices.
* Make provision about the extraterritorial application of that Part and about the meaning of “telecommunications service” for the purposes of that Act;
* Make provision about a review of the operation and regulation of investigatory powers; and for connected purposes &lt;ref name="DRIP"/&gt;

The act is also to ensure that communication companies in the UK retain communications data so that it continues to be available when it is needed by law enforcement agencies and others to investigate committed crimes and protect the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Data Retention Legislation (Impact Assessment) |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukia/2014/266/pdfs/ukia_20140266_en.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=[[Office of Public Sector Information]] |accessdate=31 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Data protection law requires data that isn't of use to be deleted, this means that the intention of this Act could be using data retention to acquire further policing powers using, as the Act make data retention mandatory.

An element of this Act is the provision of the investigatory powers to be reported by 1 May 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act 2014 (Explanatory notes) |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2014/27/pdfs/ukpgaen_20140027_en.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=[[Office of Public Sector Information]] |accessdate=31 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Controversy====
The [[Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act 2014]] was referred to as the "snooper’s charter" communications data bill.&lt;ref name="Guardian 30 Sept 2014"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Travis |first1=Alan |title=Theresa May vows Tory government would introduce ‘snooper’s charter’ |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/sep/30/theresa-may-tory-government-snoopers-charter |accessdate=31 October 2014 |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=30 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The then [[Home Secretary]] Theresa May (and now current [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]]), a strong supporter of the Parliament Act, in a speech said that “If we (parliament) do not act, we risk sleepwalking into a society in which crime can no longer be investigated and terrorists can plot their murderous schemes undisrupted.” &lt;ref name="Guardian 30 Sept 2014"/&gt;

The [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom parliament]] its new laws increasing the power of data retention is essential to tackling crime and protecting the public.  However, not all agree and believe that the primary objective in the data retention by the government is [[mass surveillance]].

After Europe's highest court said the depth of data retention breaches citizens' fundamental [[right to privacy]] and the UK created its own Act, it has led to the British government being accused of breaking the law by forcing telecoms and internet providers to retain records of phone calls, texts and internet usage.&lt;ref name="Guardian 24 June 2014"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hern |first1=Alex |title=British government 'breaking law' in forcing data retention by companies |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jun/24/british-government-breaking-law-in-forcing-data-retention-by-companies |accessdate=31 October 2014 |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=24 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
From this information, governments can identify an individual's associates, location, group memberships, political affiliations and other personal information.

In a television interview, the EU [[Advocate General]] Pedro Cruz Villalón highlighted the risk that the retained data might be used illegally in ways that are "potentially detrimental to privacy or, more broadly, fraudulent or even malicious".&lt;ref name="Guardian 24 June 2014"/&gt;

==== Retention of other data ====
; Postal data – retention period unknown : Information written on the outside of a postal item (such as a letter or parcel), online tracking of postal items, records of special postal items (such as records of registered, recorded or special delivery postal items), records of parcel consignment, delivery and collection.
; Banking data – seven years : ''[[The Economist]]'' reported that UK banks are required to retain data on all financial transactions for seven years though this has not been verified.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} It is not clear whether data on credit card transactions is also retained for seven years.
; Vehicle movement data – two years : Documents leaked from the [[Association of Chief Police Officers]] (ACPO) have revealed that the UK is planning to collect data from a nationwide network of automatic numberplate recognition cameras and store the data for two years in a controversial new centre being built at Hendon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/newspaper/0,,176-1869818,00.html |title=Spy cameras to spot drivers' every move |author1=Emma Smith |author2=Dipesh Gadher |work=[[Sunday Times]] |date=13 November 2005 |archivedate=6 January 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060106064734/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/newspaper/0%2C%2C176-1869818%2C00.html |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This data could then be linked to other data held by the government and watchlists from the police and security services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/11/15/vehicle_movement_database/ |title=Gatso 2: rollout of UK's '24×7 vehicle movement database' begins |author=John Lettice |work=[[The Register]] |date=15 November 2005 |accessdate=21 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Access to retained data ====
The bodies that are able to access retained data in the United Kingdom are listed in the [[Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000]] (RIPA). These are the following:

* Police forces, as defined in section 81(1) of RIPA
* National Criminal Intelligence Service
* Serious Organised Crime Agency, formerly the National Crime Squad
* HM Customs and Excise
* Inland Revenue (the latter two have been merged into [[HM Revenue and Customs]])
* Security Service
* Secret Intelligence Service
* [[Government Communications Headquarters]] (GCHQ)

However, the [[Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000]] (RIPA) also gives the [[Home Secretary]] powers to change the list of bodies with access to retained data through [[secondary legislation]]. The list of authorised bodies now includes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2000/20002417.htm |title=Statutory Instrument 2000 № 2417 granting additional bodies access to retained telecoms data |publisher=[[The National Archives]] |date=7 September 2000 |accessdate=21 December 2011 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

* Food Standards Agency
* Local authorities
* [[National Health Service]]

==== Reasons for accessing retained data ====
The justifications for accessing retained data in the UK are set out in the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (RIPA). They include:

* Interests of national security;
* Preventing or detecting crime or of preventing disorder;
* Economic well-being of the United Kingdom;
* Public safety;
* Protecting public health;
* Assessing or collecting any tax, duty, levy or other imposition, contribution or charge payable to a government department;
* Preventing death or injury in an emergency or any damage to a person's physical or mental health, or of mitigating any injury or damage to a person's physical or mental health;
* Any other purpose not listed above which is specified for the purposes of this subsection by an order made by the Secretary of State.

=== Czech Republic ===
Implementation of the directive was part of Act. No. 259/2010 Coll. on electronic communications as later amended. Under Art. 97 (3), telecommunication data are to be stored between 6 and 12 months. The [[Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic|Czech Constitutional Court]] has deemed the law unconstitutional and found it to be infringing on the peoples right to privacy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seattlepi.com/national/1103ap_eu_czech_data_retention.html Seattle PI] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of July 2012, new legislation was on its way.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edri.org/edrigram/number10.15/czech-republic-new-data-retention-law] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010213833/http://www.edri.org/edrigram/number10.15/czech-republic-new-data-retention-law|date=October 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Italy ===
In July 2005 new legal requirements&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edri.org/edrigram/number3.16/Italy |publisher=[[European Digital Rights]] |title=Italy decrees Data Retention until 31 December 2007 |accessdate=2011-12-24 |date=August 10, 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125052500/http://www.edri.org/edrigram/number3.16/Italy |archivedate=25 January 2012 |df= }}
&lt;/ref&gt; on data retention came into force in Italy.

;Subscriber information : Internet cafés and public telephone shops with at least three terminals must seek a license permit within 30 days from the Ministry of Home Affairs. They must also store traffic data for a period which may be determined later by administrative decree. [[Wi-Fi hotspot]]s and locations that do not store traffic data have to secure ID information from users before allowing them to log on. For example, users may be required to enter a number from an ID card or driving license. It is not clear how this information is validated. Mobile telephony users must identify themselves before service activation, or before a [[SIM card]] may be obtained. Resellers of mobile subscriptions or pre-paid cards must verify the identity of purchasers and retain a photocopy of identity cards.
; Telephony data : Data, including location data, on fixed line and mobile telephony must be retained for 24 months. There is no requirement to store the content of calls. Telephony operators must retain a record of all unsuccessful dial attempts.
; ISP data : Internet service providers must retain all data for at least 12 months. The law does not specify exactly what traffic data must be retained.  There is no requirement to store the content of internet communications.
; Legality : The legislation of July 2005 enables data retention by outlawing all the relevant data protection provisions until 31 December 2007. Under the data protection provisions, service providers are obliged to store traffic data and user data for no less than 365 days, even if they no longer need it to process the communication or to send bills, policy requires user id information, location, tracking data be stored and kept on file for easy access by law enforcement and/or other authorities who request this information (permission must be asked to view sensitive user ID data on file). The traffic data which will now be retained can be used for anti-terrorism purposes and for general penal enforcement of criminal offences large and small.

Italy already required the retention of telephony traffic data for 48 months, but without location data. Italy has adopted the EU Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications 2002 but with an exemption to the requirement to erase traffic data.

=== Denmark ===
[[Denmark]] has implemented the EU data retention directive and much more, by logging all internet flow or sessions between operators and operators and consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.retsinformation.dk/Forms/R0710.aspx?id=2445 |title=Bekendtgørelse om udbydere af elektroniske kommunikationsnets og elektroniske kommunikationstjenesters registrering og opbevaring af oplysninger om teletrafik (logningsbekendtgørelsen) |trans-title=Order on providers of electronic communications and electronic communications services recording and storage of information about telecommunications traffic (Retention Order) |publisher=[[Danish Ministry of Justice]] |language=Danish |date=13 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* "2.2.1. Session logging (section 5(1) of the Executive Order) Providers of access to the internet must, in respect of the initiating and terminating package of an internet session, retain data that identifies the sending and receiving internet protocol address (in the following called IP address), the sending and receiving port number and the transmission protocol."
* "2.2.2. Sampling (section 5(4) of the Executive Order)  The obligation to retain data about the initiating and terminating package of an internet session does not apply to providers in case such retention is not technically feasible in their systems. In that case, data must instead be retained for every 500th package that is part of an end user’s communication on the internet."
* "2.2.5. Hot spots (section 5(3) of the Executive Order) In addition to the internet data that must otherwise be retained, the provider must retain data that identifies the precise geographic or physical location of a hot spot and the identity of the communication equipment used. This means that a provider of internet access via a hot spot must retain data on a user’s access to the internet and, at the same time, retain data that identifies the geographic location of the hot spot in question."

[[Sweden]] implemented the EU's 2006 [[Data Retention Directive]] in May 2012, and it was fined €3 million by the [[Court of Justice of the European Union]] for its belated [[Transposition (law)|transposition]] (the deadline was 15 September 2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sweden is ordered to make a lump sum payment of €3 000 000 for its delay in transposing the Data Retention Directive into national law|url=http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2013-05/cp130066en.pdf|work=Court of Justice of the European Union|issue=No 66/13|date=30 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ECJ sets important legal precedent by striking down Data Retention Directive|url=http://openeuropeblog.blogspot.com/2014/04/ecj-sets-important-legal-precedent-by.html|work=Open Europe Blog|date=8 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.svd.se/nyheter/inrikes/artikel_2954845.svd| title=Sverige stäms för datalagring| publisher=SvD| language=Swedish| date=26 May 2009| accessdate=2011-12-28| author=Tobias Olsson}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Ullman| first=Tommie| url=http://www.stockholmnews.com/more.aspx?NID=8522| title=The Riksdag said Yes to Data Retention Directive| date=21 March 2012| work=Stockholm News| accessdate=2012-09-19| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120803134123/http://www.stockholmnews.com/more.aspx?NID=8522| archivedate=3 August 2012| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The directive allowed member states to determine the duration data is retained, ranging from six months to two years; the [[Riksdag]], Sweden's legislature, opted for six months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.regeringen.se/content/1/c6/09/15/21/2f8c7424.pdf |title=Lagring av trafikuppgifter för brottsbekämpning |language=Swedish |publisher=Betänkande av Trafikuppgiftsutredningen |date=1 November 2007 |location=Stockholm |accessdate=2011-12-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111114181024/http://www.regeringen.se/content/1/c6/09/15/21/2f8c7424.pdf |archivedate=14 November 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2014, however, the CJEU struck down the Data Retention Directive. [[Swedish Post and Telecom Authority|PTS]], Sweden's telecommunications regulator, told Swedish [[Internet service provider|ISPs]] and telcos that they would no longer have to retain call records and internet metadata.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Essers|first1=Loek|title=Sweden won't enforce data retention law against ISP that deleted metadata|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2142780/sweden-wont-enforce-data-retention-law-against-isp-that-deleted-metadata.html|work=PCWorld|date=11 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; But after two government investigations found that Sweden's data retention law did not break its obligations to the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], the PTS reversed course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tung|first1=Liam|title=Swedish data retention back in full swing minus one ISP|url=http://www.zdnet.com/swedish-data-retention-back-in-full-swing-minus-one-isp-7000035206/|work=ZDNet|date=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of Sweden's major telecommunications companies complied immediately, though [[Tele2]] lodged an unsuccessful appeal. The one holdout ISP, [[Bahnhof]], was given an order to comply by November 24 deadline or face a five million [[Swedish krona|krona]] ($680,000) fine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Meyer|first1=David|title=Swedish ISP Bahnhof threatened with fine for not storing customer data for law enforcement|url=https://gigaom.com/2014/10/29/swedish-isp-bahnhof-threatened-with-fine-for-not-storing-customer-data-for-law-enforcement/|work=GigaOm|date=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Germany ===
The [[Germany|German]] [[Bundestag]] had implemented the directive in "Gesetz zur Neuregelung der Telekommunikationsüberwachung und anderer verdeckter Ermittlungsmaßnahmen sowie zur Umsetzung der Richtlinie 2006/24/EG".&lt;ref&gt;"Gesetz zur Neuregelung der Telekommunikationsüberwachung und anderer verdeckter Ermittlungsmaßnahmen sowie zur Umsetzung der Richtlinie 2006/24/EG."

Any communications data had to be retained for six months. On 2 March 2010, the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany]] ruled the law [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|unconstitutional]] as a violation of the guarantee of the secrecy of correspondence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8545772.stm "BBC UK German court orders stored telecoms data deletion"], BBC News website, English&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 October 2015, a second law for shorter, up to 10 weeks long, data retention excluding email communication was passed by parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bundestag.de/blob/392012/69c860bf6e65681333d940bdae973b60/20151016_1-data.pdf|title=Endgültiges Ergebnis der Namentlichen Abstimmung Nr. 1|last=|first=|date=2015-10-16|website=|publisher=Deutscher Bundestag|access-date=2016-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dip21.bundestag.de/dip21/btd/18/050/1805088.pdf|title=Entwurf eines Gesetzes zur Einführung einer Speicherpflicht und einer Höchstspeicherfrist für Verkehrsdaten|last=|first=|date=2016-06-09|website=|publisher=Deutscher Bundestag|access-date=2016-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tutanota.com/blog/posts/germany-data-retention|title=Germany Just Introduced Data Retention.

The EU directive has been transposed into [[Romanian law]] as well, initially as Law 298/2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.romanialibera.ro/actualitate/eveniment/ce-solicita-romaniei-sa-transpuna-integral-normele-ue-in-privinta-pastrarii-datelolor-242599.html|title=CE solicită României să transpună integral normele UE în privinţa păstrării datelolor - Romania Libera|author=|date=|website=romanialibera.ro|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Constitutional Court of Romania]] subsequently struck down the law in 2009 as violating constitutional rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ejlt.org//article/view/29/75 |title=The Legality of the Data Retention Directive in Light of the Fundamental Rights to Privacy and Data Protection &amp;#124; Feiler &amp;#124; European Journal of Law and Technology |publisher=Ejlt.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court held that the transposing act violated the constitutional rights of privacy, of confidentiality in communications, and of free speech.&lt;ref&gt;Romanian Constitutional Court Decision no.1258 of Oct. 8, 2009, Official Gazette no. 798 of Nov. 23, 2009.In: http://ejlt.org//article/view/29/75&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Commission]] has subsequently sued Romania in 2011 for non-implementation, threatening Romania with a fine of 30,000 euros per day.&lt;ref name="hotnews"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://economie.hotnews.ro/stiri-telecom-12503594-traian-basescu-promulgat-asa-numita-39-lege-big-brother-39-care-prevede-stocarea-pentru-sase-luni-datelor-trafic-ale-tuturor-utilizatorilor-telefonie-internet.htm|title=Traian Basescu a promulgat asa numita 'lege Big Brother' care prevede stocarea pentru sase luni a datelor de trafic ale tuturor utilizatorilor de telefonie si internet|author=|date=|website=hotnews.ro|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Romanian parliament passed a new law in 2012, which was signed by president [[Traian Băsescu]] in June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telecompaper.com/news/ec-drops-case-against-romania-as-data-retention-law-passes--926708|title=EC drops case against Romania as data retention law passes|author=|date=|website=www.telecompaper.com|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Law 82/2012 has been nicknamed "[[Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Big Brother]]" (using the untranslated English expression) by various Romanian non-governmental organizations opposing it.&lt;ref name="hotnews"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adevarul.ro/news/politica/presedintele-promulgat-legea-big-brother-1_50aeee447c42d5a663a1bd80/index.html|title=Preşedintele a promulgat "Legea Big Brother"|author=|date=12 July 2012|website=adevarul.ro|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avocatnet.ro/content/articles/id_29398/Legea-Big-Brother-a-intrat-in-vigoare-Operatorii-de-telefonie-si-internet-vor-putea-stoca-o-serie-de-date-ale-abonatilor.html|title=Legea Big Brother a intrat in vigoare!

=== Slovakia ===

[[Slovakia]] has implemented the directive in Act No. 610/2003 Coll. on electronic communications as later amended. Telecommunication data are stored for six months in the case of data related to Internet, Internet email and Internet telephony (art. 59a (6) a)), and for 12 months in the case of other types of communication (art. 59a (6) b)).

In April 2014, the Slovak Constitutional Court preliminary suspended effectiveness of the Slovak implementation of Data Retention Directive and accepted the case for the further review.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Husovec on April 28, 2014, [http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/blog/2014/04/first-european-constitutional-court-suspends-data-retention-after-decision-court FIRST EUROPEAN CONSTITUTIONAL COURT SUSPENDS DATA RETENTION AFTER THE DECISION OF THE COURT OF JUSTICE OF EU]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

A 2016 [[Anti-terrorism legislation|anti-terrorist]] federal law 374-FZ known as [[Yarovaya Law]] requires all telecommunication providers to store phone call, text and email metadata, as well as the actual voice recordings for up to 6 months.

== Serbia ==
On 29 June 2010, the [[National Assembly (Serbia)|Serbian parliament]] adopted the Law on Electronic Communications, according to which the operator must keep the data on electronic communications for 12 months. This provision was criticized as unconstitutional by opposition parties and by Ombudsman [[Saša Janković]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.b92.net//eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2010&amp;mm=07&amp;dd=01&amp;nav_id=68178 Tadić signs electronic communications law] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403195028/http://www.b92.net//eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2010&amp;mm=07&amp;dd=01&amp;nav_id=68178 |date=2015-04-03 }}, B92&lt;/ref&gt;

== Switzerland ==
As from 7 July 2016, the [[Law of Switzerland|Swiss Federal Law]] about the Surveillance of the Post and Telecommunications entered into force, passed by the Swiss government on 18 March 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Switzerland |url=https://www.admin.ch/opc/de/federal-gazette/2016/1991.pdf|title=Bundesgesetz betreffend der Überwachung des Post- und Fernmeldeverkehrs (BÜPF)|publisher=admin.ch |date=2016-03-18 |accessdate=2017-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mobile phones ===
Swiss mobile phone operators have to retain the following data for six months according to the BÜPF:

# Phone numbers of incoming and outgoing calls
# SIM- (Subscriber Identity Module), IMSI- (International Mobile Subscribers Identity) and IMEI-numbers (International Mobile Equipment Identity)
# „the location and the electrical boresight of the antenna of the mobile phone with which the monitored person is connected to the communications system at the time of the communication“
# date, time and duration of the connection

=== Email ===
All Internet service providers must retain the following data for six months:

# type of the connections (telephone, xDSL, Cable, permanent line etc.) and if known login data, address information of the origin (MAC-address, telephone number), name, address and occupation of the user and duration of the connection from beginning to end
# time of the transmission or reception of an email, header information according to the SMTP-protocol and the IP addresses of the sending and receiving email application.

Email application refers to SMTP-, POP3-, IMAP4, webmail- and remail-server.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Digitale Gesellschaft |url=https://www.digitale-gesellschaft.ch/ueberwachung/|title=Überwachung|publisher=digitale-gesellschaft.ch |date=2015-09-05 |accessdate=2017-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) commonly records Internet metadata for the whole planet for up to a year in its [[MARINA]] database, where it is used for [[pattern-of-life analysis]]. [[US person|U.S. person]]s are not exempt because metadata are not considered data under US law (section 702 of the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 Amendments Act of 2008|FISA Amendments Act]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=James Ball |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/30/nsa-americans-metadata-year-documents |title=NSA stores metadata of millions of web users for up to a year, secret files show |work=[[The Guardian]] |date= |accessdate=2014-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its equivalent for phone records is [[MAINWAY]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kevin Drum |url=https://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2013/06/washington-post-provides-new-history-nsa-surveillance-programs |title=''Washington Post'' Provides New History of NSA Surveillance Programs |work=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]] |date= |accessdate=2014-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NSA records [[SMS]] and similar [[text messaging|text messages]] worldwide through [[DISHFIRE]].&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite web|last=James Ball in|title=NSA collects millions of text messages daily in 'untargeted' global sweep |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/16/nsa-collects-millions-text-messages-daily-untargeted-global-sweep |work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=16 January 2014 |date=16 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Leveraging commercial data retention ===
Various United States agencies leverage the (voluntary) data retention practised by many U.S. commercial organizations through programs such as [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM]] and [[MUSCULAR]].

Amazon is known to retain extensive data on customer transactions. Google is also known to retain data on searches, and other transactions. If a company is based in the United States the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) can obtain access to such information by means of a [[National Security Letter]] (NSL). The [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] states that "NSLs are secret subpoenas issued directly by the FBI without any judicial oversight. These secret subpoenas allow the FBI to demand that online service providers or [[ecommerce]] companies produce records of their customers' transactions. The FBI can issue NSLs for information about people who haven't committed any crimes.

NSLs are practically immune to judicial review. They are accompanied by gag orders that allow no exception for talking to lawyers and provide no effective opportunity for the recipients to challenge them in court. This secret subpoena authority, which was expanded by the controversial [[USA PATRIOT Act]], could be applied to nearly any online service provider for practically any type of record, without a court ever knowing". The ''[[Washington Post]]'' has published a well researched article on the FBI's use of [[National Security Letters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/05/AR2005110501366.html|title=The FBI's Secret Scrutiny|first=Barton|last=Gellman|date=6 November 2005|publisher=|accessdate=19 April 2018|via=www.washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Failed mandatory ISP retention legislation attempts ===

The United States does not have any [[Internet Service Provider]] (ISP) mandatory data retention laws similar to the European [[Data Retention Directive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Personal Data Privacy and Protection in a Surveillance Era: Technologies and Practices |first=Christina |last=Akrivopoulou |first2=Athanasios |last2=Psygkas |year=2010 |page=257 |publisher=Idea Group Inc |isbn=978-1-60960-083-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=We5iLoALDEEC&amp;pg=PA257 |quote=These civil liberties organizations also highlighted the absence of such a data retention obligation for ISPs in the US... }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some attempts to create mandatory retention legislation have failed:

* In 1999 two models of mandatory data retention were suggested for the United States: What [[IP address]] was assigned to a customer at a specific time. In the second model, "which is closer to what Europe adopted", telephone numbers dialed, contents of Web pages visited, and recipients of e-mail messages must be retained by the [[ISP]] for an unspecified amount of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=ISP snooping gaining support |url=http://news.cnet.com/ISP-snooping-gaining-support/2100-1028_3-6061187.html |work=[[CNET]] |date=April 14, 2006 |accessdate=2009-03-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=FBI, politicos renew push for ISP data retention laws |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-9926803-38.html |quote=Based on the statements at Wednesday's hearing and previous calls for new laws in this area, the scope of a mandatory data retention law remains fuzzy.

* The [[Internet Stopping Adults Facilitating the Exploitation of Today's Youth Act]] (SAFETY Act) of 2009 also known as H.R. 1076 and S.436 would require providers of "electronic communication or remote computing services" to "retain for a period of at least two years all records or other information pertaining to the identity of a user of a temporarily assigned network address the service assigns to that user".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Proposed Child Pornography Laws Raise Data Retention Concerns |url=http://www.crn.com/networking/214502232 |work=[[Channel Web]] |date=February 20, 2009 |accessdate=2009-03-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319010704/http://www.crn.com/networking/214502232 |archivedate=March 19, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This bill never became a law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h111-1076 |work=Govtrack.us |title=H.R. 1076: Internet Stopping Adults Facilitating the Exploitation of Today's Youth (SAFETY) Act of 2009 |date=February 13, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Arguments against data retention ==
It is often argued that data retention is necessary to combat terrorism, and other crimes. Data retention may assist the police and security services to identify potential terrorists and their accomplices before or after an attack has taken place. For example, the authorities in Spain and the United Kingdom stated that retained telephony data made a significant contribution to police enquires into the [[2004 Madrid train bombings]] and the [[2005 London bombings]].{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The opponents of data retention make the following arguments:

# The Madrid train bombings can also be seen as proof that the current data retention level is sufficient and hence the EU directive is not necessity.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}
# Schemes for data retention do not make provisions for adequate regulation of the data retention process and for independent judicial oversight.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}
# Data retention is an invasion of privacy and a disproportionate response to the threat of terrorism.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}
# It is easy for terrorists to avoid having their communications recorded. The Home Office Voluntary Code of Practice of Data Retention admits that there are some internet protocols which cannot be effectively monitored.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} It would be possible for terrorists to avoid monitoring by using [[anonymous P2P]] technologies, internet cafés, [[anonymizer|anonymous proxies]] or several other methods. Some police officers in the EU are sceptical about the value of data retention. For example, Heinz Kiefer, president of Eurocop, the European Confederation of Police, issued a press statement saying "it remains easy for criminals to avoid detection through fairly simple means, for example mobile phone cards can be purchased from foreign providers and frequently switched. The result would be that a vast effort is made with little more effect on criminals and terrorists than to slightly irritate them. Activities like these are unlikely to boost citizens’ confidence in the EU’s ability to deliver solutions to their demand for protection against serious crime and terrorism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurocop-police.org/pressreleases/2005/05-06-02%20PRESS%20JHA%20Council_E.pdf |title=Europe wide retention of telecommunications data unlikely to help law enforcement agencies in the fight against terrorism |publisher=[[Eurocop]] |format=PDF |date=2 June 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726042329/http://www.eurocop-police.org/pressreleases/2005/05-06-02%20PRESS%20JHA%20Council_E.pdf |archivedate=26 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The hardware and software required to store all the retained data would be extremely costly. The costs of retaining data would not only fall on [[Internet Service Providers]] and telephone companies, but also on all companies and other organisations which would need to retain records of traffic passing through their switchboards and servers.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}
#Data retention gives excessive power to the state to monitor the lives of individual citizens.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}
#Data retention may be abused by the police to monitor the activities of any group which may come into conflict with the state; including ones which are engaged in legitimate protests.

There is concern that the definition is vaguely worded and could be applied to supporters of [[animal rights movement|animal liberation]], [[anti-war demonstrator]]s, and many others.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}
#Even if data retention may be justified, the retention periods proposed in some cases are excessive. It has been argued that a period of five days for web activity logs and ninety days for all other data would be adequate for police purposes.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

== Protection against data retention ==
The current directive proposal (see above) would force ISPs to record the internet communications of its users. The basic assumption is that this information can be used to identify with whom someone, whether innocent citizen or terrorist, communicated throughout a specific timespan. Believing that such as mandate would be useful is ignoring that some very committed community of crypto professionals has been preparing for such legislation for decades. Below are some strategies available today to anyone to protect themselves, avoid such traces, and render such expensive and legally dubious logging operations useless.

=== Anonymizing proxy services: Web ===
There are [[Anonymizer|anonymizing proxies]] that provide slightly more private web access.  Proxies must use [[HTTP Secure|HTTPS]] encryption in order to provide any level of protection at all.  Unfortunately, proxies require the user to place a large amount of trust in the proxy operator (since they see everything the user does over HTTP), and may be subject to [[traffic analysis]].

=== P2P communications ===
Some P2P services like file transfer or voice over IP use other computers to allow communication between computers behind firewalls. This means that trying to follow a call between two citizens might, mistakenly, identify a third citizen unaware of the communication.

=== Privacy enhancing tools ===
For security conscious citizens with some basic technical knowledge, tools like [[I2P|I2P – The Anonymous Network]], [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]], [[Mixmaster anonymous remailer|Mixmaster]] and the cryptography options integrated into any many modern mail clients can be employed.

I2P is an international peer-to-peer anonymizing network, which aims at not only evading data retention, but also at making spying by other parties impossible. The structure is similar to the one TOR (see next paragraph) uses, but there are substantial differences. It protects better against traffic analysis and offers strong anonymity and for net-internal traffic end-to-end encryption. Due to unidirectional tunnels it is less prone to timing attacks than Tor. In I2P, several services are available: anonymous browsing, anonymous e-mails, anonymous instant messenger, anonymous file-sharing, and anonymous hosting of websites, among others.

Tor is a project of the U.S. non-profit Tor Project&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.torproject.org/|title=Tor Project - Privacy Online|first=The Tor Project,|last=Inc.|date=|website=www.torproject.org|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; to develop and improve an [[onion routing]] network to shield its users from traffic analysis. Mixmaster is a remailer service that allows anonymous email sending.

[[Java Anon Proxy|JAP]] is a project very similar to Tor. It is designed to route web requests through several proxies to hide the end user's Internet address. Tor support has been included into JAP.

== Initiative against extensive data retention ==
The Arbeitskreis Vorratsdatenspeicherung (German Working Group on Data Retention) is an association of civil rights campaigners, data protection activists and Internet users. The Arbeitskreis coordinates the campaign against the introduction of data retention in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vorratsdatenspeicherung.de/content/view/13/37/lang,en/ |title=About us |publisher=Stoppt die Vorratsdatenspeicherung! |date=2006-05-01 |accessdate=2014-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An analysis of federal Crime Agency (BKA) statistics published on 27 January 2010 by civil liberties NGO AK Vorrat revealed that data retention did not make a prosecution of serious crime any more effective.&lt;ref name="vorratsdatenspeicherung.de"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vorratsdatenspeicherung.de/content/view/426/79/lang,en/ |title=Study finds telecommunications data retention ineffective (27 Jan 2011) |publisher=Stoppt die Vorratsdatenspeicherung! |date= |accessdate=2014-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the EU Commission is currently considering changes to the controversial EU data retention directive, a coalition of more than 100 civil liberties, data protection and human rights associations, jurists, trade unions and others are urging the Commission to propose the repeal of the EU requirements regarding data retention in favour of a system of expedited preservation and targeted collection of traffic data.&lt;ref name="vorratsdatenspeicherung.de"/&gt;

== Plans for extending data retention to social networks ==
In November 2012, answers to a parliamentary inquiry in the [[German Bundestag]] revealed plans of some EU countries including France to extend data retention to chats and social media. Furthermore, the German [[Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution]] (Germany's domestic intelligence agency) has confirmed that it has been working with the ETSI LI Technical Committee since 2003.&lt;ref name="FM4-30-10-2012"&gt;[[FM4]] Online ([[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF]]): [http://fm4.orf.at/stories/1707197/ Vorratsspeicherung für Facebook-Daten] (in German). 2012-10-30.

'''Eva Moberg''' (1932-2011) was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[author]], [[playwright]], and [[debate]]r.

== Biography ==
Eva Moberg was the daughter of author [[Vilhelm Moberg]] and grew up in Stockholm. She graduated from [[secondary school]] in 1952, and in 1963 she became a [[Licentiate (degree)|licentiate]] of [[History of literature|literary history]], [[History of religions|religious history]], and [[practical philosophy]] with her [[thesis]]'' Kärlek och kön, en studie i Colettes diktning'' (English: ''Love and gender, a study of the poetry of [[Colette]]''). She was editor of [[Fredrika-Bremer-Förbundet|Fredrika-Bremer-Förbundet's]] periodical Hertha (1960-1962), culture editor in the weekly magazine Vi (1967-1976) and a columnist for [[Dagens Nyheter]] (1976-1992). She wrote about social issues, politics, and ethical questions. From 1968 to 1970 she held a position as a script writer for [[Sveriges Television]], Sweden's national television network. There, she wrote a series of notable TV [[variety shows]], and later several [[sitcoms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |date= 1988|title= Vem är hon|trans-title= Who is she|url=http://runeberg.org/vemarhon/0321.html|location= Stockholm|publisher=Norstedts |page=321|isbn=91-1-863422-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moberg was an early participant in the [[gender equality]] debate in Sweden. In 1961 she published the article "Kvinnans villkorliga frigivning" (Woman's Conditional Release), which is considered a Swedish feminist classic.&lt;ref name="HekmaGiami2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gert Hekma|author2=Alain Giami|title=Sexual Revolutions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7nOEAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA28|date=14 May 2014|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-1-137-32146-6|pages=28–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that article she argued that equality between men and women was still far off, as women were still expected to see marrying and having children as their purpose in life.&lt;ref name="HekmaGiami2014"/&gt; Her essay started an intense and long-lived debate on men's and women's roles in the family and the society at large. By the middle of the 1960s she became a member of [[Group 222]], a loosely organized [[activist group]] for gender equality. Group 222's and Moberg's ideas of an equitable society criticized the traditional [[Gender role|man's role]]; they claimed to seek not only women's but also men's emancipation. "Men are better than the [[patriarchy]]" was one of Moberg's important ideas - it also became the title of a lecture she later held abroad in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.evamoberg.nu|title= Eva Moberg, officiell webbplats|trans-title=Eva Moberg, official webpage|access-date=2013-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, Moberg also became involved in campaigns against [[nuclear power]] and later in questions of [[pollution]] and as a champion of [[animal rights]].

From 1964 to 1976, Moberg was married to TV producer [[Hans Hederberg]], with whom she had a daughter in 1966. Eva Moberg later lived, until her death, with author [[Gottfried Grafström]].

In [[criminal law]], a '''factual basis''' is a statement of the facts detailing an individual crime and its particulars, stipulated to by the [[prosecutor|prosecution]] and the [[defendant|defense]], which forms a basis by which a [[judge]] can accept a [[plea|guilty plea]] from the [[defendant]].

==United States==
In its criminal justice section, the [[American Bar Association]] has adopted the following standard regarding the need for a factual basis:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abanet.org/crimjust/standards/guiltypleas_blk.html ABA Criminal Justice Section, Standard 14-1.6&lt;/ref&gt;

:''Standard 14-1.6. Determining factual basis of plea''

::''(a) In accepting a plea of guilty or [[nolo contendere]], the court should make such inquiry as may be necessary to satisfy itself that there is a factual basis for the plea. As part of its inquiry, the defendant may be asked to state on the record whether he or she agrees with, or in the case of a nolo contendere plea, does not contest, the factual basis as proffered.''

::''(b) Whenever a defendant pleads nolo contendere or pleads guilty and simultaneously denies culpability, the court should take special care to make certain that there is a factual basis for the plea. The offer of a defendant to plead guilty should not be refused solely because the defendant refuses to admit culpability. Such a plea may be refused where the court has specific reasons for doing so which are made a matter of record.''

In the 2008 book ''Criminal Procedure'', author John M. Scheb pointed out that in the United States, a majority of the states have initiated measures to make sure that the plea is entered into of the defendant's own accord, and that it is grounded in a factual basis.&lt;ref name="scheb"&gt;{{cite book  | last =Scheb  | first =John  | title =Criminal Procedure  | publisher =[[Wadsworth Publishing]]  | year =2008  | pages =148–149  | isbn = 978-0-495-50386-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scheb wrote, "Most states have adopted similar rules of procedure to ensure that pleas are voluntary and comply with constitutional requirements."&lt;ref name="scheb" /&gt; He explained that judges have some discretion in determining the voluntary nature of the plea given by the defendant, "Rules concerning voluntariness and factual basis generally do not specify any precise method to be followed by the court. Judges employ various methods to determine voluntariness. Often these methods include interrogation of the defendant by the judge and sometimes by the prosecutor and defense counsel."&lt;ref name="scheb" /&gt; Scheb noted that, "The objective is to establish that no improper inducements have been made to secure a plea, that the defendant understands the basic constitutional rights incident to a trial, that these rights are being waived, and that he or she comprehends the consequences of the plea."&lt;ref name="scheb" /&gt; Scheb discussed the manner in which the court determines the factual basis for the plea, "In determining that a factual basis exists for the defendant's plea, judges often have the prosecutor briefly outline available proof to establish a ''prima facie'' case of the defendant's guilt. A more extensive inquiry is usually necessary for specific-intent crimes."&lt;ref name="scheb" /&gt; Scheb emphasized the importance why it is necessary to establish a factual basis for the plea, before it is entered by the defendant: "The thoroughness of the court's determination of voluntariness and factual basis becomes important if a defendant later moves to withdraw a plea and enter a plea of not guilty."&lt;ref name="scheb" /&gt;

Born in [[Finland]] before [[Diet of Porvoo|the separation]] of the [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] from [[Sweden Proper|Sweden]], he was old enough to take part in the [[Finnish War]] (1808-09) on the losing Swedish/Finnish side. He served as an [[adjutant]] in the army of general [[Carl Johan Adlercreutz]].

In [[1848 in literature|1848]] he published a book, ''Historia öfver kriget emellan Sverige och Ryssland 1808 och 1809'', critical of the Swedish leadership and praising the Russians. This book was the basis of [[The Tales of Ensign Stål]] by [[Johan Ludvig Runeberg]]. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlit.fi/tietopalvelu/runeberg/schwerin.htm Schwerin, Vilhelm von (1792 - 1808) Suomen sodan vänrikki]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25368">'''{{Lang|de|Gutmensch}}''' (literally ''good human'' in German) is an [[ironic]], [[sarcastic]] or disparaging cultural term similar to "do-gooder". Those who use the term are implying that ''Gutmenschen'' have an overwhelming wish to be good and eagerly seek approval. Further suggesting a supposed [[morality|moralising]] and proselytising behaviour and being [[dogmatic]]. In political [[rhetoric]] ''Gutmensch'' is used as a [[polemic|polemic term]]. See also [[Stereotype]] or [[Personality]].

==Context==

Users of the term believe that people or groups of people with a specific moral attitude show a wrong or problematic behaviour.&lt;ref name="knobloch"&gt;Clemens Knobloch: ''Moralisierung und Sachzwang. Politische Kommunikation in der Massendemokratie''. Duisburg 1998 (künftig: Knobloch: ''Moralisierung'').&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it was used as a popular term in the 1980s for people who valued humanistic, [[altruistic]], but also religious and human goals in life higher than [[utilitarian]] ones. They organise their actions, politics as well as their lives accordingly.&lt;ref name="HoppeWDRMemorandum" /&gt;

The term ''Gutmensch'' is also connected to the term [[political correctness]] and has been used in a derogatory manner since the mid 1990s. In general language use it is always used as a negatively connotated foreign appellation. A use that is meant in "a nice way" can often be found only in face-to-face conversations, such as the saying "to have a heart of gold", in generosity or in an extreme form of [[altruism]].&lt;ref name="HoppeWDRMemorandum" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Katrin Auer: [http://www.oezp.at/pdfs/2002-3-04.pdf "'Political Correctness' – Ideologischer Code, Feindbild und Stigmawort der Rechten."] (PDF; 103&amp;nbsp;kB). In: ''[[Österreichische Zeitschrift für Politikwissenschaft]]''. Volume 31, Nr. 3, 2002, pp. 291–303, especially p. 294; further: Knobloch: ''Moralisierung'';{{full citation needed|date=July 2016}} Gesa von Leesen: "'Das sagt man nicht!' Political Correctness zwischen Moral und Kampfbegriff". In: ''Das Parlament''. 1 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term also hints at the possible difference between "meant well" and "well done". ''Gutmenschen'' have good intentions, want to solve specific problems or have the desire to create a better world. Those who use the term ''Gutmensch'' in a negative way evaluate the actions of ''Gutmenschen'' as not appropriate or unnecessary. This is how the term is used in everyday language. The German dictionary [[Duden]], which included the term in 2000, defines ''Gutmensch'' as "a naive person who acts in an uncritical, exaggerated or tedious way while fighting for political correctness."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.duden.de/rechtschreibung/Gutmensch] in duden.de, accessed 24 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins and use ==
According to researcher Rembert Hüser, the term ''Gutmensch'' was coined as a joke made by German feuilleton writers of the "generation 1989", such as [[Matthias Horx]] and [[Klaus Bittermann]]. They were among the authors of dictionaries opposing the [[protests of 1968]]. These dictionaries were written in the style of ''Eckardt Henscheids Dummdeutsch'' dictionary (dealing with language criticism) and can be considered a combination of popular and political literature. They did not differentiate between the meaning of a word and how it is used. Bittermann explains in his epilogue of the ''Wörterbuch des Gutmenschen'' (dictionary of the ''Gutmensch''):

{{quote|Literary scientist [[Karl Heinz Bohrer]] wrote at the end of his commentaries, in which he argued against the "terror of conciliation exerted by the provinciality of the Federal Republic of Germany": 'Maybe it would be best, if the [[Merkur (magazine)|Merkur]] established a little dictionary of the ''Gutmensch'', including entries like ''tearing down the wall in our minds'', ''constructive debates'', ''weird thinking'' or ''stubbornness''. We have long been waiting for that to happen, in vain as it turns out. Since things have not improved, we feel like we have to take care of that matter ourselves.'|ref=&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Bittermann (Hrsg.): ''Das Wörterbuch des Gutmenschen. Betroffenheitsjargon und Gesinnungskitsch''. München 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Since the mid 1990s, ''Gutmensch'' has been used alongside [[political correctness]]&lt;ref&gt;Z.&amp;nbsp;B. von [[Reinhard Günzel (general)|Reinhard Günzel]], siehe dort.&lt;/ref&gt; in political and ideological debates, in order to degrade political opponents as over-moralizing.&lt;ref&gt;Vgl. Auer: ''"Political Correctness"'', p. 294; Brigitta Huhnke: "'political correctness' – ein Mantra nationaler Erweckung". In: ''ZAG'' 30, 1999 (also in: ''[http://www.zag-berlin.de/antirassismus/archiv/30politicalcorrectness.html ZAG Online]''); Brigitta Huhnke: "'pc' – Das neue Mantra der Neokonservativen". In: Andreas Disselnkötter u.&amp;nbsp;a. (eds.): ''Evidenzen im Fluß. Demokratieverluste in Deutschland''. Duisburg 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

Former ''[[Merkur (magazine)|Merkur]]'' publisher Kurt Scheel once claimed to have used the term first in that sense.&lt;ref&gt;Letter to the editor by Karl Scheel in the ''[[Frankfurter Rundschau]]'', 19 November 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dieter Herberg u.&amp;nbsp;a.: ''Neuer Wortschatz: Neologismen der 90er Jahre im Deutschen.'' Berlin 2004, [https://books.google.com/books?id=nwzq-xXllkAC&amp;pg=PA148 pp. 148 ''ff'']&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gutmensch'' was considered the "latest critical chic" in the art sections of newspapers. Writers, like Klaus Bittermann, came up with a variety of [[neologism]]s referring to [[political correctness|PC]] and accompanying the appearance of ''Gutmensch''. Some of them can roughly be translated as ''Gutmensch language'', ''bleeding-heart language'', ''attitudinal kitsch'', ''attitudinal language'' or ''chatter jargon''.

In 2006, the [[Deutscher Journalisten-Verband|German Journalists Association]] claimed that the term ''Gutmensch'' had its origins in [[Nazi Germany]]. Following that claim, the association planned on including the term in a handbook on the sensitive use of language for journalists, which they wanted to publish in cooperation with the Duisburg Institute of Language and Social Studies.&lt;ref name="HoppeWDRMemorandum"&gt;Jürgen Hoppe/[[Deutscher Journalisten-Verband]]: {{cite web |url=http://www.djv-nrw.de/bilder/Memorandum27.03.06.pdf |title=Memorandum zur "Initiative Journalisten gegen Rassismus" |accessdate=2016-07-20 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928101946/http://www.djv-nrw.de/bilder/Memorandum27.03.06.pdf |archivedate=September 28, 2007 |df= }}, 27 March 2006 (accessed 26 October 2007; PDF; 27&amp;nbsp;kB).&lt;/ref&gt; However, some time later the Institute explicitly objected to that claim made by the [[Deutscher Journalisten-Verband|DJV]]. Having conducted their own research on this topic, the Institute concluded that there was no clear connection between ''Gutmensch'' and Nazi Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diss-duisburg.de/2011/11/das-stigma-gutmensch/#footnote_1_1036 DISS-Journal] des Duisburger Instituts für Sprach- und Sozialforschung&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, in a pre-published sample of the above-mentioned handbook, it was stated that ''Gutmensch'' had been introduced by the Nazis to refer to followers of [[Clemens August Graf von Galen|Cardinal von Galen]], who had openly opposed the [[Action T4|Nazi programme of forced euthanasia]]. According to the [[Deutscher Journalisten-Verband|DJV]], ''Gutmensch'' was derived from the [[Yiddish]] expression "a gutt Mensch" (a good human). Furthermore, they indicated that it was [[Adolf Hitler]], who in his book ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' had repeatedly used the prefix "gut" (good) in a derogatory way, so as to accuse people who expressed goodwill and good-heartedness of collaborating with the German enemies.&lt;ref&gt;Vgl. Adolf Hitler: ''Mein Kampf''. Dort als die "Gutmeinenden" oft synonym für "die Juden", aber auch für Deutsche, die sich nicht eindeutig für oder gegen die nationalsozialistische "Bewegung" entscheiden können. Wie im Falle Nietzsches konnte jedoch auch hier keine Verwendung des Wortes "Gutmensch" dokumentiert werden.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another widespread opinion on where ''Gutmensch'' originates, is that it was [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] who coined it.&lt;ref name="HoppeWDRMemorandum" /&gt; There are numerous disparaging remarks in Nietzsche's writings concerning the "good human", albeit not as a fixed expression. The [[Gesellschaft für deutsche Sprache|Association for the German Language]] mentions as their first source a 1985 edition of the [[Forbes|Forbes magazine]], in which Franz Steinkühler, at that time co-chairman of Germany's biggest [[IG Metall|metalworker's union]], is called a ''Gutmensch''.&lt;ref name="gfds"&gt;Gesellschaft für Deutsche Sprache zum ersten Aufscheinen des Begriffs im Deutschen: [http://gfds.de/gutmensch/ ''Fragen und Antworten: Gutmensch''].&lt;/ref&gt;

A more positive link may be [[Bertolt Brecht]]'s play ''[[The Good Person of Szechwan]]'' ({{lang-de|Der gute Mensch von Sezuan|links=no}}) whose main theme is the difficulty of acting good in a world that is not good.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaterbremen.de/de_DE/spielplan/der-gute-mensch-von-sezuan.1090429 Theaterbremen: Der gute Mensch von Sezuan] (accessed 2 January 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Die Welt]]'' journalist Matthias Heine brings into play German pedagogical scientist Christian Oeser, who may have invented the term. In Oeser's book "Letters to a Maiden on the most fundamental Topics of Aesthetics", published in 1859, he writes about naive ''Gutmenschen'' as follows: "Isn't it clear that in the end, such a gullible ''Gutmensch'' will be laughed at for his unconditional love towards humans, that the whole world will call him a fool and that he will eventually fall prey to his own weakness?"&lt;ref name=mh /&gt;

It is worth mentioning that similar terms can be found in other languages as well, for example the Italian ''buonismo'',  with meanings all referring to the ''Gutmensch''.

===In areas critical of society===

Occasionally, people who see themselves as critics of society ironically condemn would-be campaigners who criticize society without applying the same criteria to themselves. The term ''Gutmensch'' sees criticism of [[racism]] as symbolic when the speakers own racist behaviour is not reflected. That kind of criticism means that political utterances which don’t demand consequences are only made to allow the speaker to appear in a good light. Especially Sunday speeches of politicians will be criticized, if they pretend to be advocates for "victims". People who are concerned determinedly reject a locking up into a role as victim.&lt;ref&gt;Siehe Susan Arndt: ''Weißsein. Die verkannte Strukturkategorie Europas und Deutschlands'' und ''Mythen des weißen Subjekts: Verleugnung und Hierarchisierung von Rassismus''. In: Maureen Maisha Eggers u.&amp;nbsp;a. (Hrsg.): ''Mythen, Masken und Subjekte. Kritische Weißseinsforschung in Deutschland''. Münster 2005, pp. 24–29 and p. 340–362.&lt;/ref&gt;

The "friend of foreigners", having good intentions, is a specific example. According to [[humanism|humanistic]] approaches, they think everyone is equal, but foreigners impose their "own needs, ethical and moral ideas and goals" on him (''jemandem etwas aufzwingen, aufdrängen'') Sabine Forschner).&lt;ref&gt;See also Susan Arndt: "Mythen des weißen Subjekts: Verleugnung und Hierarchisierung von Rassismus". In: Maureen Maisha Eggers u.&amp;nbsp;a. (eds.): ''Mythen, Masken und Subjekte. Kritische Weißseinsforschung in Deutschland''. Münster 2005, pp. 340–362&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Norbert Bolz]] ([[TU Berlin]]), an academic in media and communication, said in a radio station [[Deutschlandfunk]] on 11 August 2014:

{{quote|''Gutmenschen'' are people who have oral presentation techniques that have been given a name in the last couple of decades, i.e. political correctness. This political correctness can be described precisely and therefore also the ''Gutmensch'' is described; it is composed of political moralisation, from a kind of hygiene of speech, with a vast amount of speech taboo and furthermore, also from a kind of frigidly puritan attitude.|ref=&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eben mal die Welt retten!|trans-title=|periodical=|publisher=|url=http://www.deutschlandradiokultur.de/gutmenschen-eben-mal-die-welt-retten.976.de.html?dram:article_id=294305|format=|accessdate=2015-05-2015|last=|date=|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}} Deutschlandfunk, 11 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==In political debates==

The term is used with a different purpose and frequency in the overall political spectrum, i.e. as a polemic term in a discussion with (actual and would-be) representatives of a "political correctness", but mainly in the field of conservativeness, rightwing populism and rightwing totalitarianism.&lt;ref name="HoppeWDRMemorandum" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Auer: ''"Political Correctness"'', p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In political rhetoric===

The [[political right]] use the term more often in order to discrediting political opposites. By downgrading "left" ideals to "do-goodism", they emphasise the claim to argue in an own realistic way and on a factual level while the ''Gutmensch'' are implied to have lost touch with reality, to have a weak [[Human self-reflection|reflecting capacity]], an unrealistic and high claim or [[Utopia|utopian ideas]].&lt;ref name="knobloch" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Auer: ''"Political Correctness"''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Von Leesen: ''"Das sagt man nicht!"''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Klonovsky]], for example, chief executive at German news magazine ''[[Focus (German magazine)|Focus]]'', accused:&lt;ref&gt;Michael Klonovsky: [http://www.focus.de/wissen/bildung/theologie/debatte-das-gott-wort-der-guten_aid_536776.html ''Das Gott-Wort der Guten.''] In: ''[[Focus (German magazine)|Focus]]'', 31, 2 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The ''Gutmensch'' finds the fact outrageous that there is an unproductive lower class, a benefit-scrounging scum, that there is [[plebs]]. Therefore, he declares everyone of being bad who points it out to someone. If it is, on top of everything, an economic migrant, the popular accusation of racism and xenophobia is coming very likely into practice in the same way as the user of the term settles far from social inner cities.}}

People who are offended in such a way see this as a rhetoric trick, which ridicules their striving for [[humanism]], [[solidarity]] and [[social equity]]. Seeing the counterpart as ''Gutmensch'' took the discussion to a personal (''[[argumentum ad hominem]]'' = "ad personam") and emotional level, in order to avoiding a discussion on a content level.&lt;ref name="knobloch" /&gt;

The term is often used as an aggressive defense strategy against criticism on personal positions. Potential criticism on (factual or putative) racist, [[Homophobia|homophobic]], anti-semitic (and increasing also anti-Islamic) or [[sexism|sexual]] violations taboos is debilitated by downgrading the person with those rhetoric strategies.&lt;ref name="knobloch" /&gt;

===Moralistic strategy===

In political discussions the usage of the term ''Gutmensch'' gains a moral polarized shape, which is convenient to decrease the respect of the political opponent and to discredit them. There are strategies in political rhetoric to discuss political topics either on a factual level or on a moral level. [[Social stigma|Stigmatizations]] of political opponents by using terms like "[[political correctness|pc]]" (political correctness) or ''Gutmensch'' moralize communications. Therefore, the position of the political opponent is discredited and he is forced to change position, if he doesn`t want to lose reputation. Especially obvious becomes the strategy, if there are actual or claimed [[taboos]]. The art of the rhetoric is working when terms like ''Gutmensch'' or "moralizing prig" bring the political opponent in discussions into situations where the reply is supposed to say "my opinion or the tabooed view". This rhetoric proves as effective, because only under difficult circumstances can factual matters be discussed analytically. [[Clemens Knobloch]] ([[Universität Siegen]]) refers to this relationship.

===As "ideological code"===

According to a discourse analytical survey, which was published by political scientist Katrin Auer in the [[Österreichische Zeitschrift für Politikwissenschaft|Österreichischen Zeitschrift für Politikwissenschaft]] (ÖZP), are especially topics placed by the political right under the [[cipher]] "pc" (the term coming up usually because of ''Gutmenschen'') of which the society was not able to talk openly without falling victim to the "terror of ''Gutmenschen''". ''Gutmenschen'' thereby revealed were often pictured club swinging, in this context talking about "moralizing prig", "racist prig", "fascist prig", "Auschwitz prig" or similar, so Auer. Therefore, a concept of the enemy and a concept of the taboo came up, in which in particular misogynist, racist and [[anti-Semitic]] comments appeared rebellious and taboo breaking, it was said in the article. The term ''Gutmensch'' functioned here as code in order to being able to talk and being understood in this paradigm without having to expose one's own attitude, Auer adds. A well-known example was to replace the word "Jew" by the term ''Gutmensch'' in anti-Semitic speeches. Parts of the audience which understood themselves not as anti-Semitic, were allowed to agree without hesitation, concludes Katrin Auer.&lt;ref&gt;Auer: [http://www.oezp.at/pdfs/2002-3-04.pdf ''Political Correctness.''], pp. 294, 300 (PDF; 103&amp;nbsp;kB).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Further use ==

===Until 20th century===
''Gutmenschen'', then called bonhommes or boni homines, was a term used for members of the heretic movement in medieval times. They were also referred to as [[Catharism|Cathars]], but for themselves they used the name ''veri christiani'' (true Christians). Aside from the derogatory use, the French term ''bonhomme'' (good person) did carry a positive connotation at times, ascribing moral qualities just as the English term ''[[gentleman]]'' does. On the other hand, it was non other than [[Karl Marx]] who used ''bonhomme'' in a derisive manner. He polemically wrote about "Jacque le bonhomme", which was a disguise for mocking [[Max Stirner]].&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Engels: ''Marx-Engels-Werke.'' 3, pp. 121–123.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Harald Martenstein ===
German author and journalist [[Harald Martenstein]] developed his own definition of ''Gutmensch'' after repeatedly having dealt with the term ''[[wikt:shitstorm|shitstorm]]'' (in German exclusively referring to an [[internet meme]]) in his writings. In 2015, he proposed using ''Gutmensch'' to describe people who act aggressive and [[Self-righteousness|self-righteous]] when fighting for what they think is the ''good cause'', unmindfully considering themselves being excluded from any set of social rules. ''Gutmenschen'', in that sense, believe that it is ok to be offensive, humiliating and to even exert violence.&lt;ref name="smü"&gt;Harald Martenstein: {{cite web|title=Über die Sehnsucht nach moralischer Überlegenheit|trans-title=|periodical=|publisher=|url=http://www.zeit.de/zeit-magazin/2015/12/harald-martenstein-moral-gutmensch|format=|accessdate=2015-05-13|last=|date=|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}}, ''Zeit-Magazin'', 6 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Not even having publicized his proposal, Martenstein already received heavy criticism. Among the critics was [[Die Welt]] journalist Matthias Heine, who accused Martenstein of tempting the wrong people to over-use the word by putting too much of an emphasis on the term, therefore turning ''Gutmensch'' into an unusable word for those being of sound mind.&lt;ref name=mh&gt;Matthias Heine: {{cite web|title=Wer Gutmensch sagt, verdient sich seinen Shitstorm|trans-title=|periodical=|publisher=|url=https://www.welt.de/kultur/article138678946/Wer-Gutmensch-sagt-verdient-sich-seinen-Shitstorm.html|accessdate=2015-05-13|last=|date=|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}}, ''[[Die Welt]]'', 23 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Ironically, one year earlier, German writer [[Akif Pirinçci]] had called Martenstein a ''Gutmensch'' in his [[polemic]] ''Deutschland von Sinnen'' (Germany unhinged).&lt;ref name="kas"&gt;Harald Martenstein: {{cite web|title=Über Kritik von allen Seiten|trans-title=|periodical=|publisher=|url=http://www.zeit.de/zeit-magazin/2014/21/harald-martenstein-kritik|format=|accessdate=2015-05-13|last=|date=|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}} ''Zeit-Magazin'', 17 May 2014; Akif Pirinçci: ''Deutschland von Sinnen. Der irre Kult um Frauen, Homosexuelle und Zuwanderer.'' Manuscriptum, Waltrop 2014, {{ISBN|978-3-944872-04-9}}, p. 228&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, Martenstein was still rather in favor of the term, polemically explaining in his book ''Die neuen Leiden des alten M.'' (The New Suffering of Old M.): "As for good-doing and most things in general, it is a question of the dosage: when overdone it becomes totalitarian."&lt;ref name="nlam"&gt;Harald Martenstein: ''Die neuen Leiden des alten M. Unartige Beobachtungen zum deutschen Alltag.'' Bertelsmann Verlag, München 2014, {{ISBN|978-3-641-15077-8}}, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wordmark ''Gutmensch'' ==
In 2014, Patrick Orth, manager of German rock band [[Die Toten Hosen]], registered the [[wordmark]] ''Gutmensch''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/gesellschaft/tote-hosen-sichern-sich-rechte-am-unwort-gutmensch-a-1072085.html Deutungshoheit: "Tote Hosen" sichern sich Rechte am Unwort "Gutmensch"], spiegel.de&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the band has been selling print T-shirts labeled "Gutmensch – No one likes us. We don't care!". 10 Euros per T-shirt are donated to an organisation helping migrant crime victims.

==''Unwort des Jahres''==

Germany annually nominates a populist word that has a bad connotation. It is called "[[Un-word of the year|Unwort des Jahres]]" (in German the prefix Un- can be added to certain nouns, denoting undesirability and depreciating the original meaning). The jury consists of four German linguists and one journalist, who are independent and change every year.

''Gutmensch'' was nominated in 2011 (second position) and 2015 (first position).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sprachkritik: ''Gutmensch'' ist Unwort des Jahres|trans-title=|periodical=Spiegel Online|publisher=|url=http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/gesellschaft/gutmensch-ist-unwort-des-jahres-2015-a-1071545.html|accessdate=2016-01-12|last=|date=2016-01-12|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2011 the jury stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;By using the term the ethical idea of the good man is picked up maliciously in internet forums in order to vilify all dissidents without considering their arguments. The term "Wutbürger" (enraged people) is used in a similar way, although the term ''Gutmensch'' violates principles of democracy (...). The term has been used in that way for already 20 years. However, it has gained more influence in different socio-political contexts in 2011 and has therefore increased its potential of vilifying dissidents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unwortdesjahres.net/fileadmin/unwort/download/pressemitteilung_unwort2011_01.pdf "Pressemitteilung: Unwort des Jahres 2011"], 17 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The statement in 2015 said that the term is connected to the refugee crisis. Here, especially those are insulted who voluntarily help refugees or stand against refugee asylums attacks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unwortdesjahres.net/fileadmin/unwort/download/pressemitteilung_unwort2011_01.pdf Pressemitteilung der Jury]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wahl des 25.

The term ''Gutmensch'' was selected because "readiness to help others" vilified everyone who helped as naive, stupid and unworldly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sueddeutsche.de/kultur/-gutmensch-ist-unwort-des-jahres-1.2814403 ''"Gutmensch" ist Unwort des Jahres 2015.''] ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'', 12 Januar 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The criticism was not only against populists of the right, but also against journalists of important media channels who would use the term "Gutmensch".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeit.de/kultur/2016-01/unwort-des-jahres-2015-gutmensch ''Gutmensch ist Unwort des Jahres''], ''[[Die Zeit]]'', 12 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Handicapping''', in [[sport]] and [[game]]s, is the practice of assigning advantage through scoring compensation or other advantage given to different contestants to equalize the chances of winning.  The word also applies to the various methods by which the advantage is calculated. In principle, a more experienced participant is disadvantaged, or a less experienced or capable participant is advantaged, in order to make it possible for the less experienced participant to win whilst maintaining fairness.  Handicapping is used in scoring many games and competitive sports, including [[Go (board game)|go]], [[shogi]], [[chess]], [[croquet]], [[golf]], [[bowling]], [[polo]], [[basketball]], and [[track and field]] events.  Handicap races are common in clubs which encourage all levels of participants, such as swimming or in cycling clubs and sailing clubs, or which allow participants with a variety of standards of equipment.  Often races, contests or tournaments where this practice is competitively employed are known as ''Handicaps''.

'''Handicapping''' also refers to the various methods by which spectators can predict and quantify the results of a sporting match.  The term is applied to the practice of predicting the result of a competition, such as for purposes of betting against the [[Spread betting|point spread]]. A favored team that wins by less than the point spread still wins the game, but bets on that team lose.

In either case the '''handicapper''' is the person who sets the handicaps for the activity.  &lt;!-- Handicapper redirects to this article --&gt;

==Etymology==
The term ''handicap'' derives from [[hand-in-cap]], referring to a system wherein players placed bets or money into the cap of a neutral arbiter to reach an agreement as to the relative values of items sought to be traded.&lt;ref&gt;"handicap, n." The Oxford English Dictionary. 2nd ed. 1989. OED Online. Oxford University Press. 8 Oct. 2008 {{cite web |url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50102189 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524184911/http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50102189 |archivedate=May 24, 2011 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Competition handicapping==
In a 'result adjustment' style handicap event, the outcome may be adjusted by some factor determined by the handicap.  Some forms of car or yacht racing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the PY|publisher=Royal Yachting Association|url=http://www.rya.org.uk/SiteCollectionDocuments/technical/Web%20Documents/py-general/RYA_G01_Panel_15_2000x1500_07.pdf|accessdate=23 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, the winner, on elapsed time, may differ from the fastest competitor when the times have been adjusted for the different competitors' handicaps.

In a 'pursuit' style handicap race, all participants are clocked in a time trial before the race. When this takes place at the same event as the main race, it is known as the handicap. In the race itself, the participants do not all start at the same "Go"; the starts are staggered, based on the handicaps. The slowest swimmer, or cyclist, for example, starts first and the fastest starts last, making the end of the race (hopefully) close. An ideal handicap race is one in which all participants finish at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukhorseracing.co.uk/newtoracing/HandicappingExplained.asp] UK Horse Racing. Accessed 5 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The winner is the person who beats his or her own time.

Similarly, physically staggered starting positions can be used, for example, in greyhound racing a handicap race is where greyhounds (based on their ability) start from different [[Greyhound racing in the United Kingdom#Racing Jacket Colours and Starting Traps|starting traps]] set at different measurements from the finish line, and in human foot racing, for example, the [[Stawell Gift]].

Some motorsport events, especially in [[sports car racing]], demand teams to stop the vehicle in the pitbox a fixed period of time depending on the drivers' classification, thus giving advantage to less skilled drivers. An example of a championship using this system is the [[International GT Open]]. The advantage of this system over [[ballast weight]] systems is that vehicles have the normal performance on track, so better drivers will be able to recover time and overtake slower drivers.

Contrarily, horse race handicaping is implemented using extra weight.

===Horse racing===
{{main|Handicap (horse racing)}}
A handicap race in horse racing is a race in which horses carry different weights, allocated by the handicapper. A better horse will carry a heavier weight, to give him or her a disadvantage when racing against slower horses. The handicapper's goal in assigning handicap weights is to enable all the horses to finish together (in a dead heat).

The skill in betting on a handicap horse race is in determining which horse can overcome its handicap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britishhorseracing.com/inside_horseracing/about/whatwedo/handicapping.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101031095844/http://britishhorseracing.com/inside_horseracing/about/whatwedo/handicapping.asp |archivedate=2010-10-31 |df= }} British Horseracing Authority. Accessed 5 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Golf===
{{main|Handicap (golf)}}
Handicapping in the game of golf is by manipulating the golfer's score (number of strokes).

===Chess===
{{main|Handicap (chess)}}
Types of chess handicaps include:
* the stronger player surrenders a certain piece or pieces
* the weaker player has extra moves at the beginning of the game
* the weaker player has extra time on the chess clock
* the odds-giver to deliver checkmate with a specified piece

===Go===
{{main|Handicap (go)}}
Handicapping in go includes the weaker player being given an advantage by placing a number of stones before the stronger player commences, and by final points adjustment.

===Shogi===
{{main|Handicap (shogi)}}
Handicapping in shogi is achieved by removing one or more pieces from the stronger player's side.  Shogi (Japanese chess) and many of its variants have [[Shogi#Player ranking and handicaps|handicaps]].

===Gliding===
{{main|Glider (sailplane)}}

===Polo===
{{main|Handicap (polo)}}
The polo handicap is an estimation of the player's worth to his or her team. It is an overall rating of a player's horsemanship, team play, knowledge of the game, strategy and horses.  The difference between the total of the polo handicaps for the players on each team is then used to determine the minimum score difference for the better team to score to enable them to win.

===Sailing===
{{main|Handicap (sailing)}}
Handicaps for sailing vessels in sailing races have varied throughout history, and they also vary by country, and by sailing organisation. Sailing handicap standards exist internationally, nationally, and within individual sailing clubs.

Sailing race handicaps may be based on vessel capability and-or crew experience, and today typically adjust the time a vessel takes to reach the finish point of the race.

===Tennis===
{{main|Handicap (tennis)}}

===Motor cycle speedway===
[[Calculated Match Average]] is a handicap calculated for every motorcycle speedway rider.

==Outcome prediction==
===Middle and arbitrage bets===
There are strategies that involve differences in the lines on the same event at different books. One bet is called a "middle", which when a player finds two books that offer different point spreads for the same event. They will bet the more favorable spread at both books, and if the final score falls between the two, the bettor will win both bets. On the other hand, if the total falls outside the range of the "middle" the bettor only loses a small percentage of a bet (the "juice" or "vig" taken by the house).

For example, Book 1 has Team A as a 3-point favorite, and Book 2 has team B as a 3-point favorite. If a player bets Team B at Book 1, and Team A at Book 2, he will win both bets if either side wins by 2 or less points, and will win one bet and lose the other (known as a "side") if either team wins by 3 points.

Another strategy, known as arbitrage, or an "arb" or "scalp", involves finding different moneylines for the same event. In this case, the bettor will bet the more favorable line at both books, and have a guaranteed profit. For example, if Book 1 considers Team A to be worth +200 (2 to 1 underdog), and Book 2 considers Team B to be worth +200, a bettor can bet Team A at Book 1, and Team B at Book 2, and guarantee a 100% profit. This is a no-risk bet, as the player is guaranteed a profit no matter the result of the game.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

===Famous handicappers===
The first very well known sports handicapper in American culture was [[Jimmy Snyder (sports commentator)|Jimmy "The Greek" Snyder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pace|first=Eric|title=Jimmy "The Greek" Snyder; A Sports Oddsmaker|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/22/sports/jimmy-the-greek-snyder-76-is-dead-a-sports-oddsmaker.html|work=New York Times|accessdate=22 April 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his career he worked for [[CBS]] on their Sunday morning show, ''[[The NFL Today]]''. Because sports betting had a social taboo at the time, Snyder was not allowed to mention betting on games specifically. Instead, he would predict the score. Over the years the attitude towards sports betting, and handicapping in general, has changed. [[Billy Walters (gambler)|Billy Walters]] was profiled by ''[[60 Minutes]]'' because of his handicapping abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Logan|first=Lara|title=Sports Betting: Billy Walters|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6FAUQ6SFKM|work=CBSNewsOnline|accessdate=16 Janueary 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Billy Walters, and other unknown members of the Computer Group, developed a system for handicapping games and beating [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] sportsbooks. ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' covered [[Jon Price]] a reclusive sports bettor that hires Ph.D's and works off of algorithmic information for his predictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jensen|first=David|title=Seeking PHD's Who Minor in Sports|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-jensen/hiring-guru-jon-price-see_b_8166112.html|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[ESPN]] wrote an article on [[Haralabos Voulgaris]] naming him as the one of the premier [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] handicappers in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Eden|first=Scott|title=Meet The World's Top NBA Gambler|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/playbook/dollars/post/_/id/2935/meet-the-worlds-top-nba-gambler|work=ESPN The Magazine|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=21 Feb 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claims to have developed a system that uses advanced statistical analysis to predict the outcomes of games. In the past, very few people did any mathematical calculations when handicapping sporting events. [[Predictions]] were usually made from hunches or information not readily available to the public. However, with the advancement of technology computers powerful enough to run advanced simulation models now frequent homes and offices. Advanced statistics such as DVOA, Win Shares and Points per Possession are talked about in mainstream media. Brian Burke, author of The Fifth Down blog featured in the ''[[New York Times]]'', wrote a formula using advanced statistical techniques that has shown consistency correctly predicting [[National Football League|NFL]] winners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Burke|first=Brian|title=Game Probabilities Are Back|url=http://fifthdown.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/27/n-f-l-week-4-game-probabilities-are-back/|work=New York Times|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=27 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Handicapping, as a profession, is very similar to being a [[stock analyst]]. Like [[Wall Street]] did in the 1970s, the sports handicapping industry is undergoing a quantitative revolution. Many successful handicappers also use money management systems similar to financial [[investment]] professionals. The most popular, and mathematically superior, system is the [[Kelly criterion]]. It is a formula for maximizing profits and minimizing losses based on payout odds and win probability of the underlying [[asset]].

'''Huilliche''' (which can also be found spelt '''Williche''', '''Huiliche''' or '''Veliche''') is a moribund branch of the [[Araucanian languages|Araucanian language family]]. In 1982 it was spoken by about 2,000 ethnic [[Huilliche]] people in [[Chile]], but now it is only spoken by a few elderly speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ethnologue.com/language/huh|title = Huilliche|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is spoken in the nation's [[Los Lagos Region|Los Lagos]] and [[Los Ríos Region|Los Ríos]] regions; and mountain valleys, between the city of Valdivia and south toward [[Chiloé Archipelago]].



Huilliche is composed of at least two varieties, called Huillichesungun and Tsesungun by their speakers. Huillichesungun is spoken in Wequetrumao, on the island of Chiloé, and Tsesungun is spoken Choroy Traiguen, on the coast of Osorno province.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.swarthmore.edu/SocSci/dharris2/pdfs/reports/Enduring_Voices-Chile_2011.pdf|title = Enduring Voices in Chile—January 2011|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = |last = Harrison|first = David K.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Huilliche is closely related to [[Mapudungun]], the language of the [[Mapuche]], though more research is needed to determine the degree of mutual intelligibility between the two. The "Enduring Voices" project of National Geographic reports the following:&lt;blockquote&gt;"They are to some degree hidden within the broader Mapuche ethnic group, yet consider themselves quite distinct in both language and identity [...] Though the two languages [Huillichesungun and Tsesungun] may share as many as 80% of basic words, we confirmed that they differ in their sounds and grammar, as well as in their ethno-linguistic identity [...] Unexpectedly, Tsesungun, though it is geographically closer to Mapudungun, is less similar to it."&lt;/blockquote&gt;The Jesuit priest Luis de Valdivia reported in 1606 that there was linguistic unity in the territory between Coquimbo and Chiloé, from the Pacific to the Andes, and that this was composed of varieties whose differences were mostly in pronunciation and vocabulary. This analysis is supported by researchers at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century, such as Félix de Augusta or Rodolfo Lenz, and by those in the second half of the 20th century, such as Robert Croese. The latter two noted that Huilliche was the most divergent of the varieties of Araucanian, as did Pilar Álvarez-Santullano, a researcher in the phonology and syntax of Chesungun on the Osorno coast.

Most Huilliche speakers are older adults, and most ethnic Huilliche speak Spanish as their first language, making both Huilliche varieties highly endangered.

==Life and career==

Ideal Petrov was born in [[Varna]] on 18 May 1899. He tried acting during his school years, but his actual debut on stage came after a prolonged stay in Russia.&lt;ref name='darik' /&gt; He debuted in 1919 on the stage of the Varna Drama and Opera Theatre. Subsequently, he had three spells as an actor in the Probuda Theatre and the Varna Municipal Theatre. Between 1923 and 1925 he was part of the Popular Travelling Theatre and the [[Haskovo]] Town Theatre. Petrov proceeded to take roles in theatres around [[Bulgaria]], in cities like [[Plovdiv]], [[Ruse, Bulgaria|Ruse]], [[Pleven]], [[Burgas]], and even in the [[Skopje People's Theatre]]&lt;ref name="1 година 1"&gt;{{cite book |title= One Year Skopje People's Theatre |last=Goryanski |first= Petar |language= Bulgarian  |coauthors= |year=1942 |publisher= Българско дѣло |location=Skopje |isbn= |pages=1 |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that existed briefly during [[World War II]].

His most prominent roles included that of Tartuffe in [[Molière]]'s [[Tartuffe|comedy of the same name]], Luka in [[Maxim Gorky]]'s ''[[The Lower Depths]]'', and the Mayor in [[Nikolai Gogol]]'s ''[[The Government Inspector]]''. According to his grandson, Ideal Petrov was not a fan of cinema and only agreed to take part in a single movie. He played the role of Hasan Pasha in a film about the fictional character [[Hitar Petar]].&lt;ref name='bnt'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bnt.bg/part-of-show/koj-e-ideal-petrov|title=Who is Ideal Petrov?|language= Bulgarian|publisher=[[Bulgarian National Television]]|date=17 March 2014|accessdate=30 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ideal Petrov died in his home city of Varna on 20 September 1983.&lt;ref name='enc'&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of Bulgarian Theatre|language= Bulgarian|date=2005|publisher=Trud|isbn=9545287713|pages=349–350}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==

Petrov's popularity as an actor led to his name turning into an idiom for something of "great quality".&lt;ref name=btv /&gt; According to his grandson, Ideal Petrov was still alive at the time the term was coined.&lt;ref name=btv /&gt;&lt;ref name='bnt' /&gt; Calling a performance or an item "Ideal Petrov" is common in colloquial [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]]. The term is also a [[pop-culture]] phenomenon having been used as a title of a popular song by [[rapper]] [[Krisko]].&lt;ref name='bnt' /&gt;

"Secular Jewish Identity: Yidishkayt in America", ''The Tribe of Dina: A Jewish Women's Anthology'', ''[[Sinister Wisdom]]'' Issue 29/30, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier in 1943, Klepfisz's father had smuggled Irena and her mother out of the ghetto; Irena was placed in a Catholic orphanage, while her mother, using false papers, worked as a maid for a Polish family.&lt;ref name="Dartmouth-bio"/&gt; After the uprising, her mother retrieved her from the orphanage and fled with her into the Polish countryside, where they survived the [[Second World War]] by hiding and concealing their Jewish identities, aided by Polish peasants.&lt;ref name="Norton-Bio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dartmouth-bio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~wgst60/projects/poetry/Klepfisz/Klepfisz-bio.html |title=Irena Klepfisz |publisher=Dartmouth College |date= |accessdate=2013-11-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090713043114/http://www.dartmouth.edu/~wgst60/projects/poetry/Klepfisz/Klepfisz-bio.html |archivedate=July 13, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, the remaining family moved briefly to [[Łódź]] before moving to [[Sweden]] in 1946. Irena and her mother immigrated to the [[United States]] in 1949.&lt;ref name="autogenerated324"&gt;Klepfisz author bio, ''The Tribe of Dina: A Jewish Women's Anthology'', ''Sinister Wisdom'' Issue 29/30, p. 324.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1736 Memoirs byGyles Boston.jpg|thumb|John Gyles Memoirs (1736)]]

'''John Gyles''' ({{circa}}1680 at [[Pemaquid, Maine]]{{mdash}}1755 at [[Roxbury, Boston]]) was an interpreter and soldier, most known for [[captivity narrative|his account]] of his experiences with the [[Maliseet]] tribes at their headquarters at [[Meductic Indian Village / Fort Meductic|Meductic]], on the [[Saint John River (Bay of Fundy)|Saint John River]].&lt;ref name="cdn_bio"&gt;{{cite DCB |title=Gyles, John |first=W. S. |last=MacNutt |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/gyles_john_3E.html |volume=3 |accessdate=25 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== King William's War ==
During [[King William's War]], in 1689, when he was nine years of age, he was living with his family at [[Fort William Henry (Pemaquid Beach, Maine)|Fort Charles]]. On 2 August, while labouring with his father Thomas near the new fort, he was taken prisoner by [[Maliseet]]s in the [[Siege of Pemaquid (1689)]]. His father was killed, one brother was taken by the Penobscot, and only one brother escaped. John was conveyed up the [[Penobscot River]], across [[portage]]s to the [[Chiputneticook Lakes]], and on to the main Maliseet village [[Meductic Indian Village / Fort Meductic|Meductic]].

[[File:CastineMainePlaqueJamesGiles.jpg|thumb|Sign at site of death of John Gyles' brother, Dyce Head Lighthouse Rd., [[Castine, Maine]]&lt;ref&gt;In [[Castine, Maine]], a plaque on Dyce Head Lighthouse Rd. says: UPON THESE HEIGHTS, in 1692, James Giles [brother of John Gyles], a boy, and an Englishman, taken at Casco [initially taken in the [[Siege of Pemaquid (1689)]]], held in slavery by [[Madockawando]] for attempting to escape, were tortured by fire, compelled to eat their noses and ears and then burned to death at the stake" (See [https://archive.org/stream/memoirsoddadven01gylegoog#page/n18/mode/2up/search/brother John Gyles' captivity narrative, p. 10-11]).&lt;/ref&gt;]]
For six years, Gyles was a [[Enslavement of indigenous peoples in North America|slave to the Maliseets]]. He was forced to serve as [[wikt:drudge|drudge]] to one of the many small hunting parties that moved as far north as [[Gaspé Peninsula|Gaspésie]] and endured harsh treatment.

His fortunes greatly improved in the summer of 1695 when he was sold to [[Louis D'Amours de Chauffours]], who had a [[Seigneurial system of New France|seigneury]] at [[Jemseg, New Brunswick|Jemseg]]. John hunted and traded for D'Amours and worked in his store. In October 1696, the English came up the Saint John River to attack the capital of Acadia in the [[Siege of Fort Nashwaak (1696)]]. D'Amours was in France at the time, but Gyles helped to save his master’s house from destruction. He posted on the door a statement, written by D'Amours’ wife, that English captives had been treated kindly there. After the [[Treaty of Ryswick]], Gyles was delivered to the captain of an English vessel at the mouth of the Saint John and sailed for Boston, where he arrived on 19 June 1698.

== Queen Anne's War ==
Gyles’ knowledge of and fluency in the Indian dialects of Acadia made him invaluable to the governing authorities of New England when war broke out again in 1701. During [[Queen Anne's War]], he was with March in the [[Northeast Coast Campaign (1703)]].  He served as an interpreter under many flags of truce, sailed with Major [[Benjamin Church (ranger)|Benjamin Church]] in 1704, and fought with Colonel [[John March]] at the [[Siege of Port Royal (1707)]].

== Father Rale's War ==
Most of his later life was given to military service and liaison with the Indians. In 1715 he helped construct [[Fort George (Brunswick, Maine)|Fort George]] at [[Brunswick, Maine|Brunswick]]; which was attacked in 1722.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7HpBAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA73&amp;lpg=PA73&amp;dq=%22john+gyles%22+drake+wilderness&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=dVAGHoYAz5&amp;sig=Ybgrvs9xaF-w87KphMNXWDZoLPY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=UFpgVOzYN4WmyQTv_YHABw&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22john%20gyles%22%20drake%20wilderness&amp;f=false Gyles captivity narrative, p. 108]&lt;/ref&gt; He remained to command the fort throughout [[Father Rale's War]], until 1725. He finished his military career as commander of the New England garrison on [[Fort St. George (Thomaston, Maine)]].&lt;ref name="cdn_bio"/&gt;

He married his first wife, Ruth True, in 1703 and his second, Hannah Heath in 1722.

==Legacy==
In 1736 Gyles published his memoirs of his adventures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gyles|first=John|title=Memoirs of Odd Adventures, Strange Deliverances, etc. In the Captivity of John Gyles, Esq.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dB4TAAAAYAAJ |publisher=Google Books|accessdate=25 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; First printed in Boston in 1736, it was reprinted in 1853 and in 1875, and used as the basis for a modern adaptation of the memoirs by Stuart Trueman in 1966.&lt;ref name="cdn_bio"/&gt;

Gyles Cove, north of [[Hillman, New Brunswick|Hillman]] in [[York County, New Brunswick]] was named for him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hamilton|first=William B.|title=Place names of Atlantic Canada|date=1996|publisher=Univ. of Toronto Press|location=Toronto [u.a.]|isbn=0802004717|pages=82–83|edition=Repr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The memoirs are considered a precursor to the frontier romances of [[James Fenimore Cooper]], [[William Gilmore Simms]], and [[Robert Montgomery Bird]].&lt;ref name="Burt2004"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Burt|first=Daniel S.|title=The chronology of American literature: America's literary achievements from the colonial era to modern times|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VQ0fgo5v6e0C|accessdate=7 September 2010|date=13 January 2004|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=978-0-618-16821-7|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A play was produced about his life called ''John Gyles: an Indian Experience'' by [[Theatre New Brunswick]]'s Young Company in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lib.unb.ca/Texts/Theatre/tnb/searchTNBCalendar.cgi?location=Young+Company&amp;search_string=Gyles&amp;start_date=1&amp;end_date=|title=TNB Performance Calendar Search|accessdate=14 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Roman Catholic Church Kamianske.jpg|thumb|175px|left|St. Nicholas Roman Catholic Church in Kamianske in the late 19th century.]]

The first written evidence of settlement in the territory of Kamianske appeared in 1750. At that time the villages of Romankovo and Kamianske, which make the modern city, were a part of the Nova (New) [[Sich]] of the [[Zaporizhian Sich|Zaporizhian]] [[cossacks]]. The city was known as '''Kamianske''', lit. ''Stony Place'' ({{lang-uk|Кам'янське}}, {{lang-ru|link=no|Каменское}}) until 1936&lt;ref&gt;{{uk icon}} [https://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2016/05/19/7108939/ Dniprodzerzhinsk and several more cities got new names]. [[Ukrayinska Pravda]]. 19 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt; when it was renamed to '''Dniprodzerzhynsk''' in honor of communist [[Felix Dzerzhynsky]], the founder of the [[Bolshevik]] [[secret police]], the [[Cheka]]. 

[[Soviet Union|Soviet]] leader [[Leonid Brezhnev]] was born and raised in Kamianske.

On 15 May 2015, [[President of Ukraine]] [[Petro Poroshenko]] signed a bill into law that started a six months period for the [[decommunization in Ukraine|removal of communist monuments and the mandatory renaming of settlements with a name related to]] [[Communism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{uk icon}} [http://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2015/05/15/7068057/ Poroshenko signed the laws about decomunization].

On 19 May 2016, the [[Verkhovna Rada]] voted to rename a number of [[populated places in Ukraine]] including the city of Dniprodzerzhynsk, which was renamed back into '''Kamianske'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.unn.com.ua/uk/news/1572273-rada-pereymenuvala-dniprodzerzhinsk-na-kamyanske-dopovneno |title=Рада перейменувала Дніпродзержинськ на Кам'янське |date=19 May 2016 |publisher=Українські Національні Новини |language=Ukrainian |accessdate=19 May 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160519213554/http://www.unn.com.ua/uk/news/1572273-rada-pereymenuvala-dniprodzerzhinsk-na-kamyanske-dopovneno |archivedate=May 19, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
While mostly located on right bank of Dnieper, Kamianske stretches over the hydroelectric station onto the left bank where the portion of city is known as "Livyi bereh" neighborhood (literally ''Left bank''). The neighborhood arches to the west of the Kamianske's suburb of Kurylivka.

To the east Kamianske municipality borders [[Dnipro]] city creating an [[urban sprawl]].

==Administrative division==
* Dniprovskyi district (western city district)
**neighborhoods: Romankove (former settlement), Livyi bereh
* Zavodskyi district (central city district)
**neighborhoods: City center, [[Dnieper Metallurgical Combine]]
* Pivdennyi district (south and eastern city parts)
**settlements: Karnaukhivka, Svitle
**neighborhoods: Sotsmisto, Pivdennyi, Bahliy Coke Factory, DniproAzot and Prydniprovskyi Chemical Factory

==Economy==
The economic base of Kamianske is almost exclusively centered on [[heavy industry]], with ferrous [[metallurgy]] being the  backbone of the local economy. Around 57% of the total [[industrial production]] is metallurgy and metal working. The [[chemical industry]] comes second with ca. 17% share of the total industrial output.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miskrada.dp.ua/?pid=28|title=General Characteristics|publisher=Dniprodzerzhynsk City Council home page|language=Ukrainian|accessdate=January 20, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915085915/http://www.miskrada.dp.ua/?pid=28|archivedate=September 15, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the exceedingly industrialized nature of the local economy ensures a rather high employment rate (as of 01.11.2007, official unemployment stood at 1,40%),&lt;ref name="citystat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miskrada.dp.ua/?pid=17|title=Statistics|publisher=Dniprodzerzhynsk City Council home page|language=Ukrainian|accessdate=January 20, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915085832/http://www.miskrada.dp.ua/?pid=17|archivedate=September 15, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; it also contributes to excessive pollution and radiation levels in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=[The characteristics of the air pollution of an industrial region]|journal=Likarska sprava|date=May–Jun 1996|pmid=9377406|issue=5–6|pages=74–8|last1=Belitskaia|first1=EN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kanhaiyalal Maneklal Munshi'''&lt;ref name="Correct spelling 'Kanaiyalal'"&gt;{{cite book|title=Krishnavatara (Vol. I) – The Magic Flute|year=1973|publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan|pages=dust cover flap}}&lt;/ref&gt; (30 December 1887 – 8 February 1971), popularly known as '''K. M. Munshi''', was an [[Indian independence movement]] activist, politician, writer and educationist from [[Gujarat]] state. A lawyer by profession, he later turned to literature and politics. He was a well-known name in [[Gujarati literature]]. He founded [[Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan]], an educational trust, in 1938.&lt;ref name="Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, New Delhi"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, New Delhi|url=http://www.bvbdelhi.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
K. M. Munshi was born on 30 December 1887 in the town of [[Bharuch]] in Gujarat. He had his school education in R.S Dalal High School in Bharuch. He was educated further in [[Vadodara]] (Baroda), where he excelled in academics. One of his teachers at Baroda College was [[Sri Aurobindo|Sri Aurobindo Ghosh]] who had a profound impression on him. Munshi was also greatly influenced by [[Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad III]] of Baroda, [[Mahatma Gandhi]], [[Sardar Patel]] and [[Bhulabhai Desai]].&lt;ref name=Bhagavan&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bhagavan |first=Manu |title=The Hindutva Underground: Hindu Nationalism and the Indina National Congress in Late Colonial and Early Post-Colonial India |journal=[[Economic and Political Weekly]] |volume=43 |number=37 |year=2008 |pp=39–48 |JSTOR=40277950}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Munshi was a prolific writer in Gujarati and English, earning a reputation as one of Gujarat's greatest literary figures. He was also a barrister and an eminent jurist.&lt;ref name=Bhagavan/&gt;

Munshi was an active participant in the [[Indian Independence Movement]] ever since the advent of [[Mahatma Gandhi]]. He joined the [[Swaraj Party]] but returned to the [[Indian National Congress]] on [[Gandhi]]ji's behest with the launch of the [[Salt Satyagraha]] in 1930. He was arrested several times, including during the [[Quit India Movement]] of 1942. A great admirer of [[Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel]], Munshi served in the Central Legislative Assembly in the 1930s.

As the demand for [[Pakistan]] gathered momentum, he gave up non-violence and supported the idea of a civil war to compel the Muslims to give up their demand.  He believed that the future of Hindus and Muslims lay in unity in an "[[Akhand Bharat|Akhand Hindustan]]".&lt;ref name=vhp&gt;{{cite book |last=Katju |first=Manjari |title=Vishva Hindu Parishad and Indian Politics |publisher=Orient Blackswan |year=2013 |ISBN=81-250-2476-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was asked by Gandhi to leave Congress due to his lack of faith in non-violence, but was invited back in 1946.&lt;ref name=Bhagavan/&gt;

==Role in Constituent Assembly==
&lt;ref&gt;http://cadindia.clpr.org.in/search?tag%5Bspeaker%5D%5B%5D=K.M.+Munshi&amp;document_type%5B%5D=1&amp;document_type%5B%5D=0&amp;sort_by=Relevant+Day&amp;filter_tag%5Bspeaker%5D%5B%5D=15360&amp;date_of_debate=&lt;/ref&gt; : He was a part of several committees including Drafting Committee, Advisory Committee, Sub- Committee on Fundamental Rights.&lt;ref&gt;http://cadindia.clpr.org.in/constituent_assembly_members/k_m_munshi&lt;/ref&gt;. Munshi presented his draft on Fundamental Rights to the Drafting Committee and it sought for progressive rights to be made a part of Fundamental Rights.&lt;ref&gt;http://cadindia.clpr.org.in/search?tag%5Bspeaker%5D%5B%5D=K.M.+Munshi&amp;keyword%5B%5D=fundamental+rights&amp;document_type%5B%5D=1&amp;document_type%5B%5D=0&amp;sort_by=Relevant+Day&amp;filter_tag%5Bspeaker%5D%5B%5D=15360&amp;date_of_debate=&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[independence of India]], Munshi was appointed diplomatic envoy and trade agent (Agent-General) to the princely state of [[Hyderabad State|Hyderabad]], where he served until its accession to India in 1948. Munshi was on the ad hoc Flag Committee that selected the [[Flag of India]] in August 1947, and on the committee which drafted the [[Constitution of India]] under the chairmanship of [[B. R. Ambedkar]]. He was also the main driving force behind the renovation of the historically important [[Somnath]] Temple by the Government of India just after independence.

Munshi served as the [[Governor of Uttar Pradesh]] from 1952 to 1957. In 1959, Munshi separated from the Nehru-dominated (socialist) [[Indian National Congress|Congress Party]] and started the [[Akhand Hindustan]] movement. He believed in a strong opposition, so along with [[Chakravarti Rajagopalachari]] he founded the [[Swatantra Party]], which was right-wing in its politics, pro-business, pro-free market economy and private property rights. The party enjoyed limited success and eventually died out. Later, Munshi joined the [[Jan Sangh]].

In August 1964, he chaired the meeting for the founding of the [[Hindutva|Hindu nationalist]] organisation [[Vishva Hindu Parishad]] at Sandipini ashram.&lt;ref name=vhp/&gt;

Being a prolific writer and a conscientious journalist, Munshi started a Gujarati monthly called Bhargava. He was joint-editor of Young India and in 1954, started the Bhavan's Journal which is published by the [[Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan]] to this day. Munshi was President of the [[Gujarati Sahitya Parishad]] and the {{ill|Hindi Sahitya Sammelan|hi|अखिल भारतीय हिंदी साहित्य सम्मेलन}}.

Apart from founding [[Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan]], Munshi was instrumental in the establishment of [[Bhavan's College, Andheri|Bhavan's College]], [[Hansraj Morarji Public School]], [[Rajhans Vidyalaya]], [[Rajhans Balvatika]] and [[Sanjeewan Vidyalaya|Panchgani Hindu School]] (1922). He was elected Fellow of the [[University of Bombay]], where he was responsible for giving adequate representation to regional languages. He was also instrumental in starting the department of Chemical Technology.

Besides being a politician and educator, Munshi was also an environmentalist. He initiated the [[Van Mahotsav]] in 1950, when he was Union Minister of Food and Agriculture, to increase area under forest cover. Since then Van Mahotsav a week-long festival of tree plantation is organised every year in the month of July all across the country and lakhs of trees are planted.

==Works==
Munshi was also a [[litterateur]] with a wide range of interests. He is well known for his historical novels in [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], especially his trilogy ''Patan-ni-Prabhuta'' (The Greatness of Patan), ''Gujarat-no-Nath'' (The Ruler of Gujarat) and ''Rajadhiraj'' (The Emperor). His other works include ''Jay Somnath'' (on [[Somnath]] temple), ''[[Krishnavatara]]'' (on Lord [[Krishna]]), ''Bhagavan Parasurama'' (on [[Parshurama]]), and ''Tapasvini'' (The Lure of Power) a novel with a fictional parallel drawn from the Freedom Movement of India under [[Mahatma Gandhi]]. Munshi also wrote several notable works in English.

Munshi has written mostly based on fictional historical themes namely

# Earlier Aryan settlements in India (What he calls Gaurang's – white skinned)
# Krishna's endeavors in Mahabharata kaal
# More recently in 10th century India around Gujarat, Malwa and Southern India.

K.M. Munshi's novel ''Prithvi Vallabh'' was made into a movie of the same name twice. The adaptation directed by Manilal Joshi in 1924 was very controversial in its day: [[Mahatma Gandhi]] criticised it for excessive sex and violence. The second version was by [[Sohrab Modi]] in 1943.

'''Kenyan Sign Language''' ([[English language|English]]: KSL, [[Swahili language|Swahili]]: LAK) is a [[sign language]] used by the [[deaf community]] in [[Kenya]]. It is used by over half of the country's estimated 600,000 deaf population. There are some dialect differences between [[Kisumu]] (western Kenya) and [[Mombasa]] (eastern Kenya).

==Language situation==
As well as Kenyan Sign Language, a number of other languages have been used for instruction in Kenya: [[Flemish Sign Language|Belgian Sign Language]] (in one school only), [[British Sign Language]] (in one school only), [[American Sign Language]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.gallaudet.edu/dr/faq-world-sl-country.html Gallaudet world FAQ]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051219055710/http://library.gallaudet.edu/dr/faq-world-sl-country.html |date=December 19, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; KIE [[Signed English]], and even [[Korean Sign Language]].&lt;ref name="Ethnxki"&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/14/show_language.asp?code=XKI Ethnologue report]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050924160253/http://www.ethnologue.com/14/show_language.asp?code=XKI |date=September 24, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is probable that students in these schools use a form of KSL regardless.

A [[manual alphabet]] exists mainly from the American Sign Language manual alphabet. However the British manual alphabet was used in the early years.

==Status and recognition==
KSL currently has no legal status, but there is a proposal that Kenyan Sign Language (KSL) and Braille should be recognized in the country's new [[constitution]] as national and official Languages alongside [[English language|English]] and [[Swahili language|Swahili]].

Interpreters are rarely available, and usually 'unqualified' uncertified due to the lack of a training program/certification process.

==Kenya Sign Language Interpreters Association==
[[Kenya Sign Language Interpreters Association]]&lt;ref name="kslia.blogspot.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kslia.blogspot.com|title=Kenyan Sign Language Interpreters Association - (KSLIA)|author=|date=|website=www.kslia.blogspot.com|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; was set up by a group of 20 local interpreters after a training by the first Deaf Education US Peace Corps Volunteers in September 2000. Prior to this training there were several short term trainings conducted by KSLRP/KNAD dating back to 1980s and 1990s. [KSLIA]&lt;ref name="kslia.blogspot.com"/&gt; is an indigenous initiative evolving and strengthening the face of the Interpreting profession in Kenya. [KSLIA]&lt;ref name="kslia.blogspot.com"/&gt; hopes to improve and elevate the standards of Interpreting in Kenya through the following objectives:

a)To secure official recognition by the Government of S.L Interpreters profession

b)Encourage and promote initiatives in improving the standards of SL interpreting and interpreter training and pay scale of interpreters depending with their level and skills of interpretation through
certification.

c)Cooperation with other recognized bodies concerned in the welfare of the deaf and in provision of S.L Interpreters throughout the world.

d)Awareness creation on Deafness and SL. Interpreters through publication of information materials

e)To collect and raise funds for the achievement of goals and objectives through membership fee, subscription, contribution, gifts or donations, commissions and payments, fund raising whether in money or otherwise from both members and non members.

f)To maintain and administer a registry of S.L Interpreters in Kenya, enforce a code of ethics and mediate conflict between the Interpreters and their clients.

KSLIA is working towards the establishment of a training program and a certification process for its membership. [KSLIA]&lt;ref name="kslia.blogspot.com"/&gt; envisions its role in a three pronged approach - the three C's - Certification of members, Continuing education for the practicing Interpreters and Conflict resolution through enforcement of the Code of Ethics.

[[Global Deaf Connection]], [[Deaf Aid]],  and [[KSLIA]]&lt;ref name="kslia.blogspot.com"/&gt; have jointly organized a series of trainings aimed at developing a process to provide training, certification and continued professional development for Kenyan Interpreters.

==Dictionaries and Education==
A Kenyan Sign Language dictionary was published in 1991. KSLRP working with Peace Corp Volunteers have recently developed an interactive digital dictionary ([KSL Interactive]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.peacecorps.gov/index.cfm?shell=learn.whatlike.interactivefeatures.ksl |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-01-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060503091852/http://www.peacecorps.gov/index.cfm?shell=learn.whatlike.interactivefeatures.ksl |archivedate=2006-05-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;)

A new online dictionary and mobile application have been published at www.ksldictionary.com since the year 2014. ([KSL Dictionary] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ksldictionary.com/|title=Home|author=|date=|website=www.ksldictionary.com|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

KSL is not generally used in the classrooms of Kenya's 35 residential [[boarding school]]s for deaf students, despite it being their main language, and reportedly literacy in English and [[Swahili language|Swahili]] is very low among the deaf community. Since the first deaf schools were established in the 1960s, the teaching staff rarely (if ever) included a deaf person, until a government program in the 1990s (spearheaded by the Kenya National Association of the Deaf) saw two deaf individuals trained and employed as teachers. However, the program is now continued by [[Global Deaf Connection]] chaired by Nickson Kakiri. It is based at Machakos Teachers College.

==Sign language organizations==
The [[Kenya National Association of the Deaf]] (KNAD) is a national [[non-governmental organisation]] formed and managed by Deaf people. It was established in 1986 and registered in 1987 under the Societies Act; KNAD is also an ordinary member of the [[World Federation of the Deaf]].

The [[Kenyan Sign Language Interpreters Association]] (KSLIA) is a national, non governmental, Society formed and managed by Kenyan Interpreters to promote the development of the Interpreting profession in Kenya and to provide quality Interpretation services for Deaf Kenyans. It was established in September 2000. KSLIA is working on becoming a member of WASLI World Association of Sign Language Interpreters.

==Sign Bilingual Schools==
[[Humble Hearts School]] in Nairobi, [[Kisii School for the Deaf]] and Kenya Christian School for the Deaf at Oyugis use KSL as the language of instruction. Humble Hearts School is Kenya's first sign bilingual school where KSL and English are taught on an equal par. Kedowa School for the Deaf in Kericho District also uses KSL for instruction, and is unique among Deaf schools in Kenya in that more than half of the teachers at the school are Deaf themselves.

==Biography==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=October 2012}}
Badini was born in the village of [[Shareef Khan]] / Chapari, Noshkay (also known as [[Nushki District]]), [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]], Pakistan. He belongs to Bolanzai clan of [[Badini]] tribe of Rakhshani grouping of the Balochs. His father name is Shahnawaz Khan Badini (1910–1979).

==Education==
Badini studied in his village schools and upon completion of the local Boys' High School, completed his degree in Arts at the [[Degree College]] in [[Quetta]][http://www.jworldtimes.com/Article/82011_We_Do_Not_Have_Capable_people_for_the_Suitable_Jobs].  During this time, early 1970s, he was an active member of [[Baloch Students Organization]] (BSO), and became vice-president of BSO for a year.  He was influenced by Marxist literature and during his college years, he translated [[Joseph Stalin]]'s book ''[https://www.amazon.co.uk/Marxism-National-Colonial-Question-Joseph/dp/1410205894  Marxism And The National And Colonial Question]'' into the [[Balochi language]].  Although this translation has never been officially published, it has been widely read among Badini's fellows.

Later, Badini rejected Stalinist thinking, but maintained a belief in [[Karl Marx]]'s theory as a comprehensive study of universal human development. However he is not an atheist, as most Marxists are; he believes in religion and is impressed by [[Sufism]].
He completed his Master studies from [[University of the Punjab|Punjab University]], [[Lahore]], in Philosophy [http://www.jworldtimes.com/Article/82011_We_Do_Not_Have_Capable_people_for_the_Suitable_Jobs].

== Early career==
After completion of his master's degree, Badini taught for some time at Degree College, Quetta, as a Lecturer of Philosophy, in 1980.  Then he joined Civil Service of Pakistan, where he has served in various posts including:
* Secretary of Fisheries Provincial Government of Balochistan 1994–1996 and from 1998–1999 [http://www.jworldtimes.com/Article/82011_We_Do_Not_Have_Capable_people_for_the_Suitable_Jobs]
* Principal Secretary to Chief Minister of Balochistan 1997
* Commissioner of [[Kalat Division]] 1997–1998
* Secretary of Education Provincial Government of Balochistan 2002–2007 and 2011 to present.[http://www.pakturk.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=180:present-day-challenges-can-be-met-through-modern-education-pakturk-school-providing-quality-education-in-balochistan-secretary-education&amp;catid=28:current-users&amp;Itemid=255][http://dawn.com/2012/09/19/books-in-times-of-war/][https://web.archive.org/web/20140819083002/http://alhijrah.webs.com/apps/photos/photo?photoid=123763390][http://www.balochistan.gov.pk/top-menu-contact-1.html][http://smileweb-news.blogspot.com/2011/12/blog-post_19.html][https://web.archive.org/web/20130702083123/http://www.aku.edu/aboutaku/newsandevents/Pages/AKU-IED-introduces-continuing-professional-development-programme-.aspx][http://www.bbc.co.uk/urdu/pakistan/2011/11/111119_children_school_beating_zs.shtml]

The '''National Institute of Korean Language''' is a [[List of language regulators|language regulator]] of the [[Korean language]]. 
It was created on January 23, 1991, by Presidential Decree No. 13163 (November 14, 1990). It is based in [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]]. 

The institute was originally founded on an non-governmental level as the '''Academy of the Korean Language''' in 1984. When the institute gained status as a subsidiary of the Korean [[Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism|Ministry of Culture]], it was renamed to '''National Academy of the Korean Language''' from 1991. It was again renamed to its current name in 2005.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4506">The '''“one person, one language” approach''' is a popular method adopted by parents attempting to raise [[simultaneous bilingualism|simultaneous bilingual]] children. With the “one person, one language” approach, each parent consistently speaks only one of the two languages to the child. For instance, the child’s mother might speak to him or her exclusively in French, while the father might use only English.

==Reasoning==
Traditionally, the “one person, one language” method has been regarded as the best method for bilingual [[language acquisition]] free of [[code-switching|mixed utterances]].{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} 
The term “one person, one language” was first introduced by the French [[linguist]] [[Maurice Grammont]] in 1902. He theorized that by separating the languages from the beginning, parents could prevent confusion and [[code-mixing]] in their bilingual children.&lt;ref&gt;Barron-Hauwaert 2004, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

George Saunders wrote in his book ''Bilingual Children: From Birth to Teens'' that the “one person, one language” approach “ensures that the children have regular exposure to and have to make use of each language. This is particularly important for the [[minority language]], which has little outside support."&lt;ref&gt;Saunders 1988, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

This method has also been linked to an early development of [[metalinguistic awareness]].&lt;ref&gt;De Houwer 1996, sec. 4.2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation==
In a study published in the ''Infant Mental Health Journal'', Naomi Goodz found that fathers tend to adhere more strictly to the “one person, one language model" than mothers.&lt;ref&gt;Goodz 1989, 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Even when parents reported strictly following a “one person, one language” scheme, [[naturalistic observation]]s found repeated instances of language mixing in both parents.&lt;ref&gt;De Houwer 1996, sec. 4.4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Masae Takeuchi conducted research on 25 [[Japanese people|Japanese]] mothers in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]] who were using the one person, one language approach to support their children's Japanese/English bilingual development.  Takeuchi found that consistency is the key to the success of the approach.  Most of the children in Takeuchi's study did not end up using Japanese actively after leaving school and only those children who were raised by mothers who consistently insisted on speaking only Japanese went on to use Japanese actively as adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Takeuchi|first=Maesae|title=The Japanese Language Development of Children through the 'One Parent-One Language' Approach in Melbourne|journal=The Journal of Multilingual and Multicultural Development|year=2006|volume=27|issue=4|pages=319–331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to semiotics:

'''[[Semiotics]]''' &amp;ndash; study of [[meaning-making]], signs and sign processes (semiosis), indication, designation, likeness, analogy, metaphor, symbolism, signification, and communication. Semiotics is closely related to the field of linguistics, which, for its part, studies the structure and meaning of language more specifically. Also called semiotic studies, or semiology (in the Saussurean tradition).

{{TOC limit|limit=2}}

== What ''type'' of thing is semiotics? ==

Semiotics can be described as all of the following:

* [[Academic discipline]] &amp;ndash; branch of knowledge that is taught and researched at the college or university level. Disciplines are defined (in part), and recognized by the academic journals in which research is published, and the learned societies and academic departments or faculties to which their practitioners belong.
* [[Social science]] &amp;ndash; field of study concerned with society and human behaviours.

== Branches of semiotics ==

=== Three main branches ===
* [[Semantics]] &amp;ndash; relation between signs and the things to which they refer; their ''denotata'', or [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]]
* [[Syntax|Syntactics]] &amp;ndash; relations among signs in formal structures
* [[Pragmatics]] &amp;ndash; relation between signs and the effects they have on the people who use them

=== Subfields ===
* [[Biosemiotics]] &amp;ndash; growing field that studies the production, action and [[Interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] of [[Sign (semiotics)|signs]] and [[code]]s in the [[Biology|biological]] realm. Biosemiotics attempts to integrate the findings of scientific biology and [[semiotics]], representing a [[Paradigm shift|paradigmatic shift]] in the [[Western world|occidental]] scientific view of [[life]], demonstrating that [[semiosis]] (sign process, including [[Meaning (semiotics)|meaning]] and interpretation) is its immanent and intrinsic feature.
* [[Cognitive semiotics]] &amp;ndash; study of meaning-making by employing and integrating methods and theories developed in the cognitive sciences as well as in the human sciences. It involves conceptual and textual analysis as well as experimental and ethnographic investigations.
* [[Computational semiotics]] &amp;ndash; attempts to engineer the process of [[semiosis]], in the study of and design for [[Human-Computer Interaction]], and mimic aspects of human [[cognition]] through [[artificial intelligence]] and [[knowledge representation]].
* [[Cultural semiotics]] &amp;ndash;
* [[Design semiotics]] &amp;ndash;
* [[Product semiotics]] &amp;ndash; study of the use of signs in the design of physical products. Introduced by [[Rune Monö]] while teaching Industrial Design at the Institute of Design, Umeå University, Sweden.
* [[Law and semiotics]] &amp;ndash;
* [[Semiotic literary criticism|Literary semiotics]] &amp;ndash; approach to literary criticism informed by the theory of signs or semiotics. Semiotics, tied closely to the structuralism pioneered by Ferdinand de Saussure, was extremely influential in the development of literary theory out of the formalist approaches of the early twentieth century.
* [[Music semiology]] &amp;ndash; "There are strong arguments that music inhabits a semiological realm which, on both ontogenetic and phylogenetic levels, has developmental priority over verbal language." (Middleton 1990, p.&amp;nbsp;172)  See Nattiez (1976, 1987, 1989), Stefani (1973, 1986), Baroni (1983), and ''Semiotica'' (66: 1–3 (1987)).
* [[Semiology (Gregorian Chant)|Gregorian chant semiology]] &amp;ndash; current avenue of [[palaeography|palaeographical]] research in [[Gregorian chant]] which is revising the [[Solesmes Abbey|Solesmes]] school of interpretation.
* [[Organisational semiotics]] &amp;ndash; examines the nature, characteristics and features of information, and studies how information can be best used in the context of organised activities and business domains. Organisational semiotics treats organisations as information systems in which information is created, processed, distributed, stored and used.
* [[Semiotic anthropology]] &amp;ndash; semiotics of Charles Sanders Peirce and Roman Jakobson applied to anthropology.
* [[Semiotic engineering]] &amp;ndash; views HCI as computer-mediated communication between designers and users at interaction time. The system speaks for its designers in various types of conversations specified at design time. These conversations communicate the designers' understanding of who the users are, what they know the users want or need to do, in which preferred ways, and why.
* [[Semiotic information theory]] &amp;ndash; considers the information content of signs and expressions as it is conceived within the semiotic or sign-relational framework developed by Charles Sanders Peirce.
* [[Social semiotics]] &amp;ndash; expands the interpretable semiotic landscape to include all cultural codes, such as in slang, fashion, and advertising. It considers social connotations, including meanings related to ideology and power structures, in addition to denotative meanings of signs.

'''Rakhaldas Bandyopadhyay''' (12 April 1885 – 23 May 1930), also known as '''R. D. Banerji''', was an [[Indian people|Indian]] [[historian]] and a native Indian pioneer in the fields of Indian archaeology, [[epigraphy]] and [[palaeography]]. He was the [[Manindra Chandra Nandy]] Professor of Ancient Indian History and Culture at the [[Banaras Hindu University]] from 1928–30. He is mostly known as the discoverer of [[Mohenjo-daro]], the principal site of the [[Harappa]] culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/banerji-robbed-of-credit-for-indus-findings/articleshow/59101966.cms|title='Banerji robbed of credit for Indus findings'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and background==
Bandyopadhyay was born on 12 April 1885 in [[Baharampur|Berhampore]] of [[Murshidabad District]] to Matilal and Kalimati. He passed his entrance examination from the [[Krishnath College School]] in Berhampore in 1900.. Soon he married Kanchanmala (1891–1931), the daughter of Narendranath Mukhopadhyay. He passed his F.A. examination in 1903 and graduated from [[Presidency College, Kolkata]] with Honours in History in 1907. He obtained his M.A. in History from the [[University of Calcutta|Calcutta University]] in 1911.
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.caluniv.ac.in/about/Teacher.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Bandyopadhyay joined the Indian museum in [[Calcutta]] as an Assistant to the Archaeological Section in 1910. He joined the [[Archaeological Survey of India]] as Assistant Superintendent in 1911, and was promoted to the rank of Superintending Archaeologist of the Western Circle in 1917. In 1924, he was transferred to the Eastern Circle and took part in the excavations at [[Somapura Mahavihara|Paharpur]]. He took voluntary retirement in 1926. After teaching at the [[University of Calcutta]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Some of our Distinguished Teachers: Rakhaldas Banerji|url=http://www.caluniv.ac.in/About%20the%20university/Distinguished%20Teacher.htm|date=|publisher=University of Calcutta|accessdate=29 July 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111121002802/http://caluniv.ac.in/About%20the%20university/Distinguished%20Teacher.htm|archivedate=21 November 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; he later joined the [[Banaras Hindu University]] in 1928 and held the post till his premature death on 23 May 1930.&lt;ref&gt;Sengupta, Subodh Chandra (ed.) (1988) ''Sansad Bangali Charitabhidhan'' (in Bengali), Kolkata: Sahitya Sansad, p.465&lt;/ref&gt;

Bandyopadhyay's first major independent professional work was in the fields of palaeography and epigraphy. He won the Jubilee Research Prize of the Calcutta University for ''The Origin of the Bengali Script'' published in 1919 (and reprinted in 1973). He was the first to study the [[Bengali language|proto-Bangla script]], the original form of Bangla script. He wrote the classic historical works on medieval [[Indian coinage|Indian coins]], and the standard works on the [[iconography]] of Indian art, in particular [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] sculpture and architecture. His best known work was ''Eastern Indian Medieval School of Sculpture,'' published posthumously in 1933.

===Discovery of Mohenjo-Daro===
Bandyopadhyay is popular for unearthing pre-Buddhist artefacts at the ruins at [[Mohenjo-Daro]]; for noting similarities between the site at Mohenjo-Daro and Harrappa. Those discoveries lead to excavations at the two sites that established the existence of the then-unknown [[Bronze Age]] [[Indus Valley Civilisation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Humes|first=Cynthia Ann|title=Hindutva, Mythistory, ; Pseudoarchaeology|journal=Numen. International Review for the History of Religions|volume=59|year=2012|jstor= 23244958|pages=178–201|doi=10.1163/156852712x630770}}&lt;/ref&gt; His interpretations of this civilisation were published in a number of articles and books: "An Indian City Five Thousand Years Ago" ; "Mohenjo-Daro" (in Bangla, Basumati, 1331 BS); ''Prehistoric, Ancient and Hindu India'' (posthumously published, 1934) and ''Mahenjo-Daro – A Forgotten Report''.

==Works==
Bandyopadhyay wrote two textbooks for Calcutta University, namely, ''History of India'' (1924) and ''A Junior History of India'' (1928). His ''The Age of the Imperial Guptas'' (1933) is a collection of lectures delivered by him in 1924. His standard two-volume ''Bangalar Itihas'' (History of Bengal) in [[Bengali language|Bengali]] (1914 and 1917) was one of the first attempts at writing a scientific history of Bengal. He also wrote two volumes on the history of Orissa, titled ''History of Orissa from the Earliest Times to the British Period'' (1930 and 1931).

His other significant non-fiction works include, ''Prachin Mudra'' (1915), ''The Palas of Bengal'' (1915), ''The Temple of Siva at Bhumara'' (1924), ''The Paleography of Hati Gumpha and Nanaghat Inscriptions'' (1924), ''Bas Reliefs of Badami'' (1928) and ''The Haihayas of Tripuri and their Monuments'' (1931).

Having published three novels, ''Pakshantar'' (1924), ''Byatikram'' (1924) and ''Anukram'' (1931), his other literary works in [[Bengali language]] were historical fictions. The setting of his ''Pashaner Katha'' (1914) is [[Kushana]] period. His three other novels, namely, ''Dhruba'', ''Karuna'' (1917) and ''Shashanka'' (1914) are set in the different phases of the [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] period. His ''Dharmapala'' (1915) narrates the story of the [[Pala Empire|Pala emperor]] [[Dharmapala]]. ''Mayukh'' (1916) describes the Portuguese atrocities in Bengal during the reign of [[Shahjahan]]. ''Asim'' (1924) narrates the condition of Bengal during the reign of [[Farrukhsiyar]]. His last novel, ''Lutf-Ulla'' is set in Delhi at the time of the invasion by [[Nadir Shah]]. Another fictional work, ''Hemkana'' (incomplete) was published in ''[[Prabasi]]'' magazine from 1911–12.&lt;ref&gt;Sen, Sukumar (1999). ''Bangala Sahityer Itihas'', Vol.V, Kolkata: Ananda Publishers, {{ISBN|81-7215-950-1}}, pp.210–11&lt;/ref&gt;  A number of his novels were translated into other Indian languages.

In computing, '''recursion termination''' is when certain conditions are met and a [[recursive algorithm]] stops calling itself and begins to return values. This happens only if, with every recursive call, the recursive algorithm changes its state and moves toward the base case. Cases that satisfy the definition, without being defined in terms of that definition, are called base cases. They are small enough to solve directly.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

===Fibonacci Function===
The [[Fibonacci function]](fibonacci(n)), which takes [[integer]] n(n &gt;= 0) as input, has three conditions

1. If n is 0, returns 0.&lt;br&gt;
2. If n is 1, returns 1.&lt;br&gt;
3. Otherwise, return [fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)]

This recursive function terminates if either conditions 1 or 2 are satisfied. We see that the function's recursive call reduces the value of n(by passing n-1 or n-2 in the function) ensuring that n reaches either condition 1 or 2.

If we look at an example of this in Python we can see what's going on a bit more clearly:
&lt;pre&gt;
def fibonacci (n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    elif n &gt; 1:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
int factorial(int number)  
{
	if (number == 0)
		return 1;
	else
		return (number * factorial(number - 1)); 
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
Here we see that in the recursive call, the number passed in the recursive step is reduced by 1. This again ensures that the number will at some point reduce to 0 which in turn terminates the recursive algorithm since we have our base case where we know that the factorial of 0 is 1 (or 0! = 1).

In the C programing language we could similarly do something like this:
&lt;pre&gt;
long factorial(int n)
{
  if (n == 0)
    return 1;
  else
    return(n * factorial(n-1));
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''Rosalie Ulrika Olivecrona''', [[née]] '''Roos''' (December 9, 1823&amp;nbsp;– June 4, 1898), was a [[Swedish people|Swedish]] [[feminist]] activist and writer. She is one of the three great pioneers of the organized [[women's rights]] movement in Sweden, alongside [[Fredrika Bremer]] and [[Sophie Adlersparre]].

== Biography ==
Rosalie Ulrika Roos was born into a wealthy family. She grew up in [[Stockholm]] and was among the first students at the ''[[Wallinska skolan|Wallinska flickskolan]]'' in Stockholm, one of the oldest girls' school in Sweden dating to 1831. The family moved in 1839 to Sjogeris at the foot of the mountainous plateau, [[:sv:Mösseberg|Mösseberg]] in [[Västergötland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://runeberg.org/nfck/0275.html ''Wallinska flickskolan'' (Nordisk familjebok / Uggleupplagan. 31. Ural – Vertex)]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of her friends, Hulda Hahr, was a teacher at a girls' school in Limestone, a town near [[Charleston, South Carolina]], United States, and offered her a position on the school. She traveled to the United States in 1851, and stayed there for four years. Roos was first a teacher of French at the school in Limestone, then she became a [[governess]] at the plantation of two of her students, Eliza and Annie Peronneau. She later wrote a description of her stay and of the culture of the American South. She did not notice any abuse of the slaves herself, but she considered [[slavery]] to be unnatural and "emotionally disgusting," and was convinced that its abolition was unavoidable, though it would meet with much resistance. She returned to Sweden in 1855.

In 1859, she founded the paper ''[[Tidskrift för hemmet]]'' ("Journal for the Home") in companionship with her friend Sophie Adlersparre with financial support of [[Fredrika Limnell]]. The paper was a feminist publication, which argued for women's rights, particularly the right to higher education and profession. They wrote many of the articles themselves. It was published in Stockholm from 1859 to 1885.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ub.gu.se/kvinn/digtid/02/ ''Tidskrift för hemmet'' (Göteborgs universitet)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1861, Roos and Adlersparre made a journey through Germany, France, England, Scotland and Ireland to compare the difference within the feminist movements, and reported that the movement was little known in Germany and France in comparison to Great Britain.

In 1864, she took part in the founding of ''Svenska Röda Korset'' (Swedish Red Cross) with Adlersparre, General Major Rudebeck, and Dr. Lemchen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redcross.se/om-oss/historik/ ''Svenska Röda Korsets historia'' (Svenska Röda Korset)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127011145/http://www.redcross.se/om-oss/historik/ |date=November 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In 1857 she married a widower, Swedish lawyer, statesman and professor, [[:sv:Knut Olivecrona|Knut Olivecrona]] (1817–1905). Olivecrona was professor of law at [[Uppsala University]] (1852–1867) and Rector of Uppsala University (1861–1862). He was Supreme Court Justice (1868–1889) and became a member of the [[International Court of Justice]] at [[The Hague]] from 1902.

Roos moved to [[Uppsala]] and became stepmother to her husband's son and three daughters.  Their marriage also produced a daughter and a son.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.igrin.co.nz/~hotchoc/SRKolive.htm ''Samuel Rudolf Detlof Knut Olivecrcrona'' (The Olivecrona Family)]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3564">:''This article is a technical mathematical article in the area of predicate logic.  For the ordinary English language meaning see [[Sentence (linguistics)]], for a less technical introductory article see [[Statement (logic)]].''

In [[mathematical logic]], a '''sentence''' of a [[predicate logic]] is a boolean-valued [[well-formed formula]] with no [[Free variables and bound variables|free variables]]. A sentence can be viewed as expressing a [[Proposition (mathematics)|proposition]], something that ''must'' be true or false.  The restriction of having no free variables is needed to make sure that sentences can have concrete, fixed [[truth value]]s: As the free variables of a (general) formula can range over several values, the truth value of such a formula may vary.

Sentences without any [[logical connective]]s or [[Quantifier (logic)|quantifiers]] in them are known as [[atomic sentence]]s; by analogy to [[atomic formula]]. Sentences are then built up out of atomic formulas by applying connectives and quantifiers.

A set of sentences is called a [[Theory (mathematical logic)|theory]]; thus, individual sentences may be called [[theorem]]s. To properly evaluate the truth (or falsehood) of a sentence, one must make reference to an [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] of the theory. For first-order theories, interpretations are commonly called [[structure (mathematical logic)|structures]]. Given a structure or interpretation, a sentence will have a fixed [[truth value]]. A theory is [[Satisfiability|satisfiable]] when it is possible to present an interpretation in which all of its sentences are true. The study of algorithms to automatically discover interpretations of theories that render all sentences as being true is known as the [[satisfiability modulo theories]] problem.

== Example ==

The following example in [[first-order logic]]
 
:&lt;math&gt;\forall y\exists x (x^2=y)&lt;/math&gt;

{{em|is}} a sentence. This sentence is true in the [[positive real numbers]] ℝ&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, false in the [[real numbers]] ℝ, and true in the [[complex number]]s ℂ. (In plain English, this sentence is interpreted to mean that every member of the structure concerned is the [[Square (algebra)|square]] of a member of that particular structure.) On the other hand, the formula

:&lt;math&gt;\exists x(x^2=y)&lt;/math&gt;

is {{em|not}} a sentence, because of the presence of the free variable ''y''. In the structure of the real numbers, this formula is true if we substitute (arbitrarily) ''y'' = 2, but is false if ''y'' = –2.  (It is the presence of a free variable, rather than the inconstant truth value, that matters; for example, even in the structure of the complex numbers, where the statement is always true, it is still not considered a sentence.)  Such a formula may be called a [[predicate (logic)|predicate]] instead.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4160">A '''total market coverage''', or TMC, is a piece of [[advertising]] that reaches all households in a market. Traditionally in most of North America newspapers provided total market coverage, as almost all households would subscribe to the main local paper. As subscription rates have fallen total market coverage products have emerged as a separate project, sometimes administered by newspapers, and sometimes separate businesses known as [[pennysaver]]s or shoppers.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Turow. ''Media Today: 5th Edition.'' Routledge, Oct 31, 2013 pg. 237&lt;/ref&gt;

Today many newspapers will distribute a supplement to free of charge to all households in the paper's [[Market (economics)|market]] or a specific portion or portions of the market.  Total Market Coverage products are meant to attract readers to [[subscribe]] or purchase copies of the main newspaper and also provide an additional outlet for [[advertisers]].  First appeared with the Dallas Morning News after long time employee Donald Ray Balser came up with the concept and led a large sales team which would become very successful. Some newspapers only deliver the TMC product to non-subscribers. This is accomplished using [[software]] that compares the newspaper's subscriber list to residential records, eliminating any duplicates. Some newspapers also choose to insert the TMC inside newspapers delivered to subscribers or sold at [[newsstands]]. TMCs are either mailed using special postal rates or delivered by newspaper carriers or motor route driver

Different newspapers take different approaches to TMC products.Some are quite simple and even border on low-quality, while others are quite complex. Typically, a TMC product is rather small - perhaps 4 to 12 pages frequently with several pre-printed inserts. Many newspapers use [[print syndication|syndicated]] news stories to fill these pages,  But sometimes it is just a mailer with ads and no content. Some newspapers choose to focus on entertainment news while others include local or national news. However, most of the content is either syndicated or reprinted from the main newspaper; very rarely will a newspaper generate original content for a TMC product.
Common names for TMC products include "Extra", "MVP" and "Plus". Often the newspaper will tack on one of these words to its main publication's title and use that as its name. For example, the Anytown Tribune might call its TMC product the "Anytown Tribune Plus" or "Anytown Tribune Extra." On the other hand, some newspapers develop entirely different names for their TMC products and may exclude or downplay their own name for fear their name might strike a negative chord with non-subscribers.

TMC products often feature special [[promotion (marketing)|promotion]]s aimed specifically at non-subscribers, offering special rates for subscribing or other special offers. Most newspapers sell advertising in the TMC product. Usually businesses who advertise in the main publication can add an advertisement in the TMC product for a small additional fee, often just a few dollars per [[column inch]], or purchase an advertisement just in the TMC.

TMCs were quite popular in the newspaper industry for several years and were seen as an innovative way to reach non-subscribers (and to offer services that compete with direct mail companies). However, some newspapers have begun questioning the effectiveness of TMCs and are doing away with them or cutting back significantly.  Many residents dislike TMC products because of their low quality and the fact they don't wish to have any newspaper delivered to their homes. Often these residents call newspapers and ask the product not be delivered to their home. Most newspapers will honor this request. Another problem with delivering a TMC product is, because of their small size, they can easily blow away in the wind, especially if the intended recipients don't bring them inside. There have been some cases of newspapers being accused of [[litter|littering]] as a result of TMC products being found scattered around outdoors.

'''Ulf Lundell''' (born 20 November 1949 in [[Södermalm]], Stockholm, Sweden, full name ''Ulf Gerhard Lundell'') is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] writer, poet, songwriter, composer, musician and artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/322466-Ulf-Lundell|title=Ulf Lundell|publisher=Discogs|accessdate=22 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He made his debut in 1975 with the LP ''[[Vargmåne]]'' and was immediately hailed as "Sweden's [[Bob Dylan]]". In 1976 his first novel, the partly autobiographical ''Jack'' was published by [[Wahlström &amp; Widstrand]]. Lundell was influenced by musicians such as Bob Dylan, [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Neil Young]] and writers such as [[Jack Kerouac]], [[Allen Ginsberg]] and other [[beat generation|beat]]s. Ulf Lundell is one of the central figures in Swedish rock music and almost since his debut he has been one of the most important influences on rock musicians writing and singing in Swedish. Lundell is also somewhat controversial and has argued with everyone from [[neo-nazi]]s, feminists and communists to colleagues and music journalists.

Lundell was known as a heavy drinker in the 1980s, but pulled out of overdrinking after serious bouts with alcoholism in 1985–87; he gave a vivid report of this time, his recovery and his struggle with the rocker myth in the autobiographical novel ''En varg söker sin flock'' (1989; "A Wolf in Search of his Pack")

"[[Öppna landskap]]" (Open landscapes) from 1982, one of his most famous songs, has been playfully proposed as Sweden's new [[national anthem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|EPIhSiZ2IJw}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
=== Origins and musical beginnings ===
Ulf Lundell's father was Gerhard Lundell a blacksmith worker and mother Ingrid (née Lindström) worked among other things as school meal assistant and seamstress. The family first lived in Stockholm in 1958 but moved to [[Saltsjö-Boo]], east of Stockholm. At the age of ten he got his first guitar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ulflundell.com/biografi.jsp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-08-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706165552/http://www.ulflundell.com/biografi.jsp |archivedate=2010-07-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lundell has an older sister named Inger, whose boyfriend taught him his first chords. During the years 1967–75 had Ulf Lundell had a variety of jobs, including postman. During these years he wrote songs and poems which he sent to record labels and publishers.

He sent a demo to [[MNW Music|MNW]] which they declined, telling him "the material was not strong enough". Later he sent two demos to [[Silence]], which were also rejected. When he sent a demo to [[EMI]] in October 1974 they wanted to record an LP with him. In 1975 he made his debut with the album ''[[Vargmåne]]'' (''Wolf Moon''). The following year, 1976, came his first novel, ''Jack'', with which he made his breakthrough. The novel is about rebellion against "medelsvensson" ([[Average Joe]]s) circumscribed life in the aftermath of the political uprising at the end of the 1960s. The book had an initial print run of 2,000 copies but ultimately sold 200,000 copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|EPIhSiZ2IJw}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, when his first work was released, he had already started recording the sequel to ''Vargmåne''. The second album would be called Törst (''Thirst'') and released just three months after ''Jack''. After that floated on the writing of books and two more were released during the 1970s. ''Törst'' was followed by the live album ''Natten hade varit mild och öm'' (''The night was mild and tender'') with Nature as backing band for years. The album ''Nådens år'' (''Year of Grace'') in 1978 year would become his third studio album including a duet with [[Agnetha Fältskog]], "Snön faller och vi med den" ("Snow Falls And We With It"). In 1979 Lundell released his fourth studio album ''Ripp rapp'' with songs like "Rom i regnet" and "(Oh la la) Jag vill ha dej". ''Ripp rapp'' was more rock than his previous albums.

=== 1980s ===
In the fall of 1980 Lundell released the album ''[[Längre inåt landet]]'', which was recorded in England. The album includes songs like "Glad igen" ("Happy Again") and "Stackars Jack" ("Poor Jack"). The latter was a comment on the criticism Lundell got from his debut novel ''Jack''. Two years later, in 1982, he released the album "[[Kär och galen]]" (''In love and crazy'') that contained his most famous work, the song "Öppna landskap" ("Open landscapes"). It made him one of the biggest artists, and sold four times platinum. Other songs that became popular from ''Kär och galen'' was the title track "Kär och galen" and "När jag kysser havet" ("When I kiss the sea").

While waiting for a proper sequel to ''Kär och galen'' Lundell released two records, one in which he interpreted the English songs with Swedish lyrics (''[[Sweethearts (Lundell album)|Sweethearts]]'') and a completely acoustic album (''12 sånger''). Ulf wrestled with severe alcohol problems during this time, which among other things, led to the postponing of his upcoming album several times. During the summer tour in 1985, he did a real disastrous gig in Borgholm drunk, which put him on some headlines in the newspapers. In the fall Lundell released ''Den vassa eggen'' (''The Sharp Edge''), an album heavily influenced by the divorce Lundell went through at the time of recording. ''Den vassa eggen'' was very critically acclaimed and was followed by yet another scandal tour in the fall of that year. In 1987 Lundell released the only book Lundell acknowledged writing intoxicated, ''Tårpilen'' and also the album ''Det ljuva livet'' (''The Good Life'').

Lundell alcohol abuse got so bad that he joined [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] at this time. 1988 he stated that he had met God and was baptized shortly thereafter in the Ebeneser Church. His newfound Christian faith came to color in the album ''Evangeline'', which was released the same year. 1989 he released his autobiography ''En varg söker sin flock'' ("A Wolf in Search of his Pack")  and the album ''Utanför murarna'' (''Outside the Walls''). He has also been active as a visual artist from 1989.

===1990s-present ===
[[File:Lundell-sthlm-2010.jpg|thumb | 140px | left | Lundell signing ''En öppen vinter'', Stockholm 2010.]] 
It took until 1992 for Lundell to release a new book or album with the novel ''Saknaden''. The book came to be the first installment of a trilogy. 1993 he released the album ''[[Måne över Haväng]]'', which contains songs that include ''Rött'' and ''Isabella''. This was the first album that Lundell produced entirely by himself. 1994 he formed his own production company ''Rockhead Studios AB'' and its subsidiaries ''Rockhead Productions'' and ''Rockhead Art'' and secondary name ''Rockhead Music''. That same year he released the acoustic album ''[[Xavante (album)|Xavante]]''. At this time Lundell invested more in music than on writing.

In 1995 Lundell celebrated 20 years as an artist. The following year he released double album ''[[På andra sidan drömmarna]]'' and the live album ''Bosnia''. At this time one can notice that he was inspired more by [[Neil Young]] than before Springsteen and Dylan. Especially with the album ''[[Fanzine (album)|Fanzine]]'' (1999), which is a disc that is partially recorded in a studio and partly live. 1999 he released his first book in seven years, the sequel to the novel ''Saknaden'', called ''Friheten''.

The album ''[[I ett vinterland]]'' (2000) became his second best-selling album. The album was followed two years later with the double album ''[[Club Zebra]]'', an album that was number one in Sweden October 17, 2002. Then followed four studio albums until 2005, the acoustic ''[[En eld ikväll]]'' and album trilogy ''[[Ok Ok Baby]]'', ''[[Högtryck]]'' and ''[[Lazarus (Ulf Lundell album)|Lazarus]]''. 2005 was a very productive year for Lundell with two albums and the novel ''[[Värmen]]'', the last part of a trilogy with ''Saknaden'' and ''Friheten''. This was the year he celebrated 30 years as an artist.

In the autumn of 2008, Lundell toured for the first time in over two years and also released his first studio album in three years. During the tour premiere of Gävle Lundell told the newspapers he was about to stop touring. The tour continued in 2009 with one in the spring and one in the summer. In connection with these he admits that he lied and will not stop touring. He explains that he is about to take farewell from his artistic career, but it's a long farewell. 2010 Lundell released a new book, ''[[En öppen vinter]]'', also containing a CD with 11 new songs.

In the summer of 2010, Lundell another new tour in which he broke the audience record for a Swedish artist at Gröna Lund July 30. Audience numbers were 22 827 people and with that figure, he is only beaten by [[Bob Marley]] (32 000) and [[Lady Gaga]] (23 000).

A concert tour that would have been implemented in the spring of 2011 was completely cancelled due to sickness.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aftonbladet.se/nojesbladet/article12475981.ab&lt;/ref&gt;

. They broke up in 1988. The year later, 1989, Lundell married Fredrika Stjärne, they broke up in 1991. He has three children from his first marriage, including the journalist [[Sanna Lundell]], and one from the other. During the mid-1990s, he was dating the poet Isabella Nerman (whom he also wrote a song about, simply called "Isabella"). During a period in the 2000s he was living with Ulrika Rickfors.
