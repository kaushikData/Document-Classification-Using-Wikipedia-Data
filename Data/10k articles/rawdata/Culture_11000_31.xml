The '''Carolina Abecedarian Project''' was a [[Scientific control|controlled]] [[experiment]] that was conducted in 1972 in [[North Carolina]], [[United States]], by the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|Frank Porter Graham Child Development Institute]] to study the potential benefits of [[early childhood education]] for poor children to enhance school readiness. It has been found that in their earliest school years, poor children lag behind others, suggesting the fact that they were ill-prepared for schooling. &lt;ref&gt;Alexander, K. L., &amp; Entwisle, D. R. (1988). Achievement in the first 2 years of school: Patterns and processes. Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development, 53 (Serial No. 218)&lt;/ref&gt; The Abecedarian project was inspired by the fact that few other early childhood programs could provide a sufficiently well-controlled environment to determine the effectiveness of early childhood training.

==Overview==
The participants in this experiment were 111 infants born between 1972 and 1977. Of these, 57 were given high-quality intervention, consisting in part of educational games based on the latest in educational theory. The other 54 acted as a control group. An overwhelming majority (98 percent) of the children who participated in the experiment were [[African-American]]. The average starting age of participants was 4.4 months.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.childtrends.org/Lifecourse/programs/CarolinaAbecedarianProgram.htm Child Trends: Guide to Effective Programs for Children and Youth] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060712144221/http://www.childtrends.org/Lifecourse/programs/CarolinaAbecedarianProgram.htm |date=July 12, 2006 }}, Child Trends 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas other childhood programs started at age two, the Abecedarian Project started from [[infancy]] and continued for five years, a period longer than most other programs. The participants received child care for 6&amp;ndash;8 hours a day, five days a week. Educational activities were game-based and emphasized language. The control group was provided with [[nutritional supplement]]s, [[Social work|social services]], and [[health care]] to ensure that these factors did not affect the outcomes of the experiment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.childtrends.org/Lifecourse/programs/CarolinaAbecedarianProgram.htm Ramey &amp; Campbell, 1991] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060712144221/http://www.childtrends.org/Lifecourse/programs/CarolinaAbecedarianProgram.htm |date=July 12, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; All the 111 infants were identified as "high risk" based on maternal education (which was on average 10th grade), family income, and other factors. The teacher-child ratio was low. It ranged from 1:3 for infants to 1:6 at age 5.&lt;ref name=Kaufman2009&gt;IQ Testing 101, Alan S. Kaufman, 2009, Springer Publishing Company, {{ISBN|0-8261-0629-3}} {{ISBN|9780826106292}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significant findings==
Follow-up assessment of the participants involved in the project has been ongoing.  So far, outcomes have been  measured at ages 3, 4, 5, 6.5, 8, 12, 15, 21, and 30.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Pungello, Miller-Johnson, Burchinal, &amp; Ramey, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; The areas covered were [[Cognition|cognitive functioning]], academic skills, [[educational attainment]], [[employment]], [[parenting|parenthood]], and social adjustment. The significant findings of the experiment were as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061024015049/http://www.fpg.unc.edu/~abc/summary.cfm The Carolina Abecedarian Project], 2006-10-24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://evidencebasedprograms.org/wordpress/?page_id=70 evidencebasedprograms.org - Coalition for Evidence-Based Policy: Social Programs that work: Abecedarian Project], 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Impact of child care/preschool on reading and math achievement, and cognitive ability, at age 21:

* An increase of 1.8 grade levels in reading achievement
* An increase of 1.3 grade levels in math achievement
* A modest increase in Full-Scale IQ (4.4 points), and in Verbal IQ (4.2 points).

Impact of child care/preschool on life outcomes at age 21:

* Completion of a half-year more of education
* Much higher percentage enrolled in school at age 21 (42 percent vs. 20 percent)
* Much higher percentage attended, or still attending, a 4-year college (36 percent vs. 14 percent)
* Much higher percentage engaged in skilled jobs (47 percent vs. 27 percent)
* Much lower percentage of teen-aged parents (26 percent vs. 45 percent)
* Reduction of criminal activity

Statistically significant outcomes  at age 30:

*Four times more likely to have graduated from a four-year college (23 percent vs. 6 percent)
*More likely to have been employed consistently over the previous two years (74 percent vs. 53 percent)
*Five times less likely to have used public assistance in the previous seven years (4 percent vs. 20 percent)
*Delayed becoming parents by average of almost two years

(Most recent information from Developmental Psychology, January 18, 2012, cited in uncnews.unc.edu, January 19, 2012)

The project concluded that high quality, educational child care from early infancy was therefore of utmost importance.

Other, less intensive programs, notably the [[Head Start Program]], but also others, have not been as successful. It may be that they provided too little too late compared with the Abecedarian program.&lt;ref name=Kaufman2009/&gt;

==Cost==

The total per-child cost of the project was ~$67,225, or ~$13,900 for each of the five years (2002 dollars); Masse &amp; Barnett 2002 estimated that the total annual cost of a comparable program for all poor children in 2002 would have been ~$3 billion.

==Criticisms==

Some researchers have advised caution about the reported positive results of the project. Among other things, they have pointed out analytical discrepancies in published reports, including unexplained changes in sample sizes between different assessments and publications. [[Herman Spitz]] has noted that a mean cognitive ability difference of similar magnitude to the final difference between the intervention and control groups was apparent in cognitive tests already at age six months, indicating that "4 1/2 years of massive intervention ended with virtually no effect." Spitz has suggested that the IQ difference between the intervention and control groups may have been latently present from the outset due to faulty randomization.&lt;ref&gt;Baumeister, A.A., &amp; Bacharach, V.R. (2000). [http://libres.uncg.edu/ir/asu/f/Bacharach_V_2000_Early_Generic_Educational_Intervention.pdf Early Generic Educational Intervention Has No Enduring Effect On Intelligence and Does Not Prevent Mental Retardation: The Infant Health and Development Program.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301175655/http://libres.uncg.edu/ir/asu/f/Bacharach_V_2000_Early_Generic_Educational_Intervention.pdf |date=March 1, 2014 }} ''Intelligence, 28,'' 161–192.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, it is known that randomization was compromised in the Abecedarian program, with seven families assigned to the experimental group and one family assigned to the control group dropping out of the program after learning about their random assignment.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell F.A., &amp; Ramey C.T. (1994). Effects of early intervention on intellectual and academic achievement: A follow-up study of children from low-income families. ''Child Development, 65,'' 684–698.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Americana Music Festival &amp; Conference''' is a music festival and music industry conference that takes place every year (usually in September).  The first was held in 2000.  It has since grown into a five-day multi-venue production. It is run by the [[Americana Music Association]] which is a professional not-for-profit trade organization whose mission is to promote awareness, provide a forum, and advocate for the creative and economic vitality of the [[Americana (music)|Americana music]] genre.&lt;ref name=AMA&gt;{{cite web|title=Americana Music Association|url=http://www.americanamusic.org|accessdate=18 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
The Americana Music Festival &amp; Conference is a five-day multi venue music festival and conference. All venues are located in or around downtown Nashville most within walking distance from the host hotel. In 2012, the event utilized nineteen different venues including The [[Ryman Auditorium]], [[Hard Rock Cafe]], and the [[SiriusXM]] theater at [[Bridgestone Arena]]. The host facility and hotel was the Sheraton Downtown Nashville Hotel.

The conference is held during the day.  Registrants can attend informative panel sessions that feature prominent artists and music executives from the Americana genre, the exhibit hall, free luncheons (that also feature performances), evening parties held by various sponsors, networking events, book signings, movie screenings and the occasional surprise event. Each night, showcases are held simultaneously at six different venues that feature various Americana artists and bands.  Fans are welcome to attend shows at one location or purchase a wristband to attend all four nights at any of the music venues. Shuttle buses are provided for conference registrants and wristband holders. The venues in 2012 were The Basement, The Rutledge, The Station Inn, Mercy Lounge, Cannery Ballroom and The High Watt.

The [[Americana Music Honors &amp; Awards|Americana Honors &amp; Awards show]] is held during the week of the Americana Music Festival &amp; Conference.  It takes place at the historic [[Ryman Auditorium]].  Tickets are included with the conference registration until the award show sells out.  The Americana Music Association urges people to sign up early so they will not miss out on the opportunity to attend.

Attendees have stated that the large event is a value.  In 2012, rates varied from $350 (early bird rate) to $500 (standard rate) for non-members. Members of the association received a $100 discount.

It started with ''[[Anaconda (film)|Anaconda]]'' in 1997.

Each installment revolves around giant [[man-eater|man-eating]] [[anaconda]]s  and the efforts of various groups of people to capture or destroy the creatures.

The '''anthropology of institutions''' is a sub-field in [[social anthropology]] dedicated to the study of [[institution]]s in different cultural contexts.

The role of anthropology in institutions has expanded significantly since the end of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Companion to Organizational Anthropology|last=Douglas|first=Caulkins|publisher=Wiley|year=2012|isbn=|location=Hoboken, N.J.|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Much of this development can be attributed to the rise in anthropologists working outside of academia and the increasing importance of [[globalization]] in both institutions and the [[Anthropology|field of anthropology]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Anthropologists can be employed by institutions such as [[Business|for-profit business]], [[Nonprofit organization|nonprofit organizations]], and [[Government|governments]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  For instance, [[Cultural anthropology|cultural anthropologists]] are commonly employed by the [[Federal government of the United States|United States federal government]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The two types of institutions defined in the field of anthropology are [[total institution]]s and social institutions.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199766567/obo-9780199766567-0156.xml#firstMatch|title=Institutions|last=Hejtmanek|first=Katie Rose|date=28 November 2016|website=Oxford Bibliographies|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Total institutions are places that comprehensively coordinate the actions of people within them, and examples of total institutions include [[Prison|prisons]], [[Convent|convents]], and [[Hospital|hospitals]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Social institutions, on the other hand, are constructs that regulate individuals’ day-to-day lives, such as [[kinship]], [[religion]], and [[economics]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Anthropology of institutions may analyze [[Trade union|labor unions]], businesses ranging from [[Small business|small enterprises]] to [[Corporation|corporations]], government, medical organizations,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[education]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Magolda|first=Peter M.|date=March 2000|title=The Campus Tour: Ritual and Community in Higher Education|url=|journal=Anthropology &amp; Education Quarterly|volume=31|pages=24–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; prisons,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cunha|first=Manuela|date=2014|title=The Ethnography of Prisons and Penal Confinement|url=|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|volume=43|pages=217–233}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rhodes|first=Lorna A.|date=2001|title=Toward an Anthropology of Prisons|url=|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|volume=30|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Financial institution|financial institutions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ho|first=Karen|date=2009|title=Liquidated: An Ethnography of Wall Street|url=|journal=Contemporary Sociology: A Journal of Reviews|volume=41|pages=739–747}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Non-governmental organization|Nongovernmental organizations]] have garnered particular interest in the field of institutional anthropology because they are capable of fulfilling roles previously ignored by governments,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fisher|first=William F.|date=|title=1997|url=|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|volume=26|pages=439}}&lt;/ref&gt; or previously realized by families or local groups, in an attempt to mitigate [[Social issue|social problems]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The types and methods of scholarship performed in the anthropology of institutions can take a number of forms.  Institutional anthropologists may study the relationship between organizations or between an organization and other parts of society.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Institutional anthropology may also focus on the inner workings of an institution, such as the relationships, [[Hierarchy|hierarchies]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;and cultures formed,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and the ways that these elements are transmitted and maintained, transformed, or abandoned over time.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Institutional Ethnography as Practice|last=Smith|first=Dorothy E.|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc.|year=2006|isbn=|location=Lanham, Maryland|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, some anthropology of institutions examines the specific design of institutions and their corresponding strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Levitsky|first=Steven|last2=Murillo|first2=Maria|date=2009|title=Variation in Institutional Strength|url=|journal=Annual Review of Political Science|volume=12|pages=115–133}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More specifically, anthropologists may analyze specific events within an institution, perform [[Semiotics|semiotic]] investigations, or analyze the mechanisms by which [[knowledge]] and [[culture]] are organized and dispersed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In all manifestations of institutional anthropology, participant [[observation]] is critical to understanding the intricacies of the way an institution works and the consequences of actions taken by individuals within it.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Verlot|first=Marc|date=2001|title=Are politics human? Problems and challenges of institutional anthropology|url=|journal=Social Anthropology|volume=9|pages=345–353}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Simultaneously, anthropology of institutions extends beyond examination of the commonplace involvement of individuals in institutions to discover how and why the organizational principles evolved in the manner that they did.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Common considerations taken by anthropologists in studying institutions include the physical location at which a researcher places themselves, as important interactions often take place in private, and the fact that the members of an institution are often being examined in their workplace and may not have much idle time to discuss the details of their everyday endeavors.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Network Inside Out|last=Riles|first=Annelise|publisher=The University of Michigan Press|year=2000|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ability of individuals to present the workings of an institution in a particular light or frame must additionally be taken into account when using [[Interview|interviews]] and [[Documentary analysis|document analysis]] to understand an institution,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; as the involvement of an anthropologist may be met with [[distrust]] when information being released to the public isn’t directly controlled by the institution and could potentially be damaging.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

'''Arts and letters''' is a traditional term for the [[fine arts]] and [[literature]] considered together. The category defined as "arts and letters" may also include the [[performing arts]], [[visual arts]], or [[liberal arts]].

==History==
By the late 19th century the term was used to name a few arts-related institutions in the [[United States]]. A [[subscription]]-based Theatre of Arts and Letters opened in [[New York City|New York]] in 1892, but closed within a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

| date=May 1963
| pages=136–142
| jstor=3204417
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]] was founded in 1904.

The term has also figured in [[higher education]]. For example, by 1889 students at [[Swarthmore College]] were sorted into two categories of study: "Arts and Letters" or "Science and Engineering."&lt;ref&gt;''Twenty-first Annual Catalogue of Swarthmore College, Swarthmore, Pa., 1889-90''. Philadelphia: Press of Friends' Book Association.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2010, course requirements at the University of Pennsylvania College of Arts and Sciences have included a "sector" (category) called "Arts and Letters." The college defines the sector as including "visual arts, literature and music, together with the criticism surrounding them."&lt;ref&gt;University of Pennsylvania College of Arts and Sciences, ''The College Curriculum''  http://www.college.upenn.edu/curriculum/2010/sectors.php, accessed 17 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bachelor of Music''' is an [[academic degree]] awarded by a [[college]], [[university]], or [[music school|conservatory]] upon completion of a program of study in [[music]]. In the United States, it is a [[professional degree]], and the majority of work consists of prescribed music courses and study in applied music, usually requiring proficiency in an instrument, voice, or conducting. In Canada, the B.M. is often considered an [[undergraduate]] degree. Programs typically last from three to four and a half years.

The degree may be awarded for [[performance]], [[music education]], [[musical composition|composition]], [[music theory]], [[musicology]] / [[music history]] (musicology degrees may be a [[Bachelor of Arts]] (B.A.) rather than a B.M.) [[music technology]], [[music therapy]], sacred music, music business/[[music industry]], entertainment, [[music production (music industry)|music production]] or [[jazz]] studies. In the 2010s, some universities have begun offering degrees in Music Composition with Technology, which include traditional theory and musicology courses and [[sound recording]] and composition courses using digital technologies.

In the United Kingdom, the Bachelor of Music is generally a [[undergraduate degree|first degree]] lasting three years (or four years in Scotland) and consisting of a wide range of areas of study (normally including performance, composition, music theory, musicology/music history), but at the [[University of Oxford]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.admin.ox.ac.uk/examregs/14-33_General_Regulations.shtml Regulations for the degrees of Bachelor and Doctor of Music] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081019042411/http://www.admin.ox.ac.uk/examregs/14-33_General_Regulations.shtml |date=2008-10-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[University of Cambridge]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cam.ac.uk/guide/summary/mus.html Bachelor of Music (MusB)]&lt;/ref&gt; it is a one-year [[postgraduate]] degree which can only be taken if a student is a graduate in music with [[Honors degree|honors]] at those universities; the undergraduate course is in the [[Faculty of Arts]] and leads to the Bachelor of Arts (and subsequently the [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge)]]).

==Abbreviations==
After a degree holder's name, as on a [[business card]] or a [[Curriculum vitae|CV]], the degree is abbreviated in various ways, including: B.M., BM, B.Mus, BMus, Mus.B, or Mus.Bac. Some recipients add an abbreviation for the name of the institution which granted the degree as well, e.g., "Susan Bhattara, B.Mus. (Oxon)"; ''Oxon'' being the Latin abbreviation for [[Oxford University]].

==Post-graduation options==
Graduates may apply for jobs in performance, teaching, or [[arts administration]]. As well, graduates can apply for jobs which require a bachelor's degree in every subject, such as some entry-level jobs in banking, insurance, sales, and administration. Graduates with an interest in teaching in the school system may go on to complete a [[teaching degree]] or diploma. Graduates who have achieved a high standard on their instrument, voice, or another specialization such as composition or conducting may be eligible to apply for a [[Master of Music]] (M.M.) if their grades are high enough (a B+ or A- average is typically required). B.M. graduates can also apply to a range of graduate programs outside of music, such as library science, [[business administration]] or [[public administration]]; a B+ or A- average is typically required. Some programs may require B.M. graduates to complete preparatory or make-up courses in the field of the master's. As well, some programs require the [[GRE]] or [[GMAT]] (standardized tests). B.M. graduates in some fields, such as composition, music theory, or musicology may be able to apply directly to [[Ph.D]] programs if they have a high average and strong recommendation letters.

The '''Biikebrennen''' (meaning "[[bonfire]]s" in [[Northern Low Saxon]]), '''Biikebrånen''' (in [[North Frisian language|North Frisian]]) or '''Pers Awten''' (meaning "[[Saint Peter]]'s Eve" in [[South Jutish]]) is an annual celebration held on 21 February in [[North Frisia]], in the [[Germany|German]] state of [[Schleswig-Holstein]] and in [[Southern Jutland]] in [[Denmark]].

At Biikebrennen, nearly all North Frisian towns, and many isolated farmhouses as well, light their own bonfires, known locally as ''biike'', at or shortly after sunset to bid winter farewell.

The origin of Biikebrennen is unclear. The meaning has changed over time. The ritual varies a little from island to island. But the tradition lives on.

[[File:Tim Hitchner July 2006.jpg|thumbnail|Tim Hitchner July 2006]]
'''''Brocket 99''''' is the name of an underground comedy [[Magnetic tape|audio tape]] that [[parody|parodies]] [[First Nations of Canada|aboriginal people in Canada]] and the name of two documentary films about the tape (one produced in 2005, and the other in production).

==1986 tape==
The parody played on numerous aboriginal [[stereotypes]] and has been characterized as [[racist]]. The tape included names of real people, stores and towns and is an "international underground phenomenon".&lt;ref name="cgyherald"&gt;{{cite news
  | last = Burroughs | first = Alexandra | title = Is it comedy or racism? Brocket 99 film raises big issues | pages = E4,E7 | publisher = Calgary Herald | date = 2005-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tape was created in 1986 by [[Disc jockey|radio DJ]]s in [[Lethbridge]], [[Alberta]], purportedly inspired by a clip of a parody of [[gay]] men running a radio station called "[[AIDS]] Radio".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
  | last = Beeber | first = Al | title = Brocket 99 documentary 'pretty provocative,' says filmmaker
  | publisher = Lethbridge Herald | date = 2006-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Brocket 99" tape was never made to be marketed and was meant as a parody.&lt;ref name="cgyherald" /&gt;

Brocket 99 Part 2 was recorded in 1986 but was released in 1989.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

The premise of the tape was a fictitious [[radio station]] broadcasting from [[Brocket, Alberta]], on the [[Northern Peigan]] reserve (a real reservation 70&amp;nbsp;km west of Lethbridge), hosted by a character named "Ernie Scar". It stereotypes natives as drunken bums, welfare recipients and drug addicts and uses pejorative terms to describe native men as "bucks" and native women as "[[squaw]]s".  Songs played on the tape included complete versions of multiple hits by artists such as [[AC/DC]] and [[Dwight Yoakam]], often in a row.  Between the songs and the DJ segments are fake ads for real products such as [[Dr. Scholl's]] foot powder and [[Lysol]] spray.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

The tape was created by '''Tim Hitchner ''', who worked as a radio DJ at [[CHLB-FM|CHEC]], [[CJBZ-FM|CKTA]], and [[CKIZ-FM]] from 1985 to 1992.&lt;ref name=ckiz&gt;{{cite web  | title = CKIZ 90.5 FM, Pincher Creek, Alberta | url = http://ckiz.ca/ | last = 90.5 FM | first = CKIZ | publisher = CKIZ 90.5 FM | date = 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tape was also created by Global News and Lethbridge City Council member Mark Campbell.

On February 6, 1989, the ''[[Court of Appeal of Alberta]]'' The crown submitted an appeal for the earlier acquittal of Hitchner by the honorable Mr. Justice Waite of the Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta the 5th Day of April, 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=R. v. Hitchner, 1989 ABCA 41 |url=https://caselaw.canada.globe24h.com/0/0/alberta/court-of-appeal/1989/02/06/r-v-hitchner-1989-abca-41.shtml |archive-url=https://archive.is/20141011043404/http://caselaw.canada.globe24h.com/0/0/alberta/court-of-appeal/1989/02/06/r-v-hitchner-1989-abca-41.shtml |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2014-10-11 |last=Hetherington |first=The Honourable Madam Justice |publisher=Court of Appeal of Alberta |date=1989-02-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 26, 1989, the ''[[Lethbridge Herald]]'' reported that Hitchner was sentenced to 15 months in jail after being found guilty of dangerous driving causing death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | title = City man given 15 months in jail beneath the hood | url = https://newspaperarchive.com/ca/alberta/lethbridge/lethbridge-herald/1989/10-26/ | last = Sullivan | first = Pat | publisher = Lethbridge Herald | date = 1989-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 14, 1995, the ''Herald'' first reported that the creator of Brocket 99 was Hitchner, the play's technical director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | title = Beef denounced in Yates play | url = https://newspaperarchive.com/ca/alberta/lethbridge/lethbridge-herald/1995/10-14/page-24 | last = Sullivan | first = Pat | publisher = Lethbridge Herald | date = 1995-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 12, 2011, a fan site reported the then anonymous actor who played Ernie Scar had died at age 49,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | title = ERNIE SCAR - 1961 - 2011 | url = http://brocket99.net/scar.htm | last = Anthony | first = Michael | publisher = brocket99.net | date = 2011-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; of a [[heart attack]] due to clogged arteries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | title = The Great Beyond | url = http://brocket99news.wordpress.com/2011/02/25/the-great-beyond/ | last = Kang | first = Chul-Su | publisher = brocket99news.wordpress.com | date = 2011-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; CKIZ's list of past employees on its website currently identifies Hitchner as the voice of Ernie Scar.&lt;ref name=ckiz /&gt;

On February 14, 2011, McInnis &amp; Holloway Funeral Homes posted the obituary of Hitchner, who died February 12, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | title = HITCHNER – Timothy (Tim) Craig | url = http://www.mhfh.com/hitchner-%E2%80%93-timothy-tim-craig/ | last = Hitchner | first = Family | publisher = McInnis &amp; Holloway Funeral Homes | date = 2011-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 28, 2012, the ''Lethbridge Herald'' reported the founder of Brocket 99 was Hitchner, who died February 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Students Say Brocket 99 Warrants Police Investigation |url=http://www.lethbridgeherald.com/front-page-news/students-say-brocket-99-tape-warrants-police-investigation-42812.html |last=Zentner |first=Caroline |publisher=Lethbridge Herald |date=2012-04-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509042819/http://www.lethbridgeherald.com/front-page-news/students-say-brocket-99-tape-warrants-police-investigation-42812.html |archivedate=May 9, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, filmmaker [[Nilesh Patel (filmmaker)|Nilesh Patel]] produced and directed a documentary called ''[[Brocket 99 — Rockin' the Country]]'', which examined the ongoing popularity of the tape.  Prior to the release of the documentary, Global TV interviewed Nilesh Patel in 2004 regarding the documentary and its purpose.  In this interview, Nilesh Patel discussed the creation of the documentary and accused Mark Campbell of being the creator of Brocket 99.  This was subsequently confirmed to be false due to the revelation of Tim Hitchner as the creator of Brocket 99 in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tybCPQZqdOA&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5072">[[File:Colombian copal.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A cylinder of Colombian Copal after the [[autoclave]] process]]'''"Caribbean  Amber"''' is a commercial name for artificially treated [[Colombia]]n [[copal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amerheritage.com/amberjewel.htm |title= What is it and who makes it? |accessdate=2009-09-25|year=2009|work=Amerheritage}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are no dates or specific geological information on [[Colombia]]n [[copal]]. Because of its color and hardness, some scientists believe it may be [[Pliocene]] or [[Pleistocene]], probably about 2 to 3 million years old, in some regions even up to 16 million years old{{cn|date=June 2017}}, but in others much, much younger (Santander) and may only count with some thousands, or some hundreds of years. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fossilmuseum.net/Tree_of_Life/FossilAmber.htm|title=Fossil Amber or Fossil Resin |accessdate=2017-06-02|work=FossilMuseum.net - Tree of Life - Fossil Amber}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, in its natural form it is relatively soft (Mohs 1 – 1.5).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gplatt.demon.co.uk/properti.htm |title=Properties of Amber |accessdate=2009-09-24 |last=Platt |first=Garry |year=1997 |work=Garry Platt Amber Home |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090917010323/http://www.gplatt.demon.co.uk/properti.htm |archivedate=2009-09-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  But the desired appearance and behavior is that of the geologically older [[Dominican amber]].  The copal is modified by [[autoclave]] (see description below). Even though the process is similar to modifications or enhancements applied to some [[Baltic amber]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefossilforum.com/index.php?/topic/40072-baltic-amber-autoclave-treatment/ |title=Baltic Amber - Autoclave Treatment |accessdate=2017-06-02 |last= Hoffeins|first=Christel|year=2012|work=Polish Journal of Entomoloqy}}&lt;/ref&gt;, it is sometimes considered considered an "amber imitation" due to its young age. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amber.com.pl/eng/amber/amber_imitations_copal.php |title=''Amber Imitations'' -- Copal|accessdate=2009-09-24 |last=Gierlowska|first=Gabriela|work=Bursztynowy Portal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jckonline.com/article/282742-Caribbean_Green_Amber.php |title= Caribbean Green Amber |accessdate=2009-09-24 |last=Roskin|first=Gary|year=2006|work=JCK Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Autoclave process ==
In the copal hardening process, the resin is wrapped in [[aluminum foil]], then treated in the [[autoclave]] for several hours, increasing the temperature, pressure and heating time. Green or other colors are obtained by adding water at each stage of the process. After the copal has hardened, the aluminum foil is removed and the hardened [[resin]] is cut to produce the desired shape (i.e. bead or cabochon). It is then mixed with [[talcum]] and heated again in the autoclave. Thereafter, it can  be cut and polished to obtain the desired finish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jckonline.com/article/282742-Caribbean_Green_Amber.php |title= Caribbean Green Amber |accessdate=2009-09-24 |last=Roskin|first=Gary|year=2006|work=JCK Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Amber from the Caribbean ==
[[File:Verde dominicana1.jpg|thumbnail|Dominican Green Amber, natural without enhancement]]
Although there is also copal found in some parts of the [[Dominican Republic]], ([[Cotui]] area), most of the Dominican [[retinite]] is the older [[Dominican Amber]].  The Dominican Republic is the only island in the Caribbean where amber has been discovered and is mined. Dominican amber is found in a range of colors, among them [[fluorescent]] green and [[Blue Amber|blue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1063/1.1829395  |title=The origin of the blue fluorescence in Dominican amber |last=L.

In [[Culture of China|Chinese tradition]], a '''ghost marriage''' ({{zh|c=冥婚|p='''mínghūn'''|l='''spirit marriage'''}}) is a marriage in which one or both parties are deceased.&lt;ref name="noteStockard"&gt;[[#Reference-idStockard 1989|Stockard, Janice E. ''Daughters of the Canton Delta'']]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|99}} Other forms of ghost marriage are practiced worldwide, from Sudan, to France since 1959 (see [[Levirate marriage]], [[Ghost marriage (Sudanese)|Ghost marriage in Sudan]] and [[Posthumous marriage]]). The origins of Chinese ghost marriage are largely unknown, and reports of it being practiced today can be found.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ettoday.net/news/20151106/592314.htm|title=一個人的婚禮…女友過世男辦冥婚|date=6 November 2015|access-date=14 February 2016|website=東森新聞|publisher=東森新聞网}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Chinese ghost marriage was usually set up by the family of the deceased and performed for a number of reasons, including the marriage of an engaged couple before one member's death,&lt;ref name="Topley, Marjorie 1955"&gt;[[#Reference-idTopley1955|Topley, Marjorie. "Ghost Marriages Among the Singapore Chinese"]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|29}} to integrate an unmarried daughter into a patrilineage,&lt;ref name="noteStockard"/&gt;{{rp|82}} to ensure the family line is continued,&lt;ref name="Topley, Marjorie 1955"/&gt;{{rp|29}} or to maintain that no younger brother is married before an elder brother.&lt;ref name="Topley, Marjorie 1955"/&gt;{{rp|29}}

===Previously engaged===
Upon the death of her fiancé, a bride could choose to go through with the wedding, in which the groom was represented by a white cockerel at the ceremony.&lt;ref name="Topley, Marjorie 1955"/&gt;{{rp|29}} However, some women were hesitant since this form of ghost marriage required her to participate in the funeral ritual, mourning customs (including strict dress and conduct standards), take a vow of [[Sexual abstinence|celibacy]],&lt;ref name="Topley, Marjorie 1955"/&gt;{{rp|29}} and immediately take up residence with his family.&lt;ref name="noteStockard"/&gt;{{rp|91}} A groom had the option of marrying his late fiancée, with no disadvantages, but there have been no records of such weddings.&lt;ref name="Topley, Marjorie 1955"/&gt;{{rp|29}}

===Women and ghost marriage===

====Providing a deceased daughter with a patrilineage====
When it comes to death customs, an unmarried Chinese woman has no [[Kinship|descendants]] to worship her or care for her as part of a lineage.&lt;ref name="noteMartin1973"&gt;[[#Reference-idMartin1973|Martin, Emily Ahern. ''The Cult of the Dead in a Chinese Village'']]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|127}} In every household, an [[altar]] is prominently displayed with the [[spirit tablet]]s of the paternal ancestors and the images of the gods. A married woman's tablet is kept at the altar of her husband's family.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idFreedman1970|Freedman, Maurice. ''Family and Kinship in Chinese Society'']] p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; However, should a woman of eligible age pass away unmarried, her family is prohibited from placing her tablet on the altar of her natal home.&lt;ref name="noteStockard"/&gt;{{rp|83}} Instead, she will be "given a temporary paper tablet, placed not on the domestic altar but in a corner near the door."&lt;ref name="noteStockard"/&gt;{{rp|83}} Hence, the important duty of Chinese parents in marrying off their children&lt;ref name="ikels"&gt;[[#Reference-idIkels1985|Ikels, Charlotte. "Parental Perspectives on the Significance of Marriage."]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|254}} becomes increasingly important for their daughters. Since women are only able to acquire membership in descent lines through marriage,&lt;ref name="Wolf, Arthur P."&gt;[[#Reference-idWolf1978|Wolf, Arthur P. ''Studies in Chinese Society'']]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|148}} ghost marriage became a viable solution to ensure that unmarried, deceased daughters still had "affiliation to a male descent line"&lt;ref name="noteStockard"/&gt;{{rp|82}} and could be appropriately cared for after death.

Another death custom concerning an unmarried daughter prohibited her from dying in her natal home. Instead, a temple or "Death House"&lt;ref name="noteStockard"/&gt;{{rp|82}} for [[spinster]]s was built or families take their daughter to a shed, empty house, or outlying buildings to die.&lt;ref name="noteStockard"/&gt;{{rp|82}}

====Living, unmarried daughters====
{{see also|Spirit tablet|Veneration of the dead|Chinese folk religion}}
Not only did the Chinese customs concerning death greatly burden the family, but an unmarried daughter became a source of great embarrassment and concern. In Charlotte Ikels "Parental Perspectives on the Significance of Marriage" she reports, "Traditionally, girls who did not marry were regarded as a threat to the entire family and were not allowed to continue living at home. Even in contemporary Hong Kong, I was told that unmarried women are assumed to have psychological problems. Presumably no normal person would remain unmarried voluntarily."&lt;ref name="ikels"/&gt;{{rp|254}} For girls who choose to remain unmarried, "bride-initiated spirit marriage" (or a ghost marriage initiated by a living bride) was a successful "marriage-resistance practice"&lt;ref name="noteStockard"/&gt;{{rp|92}} that allowed them to remain single while still being integrated into a lineage. However, it did come with some negative connotations, being called a "fake spirit-marriage" or referred to as "marrying a spirit tablet", and a way to avoid marriage.&lt;ref name="noteStockard"/&gt;{{rp|92–93}}

===Continuing the family line===
If a son died before marriage, his parents arranged a ghost marriage to provide him with [[Offspring|progeny]] to continue the lineage and give him his own descendants.&lt;ref name="noteBall"&gt;[[#Reference-idBall1904|Ball, J. Dyer. ''Things Chinese: or Notes Connected with China'']] pp. 419-420. As quoted by Baker, Hugh D. R. ''Chinese Family and Kinship'' pp. 42-43.&lt;/ref&gt; "A man in China does not marry so much for his own benefit as for that of the family: to continue the family name; to provide descendants to keep up the ancestral worship; and to give a daughter-in-law to his mother to wait on her and be, in general, a daughter to her."&lt;ref name="noteBall"/&gt; Occasionally, a live woman is taken as a wife for a dead man, but this is rare.&lt;ref name="Topley, Marjorie 1955"/&gt;{{rp|29}} The ceremony itself took on characteristics of both a marriage and a funeral, with the spirit of the deceased bride being "led" by a medium or priest, while her body is transferred from her grave to be laid next to her husband.&lt;ref name="Topley, Marjorie 1955"/&gt;{{rp|29}}

If the family was "suitably rich to tempt a [living] girl,"&lt;ref name="Topley, Marjorie 1955"/&gt;{{rp|29}} the ghost marriage might profit them with the asset of having a daughter-in-law. Since a daughter is not considered "a potential contributor to the lineage into which she is born," but rather "it is expected that she will give the children she bears and her adult labor to the family of her husband,"&lt;ref name="noteMartin1973"/&gt;{{rp|127}} the wife of a deceased son would benefit her husband's family by becoming a caregiver in their home.&lt;ref name="ikels"/&gt;{{rp|255}}

Once the deceased son had a wife, the family could adopt an heir, or a "grandson",&lt;ref name="Topley, Marjorie 1955"/&gt;{{rp|29}} to continue on the family line. The purpose of the daughter-in-law was not to produce offspring, as she was to live a chaste life, but she became the "social instrument" to enable the family to adopt.&lt;ref name="noteStockard"/&gt;{{rp|100}} The family preferred to adopt patrilineally related male kin,&lt;ref name="noteStockard"/&gt;{{rp|95}} usually through a brother assigning one of his own sons to the lineage of the deceased.&lt;ref name="noteWolfHuang"&gt;[[#Reference-idWolfHuang1980|Wolf, Arthur P. and Huang, Chieh-Shan. ''Marriage and Adoption in China, 1845-1945'']] p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; The adoption was carried out by writing up a contract, which was then placed under the dead man's tablet.&lt;ref name="noteWolfHuang"/&gt; As an adopted son, his duties were to make ancestral offerings on his birth and death dates, and he was additionally "entitled to inherit his foster father's share of the family estate."&lt;ref name="noteWolfHuang"/&gt;

===Requests from the afterworld===
Ghost marriages are often set up by request of the spirit of the deceased, who, upon "finding itself without a spouse in the other world,"&lt;ref name="Topley, Marjorie 1955"/&gt;{{rp|29}} causes misfortune for its natal family, the family of its betrothed,&lt;ref name="Topley, Marjorie 1955"/&gt;{{rp|29}} or for the family of the deceased's married sisters.&lt;ref name="noteJordan"&gt;[[#Reference-idJordan1972|Jordan, David K. ''Gods, Ghosts, and Ancestors.'']]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|141}} "This usually takes the form of sickness by one or more family members. When the sickness is not cured by ordinary means, the family turns to divination and learns of the plight of the ghost through a séance."&lt;ref name="noteJordan"/&gt;{{rp|141}}

More benignly, a spirit may appear to a family member in a dream and request a spouse. Marjorie Topley, in "Ghost Marriages Among the Singapore Chinese: A Further Note," relates the story of one 14-year-old Cantonese boy who died. A month later he appeared to his mother in a dream saying that he wished to marry a girl who had recently died in Ipoh, Perak. The son did not reveal her name; his mother used a Cantonese spirit medium and "through her the boy gave the name of the girl together with her place of birth and age, and details of her horoscope which were subsequently found to be compatible with his."&lt;ref name="Topley, Marjorie 1956"&gt;[[#Reference-idTopley1956|Topley, Marjorie. "Ghost Marriages Among the Singapore Chinese: A Further Note."]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|71}}

===Other instances of ghost marriage===
Because Chinese custom dictates that younger brothers should not marry before their elder brothers, a ghost marriage for an older, deceased brother may be arranged just before a younger brother's wedding to avoid "incurring the disfavour of his brother's ghost."&lt;ref name="Topley, Marjorie 1956"/&gt;{{rp|29}}
Additionally, in the days of immigration, ghost marriages were used to "cement a bond of friendship between two families."&lt;ref name="Topley, Marjorie 1956"/&gt;{{rp|30}} However, there have been no recent cases reported.&lt;ref name="Topley, Marjorie 1956"/&gt;{{rp|30}}

==Arrangement==
If a family wishes to arrange a ghost marriage, they may consult with a [[matchmaking|matchmaker]] of sorts: In a Cantonese area of Singapore "there is in fact a ghost marriage broker's sign hung up in a doorway of a Taoist priest's home. The broker announces that he is willing to undertake the search for a family which has a suitable deceased member with a favourable horoscope."&lt;ref name="Topley, Marjorie 1956"/&gt;{{rp|29}}

Others do not use the aid of any priest or diviner and believe that the groom the ghost-bride has chosen "[will] somehow identify himself."&lt;ref name="noteMartin1973"/&gt;{{rp|236}} Typically, the family lays a red envelope (usually used for gifts of money) as bait in the middle of the road. They then take to hiding, and when the envelope is picked up by a passer-by, they come out and announce his status of being the chosen bridegroom.&lt;ref name="noteJordan"/&gt;{{rp|140}}

===Dowries and bridewealth===
The exchange of [[Bride price|bridewealth]] and dowries between the two families involved in a ghost marriage is quite "variable," and families may exchange both, one or the other, or even just red money packets.&lt;ref name="noteStockard"/&gt;{{rp|98}} There is no standard amount exchanged, but several of Janice Stockard's informants reported that the groom's family provided the bride with a house.&lt;ref name="noteStockard"/&gt;{{rp|98}} In another reported ghost marriage, the groom's family sent wedding cakes and NT $120 to the bride's family, who returned it with a dowry of a gold ring, gold necklace, several pairs of shoes, and six dresses "all fitted for the use of the groom's living wife."&lt;ref name="Wolf, Arthur P."/&gt;{{rp|151}}

===Rites of the ghost marriage ceremony===
In a ghost marriage, many of the typical marriage rites are observed. However, since one or more parties is deceased, they are otherwise represented, most often by effigies made of paper, bamboo,&lt;ref name="Topley, Marjorie 1956"/&gt;{{rp|71}} or cloth.&lt;ref name="noteJordan"/&gt;{{rp|147}}

For instance, a ghost couple at their marriage feast, the bride and groom may be constructed of paper bodies over a bamboo frame with a [[papier-mâché]] head.&lt;ref name="Topley, Marjorie 1956"/&gt;{{rp|71}} On either side of them stands their respective paper servants, and the room contains many other paper effigies of products they would use in their home, such as a dressing table (complete with a mirror), a table and six stools, a money safe, a refrigerator, and trunks of paper clothes and cloth. After the marriage ceremony is complete, all of the paper belongings are burned to be sent to the spirit world to be used by the couple.&lt;ref name="Topley, Marjorie 1956"/&gt;{{rp|71}}

In another ceremony that married a living groom to a ghost bride, the effigy was similar, but instead constructed with a wooden backbone, arms made from newspaper, and the head of "a smiling young girl clipped from a wall calendar."&lt;ref name="noteJordan"/&gt;{{rp|147}} Similarly, after the marriage festivities, the dummy is burned.&lt;ref name="Topley, Marjorie 1956"/&gt;{{rp|71}}

In both cases, the effigies wore real clothing, similar to that which is typically used in marriage ceremonies. This includes a pair of trousers, a white skirt, a red dress, with a lace outer dress.&lt;ref name="Topley, Marjorie 1956"/&gt;{{rp|71}}&gt; Additionally, they were adorned with jewelry; though similar in fashion to that of a typical bride's, it was not made of real gold.&lt;ref name="Topley, Marjorie 1956"/&gt;{{rp|71}} If a living groom is marrying a ghost bride, he will wear black gloves instead of the typical white.&lt;ref name="noteJordan"/&gt;{{rp|149}}

Most of the marriage ceremony and rites are performed true to Chinese custom. In fact, "the bride was always treated as though she was alive and participating in the proceedings"&lt;ref name="Wolf, Arthur P."/&gt;{{rp|151}} from being fed at the wedding feast in the morning, to being invited in and out of the cab, to being told of her arrival at the groom's house.&lt;ref name="noteJordan"/&gt;{{rp|147}} One observable difference in a ghost marriage is that the ancestral tablet of the deceased is placed inside the effigy, so that "the bride's dummy [is] animated with the ghost that [is] to be married",&lt;ref name="noteJordan"/&gt;{{rp|147}} and then placed with the groom's family's tablets at the end of the marriage festivities.&lt;ref name="noteJordan"/&gt;{{rp|148}}

==Portrayal in fiction==
In Yangsze Choo's novel ''The Ghost Bride'' (New York: William Morrow, 2013), set in 19th century colonial Malaya, a young Chinese woman receives a proposal from a wealthy family to marry their dead son.

In [[Lisa See]]'s novel ''[[Peony in Love]]'' (New York: Random House, 2007), set in 17th century China, the protagonist, Peony, dies at 16 and is later the bride in a ghost marriage to a poet she fell in love with during life.

In [[Bones (season 2)|Season 2, episode 16]] of the television series ''[[Bones (TV series)|Bones]]'', "The Boneless Bride in the River," a woman is murdered and has her bones sold for a ghost marriage ritual.

In [[Without a Trace (season 7)|episode 22 of the final season]] of the television series ''[[Without a Trace]]'', titled "Devotion," a young woman was kidnapped and set to be poisoned and ghost married by the traditional Chinese parents of her late ex-fiancé.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1256452/ | title=''Without a Trace'' Devotion | year=2009| publisher= IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[List of Numb3rs episodes (season 5)|Season 5, episode 13]] of the television series ''[[Numb3rs]]'', "Trouble in Chinatown," Chinese women are being murdered and then their bodies are buried atop the coffins of unmarried Chinese males. The "ghost brides" are picked out by the grieving parents. Shortly before the murder, a brief traditional wedding ceremony is held so that the dead sons have company in their afterlife. While the character performing the murders portrays this as long-standing Chinese tradition, the writers used the epilogue to point out that the authentic tradition did not involve murder and that the criminals had perverted the practice to their own ends.

An episode of ''[[Urban Legends (TV series)|Urban Legends]]'' portrayed this practice, with a twist. A man was forced to undergo this with his fiancée, who had recently killed herself.

In season 2 of ''[[The Blacklist (TV Series)|The Blacklist]]'', ghost marriage is a central theme of Episode 20 ("Quon Zhang, No. 87") when a blacklister smuggles bodies of deceased women and prepares them for afterlife with a marriage ceremony for the sons of grieving clients.

In the 2013 South Korean television drama [[Master's Sun]], ghost marriage is a plot point in several episodes.  In episode 5, the heroine, Gong-sil, who can see ghosts, is threatened with the prospect of being married to a ghost of a young man.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dramabeans.com/2013/08/masters-sun-episode-5/|title=Master's Sun: Episode 5 » Dramabeans Korean drama recaps|date=2013-08-22|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In episode 14, she is blackmailed into searching a graveyard late at night for the ghosts of unmarried women who are willing to participate in ghost marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dramabeans.com/2013/09/masters-sun-episode-14/|title=Master's Sun: Episode 14 » Dramabeans Korean drama recaps|date=2013-09-26|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Danica Novgorodoff's graphic novel ''The Undertaking of Lily Chen'', set in contemporary northern China, features a younger brother trying to obtain a corpse bride for his recently deceased older brother. When he cannot find a suitable female corpse, and he meets Lily Chen, who is both single and alive, he must wrestle with his family obligations versus his own growing feelings for Lily. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Novgorodoff |first1=Danica |title=The Undertaking of Lily Chen |date=2014 |publisher=First Second}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2017 Israeli film [[Longing (2017 film)|Longing]], part of the plot revolves around the attempt to arrange a ghost marriage between the dead teenage children of two families.

In the Filipino film of the same year, [[The Ghost Bride]], with unfortunate events that beset Mayen's ([[Kim Chiu]]) family, she is undecided between living a normal though difficult life or accepting a strange business proposal, called the Ghost Wedding in exchange for wealth and a comfortable life for her loved ones.

'''Domestic roof construction''' is the [[framing (construction)|framing]] and roof covering which is found on most detached [[house]]s in cold and temperate climates&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.themanufacturer.com/articles/domestic-roof-construction-whats-involved/|title=Domestic roof construction: what's involved? - The Manufacturer|work=The Manufacturer|access-date=2018-11-08|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Such roofs are built with mostly [[timber]], take a number of different [[List of roof shapes|shapes]], and are covered with a variety of [[List of commercially available roofing material|materials]].

==Overview==
[[File:Photography by Victor Albert Grigas (1919-2017) 00139 (23702821578).jpg|thumb|right|200px|A roof being framed in the United States circa 1955]]

Modern timber roofs are mostly framed with pairs of common rafters or prefabricated wooden trusses fastened together with [[truss connector plate]]s. Timber framed and historic buildings may be framed with principal rafters or [[timber roof truss]]es. Roofs are also designated as ''warm'' or ''cold roof'' depending on how they are designed and built with regard to thermal [[building insulation]] and [[Ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]]. The steepness or [[roof pitch]] of a sloped roof is determined primarily by the roof covering material and aesthetic design. [[Flat roof]]s actually slope up to approximately ten degrees to shed water. Flat roofs on houses are primarily found in [[arid]] regions.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, D. &amp; Worthing, D. (2000) The Construction of Houses. 3rd Edition. Estates Gazette London.&lt;/ref&gt;

In high wind areas, such as where a [[cyclone]] or [[hurricane]] may make landfall, the main [[engineering]] consideration is to hold the roof down during severe storms. Every component of the roof, as of course the rest of the structure, has to withstand the uplift forces of high wind speeds. This is accomplished by using metal ties fastened to each rafter or truss. This is not normally a problem in areas not prone to high wind or extreme weather conditions.

In the UK, a concrete tiled roof would normally have rafters at 600mm centers, roof battens at 300mm centers and ceiling joists  at 400mm centers. The United States still uses [[imperial units]] of measurement and framing members are typically spaced sixteen or twenty-four inches apart.

The roof framing may be interrupted for openings such as a [[chimney]] or [[skylight]]. Chimneys are typically built with a water diverter known as a [[Cricket (roofing)|''cricket'']] or ''saddle'' above the chimney. [[Flashing (weatherproofing)|Flashing]] is used to seal the gap between the chimney and roofing material.

==Construction of a rafter roof==
A simple rafter roof consists of [[rafter]]s that the ''rafter foot'' rest on horizontal [[wall plate]]s on top of each wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://disaster.ifas.ufl.edu/PDFS/CHAP05/D05-12.PDF |title= Roof Repairs 1 - The Rafters |publisher= University of Florida |work= The Disaster Handbook |date=1998 |accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The top ends of  your '''''da sells avon''''' the rafters often meet at a ''ridge beam'', but may butt directly to another rafter to form a pair of rafters called a ''couple''. Depending on the roof covering material, either horizontal [[lath]]s, [[batten]]s, or [[purlin]]s are fixed to the rafters; or boards, [[plywood]], or [[oriented strand board]] form the ''roof deck'' (also called the sheeting or sheathing) to support the roof covering. Heavier ''under purlins'' or ''purlin plates'' are used to support longer rafter spans. [[Tie (engineering)#Rafter tie (and Tie-beams)|Tie beams]], which may also serve as ceiling joists, are typically connected between the lower ends of opposite rafters to prevent them from spreading and forcing the walls apart. [[Collar beam]]s or collar ties may be fixed higher up between opposite rafters for extra strength. The rafters, tie beams and plates serve to transmit the weight of the roof to the [[wall]]s of the building

==Construction of a truss roof==
[[File:Wooden roof structure.jpg|thumb|A truss roof with tongue and groove sheathing. The gap in the sheathing at the ridge is the space designed to allow natural ventilation.]]
Pre-manufactured roof trusses come in a wide variety of styles. They are designed by the manufacturer for each specific building.

Timber trusses also are built in a variety of styles using wood or metal joints. Heavy timber rafters typically spaced {{convert|8|ft}} to {{convert|12|ft}} apart are called ''principal rafters''. Principal rafters may be mixed with ''common rafters'' or carry ''common purlins''.{{cn|date=August 2015}}

==Design loads==
Roof framing must be designed to hold up a ''[[structural load]]'' including what is called ''dead load'', its own weight and the weight of the roof covering, and additional loading called the ''environmental load'' such as snow and wind. Flat roofs may also need to be designed for ''live loads'' if people can walk on them. In the United States, [[building code]]s specify the loads in pounds per square foot which vary by region. The load and ''span'' (distance between supports) defines the size and spacing of the rafters and trusses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Domestic construction|url=http://www.commerce.wa.gov.au/publications/domestic-construction-controlling-falling-risks-while-working-roof-structures|publisher=www.commerce.wa.gov.au|accessdate=6 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roof covering==
{{main|List of commercially available roofing material}}
The roofing material is primarily designed to shed water. The covering is also a major element of the architecture so roofing materials come in a wide variety of colors and textures. The primary roof covering on houses in North America are [[asphalt shingle]]s, but some have other types of [[roof shingle]]s or [[metal roof]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.metalroofingsource.com/reroofing-metal-roof/ | title=Reroofing and the Metal Roof | publisher=Metal Roofing Source| date=14 October 2014 | accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tile#Roof tiles|Tile]] and [[thatch]] roofs are more common in Europe than North America. Some roofing materials help reduce air conditioning costs in hot climates by being designed to [[Reflective surfaces (geoengineering)|reflect]] light.

Asphalt shingles is the most used roofing material in North America, making up as much as 75% of all steep slope roofs. This type of material is also gaining popularity in Europe due to lower installation costs. Asphalt shingles dominate North American residential roofing market, because they are about half the price&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.roofcalc.org/roofing-shingles-prices/|title=Roofing Shingles Prices 2018 – Material And Installation Costs For 3-Tab &amp; Architectural Shingles {{!}} RoofCalc.org|date=2018-01-15|work=RoofCalc.org|access-date=2018-07-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; of other materials

In the southern US and Mexico, clay tile roofs are also very popular, due to their longevity, and ability to withstand hurricane winds with minimal or no damage.

In Europe, slate and tile roofs are very popular. Many slate roofs in Europe are over 100 years old, and typically require minimal maintenance / repairs.

==Ventilation and insulation==
&lt;!-- Hot roof, Warm roof, and Cold roof redirect here --&gt;
Roof space ventilation is needed to combat condensation within the roof space, leading to interstitial condensation within the roof fabric; this can lead to serious structural damage, wet or dry rot, as well as ruining the insulation in the roof spec.

Condensation within the roof space is much more of a problem today due to: much less fortuitous ventilation due to tighter building envelopes with high performance windows and door and no chimneys leading. This tighter envelope means the air temperature in buildings has risen, the warmer the air in the building is, the more water vapour the air can carry.

As the occupied part of building has become warner, the roof space has become colder, with high performance insulation and roofing membranes leading to a cold roof space.

When the warm, moist air from below rises into the cold roof space; condensation begins as the air temperature drops to the ‘dew point’ or as the warm air comes into contact with any of the cold surfaces in the roof.

Most building materials are permeable to water vapour; brick, concrete, plaster, wood and insulation all can fall victim to [[interstitial condensation]], this is why UK Building Regulations require roofs to be ventilated, either by the use of soffit vents, ridge vents, or replacement ventilation slates or tiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tricker|first=Ray|date=2011-03-03|title=Building Regulations in Brief|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.4324/9780080959160|doi=10.4324/9780080959160}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:V3Dob.jpg|thumb|A common method of ventilating a roof is to make openings in the soffit and ridge to allow natural air flow. This example also has ventilated exterior walls called [[rainscreen]] construction.]]
Ventilation of the roof deck speeds the evaporation of water from leakage or [[Interstitial condensation|condensation]] and removes heat which helps prevent [[Ice dam (roof)|ice dams]] and helps asphalt shingles last longer. Building codes in the U.S. specify ventilation rates as a minimum of 1 sq. ft. of opening per 150 sq. ft. (1:150) with a ratio of 1:300 in some conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Petty, Stephen E.. ''Forensic engineering damage assessments for residential and commercial structures''. Boca Raton, Fla.: CRC Press, Taylor &amp; Francis Group, 2013. 447. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Warm air rises so ceiling insulation is designed to have a higher [[R-value (insulation)|r-value]] and the insulation is often installed between the ceiling joists or rafters. A properly insulated and ventilated roof is called a ''cold roof''. A ''warm roof'' is a roof that is not ventilated,&lt;ref&gt;"Roof, non-ventilated" def. 1. Evert, Klaus. ''Encyclopedic dictionary of landscape and urban planning multilingual reference in English, Spanish, French and German''. Berlin: Springer, 2010. 849. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; where the insulation is placed in line with the roof pitch.&lt;ref&gt;"Warm roof" def. 1. Gorse, Christopher A., and David Johnston. ''A dictionary of construction, surveying, and civil engineering''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012. 482. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; A ''hot roof'' is a roof designed not to have any ventilation and has enough air-impermeable insulation in contact with the sheathing to prevent condensation&lt;ref&gt;Dekorne, Clayton (2014, February). Insulating Cathedral Ceilings: Practical solutions to prevent call backs and boost energy performance, ''Journal of Light Construction''  41-47.&lt;/ref&gt; such as when [[Spray foams (insulation)|spray foam]] insulation is applied directly to the under-side or top-side of the roof deck or in some cathedral ceilings.&lt;ref&gt;Kruger, Abe, and Carl Seville. ''Green building: principles and practices in residential construction''. Clifton Park, N.Y.: Delmar Cengage Learning, 2013. 192. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

A more recent design is the installation of a roof deck with foil-backed foam along with a second deck that is air-gapped away from the foil-backed foam to allow air to flow vertically to a ventilation outlet at the peak of the roof—it is a double deck design with an air gap. This design improves efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ORNL roof and attic design proves efficient in summer and winter|url=https://www.ornl.org/news/ornl-roof-and-attic-design-proves-efficient-summer-and-winter|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|date=September 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''economic ideology''' distinguishes itself from [[economic theory]] in being [[Normative economics|normative]] rather than just explanatory in its approach. It expresses a perspective on the way an [[economy]] should run and to what end, whereas the aim of economic theories is to create accurate explanatory [[Economic model|models]]. However the two are closely interrelated as underlying economic ideology influences the methodolog and theory employed in analysis. The diverse ideology and methodology of the 74 Nobel laureates in economics speaks to such interrelation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Ideological Profiles of the Economic Laureates|journal=Econ Journal Watch|date=2013|volume=10|issue=3|pages=255–682}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A good way of discerning whether an [[ideology]] can be classified an economic ideology is to query if it inherently takes a specific and detailed economic standpoint.

Furthermore,  economic ideology is distinct from an [[economic system]] that it supports, such as a [[capitalist]] ideology, to the extent that explaining an economic system ([[positive economics]]) is distinct from advocating it ([[normative economics]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Klappholz | first1 = Kurt | year = 1987 | title = ideology | url = | journal = The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics | volume = 2 | issue = | page = 716 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of economic ideology explains its occurrence, evolution, and relation to an [[economy]]&lt;ref&gt;• Roland Bénabou, 2008.

===Capitalism===
[[Capitalism]] is a broad economic system where the [[means of production]] are largely or entirely privately owned and operated for [[Profit (economics)|profit]], where the allocation of capital goods is determined by [[capital market]]s and [[financial market]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/capitalism|title=Definition of Capitalism|last=|first=|date=6 Nov 2017|website=merriam-webster|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=13 Nov 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several implementations of capitalism that are loosely based around how much government involvement or public enterprise exists. The main ones that exist today are [[mixed economies]], where the state intervenes in market activity and provides some services;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/glossary/mixed-economy/|title=Mixed Economy|last=Pettinger|first=Tejvan|date=27 July 2017|website=economicshelp|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=14 Nov 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[laissez faire]], where the state only supplies a court, a military, and police; and [[state capitalism]], where the state engages in commercial business activity itself.

====Laissez-faire====
Laissez-faire, or [[free market]] capitalism, is an ideology that prescribes minimal public enterprise and government regulation in a capitalist economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/laissezfaire.asp|title=Laissez-Faire|last=|first=|date=2003-11-23|website=Investopedia|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=14 Nov 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ideology advocates for a type of capitalism based on open [[competition]] to determine the [[price]], [[Production (economics)|production]] and [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]] of goods through the [[invisible hand]] of [[supply and demand]] reaching efficient [[market equilibrium]]. In such a system, [[Capital (economics)|capital]], [[property]] and [[Business|enterprise]] are entirely [[privately owned]] and new enterprises may freely gain [[market entry]] without restriction. [[Employment]] and [[wages]] are determined by a [[labour market]] that will result in some [[unemployment]]. [[Government]] and [[judicial]] [[Interventionism (politics)|intervention]] are employed at times to change the economic incentives for people for various reasons. The capitalist economy will likely follow [[economic growth]] along with a steady [[business cycle]] of [[Austrian business cycle theory|small booms and busts]].

====Social market====
The [[social market economy]] (also known as [[Rhine capitalism]]) is advocated by the ideology of [[ordoliberalism]] and [[social liberalism]]. This ideology supports a free-market economy where supply and demand determine the price of goods and services, and where markets are free from regulation. However, this economic ideology calls for state action in the form of [[social policy]] favoring social insurance, unemployment benefits and recognition of labor rights.

Casino capitalism is the high risk-taking and financial instability associated with [[financial institutions]] becoming very large and mostly self-regulated, while also taking on high-risk financial [[investment]] dealings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.financepractitioner.com/dictionary/casino-capitalism|title=Casino Capitalism Definition|last=|first=|date=2009|website=financepractitioner.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=30 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been a driving motive by investors in the quest for [[Profit (economics)|profits]] without [[Production (economics)|production]]; it provides a [[speculation]] aspect that offers prospects for a quicker and more speculator returns for people, [[wealth]], and inside assumptions of the factors likely to affect [[asset]] [[price]] movements.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Political Economy: The Contest of Economic Ideas (3rd ed.)|last=Stilwell|first=Frank|publisher=Oxford University Press.|date=1 December 2011|isbn=978-0195575019|location=New York, NY.|pages=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, this does not add to the collective wealth of an [[economy]], as it can instead create economic instability.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Casino capitalism falls alongside the idea of a [[speculation]]-based economy where [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneurial]] activities turn to more paper games of speculative [[trading]] than actually producing economic [[goods]] and [[Service (economics)|services]].

It is believed by people such as economists [[Frank Stilwell]] that casino capitalism was one of the leading causes of the [[Global financial crisis|global financial crisis]] in 2008. Investors sought out a get-rich-quick motive they found through speculative activities that offered a particular individual gain or loss depending on the assets’ future movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Political Economy: The Contest of Economic Ideas (3rd ed.)|last=Stilwell|first=Frank|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=1 December 2011|isbn=978-0195575019|location=New York, NY.|pages=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other [[economists]] like [[Hans-Werner Sinn]], have written books on casino capitalism with commentary outside the Anglo-Saxon [[Financial bubble|bubble]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Casino Capitalism: How the Financial Crisis Came About and What Needs to be Done Now|last=Sinn|first=Hans- Werner|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2012|isbn=978-0199659883|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Neo-capitalism====
[[Neo-capitalism]] is an economic ideology that blends elements of capitalism with other systems and emphasizes government intervention in the economy to save and reconstruct companies that are deemed a risk to the nation. The ideology's prime years are considered by some economists to be the 10 years leading up to 1964 after the [[Great Depression]] and [[World War II]]. After World War II, countries were destroyed and needed to rebuild and since capitalism thrives in [[Industrialisation|industrializing]] countries. These countries most affected by the [[war]] saw a growth in capitalism. Neo-capitalism differs from regular capitalism in that while capitalism highlights [[Private ownership of land|private owners]], Neo-capitalism emphasizes the role of the [[State (polity)|state]] in sustaining the [[country]] as a provider and a producer and condemns private companies for lacking in their role as a provider and producer for their country.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mandel|first=Ernest|date=1964|title=The Economics of Neo-Capitalism|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/mandel/1964/xx/neocap.html|journal=Socialist Register|volume=1|pages=56–67|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of neo-capitalism claim that it tends to suppress the reserve army of labor which may lead to full employment, as this can undermine one of the main basics that make capitalism work. Other critics state that if neo-capitalism was put into place, it would become immediately corrupt.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Fascism===
[[Fascism]] as an economic system takes the middle ground between capitalism and socialism. It promotes the pursuit of individual [[Profit (economics)|profit]] while promoting corporations through government [[Subsidy|subsidies]] as the primary tool of economic progress as long as their activities are in line with the goals of the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Röpke|first=Wilhelm|date=1935|title=Fascist Economics|journal=Economica|volume=2|issue=5|pages=85–100|via=|doi=10.2307/2549110|jstor=2549110}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fascist economies, profits or gains are individualized while losses are socialized; these economies are often compared to the [[third way]] due to being heavily [[Corporation|corporatized]]. Fascist economies of the mid 20th century such as [[Italy]] and [[Germany]] often used bilateral [[trade]] agreements, with heavy [[tariff]]s on [[Import substitution industrialization|imports]] and government subsidized [[export]]s to developing nations around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baker|first=David|title=The political economy of fascism: Myth or reality, or myth and reality?|journal=New Political Economy|volume=11|issue=2|pages=227–250|doi=10.1080/13563460600655581|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; While economically fascism is oriented towards self-sufficiency, politically fascist countries of the mid-20th century were oriented to war and expansion; two seemingly contradictory motives. The goal of fascist nations was to create a closed economic system, self-reliant, but also ready to make war and expand. Fascist economies can then be seen as a sort of capitalist economy, with little state intervention usually in the form of [[business]] subsidies.

===Socialism===
[[Socialism]] is any of the various ideologies of economic organization based on some form of [[social ownership]] of the means of production and cooperative management of the allocation of resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/10/14/8-questions-you-were-too-embarrassed-to-ask-about-democratic-socialism/|title=8 questions about democratic socialism and Bernie Sanders’s vision for the United States|last=Ehrenfreund|first=Max|date=2015-10-14|work=Washington Post|access-date=2017-12-04|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; Socialist systems can be distinguished by the dominant coordination mechanism employed ([[economic planning]] or [[Market economy|markets]]) and by the type of ownership employed ([[Public ownership]] or [[cooperative]]s).

In some models of socialism (often called [[market socialism]]), the state approves of the prices and products produced in the economy, subjecting the market system to direct external regulations. Alternatively, the state may produce the goods but then sell them in competitive markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schleifer | first1 = Andrei | last2 = Vishny | first2 = Robert W. | year = 1994 | title = The Politics of Market Socialism | url = http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/shleifer/files/politics_market_socialism.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Journal of Economic Perspectives | volume = 8 | issue = 2| pages = 165–76 | doi=10.1257/jep.8.2.165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Democratic socialism====
[[Democratic socialism]] (sometimes referred to as [[economic democracy]]) is an economic ideology that calls for democratic institutions in the economy. These may take the form of [[cooperative]]s, [[workplace democracy]] or ad hoc approach to the management and ownership of the means of production. Democratic Socialism is a blending of socialistic and democratic ideas to create a political and economic Structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.politicalsciencenotes.com/socialism/democratic-socialism-definition-nature-methods-and-tenets/817|title=Democratic Socialism: Definition, Nature, Methods and Tenets|date=2015-05-08|work=Political Science Notes|access-date=2017-12-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Marxism-Leninism====
[[Marxism-Leninism]] is a political ideology that calls for centralized planning of the economy. This ideology formed the economic basis of all existing [[Communist state]]s.

A socialist state will primarily concern itself with the welfare of its citizens. Socialist doctrines essentially promote the collectivist idea that an economy's resources should be used in the interest all participants, and not simply for private gain. This notion historically alienated the [[market economy]], and tended to favor [[central planning]]. Countries that favored excessive central controls experienced economic decline and collapse in the long run, as was the case with the [[Economy of the Soviet Union#1970–1990|Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;"Socialism." A Dictionary of Economics (3 ed.). Oxford Reference, 2009. [http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199237043.001.0001/acref-9780199237043-e-2896?rskey=7j98WR&amp;result=2743&amp;q= Web]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communism===
As [[Friedrich Engels]] described it (in ''[[Anti-Dühring]]''), [[communism]] is the evolved result of socialism so that the central role of the state has 'withered away' and is no longer necessary for the functioning of a [[planned economy]]. All property and capital are collectively owned and managed in a communal, [[classless]] and [[egalitarian]] society. [[Currency]] is no longer needed, and all economic activity, enterprise, labour, production and consumption is freely exchanged "[[from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs]]".

Communism is also a political system as much an economic one—with various models in how it is implemented—the well known being the [[Marxist Leninist]] model, which argues for the use of a vanguard party to bring about a workers state to be used as a transitional tool to bring about stateless communism, the economic arrangement described above. Other models to bring about communism include [[anarcho-communism]], which argues similarly to Marxist schools for a revolutionary transformation to the above economic arrangement, but does not use a transitional period or vanguard party.

===Anarcho-primitivism===
[[Anarcho-primitivism]] strives to return humans to a pre-industrialized and pre-civilization state. From an economic standpoint, advocates of this model argue the non-necessity of economic systems for human existence. Proponents of this ideology believe that the entire history of human civilization took a wrong turn from hunter-gatherer systems into an [[Agricultural economics|agricultural]] system and has led to human dependence on technology to support increasing populations, government control, and culture. [[Population growth]] and the institutions created to support and control it are exploitative of the not only humans but also the environment. They argue that the more people live in a society, the more resources they will need. These resources must be taken from the Earth and therefore lead to environmental exploitation. However, they claim that materialist exploitation can be seen throughout almost every society in the world today. This materialism creates inequalities and exploitation such as [[Social class|class structure]], the exploitation of humans in the name of [[Labour economics|labor]] and profit, and most importantly environmental destruction and deterioration. This exploitation has led to the increase in human population growth, activity, and development which they argue is destroying the Earth's [[ecosystem]]s. They emphasize coexisting with the natural world instead of destroying it, “a world order on our planet where human civilization is brought into harmony with nature”.&lt;ref&gt;Becker, Michael, Anarcho-Primitivism: The Green Scare in Green Political Theory (April 1, 2010). Western Political Science Association 2010 Annual Meeting Paper . Available at SSRN: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1580329&lt;/ref&gt; Where they differ from other [[Anarchism|anarchist]] and green ideologies is that they oppose technological and industrial advancement as it further propagates the exploitation of humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1743-4580.2009.00250.x | volume=12 | issue=3 | title=ANARCHISM AND THE POLITICS OF TECHNOLOGY | year=2009 | journal=WorkingUSA | pages=489–503 | last1 = Gordon | first1 = Uri}}&lt;/ref&gt; “Technology is not a simple tool which can be used in any way we like. It is a form of social organization, a set of social relations. It has its own laws. If we are to engage in its use, we must accept its authority. The enormous size, complex interconnections and stratification of tasks which make up modern technological systems make authoritarian command necessary and independent, individual decision-making impossible”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/john-moore-a-primitivist-primer|title=A Primitivist Primer|last=Moore|first=John|date=12 Feb 2009|website=theanarchistlibrary|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=10 Oct 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anarcho-primitivist seek to revert the economic and government institutions of civilization which they argue are [[authoritarian]], exploitative, and abstract and return humanity to a way of living which is harmonious with the natural world in which technology used mostly individually to create tools for survival much like in primitive cultures and tribes where they argue there is little need for abstract things such as an economy or government.

{{Rhetoric}}
'''Elocutio''' is the term for the mastery of stylistic elements in Western classical [[rhetoric]] and comes from the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''loqui'', "to speak". Although the word ''elocution'' is now associated more with eloquent speaking, it connoted "style" for the classical rhetorican.

It is the third of the five canons of classical rhetoric (the others being [[inventio]], [[dispositio]], [[memoria]], and [[pronuntiatio]]) that concern the crafting and delivery of speeches and writing. Beginning in the [[Renaissance]], writers increasingly emphasized the stylistic aspects of rhetoric over the other divisions of rhetoric.

An orator or writer had a number of things to decide in developing a style for a particular discourse. First, there was the level of style; plain (''attenuata'' or ''subtile''), middle (''mediocris'' or ''robusta''), or high (''florida'' or ''gravis''). Writers were instructed to match the basic style to their subject matter and audience. For instance, [[Quintilian]] in his ''Institutio Oratoria'' deemed the plain style suitable for instruction, the middle for moving oration, and the high for charming discourse. Today, elocution and rhetoric are associated with the last of the styles, but for rhetoricians, each style was useful in rhetoric.

The ancient authors agreed that the four ingredients necessary to achieve good style included correctness, clearness, appropriateness, and ornament.

Sometimes translated as "purity," correctness meant that rhetors should use words that were current and adhered to the grammatical rules of whatever language they wrote. Correctness rules are standards of grammar and usage drawn from traditional grammar.

In regard to clarity, most ancient teachers felt that clarity meant that rhetors should use words in their ordinary or everyday senses. The object of clarity was to allow meaning to "shine through" like light through a window.

Appropriateness probably derives from the Greek rhetorical notion to ''prepon'', meaning to say or do whatever is fitting in a given situation. Ancient teachers taught that close attention to kairos will help to determine the appropriate style.

The last and most important of the excellences of style is ornament, which is defined as extraordinary or unusual use of language. Ornamentation was divided into three broad categories: figures of speech, figures of thought, and [[trope (literature)|trope]]s. Figures of speech are any artful patterning or arrangement of language. Figures of thought are artful presentations of ideas, feelings, concepts and figures of thought that depart from the ordinary patterns of argument. Tropes are any artful substitution of one term for another.

A great amount of attention was paid to [[figure of speech|figures of speech]], which were classified into various types and subtypes. One Renaissance writer, [[Henry Peacham (born 1546)|Henry Peacham]], enumerated 184 different figures of speech, but it could be argued that it was a manifestation of the increasing overemphasis on style that began in the Renaissance.

Also important to ''elocutio'' were subjects that would now be generally regarded as grammatical: the proper use of punctuation and conjunctions; the desirable order of words in a sentence (unlike English, many languages are not as dependent on word order to establish relationships between words and so choices of word order may revolve more around form than function); and the length of sentences.

[[File:EncyclopediaIslam1.JPG|thumb|Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition]]
The '''''Encyclopaedia of Islam''''' ('''''EI''''') is an [[encyclopaedia]] of the [[academic discipline]] of [[Islamic studies]] published by [[Brill Publishers|Brill]]. It is considered to be the standard reference work in the field of Islamic studies.&lt;ref name="Greskowiak"/&gt; The first edition was published in 1913–1938, the second in 1954–2005, and the third was begun in 2007.

== Content ==
According to Brill, the ''EI'' includes "articles on distinguished Muslims of every age and land, on tribes and dynasties, on the crafts and sciences, on political and religious institutions, on the geography, ethnography, flora and fauna of the various countries and on the history, topography and monuments of the major towns and cities. In its geographical and historical scope it encompasses the old Arabo-Islamic empire, the Islamic countries of Iran, Central Asia, the Indian sub-continent and Indonesia, the Ottoman Empire and all other Islamic countries".&lt;ref name="Brill-description"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brill.com/publications/encyclopaedia-islam |title=Encyclopaedia of Islam |publisher=[[Brill Publishers]] |accessdate=2016-01-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Standing ==
''EI'' is considered to be the standard reference work in the field of Islamic studies.&lt;ref name="Greskowiak"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brill.com/publications/encyclopaedia-islam |title=Encyclopaedia of Islam |publisher=[[Brill Publishers]] |accessdate=2016-01-11 | quote=It is the standard international reference for all fields of 'Islam' (Es ist das internationale Standardwerk für alle Bereiche 'des Islams'. Martin Greskowiak, Orientalistische Literaturzeitung, 1990).}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each article was written by a recognized specialist on the relevant topic. However, unsurprisingly for a work spanning 40 years until completion, not every one of them reflects recent research.
{{quote|The most important, authoritative reference work in English on Islam and Islamic subjects. Includes long, signed articles, with bibliographies. Special emphasis is given in this (''EI2'') edition  to economic and social topics, but it remains the standard encyclopedic reference on the Islamic religion in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.library.yale.edu/rsc/islam/dicts.htm |title=Yale University Library Research Guide: Islam |publisher=[[Yale University]] |accessdate=2008-04-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070816160241/http://www.library.yale.edu/rsc/islam/dicts.htm |archivedate=August 16, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
{{quote|The most important and comprehensive reference tool for Islamic studies is the ''Encyclopaedia of Islam'', an immense effort to deal with every aspect of Islamic civilization, conceived in the widest sense, from its origins down to the present day... ''EI'' is no anonymous digest of received wisdom.  Most of the articles are signed, and while some are hardly more than dictionary entries, others are true research pieces – in many cases the best available treatment of their subject.&lt;ref name="Humphreys"&gt;{{cite book |first=R. Stephen |last=Humphreys |title=Islamic History: A Framework for Inquiry |location=Princeton, New Jersey |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=1991 |isbn=0-691-00856-6 |page=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This reference work is of fundamental importance on topics dealing with the geography, ethnography and biography of Muslim peoples.&lt;ref name="Iranica"&gt;Elton L. Daniel, "Encyclopedia of Islam" in Encyclopaedia Iranica&lt;/ref&gt;

== Editions ==
The first edition (''EI1'') was modeled on the [[Pauly-Wissowa]] ''Encyclopaedia of the Ancient World''. ''EI1'' was created under the aegis of the [[International Union of Academies]], and coordinated by [[Leiden University]]. It was published by Brill in four volumes plus supplement from 1913 to 1938 in [[English language|English]], [[German language|German]], and [[French language|French]] editions.

An abridged version was published in 1953 as the ''Shorter Encyclopaedia of Islam'' (''SEI''), covering mainly law and religion. Excerpts of the ''SEI'' have been translated and published in [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], and [[Urdu]].

The second edition of ''Encyclopaedia of Islam'' (''EI2'') was begun in 1954 and completed in 2005 (several indexes to be published until 2007); it is published by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] company [[Brill Publishers|Brill]] and is available in English and French.  Since 1999, (''EI2'') has been available in electronic form, in both CD-ROM and web-accessible versions. Besides a great expansion in content, the second edition of ''EI'' differs from the first mainly in incorporating the work of scholars of Muslim and [[Middle East]]ern background among its many hundreds of contributors:

{{quote|''EI1'' and ''SEI'' were produced almost entirely by European scholars, and they represent a specifically European interpretation of Islamic civilization.  The point is not that this interpretation is "wrong", but that the questions addressed in these volumes often differ sharply from those which Muslims have traditionally asked about themselves.  ''EI2'' is a somewhat different matter.  It began in much the same way as its predecessor, but a growing proportion of the articles now come from scholars of Muslim background.  The persons do not represent the traditional learning of [[Qom]] and [[Al-Azhar University|al-Azhar]], to be sure;  they have been trained in Western-style universities, and they share the methodology if not always the cultural values and attitudes of their Western colleagues.  Even so, the change in tone is perceptible and significant.&lt;ref name="Humphreys"/&gt; }}

Publication of the Third Edition of ''EI'' (''EI3'') started in 2007. It is available online, printed "Parts" appearing four times per year. The editorial team consists of twenty 'Sectional Editors' and five 'Executive Editors' (i.e. editors-in-chief). The Executive Editors are Kate Fleet, Gudrun Krämer ([[Free University, Berlin]]), Everett Rowson (New York University), John Nawas ([[Université catholique de Louvain|Catholic University of Leuven]]), and Denis Matringe (EHESS, CNRS). The scope of ''EI3'' includes comprehensive coverage of Islam in the twentieth century; expansion of geographical focus to include all areas where Islam has been or is a prominent or dominant aspect of society; attention to Muslim minorities all over the world; and full attention to social science as well as humanistic perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;

==Urdu translation==
The ''Urdu Encyclopaedia of Islam''  is the project of translating the Encyclpedia of Islam into [[Urdu]].
It was started in the 1950s at [[University of the Punjab]], as a project led by Muhammad Shafi.&lt;ref&gt;

{{cite web|title=Department of ''Urdu Encyclopaedia of Islam'' at the University of the Punjab|url=http://pu.edu.pk/home/department/36/Department-of-Urdu-Encyclopaedia-of-Islam}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  The editorial board worked on translating the Leiden ''Encyclopaedia'' into Urdu, amending, correcting, and adding to the Leiden text themselves.&lt;ref name=IS&gt;{{cite book|title=Islamic studies|publisher=Central Institute of Islamic Research (Pakistan)|year=1963|pages=141|volume=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The original plan for publication, as laid out by Shafi and others, was for the ''Encyclopaedia'' (which was to be entitled ''Urdu Da’ira Ma’arif-i-Islamiya'') to span between 20 and 22 volumes, with roughly a hundred illustrations per volume, published at a rate of four volumes per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=UNESCO bulletin for libraries|publisher=[[United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization]]|year=1954|volume=8|pages=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;
At the time of Shafi's death in 1963, one volume of the encyclopaedia had been published (in February 1954), and a second volume was in press.&lt;ref name=IS /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Journal of the Pakistan Historical Society|publisher=Pakistan Historical Society|year=1963|volume=11&amp;ndash;12|pages=264}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Because of Shafi's death, and lack of funding, work on the ''Encyclopaedia'' stalled until 1971, when a grant from the [[Asia Foundation]] enabled it to resume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Islamic Culture: The Hyderabad Quarterly Review|author=Islamic Culture Board|chapter=Urdu Encyclopaedia of Islam|publisher=Deccan|year=1971|pages=79|volume=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Volumes 10 and 12 were completed by 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Year Book|publisher=Pakistan Education Division|year=1973|pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
By 1985, 21 out of a planned 25 volumes had been published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Muslim World|author=World Muslim Conference|publisher=Motamar al-Alam al-Islami; World Muslim Congress|year=1985|volume=23|issue=1&amp;ndash;26|pages=32|chapter=Urdu Encyclopaedia of Islam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Foundation for Interreligious and Intercultural Research and Dialogue''' ('''FIIRD''') was founded in 1999, sponsored by the [[Levant Foundation]] with the [[University of Geneva]] in Switzerland "to pursue its scholarly and humanistic goals with the main objective of fostering understanding of the three monotheistic religions: Christianity, Islam and Judaism."  The main program of the FIIRD is to enhance knowledge and the critical examination of the wellsprings of each religious tradition and then to acquire the linguistic and strategic tools needed to study the normative scriptures of these religions without syncretism or proselytism.

==Projects and Goals==
In 2006 the FIIRD published a boxed set of the three Holy Books, the Hebrew Bible, the New Testament and the Holy Qur'an.

Another goal of the FIIRD, strongly supported by the [[Levant Foundation]], was to create a post-doctoral program at the [[University of Geneva]] in the field of interreligious and intercultural dialogue whereby several Fellows, each possessing a PhD in theology, philosophy, history or other humanities and dedicated to further their knowledge and understanding of the monotheistic religions, participate in approved research and publish their results all done with the goal of searching for peace between the Abrahamistic religions of Judaism, Christianity and Islam.

==Phonology==

Gimi has 5 vowels and 12 consonants.&lt;ref name="Phonemes"&gt;Gimi Organised Phonology Data. [Manuscript] [http://www-01.sil.org/pacific/png/abstract.asp?id=928474542483]&lt;/ref&gt; It has voiceless and voiced glottal consonants where related languages have {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/ɡ/}}. The voiceless glottal is simply a glottal stop {{IPA|[ʔ]}}. The voiced consonant behaves phonologically like a glottal stop, but does not have full closure. Phonetically it is a [[creaky-voiced glottal approximant]] {{IPA|[ʔ̞]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{SOWL|77&amp;ndash;78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was originally danceable, but now has lost its rhythm, is much slower, and is usually only sung or played as a guitar solo, reflecting its Arab-Moorish heritage more strongly than other fandangos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Claus Schreiner|title=Flamenco: Gypsy Dance and Music from Andalusia|year=1990|publisher=Amadeus Press|location=Portland, OR|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The famous singer ''Don'' [[Antonio Chacón]] (1869–1929) is attributed with freeing the granaína from its rhythmic ties and making it popular.
Singers usually finish their rendering of the granaína with a ''media granaína'', a similar tune but rising to a higher pitch. [[Manuel Vallejo]] (1891–1960) was a famous exponent of this latter ''[[palo (flamenco)|cante]]''.

'''Inventive spelling''' (sometimes ''invented spelling'')  is the use of [[Convention (norm)|unconventional]] [[spelling]]s of words.

Conventional written English is not [[Phonemic orthography|phonetic]] (that is, it is not written as it sounds, due to the [[English orthography#History|history of its spelling]], which led to outdated, unintuitive, misleading or arbitrary spelling conventions and spellings of individual words) unlike, for example, [[German language|German]] or [[Spanish language|Spanish]], where letters have relatively fixed associated sounds, so that the written text is a fair representation of the spoken words.

== Overview ==
[[English orthography|English spelling]] is not intuitive and must be learned.  There have been numerous proposals&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wyrdplay.org/reform1.html|title=English Spelling Reform|author1=Alan Beale |author2=Paul Stought |author3=Bob Boden |publisher=Wyrdplay org|accessdate=2013-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; to rationalize written English, notably by 
* [[Noah Webster]] in the early 19th century (which is why the [[Webster's Dictionary]] used in the USA varies from the British [[Oxford English Dictionary]]) 
* Sir [[Isaac Pitman]], inventor of [[Pitman shorthand]] about 1838, which uses symbols to represent sounds, and words are, for the most part, written as they are spoken
* Dr. [[John R. Malone]] invented [[Unifon]] in the mid-1950s 
* Sir [[James Pitman]] (the grandson of Sir Isaac) in the early 1960s developed the [[Initial Teaching Alphabet]]
* Jaber Jabbour in 2012 proposed [[SaypU]], an abbreviated version of the International Phonetic Alphabet adapted for tourism and safety notices, which uses only part of the [[Latin alphabet]]

==In education==
Inventive spelling for children may be encouraged or discouraged by teachers and parents who may believe that expression is more important than accurate orthography or conversely that a failure to correct may lead to difficulty in communicating more complex ideas in later life.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Inventive spelling programs may also be known as "words their way" in some schools' curricula.&lt;ref name="Amazon-7770856"&gt;{{cite book |title=Words Their Way: Word Study for Phonics, Vocabulary, and Spelling Instruction |isbn=978-0-13-223968-4 |date=May 21, 2007 |publisher=Prentice Hall |edition=4  |first1=Donald R. |last1=Bear |first2=Marcia |last2=Invernizzi |first3=Shane |last3=Templeton |first4=Francine |last4=Johnston}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Critics of inventive spelling {{Who|date=December 2017}} have argued that inventive spelling does not produce superior writing skills.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

=== Debate over inventive or invented spelling ===
Samuel Orton pioneered the study of learning disabilities, such as [[dyslexia]]. where the subject is apt to confound the letter-order of words. He and  his assistant [[Anna Gillingham]], an educator and psychologist, evolved the [[Orton-Gillingham]] Approach to reading instruction which is language-based, multi-sensory, structured, sequential, cumulative, cognitive, and flexible. The Academy of Orton-Gillingham Practitioners and Educators (AOEPE) lists about a dozen schools currently committed to this controversial method, which has evolved since about 1935.

More recently, [[Uta Frith]], a developmental psychologist at the Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience at University College, London, has published work concerning spelling difficulties and dyslexia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Frith, Uta |title=Cognitive Processes in Spelling |publisher=Academic Press |location=London, UK |year=1983|isbn=0-12-268662-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dyslexia, whether linked to complex spelling or not, may offer considerable potential for human development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Dyslexic Advantage: Unlocking the Hidden Potential of the Dyslexic Brain|author=Brock L. Eide M.D. M.A. |publisher=Penguin USA/Plume|year=2011|isbn=978-0-452-29792-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Gift of Dyslexia|publisher=Penguin USA/Perigee|year=1999|isbn=978-0-399-53566-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Learning theory===

Whether an individual accepts or rejects inventive spelling is a feature of that individual's [[epistemology|theory of learning]]. The debate is closely linked with the debate over [[whole language]] [[literacy]] instruction and [[phonics]] instruction.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

====Theories of supporters====
Those who favor inventive spelling tend to believe in [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivism]], a theoretical perspective on learning (an [[epistemology]]) grounded in [[postmodernism]] and [[holism]].  Constructivists believe that knowledge is created by individuals in a social context.  Because knowledge is cultural, there are no right answers.  In terms of inventive spelling, constructivists are likely to believe that the child is inventing spellings in accord with his or her understanding of language and print.  These spellings are neither right nor wrong; they reflect the child's development as a speller.

====Theories of detractors====
Those who oppose inventive spelling tend to be [[positivism|positivists]] or [[postpositivism|post-positivists]]. Positivists believe that there are correct answers that we can discover based upon [[empirical]] observation.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} They would argue that encouraging inventive spelling is not helpful because there are correct ways to spell that children should learn.

Post-positivists believe that while we cannot know truth completely – our own biases and perspectives prevent that – we can ''approximate'' truth.  Post-positivists might agree with constructivists that an inventive spelling does reflect a child's development but might also argue that there are socially accepted spellings and that children should know these well. This side of the debate was explored further in the book and short film "The deliberate [[dumbing down]] of America".{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}
&lt;!-- This section and possibly this entire article uses weasel words and is in dire need of citations. --&gt;

====State of the debate====
Advocates of inventive spelling focus on creativity when children are first learning to spell and write, feel this preserves self-esteem, and thus, feel creativity in spelling is most important.&lt;ref&gt;Brügelmann, H./ Brinkmann, E. (2012): Supporting individual routes to literacy: Developing concepts and skills before school  by using print in meaningful contexts. Download: https://www.academia.edu/4274843/Supporting_individual_routes_to_literacy_Developing_concepts_and_skills_before_school_by_using_print_in_meaningful_contexts; Ferreiro, E./ Teberosky, A. (1982): Literacy before schooling. Heinemann: Portsmouth/ London (span. 1979); McGee, L.M., &amp; Richgels, D. J. (2012): Literacy's beginnings: Supporting young readers and writers. Pearson/ Allyn and Bacon: Boston et al. (6th ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;  Opponents counter that creativity is a distraction when learning spelling for the first time, and that children ought to be taught accurate spelling as soon as possible so as not to have incorrect spellings become a habit and delay the learning of accurate spelling.  The overwhelming view from parents {{Citation needed|date=February 2015}} is that children learn to spell more quickly and accurately if accurate spelling is the focus instead of creativity when learning words.  Accuracy as the focus in spelling is the manner used in conventional teaching methods and was effectively universal prior to the implementation of 1970s school reform involving whole word literacy and "new math". &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

===Instruction===

====Inventive spelling instruction====
Pedagogical concepts &lt;ref&gt;e.g. by Brügelmann, H. (1986). ''Discovering print – a process approach to initial reading and writing in West Germany''. In: The Reading Teacher, Vol. 40, No. 3, 294–298; McGee, L. M./ Richgels, D. J. (2000). ''Literacy's beginnings: Supporting young readers and writers.'' Boston: Allyn and Bacon (3rd ed.).&lt;/ref&gt;  are based on research studies of early literacy, e.g. by  Emilia Ferreiro &amp; Ana Teberosky, Maryann Manning and others.&lt;ref&gt;Ferreiro, E./ Teberosky, A. (1982). ''Literacy before schooling''. Portsmouth/ London: Heinemann (span. 1979); Henderson, E. H./ Beers, J. W. (eds.) (1980). ''Developmental and cognitive aspects of learning to spell: A reflection of word knowledge''. Newark, Del.:  International Reading Association;  Clarke, L.K. (1988). ''Invented vs. traditional spelling in first graders' writings: Effects on learning to spell and read''. In: Research in the Teaching of English, Vol. 22, No. 3 (October), 281–309.&lt;/ref&gt; Children are encouraged to learn to read by writing in a meaningful context, e.g. by writing letters to others. To write a word they have to decompose its spoken form into sounds and then to translate them into letters, e.g. ''k'', ''a'', ''t'' for the [[phonemes]] /k/, /æ/, and /t/. Empirical studies &lt;ref&gt;Brügelmann, H. (1999). ''From invention to convention. Children's different routes to literacy. How to teach reading and writing by construction vs. instruction.'' In: Nunes, T. (ed.) (1999). ''Learning to read: An integrated view from research and practice.'' Dordrecht et al.: Kluwer(315–342); Richgels, D.J. (2001). ''Invented spelling, phonemic awareness, and reading and writing instruction.'' In: Neuman, S. B./ Dickinson, D. (eds.) (2001). ''Handbook on Research in Early Literacy for the 21st Century.'' New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; show that later orthographic development is fostered rather than hindered by these invented spellings - as long as children from the beginning are confronted with "book spellings", too.

To use [[SIL International]]'s&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sil.org/ www.sil.org]&lt;/ref&gt; inventive spelling program, there are several instructional principles, as follows: 
* At first, the teachers should accept all of the student's writing as meaningful writing. As students gain more experience, they begin to learn the correct spellings of words and use these spellings in their writings.
* Let the students write freely and independently.
* Ask students to read what they have written.
* Read the text, or repeat the story as if you are reading it.
* Ignore spelling and [[grammar]] errors, unless the students ask to be corrected.
* Rewrite the text if students want you to.
* Help the students to create their own word lists as they write or edit so they can find out the proper spellings.

One aspect of inventive spelling rarely discussed by its advocates is the toll it takes on teachers' time.  Recent studies suggest that to be effective a spelling teacher also must correctly guess what words children meant to use when they invent spellings. The possible deductions are numerous and potentially complicated.&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;

====Instruction for conventional spelling====

[[Writing]] and [[Reading (process)|reading]] are complex cognitive processes of encoding and decoding symbols, of which spelling forms only part.  [[Flashcard|"Look and say"]] form an image of a word without spelling.  [[Spelling#Methods used to teach and learn spelling|Spelling training]] may require children to write out lists of words repeatedly, or engage in competitive [[spelling bee]] tests. Such methods of instruction do not tend to improve students' understanding of the relationship between spelling and pronunciation on any words except those prescribed.

Instruction that emphasizes conventional spelling focuses on the [[phonics]] patterns and rules in English which are anyway intrinsically weak because of the complexity of the [[history of the English language]].  For example, children can be taught that when they hear the {{IPA|/k/}} sound at the end of a one-[[syllable]] word where a [[phonics|short vowel]] precedes the sound, the {{IPA|/k/}} sound will be spelled ''ck'' (as in ''stack'', ''wreck'', ''stick'', ''rock'', and ''stuck'').  A similar pattern holds for the {{IPA|/dʒ/}} sound spelled ''dge'' (as in ''badge'', ''wedge'', ''bridge'', ''lodge'', and ''budge'') and the {{IPA|/tʃ/}} sound spelling ''tch''.

The same is also applicable for the process of learning acronyms. It is acceptable to use the inventive spelling of GBOL or ''Jeebol'' which can in turn be written as ''Jeeball''.

Once children learn these phonics patterns, they can apply them to words.  When children make errors, the teacher does not merely tell them they are wrong; the teacher, to the extent possible, returns the child's attention to the relevant rule or pattern.

There are also [[sight word]]s that do not follow patterns; children need to memorize conventional spellings for these words, such as ''who''.

==Benefits and costs==

===Benefits===

Whether teachers encourage children to use inventive spellings or not, analyzing them has several key advantages:
* Children's invented spellings help teachers understand what students know and do not know about the phonetic structure of the language.
* Sophisticated spelling, even if it is not conventional, may indicate strong [[phonological awareness]].
* Examining invented spellings may help researchers understand the development of phonological awareness and understanding of [[sound-symbol correspondence]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fcrr.org/Curriculum/.../Arndt_IDA2009_StudentsasSpellers.ppt&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aft.org/pdfs/americaneducator/winter0506/Moats.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

For those teachers who emphasize constructivist, inventive spellings, there are further advantages:
* Children who are allowed to spell inventively may learn an earlier appreciation for [[writing]].
* Children who spell inventively may be more creative in their writing because they focus less on form. They may also use more complicated and precise words that occur in their oral vocabulary but that they do not yet know how to spell, helping them communicate their ideas more fully.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kappanmagazine.org/content/92/7/57.abstract&lt;/ref&gt;

The above two suppositions on the benefits of inventive spelling have not been empirically verified and are not generally accepted by neurolinguists, who study the natural learning process of spoken language and have recently determined that reading and spelling are not "hard-wired", natural processes.

===Costs===
Permitting or encouraging children to spell inventively has some costs.
* According to some research, children may learn to spell correctly faster if they are taught to do so in a direct and systematic way.
* Encouraging inventive spelling may delay children's conventional spelling development.
* Early excitement about writing may give way to later frustration when students feel a lack of confidence about their misspellings.
* Some students like to spell things correctly and may resist attempts to get them to spell inventively.
* Practising bad spelling habits ingrains them and makes them difficult to overcome, while spelling correctly from the beginning eliminates this problem.

{{Jews and Judaism sidebar}}
'''Judeo-Malayalam''' is the traditional language of the [[Cochin Jews]] (also called '''Malabar Jews'''), from [[Kerala]], in southern [[India]], spoken today by a few dozens of people in [[Israel]] and by probably fewer than 25 in India.

Judeo-Malayalam is the only known [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]] [[Jewish languages|Jewish language]]. (The only other Dravidian language spoken regularly by a Jewish community is [[Telugu language|Telugu]], spoken by the small, and only very newly observant Jewish community of east-central [[Andhra Pradesh]].  ''See related article:  [[Telugu Jews]]''.)

Since it does not differ substantially in [[grammar]] or [[syntax]] from other colloquial [[Malayalam language|Malayalam]] dialects, it is not considered by many linguists to be a [[language]] in its own right, but a [[dialect]], or simply a language variation. Judeo-Malayalam shares with other Jewish languages like [[Ladino (language)|Ladino]], [[Judeo-Arabic]] and [[Yiddish]], common traits and features. For example, verbatim translations from Hebrew to Malayalam, archaic features of Old Malayalam, Hebrew components agglutinated to Dravidian verb and noun formations and special idiomatic usages based on its Hebrew loanwords. Due to the lack of long-term scholarship on this language variation, there is no separate designation for the language (if it can be so considered), for it to have its own language code (''see also [[SIL International|SIL]] and [[ISO 639]]'').

Unlike many [[Jew]]ish languages, Judeo-Malayalam is not written using the [[Hebrew alphabet]]. It does, however, like most Jewish languages, contain a large number of [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] [[loanword]]s, which are regularly transliterated, as much as possible, using the [[Malayalam script]]. Like many other Jewish languages, Judeo-Malayalam also contains a number of [[vocabulary|lexical]], [[phonology|phonological]] and [[syntax|syntactic]] archaisms, in this case, from the days before Malayalam became fully distinguished from [[Tamil language|Tamil]].

In spite of claims by some Paradesi Jews that their ancestors' [[Judaeo-Spanish|Ladino]] influenced the development of Judeo-Malayalam, so far no such influence, not even on the superficial lexical level, is found. There is, however, affiliation with [[Mappila Malayalam]], especially of North Malabar, in words such as ''khabar'' or ''khabura'' (grave), and formations such as ''[[wikt:mayat|mayyatt]] āyi'' (മയ്യത്ത് ആയി) used by Muslims and ''[[shalom|śalōṃ]] āyi'' (ശലോം ആയി) used by Jews for ''died'' (മരിച്ചു പോയി, ''mariccu pōyi'' in standard Malayalam). As with the parent language, Judeo-Malayalam also contains loanwords from [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] and Pali as a result of the long-term affiliation of Malayalam, like all the other Dravidian languages, with Pali and Sanskrit through sacred and secular Buddhist and Hindu texts.

Because the vast majority of scholarship regarding the Cochin Jews has concentrated on the ethnographic accounts in English provided by [[Paradesi Jews]] (sometimes also called ''White Jews''), who immigrated to Kerala from Europe in the sixteenth century and later, the study of the status and role of Judeo-Malayalam has suffered neglect. Since their emigration to Israel, Cochin Jewish immigrants have participated in documenting and studying the last speakers of Judeo-Malayalam, mostly in Israel. In 2009, a documentation project was launched under the auspices of the [[Ben-Zvi Institute]] in Jerusalem. Digital copies can be obtained for any scholar who wishes to study Judeo-Malayalam.

'''''Just Cause 3''''' is an [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] [[video game]] developed by [[Avalanche Studios]] and published by [[Square Enix]]. Announced on November 11, 2014, it is the third game in the [[Just Cause (video game series)|''Just Cause'' series]] and the sequel to 2010's ''[[Just Cause 2]]''. It was released worldwide on December 1, 2015 for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]].

Set six years after its predecessor, ''Just Cause 3'' follows series protagonist Rico Rodriguez as he returns to his homeland of Medici, a fictional [[Mediterranean]] [[island country]] under the control of dictator General Sebastiano Di Ravello. The game is played from a [[Virtual camera system#Third-person view|third-person perspective]] and allows players to explore the island of Medici in an [[open world]] environment.

''Just Cause 3'' received mixed reviews; critics praised its open-ended gameplay, destruction mechanics and emphasis on player agency, while criticism was directed at its narrative, which some considered clichéd and uninspired, and performance issues, particularly on the console versions of the game.

A sequel, ''[[Just Cause 4]]'', is set for release on December 4, 2018.

== Gameplay ==

''Just Cause 3'' is an [[action-adventure game]], played from a [[Virtual camera system#Third-person view|third-person perspective]]. It is set in an [[open world]] environment of a fictional Mediterranean island known as Medici with Rico Rodriguez set as the protagonist.

Other game mechanics have been overhauled and updated.

However, this affects difficulty; for example, if the player chooses to ride a tank, the enemy AI matches the power of it and adopts weapons that are able to take down a tank.&lt;ref name="PCGamer-JC3" /&gt; Another new feature is giving the character infinite C4. The C4 can be placed free over the world by the player but only three at a time, though by using the in-game featured 'mods', up to five can be deployed. Unlike previous installments that required players to purchase C4, ''Just Cause 3'' instates this weapon to allow for more chaos.&lt;ref name="PCGamer-JC3" /&gt; In ''[[Just Cause 2]]'' players were able to stand on top of moving vehicles but only in the center; players are allowed to move around on vehicles freely in ''Just Cause 3''.&lt;ref name="GI Feature 2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2014/11/19/freeform-chaos-hands-on-with-just-cause-3.aspx|title=Freeform Chaos: Hands-On With Just Cause 3|first=Ben|last=Reeves|work=[[Game Informer]]|date=November 19, 2014|accessdate=June 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Players are expected to liberate hostile military bases and towns featured in the game, and they will act as fast travel locations thereafter.&lt;ref name="GI Feature 1" /&gt;

Despite the multiplayer mod of ''Just Cause 2'' being well received by players, the game only featured asynchronous multiplayer, in which challenges and leaderboards were included instead of any [[cooperative gameplay|cooperative]] or competitive multiplayer mode, as the studio wanted to focus their manpower, time and resources in creating the game's world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2014/11/17/will-just-cause-3-have-a-multiplayer-mode.aspx|title=Just Cause 3 Won't Launch With Multiplayer, But Don't Give Up Hope|first=Ben|last=Reeves|work=[[Game Informer]]|date=December 17, 2014|accessdate=June 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
Six years after the events of ''[[Just Cause 2]]'', mercenary Rico Rodriguez returns to his homeland of Medici, a fictional [[Mediterranean]] [[island country]] that has fallen under the control of a military dictatorship led by General Sebastiano Di Ravello. Seeking to restore freedom to his people, Rico sets out to overthrow Di Ravello alongside an underground resistance movement led by his oldest friend, Mario Frigo.&lt;ref name="PCGamer-JC3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/why-you-should-be-excited-about-just-cause-3/|title=Why you should be excited about Just Cause 3|last=Kelly|first=Andy|publisher=[[PC Gamer]]|date=February 12, 2015|accessdate=February 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After helping Mario save his forces from complete extermination at the hands of the regime, Rico reunites with another old ally from his past, Dimah al-Masri. With his help, the rebels retake the former Medician capital of Manaea and destroy the Vis Electra power plant, a symbol of Ravello's power. In response, troops are sent to destroy the coastal town of Costa del Porto as retribution, only to be defeated by the rebels. Dimah and her team inform Rico and Mario that Di Ravello has been mining Bavarium, a valuable mineral found only on Medici, so that he can use it to build the most powerful arsenal the world has ever seen.

While retrieving an experimental scanner for Dimah, Rico discovers his former Agency contact, Tom Sheldon, is also working with the rebellion. As he does not trust Sheldon to have the rebels's interests in mind, he sabotages the scanner before delivering it to him. Mario assigns Rico to rescue Zeno Antithikara, a Bavarium researcher seeking to defect from the regime. In response, Di Ravello has one of his new Bavarium missiles fired directly into the heart of rebel territory, the province of Baia. At the last second, Rico is able to manually maneuver the missile off its course and crash it into Di Ravello’s command base on the southern islands at the top of the mountain Cima Leon. The rebels hold a celebration, during which Rico arrives with wine stolen from Di Ravello's estate.

A few months later, the regime sends a small fleet to kill Mario and Dimah while they are out at sea. In the process of saving them, Rico meets Annika and Teo, a pair of South African smugglers waging their own war on Di Ravello. After Mario sustains a serious wound during the fight, Annika offers to aid the rebellion in exchange for Rico's help in stealing Di Ravello's Imperators, tanks equipped with protective shields powered by Bavarium. In addition to destroying a number of the tanks, Rico also helps the smugglers destroy the regime's Bavarium refineries and mines, as well as test out an experimental EMP device created using technology from the Imperators. However, the rebels begin to suffer a series of defeats on the battlefield, which Rico attributes to a mole in their ranks. In a push to wipe out the rebellion, Di Ravello orders a full-scale attack on Mario's coastal hideout. Rico rallies the rebels to defeat the invasion forces, reducing Di Ravello's control to only one region of Medici after igniting an unstable reactor at another command base at Corda Dracon.

Rosa Manuela, a Medician politician and old rival of Di Ravello's, returns to Medici to form a government opposed to his regime. At the same time, Zeno is identified as the mole. With help from the smugglers, Rico destroys a train carrying Bavarium for export and frees the prisoners working in Di Ravello's last remaining mines. With Sheldon and Dimah, he also prevents Di Ravello from selling a Bavarium bomb by detonating the bomb inside the plane transporting it. Afterwards, Di Ravello orders the military to attack the rebel-held part of the wall, as a diversion to break Zeno out of jail. Zeno attempts to escape by helicopter, but Rico manages to kill him.

The rebels make a final push to end Di Ravello's rule by attacking his central command at Falco Maxime, during which Dimah sacrifices herself to wipe out all known information about Bavarium, including herself. With his forces in disarray, Di Ravello confronts Rico in an active volcano, piloting his personal Urga Mstitel helicopter. After destroying the chopper, the player is given the choice to shoot Di Ravello dead. If they wait too long, he will commit suicide by throwing himself into a lava pit. Rosa forms a new Republic of Medici, assuming the office of President.

== Development ==
The development of ''Just Cause 3'' began in 2012,&lt;ref name="VentureBeatInterview"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2015/06/16/just-cause-3-creators-says-we-need-not-so-serious-shooters-interview/|title=Just Cause 3 creators say we need silly shooters, too|first=Dean |last=Takahashi|work=[[VentureBeat]]|date=June 16, 2015|accessdate=June 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was handled by Avalanche Studios' satellite studio in New York, which has around 75 staff members, while the main studio in Sweden focused on the development of ''[[Mad Max (2015 video game)|Mad Max]]'', which was announced in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/2/12/5404214/just-cause-3-avalanche-studios|title=Just Cause, Mad Max and the future of Avalanche Studios|first=Brian |last=Crecente|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=February 12, 2014|accessdate=June 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game's controls received an overhaul, and several members from [[Criterion Games]], the developer of the racing video game series ''[[Burnout (series)|Burnout]]'', joined the studios and worked on the vehicle handling of the game.&lt;ref name="GI Feature 1" /&gt; Inspiration for the game's asynchronous multiplayer was taken from racing games like ''[[Need for Speed]]'' and ''[[Forza Horizon 2]]'', while the "Destruction Frenzy" mechanic was inspired by the ''[[Red Faction (series)|Red Faction]]'' series.&lt;ref name="GRadarPreview" /&gt; Inspirations for the game were drawn from the modding community of ''Just Cause 2''. As a result, the upgrades featured in the game are called "mods".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/wreaking-havoc-in-just-cause-3s-playground-of-explosions-do-not-publish/#page-3|title=Wreaking havoc in Just Cause 3's playground of explosions|first=Samuel|last=Roberts|work=[[PC Gamer]]|date=June 17, 2015|accessdate=June 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When designing the game's world, the studio collected photo books of the Mediterranean area and sent a team to several Mediterranean islands to get a better glimpse of the area. The environment of the game is inspired by the landscape of [[Monaco]] and the southern Mediterranean area. Avalanche Studios considered such areas "an untapped resource" which no other developer had worked on before. In order to portray a world under dictatorship, the developers of the game established a color scheme composed of mainly grey, yellow, and red, to convey a sense of oppression.&lt;ref name="GI Feature 3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2014/11/26/how-avalanche-keeps-just-cause-3-vista-original.aspx|title=Exploring The Fictional World Of Medici In Just Cause 3|first=Ben|last=Reeves|work=[[Game Informer]]|date=November 26, 2014|accessdate=June 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The size of the game's world is similar to that of ''[[Just Cause 2]]'', but Avalanche promised that the content featured in the world would be "denser" than its predecessor.&lt;ref name="GSpot story"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/just-cause-3-dev-talks-world-size-destruction-and-/1100-6423646/|title=Just Cause 3 Dev Talks World Size, Destruction, And Story|first=Eddie|last=Makuch|work=[[GameSpot]]|date=November 17, 2014|accessdate=July 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental destruction is expanded in ''Just Cause 3'', as Avalanche considered it a key element in creating a cinematic experience and a mechanic to give players more freedom. The team also considered that with the advancements in technologies, they were able to add more destruction mechanics, which are of larger scale, to the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/why-just-cause-3-all-about-destruction-explained-avalanche/|title=Why Just Cause 3 is all about that destruction, as explained by Avalanche|work=[[Official Xbox Magazine]]|publisher=[[GamesRadar]]|date=July 3, 2015|accessdate=July 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview, the CEO of Avalanche Studios Christofer Sundberg stated that the game would continue to retain and expand ''Just Cause 2''{{'}}s joy and humor, and that the tone of the game would not be very serious, but slightly more so than that of ''Just Cause 2''.&lt;ref name="VentureBeatInterview" /&gt; He described the tone of the game "70 percent wacky and 30 percent serious".&lt;ref name="GSpot story" /&gt; The game's campaign explores the series' protagonist Rico Rodriguez's backstory, as the game is set in his motherland. His image was made more "approachable", in which he wears casual clothing like jeans throughout the game, as opposed to his uniform in the original ''[[Just Cause (video game)|Just Cause]]'' and ''Just Cause 2''. His gadgets and equipment were also made more realistic. The art director of the game explained that the studios "[wanted] just a touch of that [[James Bond]] agency feel [on Rico Rodriguez] without going too far into the goofy and outlandish like ''[[XXX (2002 film)|XXX]]'' starring [[Vin Diesel]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2014/11/24/the-changing-face-of-just-cause-3-the-evolution-of-rico.aspx|title=The Face Of Just Cause 3: The Evolution Of Rico|first=Ben|last=Reeves|work=[[Game Informer]]|date=November 24, 2014|accessdate=July 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
A mysterious virus appears during the [[industrial revolution]] that transforms infected humans into {{nihongo|''Kabane''|カバネ||"corpses"}} and rapidly spreads. ''Kabane'' are aggressive, [[undead]] creatures that cannot be defeated unless the glowing heart, which is protected by a layer of lead, is pierced, or an important body part is completely severed (such as the head). Unfortunately, most melee weapons and the steam-pressure guns used by the {{nihongo|''[[samurai|bushi]]''|武士||"soldiers"}} are not very effective against them.

On the island country {{nihongo|[[Japan|Hinomoto]]|日ノ本}}, people have built fortress-like "stations" to shelter themselves from these creatures. People access the stations and transport wares between them with the help of {{nihongo|fortified steam locomotives|駿城|hayajirō}}. One day, a ''hayajirō'' hijacked by the ''Kabane'' crashes into Aragane Station and they overrun the city. A young engineer called Ikoma uses the opportunity to test with success his anti-''Kabane'' weapon, the {{nihongo|"piercing gun"|ツラヌキ筒|tsuranuki zutsu}}, but is infected in the process, although he manages to resist the virus and become a {{nihongo|''Kabaneri''|カバネリ}}, a human-''Kabane'' hybrid. Assisted by {{nihongo|Mūmei|無名||"Nameless"}}, another ''Kabaneri'' who appears to help them, Ikoma and the other survivors of the station board a ''hayajirō'' named {{nihongo|''Kōtetsujō''|甲鉄城||"Iron Fortress"}} and depart to seek shelter elsewhere, fighting the hordes of ''Kabane'' along the way.

:A young man who makes a living as a steamsmith at Aragane Station. He and his good friend Takumi developed a [[Captive bolt pistol|bolt gun-like]] weapon called a ''piercing gun'' in order to defeat the Kabane. When Aragane Station is invaded by Kabane, Ikoma is able to successfully test his piercing gun but is bitten by a Kabane in the process. He is able to prevent the virus from reaching his brain by blocking his carotid arteries, transforming him into a Kabaneri.

;{{nihongo|Mumei|無名}} 
: {{voiced by|[[Sayaka Senbongi]]|[[Janice Kawaye]]}}&lt;ref name="MainStaff"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Youmacon"/&gt;
:A mysterious and anonymous&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kanjijapanese.com/en/dictionary-japanese-english/mumei&lt;/ref&gt; girl who boards the hayajiro ''Kotetsujo'' and appears at Aragane Station. She is revealed to be a Kabaneri as well as a very strong and agile fighter, capable of killing dozens of Kabane with ease.  She became a Kabaneri through a surgical operation as the result of her brainwashing by Biba, making her believe unless she became stronger, she would also end up like her mother. Constant fighting can leave her sleepy and like Ikoma, she requires blood to stop herself from attacking other people.  Her birth name is {{nihongo|Hozumi|穂積}} and she was named Mumei by Biba when he "saved" her as a child.

:The Leader of the {{nihongo|Hunters|狩方衆|Karikatashū}} and the eldest son of the ''[[shōgun]]''. Charismatic, ruthless and manipulative, he inducted Mumei in his philosophy of strength superiority, where the weak don't deserve to live and should not even have the will to. He greatly resents his father for abandoning him and the 400,000 men he sent to fight on the front lines by essentially starving them of supplies. This made him develop his philosophy, making his purpose from that point to kill his father and show him how weak his fear made him. To do that he intends to destroy the Kongokaku (the ''shōgun''{{'}}s stronghold) using artificially created Kabaneri, and the blue blood he developed, making artificial hybrid colonies when injected with huge destructive power.

 |ShortSummary    = On the island country of Hinomoto, the hayajiro ''Kōtetsujō'', an armored train, is attacked by several Kabane, humans transformed into undead creatures by a viral infection, and the bushi defeat them. However, a bushi is bitten and he commits suicide to avoid being killed as a Kabane. At the train's destination, {{nihongo|Aragane Station|顕金駅}}, Ikoma, a steamsmith, is working on a powerful piercing gun to kill the Kabane. The ''Kōtetsujō'' arrives at Aragane Station and Ikoma steals some Kabane body parts. Kensho, the leader of the Yomogawa family, excuses Shimon and Mumei, two passengers from the mandatory Kabane inspection who are headed for Kongokaku. Ikoma is detained for insubordination, and is secretly visited by Mumei as she is intrigued by his personality and interest in the Kabane. Later, another hayajiro called {{nihongo|''[[Fusang|Fusō]]jō''|扶桑城}} arrives at the station. The defensive drawbridge is lowered, but the train is taken over by the Kabane who crash it into the defending wall, allowing them to attack the station. Ikoma flees to his home, lures a Kabane into the house and kills it with his bolt gun, but is bitten in the process and begins to transform into a Kabane. Using several painful and potentially fatal techniques, Ikoma stops his blood flow from carrying the virus to his brain. He successfully does so, reverting to his human form and passing out. Meanwhile Mumei kills a Kabane using a blade which forms the base of her shoe.

 |ShortSummary    = Ikoma, discovering that he has stopped the Kabane virus from infecting him, tells his fellow steamsmith Takumi of his success with his bolt gun and anti-virus technique. Meanwhile survivors of the Kabane attack fight a defensive battle within Aragane Station while seeking an opportunity to escape in the ''Kōtetsujō''. Mumei arrives dressed in battle gear and offers to clear the way so Yukina, the sole remaining engineer and an apprentice, can commander the ''Kōtetsujō''. She leaps into the midst of the Kabane and leads them away, killing several in the process. The remaining citizens then rush to board the train. Meanwhile Ikoma and Takumi attempt to board the train with his gun. Mumei detects something different about Ikoma and vouches for him so he can board the ''Kōtetsujō''. Ayame Yomogawa, Kensho's daughter, produces the special key to start the train's engine. Kurusu, one of the bushi, tells Mumei to defend the train's rear, but she refuses and falls asleep. While fending off a Kabane, Ikoma's infected heart is exposed and he is eventually forced off the ''Kōtetsujō''. However, the train is stopped by a malfunction of the drawbridge, and the passengers witness Ikoma killing the Kabane. Lecturing the passengers for their distrust, Ikoma manually releases the drawbridge allowing the train to leave. Despite the bushi's objections, Takumi and Mumei get Ikoma back on the ''Kōtetsujō''. Before Kurusu can kill him, Mumei intervenes and reveals that she and Ikoma are Kabaneri - beings with an existence between humans and Kabane.

The ''Kōtetsujō'' is headed for Kongokaku, the ''shōgun''{{'}}s greatest stronghold and Mumei insists on staying onboard. However, the passengers are filled with alarm and distrust because of a lack of food and water, doubt whether they will be admitted into Kongokaku, and presence of the Kabaneri accompanying them. Mumei reveals that she has a mission and needs help from him because she gets exhausted after fighting. She begins training Ikoma personally in preparation for future Kabane attacks. The train has to stop for water and repairs, and the passengers take the opportunity to pray for those who died at Aragane Station. Ikoma tells Mumei that he has vowed to avenge his sister's death at the hands of the Kabane and a green stone tied to his palm which seems to have some effect on the Kabane. Mumei reveals that Kabaneri can only survive by drinking human blood, and later kills a pregnant woman who becomes a Kabane. Meanwhile, Ayame attacks Ikoma, but Ikoma tells her about his vow, appeasing the passengers' fears of the Kabaneri. However, Ikoma becomes delirious from his own need of blood and attacks Ayame.

Still fearful of the Kabaneri, the Six Chiefs, led by Akoji, has Ayame hand over the ''Kōtetsujō'''s Master Key. To Ayame's dismay, Akoji reroutes the ''Kōtetsujō'' for the mountains to provide a shorter route to Kongokaku, in spite of the increased danger posed by the Kabane on the exposed mountain path. Then, Akoji dispatches a chief to get Takumi and fellow steam smiths Kajika and Sukari to the ''Kōtetsujō''{{'}}s last car with Mumei and Ikoma, and detach the car. However, the Kabane, including by a sword-wielding Wazatori (a Kabane that has learned combat techniques and is thus much more dangerous), ambushes the ''Kōtetsujō'' and kills some of its passengers. Ayame, Kurusu and the bushi hold off the Kabane while the surviving passengers escape to the train's front. Using his sword-wielding skills, Kurusu fights the remaining Kabane inside the train at close quarters. Simultaneously, Mumei, Ikoma and their allies escape from their car and fight the Kabane, but Mumei falls asleep from exhaustion. Kurusu fights the Wazatori, but is injured in the process. With Ikoma in need of fresh blood, Ayame slashes her arm and replenishes him with her blood. After Ikoma kills the Wazatori, Ayame leads a cry of {{nihongo|"rokkon shōjō!”|六根清浄!}} to celebrate their victory. Ayame regains the Master Key and declares that she will allow the Kabaneri to stay aboard the Kōtetsujō, offering her blood to help sustain them. Ikoma’s friends and a number of others, including Kurusu, voluntarily join her.

Mumei meets Enoku, a crippled fighter still loyal to her brother the Young Master. He warns her that the shogunate is acting suspiciously by stockpiling weapons and advises her to complete her mission. Debris blocks the tracks and the ''Kōtetsujō'' committee decide to use a crane to remove it. Ikoma suggest a cautious route to the crane but Mumei unexpectedly insists on a head-on clash with the Kabane. While Ikoma leads a group of engineers to start the crane, Mumei attacks the nest of Kabane single handed, estimating that she has 90 seconds of energy left. She defeats them, but before the working party can start the crane, even more Kabane appear. The crew retreat and Ikoma starts to lift the debris with the crane while Mumei uses her remaining energy to fight the horde of Kabane.  A weakening Mumei is then attacked by a Wazatori and Ikoma goes to her aid before he completes removing the debris. At that moment, a giant shadowy figure heads towards the train.

She runs to find Ikoma who is badly wounded, and they all return to the train together. While the Black Fog beast is distracted, feeding on the bodies of the dead Kabane, Ikoma removes the wreckage from the tracks. Mumei suggests a plan to kill the beast using everyone working together. The ''Kōtetsujō'' leaves the workshop with the beast in pursuit.

Biba offers a deal to Ayame that if she can open the gates to Kongokaku, and arrange a meeting with his father, he will guarantee the safety of her people. He tells her of the time when his father sent him with 400,000 troops to Kyushu to fight the Kabane, but when replacement supplies failed to arrive they were overrun and wiped out, for which he blames his father. Meanwhile Ikoma hatches a daring plan with some of the passengers to retake control of the hayajiro. Biba offers Mumei a chance to join his troops but she refuses and is forced to take captive vaccine and sedated. Ikoma's group starts their attack to take control of the ''Kōtetsujō'', but Biba had anticipated a counter-attack and confronts Ikoma, killing Takumi who sacrifices himself to save Ikoma. Biba then calls on Mumei to kill Ikoma. She obeys his order due to Biba's captive vaccine, stabbing Ikoma who falls from the hayajiro into a coast far below.

 |ShortSummary    = Ikoma is still alive, washed up on the shore and is found by Kurusu (who went missing in the previous attack). Biba injects Mumei with the same liquid that he used on Horobi to turn her into a Nue. The ''Kōtetsujō'' arrives at Kongokaku and announces that they have captured the men who destroyed Iwato Station so they are allowed entry. Ayame pretends to have Biba prisoner because her crew are being held hostage, and they are taken to meet the ''shōgun''. Biba tricks the ''shōgun'' into holding a sword tainted with the Kabane virus which turns him into a Kabane. Biba then kills him and announces to everyone that Kabane are among them, which creates a panic and people start killing each other out of fear. The Karikatashu take the ''Kōtetsujō'' into the city and release the Kabane, while Ayame escapes with the help of her uncle. Kurusu has one of Biba's scientists prisoner with knowledge about the Kabane virus. He says that Mumei can be saved once she becomes a Nue by injecting white plasma into her heart. Ikoma insists on being injected by black plasma to give him additional strength, although it will accelerate the Kabane virus and shorten his life. Mumei begins her transformation into a Nue to fulfill Biba's dream of destruction.

Ayame appeals to the humans to stop attacking each other in fear, and entreats them to leave Kongokaku with her people in the ''Kōtetsujō''. With Kurusu's help, Ikoma is able to reach the Mumei Nue. He destroys the hayajiro ''Kokujou'' in the process when the Hunters try to drive it into him with his additional powers since taking the black serum. Mumei seems to be unaware of what she's become, recalling memories from the past and imagining herself surrounded by butterflies. Ikoma reaches the Mumei Nue, but is intercepted by Biba who is revealed as a Kabaneri. Biba stabs Ikoma with his sword, but this does not kill him, and as he is about to try again, Ikoma recovers and blasts him with his bolt gun. Mumei appears to understand that Ikoma is near, and she allows him to inject her with the white serum, destroying the Nue and returning her to her previous form. Ayame and her people leave the smouldering city of Kongokaku in the hayajiro ''Kōtetsujō'' with Kurusu, Mumei and injured Ikoma are on board. Ikoma starts to recover thanks to a serum secretly given by Biba and the effects of the black serum seem to diminish. As an afterthought, Mumei hands him back his green stone.

[[File:Kamehameha I full 5110.png|thumb|right|''Kamehameha'' Statue that stands today in front of Ali{{okina}}iolani Hale]]{{Ref-improve|date=May 2018}}
Several '''''Kamehameha'' Statues''' honor the [[Kamehameha I|monarch]] who founded the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.aloha-hawaii.com/tours/kamehameha+statue/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-07-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224161423/http://www.aloha-hawaii.com/tours/kamehameha+statue/ |archive-date=2010-12-24 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Original work==
{{Main|Kamehameha statue (original cast)}}
The pictured statue stands  prominently in front of [[Aliiolani Hale|Ali{{okina}}iolani Hale]] in [[Honolulu, Hawaii]]. The statue had its origins in 1878 when [[Walter M. Gibson]], a member of the Hawaiian government at the time, wanted to commemorate the 100-year arrival of [[Captain Cook]] to the Hawaiian Islands. The legislature appropriated $10,000 for the project and made Gibson the director of the project, which originally included native Hawaiians but they soon were off the project and Gibson ran the project by himself. Gibson contacted [[Thomas R. Gould]], a Boston sculptor living abroad in [[Florence]], [[Italy]] to create the statue.

===Features===
Even though photographs of Polynesians had been sent to him so that Gould could make an appropriate likeness, he seemed to ignore them. A Roman nose and more European features were adopted. This is most likely due to the fact that Gould was in Italy studying Roman sculpture. The stance of a Roman general with gesturing hand, spear, and cape are also Roman appropriations. The belt or sash on the statue's waist is a symbolic rendering of the [[Sash of Liloa|Sacred Sash of Liloa]]. In 1880, the initial sculpture was sent to [[Paris]], France, to be cast in [[bronze]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://gohawaii.about.com/od/oahusights/ss/honolulu_walk_a_4.htm|title=Let's Take a Walk Around Historic Honolulu|work=TripSavvy|access-date=2018-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, historians have noted that from the photographs that were sent to Gould, certain features of the statues were influenced by Hawaiian brothers [[John Timoteo Baker]] and [[Robert Hoapili Baker]]. Two photographs of the former survive, one in its original form and another in the form composite with the bare legs of a Hawaiian fisherman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Adler|first=Jacob|title=Kamehameha Statue|journal=The Hawaiian Journal of History|location=Honolulu|publisher=Hawaiian Historical Society|volume=3|year=1969|hdl=10524/570|oclc=60626541|pages=203–212}}; {{cite journal|last=Rose|first=Roger G.|title=Woodcarver F.

During this time, David [[Kalākaua]] became king and was completing [[ʻIolani Palace]] which was his tribute to King [[Kamehameha I]] and to be the destination of the statue. The statue was too late for the 100th anniversary, but in 1883, the statue was placed aboard a ship and headed for Hawaii. Near the [[Falkland Islands]] the ship wrecked and the statue was thought lost. However, the Hawaiians had insured the statue for $12,000 and a second casting was quickly made.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.aoc.gov/cc/art/nsh/kamehameha.cfm|title=Kamehameha I|work=Architect of the Capitol {{!}} United States Capitol|access-date=2018-05-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Replicas===
{{See also|Kamehameha I (Gould)}}
[[File:Kamehameha statue Kohala.jpg|thumb|The first casting of the Gould statue, now at [[Kapaau, Hawaii|Kapa{{okina}}au]], North [[Kohala, Hawaii|Kohala]] ]]
Before the second statue could be sent, the original was recovered by some Falkland Islanders. They sold it to the Captain of the wrecked ship for $500, and the Captain then sold it to Gibson for $875. Now Hawaii has two statues. The original stands near the legendary king's birthplace in [[Kapaau|Kapa{{okina}}au]] in [[Kohala, Hawaii|Kohala]], on the [[Hawaii (island)|island of Hawai{{okina}}i]]. The re-ordered one stands in front of [[Aliiolani Hale|Ali{{okina}}iolani Hale]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hisurf.com/explorer/king_kam.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

A third replica was commissioned when Hawaii attained statehood and was unveiled in 1969. It stood in the [[United States Capitol]] alongside the [[Father Damien Statue|''Father Damien'' Statue]] and was the heaviest statue in [[Statuary Hall]], weighing 15,000 pounds. In 2008, shortly after Hawaii-born [[Barack Obama]] was nominated as the Democratic Party’s candidate for the presidency, the statue was moved from a dark, back row of Statuary Hall to a prominent position in Emancipation Hall in the Capitol's new visitor center.

The Gould statue can be briefly seen in the opening credits of the original 1960s TV police drama ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'' as well as the [[Hawaii Five-0 (2010 TV series)|2010 series reboot]]. The statue is also seen multiple times in a three-part series of ''[[Sanford and Son]]'' when the duo go on a vacation to [[Hawaii]]. The statue is seen on a [[pedestal]] outside the Hawaii Police Department Headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.to-hawaii.com/oahu/attractions/kamehamehastatue.php|title=King Kamehameha Statue, Oahu|website=www.to-hawaii.com|access-date=2018-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Big Island==
[[Image:Kamehameha statue Wailoa River, Hilo.jpg|thumb |alt=statue with palm trees |The statue in [[Hilo, Hawaii]] ]]
Another ''Kamahameha'' statue resides on the [[Hawaii (island)|island of Hawai{{okina}}i]] (known locally as the Big Island). It stands near downtown [[Hilo]] at the north end of the [[Wailoa River State Recreation Area]], where it enjoys a king's view of [[Hilo Bay]]. The {{convert |14 |ft |sing=on}} statue was sculpted by R. Sandrin at the Fracaro Foundry in [[Vicenza]], Italy in 1963 but was not erected on this site and dedicated until June 1997. The statue was originally commissioned for $125,000 by the [[Princeville, Hawaii|Princeville]] Corporation for their resort in [[Kauai]]. However, the people of Kauai did not want the statue erected there, as Kauai was never conquered by King Kamehameha I. Hilo, however, was one of the political centers of King Kamehameha I. Consequently, the Princeville Corporation donated the statue to the Big Island of Hawaii via the Kamehameha Schools Alumni Association, East Hawaii Chapter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://karakullake.blogspot.com/2009/10/5-king-kamehameha-statues.html|title=5 King Kamehameha Statues|date=2009-10-17|website=Tamerlane's Thoughts|access-date=2018-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kane work==
The Grand [[Wailea, Hawaii|Wailea]] Resort Hotel &amp; Spa on [[Maui]] is the home of a fifth ''Kamehameha'' statue. Hawaiian artist, author and historian [[Herb Kawainui Kane]] created the nine-and-a-half-foot work, which presides over the entrance of the hotel, facing the porte cochere. It is purported to be the most lifelike representation of the great warrior king.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.discoveramerica.com/ca/hawaii/big-isl-king-kamehameha-statue.html|title=VisitTheUSA.com Homepage|website=Visit The USA|access-date=2018-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Las Vegas Statue==
 
There was a sixth statue in Las Vegas, NV, along the Strip at the Hawaiian Marketplace. It was removed in January 2014 to make way for a [[Chili's]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://vegas.eater.com/2014/1/21/6294141/king-kamehameha-departs-the-hawaiian-marketplace|title=King Kamehameha Departs the Hawaiian Marketplace|last=Martin|first=Bradley|date=January 21, 2014|work=Eater Vegas|access-date=2018-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kamehameha Day==
Every year on or near the June 11 [[Kamehameha Day]] holiday, ''Kamehameha'' statues are ceremoniously draped in fresh lei fashioned in Hawai{{okina}}i. The event is celebrated in the United States Capitol with traditional [[hula]] performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hawaiiforvisitors.com/events/king-kamehameha-day.htm|title=King Kamehameha Day Events in Hawaii|website=www.hawaiiforvisitors.com|access-date=2018-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6884">{{linguistics}}
The term "'''linguistic ecology'''" (also known as "'''ecolinguistics'''" or "'''language ecology'''") was first used in an article on the "language situation" in Arizona (Voegelin, Voegelin and Schutz, 1967).

==Description==
It was taken up by [[Einar Haugen]], who pioneered a form of [[linguistics]] which used the metaphor of an ecosystem to describe the relationships among the diverse forms of language found in the world, and the groups of people who speak them. Linguistic ecology looks at how languages interact with each other and the places they are spoken in, and frequently argues for the preservation of [[endangered language]]s as an analogy of the preservation of [[biological species]].

Linguistic ecology has often been described as a form of [[ecolinguistics]] (e.g., in Fill and Mühlhäusler). However, some claim that this is more properly considered a form of sociolinguistics, since the focus is on humans and language, rather than the life-sustaining interactions of humans, other species and the physical environment. Steffensen (2007) has argued that separation of the metaphorical 'linguistic ecology' from ecolinguistics would be reductionist, because high [[linguistic diversity]] is associated with high [[biological diversity]] (see Bastardas-Boada 2002). The relationship between linguistic diversity&lt;ref&gt;(Esperanto with English subtitles) Evildea, ''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5xdm1HcVdE Ĉu Esperanto savos aŭ estingos la aliajn lingvojn ?]'' (Will Esperanto save or extinguish the other languages), YouTube&lt;/ref&gt; and biodiversity is claimed to arise since local ecological knowledge is built into local language varieties and threatened if the local language is threatened by a more dominant language (see Mühlhäusler 1995). 

Linguistic ecology is represented by the journal ''Language Ecology'' which describes the field as follows:

"The ecology of language is a framework for the study of language as conceptualised primarily in Einar Haugen's 1971/72 work, where he defines language ecology as "the study of interactions between any given language and its environment". It was a reaction to the abstract notion of language – as a monolithic, decontextualised, static entity – propagated by [[Chomsky]], and it was conceived as a broad and interdisciplinary framework. In his use of 'ecology' as a metaphor from biology in linguistics, Haugen formulated ten questions which together comprehensively address factors pertaining to the positioning of languages in their environment. Each of these relates to a traditional sub-field of the study of language – encompassing historical linguistics, linguistic demography, sociolinguistics, contact, variation, philology, planning and policy,&lt;ref&gt;Hult, F.M. (2010).  Analysis of language policy discourses across the scales of space and time. ''International Journal of the Sociology of Language, 202'', 7-24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hornberger, N.H., &amp; Hult, F.M. (2008). Ecological language education policy. In B. Spolsky &amp; F.M. Hult (Eds.), ''Handbook of educational linguistics'' (pp. 280-296). Malden, MA: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; politics of language, [[ethnolinguistics]],&lt;ref&gt;Hult, F.M. (2009). Language ecology and linguistic landscape analysis. In E. Shohamy &amp; D. Gorter (Eds.), ''Linguistic landscape: Expanding the scenery'' (pp. 88-104). London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; and typology – and each of them intersects with one or more of the other sub-fields.

==Summary==
Taken together, answering some or all of these questions is part of the enterprise of the ecology of language. Since then the notion of ecology in linguistics has evolved to address matters of social, educational,&lt;ref&gt;Hult, F.M.  (2012). Ecology and multilingual education. In C. Chapelle (Gen. Ed.), ''Encyclopedia of applied linguistics'' (Vol. 3, pp. 1835-1840).  Malden, MA: Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; historical and developmental nature. With the development of ecology as a special branch of biology, and issues of the 20th and 21st centuries such as migration, hybridity and marginalisation coming to the fore, the notion of language ecology plays an important part in addressing broad issues of language and societal change, endangerment, human rights, as well as more theoretical questions of classification and perceptions of languages, as envisaged in Haugen's work" (''Language Ecology'' 2016).

'''Ludwig Joseph Brentano''' ({{IPAc-en|b|r|ɛ|n|ˈ|t|ɑː|n|oʊ}}; {{IPA-de|bʁɛnˈtaːno|lang}}; 18 December 1844 – 9 September 1931) was an eminent [[Germany|German]] [[economics|economist]] and social reformer.

==Biography==
{{unsourced|section|date=August 2017}}
Lujo Brentano, born in [[Aschaffenburg]] into a distinguished German Roman Catholic intellectual family (originally of [[Italy|Italian]] [[Cultural heritage|descent]]),&lt;ref&gt;Lujo Brentano was the son of the writer [[Christian Brentano]], nephew of writers [[Clemens Brentano]] and [[Bettina von Arnim]], two major figures in the romantic movement in German literature, and the brother of [[Franz Brentano]], a philosopher whose students included [[Edmund Husserl]], [[Alexius Meinong]] and [[Sigmund Freud]], among others.&lt;/ref&gt; attended [[school]] in [[Augsburg]] and [[Aschaffenburg]]. He studied in [[Dublin]] ([[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity College]]), [[Münster]], [[Munich]], [[Heidelberg]] (doctorate in law), [[Würzburg]], [[Göttingen]] (doctorate in economics), and Berlin ([[habilitation]] in economics, 1871).

He was a professor of [[economics]] and state sciences at the [[university|universities]] of [[Breslau]], [[Strasbourg]], [[Vienna]], [[Leipzig]], and most importantly, Munich (1891–1914). With [[Ernst Engel]], the statistician, he made an investigation of the [[England|English]] [[trade union]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite NIE|wstitle=Brentano, Lujo|year=1905}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1914, he signed the [[Manifesto of the Ninety-Three]]. After the [[German Revolution of 1918–1919|revolution of November 1918]], he served in minister-president [[Kurt Eisner]]'s government of the [[People's State of Bavaria]] as People's Commissar (Minister) for Trade, but only for some days in December 1918.{{cn|date=August 2017}}

Brentano died in Munich in 1931, aged 86.{{cn|date=August 2017}}

==Legacy==
Brentano was a ''[[Kathedersozialist]]'' (reform-minded) and a founding member of the [[Verein für Socialpolitik]]. His influence on the [[social market economy]], and on many Germans who would be leaders just after the end of [[World War II]], can hardly be overrated. He also influenced later economists, such as his doctoral student [[Arthur Salz]].

Note: It is often mistakenly claimed that Brentano was called Ludwig Joseph, and that "Lujo" was a kind of nickname or contraction. This is incorrect; while he was given his name after a [[Ludwig (given name)|Ludwig]] and a [[Joseph (name)|Joseph]], Lujo was his real and legal [[first name]]. (See his autobiography, ''Mein Leben...'', below, p.&amp;nbsp;18.)

'''''Magazeta''''' ({{lang-ru|Магазета}}) is a popular Russian-language [[Online magazine|web-magazine]] and [[collaborative blog]] on [[China]] and [[Chinese culture]].

==Name and history==
Founded in 2005 by Alexander Maltsev (马玉玺, Mǎ Yùxǐ), ''Magazeta'' developed from a [[Livejournal|LJ]] blog. The first publication is dated October 23, 2005.

In October 2006 ''Magazeta'' received two awards in [[The BOBs (weblog award)|The Best of Blogs]] competition.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,2236051,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2007, ''Magazeta'' is re-launched at the current address, [http://magazeta.com magazeta.com].

''Magazeta'' was initially authored by a single person, but then was transformed into a collaborative blog with a number of authors.

A '''mashk''' ([[Hindi language|Hindi]]: मश्क) - ([[Urdu]]: مشک) or '''mashq''' (मश्क़, مشق) is a traditional water-carrying bag, usually made of waterproofed [[Goatskin (material)|goat-skin]], from [[North India]], [[Pakistan]] and [[Nepal]].&lt;ref name="ref13lixaf"&gt;{{Citation | title=Beast and man in India: a popular sketch of Indian animals in their relations with the people | author=John Lockwood Kipling, Rudyard Kipling | publisher=Macmillan and Co., 1891 | isbn= | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NPPaAAAAMAAJ | quote=''... When filled with water merely, the goat-skin or "mashk" is a characteristic object ...''}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''Mashqs'' can vary in size, from a hand-held bag, which was often used to carry liquids such as [[alcohol]], to a large man-sized bag that comes with shoulder strap. They usually have only one narrowed opening. A person who is carrying a large ''mashq'' is called a ''māshqi'' (माश्क़ी, ماشقی). Traditionally, in the northern part of the [[South Asia]], the larger ''mashq'' was associated with the ''[[Bhishti]]'' (भिश्ती, بهِشتی) [[Caste|subcaste]] who were employed as water-carriers by all other sections of society and often seen dispensing water (for a fee) in public places, gardens and construction sites.&lt;ref name="ref77lixip"&gt;{{Citation | title=Modern Colloquial Hindustani | author=J.

Water-Carrier - Bhishti ... ek mashk kitne ko ata hai ... Get the bhishti to pour some water ...''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since water came as a great relief to people and plants during the hot summer in the northern Indian plains, the term ''Bhishti'' derives from the [[Persian language|Persian]] root word ''bahishti'', meaning ''heavenly''.&lt;ref name="ref56fexev"&gt;{{Citation | title=The Times of India directory and year book including who's who, Volume 28 | author= | publisher=Bennett and Coleman, 1941 | isbn= | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RakSAAAAIAAJ | quote=''...

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="39774">'''Merit pay''', merit increase or pay for performance, is [[performance-related pay]], most frequently in the context of [[educational reform]] or government [[civil service]] reform (government jobs). It provides bonuses for workers who perform their jobs effectively, according to easily measurable criteria.  In the United States, policy makers are divided on whether merit pay should be offered to public school teachers, and other public employees, as is commonly the case in the United Kingdom.

==History==
Merit pay's roots lie in [[behavioral psychology]] and incentive theory. These theories are based in the belief that people are rational and react to incentives and that you can increase performance with the correct catalyst.

One example of a system that uses merit-pay is the Teacher Advancement Program (TAP) created by the [[Milken Family Foundation]] in 1999. TAP is currently in place in more than 180 schools all across the United States. In this program, salary raises are based on some aspects of teacher performance, measured by a combination of observations and student test scores. TAP teachers can advance their career in three ways: (1) remain in the classroom and become a mentor to others, (2) leave the classroom and become a master teacher, or (3) advance to administration through traditional means. This program is focused on helping teachers improve performance by learning from others. Teachers are put into small groups that—for a few hours each week—collaborate about what's working in the classroom. The opportunity allows teachers to build skills that will improve classroom learning.

Since adopting TAP in 2001, Bell Street Middle School has doubled the percent of students with advanced scoring in math and reading. The school has also reduced the number of students scoring "below basic level of math" by 46 percent.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Another benefit of the TAP program for the middle school has been a reduction in teacher turnover from 32 percent to 10 percent.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

One criticism of TAP is that it is expensive for schools, costing from $250 to $400 per student per year.&lt;ref&gt;TAP Frequently Asked Questions http://tapsystem.org/action/action.taf?page=faq{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many TAP schools use grants to fund the program cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mathematica-mpr.com/education/tapchicago.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327231215/http://www.mathematica-mpr.com/Education/tapchicago.asp |archivedate=2012-03-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; An independent study conducted by Vanderbilt University researchers compared TAP schools' test score gains to non-TAP schools. TAP seems to do better at the elementary school level, but in fact does worse than non-TAP schools in grades 6 through 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Springer|first1=Matthew G.|last2=Ballou|first2=Dale|last3=Peng|first3=Art (Xiao)|title=Estimated Effect of the Teacher Advancement Program on Student Test Score Gains|journal=Education Finance and Policy|volume=9|issue=2|pages=193–230|doi=10.1162/EDFP_a_00129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the [[United States Congress]] created a $600 million [[federal grant]] program called the ''Teacher Incentive Plan'' (TIF). In 2009, the program was expanded and supported with [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009|American Recovery and Reinvestment Act]] (ARRA) funding. According to the [[U.S. Department of Education]], the TIF "supports efforts to develop and implement performance-based teacher and [[Head teacher|principal]] compensation systems in high-need schools." The program's goals include:
* (1) improving student achievement by increasing teacher and principal effectiveness
* (2) reforming teacher and principal compensation systems so that teachers and principals are rewarded for increases in student achievement
* (3) increasing the number of effective teachers teaching poor, minority, and disadvantaged students in hard-to-staff subjects
* (4) creating sustainable performance-based compensation systems (PBCSs)

A national evaluation of the TIF program has yet to be performed, but preliminary research has provided mixed results. According to an article by the [[Center for American Progress]], an evaluation of programs supported by TIF, such as Denver's ProComp program and the Nashville study (both discussed below), has shown initial evidence that performance-based pay has had a positive effect on student achievement.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} However, other evaluations, such as a study performed by the [[Vanderbilt University]] National Center on Performance Incentives in the metropolitan Nashville School System, have not confirmed the [[hypothesis]] that rewarding teachers for improved scores will cause scores to rise.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.semissourian.com/story/1666546.html Three-year study finds teacher bonuses fail to improve test scores.] By DORIE TURNER, The Associated Press, Southeast Missourian, September 22, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.vanderbilt.edu/2010/09/teacher-performance-pay/ Teacher performance pay alone does not raise student test scores], by Melanie Moran, Vanderbilt News, Sep. 21, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Denver]]'s ''Professional Compensation System for Teachers'' was approved by teachers and financially backed by Denver voters in 2004 and 2005, and it later received additional funding from a TIF grant in 2006. In this program, teachers are given nine ways to increase their earnings, such as working in a high-needs schools, exceeding expectations on state exams, meeting professional objectives set at the beginning of the year, receiving a worthy evaluation from a principal, and gaining "distinguished school" status by meeting mixed criteria such as parent satisfaction. In 2010, an evaluation report detailing effects of ProComp was issued. This report highlighted several key findings in both district-wide student achievement trends, as well as in student achievement outcomes relating to teacher hiring effects. On a district-wide level, the 2010 evaluation showed a substantial increase in [[mathematics]] and reading achievement from the immediate time period before ProComp's implementation compared to time period subsequent to the implementation. Additionally, teachers hired after the implementation of ProComp showed higher first-year achievement compared to those hired before the program's implementation.
 
The National Center on Performance Incentives conducted a three-year study in the metropolitan [[Nashville]] School System from 2006 through 2009, in which [[middle school]] mathematics teachers participated in an experiment to evaluate the effect of financial rewards for teachers whose students showed large gains on [[standardized test]]s. As stated in the study's final findings report, "The experiment was intended to test the notion that rewarding teachers for improved scores would cause scores to rise."{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} The results of the study did not confirm this hypothesis. Students of teachers assigned to the treatment group eligible for bonuses did not outperform students whose teachers were assigned to the control group that was not eligible for bonuses.

==Effort versus selection==
Most analyses of merit pay, including the Nashville Study, consider whether or not the existing teachers in a school perform better after being offered pay for performance. Scores might go up if teachers work harder or "work better." This situation, often called "increased effort," implies that teachers were not working as hard as they might before the performance pay was offered, and the lack of achievement results implies that the performance pay does not lead to increased effort. On the other hand, an additional feature of performance pay might be improved "selection" of who enters and who stays in teaching. For example, a different group of teachers might be induced to enter the teacher profession if pay was aligned more with performance. And, the best teachers, the ones who get the added performance pay, may on average be induced to stay in the classroom longer. These larger impacts through changes in selection would not show up on the evaluations previously conducted but can show up on overall comparisons of countries that do and do not employ performance pay systems. [[Ludger Woessmann]] finds evidence that performance pay does improve performance when viewed across countries.&lt;ref&gt;Ludger Woessmann, "Cross-country evidence on teacher performance pay." Economics of Education Review 30, no. 3 (June 2011): 404-418.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the analysis of the impact of dismissing ineffective teachers by [[Eric Hanushek]] can be interpreted as a special form of performance pay where pay is reduced to zero (or a very low amount) for teachers who do not perform well.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Hanushek]], "Valuing teachers: How much is a good teacher worth?" Education Next 11, no. 3 (Summer 2011)[http://hanushek.stanford.edu/publications/valuing-teachers-how-much-good-teacher-worth].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Loss aversion and merit pay==
{{Main|Loss aversion#Loss aversion within education}}
[[Loss aversion]] was first proposed by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky in 1979. They proposed the notion that individuals assign value to gains and losses rather than to final assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky|url=http://www.hss.caltech.edu/~camerer/Ec101/ProspectTheory.pdf|title=Prospect Theory: An Analysis of Decision under Risk|work=Econometrica|year=1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, individuals have a tendency to prefer avoiding losses rather than accruing gains.

This notion of people hating to lose, more than they like gaining something, even if the potential amount that could be lost is the same as the amount to be gained, has been tested in many arenas.

An experiment conducted by Kahneman et al. 1990 [https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2937761?uid=3739832&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21101473962151 Journal of Political Economy] describes testing loss aversion through the concepts of the [[Endowment effect]] and the [[Coase Theorem]]. The endowment effect reveals the notion that people place a higher value on objects they own relative to objects they do not. The Coase theorem focuses on transaction costs and the importance of who owns a particular commodity.

They found that randomly assigned owners of a mug required significantly more money to part with their possession (around $7) than randomly assigned buyers were willing to pay to acquire it (around $3). Kahneman attributed this result to loss aversion: owners were affected more by the loss of the mug compared to the effect of a buyer purchasing the mug as a gain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kahneman|first=Daniel |author2=Jack L. Knetsch |author3=Richard H. Thaler|title=Experimental Tests of the Endowment Effect and the Coase Theorem|journal=Journal of Political Economy|date=Dec 1990|volume=98|issue=6|pages=1325–1348|jstor=2937761|doi=10.1086/261737}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Another experiment conducted by Terrance Odean at Berkeley College examined the account of 10,000 investors at a large discount brokerage house. The tendency of investors revealed they held on to losing investments too long and sold winning investments too soon. Their behavior did not appear to be motivated by rational re-balancing of portfolios or to avoid higher trading costs. According to Odean, these investors held on to these losing stocks in order to prolong the feeling of loss from selling them, even though there was no evidence that by holding onto them, they would rise in value. "Winning investments that investors chose to sell continued in subsequent months to outperform the losing stocks investors kept."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Odean|first=Terrance|title=Are investors reluctant to realize their losses?|journal=The Journal of Finance|date=October 1998|volume=LIII|series=5|pages=1775–1798|url=http://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/odean/papers%20current%20versions/areinvestorsreluctant.pdf|doi=10.1111/0022-1082.00072}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits==
# Leads to better educational outcomes.
#: Proponents argue that paying teachers according to their effectiveness would be consistent with management precepts from the private sector and would lead to better educational outcomes. [[Lewis Solmon]], President of the TAP and a control group that merit pay contributes toward student achievement. The RAND study concluded that fifty percent of the schools with these reforms outperformed the control schools in math and forty-seven percent outperformed the control in reading.&lt;ref&gt;Solmon, Lewis. The Case for Merit Pay. In: Peterson, Paul. ed. ''Choice and Competition in American Education''. Lanham: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc. (2006). {{ISBN|0-7425-4581-4}} pg. 110&lt;/ref&gt;
# Helps low-performing schools attract teachers.
#: Schools that use merit pay are better able to attract teachers than schools with no merit pay system. This is especially helpful in enabling schools with lower socioeconomic status attract qualified teachers. For instance, a review of the Teacher Advancement Program [http://www.tapsystem.org/] in Arizona showed that over a three-year period, 61 teachers started working at the two schools of lowest socioeconomic status in the Madison school district, both of which use the TAP and of these teachers 21% have come from schools in high socioeconomic areas.&lt;ref&gt;Solmon, Lewis.

# Higher teacher retention rates.
#: Merit pay programs can also alleviate the problem of teacher retention. Stronge, Gareis and Little (2006) argue that merit pay or other performance pay programs provide added motivation for teachers in keeping novice teachers from leaving the profession after a few years and especially in retaining experienced teachers.&lt;ref&gt;Stronge, J., Gareis, C. &amp; Little, C.

# Show the value of a teachers work
#: Teachers who actually strive for their students to be better will show under the performance pay.
# Teachers will work harder to maintain their incentives
#: Higher scores will demonstrate a teacher's ability of going the extra mile.

==Detractors==
# Low teacher morale and increased competition between teachers.
# Wasted time and money in the administration of the merit pay plans.
# Little evidence from research that incentive programs lead to student achievement. 
:: In 1994 the [[Urban Institute]] conducted a study and found some positive short-lived effects of merit pay, but concluded that most merit pay plans "did not succeed at implementing lasting, effective ... plans that had a demonstrated ability to improve student learning." Problems included low teacher morale because of increased competition between teachers, as well as wasted time and money in the administration of the merit pay plans. The same study found "little evidence from other research...that incentive programs (particularly pay-for-performance) had led to improved teacher performance and student achievements."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Urban Institute Study of Merit Pay Systems | publisher = [[Pennsylvania State Education Association]] | url = http://www.psea.org/article.cfm?SID=165 | accessdate = 2007-08-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:: Marie Gryphon, an education policy analyst at the [[Cato Institute]], makes some practical objections:
::*The system can't simply reward high scores. If it did, it would favor teachers in wealthy neighborhoods whose students came to school with excellent skills. Nor can the system reward only improvement. If it did, it would unfairly penalize teachers whose students were already scoring too well to post large gains.
::*Moreover, any money for test results scheme will worsen the problem of teachers cheating on standardized tests to avoid the consequences of the [[No Child Left Behind Act]]. Teachers willing to erase wrong answers on exams to avoid having their school labeled "needing improvement" will also be tempted by the thought of a personal raise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Gryphon | first = Marie | title = Pair Merit Pay, School Choice | publisher = [[Cato Institute]] | date = 2005-02-18 | url = http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=3682 | accessdate = 2007-08-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Teachers may not feel the need to help one another and may feel they have to compete with one another.

# Merit pay may lead educators to become dishonest in order to receive the higher pay of higher test scores.

==Political opinions and implementation history==

===Teacher merit pay===
Some political figures support the merit-pay system as an effective policy for enhancing educational quality.

====Political reactions====
[[Jeb Bush]], governor of Florida during that time, enacted a 5 percent bonus for the top 25 percent of teachers in the state of Florida. A large factor in selection of the top 25 percent of teachers was student score improvement. A similar program was implemented in Houston at the same time, only lacking a limit on the percentage of teachers who could receive the bonus. Teachers in both states rebelled, stating that a year of instruction can't be measured in a single test, on a single day. These systems showed other imperfections as well. For example, a county in Florida ran out of money before all the teachers received bonuses. Accusations of discrimination also existed, a result of difference in pay between predominately black and predominately white schools.

President [[Barack Obama]] does support merit pay for teachers. He believes teachers' pay should be increased based on performance tests, not arbitrary tests. He wishes to work with the National Education Association (NEA) to find a new system to get rid of performance pay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Obama tells teachers he supports merit pay | publisher = INQUIRER | date = July 2008 | url = http://www.philly.com/philly/news/8335627.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite speech | first = Barack | last = Obama | date = 2009-03-10 | location = Washington, D.C. | url = http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Remarks-of-the-President-to-the-United-States-Hispanic-Chamber-of-Commerce | accessdate = December 17, 2009 | title = Archived copy | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20091221203009/http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Remarks-of-the-President-to-the-United-States-Hispanic-Chamber-of-Commerce/ | archivedate = 2009-12-21 | deadurl = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Performance pay for teachers would quadruple under bill approved by Hill | first = Nick | last = Anderson | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/12/12/AR2009121202691.html?referrer=emailarticle | newspaper = Washington Post | date = 2009-12-13 | accessdate = 2009-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Education Association (NEA) adamantly opposes some forms of merit pay. In June 2003 NEA President Reg Weaver said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Teachers understand that politically motivated panaceas such as merit pay and eliminating tenure do nothing to improve teacher quality. Our members are open to alternatives, but we will always oppose quick fixes designed to weaken the voice of teachers and effectiveness of education employees in all jobs.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In September 2011, President Obama took steps to reform certain unpopular and ineffective provisions of No Child Left Behind, stating, "Congress hasn't been able to do it, so I will.&lt;ref&gt;"https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/23/education/23educ.html?_r=4&lt;/ref&gt;  The most notable change to the law related to the 2014 deadline for all schools to bring their entire student body to "proficient" levels in reading and math.  The Obama administration offered a pass on the deadline and the opportunity to design their own accountability systems to some schools. The provisions that required failing schools to offer after-school tutoring and no-cost bus transportation to better schools were also waived.

In order to qualify for these waivers, however, states must demonstrate an adoption of "college and career ready" academic standards and deliver a sketch of how they plan to transform their lowest performing schools. States that apply for these waivers this fall can be reviewed by the Education Department early next year.  According to Eugene Wilhoit, executive director of the Council of Chief State School Officers, likely candidates for early application include Georgia, Kentucky, Wisconsin, and Colorado. Wilhoit believes that other states will also apply for the waiver after watching the process unfold for the states that apply early. Still, other states are not likely to apply at all, unwilling to disrupt current accountability systems when No Child Left Behind could soon be overhauled by Congress.

===Federal government merit pay===
&lt;!--[[Civil service]] links here--&gt;

====Clinton and Gore====
In early 1993, incoming President Bill Clinton—inheriting a federal government mired in recession and record debt—assigned his Vice President, Al Gore, to form a '''National Performance Review (NPR)''' panel to undertake a '''"Reinventing Government"''' initiative "to create a government that 'works better, costs less, and gets results Americans care about.'"&lt;ref name="npr_history2"&gt;Kamensky, John [http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/npr/whoweare/history2.html#1993 "National Partnership for Reinventing Government (formerly the National Performance Review):  A Brief History"], January 1999, [[National Partnership for Reinventing Government]], Washington, DC, as retrieved June 6, 2014, as retrieved June 6, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, with Executive Order 12862, the President called for a revolution in government's customer service to deliver services equal to the best in business.&lt;ref name="clinton_gore_blairhouse1997_01"&gt;Clinton, Bill, President &amp;amp; Vice President Al Gore, [http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/npr/library/papers/bkgrd/blair.html#reinvent ''"The Blair House Papers"''], National Performance Review (NPR),  January 1997, Blair House, Washington, DC, as retrieved June 6, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Working with David Osborne (noted co-author of the popular book ''[[Reinventing Government]]'') and leaders in government, business and organizational development, the committee made numerous recommendations, and developed implementation schemes for them.&lt;ref name="npr_history2" /&gt;  Among those was "'''III. Reinvent To Get The Job Done With Less - 9. Create Performance-Based Organizations (PBOs).'''"  The NPR's "Blair House Papers" explained that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Performance-Based Organizations (PBOs) are discrete management units that commit to clear objectives, specific measurable goals, customer service standards, and targets for improved performance.''' Once designated, they would have customized managerial flexibilities and '''a competitively hired chief executive, who would sign an annual performance agreement with the Secretary and have a share of his or her pay depend on the organization's performance.''' The British, who have extensive experience with this concept, find that such agencies improve performance and cut administrative costs.&lt;ref name="clinton_gore_blairhouse1997_01" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thus began the modern movement towards merit-based pay in U.S. federal civil service.  However, the NPR was clear that not all functions of government were suited to such performance-rewarded incentives:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In a PBO, the policy-making and regulatory functions are split from their program operations. The PBO focuses on programmatic operations. Not all government agencies are suited to become PBOs. Operations that do not have clear, measurable results should be excluded. For example, the foreign policy and planning offices in the State Department or basic scientific research offices at the National Institutes for Health may be inappropriate candidates.&lt;ref name="clinton_gore_blairhouse1997_01" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Subsequent efforts of the NPR (by 1999 renamed the "[[National Partnership for Reinventing Government]]") led to additional efforts to identify and apply effective and suitable ways to reward federal employee performance.&lt;ref name="clinton_gore_blairhouse1997_01" /&gt;

====Bush====
In 2004, Pres. [[George W. Bush]] and other Republicans favored shifting federal civilian employee salary pay raises from across-the-board uniform raises towards a merit-based pay system—particularly through a proposed system called the "...''Human Capital Performance Fund, which agencies can use to reward their highest performing employees,''..." according to a March, 2004 letter to Congress from the Bush administration's Director of the Office of Management &amp; Budget (OMB), Joshua Bolten. The Bush Budget Director's letter goes on to say:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The President's pay proposal provides sufficient pay not only to recruit and retain needed workers, but also to reward the government’s highest performing employees. The Administration is implementing better agency performance appraisal systems that will be able to distinguish superior performance. Such systems will enable agencies to reward employees with funds from the Human Capital Performance Fund. These incentives will produce improved performance and results for the American people. Federal workers should be rewarded with a pay policy that most effectively recruits, retains, and rewards quality employees.&lt;ref name="cong_rcd_2004-03-31"&gt;[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2004-03-31/pdf/CREC-2004-03-31-pt1-PgH1750.pdf "SENSE OF HOUSE REGARDING RULES OF COMPENSATION FOR CIVILIAN EMPLOYEES AND MEMBERS OF THE UNIFORMED SERVICES OF THE UNITED STATES,"] ''Congressional Record - U.S. House of Representatives,'' March 31, 2004, Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C., pages H1755-1756, as retrieved June 6, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Critics, particularly Democrats, especially from districts with high dependence on federal civilian employment (e.g.: around Washington, D.C., in adjoining Maryland and Virginia), expressed objections to the Bush administration's desire to allocate raises differently for civilian federal workers than for military personnel.&lt;ref name="cong_rcd_2004-03-31"/&gt;

====Obama====
Inheriting the merit pay programs instituted by the prior administration—along with two wars and the "Great Recession," and a divided Congress—Pres. [[Barack Obama]], and both parties in Congress, found difficulty in managing federal employee compensation.

Despite an official pay freeze, federal employee compensation continued to rise—owing in part to the merit pay ("pay-for-performance" or "employee bonus") system, but also due to promotions and to automatic scheduled increases in "completing waiting periods used in grade- and step-type pay systems." Chairman of the House Oversight &amp; Government Reform Committee, Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) claimed, "These increases are driven by automatic, tenure-based pay hikes that are in no way tied to merit or performance."&lt;ref name="washpost_fed_salary_2013_04_09"&gt;Yoder, Eric, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/04/09/despite-salary-rate-freeze-average-federal-salary-rises/ "Despite salary rate freeze, average federal salary rises,"] ''Washington Post'', April 9, 2013, Washington, D.C., as retrieved June 6, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Congressional Democrats and federal employees' unions responded that federal workers were not paid competitively with the private market, and the increases were overdue. Critics, however, and the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), concluded that federal workers earned substantially more than their counterparts in the private sector. A CBO report said overall average federal compensation was 16% higher than in for corresponding work in the private sector.&lt;ref name="washpost_fed_salary_2013_04_09" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cbo_2012_pay_report"&gt;Congressional Budget Office (CBO), [http://www.cbo.gov/publication/42921 '''"Report: Comparing the Compensation of Federal and Private-Sector Employees,"'''] January 30, 2012, Washington, D.C., retrieved June 6, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 27, 2012, Obama issued an executive order giving federal employees an across-the-board raise, estimated by Congressional Republicans as costing taxpayers "$11 billion over ten years." In response, in February, 2013, House Republicans passed H.R. 273 "Overturning the President’s Federal Pay Hike," to undo Obama's blanket federal pay hike.&lt;ref name="cantor_pay_freeze_2013_02_15"&gt;Cantor, Eric, Hon., House Majority Leader (R-VA), [http://majorityleader.gov/newsroom/print/2013/02/leader-cantor-applauds-house-passage-of-federal-pay-freeze.html "Leader Cantor Applauds House Passage of Federal Pay Freeze"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130223032227/http://majorityleader.gov/newsroom/print/2013/02/leader-cantor-applauds-house-passage-of-federal-pay-freeze.html |date=2013-02-23 }}, February 15, 2013, WASHINGTON, D.C, retrieved June 6, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;  However, underscoring their commitment to incentive-based compensation, they took pains to note that merit pay remained. In a "Fact Sheet" on the bill, the committee reported:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Federal Workers Still Get Raises''&lt;br&gt;
H.R. 273 '''does NOT prevent federal employees from receiving bonuses, merit based pay increases, promotions, or even tenure based pay increases – commonly referred to as “step” increases.'''  It simply prevents the President from implementing a planned across the board increase for all federal employees&lt;ref name="house_osight_hr273_fact"&gt;Committee on Oversight &amp;amp; Government Reform, U.S. House of Representatives, [http://oversight.house.gov/release/fact-sheet-h-r-273-overturning-the-presidents-federal-pay-hike "FACT SHEET: H.R. 273 - Overturning the President’s Federal Pay Hike"], February 14, 2013, Washington, DC, retrieved June 7, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Heritage Foundation====
Speaking for the leading conservative "think tank", the [[Heritage Foundation]], James Sherk, in testimony before the House Committee on Oversight &amp; Government Reform, March 9, 2011, blamed automatic raises for federal pay inflation, which he said surpassed private sector pay.

====Brookings Institution====
In late 2013, the leading liberal "think-tank," the [[Brookings Institution]], published research by analysts Choi and Whitford, who cautioned that—despite a shift of resources to merit-based pay for federal workers, intended to "better align pay and performance"—such efforts often fail, and such incentives "may not work" for "public organizations." However, rather than focus on the results of merit-based pay in "individual and organizational performance," Choi and Whitford focused, instead, on its effects on "job satisfaction," saying that is "often a good predictor of performance."  They studied federal government "findings" that indicated that subjecting federal employees to merit-based pay produces workers who are "consistently less happy" with their pay, their job and their organization, than those federal employees paid in "traditional compensation systems." Their report expresses concern that this could affect long-term outcomes.&lt;ref name="brookings_meritpay_2013"&gt;Choi, Sungjoo &amp;amp; Andrew B. Whitford, Paper: [http://www.brookings.edu/research/papers/2013/11/26-merit-based-pay-employee-motivation-federal-agencies "Merit-based Pay and Employee Motivation in Federal Agencies,"] from ''"SERIES: Issues in Governance Studies,"'' Number 60 of 63, November 26, 2013, Brookings Institution, Washington, D.C., retrieved June 6, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

====Veterans Health Administration scandal of 2014====
{{main|Veterans Health Administration scandal of 2014}}

The idea of merit pay receive a major discrediting blow from the Veterans Health Administration scandal of 2014 (still developing as of June 2014), which revealed nationwide altering of records by VA executives—particularly falsifying patient waiting lists and wait times, and the keeping of "secret" wait lists—to ensure receiving merit pay bonuses. Over 1,000 veterans have been reported affected, as of June 2014, with dozens having apparently died waiting for care. The scandal has become the leading U.S. domestic news story in April/May/June 2014, resulting in investigations by the VA Inspector General, Congress, and others. '''The VA's merit pay system and bonuses, and lack of scrutiny of their distribution, are the most frequently cited root cause for the problem''', as of June 2014.&lt;ref name="va_ig_report_2014_05_28"&gt;Griffin, Richard J., Acting Inspector General, [http://www.va.gov/oig/pubs/VAOIG-14-02603-178.pdf Interim Report: Review of Patient Wait Times, Scheduling Practices, and Alleged Patient Deaths at the Phoenix Health Care System], VA Office of Inspector General, Veterans Health Administration, Dept. of Veterans Affairs, May 28, 2014, 14-02603-178, Washington, D.C., retrieved June 7, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="usa_today_2014_05_31_va_audit"&gt;Giblin, Paul &amp;amp; Rebekah L.

The issue first became a major national topic when a doctor at the VA hospital in Phoenix reported that perhaps over 40 patients had died due to false and secret waiting-lists that delayed or prevented their care. Subsequent reports found similar allegations at many other VA medical facilities around the nation. Patient wait times were a metric used to determine executive bonuses, and it is alleged that the delays in care were concealed by wait list abuses in order to ensure that staff received bonuses.&lt;ref name="va_ig_report_2014_05_28" /&gt;&lt;ref name="usa_today_2014_05_31_va_audit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cnn_2014_05_30_va_wait_bonuses" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cbs_2014_05_13_va_bonuses" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cbs_2014_05_13_va_bonuses" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LA_Times_2014_06_04_ElPaso" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ap_2014_06_04_coats" /&gt;

Citing records obtained by [[OpentheBooks.com]] through a [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] (FOIA) request, [[Fox News]] reported that Employees at the Phoenix VA office were paid "millions in higher-than-average salaries and bonuses," adding that between 2011 and 2013, "over $843,000 in bonuses" were paid out to approximately "half the system's 3,170 workers". This averages to approximately $530 per rewarded employee, though bonuses varied widely and most employees did not receive any bonus money; Fox News reported that the Phoenix VA's Director, Sharon Helman, got the largest bonus in 2013 of $9,345.&lt;ref name="fox_2014_05_15_phx_va_bonuses"&gt;Walker, Emily Boyd, "[http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/05/15/phoenix-va-workers-pocketed-bonuses-hefty-salaries-despite-allegations/  Staff at embattled Phoenix VA pocketed bonuses, hefty salaries]," FoxNews.com, May 15, 2014, retrieved June 7, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="moore_heritage_2014_06_07_va_staff_bonuses"&gt;Moore, Stephen (chief economist at the conservative [[Heritage Foundation]] think-tank), "[http://dailysignal.com/2014/06/01/va-scandal-grows-bonuses-went-worst-hospitals/ Not Satire: Despite Waiting Lines, Some VA Employees Got Bonuses],"  ''The Daily Signal,'' June 1, 2014, as retrieved June 7, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent allegations and audits revealed the waiting list issue in Phoenix was not unique, but part of a wider, systemic problem in the VA nationwide, with secret waiting lists and related issues being uncovered at numerous other VA medical facilities, including in Chicago, Kansas City, Wichita, El Paso, and elsewhere.&lt;ref name="va_ig_report_2014_05_28" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cnn_2014_05_30_va_wait_bonuses" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cbs_2014_05_13_va_bonuses" /&gt;&lt;ref name="moore_heritage_2014_06_07_va_staff_bonuses" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kcstar_2014_06_04_va_scandal_midwest"&gt;Bavley, Alan, [http://www.kansascity.com/news/local/article480960/VA-scandal-grows-wider-in-Midwest.html "VA scandal grows wider in Midwest"] ''Kansas City Star,'' June 4, 2014 10:41 PM, updated June 5, 2014; retrieved June 13, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 30, 2014, President Obama accepted the resignation of Secretary of Veterans Affairs, Gen. Eric Shenseki, noting that...

&lt;blockquote&gt;A few minutes ago, Secretary Shinseki and Rob Nabors, who I’ve temporarily assigned to work with the VA, presented me with the department’s initial review of VA facilities nationwide. And what they’ve found is that '''the misconduct has not been limited to a few VA facilities, but many across the country.'''  That’s totally unacceptable."

Secretary Shinseki has now begun the process of firing many of the people responsible, including senior leaders at the Phoenix VA.  He’s '''canceled any possible performance bonuses this year for VHA senior executives.'''..."&lt;ref name="usa_today_2014_05_31_va_audit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="obama_2014_05_30_va_secy_resignation"&gt;Obama, Barack, President of the United States,"[http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/05/30/statement-president Statement by the President, May 30, 2014], Office of the Press Secretary, The White House, retrieved June 7, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

That informative surface is defined in base on the [[informative]] [[wikt:unit|unit]] of [[surface (mathematics)|surface]] &lt;math&gt;a_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; ( normally square ) whose amount of information is defined ad hoc.

== Presentation of the information ==

Metacube arises from the need to communicate and store the information in devices of increasingly smaller screen. This fact has influenced in other basic parameter, the [[wikt:portability|portability]]. We can view the information where and when we desire. This fact, is being transcendental in time to design the presentation of the information, because it obligates to iconography and to group a lot more (simple symbols or complexer combinatorials), this is, impels to synthesize concepts to expose them in a relatively small screen. Also, has been important the “[[Somatosensory system|touching]]” incorporation as interaction element “[[Consumer|user]]-[[Interface (computing)|interface]]” because it establishes simpler protocols and obligates to synthesize the distribution of the information. Some investigators usually define the [[Mobile 2.0|2.0]] era (and its devices) precisely for what the new design of the information involves in reduced screen. The 2.0 refers to the size, the portability and today, refers to the possibility to manage the transfer of information without physical anchors to networks through 3G devices of reduced dimensions.

The “[[presentation]] of the [[information]]” (screen interface) must accomplish three basic requirements adjusted in three parameters:
*FORM: the aspect of the base in which is presented the information must be [[Compact element|compact]] and [[Code|codable]] ( [[density]] and [[Understanding|comprehension]] of the screen information).
*SIZE: the proposed route is initially infinite ( the infinite amount of information is limited only by the [[memory]]).
*USABILITY: the ways and possible directions to transit through, must be easily and intuitively understood (the “touching” that finally is proposed to respond to that aim, must count with intelligible and codable protocols ).

A (rentable) solution at the proposed challenge for the combination of these three parameters was developed by '''Josep A. Esteve''' in 2011 with a configuration of interface, that was called '''Metacube'''.&lt;ref&gt;2.	In works such as Nguyen, Tjoa and Wagner has been presented a Metacube Concept as the tridimensional disposition of the information (Nguyen, Tjoa y Wagner (2000) “ Conceptual Multidimensional Data Model Based on Metacube” of Nguyen, Tjoa and Wagner (T. Yakno (Ed): ADVIS 2000, LNCS, p 24-33, 2000). This approach only explains the spatial disposition of the information, transposes 2D graphic trees in a accumulate cubic in 3D, but it does not stablish the protocols of searching and comparation of the same. It is a preterit theoerical form of talking about 3D disposition of the information, for the advances in 3D infography.  In the Metacube (Esteve) the information is compacted, establishing clear protocols of searching and comparation of the stored information.&lt;/ref&gt; The extensive Metacube theory is being developed in the CETEC where is tried to create a theory framework for an information model of synthesis applied to the interfaces of 2.0 devices .

The construct plot in which is based the Metacube concept, is exposed in the sections below:

== Informative surface ==

We start from a determined amount of information. We can express this amount in number of “[[information]] [[Electronic page|screens]]”.

All screen information is shown as a [[Two-dimensional space|2D]] surface where each [[Table cell|cell]] (view Image 1) is an “[[information]] unit” (text, image, sound,...). This cell is represented by &lt;math&gt;a_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;, in mode of the element of a matrix, where &lt;math&gt;i,j&lt;/math&gt;∈ℤ+ (are entire positive numbers) and to the set (all the information surface) is denoted by &lt;math&gt;\{a_{ij}\}&lt;/math&gt;. An informative surface is an infinite set of units-cells of information.[[File:Fórmula 4.png|thumb|right|300px| Image 1.]]

This surface can be as big as you desire. In practical effects the storing of the information only depends on the memory of the involved device .

We define the concept “[[informative]] surface operator”&lt;ref&gt;3.	The “operator” concept is generalized for any realizable action on the information and the communication of the information.&lt;/ref&gt; to all made action on the information surface, or in one of its cells in order to generate a change in the information presentation. This change can be structural, apparent, virtual, etc...

Is defined the operator [[k]] that corresponds to the “[[Table cell|cell]] [[Jumping|jump]]” &lt;ref&gt;4. The cell jump, that more ahead we will denote it as “Face rotation [or facet]” allows the calculation of “ Informative trajectories” and the definition of “Courses of information” and how to calculate its reversibility (Thermodynamics of the information).&lt;/ref&gt; concept. This action is the pass of one cell to one  of  the for cell-borderline below, as is indicated in the image 2. [[File:Fórmula 5.png|thumb|Right|350px|Image 2.]]

We have a set of elements with an operator, this is &lt;math&gt;(\{a_{ij}\},k)&lt;/math&gt;.

== Metacube ==

Assuming the 2.0 needs explicited before, to which were necessary to respond with solving, is proceeded to “fold” the structure “informative surface” that has been defined and we transformer it in a [[Three-dimensional space|3D]] element, this is, a [[cube]]. This cube, is what we have called Metacube, because it has infinite faces ( or the amount that are desired to define). In terms of a mentally supposed tridimensional representation in the [[cognitive process]] of the user, Metacube does not let of representing itself as a [[polyhedron]] of six appereant faces, because it maintains the formally of a one traditional cube.

Every frontal face, which is shown in the screen interface, is one of the cells &lt;math&gt;\{a_{ij}\}&lt;/math&gt;  of the informative surface &lt;math&gt;(\{a_{ij}\},k)&lt;/math&gt; and every “face jump” pass to be a “[[rotation]]” of central [[Axle|axis]] ( vertical or horizontal ) showing the informative content anterior or posterior of the cube face of infinite faces, as is shown in the images 3 and 4. [[File:Fórmula 10.png|thumb|Right| Image 3. Cell jump (2D)]][[File:Fórmula 11.png|thumb|Right|300px|Image 4. Face rotation of Metacube (3D)]]

The structure &lt;math&gt;(\{a_{ij}\},k)&lt;/math&gt; is denominated METACUBE.

It is obvious that Metacube allows to store the amount of information that we desire (each face shows the information that we  have put in the Metacube), to select with the “touching” the information that we want (search).

== Gigacube ==

In order to increase the organizational capacity and therefore magnificate the Metacube structure, is defined the concept called GIGACUBE. A '''Gigacube''' is a Metacube of Metacubes. It is the association of a Metacube to each face of a Metacube, multiplying exponentially the organizational capacity of the Gigacube structure. In fact, the growing is logarithmic and can be regulated at will. It could be said that all the information of the universe, could be presented to the user through a Gigacube interface.

Is denominated Metacube of Base or Metacube of level 1, the first Metacube that we find in the interface.

Metacubes associated to the faces of the Metacube of level 1, are denominated Metacubes of level 2 and so on.

The capacity of one Gigacube, depends on the magnitude (number of faces of the Metacubes of superior levels) associated to the faces of the metacube of level 1 and successively the metacubes of distinc level that are associated.

To active the Metacube associated to the face of one Metacube of base ( or inferior) we use the operator [[D]] that realize the action that we know as “Double [[Point and click|Click]]” .Is understood that the double clic actives the emergent metacube.

The structure &lt;math&gt;(\{a_{ij}\},k,D)&lt;/math&gt; is denominated GIGACUBE.

Gigacube form in the screen interface of a digital device is shown in the image 5.[[File:Fórmula 13.png|thumb|Right|300px|Image 5. Left,Metacube Appearance. Right, Gigacubo Appearance]]

The Gigacube structure &lt;math&gt;(\{a_{ij}\},k,D)&lt;/math&gt; complies the three requirements for the correct “presentation of the information” in the reduced interface. It remains to establish the “ compare [[information]]” protocol.

To compare information (units) must be exposed some Metacube faces at the same time in the screen interface. For this, is defined the operator &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{T}&lt;/math&gt;  that acts as “[[timer]]-[[Somatosensory system|touching]]” on the interface of Metacube. This operator corresponds to the action for which the user, keeping the “touch” during a period of time larger than normally, actives the Metacube as screen element and he can drag it around this, until place it where he desire. By this way, different Metacubes can be  placed in a same interface of a same Gigacube or not ( different origin). The [[Array data structure|vectorial]]  notation of this operator refers to its displacement capacity of the information element Metacube.

The structure &lt;math&gt;(\{a_{ij}\},k,D,\overrightarrow{T})&lt;/math&gt; complies the three basic requirements and, therefore, is constituted in the base of the architecture of the Gigacube concept.

This theory has been brought to practice successfully by different companies such as Tons of Toons, Esteve Animació and AppStar in the development of different App Games and App Utilities, including Zong-Ji, Pellex, Suma and Sudoku using chromenumerical Metacubes; or the PuzzKids that use iconical and chromealphabetical Metacubes.

The Gigacube structure is being used in the design of new sport informative applications.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10179">The '''political climate''' is the aggregate mood and opinions of a political society at a particular time. It is generally used to describe when the state of mood and opinion is changing or unstable rather than in a state of equilibrium. The phrase has origins from both [[ancient Greece]] and medieval-era [[France]].

While the concept of a political [[climate]] has been used historically to describe both [[politics]] and public reactions to political actions in various forms, the naming of the concept by the addition of the modifier “political” to the base “climate” has been fairly recent. [[Public opinion]] is also widely used incorrectly as a synonym for political climate.

As for judging what the climate is at any given time, there is no way to know an entire country's views on certain subjects. So, [[Opinion poll|polls]] are used to estimate what the political climate "feels" like on a regular basis. However, this only works to some degree as polls cannot involve the entire population at once.

==Etymology==

===Climate===
According to the [[Oxford English Dictionary]], the base climate comes from the Middle French ''climat'', which was first used to describe a region's prevailing weather conditions around 1314.&lt;ref&gt;"climate." Oxford English Dictionary. 2nd. 3. Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 1989. Web. http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50041503?query_type=word&amp;queryword=climate&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10&amp;sort_type=alpha&amp;result_place=1&amp;search_id=T1SE-tXioM1-15462&amp;hilite=50041503&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first recorded uses of climate as a description of prevailing political attitudes was in The Vanity of Dogmatizing by [[Joseph Glanvill]] in 1661 where he mentions “divers Climates of Opinions”.&lt;ref&gt;Glanville, Joseph. The Vanity of Dogmatizing. London: H. Eversden, 1661. 227. eBook.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political===
The modifier (''politic'' with the ''–al'' suffix) comes originally from the ancient Greek noun ''polis'' which referred to both a Greek city state, and the ideal state or government.&lt;ref name="Oxford_English_Dictionary"&gt;"politic." Oxford English Dictionary. 2nd. 3. Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 1989. Web. http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50182868?query_type=word&amp;queryword=politic&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10&amp;sort_type=alpha&amp;result_place=1&amp;search_id=T1SE-Cqhody-15489&amp;hilite=50182868&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, this evolved through the Latin noun ''politicus'' which is defined as the civil government,&lt;ref name="Oxford_English_Dictionary" /&gt; to the Middle French adjective ''politique'' which is the state of government, or relating to government.&lt;ref&gt;"polis." Oxford English Dictionary. 2nd. 3. Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 1989. Web. http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50182842?query_type=word&amp;queryword=polis&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10&amp;sort_type=alpha&amp;search_id=T1SE-DsbNxa-15502&amp;result_place=1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==

===Historical example===
{{Main article|Trial of Socrates}}
[[File:David - The Death of Socrates.jpg|right|thumb|300px|''[[The Death of Socrates]]'', by [[Jacques-Louis David]] (1787).]]

From 431 B.C.E to 404 B.C.E., ancient Greece was torn apart by the [[Peloponnesian War]] between [[Athens]] and [[Sparta]].&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides. The History of the Peloponnesian War. Gutenburg: Project Gutenburg, 2009. eBook.&lt;/ref&gt; The war concluded with an Athenian defeat and several years of oppression by pro-Spartan rulers. By 399 B.C.E, Athens had returned to self-rule through revolution. At this time, Athens was undergoing social turmoil due to the apparent failure of democracy as an effective form of government, which created a public backlash against anything anti-democratic. 

Socrates—the self-described "gadfly" of Athens because of his practice of ''elenchos'' (critical interrogation)—was seen by many as anti-democratic and thus a traitor to Athens due to his associations with Critias and Alcibiades (the former a Spartan supported tyrant, the latter a deserter to Sparta) and his frequent praises of the Spartan and Creten governments because of their similarity to many of his philosophical opinions on government.&lt;ref&gt;Bagby, Laurie. Political Thought: A Guide to The Classics. Belmont, CA: Wadsworth Group, 2002. 3. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The prevailing political climate of distrusting anything remotely anti-Athens or anti-democracy coupled with attacks from Socrates's personal enemies led to the philosopher's execution by poison in 399 B.C.E.&lt;ref&gt;Reeve, C.D.C. ''The Trials of Socrates''. Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing Company, 2002. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public opinion===
{{Main article|Public opinion}}
The phrase originates from the French term ''opinion publique'', which was first attributed to [[Montaigne]], the father of modern [[Skepticism]] and a major figure of the [[French Renaissance]], around 1588 C.E.&lt;ref&gt;Donsbach, Wolfgang. ''The International Encyclopedia of Communication''. Wiley-Blackwell, 2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
It is generally used to describe the overall opinion of the public body about a certain issue. The phrase is commonly used interchangeably with political climate but the two actually refer to separate concepts. [[Public opinion]] is the aggregate logical thoughts that the public thinks and expresses about an issue (which does not have to be political in nature), while political climate is what the public's emotional reaction to those logical thoughts are.

Depending on the nature of the thoughts (if they are considered controversial or extreme), the emotional reaction can range from nothing to a highly violent state. Accordingly, controversial issues in the public eye are usually accompanied by or can even produce a polarizing political climate. For example, the introduction, passing, and court fight over [[Proposition 8]] in [[California]] brought a controversial issue into the public sphere, which resulted in such a drastic change in the political climate of the [[United States]] as to produce many protests throughout the nation, some of them violent.&lt;ref&gt;Dolan, Maura. "Prop. 8: Protesters on both sides of gay-marriage issue make their views known outside courthouse." Los Angeles Times 6 December 2010: Web. 8 December 2010. [http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2010/12/demonstrators-proposition-8.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opinion polls===
An [[opinion poll]] is a survey of public opinion from a particular group of people or sample. For determining the political climate, this usually would be a [[cross-sectional data|cross-section]] of the population in question. Opinion polls conduct series of questions and then extrapolate the average opinion of the sample according to their answers. However, opinion polls generally have appreciative margins of error because of the inability to survey the entire population and the improbability of surveying a perfectly random cross-section of the population. For example, the [[Wall Street Journal]] estimated in 2006 that the average margin of error is about 3-5% in opinion polls because of a wide variety of potential inaccuracies such as [[response bias]] and [[selection bias]].&lt;ref&gt;Bialik, Carl. "Grading the Pollsters." Wall Street Journal 16 November 2006: Web. 22 September 2010.[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB116360961928023945%23mod=2_1125_1]&lt;/ref&gt;

Opinion polls are also known to be entirely incorrect when predicting the outcome of certain events. The best-known example of this is the [[1948 US presidential election]], in which the prediction was that [[Thomas Dewey]] would easily defeat [[Harry Truman]]. Major polling organizations, including [[George Gallup|Gallup]] and [[Elmo Roper|Roper]], indicated a landslide victory for Dewey when, in fact, Truman was the victor in a close election and kept the presidency.&lt;ref&gt;Crabtree, Steve. "Strom Thurmond and the 1948 Election." Gallup Brain: A Publication of Gallup, Inc. (2002): n. pag. Web. 8 Dec 2010.[http://www.gallup.com/poll/7444/gallup-brain-strom-thurmond-1948-election.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt; 2016 saw the validity of opinion polls enter the debate once more, as polls in both the UK "[[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|Brexit]]" referendum and the [[United States presidential election, 2016|US presidential election]] were ultimately shown to be largely incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/11/09/how-the-pollsters-got-the-us-election-wrong---just-like-brexit/|title=How the pollsters got the US election wrong - just like Brexit|newspaper=The Telegraph|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polls widely predicted a win for [[Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2016|Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton]], while instead [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|Republican candidate Donald J. Trump]] won the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] and, therefore, the presidency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/09/why-2016-election-polls-missed-their-mark/|title=Why 2016 election polls missed their mark|date=2016-11-09|newspaper=Pew Research Center|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Surveillance cameras.jpg|thumb|right|Privacy may be lessened by [[surveillance]] – in this case through [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]].]]
'''Privacy''' is the ability of an individual or group to seclude themselves, or information about themselves, and thereby express themselves selectively. The boundaries and content of what is considered private differ among cultures and individuals, but share common themes. When something is private to a ''person'', it usually means that something is inherently special or sensitive to them. The domain of privacy partially overlaps with [[security]] (confidentiality), which can include the concepts of appropriate use, as well as protection of information. Privacy may also take the form of [[bodily integrity]].&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Herring, ''Medical Law and Ethics'', Oxford University Press, 2016, p. 483.&lt;/ref&gt;

The right not to be subjected to unsanctioned invasion of privacy by the [[government]], [[corporation]]s or [[individual]]s is part of many countries' [[#Privacy law|privacy laws]], and in some cases, [[constitution]]s. All countries have laws which in some way limit privacy. An example of this would be law concerning [[taxation]], which normally requires the sharing of information about personal [[income]] or [[earnings]]. In some countries individual privacy may conflict with [[freedom of speech]] laws and some laws may require public disclosure of information which would be considered private in other countries and cultures.

Privacy may be [[Communication privacy management theory|voluntarily sacrificed]], normally in exchange for perceived benefits and very often with specific dangers and losses, although this is a very strategic view of human relationships. For example, people may be ready to reveal their name, if that allows them to promote trust by others and thus build meaningful social relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gaudeul|first=Alexia|last2=Giannetti|first2=Caterina|title=The effect of privacy concerns on social network formation|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0167268117301853|journal=Journal of Economic Behavior &amp; Organization|volume=141|pages=233–253|doi=10.1016/j.jebo.2017.07.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research shows that people are more willing to voluntarily sacrifice privacy if the data gatherer is seen to be transparent as to what information is gathered and how it is used.&lt;ref name="transparency"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Oulasvirta |first=Antti |last2=Suomalainen |first2=Tiia |last3=Hamari |first3=Juho |last4=Lampinen |first4=Airi |last5=Karvonen |first5=Kristiina |date=2014 |title=Transparency of Intentions Decreases Privacy Concerns in Ubiquitous Surveillance |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264638054_Transparency_of_Intentions_Decreases_Privacy_Concerns_in_Ubiquitous_Surveillance |journal=Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking |volume=17 |issue=10 |pages=633–38 |doi=10.1089/cyber.2013.0585}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the business world, a person may volunteer personal details (often for [[advertising]] purposes) in order to gamble on winning a prize.

The concept of universal individual privacy is a modern construct primarily associated with [[Western culture]], British and North American in particular, and remained virtually unknown in some cultures until recent times. According to some researchers, this concept sets [[United Kingdom–United States relations|Anglo-American]] culture apart even from Western European cultures such as French or Italian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zemskaya|first=E. A.|title=Особенности русской речи эмигрантов четвертой волны (Features of the Russian language of fourth wave immigrants)|url=http://www.gramota.ru/biblio/magazines/gramota/28_520|publisher=Gramota.ru|accessdate=24 February 2009|language=Russian|date=9 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most cultures, however, recognize the ability of individuals to withhold certain parts of their personal information from wider society—closing the door to one's home, for example.

The distinction or overlap between [[secrecy]] and privacy is [[ontology|ontologically]] subtle, which is why the word "privacy" is an example of an [[Untranslatability|untranslatable]] [[lexeme]],&lt;ref name="TranslationToday"/&gt; and many languages do not have a specific word for "privacy". Such languages either use a complex description to translate the term (such as Russian combining the meaning of ''уединение''—solitude, ''секретность''—secrecy, and ''частная жизнь''—private life) or borrow from English "privacy" (as [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] ''privasi'' or [[Italian language|Italian]] ''la privacy'').&lt;ref name="TranslationToday"&gt;{{cite book|title=Translation Today: Trends and Perspectives |last=Anderman |first=Gunilla M. |author2=Rogers, Margaret |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hJxVffwZEDgC&amp;lpg=PA73&amp;pg=PA73#v=onepage&amp;q=privacy&amp;f=false |publisher=Multilingual Matters |year=2003 |accessdate=1 January 2012|isbn=9781853596186 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction hinges on the discreteness of [[wikt:interest#Noun|interests]] of parties (persons or groups), which can have [[emic and etic|emic]] variation depending on cultural mores of [[individualism]], [[collectivism]], and the negotiation between [[individual and group rights]]. The difference is sometimes expressed humorously as, "when ''I'' withhold information, it is privacy; when ''you'' withhold information, it is secrecy."

==Concepts==
A broad multicultural literary tradition going to the beginnings of recorded history discusses the concept of privacy.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=12–13}} One way of categorizing all concepts of privacy is by considering all discussions as one of these concepts:{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=12–13}}

# the right to be let alone
# the option to limit the access others have to one's personal information
# [[secrecy]], or the option to conceal any information from others
# control over others' use of information about oneself
# states of privacy
# [[personhood]] and autonomy
# self-identity and personal growth
# protection of [[intimate relationships]]

===Right to be let alone===
In 1890 the United States [[jurists]] [[Samuel D. Warren]] and [[Louis Brandeis]] wrote ''[[The Right to Privacy (article)|The Right to Privacy]]'', an article in which they argued for the "right to be let alone", using that phrase as a definition of privacy.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=15–17}} There is extensive commentary over the meaning of being "let alone", and among other ways, it has been interpreted to mean the right of a person to choose [[seclusion]] from the attention of others if they wish to do so, and the right to be immune from scrutiny or being observed in private settings, such as one’s own home.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=15–17}} Although this early vague legal concept did not describe privacy in a way that made it easy to design broad legal protections of privacy, it strengthened the notion of privacy rights for individuals and began a legacy of discussion on those rights.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=15–17}}

===Limited access===
Limited access refers to a person’s ability to participate in society without having other individuals and organizations collect information about them.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=19}}

Various theorists have imagined privacy as a system for limiting access to one’s personal information.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=19}} [[Edwin Lawrence Godkin]] wrote in the late 19th century that "nothing is better worthy of legal protection than private life, or, in other words, the right of every man to keep his affairs to himself, and to decide for himself to what extent they shall be the subject of public observation and discussion."{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=19}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Godkin|first1=E.L.|authorlink1=Edwin Lawrence Godkin|title=Libel and its Legal Remedy|journal=[[Atlantic Monthly]]|date=December 1880|volume=46|issue=278|pages=729–39|url=http://digital.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=atla;cc=atla;rgn=full%20text;idno=atla0046-6;didno=atla0046-6;view=image;seq=0735;node=atla0046-6%3A1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adopting an approach similar to the one presented by Ruth Gavison&lt;ref name="transparency" /&gt; 9 years earlier,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gavison|first1=Ruth|authorlink1=Ruth Gavison|title=Privacy and the Limits of Law|journal=Yale Law Journal|date=1980|pages=421–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sissela Bok]] said that privacy is "the condition of being protected from unwanted access by others—either physical access, personal information, or attention."{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=19}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bok|first1=Sissela|authorlink1=Sissela Bok|title=Secrets : on the ethics of concealment and revelation|date=1989|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0679724735|pages=10–11|edition=Vintage Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Control over information===
Control over one's personal information is the concept that "privacy is the claim of individuals, groups, or institutions to determine for themselves when, how, and to what extent information about them is communicated to others."{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=24}}&lt;ref&gt;The quotation is from Alan Westin.{{cite book|last1=Westin|first1=Alan F.|last2=Blom-Cooper|first2=Louis|authorlink1=Alan Westin|authorlink2=Louis Blom-Cooper|title=Privacy and freedom|date=1970|publisher=Bodley Head|location=London|isbn=978-0370013251|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Fried]] said that "Privacy is not simply an absence of information about us in the minds of others; rather it is the control we have over information about ourselves. Nevertheless, in the era of [[big data]], control over information is under pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/handle/1887/46935|title=Predicting Data that People Refuse to Disclose; How Data Mining Predictions Challenge Informational Self-Determination|last=B.H.M.|first=Custers,|last2=Metajuridica|first2=Instituut voor|website=openaccess.leidenuniv.nl|access-date=2017-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== States of privacy ===
Alan Westin defined four states—or experiences—of privacy: solitude, intimacy, anonymity, and reserve. Solitude is a physical separation from others.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Privacy and Freedom|last = Westin|first = Alan|publisher = Atheneum|year = 1967|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Intimacy is a "close, relaxed, and frank relationship between two or more individuals" that results from the seclusion of a pair or small group of individuals.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Anonymity is the "desire of individuals for times of 'public privacy.'"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Lastly, reserve is the "creation of a psychological barrier against unwanted intrusion"; this creation of a psychological barrier requires others to respect an individual's need or desire to restrict communication of information concerning himself or herself.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In addition to the psychological barrier of reserve, Kirsty Hughes identified three more kinds of privacy barriers: physical, behavioral, and normative. Physical barriers, such as walls and doors, prevent others from accessing and experiencing the individual.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = A Behavioural Understanding of Privacy and Its Implications for Privacy Law|last = Hughes|first = Kirsty|date = 2012|journal = The Modern Law Review|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; (In this sense, "accessing" an individual includes accessing personal information about him or her.)&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Behavioral barriers communicate to others—verbally, through language, or non-verbally, through personal space, body language, or clothing—that an individual does not want them to access or experience him or her.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Lastly, normative barriers, such as laws and social norms, restrain others from attempting to access or experience an individual.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Secrecy===
Privacy is sometimes defined as an option to have secrecy. Richard Posner said that privacy is the right of people to "conceal information about themselves that others might use to their disadvantage".{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=21}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Posner|first1=Richard A.|authorlink1=Richard Posner|title=The economics of justice|date=1983|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=978-0674235267|page=271|edition=5. print}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In various legal contexts, when privacy is described as secrecy, a conclusion if privacy is secrecy then rights to privacy do not apply for any information which is already publicly disclosed.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=22–23}} When privacy-as-secrecy is discussed, it is usually imagined to be a selective kind of secrecy in which individuals keep some information secret and private while they choose to make other information public and not private.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=22–23}}

===Personhood and autonomy===
Privacy may be understood as a necessary precondition for the development and preservation of personhood. Jeffrey Reiman defined privacy in terms of a recognition of one's ownership of his or her physical and mental reality and a moral right to his or her self-determination.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Privacy, Intimacy, and Personhood|last = Reiman|first = Jeffrey|date = 1976|journal = Philosophy &amp; Public Affairs|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the "social ritual" of privacy, or the social practice of respecting an individual's privacy barriers, the social group communicates to the developing child that he or she has exclusive moral rights to his or her body—in other words, he or she has moral ownership of his or her body.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This entails control over both active (physical) and cognitive appropriation, the former being control over one's movements and actions and the latter being control over who can experience one's physical existence and when.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Alternatively, Stanley Benn defined privacy in terms of a recognition of oneself as a subject with agency—as an individual with the capacity to choose.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Philosophical Dimensions of Privacy: An Anthology|last = Benn|first = Stanley|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = |isbn = |location = New York|pages = |editor-first = Ferdinand|chapter = Privacy, freedom, and respect for persons|editor-last = Schoeman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Privacy is required to exercise choice.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Overt observation makes the individual aware of himself or herself as an object with a "determinate character" and "limited probabilities."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Covert observation, on the other hand, changes the conditions in which the individual is exercising choice without his or her knowledge and consent.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In addition, privacy may be viewed as a state that enables autonomy, a concept closely connected to that of personhood. According to Joseph Kufer, an autonomous self-concept entails a conception of oneself as a "purposeful, self-determining, responsible agent" and an awareness of one's capacity to control the boundary between self and other—that is, to control who can access and experience him or her and to what extent.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Privacy, Autonomy, and Self-Concept|last = Kufer|first = Joseph|date = 1987|journal = American Philosophical Quarterly|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, others must acknowledge and respect the self's boundaries—in other words, they must respect the individual's privacy.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The studies of psychologists such as Jean Piaget and Victor Tausk show that, as children learn that they can control who can access and experience them and to what extent, they develop an autonomous self-concept.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In addition, studies of adults in particular institutions, such as Erving Goffman's study of "total institutions" such as prisons and mental institutions,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Asylums: Essays on the Social Situation of Mental Patients and Other Inmates|last = Goffman|first = Erving|publisher = Doubleday|year = 1968|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that systemic and routinized deprivations or violations of privacy deteriorate one's sense of autonomy over time.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Self-identity and personal growth ===
Privacy may be understood as a prerequisite for the development of a sense of self-identity. Privacy barriers, in particular, are instrumental in this process. According to Irwin Altman, such barriers "define and limit the boundaries of the self" and thus "serve to help define [the self]."&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Environment and Social Behavior: Privacy, Personal Space, Territory, and Crowding|last = Altman|first = Irwin|publisher = Brooks/Cole Publishing Company|year = 1975|isbn = |location = Monterey|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This control primarily entails the ability to regulate contact with others.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Control over the "permeability" of the self's boundaries enables one to control what constitutes the self and thus to define what is the self.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

In addition, privacy may be seen as a state that fosters personal growth, a process integral to the development of self-identity. Hyman Gross suggested that, without privacy—solitude, anonymity, and temporary releases from social roles—individuals would be unable to freely express themselves and to engage in self-discovery and self-criticism.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Such self-discovery and self-criticism contributes to one's understanding of oneself and shapes one's sense of identity.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

===Intimacy===
In a way analogous to how the personhood theory imagines privacy as some essential part of being an individual, the intimacy theory imagines privacy to be an essential part of the way that humans have strengthened or [[intimate relationships]] with other humans.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=35}} Because part of human relationships includes individuals volunteering to self-disclose some information, but withholding other information, there is a concept of privacy as a part of the process by means of which humans establish relationships with each other.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=35}}

[[James Rachels]] advanced this notion by writing that privacy matters because "there is a close connection between our ability to control who has access to us and to information about us, and our ability to create and maintain different sorts of social relationships with different people."{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=35}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rachels|first1=James|authorlink1=James Rachels|title=Why Privacy is Important|journal=[[Philosophy &amp; Public Affairs]]|date=Summer 1975|volume=4|issue=4|pages=323–33|jstor=2265077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concepts in popular media===
Privacy can mean different things in different contexts; different people, cultures, and nations have different expectations about how much privacy a person is entitled to or what constitutes an [[invasion of privacy]].

====Personal privacy====
Most people have a strong sense of privacy in relation to the exposure of their body to others. This is an aspect of personal [[modesty]]. A person will go to extreme lengths to protect this personal modesty, the main way being the wearing of [[clothing|clothes]]. Other ways include erection of [[wall]]s, [[fence]]s, screens, use of [[cathedral glass]], partitions, by maintaining a distance, beside other ways. People who go to those lengths expect that their privacy will be respected by others. At the same time, people are prepared to expose themselves in acts of [[physical intimacy]], but these are confined to exposure in circumstances and of persons of their choosing. Even a discussion of those circumstances is regarded as intrusive and typically unwelcome.

Physical privacy could be defined as preventing "intrusions into one's physical space or solitude."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BwQBT2Mr1YoC&amp;pg=PA188&amp;dq=physical+privacy&amp;sig=dvybgqk6wfkf_xGimY8lvtWVV3I|title=Managing Privacy: Information Technology and Corporate America|first=H. Jeff|last=Smith|date=14 April 1994|publisher=UNC Press Books|accessdate=14 April 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This would include concerns such as:
* Preventing intimate acts or hiding one's body from others for the purpose of [[modesty]]; apart from being [[clothing|dressed]] this can be achieved by [[wall]]s, [[fence]]s, privacy screens, [[cathedral glass]], partitions between [[urinal (restroom)|urinals]], by being far away from others, on a bed by a [[bed sheet]] or a [[blanket]], when changing clothes by a [[towel]], etc.; to what extent these measures also prevent acts being ''heard'' varies
* Video, of aptly named graphic, or intimate, acts, behaviors or body parts
* Preventing searching of one's personal possessions
* Preventing unauthorized access to one's home or vehicle
* [[Medical privacy]], the right to make fundamental medical decisions without governmental coercion or third-party review, most widely applied to questions of contraception

An example of the legal basis for the right to physical privacy is the U.S. [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]], which guarantees "the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3805/is_200206/ai_n9109326/pg_1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080310024937/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3805/is_200206/ai_n9109326/pg_1 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-03-10 |work=Georgetown Law Journal |title=Fixing the Fourth Amendment with trade secret law: A response to Kyllo v. United States |year=2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most countries have laws regarding [[trespassing]] and property rights also determine the right of physical privacy.

Physical privacy may be a matter of cultural sensitivity, personal dignity, and/or shyness. There may also be concerns about safety, if for example one is wary of becoming the victim of crime or [[stalking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.privacyrights.org/fs/fs14a-stalking.htm |title=Security Recommendations For Stalking Victims |publisher=Privacyrights.org |accessdate=2012-01-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111081006/http://www.privacyrights.org/fs/fs14a-stalking.htm |archive-date=2012-01-11 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Civil inattention]] is a process whereby individuals are able to maintain their privacy within a crowd.

====Informational====
{{Main|Information privacy}}

Information or data privacy refers to the evolving relationship between technology and the legal right to, or public expectation of, privacy in the collection and sharing of data about one's self. Privacy concerns exist wherever uniquely identifiable data relating to a person or persons are collected and stored, in digital form or otherwise. In some cases these concerns refer to how data are collected, stored, and associated. In other cases the issue is who is given access to information. Other issues include whether an individual has any ownership rights to data about them, and/or the right to view, verify, and challenge that information.

Various types of [[personal information]] are often associated with privacy concerns. Information plays an important role in the decision-action process, which can lead to problems in terms of privacy and availability. First, it allows people to see all the options and alternatives available. Secondly, it allows people to choose which of the options would be best for a certain situation. An information landscape consists of the information, its location in the so-called network, as well as its availability, awareness, and usability. Yet the set-up of the information landscape means that information that is available in one place may not be available somewhere else. This can lead to a privacy situation that leads to questions regarding which people have the power to access and use certain information, who should have that power, and what provisions govern it. For various reasons, individuals may object to personal information such as their religion, sexual orientation, political affiliations, or personal activities being revealed, perhaps to avoid [[discrimination]], personal embarrassment, or damage to their professional reputations.

[[Financial privacy]], in which information about a person's financial transactions is guarded, is important for the avoidance of [[fraud]] including [[identity theft]]. Information about a person's purchases, for instance, can reveal a great deal about their preferences, places they have visited, their contacts, products (such as medications) they use, their activities and habits, etc. In addition to this, financial privacy also includes privacy over the bank accounts opened by individuals. Information about the bank where the individual has an account with, and whether or not this is in a country that [[Bank secrecy|does not share this information with other countries]] can help countries in fighting [[tax avoidance]].

[[Internet privacy]] is the ability to determine what information one reveals or withholds about oneself over the Internet, who has access to such information, and for what purposes one's information may or may not be used. For example, web users may be concerned to discover that many of the web sites which they visit collect, store, and possibly share [[personally identifiable information]] about them. Similarly, Internet email users generally consider their emails to be private and hence would be concerned if their [[email]] was being accessed, read, stored or forwarded by third parties without their consent. Tools used to protect privacy on the Internet include encryption tools and anonymizing services like [[I2P]] and [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]].

[[Medical privacy]] Protected Health Information OCR/HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996) allows a person to withhold their medical records and other information from others, perhaps because of fears that it might affect their insurance coverage or employment, or to avoid the embarrassment caused by revealing medical conditions or treatments. Medical information could also reveal other aspects of one's personal life, such as sexual preferences or proclivity. A right to sexual privacy enables individuals to [[contraceptive security|acquire and use contraceptives]] without family, community or legal sanctions.

[[Political privacy]] has been a concern since [[voting system]]s emerged in ancient times. The [[secret ballot]] helps to ensure that voters cannot be coerced into voting in certain ways, since they can allocate their vote as they wish in the privacy and security of the voting booth while maintaining the anonymity of the vote. Secret ballots are nearly universal in modern [[democracy]], and considered a basic right of [[citizenship]], despite the difficulties that they cause (for example the inability to trace votes back to the corresponding voters increases the risk of someone stuffing additional fraudulent votes into the system: additional security controls are needed to minimize such risks).

Corporate privacy refers to the privacy rights of corporate actors like senior executives of large, publicly traded corporations. Desires for corporate privacy can frequently raise issues with obligations for public disclosures under securities and corporate law.

====Organizational====

Government agencies, corporations, groups/societies and other organizations may desire to keep their activities or secrets from being revealed to other organizations or individuals, adopting various [[security]] practices and controls in order to keep private information confidential. Organizations may seek legal protection for their secrets. For example, a government administration may be able to invoke [[executive privilege]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://writ.corporate.findlaw.com/amar/20040416.html |title=FindLaw's Writ – Amar: Executive Privilege |publisher=Writ.corporate.findlaw.com |date=2004-04-16 |accessdate=2012-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; or declare certain information to be [[Classified information|classified]], or a corporation might attempt to protect valuable proprietary information as [[trade secret]]s.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

====Spiritual and intellectual====

The earliest legislative development of privacy rights began under [[British common law]], which protected "only the physical interference of life and property." Its development from then on became "one of the most significant chapters in the history of privacy law."&lt;ref name=Solove&gt;Solove, Daniel J., Rotenberg, Marc, Schwartz, Paul M. ''Privacy, Information, and Technology'', Aspen Publ. (2006) pp. 9–11&lt;/ref&gt; Privacy rights gradually expanded to include a "recognition of man's spiritual nature, of his feelings and his intellect."&lt;ref name=Solove/&gt; Eventually, the scope of those rights broadened even further to include a basic "right to be let alone", and the former definition of "property" would then comprise "every form of possession—intangible, as well as tangible." By the late 19th century, interest in a "right to privacy" grew as a response to the growth of print media, especially newspapers.&lt;ref name=Solove/&gt;

==History==
{{further|Privacy laws of the United States}}
Privacy has historical roots in philosophical discussions, the most well-known being Aristotle's distinction between two spheres of life: the public sphere of the ''polis'', associated with political life, and the private sphere of the ''oikos'', associated with domestic life.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|edition = Spring 2015|title = Privacy|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2015/entries/privacy/|date = 2015-01-01|first = Judith|last = DeCew|editor-first = Edward N.|editor-last = Zalta}}&lt;/ref&gt; More systematic treatises of privacy in the United States did not appear until the 1890s, with the development of privacy law in America.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

===Technology===
[[File:IllinoisTelephoneAndTelegraphAd.png|thumb|200px|Advertisement for dial telephone service available to delegates to the 1912 [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] convention in [[Chicago]]. A major selling point of dial telephone service was that it was "secret", in that no operator was required to connect the call.]]

As technology has advanced, the way in which privacy is protected and violated has changed with it. In the case of some technologies, such as the [[printing press]] or the [[Internet]], the increased ability to share information can lead to new ways in which privacy can be breached. It is generally agreed that the first publication advocating privacy in the United States was the article by [[Samuel D. Warren (US attorney)|Samuel Warren]] and [[Louis Brandeis]], "[[The Right to Privacy (article)|The Right to Privacy]]", [http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.805/articles/privacy/Privacy_brand_warr2.html 4 ''Harvard Law Review'' 193 (1890)], that was written largely in response to the increase in newspapers and photographs made possible by printing technologies.&lt;ref&gt;Information Privacy, Official Reference for the Certified Information privacy Professional (CIPP), Swire, P.&amp;nbsp;P. [https://www.amazon.com/s?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;sort=relevancerank&amp;search-type=ss&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Peter%20P.%20Swire]. and Bermann, S. (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rbs2.com/privacy.htm |title=Privacy Law in the United States |publisher=Rbs2.com |accessdate=2012-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New technologies can also create new ways to gather private information. For example, in the United States it was thought that heat sensors intended to be used to find marijuana-growing operations would be acceptable. However, in 2001 in ''[[Kyllo v. United States]]'' (533 U.S. 27) it was decided that the use of [[thermal imaging]] devices that can reveal previously unknown information without a warrant does indeed constitute a violation of privacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/privacy/ |title=Privacy (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |accessdate=2012-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally the increased ability to gather and send information has had negative implications for retaining privacy. As large-scale [[information systems]] become more common, there is so much information stored in many databases worldwide that an individual has no practical means of knowing of or controlling all of the information about themselves that others may have hold or access. Such information could potentially be sold to others for profit and/or be used for purposes not known to or sanctioned by the individual concerned. The concept of [[information privacy]] has become more significant as more systems controlling more information appear. Also the consequences of privacy violations can be more severe. [[Privacy law]] in many countries has had to adapt to changes in technology in order to address these issues and, to some extent, maintain privacy rights. But the existing global privacy rights framework has also been criticized as incoherent and inefficient. Proposals such as the [[APEC]] Privacy Framework have emerged which set out to provide the first comprehensive legal framework on the issue of global data privacy.

There are various theories about privacy and privacy control. The Invasion Paradigm defines privacy violation as the hostile actions of a wrongdoer who causes direct harm to an individual. This is a reactive view of privacy protection as it waits until there is a violation before acting to protect the violated individual, sometimes through criminal punishments for those who invaded the privacy of others. In the Invasion Paradigm this threat of criminal punishment that is supposed to work as deterrent. The Secrecy paradigm defines a privacy invasion as someone’s concealed information or hidden world being revealed through surveillance. The Negative Freedom Paradigm views privacy as freedom from invasion rather than a right, going against the more popular view of a "right to privacy." Finally, the Inaccessibility Paradigm states that privacy is the state where something is completely inaccessible to others. Daniel Solove, a law professor at George Washington University also has a theory of privacy. He believes that a conceptualized view of privacy will not work because there is no one core element. There are many different, interconnected elements involved in privacy and privacy protection. Therefore, Solove proposes looking at these issues from the bottom up, focusing on privacy problems. People may often overlook the fact that certain elements of privacy problems are due to the structure of privacy itself. Therefore, the architecture must change wherein people must learn to view privacy as a social and legal structure. He also states that people have to redefine the relationship between privacy and businesses and the government. Participation in certain privacy elements of the government and businesses should allow people to choose whether they want to be a part of certain aspects of their work that could be considered privacy invasion.

===Internet===
{{Main|Internet privacy}}

The Internet has brought new concerns about privacy in an age where computers can permanently store records of everything: "where every online photo, status update, Twitter post and blog entry by and about us can be stored forever", writes law professor and author [[Jeffrey Rosen]].&lt;ref name=Rosen&gt;Rosen, Jeffrey. [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/25/magazine/25privacy-t2.html?_r=1&amp;ref=technology "The Web Means the End of Forgetting"] ''New York Times'', July 19, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

This currently has an effect on employment. [[Microsoft]] reports that 75 percent of U.S. recruiters and human-resource professionals now do online research about candidates, often using information provided by search engines, social-networking sites, photo/video-sharing sites, personal web sites and blogs, and [[Twitter]]. They also report that 70 percent of U.S. recruiters have rejected candidates based on internet information. This has created a need by many to control various online privacy settings in addition to controlling their online reputations, both of which have led to legal suits against various sites and employers.&lt;ref name=Rosen/&gt;

The ability to do online inquiries about individuals has expanded dramatically over the last decade. [[Facebook]] for example, as of August 2015, was the largest social-networking site, with nearly 1,490 million members, who upload over 4.75 billion pieces of content daily. Over 83.09 million accounts were fake. [[Twitter]] has more than 316 million registered users and over 20 million are fake users. The [[Library of Congress]] recently announced that it will be acquiring—and permanently storing—the entire archive of public Twitter posts since 2006, reports Rosen.&lt;ref name=Rosen/&gt;

Importantly, directly observed behaviour, such as browsing logs, search queries, or contents of the Facebook profile can be automatically processed to infer secondary information about an individual, such as sexual orientation, political and religious views, race, substance use, intelligence, and personality.&lt;ref name="Kosinski 2013 5802–5805"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kosinski|first=Michal|author2=Stillwell, D. |author3=Graepel, T. |title=Private traits and attributes are predictable from digital records of human behavior|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|year=2013|volume=110|issue=15|pages=5802–05|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/110/15/5802.full.pdf+html|doi=10.1073/pnas.1218772110|pmid=23479631|pmc=3625324}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kosinski|first=Michal|author2=Bachrach, Y. |author3=Stillwell, D.J. |author4=Kohli, P. |author5=Graepel, T. |title=Manifestations Of User Personality In Website Choice And Behaviour On Online Social Networks|journal=Machine Learning Journal|date=19 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Effectively, individual views and preferences can be revealed even if they were not directly expressed or indicated (e.g. by stating their political views on their Facebook profile, or visiting a gay community website).

According to some experts, many commonly used communication devices may be mapping every move of their users. Senator [[Al Franken]] has noted the seriousness of [[iPhones]] and [[iPads]] having the ability to record and store users' locations in unencrypted files,&lt;ref&gt;Popkin, Helen A.&amp;nbsp;S., [https://archive.is/20120714202126/http://technolog.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2011/04/21/6508416-govt-officials-want-answers-to-secret-iphone-tracking "Gov't officials want answers to secret iPhone tracking"] ''MSNBC'', "Technology", April 21, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; although Apple denied doing so.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9216210/Apple_denies_tracking_iPhone_users_but_promises_changes?taxonomyId=84 "Apple denies tracking iPhone users, but promises changes"], ''Computerworld'', April 27, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Andrew Grove]], co-founder and former CEO of [[Intel Corporation]], offered his thoughts on internet privacy in an interview published in May 2000:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esquire.com/features/what-ive-learned/learned-andy-grove-0500 "What I've Learned: Andy Grove"], ''Esquire'' magazine, May 1, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Privacy is one of the biggest problems in this new electronic age. At the heart of the Internet culture is a force that wants to find out everything about you. And once it has found out everything about you and two hundred million others, that's a very valuable asset, and people will be tempted to trade and do commerce with that asset. This wasn't the information that people were thinking of when they called this the information age.}}

==Actions which take away privacy==
As with other concepts about privacy, there are various ways to discuss what kinds of processes or actions remove, challenge, lessen, or attack privacy. In 1960 legal scholar [[William Prosser (academic)|William Prosser]] created the following list of activities which can be remedied with privacy protection:{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=101}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Prosser|first1=William|authorlink1=William Prosser (academic)|title=Privacy|journal=[[California Law Review]]|date=1960|volume=48|issue=383|page=389|url=http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/californialawreview/vol48/iss3/1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Intrusion into a person’s private space, own affairs, or wish for solitude{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=101}}
# Public disclosure of personal information about a person which could be embarrassing for them to have revealed{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=101}}
# Promoting access to information about a person which could lead the public to have incorrect beliefs about them{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=101}}
# Encroaching someone’s personality rights, and using their likeness to advance interests which are not their own{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=101}}

Building from this and other historical precedents, [[Daniel J. Solove]] presented another classification of actions which are harmful to privacy, including collection of information which is already somewhat public, processing of information, sharing information, and invading personal space to get private information.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=103}}

===Collecting information===
In the context of harming privacy, information collection means gathering whatever information can be obtained by doing something to obtain it.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=103}} Surveillance is an example of this, when someone decides to begin watching and recording someone or something, and interrogation is another example of this, when someone uses another person as a source of information.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=103}} Examples of information collection agencies include the [[NSA]] and the participants in the [[Five Eyes]] program.

===Aggregating information===
It can happen that privacy is not harmed when information is available, but that the harm can come when that information is collected as a set then processed in a way that the collective reporting of pieces of information encroaches on privacy.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}} Actions in this category which can lessen privacy include the following:{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}}
* [[data aggregation]], which is connecting many related but unconnected pieces of information{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}}
* identification, which can mean breaking the [[de-identification]] of items of data by putting it through a [[de-anonymization]] process, thus making facts which were intended to not name particular people to become associated with those people{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}}
* insecurity, such as lack of [[data security]], which includes when an organization is supposed to be responsible for protecting data instead suffers a [[data breach]] which harms the people whose data it held{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}}
* secondary use, which is when people agree to share their data for a certain purpose, but then the data is used in ways without the data donors’ [[informed consent]]{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}}
* exclusion is the use of a person's data without any attempt to give the person an opportunity to manage the data or participate in its usage{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}}

===Information dissemination===
{{quote|''Count not him among your friends who will retail your privacies to the world.''|[[Publilius Syrus]]}}
Information dissemination is an attack on privacy when information which was shared in confidence is shared or threatened to be shared in a way that harms the subject of the information.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}}

There are various examples of this.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}} Breach of confidentiality is when one entity promises to keep a person’s information private, then breaks that promise.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}} Disclosure is making information about a person more accessible in a way that harms the subject of the information, regardless of how the information was collected or the intent of making it available.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}} Exposure is a special type of disclosure in which the information disclosed is emotional to the subject or taboo to share, such as revealing their private life experiences, their nudity, or perhaps private body functions.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}} Increased accessibility means advertising the availability of information without actually distributing it, as in the case of doxxing.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}} Blackmail is making a threat to share information, perhaps as part of an effort to coerce someone.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}} Appropriation is an attack on the [[personhood]] of someone, and can include using the value of someone's reputation or likeness to advance interests which are not those of the person being appropriated.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}} Distortion is the creation of misleading information or lies about a person.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}}

===Invasions===
Invasion of privacy, a subset of [[expectation of privacy]], is a different concept from the collecting, aggregating, and disseminating information because those three are a misuse of available data, whereas invasion is an attack on the right of individuals to keep personal secrets.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}} An invasion is an attack in which information, whether intended to be public or not, is captured in a way that insults the personal dignity and right to private space of the person whose data is taken.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}}

An intrusion is any unwanted entry into a person's private personal space and solitude for any reason, regardless of whether data is taken during that breach of space.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}} "Decisional interference" is when an entity somehow injects itself into the personal decision making process of another person, perhaps to influence that person's private decisions but in any case doing so in a way that disrupts the private personal thoughts that a person has.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=104–05}}

==Right to privacy==
{{main|Right to privacy}}

Privacy uses the theory of natural rights, and generally responds to new information and communication technologies. In North America, [[Samuel D. Warren (US attorney)|Samuel D. Warren]] and [[Louis D. Brandeis]] wrote that privacy is the "right to be let alone" (Warren &amp; Brandeis, 1890) focuses on protecting individuals. This citation was a response to recent technological developments, such as photography, and sensationalist journalism, also known as [[yellow journalism]].&lt;ref name=Brandeis&gt;Warren and Brandeis, [http://www.law.louisville.edu/library/collections/brandeis/node/225 "The Right To Privacy"], 4 Harvard Law Review 193 (1890)&lt;/ref&gt;

Privacy rights are inherently intertwined with information technology. In his widely cited [[dissenting opinion]] in ''[[Olmstead v. United States]]'' (1928), Brandeis relied on thoughts he developed in his [[Louis Brandeis#Creating a Right to Privacy|''Harvard Law Review'' article]] in 1890. But in his dissent, he now changed the focus whereby he urged making personal privacy matters more relevant to [[constitutional law]], going so far as saying "the government [was] identified .... as a potential privacy invader." He writes, "Discovery and invention have made it possible for the Government, by means far more effective than stretching upon the rack, to obtain disclosure in court of what is whispered in the closet." At that time, telephones were often community assets, with shared party lines and the potentially nosey human operators. By the time of Katz, in 1967, telephones had become personal devices with lines not shared across homes and switching was electro-mechanical. In the 1970s, new computing and recording technologies began to raise concerns about privacy, resulting in the [[Fair Information Practice Principles]].

===Definitions===

In recent years there have been only few attempts to clearly and precisely define a "right to privacy." Some experts assert that in fact the right to privacy "should not be defined as a separate legal right" at all. By their reasoning, existing laws relating to privacy in general should be sufficient.&lt;ref name=Haifa&gt;Yael Onn, et al., [https://books.google.com/books?id=yeVRrrJw-zAC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=right+to+privacy+tel+aviv&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=T0IhTaWhEI-msQOizMWZCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=right%20to%20privacy%20tel%20aviv&amp;f=false ''Privacy in the Digital Environment''], Haifa Center of Law &amp; Technology, (2005) pp. 1–12&lt;/ref&gt; Other experts, such as [[William Prosser (academic)|Dean Prosser]], have attempted, but failed, to find a "common ground" between the leading kinds of privacy cases in the court system, at least to formulate a definition.&lt;ref name=Haifa/&gt; One law school treatise from Israel, however, on the subject of "privacy in the digital environment", suggests that the "right to privacy should be seen as an independent right that deserves legal protection in itself." It has therefore proposed a working definition for a "right to privacy":
&lt;blockquote&gt;''The right to privacy is our right to keep a domain around us, which includes all those things that are part of us, such as our body, home, property, thoughts, feelings, secrets and identity. The right to privacy gives us the ability to choose which parts in this domain can be accessed by others, and to control the extent, manner and timing of the use of those parts we choose to disclose.''&lt;ref name=Haifa/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===An individual right===

[[Alan Westin]] believes that new technologies alter the balance between privacy and disclosure, and that privacy rights may limit government surveillance to protect democratic processes. Westin defines privacy as "the claim of individuals, groups, or institutions to determine for themselves when, how, and to what extent information about them is communicated to others". Westin describes four states of privacy: solitude, intimacy, anonymity, and reserve. These states must balance participation against norms:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Each individual is continually engaged in a personal adjustment process in which he balances the desire for privacy with the desire for disclosure and communication of himself to others, in light of the environmental conditions and social norms set by the society in which he lives.
— Alan Westin, Privacy and Freedom, 1968&lt;ref&gt;Westin, A. (1968). Privacy and freedom (Fifth ed.). New York: Atheneum.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Under liberal democratic systems, privacy creates a space separate from political life, and allows personal autonomy, while ensuring democratic [[Freedom of association|freedoms of association]] and [[Freedom of speech|expression]].

David Flaherty believes networked computer databases pose threats to privacy. He develops 'data protection' as an aspect of privacy, which involves "the collection, use, and dissemination of personal information". This concept forms the foundation for fair information practices used by governments globally. Flaherty forwards an idea of privacy as information control, "[i]ndividuals want to be left alone and to exercise some control over how information about them is used".&lt;ref&gt;Flaherty, D. (1989). Protecting privacy in surveillance societies: The federal republic of Germany, Sweden, France, Canada, and the United States. Chapel Hill, U.S.: The University of North Carolina Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Posner and Lawrence Lessig focus on the economic aspects of personal information control. Posner criticizes privacy for concealing information, which reduces market efficiency. For Posner, employment is selling oneself in the labour market, which he believes is like selling a product. Any 'defect' in the 'product' that is not reported is fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Posner | first1 = R. A. | year = 1981 | title = The economics of privacy | url = | journal = The American Economic Review | volume = 71 | issue = 2| pages = 405–09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For Lessig, privacy breaches online can be regulated through code and law. Lessig claims "the protection of privacy would be stronger if people conceived of the right as a property right", and that "individuals should be able to control information about themselves".&lt;ref&gt;Lessig, L. (2006). Code: Version 2.0. New York, U.S.: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Economic approaches to privacy make communal conceptions of privacy difficult to maintain.

===A collective "value" and a "human right"===

There have been attempts to reframe privacy as a fundamental [[Human rights|human right]], whose social value is an essential component in the functioning of democratic societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Deborah|title=Ethical theory and business.|year=2009|publisher=Pearson/Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, N.J.|isbn=0136126022|pages=428–42|edition=8th|authorlink=Privacy|editors=Beauchamp, Bowie, Arnold}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amitai Etzioni]] suggests a [[Communitarianism|communitarian]] approach to privacy. This requires a shared moral culture for establishing social order.&lt;ref&gt;Etzioni, A. (2006). Communitarianism. In B. S. Turner (Ed.), The Cambridge Dictionary of Sociology (pp. 81–83). Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Etzioni believes that "[p]rivacy is merely one good among many others",&lt;ref&gt;Etzioni, A. (2007). Are new technologies the enemy of privacy? Knowledge, Technology &amp; Policy, 20, 115–19.&lt;/ref&gt; and that technological effects depend on community accountability and oversight (ibid). He claims that privacy laws only increase government surveillance by weakening informal social controls.&lt;ref&gt;Etzioni, A. (2000). A communitarian perspective on privacy. Connecticut Law Review, 32(3), 897–905.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the government is no longer the only or even principle threat to people's privacy. Etzioni notes that corporate data miners, or "[https://web.archive.org/web/20130905184715/http://icps.gwu.edu/files/2010/10/privacy-merchants.pdf Privacy Merchants]," stand to profit by selling massive dossiers personal information, including purchasing decisions and Internet traffic, to the highest bidder. And while some might not find collection of private information objectionable when it is only used commercially by the private sector, the information these corporations amass and process is also available to the government, so that it is no longer possible to protect privacy by only curbing the State.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Etzioni |first=Amitai |title=The Privacy Merchants: What is to be done? |journal=The Journal of Constitutional Law |date=March 2012 |volume=14 |issue=4 |page=950 |url=http://icps.gwu.edu/files/2010/10/privacy-merchants.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130905184715/http://icps.gwu.edu/files/2010/10/privacy-merchants.pdf |archivedate=2013-09-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Priscilla Regan believes that individual concepts of privacy have failed philosophically and in policy. She supports a social value of privacy with three dimensions: shared perceptions, public values, and [[Collectivism|collective]] components. Shared ideas about privacy allows freedom of conscience and diversity in thought. Public values guarantee democratic participation, including freedoms of speech and association, and limits government power. Collective elements describe privacy as collective good that cannot be divided. Regan's goal is to strengthen privacy claims in policy making: "if we did recognize the collective or public-good value of privacy, as well as the common and public value of privacy, those advocating privacy protections would have a stronger basis upon which to argue for its protection".&lt;ref&gt;Regan, P. M. (1995). Legislating privacy: Technology, social values, and public policy. Chapel Hill, U.S.: The University of North Carolina Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Leslie Regan Shade argues that the human right to privacy is necessary for meaningful democratic participation, and ensures human dignity and autonomy. Privacy depends on norms for how information is distributed, and if this is appropriate. Violations of privacy depend on context. The human right to privacy has precedent in the [[United Nations Declaration of Human Rights]]: "Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers."&lt;ref&gt;United Nations. (1948). Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Retrieved October 7, 2006 from {{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/Overview/rights.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208080853/http://www.un.org/Overview/rights.html |archivedate=2014-12-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shade believes that privacy must be approached from a people-centered perspective, and not through the marketplace.&lt;ref&gt;Shade, L. R. (2008). Reconsidering the right to privacy in Canada. Bulletin of Science, Technology &amp; Society, 28(1), 80–91.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protection==
[[File:Privacy International 2007 privacy ranking map.png|thumb|300px|[[Privacy International]] 2007 privacy ranking&lt;br /&gt;green: Protections and safeguards&lt;br /&gt;red: Endemic surveillance societies]]

Most countries give citizen rights to privacy in their constitutions.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=3–4}} Representative examples of this include the ''[[Constitution of Brazil]]'', which says "the privacy, private life, honor and image of people are inviolable"; the ''[[Constitution of South Africa]]'' says that "everyone has a right to privacy"; and the ''[[Constitution of the Republic of Korea]]'' says "the privacy of no citizen shall be infringed."{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=3–4}} Among most countries whose constitutions do not explicitly describe privacy rights, court decisions have interpreted their constitutions to intend to give privacy rights.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=3–4}}

Many countries have broad privacy laws outside their constitutions, including Australia’s [[Privacy Act 1988]], Argentina’s Law for the Protection of Personal Data of 2000, Canada’s 2000 [[Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act]], and Japan’s 2003 Personal Information Protection Law.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=3–4}}

Beyond national privacy laws, there are international privacy agreements.{{sfn|Solove|2008|p=3}} The United Nations [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] says "No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honor and reputation."{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=3–4}} The [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] published its Privacy Guidelines in 1980. The [[European Union]]'s 1995 [[Data Protection Directive]] guides privacy protection in Europe.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=3–4}} The 2004 Privacy Framework by the [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]] is a privacy protection agreement for the members of that organization.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=3–4}}

In the 1960s people began to consider how changes in technology were bringing changes in the concept of privacy.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=3–4}} [[Vance Packard]]’s ''[[The Naked Society]]'' was a popular book on privacy from that era and led discourse on privacy at that time.{{sfn|Solove|2008|pp=3–4}}

===Free market versus consumer protection approaches===
Approaches to privacy can, broadly, be divided into two categories: free market, and consumer protection.&lt;ref name="quinn"&gt;{{cite book | title=Ethics for the Information Age | author=Quinn, Michael J. | year=2009 | isbn=0-321-53685-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a free market approach, commercial entities are largely allowed to do what they wish, with the expectation that consumers will choose to do business with corporations that respect their privacy to a desired degree. If some companies are not sufficiently respectful of privacy, they will lose market share. Such an approach may be limited by lack of competition in a market, by enterprises not offering privacy options favorable to the user, or by lack of information about actual privacy practices. Claims of privacy protection made by companies may be difficult for consumers to verify, except when they have already been violated.

In a consumer protection approach, in contrast, it is claimed that individuals may not have the time or knowledge to make informed choices, or may not have reasonable alternatives available. In support of this view, Jensen and Potts showed that most privacy policies are above the reading level of the average person.&lt;ref name="Jensen"&gt;{{cite journal | title= Privacy policies as decision-making tools: an evaluation of online privacy notices | author=Jensen, Carlos | year=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, this approach advocates greater government definition and enforcement of privacy standards.

===Privacy law===
{{Main|Privacy law}}

Privacy law is the area of law concerning the protecting and preserving of privacy rights of individuals. While there is no universally accepted privacy law among all countries, some organizations promote certain concepts be enforced by individual countries. For example, the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], article 12, states:

:''No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honor and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.''

====Australia====
{{main |Privacy in Australian law}}

The ''Privacy Act 1988'' is administered by the [https://www.oaic.gov.au Office of the Australian Information Commissioner].

Privacy law has been evolving in Australia for a number of years. The initial introduction of privacy law in 1998 extended to the public sector, specifically to Federal government departments, under the Information Privacy Principles. State government agencies can also be subject to state based privacy legislation. This built upon the already existing privacy requirements that applied to telecommunications providers (under Part 13 of the ''Telecommunications Act 1997''), and confidentiality requirements that already applied to banking, legal and patient / doctor relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy-law/|title=Privacy Law|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Privacy Act 1988'' was then extended to include the private sector in 2000 with the introduction of the National Privacy Principles. These took effect in 2001. Small businesses with an annual turnover of $3m were excluded from meeting the obligations specified in the National Privacy Principles with some exceptions such as those whose primary business was dealing in personal information.

In 2008 the Australian Law Reform Commission (ALRC) conducted a review of Australian Privacy Law. The resulting report [http://www.alrc.gov.au/publications/report-108 For Your Information] was one of the largest reports ever released by the ALRC. Amongst its many recommendations were the consolidation of both the Information Privacy Principles and the National Privacy Principles to form what is now known as the Australian Privacy Principles.

This recommendation, and many others, were taken up and implemented by the Australian Government via the [https://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2012A00197 Privacy Amendment (Enhancing Privacy Protection) Bill 2012].

The Australian Privacy Principles, along with other key changes to the overall Act, took effect on 12 March 2014. The new structure of the privacy principles follow the information cycle and incorporate key emerging privacy concepts including privacy by design.

There are currently 14 Australian Privacy Principles:

# open and transparent management of personal information
# anonymity and pseudonymity

As of 22 February 2018, the Privacy Amendment (Notifiable Data Breaches) Act 2017 will introduce a mandatory data breach notification obligations for all organisations that are subject to Australia’s Privacy Act 1988 (Cth). This includes all Australian-registered companies and foreign-registered companies that carry on business in Australia or that interact with Australian data subjects.

===== Other Australian privacy laws =====

There are a range of other laws that provide privacy protection in Australia. These include, but are not limited to, the ''Telecommunications Act 1997'', ''Spam Act 2006'', the ''Do Not Call Register Act 2009'', general confidentiality obligations arising from certain professional relationships including with doctors, lawyers and other health providers, state based legislation including NSW [[Employee monitoring|workplace surveillance]] laws, state based laws that apply in NSW, Queensland and other states for the handling of health information and the handling of information by state government agencies.

====Brazil====
The [[Constitution of Brazil]] sets privacy as a major fundamental right. Even the State is not allowed to violate personal data, intimacy, private life, honor and image (article 5, incise X). In extreme situations, a judicial order can authorize some level of disclosure. But some data, such as correspondence, are absolutely inviolable, and not even judicial order can authorize the disclosure.

====China====

Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China

Article 245 Whoever unlawfully subjects another person to a body search or a search of his residence or unlawfully intrudes into another person's residence shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than three years or criminal detention. Any judicial officer who abuses his power and commits the crime mentioned in the preceding paragraph shall be given a heavier punishment.

Article 246 Whoever, by violence or other methods, publicly humiliates another person or invent stories to defame him, if the circumstances are serious, shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than three years, criminal detention, public surveillance or deprivation of political rights. The crime mentioned in the preceding paragraph shall be handled only upon complaint, except where serious harm is done to public order or to the interests of the State.

Article 252 Whoever conceals, destroys or unlawfully opens another person's letter, thereby infringing upon the citizen's right to freedom of correspondence, if the circumstances are serious, shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than one year or criminal detention.

Article 253 Any postal worker who opens without authorization or conceals or destroys mail or telegrams shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than two years or criminal detention. Whoever steals money or property by committing the crime mentioned in the preceding paragraph shall be convicted and given a heavier punishment in accordance with the provisions of Article 264 of this Law.

====Canada====
{{main |Canadian privacy law}}

[[Canadian privacy law]] is governed federally by multiple acts, including the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]], and the [[Privacy Act (Canada)]]. Mostly this legislation concerns privacy infringement by government organizations. [[Data privacy]] was first addressed with the [[Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act]], and provincial-level legislation also exists to account for more specific cases personal privacy protection against commercial organizations.

====European Union====
For [[Europe]], Article 8 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] guarantees the right to respect for private and family life, one's home and correspondence. The [[European Court of Human Rights]] in [[Strasbourg]] has developed a large body of jurisprudence defining this fundamental right to privacy.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} The [[European Union]] requires all member states to legislate to ensure that citizens have a right to privacy, through directives such as the 1995 [[Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of personal data]]. It is regulated in the [[United Kingdom]] by the [[Data Protection Act 1998]] and in France [[data protection]] is also monitored by the [[CNIL]], a governmental body which must authorize legislation concerning privacy before it can be enacted. In civil law jurisdictions, the right to privacy fell within the ambit of the right to a private life (droit a la vie privee) from which the tort could be claimed. Personality rights and the broader tort based
interpretation of the right to privacy protected correspondence, personal information and dignity. These rights gave rise to causes for damages in most civil law jurisdictions and common law jurisdictions prior to the sui generis development of Data Protection.

Although there are comprehensive regulations for data protection, some studies show that despite the laws, there is a lack of enforcement in that no institution feels responsible to control the parties involved and enforce their laws.&lt;ref&gt;Burghardt, Buchmann, Böhm, Kühling, Sivridis ''A Study on the Lack of Enforcement of Data Protection Acts'' Proceedings of the 3rd int. conference on e-democracy, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The European Union is also championing for the 'Right to be Forgotten' concept (which allows individuals to ask that links leading to information about themselves be removed from internet search engine results) to be adopted by other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/12/03/french-official-campaigns-to-make-right-to-be-forgotten-global/|title=French Official Campaigns to Make 'Right to be Forgotten' Global|first=Mark|last=Scott|date=3 December 2014|website=nytimes.com|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''India'''

Due to the introduction of the Aadhaar project inhabitants of India were afraid that their privacy could be invaded. The project was also met with mistrust regarding the safety of the social protection infrastructures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Masiero|first=Silvia|date=2018-09-24|title=Explaining Trust in Large Biometric Infrastructures: A Critical Realist Case Study of India's Aadhaar Project|url=https://doi.org/10.1002/isd2.12053|journal=The Electronic Journal of Information Systems in Developing Countries|language=en|pages=e12053|doi=10.1002/isd2.12053|issn=1681-4835}}&lt;/ref&gt; To tackle the fear amongst the people, India’s supreme court put a new ruling into action that stated that privacy from then on was seen as a fundamental right.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gemalto.com/govt/customer-cases/aadhaar|title=Aadhaar: 7 changes transforming India in 2018 {{!}} Gemalto|last=|first=|date=|website=www.gemalto.com|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24th of August 2017 this new law was established.

====Italy====
In [[Italy]] the [[right to privacy]] is enshrined in Article 15 of the [[Italian Constitution|Constitution]], which states:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Italian Constitution |url=http://www.quirinale.it/page/costituzione|publisher=The official website of the Presidency of the Italian Republic |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161127152449/http://www.quirinale.it/qrnw/costituzione/pdf/costituzione_inglese.pdf |archivedate=2016-11-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Freedom and confidentiality of correspondence and of every other form of communication is inviolable. Limitations may only be imposed by judicial decision stating the reasons and in accordance with the guarantees provided by the law."

====United Kingdom====
{{main |Privacy in English law}}

In the [[United Kingdom]], it is not possible to bring an action for invasion of privacy. An action may be brought under another [[tort]] (usually breach of confidence) and privacy must then be considered under EC law. In the UK, it is sometimes a defence that disclosure of private information was in the public interest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4482073.stm Does Beckham judgment change rules?], from [[BBC News]] (retrieved 27 April 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;
There is, however, the [[Information Commissioner's Office]] (ICO), an independent public body set up to promote access to official information and protect personal information. They do this by promoting good practice, ruling on eligible complaints, giving information to individuals and organisations, and taking action when the law is broken. The relevant UK laws include: [[Data Protection Act 1998]]; [[Freedom of Information Act 2000]]; [[Environmental Information Regulations 2004]]; [[Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003|Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003]]. The ICO has also provided a "Personal Information Toolkit" online which explains in more detail the various ways of protecting privacy online.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ico.gov.uk/upload/documents/library/data_protection/practical_application/toolkit.pdf "Personal Information Toolkit"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103165639/http://www.ico.gov.uk/upload/documents/library/data_protection/practical_application/toolkit.pdf |date=2009-01-03 }} prepared by the Information Commissioner’s Office, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States====
{{main |Privacy laws of the United States}}

Although the [[United States Constitution|US Constitution]] does not explicitly include the right to privacy, individual as well as locational privacy are implicitly granted by the Constitution under the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|4th Amendment]]. The [[Supreme Court of the United States]] has found that other guarantees have "penumbras" that implicitly grant a right to privacy against government intrusion, for example in ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]'' (1965). In the United States, the right of [[freedom of speech]] granted in the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] has limited the effects of lawsuits for breach of privacy. Privacy is regulated in the US by the [[Privacy Act of 1974]], and various state laws. The Privacy Act of 1974 only applies to Federal agencies in the executive branch of the Federal government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://foia.state.gov/Learn/PrivacyAct.aspx|title = The Privacy Act|date = 2015-05-22|accessdate = 2015-11-19|website = Freedom of Information Act|publisher = US Department of State|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain privacy rights have been established in the United States via legislation such as the [[Children's Online Privacy Protection Act]] (COPPA),&lt;ref&gt;Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, 15 U.S.C. § 6501 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act]] (GLB), and the [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act]] (HIPAA).
&lt;ref&gt;[[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Privacy Index===
The [[Electronic Privacy Information Center]]'s Privacy Index puts Brazil, Australia, Japan and South Africa in the higher level of privacy (around 2.2). On the bottom of the list are the United States and United Kingdom (around 1.4).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chartsbin.com/view/by8|title=International Privacy Index |publisher=Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) |date=2013-09-27 |accessdate=2013-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Privacy on the Internet===
{{Main|Internet privacy}}
{{see also|Right to be forgotten}}
There are many means to protect one's privacy on the internet. For example, e-mails can be encrypted (via [[S/MIME]] or [[Pretty Good Privacy|PGP]]) and anonymizing proxies or anonymizing networks like [[I2P]] and [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]] can be used to prevent the internet service providers from knowing which sites one visits and with whom one communicates. Covert collection of personally identifiable information has been identified as a primary concern by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.&lt;ref name="FederalTrade"&gt;Federal Trade Commission (2010), "Protecting Consumer Privacy in an Era of Rapid Change: A Proposed Framework for Businesses and Policymakers," Preliminary FTC Staff Report (December), available at [http://www.ftc.gov/os/2010/12/101201privacyreport.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt; Although some privacy advocates recommend the deletion of original and third-party [[HTTP cookies]], Anthony Miyazaki, marketing professor at [[Florida International University]] and privacy scholar, warns that the "elimination of third-party cookie use by Web sites can be circumvented by cooperative strategies with third parties in which information is transferred after the Web site's use of original domain cookies."&lt;ref&gt;Miyazaki, Anthony D. (2008), "Online Privacy and the Disclosure of Cookie Use: Effects on Consumer Trust and Anticipated Patronage," ''Journal of Public Policy &amp; Marketing'', 23 (Spring), 19–33.&lt;/ref&gt; As of December 2010, the Federal Trade Commission is reviewing policy regarding this issue as it relates to [[behavioral advertising]].&lt;ref name="FederalTrade" /&gt;
Another aspect of privacy on the Internet relates to online social networking. Several online social network sites (OSNs) are among the top 10 most visited websites globally. A review and evaluation of scholarly work regarding the current state of the value of individuals' privacy of online social networking show the following results: "first, adults seem to be more concerned about potential privacy threats than younger users; second, policy makers should be alarmed by a large part of users who underestimate risks of their information privacy on OSNs; third, in the case of using OSNs and its services, traditional one-dimensional privacy approaches fall short".&lt;ref&gt;Hugl, Ulrike (2011), "Reviewing Person’s Value of Privacy of Online Social Networking," ''Internet Research'', 21(4), in press, http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journals.htm?issn=1066-2243&amp;volume=21&amp;issue=4&amp;articleid=1926600&amp;show=abstract.&lt;/ref&gt; This is exacerbated by the research indicating that personal traits such as sexual orientation, race, religious and political views, personality, or intelligence can be inferred based on the wide variety of digital footprint, such as samples of text, browsing logs, or Facebook Likes.&lt;ref name="Kosinski 2013 5802–5805" /&gt;

===Privacy and location-based services===

Increasingly, mobile devices facilitate location tracking.  This creates user privacy problems.  A user's location and preferences constitute personal information.  Their improper use violates that user's privacy.  A recent MIT study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=de Montjoye|first=Yves-Alexandre|author2=César A. Hidalgo |author3=Michel Verleysen |author4=Vincent D. Blondel |title=Unique in the Crowd: The privacy bounds of human mobility|journal=Scientific Reports|date=March 25, 2013|doi=10.1038/srep01376|url=http://www.nature.com/srep/2013/130325/srep01376/full/srep01376.html|accessdate=12 April 2013 |volume=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Palmer|first=Jason|title=Mobile location data 'present anonymity risk'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-21923360|accessdate=12 April 2013|newspaper=BBC News|date=March 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; by de Montjoye et al. showed that 4 spatio-temporal points, approximate places and times, are enough to uniquely identify 95% of 1.5M people in a mobility database. The study
further shows that these constraints hold even when the resolution of the dataset is low. Therefore, even coarse or blurred datasets provide little anonymity.

Several methods to protect user privacy in [[location-based service]]s have been proposed, including the use of anonymizing servers, blurring of information e.a. Methods to quantify privacy have also been proposed, to calculate the equilibrium between the benefit of providing accurate location information and the drawbacks of risking personal privacy.&lt;ref&gt;Athanasios S. Voulodimos and Charalampos Z. Patrikakis, "Quantifying Privacy in Terms of Entropy for Context Aware Services", special issue of the Identity in the Information Society journal, "Identity Management in Grid and SOA", Springer, vol. 2, no 2, December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Users of such services may also choose to display more generic location information (i.e. "In the City" or "Philadelphia" or "Work") to some of their more casual acquaintances while only displaying specific location information, such as their exact address, to closer contacts like spouse, relatives, and good friends.

In recent years, seen with the increasing importance of mobile devices and paired with the ''[[National Do Not Call Registry]]'', telemarketers have turned attention to mobiles.&lt;ref name = "Telemarketers and Mobiles"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/sneaky-tactics-used-by-telemarketers-and-debt-collectors-to-get-your-cell-phone-number-2011-6 |title=Sneaky tactics used by telemarketers and debt collectors to get your cell phone number |publisher=Businessinsider.com |accessdate=2012-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The efforts of telemarketers to use mobile devices have been met with both ''[[Federal Trade Commission]]'' and companies like PrivacyStar. Each year, thousands of complaints are filed to the FTC database with the help of companies and consumers.

===Privacy by design===

The principle of [[privacy by design]] states that privacy and [[data protection]] are embedded throughout the entire life cycle of [[technologies]], from the early [[design]] stage to their deployment, use and ultimate disposal.

===Privacy engineering===

The practice of constructing, ostensibly, software or information systems that adhere to given privacy policies and relevant compliances is a developing area and is known as [[Privacy engineering]]

===Privacy self-synchronization===

Privacy self-synchronization is the mode by which the stakeholders of an enterprise privacy program spontaneously contribute collaboratively to the program's maximum success. The stakeholders may be customers, employees, managers, executives, suppliers, partners or investors. When self-synchronization is reached, the model states that the personal interests of individuals toward their privacy is in balance with the business interests of enterprises who collect and use the personal information of those individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Popa, C., et. all., "Managing Personal Information: Insights on Corporate Risk and Opportunity for Privacy-Savvy Leaders", Carswell (2012), Ch. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

== Privacy paradox ==
The privacy paradox is a phenomenon in which online users state that they are concerned about their privacy but behave as if they were not.&lt;ref name="Swartz, J. 2000"&gt;Swartz, J., "'Opting In': A Privacy Paradox", The Washington Post, 03 Sep 2000, H.1.&lt;/ref&gt; While this term was coined as early as 1998,&lt;ref&gt;Bedrick, B., Lerner, B., Whitehead, B."The privacy paradox: Introduction", "News Media and the Law", Washington, D.C., Volume 22, Issue 2, Spring 1998, pp. P1-P3.&lt;/ref&gt; it wasn't used in its current popular sense until the year 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Sweat, J. "Privacy paradox: Customers want control—and coupons", InformationWeek, Manhasset Iss, 781, April 10, 2000, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Swartz, J. 2000"/&gt; In his article titled "'Opting In': A Privacy Paradox," John Schwartz wrote that "It's one of the more puzzling conundrums of online life. While companies that capitalize on the Internet's powerful potential to invade privacy are denounced as villains of the information age, millions of people type out highly personal data and send it off to Web sites they've barely heard of, with no strong legal protection against misuse of the information. …The paradox helps illustrate the complexity of the debate over privacy."

Susan B. Barnes similarly used the term “privacy paradox” to refer to the ambiguous boundary between private and public space on social media.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, S., "A privacy paradox: Social networking in the United States", 
First Monday, volume 11, number 9 (September 2006), URL: http://firstmonday.org/issues/issue11_9/barnes/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; When compared to adults, young people tend to disclose more information on social media. However, this does not mean that they are not concerned about their privacy. Susan B. Barnes gave a case in her article: in a television interview about Facebook, a student addressed her concerns about disclosing personal information online. However, when the reporter asked to see her Facebook page, she put her home address, phone numbers, and pictures of her young son on the page.

Privacy paradox has been studied and scripted in different research settings. Although several studies have shown this inconsistency between privacy attitudes and behavior among online users, the reason for the paradox still remains unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Taddicken | first1 = M | year = 2014 | title = The 'Privacy Paradox'in the Social Web: The Impact of Privacy Concerns, Individual Characteristics, and the Perceived Social Relevance on Different Forms of Self-Disclosure | url = | journal = Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication | volume = 19 | issue = 2| pages = 248–73 | doi=10.1111/jcc4.12052}}&lt;/ref&gt; A main explanation for the privacy paradox is that users lack awareness of the risks and the degree of protection.&lt;ref&gt;Acquisti, A., &amp; Gross, R. (2006, June). Imagined communities: Awareness, information sharing, and privacy on the Facebook. In ''Privacy enhancing technologies'' (pp. 36–58).

On the other hand, some researchers argue the privacy paradox comes from lack of technology literacy and from the design of sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Livingstone | first1 = S | year = 2008 | title = Taking risky opportunities in youthful content creation: teenagers' use of social networking sites for intimacy, privacy and self-expression | url = | journal = New media &amp; society | volume = 10 | issue = 3| pages = 393–411 |
doi=10.1177/1461444808089415}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, users may not know how to change their default settings even though they care about their privacy.  Psychologists particularly pointed out that the privacy paradox occurs because users must trade-off between their privacy concerns and impression management.&lt;ref&gt;Utz, S., &amp; Kramer, N. (2009). The privacy paradox on social network sites revisited: The role of individual characteristics and group norms. ''Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace,'' ''3''(2), article 1.

[http://www.cyberpsychology.eu/view.php?cisloclanku=2009111001&amp;article=1 http://cyberpsychology.eu/view.php?cisloclanku=2009111001&amp;article=1]
&lt;/ref&gt; Other individual factors such as gender, age, trust and personality, may also account for the paradox.

== The right to privacy in popular culture ==

The 1993 film ''[[The Pelican Brief (film)|The Pelican Brief]]'', based on the [[The Pelican Brief|novel of the same name]], touches on privacy.  In one scene, a law professor discusses the Constitutional right to privacy. One of his students, played by [[Julia Roberts]], argues that the majority opinion in [[Bowers v. Hardwick|Bowers v Hardwick]] was wrongly decided.

In the TV series [[West Wing]], in the 1999 episode ''Short List'', the right to privacy arises during the appointment of a [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] judge.  [[Sam Seabourne]] ventures the opinion that [[Internet]] privacy will be a major social issue in the next two decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://westwingtranscripts.com/search.php?flag=getTranscript&amp;id=9|title=Search or Browse The West Wing Transcripts -- View or Search transcripts and summaries|author=|date=|website=westwingtranscripts.com|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Selfie culture ===
[[Selfies]] are popular today; a search for photos with the hashtag #selfie retrieves over 23 million results on Instagram and "a whopping 51 million with the hashtag #me"  However, due to modern corporate and governmental surveillance, this may pose a risk to privacy.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Giroux|first=Henry A.|date=2015-05-04|title=Selfie Culture in the Age of Corporate and State Surveillance|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09528822.2015.1082339|journal=Third Text|volume=29|issue=3|pages=155–164|doi=10.1080/09528822.2015.1082339|issn=0952-8822}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a research which takes a sample size of 3763, researchers found that for selfies, females generally have greater concerns than male social media users. Users who have greater concerns inversely predict their selfie behavior and activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dhir|first=Amandeep|last2=Torsheim|first2=Torbjørn|last3=Pallesen|first3=Ståle|last4=Andreassen|first4=Cecilie S.|date=2017|title=Do Online Privacy Concerns Predict Selfie Behavior among Adolescents, Young Adults and Adults?|url=http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00815/full|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|language=English|volume=8|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00815|issn=1664-1078}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Public health''' is "the science and art of preventing disease, prolonging life and promoting human [[health]] through organized efforts and informed choices of society, organizations, public and private, communities and individuals".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[Charles-Edward Amory Winslow|Winslow, Charles-Edward Amory]]|title=The Untilled Field of Public Health |journal=Modern Medicine |date=1920 |volume=2 |pages=183–191 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Analyzing the health of a population and the threats is the basis for public health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdcfoundation.org/content/what-public-health|title=What is Public Health|last=|first=|date=|website=Centers for Disease Control Foundation|publisher=Atlanta, GA: Centers for Disease Control|access-date=27 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "public" in question can be as small as a handful of people, an entire village or it can be as large as several continents, in the case of a [[pandemic]]. "Health" takes into account physical, mental and social well-being. It is not merely the absence of disease or infirmity, according to the [[World Health Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/suggestions/faq/en/ Frequently asked questions]
from the "Preamble to the Constitution of the World Health Organization" as adopted by the [[International Health Conference]], 1946&lt;/ref&gt; Public health is [[interdisciplinary]]. For example, [[epidemiology]], [[biostatistics]] and [[health services]] are all relevant. [[Environmental health]], [[community health]], [[behavioral health]], [[health economics]], [[public policy]], [[mental health]] and [[occupational safety and health|occupational safety]], gender issues in health, sexual and reproductive health are other important subfields.

Public health aims to improve the quality of life through prevention and treatment of [[disease]], including mental health. This is done through the [[Disease surveillance|surveillance]] of cases and [[health indicators]], and through the promotion of healthy behaviors. Common public health initiatives include promoting [[hand washing|handwashing]] and [[breastfeeding]], delivery of [[vaccination]]s, [[suicide prevention]] and distribution of [[condom]]s to control the spread of [[sexually transmitted disease]]s.

Modern public health practice requires [[multidisciplinarity|multidisciplinary teams]] of public health workers and professionals. Teams might include [[epidemiology|epidemiologists]], [[biostatistics|biostatisticians]], [[medical assistant]]s, [[public health nursing|public health nurses]], [[midwives]], [[microbiologist|medical microbiologists, economists, sociologists, geneticists and data managers.]]  Depending on the need [[environmental health officer]]s or [[public health inspector]]s, [[Bioethics|bioethicists]], and even [[veterinarian]]s, gender experts, sexual and reproductive health specialists might be called on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Joint Task Group on Public Health Human Resources |author2=Advisory Committee on Health Delivery &amp; Human Resources |author3=Advisory Committee on Population Health &amp; Health Security |publisher=Public Health Agency of Canada |title=Building the public health workforce for the 21st century |location=Ottawa |year=2005 |oclc=144167975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Access to [[health care]] and public health initiatives are difficult challenges in [[developing nations|developing countries]]. Public health infrastructures are still forming in those countries.

==Background==
The focus of a [[public health intervention]] is to prevent and manage diseases, injuries and other health conditions through surveillance of cases and the [[health promotion|promotion of healthy behaviors]], [[healthy community design|communities]] and [[environmental protection|environments]]. Many diseases are preventable through simple, nonmedical methods. For example, research has shown that the simple act of [[hand washing|handwashing]] with soap can prevent the spread of many contagious diseases.&lt;ref&gt;Global Public-Private Partnership for Handwashing with Soap. [http://www.globalhandwashing.org/handwashing-resources ''Handwashing research''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101216125536/http://globalhandwashing.org/handwashing-resources |date=16 December 2010 }}, accessed 19 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases, treating a disease or controlling a [[pathogen]] can be vital to preventing its spread to others, either during an outbreak of [[infectious disease]] or through [[food contamination|contamination of food]] or [[water contamination|water]] supplies. [[Behavior change (public health)|Public health communications programs]], [[vaccination]] programs and distribution of [[condom]]s are examples of common preventive public health measures. Measures such as these have contributed greatly to the health of populations and increases in life expectancy.

Public health plays an important role in disease prevention efforts in both the developing world and in developed countries through local health systems and [[non-governmental organization]]s. The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) is the international agency that coordinates and acts on [[global health|global public health]] issues. Most countries have their own government public health agencies, sometimes known as ministries of health, to respond to domestic health issues. For example, in the [[United States]], the front line of public health initiatives are state and local [[health department]]s. The [[United States Public Health Service]] (PHS), led by the [[Surgeon General of the United States]], and the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], headquartered in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]], are involved with several international health activities, in addition to their national duties. In Canada, the [[Public Health Agency of Canada]] is the national agency responsible for public health, emergency preparedness and response, and infectious and [[chronic disease]] control and prevention. The [[Public health system in India]] is managed by the Ministry of Health &amp; Family Welfare of the government of India with state-owned health care facilities.

Most governments recognize the importance of public health programs in reducing the incidence of disease, disability, and the effects of aging and other physical and mental health conditions. However, public health generally receives significantly less government funding compared with medicine.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. "Public health principles and neurological disorders. In: ''Neurological Disorders: Public Health Challenges.'' Geneva; 2006 - http://www.who.int/mental_health/neurology/neurodiso/en/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; Public health programs providing [[vaccination]]s have made strides in promoting health, including the eradication of [[smallpox]], a disease that plagued humanity for thousands of years.
[[File:Directors of Global Smallpox Eradication Program.jpg|thumb|Three former directors of the [[Smallpox#Eradication|Global Smallpox Eradication Programme]] read the news that smallpox had been globally eradicated, 1980]]

The World Health Organization (WHO) identifies core functions of public [[health]] programs including:&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/about/role/en/ ''The role of WHO in public health''], accessed 19 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
* providing leadership on matters critical to health and engaging in partnerships where joint action is needed;
* shaping a [[research]] agenda and stimulating the generation, translation and [[dissemination]] of valuable knowledge;
* setting norms and standards and promoting and monitoring their implementation;
* articulating ethical and [[evidence-based policy]] options;
* monitoring the health situation and assessing health trends.

In particular, public health surveillance programs can:&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/topics/public_health_surveillance/en/ ''Public health surveillance''], accessed 19 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
* serve as an [[early warning system]] for impending public health emergencies;
* document the impact of an intervention, or track progress towards specified goals; and
* monitor and clarify the epidemiology of health problems, allow priorities to be set, and inform [[public health policy|health policy]] and strategies.
* diagnose, investigate, and monitor health problems and health hazards of the community

Public health surveillance has led to the identification and prioritization of many public health issues facing the world today, including [[HIV/AIDS]], [[diabetes]], [[waterborne diseases]], [[zoonosis|zoonotic diseases]], and [[antibiotic resistance]] leading to the reemergence of infectious diseases such as [[tuberculosis]]. Antibiotic resistance, also known as drug resistance, was the theme of [[World Health Day|World Health Day 2011]]. Although the prioritization of pressing public health issues is important, Laurie Garrett argues that there are following consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Garrett Laurie | year = 2007 | title = The Challenge of Global Health | url = | journal = Foreign Affairs | volume = 86 | issue = 1| pages = 14–38 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When foreign aid is funnelled into disease-specific programs, the importance of public health in general is disregarded. This public health problem of [[stovepiping]] is thought to create a lack of funds to combat other existing diseases in a given country.

For example, the WHO reports that at least 220 million people worldwide suffer from diabetes. Its incidence is increasing rapidly, and it is projected that the number of diabetes deaths will double by the year 2030.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs312/en/ ''Diabetes Fact Sheet N°312'', January 2011]. Accessed 19 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In a June 2010 editorial in the medical journal ''[[The Lancet]]'', the authors opined that "The fact that [[type 2 diabetes]], a largely preventable disorder, has reached epidemic proportion is a public health humiliation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = | title = Type 2 diabetes—time to change our approach | journal = The Lancet | volume = 375 | issue = 9733 | pages = 2193 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20609952 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(10)61011-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The risk of type 2 diabetes is closely linked with the growing problem of [[obesity]]. The WHO’s latest estimates as of June 2016 highlighted that globally approximately 1.9 billion adults were overweight in 2014, and 41 million children under the age of five were overweight in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs311/en/ ''Obesity and overweight Fact sheet N°311'', Updated June 2016.] Accessed 19 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The United States is the leading country with 30.6% of its population being obese. Mexico follows behind with 24.2% and the United Kingdom with 23%. Once considered a problem in high-income countries, it is now on the rise in low-income countries, especially in urban settings. Many public health programs are increasingly dedicating attention and resources to the issue of obesity, with objectives to address the underlying causes including [[healthy diet]] and [[physical exercise]].

Some programs and policies associated with public health promotion and prevention can be controversial. One such example is programs focusing on the prevention of [[HIV]] transmission through [[safe sex]] campaigns and [[needle-exchange programme]]s. Another is the control of [[tobacco smoking]]. Changing smoking behavior requires long-term strategies, unlike the fight against [[communicable diseases]], which usually takes a shorter period for effects to be observed. Many nations have implemented [[tobacco smoking#Public policy|major initiatives]] to cut smoking, such as increased taxation and bans on smoking in some or all public places. Proponents{{Who|date=May 2014}} argue by presenting evidence that smoking is one of the major killers, and that therefore governments have a duty to reduce the death rate, both through limiting [[Passive smoking|passive (second-hand) smoking]] and by providing fewer opportunities for people to smoke. Opponents{{Who|date=May 2014}} say that this undermines individual freedom and personal responsibility, and worry that the state may be emboldened to remove more and more choice in the name of better population health overall.

Simultaneously, while communicable diseases have historically ranged uppermost as a [[global health]] priority, [[non-communicable disease]]s and the underlying behavior-related risk factors have been at the bottom. This is changing, however, as illustrated by the [[United Nations]] hosting its first General Assembly Special Summit on the issue of non-communicable diseases in September 2011.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations. [https://www.un.org/News/briefings/docs//2010/100513_Diseases.doc.htm ''Press Conference on General Assembly Decision to Convene Summit in September 2011 on Non-Communicable Diseases''.] New York, 13 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many health problems are due to maladaptive personal behaviors. From an [[evolutionary psychology]] perspective, over consumption of novel substances that are harmful is due to the activation of an evolved [[reward system]] for substances such as drugs, tobacco, alcohol, refined salt, fat, and carbohydrates. New technologies such as modern transportation also cause reduced physical activity. Research has found that behavior is more effectively changed by taking evolutionary motivations into consideration instead of only presenting information about health effects. The marketing industry has long known the importance of associating products with high status and attractiveness to others. Films are increasingly being recognized as a public health tool&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Uy Hoang, Stella B, May CI van S|title=What’s in the ‘Public Health Toolbox’|journal=JOJ Pub Health|year=2018|volume=3|issue=2|page=555607|url=https://juniperpublishers.com/jojph/pdf/JOJPH.MS.ID.555607.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In fact, [[Public Health Film Festival|film festivals]] and [[International Public Health Film Competition|competitions]] have been established to specifically promote films about health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1177/1757913915619120|pmid=26702114|title=Reflections on the United Kingdom's first public health film festival|journal=Perspectives in Public Health|volume=136|issue=1|pages=23–24|year=2016|last1=Botchway|first1=Stella|last2=Hoang|first2=Uy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, it has been argued that emphasizing the harmful and undesirable effects of tobacco smoking on other persons and imposing smoking bans in public places have been particularly effective in reducing tobacco smoking.&lt;ref&gt;Valerie Curtis and Robert Aunger. "Motivational mismatch: evolved motives as the source of—and solution to—global public health problems". In {{Cite book | last1 = Roberts | first1 = S.

Craig | editor1-last = Roberts }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Applications in health care===
As well as seeking to improve population health through the implementation of specific population-level interventions, public health contributes to medical care by identifying and assessing population needs for [[health care]] services, including:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gillam Stephen|author2=Yates, Jan|author3=Badrinath, Padmanabhan |title=Essential Public Health : theory and practice |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2007 |oclc=144228591}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Pencheon, David |author1=Pencheon, David |author2=Guest, Charles |author3=Melzer, David |author4=Gray, JA Muir |title=Oxford Handbook of Public Health Practice |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2006 |oclc=663666786}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Smith, Sarah |author2=Sinclair, Don |author3=Raine, Rosalind |author4=Reeves, Barnarby |title=Health Care Evaluation |series=Understanding Public Health |publisher=Open University Press |year=2005|oclc=228171855}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Sanderson, Colin J. |author2=Gruen, Reinhold |title=Analytical Models for Decision Making |series=Understanding Public Health |publisher=Open University Press |year=2006 |oclc=182531015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Assessing current services and evaluating whether they are meeting the objectives of the [[health care system]]
* Ascertaining requirements as expressed by [[health care provider|health professionals]], the public and other stakeholders
* Identifying the most appropriate interventions
* Considering the effect on resources for proposed interventions and assessing their cost-effectiveness
* Supporting decision making in health care and planning health services including any necessary changes.
* Informing, educating, and empowering people about health issues

===Implementing effective improvement strategies===
To improve public health, one important strategy is to promote modern medicine and scientific neutrality to drive the public health policy and campaign, which is recommended by Armanda Solorzana, through a case study of the Rockefeller Foundation's hookworm campaign in Mexico in the 1920s.  Soloranza argues that public health policy can't concern only politics or economics.  Political concerns can lead government officials to hide the real numbers of people affected by disease in their regions, such as upcoming elections. Therefore, scientific neutrality in making public health policy is critical; it can ensure treatment needs are met regardless of political and economic conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Birn | first1 = A. E. | last2 = Solórzano | first2 = A. | title = Public health policy paradoxes: Science and politics in the Rockefeller Foundation's hookworm campaign in Mexico in the 1920s | journal = Social Science &amp; Medicine | volume = 49 | issue = 9 | pages = 1197–1213 | year = 1999 | pmid =  10501641| pmc =  | doi = 10.1016/S0277-9536(99)00160-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of public health care clearly shows the global effort to improve health care for all.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} However, in modern-day medicine, real, measurable change has not been clearly seen, and critics argue that this lack of improvement is due to ineffective methods that are being implemented. As argued by Paul E. Farmer, structural interventions could possibly have a large impact, and yet there are numerous problems as to why this strategy has yet to be incorporated into the health system. One of the main reasons that he suggests could be the fact that physicians are not properly trained to carry out structural interventions, meaning that the ground level health care professionals cannot implement these improvements. While structural interventions can not be the only area for improvement, the lack of coordination between socioeconomic factors and health care for the poor could be counterproductive, and end up causing greater inequity between the health care services received by the rich and by the poor. Unless health care is no longer treated as a commodity, global public health will ultimately not be achieved.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} This being the case, without changing the way in which health care is delivered to those who have less access to it, the universal goal of public health care cannot be achieved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Farmer | first1 = P. E. | last2 = Nizeye | first2 = B. | last3 = Stulac | first3 = S. | last4 = Keshavjee | first4 = S. | title = Structural Violence and Clinical Medicine | journal = PLoS Medicine | volume = 3 | issue = 10 | pages = e449 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17076568 | pmc = 1621099 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pmed.0030449 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another reason why measurable changes may not be noticed in public health is because agencies themselves may not be measuring their programs' efficacy. Perrault et al.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Perrault|first=Evan K.|last2=Inderstrodt-Stephens|first2=Jill|last3=Hintz|first3=Elizabeth A.|date=7 December 2017|title=Tracking Success: Outputs Versus Outcomes—A Comparison of Accredited and Non-Accredited Public Health Agencies' Community Health Improvement Plan objectives|journal=Journal of Community Health|volume=43|issue=3|language=en|pages=1–8|doi=10.1007/s10900-017-0454-0|pmid=29218542|issn=0094-5145}}&lt;/ref&gt; analyzed over 4,000 published objectives from Community Health Improvement Plans (CHIPs) of 280 local accredited and non-accredited public health agencies in the U.S., and found that the majority of objectives - around two-thirds - were focused on achieving agency outputs (e.g., developing communication plans, installing sidewalks, disseminating data to the community).  Only about one-third focused on seeking measurable changes in the populations they serve (i.e., changing people's knowledge, attitudes, behaviors). What this research showcases is that if agencies are only focused on accomplishing tasks (i.e., outputs) and do not have a focus on measuring actual changes in their populations with the activities they perform, it should not be surprising when measurable changes are not reported. Perrault et al.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; advocate for public health agencies to work with those in the discipline of [[Health communication|Health Communication]] to craft objectives that are measurable outcomes, and to assist agencies in developing tools and methods to be able to track more proximal changes in their target populations (e.g., knowledge and attitude shifts) that may be influenced by the activities the agencies are performing.

=== Public Health 2.0 ===
''Public Health 2.0'' is a movement within public health that aims to make the field more accessible to the general public and more user-driven. The term is used in three senses.  In the first sense, "Public Health 2.0" is similar to "[[Health 2.0]]" and describes the ways in which traditional public health practitioners and institutions are reaching out (or could reach out) to the public through social media and [[health blog]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Wilson, Kumanan |author2=Keelan, Jennifer  |date=May 2009 | title = Coping with public health 2.0 | journal = Canadian Medical Association Journal | volume = 180 | issue = 10 | pages = 1080 | doi = 10.1503/cmaj.090696 | pmid = 19433834 | pmc = 2679846}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Vance, K. |author2=Howe, W. |author3=Dellavalle, R.P. |date=April 2009 | title = Social internet sites as a source of public health information | journal = Dermatologic Clinics | volume = 27 | issue = 2 | pages = 133–136 | doi = 10.1016/j.det.2008.11.010 | pmid = 19254656}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second sense, "Public Health 2.0" describes public health research that uses data gathered from social networking sites, search engine queries, cell phones, or other technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://governmentfutures.com/images/stories/documents/PublicHealth2-0NotesPRINT.pdf |title=Public Health 2.0: Spreading like a virus |accessdate=13 June 2011 |date=24 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent example is the proposal of statistical framework that utilizes online user-generated content (from social media or search engine queries) to estimate the impact of an influenza vaccination campaign in the UK.&lt;ref name=DMKD&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lampos |first=Vasileios |last2=Yom-Tov |first2=Elad |last3=Pebody |first3=Richard| last4=Cox |first4=Ingemar J. |date=2 July 2015 |title=Assessing the impact of a health intervention via user-generated Internet content |journal=Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery | doi=10.1007/s10618-015-0427-9 |volume=29 |issue=5 |pages=1434–1457}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the third sense, "Public Health 2.0" is used to describe public health activities that are completely user-driven.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.publichealth2point0.ca |title=Public Health 2.0 FAQs |accessdate=13 June 2011 |author=DLSPH Conference Planning Committee | publisher=Public Health 2.0 Conference}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example is the collection and sharing of information about [[environmental radiation]] levels after the March 2011 tsunami in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia/2011/04/201142317359479927.html |title=Crowdsourcing Japan's radiation levels |accessdate= 13 June 2011 |author = D. Parvaz |date=26 April 2011 |publisher=Al Jazeera}}&lt;/ref&gt; In all cases, Public Health 2.0 draws on ideas from [[Web 2.0]], such as [[crowdsourcing]], [[information sharing]], and [[user-centred design]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Hardey, Michael |date=July 2008 | title = Public health and Web 2.0 | journal = Perspectives in Public Health | volume = 128 | issue = 4 | pages = 181–189 | doi=10.1177/1466424008092228}}&lt;/ref&gt; While many individual healthcare providers have started making their own personal contributions to "Public Health 2.0" through personal blogs, social profiles, and websites, other larger organizations, such as the [[American Heart Association]] (AHA) and United Medical Education (UME), have a larger team of employees centered around online driven health education, research, and training. These private organizations recognize the need for free and easy to access health materials often building libraries of educational articles.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

There is a great disparity in access to [[health care]] and public health initiatives between [[developed nations]] and [[developing nations]]. In the developing world, public health infrastructures are still forming. There may not be enough trained [[health workforce|health workers,]] monetary resources or, in some cases, sufficient knowledge to provide even a basic level of medical care and disease prevention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Lincoln C Chen |author2=David Evans |author3=Tim Evans |author4=Ritu Sadana |author5=Barbara Stilwell |author6=Phylida Travis |author7=Wim Van Lerberghe |author8=Pascal Zurn |title=World Health Report 2006: working together for health |location=Geneva |publisher=WHO |year=2006 |oclc=71199185 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jamison 15–22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jamison|first=D T|last2=Mosley|first2=W H|date=January 1991|title=Disease control priorities in developing countries: health policy responses to epidemiological change.|journal=American Journal of Public Health|language=en|volume=81|issue=1|pages=15–22|doi=10.2105/ajph.81.1.15|pmid=1983911|issn=0090-0036|pmc=1404931}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, a large majority of disease and mortality in the developing world results from and contributes to extreme poverty. For example, many African governments spend less than [[United States dollar|US$]]10 per person per year on health care, while, in the United States, the [[federal government of the United States|federal government]] spent approximately US$4,500 per capita in 2000. However, expenditures on health care should not be confused with spending on public health. Public health measures may not generally be considered "health care" in the strictest sense. For example, mandating the use of seat belts in cars can save countless lives and contribute to the health of a population, but typically money spent enforcing this rule would not count as money spent on health care.

Large parts of the developing world remained plagued by largely preventable or treatable infectious diseases.  In addition to this however, many [[developing countries]] are also experiencing an epidemiological shift and polarization in which populations are now experiencing more of the effects of chronic diseases as life expectancy increases with, the poorer communities being heavily affected by both chronic and infectious diseases.&lt;ref name="Jamison 15–22"/&gt; Another major public health concern in the developing world is poor [[Maternal health|maternal]] and child health, exacerbated by [[malnutrition]] and poverty.  The [[WHO]] reports that a lack of [[Breastfeeding#Exclusive breastfeeding|exclusive breastfeeding]] during the first six months of life contributes to over a million avoidable child deaths each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=World Health Organization |url=http://www.who.int/features/factfiles/breastfeeding/en/index.html |title=10 facts on breastfeeding |accessdate=20 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Intermittent preventive therapy]] aimed at treating and preventing [[malaria]] episodes among pregnant women and young children is one public health measure in [[endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] countries.

Each day brings new front-page headlines about public health: emerging infectious diseases such as [[SARS]], rapidly making its way from China (see [[Public health in China]]) to Canada, the United States and other geographically distant countries; reducing [[health equity|inequities in health care access]] through publicly funded health insurance programs; the [[HIV/AIDS pandemic]] and its spread from certain high-risk groups to the general population in many countries, such as in [[HIV/AIDS in South Africa|South Africa]]; the increase of [[childhood obesity]] and the concomitant increase in type II diabetes among children; the social, economic and health effects of [[adolescent pregnancy]]; and the public health challenges related to [[natural disaster]]s such as the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|2004 Indian Ocean tsunami]], [[Hurricane Katrina|2005's Hurricane Katrina]] in the United States and the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]].

Since the 1980s, the growing field of [[population health]] has broadened the focus of public health from individual behaviors and [[risk factor]]s to population-level issues such as [[health equity|inequality]], poverty, and education. Modern public health is often concerned with addressing determinants of health across a population. There is a recognition that our health is affected by many factors including where we live, genetics, our income, our educational status and our social relationships; these are known as "[[social determinants of health]]". The upstream drivers such as environment, education, employment, income, food security, housing, social inclusion and many others effect the distribution of health between and within populations and are often shaped by policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7JxutqCmctUC&amp;pg=PP2&amp;dq=health+policy+interventions+-+the+United+Nations#v=onepage&amp;q=health%20policy%20interventions%20-%20the%20United%20Nations&amp;f=false|title=Equity, Social Determinants and Public Health Programmes|last=Organization|first=World Health|date=2010|publisher=World Health Organization|isbn=9789241563970|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A social gradient in health runs through society. The poorest generally suffer the worst health, but even the middle classes will generally have worse health outcomes than those of a higher social stratum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Solid Facts: Social Determinants of Health |editor=Richard G.

=== Health aid in developing countries ===
{{Main|Aid}}Health aid to developing countries is an important source of public health funding for many developing countries.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bendavid|first=Eran|last2=Bhattacharya|first2=Jay|year=2014|title=The Relationship of Health Aid to Population Health Improvements |journal=JAMA Internal Medicine|volume=174|issue=6|pages=881–887|doi=10.1001/jamainternmed.2014.292 |pmc=4777302|pmid=24756557}}&lt;/ref&gt; Health aid to developing countries has shown a significant increase after World War II as concerns over the spread of disease as a result of globalization increased and the HIV/AIDS epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa surfaced.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Twumasi|first=Patrick|date=1 April 1981|title=Colonialism and international health: A study in social change in Ghana|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0160798781900375|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine.

==== International health aid debates ====
Debates exist questioning the efficacy of international health aid. Proponents of aid claim that health aid from wealthy countries is necessary in order for developing countries to escape the [[poverty trap]]. Opponents of health aid claim that international health aid actually disrupts developing countries' course of development, causes dependence on aid, and in many cases the aid fails to reach its recipients.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; For example, recently, health aid was funneled towards initiatives such as financing new technologies like antiretroviral medication, insecticide-treated mosquito nets, and new vaccines. The positive impacts of these initiatives can be seen in the eradication of smallpox and polio; however, critics claim that misuse or misplacement of funds may cause many of these efforts to never come into fruition.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Economic modeling based on the [[Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation]] and the [[World Health Organization]] has shown a link between international health aid in developing countries and a reduction in adult mortality rates.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; However, a 2014-2016 study suggests that a potential confounding variable for this outcome is the possibility that aid was directed at countries once they were already on track for improvement.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; That same study, however, also suggests that 1 billion dollars in health aid was associated with 364,000 fewer deaths occurring between ages 0 and 5 in 2011.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Sustainable development goals ===
{{Further|Sustainable Development Goals}}
To address current and future challenges in addressing health issues in the world, the [[United Nations]] have developed the [[Sustainable Development Goals]] building off of the [[Millennium Development Goals]] of 2000 to be completed by 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 2015 - United Nations sustainable development agenda|url = https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/development-agenda/#|website = United Nations Sustainable Development|accessdate = 25 November 2015|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; These goals in their entirety encompass the entire spectrum of development across nations, however Goals 1-6 directly address health disparities, primarily in developing countries.&lt;ref name=UN2015&gt;{{Cite web|title = Sustainable development goals - United Nations|url = https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/|website = United Nations Sustainable Development|accessdate = 25 November 2015|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; These six goals address key issues in [[Global health|global public health]]: [[Poverty]], Hunger and [[food security]], Health, Education, [[Gender equality]] and women's empowerment, and water and [[sanitation]].&lt;ref name=UN2015/&gt; Public health officials can use these goals to set their own agenda and plan for smaller scale initiatives for their organizations. These goals hope to lessen the burden of disease and inequality faced by developing countries and lead to a healthier future.

The links between the various sustainable development goals and public health are numerous and well established:
* Living below the poverty line is attributed to poorer health outcomes and can be even worse for persons living in developing countries where [[extreme poverty]] is more common.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = NCCP {{!}} Child Poverty|url = http://www.nccp.org/topics/childpoverty.html|website = www.nccp.org|accessdate = 25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A child born into poverty is twice as likely to die before the age of five compared to a child from a wealthier family.&lt;ref name=UNhealth2015&gt;{{Cite web|title = Health - United Nations Sustainable Development|url = https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/health/|website = United Nations Sustainable Development|accessdate = 25 November 2015|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The detrimental effects of hunger and [[malnutrition]] that can arise from systemic challenges with food security are enormous. The [[World Health Organization]] estimates that 12.9 percent of the population in developing countries is undernourished.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Hunger and food security - United Nations Sustainable Development|url = https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/hunger/|website = United Nations Sustainable Development|accessdate = 25 November 2015|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Health challenges in the developing world are enormous, with "only half of the women in developing nations receiving the recommended amount of healthcare they need.&lt;ref name=UNhealth2015/&gt; 
* [[Educational equity]] has yet to be reached in the world. Public health efforts are impeded by this, as a lack of education can lead to poorer health outcomes. This is shown by children of mothers who have no education having a lower survival rate compared to children born to mothers with primary or greater levels of education.&lt;ref name=UNhealth2015/&gt; Cultural differences in the role of women vary by country, many gender inequalities are found in developing nations. Combating these inequalities has shown to also lead to better public health outcome. 
* In studies done by the [[World Bank]] on populations in developing countries, it was found that when women had more control over household resources, the children benefit through better access to food, healthcare, and education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = World Development Report|url = https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/2124|website = openknowledge.worldbank.org|accessdate = 25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Basic [[sanitation]] resources and access to clean sources of water are a basic [[Right to water|human right]]. However, 1.8 billion people globally use a source of drinking water that is fecally contaminated, and 2.4 billion people lack access to basic sanitation facilities like [[toilet]]s or [[pit latrine]]s.&lt;ref name=UNwater2015&gt;{{Cite web|title = Water and Sanitation - United Nations Sustainable Development|url = https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/water-and-sanitation/|website = United Nations Sustainable Development|accessdate = 25 November 2015|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; A lack of these resources is what causes approximately 1000 children a day to die from [[Diarrhea|diarrhoel diseases]] that could have been prevented from better water and [[sanitation]] infrastructure.&lt;ref name=UNwater2015/&gt;

=== U.S. initiatives ===
{{Main|Global Health Initiatives}}The U.S. Global Health Initiative was created in 2009 by President Obama in an attempt to have a more holistic, comprehensive approach to improving global health as opposed to previous, disease-specific interventions.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://kaiserfamilyfoundation.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/8116.pdf|title=The U.S. Global Health Initiative|last=|first=|date=February 2011|website=Kaiser Family Foundation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Global Health Initiative is a six-year plan, "to develop a comprehensive U.S. government strategy for global health, building on the [[President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief]] (PEPFAR) to combat HIV as well as U.S. efforts to address tuberculosis (TB) and malaria, and augmenting the focus on other global health priorities, including neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), maternal, newborn and child health (MNCH), family planning and reproductive health (FP/RH), nutrition, and health systems strengthening (HSS)".&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The GHI programs are being implemented in more than 80 countries around the world and works closely with the [[United States Agency for International Development]], the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], the [[United States Deputy Secretary of State]].&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

There are seven core principles:

#Women, girls, and gender equality
#Strategic coordination and integration
#Strengthen and leverage key multilaterals and other partners
#Country-ownership
#Sustainability through Health Systems
#Improve metrics, monitoring, and evaluation
#Promote research and innovation&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

The aid effectiveness agenda is a useful tool for measuring the impact of these large scale programs such as [[The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria]] and the [[Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation|Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization]]  (GAVI) which have been successful in achieving rapid and visible results.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Global Fund claims that its efforts have provided antiretroviral treatment for over three million people worldwide.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; GAVI claims that its vaccination programs have prevented over 5 million deaths since it began in 2000.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Education and training==
Education and training of public health professionals is available throughout the world in Schools of Public Health, Medical Schools, Veterinary Schools, Schools of Nursing, and Schools of Public Affairs. The training typically requires a [[university degree]] with a focus on core disciplines of [[biostatistics]], [[epidemiology]], [[Health administration|health services administration]], [[health policy]], [[health education]], [[behavioral science]], gender issues, sexual and reproductive health, public health nutrition and [[environmental and occupational health]].&lt;ref name=mmwr4850&gt;U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services.

[http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/php-psp/mphpg-mhplg/mphp-mhpp04-eng.php Canadian Public Health Workforce Core Competencies], accessed 19 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In the global context, the field of public health education has evolved enormously in recent decades, supported by institutions such as the [[World Health Organization]] and the [[World Bank]], among others. Operational structures are formulated by strategic principles, with educational and career pathways guided by competency frameworks, all requiring modulation according to local, national and global realities. It is critically important for the health of populations that nations assess their public health human resource needs and develop their ability to deliver this capacity, and not depend on other countries to supply it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1159/000354198| pmid=23969636| pmc=5586806|title = The Imperative of Public Health Education: A Global Perspective| journal=Medical Principles and Practice| volume=22| issue=6| pages=515–529|year = 2013|last1 = White|first1 = Franklin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Schools of public health: a US perspective===
In the [[United States]], the Welch-Rose Report of 1915&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Welch|first1=William H.|last2=Rose|first2=Wickliffe|year=1915|title=Institute of Hygiene: Being a report by Dr. William H.

Even though schools of public health had already been established in [[Canada]], [[Europe]] and [[North Africa]], the United States had still maintained the traditional system of housing faculties of public health within their medical institutions.  A $25,000 donation from businessman [[Samuel Zemurray]] instituted the [[Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine|School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine at Tulane University]] in 1912 conferring its first doctor of public health degree in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Darnell|first=Regna|title=Histories of anthropology annual|year=2008|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|pages=36|isbn=978-0-8032-6664-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dyer|first=John Percy|title=Tulane: the biography of a university, 1834-1965|year=1966|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|pages=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Yale School of Public Health]] was founded by [[Charles-Edward Avory Winslow]] in 1915.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/182530966|title=A history of Yale's School of Medicine : passing torches to others|last=1933-2013,|first=Burrow, Gerard N.,|date=2002|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=9780300132885|location=New Haven|oclc=182530966}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health]] became an independent, degree-granting institution for research and training in public health, and the largest public health training facility in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;The World Book Encyclopedia, 1994, p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Education of the Physician: International Dimensions.

By 1922, schools of public health were established at [[Columbia university|Columbia]] and [[Harvard]] on the Hopkins model. By 1999 there were twenty nine schools of public health in the US, enrolling around fifteen thousand students.&lt;ref name=mmwr4850/&gt;&lt;ref name=PHP/&gt;

Over the years, the types of students and training provided have also changed. In the beginning, students who enrolled in public health schools typically had already obtained a medical degree; public health school training was largely a second degree for [[physician|medical professionals]]. However, in 1978, 69% of American students enrolled in public health schools had only a [[bachelor's degree]].&lt;ref name=mmwr4850/&gt;

===Degrees in public health===
{{Main|Professional degrees of public health}}

Schools of public health offer a variety of degrees which generally fall into two categories: professional or academic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ceph.org/pdf/Master_List.pdf|title=Schools of Public Health and Public Health Programs|date=11 March 2011|publisher=[[Council on Education for Public Health]]|accessdate=30 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two major postgraduate degrees are the [[Master of Public Health]] (MPH) or the [[Master of Science]] in Public Health (MSPH). Doctoral studies in this field include [[Doctor of Public Health]] (DrPH) and [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (PhD) in a subspeciality of greater Public Health disciplines. DrPH is regarded as a professional degree and PhD as more of an academic degree.

Professional degrees are oriented towards practice in public health settings. The [[Master of Public Health]], [[Doctor of Public Health]], [[Doctor of Health Science]] (DHSc) and the [[Master of Health Administration|Master of Health Care Administration]] are examples of degrees which are geared towards people who want careers as practitioners of public health in health departments, managed care and community-based organizations, hospitals and consulting firms, among others. [[Master of Public Health]] degrees broadly fall into two categories, those that put more emphasis on an understanding of epidemiology and statistics as the scientific basis of public health practice and those that include a more eclectic range of methodologies.  A Master of Science of Public Health is similar to an MPH but is considered an academic degree (as opposed to a professional degree) and places more emphasis on scientific methods and research.  The same distinction can be made between the DrPH and the DHSc. The DrPH is considered a professional degree and the DHSc is an academic degree.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Academic degrees are more oriented towards those with interests in the scientific basis of public health and [[preventive medicine]] who wish to pursue careers in research, university teaching in graduate programs, policy analysis and development, and other high-level public health positions. Examples of academic degrees are the [[Master of Science]], [[Doctor of Philosophy]], [[Doctor of Science]] (ScD), and [[Doctor of Health Science]] (DHSc). The doctoral programs are distinct from the MPH and other professional programs by the addition of advanced coursework and the nature and scope of a [[dissertation]] research project.

In the United States, the Association of Schools of Public Health&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asph.org/ Association of Schools of Public Health] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120911051643/http://www.asph.org/ |date=11 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; represents [[Council on Education for Public Health]] (CEPH) accredited schools of public health.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ceph.org Council on Education for Public Health]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Delta Omega]] is the [[honor society]] for graduate studies in public health. The society was founded in 1924 at the [[Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health]]. Currently, there are approximately 68 chapters throughout the United States and Puerto Rico.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deltaomega.org/ Delta Omega website] (primary source)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Early history===
[[File:Doutielt3.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The primitive nature of [[Middle Ages|medieval]] medicine rendered Europe helpless to the onslaught of the [[Black Death]] in the 14th century. Miniature from "The Chronicles of Gilles Li Muisis" (1272-1352). Bibliothèque royale de Belgique, MS 13076-77, f. 24v.]]
Public health has early roots in antiquity. From the beginnings of [[human civilization]], it was recognized that polluted [[water]] and lack of proper [[waste disposal]] spread communicable diseases (theory of [[miasma theory of disease|miasma]]). Early [[religion]]s attempted to regulate behavior that specifically related to health, from types of [[food]] eaten, to regulating certain indulgent behaviors, such as drinking [[alcohol]] or [[human sexual behaviour|sexual relations]]. [[leadership|Leaders]] were responsible for the health of their subjects to ensure social stability, [[wealth|prosperity]], and maintain order.

By [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] times, it was well understood that proper [[waste management|diversion of human waste]] was a necessary tenet of public health in urban areas. The [[History of China|ancient Chinese]] [[Traditional Chinese Medicine|medical doctors]] developed the practice of [[variolation]] following a [[smallpox]] epidemic around 1000 BC. An individual without the disease could gain some measure of immunity against it by inhaling the dried crusts that formed around lesions of infected individuals. Also, children were protected by [[inoculation|inoculating]] a scratch on their forearms with the pus from a lesion.

In 1485 the [[Republic of Venice]] established a permanent [[Venetian Magistrate for Health]] comprising supervisors of health with special attention to the prevention of the spread of epidemics in the territory from abroad. The three supervisors were initially appointed by the Venetian Senate. In 1537 it was assumed by the Grand Council, and in 1556 added two judges, with the task of control, on behalf of the Republic, the efforts of the supervisors.

However, according to [[Michel Foucault]], the plague model of [[governmentality]] was later controverted by the [[cholera]] model. A Cholera pandemic devastated Europe between 1829 and 1851, and was first fought by the use of what Foucault called "social medicine", which focused on flux, circulation of air, location of [[cemeteries]], etc. All those concerns, born of the [[miasma theory of disease]], were mixed with [[urbanism|urbanistic]] concerns for the management of populations, which Foucault designated as the concept of "[[biopower]]". The German conceptualized this in the ''[[Polizeiwissenschaft]]'' ("[[Police science]]").

===Modern public health===
The 18th century saw rapid growth in voluntary hospitals in [[England]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/History-Britains-Hospitals-Barry-Carruthers/dp/1857769058/ Carruthers, G. Barry. ''History of Britain's Hospitals'' (2005)]&lt;/ref&gt; The latter part of the century brought the establishment of the basic pattern of improvements in public health over the next two centuries: a social evil was identified, private philanthropists brought attention to it, and changing public opinion led to government action.&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/482384/public-health/35547/National-developments-in-the-18th-and-19th-centuries|title=public health|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of [[vaccination]] became prevalent in the 1800s, following the pioneering work of [[Edward Jenner]] in treating [[smallpox]]. [[James Lind]]'s discovery of the causes of [[scurvy]] amongst sailors and its mitigation via the introduction of [[fruit]] on lengthy voyages was published in 1754 and led to the adoption of this idea by the [[Royal Navy]].&lt;ref&gt;Vale, Brian.

''[[The Mariners' Mirror]]'', volume 94, number 2, May 2008, pp. 160–175.&lt;/ref&gt; Efforts were also made to promulgate health matters to the broader public; in 1752 the British physician Sir [[John Pringle (physician)|John Pringle]] published ''Observations on the Diseases of the Army in Camp and Garrison'', in which he advocated for the importance of adequate ventilation in the [[military]] [[barracks]] and the provision of [[latrine]]s for the soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | pmid=5330009 | last=Selwyn | first=S | publication-date=July 1966| year=1966 | title=Sir John Pringle: hospital reformer, moral philosopher and pioneer of antiseptics | volume=10 | issue=3 | periodical=Medical History | pages=266–74 | pmc=1033606 | doi=10.1017/s0025727300011133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the onset of the [[Industrial Revolution]], living standards amongst the working population began to worsen, with cramped and unsanitary urban conditions. In the first four decades of the 19th century alone, [[London]]'s population doubled and even greater growth rates were recorded in the new industrial towns, such as [[Leeds]] and [[Manchester]]. This rapid [[urbanisation]] exacerbated the spread of disease in the large [[conurbation]]s that built up around the [[workhouse]]s and [[factory|factories]]. These settlements were cramped and primitive with no organized [[sanitation]]. Disease was inevitable and its incubation in these areas was encouraged by the poor lifestyle of the inhabitants. Unavailable housing led to the rapid growth of [[slum]]s and the [[per capita]] [[death rate]] began to rise alarmingly, almost doubling in [[Birmingham]] and [[Liverpool]]. [[Thomas Malthus]] warned of the dangers of overpopulation in 1798. His ideas, as well as those of [[Jeremy Bentham]], became very influential in government circles in the early years of the 19th century.&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt;

====Public health legislation====
[[File:SirEdwinChadwick.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Sir [[Edwin Chadwick]] was a pivotal influence on the early public health campaign.]]
The first attempts at sanitary reform and the establishment of public health institutions were made in the 1840s. [[Thomas Southwood Smith]], physician at the [[London Fever Hospital]], began to write papers on the importance of public health, and was one of the first physicians brought in to give evidence before the [[Poor Law Commission]] in the 1830s, along with [[Neil Arnott]] and [[James Phillips Kay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Amanda J.

The [[Poor Law Commission]] reported in 1838 that "the expenditures necessary to the adoption and maintenance of measures of prevention would ultimately amount to less than the cost of the disease now constantly engendered". It recommended the implementation of large scale government [[engineering]] projects to alleviate the conditions that allowed for the propagation of disease.&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt; The [[Health of Towns Association]] was formed in [[Exeter]] on 11 December 1844, and vigorously campaigned for the development of public health in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name=Ashton&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ashton|first=John|author2=Ubido, Janet|title=The Healthy City and the Ecological Idea|journal=Journal of the Society for the Social History of Medicine|year=1991|volume=4|issue=1|pages=173–181|url=http://www.johnrashton.securemachines.co.uk/documentbank/the%20healthy%20city%20and%20the%20ecological%20idea.pdf|accessdate=8 July 2013|doi=10.1093/shm/4.1.173|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224102422/http://www.johnrashton.securemachines.co.uk/documentbank/the%20healthy%20city%20and%20the%20ecological%20idea.pdf|archivedate=24 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its formation followed the 1843 establishment of the Health of Towns Commission, chaired by Sir [[Edwin Chadwick]], which produced a series of reports on poor and insanitary conditions in British cities.&lt;ref name=Ashton/&gt;

These national and local movements led to the [[Public Health Act 1848|Public Health Act]], finally passed in 1848. It aimed to improve the sanitary condition of towns and populous places in England and Wales by placing the supply of water, sewerage, drainage, cleansing and paving under a single local body with the General Board of Health as a central authority. The Act was passed by the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] [[First Russell ministry|government]] of [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]], in response to the urging of [[Edwin Chadwick]]. Chadwick's seminal report on ''The Sanitary Condition of the Labouring Population'' was published in 1842&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=excerpt from ''Report...from the Poor Law Commissioners on an Inquiry into the Sanitary Conditions of the Labouring Population of Great Britain'' (pp.369-372) (online source)|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/history/chadwick2.html|last=Chadwick|first=Edwin|chapter=Chadwick's Report on Sanitary Conditions | year=1842| publisher=to The Victorian Web|location=added by Laura Del Col|accessdate=8 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was followed up with a supplementary report a year later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Report on the Sanitary Condition of the Labouring Population of Great Britain.

[[Vaccination]] for various diseases was made compulsory in the [[United Kingdom]] in 1851, and by 1871 legislation required a comprehensive system of registration run by appointed vaccination officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://discover.ukdataservice.ac.uk/catalogue?sn=4127 |title=Decline of Infant Mortality in England and Wales, 1871-1948 : a Medical Conundrum|accessdate=17 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further interventions were made by a series of subsequent [[Public Health Acts]], notably the [[Public Health Act 1875|1875 Act]]. Reforms included latrinization, the building of [[sanitary sewer|sewer]]s, the regular [[waste disposal|collection of garbage]] followed by [[incineration]] or disposal in a [[landfill]], the [[History of water supply|provision of clean water]] and the draining of standing water to prevent the breeding of mosquitoes.

The [[Infectious Disease (Notification) Act 1889]] mandated the reporting of infectious diseases to the local sanitary authority, which could then pursue measures such as the removal of the patient to hospital and the disinfection of homes and properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Intrusive Interventions: Public Health, Domestic Space, and Infectious Disease Surveillance in England, 1840-1914|last = Mooney|first = Graham|publisher = University of Rochester Press|year = 2015|isbn = 9781580465274|location = Rochester, NY|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the first public health organization based on a state health department and local boards of health was founded in [[New York City]] in 1866.&lt;ref&gt;United States Public Health Service, ''Municipal Health Department Practice for the Year 1923'' (Public Health Bulletin # 164, July 1926), pp.  348, 357, 364&lt;/ref&gt;

====Epidemiology====
[[File:Snow-cholera-map-1.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]]'s dot map, showing the [[Cluster (epidemiology)|clusters]] of cholera cases in the London epidemic of 1854.]]
The science of [[epidemiology]] was founded by [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]]'s identification of a polluted public water well as the source of an 1854 [[cholera]] outbreak in London. Dr. Snow believed in the [[germ theory]] of disease as opposed to the prevailing [[Miasma theory of disease|miasma theory]]. He first publicized his theory in an essay, ''On the Mode of Communication of Cholera'', in 1849, followed by a more detailed treatise in 1855 incorporating the results of his investigation of the role of the water supply in the [[Soho]] epidemic of 1854.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=t1exE1cfKXIC&amp;pg=PA87&amp;dq=%22institut+de+france%22+and+%22john+snow%22&amp;hl=fr&amp;ei=4Kx7TNabHdOeOM_xgdQG&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22institut%20de%20france%22%20and%20%22john%20snow%22&amp;f=false ''Concepts and practice of humanitarian medicine'' (2008) Par S.

Masellis] {{ISBN|0-387-72263-7}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=NSHXLkgFBBQC&amp;pg=PA290&amp;dq=%22institut+de+france%22+and+snow&amp;hl=fr&amp;ei=0Kd7TLfkGMSOOIrs2a4P&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwBA]&lt;/ref&gt;

By talking to local residents (with the help of [[Reverend Henry Whitehead]]), he identified the source of the outbreak as the public water pump on Broad Street (now [[Broadwick Street]]).  Although Snow's chemical and microscope examination of a water sample from the [[Broad Street pump]] did not conclusively prove its danger, his studies of the pattern of the disease were convincing enough to persuade the local council to disable the well pump by removing its handle.&lt;ref&gt;Vinten-Johansen, Peter,  ''et al.'' (2003). ''Cholera, Chloroform, and the Science of Medicine: A Life of John Snow''. [[Oxford University Press]]. {{ISBN|0-19-513544-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Snow later used a [[dot distribution map|dot map]] to illustrate the cluster of cholera cases around the pump.  He also used statistics to illustrate the connection between the quality of the water source and cholera cases.  He showed that the [[Southwark and Vauxhall Waterworks Company]] was taking water from sewage-polluted sections of the [[Thames]] and delivering the water to homes, leading to an increased incidence of cholera. Snow's study was a major event in the history of public health and geography.  It is regarded as the founding event of the science of [[epidemiology]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Steven Berlin Johnson|Johnson, Steven]] (2006).

====Disease control====
[[File:Paul-Louis Simond injecting plague vaccine June 4th 1898 Karachi.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Paul-Louis Simond]] injecting a plague vaccine in Karachi, 1898.]]
With the pioneering work in [[bacteriology]] of French chemist [[Louis Pasteur]] and German scientist [[Robert Koch]], methods for isolating the [[bacteria]] responsible for a given disease and vaccines for remedy were developed at the turn of the 20th century. British physician [[Ronald Ross]] identified the [[mosquito]] as the carrier of [[malaria]] and laid the foundations for combating the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://easternpanorama.in/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1123&amp;Itemid=10|title=:: Laboc Hospital - A Noble Prize Winner's Workplace|publisher=easternpanorama.in|accessdate=11 July 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105175214/http://easternpanorama.in/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1123&amp;Itemid=10|archivedate=5 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister|Joseph Lister]] revolutionized [[surgery]] by the introduction of [[antiseptic]] [[surgery]] to eliminate [[infection]].

With onset of the [[epidemiological transition]] and as the prevalence of [[Infectious disease in the 20th century|infectious diseases decreased through the 20th century]], public health began to put more focus on [[chronic diseases]] such as [[cancer]] and [[heart disease]]. Previous efforts in many developed countries had already led to dramatic reductions in the [[infant mortality rate]] using preventative methods. In Britain, the infant mortality rate fell from over 15% in 1870 to 7% by 1930.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sussex.ac.uk/webteam/gateway/file.php?name=wps-48-2012.pdf&amp;site=24|title=The declines in infant mortality and fertility: Evidence from British cities in demographic transition |accessdate=17 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Country examples ===
====France====
[[French Third Republic|France 1871-1914]]  followed well behind Bismarckian Germany, as well as Great Britain, in developing the welfare state including public health.  Tuberculosis was the most dreaded disease of the day, especially striking young people in their 20s.  Germany set up vigorous measures of public hygiene and public sanatoria, but France let private physicians handle the problem, which left it with a much higher death rate.&lt;ref&gt;Allan Mitchell, ''The Divided Path: The German Influence on Social Reform in France After 1870'' (1991) pp 252-75 [https://www.amazon.com/Divided-Path-German-Influence-Social/dp/0807857432 excerpt]&lt;/ref&gt;  The French medical profession jealously guarded its prerogatives, and public health activists were not as well organized or as influential as in Germany, Britain or the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Martha L. Hildreth, ''Doctors, Bureaucrats &amp; Public Health in France, 1888-1902'' (1987)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alisa Klaus, ''Every Child a Lion: The Origins of Maternal &amp; Infant Health Policy in the United States &amp; France, 1890-1920'' (1993).&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, there was a long battle over a [[public health law]] which began in the 1880s as a campaign to reorganize the nation's health services, to require the registration of infectious diseases, to mandate quarantines, and to improve the deficient health and housing legislation of 1850. However the reformers met opposition from bureaucrats, politicians, and physicians. Because it was so threatening to so many interests, the proposal was debated and postponed for 20 years before becoming law in 1902. Success finally came when the government realized that contagious diseases had a national security impact in weakening military recruits, and keeping the population growth rate well below Germany's.&lt;ref&gt;Ann-Louise Shapiro, "Private Rights, Public Interest, and Professional Jurisdiction: The French Public Health Law of 1902."

====United States====

{{see also|United States Public Health Service}}

Modern public health began developing in the 19th century, as a response to advances in science that led to the understanding of, the source and spread of disease. As the knowledge of contagious diseases increased, means to control them and prevent infection were soon developed. Once it became understood that these strategies would require community-wide participation, disease control began being viewed as a public responsibility. Various organizations and agencies were then created to implement these disease preventing strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK218224/|title=A History of the Public Health System|last=Health|first=Institute of Medicine (US) Committee for the Study of the Future of Public|date=1988|publisher=National Academies Press (US)|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the Public health activity in the United States took place at the municipal level before the mid-20th century. There was some activity at the national and state level as well.&lt;ref&gt;John Duffy, ''The sanitarians: a history of American public health'' (1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the administration of the second president of the United States [[John Adams]], the Congress authorized the creation of hospitals for mariners.  As the U.S. expanded, the scope of the governmental health agency expanded.
&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Visiting_Nurse_Service_of_New_York_Logo.jpg|upright=0.9|thumb|right|Logo of the [[Visiting Nurse Service of New York]], founded by nursing pioneer [[Lillian Wald]] in 1893]] --&gt;
In the United States, public health worker [[Sara Josephine Baker]], M.D. established many programs to help the poor in New York City keep their infants healthy, leading teams of nurses into the crowded neighborhoods of [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]] and teaching mothers how to dress, feed, and bathe their babies.

Another key pioneer of public health in the U.S. was [[Lillian Wald]], who founded the [[Henry Street Settlement]] house in New York.  The [[Visiting Nurse Service of New York]] was a significant organization for bringing health care to the urban poor.

Dramatic increases in average life span in the late 19th century and 20th century, is widely credited to public health achievements, such as [[vaccination]] programs and control of many infectious diseases including [[Poliomyelitis|polio]], [[diphtheria]], [[yellow fever]] and [[smallpox]]; effective health and safety policies such as [[road traffic safety]] and [[Occupational safety and health|occupational safety]]; improved [[family planning]]; [[tobacco control]] measures; and programs designed to decrease [[non-communicable disease]]s by acting on known risk factors such as a person's background, lifestyle and environment.

Another major public health improvement was the decline in the "urban penalty" brought about by improvements in [[sanitation]]. These improvements included [[Water chlorination|chlorination]] of drinking water, filtration and [[sewage treatment]] which led to the decline in deaths caused by infectious [[waterborne diseases]] such as [[cholera]] and intestinal diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cutler|first=David|author2=Grant Miller |title=The Role of Public Health Improvements in Health Advances: The Twentieth Century United States |journal=[[Demography (journal)|Demography]] |date=February 2004 |volume=42 |issue=1 |oclc=703811616 |doi=10.1353/dem.2005.0002|pages=1–22|pmid=15782893 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public health issues were important for the [[Spanish empire]] during the colonial era.  Epidemic disease was the main factor in the decline of indigenous populations in the era immediately following the sixteenth-century conquest era and was a problem during the colonial era. The Spanish crown took steps in eighteenth-century Mexico to bring in regulations to make populations healthier.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Cooper, ''Epidemic Disease in Mexico City, 1761-1813: An Administrative, Social, and Medical History''.

Though curable and preventative, malaria remains a huge public health problem and is the third leading cause of death in Ghana.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/globalhealth/countries/ghana/|title=CDC Global Health - Ghana|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the absence of a vaccine, mosquito control, or access to anti-malaria medication, public health methods become the main strategy for reducing the prevalence and severity of malaria.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Agyepong|first=Irene Akua|last2=Manderson|first2=Lenore|date=1999/01|title=MOSQUITO AVOIDANCE AND BED NET USE IN THE GREATER ACCRA REGION, GHANA|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-biosocial-science/article/mosquito-avoidance-and-bed-net-use-in-the-greater-accra-region-ghana/BAFF83CEC86B78FFF4E942CCC6A4ED8F|journal=Journal of Biosocial Science|language=en|volume=31|issue=1|pages=79–92|issn=1469-7599|pmid=10081239}}&lt;/ref&gt; These methods include reducing breeding sites, screening doors and windows, insecticide sprays, prompt treatment following infection, and usage of insecticide treated mosquito nets.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Distribution and sale of insecticide-treated mosquito nets is a common, cost-effective anti-malaria public health intervention; however, barriers to use exist including cost, hosehold and family organization, access to resources, and social and behavioral determinants which have not only been shown to affect malaria prevalence rates but also mosquito net use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dhsprogram.com/pubs/pdf/fr307/fr307.pdf|title=Ghana Demographic and Health Survey 2014|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

{{Fantasy}}
{{Speculative fiction|cTopic=Fantasy fiction}}

A '''quest''' is a journey toward a specific mission or a goal. The word serves as a [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] device in [[mythology]] and [[fiction]]: a difficult [[Travel|journey]] towards a goal, often [[symbol]]ic or [[Allegory|allegorical]].  Tales of quests figure prominently in the [[folklore]] of every nation&lt;ref&gt;Josepha Sherman, ''Once upon a Galaxy'' p 142 {{ISBN|0-87483-387-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ethnic nationalism|ethnic culture]].  In [[literature]], the object of a quest requires great exertion on the part of the [[hero]], who must overcome many obstacles, typically including much travel.  The aspect of travel allows the storyteller to showcase exotic locations and cultures (an objective of the narrative, not of the character).&lt;ref&gt;Michael O. Riley, Oz and Beyond: The Fantasy World of L. Frank Baum, p 178-9, {{ISBN|0-7006-0832-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The object of a quest may also have [[supernatural]] properties, often leading the protagonist into other worlds and dimensions. The [[moral]] of a quest tale often centers on the changed [[Moral character|character]] of the hero.

==Quest objects==

[[Image:TheKnightAtTheCrossroads.jpg|left|thumb|''A Knight at the Crossroads'' by [[Viktor Vasnetsov]]]]

The hero normally aims to obtain something or someone by the quest, and with this object to return home.&lt;ref&gt;
[[W. H. Auden]], "The Quest Hero", ''Understanding the Lord of the Rings: The Best of Tolkien Criticism'', p35 {{ISBN|0-618-42253-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The object can be something new, that fulfills a lack in his life, or something that was stolen away from him or someone with authority to dispatch him.&lt;ref&gt;[[Vladimir Propp]], ''Morphology of the Folk Tale, p 36, {{ISBN|0-292-78376-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes the hero has no desire to return; Sir [[Galahad]]'s quest for the [[Holy Grail]] is to find it, not return with it. A return may, indeed, be impossible: [[Aeneas]] quests for a homeland, having lost Troy at the beginning of [[Virgil]]'s ''Aeneid,'' and he does not return to Troy to re-found it but settles in Italy (to become an ancestor of the Romans).

If the hero does return after the culmination of the quest, he may face [[false hero]]es who attempt to pass themselves off as him,&lt;ref&gt;[[Vladimir Propp]], ''Morphology of the Folk Tale'', p60, {{ISBN|0-292-78376-0}}
&lt;/ref&gt; or his initial response may be a rejection of that return, as [[Joseph Campbell]] describes in his critical analysis of quest literature, ''[[The Hero With a Thousand Faces]]''.

If someone dispatches the hero on a quest, the overt reason may be false, with the dispatcher actually sending him on the difficult quest in hopes of his death in the attempt, or in order to remove him from the scene for a time, just as if the claim were sincere, except that the tale usually ends with the dispatcher being unmasked and punished.&lt;ref&gt;[[Vladimir Propp]], ''Morphology of the Folk Tale'', p77 {{ISBN|0-292-78376-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stories with such false quest-objects include the legends of [[Jason]] and [[Perseus]], the fairy tales ''[[The Dancing Water, the Singing Apple, and the Speaking Bird]]'', ''[[Go I Know Not Whither and Fetch I Know Not What]]'', and the story of [[Beren and Lúthien]] in [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Silmarillion|Silmarillion]]''.

The quest object may, indeed, function only as a convenient reason for the hero's journey. Such objects are termed [[MacGuffin]]s. When a hero is on a quest for several objects that are only a convenient reason for his journey, they are termed plot coupons.

==Literary analysis==
The quest, in the form of the [[Monomyth#The Hero's Journey|Hero's Journey]], plays a central role in the [[Monomyth]] described by [[Joseph Campbell]]; the hero sets forth from the world of common day into a land of adventures, tests, and magical rewards.  Most times in a quest, the knight in shining armor wins the heart of a beautiful maiden/ princess.

==Historical examples==
An early quest story tells the tale of [[Gilgamesh]], who seeks a secret to eternal life after the death of [[Enkidu]], including the search for an [[emerald]].

Another ancient quest tale, [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'', tells of [[Odysseus]], whom the gods have cursed to wander and suffer for many years before [[Athena]] persuades the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympians]] to allow him to return home.  Recovering the [[Golden Fleece]] is the object of the travels of [[Jason]] and the [[Argonauts]] in the ''[[Argonautica]]''. [[Cupid and Psyche|Psyche]], having lost Cupid, hunted through the world for him, and was set tasks by [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], including a descent into the [[underworld]].

Many [[fairy tale]]s depict the hero or heroine setting out on a quest, such as:

* ''[[East of the Sun and West of the Moon]]'' where the heroine seeks her husband
* ''[[The Seven Ravens]]'' where the heroine seeks her transformed brothers
* ''[[The Story of the Youth Who Went Forth to Learn What Fear Was]]''
* ''[[The Golden Bird]]'' where the prince sets out to find the golden bird for his father

Other characters may set out with no more definite aim than to "seek their fortune", or even be cast out instead of voluntarily leaving, but learn of something that could aid them along the way and so have their journey transformed from aimless wandering into a quest.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Tatar, ''The Hard Facts of the Grimms' Fairy Tales'', p63, {{ISBN|0-691-06722-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other characters can also set forth on quests — the hero's older brothers commonly do — but the hero is distinguished by his success.

[[Image:Galahad grail.jpg|left|360px|thumb|"Vision of the Holy Grail" (1890) by [[William Morris]]]]

Many medieval [[Romance (heroic literature)|romances]] sent knights out on quests. The term "[[Knight-errant]]" sprang from this, as ''errant'' meant "roving" or "wandering".  Sir [[Thomas Malory]] included many in ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]''.  The most famous—perhaps in all of western literature—centers on the [[Holy Grail]] in [[Arthurian legend]].  This [[monomyth|story cycle]] recounts multiple quests, in multiple variants, telling stories both of the heroes who succeed, like [[Percival]] (in [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]]'s [[Parzival]]) or Sir [[Galahad]] (in the [[Queste del Saint Graal]]), and also the heroes who fail, like Sir [[Lancelot]].  This often sent them into a bewildering [[enchanted forest|forest]].  Despite many references to its pathlessness, the forest repeatedly confronts knights with forks and crossroads, of a labyrinthine complexity.&lt;ref&gt;Penelope Reed Doob, ''The Idea of the Labyrinth: from Classical Antiquity through the Middle Ages'', p 177, {{ISBN|0-8014-8000-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The significance of their encounters is often explained to the knights—particularly those searching for the [[Holy Grail]]—by [[hermit]]s acting as [[wise old man|wise old men -- or women]].&lt;ref&gt;Penelope Reed Doob, ''The Idea of the Labyrinth: from Classical Antiquity through the Middle Ages'', p 179-81, {{ISBN|0-8014-8000-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Still, despite their perils and chances of error, such forests, being the location where the knight can obtain the end of his quest, are places where the knights may become worthy; one romance has a maiden urging Sir Lancelot on his quest for the Holy Grail, "which quickens with life and greenness like the forest."&lt;ref&gt;Penelope Reed Doob, ''The Idea of the Labyrinth: from Classical Antiquity through the Middle Ages'', p 181, {{ISBN|0-8014-8000-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

So consistently did knights quest that [[Miguel de Cervantes]] set his [[Don Quixote]] on mock quests in a parody of chivalric tales. Nevertheless, while Don Quixote was a fool, he was and remains a hero of chivalry.

==Modern literature==
Quests continued in modern literature.  Analysis can interpret many (perhaps most) stories as a quest in which the main character is seeking something that he desires,&lt;ref&gt;Robert McKee, ''Story:  Substance, Structure, Style, and the Principles of Screenwriting'', p 196-7 {{ISBN|0-06-039168-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the literal structure of a journey seeking something is, itself, still common.  Quests often appear in [[fantasy]] literature,&lt;ref&gt;John Grant and John Clute, ''The Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', "Quest ", p 796 {{ISBN|0-312-19869-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; as in [[Rasselas]] by [[Samuel Johnson]], or ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'', where Dorothy, the Scarecrow, the Tin Woodman, and the Cowardly Lion go on a quest for the way back to Kansas, brains, a heart, and courage respectively.&lt;ref&gt;L. Frank Baum, Michael Patrick Hearn, ''The Annotated Wizard of Oz'', p 126-7, {{ISBN|0-517-50086-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quests, also, play a major role in [[Rick Riordan]]'s fantasy books, among them ''[[Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians]]'', ''[[The Heroes of Olympus]]'', and ''[[The Kane Chronicles]]''.

A familiar modern literary quest is [[Frodo Baggins]]'s quest to destroy the [[One Ring]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[W. H. Auden]], "The Quest Hero", ''Understanding the Lord of the Rings:  The Best of Tolkien Criticism'', p45 {{ISBN|0-618-42253-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The One Ring, its baleful power, the difficult method which is the only way to destroy it, and the spiritual and psychological torture it wreaks on its Bearer; [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] uses all these elements to tell a meaningful tale of [[friendship]] and the inner struggle with [[temptation]], against a background of [[epic poetry|epic]] and supernatural warfare.

''[[The Catcher in the Rye]]'' is often thought of as a quest plot, detailing Holden's search not for a tangible object but for a sense of purpose or reason.

Some writers, however, may devise arbitrary quests for items without any importance beyond being the object of the quest.  These items are known as [[MacGuffin]]s, which is sometimes merely used to compare quests and is not always a derogatory term.  Writers may also motivate characters to pursue these objects by meanings of a [[Self-fulfilling prophecy#Literature, media, and the arts|prophecy]] that decrees it, rather than have them discover that it could assist them, for reasons that are given.

'''Service-oriented communications (SOC)''' technologies are designed to be easily used in the context of [[Service-orientation|service-oriented]] architectures. These technologies are generally software based and are built more like a business application than a traditional PBX business [[communications system]]. Service-oriented communications systems allow their services to participate in [[business process]]es. They make their services available to other business applications within and SOA and allow for reuse of the services.
The goal of service-oriented communications is to enable business environments to build communications into their business processes, enabling more streamlined collaboration among people within the business. It typically assumes that certain services are provided in the context of an SOA service provider. This is often in the form of a suite of [[web service]]s, but may also be attached to other means of sharing the services such as an enterprise system bus (ESB).

The communications part of SOC
Enterprise communications have traditionally been provided by closed, stand-alone PBX systems. Installed in a separate phone room or wiring closet, operated over a different wiring infrastructure, known only by the telecom manager, these systems ran independently from every other aspect of the business.

Today’s business-savvy [[chief information officer]]s (CIOs) are exploring ways in which [[information technology]] can be better leveraged to improve the efficiency and productivity of the enterprise. In practice, CIOs are embracing the concepts of [[service-oriented architecture]]s and rethinking how the different business systems in use within the enterprise can be designed to allow each system to leverage the benefits of any other system.
The maturing of web service technology has provided a real framework for allowing one system to leverage the services of another according to the principles of a service-oriented architecture. Complex business systems can now work together to deliver solutions in highly customized ways to end users. Increasingly, applications are adapting to the specific needs of users rather than users being forced to adapt to the available functionality of applications.

== Web service technology ==

As the Internet grew from a forum for sharing information to a marketplace for doing business, a technology matured that allowed computers to transact with each other more easily. Out of these Internet roots, web service technology was born.

The general goal of web services is to construct elements of [[business logic]], services, which can be very easily used by other applications. The services themselves hide the complexity of their business logic from the consumers through simple interfaces that allow the services to be reused in many different applications. The service and the consumer are described as being [[Loose coupling|loosely coupled]], an approach that allows complex composite solutions to be developed through leveraging multiple web services.

There are a number of key elements to web service technology…

* XML ([[Extensible Markup Language|eXtensible Markup Language]]) is the core language of web service technology. It provides a platform neutral way to describe the data associated with any service transaction.
* SOAP ([[SOAP|Simple Object Access Protocol]]) is the preferred means by which an application invokes a web service. The protocol itself is written in XML.
* WSDL (Web Service Definition Language) is the specification of the interface that a web service exposes to consumers. It describes the set of operations that the service makes available. The WSDL is also written in XML.
Advantages of web services
* Loosely coupled—the high degree of abstraction that exists between the implementation and the consumption of the service frees the web service client and the web service provider from needing any knowledge of each other beyond inputs and outputs
* Platform neutral—web services can be provided by or invoked on most, if not all, platforms today, even legacy platforms
* Development language neutral—people are developing web services using C/C++, C#, Java, [[Visual Basic]], Python and others
* Standards are architecture neutral—these do not enforce [[client–server]], [[peer-to-peer]] or any other model, although practical implementation issues currently drive developers to client–server
* Web services leverage existing standards—standards that are already in place for conventional [[web server]] applications, including HTTP, secure sockets and authentication
* Relatively lightweight—so they can be easily deployed to small devices for example PDAs and [[Smartphone|SmartPhones]].

'''Slice of life''' describes the depiction of mundane experiences in art and entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Slice of Life|work=The New Oxford American Dictionary|edition=First |authors=Jewell, Elizabeth J. &amp; Abate, Frank R. (editors)|date=September 2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn= 0-19-511227-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In theater it refers to [[Naturalism (theatre)|naturalism]], while in literary parlance it is a narrative technique in which a seemingly arbitrary sequence of events in a character's life is presented, often lacking plot development, conflict and exposition, and often having an open ending.

==Film and theater ==
In theatrical parlance, the term ''slice of life'' refers to a [[Naturalism (theatre)|naturalistic]] representation of [[real life]], sometimes used as an adjective, as in "a [[Play (theatre)|play]] with 'slice of life' dialogue".  The term originated between 1890 and 1895 as a [[calque]] from the [[List of French words and phrases used by English speakers|French phrase]] ''tranche de vie'', credited to the [[List of French playwrights|French]] [[playwright]] Jean Jullien (1854–1919).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Slice of life|work=Random House Unabridged Dictionary|date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jullien introduced the term not long after a staging of his play ''The Serenade'', as noted by Wayne S. Turney in his [[essay]] "Notes on Naturalism in the Theatre":
&lt;blockquote&gt;''The Serenade'' was introduced by the [[Théâtre Libre]] in 1887. It is a prime example of ''rosserie'', that is, plays dealing with corrupt, [[morally bankrupt]] characters who seem to be respectable, "smiling, smiling, damned villains..." Jullien gave us the famous apothegm defining naturalism in his ''The Living Theatre'' (1892): "A play is a slice of life put onstage with art." He goes on to say that "...our purpose is not to create laughter, but thought." He felt that the story of a play does not end with the curtain which is, he says, "only an arbitrary interruption of the action which leaves the spectator free to speculate about what goes on beyond your expectation..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wayneturney.20m.com/naturalism.htm|author=Turney, Wayne S.|title=Notes on Naturalism in the Theatre|website=wayneturney.20m.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514174112/http://www.wayneturney.20m.com/naturalism.htm|archivedate=2008-05-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During the 1950s, the phrase was commonly used in critical reviews of live television dramas, notably [[teleplay]]s by [[JP&amp;nbsp;Miller]], [[Paddy Chayefsky]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=g3uY59k0XNUC&amp;pg=PA171&amp;lpg=PA171&amp;dq=chayefsky+%22slice+of+life%22&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=11&amp;ct=result Gottfried, Martin. ''All His Jazz'', Da Capo, 2003.]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Reginald Rose]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/R/htmlR/rosereginal/rosereginal.htm Dowler, Kevin. "Reginald Rose". Museum of Broadcast Communications.]&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, it was sometimes used [[synonym]]ously with the pejorative term ''[[kitchen sink realism]]'' adopted from British films and theatre.

==Literature==
In literary parlance, the term "slice of life" refers to a [[narrative|storytelling]] technique that presents a seemingly arbitrary sample of a [[Character (arts)|character's]] life, which often lacks a coherent [[Plot (narrative)|plot]], [[Conflict (narrative)|conflict]], or ending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stuart Eddy Baker|publisher=University Press of Florida|year=2002|pages=83–84|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PaEvtL-dX3kC&amp;pg=PA83|title=Bernard Shaw's remarkable religion: a faith that fits the facts}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story may have little [[plot (narrative)|plot]] progress and often has no [[Exposition (literary technique)|exposition]], conflict, or [[dénouement]], but rather has an open ending.

In the United States, slice-of-life stories were particularly given emphasis by the Chicago school at the end of the 19th century, a period when the novel and social sciences became different systems of discourse.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The SAGE Handbook of Qualitative Research|last=Denzin|first=Norman|last2=Lincoln|first2=Yvonna|publisher=SAGE|year=2005|isbn=0761927573|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; These produced literary texts by researcher-authors that were written to represent the subject's stories and sentiment-free social realism using the language of ordinary people.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It formed part of the late 19th- and early 20th-century naturalism in literature, which was inspired by the adaptation of principles and methods of social sciences such as the Darwinian view of nature.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=American Literature from the 1850s to 1945|last=Augustyn|first=Adam|publisher=Britannica Educational Publishing|year=2010|isbn=9781615302345|location=New York|pages=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement was an extension of realism, presenting the faithful representation of reality without moral judgment.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Robin E. Brenner's 2007 book "Understanding manga and anime" holds that in [[anime]] and [[manga]], "slice of life" is a genre that is more akin to [[melodrama]] than [[drama]], bordering on absurd due to the large numbers of dramatic and comedic events in very short spans. This genre claims a large section of the Japanese manga market and usually focuses on school, which is the most dominant force in young people's lives, including their [[Interpersonal relationship|interpersonal relationships]] both in and out of their families.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Understanding Manga and Anime|last=Brenner|first=Robin|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2007|isbn=9781591583325|location=Westport, CT|pages=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; Themes usually range from [[teen]] coming-of-age, interpersonal relationships, family, romance, to fantasy and science fiction.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; A common trait in slice of life anime and manga is their emphasis on seasonality or procedures.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} Settings of the narratives would often include cafes and restaurants and also introduce specific trends or groups, which are often coming from society's outsiders.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

StrategEast is a Washington-based think and do tank. 
StrategEast work is focused on the 14 countries, which proclaimed or restored their independence after the collapse of the [[USSR]]: [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://haqqin.az/news/124899 | title=Американцы объявили Азербайджан прагматиком - не наш рейтинг}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Belarus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.interfax.by/news/belarus/1238928 | title=Беларусь заняла 11 место в индексе вестернизации постсоветских стран, попав в группу "балансирующих прагматиков"}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Estonia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://rezonans.kz/vse-o-politike/4247-rejting-samye-prozapadnye-strany-tsentralnoj-azii | title=Рейтинг: самые прозападные страны Центральной Азии}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Moldova]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://omg.md/index.php?newsid=14439 | title=Молдова является "декларативно про-западной" в Индексе Вестернизации постсоветских стран}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tajikistan]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Ukraine]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://strana.ua/news/129880-ukrainu-priznali-deklarativno-prozapadnoj-v-rejtinhe-vesternizatsii-postsovetskikh-stran.html | title=Украину назвали "декларативно прозападной" в Индексе вестернизации постсоветских стран}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Uzbekistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://m.baltictimes.com/article/jcms/id/140819/ | title=Article}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methodology ==

The center analyzed the development of 14 countries of the post-Soviet non-Russian region (PSNR) in five categories. It considered political, economic, legal, language, and cultural westernization as well as the westernization of the country's lifestyles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://news.err.ee/827648/report-estonia-most-westernized-country-among-former-soviet-republics#comment | title=Report: Estonia most westernized country among former Soviet republics| date=2018-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to the center, it decided to not study Russia for this analysis because it wants to focus on smaller countries who have received less attention than Russia in similar international studies.
The third President of Poland, [[Aleksander Kwaśniewski]], in his foreword to the Westernization Index says:
“…The study deeply analyzes the factors that contribute to the development of countries in the transition period, and gives the West recipes - how to most effectively support institutions that steadily serve the interests of the inhabitants of the region."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ru.focus.vesti.lv/news/novyi-indeks-vesternizacii-postsovetskih-stran-latvija-na-tretjem-meste?19673 | title=Новый "Индекс Вестернизации постсоветских стран": Латвия на третьем месте}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11349">The '''“System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe”''' (SIGLE) was established in 1980, two years after a seminar on grey literature organised by the [[European Commission]] in York (UK). Operated by a network of national information or document supply centres active in collecting and promoting grey literature, SIGLE was an on line, pan-European electronic [[bibliographic database]] and [[document delivery]] system.

The objective was to provide access to European [[grey literature]] and to improve bibliographic coverage.

From 1980 to 1985, SIGLE was funded by the Commission of the European Communities (CEC). When CEC financial support ended in 1985, the national centres formed a network for the acquisition, identification and dissemination of grey literature called “[[European Association for Grey Literature Exploitation]]” or EAGLE, who became the producer of the SIGLE database.

Input to the database ended in 2005 when the EAGLE General Assembly decided the liquidation of the network.

In 2007, together with the last EAGLE operating agent, [[FIZ Karlsruhe]], the French STI centre [[INIST]]-[[CNRS]] integrated the SIGLE records into a new open access database called [[OpenSIGLE]] hosted by INIST-CNRS.

== SIGLE characteristics ==

For each SIGLE member country, one or two national structures assumed the acquisition, referencing and document delivery of grey literature, mostly national libraries (UK, Luxembourg) or documentation centres of national research organizations (Italy, France, Germany). Merging of the national files was done by an independent operating agent under contract and the database was hosted on up to three different servers. A CD-ROM was produced from 1992 on by Silverplatter/[[Ovid Technologies]].

Cataloguing rules and classification scheme were adopted from the [[International Nuclear Information System]] (INIS) database produced by the IAEA ([[International Atomic Energy Agency]]). The SIGLE classification was derived from the American COSATI scheme. One important difference to INIS was that SIGLE never included serials (only collections of monographs) and never provided records on an analytical level (book or report chapters, communications from conference proceedings etc.).

Each SIGLE record contained informative titles in English and/or in the original language, the author’s name, academic degree, and the research organization or educational institution, the document’s date of publication and type, number of pages, report numbers, and language, as well as subject classifications. Many records include keywords and abstracts.

Each national structure sent records in its own language. A search through the entire database was made possible through providing an English translation of the title or English keywords. One of these fields was mandatory. This constraint may seem irrelevant but for some countries it was a considerable barrier to increased input.

One of the goals of SIGLE from the beginning was to facilitate access to grey documents in Europe. Therefore:
*Each record contained a clear mention of availability (with or without shelf number).
*Each member country committed to supply the referenced document on demand, whether from its own collections or through interlending service by back-up libraries.
*Useful information on document supply (addresses, conditions) was given on specific help pages or in user-guides.

'''Abstract ''' 
          
The main goals of co-fermentation are sewage sludge stabilisation, production of a cyclable product and minimisation of process emissions. This research project focused on anaerobic wet fermentation. Criteria of evaluation were the quantity and quality of the resulting fermented sludge, biogas, and process water. In view of the scarcity of data on optimum process conditions, the investigations were to provide information, e.g.: Optimum ratio of biological waste to sewage sludge, influence of process conditions (temperature, charge volume, flow rate) on biogas production and process water burden.

== SIGLE content ==

SIGLE was started in 1980, but since some members put in older documents, the earliest publications go back to the sixties.
Pure and applied sciences were the first subjects to be covered, with economics, social sciences and humanities added in 1984. Although SIGLE was a multidisciplinary database, about one third of the records were found in the humanities and social sciences (&gt;35%), followed by medical and life sciences (12%) and physics (9%). These figures were related to different practices of research communities to publish white only or grey, but also to the willingness of organizations to cooperate. Some of the documents existed only in three copies and it was not always easy for the SIGLE centre to obtain one of them.

Among the document types one finds a majority of reports, followed by doctoral theses or dissertations. In several countries monthly files were obtained by conversion from other catalogues, without a clear identification of the document type, so that the "miscellaneous" category is a "hold all" for these cases.

Over the years the content of the database improved. For instance, since 1997 English abstracts were added, in particular to Russian records. Members provided English keywords with increasing frequency. Even so, another important project was never realized: the integration of electronic documents, if possible with a link to the full text. Instead members started to build institutional repositories or to provide access to electronic grey literature by other means.

In October 1993 the SIGLE database contained 336,650 records, with around 40,000 new records being added each year. In September 1999, SIGLE contained more than 630,000 records with a current annual input of 60,000 records. The database was updated monthly.

Between 2015 and 2020, the foundation's publishing arm, ISF Publishing, plans to republish the complete corpus of Idries Shah in English. This includes print, [[E-book|eBook]], and [[Audiobook|audio]] editions and, for the first time, American editions as well. The foundation is also working on releasing translations of Shah's publications in Oriental languages (including [[Arabic]], [[Dari language|Dari]], [[Pashto]], [[Urdu]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]]). Translations into other Oriental and European languages are also underfoot. In addition, the foundation is committed to establishing an online archive of Idries Shah's manuscripts and associated material, as well as making Shah's publications available to libraries, schools and universities, in both East and West.&lt;ref name="TISF-ISF-Publishing" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TISF-1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AsianAffairsTwigger" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ISHK-News-and-Plans-for-2014"&gt;{{cite web

Part of a wider initiative, The Idries Shah Foundation had begun to make available new paperback, ebook and audiobook editions of Shah's 35 or so main titles in English, along with translations into other Western and Eastern languages.&lt;ref name="TISF-1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AsianAffairsTwigger" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ISHK-News-and-Plans-for-2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="note-ew" /&gt; In addition, as Idries Shah's books are re-published, they are being made available to read online – via the foundation's web site and also [[Google Books]] – free of charge.&lt;ref name="TISF-Read-Online-Free" /&gt;

In 2014, The Idries Shah Foundation in partnership with [[Books With Wings]] also freely distributed 32,000 books by Idries Shah, together with related Eastern classics, to schools, universities and public libraries in Afghanistan.&lt;ref name="TISF-32000-books"&gt;{{cite web

== Reception ==

=== Fiftieth anniversary of ''The Sufis'' (1964–2014) ===
In an article on the [[Al Jazeera]] web site in 2014, to coincide with the fiftieth anniversary of the first publication of ''The Sufis'', John Bell and John Zada write about the wave of intolerant militance and extremism in the East and in Africa and about the destruction of many cultural resources such as libraries and [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage]] shrines and mosques in places like [[Timbuktu]].&lt;ref name="AlJazeera50" /&gt;

Explaining the historical, rich and diverse background of the tolerant Sufi tradition, the authors suggest that the material in Shah's newly republished book ''The Sufis'' provides a useful and most-timely counterpoint and antidote to such extremism in the East; to consumerism in the West; and to intolerance, dogmatism and closed thinking, which they and Shah see as material, mental and emotional “prisons”.&lt;ref name="AlJazeera50" /&gt;

In a related article in ''[[The Guardian]]'', author [[Jason Webster (author)|Jason Webster]] is also of the opinion that the Sufi Way, as it is known, is a natural antidote to fanaticism.&lt;ref name="Sufism-Guardian-Webster" /&gt;

Webster states that classical [[Islam]]ic Sufis include (amongst many others) the poet and [[Persian people|Persian]] [[polymath]] [[Omar Khayyám]], the [[Andalusia]]n polymath [[Averroes|Avërroes]], the Persian poet and [[Hagiography|hagiographer]] [[Attar of Nishapur|Fariduddin Attar]], and the Persian poet and theologian [[Rumi|Jalāl ad-Dīn Rumi]].&lt;ref name="Sufism-Guardian-Webster" /&gt;  The writer also notes that when ''The Sufis'' first appeared, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' declared the book “a seminal book of the century”, and that the work attracted writers such as [[Doris Lessing]], [[J. D. Salinger]] and [[Geoffrey Grigson]]. The poet [[Ted Hughes]] also described it as “astonishing” and wrote that “The Sufis must be the biggest society of sensible men on Earth.” According to the reviewer, others in the West drawn to or influenced by Sufism include [[St Francis of Assisi]], the novelist, poet and playwright [[Miguel de Cervantes]], the poet and diplomat [[Sir Richard Burton]], the leading British politician [[Winston Churchill]], and the diplomat and economist [[Dag Hammarskjöld]].&lt;ref name="Sufism-Guardian-Webster" /&gt;

Stressing the importance of the Foundation's undertaking, Webster writes that “Half a century on, the foundation’s mission to promote Shah’s ideas in the Middle East fits with the ancient Sufi concern of passing knowledge between different cultures, particularly at times of greatest need. To a certain degree, the classics – what Shah drew on to bring Sufism to the west – are being overlooked by younger generations.”&lt;ref name="Sufism-Guardian-Webster" /&gt;

In another related article on the ''[[Asian Affairs]]'' journal weblog, author [[Robert Twigger]] writes of it being fifty years since the original publication of ''The Sufis''. He notes that the introduction by popular poet, novelist, critic and classicist, [[Robert Graves]] helped get the book noticed, and Shah had the support of American psychologist [[Robert Ornstein]] and award-winning author [[Doris Lessing]]. More recently, historian [[William Dalrymple (historian)|William Dalrymple]] has also expressed his debt to Shah's works, as has ''[[The Guardian]]'' columnist and author [[Oliver Burkeman]].&lt;ref name="AsianAffairsTwigger" /&gt;

Twigger writes that though Shah died in 1996, The Idries Shah Foundation carries the work on. He is of the opinion that “ironically, the original material Shah brought from the [[Orient]]al world has been persecuted to extinction in many regions of the East,” and adds that “the shock troops of [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]] will one day depart and folk will need re-introducing to their cultural inheritance.”&lt;ref name="AsianAffairsTwigger" /&gt;

The opera is in two acts and is scored for two [[baritone]]s, [[bass (voice type)|bass]], [[mezzo-soprano]], four [[soprano]]s, [[tenor]], mixed chorus, children's voices and chamber orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/23/arts/music/23glas.html?ex=1188532800&amp;en=d86cffe29650f231&amp;ei=5070 | work=The New York Times | first=Allan | last=Kozinn | title=When a Bird Sings an Aria, You'd Be Wise to Duck | date=2007-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each composer wrote alternating scenes and utilized each other's themes to provide structural unity. Glass retained ownership of the opera, and did not allow for the "live" recording of the premiere (with [[Jayne West]] and [[Sanford Sylvan]]) to be released until 2009. Until then, Moran encouraged his fans to distribute bootleg copies so that people could hear it.

==Performance history==
It was premiered on December 11, 1985, at the [[American Repertory Theater]] in Cambridge, Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=JOHN ROCKWELL, Special to the New York Times |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9401E1D9143BF936A25751C1A963948260 |title=Opera - Glass-Moran 'Juniperi Tree,' In Cambridge - Nytimes.Com |publisher=New York Times |date=1985-12-15 |accessdate=2013-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For its 25th anniversary of creation, the {{ill|Théâtre des Petites Garnottes|fr}} presented the Canadian premiere of the opera in September, 2010 at the Salle Jean-Paul Tardif in [[Quebec, Canada]].

==Synopsis==

The Grimm fairy tale tells of a wicked stepmother who murders her stepson, fearing that he reminds her husband of his late wife and serves him up in a stew to his hungry, unsuspecting father. The boy's sister buries her brother's bones under a [[juniper]] tree where their mother is buried, and the child's spirit returns as a singing bird who wreaks vengeance on the evil stepmother (dropping a millstone on her) before being restored to life in the bosom of his family.&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.macconnect.com/users/r/rbtmoran/juniper_tree.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070705032030/http://members.macconnect.com/users/r/rbtmoran/juniper_tree.htm |date=July 5, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The N Word: One Man's Stand''''' is an autobiography of the author, [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] activist [[Stephen Hagan]], and it is also an account of his fight to have the word "[[Nigger]]" removed from a sign at the [[Toowoomba]] sports oval,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swf.org.au/component/option,com_2005/task,view_detail/agid,159/year,/month,/day,/Itemid,81/l|title=The N Word}}, 2005 [[Sydney Writers' Festival]] Program&lt;/ref&gt; with an apparent pun with the word "stand".

"The E. S. 'Nigger' Brown Stand" was so named in 1960 to honour the [[rugby league]] player [[Edwin Stanley Brown]] (1898–1972) as a distinguished local sportsman. The government at the time, the Howard Government, would reject decision by the [[United Nations]] [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination|Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination]] in ''Hagan v Australia'' to remove the sign. The book has also gives an account of Hagan's own conflicts with Aboriginal powerbrokers, initially over his resistance to nepotism and lack of accountability and later in relation to the "Nigger" sign. He gives his account of an irregularly called "community meeting", the assistance he provided to Aboriginal people and groups that were not assisted by the publicly funded Aboriginal bodies. Also included is an account of his clash with the [[Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission]]'s deputy chair [[Ray Robinson (ATSIC Deputy Chairperson)|Sugar Ray Robinson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/ILB/2005/66.html|title=''Indigenous Law Bulletin'' – Book Review – ''The N Word: One Man's Stand'' by Ernst Willheim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''''To Your Eternity'''''|不滅のあなたへ|Fumetsu no anata he|{{abbr|lit.|literally}} "To You, the Immortal"|lead=yes}} is a Japanese [[manga]] series written and illustrated by Yoshitoki Ōima. It has been serialized in ''[[Weekly Shōnen Magazine]]'' since November 9, 2016, with the individual chapters collected and published by [[Kodansha]] into seven ''[[tankōbon]]'' volumes {{as of|2018|May|lc=yes}}. The story follows an immortal being whose purpose is to gain knowledge of the world. As the story progresses, this being takes the form of an abandoned boy and his wolf. The series has been licensed by [[Kodansha USA]] for a digital and printed English release.

==Plot==
It, a mysterious immortal being, is sent to the Earth with no emotions nor identity. However, It is able to take the shape of those around that have a strong impetus. At first, It is a sphere. Then, It imitates the form of a rock. As the temperature drops and snow falls atop the moss, It inherits the moss. When an injured, lone wolf comes limping by and lays down to die, It takes on the form of the animal. Finally, It gains consciousness and begins to traverse the empty tundra until It meets a boy. The boy lives alone in a ghost town, which the adults abandoned long ago in search of the paradise said to exist far beyond the endless sea of white tundra. However, their efforts were for naught, and now the boy is in a critical state. Acquiring the form of the boy, It sets off on a never-ending journey, in search of new experiences, places, and people.

After dying multiple deaths, he is found in a swamp by March, a young girl aspiring to be a caring mother, chosen to be a sacrifice to appease what they believe to be a rampaging bear spirit. She names the boy "Fushi", and befriends him, teaching him how to eat and become less feral.

The '''Union Mondiale des Écrivains Médécins''' (UMEM) is a literary organization that brings [[Medical writing|medical writers]] around the world.

It was established in 1955 under the name Fédération Internationale des Sociétés des Medecins Écrivains (FISEM), only using its current name in 1973 in [[Warsaw]] on the occasion of its congress held that year.

When was FISEM, only few countries ([[France]], [[Italy]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Belgium]]) entities owned national medical writers.

== Purpose ==

The UMEM aims to allow its members a better understanding among all, establishing ties of friendship and understanding among medical writers of different nationalities, fostering their literary activity and helping to disseminate their work.

'''Weddings in the United States''' follow traditions often based on religion, culture, and social norms.

==History==
[[Wedding|Weddings]] in the [[United States]] were once based out of commodity, rather than desire or love. The word "wedding" implied the security the groom's family provided to the family of the bride when the couple married.&lt;ref name=two&gt;[http://marriage.families.com/blog/the-history-of-weddings "The History of the Weddings"], 2006-09-05. Retrieved on 2009-07-25.&lt;/ref&gt; Brides were chosen based on their economic worth. This trend lasted until the 19th Century, when couples started to marry for love.&lt;ref name=history&gt;[http://www.randomhistory.com/1-50/009wedding.html "Here Comes The Bride: A History of the American Wedding"], 2008-05-08. Retrieved on 2009-07-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th Century, weddings were typically small, intimate ceremonies at the home of either the parents of the bride or the parents of the groom. The announcement of the newly married couple took place at their church on the Sunday following the wedding. In the 1820s and 1830s, weddings became more elaborate, when upper class couples had wedding ceremonies similar to modern custom. The bride usually wore the best dress she owned, so her dress was not always white, as white dresses were impractical to own. Not until the middle of the 19th century did brides start buying a dress made specifically for their wedding day.  At the same time, couples began to hire professionals to prepare floral arrangements and wedding cakes, rather than making them at home.&lt;ref name=history /&gt;

Today, couples in the United States are waiting later in life to get married.  The average age for males getting married in the United States is 27 years old, whereas, women's average age is 25.&lt;ref&gt;National Marriage Project, The State of our Unions, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural Traditions==

===Attire===

{{cquote|Something old, something new,&lt;br&gt;Something borrowed, something blue,&lt;br&gt;A silver sixpence in her shoe.}}

The saying, "Something old, something new, / Something borrowed, something blue, / A silver sixpence in her shoe," dates back to the Victorian era and requires the bride to accessorize her wedding attire in certain ways to promote good luck in her new marriage.  Many brides in the U.S. do this for fun.  The "old" is supposed to represent the past, particularly the bond between the bride and her family.  The bride might choose to wear a piece of jewelry from one of her elders, or another accessory given to her from an older relative.  The "new" represents the couple getting married and their future together.  Usually, the bride's wedding gown or wedding ring is used as a new item.  "Something borrowed" is something that is taken from the families and meant to be returned.  By borrowing something, the bride is continuing the link between herself and her family to maintain loyalty and future comfort.&lt;ref name=oklahoma&gt;{{cite journal

Easy ways for the bride to incorporate the color blue include wearing blue flowers in her hair or a blue garter.&lt;ref name=oklahoma /&gt;  The silver sixpence is meant to be tucked into the bride's shoe and is supposed to bring the new couple wealth in money and love in their new life together.&lt;ref name=gagirl /&gt;

Many brides today choose to wear white bridal dresses at their weddings.  However, brides before the 19th century just wore the best dress they owned.  It wasn't until the 1840s, when Queen Victoria popularized white bridal dresses by choosing to wear white instead of the traditional royal silver dress.&lt;ref name=marryin&gt;{{cite web

Brides often accompany their white wedding dresses with a veil.  Sometimes seen as an accessory today, the veil has a history of symbolizing a bride's modesty and innocence, namely her virginity.&lt;ref name=brideandgroom&gt;{{cite web

===Before the wedding===

Many brides have bridal showers before their wedding, during which she receives gifts from the guests.  The bridal shower is usually thrown by the bride's chosen maid of honor and is humorous in nature.&lt;ref name=US /&gt;  Although it is often seen as a fun and relaxing time for the bride, it wasn't always seen that way.  Bridal showers originated in Holland for brides who were refused dowry from their fathers.  A woman's friends would give her several gifts to allow her to have the necessary dowry to marry whatever man she chose.&lt;ref name=brideandgroom /&gt;

Many couples will make precautions so that they will not be able to see each other until their wedding ceremony.  Today, this is done merely to uphold tradition and superstition, but the idea stems from the early days when marriages were arranged.  In these cases, the bride and groom would meet each other for the first time at their own wedding.&lt;ref name=knot&gt;{{cite web

  | format = 
  | doi = 
  | accessdate = 2009-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ceremony and reception===

During the ceremony, it is customary to include [[bridesmaids]] and [[groomsmen]] in the event.  The members of the bridal party are chosen to share the happiness with the couple getting married.  Including bridesmaids in the ceremony originated as a technique of confusing evil spirits as to who the actual bride was.&lt;ref name=essortment&gt;{{cite web
  | last = 
  | first =

  | doi = 
  | accessdate = 2009-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Groomsmen originated not for protection, but many centuries ago when men had to capture women in order to marry them.  In order to steal the woman they chose to marry, men needed to pick the most capable man to help him, hence "best man".&lt;ref name=brideandgroom /&gt;

Today, "giving the bride away" has a very different meaning.  The bride's father accompanies her on her walk down the aisle to show approval of the groom.  Centuries ago, fathers actually did give their daughters away to their future husbands, since females were property of their fathers.&lt;ref name=brideandgroom /&gt;

The meaning and origin of the ceremonial kiss that traditionally concludes the ceremony has several different interpretations.  In the Roman era, a kiss was used to seal legal bonds and contracts.  A marriage, a type of lifelong contract between two people, is sealed with the ceremonial kiss.  It is also believed that this kiss allows the couples' souls to mingle together.  Today, the wedding kiss is usually just used as a form of love.&lt;ref name=plink&gt;{{cite web

[[Wedding cakes]] are widely seen as symbols of [[fertility]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brideandgroom.com/wedding-articles/wedding-traditions-2.asp "The History of Wedding Traditions."] Retrieved 2009-07-29.&lt;/ref&gt;  While now they are an enjoyable snack for the wedding guests, wedding cakes have a more serious history.  Sharing the first piece of wedding cake is still a ritual in weddings, but it originated as a way to ensure fertility for the bride in her attempts to have children.  Superstition says that a bride cannot bake her own wedding cake or taste it before the wedding, or else risk losing her husband's love.  If she keeps a piece of the cake after the wedding, she supposedly ensures that he will remain faithful.&lt;ref name=Wilson&gt;{{cite journal

A way that guests at a wedding can participate in giving the bride and groom a lucky future is by the tradition of throwing rice.  The superstition originated when guests would throw nuts and grains in the hope of bringing the couple a good [[harvest]] and many children to help with the harvest.&lt;ref name=marryin /&gt;

As a symbol of luck, the newly married woman traditionally throws her [[Flower bouquet|bouquet]] to the unmarried women at the wedding.  The one who catches the bouquet is supposedly the next to be married.&lt;ref name=essortment /&gt;

Throwing the bride's [[garter (stockings)|garter]] to the single men at the wedding is a tradition similar to the bouquet toss.  The groom must remove the garter from his new wife's leg and toss it to the single men at the wedding.  It is commonly believed that this man will be the next one to marry.&lt;ref name=wedalert&gt;{{cite web

  | format = 
  | doi = 
  | accessdate = 2009-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An older custom in England involved guests raiding the bride's chamber for stockings.  These stockings taken from her room would then be thrown at the groom.  Whoever landed their stocking on the groom's nose would be the next one to marry.&lt;ref name=knot /&gt;  Even earlier than these traditions, it was an ancient custom for the bride or groom to throw the bride's garter to the marriage witnesses to confirm that their marriage had been consummated.&lt;ref name=brideandgroom /&gt;

===After the wedding===

After the wedding reception, the newlyweds usually leave for their honeymoon, a trip to the destination of their choice.  During this trip, which lasts anywhere from a few days to a few weeks, the couple consummates their marriage.&lt;ref name=US /&gt;  The term "honeymoon" comes from ancient Germanic weddings, where the newly married couple would drink [[mead]] for thirty days after their wedding. Weddings were only held on a night where there was a full moon. They drank the honey wine for a month, thirty days, until the next full moon, hence the name "honey moon".&lt;ref name=brideandgroom /&gt;

The tradition of the groom carrying his new wife across the threshold has many different interpretations. The act today symbolizes luck and the bride giving the groom her virginity.&lt;ref name=oklahoma /&gt; Similarly in older generation, brides had to appear unwilling to give in to their new husband. The husband would pretend to force his new wife into giving in to him by carrying her over the threshold. In the days when men captured their wives and actually did force women to marry them, she was also forced over the threshold because she was unwilling.&lt;ref name=brideandgroom /&gt;

==American traditions==

Weddings in the United States are the most varied and flexible in the world.  There are not many wedding traditions that are unique to the United States because most are derived from other cultures.  Most of these customs stem from [[Europe]].  Indeed, it is considered an American tradition to follow the traditions of one's culture or religion.&lt;ref name=US&gt;[http://www.worldweddingtraditions.com/locations/north_american_traditions/united_states_traditions.html "United States Wedding Traditions"], 2004. Retrieved on 2009-07-17.&lt;/ref&gt;  That said, some wedding traditions remain as the default the U.S.

It is customary to give newlyweds gifts for their new home together at the wedding reception.  To prevent duplicate gifts and having to return gifts that are not liked, many couples "register" at department stores.  Couples pick out items they would like to receive as gifts, and their friends and family can choose to buy one of those items.&lt;ref name=US /&gt;

Additionally, although most American weddings are typically elaborate and involve extensive professional planning,&lt;ref name=US /&gt; some [[DIY]] home weddings in America (or including Americans) can be quite simple in terms of ceremony, albeit costly in terms of the [[sweat equity]] involved regarding the logistics.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.utahbrideguide.com/venues/articles/athome.asp&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apracticalwedding.com/2008/10/emma-mikes-at-home-wedding/|title=Emma &amp; Mike's At Home Wedding - A Practical Wedding|date=27 October 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doityourself.com/stry/intimate-home-weddings|title=Intimate Home Weddings - DoItYourself.com|first=Amy|last=Hicks|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious traditions==

===Jewish===

In a Jewish wedding both the bride and the groom are walked down the aisle by both of their parents, which is different from other religions.&lt;ref name=jewish&gt;[http://www.aish.com/jl/l/48969841.html "Guide to the Jewish Wedding"], 2001-06-30. Retrieved on 2009-07-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jewish couples are married under the chupah, which resembles a decorated tent like structure.  This symbolizes that the bride and groom are coming together and creating a new home.  This religious tradition comes from the Biblical wedding of Abraham and Sarah.&lt;ref name="jewish"/&gt;

The ketubah is a Jewish wedding contract.  Traditionally, the ketubah was written in Aramaic, but today many Jews use Hebrew instead.  Many couples frame their ketubah and display it in their home.  The rabbi reads this contract under the chupah after the ring exchange.&lt;ref name="jewish"/&gt;

===Hindu===
Hindu weddings have some unique traditions as well.  These range from the exchanging of garlands 
(Jaimala), which represents the acknowledgement of acceptance and respect, to the lighting of a sacred fire (Havan), which represents the commitment the couple has to each other.  Other traditions include taking seven steps together as a married couple, wearing Henna on the hands and feet, and the groom putting a dot of sindur on his bride's forehead.&lt;ref name=hindu&gt;[http://www.weddingdetails.com/lore/hindu.cfm "Hindu Traditions"], 2009. Retrieved on 2009-07-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christian===
Christian weddings have many traditions that are commonly associated with weddings in general. The most important traditions for Christian weddings are the blessing and exchange of wedding bands and the bride and groom each offering his or her own wedding vows.&lt;ref name=christian&gt;[http://www.surfindia.com/matrimonials/christian-wedding.html " Christian Wedding"], 2009. Retrieved on 2009-07-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of weddings ceremonies==

=== Traditional ===

Traditional, formal, religious weddings are the most common type of wedding in the United States. Many couples opt to marry in the church of their faith, as it is common for couples to share the same religion.  Whether the couple is [[Catholic]], [[Jewish]], [[Hindu]], or any other religion, it is common practice to get married in the church of that faith.
However, many couples today do not share the same faith.  These inter-faith couples can also have a traditional wedding ceremony.&lt;ref name=piece&gt;[http://www.pieceofcakeweddingplanning.com/weddingceremony.html "The Four Most Popular Types of Wedding Ceremony"], 2009-07-10. Retrieved on 2009-07-10.&lt;/ref&gt;  Religious officials have become increasingly cooperative with marrying couples that are not of the same faith.

It is common for traditional or formal weddings to follow certain norms.  These common practices include designer dresses, groomsmen wearing tuxedos, elaborate invitations, beautiful flowers, limousine service, and fine dining and live music at a reception that follows the ceremony.&lt;ref name=piece /&gt;
=== Destination ===
Destination weddings are becoming increasingly popular in the United States.  Destination weddings, or "wedding aways" and "weddingmoons", allow the couple to completely design their wedding ceremony to fit the location. From beach weddings to weddings in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] or [[New York City]], many Americans are choosing to marry at a location far from home.  The options for destinations are limitless.&lt;ref name=destination&gt;[http://media.wiley.com/product_data/excerpt/56/04701299/0470129956.pdf "Destination Weddings 101"]. Retrieved on 2009-07-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Destination weddings have several advantages.  From getting to spend an extended time with family, to an easy transition to a honeymoon, destination weddings are very appealing.  Additionally, while destination weddings can be very expensive, they are on average less expensive than weddings at home.&lt;ref name=destination /&gt;

=== Military ===
A couple whose bride and/or groom is a member of the [[Armed Forces]] may have a military wedding in which the bride and/or groom wears their uniform.  A military wedding is considered a formal wedding and guests should dress formally.  Often, the  guests will also be in the armed forces and will wear their uniforms as well.&lt;ref name=familyedu&gt;http://life.familyeducation.com/weddings/cultural-experiences/49073.html. "Types of Weddings", Retrieved on 2009-07-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ushers who are in the armed forces traditionally form an "arch of steel" with their swords or sabers.  However, only active duty servicemen participate, as they can only carry their sword or saber if they are [[active duty]].  The arch is usually formed at the conclusion of the ceremony, and the head usher signals the formation by yelling "center face."  After the bride and groom pass through the arch, the ushers return to their bridesmaids to exit with them.  Civilian ushers may or may not stand at the arch, a decision usually made by the bride and groom.&lt;ref name=familyedu /&gt;

=== Elopement ===
To marry by [[elopement]] means that the wedding ceremony is done in secret, usually with just witnesses. Even though eloping seems simple, the marriage's secrecy can complicate family relationships.&lt;ref name=groomgroove&gt;{{cite web

Couples in the United States choose to elope for many varying reasons. 46% of couples eloping do so [[The Romeo and Juliet Effect|because of parental opposition]] to the marriage, 20% of couples elope to avoid attention, 12% because of financial reasons, 8% due to an [[unexpected pregnancy]], and 14% for other reasons.&lt;ref name="popenoe"&gt;{{cite journal

The origin of the word is an evolution of the term [[Yippie]], which was coined by the [[Youth International Party]] in the 1960s.  "Zippie" was briefly the name of the breakaway Yippie faction that demonstrated at the 1972 [[1972_Republican_National_Convention|Republican]] and [[1972_Democratic_National_Convention|Democratic Convention]]s in [[Miami Beach]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=FrEqAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=k2YEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2989,3327051&amp;dq=dana+beal&amp;hl=en Marijuana Smoke-in Held Outside Convention Hall]. July 10, 1972.

After these events, "the Zippies evolved back into Yippies",&lt;ref&gt;[[Abbie Hoffman]], Soon to be a Major Motion Picture, page 278. Perigee Books, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; but the word ''Zippie'' remained, used by record labels, rock bands, and assorted others,&lt;ref&gt;[https://zippie.bandcamp.com/ Zippie on Bandcamp]&lt;/ref&gt; since there has never been any copyright.

In subsequent years, ''zippie''  has arisen in reference to 1990s technopeople, in contradiction to [[yuppie]]s. In the 1990s, [[Fraser Clark]] and others created a unique [[subculture]] that combined the "1990s techno hemisphere with the 1960s earth person".{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} Zippies were thus advocates of [[PLUR]], which originated on the alt.raves and alt.culture.zippies usenet groups.

[[Yippie]] (YIP) was an acronym for "''Youth International Party''", and likewise, Zippie (ZIP) was an acronym for "''[[Zeitgeist]] International Party''"--a term first coined by [[Tom Forcade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Blacklisted News: Secret Histories from Chicago, '68, to 1984 | author=New Yippie Book Collective | isbn=9780912873008 |publisher=Bleecker Publishing|date=1983}} Chapter titled "''Zeitgeist: The Ballad of Tom Forcade''"&lt;/ref&gt; This was the name given to the radical breakaway Yippie faction that demonstrated at the 1972 [[1972_Republican_National_Convention|Republican]] and [[1972_Democratic_National_Convention|Democratic Convention]]s in [[Miami Beach]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/We_are_Not_McGovernable.html?id=fb4oGwAACAAJ|title=We are Not McGovernable!: What Cronkite Didn't Tell You about the '72 Democratic Convention|author=[[Steve Conliff]]|publisher=Youth International Party|date=1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bondiviewertest.azurewebsites.net/DataView/Article/HT?issueKey=19770601&amp;articleKey=19770601053|title=INTERVIEW : Dana Beal|author=Oliver, David|publisher=High Times|date=June 1977|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Reinholz&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Zippies reached international prominence during the American 1972 [[Democratic National Convention]] and 1972 [[Republican National Convention]], held in Miami Beach, Florida, USA,&lt;ref name=Reinholz&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; when the word was silk-screened on t-shirts and worn by counter-culture activists and groups working to end the US involvement in the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, John, "Trial By Fire", article in Cyrano's Journal Magazine, p. 7 photo "https://acrobat.com/app.html#d=gl72kKbtSzCFW2CNOG-L3w"&lt;/ref&gt;

==1994==
In May 1994 [[Wired Magazine]] published an article titled "Here Come the Zippies!".&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, Jules, "[https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/2.05/zippies.html Zippies!]", ''[[Wired Magazine]]'', issue 2.05, May 1994&lt;/ref&gt; The cover of the magazine featured a kaleidoscopic image of a smiling young man with wild hair, a funny hat, and mechanical eyeglasses. Written by [[Jules Marshall]], the article announced an organized cultural response to [[Thatcherism]] in the [[British Isles]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;There's a new and rapidly spreading cultural virus ripping through the British Isles. The symptoms of those infected include attacks of optimism, strong feelings of community, and lowered stress levels. Will their gathering in August at the Grand Canyon be the Woodstock of the '90s?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The article describes zippies, according to 50-year-old Fraser Clark, as "Zen-Inspired Pronoia Professional", or "hippies with zip." The [[United Kingdom|UK]] media tried to pin various labels on the Y Generation such as "cyber-crusties", "[[Electrohippies|techno-hippies]]", and "post-ravers." [[Fraser Clark]] espoused a philosophy known as [[Pronoia (psychology)|pronoia]] and embarked on an expedition to the [[United States]]. This tour was dubbed the [[Wired (magazine)#History|Zippy Pronoia Tour to US]].  Other uses of the term are "Zen Inspired Peace Professional."
These zippies were a [[New Age]] kind of [[hippie]] who embraced Chaos Theory, [[William Blake|Blakean]] revolt, modern mysteries such as New Age [[Paganism]], [[trance music]], [[rave]] culture, [[smart drinks]], [[Free Software|free software]], technology and [[entrepreneur]]ism in an effort to bring about a better world.

A group called "The Zippies" were behind one of the first acts of [[electronic civil disobedience]] with a [[Intervasion of the UK|collective online action against the 1994 Criminal Justice Bill]].

==2004==
In his book ''[[The World is Flat]]'', [[Thomas L. Friedman]] describe zippies as a "huge cohort of Indian youth who are first to come of the age since India shifted away from socialism and dived headfirst into global trade and information revolution by turning itself into world's service center".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Friedman|first=Thomas|title=The World is Flat|year=2006|publisher=Farrar, Straus, and Giroux|location=New York|isbn=978-0374292881|pages=216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original source of the 2004 term "Zippies" comes from an Indian English-language weekly magazine called ''[[Outlook (magazine)|Outlook]]'' in an article called ''Age Of The Zippie''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=SINHA|first=SUVEEN|title=Age Of The Zippie|url=http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?222577|publisher=Outlook India|accessdate=2012-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
