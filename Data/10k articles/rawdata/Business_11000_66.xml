The '''Association of the Mediterranean Chambers of Commerce and Industry''', in abbreviated form '''ASCAME''', is an organisation of international scope, of a voluntary, non-profit making nature. It unites the Chambers of Commerce and Industry and other similar institutions of the countries of the [[Mediterranean basin]], and works on the assumption that the [[Black Sea]] is a natural extension of the [[Mediterranean Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ascame.org/c/document_library/get_file?folderId=110459&amp;name=DLFE-804.pdf ASCAME Statute] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328075847/http://www.ascame.org/c/document_library/get_file?folderId=110459&amp;name=DLFE-804.pdf |date=March 28, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

ASCAME was formed on 1 October 1982. The Constitutive General Assembly was held in Barcelona, hosted by the Barcelona Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Navigation. It is an Organization with a potential membership of 500 Chambers of Commerce, and other associated entities, from the 23 countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea.

Today, ASCAME is the most important representative of the Mediterranean private sector with over 250 Chambers of Commerce from the 23 countries of the Mediterranean basin. ASCAME is a well-consolidated entity that represents the interest of the Mediterranean Chambers of Commerce and the Private Sector, also being accredited as an economic partner of the EU and international organizations in carrying out economic cooperation projects.
ASCAME represents all North and South chambers and business regardless of their size and sector of activity.

==History==

The Association of the Mediterranean Chambers of Commerce and Industry – ASCAME – was founded on October 1, 1982, as an initiative of the Barcelona Chamber of Commerce in conjunction with its counterparts from different Mediterranean countries, and in 1994 it was transformed in an International Association, on the initiative of the Chamber of Commerce of Marseille. 
From the about ten founding member of 1982, today ASCAME brings together over two hundred Chambers of Commerce and similar institutions, from twenty-two Mediterranean countries: [[Albania]], [[Algeria]],  [[Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Cyprus]], [[Croatia]], [[Egypt]], [[France]], [[Greece]], [[Italy]], [[Jordan]], [[Lebanon]], [[Libya]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[Malta]], [[Montenegro]], [[Morocco]], [[Serbia]], [[Spain]], [[Syria]], [[Tunisia]] and [[Turkey]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://images.ca.camcom.gov.it/f/Sardegnaeconomica/n./n.32001b.pdf What is ASCAME] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328075845/http://images.ca.camcom.gov.it/f/Sardegnaeconomica/n./n.32001b.pdf |date=March 28, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

ASCAME was created with the primary goal of furthering economic cooperation throughout the Mediterranean region, showing a strategic vision of North-South cooperation and integration. This vision was confirmed by the establishment of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership in 1995 and is validated today by the Union for the Mediterranean.

The objectives that the association wants to achieve are:

• The creation of working ties between peer institutions aimed at encouraging international cooperation through joint performance of activities and/or studies.

• Assertion of the Mediterranean identity.

• Contribution to create an area of peace, tolerance, security and prosperity.

'''August Williams''', more commonly known as '''August Getty''', (born June 23, 1994) is an American fashion designer and founder of the fashion brand ''August Getty Atelier''.

== Early life and family ==
Getty is the son of [[Ariadne Getty]],&lt;ref name="glaad.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.glaad.org/about/board/ariadnegetty|title=Ariadne Getty (Los Angeles, CA) (October 2016 - Present)|date=12 October 2016|website=Glaad.org|accessdate=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; a member of the [[Getty family]], and Justin Williams. He is the grandson of [[John Paul Getty Jr.|Sir John Paul Getty, Jr.]] and the great-grandson of actress [[Ann Rork Light]] and [[J. Paul Getty|Jean Paul Getty]], the founder of [[Getty Oil]].&lt;ref name="visionaryartistrymag.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.visionaryartistrymag.com/2016/02/august-getty-the-heir-apparel/|title=August Getty: The Heir Apparel - Visionary Artistry Magazine|date=8 February 2016|website=Visionaryartistrymag.com|accessdate=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has a sister, [[Nats Getty|Natalia]]. Getty is of Italian and English heritage.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/brad-hammer/august-getty-the-next-gen_b_5909482.html|title=August Getty: The Next Generation of Fashion|first=Brad|last=Hammer|date=1 October 2014|website=Huffingtonpost.com|accessdate=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was home schooled from the age of sixteen until the end of high school.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wmagazine.com/story/august-getty-fashion-designer|title=August Start|first=Lee|last=Carter|website=Wmagazine.com|accessdate=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
As a teenager Getty was influenced by designers [[Alexander McQueen]], [[Versace]], [[Vivienne Westwood]] and [[Stella McCartney]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; He has also stated that he has a strong connection to [[Yves Saint Laurent (designer)|Yves Saint Laurent]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.out.com/out-exclusives/out100-2014/2014/11/11/out100-fashion-designer-august-getty|title=OUT100: Fashion Designer August Getty|date=11 November 2014|website=Out.com|accessdate=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 Getty premiered his 2015 Spring/Summer collection at the [[Mercedes-Benz]] fashion show in New York City during [[New York Fashion Week]]. The collection was based on childhood fantasies Getty had about European heiresses with secret lives, statues in his family's art collection, and his family's botanical gardens.&lt;ref name="visionaryartistrymag.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mbfashionweek.com/designers/august-getty|title=Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week|website=Mbfashionweek.com|accessdate=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

In November 2015 Getty collaborated with [[David LaChappelle]] for his 2016 Spring/Summer collection called ''Thread of Man''. His collection's debut was an art installation at [[Universal Studios]] instead of a traditional fashion show. The installation involved art scenes depicting a car accident, an altar to [[Our Lady of Guadalupe]], and footage of [[Fox News]] and U.S. President [[Donald Trump]] underneath a neon sign spelling out ''Hell''.&lt;ref name="visionaryartistrymag.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fashionista.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fashionista.com/2015/11/august-getty-david-lachapelle-spring-2016|title=David LaChapelle and August Getty Created a Dystopian Model Wasteland at Universal Studios|website=Fasionista.com|accessdate=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; His 2016 Autumn/Winter line was featured in ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vogue.co.uk/shows/autumn-winter-2016-ready-to-wear/august-getty|title=August Getty Autumn/Winter 2016 Ready-To-Wear show report|website=Vogue.co.uk|accessdate=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Getty's Spring 2018 collection made its debut at the [[Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts|Four Seasons Hotel]] in [[Milan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wwd.com/runway/spring-ready-to-wear-2018/milan/august-getty/review/|title=August Getty RTW Spring 2018|first=Mayte|last=Allende|date=25 September 2017|website=Wwd.com|accessdate=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12208">{{short description|International minimum standard for entry level recreational scuba diver certification}}
'''Autonomous diver''' describes the minimum requirements for basic training and certification for [[Recreational diving|recreational scuba divers]] in international standard ISO 24801-2 &lt;ref name=" ISO24801-2"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:24801:-2:ed-2:v1:en|title=Recreational diving services — Requirements for the training of recreational scuba divers — Part 2: Level 2 — Autonomous diver (ISO&amp;nbsp;24801-2) |publisher=[[International Standards Organisation|ISO]] |access-date=2015-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the equivalent European Standard EN 14153-2. Various organizations offer training that meets the requirements of the Autonomous Diver standard. A certification which corresponds to Autonomous Diver allows for independent diving with a [[Buddy diving|dive buddy]] in [[Open water diving|open water]]. Most training organizations do not recommend exceeding a depth of 18 or 20 meters at this level of certification. After completion this certification the training can be extended to a dive leader to ISO 24801-3 or an intermediate not defined by international standards.

[[File:Scuba_education_levels.svg|thumb|upright=2.2|Scuba diving education levels as used by ISO, PADI, CMAS, SSI and NAUI]]
Before initial diver training and thereafter at regular intervals, a diver should undergo a [[fitness to dive]] examination by a diving doctor. In some countries, such an examination is required by law and it is a prerequisite for any training in many diving schools. A diving certification which corresponds to Autonomous Diver and a medical certificate may be required for renting diving equipment and taking part in organised dives. In some countries (e.g. Australia) the law requires every diver to prove basic certification before unsupervised diving activity.&lt;ref name="ozzy"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.royallifesaving.com.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0013/4045/Scuba_Diving_Report_Final_2008.pdf | title=Recreational Scuba Diving &amp; Snorkelling Safety in Australia - An identification, summary and analysis of policies, legislation and standards relevant to recreational scuba diving and snorkelling | publisher=[[Divers Alert Network|DAN]] Asia, Pacific Head Office, Ashburton ''and'' Royal Life Saving Society Australia (RLSSA) | date=2008 | access-date=2014-03-04 | format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some diver training organizations offer an intermediate [[Supervised diver]] certification which corresponds to ISO 24801-1, which usually only splits the contents of the Autonomous Diver training over two courses and does not qualify the holder to take part in independent dives.

==Scope of the standard==
International standard ISO 24801-2 includes:&lt;ref name=" ISO24801-2" /&gt;
*Prerequisites for training, including age and health requirements,
*Required theoretical knowledge regarding scuba and basic diving equipment, the basic physics of diving, decompression management and dive planning, medical and psychological problems related to diving, the diving environment and the use of nitrox breathing gases,
*Required scuba skills in confined and open water,
*Practical training parameters,
*Evaluation of knowledge and practical skills.

==Training according to ISO 24801-2==
Every year around 1.7 million people are trained according to ISO 24801.&lt;ref name="Statistics"&gt;945 000 annual certification by PADI {{cite web | url=http://www.padi.com/scuba/uploadedFiles/Scuba_--Do_not_use_this_folder_at_al/About_PADI/PADI_Statistics/2012%20WW%20Statistics.pdf | title=Worldwide Corporate Statistics 2013 - Data for 2007-2012 | publisher=PADI| date=February 2013 | access-date=2013-11-01| format=PDF|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102033307/http://www.padi.com/scuba/uploadedFiles/Scuba_--Do_not_use_this_folder_at_al/About_PADI/PADI_Statistics/2012%20WW%20Statistics.pdf | archive-date=2013-11-02 }} with market share of 56%, {{cite web | url=http://www.divebuddy.com/blog/11295/2013-market-share-scuba-certification-agencies-padi-naui-ssi/ | title=2013 Market Share of Scuba Certification Agencies (PADI, NAUI, SSI) | publisher=DiveBuddy.com | date=2013-07-25 |author=Greg | access-date=2013-11-01}} gives a total of about 1.7 million.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the standardization, the dive courses of individual diving organizations differ considerably in their content, expansion and philosophy. However, the minimum requirements defined in the ISO standard guarantee that a diver can easily convert between training organizations.

The following certifications meet the requirements for Autonomous Diver:

=== CMAS * ===
[[File:CMAS-Ausbildung.svg|thumb|upright=1.8|The CMAS certification sustem]]
The [[CMAS* SCUBA Diver|CMAS&amp;nbsp;*]] (one-star) training goes beyond the requirements defined by the Autonomous Diver standard. CMAS requires the theory test before diving in open water. 6 theory lessons,&lt;ref name="CMAS1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.idiving.de/de/tauchen-diving-book/tauchen-lernen-cmas-1stern | title= Tauchen lernen| work=CMAS&amp;nbsp;* (1Stern) | publisher=Dortmund idiving.de | access-date=2014-02-24 |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; which build the basic understanding of the learner diver and, after the successful completion of a theory test, at least 6 swimming pool or confined water training sessions, and 5 open water training and assessment dives. The course includes breathhold exercises. After successfully completing the course, training can continue with specialisation courses or the CMAS&amp;nbsp;** (two star). CMAS recommends maximum depth of 20 meters for one-star divers. For divers aged between 8 and 14 years, a maximum depth of 5 meters is recommended.

The CMAS&amp;nbsp;* course can be started without prior knowledge of diving. Persons who wish to attend a CMAS&amp;nbsp;* course must be at least 14 years old, and in normal physical health and fitness.

The basic training standards of the individual CMAS member organizations may differ from the training specified by CMAS.

===NAUI Scuba Diver===
The NAUI Scuba Diver course (SD) is a basic diving certification training which corresponds to the standardized Autonomous Diver.&lt;ref name="NAUI-ISO"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.easydivers.ch/ueber_uns/zertifikat_iso_naui.pdf |title=Certificate | work=Nr. EUF - CB 2007 004 |publisher=European Underwater Federation (EUF) |access-date=2013-12-02 |language=de }}&lt;/ref&gt; The training includes 2 breath-hold and 4 scuba dives. NAUI recommends SD divers to dive to a maximum depth not exceeding 18 meters. After successful completion, the training can be continued with specialty certification or the Advanced Scuba Diver course. The NAUI SD course can be started without previous knowledge of diving. Normal physical health and fitness are required. Persons who wish to attend an SD course must be at least 15 years old. NAUI Junior Scuba Diver training can be attended at the age of 12 years.&lt;ref name="NAUI-SD"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.northernatlanticdive.com/NAUI_courses/OW-course_rev1.pdf | title=NAUI Scuba Diver (Open Water) | publisher=Northern Atlantic Dive Expeditions, Inc. and R/V Gauntlet | date=2008-03-01 | access-date=2014-02-24 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130323071139/http://www.northernatlanticdive.com/NAUI_courses/OW-course_rev1.pdf | archive-date=2013-03-23 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These children's diving courses differ only in a child-oriented mediation of the same contents.

===PADI Open Water Diver===
[[File:PADI-Ausbildungssystem.svg|thumb|upright=2.4|Overview of the PADI training system]]
The [[Professional Association of Diving Instructors|PADI]] [[Open Water Diver]] Course (OWD) is an entry level diver training programme to the ISO standards for Autonomous Diver. PADI allows OWD divers to dive to a depth of 18 meters. After successful completion, training can be continued with specialties or the Advanced Open Water Diver course.

The course consists of five theory lessons, five swimming pool dives and at least four dives in open water on scuba. They also recommend an optional snorkeling dive and / or "adventure dive". PADI follows the "dive today" concept. Therefore, after a theory lesson, the dives are usually held on the same day. The pool dives - which can also be done at calm, current-free, shallow places in open water, provide for learning the basic and emergency techniques. These include entering the water, breathing under water from the scuba regulator, using the fins, basic [[Scuba skills#Buoyancy control|buoyancy control]], clearing the mask, recovery of the demand valve and [[emergency ascent]].&lt;ref name="OWD-Exler" /&gt; In the open water dives, the same exercises are repeated in deeper water. There are also techniques for managing [[cramping]], open water [[Ascending and descending (diving)|descent and ascent]], [[buddy breathing]] and [[diver navigation]].&lt;ref name="OWD-Exler"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.exler.de/owde.htm | title=PADI Open Water Diver|access-date=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

OWD is an entry-level course. Normal physical health and fitness are required. Persons who wish to attend a PADI OWD course must be at least 15 years old, but a PADI Junior OWD course (JOWD) can be attended at the age of 10 years. These children's dive courses differ only in a child-oriented mediation of the same contents.

===SSI Open Water Diver===
[[File:SSI-education system.svg|thumb|upright=1.8|Overview of the SSI training system]]
The [[Scuba Schools International]] (SSI) Open Water Diver Course (OWD) is a basic dive certification equivalent to the standard Autonomous Diver. The training includes at least 4 open water dives, which can only be carried out after the successful completion of the theoretical training. SSI allows OWD divers to dive to a maximum depth of 18 meters.&lt;ref name="SSI-Standards"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.divessi.com/d/SSI%20Global%20Training%20Standards/2014%20Global%20Training%20Standards%20GERMAN%20(Version%20v102013).ssp | title=2014 Training &amp; Dive Center Standards | work=Scuba Schools International / v102813 | publisher=Concept Systems International GmbH | page=REC-10 | date=2013-10-28 | access-date=2014-02-25 }}{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; After successful completion, training can be continued with specialties or the Advanced Adventurer Course. The SSI OWD is an entry level course. Normal physical health and fitness are required and an SSI Medical Statement must be provided. The learner must be able to swim 180 meters without an aid. Persons who wish to attend an OWD course must be at least 15 years old. An SSI Junior OWD training can be completed at the age of 10 years. [11] These children's dive courses differ only in a child-oriented mediation of the same contents.

===Other training agencies===
In addition to the above, the following certifications comply with the Autonomous Diver standard ISO 24801-2:&lt;ref name="Certified"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://certificates.austrian-standards.at/EUF_training_systems?5 |title=EUF Certified Training Systems/Training Organisations |publisher=European Underwater Federation (EUF) |access-date=2017-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was borrowed from [[horse racing]] and was not widely used until after 1910.&lt;ref name=kludas&gt;{{cite book | last=Kludas | first=Arnold | title=Record breakers of the North Atlantic, Blue Riband Liners 1838–1952 | location=London  | publisher=Chatham  | year=2000 | isbn=1-86176-141-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fox&gt;{{cite book | last=Fox | first=Stephen | title=Transatlantic: Samuel Cunard, Isambard Brunel and the Great Atlantic Steamships | location=New York | publisher=HarperCollins| year=2003| isbn=0-06-019595-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Traditionally, the record is based on [[Velocity|average speed]] rather than passage time because ships follow different routes.&lt;ref name=gibbs&gt;{{cite book | last=Gibbs | first=Charles Robert Vernon | title=Passenger Liners of the Western Ocean: A Record of Atlantic Steam and Motor Passenger Vessels from 1838 to the Present Day | location=London | publisher=Staples Press | year=1957 | oclc=225962096}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Also, eastbound and westbound speed records are reckoned separately, as the more difficult westbound record voyage, against the [[Gulf Stream]] and the prevailing weather systems, typically results in lower average speeds.

Of the 35 Atlantic liners to hold the Blue Riband, 25 were British, followed by five German, three American, as well as one each from Italy and France. Thirteen were [[Cunard Line|Cunarders]] (plus [[RMS Queen Mary|''Queen Mary'']] of Cunard White Star), 5 by [[White Star Line|White Star]], with 4 owned by [[Norddeutscher Lloyd]], 2 by [[Collins Line|Collins]], 2 by [[Inman Line|Inman]] and 2 by [[Guion Line|Guion]], and one each by [[British and American Steam Navigation Company|British American]], [[Great Western Steamship Company|Great Western]], [[Hamburg America Line|Hamburg-America]], the [[Italian Line]], [[Compagnie Générale Transatlantique]] and finally the [[United States Lines]].&lt;ref name=kludas /&gt;
The record set by ''[[SS United States|United States]]'' in 1952 remains unbroken by any passenger liner.  The next longest period through which the Blue Riband was retained was 19 years, held from 1909 to 1929 by ''Mauretania''. The shortest period was 6 weeks, by ''Bremen'' from July to August 1933.

Many of these ships were built with substantial government subsidies and were designed with military considerations in mind.&lt;ref name=gibbs /&gt;  [[Winston Churchill]] estimated that the two Cunard Queens helped shorten the Second World War by a year.&lt;ref name=graham /&gt;  The last Atlantic liner to hold the Blue Riband, the [[SS United States|SS ''United States'']], was designed for her potential use as a troopship as well as her service as a commercial passenger liner.&lt;ref name=gibbs /&gt;

There was no formal award until 1935, when [[Harold Hales|Harold K. Hales]]  donated the [[Hales Trophy]]; though the rules for the Hales Trophy were different from the traditional rules for the Blue Riband (for example, the [[Hales Trophy]] was originally only awarded for westbound records&lt;ref name="Kludas p17"&gt;Kludas p17&lt;/ref&gt;) and changed several times thereafter. It was awarded to just three Blue Riband holders during the express liner era. The trophy continues to be awarded, though many people believe the ''United States'' remains as the holder of the Blue Riband because no subsequent record breaker was in Atlantic passenger service.&lt;ref name=kludas /&gt;

The [[Ocean rowing|Ocean Rowing]] Society inspired by The Blue Riband concept created Blue Riband Trophy of Ocean Rowing awarded to the fastest crew to cross the Atlantic Ocean in an unsupported row boat. Presently it is the most sought after trophy of ocean rowing.&lt;ref name="oceanrowing.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oceanrowing.com/statistics/record_standard.htm|title=ocean rowing world records blue riband trophy|website=www.oceanrowing.com|access-date=2016-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The first well-documented crossing of the North Atlantic, though [[List of crossings of the Atlantic Ocean|not the earliest]], was that of [[John Cabot]]'s ship [[Matthew (ship)|''Matthew'']] in the summer of 1497. ''Matthew'' crossed from [[Bristol]] to [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] in 35 days, returning the following month in just 17 days.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Firstbrook (1997) ''The Voyage of the Matthew'' p118  BBC Books {{ISBN|0 563 38764 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Over the next three centuries countless vessels (merchant ships and warships, fast and slow, in peace and war) crossed back and forth over the North Atlantic, all subject to the vagaries of wind and weather.  They arrived at port when they could, dependent on the wind, and left when they were loaded, frequently visiting other ports to complete their cargo. During this period eastbound passages of 30 and 45 days were not uncommon, while westward passages of 65 to 90 days excited no attention. It was the advent of the steam ship, with its independence from wind power, which offered the possibility of regular, scheduled Atlantic crossings, in periods of two to three weeks, that opened a new era of transatlantic travel and competition.&lt;ref&gt;Kludas  p33&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term “Blue Riband of the Atlantic” did not come into use until the 1890s, and the history of the trans-Atlantic competition, which was compiled retrospectively, was regarded as starting with the crossings by the steamships [[SS Sirius (1837)|''Sirius'']] and [[SS Great Western|''Great Western'']] in 1838. Although not the first steamships to cross the Atlantic ([[SS Savannah|''Savannah'']] had crossed in 1819, and [[SS Royal William|''Royal William'']] in 1831) nor the fastest to make the crossing (the [[Packet boat|packet]] sailing ship ''Columbia'' crossed west to east in 15 days 23 hours in 1830,&lt;ref&gt;Carl Cutler (1984) ''Greyhounds of the Sea|'' US Naval Institute {{ISBN|978-0850597288}}&lt;/ref&gt; and crossings by sail packets of 16 and 17 days were not unheard of) the ''Sirius'' and ''Great Western'' were the first steamships offering a regular, scheduled trans-Atlantic service; and crucially, they were involved in a race.&lt;ref&gt;Kludas p36-37&lt;/ref&gt; Cunard refused officially to recognise the title because racing vessels was not in line with the company's safety policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Great Transatlantic Liners|url=http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/maritime/archive/rtf/Ships-Great%20Transatlantic%20Liners%2C%20The%20no8.rtf|website=Maritime Archives|publisher=Merseyside Maritime Museum|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paddlers (1838–72)===

[[File:SS Sirius (1837).jpg|thumb|''Sirius'' is considered the first Atlantic record-holder for her 1838 voyage to New York at {{convert|8.03|kn|km/h}}.]]
[[File:Great Western maiden voyage.jpg|thumb|In 1843, ''Great Western'' recorded a record-breaking voyage of {{convert|10.03|kn|km/h}}.]]
The idea of building a line of transatlantic steamships was mooted in 1832 by Junius Smith, American lawyer turned London merchant. The idea came to him during an Atlantic crossing which took 57 days, a not unusual occurrence,&lt;ref&gt;Kludas p36&lt;/ref&gt; and it was published in the ''American Rail Road Journal''.&lt;ref name=pond&gt;{{cite book | last = Pond | first = Edgar LeRoy | coauthors = | title = Janius Smith | location =  | publisher=| year = 1927 | oclc = | page = }}&lt;/ref&gt; After receiving no support for several years, his plan gained credibility when Scottish shipbuilder, [[Macgregor Laird]] became an investor.&lt;ref name=fox /&gt;  Smith, who is often considered the ''Father of the Atlantic Liner'', formed the [[British and American Steam Navigation Company]] to operate a London-New York service. About the same time, the question of Atlantic steamships was discussed at an 1835 director's meeting of the newly formed Great Western Railway when the line’s chief engineer, [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]] supposedly joked that the line could be made longer by building a steamship to run between Bristol and New York. The necessary investors were recruited by Brunel's friend, Thomas Guppy, a Bristol engineer and businessman.&lt;ref name=heritage&gt;{{cite book | last = American Heritage | first =  | title = The Annihilation of Time and Space | location =  | publisher=| year = 1991 | oclc = | pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The next year, the [[Great Western Steamship Company]] was established, even though the rail line was still years from completion.&lt;ref name=corlett&gt;{{cite book | last = Corlett | first = Ewan | title = The Iron Ship: the Story of Brunel's ss Great Britain | location =  | publisher=Conway | year = 1975 | oclc = | pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By spring 1838, Brunel’s {{SS|Great Western||2}} was ready for sea, but Smith’s first ship was still without engines. When Great Western scheduled its initial sailing, Laird suggested that British and American charter the Irish Sea steamer {{SS|Sirius|1837|2}} from the St. George Steam Packet Company for two voyages to beat Great Western.&lt;ref name=heritage /&gt;  While the ''Sirius'' left [[Cork (city)|Cork]], Ireland four days before ''Great Western'' departed [[Avonmouth]], ''Great Western'' still came within a day of overtaking ''Sirius'' to New York.&lt;ref name=gibbs /&gt;  To complete the voyage, ''Sirius'' was forced to burn spars when coal ran low.&lt;ref name=heritage /&gt;  With her westbound crossing at  8.03 [[Knots (speed)|knots]] (14.87 [[km/h]]), ''Sirius'' is often considered the first record holder even though the notion would not be used for several generations.&lt;ref name=kludas /&gt;  ''Great Western'' herself became the prototype for all successful wooden paddlers and made a record-breaking voyage at {{convert|10.03|kn|km/h}} as late as 1843.&lt;ref name=gibbs /&gt;

[[File:RMS Europa.jpg|thumb|right|''Europa'' of 1848 set the record with a voyage of {{convert|11.79|kn|km/h}}. This is one of the earliest known photos of an Atlantic steamship.]]
The [[Cunard Line]] started its Liverpool-Halifax-Boston service in 1840 with the four ships that were slightly reduced versions of ''Great Western'' with about the same speed. Ultimately Cunard built nine additional wood paddlers. By 1846, Cunard was the only original steamship line that survived, largely because of its subsidy from the British [[Admiralty]] to carry the mails&lt;ref name=gibbs /&gt; and its emphasis on safety.&lt;ref name=graham&gt;{{cite book | last = Maxtone-Graham | first = John | title = The Only Way To Cross | location =  | publisher=Collier | year = 1972 | oclc = | pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Until 1850, the record passed between various Cunarders, finally reaching {{convert|12.25|kn|km/h}} for an 8-day Liverpool-Halifax crossing by ''Asia''.&lt;ref name=kludas /&gt;  Record voyages during this period were often the result of using sails to gain extra speed from a following gale.&lt;ref name=gibbs /&gt;

Cunard's first serious competition for the record came from the American-owned [[Collins Line]].&lt;ref name=gibbs /&gt;  The American Government supplied Collins with a substantial subsidy to operate four wooden paddlers that were superior to Cunard's best.&lt;ref name=fry&gt;{{cite book | last = Fry | first = Henry | title = The History of North Atlantic Steam Navigation with Some Account of Early Ships and Shipowners| location = London | publisher=Sampson, Low &amp; Marston | year = 1896 | oclc = 271397492 | page = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In its first year, 1850, the {{SS|Pacific|1849|2}} set the record at {{convert|12.46|kn|km/h}} on a 10-day run from Liverpool to New York. Unfortunately, Collins suffered a setback when its {{SS|Arctic||2}} foundered with heavy loss of life.&lt;ref name=gibbs /&gt;  The next year, Cunard put further pressure on Collins by commissioning its first iron-hulled paddler, the [[RMS Persia|''Persia'']], which set a new record with a 9-day, 16-hour Liverpool-New York voyage at {{convert|13.11|kn|km/h}}.&lt;ref name=kludas /&gt;  During the [[Crimean War]], Cunard supplied eleven of its ships for war service and suspended all routes except the Liverpool-Halifax-Boston service.&lt;ref name=fry /&gt;  While the Collins' fortunes improved because of the lack of competition during the war, Collins collapsed in 1858 after the loss of two additional steamers.&lt;ref name=gibbs /&gt;  Cunard emerged as the leading carrier of first class passengers and in 1862 commissioned the [[RMS Scotia|''Scotia'']], the last paddle steamer to set a record with a Queenstown-New York voyage at {{convert|14.46|kn|km/h}}.  ''Scotia'' was the final significant paddler ordered for the Atlantic because under the terms of Cunard's mail contract with the Admiralty, it was still required to supply paddle steamers when needed for military service.&lt;ref name=kludas /&gt;

===Single screw steamers (1872–89)===
[[File:Adriatic (1871).jpg|thumb|White Star's ''Adriatic'' by George Parker Greenwood. She was the first successful screw liner with an 1872 run at {{convert|14.65|kn|km/h}}]]
[[File:RMS Etruria.jpg|thumb|Cunard's ''Etruria'' of 1885, averaged {{convert|19.56|kn|km/h}} on a record-breaking 1888 crossing]]

In 1845, Brunel’s {{SS|Great Britain||2}} became the first iron-hulled screw liner on the Atlantic. Starting in 1850, the [[Inman Line]] built numerous reduced versions for the [[steerage (deck)|steerage]] trade. In 1866, Inman started to commission single screw express liners that were the equal of ''Scotia''.&lt;ref name=gibbs /&gt;  The Admiralty allowed Cunard to order its first screw express liner, the ''Russia''.&lt;ref name=fry /&gt;  In 1871 both companies faced a new rival when the [[White Star Line]] commissioned [[RMS Oceanic (1870)|''Oceanic'']] and her five sisters. The following year, White Star’s ''Adriatic'' finally surpassed ''Scotia'' with a voyage at {{convert|14.65|kn|km/h}}.&lt;ref name=kludas /&gt;  The new White Star record breakers were especially economical because of their use of compound engines, but their high ratio of length to beam (10:1 compared to the previous norm of 8:1) increased vibration. To counter this, White Star placed the dining saloon midships and made their ships more luxurious. Inman rebuilt its express fleet to the new standard, but Cunard lagged behind both of its rivals.&lt;ref name=gibbs /&gt;  In 1875, Inman’s new [[SS City of Berlin|''City of Berlin'']] averaged {{convert|15.21|kn|km/h}} on its record-breaking voyage.&lt;ref name=kludas /&gt;

During the five-year [[Panic of 1873|shipping depression]] that began in 1873, William Pearce, the controlling partner of the [[Fairfield Shipbuilding|John Elder shipyard]], became convinced that a crack steamer that carried only passengers and light freight could be profitable because she would attract more passengers and spend less time in port.&lt;ref name=fox /&gt;  He proposed a ship that crammed the most powerful machinery possible into the hull, sacrificing everything to speed.&lt;ref name=gibbs /&gt;  When Cunard rejected his proposal, Pearce offered his idea to the [[Guion Line]], a firm primarily engaged in the steerage trade. The first ship Pearce built for Guion, the [[SS Arizona|''Arizona'']] was described as a "souped up transatlantic hot rod" by one nautical historian.&lt;ref name=fox /&gt;  While she only won the eastbound record,&lt;ref name=fry /&gt;  two years later, Guion took delivery of the even faster ''Alaska'' that set the record at {{convert|16.07|kn|km/h}}.&lt;ref name=kludas /&gt;  To continue the program, Pearce offered Guion favourable terms on a third unit, the [[SS Oregon (1883)|''Oregon'']], which raised the record to {{convert|18.56|kn|km/h}} in 1884.&lt;ref name=kludas /&gt;  These ships were uncomfortable and their excessive coal consumption made them uneconomic.&lt;ref name=gibbs /&gt;  However, for a while they were popular with American clients because of their American ownership.&lt;ref name=fry /&gt;

After being out of the contest for a decade, Cunard finally started to rebuild. In 1884, Cunard purchased ''Oregon'' from the Guion line when that firm defaulted on payments to the shipyard. Later that year, Cunard commissioned the first steel-hulled record-breakers, [[RMS Umbria|''Umbria'']] and [[RMS Etruria|''Etruria'']].&lt;ref name=fry /&gt;  ''Etruria'', the faster of the pair, raised the record to {{convert|19.56|kn|km/h}} on a 6-day, 2-hour run from Queenstown to Sandy Hook in 1888. However, ''Etruria'' and her sister represented the limit of single screw technology.&lt;ref name=kludas /&gt;

===Double screw steamers (1889–1907)===
[[File:City of paris.jpg|thumb|Inman's ''City of Paris'' set a record of {{convert|20.01|kn|km/h}} in 1889.]]
[[File:Kaiser wilhelm der grosse 01.jpg|thumb|NDL's ''Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse'' raised the record to {{convert|22.29|kn|km/h}} in 1898]]
The Inman line fell on hard times after their intended record-breaker, ''City of Rome'' failed to meet expectations and was returned to her builders in 1882. Inman directors agreed to voluntary liquidation so that the largest creditor, the Philadelphia-based [[International Navigation Company]] could purchase Inman's assets.&lt;ref name=gibbs /&gt;  The new owners provided the capital to build two outstanding record breakers, the twin screw {{SS|City of New York||2}} and the {{SS|City of Paris|1888|2}}. Starting in 1889, the later ship set the record on four occasions, including a voyage at {{convert|20.7|kn|km/h}} in 1892. White Star, which had not built an express liner since the {{SS|Germanic|1875|2}} of 1875, commissioned the record-breaker, {{SS|Teutonic|1889|2}} of 1889 and {{SS|Majestic|1890|2}} of 1890 after receiving a subsidy from the [[Admiralty]] to make the pair available as merchant cruisers in the event of hostilities. Cunard countered with two even faster ships, the [[RMS Campania|''Campania'']] and the [[RMS Lucania|''Lucania'']] of 1893.&lt;ref name=fry /&gt;  The next year, ''Lucania'' recorded a voyage at {{convert|21.81|kn|km/h}}.&lt;ref name=kludas /&gt;  Inman became the [[American Line]] and ordered two additional express liners from American yards, but no attempt was made to best the new Cunarders. In 1894, Guion ceased sailing as its ships were now hopelessly outdated.&lt;ref name=gibbs /&gt;

No sooner had Cunard reestablished its supremacy than new rivals emerged. Beginning in the late 1860s, several German firms commissioned liners that were almost as fast as the British mail steamers working from Liverpool.&lt;ref name=gibbs /&gt;  In 1889, the [[Hamburg America Line|Hamburg-America Line]] commissioned four double screw steamers capable of {{convert|18.00|kn|km/h}}. Its rival, [[Norddeutscher Lloyd]] (NDL) lagged behind until 1895 when it ordered two ships intended to take the record. In 1898, the {{SS|Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse||2}} raised the record to {{convert|22.29|kn|km/h}}, while the other liner, ''Kaiser Friedrich'' failed to achieve her contract speed and was returned to her builders. Hamburg America ordered the even more powerful {{SS|Deutschland|1900|2}} that reached {{convert|23.06|kn|km/h}} on one of her record-breaking 1900 voyages. However, Hamburg America quickly learned that these high powered double screw liners had vibration problems. ''Deutschland'' had the unpleasant nickname, "cocktail shaker" and actually lost part of her stern in 1902 because of the constant vibration.&lt;ref name=kludas /&gt;

Rather than match the new German speedsters, White Star decided to drop out of the competition and commission the four large ''Celtic''-class luxury liners of more moderate speed. White Star realised that passengers preferred comfort even if this means spending an extra day at sea. In 1902, White Star joined the well capitalised American combine, the [[International Mercantile Marine Co.]] (IMM) that owned the American Line and others. IMM also had trade agreements with Hamburg America and Norddeutscher Lloyd. After its bad experience with the ''Deutschland'', Hamburg America also dropped out of the race and commissioned large luxury liners based on the ''Celtic''. However, NDL completed building a fleet of four additional express liners modelled on ''Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse''.&lt;ref name=gibbs /&gt;

===Ships of state (1907–69)===
[[File:RMS Mauretania.jpg|thumb|Cunard's ''Mauretania'' held the Blue Riband from 1909 to 1929 at {{convert|26.06|kn|km/h}}]]
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-11081, Schnelldamper "Bremen".jpg|thumb|NDL's ''Bremen'' finally broke ''Mauretania'''s record in 1929 by averaging {{convert|27.83|kn|km/h}}]]
[[File:B-17s flyby Rex.jpg|thumb|The Italian ''Rex'' joined the Blue Riband club with a 1933 voyage of {{convert|28.92|kn|km/h}}]]
[[File:SS-Normandie side01 NYC.jpg|thumb|CGT's ''Normandie'' won the Blue Riband at {{convert|30.58|kn|km/h}} in 1937.]]
[[File:Rms queen mary 2008.jpg|thumb|Cunard White Star's ''Queen Mary'' regained the Blue Riband at {{convert|30.99|kn|km/h}} in 1938.]]
[[File:SS United States postcard.jpg|thumb|''United States'' won the Blue Riband at {{convert|34.51|kn|km/h}} in 1952. Formally, she still holds the title.]]
After 1902, only the Cunard Line and the French [[Compagnie Générale Transatlantique]] (CGT) were independent of the IMM combine. British prestige was at stake, and the Government provided Cunard with an annual subsidy of £150,000 plus a low interest loan of £2.5&amp;nbsp;million to pay for the construction of the two [[Superliner (passenger ship)|superliners]], [[RMS Lusitania|''Lusitania'']] and [[RMS Mauretania (1906)|''Mauretania'']] under the condition that they be available for conversion to armed cruisers when needed by the navy.&lt;ref name=gibbs /&gt;  Starting in 1907, both ships won the Blue Riband and ''Mauretania’s'' 1909 record of {{convert|26.06|kn|km/h}} stood for 20 years.&lt;ref name=kludas /&gt;  However, these ships paid a price for speed and lacked many of the amenities found in the new White Star and Hamburg American luxury liners. Both Cunard rivals ordered a trio of even bigger luxury liners, the White Star [[Olympic class ocean liner|''Olympic''-class]] capable of {{convert|21.5|kn|km/h}} and Hapag [[SS Imperator|''Imperator''-class]] capable of {{convert|22.5|kn|km/h}}. Even Cunard chose this approach when it ordered its third superliner, the [[RMS Aquitania|''Aquitania'']].&lt;ref name=graham /&gt;

There is a persistent rumor that {{RMS|Titanic}} was attempting to win the Blue Riband and that such effort resulted in excessive speed and collision with the iceberg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maltin|first1=Tim|last2=Aston|first2=Eloise|title=101 things you thought you knew about the Titanic-- but didn't!|date=2011|publisher=Penguin Books|location=New York, N.Y.|isbn=978-0143119098|pages=43-47}}Chapter 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Such a rumor is undoubtedly false, as the Titanic was built for luxury not speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.titanic-titanic.com/titanic_myths.shtml|title=Titanic Myths|author=|date=|website=www.titanic-titanic.com|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the war, Hamburg American and Norddeutscher Lloyd lost their premier units. In 1926, the U.S. Government awarded Norddeutscher Lloyd (NDL) $27&amp;nbsp;million in compensation for its confiscated liners. By this time, improvements in turbine technology and hull form along with the use of fuel oil instead of coal made it possible to build more civilised record breakers. Using these funds, NDL ordered two ships designed to cross the Atlantic in five days, the {{SS|Bremen|1929|2}} and {{SS|Europa|1930|2}}. However, the American government netted the award against debts owed by the German Government and Berlin was forced to directly subsidise NDL to continue the project.  ''Bremen'' recorded {{convert|27.83|kn|km/h}} on her 1929 Blue Riband voyage and ''Europa'' increased the Blue Riband to {{convert|27.92|kn|km/h}} in 1933.&lt;ref name=kludas /&gt;

In 1928, as Britain's response to the German {{SS|Bremen|1929|2}} and {{SS|Europa|1930|2}}, the [[White Star Line]] ordered a new Diesel-electric 1000-ft long ocean liner to be named [[Oceanic (unfinished ship)|''Oceanic'']] capable of  200,000 SHP. Construction started June 28, 1928. However, White Star did not have the funds to complete the liner. Oceanic's construction was put on hold until 1931 when her keel was silently scrapped. Oceanic's ahead-of-their-time engines would have been powerful enough to enable her to possibly win the Blue Riband.

In 1929, two lines from Italy each ordered a ship based on the German pair. Just as these ships were being completed, the Italian government nationalised the shipping industry, creating the [[Italian Line]]. While both superliners were successful, only the {{SS|Rex||2}} won the Blue Riband, with a 1933 voyage at {{convert|28.92|kn|km/h}}.&lt;ref name=gibbs /&gt;

CGT also ordered a new superliner in 1929. The next year, Cunard started construction on an 80,000 ton liner that was to be the first of two record breakers fast enough to fit into a two ship weekly Southampton-New York service.&lt;ref name=graham /&gt; Consequently, CGT altered its plans to make its new liner even bigger.&lt;ref name=kludas /&gt;  However, as the 1929 shipping depression intensified, construction on Cunard’s hull 534 was halted while work on the heavily subsidised French ship continued. By 1934, both Cunard and White Star lines were failing and the British Government was concerned about potential job losses. Therefore, the government agreed to give Cunard a loan of £3&amp;nbsp;million to complete hull 534 as the {{RMS|Queen Mary||2}} and an additional £5&amp;nbsp;million to build a second ship, the {{RMS|Queen Elizabeth||2}} only if Cunard merged with White Star.&lt;ref name=graham /&gt;

CGT's {{SS|Normandie||2}} entered service in 1935 and won the Blue Riband at {{convert|29.98|kn|km/h}}.  ''Queen Mary'' was commissioned the next year, and after a few break-in voyages, took the Blue Riband to {{convert|30.14|kn|km/h}}. The two liners were operated a pair and traded the Blue Riband again, with the Cunard White Star Liner ultimately posting {{convert|30.99|kn|km/h}} in 1938.&lt;ref name=kludas /&gt; ''Queen Mary’s'' consort, ''Queen Elizabeth'', was commissioned after war was declared and was never allowed to attempt the record.&lt;ref name=gibbs /&gt;

In 1935, [[Harold Hales|Harold K. Hales]] (1868–1942), a member of the UK Parliament and owner of a shipping company, commissioned [[Hales Trophy|a large trophy]] to be presented to the fastest ship crossing the Atlantic, in order to formalize the rules surrounding the trans Atlantic competition. The rules for the trophy did not correspond to the traditional rules for the Blue Riband in that the trophy was to be awarded only to surface passenger ship achieving the fastest speed in the westbound direction.&lt;ref name="Kludas p17"/&gt; Other rule changes further complicated the situation, and eventually the trophy was awarded to just three Blue Riband holders; ''Rex'', in 1935, ''Normandie'' in 1936, and ''United States'' in 1952.

Of the ships of state, only ''Queen Mary'', ''Queen Elizabeth'' and ''Europa'' survived the war. ''Europa'' became CGT's ''Liberte'' and no attempt was made to retain her former speed when she was reconstructed.&lt;ref name=gibbs /&gt;  However, the United States government was impressed by the large numbers of troops carried by the Queens during the war, and ordered a superliner that was as much a troop carrier as an express liner. On her maiden voyage in 1952, the [[SS United States|''United States'']] upped the Blue Riband to {{convert|34.51|kn|km/h}}. In 1958, the transatlantic airlines put jet transports into service and the days of the record breakers were numbered.  ''Liberte'' retired in 1961, along with ''Queen Mary'' in 1967, and ''United States'' in 1969.&lt;ref name=kludas /&gt;

===The Blue Riband today (1969–present)===
With the success of ''United States'' in 1952 and Cunard's decision not to challenge the new record the Blue Riband contest again subsided. There was a growing recognition that the era of fast crossings by express liners was becoming a thing of the past, and that the contest for fast transatlantic travel was shifting to the air.&lt;ref name=Times8752&gt;[http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/newspaperRetrieve.do?sgHitCountType=None&amp;sort=DateAscend&amp;tabID=T003&amp;prodId=TTDA&amp;resultListType=RESULT_LIST&amp;searchId=R1&amp;searchType=BasicSearchForm&amp;currentPosition=13&amp;qrySerId=Locale%28en%2C%2C%29%3AFQE%3D%28tx%2CNone%2C11%29Blue+Riband%3AAnd%3ALQE%3D%28da%2CNone%2C23%2901%2F01%2F1952+-+12%2F31%2F1952%3AAnd%3ALQE%3D%28MB%2CNone%2C8%29%22TTDA-1%22%24&amp;retrieveFormat=MULTIPAGE_DOCUMENT&amp;userGroupName=livlibtda&amp;inPS=true&amp;contentSet=LTO&amp;&amp;docId=&amp;docLevel=FASCIMILE&amp;workId=&amp;relevancePageBatch=CS117919464&amp;contentSet=UDVIN&amp;callistoContentSet=UDVIN&amp;docPage=article&amp;hilite=y The Blue Riband]: Editorial, 8 July 1952, [[The Times]]; retrieved 31 July 12017&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1930s, air travel was already competing with the express liners for fast Atlantic crossings; in 1936 the German company DELAG commenced an airship service to New York, their [[LZ 129 Hindenburg|''Hindenburg'']] crossing from Europe to America in times ranging from 53 to 78 hours, and the following year, while  experimenting with a flying boat service, Empire Airways [[Short Empire#Operational history|''Caledonia'']] reduced this to 15 hours.
In the post-war period times were reduced again by  the advent of land based airliners, such as the [[Lockheed Constellation]]. Hopes in 1952 were expressed for the new [[de Havilland Comet]] jetliner,&lt;ref name=Times8752/&gt; though these were dashed by [[de Havilland Comet#Early hull losses|the succession of crashes]] that halted the Comet programme. A regular jetliner service was finally introduced in 1958 with the [[Boeing 707]] and the [[Douglas DC-8|DC 8]], cutting the crossing to 7 hours. The final step in the quest for trans-Atlantic speed was the [[BAC Concorde]], which set a record in 1996 of a second under two hours 53 minutes, at an average speed of 1250&amp;nbsp;mph (Mach 1.9),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/60at60/2015/8/1996-fastest-flight-across-the-atlantic-in-a-commercial-aircraft-392882 1996: Fastest flight across the Atlantic in a commercial aircraft] at [[Guinness World Records]], retrieved 30 July 2017&lt;/ref&gt; but by this time airlines were aware that cost and comfort were more important to passengers than speed, and the emphasis shifted to aircraft like the [[Boeing 747]], with a sleeper capacity for business passengers.

At sea ''United States'' record stood until 1986, when it was challenged by British entrepreneur [[Richard Branson]], and his  high-speed motor vessel, ''Virgin Atlantic Challenger''. Despite having to stop to refuel on several occasions, Branson shaved two hours off the record, increasing the average speed to 36.4 knots. However, as '' Virgin Atlantic Challenger'' was not a passenger vessel the New York Maritime Museum refused to part with the Hales Trophy, so Branson inaugurated the [[Virgin Atlantic Challenge Trophy]], for the fastest unqualified Atlantic crossing, open to all challengers. Three years later this was won by Tom Gentry, whose ''Gentry Eagle'' slashed the record, crossing in 62 hours at an average 47.4 knots. 
In 1992 the Virgin Atlantic Challenge was again won, by the [[Aga Khan]]'s ''[[Destriero]]'' crossing in 58 hour 34 minutes and averaging 53.09 knots. She also made a record-breaking return journey, winning the [[Columbus Atlantic Trophy]], posted by the yacht club in response to the Virgin Atlantic Challenge for the fastest two-way voyage i.e. a single crossing and return voyage within a specified time.

Meanwhile, [[Incat]], builders of fast catamaran ferries, and therefore indisputably commercial vessels, decided to make an attempt to win the Hales Trophy, for which the record was still that of  ''United States''. This was achieved in 1990 by ''[[Hoverspeed Great Britain]]'', with a non-stop crossing of 79 hours 54 minutes, averaging 36.6 knots and Incat were awarded the trophy by the Hales Trophy Committee. Eight years later this record was broken by another Incat vessel, ''[[Catalonia (ship)|Catalonia]]'' and again the following month by ''[[Cat-Link V]]''.

The [[Ocean rowing|Ocean Rowing]] Society inspired by The Blue Riband concept created Blue Riband Trophy of Ocean Rowing awarded to the fastest crew to cross the Atlantic Ocean in an unsupported row boat. Presently it is the most sought after trophy of Ocean Rowing.&lt;ref name="oceanrowing.com"/&gt;

With the end of the express liners era the Blue Riband has become an item of largely historical interest, with some authors regarding the ''United States'' as the last holder of the accolade;&lt;ref name=kludas /&gt; meanwhile the goal of the fastest Atlantic crossings remains a physical and technological challenge and at least three awards for the feat remain in play.

==List of record breakers==
The following is the latest consensus list of the research to date. Because there was no sanctioning body for the Blue Riband, researchers are limited to surviving shipping company archives and press reports to develop the list of Blue Riband winners. These lists are retrospective, and limited to steamships only. Therefore, most lists feature ''Sirius'', in her race with ''Great Western'' in 1838, as the first record-holder, although her crossing was not as fast as some sail packet ships of the period. Early writers including Arthur Maginnus (1892), Henry Frey (1896), Charles Lee (1931) and C. R. Benstead (1936) were the standard sources until the 1950s. Since then, C. R. Vernon Gibbs (1952),&lt;ref name=gibbs /&gt; and Noel Bonsor (1975) added to the body of knowledge, with additional detail about the German ships provided by Arnold Kludas.&lt;ref name=kludas /&gt;

Over the years, the lists have not agreed. For example, Gibbs credits Inman's ''City of Paris'' with an 1866 Blue Riband voyage, and Cunard's ''Russia'' with an eastbound record the following year because he considered as dubious ''Scotia's'' Blue Riband claim of {{convert|14.46|kn|km/h}}, supposedly based on a very long track.&lt;ref name=gibbs /&gt;  Later writers have included the ''Scotia'' claim.&lt;ref name=kludas /&gt;  Gibbs also includes the claimed Blue Riband voyage at {{convert|17.6|kn|km/h}} of the National Line's ''America'' of 1884&lt;ref name=gibbs /&gt; that was not confirmed by later researchers.&lt;ref name=kludas /&gt;

==Scottish Referendum==
Business for Scotland Ltd registered with the [[Electoral Commission]] as a "permitted participant" on the Yes side in the [[Scottish independence referendum, 2014]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/169153/35-14-Response-for-web.pdf FoI response from Electoral Commission]&lt;/ref&gt; It spent £143,027 campaigning at the independence referendum&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/i-am-a/journalist/electoral-commission-media-centre/news-releases-donations/electoral-commission-publishes-first-details-of-spending-by-campaigners-at-the-scottish-independence-referendum?

After the referendum it was revealed that Business for Scotland received a £100,000 donation from Stagecoach founder Brain Souter. 

The Founder and Chief Executive of the organisation, and registered responsible person with the electoral commission was Gordon MacIntyre-Kemp.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/15105527.Business_for_Scotland_boss_admits_losing_money_on_his_business/|title=Business for Scotland boss admits losing money on his business|last=Gordon|first=Tom|date=2017-02-21|website=Herald Scotland|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation was chaired during the referendum by Tony Banks. 

Pro Unionist blogger Kevin Hague&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; put a complaint in to the [[Electoral Commission]] to consider whether the SNP and Business for Scotland had worked together during the Scottish referendum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sanderson|first1=Daniel|title=Electoral Commission to look at claims SNP broke indyref spending rules|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/politics/13840098.Electoral_Commission_to_look_at_claims_SNP_broke_indyref_spending_rules/|accessdate=13 October 2015|publisher=HeraldScotland}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Electoral Commission "found no evidence during its assessment that the SNP and BFS worked together" and consequently stated there was no need to open a full investigation into the allegations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/i-am-a/journalist/electoral-commission-media-centre/news-releases-donations/electoral-commission-concludes-assessment-of-allegations-against-business-for-scotland-and-the-scottish-national-party |title=Electoral Commission concludes assessment of allegations against Business for Scotland and the Scottish National Party |work= |publisher=Electoral Commission |date=15 October 2015 |accessdate=15 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was reported in the Herald that the Electoral Commission gave the accusations extremely short shrift.

==History==
[[Image:Butterball plant, Longmont, CO IMG 5214.JPG|200px|right|thumb|The Butterball plant in downtown [[Longmont, Colorado|Longmont]], [[Colorado]]]]

The name Butterball was originally registered as trademark #378,438 on June 11, 1940, by Ada Walker of [[Wyoming, Ohio|Wyoming]], [[Ohio]]. Leo Peters purchased the trademark in February 1951. Leo Peters licensed the name to [[JBS USA|Swift and Co.]] for 10 years before selling it in the 1960s. Peters sold the name "Butterball" to Swift, which was acquired by [[ConAgra]] in 1990.

Leo Peters retained rights to use the name '''Butterball Farms''' for his butter products&lt;ref name="retained"&gt;{{cite web

In October 2006, ConAgra's Butterball branded turkey business was sold to [[North Carolina]]-based '''Carolina Turkeys,''' making Carolina Turkey the largest turkey producer in the United States.&lt;ref name="largest"&gt;{{cite news

In 2008, the company moved its headquarters to a new $12 million building in Greenfield North off Interstate 40 in [[Garner, North Carolina]]. The headquarters has a "customer experience center" with a special kitchen for promotional demonstrations.&lt;ref name="major deal"&gt;{{cite news

Smithfield offered $200 million to Maxwell Farms for the portion of Butterball that Smithfield did not own. Chief executive C. Larry Pope said at that time that he hoped Maxwell Farms would spend more on the company's facilities and marketing. A decision had to be made whether to buy Maxwell's share or sell Smithfield's. On September 10, 2010, Smithfield announced the sale of its 49 percent share of Butterball for an estimated $175 million. Maxwell Farms will sell 50 percent of Butterball to Seaboard Corp.&lt;ref name=Smithfield&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/2010/09/10/673672/smithfield-to-sell-its-stake-in.html|title=Smithfield to sell its stake in Butterball|last=Felberbaum|first=Michael|work=[[News &amp; Observer]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=2010-09-10|accessdate=2010-09-10}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Turkey Talk-Line==
Beginning in late 1981, Butterball has maintained a toll-free telephone line called the Turkey Talk-Line to help customers with cooking and preparation questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/butterballs-turkey-hotline-has-been-preventing-thanksgiving-disasters-35-years-174358/ |publisher=Ad Week |title=Butterball’s Turkey Hotline Has Been Preventing Thanksgiving Disasters for 35 Years |date=November 1, 2016 |author=Robert Klara}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eleven thousand people called in 1981, and in recent years the number has grown to over 200,000 each holiday season. The most frequent question asked is how long a turkey takes to defrost.

In ''[[The West Wing]]'' episode "[[The Indians in the Lobby]]", President [[Josiah Bartlet]] calls the number (referred to as the "Butterball Hotline" in the script) to discuss stuffing and cooking his Thanksgiving turkey.

==Criticism==
Animal welfare activists such as [[Mercy for Animals]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Free Animal Video|title=Butterball Turkey Animal Cruelty Undercover Video MFA|date=2014-04-25|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bhi-Gg2b46A|accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Humane Society of the United States]], and [[PETA]] have accused Butterball of animal cruelty.&lt;ref name="butterballabuse"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://butterballabuse.com/ |title=Butterball Abuse |date=December 28, 2011 |publisher=Mercy for Animals |accessdate=December 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peta.org/features/butterball-peta-investigation.aspx|title=Butterball's House of Horrors: A PETA Undercover Investigation |date=2010-10-21|accessdate=December 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.humanesociety.org/news/press_releases/2009/12/shareholder_resolution_urges.html |title=Shareholder Resolution Urges Smithfield to Help Decrease Suffering of Butterball Turkeys |date=December 22, 2009 |publisher=Humane Society of the United States |accessdate=December 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These organizations cite intentional cruelty inflicted on the birds, as well as the incidental cruelty inherent in the slaughter methods used, and the breeding practices which produce animals too large to reproduce without human intervention.

In October 2012, a Mercy for Animals investigator documented a pattern of abuse and neglect at numerous Butterball turkey operations in North Carolina. The investigation revealed workers kicking and stomping on birds, dragging them by their wings and necks, and throwing turkeys onto the ground or on top of other birds; birds suffering from serious untreated illnesses and injuries, including open sores, infections, and broken bones; and workers grabbing birds by their wings or necks and violently slamming them into tiny transport crates with no regard for their welfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Butterball Abuse: Undercover Investigation Exposes Shocking Cruelty...Again!|url=http://www.butterballabuse.com/|publisher=Mercy For Animals}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This investigation occurred less than one year after a Mercy for Animals undercover investigation into a different Butterball turkey facility led to five workers being charged with criminal [[cruelty to animals]]. Mercy for Animals’ 2011 investigation at a Butterball turkey factory farm in Shannon, Hoke County, North Carolina revealed Butterball workers violently kicking and stomping on birds, dragging them by their wings and necks, slamming them into transport crates, and leaving turkeys to suffer from serious untreated injuries and infections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Butterball Abuse|url=http://www.butterballabuse.com/|publisher=Mercy For Animals|accessdate=5 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the investigation, North Carolina officials raided the facility and arrested several employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Galli|first=Cindy|title=Butterball Turkey Raided Amid Animal Abuse Allegations|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/butterball-turkey-raided-amid-animal-abuse-allegations/story?id=15249456#.Tvyp6lb4WSo|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=25 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2012, Butterball worker Brian Douglas pleaded guilty to felony cruelty to animals—marking the first-ever felony conviction for cruelty to factory-farmed birds in United States history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Runkle|first=Nathan|title=Making History: Butterball Case Marks First-Ever Felony Conviction for Cruelty to Factory-Farmed Birds|url=http://www.mfablog.org/2012/08/making-history-butterball-conviction-marks-first-ever-felony-conviction-for-cruelty-to-factory-farme.html|publisher=Mercy For Animals|accessdate=5 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Winter|first=Michael|title=Ex-N.C. turkey farm worker pleads guilty to animal cruelty|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/ondeadline/post/2012/08/nc-turkey-farm-worker-pleads-guilty-to-animal-cruelty/1|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=5 September 2012|date=28 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several days later, another Butterball employee, Rueben Mendoza, pleaded guilty to misdemeanor cruelty to animals and felony identity theft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Breaking News: Another Butterball Worker Pleads Guilty to Cruelty to Animals|url=http://www.mfablog.org/2012/08/breaking-news-another-butterball-worker-pleads-guilty-to-cruelty-to-animals.html|publisher=Mercy For Animals|accessdate=5 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2013, two more Butterball workers, Terry Johnson and Billy McBride, were found guilty of misdemeanor animal cruelty as a result of MFA's investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Runkle|first=Nathan|title=Breaking News: Two More Butterball Workers Convicted of Cruelty to Animals|url=http://www.mfablog.org/2013/02/breaking-news-two-more-butterball-workers-convicted-of-cruelty-to-animals.html|publisher=Mercy For Animals|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the felony and misdemeanor cruelty convictions, MFA’s investigation at Butterball uncovered government corruption. Dr. Sarah Jean Mason, the director of Animal Health Programs with the North Carolina Department of Agriculture, was arrested and pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice charges after admitting to warning Butterball about the raid by law enforcement and potentially compromising the criminal cruelty investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=More animal cruelty arrests at Butterball facility in Hoke County|url=http://www2.journalnow.com/news/2012/feb/17/more-animal-cruelty-arrests-at-butterball-facility-ar-1941598/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130127152549/http://www2.journalnow.com/news/2012/feb/17/more-animal-cruelty-arrests-at-butterball-facility-ar-1941598/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=27 January 2013|publisher=Winston-Salem Journal|accessdate=5 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chang Hsiao-yen''' ({{zh|t=張小燕|s=张小燕|p=Zhāng Xiǎoyàn)}}; born 11 August 1948) is a [[Taiwan]]ese television host and actress. Born in Shanghai, China, Chang relocated to Taiwan after the [[Chinese Civil War]] where she started her acting career at the age of five as a child actress in cinema. In 1958, she received her first Best Child Actress award at the [[Asia Pacific Film Festival]], a recognition she earned for three consecutive years and which placed her alongside notable child stars such as [[Josephine Siao]], [[Lydia Shum]], [[Fung Bo Bo]] and [[Connie Chan]]. Since the 1980s, Chang has become a household name in Taiwan after hosting the [[Chinese Television System|CTS]] variety show ''Variety 100'' (綜藝100) which is one of the most successful shows in the television history of Taiwan. She is also known for her work as the host of highly rated variety shows such as ''Weekend Pie'' (週末派), ''Super Sunday'' (超級星期天), ''Million-Dollar Class'' (百萬小學堂) and ''SS Hsiao-yen Night'' (SS小燕之夜).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.cts.com.tw/cts/english/201106/201106060751033.html | title=THE ULTIMATE ENTERTAINER | work=CTS | date=6 June 2011 | accessdate=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to her television and film work, Chang co-founded the record label Forward Music (豐華唱片) which launched the singing career of then newcomers [[A-mei]] and [[Tao Ching-Ying]]. She is also a mentor of television hosts [[Mickey Huang]], [[Pu Hsueh-liang]] and [[Bowie Tsang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.chinatimes.com/newspapers/20150909000710-260112 | title=阿亮迎半百 壯膽啵小燕謝恩 | work=China Times | date=9 September 2015 | accessdate=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an annual poll conducted by [[Reader's Digest]] in 2015, Chang was voted the most trusted Taiwanese variety show host.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.chinatimes.com/newspapers/20150626000805-260112 | title=謝震武張小燕 雙掛最受信任主持人 | work=China Times | date=26 June 2015 | accessdate=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chin Sophonpanich''' ({{lang-th|ชิน โสภณพนิช}}; {{zh|t=陳弼臣|p=Chén Bìchén}}; 10 November 1908 – 4 January 1988) was a Thai entrepreneur who founded [[Bangkok Bank]] and [[Bangkok Insurance]].

== Biography ==
Chin was born to a [[Thai Chinese|Chinese immigrant]] father from [[Chaoyang, Shantou|Chaoyang]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Thailand|pages=282|author=[[Chris Baker (writer)|Chris Baker]], [[Pasuk Phongpaichit]]|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=0-521-81615-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  who worked at a sawmill, and a local-born [[Thai Chinese]] mother in [[Thon Buri (district)|Thonburi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bamboo Network: How Expatriate Chinese Entrepreneurs Are Creating a New Economic Superpower in Asia|author=[[Murray Weidenbaum]], Samuel Hughes|publisher=[[Free Press (publisher)|Free Press]]|isbn=0-684-82289-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{zh icon}} [http://www.wbn.cn/climemodel/news1.asp?id=5492 陈弼臣父子两代 情倾家乡教育] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051107004520/http://www.wbn.cn/climemodel/news1.asp?id=5492 |date=2005-11-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bangkok]]. At the age of five years, Chin was sent back to China for education, and upon returning to Thailand at 17, he took up his first job as a manual labourer.

In 1944, Chin founded the Bangkok Bank, which started with only two shophouses. The bank later expanded and diversified its branches into [[Hong Kong]], and Chin lived in Hong Kong from 1957 onwards when Thailand came under the rule of [[Sarit Thanarat]], after he fell out of favour with the former dictator. 

By 1972, the bank was listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange.

Chin died at the age of 80 in 1988. He had two wives. With his first wife, Lau Kwei Ying, he had two sons, [[Rabin Sophonpanich]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.queengallery.org/en/special.php Founder Donors] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070317233539/http://www.queengallery.org/en/special.php |date=2007-03-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Chatri Sophonpanich]]. With his second wife, Boonsri, he had seven children, including Chote Sophonpanich and the [[Khunying]] Chodchoi Sophonpanich ({{zh|c=陳鳳翎}}).

Chatri Sophonpanich served as president of the Bangkok Bank from 1980 to 1992, and his son, Chartsiri Sophonpanich, has been president since 1994.

Rabin Sophonpanich (also known as Robin Chan) has since relocated to [[Hong Kong]] with his family, and his son, [[Bernard Charnwut Chan|Bernard Chan]] later became a local legislator and its Executive Council member.

Chin's daughter-in-law, the [[Khunying]] [[Kalaya Sophonpanich]], wife of Chote Sophonpanich, was the Thai [[Democrat Party (Thailand)|Democrat Party]]'s Minister of Science and Technology. On 23 February 2009, she presided over the opening ceremony of the 2008 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics, ROBIO 2008, held in [[Bangkok, Thailand]].

'''ConsumerAffairs''' is a [[dot-com company]] founded in 1998 by Jim Hood. It is an international company headquartered in [[Lake Tahoe|Stateline, Nevada]] with offices in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], the Philippines and Argentina. It is not a government organization or a non-profit organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About us|url=https://www.consumeraffairs.com/about/faq/#header|accessdate=28 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company provides consumer news and a [[SaaS]] that allows brands to connect with consumers called ConsumerAffairs for Brands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=STANCAVAGE|first1=JOHN|title=John Stancavage: Consumer web publication growing downtown|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/business/johnstancavage/john-stancavage-consumer-web-publication-growing-downtown/article_0b46cb58-f5f2-590c-af3d-a4d1576012cd.html|publisher=[[Tulsa World]]|accessdate=28 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current CEO is Zac Carman.

==History==

The company was founded in 1998 by Jim Hood, an Associate Press executive, editor and reporter, as an easier way of collecting consumer opinions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=WALTON|first1=ROD|title=5 Questions: Zac Carman of ConsumerAffairs|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/business/5questions/questions-zac-carman-of-consumeraffairs/article_d180edba-254a-5b65-83fb-3093709e1afc.html|publisher=[[Tulsa World]]|accessdate=28 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the company was purchased by Zac Carman as an "opportunity to turn customer complaints into an opportunity for brands."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Newlands |first1=Murray |title=Authenticity Is Key For Online Reviews |url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/mnewlands/2015/10/13/authenticity-is-key-for-online-reviews/ |publisher=[[Forbes]] |accessdate=28 May 2016 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151031154535/http://www.forbes.com/sites/mnewlands/2015/10/13/authenticity-is-key-for-online-reviews/ |archivedate=October 31, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They moved to Tulsa, OK in 2010.&lt;ref name=newson6&gt;{{cite web|title=New Tenant Renovates Part Of Tulsa's Petroleum Club Building|url=http://www.newson6.com/story/29616080/tulsa-company-expanding-its-presence-in-downtown-building|publisher=[[News on 6 Now]]|accessdate=28 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the company had a $1.1 million renovation of the [[Petroleum Building]] in the [[Oil Capital Historic District]]. The renovation was to increase their employee base from 120 to 220.&lt;ref name=newson6 /&gt;

==Criticism==

In October 21, 2014, [[Truth in Advertising (organization)|Truth in Advertising]] published "Who is ConsumerAffairs.com Really Advocating For?" In the article, Unbeatablesale.com complained to the [[Electronic retailing self-regulation program|Electronic Retailing Self-Regulation Program]], a division of the [[Better Business Bureaus]] and [[National Advertising Review Council]], that ConsumerAffairs "creates biased and negative portrayals of companies that don't pay for its service called ConsumerAffairs for Brands." The service collects reviews from customers and gives brands an opportunity to respond. The ERSP "determined that ConsumerAffairs did not adequately disclose its paid affiliation with company members on its website and recommended it do it in a more clear and conspicuous manner." After reviewing ERSP's recommendations, a banner disclosing paid affiliation or non-paying affiliation was added to the ConsumerAffairs website. ConsumerAffairs reported that, of the 115 paying companies, 80% of paying companies received a 3.5 star or higher rating and 20% of paying companies received a rating lower than 3.5 stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WHO IS CONSUMERAFFAIRS.COM REALLY ADVOCATING FOR?|url=https://www.truthinadvertising.org/consumer-affairs-com/|publisher=[[Truth in Advertising (organization)|Truth in Advertising]]|accessdate=28 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criminal investigation==
In May 2006, following an interrogation, Dinu Patriciu was arrested for 24 hours, being accused of [[tax evasion]], [[money laundering]] and [[fraud]].&lt;ref name="Cotidianul"&gt;{{cite news

The Directorate for the Investigation of Organised Crime and Terrorism (DIICOT) sent the case to court, being accused of seven felonies: [[embezzlement]], [[money laundering]], [[Conspiracy (criminal)|conspiracy]], [[market manipulation]], [[Insider trading|disclosure of privileged information]] and initiation or establishment of an organised crime ring.&lt;ref name="Agerpress"&gt;{{cite news

In 2007, President [[Traian Băsescu]] accused the then-Prime Minister [[Călin Popescu-Tăriceanu]] of sending him a note in 2005 asking to influence the political investigations of Dinu Patriciu, an ally of Popescu-Tăriceanu.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news

Patriciu and the other defendants were acquitted in 2012 during the first trial, in a verdict that was later overturned following an appeal of the prosecutors.&lt;ref name="Agerpress"/&gt; The Court of Appeals sentenced in 2014 several of his associates to prison, including PNL Senator [[Sorin Roșca Stănescu]] and Alexandru Bucșa, a former vice-president of Rompetrol Netherlands.&lt;ref name="Agerpress"/&gt;

While the criminal case against Patriciu was ended due to his death, the civil case continues.&lt;ref name="Agerpress"/&gt;

==Illness and death==

Patriciu was diagnosed with [[cirrhosis]] and he underwent a [[liver transplant]] in [[Milan]] in 2012. He was later diagnosed with [[lymphoma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

'''Encompass''', the '''Enterprise Computing Association''', was the original [[computer user group]] for business customers of [[Hewlett-Packard]]. Encompass's history begins with [[DECUS]], founded in 1961, for customers of the [[Digital Equipment Corporation]], which was acquired in 1998 by [[Compaq]].
The [[United States|U.S.]] Chapter incorporated as the user group Encompass U.S.

[[Hewlett-Packard]] acquired [[Compaq]] in 2002. Encompass continued as an HP user group, aimed at business customers of all of HP's hardware, software, and services.

The Encompass mission was to promote technical information exchange among its members and between the members and [[Hewlett-Packard]].

The Connect User Group Community, formed from the consolidation in May 2008 of Encompass, [[HP-Interex|Interex EMEA]], and [[ITUG]] is [[Hewlett-Packard]]'s largest user community representing more than 50,000 participants. See [[Connect (users group)]] for more information.

The Encompass Board at the time of the consolidation consisted of Nina Buik, Kristi Browder, Glen Kuykendall, Anthony Ioele, Steve Davidek, Dena Wright, John Maynen, Clyde Poole, and Bill Johnson.  Two former directors were credited with being instrumental in facilitating the consolidation, Chris Koppe and Jim Becker.

==Mission==
Encompass partnered with first [[Compaq]] and then [[Hewlett-Packard]] on national technical conferences (in the U.S.):
* CETS 2001 (Compaq Enterprise Technical Symposium): September 10–14, 2001, [[Anaheim, California]]
* HP-ETS 2002 (HP Enterprise Technical Symposium): October 7–11, [[St. Louis, Missouri]]
* HP World 2003: August 11–15, 2003, [[Atlanta, Georgia]], in partnership with [[HP-Interex|Interex]] as well as HP
* HP World 2004: August 16–20, 2004, [[Chicago, Illinois]], in partnership with Interex and HP
* HP Technology Forum 2005: October 17–20, 2005, [[Orlando, Florida]], in partnership with the user group [[OpenView Forum International]] as well as HP
* HP Technology Forum 2006: September 17–21, 2006, [[Houston, Texas]], in partnership with HP, [[ITUG]], and [[OpenView Forum International]]
* HP Technology Forum &amp; Expo 2007: June 17–21, 2007, [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]], in partnership with HP and ITUG

Encompass also had a number of Local User Groups (LUGs) throughout the U.S., and [[Special Interest Group]]s (SIGs) on various topics.

Encompass also ran [[webcast]]s, local seminars, and other programs.

Encompass manages the pre-conference seminar program and trade show at the HP Technology Forum &amp; Expo.

Non-U.S. Encompass organizations include:
*Encompass [[Canada]]
*Encompass [[New Zealand]]
*Encompass [[Australia]]

'''Françoise Bettencourt Meyers''' ({{IPA-fr|fʁɑ̃swaːz bɛtɑ̃kuːʁ mɛjɛʁ}}) is a French [[billionaire]] heiress and author of [[Jewish commentaries on the Bible|Bible commentaries]] and works on [[Jewish-Christian relations]].&lt;ref name="lesechos"&gt;[http://www.lesechos.fr/info/analyses/020263653804.htm ''Les Échos''], December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The only daughter and thus under French law the heiress of [[Liliane Bettencourt]], her family owns the company [[L'Oréal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.loreal-finance.com/eng/share-ownership|title=L'Oréal Finance : Share Ownership|website=www.loreal-finance.com|accessdate=21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She married Jean-Pierre Meyers, the grandson of a [[rabbi]] murdered at [[Auschwitz]]. After marriage, Meyers decided to raise her children as Jewish.&lt;ref name="lesechos" /&gt; Her marriage caused controversy as a result of her grandfather, [[Eugène Schueller]]'s, trial for collaboration with the [[Nazi]] government.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/09/liliane-bettencourt-profile ''The Guardian''], July 10, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, she sued [[François-Marie Banier]] for taking money from her "unstable" mother,&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt; and started proceedings to have her mother declared mentally incompetent. The revelations in the secret recordings she used in evidence, were at the origin of the [[Bettencourt affair|Woerth-Bettencourt scandal]]. In December 2010, Bettencourt-Meyers announced that she had settled out of court with both her mother and Banier.&lt;ref name="latribune"&gt;

Her mother died in September 2017 at a time when her mother's net worth was about $39.5 billion, which makes  Francoise Bettencourt Meyers among the top 20 richest people in the world overall and the [[List of female billionaires|richest woman in the world]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://time.com/money/4746795/richest-people-in-the-world/|title=The Richest People in the World|website=Money}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hasib Sabbagh''' ({{lang-ar|حسيب الصباغ}}), (also spelled '''Hassib''') (1920 – 12 January 2010) was a [[Palestinians|Palestinian]] businessman, activist, and philanthropist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=News|first1=Bloomberg|title=Hasib Sabbagh, 90, Middle East construction firm owner, dies|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/14/AR2010011404526.html|website=The Washington Post|date=15 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life and education ==
Sabbagh came from a [[Palestinian Christian]] family in [[Safed]] in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], although he was born in [[Tiberias]]. He graduated from the [[Arab College of Jerusalem]] in 1938, and in 1941 gained a civil engineering degree from the [[American University of Beirut]].

Sabbagh attended the Government Arab College of Jerusalem, which only the top public school students in Palestine attended. It was headed by Ahmad Samih al-Khalidi and staffed by some of the finest teachers in the Arab world. It was a boarding school with regimental discipline, where the highest standards were set for the students. They were expected to study night and day, and were allowed only one day off for sports and other recreation. It was there that he established some of the friendships that have lasted to this day.

In 1938 Sabbagh enrolled at the American University of Beirut, as a sophomore, in the college of engineering; attending AUB was to be one of the more significant experiences of his life. Not only was he being trained for his future profession, but he was also exposed to a rich and varied political life. AUB students came from throughout the Arab world, and represented many political currents: there were the Syrian nationalists, followers of [[Antun Sa'adeh]], the communists led by Khalid Bikdash, the Arab nationalists whose ideologue was Professor Constantine Zureik of AUB, and the Arab Ba‘thists who adhered to Michel ‘Aflaq’s ideas.

Sabbagh died on 12 January 2010 after a long illness.

== Work as an Activist and Mediator ==
In 1970, Sabbagh met [[Yasser Arafat]], chairman of the PLO, at the house of a mutual friend, Abdul Majid Shoman, in Beirut. Since that time, he developed a close relationship with Arafat and other members of the PLO leadership. Sabbagh, Basel Aql, and Walid Khalidi became intermediaries between the PLO and the Lebanese government, trying to inform and explain the complexity of Lebanese confessional politics to Arafat and his colleagues and interceding on behalf of Palestinian refugees with the Lebanese authorities. It was the Lebanese civil war, however, that made Sabbagh an activist &amp;mdash; an activist for peace and reconciliation between the various Lebanese parties and between the Palestinians and the Lebanese.

Sabbagh recognized the danger of the situation in Lebanon when, in April 1975, twenty-six Palestinians were shot to death by Phalangist forces in ‘Ayn al-Rumanah, in retaliation for the assassination of two of their bodyguards. The next day, he met with Abu Iyad, the PLO’s second in command, at [[Walid Khalidi]]’s house. The Palestinian leadership had also understood the potential threat to Lebanese &amp;mdash; Palestinian relations this incident portended. Abu Iyad asked Sabbagh to convince the Maronite patriarch, Antonius Butrus Khraysh, to condemn the killing publicly in order to preempt a further deterioration of the situation. Sabbagh, accompanied by a member of the Phalangist party, visited the patriarch, who agreed to make a statement on the radio that same evening condemning the killings. Sabbagh also asked the patriarch to invite both Pierre Gemayel, the leader of the Phalangist party, and Arafat for lunch at the patriarchate to effect a reconciliation between them and their communities. The invitation was accepted by Gemayel, but Arafat declined, saying that it was too soon after the ‘Ayn al-Rumanah killings to meet with Gemayel. Sabbagh strongly believed that had that meeting occurred between the two leaders at the onset of the conflict, it may have prevented much of the bloodshed and disaster that took place in the following days, months, and even years. Sabbagh was involved in many other efforts to bring leaders of the various factions together in order to resolve conflicts or prevent their escalation.
 
Throughout the war, Sabbagh acted as intermediary and mediator, trying to find solutions to the conflict that was destroying the country. He passed messages from the PLO to the United States administration and back to the PLO (although he was not the only channel that Arafat used to communicate with the United States). In 1982, after the Israeli invasion of Lebanon, Sabbagh accompanied by Munib al-Masri and Abdul Majid Shoman, went to Saudi Arabia to ask King Khalid to intercede with the United States in an effort to stop Israel’s bombing of Beirut, to allow the PLO to leave the city. When the bombing stopped, Sabbagh was instrumental in passing information from the PLO to the United States about the PLO’s conditions for its peaceful departure from Beirut.

A longtime member of both the [[Palestine National Council]] and of its central council, Sabbagh provided crucial international contacts for Arafat during the 1970s and 1980s. Most controversially, his 1978 meeting with the Phalange, first agreed to and then denounced by Arafat, provoked condemnation from the Lebanese and Syrian governments as well as from Palestinian opposition groups. In 1988, his active support encouraged Arafat to steer the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] firmly toward a renewed peace initiative.

== Consolidated Contractors Company ==
In 1943, with four other contractors, he established the [[Consolidated Contractors Company]] (CCC) in Haifa. Sabbagh left Palestine in April 1948 and moved to [[Lebanon]]. CCC was reestablished there in 1950, becoming the region's largest multinational and one of the largest contractors worldwide. Sabbagh was a billionaire and ranked 16th on the world's richest Arabs.{{when|date=May 2010}}

== Philanthropy ==
Through the [[Diana Sabbagh Foundation]], one of the largest Arab charitable foundations, Sabbagh has supported institutions of higher education across the Arab world and the West, and has influenced a range of dialogue initiatives, notably in the [[United States]] at the Council on Foreign Relations, the [[Carter Center]], and the Center for Muslim - Christian Encounter, and in Palestine within the Palestinian Initiative for the Promotion of Global Dialogue and Democracy (MIFTAH), under [[Hanan Ashrawi]]. He also co-founded the Welfare Association for Palestinians, chaired the Palestinian Students Fund, and has been on the boards of the Arab Bank and of many academic institutions and pro-Palestinian think tanks, such as the [[Institute of Palestine Studies]].

==Pre-20th century==

[[File:NinoHeroe.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Mexico honors [[Niños Héroes|its cadets]] who died in the Battle of Chapultepec (1847).]]

Throughout history and in many cultures, children have been extensively involved in military campaigns.&lt;ref name="Wessells" /&gt;

The earliest mentions of minors being involved in wars come from antiquity. It was customary for youths in the Mediterranean basin to serve as aides, charioteers and armor bearers to adult warriors. Examples of this practice can be found in the Bible, such as David's service to King Saul, in Hittite and ancient Egyptian art, and in ancient Greek [[Greek mythology|mythology]] (such as the story of Hercules and Hylas), philosophy and literature.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} In a practice dating back to antiquity, children were routinely taken on a campaign, together with the rest of a military man's family, as part of the baggage.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

The Roman Empire made use of youths in war, though it was understood that it was unwise and cruel to use children in war, and Plutarch implies that regulations required youths to be at least sixteen years of age.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} Despite this, several Roman [[Legionary|legionaries]] were known to have enlisted aged 14 in the [[Imperial Roman army]], such as Quintus Postunius Solus who completed 21 years of service in [[Legio XX Valeria Victrix]], and Caecilius Donatus who served 26 years in the Legio XX and died shortly before his honorable discharge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cowan |first=Ross |authorlink=Ross Cowan |ref=harv |title=Roman Legionary AD 69–161 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QKudCwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=de#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |date=2013 |publisher=[[Osprey Publishing]] |location=[[Oxford]] |isbn=978-1780965871 |page=12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In medieval Europe young boys from about twelve years of age were used as military aides ("[[squires]]"), though in theory their role in actual combat was limited. The so-called [[Children's Crusade]] in 1212 recruited thousands of children as untrained soldiers under the assumption that divine power would enable them to conquer the enemy, although none of the children entered combat. According to the legend, they were instead sold into slavery. While most scholars no longer believe that the Children's Crusade consisted solely, or even mostly, of children, it nonetheless exemplifies an era in which entire families took part in a war effort.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Young boys often took part in battles during early modern warfare. When Napoleon was faced with invasion by a massive Allied force in 1814 he conscripted many teenagers for his armies. Orphans of the Imperial Guard fought in the Netherlands with Marshal MacDonald and were between the ages of 14 and 17.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Leggiere, The Fall of Napoleon: The Allied Invasion of France 1813–1814, pg.99–100&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the conscripts who reported to the ranks in 1814 were referred to as Marie Louises after the Empress Marie Louise of France; they were also known as "The Infants of the Emperor". These soldiers were in their mid-teens.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Pope, Dictionary of the Napoleonic Wars, p. 318&lt;/ref&gt; One of their more visible roles was as the ubiquitous "[[Drummer boy (military)|drummer boy]]".

During the age of sail, young boys formed part of the crew of British Royal Navy ships and were responsible for many essential tasks including bringing powder and shot from the [[Magazine (artillery)#Naval magazines|ship's magazine]] to the gun crews. These children were called "powder monkeys."{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

[[File:Child soldier in the US Civil War.jpg|thumb|upright|Drummer boy [[John Clem]] during the American Civil War.]]

During the American Civil War a young boy, Bugler John Cook, served in the US Army at the age of 15 and received the Medal of Honor for his acts during the Battle of Antietam, the bloodiest day in American history.&lt;ref&gt;Slinger, P. W. Children at War.

By a law signed by Nicholas I of Russia in 1827 a disproportionate number of Jewish boys, known as the [[cantonist]]s, were forced into military training establishments to serve in the army. The 25-year conscription term officially commenced at the age of 18, but boys as young as eight were routinely taken to fulfill the quota. {{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

During the Boshin War, the pro-''shōgun'' Aizu Domain formed the {{nihongo|''[[Byakkotai]]''|白虎隊|extra="[[White Tiger (Chinese constellation)|White Tiger]] Force"}}, which was made up of the 16 to 17-year-old sons of Aizu samurai. During the Battle of Bonari Pass and the Battle of Aizu they fought the Satcho forces who supported the Imperial cause. A detached unit of Byakkotai was cut off from the rest of the unit and retreated to Iimori Hill, which overlooked Aizu-Wakamatsu Castle. From there, they saw what they thought was the castle on fire. 20 of the detached unit committed ''seppuku'' while [[Iinuma Sadakichi|one was unsuccessful]]. He was saved by a local peasant.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

In the West, boys [[Youngest British soldier in World War I|as young as 12]] were caught up in the overwhelming tide of patriotism and in huge numbers enlisted for active service. Others enlisted to avoid harsh and dreary lives. Typically many were able to pass themselves off as older men, such as George Thomas Paget, who at 17 joined a [[Bantam (military)|Bantam]] battalion in the Welsh Regiment. The last surviving combat veteran of the War was [[Claude Choules]], who enlisted in the [[Royal Navy]] at age 14 and saw his first action at the Battle of Jutland at 15.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} In the Gallipoli campaign, otherwise known as "Çanakkale", children as young as 15 fought in the trenches. 120 children fought in the "15'liler" or "The 15s" company, with no known survivors.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

==Spanish Civil War==
Many child soldiers fought in the Spanish Civil War:
{{quote|The centuria was an untrained mob composed mostly of boys in their teens. Here and there in the militia you came across children as young as eleven or twelve, usually refugees from Fascist territory who had been enlisted as militiamen as the easiest way of providing for them. As a rule, they were employed on light work in the rear, but sometimes they managed to worm their way to the front line, where they were a public menace. I remember one little brute throwing a hand-grenade into the dug-out fire 'for a joke'. At Monte Pocero I do not think there was anyone younger than fifteen, but the average age must have been well under twenty. Boys of this age ought never to be used in the front line, because they cannot stand the lack of sleep which is inseparable from trench warfare. At the beginning it was almost impossible to keep our position properly guarded at night. The wretched children of my section could only be roused by dragging them out of their dug-outs feet foremost, and as soon as your back was turned they left their posts and slipped into shelter; or they would even, in spite of the frightful cold, lean up against the wall of the trench and fall fast asleep.|||George Orwell&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=George |last=Orwell |title=Homage to Catalonia {{!}} Chapter 3 |url=http://www.george-orwell.org/Homage_to_Catalonia/2.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318152354/http://www.george-orwell.org/Homage_to_Catalonia/2.html |archivedate=18 March 2015 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{main|Military use of children in World War II}}

In [[World War II]] children under the age of 18 were widely used by all sides in formal and informal military roles. Children were readily indoctrinated into the prevailing ideology of the warring parties, quickly trained, and often sent to the front line; many were wounded or killed. The lack of a legal definition of a child, combined with the absence of a system for verifying the ages of prospective child recruits, contributed to the extensive use of children in the war.

During the [[Algerian Civil War|Algerian civil war]] (1991–2002) children were recruited frequently by [[Islamism|Islamist]] armed groups fighting the government.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.child-soldiers.org/Handlers/Download.ashx?IDMF=adc88bff-1916-4317-b184-d9079e7b0bb8|title=Global Report on Child Soldiers|last=Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers|first=|date=2001|website=child-soldiers.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; A government-allied militia—the Legitimate Defence Groups (LDG)—also used children, according to some reports.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.child-soldiers.org/Handlers/Download.ashx?IDMF=c5f157d3-4b56-457c-a2d8-31601ffc1b9e|title=Child Soldiers Global Report 2004|last=Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers|first=|date=2004|website=child-soldiers.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the rules for joining the LDG were the same as the army, in which only adults were recruited (by [[conscription]]) the LDG applied no safeguards to ensure that children could not join up.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The extent of child recruitment during the war remains unknown.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

By 2006, a [[Disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration|reintegration program]] organized by [[UNICEF]] had led to the release of 3,000 children from the military and armed groups.&lt;ref name=":37" /&gt; According to Child Soldiers International:&lt;blockquote&gt;The majority of those [children] who took part in the program returned to farm and fish in their local communities, but nearly 600 returned to school.

Between 2007 and 2012, children were used extensively by the Chadian military as participants in armed conflict.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://childsoldiersworldindex.org/view/TD|title=Child Soldiers World Index: Chad|last=Child Soldiers International|first=|date=2018|website=childsoldiersworldindex.org|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330013128/http://childsoldiersworldindex.org/view/TD|archive-date=30 March 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=2018-03-29|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were also integrated into various rebel forces, including the [[United Front for Democratic Change]] (''Front Uni pour le Changement'', FUC), local self-defense forces known as ''Tora Boro'' militias, and two Sudanese rebel movements operating in Chad: the [[Justice and Equality Movement]] (JEM) and the G-19 faction of the Sudanese Liberation Army (SLA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hrw.org/reports/2007/chad0107/|title=They Came Here to Kill Us|date=January 2007|publisher=Human Rights Watch|access-date=29 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170328114459/https://www.hrw.org/reports/2007/chad0107//|archive-date=28 March 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hrw.org/reports/2007/chad0707/|title=Early To War|date=July 2007|publisher=Human Rights Watch|access-date=29 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016121224/https://www.hrw.org/reports/2007/chad0707/|archive-date=16 October 2015|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the government signed an action plan with the United Nations, children were released from service and were no longer recruited. By 2014, Chad had been removed from the UN list of countries that use child soldiers in war.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Côte d'Ivoire ====
During [[First Ivorian Civil War|Côte d’Ivoire’s civil war]] of 2002–2004, "children were recruited, often forcibly, by both sides",&lt;ref name="CSUCS-1"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20091226221427/http://www.child-soldiers.org/document/get?id=743 Child soldiers global report 2004: Africa Regional overview], [http://www.child-soldiers.org/contact/contact Child Soldiers International] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20070703045854/http://www.child-soldiers.org/contact/contact|date=3 July 2007}}.&lt;!--Retrieved April 2009--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and were also abducted by armed groups fighting the civil war in Liberia between 1999 and 2003.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The ''Patriotic Youth –'' armed groups that included children in large numbers – received the active support of the government.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Thousands of children saw membership of an armed group on either side of the war as a way to earn a living,&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.child-soldiers.org/Handlers/Download.ashx?IDMF=26c0549d-aa35-4f1a-8e34-5956f8e2ec51|title=Child Soldiers Global Report 2008|last=Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers|first=|date=2008|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; although they were often unpaid, having to acquire money through extortion or begging.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; They were provided with automatic weapons, and girls were frequently abducted as sex slaves.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Attempts to reach a peace agreement repeatedly failed, and although after 2006 children were gradually released from military groups, approximately 2,000 children remained.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; After President [[Laurent Gbagbo]] refused to recognise the 2010 election result, fighting flared up again and child recruitment increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/2013/245&amp;Lang=E&amp;Area=UNDOC|title=Report of the Secretary-General: Children and armed conflict (2013)|last=UN General Assembly|first=|date=2013|website=www.un.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the new government, however, the UN brokered an Action Plan that included the release of all children and, in 2015, the UN reported that children were no longer recruited in the country.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/2015/409&amp;Lang=E&amp;Area=UNDOC|title=Report of the Secretary-General: Children and armed conflict|last=UN General Assembly|first=|date=2015|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Eritrea ====
During its [[Eritrean War of Independence|30-year war for independence with Ethiopia]] (1961–1991) the [[Eritrean People's Liberation Front|Eritrean People’s Liberation Front]] was "widely acknowledged" to have used children extensively as soldiers, according to the Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers (now [[Child Soldiers International]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.child-soldiers.org/shop/global-report-2001|title=Child Soldiers Global Report: 2001|last=Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers|first=|date=2001|website=|page=162|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180402040002/https://www.child-soldiers.org/shop/global-report-2001|archive-date=2 April 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=2018-05-24|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Once independence had been won, the Eritrean armed forces recruited and used children again during the [[Eritrean–Ethiopian War|two-year border war]] with Ethiopia in 1998.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; There were many reports of child recruitment and use (including conscription from age 15)&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;, but there is little information today about the extent of the practice, which is due in part to the absence of effective birth registration and age-verification system at the time.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The UN reported in 2002 that children were no longer being used systematically by the Eritrean armed forces,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.un.org/en/story/2002/03/30852-un-envoy-reports-no-evidence-child-soldiering-ethiopia-and-eritrea|title=UN envoy reports no evidence of ‘child soldiering’ in Ethiopia and Eritrea|last=|first=|date=2002-03-26|work=UN News|access-date=2018-05-24|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180708074728/https://news.un.org/en/story/2002/03/30852-un-envoy-reports-no-evidence-child-soldiering-ethiopia-and-eritrea|archive-date=8 July 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the government acceded to the Optional Protocol on the involvement of children in armed conflict in 2005. Child recruitment continued, however; Human Rights Concern Eritrea reported in 2013 that all schoolchildren in 11&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; grade (approx. age 16) were made to spend the year at a military training camp, after which they were routinely recruited into the armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hrc-eritrea.org/report-on-child-rights-violations-in-eritrea/|title=Report on Child Rights Violations in Eritrea|last=Human Rights Concern Eritrea|first=|date=19 November 2013|website=hrc-eritrea.org|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180718154539/http://hrc-eritrea.org/report-on-child-rights-violations-in-eritrea/|archive-date=18 July 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=2018-05-24|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ethiopia ====
According to the [[Child Soldiers International|Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers]] in 2001 there were "credible reports" that the Ethiopian armed forces used thousands of children in its [[Eritrean–Ethiopian War|two-year border war]] with Eritrea between 1998 and 2000:&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.child-soldiers.org/shop/global-report-2001|title=Child Soldiers Global Report: 2001|last=Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers|first=|date=2001|website=|page=165|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180402040002/https://www.child-soldiers.org/shop/global-report-2001|archive-date=2 April 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=2018-05-24|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Testimonies of former child soldiers, NGOs and journalists provide evidence of child deployment on the [[Front line|front lines]] and in [[Human wave attack|massive waves]] across mine fields... Recruitment reportedly focused on Oromos and Somalis... and on grades 9 to 12 of secondary schools.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Children were also forcibly recruited in groups from public places.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The lack of a functioning birth registration system has made it difficult to estimate the number of children affected, but it is clear that the use of children was widespread; for example, most Ethiopian prisoners of war in one large [[prisoner of war]] camp in Eritrea were estimated to be aged 14–18.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The main opposition group in the 1990s, the [[Oromo Liberation Front]], also systematically recruited children, including by force.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In 2008 it was reported that children were no longer used for military purposes in Ethiopia,&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; and in 2014 the government ratified the Optional Protocol on the involvement of children in armed conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://childsoldiersworldindex.org/view/ET|title=Child Soldiers World Index: Ethiopia|last=Child Soldiers International|first=|date=2017|website=childsoldiersworldindex.org|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180525062600/http://childsoldiersworldindex.org/view/ET|archive-date=25 May 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=2018-05-24|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Liberia’s civil wars (1989–1995, 1999–2003) all factions abducted children for direct combat, forced labour, and sexual slavery.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; It was the common practice of commanders to give children drugs and threaten them with execution in order to enhance their obedience; for example, soldiers were frequently given [[Diazepam|valium]] before a battle, known as "bubbles" or "10-10".&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lexisnexis.com/hottopics/lnacademic/?verb=sr&amp;csi=5774&amp;sr=HEADLINE(Boy+soldiers)%2BAND%2BDATE%2BIS%2B1995|title=Boy Soldiers|last=Frankel|first=Mark|date=14 August 1995|work=Newsweek|access-date=19 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180220033458/http://www.lexisnexis.com/hottopics/lnacademic/?verb=sr&amp;csi=5774&amp;sr=HEADLINE(Boy+soldiers)%2BAND%2BDATE%2BIS%2B1995|archive-date=20 February 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children were often persuaded or forced to commit grave human rights violations against civilians, including rape, torture, and the abduction of other children for military use.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Children as young as 10 were used in direct combat.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

United Nations [[Rehabilitation and reintegration of child soldiers|disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration]] programs repeatedly failed when children quitted them, often to return to their former military unit, and after fighters rioted in protest at the absence of a financial reward for being disarmed.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; A chronic lack of resources for reintegration also prompted child soldiers to enrol in other armed groups as a means of gainful employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Children and families affected by armed conflicts in Africa|last=Corbin|first=Joanne|publisher=NASW Press|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2004 more than 20,000 children needed to be demobilised and reunited with their communities.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; However, by October 2004 10,000 children had been released from their military units and were part of reintegration programs.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; 

By 2006 children were no longer being used by any military groups in the country, although armed groups from Côte d'Ivoire and Guinea continued to abduct Liberian children.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; {{As of|2018}}, children were no longer being used for military purposes in Liberia, and its armed forces were recruiting only adults over the age of 18.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://childsoldiersworldindex.org/view/SL|title=Child Soldiers World Index: Sierra Leone|last=Child Soldiers International|first=|date=2018|website=childsoldiersworldindex.org|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180517010103/http://childsoldiersworldindex.org/view/SL|archive-date=17 May 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=2018-05-16|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An estimated 20,000 children took part in hostilities during the 1990s, including the 1994 [[Rwandan genocide|Rwanda genocide]] when many children were involved in committing atrocities.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; 5,000 children were in the national army,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; while others, including many street children, joined or were made to join armed groups.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; After the genocide, 4,500 children were detained on suspicion of participating in atrocities, and were incarcerated for several years without charge or trial;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; some were sent to the Gitagata Re-Education Centre for males below 14 years of age.&lt;ref name=":101"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/The%20Use%20of%20Children%20as%20Soldiers%20in%20Africa%20report.pdf|title=The Use of Children as Soldiers in Africa report|last=Jaffré|first=Françoise|date=21 January 2015|website=ReliefWeb|access-date=18 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180220092236/https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/The%20Use%20of%20Children%20as%20Soldiers%20in%20Africa%20report.pdf|archive-date=20 February 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1990s, children were widely recruited again, often by force, to fight in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).&lt;ref name="CSUCS-12"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20091226221427/http://www.child-soldiers.org/document/get?id=743 Child soldiers global report 2004: Africa Regional overview], [http://www.child-soldiers.org/contact/contact Child Soldiers International] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20070703045854/http://www.child-soldiers.org/contact/contact|date=3 July 2007}}.&lt;!--Retrieved April 2009--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Initial demobilisation and reintegration programmes failed after many schools banned former child soldiers&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; and a high rate of unemployment rendered them vulnerable to re-recruitment by militia groups.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In 2003, as the Rwandan military presence in the DRC reduced, so did the demand for child soldiers.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The government introduced new legislation to raise the minimum enlistment age 18 and the armed forces stopped recruiting children.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Nonetheless, armed groups continued to do so, albeit to a reduced extent, for their operations in the DRC.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

====Sierra Leone====
{{Main|Child soldiers in Sierra Leone}}
During the [[Sierra Leone Civil War]] (1991–2002) thousands of children were recruited by government armed forces and non-government armed groups, particularly the anti-government [[Revolutionary United Front]] (RUF) and the [[Armed Forces Revolutionary Council]] (AFRC), and the pro-government [[Civil Defence Forces]] (CDF).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2012/04/11/armed-conflict-sierra-leone|title=The Armed Conflict in Sierra Leone|last=Human Rights Watch|first=|date=2012-04-11|work=|access-date=2018-05-16|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171022164329/https://www.hrw.org/news/2012/04/11/armed-conflict-sierra-leone|archive-date=22 October 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children were often forcibly recruited, given drugs and used to commit atrocities.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Thousands of girls were also recruited as soldiers and often subjected to sexual exploitation. Many of the children were survivors of attacks on villages, which were routinely ordered to hand over their children to armed groups.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; By 2001, an estimated 10,000 children were being used for military purposes by government armed forces and various armed groups, particularly the RUF.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

After 2002, when the war was declared over, an extensive United Nations [[Rehabilitation and reintegration of child soldiers|disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration]] programme reunited most former child soldiers with their communities, although it drew criticism for neglecting the needs of women and girls.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

In June 2007 the [[Special Court for Sierra Leone]] found three men from the rebel Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC) guilty of war crimes, crimes against humanity, and other serious violations of international humanitarian law, including the recruitment of children under the age of 15 years into the armed forces. With this the Special Court became the first ever UN-backed tribunal to secure a conviction for the military conscription of children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sc-sl.org/Press/pressrelease-062007.pdf|title="Guilty Verdicts in the Trial of the AFRC Accused"|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029201800/http://www.sc-sl.org/Press/pressrelease-062007.pdf|archivedate=29 October 2008|deadurl=yes|df=}}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(104&amp;nbsp;KB)}}, press release from the Special Court for Sierra Leone, 20 June 2007; [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/20/AR2007062000952.html?hpid=moreheadlines "Sierra Leone Convicts 3 of War Crimes"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181003183441/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/20/AR2007062000952.html?hpid=moreheadlines |date=3 October 2018 }}, ''[[Associated Press]]'', 20 June 2007 (hosted by ''[[The Washington Post]]''); {{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6221112.stm|title=First S Leone war crimes verdicts|date=20 June 2007|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=21 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151122151146/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6221112.stm|archive-date=22 November 2015|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Salvadoran Civil War|civil war between 1980 and 1992]] the Salvadoran military and the main opposition group, the ''[[Frente Farabundo Martí de Liberación Nacional|Frente Farabundo Martí de Liberación National]]'' (FMLN)'','' recruited children extensively. The recruitment was frequently carried out by force and focused on economically suppressed regions.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; A fifth of the army’s personnel were aged under 18, as were a quarter of the FMLN.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.child-soldiers.org/shop/experiences-and-psychocial-impact-of-the-el-salvador-civil-war-on-child-soldiers|title=Experiences and psychocial impact of the El Salvador civil war on child soldiers|last=Santacruz|first=Maria|last2=Arana|first2=Rubi|date=2002|website=Child Soldiers International|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180522043014/https://www.child-soldiers.org/shop/experiences-and-psychocial-impact-of-the-el-salvador-civil-war-on-child-soldiers|archive-date=22 May 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=2018-05-21|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a group of 278 former FMLN child soldiers interviewed for a study, the average age of recruitment was 10 years.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; The large majority of child recruits on both sides were living in poverty, and had been largely deprived of formal education.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Many children who were not recruited by force joined of their own volition, mainly either to improve their circumstances or because they believed in the cause.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; 

After the civil war came to a close, [[Rehabilitation and reintegration of child soldiers|rehabilitation and reintegration programmes]] for children mostly failed; the majority of FMLN children were not involved in them, and the large majority of those who were dropped out of them.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; A decade after the peace accord former child soldiers were still experiencing nightmares, depression, anxiety, and related signs of psychiatric trauma.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

====  Cambodia ====
[[File:Khmer Rouge.JPG|thumb|Child dressed as ''[[Khmer Rouge]]'' soldier.]]
In the 1970s the ''[[Khmer Rouge]]'' exploited thousands of desensitised, conscripted children in their early teens to commit mass murder and other atrocities during the [[Cambodian Civil War|Cambodian civil war]] and [[Cambodian genocide|subsequent genocide]].&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rfa.org/english/features/blogs/cambodiablog/blog6_cambodia_southerland-20060720.html|title=Cambodia Diary 6: Child Soldiers — Driven by Fear and Hate|last=Southerland|first=D|date=2006-07-20|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180320105641/https://www.rfa.org/english/features/blogs/cambodiablog/blog6_cambodia_southerland-20060720.html|archive-date=20 March 2018|dead-url=no|accessdate=2018-03-28|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The indoctrinated children were taught to follow any order without hesitation.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; After it was deposed in 1979, the ''Khmer Rouge'' fought a [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla war]] against the new government, and until at least 1998 relied heavily on child recruits, including forced recruitment by abduction.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; During this period, the children were deployed mainly in unpaid support roles, such as ammunition-carriers, and also as combatants.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Cambodia's state armed forces also recruited children widely. Throughout the 1990s the army was recruiting children from the age of 10 and using them in armed conflict, mainly as porters and spies, and also as combatants.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Four percent of the army were children, according to an estimate in the ''[[The Cambodia Daily|Cambodia Daily]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.child-soldiers.org/Handlers/Download.ashx?IDMF=adc88bff-1916-4317-b184-d9079e7b0bb8|title=Cambodia Daily|last=|first=|date=2001|work=Cambodia Daily|access-date=2018-05-21|via=Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers: 'Child Soldiers Global Report: 2001'}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many children had fled the ''Khmer Rouge'' without a means to feed themselves and hoped that joining the government forces would enable them to survive, although local commanders frequently denied them any pay.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Children often capitalised on the lack of an effective birth registration system to lie about their age in order to enlist.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Other children, some as young as 8, were forced to join.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

By 2000, the Cambodian government had signed the [[Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict]] and its armed forces resolved to recruit adults only.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Meanwhile, the ''Khmer Rouge'' had collapsed with the death of its leader, [[Pol Pot]], in 1998.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; By 2004, children were no longer being recruited in the country, although the [[Rehabilitation and reintegration of child soldiers|demobilisation programmes]] were inadequate, according to [[UNICEF]], failing to offer appropriate rehabilitative support to released children.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

[[File:Sri lanka enfants soldats.jpg|thumb|Former child soldiers at a centre for rehabilitation and reintegration into their communities, Sri Lanka.]]
Between 1983 and 2009 Sri Lanka’s government fought a civil war with the [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam]] (Tamil Tigers). For its entire duration the Tamil Tigers and other armed groups made routine use of child recruits, typically aged 14–17 and sometimes under 10.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ZN"&gt;Bureau Report ''[http://www.zeenews.com/znnew/articles.asp?aid=331811&amp;sid=SAS LTTE rebels make child recruitment illegal: Report] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930205926/http://www.zeenews.com/znnew/articles.asp?aid=331811&amp;sid=SAS |date=30 September 2007 }}'', [[Zee News]] 27 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Some children enlisted to escape deprivation or racism, or during compulsory military training at their school when they were exposed to recruitment propaganda.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Others were recruited by force when walking home from school or after the Tigers pressurised families to surrender one child, as per its policy.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In 2001, international sources estimated that 40 percent of Tamil Tiger personnel were children, contrary to official statements insisting that the organisation did not use them.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Sri Lankan soldiers nicknamed one unit the "Baby Battalion", due to the number of children in it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928090515/http://www.lankaeverything.com/printnews.php?pid=20060918001845.php|title=Sri Lanka Tamil Tigers abduct teens to fight|last=LankaEverything.com|first=|date=2006-09-18|website=web.archive.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although state armed forces recruited only adults over the age of 18, they supported the [[Karuna group]], a Tamil splinter organisation opposed to the Tamil Tigers, to recruit children by force.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The government also used detained Tamil Tiger children for propaganda by exposing them to the media.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

The first international initiative to demobilise and reintegrate children into their communities began in 2003, but was halted in 2004 because the Tigers failed to keep their commitment to release children from their ranks.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The organisation began to release children in 2004, but continued to enlist several thousand, albeit in progressively smaller numbers, until at least 2007.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The Tamil Tigers were defeated in 2009 and all other parties to the conflict stopped recruiting children in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/2011/250&amp;Lang=E&amp;Area=UNDOC|title=Children and Armed Conflict: Annual Report of the Secretary-General, 2011|last=UN General Assembly|first=|date=2011|website=www.un.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180518200355/http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S%2F2011%2F250&amp;Lang=E&amp;Area=UNDOC|archive-date=18 May 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=2018-05-25|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plea agreement says Files and Lee Webb, a member of the [[Sebastian County, Arkansas|Sebastian County]] Election Commission, convinced the City of Fort Smith to appropriate $1.6 million for the project in 2014.

'''Jean-Michel Goudard''' is a French [[Public relations]] [[consultant]], who is the current [[Presudent]] and [[Chairman]] of the board of [[BBDO]] Paris. 

Goudard was born in [[Montpellier]], [[France]] on 13 November 1939. He graduated from [[HEC Business School]] in 1962, became a Navy Officer in 1964, and brand manager at [[Procter and Gamble]] in 1965, managing director of [[Young and Rubicam]]&lt;ref name="CoignardGuichard2000"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coignard|first1=Sophie|last2=Guichard|first2=Marie-Thérèse|title=French connections: networks of influence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GVyohk7knogC&amp;pg=PA110|accessdate=16 April 2011|year=2000|publisher=Algora Publishing|isbn=978-1-892941-02-2|page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; in France in 1970, he created with Bernard Roux, Jacques Seguela and Alain Cayzac the advertising agency [[RSCG]] (Roux Seguele Cayzac Goudard) which grew into an international network agency. Goudard is also a hobbyist bullfighter.
&lt;ref name=Campaignlive&gt;{{cite web|last=Hall|first=Emma|title=CLOSE-UP: NEWSMAKER/JEAN-MICHEL GOUDARD; Bon viveur poised to prove his worth in America|url=https://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/close-up-newsmaker-jean-michel-goudard-bon-viveur-poised-prove-worth-america/20822|work=Campaignlive|accessdate=July 21, 2018|date=1995-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with Bernard Brochand, he made the winning campaign of [[Jacques Chirac]] and his gaullist party RPR "Oui à la France qui gagne" in 1978. He did it again in 1986 with the campaign "Vivement Demain". The same year, he published his book "Je vous salue fiascos" (Jean-Claude Lattes) about his own fiascos in advertising. In 1988, Jacques Chirac, then Prime Minister, asked him to manage his presidential campaign against [[François Mitterrand]]. In 1991, he became the president of Euro-RSCG International, covering the whole worldwide network outside France. In 1995, he managed again the presidential campaign of Jacques Chirac ("La France pour tous"), and, immediately after the election of Jacques Chirac as President of France, he left Euro-RSCG and France to live in [[New York City]], for 10 years, as president of BBDO International. He retired in April 2006 to run the presidential campaign of [[Nicolas Sarkozy]], and became so close with the President that he even attended the G7 summit. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jean-Michel Goudard, the strategist.|url=https://www.lesechos.fr/15/04/2009/LesEchos/20405-050-ECH_jean-michel-goudard--le-stratege-.htm|accessdate=July 21, 2018|date=2009-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Immediately after Sarkozy's election, in 2007, he retired in [[Switzerland]] in [[Rolle]] (canton of [[Vaud]]). In 2008, President Sarkozy asked him to become his Chief Strategy Officer. Goudard accepted. He came back to France to work at the [[Elysée Palace]].

'''Jean-Paul Gut''', born on 1 July 1961, was executive director of marketing, strategy and international development at EADS. In 2007, he founded a consulting company, Coolmore International, based in London.

==Biography==
===Studies===
Jean Paul Gut graduated from the [[Institut d’Etudes Politiques de Paris]] with a master's degree in Economy.

==Matra==
Jean-Paul Gut’s career began in 1983 as Export Vice President for [[Matra]] Défense, part of the Matra Group.&lt;ref&gt;http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/people/person.asp?personId=8154790&amp;ticker=MMB:FP&amp;previousCapId=878300&amp;previousTitle=Lagardere%20SCA&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1988, he became the Export Marketing and Sales Executive Director. In 1990, he served as Executive Vice President of International Operations for Matra Défense Espace. Three years later, 1993, he advanced to the position of Senior Executive Vice President, in charge of international operations for the [[Lagardère Group]]. In 1996, he became the Senior Executive Vice President for Matra BAE Dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/people/person.asp?personId=8154790&amp;ticker=MMB:FP&amp;previousCapId=878300&amp;previousTitle=Lagardere%20SCA&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1998, Jean-Paul Gut joined the Board of Management of the Lagardère Group as Managing Director, in charge of international operations and State of the Art Technology Sector. He also became as a member of the executive management of EADS Company South Africa (Pty) Ltd. On May 11, 2005, Jean-Paul Gut served as the Director of [[Dassault]] Aviation SA, and as Executive Director of European Aeronautic Defence &amp; Space Co. N.V.&lt;ref&gt;http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/people/person.asp?personId=8154790&amp;ticker=MMB:FP&amp;previousCapId=878300&amp;previousTitle=Lagardere%20SCArdere%20SCA&lt;/ref&gt;

==EADS==
When EADS was created in 2000, he became a member of the board and member of the executive committee. In 2005, he was promoted to the position of executive director of EADS, and director of EADS International. 
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.finfacts.com/irelandbusinessnews/publish/printer_10002372.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;
In June 2006, when Jean-Louis Gergorin left EADS, he was assigned to be in charge of the company’s global strategy, thus becoming executive director of marketing and strategy, overseeing all international operations. A year later, in June 2007, he officially resigned from EADS. His severance pay is 2.8 million euros, the equivalent of a 24-month salary for 24 years worked at the company.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arabianbusiness.com/gut-ache-at-eads-as-jean-paul-quits-143624.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.forbes.com/2007/06/11/airbus-eads-gut-face-markets-cx_ll_0611autofacescan02.html&lt;/ref&gt; Right before he left EADS, he struck a 16 billion euro deal with Qatar Airways for the sale of 80 A350.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lefigaro.fr/temp/2007/05/31/04010-20070531ARTFIG90095-l_airbus_a_perennise_par_qatar_airways.php&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consulting Company==
Jean-Paul Gut created his own consulting company in London, catering to French and European companies looking to expand internationally, and connecting foreign investors with European corporations working on large-scale development projects. One of his main clients is Airbus, thus he remains an influential person within the company.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.intelligenceonline.com/networks-organizations/2007/12/13/lagardere-group-extends-its-reach,35774693-GRA&lt;/ref&gt;
Jean-Paul Gut, founder of the ARMAT GROUP&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jean-paul-gut.com/armat-group-2/&lt;/ref&gt; in 2008, is especially focusing on private equity, real estate and asset backed finance. Armat Group is designing innovative investment solutions with a difference that comes from its entrepreneurial background and its very international vision.
Some of the latest transactions arranged by Jean-Paul Gut and ARMAT Groupe for more details.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.armatgroup.com/an-asset-back-financing-transaction-in-real-estate-in-the-united-kingdom/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.armatgroup.com/a-private-equity-transaction-in-the-eyewear-manufacturing-business-in-china/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://le-daily.com/jean-paul-gut-mise-sur-la-start-up-harness/&lt;/ref&gt;

==The EADS case==
In June 2008, Jean-Paul Gut was indicted of insider trading when he was EADS’ executive director of marketing and strategy.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/06/18/AR2008061803173.html&lt;/ref&gt; The EADS case, which goes back to early 2006, arose after it was revealed that hundreds of EADS employees had sold their shares a few weeks before Airbus announced delivery delays of the A380, which caused Airbus to plummet in the stock market, losing 26% of its share price in one day.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.industryweek.com/regulations/eads-group-leaders-are-not-cheats-says-ceo&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Jean-Paul Gut had sold 175,000 shares for a 1,773,250 euros capital gain. Jean-Paul Gut denied the allegations.&lt;ref&gt;http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/economy/2007-06-11-582133944_x.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 17, 2009, the AMF (French financial authorities) firmly rejected all accusations of wrongdoings made towards Jean-Paul Gut and the other EADS executives implied in the EADS case.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thelocal.de/20131203/daimler-faces-eads-insider-trading-trial&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Johnny Hiromu Kitagawa'''|ジャニー喜多川|Janī Kitagawa|born {{Nihongo|John Hiromu Kitagawa|喜多川 擴|Kitagawa Hiromu}} on October 23, 1928}}, is a Japanese-American businessman and talent manager. He is the founder and president of [[Johnny &amp; Associates]], a production agency for numerous popular [[boy band]]s in Japan. Kitagawa assembled, produced and managed more than a dozen popular bands, including [[Tanokin Trio]], [[Hey! Say! JUMP]], [[SMAP]], [[Arashi]], [[Kanjani8]], [[V6 (band)|V6]], [[News (band)|NEWS]] and [[KAT-TUN]]. Kitagawa's influence has spread beyond music to the realms of theatre and television. Regarded as one of the most powerful figures in the Japanese entertainment industry, he has held a virtual monopoly on the creation of boy bands in Japan for more than 40 years.&lt;ref name = "Jpop" /&gt;

From 1988 to 2000, Kitagawa was the subject of a number of claims that he had taken advantage of his position to engage in improper sexual relationships with boys under contract to his talent agency. Kitagawa denied these claims, and in 2002 was awarded an 8.8 million [[Japanese yen|yen]] judgment against the magazine that had published such allegations. An appeal by the magazine followed, resulting in a partial reversal of the judgment. The Tokyo High Court reduced the damages to ¥1.2 million, concluding that the reports of drinking and smoking were defamatory but that the allegations of sexual exploitation of adolescent boys by Johnny Kitagawa were true. A 2004 appeal to the Supreme Court by Kitagawa was rejected.

==Early life==
Born in 1928 in [[Los Angeles, California]], United States, Kitagawa returned with his family to Japan in 1933. His father Taido was a Buddhist priest and was the third head  bishop of the [[Koyasan Buddhist Temple]] in [[Little Tokyo, Los Angeles|Little Tokyo]] from 1924 to 1933.&lt;ref&gt;Kazahaya, Katsuichi. (1974) ''Koyasan Beikoku Betsuin 50 nen shi. pp. 138-9.''&lt;/ref&gt; Johnny went to America about 1949. In the early 1950s, he returned to Japan to work at the [[Embassy of the United States in Tokyo|United States Embassy]]. While walking through Tokyo's [[Yoyogi Park]] he encountered a group of boys playing baseball. He recruited them to form a singing group, acting as their manager. He named the group "[[Johnnys|The Johnnies]]".&lt;ref name = "Jpop" /&gt; The Johnnies achieved a measure of success by using a then-novel formula of mixing attractive performers singing popular music with coordinated dance routines.  The Johnnies were the first all-male pop group in Japan, and set the pattern that Kitagawa would follow with his subsequent acts.&lt;ref name = "Jpop" /&gt; Indeed, the term "Johnnies" would come to apply generically to any of the performers under Kitagawa's employ.&lt;ref name = "Jpop" /&gt;

==Major success==
In 1968, Kitagawa achieved wider success with a four-member boy band known as {{nihongo|[[Four Leaves]]|フォーリーブス|Fō Rībusu}}. The song and dance group met with success, as reflected by seven consecutive appearances on the annual invitation-only {{nihongo|[[Kōhaku Uta Gassen]]|紅白歌合戦|Red White Song Battle}}, beginning in 1970.&lt;ref name ="four"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japan-zone.com/news/2009/01/19/four_leaves_taabo_battling_cancer.shtml|title=Four Leaves Taabo battling cancer|accessdate=5 Feb 2009|work=Japan Zone|date=19 Jan 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four Leaves performed together for ten years before disbanding in 1978. Later, in 2002, Kitagawa oversaw the band's reunion.&lt;ref name ="four" /&gt; Kitagawa went on to assemble, produce and manage many of the top all-male bands in the country, including groups such as [[Hey! Say! JUMP]], [[SMAP]], [[Tokio (band)|Tokio]], [[V6 (band)|V6]], [[Arashi]], [[Tackey &amp; Tsubasa]], [[Kanjani8]], [[News (band)|NEWS]], [[KAT-TUN]], [[KinKi Kids]] and among many others.&lt;ref name = "Jpop" &gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2005/aug/21/popandrock3|title=J-Pop's dream factory|author=Chris Campion|work=[[The Guardian]] Music Observer Monthly|publicationdate=21 Aug 2005|accessdate=2 Feb 2009 | location=London | date=2005-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kitagawa was able to expand his sphere of influence to include television, as his performers regularly appear on television, with many appearing on their own variety programs.  They also regularly act as pitchmen for commercial products, and appear in movies.&lt;ref name = "starmaker" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "LAT" /&gt; The success of Kitagawa's performers led to increased profitability, as Johnny &amp; Associates generated 2.9 billion yen in annual profits at the height of the boy band boom.&lt;ref name = "starmaker" /&gt; During 1997, performers belonging to the talent agency appeared in more than 40 television programs and another 40 commercials.&lt;ref name = "starmaker" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "tarnished" /&gt; The success of his company has made Kitagawa one of the richest men in Japan.&lt;ref name = "grim" /&gt;

==The formula==
Kitagawa repeatedly has employed a standard formula in the development and marketing of his acts.&lt;ref name = "Turning Japanese"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/feb/11/turning-japanese-music-moguls|accessdate=23 Mar 2009|title=Turning Japanese: The seedy underworld of music moguls|work = [[The Guardian]]|author = Alex Hoban|date=11 Feb 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnny &amp; Associates holds open tryouts for potential performers. The production agency recruits boys as young as ten into a talent pool known as [[Johnny's Juniors]].&lt;ref name = "Jpop" /&gt; Successful applicants live in a company dormitory and attend a company-run school. They train to hone their showmanship in the form of singing, dancing and acting.&lt;ref name = "LAT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/jan/28/entertainment/ca-nino28|accessdate=16 Nov 2010|work = [[The Los Angeles Times]]|author=Bruce Wallace|date=28 Jan 2007|title=The story is written on this actor's face}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kitagawa holds an annual summer festival known as "Johnny's Summary". {{quote box |width=25em | |align=right  | quote=I'm not very interested in records.

It's not good for the artist.|salign=right|source=—Johnny Kitagawa, June 1996&lt;ref name="Billboard 96" /&gt;}}Promising members of [[Johnny's Jr.]] appear alongside of established members of Kitagawa's fold. The junior members act as background dancers for the major acts to allow for name recognition prior to being launched as a separate group.&lt;ref name = "Jpop" /&gt; The members of the Juniors also appear in on "Hachi-ji da J", a weekly television variety show. Members sing, dance, and perform in comedic sketches as they further develop the skills to graduate to a major act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fl19990915pb.html|accessdate=6 Feb 2009|work=[[The Japan Times]]|title=Young at heart, but never free of Johnny|date=15 Sep 1999|author=Phillip Brasor}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kitagawa's focus is on the development of his group as complete entertainers. Shonentai, for example, did not release a single until it had been together for more than seven years.&lt;ref name = "Billboard 96" /&gt; "I'm not very interested in records," Kitagawa said in a 1996 interview. "Once you release a record, you have to sell that record. You have to push one song only. You can't think of anything else. It's not good for the artist." &lt;ref name = "Billboard 96"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McClure |first1=Steve |year=1996 |title=You Look Like a Music Star |journal=Billboard |volume=108 |issue=35 |pages=76–80 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vwcEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA76&amp;dq=johnny+kitagawa&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=johnny+kitagawa&amp;f=false |issn=0006-2510 |publisher=Nielsen Business Media|accessdate = January 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once launched, Kitagawa has been known to use his established groups to induce television stations to report on his newer acts, and ensure favorable press coverage for his acts and himself.&lt;ref name = "LAT" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "grim"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE6D9113EF937A25757C0A9669C8B63|accessdate=4 Feb 2009|date=14 Apr 2000|title=Lawmakers In Japan Hear Grim Sex Case|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=Calvin Sims}}&lt;/ref&gt; Programs that give unfavorable coverage do not receive interviews or television appearance from popular stars managed by Kitagawa.&lt;ref name = "tarnished" /&gt;
Kitagawa maintains a high degree of control over his acts,&lt;ref name = "Jpop" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Johnnies"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fd20070916pb.html|accessdate=2 Feb 2009|author=Phillip Brasor|work= [[The Japan Times]]|date=16 Sep 2007|title=They're fey, maybe not gay, but anyway, the 'talent' are coming out to play}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the extent that their images do not appear on the company website.&lt;ref name= "Jpop" /&gt; Performers are expected to maintain a public image that is conducive to marketing to young women; as a result, members of bands produced by Kitagawa avoid public mention of their private lives.&lt;ref name = "Johnnies" /&gt; Kitagawa himself avoids the public spotlight as well. He rarely permits his photograph to be taken, and does not make public appearances with his groups.&lt;ref name = "Jpop" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Johnnies" /&gt;

==Sexual harassment claims and libel suit==
Rumors concerning Kitagawa and possible [[sexual harassment]] of the youth in his employ had surrounded the agency since 1988,&lt;ref name = "Secrets" /&gt; when {{nihongo|Koji Kita|北公次|''Kita Kōji''}}, a former member of Four Leaves, published a series of diaries under the title {{nihongo|''Hikaru Genji e''|光Genjiへ|To [[Hikaru Genji (band)|Hikaru Genji]]}}. Kita claimed that Kitagawa had used his position of influence over the group to make unwanted sexual advances towards the boys under contract to him.&lt;ref name = "Jpop" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "grim" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{nihongo|Koji Kita|北公次|''Kita Kōji''}}, {{nihongo|''Hikaru Genji e''|光Genjiへ|}}, Publisher: {{nihongo|Data House|データハウス|''dēta hausu''}}, December 1988&lt;/ref&gt; Similar allegations were made in a book published in 1996 by Junya Hiramoto, a former member of another of Kitagawa's bands. Hiramoto alleged that he had seen Kitagawa force a boy to have sex with him in one of the talent agency's dormitories.&lt;ref name = "starmaker"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4011093,00.html|accessdate=4 Feb 2009|work=Kobe Observer|title=Japan's star-maker accused of sexually abusing boys|date=23 April 2000|author=Justin McCurry | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Later, in 1999, the weekly magazine {{nihongo|''[[Shukan Bunshun]]''|週刊文春|}} printed a ten-part series that detailed numerous allegations of sexual improprieties. The accusers were a dozen teenage boys who had been recruited into the Johnny &amp; Associates organization, who spoke on condition of anonymity. In addition, the series also accused Kitagawa of permitting minors in his employ to drink alcohol and smoke. The accusations prompted international newspaper coverage.&lt;ref name = "Jpop" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "tarnished"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/library/world/asia/013000japan-talent.html|title=In Japan, Tarnishing a Star Maker|accessdate=2 Feb 2009|work=[[The New York Times]]|date = 30 Jan 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The controversy resulted in Yoshihide Sakaue, a member of the [[Diet of Japan|Parliament]], holding a hearing on the matter in April, 2000.&lt;ref name = "grim" /&gt; Sakaue said that as a result of the media coverage, and in response to a request from a constituent, he wanted to examine whether government officials had properly investigated complaints about Kitagawa.&lt;ref name = "tarnished" /&gt; Officials of the National Police Agency acknowledged that they had investigated Kitagawa's agency, but had not determined that sexual harassment had occurred. Officials did indicate that Kitagawa's company was warned about permitting minors to use alcohol and smoke cigarettes.&lt;ref name ="grim" /&gt; The National Police and Welfare Ministry indicated that under the Ministry's understanding of the law, even if the allegations against Kitagawa were true, the acts could not be considered [[child abuse]] because Kitagawa was neither parent nor guardian to the boys in his employ.&lt;ref name ="grim" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Secrets" /&gt; In addition, officials testified that neither the boys nor their parents had pursued a criminal complaint against Kitagawa.&lt;ref name ="grim" /&gt;&lt;ref name ="Secrets" /&gt; Kitagawa denied any wrongdoing, and his attorney characterized the claims as being from disgruntled former employees voicing discontent.&lt;ref name = "grim" /&gt;  Kitagawa sued ''Shukan Bunshun'' for [[defamation|libel]].&lt;ref name = "starmaker" /&gt; Other than ''Shukan Bunshun'', none of the major Japanese media covered the story of the allegations against Kitagawa, the hearing in Parliament, or the Kitagawa lawsuit. ''[[The New York Times]]'' attributed this lack of coverage to Kitagawa's influence over the popular [[News media|media]].&lt;ref name = "grim" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Secrets" /&gt; Once ''Shukan Bunshun'' began publication of the series, [[Johnny &amp; Associates]] denied the magazine, and the other media owned by its parent organization, access to any of its performers.&lt;ref name = "tarnished" /&gt;

After protracted litigation, in 2002 the [[Tokyo District Court]] awarded Kitagawa an 8.8 million yen judgment against ''Shukan Bunshun'', finding that the articles defamed him.&lt;ref name = "Jpop" /&gt; ''[[Shukan Bunshun]]'' appealed the ruling. In a partial reversal of the district court, the [[Tokyo High Court]] in 2003 ruled that the ''Shukan Bunshun'' series did in fact defame Kitagawa; however, it ruled that the defamatory content of the articles was limited to the allegations that Kitagawa had provided minors with alcohol and tobacco products. The court found that the ''Shukan Bunshun'' had sufficient reason to accept as trustworthy, and publish, the sexual allegations by Kitagawa's former clients. Kitagawa appealed this decision to the [[Supreme Court of Japan|Supreme Court]], but in 2004 it rejected his appeal.&lt;ref name ="Secrets"&gt;{{cite book|title=Secrets, Sex, and Spectacle: The Rules of Scandal in Japan and the United States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A9CDvNs35ooC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Secrets,+Sex,+and+Spectacle:+The+Rules+of+Scandal+in+Japan+and+the+United+States|ISBN=0-226-89408-8|author=Mark D. West|publisher=University of Chicago Press|page=210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-litigation activities==
In 2006, the boy band [[KAT-TUN]] was promoted to major band status and has all their 20 singles, DVD releases and 6 studio albums to date reach #1 on the prestigious [[Oricon]] music charts; the Japanese equivalent of the American [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] music charts. In 2007, temporary [[Johnny's Jr]]. group, [[Hey! Say! JUMP|Hey! Say! 7]], broke a record as the youngest male group to ever top Oricon charts, with an average age of 14.8 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oricon.co.jp/news/rankmusic/47004/|accessdate = 23 Mar 2009|work = [[Oricon Style]]|title = Hey!

JUMP]] broke a record as the largest group to debut in [[Johnny's Entertainment|Johnny's]] history, with ten members. Kitagawa, as of September, 2007, continued to be involved in the regular operation of [[Johnny &amp; Associates]].&lt;ref name = "Johnnies" /&gt;

De Castelbajac worked for several years in the menswear unit of his father's fashion label, and served as creative director of his Castelbajac Lignée collection.&lt;ref name=AirFrance&gt;Ancouturier, Marie.

'''Marwan Koukash''' (born in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], December 1958)&lt;ref name=SalfOL/&gt;&lt;ref name=RLWorld/&gt; is a businessman and [[racehorse]] owner whose horses have won races including the [[Critérium de Maisons-Laffitte]], [[Cesarewitch Handicap]], [[City and Suburban Handicap]], [[Ayr Gold Cup]] and [[Chester Cup]].  He was also the owner of [[Salford Red Devils]] [[rugby league]] club until 2018.&lt;ref name=StHStar/&gt;

A 2018 Channel 4 documentary programme, ''My Millionaire Migrant Boss'', stated his wealth at £50 million. Koukash is often referred to as a multi-millionaire by the media. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/2018/02/07/millionaire-migrant-boss-review-apprentice-jobseekers-had-tough/|accessdate=13 February 2018|work=AAP|publisher= Telegraph Media Group Limited|date=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and business career==
Koukash was born on the west bank of the [[River Jordan]] in December 1958 in Palestine. When he was eight years old, the family farm was bombed, due to rising escalations with the Israeli military in Palestine and the family crossed into Jordan before settling in [[Kuwait]].&lt;ref name=SalfOL/&gt; Eventually, he moved to [[UK|Britain]] to progress his education, and settled in [[St Helens, Merseyside|St. Helens]] to study at the local technical college.&lt;ref name=StHStar/&gt; 

He graduated from [[Liverpool John Moores University]] and progressed to get a [[PhD]] in electrical engineering. He taught at the university for five years, and was appointed Director of International Business. 

He is also the owner of hotels operated by Hilton such as The Layla Hotel in Liverpool.

==Horse racing==
He was introduced to horse racing by his bank manager, Dave Matthews, and had his first winner in 2007.  In 2012, he had 101 winners, who accumulated over £1m in prize money.&lt;ref name=SalfOL/&gt; His [[Jockey#Racing colors|racing silks]] are grey with a gold star&lt;ref name=LivEcho/&gt; and many of his horses are named after his son, Gabrial and daughters, Lexi and Layla.&lt;ref name=SalfOL/&gt;&lt;ref name=RP070513/&gt; He owns a pre-training facility in [[Knowsley, Merseyside|Knowsley]] and uses various trainers including [[Richard Fahey]] and Kevin Ryan.&lt;ref name=LivEcho/&gt;

It is claimed that he is the biggest owner of race horses in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Billionaire Koukash linked to Newcastle Knights|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/league/10273963/Billionaire-Koukash-linked-to-Newcastle-Knights|accessdate=4 June 2015|work=AAP|publisher=Fairfax New Zealand Limited|date=16 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rugby League==
===Salford Red Devils===
In 2013, Koukash took over the loss-making [[Super League]] club, [[Salford Red Devils|Salford City Reds]]. His interest in rugby league began when he went to watch [[St Helens R.F.C.|St. Helens]] matches with his family. He was encouraged to take ownership of Salford by the [[Rugby Football League]] chief executive Nigel Wood, who had met Koukash on a flight to [[Dubai]].&lt;ref name=Ind270113/&gt; Koukash aims to make the club the biggest in Super League, rebranding them as Salford Red Devils in 2013 and signing 14 new players.

===National Rugby League===
In 2014, Koukash made public his ambitions of purchasing a team in the Australian [[National Rugby League]] (NRL) before the 2015 season. The NRL is considered world's most competitive rugby league competition, in a country where [[rugby league]] is more popular than [[rugby union]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smh.com.au/rugby-league/league-news/marwan-koukash-i-want-to-own-an-nrl-club-in-time-for-next-years-kickoff-20140826-108lox.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, he also announced his plans to take an English team (the "British Bulldogs") and have then play in the NRL in Australia, with the help of airline and hotel sponsorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Salford owner Marwan Koukash wants ‘British Bulldogs’ to play in NRL|url = https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jan/26/salford-red-devils-marwan-koukash-english-team-nrl|newspaper = The Guardian|date = 2015-01-26|access-date = 2016-02-01|issn = 0261-3077|language = en-GB|first = Press|last = Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mary Lee "Molly" Fitzhugh Custis''' (April 22, 1788 – April 23, 1853) was an Episcopal lay leader in Alexandria County (now [[Arlington County]], Virginia, United States). She was the mother of [[Mary Anna Custis Lee|Mary Anna Randolph Custis]] who was the wife of [[Robert E. Lee]]. Early in the 1820s, Molly Custis helped form a coalition of women who hoped to eradicate slavery.&lt;ref name="Carlo"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/883147972|title=Mrs. Lee's rose garden : the true story of the founding of Arlington|last=Carlo,|first=DeVito,|isbn=9781604335460|edition= First|location=Kinnebunkport, Maine|oclc=883147972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
The daughter of [[William Fitzhugh]] (1741–1809) a member of the Continental Congress, and [[Ann Bolling Randolph Fitzhugh]], Molly Custis was most likely born at [[Chatham Manor]], in [[Stafford County, Virginia|Stafford County]], Virginia.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Custis_Mary_Lee_Fitzhugh_1788-1853#start_entry|title=Custis, Mary Lee Fitzhugh (1788–1853)|website=www.encyclopediavirginia.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Marriage and Family ==
[[Image:Arlington House pre-1861.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Arlington House, The Robert E. Lee Memorial|Arlington House]] from an antebellum sketch, published in 1875.]]On July 7, 1804, Molly married [[George Washington Parke Custis]], an orator, playwright, writer, and the grandson of [[Martha Washington|Martha Custis Washington]] through her first marriage to [[Daniel Parke Custis]]. Molly Custis thus became [[George Washington]]'s step-granddaughter-in-law. Molly's father William Fitzhugh and George Washington were long-time friends, with Washington mentioning in his diaries the hospitality of Molly's mother [[Ann Bolling Randolph Fitzhugh]]; a visit to William Fitzhugh turned out to be the last time Washington left Mt. Vernon before his death.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Custises lived at [[Arlington House, The Robert E. Lee Memorial|Arlington House]], an {{convert|1100|acre|km2|adj=on}} plantation in Alexandria County, Virginia. Of their four daughters, only [[Mary Anna Custis Lee|Mary Anna Randolph Custis]], who later married [[Robert E. Lee]], survived childhood; Lee's father Henry had famously eulogized President Washington at the 1799 funeral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gwpapers.virginia.edu/project/exhibit/mourning/response.html |title=Immediate Response|publisher = Papers of George Washington|accessdate=2012-05-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120228192657/http://gwpapers.virginia.edu/project/exhibit/mourning/response.html |archivedate=2012-02-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Molly's brother, [[William Henry Fitzhugh]], supported his niece [[Anne Hill Carter Lee|Anne Lee]] and her six children by allowing them to stay at his home in [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax County]], [[Ravensworth (plantation)|Ravensworth]] where she died in 1829.&lt;ref name="Carlo"/&gt; In 1824, when [[Robert E. Lee]] was 17, [[William Henry Fitzhugh]] wrote to the [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]], [[John C. Calhoun]], urging that Robert be given an appointment to the [[United States Military Academy]] at West Point.

== Religious Influence ==
Molly Custis was a member of a family network in northern Virginia that helped revive the state's Episcopal Church in the first part of the nineteenth century. She particularly influenced her cousin Bishop [[William Meade]]. Molly Custis promoted Sunday schools and supported the work of the [[American Colonization Society]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Molly followed the teachings of the [[Second Great Awakening]], with its emotional surrender to a just but inscrutable, God and rejection of transient worldly pleasures.&lt;ref name="Carlo"/&gt;

== Death ==
She died at Arlington on April 23, 1853, and was buried on the estate. Her husband survived her by four years, at which point Arlington House and the grounds were inherited by their daughter [[Mary Anna Custis Lee|Mary Anna Randolph Custis]], Mrs. [[Robert E. Lee]].

'''''McDonald's Corporation v Steel &amp; Morris''''' [1997] EWHC QB 366, known as "the '''McLibel case'''", was an English [[lawsuit]] for [[libel]] filed by [[McDonald's|McDonald's Corporation]] against [[environmentalism|environmental]] activists Helen Steel and David Morris (often referred to as "The McLibel Two") over a factsheet critical of the company. Each of two [[hearing (law)|hearings]] in English courts found some of the leaflet's contested claims to be libellous and others to be true. The partial nature of the victory, the [[David and Goliath|David-and-Goliath]] nature of the case, and the drawn-out litigation embarrassed McDonald's.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

The original case lasted nearly ten years which, according to the [[BBC]], made it the longest-running libel case in English history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | title=McLibel pair get police payout | publisher=BBC | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/820786.stm | date=5 July 2000}} {{cite news  | title='McLibel' pair in fresh court bid | publisher=BBC | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/3632944.stm | date=7 September 2004}} {{cite news  | title=McLibel: Longest case in English history | publisher=BBC | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4266741.stm | date=15 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; McDonald's announced it did not plan to collect the £40,000 it was awarded by the courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=McDonald's lets McLibel case rest |publisher=AP |url=http://chronicle.augusta.com/stories/071997/biz_mclibel.html |date=19 July 1997 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006063257/http://chronicle.augusta.com/stories/071997/biz_mclibel.html |archivedate=6 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the decision, the [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECHR) ruled in ''Steel &amp; Morris v United Kingdom'' the pair had been denied a fair trial, in breach of Article 6 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] (right to a fair trial) and their conduct should have been protected by Article 10 of the Convention, which protects the right to freedom of expression.

The United Kingdom]" The [[European Court of Human Rights]], 15 February 2005. Received 1 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; McDonald's itself was not involved in, or a party to, this action, as applications to the ECHR are independent cases filed against the relevant [[Sovereign state|state]].

In 2013 it was revealed that one of the authors of the "McLibel leaflet", [[Bob Lambert (undercover police officer)|Bob Lambert]], had been an undercover police officer who had infiltrated [[London Greenpeace]]. In 2016 it was revealed that a second undercover police officer, John Dines, had a sexual, romantic relationship with Helen Steel.

[[Franny Armstrong]] and [[Ken Loach]] made a documentary film, ''[[McLibel (film)|McLibel]]'', about the case.

==History==

===Background===
[[London Greenpeace]] was a small environmental campaigning group which existed between 1972 and 2001. They were not affiliated with the larger [[Greenpeace|Greenpeace International]] organisation, which they declined to join as they saw it being too "centralised and mainstream for their tastes".&lt;ref name="second"&gt;pg 388 of ''No Logo''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Libel charges===
In 1990, McDonald's brought [[Slander and libel|libel]] proceedings against five London Greenpeace supporters, Paul Gravett, Andrew Clarke and Jonathan O'Farrell, as well as Steel and Morris, for distributing the sheet on the streets of London. This case followed past instances in which McDonald's threatened to sue more than fifty organisations for libel, including [[Channel 4]] television and several major publications. In all such cases, the media outlets settled, and offered apologies for the alleged libel.&lt;ref&gt;"Over the past 15 years, McDonald's has threatened legal action against more than 90 organisations in the U.K., including the [[BBC]], [[Channel 4]], the ''Guardian'', ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'', the [[Scottish TUC]], the New Leaf Shop, student newspapers, and a children's theatre group. Even [[Prince Philip]] received a stiff letter. All of them backed down and many formally apologised in court." from "Why Won't British TV Show a Film about McLibel?", Franny Armstrong, 19 June 1998, ''[[The Guardian]]''; as quoted in ''No Logo''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under [[English defamation law]], the defendant must show that each disparaging statement made is substantively true. This can be an expensive and time-consuming process. Three of the charged individuals (Gravett, Clarke and O'Farrell) chose to apologise as requested by McDonald's. Steel and Morris, however, chose to defend the case.&lt;ref&gt;Skau, S. (2013) McLibel. followthethings.com (www.followthethings.com/mclibel.shtml) Accessed 16 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The two were denied [[Legal Aid]], as was policy for libel cases, despite having very limited income.&lt;ref name="jobs"&gt;"For 313 days in court - the longest trial in English history - an unemployed postal worker (Morris) and a community gardener (Steel) went to war with chief executives from the largest food empire in the world." pg 389 of ''No Logo''&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, they had to represent themselves, though they received significant [[pro bono]] assistance. Steel and Morris called 180 witnesses, seeking to prove their assertions about [[food poisoning]], unpaid [[overtime]], misleading claims about how much McDonald's [[recycling|recycled]], and "corporate spies sent to infiltrate the ranks of London Greenpeace".&lt;ref&gt;pg 389 of ''No Logo''&lt;/ref&gt; McDonald's spent several million pounds, while Steel and Morris spent £30,000; this disparity in funds meant Steel and Morris were not able to call all the witnesses they wanted, especially witnesses from South America who were intended to support their claims about McDonald's activities in that continent's rainforests.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;McLibel film, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

In its libel allegation, McDonald's asserted all claims in the pamphlet as being false.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcspotlight.org/case/pretrial/state%27o%27claim.html |title=Statement of Claim |publisher=Mcspotlight.org |accessdate=13 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; They found it difficult to support this position despite the indirectness of some of the claims. The case eventually became a [[media circus]]. McDonald's executives, including [[Ray Cesca]], entered the witness box, enabling cross-examination by the defendants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vidal|first=john|title=McLibel: British Culture on Trial|publisher=The New Press|date=1997|pages=11–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1995 McDonald's offered to settle the case (which "was coming up to its [tenth] anniversary in court"&lt;ref name="first"&gt;pg 387 of ''No Logo'', 1st ed.&lt;/ref&gt;) by donating a large sum of money to a charity chosen by the two. They further specified they would drop the case if Steel and Morris agreed to "stop criticising McDonald's".&lt;ref name="first"/&gt; Steel and Morris secretly recorded the meeting, in which McDonald's said the pair could criticise McDonald's privately to friends but must cease talking to the media or distributing leaflets. Steel and Morris wrote a letter in response saying they would agree to the terms if McDonald's ceased advertising its products and instead only recommended the restaurant privately to friends.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

===Judgment===

====High Court====
The case was adjudicated by Hon. Mr Justice Rodger Bell.&lt;ref&gt;Bell J had never tried, or acted as a barrister in, a libel case. His area of law had been primarily professional negligence, and so it has been felt by many that he was "led" by Richard Rampton QC, for McDonald's, throughout most of the case.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 June 1997, Bell delivered a more than 1,000-page decision largely in favour of McDonald's,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/judgmentsfiles/j379/mcdonalds_190697.htm |title=The Court Service - Queens Bench Division - Judgment - McDonald's Corporation &amp; McDonald's Restaurants Limited against Helen Marie Steel &amp; David Morris |publisher=Hmcourts-service.gov.uk |accessdate=13 November 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080605062408/http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/judgmentsfiles/j379/mcdonalds_190697.htm |archivedate = 5 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; summarised by a 45-page paper read in court.&lt;ref&gt;"On 19 June 1997, the judge finally handed down the verdict....It felt like an eternity to most of us sitting there, as Judge Rodger Bell read out his forty-five-page ruling - a summary of the actual verdict, which was over a thousand pages long. Although the judge deemed most of the factsheet's claims too hyperbolic to be acceptable (he was particularly unconvinced by its direct linking of McDonald's to "hunger in the 'Third World'"), he deemed others to be based on pure fact." pg 389-390 of ''No Logo''.&lt;/ref&gt; Steel and Morris were found liable on several points, but the judge also found some of the points in the factsheet were true.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; McDonald's considered this a legal victory, though it was tempered by the judge's endorsement of some of the allegations in the sheet. Specifically, Bell ruled McDonald's endangered the [[health]] of their workers and customers by "misleading advertising", and they "exploit children", that they were "culpably responsible" in the infliction of unnecessary [[cruelty to animals]], and they were "antipathetic"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcspotlight.org/case/trial/verdict/verdict10_sum.html|title=SUMMARY OF THE JUDGEMENT / Employment practices|accessdate=26 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Trade union|unionisation]] and paid their workers low wages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.mcspotlight.org/case/trial/verdict/quotes.html | date = 19 June 1997| title = Judgement Day Verdict - Highlights | publisher = McSpotlight | accessdate = 14 July 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, although the decision awarded £60,000 to the company, McDonald's legal costs were much greater, and the defendants lacked the funds to pay it. Steel and Morris immediately appealed against the decision.&lt;ref name="BBC payout"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/820786.stm |title=McLibel pair get police payout |first=BBC |last=News |accessdate=12 May 2007 | date=5 July 2000 |authorlink=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998 a documentary film was made about the case, also titled [[McLibel (film)|''McLibel'']]. This was updated in 2005 after the verdict of the final appeal.

In September 1998, the pair sued the [[Metropolitan Police]] for disclosing confidential information to investigators hired by McDonald's and received £10,000 and an apology for the alleged disclosure.&lt;ref name="BBC payout" /&gt;

====Court of Appeal====
An appeal began on 12 January 1999 and lasted 23 court days, ending on 26 February.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcspotlight.org/media/press/msc_6jan99.html |title=Press Release - McLibel Support Campaign; 6 January 1999 |publisher=Mcspotlight.org |accessdate=13 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The case was heard in Court 1 of the Court of Appeal in the [[Royal Courts of Justice]]. The case was adjudicated by Lord Justices Pill and May and Mr Justice Keane. The defendants represented themselves in court, assisted by first year law student Kalvin P. Chapman ([[King's College London]]). McDonald's were represented by libel lawyer [[Richard Rampton|Richard Rampton QC]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onebrickcourt.com/barristers.asp?id=20 One Brick Court - Barristers&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and a junior barrister, Timothy Atkinson,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mcspotlight.org/people/biogs/atkinson.html Curriculum Vitae - Timothy Atkinson]&lt;/ref&gt; and Ms Pattie Brinley-Codd of Barlow, Lyde &amp; Gilbert.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mcspotlight.org/people/biogs/brinley_codd.html Curriculum Vitae - Patti Brinley-Codd]&lt;/ref&gt; Steel and Morris filed a 63-point appeal. They had requested a time extension, but were denied. The verdict for the appeal was handed down on 31 March, in Court 1 at the Royal Courts of Justice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mcspotlight.org/media/press/msc_25mar99.html Press Release - McLibel Support Campaign; 25 March 1999]&lt;/ref&gt;

The judges ruled it was fair comment to say that McDonald's employees worldwide "do badly in terms of pay and conditions"&lt;ref&gt;[Appeal Judgment p247]&lt;/ref&gt; and true "if one eats enough McDonald's food, one's diet may well become high in fat, etc., with the very real risk of heart disease". They further stated the last finding "must have a serious effect on their trading reputation since it goes to the very business in which they are engaged. In our judgment, it must have a greater impact on the respondents' [McDonald's] reputation than any other of the charges that the trial judge had found to be true".&lt;ref&gt;[Judgment p264]&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}

The Court of Appeal also stated that it had "considerable sympathy" with the defendants' submissions that the leaflet meant "that there is a respectable body of medical opinion which links a junk food diet with a risk of cancer and heart disease", that 'this link was accepted both in literature published by McDonald's themselves and by one or more of McDonald's own experts and in medical publications of high repute', and that therefore 'that should have been an end of this part of the case'.&lt;ref&gt;[p169]&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}} They ruled against the defendants on the allegation that McDonald's food was a [[carcinogen]].&lt;ref&gt;[p170-2]&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}

As a result of their further findings against the Corporation, the three Lord Justices reduced Mr Justice Bell's award of £60,000 damages to McDonald's by £20,000. The court ruled against the argument by Steel and Morris that multinational corporations should no longer be able to sue for libel over [[public interest]] issues; they believed "that may be seen as an argument of some substance", but ultimately rejected it, on grounds that it was a matter for Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;[p287]&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}  Steel and Morris announced their intention to appeal over these and other points to the [[House of Lords]], and then take the [[UK Government|UK government]] to the [[European Court of Human Rights]] if necessary.

In response to the verdict, [[David Pannick, Baron Pannick|David Pannick QC]] said in ''[[The Times]]'': "The McLibel case has achieved what many lawyers thought impossible: to lower further the reputation of our law in the minds of all right thinking people."&lt;ref&gt;The Times, 24 April 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Steel and Morris appealed to the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|Law Lords]], arguing that their right to legal aid had been unjustly denied. When the Law Lords refused to accept the case, the pair formally retained [[solicitor]] [[Mark Stephens (solicitor)|Mark Stephens]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article515008.ece|title=McDonald's gets a taste of defeat as Europe backs the McLibel Two|publisher=Times newspapers|date=16 February 2005|accessdate=29 January 2011|location=London|first=Frances|last=Gibb}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[barrister]] (later [[Director of Public Prosecutions]] (England and Wales)), [[Keir Starmer]] QC to file a case with the [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECHR), contesting the UK government's policy that legal aid was not available in libel cases, and setting out a highly detailed case for what they believed to be the oppressive and unfair nature of UK libel laws in general, and in their case in particular.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mcspotlight.org/case/trial/verdict/Echr.html European Court of Human Rights Application&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2004, this action was heard by the ECHR. Lawyers for Steel and Morris argued that the lack of legal aid had breached the pair's right to freedom of expression and to a fair trial.

====European Court of Human Rights====
[[File:Anti-McDonalds protest Leicester Square London 20041016.jpg|thumb|right|An anti-McDonald’s leafleting campaign in front of the McDonald’s restaurant in Leicester Square, London, during the European Social Forum season, 16-10-2004.]]
On 15 February 2005, the European Court of Human Rights ruled&lt;ref name="echr"&gt;[http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-68224  CASE OF STEEL AND MORRIS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM (Application no. 68416/01): JUDGMENT]&lt;/ref&gt; that the original case had breached Article 6 (right to a fair trial) and Article 10 (right to freedom of expression) of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] and ordered that the UK government pay Steel and Morris £57,000 in compensation. In their ruling, the ECHR criticised the way in which UK laws had failed to protect the public right to criticise corporations whose business practices affect people's lives and the environment (which violates Article 10); they also ruled that the trial was biased because of the defendants' comparative lack of resources and what they believed were complex and oppressive UK libel laws.

In particular the Court held:
{{quote|in a democratic society even small and informal campaign groups, such as London Greenpeace, must be able to carry on their activities effectively and that there exists a strong public interest in enabling such groups and individuals outside the mainstream to contribute to the public debate by disseminating information and ideas on matters of general public interest such as health and the environment.|ECJR judgement, para. 89&lt;ref name="echr"/&gt;}}
{{quote|The safeguard afforded by Article 10 to journalists in relation to reporting on issues of general interest is subject to the proviso that they act in good faith in order to provide accurate and reliable information in accordance with the ethics of journalism (...), and the same principle must apply to others who engage in public debate.|ECHR judgement, para. 90&lt;ref name="echr"/&gt;}}
{{quote|It is true that large public companies inevitably and knowingly lay themselves open to close scrutiny of their acts and, as in the case of the businessmen and women who manage them, the limits of acceptable criticism are wider in the case of such companies.|ECHR judgement, para. 94&lt;ref name="echr"/&gt;}}

In response to the European Court of Human Rights' decision, Steel and Morris issued the following press release:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Having largely beaten McDonald's... we have now exposed the notoriously oppressive and unfair UK laws. As a result of the... ruling today, the government may be forced to amend or scrap some of the existing UK laws. We hope that this will result in greater public scrutiny and criticism of powerful organisations whose practices have a detrimental effect on society and the environment. The McLibel campaign has already proved that determined and widespread grass roots protests and defiance can undermine those who try to silence their critics, and also render oppressive laws unworkable. The continually growing opposition to McDonald's and all it stands for is a vindication of all the efforts of those around the world who have been exposing and challenging the corporation's business practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.mcspotlight.org/media/press/releases/msc150205.html

===Post court developments===
In the course of the [[UK undercover policing relationships scandal]] it was revealed that one of the authors of the "McLibel leaflet" was [[Bob Lambert (undercover police officer)|Bob Lambert]], an undercover police officer who infiltrated [[London Greenpeace]]; John Dines, another undercover officer, was also Helen Steel's partner for two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=McLibel leaflet was co-written by undercover police officer Bob Lambert |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/jun/21/mclibel-leaflet-police-bob-lambert-mcdonalds|work=The Guardian|accessdate=21 June 2013|first=Paul|last=Lewis|author2=Rob Evans|date=21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/mar/09/undercover-uk-police-spy-apologises-after-being-tracked-down-by-woman-he-deceived|title=Undercover UK police spy apologises after being tracked down by woman he deceived|publisher=The Guardian|author= Paul Farrell and Rob Evans|date=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Defamation Act 2013]] brought some changes to libel cases,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/assembly-business/official-report/committee-minutes-of-evidence/session-2012-2013/july-2013/defamation-act-2013-libel-reform-campaign-briefing/|title=Defamation Act 2013: Libel Reform Campaign Briefing}}&lt;/ref&gt; which were expected to make it harder for corporations to abuse libel law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thelawyer.com/issues/6-may-2013/can-new-act-clean-up-libel-law/|author=Matt Byrne|title=Can new Act clean up libel law?|date=2013-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The McLibel case also raised awareness about how defamation proceedings can harm the reputation of companies which raise them,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aaronandpartners.com/defamation-act-2013/|title=Defamation Act 2013|date=2014-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; similar to the [[Streisand effect]].

==McDonald's response==
The ''McLibel'' film quoted McDonald's as offering little comment on the European Court decision other than to point out that it was the Government and not McDonald's who was the losing party and that "times have changed and so has McDonald's".

On a website aiming to state its view on issues raised about it, McDonald's stated that the case is in the past and the issues more so, and that both sides in it have moved on (although Morris and Steel did continue related litigation&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/feb/15/food.foodanddrink&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;Skau, S. (2013) McLibel. www.followthethings.com/mclibel.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media==
A feature-length documentary film, ''[[McLibel (film)|McLibel]]'', was made about the case by [[Franny Armstrong]] and [[Ken Loach]] in 1997. An extended version was produced in 2005.

'''Moriwaki Engineering''' is a Japanese manufacturer of speciality high performance products and [[motorcycle accessories]]. 

__TOC__
==Company founder==

'''Mamoru Moriwaki''' is a Japanese [[motorcycle]] tuner, race team owner and founder of Moriwaki Engineering, a Japanese specialty engineering company that designs, manufactures and sells high performance parts for [[motorcycle]]s and [[car]]s.&lt;ref name="Moriwaki Company History"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.moriwaki.co.jp/global/about/01.html |title=Moriwaki Company History |publisher=moriwaki.co.jp |accessdate=29 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

His motorcycle industry career is closely intertwined with that of [[Pops Yoshimura]], another respected motorcycle tuner.&lt;ref name="Moriwaki Engineering Company - Nature's Tuning Shop"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sportrider.com/sportbikes/moriwaki-engineering-company-nature-s-tuning-shop |title=Moriwaki Engineering Company - Nature's Tuning Shop |publisher=sportrider.com |accessdate=29 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Moriwaki began his career as a [[Motorcycle racing|motorcycle racer]] for [[Pops Yoshimura|Hideo "Pops" Yoshimura]], a respected motorcycle mechanic and tuner involved in Japanese motorcycle racing.&lt;ref name="Moriwaki Engineering Company - Nature's Tuning Shop"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Moriwaki dream to beat factory team"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crash.net/motogp/news/73157/1/moriwaki-dream-to-beat-factory-team |title=Moriwaki dream to beat factory team |publisher=crash.net |accessdate=13 January 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moriwaki received no formal training in engineering while working for Yoshimura. Instead, he became self-taught, learning about mechanical engineering from books borrowed from his local high school.&lt;ref name="Moriwaki Engineering Company - Nature's Tuning Shop"/&gt; Moriwaki married Namiko Yoshimura, Pops’ eldest daughter, while he was working for the company.&lt;ref name="Moriwaki Engineering Company - Nature's Tuning Shop"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Moriwaki dream to beat factory team"/&gt; While working for the Yoshimura racing team, Moriwaki also successfully competed in [[auto racing]], driving a Yoshimura-prepared [[Honda S800]] sports car to a class victory at the [[6 Hours of Fuji]] endurance race on July 26, 1970, and the GTS1 Class at the 1971 Japan Grand Prix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yoshimura-jp.com/en/fan/race/ |title=Yoshimura Racing History |publisher=yoshimura-jp.com |accessdate=13 January 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, Yoshimura made the decision to move his company to the United States to take advantage of the burgeoning American motorcycle market.&lt;ref name="Pops Yoshimura at the Motorcycle Hall of Fame"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.motorcyclemuseum.org/halloffame/detail.aspx?RacerID=297&amp;lpos=0px&amp;letter=Y&amp;txtFname=&amp;rblFname=S&amp;txtLname=&amp;rblLname=S&amp;discipline=0 |title=Pops Yoshimura at the Motorcycle Hall of Fame |publisher=motorcyclemuseum.org |accessdate=29 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moriwaki did not agree with Yoshimura and refused to leave his home in Japan.&lt;ref name="Moriwaki Engineering Company - Nature's Tuning Shop"/&gt; This created a rift between the two men however, within a year Yoshimura had returned to Japan and sought Moriwaki for help after he had been cheated out of all his money in a business transaction in America.&lt;ref name="Moriwaki Engineering Company - Nature's Tuning Shop"/&gt; Moriwaki loaned Yoshimura money to re-establish himself.&lt;ref name="Moriwaki Engineering Company - Nature's Tuning Shop"/&gt; Yoshimura would go on to establish one of the premier manufacturers of motorcycle high performance parts in the United States and became closely associated with the [[Suzuki]] racing program.&lt;ref name="Pops Yoshimura at the Motorcycle Hall of Fame"/&gt;
[[File:Moriwaki Monster.JPG|thumb|left|Moriwaki Kawasaki ridden by [[Wayne Gardner]] in the 1981 [[Suzuka 8 Hours]] [[Endurance racing (motorsport)#Motorcycle endurance racing|endurance race]]]]
Moriwaki remained in Japan and in 1973 he founded Moriwaki Engineering in [[Suzuka, Mie|Suzuka City]], Japan. He became known for modifying engines and constructing [[motorcycle frame|frames]] for the [[Kawasaki Z1]].&lt;ref name="Moriwaki Engineering Company - Nature's Tuning Shop"/&gt; His bikes were successfully raced in the Australian [[Superbike racing|Superbike]] championships in the late 1970s by New Zealander [[Graeme Crosby]].&lt;ref name="Wayne Gardner's 1980 Moriwaki Kawasaki"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ma.org.au/index.php?id=610 |title=Wayne Gardner's 1980 Moriwaki Kawasaki |publisher=ma.org.au |accessdate=29 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Crosby and co-rider Tony Hatton finished in third place at the prestigious [[Suzuka 8 Hours]] endurance race in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.graemecrosby.com/history-the-early-days.php |title=Graeme Crosby - The Early Days |publisher=graemecrosby.com |accessdate=29 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.motoracing-japan.com/result/spl/788h.html |title=1978 Suzuka 8 Hours results |publisher=motoracing-japan.com |accessdate=29 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moriwaki's reputation continued to be enhanced when Crosby and Akitaka Tomie qualified a Moriwaki Kawasaki on [[pole position]] at the 1979 Suzuka 8 Hours, ahead of all the major factory racing teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.motoracing-japan.com/result/spl/798h.html#2 |title=1979 Suzuka 8 Hours qualifying results |publisher=motoracing-japan.com |accessdate=29 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the 1980 Suzuka 8 Hours race, the Moriwaki team of [[Dave Aldana]] and David Emde qualified in a respectable second place ahead of the official Kawasaki [[factory-backed]] team of [[Eddie Lawson]] and [[Gregg Hansford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.motoracing-japan.com/result/spl/808h.html#2 |title=1980 Suzuka 8 Hours qualifying results |publisher=motoracing-japan.com |accessdate=29 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Crosby went on to race in the [[Grand Prix motorcycle racing|world championships]], Moriwaki hired Australian rider [[Wayne Gardner]] in 1981.&lt;ref name="Moriwaki Engineering Company - Nature's Tuning Shop"/&gt; Also in 1981, Moriwaki developed the world’s first aluminum frame for large capacity motorcycles and entered them in competitions.&lt;ref name="Moriwaki Company History"/&gt; Gardner and John Pace qualified their Moriwaki Kawasaki on pole position at the 1981 Suzuka 8 Hours, once again beating all the major factory racing teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.motoracing-japan.com/result/spl/818h.html#2 |title=1981 Suzuka 8 Hours qualifying results |publisher=motoracing-japan.com |accessdate=29 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://world.honda.com/motorsports/2017/8hours/go_beyond/19/ |title=MORIWAKI’s Spirit Alive and Well After 9 Years Away |publisher=honda.com |accessdate=13 January 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gardner then rode the Moriwaki Kawasaki to an impressive fourth place finish at the 1981 Daytona Superbike race behind Yoshimura Suzuki riders Crosby, [[Wes Cooley (motorcyclist)|Wes Cooley]] and Honda's [[Freddie Spencer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_CWcbfdLZ5MC&amp;lpg=RA5-PA65&amp;dq=1981%20daytona%20200&amp;pg=RA5-PA73#v=onepage&amp;q=1981%20daytona%20200&amp;f=false |title=Yoshimura Dominates Superbike Production Again |author=Ulrich, John |publisher=Books.Google.com |year=1981 |work=Cycle World |accessdate=29 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moriwaki and Gardner proceeded to compete in the British championship, winning their first race in England.&lt;ref name="Wayne Gardner's 1980 Moriwaki Kawasaki"/&gt; Gardner entered the final race of the season with a chance to win the title but, an engine misfire relegated him to third place overall in the championship.&lt;ref name="Wayne Gardner's 1980 Moriwaki Kawasaki"/&gt; Gardner's impressive results on the Moriwaki Kawasaki eventually earned him a contract with the [[Honda]] factory racing team and an eventual [[List of Grand Prix motorcycle racing World Champions by year|world championship]] in [[1987 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season|1987]].&lt;ref name="Moriwaki Engineering Company - Nature's Tuning Shop"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wayne Gardner's 1980 Moriwaki Kawasaki"/&gt;
[[File:Moriwaki Zero X-7.jpg|thumb|right|1984 Moriwaki Honda Zero X-7]]
In the 1980s, Moriwaki became closely associated with [[Honda Racing Corporation]], the racing division for the Honda parent company.&lt;ref name="Moriwaki Engineering Company - Nature's Tuning Shop"/&gt; Moriwaki was the first outside firm allowed to use one of Honda's racing engines.&lt;ref name="Moriwaki Engineering Company - Nature's Tuning Shop"/&gt; From [[2003 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season|2003]] to [[2005 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season|2005]], Moriwaki competed in the premier [[MotoGP]] class with a [[Honda RC211V]] engine in a Moriwaki designed frame.&lt;ref name="Moriwaki dream to beat factory team"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.moriwaki.co.jp/global/racing/md211vf.html |title=Moriwaki MotoGP Project |publisher=moriwaki.co |accessdate=13 January 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The firm gained valuable knowledge from this experience and in [[2010 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season|2010]], a Moriwaki-framed machine run by [[Gresini Racing]] took the inaugural [[Moto2]] title with rider [[Toni Elias]].&lt;ref name="Moriwaki Engineering Company - Nature's Tuning Shop"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.motorcyclenews.com/sport/motogp/2009/april/apr2409-moriwaki-unveils-moto2-bike-/ Moriwaki unveil latest Moto2 contender]

The Moto2 formula is based on a universal engine and engine-ancillary equipment specification, with identical controlled engines supplied to teams via the organisers based on the [[Honda CBR600RR]]. Fuel, oil and tyres are also controlled. Teams are able to use any supplier of chassis, suspension and bodywork under strict regulations to enable no one team to dominate by technology or expenditure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://motorsport.dunlop.eu/moto2/regulations Regulations - Moto2 defined - The Racing Rules] [[Dunlop Tyres|Dunlop Motorsport]], Retrieved 2015-07-21&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
In the book Wiseman and McKeown look at various types of leaders and identify two different types of leaders, Diminishers and Multipliers. Multipliers are leaders who encourage growth and creativity from their workers, while Diminishers are those who hinder and otherwise keep their employees' productivity at a minimum. The authors give what they consider to be solutions and guidance to the issues they bring up in the book.

'''Out-of-home''' ('''OOH''') '''advertising''' or '''outdoor advertising''', also known as '''out-of-home media''' or '''outdoor media''', is [[advertising]] that reaches the consumers while they are outside their homes.

Out-of-home media advertising is focused on marketing to consumers when they are "on the go" in public places, in transit, waiting (such as in a medical office), and/or in specific commercial locations (such as in a retail venue). OOH advertising formats fall into six main categories: billboards, street, roads, highways, transit, and alternative.&lt;ref name="Outdoor Media Formats"&gt;{{cite web|title=Outdoor Media Formats|url=http://www.oaaa.org/marketingresources/outdoormediaformats.aspx|publisher=oaaa.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090621033934/http://www.oaaa.org/marketingresources/outdoormediaformats.aspx|archivedate=2009-06-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The OOH advertising industry in the [[United States]] includes more than 2,100 operators in 50 states representing the major out of home format categories. These OOH media companies range from public, multinational media corporations to small, independent, family-owned businesses. Currently, the United Kingdom and France are Western Europe's first and second largest markets for OOH, respectively. Data from Outsmart (formerly the Outdoor Media Centre), the UK's out-of-home advertising trade association, shows that digital out-of-home (DOOH) grew at a 29.7% CAGR from 2009 to 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.emarketer.com/articles/results.aspx?q=Propped%20by%20Digital%20Growth%2C%20Out-of-Home%20Advertising%20Holds%20Its%20Own%20in%20UK%2C%20France |title= Propped by Digital Growth, Out-of-Home Advertising Holds Its Own in UK, France |work= Brief. eMarkerter |date= 15 October 2015 |accessdate= 20 March 2016 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160330180758/http://www.emarketer.com/articles/results.aspx?q=Propped%20by%20Digital%20Growth%2C%20Out-of-Home%20Advertising%20Holds%20Its%20Own%20in%20UK%2C%20France |archivedate= 30 March 2016 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
[[Billboard]] advertising is a traditional OOH advertising format, but there has been significant growth in digital OOH ([[digital billboard]]s and place-based networks) in recent years; for example, about 4,900 digital billboard displays have been installed in [[China]] and the United States.&lt;ref name="Number of Displays"&gt;{{cite news|title= Number of Displays|url=http://www.oaaa.org/marketingresources/numberofdisplays.aspx|publisher=oaaa.org|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100312023754/http://www.oaaa.org/marketingresources/numberofdisplays.aspx|archivedate=12 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional roadside billboards remain the predominant form of OOH advertising in the US with 66 percent of total annual revenue. Today, billboard revenue is 73 percent local ads, 18 percent national ads, and 9 percent public service ads.&lt;ref name="OAAA"&gt;[http://www.oaaa.org OAAA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061210203510/http://www.oaaa.org/ |date=2006-12-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Street furniture is made up of formats such as bus shelters, newsracks, mall kiosks, and telephone booth advertising. This form of OOH advertising is mainly seen in urban centers. Additionally, this form of advertising provides benefits to communities, as building and maintaining the shelters people use while waiting for the bus.

Transit advertising is typically advertising placed on anything which moves, such as buses, subway advertising, truckside, food trucks, and taxis, but also includes fixed static and electronic advertising at train and bus stations and platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lawlytics.com/blog/out-home-ads/|title=Transit advertising|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171222105151/https://www.lawlytics.com/blog/out-home-ads/|archive-date=2017-12-22|dead-url=no|access-date=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Airport advertising, which helps businesses address an audience while traveling, is also included in this category. Municipalities often accept this form of advertising, as it provides revenue to city and port authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=iJh6NdJCfPgC&amp;pg=PA207&amp;lpg=PA207&amp;dq=Airport+advertising,+which+helps+businesses+address+an+audience+while+traveling,+is+also+included+in+this+category.+Municipalities+often+accept+this+form+of+advertising,+as+it+provides+revenue+to+city+and+port+authorities.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=mB498opwab&amp;sig=O3gFiwwnRp-yhpnvbbdv1nTGzCQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj4nKvo0JXYAhWCpo8KHe12D-4Q6AEILDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Airport%20advertising,%20which%20helps%20businesses%20address%20an%20audience%20while%20traveling,%20is%20also%20included%20in%20this%20category.%20Municipalities%20often%20accept%20this%20form%20of%20advertising,%20as%20it%20provides%20revenue%20to%20city%20and%20port%20authorities.&amp;f=false|title=Marketing|publisher=PediaPress|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171222051342/https://books.google.co.in/books?id=iJh6NdJCfPgC&amp;pg=PA207&amp;lpg=PA207&amp;dq=Airport+advertising,+which+helps+businesses+address+an+audience+while+traveling,+is+also+included+in+this+category.+Municipalities+often+accept+this+form+of+advertising,+as+it+provides+revenue+to+city+and+port+authorities.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=mB498opwab&amp;sig=O3gFiwwnRp-yhpnvbbdv1nTGzCQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj4nKvo0JXYAhWCpo8KHe12D-4Q6AEILDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Airport%20advertising,%20which%20helps%20businesses%20address%20an%20audience%20while%20traveling,%20is%20also%20included%20in%20this%20category.%20Municipalities%20often%20accept%20this%20form%20of%20advertising,%20as%20it%20provides%20revenue%20to%20city%20and%20port%20authorities.&amp;f=false|archivedate=2017-12-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Street furniture, transit, and alternative media formats comprise 34 percent of total outdoor revenue in the US. Some of these formats have a higher percentage of national ads than traditional billboards.&lt;ref name="Pie Chart"&gt;{{cite web|title=Outdoor Pie Chart|url=http://www.oaaa.org/marketingresources/revenue/outdoorpiechart.aspx|publisher=oaaa.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090621045112/http://www.oaaa.org/marketingresources/revenue/outdoorpiechart.aspx|archivedate=2009-06-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Digital out-of-home ==
Digital out-of-home (DOOH) refers to dynamic media distributed across place-based networks in venues including, but not limited to: cafes, bars, restaurants, health clubs, colleges, arenas, gas stations, convenience stores, barber shops, and public spaces. PQ Media defines DOOH by two major platforms, digital place-based networks (DPN) and digital billboards &amp; signage (DBB);  DOOH networks typically feature independently addressable screens, kiosks, jukeboxes and/or [[JumboTron|jumbotrons]]. DOOH media benefits location owners and advertisers alike in being able to engage customers and/or audiences and extend the reach and effectiveness of marketing messages.  It is also referred to as [[digital signage]].

Within the DOOH industry, advertisements may be purchased through programmatic platforms. Programmatic platforms ask marketers to specify desired audience characteristics and automatically locate the media vehicles to deliver that audience. Furthermore, these platforms may allow buyers (the demand side) to plan, execute and monitor campaigns across multiple media platforms (the supply side) using a familiar workflow.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

In the U.S., the DOOH industry grew to $2.9 billion in 2015, representing 40.8% of the total OOH spending. Gas stations, restaurants, and bars are the preferred locations for ad placement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.emarketer.com/Article/Digital-Account-40-of-Out-of-Home-Ad-Spending-2015/1013107 |title= U.S. Digital Out-of-home advertising |work= Brief. eMarkerter |date= 15 October 2015 |accessdate= 20 March 2016 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160329150945/http://www.emarketer.com/Article/Digital-Account-40-of-Out-of-Home-Ad-Spending-2015/1013107 |archivedate= 29 March 2016 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; With digital TVs in gas stations, nearly 52 million customers are getting snippets of weather, sports highlights, celebrity gossip and commercials with their gas each month, according to [[Nielsen Corporation|Nielsen]]. The weekly reach is actually larger than most of the prime-time TV shows. The largest company in the space is [[Gas Station TV]] with 27.5 million monthly viewers at more than 1,100 stations across the U.S., according to Nielsen.&lt;ref&gt;By Robert Channick, [[Chicago Tribune]], November 29, 2011, entitled "Networks Compete For Gas Station Viewers"&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the large number of viewers, the audience profile of TVs at gas stations is unique. All are drivers and 76 percent are adults from age 18-49 with a median age of 40 and [[median household income]] over $70,000.&lt;ref&gt;Nielsen Intercept Studies 2006-2011, 2010 Doublebase GfK MRI&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Nielsen Intercept Studies, 89 percent of the consumers are engaged and watching TV at the gas station and 88 percent love watching every time they fuel because they have nothing else to do.

The reason that this category is growing so rapidly is because busy people are typically busy at home and with the introduction and acceptance of [[digital video recorder]]s (DVRs), it has diluted the frequency with which traditional television commercials are viewed. Every day more TV viewers are skipping past commercials with their DVRs, making out-of-home advertising all the more appealing.&lt;ref&gt;Los Angeles Times, May 27, Alana Semuels, Staff Writer "Now showing very near you..."&lt;/ref&gt; A Nielsen media research study in 2009 showed that 91 percent of DVR owners skipped commercials. As a result, traditional TV advertisers are hungry for an effective substitute, and digital out-of-home ads appear to be one of the solutions. Digital out of home advertising seems to be a cost-effective way for promoting or marketing any brand or product. Usage of billboards and displays for brand promotion is a less expensive way of advertising than television, radio, newspapers and other mediums.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

DOOH also includes stand-alone screens, kiosks, and interactive media found in public places.  The availability of inexpensive LCD screens with built-in media players has opened the door for companies to add interactive video messages in [[point of purchase]] (POP) displays.  The displays allow consumers to get additional information at the moment of decision on a product or service.  Growth in the DOOH industry has been increasing in 2009, with more POP manufacturers, advertisers, and content developers moving to digital. Technological improvements are holding down costs, and low-cost digital signage is making it easier to reach consumers on a larger scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://eecatalog.com/digital-signage/2015/09/16/wrangling-brainier-and-brawnier-digital-signage-2/ |title= Wrangling Brainier (and brawnier?)

"Beacons allow you to communicate with the viewer. They also tell you frequency. With these technologies you could say, for example, with certainty that from 3-5 p.m. on a Monday this is how many men or women walked in front of your sign and also what percentage are new people, which are repeat people, etc." according to [[Mark Boidman]], managing director at [[Peter J. Solomon Company|PJSC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.medialifemagazine.com/a-media-buyers-primer-on-beacons/ |title= A media buyer’s primer on beacons |work=medialife magazine |date=30 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, DOOH have started to extend to in-transit advertising. Tablets are installed inside popular ride-sharing vehicles like Uber, Lyft and Grab. Digital ads are displayed inside the screens allowing brands to reach to high value passengers. This type of DOOH leverages technology to improvide ad distribution and better OOH audience targeting. GPS of tablets are used to enable location-based marketing. Brands can specify geo-fences to determine where their ads will be shown to the passengers.

'''[[Aerial advertising]]''' – Aerial advertising includes towing [[banner]]s via a fixed-wing aircraft as well as airships like blimps and other air-born inflatables overhead of beaches, events and gridlock traffic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oaaa.org/OutofHomeAdvertising/OOHMediaFormats/Airborne.aspx|title=Outdoor Advertising Association of America, Inc. &gt; About OOH &gt; OOH Basics &gt; OOH Media Formats &gt; Airborne|first=Outdoor Advertising Association of America,|last=Inc.|date=|website=www.oaaa.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160812175117/http://www.oaaa.org/OutofHomeAdvertising/OOHMediaFormats/Airborne.aspx|archivedate=2016-08-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Billboard bicycle]]''' is a new type of mobile advertising in which a bike tows a billboard with an advertising message. This method is a cost-efficient, targeted, and environmentally friendly form of advertising. 
[[File:Printed Mobile Billboard.jpg|alt=|thumb|A printed mobile billboard truck advertising ]]
'''Brochure Distribution''' – Information displays in public gathering spaces such as transportation centers, lodging facilities, visitor centers, attractions, and retail environments are targeted ways to distribute highly effective messaging to a targeted audience.  This method is slightly different than traditional OOH as the consumer self-selects the messaging material and can take that message with them.

'''[[Billboard]]''' – Billboards (or Bulletins) are usually located in highly visible&lt;ref&gt;Chmielewski, Sz., Tompalski, P. (2017).

In the U.S. bulletins are usually illuminated. The ad artwork, commonly digitally printed on large vinyl coated fabric membranes, is often "rotated" by the outdoor plant operator amongst several locations in a metropolitan area to achieve the desired reach of the population as defined in the sales contract. With extended periods of high visibility, billboard advertisements provide advertisers with significant impact on commuters. This is the largest standard out of home advertising format, usually measuring at 14ftx48ft in overall size.
[[File:Jägermeister Bus.jpg|thumb|Vinyl decals allowing use of windows, on a side and rear advertisement for alcohol on a Berlin bus]]
'''[[Bus advertising]]''' – Firmly establish brand awareness and generate quick recall with high-profile exposure near point of purchase locations.

'''Commuter rail display''' – Reaches a captive audience of upscale suburban commuters. Additionally, reaches lunch-time patrons, shoppers and business professionals.

'''ComPark advertising''' – ComPark is a device used for car park advertising; which is placed onto the parallel lines of a bay and is able to gain instant exposure from motorists that have just parked their vehicle. The ComPark also serves as a guide to assist motorist in adhering to the parking bay size.

'''Inflatable billboard''' – similar to regular 2D billboard but imposed on 3D object. Best used to market physical products rather than services. A cost-effective approach that is able to achieve high brand awareness and increase product purchases.

'''Lamppost banner advertising''' – Lamp columns are sited everywhere, allowing advertisers and events to use banners to target precise geographical locations and create massive promotional awareness.

'''[[Mobile billboard]]''' –  Mobile billboards offer a great degree of flexibility to advertisers. These advertisements can target specific routes, venue or events, or can be used to achieve market saturation. A special version is the inflatable billboard which can stand free nearly everywhere. This product can also be used for [[inflatable movie screen|outdoor movie nights]]. [[File:AIRFRAME at a public park.JPG|thumb|Mobile inflatable billboard]]

'''[[Poster]]''' – Target local audiences with these billboards, which are highly visible to vehicular traffic and are ideal for the introduction of new products/services. Marketers use posters to achieve advertising objectives and increase brand awareness by placing multiple units in strategic locations while lowering the cost per thousand impressions. This is a standardized poster format, typically measuring 12'3" x 24'6"; formally known as a 30-Sheet Poster.

'''Premier panel''' – Premiere panels combine the frequency and reach of a poster campaign with the creative impact of a bulletin.

'''Premier square''' – Bright top and bottom illumination on a premiere panel provide extra impact after dark.

'''Street advertising''' – The use of pavements and street furniture to create media space for brands to get their message onto the street in a cost-effective approach.
[[File:2011-2015 Toyota Prius (ZVW30R) Hybrid liftback, Prime Taxis (2017-11-29).jpg|thumb|right|Taxi advertising]]
'''Taxi advertising''' – Taxi advertising allows advertisers to highlight their products, whether brand awareness, or a targeted message, directly to areas where people work, shop, and play.

'''Wallscape''' – Wallscapes are attached to buildings and are able to accommodate a wide variety of unusual shapes and sizes. These billboard advertisements are visible from a distance and provide tremendous impact in major metro areas.

'''Aircraft Advertising''' – Aircraft advertising includes product or service branding inside and outside the aircraft. This includes wrapping the aircraft with printed SAVs, baggage tag branding, boarding pass branding, tray table branding and more.

Other types of non-digital OOH advertising include airport displays; transit and bus-shelter displays; headrest displays; double-sided panels; junior posters; and mall displays.

== Regulations ==
Different jurisdictions regulate outdoor advertising to different degrees.

* In the United States:
** The states of Vermont, Hawaii, Maine, and Alaska prohibit all billboards.
** The other 46 states permit multiple forms of OOH advertising.
** Billboards are regulated by all levels of government. The regulatory framework, created by the federal Highway Beautification Act (HBA), calls for billboards to be located in commercial and industrial areas. Billboard permits are issued by state and local authorities. Under the Highway Beautification Act, states have strong regulatory powers including the authority to ban billboards.
** Most states have taken steps to regulate digital (electronic) billboards, which feature static images that change (typically) every six or eight seconds. In 2007, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) issued Guidance to the states regarding regulation of digital billboards. Scenic America challenged the federal Guidance in federal court on procedural grounds.  On June 20, 2014, US District Court Judge James E. Boasberg dismissed this case, with prejudice.
** Regulations governing digital billboards prohibit animation and scrolling. Digital billboards are equipped with light sensors to adjust billboard lighting to surrounding light conditions to avoid glare, per the industry code.
* [[Sao Paulo]], [[Brazil]] established an almost total outdoor advertising ban in 2006. The ban required that all billboard and banner advertisements be removed and that store signs be greatly reduced in size and prominence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sao Paulo: The City With No Outdoor Advertisements|url=http://www.amusingplanet.com/2013/07/sao-paulo-city-with-no-outdoor.html|publisher=www.amusingplanet.com|accessdate=13 June 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150511152228/http://www.amusingplanet.com/2013/07/sao-paulo-city-with-no-outdoor.html|archivedate=11 May 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Emerging technologies ==
'''Media fragmentation,''' competition from online media, as well as the need for greater efficiencies in media buying prompted companies to offer billboard inventory aggregation services
Interactive services are becoming increasingly more common with the move to digital outdoor advertising, such as allowing the public to connect, share and interact through their mobile devices in particular through WiFi connections.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

'''Count Pavel Pavlovich Demidov, 2nd Prince of [[Villa San Donato|San Donato]]''' ({{lang-ru|Павел Павлович Демидов}}; 9 October 1839, [[Frankfurt am Main]] &amp;ndash; 26 January 1885, [[Pratolino]], [[Florence]]) was a Russian industrialist, jurist, philanthropist and nobleman of the [[Demidov]] family.

==Life==
[[File:Paul Demidoff, Prince of San Donato, by Gustave Ricard.jpg|thumb|left|Paul Demidoff, Prince of San Donato ([[Gustave Ricard]], 1859)]]

His parents were [[Aurora Karamzina]] and her husband [[Pavel Nikolaievich Demidov]].

His first marriage was on 1 June 1867 to Princess Maria Elimovna [[Meshchersky|Meshcherskaya]] ([[Saint Petersburg]], 28 February 1844 - [[Villa San Donato|San Donato]] (or [[Vienna]], per Ferrand), 8 August 1868). She died two days after giving birth to a son, [[Elim Pavlovich Demidov, 3rd Prince of San Donato]], at [[Hietzing]] in the suburbs of [[Vienna]] on 6 August 1868. Her loss had a lasting effect on Pavel, who remained inconsolable for a long time, spending a long while in the room in the [[Villa San Donato]] where his wife's dresses were kept to try to recover her presence.

[[File:Princess Demidoff.jpg|thumb|Princess Demidoff (Helene Petrovna Demidova, Princess of San Donato), [[John Singer Sargent]], 1895-1896]]

In Saint Petersburg on 2 June 1871 he remarried to Princess Elena Petrovna [[Trubetskoy family|Trubetskaya]] (Saint Petersburg, 25 September 1853 - [[Odessa]], 28 July 1917), with whom he had six children:
* Prince and Count Nikita Pavlovich Demidov (17 March 1872 - 25 March 1874)
* Princess and Countess [[Aurora Pavlovna Demidova]] (Kiev, 2 November 1873 - [[Bussolino Torinese]], [[Torino]], 16 June 1904), mother of [[Prince Paul of Yugoslavia]]
* [[Anatoly Pavlovich Demidov, 4th Prince of San Donato]] (San Donato 12/31 Nov 1874-Marseille 27 Oct 1943)
* Princess and Countess Maria Pavlovna Demidova ([[Kiev]], 3 February 1877 - [[Pratolino]], 25 July 1955), married in Helsingfors (now better known by its Finnish name [[Helsinki]]), 30 April (OS) / 13 May 1897 Prince [[Semyon Semyonovich Abamelik-Lazarev]] (Saint Petersburg, 7 October 1857 - [[Narsan]], [[Caucasus]], 1 September 1916)
* Prince and Count Pavel Pavlovich Demidov (San Donato, 4 February 1879 - [[Paris]], 30 April 1909), unmarried and without issue
* Princess and Countess Elena Pavlovna Demidova (Saint Petersburg, 10 June 1884 - [[Sesto Fiorentino]], 4 April 1959), married firstly in Saint Petersburg on 29 January 1903 (divorced in 1907) Count Alexander Pavlovich [[Shuvalov]] ([[Vartemiagui]], 7 September 1881 - [[London]], 13 August 1935) and married secondly in [[Dresden]] in June 1907 Nikolai Alexeievich Pavlov ([[Tambov]], 9 May 1866 - [[Vanves]], 31 January 1934))

[[File:Alexei Harlamoff (1840-1925) - Portrait of the children of Paul Pavlovich Demidoff.jpg|thumb|left|Pavel (1879-1909), Avrora (1873-1904),  Maria (1876-1955) and Anatoli (1874-1943). ([[Alexei Harlamov]], 1883)]]

They decided San Donato was too full of memories of his first wife and so moved to [[Villa Pratolino]] (now known as [[Villa Demidoff]]). They ended up selling San Donato, and it was ceded on 5 November 1881 to Gaston Mestayer (a French [[business magnate]]), with the gardens sold separately to Nemesio Papucci and Rosselli Del Turco. A large part of the enormous [[Demidov collection]] of artworks housed in 14 rooms at San Donato were thus dispersed in several sales and memorable public auctions, even the works gathered in the "musée napoléonien" created on [[Elba]] by his uncle [[Anatoly Nikolaievich Demidov, 1st Prince of San Donato]] and the souvenirs that had (mostly) been ceded to Anatole by his father-in-law [[Jérôme Bonaparte]].

[[File:Coat of Arms of Pavel Demidov.svg|thumb|Arms of Pavel Demidov]]

Owning hundreds of factories in Russia, millions of square kilometres of land and palaces in Russia, France and Italy, Pavel was considered as one of the richest men in Europe. He developed the family fortunes and inherited Anatole's title of Prince of San Donato after the latter's death without legitimate issue in 1870 (with the title recognised by king [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy]] two years later). He served with the [[Red Cross]] rather than the Russian military forces during the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|Russo-Turkish War]] and in 1883 he published the pro-Jewish "The Jewish Question in Russia".

'''Pierre Samuel "Pete" du Pont IV''' (born January 22, 1935) is an American lawyer and politician from [[Rockland, Delaware|Rockland]], in [[New Castle County, Delaware]], near [[Wilmington, Delaware|Wilmington]]. He was the [[United States Representative]] for [[Delaware's At-large congressional district|Delaware]] from 1971 to 1977 and subsequently served as the 68th [[List of Governors of Delaware|Governor of Delaware]] from 1977 to 1985. He is a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].

==Early life and family==
{{see also|Du Pont family}}
A member of the [[Du Pont family]], du Pont was born in Wilmington, Delaware, the son of Pierre S. du Pont III and Jane Holcomb du Pont, and great nephew of [[Pierre S. du Pont]], the developer of [[Longwood Gardens]]. After an education at the [[Phillips Exeter Academy]], [[Princeton University]], and [[Harvard Law School]], he served in the [[U.S. Naval Reserve]] ([[Seabee (US Navy)|Seabees]]) from 1957 until 1960. He is married to Elise Ravenel Wood and has four children, Elise, Pierre S. du Pont V,  [[Benjamin Franklin du Pont]], and [[Eleuthère I. du Pont]].

==Professional and political career==
From 1963 until 1970 du Pont was employed by [[DuPont|E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Co]]. In 1968 he was elected to the 1969–70 session of the [[Delaware House of Representatives]]. He seriously considered a bid for a United States Senate seat in 1972 (eventually won by Democrat [[Joseph R. Biden, Jr.]]), but realized he faced a primary election against former U.S. Representative [[Harry G. Haskell, Jr.]] He bowed to the desire of Republican leaders, including President [[Richard Nixon]], to have a reluctant incumbent U.S. Senator [[J. Caleb Boggs]] seek a third term.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
[[File:Pierre S. du Pont IV.jpg|thumb|left|125px|Du Pont as a U.S. Representative]]
In 1970 du Pont was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, defeating Democrat John D. Daniello, a New Castle County Councilman and labor leader. He won election to the U.S. House of Representatives two more times, defeating Democrats Norma Handloff in 1972 and [[University of Delaware]] professor James R. Soles in 1974. In Congress, du Pont supported an attempt to limit presidential authority through the War Powers Act of 1973, but was one of the last to remain loyal to U.S. President Richard M. Nixon during the impeachment process.

==Governor of Delaware==
Du Pont did not seek another term in the U.S. House of Representatives, having been elected Governor of Delaware in 1976, defeating incumbent Democratic Governor Sherman W. Tribbitt. He was elected to a second term as governor in 1980, defeating Democratic State House leader William J. Gordy, and served two terms from January 18, 1977 until January 15, 1985. [[Image:dupontPETE.jpg|thumb|lright|300px|Governor du Pont IV with Adjutant General of Delaware National Guard]]

Du Pont's two terms as governor were the major divide in the modern history of the state. Following a desperate initial confrontation with the Democratic Delaware General Assembly over the budget, both du Pont and the Delaware General Assembly developed the consensus approach to decision making that remains characteristic of Delaware politics. As a result of this cooperation, du Pont signed into law two income tax reduction measures and a constitutional amendment that restrained future tax increases and limited government spending. The ''Wilmington News Journal'' praised these policies, saying that du Pont "revived [the] business climate and set the stage for [Delaware's] prosperity." In 1979, he founded the nonprofit "Jobs for Delaware Graduates," an employment counseling and job placement program for high school seniors not bound for college. This program was the model for other programs currently functioning in many states and foreign countries.

In 1981, Du Pont helped establish the credit card industry in Delaware, in a race against South Dakota, which the year before had abolished its usury law limiting the interest rates that banks can charge consumers for credit. At the time, du Pont's cousin Nathan Hayward III advocated that tiny Delaware aspire to become the "financial Luxembourg of America" - a tax haven for corporations, yacht owners and credit card companies permitted to charge unlimited interest.&lt;ref&gt;''Banking Haven,'' by Neil Gilbride, The Washington Post, June 26, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;  Former Du Pont Chairman Irving Shapiro, a lobbyist for Citigroup, helped Gov. du Pont pass the Financial Center Development Act in 1981 with the cooperation of the leadership of both parties and others in state and local government. Intended to attract two New York state banks that would hire at least 1,000 employees, the law eventually drew more than thirty banks to Delaware, creating 43,000 new finance related jobs and leading the state away from its previous dependence on the chemical industry in general and the Du Pont Company in particular.

==Presidential aspirations==
With his term as governor forced by law to end in 1985, du Pont, as the dominant Delaware politician, was widely expected by many to challenge the incumbent Democratic U.S. Senator [[Joe Biden]]. But du Pont had little interest in legislative politics and declined to run, preparing instead for a long shot bid for the Republican U.S. presidential nomination in the [[United States presidential election, 1988|1988 election]]. (His wife, Elise, ran for the U.S. Congressional seat that he had previously held in 1984, but lost to incumbent Democrat [[Thomas R. Carper|Tom Carper]].)&lt;ref&gt;[http://clerk.house.gov/member_info/electionInfo/1984/1984Stat.htm]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227193149/http://clerk.house.gov/member_info/electionInfo/1984/1984Stat.htm |date=February 27, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He declared his intent on September 16, 1986, before anyone else. Biden also sought his party's nomination.

Running in the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 1988|1988 Republican presidential primaries]], du Pont presented an unconventional program. As described by Celia Cohen in her book, ''Only in Delaware,'' du Pont, "wanted to reform Social Security  by offering recipients private savings options in exchange for a corresponding reduction in government benefits. He proposed phasing out government subsidies for farmers. He said he would wean welfare clients off their benefits and get them into the workforce, even if government had to provide entry level jobs to get them started. He suggested students be subjected to mandatory, random drug tests with those who flunked losing their drivers {{sic}} licenses."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Only in Delaware, Politics and Politicians in the First State |last=Cohen |first=Celia }}&lt;/ref&gt; After finishing next to last in the New Hampshire primary, du Pont left the race.&lt;ref name="AP1988"&gt;{{Cite news |last= |first= |date=February 19, 1988 |title=Du Pont drops presidential bid |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7112863// |newspaper=The Galveston Daily News |location=Galveston, TX |publisher= |agency=[[Associated Press|AP]] |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |accessdate=October 22, 2016 }} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later career==
In 1984, du Pont served as chairman of the Education Commission of the States, a national organization of educators dedicated to improving all facets of American education. He has also served as chairman of the [[Hudson Institute]] from 1985 until 1987 and the National Review Institute from 1994 until 1997.

{{As of|2006|alt=Presently}}, du Pont is the chairman of the board for the [[National Center for Policy Analysis]], a think tank based in Dallas, Texas; he is a director with the Wilmington, Delaware law firm of Richards, Layton, and Finger, and until May 2014, he wrote the monthly ''Outside the Box'' column for the Wall Street Journal.

Rainer-Marc Frey was born on January 10, 1963 in the Swiss canton of [[Basel-Landschaft]]. Following his Matura graduation in economics at the Gymnasium of [[Liestal]], he studied economics at the renowned [[University of St. Gallen]]. He graduated summa cum laude with a degree in economics (lic. oec. HSG) in 1986.

After his studies, he gained his first professional experiences at the American investment banks [[Merrill Lynch]] and [[Salomon Brothers]] and quickly rose in the ranks. At Salomon Brothers, he initiated the opening of new trading departments in [[Zürich]] and [[Frankfurt am Main|Frankfurt]]. Despite excellent career prospects, he left the firm in 1992 and founded his own hedge fund – the RMF Investment Group -   along with two partners in [[Zug]].

=== RMF Investment Group ===

The investment thesis of hedge funds, i.e. achieving above average returns compared to the reference market and reducing risk through hedging strategies, was widely unknown in [[Switzerland]] at the time and was met by scepticism among investors. RMF achieved ground-breaking results. At the beginning, banks and insurance companies in Switzerland did not see the potential in this type of fund, which aimed to also make gains in sideways or negative trending markets. As such, RMF started trading on Japanese [[warrant (finance)|warrants]] and [[convertible bond]]s. It was one of the first active hedge fund groups in [[Europe]]. RMF’s investment thesis proved successful, despite difficult periods such as the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]]. Following these dry spell periods, institutional investors started accepting these concepts.

A successful collaboration with [[LGT Group]] and [[Swiss Life]] (then Schweizerische Lebensversicherungs- und Rentenanstalt) started in 1996 with the launch of Castle Alternative Invest, a hedge fund investment company. Swiss Life were expanding their alternative investment activities rapidly and built a stake of 23.5% of RMF valued at CHF 44 million in 1998, respectively 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160912205215/https://www.swisslife.com/de/medien/mitteilungen/uebersicht/Newsarchiv/20021102.html Media release] Swiss Life, November 2, 2002. Retrieved March 8, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Further cooperations with insurance companies followed in subsequent years. As the [[dot-com bubble]] burst in 2001, market neutral strategies of hedge funds became increasingly popular. The same year, [[Credit Suisse]] invested close to CHF 4 billion in hedge fund strategies through RMF.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bernerzeitung.ch/wirtschaft/unternehmen-und-konjunktur/RainerMarc-Frey-neuer-UBSVerwaltungsrat--Ein-Mann-mit-goldenem-Haendchen/story/17888863 Rainer-Marc Frey, neuer UBS-Verwaltungsrat – Ein Mann mit goldenem Händchen] In: [[Berner Zeitung]], October 2, 2008. Retrieved March 8, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; By 2002, most large Swiss insurers were among RMF’s key clients.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bilanz.ch/unternehmen/fabrik-der-multimillionaere Fabrik der Multimillionäre] In: Bilanz, January 31, 2002. Retrieved March 8, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1996 and 2002, RMF Investment Group developed into one of the leading [[alternative asset]] managers in Europe. Assets under management reached USD 8.5 billion in 2002. The same year, [[Man Group|Man Group plc]] made a takeover offer of approximately CHF 1.35 billion for RMF. The RMF shareholders accepted this offer and it merged with the Man Group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fondsprofessionell.at/news/produkte/headline/man-group-uebernimmt-rmf-76241/ Man Group übernimmt RMF] In: FONDS professionell, Mai 23, 2002. Retrieved March 8, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the deal, RMF’s 12-member management team committed itself to remain on board at the merged company for 3 years. Through this acquisition, the Man Group became the world’s largest provider of hedge fund investments.

=== Horizon21 ===

The sale of his stake in RMF resulted in proceeds of approximately CHF 500 million for Frey. However, Frey and his partners did not rest on their laurels after the sale. In 2004 already, they founded their next investment firm, which would specialize in alternative investments, Horizon 21 AG, headquartered in [[Pfäffikon, Schwyz]].

In September 2005, [[Swiss Re]] became a strategic partner to Horizon21 and acquired a 20% stake in the Horizon21 Alternative Investments business unit. A year later, the partnership between the two firms grew stronger, as they joined efforts in the private equity [[fund of funds]] business. Horizon21 took over the private equity activities of Swiss Re, which in turn bought 30% of the Horizon21 Private Equity Holding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.presseportal.ch/de/pm/100008729/100516270 Pressemitteilung] In: Presseportal, September 21, 2006. Retrieved March 8, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the inception of Horizon21, the management of the founders’ and partners’ wealth has been a focal point of its activities. Following a strategic re-orientation in 2010, Horizon21 positioned itself as a private investment office and it tailors its activities around the founders’ and partners’ investment needs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.horizon21.com/About-us Homepage Horizon21 AG] Retrieved March 8, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Investments ===

Since the sale of RMF, Frey has made himself a name as an industrial investor through stakes in several companies. As private investor and majority shareholder, he was able to share his entrepreneurial experiences to the benefit of the companies in which he invested.

In October 2008, Frey was named onto the Board of Directors of the then crisis-ridden [[UBS]]. The nomination of Frey was intended to bring back more knowledge of the financial industry into the board of directors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finews.ch/news/banken/14945-was-frey-der-ubs-brachte Was Rainer-Marc Frey der UBS brachte] In: Finews, April 1, 2014. Retrieved March 8, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Frey was considered as an independent spirit with a strong voice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bilanz.ch/people/who-who-rainer-marc-frey-380250 Who is Who: Rainer-Marc Frey] In: [[Bilanz]], Mai 30, 2014. Retrieved March 8, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member of the Risk Committee, as well as the Audit Committee and was later also appointed to the Human Resources and Compensation Committee. In April 2014, he decided not to present himself for reelection to the board of directors in order to pursue other professional engagements.

Frey is a member of the Board of Directors of [[DKSH]] since 2008 and he serves on the Audit and Strategy Committees. DKSH is an internationally active market expansion services group, which is deeply rooted in communities across Asia Pacific and headquartered in [[Zürich]]. Frey holds a 3.9% equity stake in DKSH.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dksh.com/global-en/home/investors/share-information/share-data Share information] DKSH Holding AG. Retrieved March 8, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2010, he also holds a stake of currently 8.67% in the Swiss pharmaceuticals company Siegfried Holding AG, based in [[Zofingen]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.siegfried.ch/fileadmin/Dateien/Downloads/Media/Annual_Report_chapters/GB15_CorpGovernance_en_WEB.pdf Siegfried Annual Report 2015], Dezember 31, 2015. Retrieved March 8, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Frey is main shareholder and Vice-Chairman of the Board of Directors of [[Lonrho|Lonrho Holdings Ltd]] since 2013. The company is a diversified conglomerate, which is active in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]. He submitted a takeover bid to the former shareholders in 2013 alongside Swiss entrepreneur [[Thomas Schmidheiny]]. The takeover was finalized on July 19, 2013 and taken private for a value of CHF 270 million.&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Barmettler: Streit um Freihafen. In: [[Handelszeitung]], Oktober 2, 2014, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Philanthropy ===

Frey is the Vice-President of the Board of the Frey Charitable Foundation (FCF), founded in 2004. Guided by an entrepreneurial mindset, which has been key to Rainer-Marc Frey’s own success, FCF aims to empower the underprivileged to successfully take control of their own lives. While active in different countries around the world in the first decade of their activities, FCF focuses particularly on [[Africa]] and [[Switzerland]]. In Africa, FCF focuses on supporting outstanding social entrepreneurs in a variety of thematic areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schwabfound.org/content/partners Frey Charitable Foundation: a partner of Schwab Foundation for Social Entrepreneurship] Retrieved March 8, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1435">The term '''regulatory state''' refers to the expansion in the use of rule making, monitoring and enforcement techniques and institutions by the state and to a parallel change in the way its positive functions in society are being carried out.&lt;ref&gt;Levi-Faur, David, [http://regulation.huji.ac.il/papers/jp39.pdf "The Odyssey of the Regulatory State – Episode One: The Rescue of the Welfare State"], Jerusalem Papers in Regulation &amp; Governance, Paper No. 39, November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The expansion of the state nowadays is generally via [[regulation]] and less via taxing and spending.&lt;ref&gt;Giandomenico Majone (1997). From the Positive to the Regulatory State: Causes and Consequences of Changes in the Mode of Governance. Journal of Public Policy, 17, pp 139-167 doi:10.1017/S0143814X00003524&lt;/ref&gt; The notion of the regulatory state is increasingly more attractive for [[Theoretician (Marxism)|theoreticians]] of the state with the growth in the use and application of rule making, monitoring and enforcement strategies and with the parallel growth of civil regulation and business regulation. The co-expansion of state, civil and business regulation at the domestic and the transnational arenas suggests that the notions of regulatory [[governance]] and [[regulatory capitalism]] are as usefully theoretically as the notion of regulatory state.

In 1864, the Merchants Bank of Halifax was founded in [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]], as a commercial bank that financed the fishing and timber industries and the European and Caribbean import/export businesses.&lt;ref name="rbcinsurance"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.insurancehotline.com/rbcinsurance/| title=RBC Insurance History| date=2016| accessdate=23 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1869 the Merchants' Bank was officially incorporated and received its federal charter in the same year.&lt;ref name="Pound 2005"&gt;{{cite book |title=Fitzhenry and Whiteside Book of Canadian Facts and Dates |last=Pound |first=Richard W. |publisher=Fitzhenry and Whiteside |date=30 September 2004 |isbn=978-1550411713}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1870s and 1880s, the bank expanded into the other [[Maritimes|Maritime Provinces]]. When both the Newfoundland Commercial Bank and Union Bank of Newfoundland collapsed on 10 December 1894, the Merchants Bank expanded to Newfoundland on 31 January 1895.&lt;ref name="Pound 2005" /&gt;

As the bank grew, executives changed its name to reflect its growth and western expansion.&lt;ref name="rbcinsurance" /&gt; In 1901, the Merchants Bank of Halifax changed its name to the Royal Bank of Canada (RBC). The centre of the Canadian financial industry had moved from [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]] to [[Montreal]], so the Merchants Bank relocated its head office there. In 1910, RBC merged with the [[Union Bank of Halifax]]. In the same year it built a bank branch in [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]]—designed by Carrère and Hastings, in beaux-arts classicism proclaiming the financial dominance of Winnipeg in the prairies.&lt;ref name="kalman"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| first1=Harold D.| last1=Kalman| first2=Sharon| last2=Vattay| url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/bank-architecture/| title=Bank Architecture| encyclopedia=The Canadian Encyclopedia |date=16 December 2013 |publisher=Historica Foundation |location=Toronto |accessdate=August 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; To improve its position in [[Ontario]], RBC merged with Traders Bank of Canada in 1912 and in 1917 RBC merged with [[Quebec Bank]], which was founded in 1818 and chartered in 1822 in [[Quebec City]].

RBC's presence in [[Manitoba]] and [[Saskatchewan]] was strengthened through a 1918 merger with Northern Crown Bank, which was the result of the merger in 1908 between Northern Bank (established in 1905 in [[Winnipeg]]) and Crown Bank of Canada (1904), based in [[Ontario]]. RBC's presence in the [[Prairie Provinces]] grew again with the 1925 merger with the Union Bank of Canada, which had begun in Quebec City in 1865 as the Union Bank of Lower Canada, but changed its name in 1886. The Union Bank of Canada had moved its headquarters to Winnipeg in 1912, and had built a strong presence in the Prairies and opened the first bank in the [[Northwest Territories]] at [[Fort Smith, Northwest Territories|Fort Smith]] in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ca/books?id=bp4xWM7K-FYC&amp;pg=PA434&amp;lpg=PA434&amp;dq=first+bank+fort+smith+nwt&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1RA8sV46Mz&amp;sig=NDCyLnqlT1Nc6ylY_Tl6a6S9aDQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj88Pz_1JLdAhVC8IMKHYMRClIQ6AEwDHoECAAQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=first%20bank%20fort%20smith%20nwt&amp;f=false As Long as this Land Shall Last: A History of Treaty 8 and Treaty 11, 1870-1939]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rbc.com/history/quicktofrontier/union_bank_can-detail.html Union Bank of Canada, Fort Smith, North West Territories, 1921]&lt;/ref&gt;

The bank's symbol is a golden [[lion]] clutching a globe, on a blue background. An older version depicted a crown above the globe and the lion faced to the left. The change coincided with an expansion in United States markets. Over the years, the lion's mane has also become less detailed and more stylized, and the tongue was shortened.&lt;ref name=logo&gt;{{cite press release| title=Royal Bank of Canada Updates Brand Name and Logo| url=http://www.rbc.com/newsroom/brand.html| date=20 August 2001| publisher=Royal Bank of Canada| accessdate=2017-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taylor was chairman and CEO from 1986 to 1994, and he was succeeded by [[John Cleghorn]] in that capacity from 1994 to 2001. Dave McKay is currently the ''President and chief executive officer''.

==Controversies==

===Merger===
In 1998, the Royal Bank of Canada proposed to merge with the [[Bank of Montreal]], at the same time as the [[Toronto-Dominion Bank]] proposed to merge with the [[Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce]]. Both mergers were examined by the [[Competition Bureau]] of Canada, and ultimately rejected by [[Paul Martin]], at the time the [[Minister of Finance (Canada)|Finance Minister]] of Canada, and future [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]].

===Discrimination===
On January 15, 2007, [[CBC Radio]] reported RBC is "refusing" people of certain nationalities to open [[U.S. dollar]] accounts with the bank.&lt;ref name="CBC 2007-01-16"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/us-banking-regulators-carry-a-big-stick/article677687/ |title=U.S. banking regulators carry a big stick |accessdate=August 5, 2014 |work=The Globe and Mail |date=19 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canadian citizens with [[dual citizenship]] in Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Myanmar, North Korea or Sudan (mostly countries with U.S. sanctions) are affected. The [[U.S. Treasury Department]] restricts certain foreign nationals from using the U.S. dollar payment system to limit [[terrorism]] and [[money laundering]] after the [[September 11, 2001, attacks]]. RBC replied that compliance with such laws does not represent an endorsement by the bank and on January 17, clarified its position on the application of the U.S. laws, specifying that "with some exceptions" it does open accounts for dual citizens of the sanctioned countries.&lt;ref name="Radio-Canada 2007-01-17"&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.rbc.com/newsroom/20070117us.html |title=RBC issues clarification on U.S. dollar accounts |accessdate=2017-08-19 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070120130224/http://www.rbc.com/newsroom/20070117us.html |date=17 January 2007 |publisher=Royal Bank of Canada  
|archivedate=2007-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have also been reports that the bank has closed the accounts of some [[Iranian-Canadian]] citizens.&lt;ref name=salam&gt;{{cite news| title=Discussions on closed bank accounts between Royal Bank of Canada and Iranian groups| url=http://salamtoronto.ca/?p=17571| work=Salam Toronto| date=3 July 2013| accessdate=August 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environment===
Environmental groups have criticized RBC's financing of [[oil sands]] [[bitumen]] extraction and expansion, cumulatively issuing "more than $2.3 billion in loans and financing more than $6.9 billion in [corporate] debt between 2003 and 2007 for 13 companies including: [[EnCana]], [[Husky Energy]], [[OPTI Canada]], [[Delphi Energy]], [[Canadian Oil Sands Trust]], [[Northwest Upgrading]], [[Suncor]], [[Total S.A.|Total]], [[Connacher Oil and Gas]], [[InterPipeline]] and [[Enbridge]]."  Some environmental groups believe oil sands extraction has a detrimental effect on the northern Alberta environment.&lt;ref name="FinancialPost 2010-10-14"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://opinion.financialpost.com/2010/10/14/u-s-foundations-against-the-oil-sands/ |title=U.S. foundations against the oil sands| accessdate=August 5, 2014 |date=14 October 2010 |work=Financial Post |last=Krause |first=Vivian |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720221021/http://opinion.financialpost.com/2010/10/14/u-s-foundations-against-the-oil-sands/ |archivedate=2011-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010 Ottawa branch firebombing===
An RBC branch in [[The Glebe]] neighbourhood of [[Ottawa]] was firebombed in May 2010. The party responsible later identified themselves on [[Indymedia]] and threatened to make their presence at the upcoming [[2010 Winter Olympics]] in [[Vancouver]], as RBC was one of its key sponsors, as well as at the [[2010 G-20 Toronto summit]].&lt;ref name=taylor-jackson&gt;{{cite news| title= Police chief vows to nab 'domestic terrorists'| url=http://www.ottawasun.com/news/ottawa/2010/05/19/14010756.html| last1=Taylor| first1=Scott| last2=Jackson| first2=Kenneth| work=[[Ottawa Sun]]| date=19 May 2010| accessdate=August 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Temporary foreign workers and Canadian layoffs===
{{main|Temporary foreign worker program in Canada}}
{{See also|Amanda Lang RBC controversy}}
In April 2013, the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] reported that the Royal Bank of Canada was indirectly hiring [[Temporary resident (Canada)|temporary foreign worker]]s to replace 45 Canadian [[Information Technology]] workers.&lt;ref name=tomlinson&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/story/2013/04/05/bc-rbc-foreign-workers.html| title=RBC replaces Canadian staff with foreign workers| work=CBC News| first=Kathy| last=Tomlinson| date=6 April 2013| accessdate=August 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CBC reported on May 7, 2013, that during [[question period]] the [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|NDP]] leveled accusations against the government and then Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]], to which he responded that the government has been working on problems with the Temporary Foreign Worker Program for more than a year.&lt;ref name=harper&gt;{{cite news| title=Harper says foreign worker program is being fixed| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/story/2013/05/07/pol-cp-temporary-foreign-workers.html?cmp=rss| work=CBC News| date=7 May 2013| accessdate=August 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Samuel van den Bergh''' (6 April 1864 in [[Oss]] – 4 February 1941 in [[Nice]]) was one of the main European [[margarine]] and [[soap]] manufacturers in the early 20th century.

In 1888, the year his father, [[Simon van den Bergh]], opened his first German margarine factory in Kleve, Van den Bergh joined his father's margarine company, of which he became general director in 1909 after his father's death in 1907.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inghist.nl/Onderzoek/Projecten/BWN/lemmata/bwn3/bergh |title=Samuel van den Bergh|accessdate=14 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was initially in fierce competition with another manufacturer from [[Oss]], [[ Netherlands]]. [[Antonius Johannes Jurgens]],whose grandfather, [[Antoon Jurgens]], had founded the first margarine factory in the world in 1870 in [[Oss]] by buying a French patent and operated another German factory in nearby Goch.  Both competitors merged in 1927 to form the [[Margarine Unie]] in [[Rotterdam]] (which would merge in 1930 with [[Lever Brothers]] to form [[Unilever]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/55468705/ppl-n-org-rep|title=Organisation introduction|accessdate=14 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''She Hate Me''''' is a 2004 [[independent film|independent]] [[comedy-drama]] film directed by [[Spike Lee]] and starring [[Anthony Mackie]], [[Kerry Washington]], [[Ellen Barkin]], [[Monica Bellucci]], [[Brian Dennehy]], [[Woody Harrelson]], [[Bai Ling]] and [[John Turturro]].

The film garnered controversy, and, as with many of Lee's films, touches on [[comedy film|comedy]], [[drama film|drama]], and [[politics]].  Unlike many prior works, Spike Lee does not have an acting credit in this film.

The film was shot mostly on location in [[New York City]], including each of the city's [[five boroughs]].  It was nominated for various awards but failed to win.  ''She Hate Me'' was released in July 2004 and grossed almost half a million dollars at the [[box office]] in limited release,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0384533/business She Hate Me (2004) - Box office / business&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; with overall revenues of around $1.5 million. The shooting budget was estimated at $8 million.

==Plot==
John Henry "Jack" Armstrong ([[Anthony Mackie]]) is a financially successful and upwardly mobile executive at a [[biotechnology]] firm who, following the suicide of a colleague, Dr. Herman Schiller, is falsely accused of [[securities fraud]] by his superior, Leland Powell ([[Woody Harrelson]]). Armstrong's assets are frozen, and he finds himself unable to maintain his quality of life.

In order to make ends meet, he becomes a [[sperm donor]], initially by acquiescing to the desires of Fatima Goodrich ([[Kerry Washington]]), his ex-fiancée who came out as a [[lesbian]] and now wants a child. Although there is still unresolved bitterness and tension between them over Armstrong and Goodrich's prior relationship (as before coming out, Armstrong discovered her cheating on him with another women, who  she was having sex with), she and her girlfriend, Alex Guerrero ([[Dania Ramirez]]), offer him a substantial sum of money to impregnate them both.  This leads to Goodrich goading Armstrong into establishing a business in which groups of lesbians come over to his house and pay him $10,000 each to have sex with them in order to become pregnant. This business becomes a success, along with many of the women enjoying the intercourse with him.

One of the women whom Armstrong impregnates is the daughter of a [[Italian-American Mafia|mafia]] boss, Don Angelo Bonasera (played by [[John Turturro]]). Armstrong's employers learn of his impregnation business, and they use it in their campaign to sully his image in order to deflect attention from their own criminal business activities. Conflict is also depicted in the turbulent relationship between Armstrong's mother and his dependent diabetic father ([[Jim Brown]]).

At the film's climax, Armstrong's situation is portrayed as a ''[[cause célèbre]]'', with protests being held in support of or against him, and the news media interviewing people on the street with respect to his sexual activities. Armstrong is called before a committee of the [[United States Senate]] investigating his alleged securities fraud, where both his services to lesbians and his relationship to the "Bonasera crime family" are raised.

Armstrong's situation is compared, both by cutaway scenes and by direct reference in dialogue, to the plight of [[Frank Wills (security guard)|Frank Wills]], the [[security guard]] who discovered the break-in that led to the [[Watergate scandal]], which brought down President [[Richard M. Nixon|Nixon]]. He eventually wins the case and is seen with nineteen of the children he helped his lesbian acquaintances make at the end.

By the end of the film, Armstrong and Goodrich have come to terms with their lingering feelings for one another, and with the mutual attraction they share for Guerrero.  They then begin a three-way [[polyamory|polyamorous]] relationship, and Armstrong apparently maintains a friendship with all of the eighteen women who became pregnant by him.

==Critical reaction==
''She Hate Me'' received a sharply negative reaction from film critics, with a score of just 19% on the site [[Rotten Tomatoes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/she_hate_me/ |title=She Hate Me |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |date= |accessdate=2013-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; "It's not only unfathomable and borderline offensive, it's never-ending, leaving its bewildered and battered audience in the dark for well over two hours," wrote ''[[Detroit Free Press]]'' critic Terry Lawson. [[Roger Ebert]], who gave the film three stars out of four, said the film "will get some terrible reviews. Scorched earth reviews. Its logic, style, presumption and sexual politics will be ridiculed. The Tomatometer will be down around 20"—a spot-on prediction, as it turned out.  "Many of the things you read in those reviews may be true from a conventional point of view. Most of the critics will be on safe ground. I will seem to be wrong. Seeming to be wrong about this movie is one of the most interesting things I've done recently. I've learned from it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/she-hate-me-2004 |title=She Hate Me Movie Review &amp; Film Summary (2004) |first=Roger |last=Ebert |website=RogerEbert.com |accessdate=June 24, 2015 |date=August 6, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film grossed a total of $1,522,377 in the box office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=shehateme.htm |title=She Hate Me (2004) |publisher=Box Office Mojo |date= |accessdate=2013-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
Spike Lee based the title of the film on [[XFL]] [[American football|football]] player [[Rod Smart]], who gained some notoriety by nicknaming himself "He Hate Me". The main character in the film references Smart when explaining why he has decided to nickname his ex-fiancée "She Hate Me". The title words of this film originally were spoken by [[Boris Karloff]]'s Monster in response to the revulsion of [[Elsa Lanchester]] seeing him for the first time in the climax of ''[[Bride of Frankenstein]]''. John "Jack" Henry's name alludes to the [[John Henry (folklore)|legend of John Henry]], who worked hard against his opponent (the steel driving machine) and won, but soon afterward died of heart failure.

Actor [[Isiah Whitlock Jr.]] appears in the film as Agent Amos Flood, with the same last name of a role he played in the Spike Lee film ''[[25th Hour]]'', though there are no obvious parallels between the two films. This was the last film featuring [[Ossie Davis]], as he died in February 2005. German actor [[David Bennent]] re-appeared after a long film career absence, and portrays the German scientist who 'jumps' to his end. [[Raul Midon]] sang the theme song for the movie, "Adam 'N' Eve 'N' Eve". In the film, Armstrong's brother disapproves of his impregnating lesbians and also uses the phrase "Adam 'N' Eve 'N' Eve.

Some real human births are seen up-close in the film. A live human birth is also portrayed in another Spike Lee film, ''[[Mo' Better Blues]]''.

'''''Squawk Box Europe''''' (since May 2011, billed on-screen as just '''Squawk Box''') is a television business news programme on [[CNBC Europe]], aired from 7-10am [[Central European Time|CET]] (6-9am [[Western European Time|WET]]) each weekday. It also airs on CNBC Asia between 2.00 p.m.-5.00 p.m. [[Hong Kong]] / [[Singapore]] time (1.00 p.m.-4.00 p.m. with [[Daylight saving time|DST]]), and in the United States on CNBC World at the respective time, 1:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. - 4:00&amp;nbsp;a.m., ET. The programme is co-anchored by [[Geoff Cutmore]], [[Steve Sedgwick]] and [[Karen Tso]]. Prior to June 2003, the programme ran for only two hours, between 7.00 to 9.00 UK time but later gained an hour from ''[[Today's Business (CNBC Europe)|Today's Business]]''.

==History==
''Squawk Box Europe'' was in existence prior to CNBC Europe's merger with [[European Business News]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} Like the current version, the original version took viewers to the opening of the European markets. This version was hosted by Nigel Roberts. After the merger, it was replaced by ''[[Europe Today (CNBC Europe)|Europe Today]]'' for more than a year before being revived in 1998. The programme was originally known by the fuller title of ''CNBC Europe Squawk Box'' until it was relaunched in September 2004 as part of a wider relaunch of all of CNBC Europe's programming. From this point it used titles and graphics inspired by (but unlike the previously set, not directly derived from) CNBC US' look at the time and the show's theme music was an edited version of its US' counterpart's theme music used between 2003-2005.

On 1 December 2008, ''Squawk Box Europe'' was relaunched with a new look, logo, and music. The programme became more similar to the US version but the new look was designed specially for ''Squawk Box Europe''. [[Louisa Bojesen]] and Steve Sedgwick, previously reporters, were promoted to full co-presenters of the programme at this point, and the "News Update" segments, which had been axed by CNBC Europe some years previously, returned. [https://www.cnbc.com/id/27997245]

On 1 March 2010, ''Squawk Box Europe'', along with the rest of CNBC Europe's programmes, realigned its graphics (and title) with those of CNBC U.S. Bojesen left the programme in April 2010 to join ''[[European Closing Bell]]'', and was replaced by Anna Edwards, but she left the network at the end of 2011 and was subsequently replaced by [[Karen Tso]] (formerly of CNBC Asia).

On 9 May 2011, the programme's format received a major re-working, with the second hour of the programme being dubbed "Squawk Pre-Trade" and the third hour as "Squawk Real-Time". The programme's on air title was changed to simply "Squawk Box", in line with the US and Asian equivalents.

On 9 March 2015, ''Squawk Box Europe'' launched new titles and new theme music based on the US version.  On 27 April 2015, the [[Asia Squawk Box|Asia]] version began using the US theme music.

On 8 February 2016, both the Asian and European versions started using the remastered ''Squawk Box'' logo that has been used by their US counterpart since 4 January 2016.

==Format==
Since the May 2011 reformatting, the focus has been on the pan-European picture and the [[STOXX Europe 600]] rather than on the national indices. It covers the opening of the European markets at 8:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. WET where Tso stands in front of the video wall. 

A guest host also appears on the programme each day (during the second and third hour, like its US and Asian counterparts). Another important element of the show is its interviews with other analysts and [[chief executive officer|CEOs]] of major companies. Viewers are welcomed to email their thoughts and questions to the show's guests.

[[Maria Bartiromo]] (who was part of the original [[Squawk Box|US ''Squawk Box'']] team) served as a guest co-anchor on the show when in London to co-host the annual [[European Business Leaders Awards]] until she left CNBC altogether in November 2013.

==Supplements to the show==
The host of ''Squawk Box Europe'', Geoff Cutmore, also has a blog on [[CNBC#CNBC.com|CNBC.com]], called "Morning Thoughts".

'''Tsahi Merkur''' (צחי מרקור) is a philanthropist and an Israeli businessman, owner and CEO of the parking company [[Success Parking LTD]], and chairman of the Israel Parking Association on behalf of the Chamber of Commerce &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tsahi Merkur|url=http://www.globes.co.il/news/article.aspx?did=1000597469|website=globes.co.il/|accessdate=9 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Parking lot operator enters Azorim acquisition talks|url=http://www.globes.co.il/en/article-1000597453|website=globes.co.il|accessdate=9 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.credit1.co.il/%D7%A7%D7%98%D7%92%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%94/%D7%90%D7%A0%D7%A9%D7%99-%D7%A2%D7%A1%D7%A7%D7%99%D7%9D-%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9D/%D7%A6%D7%97%D7%99-%D7%9E%D7%A8%D7%A7%D7%95%D7%A8/|title = 64 צחי מרקור|||language = Hebrew|publisher = credit1.co.il}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Commencement of His Career and Breakthrough==
Merkur was born in 1976 and began his business activities in the business sector at the age of 16, as a high-tech entrepreneur. He studied at the Ort Singalovski School in Computers and Electronics specialty class. 	
Tsahi Merkur's breakthrough took place in the framework of his business activities on the Internet, and as a global pioneer in the field of an innovative business model entrepreneur. He was the first person in the world to incorporate commercial advertisements on the Internet, and did so even before Google and Facebook, which are leaders in the world today in the field of Internet advertising services &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.ashqelon.net/article/261540/6|title = 64 צחי מרקור הפילנטרופ ואיש העסקים משקיע באשקלון|last = Netanel|first = Elda|date = February 19, 2018|work = |accessdate = |language = Hebrew|publisher = ashqelon.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==General==
Merkur is the owner of a large international group of companies, engaged in many fields of activity, including hi-tech, internet, real estate, retail, hotel, energy, advertising, bio-acoustics and electric transportation.	
in recent years, he has been promoting voluntary activity for people in need and ill children in Israel and around the world, and has established the National Centre for Charity and Aid for those in Need &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.inn.co.il/News/News.aspx/367990|title = 64 עולם התרומות עומד להשתנות||date = March 8, 2018|work = |accessdate = |language = Hebrew|publisher = inn.co.il}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
In August 2018, Tsahi Merkur Enters into Partnership with the British Energy Giant Centrica &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://dailyinvestnews.com/tsahi-merkur-enters-into-partnership-with-energy-giant-centrica/|title = 64 Tsahi Merkur Enters into Partnership with Energy Giant Centrica||date =  August 22, 2018|work = |accessdate = |language = English|publisher = dailyinvestnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Real estate and parking lots==
In 1999, Merkur founded the parking company, the “Parking Giant”, and later "Success parking", "Reit Parking" as well as other parking companies &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tsahi Merkur|url=http://www.globes.co.il/news/article.aspx?did=1000597469|website=globes.co.il/|accessdate=9 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Parking lot operator enters Azorim acquisition talks|url=http://www.globes.co.il/en/article-1000597453|website=globes.co.il|accessdate=9 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;.	
 
In 2005, Success Parking became the largest car park company in Israel and it also began to operate public parking lots. In 2005, the company won a tender for the operation of the five largest parking lots in Tel Aviv of "Ahuzot HaHof", for the duration of two years &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.globes.co.il/news/article.aspx?did=1000597469|title = 64 צחי מרקור במגעים לרכישת 51% ממניות אזורים לפי 750 מ' ש'|last = Shauli|first = Elda|date = October 28, 2010|work = |accessdate = |language = Hebrew|publisher = globes.co.il}}&lt;/ref&gt;. As of 2013, the number of parking lots and facilities owned and operated by " Success Parking" stands at approximately one hundred &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-1000597453|title = 64 Parking lot operator enters Azorim acquisition talks||date = October 28, 2010|work = |accessdate = |language = Hebrew|publisher = en.globes.co.il}}&lt;/ref&gt;.	 
 
In 2008, Merkur acquired from [[Yitzhak Tshuva]], through Success Parking, a portfolio of nine parking facilities in the cities of Tel Aviv, Netanya, Petah Tikva and Jerusalem with 2,000 parking spaces for about 40 million [[Israeli new shekel|NIS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tsahi Merkur and Yitzhak Tshuva in a parking deal|url=http://www.globes.co.il/news/article.aspx?did=1000342973.|website=globes.co.il|accessdate=9 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Success Parking revenue for 2009 was more than $200 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SUCCESS PARKING LTD|url=http://israel-business.dundb.co.il/P532761756.aspx|website=http://israel-business.dundb.co.il|accessdate=9 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Merkur attempted to acquire a controlling share of Azorim Investment, Development and Construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Parking lot king Tsahi Merkur lines up as latest Azorim suitor|url=http://www.haaretz.com/business/parking-lot-king-tsahi-merkur-lines-up-as-latest-azorim-suitor-1.322376|website=haaretz.com|accessdate=9 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 	
 
Merkur owns real estate businesses that are partly used for vehicles parking through the "Success Assets" company, which has five branches: " Success Parking Ltd." (the largest parking lot franchise owned by him, which focuses mainly on parking lots in Tel Aviv), "Reit Parking Ltd.", Bareket Investments and Parking Ltd.", “Bezeq Parking Ltd." (for one parking lot) and "Neta Parking Ltd. " &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://rasham.bizportal.co.il/companies/printoutdetails?companyid=513614149|title = 64 נטע חניונים בע"מ||work = |accessdate = |language = Hebrew|publisher = rasham.bizportal.co.il}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
 
In March 2018, Tsahi completed an impressive 400% profit when he managed to sell a parking facility in Netanya for about 24 million NIS,  having bought it only a year earlier at 6.5 million NIS.
This achievement by Tsahi, which has already made several “exits” in the parking market, is added up to the impressive sales of parking facilities that Merkur sold in previous years. Among other things, he sold the portfolio he bought from Yitzhak Tshuva for NIS 40 million, as individual parking facilities at a total sales price of about 140 million NIS, at the timeline of approximately only 3 years. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.israelhayom.co.il/article/545463|title = 64 חניון בנתניה נמכר ב־24 מיליון ש', 400% רווח בשנה|last = Leyzerovich|first = Ilan |date = March 28, 2018|work = |accessdate = |language = Hebrew|publisher = israelhayom.co.il}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.yediot.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-5205499,00.html

One of those parking facilities is the Shtamper parking facility in Netanya, which has 79 parking spaces, which Merkur managed to sell for NIS 13 Million, a sales price that reflects NIS 164,500 per parking space, which also broke a record in Israel for parking at a public parking facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.inn.co.il/News/News.aspx/369741|title = 64 חניון בנתניה נמכר ב־24 מיליון ש"ח||date = March 29, 2018|work = |accessdate = |language = Hebrew|publisher = inn.co.il}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, Success Parking, as the largest parking company in Israel, serves about 80% of Israel's drivers, and the annual turnover of the parking group is estimated at more than $ 200 Million annually.

== Investments in start-ups ==

=== AppliCure ===
AppliCure is a company that develops, manufactures and markets software products for a network environment (Internet and intranet), and its flagship product is a software named dotDefender, which secures a variety of platforms and web-based applications.	
The company was founded in 2004 by Moshe Bassol (who served as CEO until 2010) and David Alush.
 
In 2007, AppliCure was listed for trading on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, at a company value of NIS 42 million &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-1000203613|title = 64 Applicure set for TASE IPO||date = April 19, 2007|work = |accessdate = |language = English|publisher = en.globes.co.il}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The company raised NIS 11 Million on the stock exchange, but presented losses, and soon thereafter the company lost its worth. In the reports of the fourth quarter of 2007, it already became clear that the financing round was almost exhausted, and the company was required to raise additional capital. The British fund Trafalgar Capital supported the company, but however, AppliCure was unable to recover from its losses, and ended the first quarter of 2009 with a " Going Concern Warning” notice in its reports.	
 
In July 2009, the control interest in the company (70%) was sold to the Nika Group, which was under the control of Merkur, for NIS 8 million 
&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.globes.co.il/news/article.aspx?did=1000480513|title = 64 אפליקיור מוכרת השליטה בנזיד עדשים, אבל עדיין חולמת על רווחיות|last = Shelah|first = Shmulik  |date = July 14, 2009|work = |accessdate = |language = Hebrew|publisher = globes.co.il}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In the first quarter of 2010, the Company had become profitable for the first time in its history. The Nika Group was established and managed by Tsahi Merkur (who was appointed Chairman of the AppliCure Board of Directors), Eli Hakam, and Fruition (formerly No Risk Ltd. 2004).
The company currently operates a number of business models, including SaaS (Software as a Service) and the sale of licenses. The Company currently has approximately 1,500 subscribers and customers who have purchased licenses for the system, Dot-Defender.	 

=== DRiiVZ === 
In 2011, Tsahi Merkur founded the start-up DRiiVZ, which aims to manage charging stations for electric vehicles. The company has developed a platform for online cloud management and billing. In this framework it provides solutions and software for infrastructure and charging stations for hybrid and electric vehicles and also the management and streamlining of smart energy projects.

In 2013, the management system of DRiiVZ was announced by the Dutch Elaad Fund as the world's leading management system, of all the systems examined by it. The E-laad Foundation has the largest public charging network in Europe and is the founder of the global consortium OCCP, which integrates private and public companies that are leading the field of charging infrastructure for electric cars. DRiiVZ has also developed an innovative online vehicle management platform called Vehicle-to-Grid, which enables network management of power transmission from electric vehicles to power grids, including technology that supports energy efficiency. Under this scope, DRiiVZ has integrated projects with leading energy companies in dozens of countries and is active throughout Europe, America and Australia. 

DRiiVZ, which is today a world leader in energy and electric transport, and currently serves hundreds of thousands of electric vehicle drivers worldwide, won the world competition in February 2018 and was recognized as the most innovative electric transport company in the world. The announcement came after DRiiVZ competed with 450 companies from 51 countries, surveyed by the Free Electron International Association, which integrates the largest energy companies in the world &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.talniri.co.il/marketnews/article.asp?mp=49&amp;cat=1&amp;id=87253|title = 64 צחי מרקור משלים סיבוב של 400% רווח||date = March 29, 2018|work = |accessdate = |language = Hebrew|publisher = talniri.co.il}}&lt;/ref&gt;.	
 
According to Tsahi Merkur, who believes a breakthrough in the field of transportation will be created, among other things, by electric cars, by 2030 most of the cars sold in the world will be electric, including autonomous vehicles that travel independently without a driver.

In August 2018, Tsahi Merkur has entered into a partnership with the British energy giant Centrica, which is traded and listed on the FTSE 100 on the London Stock Exchange and counts among its holdings British Gas, Scottish Power, Bord Gais Energy and many additional holdings, and has invested in Driivz, which Merkur still controls  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://dailyinvestnews.com/tsahi-merkur-enters-into-partnership-with-energy-giant-centrica/|title = 64 Tsahi Merkur Enters into Partnership with Energy Giant Centrica||date =  August 22, 2018|work = |accessdate = |language = English|publisher = dailyinvestnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
Centrica is a multi-national British energy company that provides electricity, gas and various services to tens of millions of consumers.

Centrica, through an investment arm that invests in technology companies, Centrica Innovation, has joined up with the London investment fund, Ombu Group, which specializes in investment in advanced technology companies, and together they led an investment round that raised $12 million in Driivz.  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://timebusinessnews.com/tsahi-merkur-enters-partnership-energy-giant-centrica|title = 64 Tsahi Merkur Enters into Partnership with the Energy Giant Centrica||date =  August 23, 2018|work = |accessdate = |language = English|publisher = timebusinessnews.com//}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== The National Centre for Charity and Aid for those in Need, and Voluntary Activities == 
Tsahi Merkur initiated and founded the National Centre for Charity and Aid for those in Need, which operates voluntarily and with the funding of Merkur. Its purpose is to increase the scope of donations for the people in need and for non-profit organizations in Israel, and to improve the transparency of the fundraising organizations in Israel.
 	
In addition, a charity fund which is operated entirely with Tsahi’s funding, was established in order to assist the struggling populations, especially sick children and homeless people. As part of the project, an innovative global donation system is being developed that will improve the level of transparency and the efficiency of charity organizations and foundations, and will enable the increase in the amount of donations that can be raised by non-profit organizations and charities, that manage to channel the donations to them in the best possible manner for the ultimate goal for which the donors initially intended to contribute, and also directly to those in need who will be able to reach the hearts of the donors .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.inn.co.il/News/News.aspx/367990|title = 64 עולם התרומות עומד להשתנות||date = March 8, 2018|work = |accessdate = |language = Hebrew|publisher = inn.co.il}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Tsahi's system will enable donations of food and clothing, as well as donations to those in need, charities and charity foundations.	
 
== Better Place transaction == 
Better Place is an international operation of electric vehicles, that was conceived and stirred by [[Shai Agassi]] in Israel, until October 2012, and then was established by Agassi and Idan Ofer, chairman of the Israeli Corporation, In May 2013, after investing NIS 3 Billion. After failing to raise additional funds, Better Place requested the court to appoint a liquidator, and in July 2013 the court approved the recommendation of the temporary liquidators to sell the company's activity and assets in Israel to the Sunrise group for NIS 18 Million &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.calcalist.co.il/local/articles/0,7340,L-3610913,00.html|title = 64 בית המשפט אישר: בטר פלייס תימכר לצחי מרקור ב-11 מיליון שקל||date = August 25, 2013|work = |accessdate = |language = Hebrew|publisher = calcalist.co.il}}&lt;/ref&gt;. and without payment of an advance payment. 
 
At the end of August 2013, the temporary liquidators appealed to the court to cancel the sale to the Sunrise group, and to sell the activity to Success Assets. However, this sale as well was cancelled at the request of the liquidators, out of a series of 4 consecutive sales transactions that were cancelled for four different buyers. Merkur appealed to the Supreme Court to cancel the decision to cancel the transaction, but until the appeal was heard in March 2014, the company's assets were already sold in parts, and there was no longer any reason to hear the appeal while the sale could not be re-established. The Supreme Court ruled that Merkur's Success Assets were entitled to compensation for the cancellation of the transaction.

'''WCFO''', known on air as "News/Talk 1160", is a [[Talk radio|news and talk radio]] station, licensed to [[East Point, Georgia]], serving the [[Atlanta, Georgia]] radio market.

==Programming==
Programming on WCFO includes both nationally syndicated and locally produced news, information, and [[talk radio|talk]] programs. [[Westwood One News]] News is carried at the top of most hours. WCFO broadcasts with a power of 50,000 [[watt]]s during the day with a directional antenna pattern using a four tower antenna array, and 160 watts of power at night using one antenna tower in an omnidirectional antenna pattern.

The sister station to WCFO is [[WMLB]], owned by JW Broadcasting. Prior to becoming WCFO in June 2006, the 1160 [[kHz]] facility was the home of WMLB. WWAA was sold to the owner of WMLB, JW Broadcasting, in 2006. The owner, JW Broadcasting, decided to move the WMLB call signs and format from 1160&amp;nbsp;kHz to the 1690&amp;nbsp;kHz frequency in order to increase WMLB's coverage area. The facility at 1160&amp;nbsp;kHz frequency was assigned the WCFO call sign and adopted the [[Talk radio|business talk radio]] format in June 2006.&lt;ref name="cl"&gt;{{cite news|title=Future uncertain for Air America's Atlanta affiliate|author = Abkowitz, Alyssa|date=2006-05-10 |accessdate=2007-12-11|publisher = [[Creative Loafing]] ([[Atlanta, Georgia]])|url=http://atlanta.creativeloafing.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=72926}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 1, 2008, WCFO switched to a [[news radio|news]]/[[talk radio|talk]] format.&lt;ref name="al"&gt;{{cite news|title=3/20: 1160/WCFO-AM drops business talk for Mancow, Dr. Laura, Phil Hendrie, Lou Dobbs|author = Ho, Rodney|date=2008-03-20 |accessdate=2008-04-10|publisher = [[Atlanta Journal Constitution]] ([[Atlanta, Georgia]])|url=http://www.accessatlanta.com/blogs/content/shared-blogs/accessatlanta/radiotalk/entries/2008/03/20/320_1160wcfoam.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 6, 2009, it was announced that [[Don Imus]]'s syndicated radio program, ''[[Imus in the Morning]]'', would move from [[WYAY]] (owned by the show's syndicator, [[Citadel Broadcasting]]) to WCFO.&lt;ref&gt;[http://boards.radio-info.com/smf/index.php/topic,124180.0.html Radio-Info: "Spiff and Fred to Mornings at True Oldies 106.7, Imus to WCFO 1160", 4/6/2009.]&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 16, 2010 Georgia State athletics &amp; Newstalk 1160 "The Talk of the Town" reached an agreement to serve as the official flagship radio station for [[Georgia State University|Georgia State's]] inaugural [[College football|football]] season. The station will also serve as the radio home for [[College basketball|Panther]] and men's basketball.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pr.com/press-release/227310&lt;/ref&gt;

At some point, WCFO Started airing Clemson Tigers Football from the [[Clemson Tigers Sports Network]]

==History of the 1160 frequency==
WERD was playing classic [[Rhythm and blues|R&amp;B]] when on July 4, 1995, new program director Mitch Faulkner started playing [[rap music]] at night and hired younger DJs.&lt;ref&gt;"Peach Buzz: Acting Up for a Good Cause," ''The Atlanta Constitution'', June 19, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Brown]] soon put an end to the rap because he did not like it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Vox Jox|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=September 9, 1995|volume=107|issue=38|page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In summer 1996, WERD ended its rhythm and blues format and joined the [[Prime Sports Network]] with a [[sports talk]] format. The station went off the air in 1997. Atlanta businessman Darrell Spann and Atlanta Area Broadcasting returned the station to the air in July 1998 as WKGE with a [[classic country]] format.

On  April 2, 2001, Billy Corey bought WMLB (1170 AM) in [[Cumming, Georgia]] and changed its format, and that of WKGE, to [[oldies]]—specifically oldies that had not been heard on other stations.&lt;ref name=mleach&gt;http://users.ece.gatech.edu/~mleach/radio/am.html, Retrieved on 2008/09/25.&lt;/ref&gt;

The change at WMLB did not make listeners happy. In 1995, WMLB changed from [[country music]] to [[Americana (music)|Americana]], and, although it did not reach all of Atlanta with its 5000-watt signal, it was the only station of its type in the area. The format included familiar names such as [[Willie Nelson]], [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Dolly Parton]], [[Johnny Cash]], [[Linda Ronstadt]], [[Mary Chapin Carpenter]], [[Bob Dylan]], and [[Tom Petty]], as well as less mainstream artists such as [[John Prine]], [[Guy Clark]], [[Emmylou Harris]], [[Rodney Crowell]], [[Townes Van Zandt]], [[Jerry Jeff Walker]], [[Son Volt]], [[Wilco]], [[Steve Earle]], [[Jerry Garcia]], and the Atlanta band The [[Vidalias]]. WMLB program director Chris Marino won Americana program director of the year from The [[Gavin Report]] in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Russ DeVault, "'Americana' Format at Home in Cumming," ''The Atlanta Constitution'', June 12, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bob Townsend, "A Who's Who of Newer Groups," ''The Atlanta Constitution'', November 8, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miriam Longino, "Atlanta Upstarts Capture Top National Awards," ''The Atlanta Constitution'', February 19, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

WKGE and WMLB became "The Twins: Classic 1160 and Classic 1170." WKGE planned to increase its 10,000-watt signal to 50,000 watts. The playlist included "[[Palisades Park (Freddy Cannon song)|Palisades Park]]" by [[Freddy Cannon]], "[[Galveston (song)|Galveston]]" by [[Glen Campbell]], "[[Chantilly Lace (song)|Chantilly Lace]]" by [[The Big Bopper]], "[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)#Theme music|Hawaii Five-O]]" by [[The Ventures]], "Suspicion" by [[Terry Stafford]], "Little GTO" by [[Ronny &amp; the Daytonas]], and "Yes I'm Ready" by [[Barbara Mason]]. The music collection included 9000 songs, including some by [[The Tams]] with their original lineup. General manager Ron McCarter, described as "a voracious record collector," said Americana was "not commercially viable" but also said it was "a great format." WMLB fans wished the pairing of the two stations had resulted in Americana covering the entire area.&lt;ref&gt;Miriam Longino, "Americana Fans Feeling So Blue: Radioactive: Surfing Soundwaves, Online and Off," ''The Atlanta Constitution'', April 8, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

The power boost by 1160 AM (not including the limited nighttime signal), which became WMLB, involved moving the tower from [[East Point, Georgia|East Point]] to [[Austell, Georgia|Austell]]. By 2003, when the change took effect, the stations' format was [[adult standards]] from local DJs in the morning and afternoon and the [[Music of Your Life]] network at other times, with such artists as [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Nat King Cole]], [[Tony Bennett]], [[Ella Fitzgerald]], [[Norah Jones]], and [[Diana Krall]].&lt;ref&gt;Jamie Gubrecht, "Watts Up: Station Gets a Power Boost," ''The Atlanta Journal-Constitution'', June 14, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1170 frequency left the air in 2003.&lt;ref name=mleach/&gt;

By 2005, WMLB had what was described as an "eclectic" format.&lt;ref&gt;"Scene: Radio Round-Up," ''Atlanta Journal-Constitution'', September 29, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Barron''' (1837 – 16 June 1916) was a 19th-century [[Member of Parliament]] from [[Dunedin]], New Zealand.

Born in [[St Andrews]], Scotland in 1837, Barron arrived in New Zealand in 1851. He first spent time as a miner and merchant on the Otago goldfields before engaging in business in Dunedin. He served as Grand Master of the New Zealand Lodge of Freemasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=ODT19160617.2.101 | title=Obituary: Mr Wm.

'''William Jaird Levitt''' (February 11, 1907 – January 28, 1994) was an American [[real-estate developer]] from [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City]]. As president of [[Levitt &amp; Sons]], he is widely credited as the father of modern American [[Suburbs|suburbia]]. He was named one of [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' Magazine]]'s "100 Most Influential People of the 20th Century."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,26473,00.html |title=Time 100 Persons Of The Century |publisher=Time |date=June 6, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Levitt was born in 1907 to a [[Jew]]ish family. His generation was the second since immigrating from Russia and Austria;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.jewishtimes.com/index.php/jewishtimes/news/jt/national_news/%20how_jews_both_segregated_and_integrated_levittown/10496 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110608090427/http://www.jewishtimes.com/index.php/jewishtimes/news/jt/national_news/%20how_jews_both_segregated_and_integrated_levittown/10496 | archivedate = June 8, 2011 | date = February 9, 2009 | title = How Jews both Segregated and Integrated Levittown | first = Peter | last = Ephross | newspaper = Baltimore Jewish Times | accessdate = December 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the paternal grandparents who immigrated to the United States had been a [[rabbi]] grandfather from Russia and a grandmother from Austria-Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yh0nM4sIH14C|title=Levittown: The First 50 Years|last=Ferrer|first=Margaret Lundrigan|last2=Navarra|first2=Tova|date=1997-03-01|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|isbn=9780738562285|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Levitt grew up in [[Brooklyn]], New York.&lt;ref name=nytobit&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/29/obituaries/william-j-levitt-86-pioneer-of-suburbs-dies.html |title=William J. Levitt, 86, Pioneer of Suburbs, Dies |last=Pace |first=Eric |date=January 29, 1994 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=2017-07-26 |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was Abraham Levitt, a British-born&lt;ref name=triumph&gt;{{cite triumph|pages=174-77}}&lt;/ref&gt; real estate attorney and part-time investor; his mother was Pauline Biederman. A younger brother, Alfred, was born when William was five years old. William received a public school education at Public School 44 and [[Boys High School (Brooklyn)|Boys High School]].&lt;ref name=nytobit/&gt; He then attended [[New York University]] for three years, but dropped out before graduating.&lt;ref name=nytobit/&gt;&lt;ref name=triumph /&gt;

== Levitt &amp; Sons ==
=== 1920s-1930s ===
In 1929, William's father Abraham founded a [[Real estate developer|real-estate development]] company called [[Levitt &amp; Sons]]. Levitt &amp; Sons built mostly upscale housing on and around [[Long Island|Long Island, New York]], in the 1930s. William Levitt served as company president, overseeing all aspects of the company except for the designs of the homes they built, which fell to William's brother Alfred.&lt;ref name=triumph /&gt;

=== After World War II ===
During [[World War II]], Levitt served in the Navy as a [[lieutenant]] in the [[Seabee]]s. After returning from the war, he saw a need for affordable housing for returning veterans. America's post-war prosperity and [[baby boom]] had created a crisis of affordable housing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = 1951: American dream houses, all in a row | first=Jon | last=Blackwell | newspaper=[[The Trentonian]] | url=http://www.capitalcentury.com/1951.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even before returning from the war, Levitt had experimented with mass housing projects, building a 1,600-shack community in [[Norfolk, Virginia]], which was not a success - units remained unsold in 1950.&lt;ref name=triumph /&gt; Levitt &amp; Sons' first successful housing development was located on almost {{convert|20|sqmi}} of land near [[Hempstead (village), New York|Hempstead, Long Island]] and was named [[Levittown, New York|Levittown]]. The [[assembly line]] construction method enabled Levit to build more efficiently than other developers at the time, with teams of specialized workers following each other from house to house to complete incremental steps in the construction.&lt;ref name = "Time100" /&gt; Levitt also reduced costs by freezing out union labor &amp;ndash; a move which provoked picket lines &amp;ndash; enabling him to use the latest technology, such as spray painting. He also cut out middlemen and purchased many items, including lumber and televisions, directly from manufacturers, as well as constructing his own factory to produce nails. The building of every house was reduced to 27 steps,&lt;ref name = "Time100"/&gt; and sub-contractors were responsible for each step. His mass production of thousands of houses at virtually the same time allowed Levitt to sell them, fully furnished with modern appliances, for as little as $8,000 each ($65,000 in 2009 dollars), which, with the [[G.I. Bill]] and Federal housing subsidies, reduced the up-front cost of a house to many buyers to around $400.&lt;ref name= triumph /&gt;

Levitt was the cover story in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine for July 3, 1950, with the tag line "For Sale: a new way of life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | author=Staff| url = http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,1101500703,00.html | title = House Builder Levitt, For Sale: a new way of life | date = July 3, 1950 | magazine = [[Time (magazine)|Time]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Levitt &amp; Sons' president, Levitt proposed and constructed other East Coast developments throughout the 1960s. In 1952, people started buying over 17,000 Levitt-built homes in [[Bucks County, Pennsylvania]]. In addition, the company built [[Willingboro, New Jersey]], which still has street names such as Levitt Parkway. During the late 1950s, Levitt and Sons constructed "Belair at Bowie" in [[Bowie, Maryland|Bowie]], [[Maryland]]. In the early 1960s, the company built a 5,000-house community in north central New Jersey called Strathmore-at-Matawan.

William took control of Levitt &amp; Sons in 1954, after splitting with Alfred.&lt;ref name=nytobit/&gt; The company went public in 1960. During the 1960s, when Levitt was leading the company, Levitt &amp; Sons developed properties beyond the American mainland, such as [[Levittown, Puerto Rico]]; [[Lésigny, Seine-et-Marne|Lésigny]] in [[Seine-et-Marne]]; and [[Mennecy]] in [[Essonne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |author=Staff |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,898440,00.html |title=France: A Lesson from Levitt |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=December 10, 1965 |accessdate=2011-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 1960s, Levitt had become one of the richest men in America, with a fortune estimated in excess of $100 million. He lived in a lavish 30-room mansion on his "La Coline" estate in [[Mill Neck, New York]], and spent much of his time on ''La Belle Simone'', his {{convert|237|ft|m}} [[yacht]] named after his third wife.&lt;ref name="William Levitt"&gt;{{Cite web|title = William Levitt|url = http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/197662|website = Entrepreneur.com|accessdate = 2015-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Segregation===
Levitt refused to integrate his developments. The Jewish Levitt barred Jews from Strathmore, his first pre-Levittown development on Long Island in New York, and he refused to sell his homes to blacks. His sales contracts also forbade the resale of properties to blacks through [[restrictive covenants]], although in 1957 a Jewish couple resold their house to the first black family to live in a Levitt home.&lt;ref&gt;Ephross, Peter (February 9, 2009) [https://web.archive.org/web/20110608090427/http://www.jewishtimes.com/index.php/jewishtimes/news/jt/national_news/%20how_jews_both_segregated_and_integrated_levittown/10496/ "How Jews both Segregated and Integrated Levittown"] ''[[Baltimore Jewish Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Levitt's all-white policies also led to civil rights protests in [[Bowie, Maryland]] in 1963.&lt;ref name="William Levitt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="biography.yourdictionary.com"/&gt;  The [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] and the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] opposed Levitt’s racist policies, and the [[Federal Housing Administration]] prepared to refuse mortgages on his next Levittown. Nevertheless, Levitt would not back down and continued planning another whites-only Levittown in [[Willingboro, New Jersey|Willingboro Township, New Jersey]]. He fought legal challenges in [[New Jersey]] courts until the [[United States Supreme Court]] refused to hear his case.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson, Joanne (April 14
, 2009) [http://forward.com/culture/104767/jew-vs-jew-in-levittown/ "Jew vs Jew in Levittown"] ''[[The Forward]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2003 [[PBS]] series ''[[Race: The Power of an Illusion]]'', by [[California Newsreel]], features Levittown and nearby [[Roosevelt, New York|Roosevelt]] in documenting systemic racism in the development of the early suburbs.

=== Company sale ===
After he had built over 140,000 houses around the world, then 60-year-old Levitt sold the company to [[ITT Corporation|ITT]] for $92 million (${{Inflation|US|92|1967|r=-1|fmt=c}} million today) in July 1967, of which $62 million was in the form of ITT stock. ITT made Levitt president of the renamed Levitt Corp., on condition that Levitt could not move to another United States home building company for ten years.&lt;ref name = "Time100"/&gt; He entered the agreement thinking he would play an active role in ITT affairs, but executives felt Levitt was too old to take on more responsibility.&lt;ref name="biography.yourdictionary.com"&gt;[http://biography.yourdictionary.com/william-levitt "William Levitt"] ''Your Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt; 

Levitt remained president under ITT until 1972. During that time he led the subsidiary's development of housing projects in [[Palm Coast, Florida]]; [[Richmond, Virginia]]; and [[Fairfax, Virginia]].{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

== Later years and death ==
After the restriction against Levitt moving to a new home building company in the United States expired, he was unable to repeat the success he had achieved with Levitt &amp; Sons. He established a series of companies and joint ventures through the 1970s and 1980s&lt;ref name=LevittCommunities&gt;{{cite web | url = http://levittownbeyond.com/LevittCommunities.html | title = Levitt Communities | publisher = LevittownBeyond.com | accessdate = 3 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which failed. The ITT stock he often used for collateral on these ventures lost 90% of its value, saddling him with great debt.&lt;ref name=nytobit/&gt; 

He was accused of misappropriation of funds from the charitable Levitt Foundation and agreed to repay $5 million,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/24/magazine/tough-times-for-mr-levittown.html?pagewanted=all |title=Tough Times For Mr. Levittown |last=Kaufman |first=Michael T. |date=September 24, 1989 |newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; more than $5 million&lt;ref name=nytobit/&gt; or $11 million (in 1992).&lt;ref name=WP&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1994/01/30/william-j-levitt-pioneer-of-postwar-suburbia-dies/5b966bf8-0a69-436c-aa0b-4f3a8e63ed95/ |title=William J. Levitt, Pioneer of Postwar Suburbia, Dies |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=January 30, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Levitt died on January 28, 1994, at the age of 86.&lt;ref name=nytobit/&gt;&lt;ref name="biography.yourdictionary.com"/&gt;

==Legacy==
William Levitt came to symbolize the new suburban growth with his use of mass-production techniques to construct large developments of houses, eponymously named Levittowns, selling for under $10,000.  Many other relatively inexpensive suburban developments soon appeared throughout the country.  While he did not invent the building of communities of affordable single-family homes within driving distance of major areas of employment, his innovations in providing affordable housing popularized this type of planned community in the years following [[World War II]].&lt;ref name = "Time100"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,989781-1,00.html | title= Suburban Legend William Levitt | first = Richard | last = Lacayo | date = December 7, 1998 | newspaper = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | accessdate = October 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His nicknames included "The King of Suburbia" &lt;ref name="therealdeal.com"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://therealdeal.com/issues_articles/william-levitt-the-king-of-suburbia/ | title = William Levitt: The king of suburbia | date = April 30, 2008 | first = Matt | last = Schneiderman | newspaper = [[The Real Deal (magazine)|The Real Deal]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Inventor of the Suburb."  At his height, when he was completing one suburban house every 16 minutes,&lt;ref&gt;[[David Halberstam|Halberstam, David]] (1997) ''The Fifties: "The Fear and the Dream"'' (documentary)&lt;/ref&gt; Levitt compared his successes to those of [[Henry Ford]]'s automobile assembly line.&lt;ref name="therealdeal.com"/&gt; ''Time'' magazine recognized Levitt as one of the "100 Most Important People of the 20th Century" in 1998.&lt;ref name= "Time100" /&gt;

Levitt was awarded the [[Frank P. Brown Medal]] in 1965.
