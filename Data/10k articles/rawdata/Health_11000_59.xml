Founded in 2000, ADI's goal is to improve the health of people in remote and rural areas of [[Papua New Guinea]]. ADI specialises in ''Doctor Supervised Integrated Health Patrols'', deploying volunteer doctors and health managers to work in partnership with local health providers to provide [[medical treatment]] to save lives and reduce suffering, community [[health education]] to reduce preventable illness and disease, and training to build the capacity of local [[health worker]]s.

It was founded in 2000 by former Manly Mayor, politician and general practitioner, Dr [[Peter Macdonald (Australian politician)|Peter Macdonald]]. The organisation first started working in [[Western Province (Papua New Guinea)|Western Province]] in partnership with the Catholic Diocese of Daru-Kiunga to help support their rural health network and services. In 2011 ADI expanded its program to remote and rural areas of [[New Ireland Province]] in partnership with the Provincial Government.

Its key achievements include: 
* Deployed more than 30 volunteer doctors on over 38 assignments;
* Distributed 50,000+ malaria bed nets to remote villages in Western Province
* Ran a six-year Mass Drug Administration program to eliminate lymphatic filariasis in the Nomad-Mougulu region of Western Province
* Ran a HIV/AIDS awareness radio program
* Introduced a leprosy treatment, education and advocacy program for a community of over 30 leprosy patients in the Bosset region of Western Province,
* Started an annual in-service health training workshop for over 100 health workers in [[Western Province (Papua New Guinea)|Western Province]], a first for many participants.

As part of its''Doctor Supervised Integrated Health Patrols'', ADI’s volunteers travel by plane, boat and foot to remote and rural health centres, aid posts and hospitals to provide essential health care to people living in extreme poverty. Western Province, which is located on the border with West Papua, consists of raging rivers, steep mountain ranges up to 8,000m, vast floodplains and dense jungle. New Ireland Province, which is located off the mainland in the far northeast of PNG, consists of many isolated islands separated by rough seas. It can take weeks to complete a patrol in places such as the [[Star Mountains]] and [[Awaba River]] region in Western Province or Konoagil (otherwise known as The Last Corner by locals) in New Ireland Province.

ADI's services include:

'''1. Medical treatment:''' To help save lives and reduce suffering, ADI’s doctors currently treat more than 3,500 patients every year. Some people have never seen a doctor before, others only once every couple of years. Consequently, ADI's doctors see many people in advanced stages of disease that could have been prevented. Common diseases and illnesses include malaria and tuberculosis, leprosy, lymphatic filariasis, muscular skeletal, respiratory and serious eye problems.

'''2. Training and education:''' To help strengthen the capacity of local health workers, ADI’s doctors conduct case-based training during clinics and teach medical education sessions. Every year, ADI also facilitates an in-service health training which brings together health staff from various locations for a week of intensive learning with local and expatriate health experts.

'''3. School and community health education:''' Many lives are lost due to a lack of knowledge about how diseases are caused, prevented and treated. To help with this, ADI’s doctors and health managers deliver health education talks which address PNG national health priorities and target specific groups. In 2010-2011, ADI’s volunteers gave health talks to over 15,000 adults and school children in Western Province.

Where possible, ADI's doctors work alongside local health workers who perform parallel services including infant [[immunisation]]s, eye/ear testing and dental. In New Ireland Province, ADI travels with a large team of provincial and district health staff who undertake community health promotion, health centre management and dental, disease control and environmental health activities.

Approved by AusAID as an OADGR, ADI is a member of ACFID and a signatory to its Code of Conduct. ADI aims for continuous improvement in health indicators as a result of its activities through the use of a structured monitoring and evaluation framework.

PNG has not shown any sustained improvement in health since 2002. It is unlikely to meet any of the [[UN Millennium Goals]], especially those on [[child and maternal mortality]]. Rural areas - where 86% of the population lives - are particularly disadvantaged, with 30% of health aid posts closed. The rest are often run-down and under-resourced. [[Doctor shortage]] is a major problem. Western Province has just 14 doctors - all urban based - for 212,000 people spread far and wide. This includes one doctor per 8,800 people in North Fly District and no doctor for 74,800 in Middle Fly District. New Ireland Province has just 10 local doctors - all based at Kavieng Hospital - for 160,000 people. Due to heavy workloads and lack of funding, they rarely visit rural health centres and aid posts.

Forty percent of deaths in PNG are caused by six diseases that can be easily and inexpensively treated at aid posts. Diseases such as malaria, [[tuberculosis]], [[pneumonia]], [[diarrhea]]l diseases, [[meningitis]] and [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] account for about half of all deaths in PNG. Of every 1,000 children born, 69 will die before age five and another 53 won’t even survive their [[infancy]]. Five women [[Death in childbirth|die in childbirth]] every day and only two in five deliver at a health facility.

PNG also has:
- The highest rate of malaria in the [[Western Pacific Ocean|Western Pacific]], a leading cause of death in children under five in PNG;
- The highest rate of lymphatic filariasis (elephantiasis) in the world, with over 1 million people infected;
- The highest rate of HIV/AIDS in the Pacific region - an estimated 34,000 people are HIV-positive;
- The second highest incidence of leprosy in Western Province, despite the disease being treatable and virtually eradicated elsewhere in PNG;
- High incidence of intestinal diseases, such as [[cholera]] and [[typhoid]], due to contaminated food and water;
- A worsening medical [[supply chain]] - only 50% of health centres/hospitals have adequate stocks of the most basic essential medicines.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27048">[[File:Harold Grove LS6 8 July 2017.jpg|thumb|300px|Street-fronted back-to-back terraces in Harold Grove, Leeds]]
'''Back-to-backs''' are a form of [[terraced houses in the United Kingdom]], built from the late 18th century through to the early 20th century in various guises. Many thousands of these dwellings were built during the [[Industrial Revolution]] for the [[urbanisation|rapidly increasing population]] of expanding [[factory town]]s. Back-to-backs share [[party wall]]s on three of their four sides, with the front wall having the only door and windows.

As back-to-backs were built as the cheapest possible housing for the impoverished working class, their construction was usually sub-standard. Their configuration did not allow for sufficient ventilation or sanitation. Toilets and water supplies were shared with multiple households in enclosed courtyards. Back-to-backs gained an unfavourable reputation for poor levels of health and hygiene.

Around the mid-19th century, [[Pre-regulation terraced houses in the United Kingdom|this form of housing]] was deemed unsatisfactory and a hazard to health. The passage of the [[Public Health Act 1875]] permitted [[municipal corporation]]s to ban new back-to-backs, replaced in the next phase of building by [[byelaw terraced house]]s. [[Leeds City Council]] opted not to enforce the ban however; the popularity of back-to-back houses with builders and residents led to their continued construction in Leeds until the 1930s.

Most back-to-backs were demolished in waves of [[slum clearance]]s, although many remain in Leeds and Bradford. Birmingham and Liverpool, where many thousands of these homes were built, each chose to retain a single example as a tourist attraction. The [[Birmingham Back to Backs]] is now operated as a [[historic house museum]] by the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]]; other museum examples of back-to-back houses are managed by the [[Museum of Liverpool]] and [[Bradford Industrial Museum]].

==Description==
[[File:Back-to-back court- Birmingham.svg|thumb|A typical yard of 14 back-to-back houses. Note the shared "privies" (outdoor toilets) and "wash houses"]]
Low quality houses were constructed for [[working class]] people at a high density, with scant regard for space, comfort or quality of life. Most back-to-backs were small: early examples had just a single room on each floor, while later houses were [[two-up two-down]]. Every house shared a rear wall, whether with a house directly behind or with an industrial building. Given that the house usually shared three of its four walls with neighbouring buildings, back-to-back houses were notoriously ill-lit and poorly ventilated.&lt;ref name="bbc_insideout"/&gt; Such was the initial lack of consideration for hygiene, that some houses were found to have been built over open drains covered only by boards.{{sfn|Engels|1844|p=37}}

The term "back-to-back" should not be confused with "through" [[terrace house|terraced houses]], the backs of which face each other across an alleyway, and are thus not contiguous like a true back-to-back. Back-to-back houses can also be known as blind-backs,&lt;ref name="historic_england_blindback"/&gt; particularly when built up against factory walls, or occasionally as a terrace of houses standing on its own.

==History==
===Early houses===
[[File:Backtoback1893.jpg|thumb|right|Back-to-back housing courtyard, 1883]]
Population in the city of Leeds was around 30 000 by 1800, which later doubled and then tripled, creating a problem of insufficient housing. The first back-to-back houses were built by 1790 in [[Briggate, Leeds]], by opportunists who realised the structural setup allowed for a cost saving by not requiring roads or drainage,{{sfn|Ravetz|2013|p=15}} with [[population density]] housing up to 300 people in 60–75 properties per acre. There was no universally accepted blueprint for how the houses should be constructed; the worst (and often earliest) had a single room on each floor and no [[damp proofing]]. Sanitation comprised [[Pail closet#Earth closet system|earth toilet]]s in whatever available space existed, which may have been underneath bedrooms, and a public water supply from intermittent [[Standpipe (street)|standpipes]].{{sfn|Ravetz|2013|p=17}} Initially, houses were built around a communal courtyard, but later they were built onto streets.&lt;ref name="secretlibraryleeds"/&gt; Houses of this type had become common in [[inner city]] areas of [[Victorian era|Victorian]] England, especially in [[Birmingham]], [[Bradford]],&lt;ref name="bfhis"/&gt; [[Leeds]], [[Liverpool]], [[Manchester]], [[City of Salford|Salford]] and in [[Nottingham]], where about 7500 of their 11 000 houses (roughly 68 per cent){{sfn|Engels|1844|p=37}} were built back-to-back. Town authorities were well aware that back-to-backs were undesirable, but seemed unable to prevent their construction. The Building and Improvement Committee reported to Bradford Council that more than three-quarters of new dwellings were "laid out upon that objectionable principle".&lt;ref name="bfhis"/&gt; The passage of the [[Artisans' and Labourers' Dwellings Improvement Act 1875]] gave councils permission to [[compulsory purchase]] slum housing, but few took advantage of the opportunity.&lt;ref name="parliament_keydates"/&gt;

During the 18th and 19th centuries, owners of mills and mines built significant numbers of back-to-backs to maximize the number of workers that could live in the least amount of space, while keeping costs low. Advocates of the design suggested that they were easier to keep warm owing to their single outside wall, but the absence of rear yards meant there was no space for exterior toilets, only communal ones that spread diseases rapidly.&lt;ref name="guardian_comeback"/&gt; In the oldest parts of Birmingham, early back-to-back houses were associated with filth, poor ventilation and pools of stagnant water, despite being home to the greatest number of working-class people within the city.{{sfn|Engels|1844|p=37}}

===19th century===
[[File:Plans an pictures of back-to-back houses in Nottingham. Wellcome L0011651.jpg|thumb|Plans for houses in Nottingham, 1844]]
Rapid [[Urbanization|urbanisation]] led to fields and [[Allotment (gardening)|allotments]] disappearing in favour of cheaply built houses, often tightly packed together into the smallest space available. Houses were built on top of inadequate foundations and with substandard materials to reduce costs. Each house was separated by a single brick depth with a small room on each floor; ground-floor rooms served multiple purposes, as the remaining available space was used for bedrooms.&lt;ref name="birmingham_backintime"/&gt; By the 1830s, back-to-back houses had gained a reputation nationwide for spreading disease, and major cities including Manchester and Liverpool prohibited their construction in the 1840s and 1860s respectively. The Leeds Improvement Act of 1866 imposed regulations on the building of new houses, which included gated yards, wider streets and improved interior design. The [[Medical Officer for Health]] unsuccessfully sought to abolish their construction in about 1880,{{sfn|Ravetz|2013|p=17}} by which time population density had improved to 200 people living in 50–60 houses per acre.{{sfn|Ravetz|2013|p=18}}

Significant change came with the introduction of the [[byelaw terraced house]] to comply with the [[Public Health Act 1875]]. Further improvements were introduced in 1890, such as the inclusion of a basement or ground-floor kitchen, a small garden and a private toilet for each household.{{sfn|Ravetz|2013|p=18}} Subsequent acts including the [[Housing of the Working Classes Act 1885]] and the [[Housing of the Working Classes Act 1890]] imposed additional construction requirements.

Leeds appears to have been a special case. Figures from 1899 suggest that 72 per cent of all houses constructed annually in that city were back-to-back, identical to 15 years prior, a percentage that did not decrease until 1914. Small families with children in the city had little choice but to live in back-to-back houses, as they dominated the affordable market.{{sfn|Jordon|1987|p=238}} It was anticipated that the byelaw terraced house regulation would prevent the construction of back-to-back houses, yet Leeds Council initially opted not to enforce it, particularly where building contractors unmotivated by social or aesthetic considerations could influence decisions to ensure their own contracts and interests were put ahead of build quality. Consequently, the density of housing in some areas, as well as its manner of construction, had adverse effects on sale and rental prices, particularly as other towns offered houses with greater space and improved sanitation; a new property built in [[Sunderland]] would have been provided with its own [[water closet]], while a new property in Leeds may have had one shared, up until 1912.{{sfn|Ley|2000|p=46}}

===20th century===
[[Image:Back_to_backs_with_washing.jpg|thumb|With no rear yard, across-street washing lines were employed with a [[pulley]] operated from street level.]]

====Before the First World War====
By the turn of the 20th century, back-to-back houses had become unpopular with residents and the government, who sought to ban their construction and eradicate existing properties nationwide. Among the primary concerns cited were health and ventilation, as statistics were revealing that residents of back-to-back houses suffered from relatively poor health. In Manchester, Dr [[James Niven]] noted that mortality rates among those living in back-to-back houses exceeded those from through-houses by 40 per cent, along with an increased incidence of infectious diseases and [[diarrhoea]]. A change in the law in 1909 forbade the erection of this style of house.&lt;ref name="clause44prohibition_1909"/&gt;

====Between the wars====
The advent of [[council housing]] after the First World War resulted in councils organising programmes of statutory [[slum clearance]]s as part of [[Public housing in the United Kingdom#Statutory slum clearance plans|post-war housing redevelopment]] programmes. Such initiatives gathered pace in the 1920s, with the beginning of mass demolition of back-to-back houses and the construction of [[Council house#Homes fit for heroes (1918–1923)|"homes fit for heroes"]].&lt;ref name="social_housing_history"/&gt;

In Leeds during the early 20th century, the local council had spent about £1 million (equivalent to £{{format price|{{inflation|UK-GDP|1000000|1909|r=-5}}}} in {{inflation-year|UK-GDP}}{{inflation-fn|UK-GDP|df=y|group=lower-alpha}}) in acquiring older, inadequate back-to-back houses for demolition,&lt;ref name="clause44prohibition_1909"/&gt; while continuing to build improved ones of a similar style until  1937, despite being outlawed in 1909&lt;ref name="guardian_comeback"/&gt; when it was decided that houses should be of an overall higher quality.{{sfn|Hey|1996|p=32}} By 1926, Leeds had 72 000 of these houses, of which 32 000 were described by [[Christopher Addison, 1st Viscount Addison|Dr Christoper Addison]] as being "abominations", having been condemned as unfit for many years by that time, despite still being lived in;&lt;ref name="millbank_02121926"/&gt; only 12 000 (less than 17 per cent) were given a moderate health pass by [[Neville Chamberlain]]'s{{sfn|Pepper|Richmond|2009|loc=Homes unfit for heroes}} Unhealthy Areas Committee.{{sfn|Giles|2003|loc=What I Saw in the Slums}} Other cities had smaller numbers, such as Bradford {{nowrap|(33 000)}} and Nottingham (5000) respectively.&lt;ref name="millbank_slumclearance"/&gt; [[Member of parliament#United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland|MP]] [[John Birchall|Sir John Birchall]] described Leeds in 1930 as having "an unenviable notoriety for its back-to-back houses", although popularity among residents had increased. He unsuccessfully proposed in 1930 to permit the construction of back-to-back houses in blocks of four, given that back-to-backs were generally cheaper to build than standard through houses and that having two external walls per property would alleviate the ventilation concerns that plagued earlier residences.&lt;ref name="millbank_07041930"/&gt;

====After the Second World War====
Following the Second World War and [[the Blitz]] aerial bombing of industrial cities, Britain was ready for a new wave of slum demolition and construction of more suitable housing. For example, Birmingham had about 40 000 back-to-backs in 1931&lt;ref name="millbank_publicassistance"/&gt; but only 29 182 by September 1946.&lt;ref name="millbank_birmingham_slum_clear"/&gt;

In Leeds around 1953, there were 30 000 people waiting for council housing, of which 16,000 comprised back-to-back housing built before 1844 that were pending clearance as slum housing.&lt;ref name="millbank_1927_slumclear"/&gt; Prior to 1844, the quality was sub-standard and 16 000 of these were inhabited during 1951, compared to a further 28 000 slightly better houses, which had been constructed between 1844 and 1874. The pre-1844 houses were by that time in a state of disrepair and overcrowding was a concern, particularly when families were occupying what was originally intended for single or dual occupancy.&lt;ref name="millbank_birmingham_housing"/&gt;

By 1959, Leeds and Birmingham each had 60 000 back-to-back houses, and Members of Parliament were calling for the demolition to be accelerated.&lt;ref name="millbank_1959birmingham_housing"/&gt; [[William Wheeldon]], a [[Labour and Co-operative]] MP, pointed out that "the most distressing thing" was that little had changed in generations:
{{Quote|text=Its chief defect, in addition to its lack of size, its dampness and its dilapidation, is that it is not self-contained. There is no water supply inside the house, no adequate provision for discharging slop water, and the only sanitary convenience is often some distance from the house and usually common to two or more houses. This convenience is frequently in a revolting condition because of its common user. There is no bath or means of taking a bath in many of the houses. The whole outlook from these houses is sullied by soot besmirched in a soot-laden atmosphere.

Many of those houses, I am sorry to say, are in my constituency [i.e. [[Birmingham Small Heath (UK Parliament constituency)|Birmingham Small Heath]]]. They are houses from which men went out more than forty years ago to fight in the 1914–1918 war. They were told that they were to have homes for heroes, yet the sons of those men went out from the same houses in 1939 to fight for their country, and many of those houses are still standing today.&lt;ref name="millbank_1959birmingham_housing"/&gt;}}

Nationwide demolition continued through the 1960s{{sfn|Hey|1996|p=32}} and 1970s. Towards the end of the 1970s, Leeds was the second largest city outside London that still had around 30,000 back-to-back houses.&lt;ref name="millbank_purchase_improvement"/&gt; By the 1980s, most towns had few or no back-to-backs remaining.

Leeds and its surrounding region is the only area where back-to-back houses still exist in large numbers, having been refurbished to include [[Modern convenience|"mod cons"]] such as indoor bathrooms and central heating. These modernised back-to-backs are popular with residents because they are easier to maintain than typical houses. The houses have proved to be popular with [[buy to let]] investors, who helped to increase prices significantly during the early-mid 2000s. The house style is also popular among student populations, as little exterior maintenance is required and they are often close to universities and colleges, particularly in the areas of [[Headingly]], [[Burley, Leeds|Burley]] and [[Kirkstall]].&lt;ref name="guardian_comeback"/&gt;

Although banned by existing [[Building regulations in the United Kingdom|building regulations]] for new builds, architects are keen for the regulations to be relaxed, particularly as many of the historical health concerns associated with back to-back-housing, such as open sewers and communal toilets, are no longer relevant.&lt;ref name="guardian_comeback"/&gt;

A study was conducted in 2008 to canvass the views of the communities living in these properties, to help ensure that they could continue in use into the 21st century. Seventy-five per cent of those questioned suggested that the heritage value of the houses was important to the identity of Leeds. Overall, 51 per cent of respondents were positive, and 45 per cent felt negatively towards them. Residents of these back-to-backs generally felt strongly about their heritage value, but their opinions were not valued as highly as non-residents or professionals. Despite the feedback, there was insufficient recognition that the properties should be protected because of their perceived heritage value.{{sfn|Chitty|2016|p=205}}

==Preservation as museums==
[[File:Birmingham Back to Backs exterior.jpg|thumb|The exterior of the Birmingham back-to-backs, with shops and courtyard entrance]]
The [[Birmingham Back to Backs]] are a [[historic house museum]] created by [[The National Trust]] for the city's last remaining back-to-back houses. The dweillings are furnished as they would have been in the 19th century and are now [[Listed buildings in Birmingham|Grade II listed buildings]].&lt;ref name="birmingham_national_trust"/&gt; According to the BBC, this is the last example of such housing grouped around a court.&lt;ref name="bbc_insideout"/&gt;

[[File:Birmingham Back to Backs interior.jpg|thumb|left|The courtyard]]
In [[Liverpool]], back-to-back court housing was once home to more than 40 per cent of its population,&lt;ref name="livecho_bid2016preserve"/&gt; before demolition during the 1960s and 1970s as part of slum house clearance programmes. A set of nine pairs of these houses survived and were restored as part of a museum attraction.&lt;ref name="jra_journal"/&gt; A proposal to preserve and restore the city's last surviving court housing block was made in 2016, with structural work taking place to secure the building, as well as a new roof to prevent further water damage. The project would complement the existing court dwellings at the [[Museum of Liverpool]] which opened in 2011 and recreates a former street from 1870 in the area around [[Scotland Road]].&lt;ref name="livecho_bid2016preserve"/&gt;

The [[Bradford Industrial Museum]] has a block of back-to-backs decorated as dwellings of 1875, the Second World War, and the 1970s.&lt;ref name="bfim"/&gt;

'''Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University''' ({{lang-bn|বঙ্গবন্ধু শেখ মুজিব মেডিকেল বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়}}) is the first public medical [[university]] in [[Bangladesh]] established in 1998. The university offers courses like [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]], [[PhD]], MS, [[MPhil]], MDS, Diploma and FCPS. There is no undergraduate medical or dental course.

== History ==
[[File:Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (02).jpg|thumb|Portal of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University]]
Establishment of the Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University was an upgrade of the '''Institute of Postgraduate Medicine and Research (IPGMR)'''. IPGMR was established in December 1965, as a Government-controlled postgraduate institute for medical research and studies.  It was housed in the now defunct Hotel Shahbag, once the biggest hotel in [[Dhaka]]. The neighbourhood got its name [[Shahbag]] from the name of the hotel.

From 2010, many of the medical and public health colleges/institutes have become affiliated to BSMMU. For example, BIRDEM, BIHS, DMC, NICVD, NITOR and others.

Many foreigners, notably from Nepal and Bhutan, study at the university.

It was renamed as Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University by the Act 1, 1998 of [[Jatiyo Sangshad]] after the first [[President of Bangladesh]], Bangabandhu [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]].&lt;ref name="bsmmu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bsmmu.org/|title=Welcome to Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University Website|publisher=Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University|accessdate=2008-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organization ==
The university is an autonomous body governed by a 24-member syndicate. BSMMU comprises 42 departments under 6 faculties. The university campus is located at [[Shahbag]] and has a 1900-bed hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bangla2000.com/Education/Study_in_Bangladesh/Universities/BSMMU.shtm|title=Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University|work=Portal|publisher=Bangla2000|accessdate=2008-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BSMMU has an academic library known as BSMMU Central Library, and a digital library. The University publishes a peer-reviewed medical journal [[Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University Journal]]. It publishes 4 issue per year.

'''Branchio-oculo-facial syndrome''' (BOFS)&lt;ref name=Milunsky2008 /&gt; is a disease that arises from a mutation in the [[TFAP2A]] gene. It is a rare [[autosomal dominant]] disorder that starts to affect a child's development before birth.&lt;ref name=Milunsky2008&gt;{{cite journal|last=Milunsky|first=Jeff |author2=Tom A.

== Signs and symptoms ==
"Branchio" refers to the [[branchial arch]]es, also known as the pharyngeal arches, of the affected individual. The branchial arches are structures in the developing [[embryo]] that give rise to certain tissues in the neck and facial area. In individuals affected by this condition, the branchial arches fail to develop properly. This leads to some of the physical conditions of this syndrome, which include abnormal patches of skin on the neck and face region and can be abnormally hairy, thin or red and with a high number of blood vessels.{{clarify|date=December 2013}} "Oculo" refers to the eyes. Individuals have [[vision impairment]] due to several malformations in the eyes such as small eyeballs, blockage in the tear ducts or lacking eyes completely. "Facial" refers to the face; those affected can have several abnormalities in that region. These abnormalities include a cleft lip, a [[cleft palate]] which is an opening in the roof of the mouth, widely spaced eyes ([[hypertelorism]]), sharp corners of the mouth that point upward, a broad nose that can include a flattened tip, along with several deformations of both the external and [[middle ear]] structures. This syndrome is restricted to the face, but it can also cause underdeveloped or malformed kidneys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Raveh|first=Eyal|author2=Blake C. Papsin|author3=Vito Forte|title=Branchio-oculo-facial syndrome|journal=International Journal of Pediatric Otorhinolaryngology|date=30 June 2000|volume=53|series=0165-5876|issue=20|pages=149–156|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165587600003104|accessdate=11 December 2013|doi=10.1016/S0165-5876(00)00310-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pathophysiology and genetics ==
The disease is genetically inherited and stems from a mutation that deletes the [[TFAP2A]] gene. This gene is important because it provides the blueprint for the arrangement of 437 [[amino acid]]s that make up the protein [[transcription factor]] known as AP-2 alpha. This protein transcription factor binds to a carboxy terminus helix-span-helix motifand an amino terminus portion of DNA that affects the activity of numerous cellular activities such as [[cell division]] and [[apoptosis]].{{clarify|date=December 2013}}  AP-2 alpha is especially important during the embyros development principally in the development of the branchial arches. Currently there are also four other proteins that are affected by the deletion of TFAP2A gene as well.  One is [[L249P]], this protein changes to cause a conformational space change with a substituted [[proline]]. Furthermore, a change in the [[R254W]] and [[R255G]] proteins results in a replacement of a charged polar side chain by a nonpolar side chain,{{clarify|date=December 2013}} and lastly, an alteration in the [[G262E]] protein results in a nonpolar side chain being replaced by a charged polar side chain.&lt;ref name="Milunsky2008"/&gt;

== Diagnosis ==
Branchio-oculo-facial syndrome is difficult to diagnose because it has [[incomplete penetrance]]. It is often misdiagnosed as [[branchio-oto-renal syndrome]] because of their similarities in symptoms.{{mcn|date=December 2013}}

==Management==
{{Empty section|date=August 2017}}

== Epidemiology ==
It was estimated that only about 50 cases of BOFS have been documented in the medical literature as of 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wakehealth.edu/Health-Encyclopedia/Health-Topics/Branchio-Oculo-Facial-Syndrome.htm | title=Branchio Oculo Facial Syndrome | work=[[Wake Forest University]] | accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bruce Jay Ehrlich''' (February 26, 1948 – January 1, 2013), better known by his pen name '''Bruce Eisner''', was an American writer, [[psychologist]], and [[counterculture]] spokesman best known for his book ''Ecstasy: The MDMA Story''.

==Biography==
Eisner was born in  [[Brooklyn]], New York. At age 2, he moved with his family to the San Fernando Valley near Los Angeles where he lived for the next 25 years. His first publication was at age 16, when he won an LA County-wide essay contest. The essay, "Democracy and What It Means to Me" was published in the Congressional Record by Congressman Ed Reinecke.

Eisner attended San Fernando Valley State College (now known as [[California State University, Northridge]]) where he was on the Deans List for his first two years of attendance. In his third year, he became an anti-Vietnam War activist and joined the Students for a Democratic Society. At the end of his third year, in 1969, he dropped out of college and moved to Laguna Beach which was then home base for Timothy Leary and the Brotherhood of Eternal Love. In the fall of 1969, Eisner first went to Europe where he lived in the Netherlands and then traveled overland to India.

In January 1970, Eisner returned to Los Angeles where he became a freelance journalist writing feature articles on topics focusing on LSD and the psychedelic consciousness movement for the "Underground Press." He wrote articles for the ''[[Los Angeles Free Press]]'' edited by [[Art Kunkin]], the Los Angeles Star and a variety of other small publications. In 1976, he became a contributing editor for ''[[High Times]]'' magazine and wrote a series of article including "LSD Purity" and "Who Turned on Whom" with Peter Stafford. Also, in 1976, Eisner traveled to Europe where he met author Michael Hollingshed in England and LSD discoverer [[Albert Hofmann]] in Basel, Switzerland.

In 1977, Eisner moved from Los Angeles to Santa Cruz, California. He became one of the leaders of a group of psychedelic movement activists. That group known as Linkage brought Albert Hofmann to UC Santa Cruz in 1977 for his first public lecture in the US at a conference called "LSD: A Generation Later." The conference was attended by both counterculture figures such as [[Timothy Leary]] PhD, [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[Ram Dass]], [[Stephen Gaskin]], and [[Ralph Metzner]] PhD, as well as early psychedelic researchers including [[Oscar Janiger]], MD, William McGlothlin, PhD, [[Stanley Krippner]], PhD, [[Claudio Naranjo]], MD and [[Willis Harman]] PhD.
 
Eisner received his B.A.in psychology from the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]] in 1979. He moved to Goleta California for two years and received his M.A. in psychology from the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]]. Eisner worked as a Teaching Assistant at U.C. Santa Barbara. In 1980, he became a contributing writer for ''[[Omni (magazine)|Omni]]'' magazine.

Eisner returned to Santa Cruz in 1981 and in 1982 moved into a home near Natural Bridges State Beach where he lived for the next 21 years. He began working on his PhD in Psychology from [[Saybrook Graduate School and Research Center]] in 1982 but withdrew before completing a dissertation in 1988.  In 1989, Eisner started a self-improvement software company called Mindware, which published a catalog of mind tool and personal development software programs called the Mindware Catalog until 1995.

In 1990, Eisner started the Island Group, which produced salons that encouraged discussions surrounding the creation of a "psychedelic culture". The group was named after the 1962 ''[[Island (Huxley novel)|Island]]'' by [[Aldous Huxley]]. The Island Group conceived and co-organized the 1992 "The Bridge: Linking the Past, Present and Future of Psychedelics" a two-day conference held at [[Stanford University]]. Island also conceived and co-organized "Bicycle Day: Celebrating 50 Years of LSD" at the University of California Santa Cruz, in April 1993.

Eisner created the Mind Media Life Enhancement Network in 1996, one of the first websites that provided a portal to other self-improvement and personal development websites.

In 1998, Eisner transformed his "Group" into the Island Foundation—a [[501 (c)(3)]] non-profit organization; however, the Foundation's exempt status was automatically revoked by the IRS after Eisner failed to file taxes for three consecutive years.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.guidestar.org/organizations/77-0460635/island-foundation.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Eisner moved to Las Vegas, Nevada to be close to his mother, Irene, who died in 2009 at age 82.

Bruce died on New Year's Day 2013 at his home in Las Vegas from a gastrointestinal hemorrhage. He was working on his online book, ''Future Culture: How to Make New Memes to Change the World'', when he died.

'''Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF)''' refers to the ability of the [[circulatory system|circulatory]] and [[respiratory system]]s to supply [[oxygen]] to [[skeletal muscle]]s during sustained physical activity. The primary measure of CRF is [[VO2 max|VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;max]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ross|first=Robert|last2=Blair|first2=Steven N.|last3=Arena|first3=Ross|last4=Church|first4=Timothy S.|last5=Després|first5=Jean-Pierre|last6=Franklin|first6=Barry A.|last7=Haskell|first7=William L.|last8=Kaminsky|first8=Leonard A.|last9=Levine|first9=Benjamin D.|date=2016-12-13|title=Importance of Assessing Cardiorespiratory Fitness in Clinical Practice: A Case for Fitness as a Clinical Vital Sign: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association|url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/134/24/e653|journal=Circulation|language=en|volume=134|issue=24|pages=e653–e699|doi=10.1161/CIR.0000000000000461|issn=0009-7322|pmid=27881567}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the [[American Heart Association]] published an official scientific statement advocating that CRF be categorized as a clinical vital sign and should be routinely assessed as part of clinical practice. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Regular [[exercise]] makes these systems more efficient by enlarging the [[heart]] muscle, enabling more [[blood]] to be pumped with each stroke, and increasing the number of small [[artery|arteries]] in trained skeletal muscles, which supply more blood to working muscles. Exercise improves not just  the respiratory system but the heart by increasing the amount of oxygen that is inhaled and distributed to body tissue.&lt;ref name="1st"&gt;{{cite book|last=Donatello|first=Rebeka J.|title=Health, The Basics|year=2005|publisher=Pearson Education, Inc|location=San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2005 Cochrane review demonstrated that physical activity interventions are effective for increasing cardiovascular fitness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hillsdon|first=M.|last2=Foster|first2=C.|last3=Thorogood|first3=M.|date=2005-01-25|title=Interventions for promoting physical activity|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|issue=1|pages=CD003180|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003180.pub2|issn=1469-493X|pmc=4164373|pmid=15674903}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many benefits of cardiorespiratory fitness. It can reduce the risk of heart disease, lung cancer, type 2 diabetes, stroke, and other diseases. Cardiorespiratory fitness helps improve lung and heart condition, and increases feelings of wellbeing.&lt;ref name="1st"/&gt; Additionally, there is mounting evidence that CRF is potentially a stronger predictor of mortality than other established risk factors such as smoking, hypertension, high cholesterol, and type 2 diabetes. Significantly, CRF can be added to these traditional risk factors to improve risk prediction validity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The American College of Sports Medicine recommends aerobic exercise 3–5 times per week for 30–60 minutes per session, at a moderate intensity, that maintains the heart rate between 65–85% of the maximum heart rate.&lt;ref name="2nd"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pollock|first=M.L.|author2=Gaesser, G.A.|title=Acsm position stand: the recommended quantity and quality of exercise for developing and maintaining cardiorespiratory and muscular fitness, and flexibility in healthy adults|journal=Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise|year=1998|volume=30|issue=6|doi=10.1097/00005768-199806000-00032|pages=975–991|pmid=9624661}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cardiovascular system==
The [[cardiovascular system]] responds to changing demands on the body by adjusting cardiac output, [[blood flow]], and [[blood pressure]]. [[Cardiac output]] is defined as the product of [[heart rate]] and [[stroke]] volume which represents the volume of blood being pumped by the heart each minute. Cardiac output increases during physical activity due to an increase in both the heart rate and stroke volume.&lt;ref name="3rd"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=S.P.|author2=Eason, J.M.|author3=Miller, W.C.|title=Exercise Physiology: Basis of Human Movement in Health and Disease|year=2006|pages=75–247|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|isbn=0781777305}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of exercise, the cardiovascular adaptations are very rapid: “Within a second after muscular contraction, there is a withdrawal of vagal outflow to the heart, which is followed by an increase in sympathetic stimulation of the heart. This results in an increase in cardiac output to ensure that blood flow to the muscle is matched to the metabolic needs”.&lt;ref name="4th"&gt;{{cite book|vauthors = Howley ET, Powers SK|title=Exercise Physiology: Theory and Application to Fitness and Performance|isbn=0078022533|year=1990|publisher=Wm. C. Brown Publishers|location=Dubuque, IA|pages=131–267}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both heart rate and stroke volume vary directly with the intensity of the exercise performed and many improvements can be made through continuous training.

Another important issue is the regulation of blood flow during exercise. Blood flow must increase in order to provide the working muscle with more oxygenated blood which can be accomplished through neural and [[chemical regulation]]. Blood vessels are under sympathetic tone; therefore, the release of noradrenaline and adrenaline will cause vasoconstriction of non-essential tissues such as the [[liver]], [[intestines]], and [[kidneys]], and decrease neurotransmitter release to the active muscles promoting [[vasodilatation]]. Also, chemical factors such as a decrease in oxygen concentration and an increase in [[carbon dioxide]] or lactic acid concentration in the blood promote vasodilatation to increase blood flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shaver|first=L.G.|title=Essentials of Exercise Physiology|isbn=0024096210|year=1981|publisher=Burgess Publishing Company|location=minneapolis, MN|pages=1–132}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of increased vascular resistance, blood pressure rises throughout exercise and stimulates [[baroreceptors]] in the carotid arteries and aortic arch. “These pressure receptors are important since they regulate arterial blood pressure around an elevated systemic pressure during exercise”.&lt;ref name="4th"/&gt;

==Respiratory system adaptations==
{{Main article|Respiratory adaptation}}Although all of the described adaptations in the body to maintain [[homeostatic]] balance during exercise are very important, the most essential factor is the involvement of the [[respiratory system]]. The respiratory system allows for the proper exchange and transport of gases to and from the lungs while being able to control the ventilation rate through neural and chemical impulses. In addition, the body is able to efficiently use the three energy systems which include the [[phosphagen]] system, the [[glycolytic]] system, and the [[oxidative]] system.&lt;ref name="3rd"/&gt;

==Temperature regulation==
In most cases, as the body is exposed to physical activity, the core temperature of the body tends to rise as heat gain becomes larger than the amount of heat lost. “The factors that contribute to heat gain during exercise include anything that stimulate metabolic rate, anything from the external environment that causes heat gain, and the ability of the body to dissipate heat under any given set of circumstances”.&lt;ref name="3rd"/&gt; In response to an increase in core temperature, there are a variety of factors which adapt in order to help restore heat balance. The main physiological response to an increase in body temperature is mediated by the thermal regulatory center located in the [[hypothalamus]] of the brain which connects to thermal [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]] and [[effector (biology)|effector]]s. There are numerous thermal effectors including [[sweat glands]], [[smooth muscles]] of blood vessels, some [[endocrine glands]], and [[skeletal muscle]]. With an increase in the core temperature, the thermal regulatory center will stimulate the arterioles supplying blood to the skin to dilate along with the release of sweat on the skin surface to reduce temperature through evaporation.&lt;ref name="3rd"/&gt; In addition to the involuntary regulation of temperature, the hypothalamus is able to communicate with the cerebral cortex to initiate voluntary control such as removing clothing or drinking cold water. With all regulations taken into account, the body is able to maintain core temperature within about two or three degrees Celsius during exercise.&lt;ref name="4th"/&gt;

'''''Childrens{{sic|hide=yes}} Hospital''''' (originally titled '''''Children's Hospital''''' as webisodes) is an American [[black comedy]] [[television series]] and [[web series]] that parodies the [[medical drama]] genre, created by and starring actor/comedian [[Rob Corddry]]. The series began on the web on [[The WB|TheWB.com]] with ten episodes, roughly five minutes in length, all of which premiered on December 8, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1325113/releaseinfo| title= Children's Hospital release info | publisher=IMDB.com | accessdate= July 18, 2010|date= July 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adult Swim]] picked up the rights to the show in 2009 and began airing episodes in 2010.&lt;ref name="weprin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/365915-Web_Series_Children_s_Hospital_Jumping_To_Adult_Swim.php| title= Web Series 'Children's Hospital' Jumping to Adult Swim | publisher=Broadcasting and Cable | accessdate= July 18, 2010|date= October 21, 2009|author= Alex Weprin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The storyline centers on the staff of Childrens Hospital, a children's hospital named after Dr. Arthur Childrens. The hospital sporadically (and usually without reason) is mentioned as being located within [[Brazil]], despite making virtually no effort to conceal that the series is shot in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]. Corddry is part of an ensemble cast portraying the hospital's doctors, which also includes [[Lake Bell]], [[Erinn Hayes]], [[Rob Huebel]], [[Ken Marino]] and [[Megan Mullally]]. [[Malin Åkerman]] and [[Henry Winkler]] joined the cast for season two. Previously recurring Zandy Hartig and [[Brian Huskey]] were upped to series regulars in season five, but became recurring cast members again from season 6 onward.

On June 2, 2015 it was renewed for a seventh season, which premiered on January 22, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Petski|first1=Denise|title=‘Children's  Hospital’ Renewed For Season 7 By Adult Swim|url=http://deadline.com/2015/06/childrens-hospital-renewed-season-7-adult-swim-1201436325/|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|accessdate=30 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rob Corddry announced that season 7 would be the show's final season, and its final episode aired on April 15, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vulture.com/2016/03/rob-corddry-on-ending-childrens-hospital.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synopsis ==
''Childrens Hospital'' is a product of TheWB.com. Its [[webisode]]s are about 4–5 minutes long, each narrated by mainly Dr. Cat Black ([[Lake Bell]]) in Season 1, and by Dr Valerie Flame ([[Malin Åkerman]]) in Season 2.  The show mocks such [[medical drama]]s as ''[[St. Elsewhere]]'', ''[[House (TV series)|House]]'', ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'', ''[[General Hospital]]'', ''[[Private Practice (TV series)|Private Practice]]'', ''[[Chicago Hope]]'', ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'', and ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://blogs.kansascity.com/tvbarn/2008/12/in-childrens-ho.html|title= In Childrens Hospital, Rob Corddry has the RX|publisher= Kansas City Blog|author= Aaron Barnhart|date= December 6, 2008|accessdate= October 14, 2009|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090923203235/http://blogs.kansascity.com/tvbarn/2008/12/in-childrens-ho.html|archivedate= September 23, 2009|df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Broadcasting ==
Though [[Comedy Central]] made a competing offer, the show was picked up by [[Adult Swim]] after Corddry decided the comedy style was not suited for the half-hour format Comedy Central wanted. Adult Swim offered half-hour or fifteen-minute time slots, and Corddry chose the latter. The original season one [[webisodes]] began airing on Adult Swim on July 11, 2010, in groups of two with a new faux-commercial in between the groupings of two webisodes. The channel then debuted the newly produced season two episodes which began airing on August 22, 2010.&lt;ref name="weprin" /&gt;

On September 1, 2010 ''Childrens Hospital'' began airing on the [[Canada|Canadian]] television channel [[G4 Canada|G4]]. In Winter 2013, the show was picked up by [[MuchMusic]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.muchmusic.com/tv/childrenshospital/ |title=Childrens Hospital Tuesday and Wednesday 11E/8P on MUCH |publisher=MuchMusic |date= |accessdate=2014-01-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140401110028/http://www.muchmusic.com/tv/childrenshospital/ |archivedate=April 1, 2014 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia ''Childrens Hospital'' premiered on cable on [[The Comedy Channel|Comedy Channel]] on January 26, 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thecomedychannel.com.au/WhatsOn/Detail.aspx?id=449 |title=The official home of Comedy |publisher=The Comedy Channel |date= |accessdate=2013-08-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926234629/http://www.thecomedychannel.com.au/WhatsOn/Detail.aspx?id=449 |archivedate=September 26, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and on ABC's free-to-air channel ABC2 during May–June 2013. The series began airing repeats on American cable channel [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] beginning October 20, 2014.

== Cast and characters ==
The series revolves around the medical staff of Childrens Hospital, featuring an [[ensemble cast]].

These actors receive top billing in the credits:

*Dr. Blake Downs ([[Rob Corddry]])&amp;nbsp;– he does his job while wearing clown make-up and [[surgical scrubs]] painted red to appear bloody. He believes in "the healing power of laughter" instead of medicine. The character's outlook on medicine seems to parody [[Robin Williams]]' character in the film ''[[Patch Adams (film)|Patch Adams]].'' His frightening clown makeup, very similar to the style of serial killer [[John Wayne Gacy]]'s "Pogo the Clown", often scares the child patients. His status as a [[clown]] is frequently likened to a [[Race (human classification)|race]], and one episode implies that his original name was "Mr. Bojiggles". The character is brutally killed at the end of season 4, but revived at the beginning of season 5; the hospital has a series of [[Cloning|cloned]] [[clown doctors]] who are taught Blake Downs's history, so that when one dies, another is activated.
* Dr. Catholomule "Cat" Black  ([[Lake Bell]])&amp;nbsp;– ex-girlfriend of Glenn Richie, who has a thing for her roommate Lola Spratt. Things became awkward between the women after Cat accidentally sneezed on Lola when making a sexual advance on her. She narrated the show during season 1, usually wandering through the hospital, thinking faux-deep thoughts like the characters on ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]'' and ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]''.  Cat begins dating Little Nicky (Nick Kroll), a six-year-old boy with advanced aging disease; and she dies giving birth to his child, who also has advanced aging disease.  In "The Sultan's Finger," however, it is revealed she didn't die, but somehow lost all her previous medical knowledge.  She then regains it and rejoins the main cast beginning with season 3. She briefly takes up [[naturism|nudism]] at home in "The Black Doctor". In spite of her "thing" with Lola, she rejects Chief's advances in "Ladies' Night". In one episode she reveals that she grew up in [[Senegal]].
* Dr. Glenn Richie ([[Ken Marino]])&amp;nbsp;– a Jewish doctor and ex-boyfriend of Cat Black. He frequently wears a [[yarmulke]] but because of his parents' divorce he never had his [[bar mitzvah]] until the episode "Party Down". Dr. Richie is the "playboy" of the hospital, having made out with most of the characters except Sy and Blake. Dr. Richie first appeared in ''[[The Ten]]'', which also starred Corddry and was directed by producer [[David Wain]]. Sal Viscuso's first PA announcement on the show is a reference to this.
* Dr. Owen Maestro ([[Rob Huebel]])&amp;nbsp;– a dim-witted doctor and Lola Spratt's ex-boyfriend. He is a former New York cop who left the force after [[9/11]]. His former police partner Briggs ([[Nick Offerman]]) is constantly trying to convince him to come back to the force.
*Chief ([[Megan Mullally]])&amp;nbsp;– the crippled head of the hospital's staff who initially uses [[crutches]] to allow her to walk, before switching to a [[walker (mobility)|walker]] in the Season 2 premiere. The male staff members at the hospital often make remarks about their sexual attraction to her. In spite of her [[Choctaw Indians|Choctaw Indian]] heritage, her name came from the fact that her mother saw it in a [[Scrabble]] board and chose it over "[[whore]]". She is a parody of [[Dr. Kerry Weaver]] of ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'' and Dr. Gregory House from ''[[House (TV series)|House]]''. She had a crush on Sy Mittleman but she publicly acts like she hates him so that the staff thinks she's on their side in the struggle against him; they finally get together in the episode "Hot Enough For You?" but no reference has been made to this ever since. In a Season 2 episode, [[Lizzy Caplan]] plays The Chief's daughter, who has her own real estate business. In one of the original webisodes, the doctors heal her crippling illness and she is inexplicably transformed into a younger, more beautiful woman (portrayed by [[Eva Longoria]]).
* Dr. Lola Adolf Spratt ([[Erinn Hayes]])&amp;nbsp;– Cat's roommate and Owen Maestro's ex-girlfriend. Cat is obsessed with her. Lola broke up with Owen by pretending she had a tumor, but he began to believe she was serious. Lola faked her death at the end of season 1 because she broke down after getting too many e-mails. She reappears at the hospital in season 2, but no one understands when she explains she faked her death and they all think she is a ghost. When she finally proves she's not a ghost, she reveals she's a gifted ventriloquist, having pretended to die on the operating table by using a long hum simulating a flat-line sound. She is also an attorney since she had "no pets, no friends, no TV" and passed the bar exam the previous summer, as mentioned in "Childrens Lawspital". She narrated the show in its third season. As she revealed in season 2 episode 9, she is a Muslim.
* Dr. Valerie Flame ([[Malin Åkerman]])&amp;nbsp;– (Season 2–7), replaces Cat after her death in the second episode of season 2, taking over the duties of narrating the show until the third-season premiere, when she is replaced by Lola Spratt. Her secret identity is that of Derrick Childrens ([[Jon Hamm]]). She has a "love-to-hate" relationship with Blake, raping him in "Hot Enough For You?" and punching him several times in "A Kid Walks into the Hospital" when she declares her love for him by "doing really weird things" to his mind. She was attracted to Cat when she took up nudism in "The Black Doctor" and was briefly the love interest of Dr. Brian.
* Sy Mittleman ([[Henry Winkler]])&amp;nbsp;– (Season 2–7), is the administrator. He runs the insurance company that owns the hospital. He collects butterflies and seems to have a sexual obsession with them. He is the object of much scorn from the staff who dismiss him as "a suit" despite the fact he genuinely cares for the patients and the hospital. Mittleman frequently has to resist The Chief's come-ons. He is happily married with children and has no desire to begin a sexual relationship with her, but he eventually gives in to her advances in the episode "Hot Enough for You?", although this has never been mentioned since. He was an assassin whose daughter tried and failed to kill him in "A Kid Walks into a Hospital".
* Nurse Dori (Zandy Hartig)&amp;nbsp;– (Season 5; recurring seasons 1–4 and 6–7), Nicky's mother, who does not approve of Cat's relationship with her son. After Little Nicky's death she becomes a nurse at Childrens. She was pregnant in season 3 with the father of the child being unknown until "A Year in the Life" when it was revealed to be Blake (in season 4, Nurse Dori's pregnancy stomach also disappeared).
* Chet Mandvanteussen ([[Brian Huskey]])&amp;nbsp;– (Season 5; recurring, seasons 1–4 and 6–7), the creepy paramedic who has a crush on Chief.

=== Recurring ===
* Sal Viscuso ([[Michael Cera]])&amp;nbsp;– (voice only); Michael Andrew Stock in "Attention Staff", the hospital staffer who speaks over the intercom.  He typically speaks one line per episode, usually a [[Non sequitur (literary device)|non sequitur]]. The character name is a homage to the actor [[Sal Viscuso]], who voiced the unseen P.A. announcer in the TV series ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]''. Cera was finally shown in the episode, "Attention Staff'", as a young boy whose aging process has stopped (appearing as "A Friend").
* Nurse Beth (Beth Dover)&amp;nbsp;– (season 2; season 4–7); a nurse at the hospital, a wide-eyed [[Ingénue]] who also writes her own fan fiction.
* Officer Chance Briggs ([[Nick Offerman]])&amp;nbsp;– Owen Maestro's former partner, a mustachioed New York city cop.
* Little Nicky ([[Nick Kroll]])&amp;nbsp;– (Seasons 1–2), a little boy with a rare aging disease, and later the father of Dr. Black's unborn child. Little Nicky takes on the tendencies of an old man once his disease reaches advanced stages. The disease takes his life in season two. Kroll also portrays Dr. Black's son, who is also suffering from the aging disease.
* Dr. [[Jason Mantzoukas]] ([[Nathan Corddry]]) and Dr. Ed Helms ([[Ed Helms]])&amp;nbsp;– (Season 1), two doctors who usually appear together and make sexual remarks about The Chief.
* Dr. [[Max Von Sydow]] ([[John Ross Bowie]])&amp;nbsp;– (Seasons 1–3), a doctor who tries to cure The Chief's condition.
* Dr. Nate Schacter ([[Seth Morris]])&amp;nbsp;– (Season 1), another clown doctor with whom Dr. Blake Downs develops a rivalry.
* Ben Hayflick ([[Kurtwood Smith]])&amp;nbsp;– (Season 2), head of the National Division of Health who is trying to suppress Dr. Richie's cancer cure so that his organization doesn't lose all the money it gets for cancer research; based on the [[The Smoking Man|Cigarette Man]] from the X-Files.
* Derrick Childrens ([[Jon Hamm]])&amp;nbsp;– (Seasons 2–3, 5, 7), the son of the founder of Childrens Hospital and secret identity of Valerie Flame. Jon Hamm also plays young Arthur Childrens in flashbacks.
* Dr. Brian ([[Jordan Peele]])&amp;nbsp;– (Seasons 2–3; guest appearance in season 5), a black bisexual doctor who left several years ago to consult on [[Marlon Wayans]]' show, ''Black Hospital'', he has recently returned to Childrens Hospital.  His catchphrase is "Righteous!"
* Nurse Kulap ([[Kulap Vilaysack]])&amp;nbsp;– (Seasons 1–4), one of the nurses at Childrens, most often seen assisting Owen and Glenn in the operating room.
*Arthur Childrens&amp;nbsp;–  (Season 3), Founder of Childrens Hospital. He only appeared in the 1970s and then stopped making appearances. He originated the quote, "I believe the Childrens are our future."
*Rabbi Jewy McJewJew ([[David Wain]])&amp;nbsp;– (Seasons 2–7), Dr. Richie's rival from Hebrew school, and the Childrens Hospital chaplain.
*Louis LaFonda ([[Mather Zickel]])&amp;nbsp;– (Seasons 2–4), host of ''Newsreaders'', a TV [[news magazine]], he covers the "real-life" developments on the set of ''Childrens Hospital'', and the status of the "real" actors on the show, the episodes of which essentially treat ''Childrens Hospital'' as a [[show within a show]]. He, like Dr. Richie, first appeared in ''[[The Ten]]''. ''[[Newsreaders]]'' was spun off as its own show on Adult Swim in 2013.

=== "Behind the scenes" ===
The series occasionally presents fictional "behind-the-scenes" episodes, supposedly chronicling the production of the series. These episodes portray ''Childrens Hospital'' as a long-running medical drama and typically feature interviews with the self-absorbed, eccentric cast members (also fictional characters). The first such episodes were presented as clips from a fictional ''[[60 Minutes]]''-style newsmagazine entitled ''[[Newsreaders]]'', which was later spun off into its own Adult Swim series. These fictional cast members have stories of their own:
* Cutter Spindell as Blake Downs. When Spindell is introduced, he is the only cast member who enjoys working on the show, and spearheads a campaign to save it from cancelation. Spindell is killed in an accident on set at the end of season 4, and is replaced by his identical twin brother Rory Spindell, a film and stage actor who is loathed by the other performers on the show.
* Dixie Peters, legal name Cynthia Quelson, as Cat Black. Peters is a pretentious actress who is fond of unusual makeup and who has an enormous photograph of herself in her dressing room. She marries series director David Wain, but cheats on him with fellow cast member Just Falcon, and the couple eventually divorces. She and cast member Lynn Williams have a long-standing rivalry over their roles in the show and their complicated relationships with director David Wain.
* Just Falcon as Glenn Richie. Falcon is a deeply eccentric man with little ability to relate to other people. He has a long and tumultuous relationship with David Wain, although Falcon is completely unaware of the strife and considers Wain a close friend. Falcon wears a long beard, which is covered up to film the show. Falcon is largely a parody of [[Joaquin Phoenix]] in ''[[I'm Still Here (2010 film)|I'm Still Here]]''.
* Rob Huebel (sometimes spelled Heubel) as Owen Maestro. The pronunciation and spelling of Huebel's name changes from episode to episode. Huebel (the character) is a flamboyant gay man whose tastes in fashion and facial hair run towards the 1970s. He is rarely seen without a drink in his hand, and often throws glitter into the air after making a big announcement.
* Lady Jane Bentick-Smith as Chief. Bentick-Smith is an affable [[England|English]] woman, and apparently a member of the [[British nobility|British aristocracy]]. She has a long history of theater work, and much of her dialogue consists of nonsensical Britishisms.
* Lynn Williams as Lola Spratt. Williams is vain and locked in a constant rivalry with co-star Dixie Peters. When not on camera, she sports a thick unibrow, which she describes as "honest".
* Ingrid Hagerstown as Valerie Flame. Hagerstown is a native Swedish speaker, has virtually no knowledge of English, and learns her lines phonetically. She seems to have little relationship with her coworkers, referring to Cutter Spindell as "the man who plays the clown".
* Fred Nunley as Sy Mittleman. Nunley is a character actor who has been brought in to revive several failing television shows, although never successfully. He has a pathological hatred of children; when he gets a spinoff series that partners him with several child costars, he requests that the producers film their scenes separately and digitally insert his image into the footage of the children.
* Glarion Rudge as Nurse Dori. She is a former lover of David Wain's; his continuing attraction to her is not requited.
* Mark Splorn as Chet Mandvanteussen. Mark is revealed to be having an affair with Dixie's mother during Glenn's photography exhibit.
* Melinda Waller as Nurse Beth. The actress that plays Nurse Beth.
* David Wain as Rabbi Jewy McJewJew. Wain is the series director and has had relationships with Peters, Williams, and Rudge. He has worked with Just Falcon for decades, but views Falcon's work with other directors as a betrayal and seeks to sabotage him, culminating in an incident in which Wain purposely leaves bullets in a gun for a scene in which Falcon's character is to play [[Russian roulette]]. He creates the character of McJewJew, who steals Glenn Richie's love interests, in a failed attempt to antagonize the oblivious Falcon.

The mock [[television advertisement]]s presented with the [[Adult Swim]] broadcasts of ''Childrens Hospital'' season one tied into future Adult Swim programs. A commercial for a crime procedural parody led to the show ''[[NTSF:SD:SUV::]]'' (''National Terrorism Strike Force: San Diego: Sport Utility Vehicle''), which ran from 2011 to 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deadline.com/2010/11/adult-swim-picks-up-crime-drama-parody-series-with-12-episode-order/ |title=Adult Swim Picks Up Crime Drama Parody Series With 12-Episode Order |first=Nellie |last=Andreeva |date=November 23, 2010 |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |publisher=[[Mail.com Media|PMC]] |accessdate=July 19, 2011 |quote=The network has handed a 12-episode order to Paul Scheer's ''NTSF:SD:SUV::'' which, as the title suggests, is a parody of the ubiquitous genre of crime procedurals.

Some episode of ''Childrens Hospital'' featured a fictional TV show called ''Newsreaders,'' a parody of the CBS show ''[[60 Minutes]];'' this led to ''[[Newsreaders]]'' being picked up as its own show on Adult Swim, premiering in January 2013.&lt;ref name="Newsreaders teaser"&gt;{{cite video |date=November 20, 2012 |title=Newsreaders: Series Teaser |url=http://video.adultswim.com/promos/newsreaders-series-teaser.html |medium= |publisher=Adult Swim |location= |accessdate=November 23, 2012 |quote=A new spinoff of Childrens Hospital is happening and answers all of your questions about everything, because it's an interview show and that's what it's about.

In 2011, Corddry stated that the cast and creative team of ''Childrens Hospital'' were working on doing a movie together, separate from ''Childrens Hospital'', with a different story and characters.&lt;ref name="Hollywood.com" /&gt; In 2017, Corddry announced that a spin-off series of ''Childrens Hospital'' was in development: a global mystery/thriller structured around a season-long serial narrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kozell|first1=Isaac|title=Rob Corddry on ‘Ballers,’ His ‘Childrens Hospital’ Spin-Off, and Playing Second Banana|url=http://splitsider.com/2017/09/rob-corddry-on-ballers-his-childrens-hospital-spin-off-and-playing-second-banana/|website=Splitsider|accessdate=2 October 2017|date=8 September 2017|quote=I will say that yes, there is a spin-off of ''Childrens Hospital'' that has been picked up and is in the works.

The '''Citizenship and Christian Democracy''' ({{lang-pt|Cidadania e Democracia Cristã}}, '''PPV/CDC''') is a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] minor [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] [[political party]], with an ideological foundation of [[pro-life]], [[conservatism]] and [[Christian democracy]]. PPV is a newly established Portuguese political party, approved by the Constitutional Court on July 1, 2009, which defends the principles of the [[Catholic social teaching|social doctrine of the Church]].

Composed by people from all political persuasions, although mostly from the conservative right, the Portugal Pro-Life presents its programme of policy proposals around the unconditional defence of life, understanding the concept of life and the various principles inherent to it as advocates [[Catholic social teaching|Catholic Church doctrine]], and [[Roman Catholicism]] as a [[state religion]]. Its [[general manager]], elected in January 2014, is Joana Câmara Pereira.

The PPV/CDC advocates the repeal of [[abortion]] law, of the recent amendments to the law of [[divorce]] found in Portugal, and to maintain prohibition of [[euthanasia]], or the revision of standards on [[sex education]] in schools, allowing parents to have an active voice. During the debate on the legalization of civil [[same-sex marriage]], the party has a position against. In the field of citizenship, the party advocates vow no age limit and the recognition of [[Conscientious objector|conscientious objection]] of taxpayers - the latter should be able to specify which use to give their taxes.

'''Colorectal Cancer Alliance''' is the largest and oldest [[colorectal cancer]] [[non-profit organization]] in the US.   
    
The Colorectal Cancer Alliance offers a variety of patient support services including grant programs, monthly webinars, a helpline, chat forum and a Buddy Program, which provides both survivors and caregivers with a chance to connect with someone who has gone through a similar experience. The organization serves as a source of information about colorectal health. The Colorectal Cancer Alliance also distributes colorectal cancer awareness merchandise and printed materials.

The organization received its sixth straight 4-star rating from [[Charity Navigator]], and maintains the 'Accredited Charity' status from the [[Better Business Bureau]]. The organization is tax-exempt under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. It is eligible to receive contributions deductible as charitable donations for federal income tax purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=COLORECTAL CANCER ALLIANCE RECEIVES 4-STAR CHARITY NAVIGATOR RATING FOR THIRD STRAIGHT YEAR|url=http://globenewswire.com/news-release/2014/05/08/634636/10080815/en/Colon-Cancer-Alliance-Receives-4-Star-Charity-Navigator-Rating-For-Fourth-Year.html|publisher=Global News Wire}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Charity Review: Colorectal Cancer Alliance"&gt;{{cite web|title=Charity Review: Colorectal Cancer Alliance|url=http://www.give.org/charity-reviews/national/cancer/colon-cancer-alliance-in-washington-dc-19043|publisher=Give.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;    
 
==History==
The Colorectal Cancer Alliance was founded in March 18, 1999, as the Colon Cancer Alliance, after being incorporated in the state of [[Delaware]]. Its foundation was the result of a group of 41 survivors, caregivers and friends "who saw the need to educate the public about colon cancer and provide support to those affected by the disease."&lt;ref name= "History &amp; Founders"&gt;{{cite web|title=History &amp; Founders: Colorectal Cancer Alliance|url=https://www.ccalliance.org/about-us/history-and-founders/|publisher=Colon Cancer Alliance}}&lt;/ref&gt;    

The organization's first annual meeting occurred in Washington, DC, after which a new board of directors took office.

In early 2016, the Colon Cancer Alliance merged with the [[Chris4Life Colon Cancer Foundation]], a research-focused colon cancer nonprofit organization founded in 2010. After the merger, the Colon Cancer Alliance retained its name, and became the largest colorectal cancer-focused nonprofit organization in the United States.

As of November 1, 2017, the foundation was officially re-branded as the Colorectal Cancer Alliance.&lt;ref name= "Colon Cancer Alliance Announces Corporate Name Change"&gt;{{cite web|title=Colon Cancer Alliance Announces Corporate Name Change|url=https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2017/11/02/1173511/0/en/Colon-Cancer-Alliance-Announces-Corporate-Name-Change.html|publisher=GlobeNewswire}}&lt;/ref&gt;    

==Programs and Services==
The Colorectal Cancer Alliance provides services in the areas of patient and family support, research funding and prevention efforts. The organization also promotes the [[National Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month]] observed on March of every year, and the [[Dress in Blue Day]], held on the first Friday of every March.

'''''D v Ireland''''' is a case of the [[European Court of Human Rights]] concerning [[abortion]] in Ireland. It refers to the court case itself, and the circumstances surrounding abortion for fatal foetal abnormalities in Ireland. In 2002 Deirdre Conroy discovered her pregnancy was non-viable and had a termination in Northern Ireland. A public letter, written using a pseudonym, asking for it to be legal was credited with influencing the [[Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 2002 (Ireland)|2002 abortion referendum]]. She lost a court case in the ECHR in 2006 because she had not exhausted all domestic remedies. In 2013 after the [[death of Savita Halappanavar]], she came forward, revealed her identity and again asked for this sort of termination to be legal.

==Initial Letter==
{{see also|Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 2002 (Ireland)}}

In January 2002, Deirdre Conroy was 39, the mother of two boys aged 10 and 12, and expecting twins. At 14 weeks pregnant, the initial results of an amniocentesis test revealed one of the twins had died. Three weeks later, full test results revealed the second twin had [[Edwards syndrome]], a condition which usually ends in miscarriage or death shortly after birth because of heart abnormalities, kidney malformations, and other internal organ disorders.&lt;ref name="2013-05-03-irishtimes" /&gt;

In the run up to the [[Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 2002 (Ireland)|Twenty-fifth Amendment Referendum]], in February 2002, she wrote an open letter to [[The Irish Times]] newspaper, using the pseudonym Deirdre de Barra, telling of her case, and asking for termination for fatal foetal abnormalities to be legalised in Ireland.&lt;ref name="2002-02-25"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Irish Times|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/letters/referendum-on-abortion-1.1051700|date=2002-02-25|title="REFERENDUM ON ABORTION"|first=Deirdre|last=de Barra|accessdate=2016-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2002-02-26-irishtimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/abnormalities-are-not-covered-in-amendment-1.1051731|date=2002-02-26|accessdate=2016-07-26|first=Kitty|last=Holland|newspaper=The Irish Times|title=Abnormalities are not covered in amendment}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Norris (politician)|David Norris]] supported termination for FFA in that case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/norris-lauds-courage-of-woman-1.1051894|newspaper=The Irish Times|date=2002-02-27|accessdate=2016-07-26|title=Norris lauds courage of woman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Terminations for fatal foetal abonormalities were not covered by the Twenty-fifth Amendment referendum, and would have remained illegal regardless of the outcome of that vote.&lt;ref name="2002-02-26-irishtimes"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/a-yes-vote-will-protect-doctors-1.1052032|title='A Yes vote will protect doctors'|newspaper=The Irish Times|first=Carol|last=Coulter|date=2002-02-28|accessdate=2016-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She later travelled to [[Northern Ireland]] for a termination. The Irish hospital would not give her a referral letter, and her doctors were very guarded when discussing abortion with her&lt;ref name="echr"&gt;{{cite court|url=http://www.bailii.org/eu/cases/ECHR/2006/1210.html|litigants=D v Ireland|date=2006|court=European Court of Human Rights}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2–8}}

==Court Case==

===D's claim===

D complained about the need to travel abroad to have an abortion in the case of a lethal foetal abnormality and about the restrictions for which the 1995 Act provided. She expressly confined her complaint to the situation of a fatal foetal diagnosis, considering that her tragic situation was exacerbated by the above-noted limitations. She invoked Articles 3, 8 and 10 of the Convention. She further complained under Article 14 that she was discriminated against as a pregnant woman or as a pregnant woman with a lethal foetal abnormality: a person with a serious medical problem would never have encountered such difficulties in obtaining medical care and advice.&lt;ref name=echr/&gt;{{rp|58–60}}

===Ireland's claim===

====Domestic Remedies====
The Government maintained that, as soon as the diagnosis of Trisomy 18 was confirmed, the applicant should have initiated an action in the High Court, pursued if unsuccessful to the Supreme Court, to obtain a declaration that Article 40.3.3 of the Constitution allowed an abortion in Ireland in the case of a fatal foetal abnormality together with the necessary ancillary mandatory order.&lt;ref name="echr"/&gt;{{rp|64}}

====Possibly not illegal in Ireland====

The Irish government maintained that termination for fatal foetal abnormalities might not be illegal, pointing to the [[Attorney General v. X|X Case]] as proof that the [[Supreme Court of Ireland|Supreme Court]] could develop what "unborn" means&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Irish Times|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/foetus-may-not-always-be-an-unborn-argues-state-1.1030072|date=2006-07-14|accessdate=2016-07-26|title=Foetus may not always be an unborn, argues State|first=Carol|last=Coulter}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Irish Times|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/health/abortion-law-what-comes-next-1.1476187|title=Abortion law: what comes next?|first=Kitty|last=Holland|date=27 July 2013|quote=The State argued that the Irish courts were "unlikely" to interpret Article 40.3.3 "with remorseless logic particularly when the facts were exceptional" and that there was "at least a tenable" argument that an unborn with a fatal abnormality would not attract the protection of Article 40.3.3. She might have won had she gone to court in Ireland, said the State. The ECHR accepted the State's contention so found against her.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|text=More centrally, it was an open question as to whether Article 40.3.3 could have allowed a lawful abortion in Ireland in the applicant's circumstances. The X case demonstrated the potential for judicial development in this area and, further, the X case did not exclude possible evolution in cases such as the applicant's: the foetus was viable in the X case whereas in the present case there might be an issue as to the extent to which the State was required to guarantee the right to life of a foetus which suffered from a lethal genetic abnormality. The meaning of "unborn" in Article 40.3.3 had attracted some public and academic comment (notably, the Green Paper on Abortion at paragraphs 35-38 above and a leading textbook on Irish constitutional law "The Irish Constitution", Kelly, at § 7.3.28). However, there had been little judicial examination of the meaning of "unborn" and certainly no case comparable to the present. Accordingly, although it was true that Article 40.3.3 had to be understood as excluding a liberal abortion regime, the courts were nonetheless unlikely to interpret the provision with remorseless logic particularly when the facts were exceptional. If therefore it had been established that there was no realistic prospect of the foetus being born alive, then there was "at least a tenable" argument which would be seriously considered by the domestic courts to the effect that the foetus was not an "unborn" for the purposes of Article 40.3.3 or that, even if it was an "unborn", its right to life was not actually engaged as it had no prospect of life outside the womb. In the absence of a domestic decision, it was impossible to foresee that Article 40.3.3 clearly excluded an abortion in the applicant's situation in Ireland.|source=&lt;ref name="echr"/&gt;{{rp|69}} }}

===Judgement===

The court dismissed the case, since D did not comply with the requirement to exhaust domestic remedies as regards the availability of abortion in Ireland in the case of fatal foetal abnormality.&lt;ref name="echr" /&gt;{{rp|103}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/european-court-rejects-plea-to-hear-abortion-law-challenge-1.1026607|newspaper=The Irish Times|title=European court rejects plea to hear abortion law challenge|first=Carol|last=Coulter|date=2006-07-06|accessdate=2016-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/woman-loses-fight-over-abortion-claim-26373223.html|title=Woman loses fight over abortion claim|newspaper=Irish Independent|date=2006-07-06|accessdate=2016-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''De Quervain syndrome''' is [[inflammation]] of two [[tendon]]s that control movement of the [[thumb]] and their [[tendon sheath]].&lt;ref name=OI2013/&gt; This results in pain at the outside of the [[wrist]].&lt;ref name=OI2013/&gt; Pain is typically increased with gripping or rotating the wrist.&lt;ref name=OI2013/&gt; The thumb may also be difficult to move smoothly.&lt;ref name=Hub2018/&gt; Onset of symptoms is gradual.&lt;ref name=Hub2018&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hubbard |first1=MJ |last2=Hildebrand |first2=BA |last3=Battafarano |first3=MM |last4=Battafarano |first4=DF |title=Common Soft Tissue Musculoskeletal Pain Disorders. |journal=Primary care |date=June 2018 |volume=45 |issue=2 |pages=289-303 |doi=10.1016/j.pop.2018.02.006 |pmid=29759125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Risk factors and diagnosis --&gt;
Risk factors include certain repetitive movements, [[pregnancy]], trauma, and [[rheumatic diseases]].&lt;ref name=Hub2018/&gt;&lt;ref name=OI2013&gt;{{cite web |title=De Quervain's Tendinosis - Symptoms and Treatment - OrthoInfo - AAOS |url=https://orthoinfo.aaos.org/en/diseases--conditions/de-quervains-tendinosis/ |accessdate=21 June 2018 |date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The diagnosis is generally based on symptoms and [[physical examination]].&lt;ref name=OI2013/&gt; It is supported if pain increases when the wrist is bent [[ulnar deviation|inwards]] while a person is grabbing their thumb within a fist.&lt;ref name=Hub2018/&gt;

&lt;!-- Treatment and epidemiology --&gt;
Treatment involves avoiding activities that bring on the symptoms, pain medications such as [[NSAIDs]], and [[splint (medicine)|splinting]] the thumb.&lt;ref name=Hub2018/&gt; If this is not effective [[corticosteroid|steroid injections]] or surgery may be recommended.&lt;ref name=Hub2018/&gt; The condition affects about 0.5% of males and 1.3% of females.&lt;ref name=Sat2018/&gt; Those who are middle aged are most often affected.&lt;ref name=OI2013/&gt; It was first described in 1895 by [[Fritz de Quervain]].&lt;ref name=Sat2018/&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
Symptoms are pain at the radial side of the wrist, spasms, tenderness, occasional burning sensation in the hand, and swelling over the thumb side of the wrist, and difficulty gripping with the affected side of the hand. The onset is often gradual.&lt;ref name=I2007/&gt; Pain is made worse by movement of the thumb and wrist, and may radiate to the thumb or the forearm.&lt;ref name=I2007 /&gt;

==Causes==

==Pathophysiology==
[[File:Gray424.png|thumb|The mucous sheaths of the tendons on the back of the wrist.]]
De Quervain syndrome involves noninflammatory thickening of the tendons and the [[synovial sheath]]s that the tendons run through. The two tendons concerned are those of  the [[extensor pollicis brevis]] and [[abductor pollicis longus]] muscles. These two muscles run side by side and function to bring the thumb away from the hand; the extensor pollicis brevis brings the thumb outwards radially, and the abductor pollicis longus brings the thumb forward away from the palm. De Quervain tendinopathy affects the tendons of these muscles as they pass from the forearm into the hand via a fibro-osseous tunnel (the first dorsal compartment).
Evaluation of histopathological specimens shows a thickening and myxoid degeneration consistent with a chronic degenerative process, as opposed to inflammation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Clarke MT, Lyall HA, Grant JW, Matthewson MH |title=The histopathology of de Quervain's disease |journal=J Hand Surg [Br] |volume=23 |issue=6 |pages=732–4 |date=December 1998 |pmid=9888670 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pathology is identical in de Quervain seen in new mothers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Read HS, Hooper G, Davie R |title=Histological appearances in post-partum de Quervain's disease |journal=J Hand Surg [Br] |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=70–2 |date=February 2000 |pmid=10763729 |doi=10.1054/jhsb.1999.0308 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
De Quervain syndrome is diagnosed clinically, based on history and physical examination, though diagnostic imaging such as x-ray may be used to rule out fracture, arthritis, or other causes, based on the person's history and presentation. The modified [[Eichoff maneuver]], commonly called the [[Finkelstein's test]], is a physical exam maneuver used to diagnose de Quervain syndrome.&lt;ref name=I2007/&gt; To perform the test, the examiner grasps and ulnar deviates the hand when the person has their thumb held within their fist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Campbell |first1=William Wesley |last2=DeJong |first2=Russell N. |title=DeJong's the Neurologic Examination |date=2005 |publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |isbn=9780781727679 |page=583 |url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=CvgxUpZ7ZfUC&amp;pg=PA583 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=I2007/&gt; If sharp pain occurs along the distal radius (top of forearm, about an inch below the wrist), de Quervain's syndrome is likely. While a positive Finkelstein's test is often considered [[pathognomonic]] for de Quervain syndrome, the maneuver can also cause pain in those with [[osteoarthritis]] at the base of the thumb.&lt;ref name=I2007/&gt;

===Differential diagnosis===
[[Differential diagnoses]]&lt;ref name="mayo_arm"&gt;{{cite web |author=Mayo Clinic |title= Arm pain: Causes |url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/arm-pain/MY00114/DSECTION=causes}}&lt;/ref&gt; include:
# [[Osteoarthritis]] of the first carpo-metacarpal joint
# [[Intersection syndrome]]—pain will be more towards the middle of the back of the forearm and about 2–3&amp;nbsp;inches below the wrist
# [[Cheiralgia paresthetica|Wartenberg's syndrome]]

==Treatment==
As with many musculoskeletal conditions, the management of de Quervain's disease is determined more by convention than scientific data. A systematic review and meta-analysis published in 2013 found that corticosteroid injection seems to be an effective form of conservative management of de Quervain's syndrome in approximately 50% of patients, although more research is needed regarding the extent of any clinical benefits.&lt;ref name=Ashraf2013&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ashraf|first=MO|author2=Devadoss, VG|title=Systematic review and meta-analysis on steroid injection therapy for de Quervain's tenosynovitis in adults|journal=European journal of orthopaedic surgery &amp; traumatology: orthopedie traumatologie|date=22 January 2013|pmid=23412309|doi=10.1007/s00590-012-1164-z|volume=24|issue=2|pages=149–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Efficacy data are relatively sparse and it is not clear whether benefits affect the overall natural history of the illness.{{Medical citation needed|date=December 2013}}

Most tendinoses are self-limiting and the same is likely to be true of de Quervain's although further study is needed.{{Medical citation needed|date=December 2013}}

Palliative treatments include a splint that immobilized the wrist and the thumb to the interphalangeal joint and anti-inflammatory medication or acetaminophen. Systematic review and meta-analysis do not support the use of splinting over steroid injections.&lt;ref name=Cochrane2009&gt;{{cite journal|last=Peters-Veluthamaningal|first=C|author2=van der Windt, DA |author3=Winters, JC |author4=Meyboom-de Jong, B |title=Corticosteroid injection for de Quervain's tenosynovitis|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=8 July 2009|issue=3|pages=CD005616|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005616.pub2|pmid=19588376}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Coldham2006&gt;{{cite journal|last=Coldham|first=F|title=The use of splinting in the non-surgical treatment of De Quervains disease: a review of the literature|journal=British Journal of Hand Therapy|year=2006|volume=11|issue=2|pages=48–55|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0023405/|accessdate=8 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Surgery (in which the sheath of the first dorsal compartment is opened longitudinally) is documented to provide relief in most patients.&lt;ref name="pmid7963313"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Weiss AP, Akelman E, Tabatabai M | title = Treatment of de Quervain's disease | journal = The Journal of Hand Surgery | volume = 19 | issue = 4 | pages = 595–8 | date = July 1994 | pmid = 7963313 | doi = 10.1016/0363-5023(94)90262-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most important risk is to the radial sensory nerve.

Some occupational and physical therapists suggest alternative lifting mechanics based on the theory that the condition is due to repetitive use of the thumbs during lifting. Physical/Occupational therapy can suggest activities to avoid based on the theory that certain activities might exacerbate one's condition, as well as instruct on strengthening exercises based on the theory that this will contribute to better form and use of other muscle groups, which might limit irritation of the tendons.

Some occupational and physical therapists use other treatments, in conjunction with Therapeutic Exercises, based on the rationale that they reduce inflammation and pain and promote healing:  UST, SWD, or other deep heat treatments, as well as [[Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation|TENS]], [[acupuncture]], or infrared light therapy, and [[cold laser]] treatments.  However, the pathology of the condition is not inflammatory changes to the synovial sheath and inflammation is secondary to the condition from friction.&lt;ref name="pmid23943679"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Patel KR, Tadisina KK, Gonzalez MH | title = De Quervain's Disease | journal = Eplasty | volume = 13 | issue = | pages = ic52 | date = 2013 | pmid = 23943679 | pmc = 3723064  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Teaching patients to reduce their secondary inflammation does not treat the underlying condition but may reduce their pain; which is helpful when trying to perform the prescribed exercise interventions.

Getting Physical Therapy before surgery or injections has been shown to reduce overall costs to patients and is a viable option to treat a wide array of musculoskeletal injuries.

==History==
From the original description of the illness in 1895 until the first description of corticosteroid injection by Jarrod Ismond in 1955,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | date = Jun 1955 | title = Local hydrocortisone in de Quervain's disease | url = | journal = Br Med J | volume = 1 | issue = 4929| pages = 1501–3 | doi=10.1136/bmj.1.4929.1501 | author=Christie B. G. B.}}&lt;/ref&gt; it appears that the only treatment offered was surgery.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Piver JD, Raney RB | date = Mar 1952 | title = De Quervain's tendovaginitis | url = | journal = Am J Surg | volume = 83 | issue = 5| pages = 691–4 | doi=10.1016/0002-9610(52)90304-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lamphier TA, Long NG, Dennehy T | date = Dec 1953 | title = De Quervain's disease: an analysis of 52 cases | doi = 10.1097/00000658-195312000-00002 | journal = Ann Surg | volume = 138 | issue = 6| pages = 832–41 | pmid = 13105228 | pmc=1609322}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since approximately 1972, the prevailing opinion has been that of McKenzie (1972) who suggested that corticosteroid injection was the first line of treatment and surgery should be reserved for unsuccessful injections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = McKenzie JM | date = Dec 1972 | title = Conservative treatment of de Quervain's disease | url = | journal = Br Med J | volume = 4 | issue = 5841| pages = 659–60 | doi=10.1136/bmj.4.5841.659}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eponym===
It is named after the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[surgery|surgeon]] [[Fritz de Quervain]] who first identified it in 1895.&lt;ref name="pmid15576233"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ahuja NK, Chung KC |title=Fritz de Quervain, MD (1868-1940): stenosing tendovaginitis at the radial styloid process |journal=J Hand Surg [Am] |volume=29 |issue=6 |pages=1164–70 |year=2004 |pmid=15576233 |doi=10.1016/j.jhsa.2004.05.019 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0363-5023(04)00381-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; It should not be confused with [[de Quervain's thyroiditis]], another condition named after the same person.

A '''degloving''' injury is a type of [[Avulsion injury|avulsion]] in which an extensive section of [[skin]] is completely torn off the underlying tissue, severing its [[blood]] supply. It is named by analogy to the process of removing a [[glove]].

==Effects==
Typically, degloving injuries affect the extremities and limbs. Any injury which would induce degloving of the head or torso is likely to be lethal. However, controlled facial degloving is often featured in [[plastic surgery]].

Degloving injuries invariably require major surgical interventions. Treatment options include [[replantation]] or [[revascularization]] of the degloved skins, or when these are not possible, [[graft (surgery)|skin grafts]] or [[flap (surgery)|skin flaps]]. While the preservation of the extremities and limbs is normally preferred, in some cases [[amputation]]s may be advised or required. Post-operative [[physiotherapy]] is of particular importance for degloving injuries involving the hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Krishnamoorthy |first= R |last2= Karthikeyan |first2= G |date= May–August 2011 |title= Degloving injuries of the hand |journal= Indian Journal of Plastic Surgery |publisher= |volume= 44 |issue= 2 |pages= 227–236 |doi= 10.4103/0970-0358.85344|pmc=3193635 |pmid=22022033}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other animals==
Many small mammals are able to induce degloving of their [[tail]]s to escape capture;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ratguide.com/health/trauma/degloving_injury.php |title=Guide to treatment of degloving injuries in pet rats |publisher=Ratguide.com |date= |accessdate=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; this is comparable to tail [[autotomy]] in reptiles.

===Non-infectious===
There are a number of non-infectious causes of inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract.&lt;ref name=EBMED2010/&gt; Some of the more common include medications (like [[NSAIDs]]), certain foods such as [[lactose]] (in those who are intolerant), and [[gluten]] (in those with [[Coeliac disease|celiac disease]]). [[Crohn's disease]] is also a non-infectious source of (often severe) gastroenteritis.&lt;ref name=EBMED2010/&gt; Disease secondary to [[toxin]]s may also occur. Some food-related conditions associated with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea include: [[Ciguatera|ciguatera poisoning]] due to consumption of contaminated predatory fish, [[scombroid food poisoning|scombroid]] associated with the consumption of certain types of spoiled fish, [[Tetrodotoxin#Poisoning|tetrodotoxin poisoning]] from the consumption of [[puffer fish]] among others, and [[botulism]] typically due to improperly preserved food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lawrence|first=DT|author2=Dobmeier, SG |author3=Bechtel, LK |author4= Holstege, CP |title=Food poisoning.|journal=Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America|date=May 2007 |volume=25|issue=2|pages=357–73; abstract ix|pmid=17482025|doi=10.1016/j.emc.2007.02.014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, rates of emergency department use for noninfectious gastroenteritis dropped 30% from 2006 until 2011. Of the twenty most common conditions seen in the emergency department, rates of noninfectious gastroenteritis had the largest decrease in visits in that time period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | vauthors = Skiner HG, Blanchard J, Elixhauser A | title = Trends in Emergency Department Visits, 2006–2011 | work = HCUP Statistical Brief #179 | publisher = Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality | location = Rockville, MD | date = September 2014 | url = https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/reports/statbriefs/sb179-Emergency-Department-Trends.jsp | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141224224220/http://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/reports/statbriefs/sb179-Emergency-Department-Trends.jsp | archivedate = 2014-12-24 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pathophysiology==
[[File:Gastroenteritis.jpg|thumb|Gastroenteritis caused due to intestinal infection.]]
Gastroenteritis is defined as [[vomiting]] or [[diarrhea]] due to inflammation of the [[small bowel|small]] or [[large bowel]], often due to infection.&lt;ref name=M93/&gt; The changes in the small bowel are typically noninflammatory, while the ones in the large bowel are inflammatory.&lt;ref name=M93/&gt; The number of pathogens required to cause an infection varies from as few as one (for ''Cryptosporidium'') to as many as 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; (for ''Vibrio cholerae'').&lt;ref name=M93/&gt;

==Diagnosis==
Gastroenteritis is typically diagnosed clinically, based on a person's signs and symptoms.&lt;ref name=Eck2011/&gt; Determining the exact cause is usually not needed as it does not alter management of the condition.&lt;ref name=Web09/&gt;

However, [[stool culture]]s should be performed in those with blood in the stool, those who might have been exposed to [[food poisoning]], and those who have recently traveled to the developing world.&lt;ref name=Webb2005/&gt; It may also be appropriate in children younger than 5, old people, and those with poor immune function.&lt;ref name=IDSA2017&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shane|first1=Andi L|last2=Mody|first2=Rajal K|last3=Crump|first3=John A|last4=Tarr|first4=Phillip I|last5=Steiner|first5=Theodore S|last6=Kotloff|first6=Karen|last7=Langley|first7=Joanne M|last8=Wanke|first8=Christine|last9=Warren|first9=Cirle Alcantara|last10=Cheng|first10=Allen C|last11=Cantey|first11=Joseph|last12=Pickering|first12=Larry K|title=2017 Infectious Diseases Society of America Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Infectious Diarrhea|journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases|date=19 October 2017|doi=10.1093/cid/cix669|volume=65|pages=e45–e80}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diagnostic testing may also be done for surveillance.&lt;ref name=Eck2011/&gt; As [[hypoglycemia]] occurs in approximately 10% of infants and young children, measuring serum [[glucose]] in this population is recommended.&lt;ref name=Tint10/&gt; [[Electrolytes]] and [[creatinine|kidney function]] should also be checked when there is a concern about severe dehydration.&lt;ref name=Webb2005/&gt;

===Dehydration===
A determination of whether or not the person has [[dehydration]] is an important part of the assessment, with dehydration typically divided into mild (3–5%), moderate (6–9%), and severe (≥10%) cases.&lt;ref name=EBMED2010/&gt; In children, the most accurate signs of moderate or severe dehydration are a prolonged [[capillary refill]], poor [[skin turgor]], and abnormal breathing.&lt;ref name=Tint10/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Steiner|first=MJ |author2=DeWalt, DA |author3=[[Julie Story Byerley|Byerley JS]]|title=Is this child dehydrated?|journal=JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association|date=9 June 2004 |volume=291|issue=22|pages=2746–54|pmid=15187057|doi=10.1001/jama.291.22.2746}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other useful findings (when used in combination) include sunken eyes, decreased activity, a lack of tears, and a dry mouth.&lt;ref name=EBMED2010/&gt; A normal urinary output and oral fluid intake is reassuring.&lt;ref name=Tint10/&gt; Laboratory testing is of little clinical benefit in determining the degree of dehydration.&lt;ref name=EBMED2010/&gt; Thus the use of urine testing or ultrasounds is generally not needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Freedman|first1=SB|last2=Vandermeer|first2=B|last3=Milne|first3=A|last4=Hartling|first4=L|last5=Pediatric Emergency Research Canada Gastroenteritis Study|first5=Group|title=Diagnosing clinically significant dehydration in children with acute gastroenteritis using noninvasive methods: a meta-analysis.|journal=The Journal of Pediatrics|date=April 2015|volume=166|issue=4|pages=908–916.e6|pmid=25641247|doi=10.1016/j.jpeds.2014.12.029}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Differential diagnosis===
Other potential causes of signs and symptoms that mimic those seen in gastroenteritis that need to be ruled out include [[appendicitis]], [[volvulus]], [[inflammatory bowel disease]], [[urinary tract infection]]s, and [[diabetes mellitus]].&lt;ref name=Webb2005/&gt; Pancreatic insufficiency, [[short bowel syndrome]], [[Whipple's disease]], [[coeliac disease]], and [[laxative]] abuse should also be considered.&lt;ref name="Oxford"&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Warrell D.A. |editor2=Cox T.M. |editor3=Firth J.D. |editor4=Benz E.J. |title=The Oxford Textbook of Medicine |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2003 |isbn=0-19-262922-0 |edition=4th |url=http://otm.oxfordmedicine.com/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321002102/http://otm.oxfordmedicine.com/ |archivedate=2012-03-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The differential diagnosis can be complicated somewhat if the person exhibits ''only'' vomiting or diarrhea (rather than both).&lt;ref name=EBMED2010/&gt;

Appendicitis may present with vomiting, abdominal pain, and a small amount of diarrhea in up to 33% of cases.&lt;ref name=EBMED2010/&gt; This is in contrast to the large amount of diarrhea that is typical of gastroenteritis.&lt;ref name=EBMED2010/&gt; Infections of the lungs or urinary tract in children may also cause vomiting or diarrhea.&lt;ref name=EBMED2010/&gt; Classical [[diabetic ketoacidosis]] (DKA) presents with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, but without diarrhea.&lt;ref name=EBMED2010/&gt; One study found that 17% of children with DKA were initially diagnosed as having gastroenteritis.&lt;ref name=EBMED2010/&gt;

==Prevention==
[[File:RotavirusV2009.gif|thumb|upright=1.3|Percentage of rotavirus tests with positive results, by surveillance week, United States, July 2000 – June 2009.]]

===Lifestyle===
A supply of easily accessible uncontaminated water and good [[sanitation]] practices are important for reducing rates of infection and clinically significant gastroenteritis.&lt;ref name=M93/&gt; Personal measures (such as [[hand washing]] with soap) have been found to decrease rates of gastroenteritis in both the developing and developed world by as much as 30%.&lt;ref name=Tint10/&gt; Alcohol-based gels may also be effective.&lt;ref name=Tint10/&gt; Food or drink that is thought to be contaminated should be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Viral Gastroenteritis |url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/revb/gastro/faq.htm |work=Center for Disease Control and Prevention |accessdate=16 April 2012 |date=February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424073547/http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/revb/gastro/faq.htm |archivedate=24 April 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Breastfeeding]] is important, especially in places with poor hygiene, as is improvement of hygiene generally.&lt;ref name=Web09/&gt; Breast milk reduces both the frequency of infections and their duration.&lt;ref name=EBMED2010/&gt;

===Vaccination===
Due to both its effectiveness and safety, in 2009 the World Health Organization recommended that the [[rotavirus vaccine]] be offered to all children globally.&lt;ref name=Sz2010&gt;{{cite journal|last=Szajewska|first=H|author2=Dziechciarz, P|title=Gastrointestinal infections in the pediatric population.|journal=Current Opinion in Gastroenterology|date=January 2010 |volume=26|issue=1|pages=36–44|pmid=19887936|doi=10.1097/MOG.0b013e328333d799}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WHORota2009&gt;{{cite journal|last=World Health Organization|title=Rotavirus vaccines: an update|journal=Weekly epidemiological record|date=December 2009|volume=84|pages=533–540|pmid=20034143|url=http://www.who.int/wer/2009/wer8451_52.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=10 May 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120709034841/http://www.who.int/wer/2009/wer8451_52.pdf|archivedate=9 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gastroenteritis is usually an acute and self-limiting disease that does not require medication.&lt;ref name=NICE2009/&gt; The preferred treatment in those with mild to moderate [[dehydration]] is [[oral rehydration therapy]] (ORT).&lt;ref name=BMJ2007 /&gt; For children at risk of dehydration from vomiting, taking a single dose of the [[antiemetic|anti vomiting]] medication [[metoclopramide]] or [[ondansetron]], may be helpful,&lt;ref name=Fedorowicz2011&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fedorowicz|first=Zbys|last2=Jagannath|first2=Vanitha A.|last3=Carter|first3=Ben|date=2011-09-07|title=Antiemetics for reducing vomiting related to acute gastroenteritis in children and adolescents|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|issue=9|pages=CD005506|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005506.pub5|issn=1469-493X|pmid=21901699}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[butylscopolamine]] is useful in treating [[abdominal pain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Tytgat GN |title=Hyoscine butylbromide: a review of its use in the treatment of abdominal cramping and pain |journal=Drugs |volume=67 |issue=9 |pages=1343–57 |year=2007 |pmid=17547475 |doi=10.2165/00003495-200767090-00007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rehydration===

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5517">'''Harold Elford Johns''', [[Order of Canada|OC]] (4 July 1915 &amp;ndash; 23 August 1998) was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[medical physics|medical physicist]], noted for his extensive contributions to the use of [[ionizing radiation]] to treat [[cancer]].

==Early life and education==
Johns was born to missionary parents in [[Szechuan]], [[China]]. He lived in China until 1926, when political unrest there prompted his parents to return to [[North America]]. After spending time in [[Tacoma, Washington]], and in [[Brandon, Manitoba]], his family settled in [[Hamilton, Ontario]].

In Hamilton, Johns pursued a degree in [[mathematics]] and [[physics]] at [[McMaster University]], and he completed his [[bachelor of science]] degree (B.Sc.) in 1936. He then moved to the [[University of Toronto]], where he earned his [[Master of Arts]] and [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (Ph.D.) degrees in physics in 1939.

==Early career==
Johns' graduation coincided with the start of [[World War II]]. For the duration of the war, he taught physics, mathematics, [[radar|radar systems]], and [[radio navigation]] to newly recruited airplane pilots as part of the [[British Commonwealth Air Training Plan]]. Based on his [[radiography]] and physics experience, Johns was also involved in non-invasive [[X-ray]] testing of metal aircraft castings. A meeting in August 1946 with [[William Valentine Mayneord]], while Mayneord was at the Atomic Energy Project at [[Chalk River, Ontario]], contributed to Johns's making a career in medical physics.

Johns married his wife, Sybil Hawkins Johns, in 1940. Their marriage lasted until Johns's death fifty-eight years later.

==Development of cobalt-60 in medical treatment ==
After the close of the war, Johns was invited to work with Ertle Harrington at the [[University of Saskatchewan]]. It was there that he conducted his pioneering research in the use of [[cobalt-60]] as a [[gamma ray]] source for the [[radiation therapy]] in cases of [[cancer]].

Interest in nuclear technology exploded in post-war Canada. Nuclear research facilities constructed at the [[Chalk River Laboratories]], [[Chalk River, Ontario]] near the end of the war were expanded and opened to civilian research projects. The first operational nuclear reactor outside the United States - the [[NRX]] - was located at Chalk River, and it provided a source of activated cobalt-60 for Johns's experiments.

Two groups - Johns's at the University of Saskatchewan, and another one in [[London, Ontario]] - designed and constructed [[external beam radiotherapy]] instruments using radioactive cobalt sources. The first treatment of a patient using the new source was carried out in London, Ontario, on 27 October 1951. In November 1951, the first Saskatoon patient, a 43-year-old mother of four, was treated for cervical cancer with a carefully calibrated dose of cobalt-60 radiation.

In early 1952, ''[[Maclean's]]'' magazine had dubbed the cobalt-source radiotherapy machine the ''cobalt bomb'' - a tongue-in-cheek tribute to this peaceful use of nuclear technology.

Johns's original treatment device was used in Saskatchewan until 1972.

==Ontario Cancer Institute==
In 1956, Johns assumed the headship of the physics division of the Ontario Cancer Institute at [[Princess Margaret Hospital (Toronto)|Princess Margaret Hospital]] in Toronto.

To further scientific and medical collaborations between radiologists, radiotherapists, physicians, and physicists, Johns guided the creation of the Graduate Department in Medical Biophysics at the University of Toronto in 1958.  Johns served as the second Chair of the Department, succeeding [[Arthur Ham]] in 1960.

Over the course of his career, Johns supervised sixty-eight graduate students, published more than two hundred peer-reviewed papers, and with [[John_R._Cunningham | John R. Cunningham]], published the textbook "The Physics of Radiology".

[[Image:Michael Jackson 1984.jpg|thumb|right|[[Michael Jackson]] at the [[White House]] in 1984]]
[[Michael Jackson]]&lt;!--NOTE: Per WP:BOLDTITLE, the name "Michael Jackson" should not be bolded in this case.--&gt; (August 29, 1958 – June 25, 2009) was an American singer who spent over four decades in the public eye, first as a child star with [[the Jackson 5]], and later as a solo artist. From the mid-1980s, Jackson's appearance began to change dramatically. The shape of his face, particularly his nose, triggered widespread speculation of extensive [[Plastic surgery|cosmetic surgery]].&lt;ref name="tara 434–436"&gt;Taraborrelli, pp. 434–436&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Margo DeMello"&gt;{{cite book|author= DeMello|title=Faces around the World: A Cultural Encyclopedia of the Human Face|isbn=1598846183|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|year=2012|page=152|accessdate=April 24, 2017|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=39B8fpdg_NwC&amp;pg=PA152}}&lt;/ref&gt; His skin tone became much lighter. Although Jackson was diagnosed with the skin disorder [[vitiligo]], which results in white patches on the skin, and said that he had not purposely [[Skin whitening|bleached his skin]] but had used makeup to even out his skin tone,&lt;ref name="Oprah-Jackson"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Michael Jackson Interview: Oprah Reflects |publisher=[[Oprah.com]]|page=3|date=February 10, 1993|accessdate=April 24, 2017|url=http://www.oprah.com/entertainment/oprah-reflects-on-her-interview-with-michael-jackson#ixzz4fE7McUFS}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was widely suggested that his lighter skin tone was partly due to skin bleaching.&lt;ref name="tara 434–436"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Margo DeMello"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hegde"&gt;{{cite book|author=Radha Sarma Hegde|title=Circuits of Visibility: Gender and Transnational Media Cultures|isbn=0814744680|publisher=[[NYU Press]]|year=2011|pages=75–77|accessdate=April 24, 2017|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dXaPIHee5GkC&amp;pg=PA75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jackson and some of his siblings said they had been physically and psychologically abused by their father, [[Joseph Jackson (manager)|Joseph Jackson]]. In 2003, Joseph admitted to whipping them as children, but emphatically rejected the longstanding abuse allegations.&lt;ref name="Whipping"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/8121599.stm] [[BBC News]], June 27, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Duke"&gt;{{cite press release|first= Alan |last= Duke |url= http://edition.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/Music/07/21/joe.jackson/index.html |title= Joe Jackson denies abusing Michael |date= July 21, 2009 |agency= CNN|accessdate= May 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The whippings deeply traumatized Jackson and may have led to the onset of further health problems later in his life. Physicians speculated that he had [[body dysmorphic disorder]].&lt;ref name=Posner&gt;Posner, Gerald. [http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2009-07-02/chopra-michael-jackson-could-have-been-saved/ Deepak Chopra: How Michael Jackson Could Have Been Saved], ''The Daily Beast'', July 2, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

At some point during the 1990s, it appeared that Jackson had become dependent on [[Pharmaceutical drug|prescription drugs]], mainly [[Analgesic|painkillers]] and strong [[sedative]]s. The drug use was later linked to [[Burn|second- and third-degree burns]] he had suffered years before. Jackson gradually became dependent on these drugs and his health deteriorated. He went into [[drug rehabilitation|rehabilitation]] [[1993 child sexual abuse accusations against Michael Jackson|in 1993]].&lt;ref name = "campbell (1995) 89-93"&gt;Campbell (1995), pp. 89–93&lt;/ref&gt;

While preparing for a series of [[This Is It (concerts)|comeback concerts]] scheduled to begin in July 2009, [[Death of Michael Jackson|Jackson died]] of acute [[propofol]] and [[benzodiazepine]] intoxication after suffering [[cardiac arrest]] on June 25, 2009. [[Trial of Conrad Murray|His personal physician]] was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in his death and sentenced to four years in prison.

==Skin color==

[[File:Michael Jackson gives autograph - supercropped.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Jackson in 1988, in the middle of his skin transformation]]
Jackson's skin was a medium-brown color throughout his youth; however, starting in the mid-1980s, it gradually grew paler. This was partly due to [[vitiligo]] (a long-term skin condition characterized by patches of the skin [[depigmentation|losing their pigment]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/HEALTH/07/06/skin.color.vitiligo/|title=In life of mysteries, Jackson's changed color baffled public|website=www.cnn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also widely considered to be due to [[Skin whitening|skin bleaching]] and changing of his features to appear [[White people|white]].&lt;ref name="Margo DeMello"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hegde"/&gt; The cause of vitiligo is unknown,&lt;ref name=Lancet2016&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ezzedine|first1=K|last2=Eleftheriadou|first2=V|last3=Whitton|first3=M|last4=van Geel|first4=N|title=Vitiligo.|journal=Lancet|date=4 July 2015|volume=386|issue=9988|pages=74–84|pmid=25596811|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(14)60763-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it is believed to be due to [[genetic susceptibility]] triggered by an environmental factor such that an [[autoimmune disease]] occurs.&lt;ref name=Lancet2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=NIH2014&gt;{{cite web|title=Questions and Answers about Vitiligo|url=http://www.niams.nih.gov/health_info/Vitiligo/default.asp|website=NIAMS|accessdate=11 August 2016|date=June 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821083604/http://niams.nih.gov/health_info/Vitiligo/default.asp|archivedate=21 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biographer J. Randy Taraborrelli stated that Jackson began making his nose smaller around the same time his skin became gradually lighter, and was using the over-the-counter skin-bleaching cream, Porcelana, to achieve the lighter skin.&lt;ref&gt;MICHAEL JACKSON: The Magic, the Madness, the Whole Story, 1958-2009 by J. Randy Taraborrelli, pg 351&lt;/ref&gt; Jackson's physical changes gained widespread media coverage, and provoked criticism from the public.&lt;ref name="Margo DeMello"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hegde"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "campbell (1995) 14-16"/&gt; Some African-American psychologists argued Jackson was "a lousy role model for black youth". Dr. Dennis Chestnut said Jackson had given "black youth a feeling that they can achieve", but might encourage them to believe they had to be esoteric and idiosyncratic to be successful. It was also presumed that Jackson bleached his skin just to boost his career. Dr. Halford Fairchild stated Jackson and other African-American celebrities would try "to look more like white people in order to get in films and on television".&lt;ref&gt;Hodges, Sam. [http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1987-09-24/lifestyle/0150070155_1_janet-jackson-black-psychologists-michael-jackson], ''[[Orlando Sentinel]]'', September 24, 1987. Retrieved February 4, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Jackson has also been confronted with the reaction of  the people around him. Filmmaker [[John Landis]], who directed two music videos for Jackson, said when Jackson showed him his bleached chest, he told him the doctor who had done it was a criminal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citejournal|last=Hiatt|first=Brian|last2=Greene|first2=Andy|last3=Knopper|first3=Steve|last4=Wild|first4=David|year=2009|title=What went wrong|journal=Rolling Stone|issue=Special Commemorative Issue Michael Jackson 1958-2009|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in 1993, Jackson told [[Oprah Winfrey]] "there, as I know of, there is no such thing as skin bleaching. I've never seen it, I don't know what it is." He stated he had a skin disorder (vitiligo) and also stated that the disorder was hereditary; he also said he used make-up to even out the uneven skin tone. "It is something I cannot help," explained Jackson. "When people make up stories that I don't want to be who I am, it hurts me. It's a problem for me. I can't control it. But what about all the millions of people who sit in the sun to become darker, to become other than what they are. Nobody says nothing about that."&lt;ref name="Oprah-Jackson"/&gt; Winfrey's interview of Jackson was watched by 62&amp;nbsp;million Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Thriller for Diane Sawyer: Interview with Jackson Two |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/1995/05/18/1995-05-18_thriller_for_diane_sawyer__i.html |date=May 18, 1995|work=Daily News |location=New York |accessdate=July 3, 2009 }} {{Dead link|date=April 2014|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also started a public discourse on the topic of vitiligo, then a relatively unknown condition.&lt;ref name = "campbell (1995) 14-16"&gt;Campbell (1995), pp. 14–16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "lewis 165-168"&gt;Lewis pp. 165–168&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="george pp. 45-46"&gt;George, pp. 45–46&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "brisbane on vitiligo"&gt;[http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/articles/2007/12/18/1197740229199.html 'I'm a black man turning white on television'"], ''BrisbaneTimes'', December 18, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Jackson had publicly stated that he was proud to be black.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/michael-jackson-what-went-wrong-20090730|title=Michael Jackson: What Went Wrong|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote a letter to photographer William Pecchi Jr. in 1988 which reads: "Maybe I look at the world through rose colored glasses but I love people all over the world. That is why stories of racism really disturb me. [...] Because in truth I believe ALL men are created equal, I was taught that and will always believe it. I just can't conceive of how a person could hate another because of skin color. I love every race on the planet earth. Prejudice is the child of ignorance. Naked we come into the world and naked we shall go out. And a very good thing too, for it reminds me that I am naked under my shirt, whatever its color."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.juliensauctions.com/auctions/2009/music-icons/michael-jackson-16.html |title=Michael Jackson handwritten letter regarding "Moonwalker" |date= |accessdate=March 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly following Jackson's death, tubes of Benoquin and hydroquinone were found in Jackson's home. Both creams are commonly used to treat vitiligo; Dr. David Sawcer said some patients with vitiligo remove dark areas of skin when most of their skin has become pale.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony McCartney,&lt;/ref&gt; Darkening depigmented skin is also extremely difficult.&lt;ref name="news.google.com"&gt;Rebecca Howard, Gadsden Times, Michael Jackson's skin condition destroys pigment, https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1891&amp;dat=19930215&amp;id=Xr4fAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=RtgEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1295,1897473,February 15, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; Depigmentation causes a permanent and extreme sensitivity to the sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avrf.org/treatments/medical.htm|title=Medical Treatments - Treatments &amp; Products|website=www.avrf.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vitiligo patients are at risk to contract [[melanoma]], and an annual cancer check-up is recommended.&lt;ref name="avrf.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avrf.org/facts/sun.htm|title=Self Care and Sun Safety|website=www.avrf.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another common way of treating vitiligo is using makeup to camouflage depigmented skin.&lt;ref name="avrf.org"/&gt; The treatments Jackson used for his condition further lightened his skin tone, and with the application of [[makeup|pancake makeup]] to even out his skin tone, he could appear very pale.&lt;ref name = "tara 434–436"/&gt; Jackson also covered his skin disorder with clothing wearing long sleeves and long pants. In the music video for "[[Remember the Time#Music video|Remember the Time]]", all dancers and actors except for Jackson are lightly dressed following the example set by ancient Egyptians.&lt;ref name="Bush"&gt;Bush, Michael. ''The King Of Style''. Insight Editions, 2012, p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; Jackson usually avoided wearing patterned clothing to avoid attention to the disorder.&lt;ref&gt;name="Bush", p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jackson's autopsy confirmed that he had vitiligo.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Duke|first1=Alan|title=Autopsy reveals Michael Jackson's secrets|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/05/07/showbiz/jackson-death-trial/index.html|website=CNN|accessdate=January 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autopsyfiles.org/reports/Celebs/jackson,%20michael_report.pdf |title=Autopsy Report for Michael Jackson |date= |accessdate=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His skin was found to have reduced (though not absent) [[melanocyte]]s, the cells active in skin pigmentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/crime/michael-jackson-autopsy-report |title=Michael Jackson Autopsy Report |work=The Smoking Gun |date= |accessdate=November 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vitiligo occurs in three different patterns. Segmental depigmentation means only one side of the body is affected, whereas generalized  depigmentation means many parts of the body are affected.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avrf.org/facts/signs.htm|title=Vitiligo Signs and Symptoms|website=www.avrf.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jackson's autopsy report states a "focal depigmentation of the skin"&lt;ref name="thesmokinggun.com"&gt;Michael Jackson Autopsy Report, p. 4, http://www.thesmokinggun.com/file/michael-jackson-autopsy-report?page=0&lt;/ref&gt; (i.e., the depigmentation occurs on one or a few areas of the body).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In Jackson's case, there were five affected areas.&lt;ref name="thesmokinggun.com"/&gt; When Jackson was diagnosed with vitiligo in the mid-1980s, he started to learn more about the disease. He would often call his [[Dermatology|dermatologist]]'s nurse and future wife [[Deborah Jeanne Rowe|Debbie Rowe]] to get medical information as well as emotional support.&lt;ref name="taraborreli p. 570"&gt;Taraborrelli, p. 570&lt;/ref&gt;

Taraborrelli stated that Jackson was diagnosed with discoid [[Discoid lupus erythematosus|lupus]]. To treat this condition, Jackson had [[hydroxychloroquine]] injected directly into his scalp regularly. He also used Solaquin, Retin A and Benoquin and had to avoid sun exposure more than ever. Taraborrelli stated the lupus was on [[remission (medicine)|remission]] later. Jackson's autopsy did not confirm or refute the claim that he had lupus.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

Over time, Jackson's facial structure changed as well.

However, the surgery was not a complete success, and he complained of breathing difficulties that would affect his career.

In his book, Jackson attributed the changes in the structure of his face to [[puberty]], a strict vegetarian diet, weight loss, a change in hair style and stage lighting.&lt;ref name = "jackson 229-230"/&gt; Jackson denied allegations that he had altered his eyes.&lt;ref name="jackson p. 256"&gt;Jackson, p. 256&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1992, the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' ran a full front-page picture, allegedly of Jackson's face, which they described as "hideously disfigured" by plastic surgery. Jackson sued the tabloid, and, in 1998, they agreed to an out-of-court settlement with Jackson. At the High Court, the paper's former editor acknowledged that after meeting Jackson in person, he believed that Jackson was neither hideously disfigured nor scarred at all. A ''Daily Mirror'' solicitor maintained that the publication did not tamper with the picture.&lt;ref name="BBCNews"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/210759.stm|title=Mirror says sorry for Jackson libel |publisher=BBC |date=November 9, 1998 |accessdate=July 29, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health concerns==

According to Dr. Neil Ratner, Jackson suffered a back injury in July 1997 after one of the stages collapsed during a concert in Munich, Germany. However, the ''History Tour'' continued; there was only one concert canceled after the fatal accident of Princess Diana about two months later.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Duke, AEG exec: I didn't know Michael Jackson abused drugs, http://edition.cnn.com/2013/06/03/showbiz/jackson-death-trial/index.html June 3, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, such an incident happened during a charity concert in Munich in 1999.

On March 10, 2005, Jackson appeared late in court after having received treatment in a hospital&lt;ref name="Aphrodite Jones p. 80"&gt;Aphrodite Jones, Michael Jackson Conspiracy, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; due to a back problem.&lt;ref name="articles.chicagotribune.com"&gt;Tim Molloy, Chicago Tribune, Jackson at hospital again, for back pain, June 6, 2005 http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2005-06-06/news/0506060175_1_neverland-ranch-raymone-bain-molestation-trial&lt;/ref&gt; During the trial, Jackson occasionally needed help to get to his seat.&lt;ref name="Aphrodite Jones p. 80"/&gt; On June 5, 2005, Jackson was taken to the emergency room at the Santa Ynez Valley Cottage Hospital to seek treatment of a back pain.

Dr. Christopher Rogers testified in the trial against Dr. Conrad Murray that, in his opinion, Jackson "was healthier than the average person of his age." &lt;ref name="abc7_8387361"/&gt; Rogers said the arteries around Jackson's heart were free of fat and cholesterol, which is unusual for a 50-year-old individual.&lt;ref name="news.sky.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.sky.com/story/890744/jackson-trial-pathologist-death-was-homicide|title=Jackson Trial|website=Sky News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Childhood and mental health===

Another publicly discussed aspect of Jackson's private life is his childhood, particularly his relationship with his father, [[Joe Jackson (manager)|Joseph]]. Although Jackson credited his father's strict discipline with playing a large role in his success,&lt;ref name="Secret"&gt;{{cite news|title= Michael Jackson's Secret Childhood |url= http://www.vh1.com/shows/dyn/vh1_news_presents/82010/episode_about.jhtml |publisher= [[VH1]] |date= June 20, 2008 |archivedate= September 15, 2008 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080915120706/http://www.vh1.com/shows/dyn/vh1_news_presents/82010/episode_about.jhtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taraborrelli, 2009, pp. 20–2.&lt;/ref&gt; he and [[Jackson family|some of his siblings]] stated that they were physically and mentally abused by Joseph from a young age through incessant rehearsals, whippings, and the use of derogatory names such as "big nose" for Michael; this abuse affected Michael throughout his life.&lt;ref name="MJ's secret childhood"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/shows/dyn/vh1_news_presents/82010/episode_about.jhtml |title=Michael Jackson's Secret Childhood |publisher=[[VH1]] |accessdate=June 20, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915120706/http://www.vh1.com/shows/dyn/vh1_news_presents/82010/episode_about.jhtml |archivedate=September 15, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Jackson interview seen by 14m |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/2719763.stm |work= BBC News Online |date= February 4, 2003 |accessdate= May 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one altercation—later recalled by [[Marlon Jackson]]—Joseph held Michael upside down by one leg and "pummeled him over and over again with his hand, hitting him on his back and buttocks." Joseph would often trip the boys or push them into walls. One night while Jackson was asleep, Joseph climbed into his room through the bedroom window. Wearing a fright mask, he entered the room screaming and shouting. Joseph said he wanted to teach his children not to leave the window open when they went to sleep. For a number of years afterward, Jackson suffered nightmares about being kidnapped from his bedroom.&lt;ref name = "tara 20-22"&gt;Taraborrelli, pp. 20–22&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early 1980s, Jackson was deeply unhappy; Jackson explained, "Even at home, I'm lonely. I sit in my room sometimes and cry. It's so hard to make friends... I sometimes walk around the neighborhood at night, just hoping to find someone to talk to. But I just end up coming home."&lt;ref&gt;Taraborrelli, p. 206&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it had been reported for a number of years that Jackson had an abusive childhood, he first spoke openly about it in his 1993 interview with [[Oprah Winfrey]].

I'd start to regurgitate. I'm sorry... Please don't be mad at me... But I do love him."&lt;ref name="taraborrelli p. 620"&gt;Taraborrelli, p. 620&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with [[Martin Bashir]] for the 2003 documentary ''[[Living with Michael Jackson]]'', Jackson covered his face with his hand and began crying when talking about his childhood abuse,&lt;ref name = "tara 20-22"/&gt; recalling that Joe often sat in a chair with a belt in his hand as he and his siblings rehearsed, and that "if you didn't do it the right way, he would tear you up, really get you."&lt;ref name="LJ1658"&gt;Lewis Jones, 2005, pp. 165–68.&lt;/ref&gt; Also that year, Joe acknowledged that he regularly whipped Jackson as a boy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Can Michael Jackson's demons be explained? |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/8121599.stm |publisher= [[BBC News Online]] |date= June 27, 2009 |accessdate= May 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he and Jackson's mother, Katherine, have disputed the longstanding allegations of abuse, with Katherine stating that while whipping is considered abuse today, it was a common way to discipline children at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|title= Katherine Jackson: Michael's strict upbringing not abuse |date= May 15, 2012 |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldyRUqGN3XA |accessdate= May 31, 2015 |format= video |publisher= CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first= Roger |last= Friedman |date= February 7, 2003 |title= Michael Jackson's Unacceptable Behavior Revealed |url= http://www.foxnews.com/story/2003/02/07/michael-jackson-unacceptable-behavior-revealed.html |publisher= [[Fox News Channel]] |accessdate= May 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Duke"/&gt;

In 2003, Jackson was accused of [[child sexual abuse]] and was [[People v. Jackson|acquitted two years later]]. During the investigation, Jackson's profile was examined by Stan Katz, a [[mental health]] professional, who also spent several hours with the accuser. According to Taraborrelli, the assessment made by Katz was that Jackson had become a regressed ten-year-old.&lt;ref name="taraborreli p. 648"&gt;Taraborrelli, p. 648&lt;/ref&gt; Some medical professionals have publicly stated their belief that Jackson also had [[body dysmorphic disorder]], a psychological condition whereby the sufferer has no concept of how his or her physical appearance is perceived by others.&lt;ref name = "tara 434–436"/&gt;

===Drug addiction===
In none of Jackson's hospitalizations, including the one in late 1995, did medics find drugs in Jackson's system.&lt;ref name="Rock Hill doctor helped saved Michael Jackson's life after 1995 rehearsal collapse"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.skinalley.com |title=SkinAlley |publisher=Skin Care Alley |date=July 8, 2016|accessdate=February 23, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rock Hill doctor helped saved Michael Jackson's life after 1995 rehearsal collapse (free version)"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://prince.org/msg/8/313283?pg=19 |title=v |publisher=HeraldOnline |date=July 8, 2009|accessdate=February 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taraborrelli states the entertainer took [[Valium]], [[Xanax]] and [[Ativan]] in 1993.&lt;ref name = "tara 518"&gt;Taraborrelli, p. 518&lt;/ref&gt; While Jackson himself does not mention sedatives, he stated that painkillers were prescribed to soothe excruciating pain that he was suffering after recent reconstructive surgery on his scalp resulting from his accident in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;http://"Michael Jackson Ends Tour, Citing Addiction", ''The New York Times'' November 14, 1993, www.nytimes.com/1993/11/14/us/michael-jackson-ends-tour-citing-addiction.html Retrieved on March 21, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In a court deposition unrelated to alleged child abuse, Jackson was visibly drowsy, lacked concentration, and repeatedly slurred while speaking. He could not remember the dates of his prior album releases or names of people he had worked with. It took him several minutes to name some of his recent albums.&lt;ref name = "campbell 96-97"&gt;Campbell (1995), pp. 96–97&lt;/ref&gt;

Jackson also stated during the 1993 interview that he first began taking painkiller medications regularly in 1984. On January 24 of that year, Jackson was filming a Pepsi commercial when his hair caught on fire from faulty pyrotechnics on stage that were intended to be part of one of many being filmed. He sustained [[second-degree burns]] to his scalp and never fully recovered from the injury or from the lingering pain. He reportedly began taking the painkillers after refusing at first in order to deal with the intense pain.

On November 9, and November 10, 1993, Jackson was questioned about a copyright matter. According to the sworn declaration from the plaintiffs' lawyer, he had been told that Jackson "was taking painkillers because of recent oral surgery."

In November 1993, Jackson announced that he was addicted to painkillers; he said he had recently undergone a scalp surgery, and the painkillers had been prescribed. Jackson said due to the pressure caused by the child molestation allegations and the energy he needed for the ''Dangerous Tour,'' he was "physically and emotionally exhausted." He said he had "become increasingly more dependent on painkillers," and would seek treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Sander, Kentucky New Era, Dangerous Tour canceled by Jackson's drug addiction, https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=tY5KAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=iYYMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6690,3371887&amp;dq=michael+jackson+tour+canceled&amp;hl=en, November 13, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; His lawyers said Jackson would be treated for addiction overseas for one and a half months to two months.&lt;ref name="HamiltonCros"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hamilton |first1=William |last2=Cros|first2=Jessica|date=November 16, 1993 |title=Jackson Treated Overseas for Addiction |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1993/11/16/jackson-treated-overseas-for-addiction/eebbf306-8549-4f42-8af5-6d401719b319/ |work=The Washington Post |location= |access-date=May 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1993, Jackson returned to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;William Hamilton, Michael Jackson back in U.S. to face charges, The Washington Post, https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/8577853.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS&amp;date=Dec+14%2C+1993&amp;author=Hamilton%2C+William&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=C1&amp;desc=Michael+Jackson+back+in+U.S.+to+face+charges, December 14, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

Jackson was taken to Charter Nightingale Clinic where he was searched for drugs on entry; vials of medicine were found in a suitcase. He was put on Valium [[Intravenous therapy|IV]] to wean him from painkillers. The singer's spokesperson then told reporters that Jackson was "barely able to function adequately on an intellectual level."&lt;ref name = "campbell (1995) 89-93"/&gt; While in the clinic, Jackson took part in group and one-on-one therapy sessions.&lt;ref name = "tara 526-528"&gt;Taraborrelli, pp. 526–528&lt;/ref&gt; According to Taraborrelli, in January 2004, as his trial approached, Jackson became dependent on [[morphine]] and [[Demerol]] and was being treated for this dependency by herbalist [[Alfredo Bowman]] in Colorado.&lt;ref name="taraborrelli p. 661"&gt;Taraborrelli, p. 661&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with Aphrodite Jones, [[Patrick Treacy]], a cosmetic surgeon who treated Jackson between July 2006 and early 2007, as well as shortly before his death, stated that he would have known if Jackson would have been also treated by another physician and that he never saw any drugs in the house. He also said that Jackson did not have [[insomnia]] and never asked him for narcotics. Treacy stated Jackson was in good physical health; he said Jackson always insisted on the presence of an anesthetist when Propofol was administered.&lt;ref&gt;http://investigation.discovery.com/tv-shows/true-crime-with-aphrodite-jones/videos/true-crime-with-aphrodite-jones-michael-jacksons-drug-use.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Jackson was 5&amp;nbsp;ft. 9 in. and weighed 136&amp;nbsp;lbs, which would be within a normal weight range, although he was thin, Dr. Rogers testified in court.&lt;ref name="news.sky.com"/&gt; According to his costumer Michael Bush, Jackson lost so much weight during a concert due to loss of water that the costumes Jackson wore at the end of the show had to be smaller than those he wore at the beginning of the show; usually, he was a 28-inch waist.&lt;ref&gt;Sandy Cohen, Michael Jackson's longtime costumer unveils book, http://www.denverpost.com/entertainment/ci_21198453/michael-jacksons-longtime-costumer-unveils-book, July 31, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; 
According to Dr. Nader Kamangar, a sleeping expert at UCLA, drugs such as Demerol can cause insomnia. In the case of Jackson, insomnia could have been caused by "anxiety for performing" as well.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Duke, 'Perfect storm' of drugs killed Michael Jackson, sleep expert says, http://edition.cnn.com/2011/10/13/justice/california-conrad-murray-trial, October 14, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Jackson's death, a police warrant issued against his attending physician, Conrad Murray, stated that Jackson's many doctors had used nineteen distinct aliases, such as "Omar Arnold," "Josephine Baker," "Fernand Diaz," "Paul Farance," "Peter Madonie," "Faheem Muhammad," "Roselyn Muhammad," "Blanca Nicholas," "Jimmy Nicholas," "Bryan Singleton," "Frank Tyson," and "Rob Kaufman" while prescribing medications for Jackson.

==Death==
{{Main|Death of Michael Jackson}}
Following Jackson's death on June 25, 2009, reports of his use of [[pethidine]] (Demerol) surfaced.&lt;ref name="reuters"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/mediaNews/idUSN2736130520090627|title=UPDATE 3 - Jackson's family seeks second autopsy|date=June 27, 2009|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=July 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cherilyn Lee, a nurse who provided nutritional counseling to Jackson, said that on April 12, 2009, he had asked her for unspecified "products for sleep". On April 19, 2009, he told her the only medicine that would help was propofol.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Kasindorf, Nurse: Jackson thought propofol safe with monitoring, http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/story/2011-10-25/michael-jackson-doctor-trial/50906890/1, Retrieved on February 17, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Lee refused, telling him, "Michael, the only problem with you taking this medication ... is you're going to take it and you're not going to wake up." Jackson dismissed the warning, telling her he had been given the drug before by IV injection and that his doctor told him it was safe.&lt;ref name="metromix"&gt;{{cite news|last=Elber | first=Lynn| url=http://losangeles.metromix.com/home/article/ap-exclusive-michael-jackson/1294208/content|title=AP Exclusive: Michael Jackson, bedeviled by insomnia, begged for drug, says nurse-nutritionist|date=June 30, 2009|agency=Associated Press|publisher=Metromix Los Angeles|accessdate=July 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He did not name the doctor.  An overdose of propofol can cause the patient to [[respiratory arrest|stop breathing]], leading to a shortage of oxygen and a buildup of [[carbon dioxide]] in the body which can lead to [[arrhythmias]] and cardiac arrest.&lt;ref&gt;AP Exclusive: Michael Jackson, bedeviled by insomnia, begged for drug, says nurse-nutritionist, by Lynn Elber, ''[[Associated Press]]'', http://www.startribune.com/templates/Print_This_Story?sid=49548732, July 1, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to an inquiry about a cancellation insurance for the upcoming tour, insurance carriers demanded a medical exam by a doctor they trusted. In February 2009, Jackson had an examination performed by Dr. David Slavit of New York. Later, the broker told an AEG senior vice president Jackson had only slight hay fever and had passed the exam "with flying colors". A second medical exam was supposed to take place on July 6, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Witness: Michael Jackson passed medical exam 'with flying colors', Corina Knoll, http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-michael-jackson-medical-exam-20130522,0,2369606.story?track=rss May 22, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Lee, she received a frantic call on June 21, 2009, from an aide on Jackson's staff. The aide reported that Jackson was feeling ill. Lee reported overhearing Jackson complain that one side of his body was hot, the other side cold. She believed that somebody had given him something that affected his central nervous system. She advised the aide to take him to the hospital.&lt;ref name = "metromix"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rs"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/michael-jackson-desperately-sought-sedative-nutritionist-says-20090630|title=Michael Jackson "Desperately" Sought Sedative, Nutritionist Says|date=June 30, 2009|agency=Associated Press|work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=July 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his death, the autopsy report revealed that Jackson had a strong heart and was a "fairly healthy" 50-year-old. According to [[BBC]], his weight was in the acceptable range for a man of his height, but he had punctured arms&lt;ref group=H&gt;"Punctured arms" presumably describes [[hypodermic needle]] wounds, while making no effort to distinguish [[phlebotomy]] from [[injection (medicine)|injection]] from [[intravenous therapy]], all of which involve hypodermic needles; nor does it distinguish whether hypodermic use was medical or non-medical, medically supervised or unsupervised.&lt;/ref&gt; and suffered from lung damage and some arthritis.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/8285841.stm|title=Jackson autopsy details revealed|date=October 1, 2009|publisher=BBC|accessdate=October 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The document shows that Jackson's most serious health problem was his chronically inflamed lungs, but this was not serious enough to be a contributing factor to his death. The post mortem did not uncover any physical problems that may  have limited Jackson's ability to perform.&lt;ref name = "bbc"/&gt; "His overall health was fine," said Dr. Zeev Kain of the [[University of California]], who reviewed the report for AP but was not involved in the post-mortem examination, "The results are in normal limits." The autopsy also revealed that he was partially bald and that his lips, eyebrows, and scalp were tattooed.&lt;ref name = "bbc"/&gt;

In 2011, Rogers said in his testimony: "The theory that seems less reasonable to me is that Mr. Jackson woke up, and although he was under the influence of sedative medications, managed to give himself another dose."&lt;ref name="abc7_8387361"/&gt;

'''Healthcare in Mexico''' is provided by public institutions, private entities, or private physicians. Healthcare delivered by private organizations operates on the [[free market]] system and is available to those who can afford it. That is also the case of healthcare obtained from private physicians at their private office or clinic.

Public healthcare delivery, on the other hand, is accomplished by an elaborate provisioning and delivery system put in place by the [[federal government of Mexico]]. In 2009, Mexico instituted [[universal healthcare]].&lt;ref name="hsph.harvard"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/features/mexico-universal-health/|title=Mexico achieves universal health coverage, enrolls 52.6 million people in less than a decade|publisher=Harvard School of Public Health |date=2012-08-15 |accessdate=2013-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of December 31, 2013, there were 4,466 [[hospital]]s in [[Mexico]].&lt;ref name="Global Health Intelligence"&gt;Global Health Intelligence, [http://www.globalhealthintelligence.com "Global Health Intelligence"]. Retrieved 19 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Hospicio Cabañas.JPG|thumb|[[Hospicio Cabañas]] in [[Guadalajara]] is a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]].]]

Hospitals were established in Mexico in the early 16th century, including ones exclusively for Indians. Some were established by the crown, others by private endowment, but most by the Catholic Church. Bishop [[Vasco de Quiroga]] established hospital complexes in [[Michoacan]] in the sixteenth century. In [[Mexico City]], conqueror [[Hernán Cortés]] established the [[Hospital de Jesús Nazareno]] for Indians, which still functions as a hospital.&lt;ref&gt;David Howard, ''The Royal Indian Hospital of Mexico City'', Tempe: Arizona State University Center for Latin American Studies, Special Studies 20, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carmen Venegas Ramírez, ''Régimen hospitalario para indios en la Nueva España''. Mexico 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Josefina Muriel, ''Hospitales de la Nueva España''. 2 vols. Mexico 1956-60.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hospicio Cabañas]] in [[Guadalajara]], [[Jalisco]], Mexico, was founded in 1791. It is still functioning and is now a [[World Heritage Site]]. It is one of the oldest and largest hospital complexes in [[Latin America]]. The complex was founded by the Bishop of Guadalajara to combine the functions of a [[workhouse]], hospital, [[orphanage]], and [[almshouse]].

The Mexican healthcare program [[Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social]] was founded in 1943, during the presidency of [[Manuel Avila Camacho]].&lt;ref name="usatoday"&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2009-08-31-mexico-health-care_N.htm ''Mexico's health care lures Americans.''] Chris Hawley. USA Today. 9/1/2009. Retrieved 24 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1990s, Mexico showed clear signs of having entered a transitional stage in the health of its population. Compared with 1940 or even 1970, 1990s Mexico had mortality patterns that more closely approximated those of developed societies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/mexico/63.htm ''Health Care and Social Security.''] Tim L. Merrill and Ramón Miró, editors. Mexico: A Country Study. Washington: GPO for the Library of Congress, 1996. (Quoted as: "Source: U.S. Library of Congress.") Retrieved 24 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; By 2009, during the notorious [[swine flu]] pandemic, the [[World Health Organization]] director said that Mexico "gave the world a model of rapid and transparent reporting, aggressive control measures, and generous sharing of data and samples."

The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]'s flu director, [[Nancy Cox (virologist)|Nancy Cox]], added that Mexico's response "impressed the entire world."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.optimum.net/News/AP/Article?articleId=579513&amp;categoryId=43 ''Mexico Wins Praise for Swine Flu Response.''] Maria Cheng (London) and Vicente Panetta (Buenos Aires). Associated Press. Retrieved 4 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Private healthcare delivery==
While private hospitals account for two thirds of all hospitals in Mexico, with 2,988 institutions, less than 10% of the Mexican population has private insurance coverage. Care is paid mainly "out of pocket."&lt;ref name="Global Health Intelligence"/&gt;

==Public healthcare delivery==
[[File:InstitutoNacCancerologiaDF.JPG|thumb|left|The Instituto Nacional de Cancerología]]

Public healthcare has an elaborate provisioning and delivery system instituted by the [[Mexican government]]. It is provided to all [[Mexican citizens]], as guaranteed by Article 4 of the [[Constitution of Mexico|Constitution]]. Public care is fully or partially subsidized by the federal government, depending upon the person's (Spanish: ''derechohabiente'') employment status. All Mexican citizens are eligible for subsidized healthcare regardless of their work status via a system of health care facilities operating under the federal [[Secretariat of Health]] (formerly the ''Secretariat de Salubridad y Asistencia'', or SSA) agency.

The [[Secretariat of Health]]'s ''Seguro Popular'' offers coverage to Mexicans who do not have formal employment.  The program currently covers over 55 million people.&lt;ref name="INEGI"&gt;Mexican National Statistics Institute, [http://www.inegi.org.mx/ "INEGI"]. Retrieved 22 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Employed citizens and their dependents, however, can use the program administered and operated by the [[Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social]] (IMSS) ({{lang-en|Mexican Social Security Institute}}). The IMSS program is a tripartite system funded equally by the employee, the private employer, and the federal government.  There are 58 million people covered through IMSS.

The IMSS does not provide service to public employees, who instead are serviced by the [[Instituto de Seguridad y Servicios Sociales de los Trabajadores del Estado]] (ISSSTE) ({{lang-en|Institute for Social Security and Services for State Workers)}}, which attends to the health and social care needs of government employees: local, state, and federal government employees. There are nearly 13 million people covered by ISSSTE.&lt;ref name="INEGI"/&gt;

The [[state governments of Mexico]] also provide health services independently of those that are provided by the federal government programs. In most states, the state government has established free or subsidized healthcare to all of its citizens.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sesa-qro.gob.mx/quienes.html ''Quienes Somos.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090721014005/http://www.sesa-qro.gob.mx/quienes.html |date=2009-07-21 }} Secretaria de Salud. Federal Government of Mexico. Retrieved 4 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Secretariat of Health is the largest public healthcare institution, operating 809 hospitals throughout the country.  The IMSS grants hospital care and services to employed citizens and their dependents and had 279 hospitals affiliated to it. The ISSSTE grants hospital care and services to government employees and has 115 affiliated hospitals. The other 279 hospitals are affiliated with 9 government dependencies, including State Facilities, [[Secretariat of National Defense]] (Secretaria de Defensa Nacional), [[Mexican Navy]] ([[Secretaria de Marina]]), Petroleos Mexicanos ([[PEMEX]]), and the [[Red Cross]] (Cruz Roja).&lt;ref&gt;National Health Information System, [http://www.sinais.salud.gob.mx/ "SINAIS"]. Retrieved 1 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hospitals are spread over a territory of 761,600 sq miles (1.973 million km²).  Thus, the public hospital infrastructure relies on a vast network of small hospitals. Over 50% of public hospitals have fewer than 50 beds.

During 2005, 45.5% of health spending was paid from public sources, comparable to the share of public spending in the United States but significantly below the OECD average. Private financing in Mexico is almost entirely in the form of [[out-of-pocket]] payments, as only 3.1% of total expenditures on health are funded through private health insurance.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt; Like every other major industrialized country (except the U.S.), government healthcare in Mexico is [[universal healthcare|universal]], making private programs' [[health insurance]] unnecessary except for private hospitals.

Some authorities have noted that while Mexico has some 3000 private hospitals, some private "hospitals" are hardly hospitals at all, since they have no [[medical laboratory|laboratories]], [[radiology|radiography equipment]], or even [[nurse]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1276627 ''Health care quality improvement in Mexico: challenges, opportunities, and progress.''] Enrique Ruelas.

July 2002. {{PMC|1276627}}  Retrieved 10 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining 1000 or so public hospitals account for the majority of hospital beds, and most private hospitals have fewer than 20 beds.

The [[child mortality]] rate up to five years was 17 per 1,000 live births in 2005, and Mexico has shown a faster acceleration to lower mortality rates than the US, Cuba, and Canada in the last 10 years. Also, 97% of the population had direct access to [[potable water]] and 80% to sanitation. Also in 2005, the incidence of human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome ([[HIV]]/[[AIDS]]) in persons from 15 to 49 was 0.3%.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt; At 11,000 deaths/year as opposed to 22,000/year in the US, that represents a 44% higher per capita death rate than the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2157rank.html?countryName=Mexico&amp;countryCode=MX&amp;regionCode=na#MX ''Country Comparison :: HIV/AIDS – deaths – Mexico.''] U.S. Central Intelligence Agency.

==Social determinants==
{{Main|Social determinants of health in Mexico}}

Social determinants of health in Mexico are factors that influence the status of health among certain populations in Mexico. They are circumstances in which people grow, live, work, and age and the systems put in place to deal with illnesses. In Mexico, health inequality in the population is influenced by such social factors. In the past decade, Mexico has witnessed immense progress within its health care system that has allowed for greater access to health care and a decrease in mortality rate, but there are still various health inequalities caused by social factors.

'''Hyperactivation''' is a type of [[Spermatozoon|sperm]] [[motility]].  Hyperactivated sperm motility is characterised by a high amplitude, asymmetrical beating pattern of the sperm tail ([[flagellum]]).  This type of motility may aid in sperm penetration of the [[zona pellucida]], which encloses the [[ovum]].

Hyperactivation could then be followed by the [[acrosome reaction]] where the cap-like structure on the head of the cell releases the enzymes it contains.  This facilitates the penetration of the ovum and fertilisation.

Some definitions consider '''sperm activation''' to consist of these two processes of '''hyperactivation''' and the '''acrosome reaction'''

Hyperactivation is a term also used to express an X chromosome gene dosage compensation mechanism and is seen in Drosophila. Here, a complex of proteins bind to the X-linked genes to effectively double their genetic activity. This allows males (XY) to have equal genetic activity as females (XX), whose X's are not hyperactivated.

==Mechanisms==
Mammalian sperm cells become more active when they approach an egg cell in a process called '''sperm activation'''. Sperm activation has been shown to be caused by [[calcium]] [[ionophores]] ''in vitro'', [[progesterone]] released by nearby [[cumulus cells]] and binding to [[ZP3]] of the zona pellucida.

The initial change is called "hyperactivation", which causes a change in spermatozoa motility. They swim faster and their tail movements become more forceful and erratic.

A recent discovery links hyperactivation to a sudden influx of calcium ion into the tails.  The whip-like tail (flagellum) of the sperm is studded with [[ion channel]]s formed by proteins called [[CatSper]].  These channels are selective, allowing only calcium ion to pass.  The opening of CatSper channels is responsible for the influx of calcium.  The sudden rise in calcium levels causes the flagellum to form deeper bends, propelling the sperm more forcefully through the viscous environment.  Sperm hyperactivity is necessary for breaking through two physical barriers that protect the egg from fertilization.

Hyperactivation has also shown to serve as a feature of the human sperm [[Chemotaxis]]. When the sperm is exposed to chemo-attractant, especially progesterone; the sperm will exhibit sudden flagellar arrest, followed by sharp turn and hyperactivation. This response suggests that hyperactivation serves as method to quickly guide sperm through chemo-attractant gradient. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Behavioral Mechanism during Human Sperm Chemotaxis: Involvement of Hyperactivation|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0028359|journal = PLoS ONE|date = 2011-12-07|pmc = 3233563|pmid = 22163296|pages = e28359|volume = 6|issue = 12|doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0028359|first = Leah|last = Armon|first2 = Michael|last2 = Eisenbach}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Importance to Fertilization==
Before reaching the egg, the sperm are often trapped in [[epithelium|epithelial cells]] in a [[Fallopian tube]], meaning they are rendered inert unless they undergo hyperactivation. The change in motion and force of the tail movements enable the sperm to escape from the epithelium.  Thus, only those sperm which have undergone hyperactivation have the ability to fertilize the egg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Suarez|first=SS|title=Control of hyperactivation in sperm|journal=Hum Reprod Update|date=Nov–Dec 2008|volume=14|issue=6|pages=647–57|doi=10.1093/humupd/dmn029}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1166">An '''ileosigmoid knot''' is a form of [[volvulus]] in which [[ileum]] wraps around the base of the [[Sigmoid colon|sigmoid]] and passes beneath itself forming a knot.

The exact cause of this condition is not known. Patients usually present with clinical features of colonic obstruction. Vomiting, abdominal distension, abdominal pain, blood stained stools are frequent symptoms. It is difficult to diagnose this condition before surgery. Raveenthiran described a triad which may be useful in preoperative diagnosis. The triad includes 1). Clinical features suggestive of small bowel obstruction, 2). Radiological features suggestive of large bowel obstruction, 3). Inability to negotiate sigmoidoscope or a flatus tube. This is a surgical emergency that requires urgent resection of gangrenous bowel and untwisting of the volvulus.

'''''Junkie: Confessions of an Unredeemed Drug Addict''''' (originally titled '''''Junk''''', later released as '''''Junky''''') is a novel by American [[beat generation]] writer [[William S. Burroughs]], published initially under the pseudonym William Lee in 1953. His first published work, it is [[Autobiographical novel|semi-autobiographical]] and focuses on Burroughs' life as a [[drug user]] and dealer. It has come to be considered a seminal text on the lifestyle of [[Opioid_use_disorder#United_States|heroin addicts]] in the early 1950s.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==Inspiration==
The novel was considered unpublishable more than it was controversial. Burroughs began it largely at the request and insistence of [[Allen Ginsberg]], who was impressed by Burroughs’s letter-writing skill. Burroughs took up the task with little enthusiasm. However, partly because he saw that becoming a publishable writer was possible (his friend [[Jack Kerouac]] had published his first novel ''[[The Town and the City]]'' in 1950), he began to compile his experiences as an addict, ‘lush roller’ and small-time [[Greenwich Village]] heroin pusher.

Although it was long considered Burroughs' first novel, he had in fact several years earlier completed a manuscript called ''[[And the Hippos Were Boiled in Their Tanks]]'' with Kerouac, but this work would remain unpublished in its entirety until 2008.

==Ginsberg as editor and literary agent==
Burroughs's work would not have been published but for Allen Ginsberg’s determination. Besides encouraging Burroughs to write, he worked as editor and agent as the manuscript was written in Mexico City. ''Queer'', the companion piece to ''Junkie'', was written at the same time and parts of it were designed to be included in ''Junkie'', since the first manuscript was dismissed as poorly written and lacking in interest and insight. After many rejection letters, Burroughs stopped writing.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Ginsberg found Burroughs a publisher through Carl Solomon, whom he had met at the psychiatric hospital to which Ginsberg was sent in 1949 by a judge following the latter's trial for receiving stolen goods. Solomon was the nephew of [[A. A. Wyn]], who owned [[Ace Books]]. Having secured the publisher's interest, Ginsberg forced Burroughs to revisit the text. Ginsberg soothed Burroughs's indignation at the necessary edits, and was able to finally place the novel with the New York publishing house.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

==Publishing history and editions==
[[File:Junky.jpg|left|thumb|150px|50th anniversary edition, with Burroughs' intended title spelling]]
Ace Books primarily catered to New York City [[Rapid transit|subway]] riders, and competed in the same market as [[comic book]], [[true crime]], and [[detective fiction]] publishers. Ace published no hardcover books, only cheap paperbacks, which sold for very little; Burroughs earned less than a cent royalty on each purchase.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Most libraries at the time did not buy Ace books, considering them trivial and without [[literary merit]], and Ace paperbacks were never reviewed by [[literary critics]]. At the time of its publication, the novel was in a two-book ("[[dos-à-dos binding|dos-à-dos]]") omnibus edition (known as an "Ace Double") alongside a previously published 1941 novel called ''Narcotic Agent'' by Maurice Helbrant. Burroughs chose to use the pseudonym "William Lee", Lee being his mother's maiden name, for the writing credit. The subtitle of the work was ''Confessions of an Unredeemed Drug Addict''. This edition is a highly desired collectible and even below-average-condition copies have been known to cost hundreds of dollars. The United States [[Library of Congress]] purchased a copy in 1992 for its Rare Book/Special Collections Reading Room.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Numerous reprints of the book appeared in the 1960s and 1970s once Burroughs achieved notability with ''[[Naked Lunch]]'', with the work now credited under his real name. Generally, American editions used the original ''Junkie'' spelling for the title, while UK editions usually changed this to ''Junky''.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

In 1977 a complete edition of the original text was published by [[Penguin Books]] with an introduction by Allen Ginsberg; sections of the manuscript referring to Burroughs's [[homosexuality]], which had been edited out of earlier editions, were included for the first time. In 2003, to mark the work's 50th anniversary, Penguin reissued the book as ''Junky: The Definitive Text of "Junk."'' It included a new introduction by [[Oliver Harris]], the British literary [[scholar]], who integrated new material never before published; Harris had found edits of deleted material in the literary archives of Allen Ginsberg.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

==The text==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2010}}
The text is memorable for its content and style. The distant, dry, laconic tone of the narrator is balanced by the openness and honesty of the story. Burroughs shows courage in offering details about his narrator’s behavior. He speaks from the vantage point of an [[Witness|eyewitness]], reporting back to ‘straights’ the feelings, thoughts, actions and characters he meets in the criminal fringe of New York, at the [[Federal_Medical_Center,_Lexington#History|Lexington Federal Narcotics Hospital/Prison]] in [[Kentucky]], and in [[New Orleans]] and Mexico City.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

The story takes on a more personal tone when the narrator leaves New York. In subsequent sections the substantive facts are replaced by a more intimate, desperate search for meaning and escape from criminal sanction and permanent addiction. Throughout, there are flashes of Burroughs's fierce originality, acutely graphic description, and agonizingly candid confessions: traits that would mark his literature for the next forty years.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Peruvian novelist [[Mario Vargas Llosa]] wrote that while he did not care for Burroughs's subsequent experimental fiction, he admired the more straightforward ''Junky'' both on its own merits and further as "an accurate description of what I believe to be the literary vocation"; i.e., the all-consuming nature of writing as similar to addiction.&lt;ref&gt;Vargas Llosa, Mario (1997, 2002). ''Letters to a Young Novelist''. Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, transl. Natasha Wimmer&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recorded performances==
At least three recordings have been issued featuring readings from this book. Some time in the late 1960s or early 1970s, Burroughs recorded an extensive passage from the book which was issued on a record album. Later, in the 1990s, two [[audiobook]] editions were released, one read by actor [[David Carradine]], and another read by Burroughs himself.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

[[File:Eye doctor examining Nigerian patient with keratometer.jpg|thumb|An eye doctor examining a patient with a keratometer]]
A '''keratometer''', also known as an '''ophthalmometer''', is a diagnostic instrument for measuring the curvature of the anterior surface of the [[cornea]], particularly for assessing the extent and axis of [[Astigmatism (eye)|astigmatism]]. It was invented by the [[Germans|German]] [[physiologist]] [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] in 1851, although an earlier model was developed in 1796 by [[Jesse Ramsden]] and [[Everard Home]].

A keratometer uses the relationship between object size (O), image size (I), the distance between the reflective surface and the object (d), and the radius of the reflective surface (R). If three of these variables are known (or fixed), the fourth can be calculated using the formula

:&lt;math&gt;R = 2d \frac{I}{O}&lt;/math&gt;

There are two distinct variants of determining R; Javal-Schiotz type keratometers have a fixed image size and are typically 'two position', whereas Bausch and Lomb type keratometers have a fixed object size and are usually 'one position'.

== Javal-Schiotz Principles ==
The Javal-Schiotz keratometer is a two position instrument which uses a fixed image and doubling size and adjustable object size to determine the radius of curvature of the reflective surface. It uses two self illuminated mires (the object), one a red square, the other a green staircase design, which are held on a circumferential track in order to maintain a fixed distance from the eye. 
In order to get repeatable, accurate measurements, it is important that the instrument stays focused. It uses the Scheiner principle, common in autofocus devices, in which the converging reflected rays coming towards the eyepiece are viewed through (at least) two separate symmetrical apertures.

== Bausch and Lomb principles==
The Bausch and Lomb Keratometer is a one position keratometer that gives readings in dioptric form. It differs from the Javal-Schiotz in that object size is fixed, image size is the manipulable variable. The reflected rays are passed through a Scheiner disc with 4 apertures –  As there are two prisms, each aligned perpendicular to the other, the major and minor axis powers can be measured independently without adjusting the orientation of the instrument.

In converting the measurements obtained from the corneal surface into a dioptric value, the B&amp;L keratometer uses  the general lens formula (n’-n)/R and assumes an n’ of 1.3375 (compared to the actual corneal refractive index of n’=1.376). This is a fictional value, which includes an allowance for the small, yet significant, negative power of the posterior corneal surface. This allows for a readout in both refractive power ([[dioptre]]s) and radius of curvature (millimeters).

In some parts of [[Uganda]], disabled children are put to death. In traditional rituals, infant body parts are claimed to bring benefits. Those who continue these practices describe it as "mercy killing", meaning that the children are spared from enduring painful disabilities.&lt;ref name=DR-1&gt;{{cite news|title=The untold story of ‘mercy killing’ of disabled children in Uganda|url=http://www.monitor.co.ug/SpecialReports/Untold-story-mercy-killing-disabled-children/688342-4320562-7p6gsdz/index.html|accessdate=9 May 2018|work=Daily Record|date=26 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rituals==

===Process===
Most of the time, a witch doctor will resort to these rituals to save the disabled children from their painful disability after the failure of multiple attempts using other methods that include herbal remedies or animal sacrifices which are less powerful &lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Where Child Sacrifice is a business|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-15255357#story_continues_1|website=www.bbc.com|accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. During the rituals of child sacrifice, the witch doctor is in presence of his accomplices and starts by verifying any evidence of demonization in the child &lt;ref name="jubilee campaign"&gt;{{cite web|title=Child Sacrifice|url=http://www.jubileecampaign.co.uk/stories/child-sacrifice-report|website=www.jubileecampaign.co.uk|accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Then, he removes different parts of the child’s body by force and uses the blood to make a potion mixed with herbs &lt;ref name="jubilee campaign"/&gt;. These body parts are mostly heads, genitals, eyes, tongues, limbs, teeth, and organs &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Child Sacrifice in Uganda in a global context of cultural violence|url=https://kidsrights.org/sites/default/files/inline-files/No%20Small%20Sacrifice%20-%20Child%20Sacrifice%20in%20Uganda%2C%20in%20a%20global%20context%20of%20cultural%20violence_0.pdf|website=www.kidsrights.org|accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. According to the perpetrators, these rituals are necessary to bring about success, healing or wealth &lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;.

===Practitioners===
The ‘killing’ of disabled children in Uganda is perpetrated by [[witchdoctor]]s who praise the power of these rituals to their clients in search of wealth, health or fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=witch doctors in Uganda sacrificing children in bid to end drought|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/09/26/witch-doctors-in-uganda-sacrificing-children-in-bid-to-end-drought-report-says.html|website=www.foxnews.com|accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those witchdoctors are often compared to traditional healers which have resulted in the propaganda stating that witchcraft is associated with the healing practices of the indigenous culture although they are, in reality, responsible of horrible crimes unlike traditional healers who do not use human organs &lt;ref name="jubilee campaign"/&gt;. The parents of disabled children also play a major role in the rituals by allowing it and leading their children to death because they believe that the so-called ‘mercy killing’ would avoid them the pain of enduring these disabilities.&lt;ref name=DR-1/&gt;

==Investigations==
The parliament of Uganda highly condemns "mercy" killing of newborn disabled children in Uganda as they regard it as an inhumane act.&lt;ref&gt;url=https://africadiplomatic.com/2018/03/19/meps-condemn-killings-of-disabled-children-in-uganda/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Findings===
The European Parliament was involved in finding resolutions for the killings of disabled people in Uganda. They argued that the killings should not take place because: human rights should be respected at all times,  everyone has a right to life despite their disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Motion for Resolution|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+MOTION+B8-2018-0166+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN&amp;language=en|accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; People with are often excluded from community activities. Disabled children are usually hidden from the public, cast out, and even killed. Mothers of these children experience isolation from their extended families, while most of the fathers neglect their families. The Ugandan National Household Survey reports only record disabled people of age 5 and above; leaving out most children. 7.1% of Ugandans, which is equivalent to 2.1 million people are reported to be disabled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.malteser-international.org/en/our-work/africa/uganda/helping-mothers-and-disabled-children.html|title=Helping mothers and disabled children - Uganda - AfricaOur Work - Home -|website=www.malteser-international.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Actions and penalties===
In [[Uganda]], the [[laws]] the [[law]] prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, sensory, [[intellectual]],or mental disabilities in employment, education, air travel and other transportation,access to health care, and the provision of other state services.&lt;ref name="human rights report"&gt;url=https://photos.state.gov/libraries/uganda/231771/PDFs/2012_Human_Rights_Report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
However, the government's efforts in enforcing these laws have not been effective.&lt;ref name="human rights report"/&gt;

The form of treatment given to people with disability has not been encouraging of late. A July report released by the [[National Council on Disability]] (NCD) indicated 55 percent of persons with disabilities lacked functional literacy skills,and only 33 percent studied to primary grade seven.&lt;ref name="human rights report"/&gt; The report found some children with mental disabilities were sometimes denied food and were tied to trees and beds with ropes in order to control their movements. The report further stated the needs of children with autism and learning difficulties were ignored due to an insufficient number of special needs schools.&lt;ref name="human rights report"/&gt;

Government agencies responsible for protecting the rights of persons with disabilities included the Ministry of State for Disabled Persons,the NCD, and the Ministry of Gender, Labor, and Social Development, but these entities lacked sufficient funding to undertake any significant initiatives.&lt;ref name="human rights report"/&gt;

In the governments effort to ensure that there is adequate representation of people with disability in roles of position, there are 5 seats in parliament which have been reserved for persons with disability.&lt;ref&gt; Read Final Report On Elections for Member of Parliament Representing People with Disabilities 2016 http://www.ncd.go.ug/publication?title=&amp;tid=All &lt;/ref&gt;
These initiatives by the government will ensure that the minority group which have been oppressed systematically for decades will now have a form of empowerment.&lt;ref&gt;url=https://www.sagepub.com/sites/default/files/upm-binaries/23833_Pages_494_497.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Magen David Adom''' (&lt;big&gt;&lt;span style="color: red"&gt;✡&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/big&gt;; {{lang-he|מגן דוד אדום}}, abbr. '''MDA''', pronounced ''MAH-dah'' per its Hebrew acronym, ''מד"א'') is [[Israel]]'s  national [[emergency medicine|emergency medical]], [[Emergency management|disaster]], [[ambulance]] and [[blood bank]] service. The name means "Red [[Star of David]]". Since June 2006, Magen David Adom has been officially recognized by the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC) as the national aid society of the State of Israel under the [[Geneva Conventions]], and a member of the [[International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies]]. MDA has a dedicated medical emergency phone number in Israel, '''101'''.&lt;ref name=phone&gt;{{cite web |title=מספרי חירום - Emergency Phone Numbers in Israel |author= |url=http://www.b144.co.il/EmergencyNo.aspx |language=Hebrew |accessdate=2012-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Magen David Adom organization was formed by nurse Karen Tenenbaum in 1930 as a [[Volunteering|volunteer]] association with a single branch in [[Tel Aviv]]. After opening branches in [[Jerusalem]] and [[Haifa]], it was extended nationwide five years later, providing medical support to the public including not only Jews, but Arabs (Muslim, Druze, and Christian). On 12 July 1950, the [[Knesset]] passed a law making MDA's status as Israel's national emergency service official;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/127588 Saving Lives at the Dead Sea: Magen David Adom Olympics on TV]&lt;/ref&gt; The objectives of Magen David include maintaining first aid services; maintaining a storage service of blood, plasma and their by-products; instruction in first aid and pre-hospital emergency medicine; operating a volunteer program in which volunteers are trained in first aid, basic and advanced life support including mobile intensive care units; transportation of patients, women in labor, and evacuation of those wounded and killed in road accidents; transportation of doctors, nurses and medical auxiliary forces. In the late 1960s the organization refocused its rapid trauma treatment and transport protocols due to the efforts of Dr. [[Nancy Caroline]]. Dr. Caroline's work at Magen David Adom was based upon studies she conducted with Dr. [[Peter Safar]] and the Freedom House Paramedics of [[Pittsburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.emsworld.com/article/12127175/paramedics-of-freedom-house-empowerment-through-paramedicine|title=Paramedics of Freedom House: Empowerment Through Paramedicine|last=Karns|first=Jameson|date=15 October 2015|website=|publisher=EMS World|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Magen David Adom is mainly staffed by volunteers, and has over 10,000 people volunteering over one million man-hours per year. The minimum age to join Magen David Adom's basic first aid course and become a volunteer is 15.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mdais.com/235/ Volunteers] at MDA Israel. Retrieved 2009-09-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2001, international volunteers aged 18 and over have the option to come to Israel for a two-month [https://www.mdavolunteers.org/ MDA Overseas Program in Memory of Yochai Porat] . The program is named after its founder and first coordinator, who was killed by a sniper on 3 March 2002 while serving reserve duty as a combat medic in the [[Israel Defense Forces]]. All volunteers pass a 60-hour course that covers a wide range of topics ranging from common medical conditions and [[Physical trauma|trauma]] situations to [[mass casualty events]]. Those who pass the course are then dispatched throughout the country and work with local volunteers in ambulances to provide initial medical care on the regular and Mobile Intensive Care Ambulances.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.israelexperience.org.il/mda Yochai Porat International Volunteers Program] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120803073012/http://www.israelexperience.org.il/mda |date=2012-08-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090122062937/http://mdaoverseas.com/about.php About the Program:] The Yochai Porat Magen David Adom Overseas Programme. Retrieved 2009-09-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the programme was originally financially supported by the [[Jewish Agency for Israel]], it has recently been taken over by the Israel Experience organization, which also offers programs for Jewish youths on [[Birthright Israel]] trips.

Visitors to Israel are also welcome to donate blood through the "Sharing for Life" program. Since its inception in 2001, increasing numbers of people have donated blood, usually through groups such as Christian solidarity missions, or family Bar-Bat Mitzvas, especially during seasonal traditional pilgrimage times, such as Passover and Easter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.christianindex.org/5283.article |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922025858/http://www.christianindex.org/5283.article |archivedate=2013-09-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current status==
Although MDA currently staffs approximately 2,000 [[emergency medical technician]]s, [[paramedic]]s and [[emergency physician]]s, it still relies heavily on over 15,000 volunteers who serve in both operational and administrative capacities. MDA headquarters and its [[blood bank]] are located at the [[Tel HaShomer]] complex in the center of the country. The organization operates 119 stations over the country, with a fleet of over 1000 ambulances nationwide. Among them are [[ambulance|mobile intensive care unit]]s (MICU), special ambulances equipped for mass casualty events, and [[Ambulance#Military ambulances|armored ambulances]]. Most of the fleet is made up of regular size vans providing [[Basic Life Support]]. These are called ''Lavan'' (which in [[Hebrew]] means "White") due to their external aspect and to differentiate them from the MICU, which have orange stripes on the sides. They are manned by [[Emergency medical technician|EMT]]s who generally have ranks equivalent to Basic and Intermediate EMTs in the US. In Israel, they are called ''ma'ar'' ([[Certified first responder|first responder]]s), ''ma'ar bachir'' (Certified first responder over 18, with some additional training), ''chovesh'' (EMT-B), and ''chovesh bachir'' (EMT-I). Ambulance drivers are EMTs or higher with a drivers' license for emergency vehicles. MICUs similar to the [[Emergency Medical Services in the United States#Ambulances|US Type II]] units and manned by paramedics and physicians respond only to the most medically serious cases. They are called Natan (if a physician is on board) or Atan (if it is only staffed by paramedics and EMTs). Major stations include special units (called "Taaran") for responding to [[mass casualty events]] such as natural disasters or [[terrorist attack]]s.

In some cases [[Air ambulance]] service is provided by [[Israeli Air Force]] 669 unit with [[MEDEVAC]] helicopters. However, in 2008, MDA started to provide paramedics for three EMS [[MBB Bo 105]]s imported from Germany by Lahak Aviation Ltd. These three helicopters  (out of four brought by Lahak) are operated by Lahak Aviation's operating company, Shapirit Air Services Ltd., as Ambulance helicopters. Previous attempts by MDA to integrate independent helicopter service in the 1970s were unsuccessful because of high cost.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.shephard.co.uk/Rotorhub/default.aspx?Action=745115149&amp;ID=740a002d-49f9-4da1-99e7-660482976627{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unique among civilian emergency medical services due to its role as national aid society according to the Geneva Conventions, MDA can become an auxiliary arm of the [[Israel Defense Forces]] during times of war.

Decommissioned MDA ambulances have been donated to a number of [[kibbutzim]], [[moshavim]], factories, and [[communities]] on both sides of the [[Green Line (Israel)|Green Line]]. Crews manning these lifesaving vehicles are trained and certified by Magen David Adom.&lt;ref name=mda&gt;{{cite news |title=MDA Ambulances in Judea and Samaria |author=AFMDA |url=http://www.jpost.com/PromoContent/Article.aspx?id=248983 |newspaper=Jerusalem Post - Promotional Content |date=2011-12-11 |accessdate=2012-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MDA has a dedicated medical emergency phone number in Israel, '''101'''.&lt;ref name="phone"/&gt;

==Membership of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and Movements==
{{See also|Emblems of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement}}
From its creation until 2006, Magen David Adom was denied membership in the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement]] since it had refused to replace its red Star of David emblem with a pre-approved symbol.

The stated reason for the denial of membership was concerns about symbol proliferation; at the same 1929 conference that granted use of the Red Crescent and [[Red Lion and Sun Society|Red Lion and Sun]], a limitation was placed on acceptance of any further emblems. The "Red Star of David" symbol was not submitted to the ICRC until 1931.

Similar concerns of [[India]], [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]], and the former [[Soviet Union]] regarding the use of non-[[Hindu]] and seemingly [[religious symbols]] were also dismissed by the ICRC, but their national bodies chose to adopt the Red Cross as their official emblems in order to gain entry. The Red Cross — the inverse of the Swiss flag, the country of origin of the founder of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement — is not intended as a religious symbol, but is often perceived as such. {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Critics of the ICRC assert discrimination since [[Turkey]] and [[Egypt]] were granted membership in 1929 while using the [[Islam]]ic Red Crescent as its emblem, citing the same concerns about the cross.

In her March 2000 letter to the ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'', Dr. [[Bernadine Healy]], then president of the [[American Red Cross]], wrote: "The international committee's feared proliferation of symbols is a pitiful [[fig leaf]], used for decades as the reason for excluding the Magen David Adom — the Shield (or Star) of David." In protest, the American Red Cross withheld millions in administrative funding to the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies]] (IFRC) since May 2000.

Since the mid-1990s, there has also been extensive and growing co-operation between MDA and the ICRC including, among other things, a [[United States dollar|USD$]]2.2 million expenditure on strengthening ties between the two organisations, the signing in 2000 of a two-year co-operation statement, the permanent placement of an ICRC co-operation officer in MDA headquarters, and extensive support of the MDA's blood bank activities. In addition, there are bilateral cooperation agreements between MDA and a number of national Red Cross societies.

On 7 December 2005, a diplomatic conference of states party to the [[Geneva Conventions]] adopted a [[Protocol III|third additional protocol]], thereby introducing a new protective emblem, dubbed the "[[Emblems of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement#Red Crystal|Red Crystal]]." This third protocol emblem is hailed as a truly universal emblem free of religious, ethnic, or political connotation. The new symbol is a red square frame tilted at a 45-degree angle. According to the rules of the third additional protocol, MDA can continue to use the Red Star of David as its sole emblem for indicative purposes within Israel. For indicative use in abroad missions, MDA can, depending on the specific situation in the host country, either incorporate the Red Star of David inside the Red Crystal or use the Red Crystal alone.

On 22 June 2006, MDA was recognised by the ICRC and admitted as a full member of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent societies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/europe/06/22/thursday/index.html|publisher=CNN| title= With addition of crystal emblem, Israel now part of the Red Cross movement|date=2006-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; following adoption of the Red Crystal symbol in the statutes of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement on the same level as the Red Cross and Red Crescent symbols.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/html/geneva-news-220606?opendocument ICRC website — Press Release 06/65], 22-06-2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The MDA's admission to the International Federation was conditioned on agreements signed in 2005 with the [[Palestine Red Crescent Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icrc.org/eng/assets/files/other/irrc_861_emblem.pdf |title=Adoption of an Additional Distinctive Emblem |author= |date=March 2006 |page=189 |work=Reports and Documents, Vol. 88, Number 186 |publisher=International Committee of the Red Cross |accessdate=2012-03-25}} The agreements between the two organizations are the ''Memorandum of Understanding'' and the ''Agreement on Operational Arrangements'' dated 28 November 2005. Switzerland accepted to monitor their implementation.&lt;/ref&gt; Under these agreements, the red Magen David symbol could not be used in countries other than Israel; moreover the MDA agreed not to operate in the [[West Bank]] or in [[East Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Israel forfeited national pride when it joined the Red Cross |author=Karni Eldad |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/opinion/israel-forfeited-national-pride-when-it-joined-the-red-cross-1.381456 |newspaper=Haaretz |date=2011-08-30 |accessdate=2012-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Service in the West Bank===
Under the 2005 agreements, the MDA agreed to operate within the international legal framework applicable to the Palestinian territory occupied by Israel in 1967, and recognized that the Palestine Red Cross Society was the authorized national society in the Palestinian territory. The MDA had therefore to discontinue its operations in the [[West Bank]]. In December 2011, the International Conference of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement "noted with regret" that the 2005 agreement had not been fully implemented and decided to continue the monitoring process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/resolution/31-international-conference-resolution-8-2011.htm |title=Implementation of the Memorandum of Understanding and Agreement on Operational Arrangements dated 28th November 2005 between Palestine Red Crescent Society and the Magen David Adom in Israel |date=2011-12-01 |publisher=ICRC |accessdate=2012-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few months earlier, [[Dani Dayan]] from the [[Yesha Council]], a settler organization, had accused the MDA of removing the red Magen David from ambulances operating in the West Bank. Dayan asserted that the MDA was doing so under pressure from the International Committee of the Red Cross. An MDA spokesman replied that the MDA continued to use the classic Red Star logo on its ambulances housed in 12 places across the West Bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=MDA: Red Star of David logo to remain on W. Bank ambulances |author=Tovah Lazaroff |url=http://www.jpost.com/NationalNews/Article.aspx?id=235164 |newspaper=Jerusalem Post |date=2011-08-24 |accessdate=2012-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In October 2011 Yonatan Yagodovsky, director of MDA's fundraising department, declared that "the MDA will continue to use its emblem and logo, and no one ever asked us to take it off."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=MDA symbol on ambulances in Yesha still unresolved |author= |url=http://www.jewishtribune.ca/news/2011/10/04/mda-symbol-on-ambulances-in-yesha-still-unresolved |newspaper=Jewish Tribune |location=Canada |date=2011-10-04 |accessdate=23 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922015009/http://www.jewishtribune.ca/news/2011/10/04/mda-symbol-on-ambulances-in-yesha-still-unresolved |archivedate=22 September 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2012, the ICRC confirmed that MDA had in fact agreed to stop all services within the West Bank. Rescue efforts would "officially" be administered by [[Regional council (Israel)|regional councils]] instead, and would not use the red Magen David symbol. As a result, many contributors reportedly stopped donating to the MDA; some young settlers, a considerable percentage of the volunteer force, stopped volunteering for the MDA in protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/151388 |title=Red Cross Admits Red Magen David Agreed to Stop Yesha Service |author=Tzvi Ben Gedalyahu |date=4 January 2012|work= |newspaper=Israel National News |accessdate=4 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MDA told international authorities in November 2011 that it had already changed the markings on 62 of 68 ambulances posted in settlements. The emblem on five mobile intensive care units and nine ambulances that MDA still operating in the West Bank will be replaced by the end of 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Magen David Adom pledges to leave West Bank, Haaretz learns |author=Chaim Levinson |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/magen-david-adom-pledges-to-leave-west-bank-haaretz-learns-1.399066 |newspaper=Haaretz |date=2011-12-02 |accessdate=2012-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tracing service==
Magen David Adom's tracing service was established to assist in locating relatives lost in the [[Holocaust]]. In 2000–2007, the service handled 5,000 applications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mdais.com/rc_movement/Tracing_services/ Tracing services]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
The Magen David Adom blood drive came under criticism after reports that blood from [[Ethiopia]]n donors had been discarded due to concerns about HIV/AIDS. Magen David Adom spokesman Yeruham Mendola responded to the claims by saying: "The guidelines set by the Ministry of Health determines that anyone who was born, or who lived for over a year since 1977 in [[Central Africa]], [[Southeast Asia]] or the [[Caribbean Islands]], or has spent over six months in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], or was in [[France]], [[Ireland]] or [[Portugal]] for over 10 years — can choose not to donate blood, or donate blood, which is then marked, and know that it will not be used for transfusions." In 2006, a protest of some 10,000 Ethiopians outside the Prime Minister's office led to violent clashes with the police. [[Shimon Peres]], serving as Vice Prime Minister in the cabinet of [[Ehud Olmert]], apologized to the Ethiopian Jewish community for this policy.

A '''mamelon''' (from [[French language|French]] ''mamelon'', "nipple"), is one of three rounded protuberances which are present on the cutting edge of an [[incisor]] tooth when it first erupts through the gum. Mamelons are quickly worn away by use.&lt;ref Name="Thomas"&gt;{{cite book

Mamelons are easiest to observe on the [[Maxillary central incisor]]s, and appear as three small prominences on the incisal edge of the tooth. Mamelons are ordinarily of no clinical importance. Usually they are worn off early in the life of the tooth. However, when an anterior open bite is present&amp;nbsp;— that is, the anterior teeth are not in contact when the bite is fully closed&amp;nbsp;— mamelons may remain into adulthood.  {{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

==Purpose==
The purpose of the Millennium Cohort Family Study is to gain a more complete understanding of the military experience and its impact on the health and well-being of Service members and their families. The Family Study also provides a unique opportunity to explore the impact of relationship quality on the physical and psychological health of Service members, their spouses and children. A comprehensive understanding of the challenges faced by military families provides a vehicle to create truly effective interventions and support mechanisms.

A cohort study follows a distinct group of people over an extended period of time. In epidemiological research, only a cohort study has the strength to describe long-term health outcomes that are of concern to the military. Important health facts, which may seem obvious now, were not always known to be true - they were learned through cohort studies. For example, we know that smoking causes lung cancer and that untreated high blood pressure causes heart disease, but less than 50 years ago, these relationships were not clear.

==Background==
More than 5 million US military personnel have been deployed in support of the operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, with nearly 800,000 deploying multiple times and over 3 million children and spouses directly affected by the deployment of a Service member. Family relationships play an important role in the functioning and well-being of US military Service members, yet few studies have examined the impact of deployment and occupational exposures on family members.

==Study design==
The Family Study is a longitudinal study designed to follow  spouses of Service members from all branches of the military, including the National Guard and Reserve, for 21 years. Spouses of Service members participating in the Millennium Cohort Study were invited to complete a baseline questionnaire between 2011 and 2013 and will be re-surveyed  every three years. Because families and family relationships change over time, spouses are asked to complete follow-up surveys every three years, even if their spouse is no longer in the service or their marital status changes. The questionnaire asks participants about their mental and physical health, the quality of their marital and family relationships, their deployment and reunion experiences, their perception of how their spouse is coping, and the effects of military life and deployment on their children. Participation in the Family Study is completely voluntary.

==Biography==
Walker enrolled at the University of California, Los Angeles where he saw a therapist who tried to persuade him to not be gay.&lt;ref name=GaySoul&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Mark|title=Gay Soul: Finding the Heart of Gay Spirit and Nature with Sixteen Writers, Healers, Teachers, and Visionaries|year=1995|publisher=HarperOne|isbn=0-06-251041-X|pages=248–250|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Gay_Soul.html?id=mV76lBH02ngC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Walker rejected the therapist he did get "an invaluable introduction to inner work, to the techniques of dream analysis, and to other tools of psychological investigation."&lt;ref name=GaySoul/&gt; Walker transferred to the Berkeley campus and majored in psychology.&lt;ref name=GaySoul/&gt;  He became more outspoken on gay issues and became one of the first to join the [[Berkeley Free Clinic]]'s Gay Men Collective.&lt;ref name=GaySoul/&gt;  After graduation he worked on a master's-level in psychology at San Francisco's Lone Mountain College focussing on same-sex love from Jung's "archetypal perspective" using the basis that archetypes are "primal indwelling sources after which behavior is patterned and images are perceived."&lt;ref name=GaySoul/&gt;  In 1974 Walker had a realization that same-sex love was archetypal, not "a mere accident or adaption," answering the question if one was born gay or does gayness come from social experience.&lt;ref name=GaySoul/&gt;  His revelation led to his master's thesis "discussing the then unheard-of topic of gay depth psychology."&lt;ref name=GaySoul/&gt;  
   
Walker was the first openly gay writer to be published in the formal Jungian literature, for his paper, "The Double: An Archetypal Configuration," appeared in Spring in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;"The Double: An Archetypal Configuration."

He is also the author of  ''Men Loving Men: A Gay Sex Guide &amp; Consciousness Book'' (Gay Sunshine Press, 1977/1994) - which was involved in an obscenity-importing case in England&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Salisbury|first=Stephen|title=Gay Bookstore Battles British Law|url=http://articles.philly.com/1986-11-07/news/26091939_1_customs-gay-criminal-charges|accessdate=23 January 2013|newspaper=Philadelphia Inquirer|date=November 7, 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;  -  and ''Visionary Love: A Spirit Book of Gay Mythology and Transmutational Faerie'' (Treeroots Press, 1980).&lt;ref name=GaySoul/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5082">The '''NHS Plan 2000''' was a ten year plan of the [[Blair ministry]] for the [[NHS in England|National Health Service (England)]]. It combined a commitment to substantial investment with some quite radical changes. The most controversial aspect of the plan was the introduction of more private sector providers and a more competitive internal market. The plan, coming shortly after devolution, marked the beginning of divergence between the NHS in England and [[NHS Wales]]. [[NHS Scotland]] was legally distinct from England from the beginning of the NHS in 1948.

NHS Wales produced [http://www.wales.nhs.uk/Publications/NHSStrategydoc.pdf Improving Health in Wales] early in 2001

Unlike some later plans for NHS reform there was a great deal of effort devoted to marshalling political support for the plan. At the beginning of the printed document were two pages with the signatures of 25 prominent leaders in the health field, including doctors, Trades Unions, patient charities and the [[Local Government Association]]

The main features the Plan promised&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Labour publishes plans to revolutionise NHS|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/july/27/newsid_2499000/2499225.stm|accessdate=25 October 2014|publisher=BBC News|date=27 July 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; were:
* more staff: 7,500 more consultants, 2,000 more GPs, 20,000 extra nurses and 6,500 extra therapists
* 7,000 extra beds in hospitals and intermediate care
* increase in the proportion of [[day case]] surgery to 75%
* over 100 new hospitals by 2010 mostly delivered through the [[Private Finance Initiative]]
* an unspecified number of fully operational [[Treatment centre]]s
* all outpatient appointments and inpatient elective admissions, including [[day case]]s, to be pre-booked by the end of 2005 and [[electronic patient record]]s in all [[Primary Care Trust]]s by 2008
* around 500 primary care one-stop centres 
* expanding the capacity of [[NHS Direct]] from 7.5 million callers per year to 30 million callers per year
* Waiting times to be reduced from 18 to six months by 2004 and to three months by 2008
* A "concordat" with the private sector to provide extra capacity

[[Tony Blair]] in his foreword promised that the  March 2000 Budget settlement meant that the NHS would grow by one half in cash terms and by one third in real terms in five years.

Other developments flowing from the Plan included [[NHS care trust]]s, [[Nurse prescribing]], [[Patient Advice and Liaison Service]]s and the abolition of [[Community Health Council]]s.

Patients were promised that letters about an individual patient’s care will be copied to the patient, that there would be better information to help patients choose a GP and that there would be proper redress when operations were cancelled on the day they are due to take place.

==Political Perspective==
According to Jennifer Dixon of the [[King's Fund]] writing in the [[British Medical Journal]] just after publication: "This is probably as good as it gets: a significant injection of money for the NHS sustained over five years coupled with a comprehensive national plan".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dixon|first1=Jennifer|title=As good as it gets—make the most of it|journal=British Medical Journal|date=5 August 2000|volume=321|page=315|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/321/7257/315|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The core principles of the plan were still being celebrated by the [[Socialist Health Association]] in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=http://www.sochealth.co.uk/2013/10/26/core-principles-nhs-plan-2000/|url=http://www.sochealth.co.uk/2013/10/26/core-principles-nhs-plan-2000/|website=Socialist Health Association|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 there was a great deal of reflection on the NHS plan when [[Simon Stevens (civil servant)|Simon Stevens]], who was one of the authors of the Plan produced the [[Five Year Forward View]] of the NHS in England. [[Fraser Nelson]] described it as a "brilliant, radical and enduring document" which "prescribed a heavy dose of market reform" - of which he approved. He claimed that [[Alan Milburn]] redefined the NHS as a means of paying for healthcare, not necessarily providing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The NHS Wales disaster vindicates Tony Blair, not David Cameron|url=http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/fraser-nelson/2014/10/the-nhs-wales-disaster-vindicates-tony-blair-not-david-cameron/|accessdate=25 October 2014|publisher=The Spectator|date=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was formerly an expert advisor with [[KPMG]]’s Global Centre of Excellence for Health and Life Sciences, a Senior Fellow at The [[King’s Fund]]. He was Policy Director of the [[NHS Confederation]] for 11 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nigel Edwards|url=http://www.nuffieldtrust.org.uk/about/our-people/nigel-edwards|website=Nuffield Trust|accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of autumn 2017 Edwards is concerned about the condition and funding of the NHS.  Edwards stated, “It is indisputable that the NHS is facing a yet another difficult winter. But whether or not it experiences a full-blown crisis will depend largely on unpredictable events, like a sudden outbreak of flu or norovirus. What is clear is that, seven years into [[United Kingdom government austerity programme|austerity]], the pressure on the system is immense, making the health service much less resilient to these kinds of events than is comfortable.”&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/nov/10/theresa-may-tells-nhs-boss-he-will-be-accountable-for-nhs-winter-performance Theresa May tells NHS boss he will be accountable for winter performance] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 19, 2006, the '''Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act''' (PAHPA), Public Law No. 109-417, was signed into law by President [[George W. Bush]]. PAHPA has broad implications for the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]]'s (HHS) preparedness and response activities. Among other things, the act amended the [[Public Health Service Act]] to establish within the department a new Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR); provided new authorities for a number of programs, including the advanced development and acquisitions of medical countermeasures; and called for the establishment of a quadrennial [[National Health Security Strategy]].

The purpose of the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act is "to improve the Nation's public health and medical preparedness and response capabilities for emergencies, whether deliberate, accidental, or [[Natural disaster|natural]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=109_cong_public_laws&amp;docid=f:publ417.109.pdf Pandemic and All Hazards Preparedness Act]&lt;/ref&gt;

The law was most recently reauthorized by Congress in 2013.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://homelandprepnews.com/countermeasures/26388-pahpa-hearing-witnesses-question-u-s-governments-preparedness-response-commitment/|title=PAHPA hearing witnesses question U.S. government's preparedness, response commitment - Homeland Preparedness News|last=Riley|first=Kim|date=2018-01-24|work=Homeland Preparedness News|access-date=2018-02-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Provisions ==
===Title I: National Preparedness and Response, Leadership, Organization, and Planning ===
*Amends the [[Public Health Service Act]] to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to lead all federal public health and medical response to public health emergencies and incidents covered by the National Response Plan.
*Establishes the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response within HHS to: (1) serve as an advisor to the Secretary on public health and public health emergencies; (2) oversee advanced research and development of qualified countermeasures; (3) maintain the [[Strategic National Stockpile]]; and (4) provide logistical support for public health aspects of federal responses to public health emergencies.

=== Title II: Public Health Security Preparedness ===
*Expands the program for state and local public health emergency preparedness to allow political subdivisions of states or a consortium of states to be eligible for funding. Requires the Secretary to: (1) develop and require the application of evidence-based benchmarks and objective standards that measure levels of preparedness; (2) develop and disseminate to each state the criteria for an effective state plan for responding to pandemic influenza; and (3) withhold funds from entities that fail to meet the benchmarks and performance measures or fail to submit a plan for responding to pandemic influenza that meets the criteria.

=== Title III: All-Hazards Medical Surge Capacity ===
*Requires the Secretary to conduct a joint review of the National Disaster Medical System, including a review of medical surge capacity. Transfers to the Secretary the functions of the National Disaster Medical System.
*Changes the National Advisory Committee on Children and Terrorism to the National Advisory Committee on At-Risk Individuals and Public Health Emergencies to focus on public health emergencies as they relate to at-risk individuals.
*Requires the Secretary to: (1) evaluate the benefits and feasibility of improving HHS's capacity to provide additional medical surge capacity to local communities in a public health emergency; and (2) conduct an analysis of whether there are federal facilities that could practicably be used as health care facilities in such an emergency.
*Requires the Secretary to: (1) establish a Medical Reserve Corps to provide for an adequate supply of volunteers in a federal, state, local, or tribal public health emergency; (2) link existing state verification systems to maintain a single national interoperable network of systems to verify the credentials and licenses of health care professionals who volunteer to provide health services during a public health emergency; and (3) encourage states to establish and implement mechanisms to waive the application of licensing requirements applicable to health professionals, seeking to provide medical services during a national, state, local, or tribal public health emergency.

== Funding ==
In January 2018, the [[United States Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions|Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee]] held two separate hearings on the reauthorization of the PAHPA law. The conclusion from many witnesses who testified before the hearings is that "decreased and episodic funding from the United States government has stakeholders questioning the true commitment federal lawmakers have for sustaining the nation's preparedness and response capabilities during a catastrophic event linked to infectious diseases, natural disasters or chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear (CBRN) agents."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Many provisions in PAHPA are set to expire in September 2018 unless Congress reauthorizes them.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

One of the two January 2018 committee hearings focused on the private sector's relationship with providing preparedness and response capabilities. Private sector witnesses expressed concerns about the decreased or lack of federal funding for preparedness and response, saying that it's gotten to the point where the U.S. government's reputation is at stake with companies and public health and medical professionals.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

"Unfortunately, over the last several years, the private sector has become more skeptical of the government's commitment to biodefense," testified Brent MacGregor of Seqirus, a global influenza vaccine developer and manufacturer.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== PAHPA reauthorization ==
Like many laws that authorize activities for federal agencies, PAHPA must be reauthorized by its expiration date in order for the law to continue taking effect. As of January 2018, most of the provisions in PAHPA are set to expire in September 2018. The Senate HELP Committee started the process of reauthorizing the law with a set of hearings beginning on January 17, 2018.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://homelandprepnews.com/countermeasures/26278-senate-health-committee-begins-reapproval-process-nations-hazard-preparedness-law/|title=Senate health committee begins reapproval process for nation's hazards preparedness law - Homeland Preparedness News|last=Riley|first=Kim|date=2018-01-18|work=Homeland Preparedness News|access-date=2018-02-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. Senator [[Richard Burr]] (R-NC) sponsored both Senate versions of PAHPA authorization and reauthorization. The original bill, S. 3678, which created PAHPA, became law in 2006. In 2013, Burr sponsored the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act (PAHPRA) of 2013, S. 242, which became law that same year.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

On May 15, 2018, Burr introduced the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness and Advancing Innovation Act of 2018 (bill number S. 2852). Original cosponsors of the bill were U.S. Senators [[Bob Casey Jr.|Bob Casey]] (D-PA), [[Lamar Alexander]] (R-TN), and [[Patty Murray]] (D-WA).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://homelandprepnews.com/stories/28499-sen-burr-introduces-bipartisan-bill-update-u-s-bioterror-pandemics-law/|title=Sen.

The [[Alliance for Biosecurity]] and [[United States Chamber of Commerce|U.S. Chamber of Commerce]] wrote a joint letter to all U.S. House members urging their passage of the House version, H.R. 6378 (the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness and Advancing Innovation Act of 2018).&lt;ref&gt;https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/d3b183_b36530fc878e44f98a765d1a2e8e11ce.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Congresswoman [[Susan Brooks]] (R-IN) introduced companion legislation in the House of Representatives (H.R. 6378). The bill increases funding to the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] to develop responses to pandemics and biological threats. Congresswoman [[Anna Eshoo]] (D-CA), who coauthored the bill with Brooks, called it "critical to our national security."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://homelandprepnews.com/stories/30607-house-approves-rep-brooks-pandemic-all-hazards-reauthorization-bill/|title=House approves Rep.

On June 15, 2018, the [[United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce|U.S. House Energy and Commerce]] Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations held a hearing focused on discussing biopreparedness oversight issues and stressing the need to reauthorize PAHPA. One of the witnesses, Rick Bright, director of the [[Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority]] (BARDA), proposed that "cutting-edge testing tools" developed by private companies should go directly to doctors' offices for "rapid, regional response to outbreaks, rather than funneling samples primarily to the CDC for testing."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://homelandprepnews.com/countermeasures/29026-national-agencies-seek-biopreparedness-funding-discuss-new-technologies-stem-emerging-threats/|title=National agencies seek biopreparedness funding, discuss new technologies to stem emerging threats|last=Adrien|first=Claudia|date=2018-06-18|work=Homeland Preparedness News|access-date=2018-06-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The chairman of the HELP Committee, Senator [[Lamar Alexander]] (R-TN), said, "I look forward to a timely, bipartisan [[Sunset provision|reauthorization]] of this crucial legislation to ensure we are prepared to respond to natural disasters like hurricanes, and protect Americans against bioterror attacks and infectious disease outbreaks, like the Zika virus or a pandemic influenza."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The purpose of reauthorizing PAHPA is to protect public health from threats coming from exposure to infectious diseases, natural disasters or chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear (CBRN) agents.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

During the committee hearing, Burr said that the U.S. is not fully prepared and that gaps have left the U.S. vulnerable to both terrorists and natural threats. He said that developing countermeasures "should be top of mind."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Rapid-onset obesity with hypothalamic dysregulation, hypoventilation, and autonomic dysregulation''' '''(ROHHAD)''' is a rare condition whose etiology is currently unknown.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; ROHHAD mainly affects the endocrine system and autonomic nervous system, but patients can exhibit a variety of symptoms. Patients present with both alveolar hypoventilation along with hypothalamic dysfunction, which distinguishes ROHHAD from [[congenital central hypoventilation syndrome]] (CCHS).&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; ROHHAD is a rare disease, with only 100 reported cases worldwide thus far.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The first sign of ROHHAD is a rapid weight gain between 1.5 and 11 years of age.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Typically, hypoventilation, or abnormally slow breathing, presents after the rapid onset obesity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Symptoms of hypothalamic dysfunction and autonomic dysfunction present in a variety of ways, but in order for a diagnosis of ROHHAD they must be present in some form.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Approximately 40% of patients will develop neuroendocrine tumors.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; There is also a possibility of behavioral disorders, but some children with ROHHAD have normal cognitive development and intelligence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Treatment plans for ROHHAD vary depending on each patient's symptoms. There is no cure, so treatment is geared toward managing the symptoms that each patient manifests.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; ROHHAD is fatal in 50-60% of cases due to cardiopulmonary arrest secondary to untreated hypoventilation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The earlier the disease is diagnosed and treatment starts, the better a child's prognosis is.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

== Signs &amp; symptoms ==

=== Rapid-onset Obesity ===
The rapid onset obesity aspect of ROHHAD is usually the first diagnostic indicator of the disease. Patients often present with hyperphagia and rapid weight gain. This rapid weight gain is defined as 20-30 pounds over a 6-12 month period, and typically occurs between the ages of 1.5 and 11.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reppucci|first=Diana|last2=Hamilton|first2=Jill|last3=Yeh|first3=E Ann|last4=Katz|first4=Sherri|last5=Al-Saleh|first5=Suhail|last6=Narang|first6=Indra|date=2016-07-30|title=ROHHAD syndrome and evolution of sleep disordered breathing|url=https://doi.org/10.1186/s13023-016-0484-1|journal=Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases|volume=11|issue=1|pages=106|doi=10.1186/s13023-016-0484-1|issn=1750-1172|pmc=4967322|pmid=27473663}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hypothalamic dysfunction ===
Hypothalamic dysfunction refers to the hypothalamus, which is a structure within the brain which participates in regulating the [[pituitary gland]], [[autonomic nervous system]], and [[endocrine system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/hypothalamus|title=hypothalamus {{!}} Definition, Anatomy, &amp; Function|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-06-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symptoms related to hypothalamic dysfunction may include abnormal sodium balance ([[hyponatremia]] or [[hypernatremia]]), high progestin levels, low cortisol levels, delayed or early-onset puberty, and low thyroid hormone.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/rapid-onset-obesity-with-hypothalamic-dysfunction-hypoventilation-and-autonomic-dysregulation/|title=Rapid-onset Obesity with Hypothalamic Dysfunction, Hypoventilation, and Autonomic Dysregulation - NORD (National Organization for Rare Disorders)|work=NORD (National Organization for Rare Disorders)|access-date=2018-06-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patients will also often experience a decelerated growth rate throughout childhood.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Sodium imbalance within the body can have severe symptoms and be potentially life-threatening if not controlled. Hyponatremia, or low sodium levels, can cause symptoms such as nausea, headache, seizures, or even cause patients to become comatose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hyponatremia/symptoms-causes/syc-20373711|title=Hyponatremia - Symptoms and causes|work=Mayo Clinic|access-date=2018-06-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hypernatremia, or high sodium levels in the blood, can cause nausea, muscle weakness, altered mental status, or coma.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reynolds|first=Rebecca M|last2=Padfield|first2=Paul L|last3=Seckl|first3=Jonathan R|date=2006-03-25|title=Disorders of sodium balance|journal=BMJ : British Medical Journal|volume=332|issue=7543|pages=702–705|issn=0959-8138|pmc=1410848|pmid=16565125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Irregular temperature regulation and [[diabetes insipidus]] are also possible symptoms of hypothalamic dysfunction.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chop.edu/news/rohhad-rapid-onset-obesity-breathing-and-behavioral-issues-indicate-very-sick-patient|title=ROHHAD: Rapid-onset Obesity, Breathing and Behavioral Issues Indicate a Very Sick Patient|last=Philadelphia|first=The Children's Hospital of|date=2016-08-24|website=www.chop.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ROHHAD patients develop these symptoms at varying ages and in varying numbers, but all patients will develop some symptoms of hypothalamic dysfunction.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Hypoventilation ===
Symptoms of hypoventilation and breathing malfunctions typically present after the rapid weight gain. Some patients may initially develop obstructive sleep apnea, which is common in obese children.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Obstructive sleep apena is the most common form of sleep apnea, and causes breathing to abruptly stop and begin again during sleep. This is caused by throat muscles relaxing during sleep and blocking the airway, and is typically noticed as patients will snore loudly throughout the night.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/obstructive-sleep-apnea/symptoms-causes/syc-20352090|title=Obstructive sleep apnea - Symptoms and causes|work=Mayo Clinic|access-date=2018-06-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every patient diagnosed with ROHHAD develops [[Central hypoventilation syndrome|alveolar hypoventilation]], regardless of whether they presented with sleep apnea.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Alveolar hypoventilation is a condition in which patients have very low blood oxygen levels and shallow breathing. In healthy patients, when blood oxygen levels are low, the brain sends a signal to breathe and bring more oxygen to the blood. In ROHHAD patients, this reaction does not occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scripps.org/articles/2743-primary-alveolar-hypoventilation|title=Primary alveolar hypoventilation|date=2008-08-28|work=Scripps Health|access-date=2018-06-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This condition is usually only present during sleep, however in more severely affected patients shallow breathing may continue throughout the day. Hypoventilation can go unnoticed until [[Cardiac arrest|cardiopulmonary arrest]], which is why ROHHAD has the potential to be a fatal disease.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Ventilatory support is required for patients during sleep, however it is only needed during waking hours for those most severely affected (about 50% of patients).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Autonomic Dysfunction ===
Autonomic dysfunction refers to the [[autonomic nervous system]], which is responsible for regulating internal processes without conscious intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/autonomic-nervous-system|title=autonomic nervous system {{!}} Divisions &amp; Functions|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-06-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may involve abnormalities in cardiac rhythm, temperature regulation, digestion, and eye movements. Not all ROHHAD patients will experience all of these symptoms, however they will have at least some of these issues.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Examples of autonomic dysfunction include [[hyperthermia]], [[hypothermia]], pupillary dysfunction, [[strabismus]], chronic constipation, and chronic diarrhea.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bougnères|first=Pierre|last2=Pantalone|first2=Letitia|last3=Linglart|first3=Agnès|last4=Rothenbühler|first4=Anya|last5=Le Stunff|first5=Catherine|date=October 2008|title=Endocrine Manifestations of the Rapid-Onset Obesity with Hypoventilation, Hypothalamic, Autonomic Dysregulation, and Neural Tumor Syndrome in Childhood|url=https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/93/10/3971/2627372|journal=The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology &amp; Metabolism|language=en|volume=93|issue=10|pages=3971–3980|doi=10.1210/jc.2008-0238|issn=0021-972X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Neuroendocrine tumors ===
Approximately 40% of ROHHAD patients will develop tumors originating in the [[neural crest]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-11-01|title=Rapid-onset obesity with hypothalamic dysregulation, hypoventilation, and autonomic dysregulation (ROHHAD syndrome): A case report and literature review|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2173580817301323|journal=Neurología (English Edition)|language=en|volume=32|issue=9|pages=616–622|doi=10.1016/j.nrleng.2016.04.003|issn=2173-5808}}&lt;/ref&gt; These tumors are typically classified as [[ganglioneuroma]] or [[ganglioneuroblastoma]]s.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; These tumors are not believed to significantly worsen or contribute to the prognosis of ROHHAD.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pontual|first=Loic De|last2=Trochet|first2=Delphine|last3=Caillat-Zucman|first3=Sophie|last4=Shenab|first4=Othman A Abou|last5=Bougneres|first5=Pierre|last6=Crow|first6=Yanick|last7=Cunningham|first7=Steve|last8=Esteva|first8=Blandine|last9=Heberle|first9=Lada Cindro|date=2008-12|title=Delineation of Late Onset Hypoventilation Associated with Hypothalamic Dysfunction Syndrome|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/pr2008266|journal=Pediatric Research|language=En|volume=64|issue=6|pages=689–694|doi=10.1203/PDR.0b013e318187dd0e|issn=0031-3998}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was suggested that ROHHAD be renamed ROHHADNET in order to include these tumors in the diagnostic criteria, but this has only been adopted for patients who develop these tumors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kocaay|first=Pınar|last2=Şıklar|first2=Zeynep|last3=Çamtosun|first3=Emine|last4=Kendirli|first4=Tanıl|last5=Berberoğlu|first5=Merih|date=2014-12|title=ROHHAD Syndrome: Reasons for Diagnostic Difficulties in Obesity|journal=Journal of Clinical Research in Pediatric Endocrinology|volume=6|issue=4|pages=254–257|doi=10.4274/jcrpe.1432|issn=1308-5727|pmc=4293662|pmid=25541898}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Behavioral issues ===
Some children diagnosed with ROHHAD may also prevent with behavioral disorders and/or intellectual disability,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/10407/rohhad|title=ROHHAD             {{!}} Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center (GARD) – an NCATS Program|website=rarediseases.info.nih.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; however this is believed to be a result of low oxygen levels secondary to hypoventilation during childhood development. The later ROHHAD is diagnosed, the greater the risk for behavioral problems due to [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] from hypoventilation or during cardiopulmonary arrest.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Etiology ==
The etiology of ROHHAD is currently unknown, and the condition is diagnosed based on a set of clinical criteria.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; It is believed that there may be a genetic component to ROHHAD, however there is no widely accepted gene linked to the disease.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There has been one ROHHAD patient identified to have a mutation in the retinoic acid-induced 1(RAI1) gene through Whole Exome Sequencing, but there has been no otherwise proven link between the RAI1 gene and ROHHAD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thaker|first=Vidhu V.|last2=Esteves|first2=Kristyn M.|last3=Towne|first3=Meghan C.|last4=Brownstein|first4=Catherine A.|last5=James|first5=Philip M.|last6=Crowley|first6=Laura|last7=Hirschhorn|first7=Joel N.|last8=Elsea|first8=Sarah H.|last9=Beggs|first9=Alan H.|date=2015-5|title=Whole exome sequencing identifies RAI1 mutation in a morbidly obese child diagnosed with ROHHAD syndrome|journal=The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism|volume=100|issue=5|pages=1723–1730|doi=10.1210/jc.2014-4215|issn=1945-7197|pmc=4422892|pmid=25781356}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is believed that ROHHAD originates from a combination of genetic and environmental or immunological factors.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; As of yet, evidence of its etiology has not been discovered and is not well understood.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

In 2011, a case of monozygotic twins with divergent ROHHAD phenotypes was reported. One twin was affected with ROHHAD and developed symptoms, while the other twin developed normally. This report questioned the theory that ROHHAD is genetically inherited, and the authors suggest that the disease may have an autoimmune or [[Epigenetics|epigenetic]] etiology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Patwari|first=Pallavi P.|last2=Rand|first2=Casey M.|last3=Berry-Kravis|first3=Elizabeth M.|last4=Ize-Ludlow|first4=Diego|last5=Weese-Mayer|first5=Debra E.|date=2011-09-01|title=Monozygotic Twins Discordant for ROHHAD Phenotype|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/128/3/e711|journal=Pediatrics|language=en|volume=128|issue=3|pages=e711–e715|doi=10.1542/peds.2011-0155|issn=0031-4005|pmid=21807698}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pathophysiology ==
The pathophysiology of ROHHAD is not currently known or understood.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Diagnosis ==

Rapid obesity is the first symptom to arise between the ages of 1.5 and 11. This is typically followed by hypoventilation, which if left untreated, can result in fatal cardiorespiratory arrest.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This is why early diagnosis has proven to be imperative for ROHHAD patients, and it has been suggested that ROHHAD be considered in every isolated case of early rapid-onset obesity.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Early diagnosis is also vital in maintaining electrolyte and hormone balances caused by hypothalamic dysfunction in order to promote healthy development and prevent further problems.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

As the symptoms of ROHHAD are so diverse and the condition is so rare, the disease is often misdiagnosed as [[Cushing's syndrome|Cushing's disease]] or [[Central hypoventilation syndrome|Congenital Central Hypoventilation Syndrom]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;e when it first presents in patients.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Prevention ==
As the cause of ROHHAD is unknown, there is no way to prevent onset of the disease.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Management ==
There is no known cure for ROHHAD, therefore treatment for the disease involves managing symptoms as they manifest in the patient. As not all ROHHAD patients develop the same symptoms, treatment plans vary between patients. Proper treatment of hypothalamic dysfunction and hypoventilation is the most critical aspect of ROHHAD management, as these symptoms have the greatest ability to cause death or behavioral problems if left uncontrolled.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Rapid onset obesity treatment ===
Attempting to control weight through diet and exercise can be exceedingly difficult in patients with ROHHAD due to a number of factors. Encouraging ROHHAD patients to exercise vigorously can be dangerous, as their breathing will not increase with exertion and this can cause hypoxia. Therefore, it is important for ROHHAD patients to exercise at a moderate intensity and for their oxygen levels to be monitored throughout. Typically, the obesity associated with ROHHAD is managed by preventing further weight gain as the child grows.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Hypothalamic dysfunction treatment ===
Treatment for hypothalamic dysfunction is tailored to each patient's needs, as there is no set of hypothalamic symptoms that all ROHHAD patients will manifest.All ROHHAD patients should be evaluated by a pediatric endocrinologist in order to determine a treatment plan for hypothalamic dysfunction.

Patients may be given human growth hormone to treat stunted growth, or hormone replacement to treat any hormone deficiencies. Often patients are placed on a strict fluid regimen to treat for imbalances such as hyponatremia or hypernatremia.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Patients who present with diabetes insipidus may also be treated with desmopressin, a synthetic replacement for anti-diuretic hormone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diabetes-insipidus/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20351274|title=Diabetes insipidus - Diagnosis and treatment - Mayo Clinic|website=www.mayoclinic.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hypoventilation treatment ===
Every ROHHAD patient requires some form of ventilatory support, ranging from non-invasive [[Non-invasive ventilation|BiPAP]] machines to tracheostomy procedures. Approximately 50% of ROHHAD patients will require ventilatory support day and night, whereas the other half only require night-time support.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

A bilevel positive airway pressure machine, or BiPAP, is a ventilator mask worn at night. The BiPAP pushes air into the lungs, therefore breathing for the patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/healthlibrary/test_procedures/neurological/bipap_135,314|title=BiPap {{!}} Johns Hopkins Medicine Health Library|website=www.hopkinsmedicine.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is helpful for ROHHAD patients, as hypoventilation causes the mechanism that controls breathing in oxygen to slow and sometimes stop during sleep.

A [[Tracheotomy|tracheostomy]] is the result of a surgical procedure to create a hole in the [[trachea]] in order to give access to ventilatory tubing. This procedure is performed to create an airway in situations when long term continuous use of a ventilator is needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/tracheostomy/about/pac-20384673|title=Tracheostomy - Mayo Clinic|website=www.mayoclinic.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; ROHHAD patients whose hypoventilation is so severe that they require support during the day and night will often undergo tracheostomies.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Autonomic dysfunction treatment ===
Treatment for autonomic dysfunction varies greatly on the severity of the dysfunction and the type. Many patients with ROHHAD experience strabismus, which is a weakness in eye muscle causing a "cross-eyed" effect. This can be treated with glasses, eye muscle exercises, or even surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aapos.org/terms/conditions/100|title=Strabismus — AAPOS|website=www.aapos.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; ROHHAD patients also often experience [[bradycardia]], or low heart rate. This may require a cardiac pacemaker be placed in order to regulate heartbeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bradycardia/symptoms-causes/syc-20355474|title=Bradycardia - Symptoms and causes|work=Mayo Clinic|access-date=2018-06-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gastrointestinal problems, such as constipation or diarrhea, are often treated on an as-needed basis with laxatives or dietary changes. It is also important that ambient temperatures are monitored in patients who have temperature regulation issues such as hyperthermia or hypothermia.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Neuroendocrine tumor treatment ===
Tumors of neural crest origin develop in approximately 40% of patients. These are typically ganglioneuromas or ganglioneuroblastomas. Neural crest tumors have the ability to form in multiple organs tissues throughout the body, typically in the chest or abdomen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maguire|first=Lillias H.|last2=Thomas|first2=Alyssa R.|last3=Goldstein|first3=Allan M.|date=2015-3|title=Tumors of the neural crest: Common themes in development and cancer|journal=Developmental Dynamics: An Official Publication of the American Association of Anatomists|volume=244|issue=3|pages=311–322|doi=10.1002/dvdy.24226|issn=1097-0177|pmid=25382669}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is therefore important for ROHHAD patients to have regular MRI and CT scans to screen for tumor growth.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; It is believed that these tumors do not significantly affect the prognosis for ROHHAD patients.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Neuroendocrine tumors can arise 7–16 years after the initial onset of symptoms, therefore the name ROHHADNET (which includes these tumors) has not been widely accepted as it is believed this name would lead to further misdiagnosis. Treatment for these neuroendocrine tumors requires surgical removal, typically performed by a pediatric oncologist.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Outcomes/Prognosis ==
The most dangerous and fatal aspect of ROHHAD is the potential for cardiopulmonary arrest if hypoventilation is not found and treated in a timely manner. Approximately 50 to 60% of ROHHAD patients die due to cardiopulmonary arrest.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The earlier symptoms are identified and patients are diagnosed, the more positive their outcomes are.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

It has been found that children who are diagnosed earlier in life and received treatment for hypoventilation and hypothalamic dysfunction (fluid imbalances, etc.) are less likely to develop behavioral issues or experience sudden cardiorespiratory arrest later in life.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weese-Mayer|first=Debra E.|last2=Rand|first2=Casey M.|last3=Ize-Ludlow|first3=Diego|date=2013-8|title=Commentary: Rapid-onset Obesity with Hypothalamic Dysfunction, Hypoventilation, and Autonomic Dysregulation (ROHHAD): Remember Your ABCs (Airway, Breathing, Circulation)|journal=Journal of the Canadian Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry|volume=22|issue=3|pages=238–239|issn=1719-8429|pmc=3749899|pmid=23970914}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
A group at [[Lurie Children's Hospital|Ann &amp; Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago]] has an international repository for patients with ROHHAD, which is available to researchers who are interested in the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.rohhadassociation.com/?page_id=513|title=ROHHAD Research - ROHHAD Association|work=ROHHAD Association|access-date=2018-06-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of June 2018, there are 3 clinical trials currently recruiting patients with ROHHAD being performed respectively at Lurie Children's Hospital, [https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/kimmel_cancer_center/index.html Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center], and [[Boston Children's Hospital]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=ROHHAD&amp;Search=Search|title=Search of: ROHHAD - List Results - ClinicalTrials.gov|access-date=2018-06-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Epidemiology ==
There have been at least 100 documented cases of ROHHAD worldwide.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== History ==
ROHHAD was first described in 1965, and this was believed to be the first reported instance of hypoventilation presenting alongside hypothalamic dysfunction.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=FISHMAN|first=L. S.|date=1965-08-01|title=Primary Alveolar Hypoventilation Syndrome (Ondine's Curse)|url=https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/article-abstract/501457|journal=American Journal of Diseases of Children|language=en|volume=110|issue=2|pages=155|doi=10.1001/archpedi.1965.02090030165011|issn=0002-922X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ROHHAD had often been mistaken for congenital central hypoventilation syndrome, until the distinction was made by Ize-Ludlow et al. in 2007. These conditions are now permanently differentiated from one other, as patients with CCHS have mutations in the PHOX2B gene, whereas ROHHAD patients do not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ize-Ludlow|first=Diego|last2=Gray|first2=Juliette A.|last3=Sperling|first3=Mark A.|last4=Berry-Kravis|first4=Elizabeth M.|last5=Milunsky|first5=Jeff M.|last6=Farooqi|first6=I.

== Organizations ==
The ROHHAD Association is an organization that aims to increase awareness for ROHHAD and promote research opportunities. They also organized fundraisers and events in order to give to researchers and promote visibility of ROHHAD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.rohhadassociation.com/?page_id=149|title=About Us - ROHHAD Association|work=ROHHAD Association|access-date=2018-06-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; ROHHAD Fight Inc is a charity that was created for Marisa, a child who was diagnosed with ROHHAD, with the goal of raising awareness for the condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rohhadfight.org/|title=Home|last=|first=|date=|website=www.rohhadfight.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals''' ('''REACH''') is a [[European Union regulation]] dating from 18 December 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Full title: Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2006 concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), establishing a European Chemicals Agency.&lt;/ref&gt; REACH addresses the production and use of [[chemical substance]]s, and their potential impacts on both human health and the environment.  Its 849 pages took seven years to pass, and it has been described as the most complex legislation in the Union's history&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=EU's REACH chemicals law begins life in Helsinki | date=31 May 2007 | publisher=EUobserver.com | url=http://euobserver.com/9/24169}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the most important in 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Q&amp;A: Reach chemicals legislation | date=28 November 2005 | publisher=BBC News | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4437304.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the strictest law to date regulating chemical substances and will affect industries throughout the world.&lt;ref name="US affected"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/12/14/MNGR2MV8UT1.DTL&amp;hw=toxic+chemicals&amp;sn=001&amp;sc=1000 | title=European Parliament OKs world's toughest law on toxic chemicals | date=14 December 2006 | publisher=San Francisco Chronicle | first=Marla | last=Cone}}&lt;/ref&gt; REACH entered into force on 1 June 2007, with a phased implementation over the next decade. The regulation also established the [[European Chemicals Agency]], which manages the technical, scientific and administrative aspects of REACH.

==Overview==
[[File:European Chemicals Agency.jpg|{{largethumb}}|left|[[European Chemicals Agency]] headquarters in {{ill|Annankatu (Helsinki)|fi}}.]]

When REACH is fully in force, it will require all companies manufacturing or importing chemical substances into the European Union in quantities of one [[tonne]] or more per year to register these substances with a new [[European Chemicals Agency]] (ECHA) in {{ill|Annankatu (Helsinki)|fi}}, [[Finland]]. Since REACH applies to some substances that are contained in objects (''articles'' in REACH terminology), any company importing goods into Europe could be affected.&lt;ref name="US affected"/&gt;

The [[European Chemicals Agency]] has set three major deadlines for registration of chemicals. In general these are determined by tonnage manufactured or imported, with 1000 tonnes/a. being required to be registered by 1 December 2010, 100 tonnes/a. by 1 June 2013 and 1 tonne/a. by 1 June 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reagent.co.uk/blog/what-is-reach/|title=What is REACH? – ReAgent Chemical Services|date=6 February 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, chemicals of higher concern or toxicity also have to meet the 2010 deadline.

About 143,000 chemical substances marketed in the European Union were pre-registered by the 1 December 2008 deadline. Although pre-registering was not mandatory, it allows potential registrants much more time before they have to fully register. Supply of substances to the European market which have not been pre-registered or registered is illegal (known in REACH as "no data, no market").

REACH also addresses the continued use of chemical ''[[substance of very high concern|substances of very high concern]]'' (SVHC) because of their potential negative impacts on human health or the environment. From 1 June 2011, the European Chemicals Agency must be notified of the presence of SVHCs in articles if the total quantity used is more than one tonne per year and the SVHC is present at more than 0.1% of the mass of the object. Some uses of SVHCs may be subject to prior authorisation from the European Chemicals Agency, and applicants for authorisation will have to include plans to replace the use of the SVHC with a safer alternative (or, if no safer alternative exists, the applicant must work to find one) - known as ''substitution''. {{As of|2015|06|15}}, there are 168 SVHCs on the candidate list for authorization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

REACH applies to all [[Chemical substance|chemicals]] imported or produced in the EU. The European Chemicals Agency will manage the technical, [[Science|scientific]] and administrative aspects of the REACH system.

To somewhat simplify the registration of the 143,000 substances and to limit vertebrate animal testing as far as possible, substance information exchange forums (SIEFs) are formed amongst legal entities (such as manufacturers, importers, and data holders) who are dealing with the same substance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://echa.europa.eu/sief_en.asp |title=Substance Information Exchange Fora&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |publisher=[[European Chemicals Agency]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091223062045/http://echa.europa.eu/sief_en.asp |archivedate=2009-12-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows them to join forces and finances to create 1 registration dossier. However, this creates a series of new problems as a SIEF is the cooperation between sometimes a thousand legal entities that did not know each other at all before but suddenly must:
*find each other and start communicating openly and honestly
*start sharing data
*start sharing costs in a fair and transparent way
*democratically and in full consensus take the most complex decisions
in order to complete a several thousand end points dossier in a limited time.

The [[European Commission]] supports businesses affected by REACH by handing out &amp;ndash; free of charge &amp;ndash; a software application ([[IUCLID]]) that simplifies capturing, managing, and submitting data on chemical properties and effects. Such submission is a mandatory part of the [[REACh authorisation procedure|registration process]]. Under certain circumstances the performance of a [[chemical safety assessment]] (CSA) is mandatory and a [[chemical safety report]] (CSR) assuring the safe use of the substance has to be submitted with the dossier. Dossier submission is done using the web-based software [[REACH-IT]].

The aim of REACH is to improve the protection of human health and the environment by identification of the intrinsic properties of chemical substances. At the same time, innovative capability and competitiveness of the EU chemicals industry should be enhanced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Reach|url = http://www.teppfa.eu/reach/|website = TEPPFA|accessdate = 2015-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The European Commission’s (EC) White Paper of 2001 on a ‘future chemical strategy’ proposed a system that requires chemicals manufactured in quantities of greater than 1 tonne to be ‘registered’, those manufactured in quantities greater than 100 tonnes to be ‘evaluated’, and certain substances of high concern (for example carcinogenic, mutagenic and toxic to reproduction - CMR’s) to be ‘authorised’.

The EC adopted its proposal for a new scheme to manage the manufacture, importation and supply of chemicals in Europe on in October 2003. This proposal eventually became law once the European Parliament officially approved its final text of REACH. It came into force on 1 June 2007.&lt;ref name="TEPPFA, The European Plastic Pipes and Fittings Association"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.teppfa.eu/reach/|title = REACh|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = TEPPFA, The European Plastic Pipes and Fittings Association|first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Requirements==
One of the major elements of the REACH [[regulation]] is the requirement to communicate information on [[Chemical substance|chemicals]] up and down the [[supply chain]]. This ensures that manufacturers, importers, and also their customers are aware of information relating to [[health]] and [[safety]] of the products supplied. For many [[retail]]ers the obligation to provide information about [[Chemical substance|substance]]s in their products within 45 days of receipt of a request from a [[consumer]] is particularly challenging. Having detailed information on the substances present in their products will allow retailers to work with the manufacturing base to substitute or remove potentially harmful substances from products. The list of harmful substances is continuously growing and requires [[organization]]s to constantly monitor any announcements and additions to the REACH scope. This can be done on the [[European Chemicals Agency]]'s website.

===Registration===
A requirement is to collect, collate and submit data to the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) on the hazardous properties of all substances (except Polymers and non-isolated intermediates) manufactured or imported into the EU in quantities above 1 tonne per year. Certain substances of high concern, such as carcinogenic, mutagenic and reproductive toxic substances (CMRs) will have to be authorised.

Chemicals will be registered in three phases according to the tonnage of the substance evaluation:

More than 1000 tonnes a year, or substances of highest concern, must be registered in the first 3 years;

100-1000 tonnes a year must be registered in the first 6 years;

1-100 tonnes a year must be registered in the first 11 years.

In addition, industry should prepare risk assessments and provide controls measures for using the substance safely to downstream users.&lt;ref name="TEPPFA, The European Plastic Pipes and Fittings Association"/&gt;

===Evaluation===
Evaluation provides a means for the authorities to require registrants, and in very limited cases downstream users, to provide further information.

There are two types of evaluation: dossier evaluation and substance :

Dossier evaluation is conducted by authorities to examine proposals for testing to ensure that unnecessary animal tests and costs are avoided, and to check the compliance of registration dossier with the registration requirements.

The relevant authorities perform substance evaluation when there is a reason to suspect that a substance presents a risk to human health or the environment (e.g. because of its structural similarity to another substance). Therefore, all registration dossiers submitted for a substance are examined together and any other available information is taken into account.&lt;ref name="TEPPFA, The European Plastic Pipes and Fittings Association"/&gt;

===Authorisation===
{{main|REACH authorisation procedure}}
The REACH proposal sets up a system under which the use of substances with properties of very high concern and their placing on the market can be made subject to an authorisation requirement.

This authorisation requirement ensures that risks from the use of such substances are either adequately controlled or justified by socio-economic grounds, having taken into account the available information on alternative substances or processes.

The Regulation enables restrictions of use to be introduced across the European Community where this is shown to be necessary. Member States or the Commission may prepare such proposals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.teppfa.eu/reach/|title = REACh|date = |accessdate = |website = www.teppfa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Information exchange===
[[File:REACh Dates.png|{{largethumb}}|REACh Key Dates]]

Manufactures and/or importers should develop risk reduction measures for all known uses of the chemical including downstream uses. Downstream users such as plastic pipe producers should provide detail of their uses to their suppliers. In cases where downstream users decide not to disclose this information, they need to have their own CSR.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.teppfa.eu/reach/|title = REACh|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = TEPPFA, The Plastic Pipes and Fittings Association|first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;


==History==
REACH is the product of a wide-ranging overhaul of EU chemical policy.  It passed the first reading in the [[European Parliament]] on 17 November 2005, and the [[Council of the European Union|Council of Ministers]] reached a political agreement for a common position on 13 December 2005. The European Parliament approved REACH on 13 December 2006 and the Council of Ministers formally adopted it on 18 December 2006. Weighing up expenditure versus profit has always been a significant issue, with the estimated cost of compliance being around €5&amp;nbsp;billion over 11&amp;nbsp;years, and the assumed health benefits of saved billions of euro in healthcare costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=EU backs landmark chemicals law | date=13 December 2005 | publisher=BBC News | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4524772.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there have been different studies on the estimated cost which vary considerably in the outcome. It came into force on 20 January 2009, and will be fully implemented by 2015.

A separate regulation – the [[CLP Regulation]] (for "Classification, Labelling, Packaging") – implements the United Nations [[Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals]] (GHS) and will steadily replace the previous [[Dangerous Substances Directive (67/548/EEC)|Dangerous Substances Directive]] and [[Dangerous Preparations Directive]].

The REACH regulation was amended in April 2018 to include specific information requirements for [[nanomaterials]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://euon.echa.europa.eu/view-article/-/journal_content/title/improved-clarity-on-nanomaterials-in-the-eu-member-states-vote-to-amend-reach-annex-1|title=Improved clarity on nanomaterials in the EU - Member States vote to amend REACH Annexes|last=|first=|date=|publisher=The European Union Observatory for Nanomaterials (EUON)|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rationale==
The legislation was proposed under dual reasoning: protection of [[health|human health]] and protection of [[natural environment|the environment]].

Using potentially [[toxic substances]] (such as [[phthalate]]s or [[brominated flame retardant]]s) is deemed undesirable and REACH will force the use of certain substances to be phased out. Using potentially toxic substances in products other than those [[ingest]]ed by humans (such as [[electronic device]]s) may seem to be safe, but there are several ways in which chemicals can enter the human body and the environment. Substances can leave particles during [[consumer]] use, for example into the air where they can be inhaled or ingested. Even where they might not do direct harm to humans, they can contaminate the air or water, and can enter the food chain through plants, fish or other animals. According to the European Commission, little safety information exists for 99 percent of the tens of thousands of chemicals placed on the market before 1981.&lt;ref name="US affected"/&gt; There were 100,106 chemicals in use in the EU in 1981, when the last survey was performed. Of these only 3,000 have been tested and over 800 are known to be carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic to reproduction. These are listed in the Annex 1 of the [[Dangerous Substances Directive (67/548/EEC)|Dangerous Substances Directive]] (now Annex VI of the [[CLP Regulation]]).

Continued use of many toxic chemicals is sometimes justified because "at very low levels they are not a concern to health".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Pesticides 'in a third of foods' | date=27 September 2006 | publisher=BBC News | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/5384138.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many of these substances may [[bioaccumulation|bioaccumulate]] in the human body, thus reaching dangerous concentrations. They may also [[chemical reaction|chemically react]] with one another,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Food chemicals 'may harm humans' | date=21 September 2006 | publisher=BBC News | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/5366028.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; producing new substances with new risks.

==In non-EU countries==
A number of countries outside of the European Union have started to implement REACH-regulations or are in the process of adopting such a regulatory framework to approach a more globalized system of chemicals registration under the [[Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals]] (GHS).&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130708194823/http://www.icis.com/Articles/2010/05/31/9362538/reach-like+regulations+enacted+globally.html ICIS.com REACH-like regulations enacted globally] retrieved July 8, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
Balkan countries such as [[Croatia]] and [[Serbia]] are in the process of adopting the EU REACH system under the auspices of the EU IPA programme. [[Switzerland]] has moved towards implementation of REACH through partial revision of the Swiss Chemical Ordinance on February 1, 2009.  The new Chemicals Management Regulation in [[Turkey]] is paving the way for the planned adoption of REACH in 2013. [[China]] has moved towards a more efficient and coherent system for the control of chemicals in compliance with GHS.

==Controversy==
Apart from the potential costs to [[industry]] and the complexity of the new law, REACH has also attracted concern because of [[animal testing]]. Animal tests on [[vertebrate]]s are now required but allowed only once per each new substance and if suitable alternatives cannot be used.  If a company pays for such tests, it must sell the rights of the results for a "reasonable" price, which is not defined.  There are additional concerns that access to the necessary information may prove very costly for potential registrants needing to purchase it.

An opinion in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in 2009 by Thomas Hartung and Constanza Rovida estimated that 54 million vertebrate animals would be used under REACH and that the costs would amount to €9.5 billion.&lt;ref&gt;T. Hartung &amp; C. Rovida: Chemical regulators have overreached. Opinion in Nature, vol. 460, 27 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hartung is the former head of European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods (ECVAM).{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} In a news release, ECHA criticised assumptions made by Hartung and Rovida; ECHA's alternative assumptions reduced sixfold the number of animals.&lt;ref&gt;ECHA - [http://echa.europa.eu/doc/press/pr_09_11_animal_testing_20090828.pdf New study inaccurate on the number of test animals for REACH] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100215231108/http://echa.europa.eu/doc/press/pr_09_11_animal_testing_20090828.pdf |date=2010-02-15 }}. Helsinki, 28 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

On 8 June 2006, the REACH proposal was criticized by non-EU countries, including the United States, India and [[Brazil]], which stated that the bill would hamper global trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Mark | last=Beunderman | title=EU chemicals bill under fire from US-led coalition | date=June 9, 2006 | publisher=EUobserver.com | url=http://euobserver.com/9/21813 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Only representative services==
Non-EU consultancies offer "only representative" services, though according to REACH it is not possible to register a substance if your "only representative" consultancy company is not based in the EU, unless it is subcontracted to an EU-based registrant.

Only representatives are EU based entities that must comply with REACH (Article 8) and should operate standard, transparent working practices. The Only Representative assumes responsibility and [[Legal liability|liability]] for fulfilling obligiations of importers in accordance with REACH for substances being brought into the EU by a non-EU manufacturer.

The SIEFs will bring new challenges. An article in the business news service [[Chemical Watch]] described how some "pre-registrants" may simply be consultants hoping for work ("gold diggers") while others may be aiming to charge exorbitant rates for the data they have to offer ("jackals").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Authorisation List==
The [[European Chemical Agency]] (ECHA) has published the REACH Authorisation List,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://echa.europa.eu/addressing-chemicals-of-concern/authorisation/recommendation-for-inclusion-in-the-authorisation-list/authorisation-list|title=Page has moved - ECHA|website=echa.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; in an effort to tighten the use of [[substance of very high concern|Substances of Very High Concern]] (SVHCs). The list is an official recommendation from the ECHA to the [[European Commission]]. The list is also regularly updated and expanded. Currently the Candidate List for Authorisation comprises a total of 173 SVHCs, some of which are already active on the Authorization List.

To sell or use these substances, manufacturers, importers, and retailers in the [[European Union]] (EU) must apply for authorization from the [[European Chemical Agency|ECHA]]. The applicant is to submit a chemical safety report on the risks entailed by the substance, as well as an analysis of possible alternative substances or technologies including present and future [[research and development]] processed.

When rolled-up, predators are unable to unravel giant pill millipedes since the margins of their second and last dorsal plates fit perfectly into one another, creating a sealed ball. A few giant pill millipede species are able to produce sound, the only millipedes known to do this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=U. Haacker |year=1968 |title= Das Sexualverhalten von ''Sphaerotherium dorsale'' (Myriapoda, Diplopoda) |journal= Verhandlungen der Deutschen Zoologischen Gesellschaft |volume=3 |pages=454–463}}&lt;/ref&gt; This order of millipedes is also unique in that some African species are used for medicinal purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=D.

==Morphology==
Sphaerotheriidans are characterized by a relatively conservative body [[morphology (biology)|morphology]]; superficially all species and [[genera]] look the same.&lt;ref name=TW/&gt; [[Dorsum (biology)|Dorsally]], their head is followed by twelve body [[tergite]]s (collum, thoracic shield, and ten normal tergites) and the anal shield. Ventrally, females possess twenty-one leg pairs (forty-two legs in total), while males carry two additional modified leg pairs, the anterior and posterior [[telopod]]s under their anal shield. The telopods resemble [[chelae]] and/or clamp-like structures, which are probably used in holding the female during mating.&lt;ref name=TW/&gt; In the position of the male telopods, the females instead have a sclerotized subanal plate, which in some species such as those belonging to the family Arthrosphaeridae, is enlarged and is used to produce vibrations ([[stridulation]]).&lt;ref name=TW/&gt; Furthermore, unlike other large-bodied millipede orders, Sphaerotheriida do not have [[glands]] that excrete [[poisonous]] or ill-smelling substances. Instead they depend entirely on their rolling-up behavior for protection.
[[File:Pillmillipede talakaveri.jpg|thumb|left|A pill millipede from the [[Western Ghats]], India]]
Sphaerotheriida somewhat resemble the North American and Eurasian pill millipedes of the order Glomerida, but are generally larger in size ({{convert|20|-|80|mm|1|disp=or}} body length). Until the end of the 20th century only the largest known species in the order Glomerida rivalled the size of even the smallest known Sphaerotheriida, but in the early 21st century a much smaller Sphaerotheriid was described from Madagascar: full-grown specimens of ''Microsphaerotherium ivohibiensis'' are just the size of a pea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=T. Wesener  |author2=D. van den Spiegel  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2007 |title=''Microsphaerotherium ivohibiensis'', a new genus and species of giant-pill millipedes from Madagascar (Diplopoda, Sphaerotheriidaa, Arthrosphaerinae) |journal=[[Journal of Afrotropical Zoology]] |volume=3 |pages=153–160}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Also on Madagascar, some giant pill millipede species exhibit [[island gigantism]], reaching more than {{convert|9.5|cm|abbr=on}} in outstretched length and a size comparable to an orange when rolled up.&lt;ref name=TJ2008/&gt;

The orders differ in the number of tergites (10 or 11 in Glomerida, 12 in Sphaerotheriida) and legs (17 or 19 in Glomerida, 21 or 23 in Sphaerotheriida), and show great differences in their head morphology and [[genital]] openings, among other traits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=H. Enghoff |year=1984 |title=Phylogeny of millipedes – a cladistic analysis |journal=[[Journal of Zoological Systematics and Evolutionary Research]] |volume=22 |pages=8–26 |doi=10.1111/j.1439-0469.1984.tb00559.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both orders have the ability to roll into a perfect ball, protecting the head, antennae, and the vulnerable underside. However, this rolled-up position (volvation) is achieved differently. In Glomerida, the enlarged second body ring (thoracic shield) has a more or less visible gap within which fit the tips of tergites 3–11, whereas in Sphaerotheriida the tips of tergites 3–12 fit perfectly into a groove on the thoracic shield. Juvenile sphaerotheriidans show the same gap as the Glomerida.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=H. P. Wesner |language=German |title=Die Einkugelung |url=http://homepage.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/Thomas.Wesener/einkugelung.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many giant pill millipede species have special ledges ('locking carinae') on the underside of the tergite tips and the anal shield which can be moved above a brim on the thoracic shield. These millipedes remain passively locked-up since they need not continued muscle contraction to remain in the rolled-up position.

==Distribution==
[[File:Arthrosphaera bicolor.png|thumb|''Arthrosphaera bicolor'' (Arthrosphaeridae), named and painted by [[Reginald Innes Pocock]]]]
In general, Sphaerotheriida have a [[Gondwana]]n distribution (the exception is [[Zephroniidae]] from southeast Asia and adjacent regions).&lt;ref name=TW/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=C. A. W. Jeekel|year=1974|title=The group taxonomy and geography of the Sphaerotheriida (Diplopoda)|journal=[[Symposia of the Zoological Society of London]]|volume=32|pages=41–52}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gondwana was the large southern continent that formed after the breakup of the supercontinent [[Pangaea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jason R. Ali &amp; Jonathan C. Aitchison|year=2008|title=Gondwana to Asia: plate tectonics, paleogeography and the biological connectivity of the Indian subcontinent from the Middle Jurassic through latest Eocene (166–35 Ma)|journal=[[Earth-Science Reviews]]|volume=88|issue=3|pages=145–166 |doi=10.1016/j.earscirev.2008.01.007|bibcode=2008ESRv...88..145A|last2=Aitchison}}&lt;/ref&gt; It included the modern-day landmasses of South America (which however lacks sphaerotheriidans), New Zealand, Australia, India, and Madagascar. It is believed that the Sphaerotheriida originated in Gondwana and then diverged into its various forms.

Sphaerotheriida is divided into four families whose distributions do not overlap: [[Procyliosomatidae]], [[Zephroniidae]], [[Sphaerotheriidae]] and [[Arthrosphaeridae]]. The [[Basal (phylogenetics)|most basal]] family, Procyliosomatidae, lives in Australia and New Zealand.&lt;ref name=TW/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=C. A. W. Jeekel |year=1986 |title= Millipedes from Australia |journal=[[Beaufortia (journal)|Beaufortia]] |volume=36 |issue=3 |pages=35–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Zephroniidae (synonym Sphaeropoeidae) occurs in southeast Asia from the Himalayas and China south and east to Sulawesi and inhabits some Philippines islands.&lt;ref name=TW/&gt; The family Sphaerotheriidae only occurs in South Africa with isolated populations in Zimbabwe and Malawi (probably introduced).&lt;ref name=VS/&gt; The Arthrosphaeridae are distributed in southern India and Madagascar.&lt;ref name=TW/&gt;

A few giant pill millipede species have been dispersed by humans, probably inadvertently. Examples include the Sri Lankan Arthrosphaeridae species ''Arthrosphaera brandtii'' which has established a population in the [[Usambara Mountains]], Tanzania,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=H. Enghoff|year=1978|title=''Arthrosphaera cf. brandti'' (Humbert), a giant pill millipede found in Tanzania, probably introduced from Sri Lanka|journal= Revue de zoologie africaine|volume=91|issue=4|pages=997–999}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as some South African ''Sphaerotherium'' species which have isolated populations in Malawi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=D. van den Spiegel|year=2002|title=On the occurrence of ''Sphaerotherium punctulatum'' in Malawi (Diplopoda: Sphaerotheriidae)|journal= Musee Royal de L'Afrique Centrale, Tervuren, Zoologique |volume=290|pages=171–174}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another likely candidate is ''Sechelliosoma forcipatum'', a small species of the southeast Asian family Zephroniidae, currently only known from a single island in the [[Seychelles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=J.-P. Mauriés|year=1980|title=Contributions à l'étude de la faune terrestre des îles granitiques de l'archipel des Séchelles|journal=Revue Zoologique africaine |volume=94|issue=1|pages=138–168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecology==
Little is known about the ecology, development and life history of Sphaerotheriida, but apparently all species are [[detritivore]]s, feeding on dead organic matter such as leaves and wood on the forest floor. Like earthworms, they play an important role in [[decomposition]]; by breaking down decaying [[organic matter]] they release locked up nutrients back into the soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=C. S. Crawford |year=1992 |title=Millipedes as model detritivores |journal= Berichte des Naturwissenschaftlich-Medizinischen Verein Innsbruck |volume=10 |pages=277–288}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Grassland Invertebrates |publisher=Chapman and Hall, London |year=1994 |author=J. P. Curry |pages=437 |isbn= 0-412-16520-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=James M. Lawrence  |author2=Michael J. Samways  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2003 |title=Litter breakdown by the Seychelles giant millipede and the conservation of soil process on Cousine Island, Seychelles |journal=[[Biological Conservation (journal)|Biological Conservation]] |volume=113 |pages=125–132 |doi=10.1016/S0006-3207(02)00355-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=K. M. Ashwini  |author2=K. R. Sridhar  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2002 |title=Towards organic farming with the millipede ''Arthrosphaera magna'' |journal=Current Science |volume=82 |issue=1 |pages=20–22 |url=http://www.ias.ac.in/currsci/jan102002/20.pdf |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such recycling is essential for plant nutrition and accordingly for the entire ecology. It is possible that giant pill millipedes rely on special [[bacteria]] in their gut, much as [[termites]] do, to exploit the nutritional value of otherwise indigestible material such as [[lignin]].

Like most millipedes, Sphaerotheriida inhabit mainly the leaf litter of humid forests. Some species, however, show an [[arboreal]] (tree-living) lifestyle,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF00347991 |author1=U. Haacker  |author2=S. Fuchs  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1972 |title=Tree climbing in pill-millipedes |journal=[[Oecologia]] |volume=10 |pages=191–192 |issue=2|bibcode=1972Oecol..10..191H}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in these the rolling-up reflex has been suppressed.&lt;ref name=WP&gt;{{cite journal |author1=T. Wesener  |author2=P. Sierwald  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2005 |title= New giant pill millipede species from the littoral forest of Madagascar (Diplopoda, Sphaerotheriida, Zoosphaerium) |journal=[[Zootaxa]] |volume=1097 |pages=1–60 |url=http://www.mapress.com/zootaxa/2005f/zt01097p060.pdf |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Defense against predation==
[[File:Sphaerotheriid pill millipede (Order Sphaerotheriida) (4364601900).jpg|thumb|right|Giant pill millipede in rolled-up position]]
The rolling-up ability and tough skeletal armor of the Sphaerotheriida offer protection against some predators, but a wide variety of predators feed on them, or even specialise in them as a source of food.&lt;ref name=PMID17737407&gt;{{cite journal |author=Thomas Eisner &amp; Joseph A. David |year=1967 |title=Mongoose throwing and smashing millipedes |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=155 |issue=3762 |pages=577–579 |pmid=17737407 |doi=10.1126/science.155.3762.577|bibcode=1967Sci...155..577E |last2=Davis }}&lt;/ref&gt; Species that specialize in feeding on giant pill millipedes necessarily have evolved special structures or behaviors to overcome their defences. Examples include the South African snail family [[Chlamydephoridae]] which almost exclusively feeds on giant pill millipedes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=D. G.

Apart from the rolling-up behavior of giant pill millipedes, [[camouflage]] may be an important defense mechanism against predators that hunt by sight, such as birds.

Sphaerotheriida also are subject to internal [[parasitism]], and several species of nematodes are [[obligate parasite]]s of particular species of giant pill millipedes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1139/z84-303 |author1=Martin L.

==Phylogeny==
The first modern [[phylogenetic]] study of Sphaerotheriida (simplified below) was conducted by Wesener and VandenSpiegel in 2009, using morphological data from 36 species in 10 genera. The South African family Sphaerotheriidae was found to be [[Sister group|sister]] to the Madagascar family Arthrosphaeridae. The Australian genus ''Procyliosoma'' was found to be distinct from all other genera and placed in its own family, Procyliosomatidae.&lt;ref name=TW/&gt;

'''''The Collector of Bedford Street''''' is a 2002 [[documentary film]] about director [[Alice Elliott]]'s neighbor, Larry Selman, a community activist and fundraiser who had an [[intellectual disability]].

==Film content==

When Larry's primary caregiver becomes unable to care for him, his New York City neighborhood community rallies together to protect his independent lifestyle by establishing an adult trust fund in his behalf. 

Larry is the beneficiary of an Adult Supplemental Needs Trust, which was sponsored by the Bedford-Barrow-Commerce (BBC) Block Association through the UJA-Federation Community Trust for Disabled Adults. The BBC's sponsorship of Larry marked the first time a group outside of a beneficiary's family established an Adult Supplemental Needs Trust.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url=http://www.thecollectorofbedfordstreet.com/about/trust.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010155415/http://www.thecollectorofbedfordstreet.com/about/trust.php |archivedate=2008-10-10 |df= }}

'''''The Politics of Experience and The Bird of Paradise''''' is a 1967 book by Scottish [[psychiatrist]] [[R.D. Laing]], comprising two parts - the first a collection of seven articles previously published between 1962 and 1965;&lt;ref&gt;R. D. Laing, ''The Politics of Experience and The Bird of Paradise'' (1984) p. 9-10&lt;/ref&gt; the second a free-flowing quasi-autobiographical piece of poetry and prose.

The work was inspired in part by Laing’s extensive experimentation with [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]];&lt;ref name=tb&gt;Tom Burns (2006). ''Psychiatry: A Very Short Introduction'', Oxford University Press, pp. 96-98.&lt;/ref&gt; but also owes a debt (among others) to [[Gregory Bateson]] and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]].&lt;ref&gt;R. D. Laing, ''The Politics of Experience and The Bird of Paradise'' (1984) p. 94 and p. 83n&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
Laing examines the nature of human experience from a [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] point of view, as well as the possibilities for psychotherapy in an existentially distorted world.  He challenges the idea of normality in modern society, and argues that it is not merely people who are mad, but the world as well.&lt;ref name=well&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cjsonline.ca/reviews/rdlaing.html |title=Review: The Crucible of Experience: R.D. Laing and the Crisis of Psychotherapy |author= |date=May–June 2001 |work=Canadian Journal of Sociology Online |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415075718/http://www.cjsonline.ca/reviews/rdlaing.html |archivedate=2012-04-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jun/01/mentalhealth.society |title='Dad solved other people's problems - but not his own' |author=Elizabeth Day and Graham Keeley |date=1 June 2008 |work=The Observer }}&lt;/ref&gt; He presents psychosis as "a psychedelic voyage of discovery in which the boundaries of perception were widened, and consciousness expanded".&lt;ref name=tb /&gt;

While accepting in principle that “There is no need to idealize someone just because he is labelled 'out of formation'”&lt;ref&gt;R. D. Laing, ''The Politics of Experience and The Bird of Paradise'' (1984) p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; (or mad), Laing tended to confirm a view of the mad as explorers of the inner world.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jenny Diski]], ''The Sixties'' (2009)  p. 127-9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
''The Politics of Experience'' is Laing's best-known book,&lt;ref name=well/&gt; its literary influence being especially apparent in [[Doris Lessing]]'s novel, ''Briefing for a Descent into Hell'' (1971).&lt;ref&gt;Harold Bloom, ''Doris Lessing'' (2003) p. 230&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7776">The '''Rockefeller Foundation Economic Council on Planetary Health''' at the Oxford Martin School was established on 1 June 2017 to further define the new discipline of [[planetary health]]. Its mandate is to explore the economic link between human health and the earth’s natural systems on which health depends. By the end of 2019, it must recommend actionable public policy on this link.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.planetaryhealth.ox.ac.uk/about/|title=About the Rockefeller Foundation Economic Council on Planetary Health at the Oxford Martin School|last=|first=|date=October 12, 2017|website=The Rockelller Foundation-Martin Oxford School|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Council, made up of world leaders from government, international organizations, civil society, business, finance and academia, will meet several times throughout the 18 months of its mandate to develop specific recommendations and a decision-making framework that balances economic development with ecosystem protection, while promoting human health and well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.planetaryhealth.ox.ac.uk/about/|title=Rockefeller Foundation Economic Council on Planetary Health at the Oxford Martin School|last=Zedillo|first=Ernesto|date=October 12, 2017|website=Rockefller Foundation-Martin Oxford School|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Council is hosted at the [[Oxford Martin School]] at the [[University of Oxford]].

== Background ==
The [[Rockefeller Foundation]] is a private foundation, with a stated mission of "promoting the well-being of humanity throughout the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/our-work/|title=Our Work|last=|first=|date=October 12, 2017|website=The Rockefeller Foundation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Oxford Martin School]] is a research and policy unit based in the Social Sciences Division of the University of Oxford. Together, they have joined forces to build the new and emerging field of [[planetary health]]. Planetary health examines "the relationship between human health and the natural systems on which it depends."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=November 2015|title=Safeguarding human health in the Anthropocene epoch: report of The Rockefeller Foundation–Lancet Commission on planetary health|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(15)60901-1/fulltext|journal=The Lancet|volume=386|pages=1973–2028|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scientific case for a planetary health approach was established in a July 2015 report in [[The Lancet]], “[http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(15)60901-1/fulltext Safeguarding human health in the Anthropocene epoch],” wherein the Rockefeller Foundation-Lancet Commission on planetary health detailed the ways in which the degradation of natural systems harms the health of individuals, families and communities around the world. The report made several recommendations for how to do this, including having integrated social, economic and environmental policies, and better governance.

The role of the Economic Council on Planetary Health will be to provide advice and recommendations for how to reach these goals. The Council will meet several times a year to explore the economic link between human health and environmental change; increase existing scientific planetary health evidence by providing leaders and policy-makers with economic data for protecting human health through the preservation of the earth’s natural systems; and recommend the necessary economic policy reforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.planetaryhealth.ox.ac.uk/planetary-health/|title=The Rockefeller Foundation Economic Council on Planetary Health|last=|first=|date=October 12, 2017|website=Rockefeller Foundation-Oxford Martin School|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of 2019, the Council is expected to produce a report that will recommend actionable public policy for governments and institutions on advancing planetary health.

The Rockefeller Foundation will provide $15 million toward establishing the pillars of a new planetary health discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/blog/planetary-health-a-new-discipline-in-global-health/|title=Planetary Health: A New Discipline in Global Health|last=Rodin|first=Judith|date=October 16, 2017|website=The Rockefeller Foundation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other organizations are also contributing to the emerging field, including the [https://planetaryhealthalliance.org/ Planetary Health Alliance] (PHA).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/press-releases/planetary-health-alliance-launched-to-address-public-health-threats/|title=Harvard University, Wildlife Conservation Society launch new ‘Planetary Health Alliance’ with support from The Rockefeller Foundation|last=|first=|date=December 11, 2015|website=Harvard School of Public Health|archive-url=|archivedate=|dead-url=|accessdate=October 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Topeka State Hospital''' (formerly the '''Topeka Insane Asylum''') was a publicly funded institution for the care and treatment of the mentally ill in [[Topeka, Kansas]], in operation from 1872 to 1997. Located at 2700 W 6th Street, the hospital opened in 1879, after the [[Osawatomie State Hospital]], once thought to be sufficient, became overcrowded with mentally-ill patients.

The first buildings in both Topeka and Osawatomie were designed by [[John G. Haskell]] who was among the architects of the [[Kansas State Capitol]], and the hospital was designed in according to the [[Kirkbride Plan]].

As of 2010, the majority of the hospital had been demolished, and in June of that year, the center building was also demolished. Hummer Sports Park now occupies its space.

==History==
===Patient treatment===
In the early 1900s, there were rumors of patients being abused, neglected, or raped.&lt;ref name=hall&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cjonline.com/stories/011700/com_tshlegacy17.shtml#.WcnmDEyZPu0|work=The Topeka Capital-Journal|title=Topeka State leaves mixed legacy|date=January 17, 2000|accessdate=August 20, 2017|author=Hall, Mike}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patients were often left confined or chained for long periods of time.&lt;ref name=hall/&gt; In the 1940s, reforms at the hospital changed conditions for the better.&lt;ref name=hall/&gt; The hospital received further criticism for treatment of patients when, in 1951, it was discovered that patient John Crabb, a fifty-nine-year-old immigrant from [[Denmark]], was in fact not clinically insane, and had been wrongfully incarcerated at the hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=April 22, 1951|work=Chicago Times|page=7|title=Kansas Solves the Problem of Treating Mentally Ill|author=Browning, Norma Lee|via=archives.chicagotribune.com}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Forced sterilizations===
In 1913, the Kansas legislature passed the first [[Compulsory sterilization|sterilization law]] in the state.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}  Many felt that the law was problematic, and thus its enforcement was less than stellar.  In an attempt to make the process of the law easier, a second law was passed in 1917, which eliminated some of the work for the institutions. The 1913 law was directed at “habitual criminals, idiots, epileptics, imbeciles, and insane”.  The 1917 law targeted the same groups, but eliminated the courts’ approval from the decision.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

After the passage of the sterilization law in 1913, 54 sterilizations occurred over the next seven years.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}   Because there was still a great deal of doubt and uncertainty regarding the laws, sterilizations occurred at a relatively slow rate up until 1921. However, with the passage of new laws and a new widespread acceptance, sterilizations began to increase rapidly until 1950.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}  The rate of sterilization decreased steadily until 1961, when they ceased altogether. The rate of sterilizations per 100,000 residents per year during the peak period of sterilizations, in the mid 1930s, was about 10. At least early on, most of Kansas' forced sterilizations took place in the State Hospital in Topeka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uvm.edu/~lkaelber/eugenics/KS/KS.html|title=Kansas Eugenics|publisher=[[University of Vermont]]|accessdate=September 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Murder of Stephanie Uhlrig ===
Stephanie Uhlrig worked as a music and activity therapist in the general hospital population. One of the patients at Topeka State Hospital was Kenneth D. Waddell, who had been placed in the custody of state mental health authorities after having been found not guilty by reason of insanity for the charge of aggravated battery. Waddell was initially placed in the Larned State Security Hospital, but on April 1, 1987, he was transferred to the Topeka State Hospital where he was placed in the Adult Forensic Ward (referred to as the "AWL unit"), which was a special unit secluded from the other units because it contained higher risk patients. This unit was closed due to budgetary constraints, and Waddell was eventually moved into the general population.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

On February 23, 1992, Uhlrig and another therapist took Waddell and other patients off grounds to watch a movie. Upon returning to the hospital and dropping off the other patients, Waddell attacked and killed Uhlrig, and her body was found in the bathroom in one of the buildings on the grounds. 

[[United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit|The United States Court of Appeals, Tenth Circuit]], decided on Aug. 30, 1995 that "While Uhlrig's murder was undeniably tragic, it was not the result of reckless and "conscience shocking" conduct by the state mental health administrators sued in the instant case," thus affirming the district court's grant of Defendants' motion for summary judgment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/64/567/631313/|title= Uhlrig v. Topeka State Hospital|work=State of Kansas|via=Justia|accessdate=September 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Turnbull v. Topeka State Hospital and the State of Kansas ===
In 2001, Cynthia Turnbull, a psychologist at the Topeka State Hospital, sued her employer and the state for sexual harassment after she was sexually assaulted by a patient. The jury found a sexually [[hostile work environment]] existed at TSH, but it split over whether TSH should be held legally responsible for that environment.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}  After learning of the jury's inability to decide, the district court granted an earlier defense motion for judgment as a matter of law. The sole issue on appeal was whether that ruling was proper. They held that it was not, and remanded the case for further proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/255/1238/478223/|work=State of Kansas|via=Justia|title=Cynthia Turnbull, Plaintiff-appellant, v. Topeka State Hospital and the State of Kansas, Defendants-appellees, 255 F.3d 1238 (10th Cir. 2001)|accessdate=September 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Closure ===
In 1988, the hospital lost its accreditation to receive federal [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Medicaid]] payments. The [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services|Health Care Financing Administration]] determined that the State had omitted two patients from its inspection of care review at the hospital, which appealed and lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ftp.resource.org/courts.gov/juris/j1776_13.sgml|author=Ford, Cecelia Sparks|title=Kansas Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services; Docket No 88-131|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008011028/http://ftp.resource.org/courts.gov/juris/j1776_13.sgml|archivedate=October 8, 2011|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

By the 1990s, the mental health movement was away from the hospital model and toward [[Community mental health service|community-based programs]]. Partly because the community-based model appeared effective but mostly because it was cheaper,{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}  the Kansas Legislature decided to close one of its three mental hospitals. TSH was chosen for closing and went out of business May 17, 1997.

The historic center building and several others were demolished in June 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cjonline.com/news/local/2010-06-01/center_building_demolition_begins|title=Center Building demolition begins|date=June 2, 2010|accessdate=September 26, 2017|author=Bush, Ann Marie|work=The Topeka Capital-Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cemetery==

The cemetery occupies a 2.8-acre plot on the northeast corner of the old Topeka State Hospital grounds; it contains the bodies of patients buried there over a 75-year period. The cemetery, which measures about 150 yards by 50 yards and is about 100 yards west of the 100 block of N.W. MacVicar, was assigned to the Kansas Department of Administration after the hospital closed. 
Of the 1,157 graves there, only 16 have headstones. The 2000 Kansas Legislature authorized construction of a memorial for people buried in the cemetery, including a plaque identifying the memorial, fencing to go around the cemetery and the inscription of the names of the dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cjonline.com/stories/093001/com_tshcemetery.shtml |title=Memorial for TSH cemetery needs funding|author=Fry, Steve|work= The Topeka Capital-Journal|date=September 30, 2001|accessdate=September 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11291">'''Transitional care''' refers to the coordination and continuity of [[health care]] during a movement from one healthcare setting to either another or to home, called '''care transition''', between health care practitioners and settings as their condition and care needs change during the course of a chronic or acute illness. Older adults who suffer from a variety of health conditions often need [[health care]] services in different settings to meet their many needs. For young people the focus is on moving successfully from child to adult health services. 

A recent position statement from the [[American Geriatrics Society]] defines transitional care as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americangeriatrics.org/products/positionpapers/complex_care.shtml The American Geriatrics Society - Position Statements - Index&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202011119/http://www.americangeriatrics.org/products/positionpapers/complex_care.shtml |date=2007-02-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For the purpose of this position statement, transitional care is defined as a set of actions designed to ensure the coordination and continuity of health care as patients transfer between different locations or different levels of care within the same location. Representative locations include (but are not limited to) [[hospital]]s, sub-acute and post-acute [[nursing home]]s, the patient’s home, primary and specialty care offices, and [[long-term care]] facilities. Transitional care is based on a comprehensive plan of care and the availability of health care practitioners who are well-trained in chronic care and have current information about the patient’s goals, preferences, and clinical status. It includes logistical arrangements, education of the patient and family, and coordination among the health professionals involved in the transition. Transitional care, which encompasses both the sending and the receiving aspects of the transfer, is essential for persons with complex care needs.

==Defining and understanding transitional care==
During transitions, patients with complex medical needs, primarily '''older patients''', are at risk for poorer outcomes due to medication errors and other errors of communication among the involved healthcare providers and between providers and patients/family caregivers. Most research in the area of transitional care has studied the transition from hospitalization to the next provider setting – often a sub-acute nursing facility, a rehabilitation facility, or home either with or without professional homecare services. Adverse patient outcomes include continuation or recurrence of symptoms, temporary or permanent disability and death. Healthcare utilization outcomes for patients experiencing poor transitional care include returning to the emergency room or being readmitted to the hospital. As healthcare expenditures rise at an unsustainable rate there is increasing focus by patients, providers and policymakers on restraining unnecessary resource utilization such as that incurred by preventable re-hospitalizations.

Transitional care or transition care also refers to the transition of '''young people with chronic conditions''' to adult based services. Transition care is a [[Youth Health]] service. As children mature into young adults, they outgrow the expertise of children’s services (paediatrics) and need to find an adult health service that suits them. A program in Australia [http://www.health.nsw.gov.au/gmct/transition/what.html GMCT Transition Care] is an initiative aimed at improving continuity of care for young people with chronic health as they move from children's (paediatric) to adult health services.

==Continuity of health care==
[[File:LTTCH Beechwood Entrance.jpg|thumbnail|Lake Taylor Transitional Care Hospital]]
Continuity of health care (also called ''[[Continuum (theory)|continuum]] of care''&lt;ref name=Haggerty2003&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Haggerty | first1 = J. L. | last2 = Reid | first2 = R.

Canadian Health Services Research Foundation. 01/03/2002&lt;/ref&gt; Continuity of health care means different things to different types of caregivers, and can be of several types:
*[[Information continuity|Continuity of information]]. It includes that information on prior events is used to give care that is appropriate to the patient's current circumstance.&lt;ref name=chsrf2002/&gt;
*Continuity of personal relationships, recognizing that an ongoing relationship between patients and providers is the undergirding that connects care over time and bridges discontinuous events.&lt;ref name=chsrf2002/&gt;
*Continuity of clinical management.&lt;ref name=chsrf2002/&gt;
To avoid misinterpretation, the type of continuity should be agreed to before any related discussions or planning begin.&lt;ref name=chsrf2002/&gt; ''Seamless care'' refers to an optimal situation where there is continuity in the healthcare even in the presence of many transitions.&lt;ref name=Haggerty2003/&gt;

Analysis of [[medical error]]s usually reveals the presence of many gaps in health continuity, yet only rarely do gaps produce accidents.&lt;ref name=cook2000&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Cook | first1 = R. I. | last2 = Render | first2 = M. | last3 = Woods | first3 = D. | doi = 10.1136/bmj.320.7237.791 | title = Gaps in the continuity of care and progress on patient safety | journal = BMJ | volume = 320 | issue = 7237 | pages = 791–794 | year = 2000 | pmid =  10720370| pmc =1117777 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Patient safety]] is increased by understanding and reinforcing [[health care provider]]s' normal ability to bridge gaps.&lt;ref name=cook2000/&gt;

==Measuring quality of transitional care==

===Care Transitions Measure===
The only currently nationally endorsed measure of transitional care quality is the Care Transitions Measure (CTM), which is a 15-item survey for administration to patients after discharge from the hospital.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caretransitions.org/measures.asp Care Transitions Project, Health Care Policy and Research, Measures&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020154039/http://caretransitions.org/measures.asp |date=2007-10-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The measure also exists as a 3-item survey. Patient responses to the survey predicts return to the emergency department and/or hospital. Dr. Eric Coleman and his team at the [[University of Colorado at Denver and Health Sciences Center]] developed the CTM, as well as an intervention designed to improve patient outcomes during transitions.

==Improving quality of transitional care==
After leaving a particular care setting, older patients may not understand how to manage their health care conditions or whom to call if they have a question or if their condition gets worse. Poorly managed transitions can lead to physical and emotional stress for both patients and their caregivers. During a transition, the patients' preferences or personal goals in one setting may not be passed on to the next setting. This may result in important elements of the care plan "falling through the cracks".&lt;ref&gt;({{cite journal

)&lt;/ref&gt;

Ideally, every patient's [[primary physician]] would be responsible for the patient through every health care process at all times, but this has been regarded as practically impossible, and, in reality, more effort must rather be put into making transitions more effective.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/740856?src=mp&amp;spon=25 Continuity of Care Starts With You] By Gregory J. Warth at Medscape. 04/21/2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Care Transitions Intervention===
The Care Transitions Intervention (CTI)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfmc.org/providers/providers_pcc.htm Patient-Centered Care&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; is a coaching intervention to assist patients in resuming self-care following a change in health status. It uses coaching techniques to ensure that patients are comfortable in managing their own medications and their own health information, understand the signs and symptoms that should lead them to contact a healthcare provider, and have assertion skills to ask important questions of providers. Although the coaching intervention occurs for the first 30 days following the transition, this approach has been shown to significantly reduce [[Hospital Readmission|hospital readmission]] as far out as six months.&lt;ref&gt;Please visit www.caretransitions.org for additional information.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the [[University of Colorado Denver]] implemented a program called Care Transitions Intervention®. As part of the program, a Transitions Coach works directly with patients and family members for 30 days after discharge to help them understand and manage their complex postdischarge needs, ensuring continuity of care across settings. Participants in the program have a 20 to 40 percent lower hospital readmission rate at 30, 90, and 180 days postdischarge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality |url=https://innovations.ahrq.gov/profiles/transition-coaches-reduce-readmissions-medicare-patients-complex-postdischarge-needs |title=Transition Coaches Reduce Readmissions for Medicare Patients With Complex Postdischarge Needs |date=2013-04-10 |accessdate=2013-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Turfing==

'''Virtual rehabilitation''' is a concept in psychology in which a therapeutic patient's training is based entirely on, or is augmented by, [[virtual reality]] simulation exercises. If there is no conventional therapy provided, the rehabilitation is said to be "virtual reality-based." Otherwise, if virtual rehabilitation is in addition to conventional therapy, the intervention is "virtual reality-augmented." Today, a majority of the population uses the virtual environment to navigate their daily lives and almost one fourth of the world population uses the internet.  As a result, virtual rehabilitation and [[gaming rehabilitation]], or rehabilitation through gaming consoles, have become quite common. In fact, virtual therapy has been used over regular therapeutic methods in order to treat a number of disorders. 

The term Virtual Rehabilitation was coined in 2002 by Professor [[Daniel Thalmann]] of EPFL (Switzerland) and Professor Grigore Burdea of [[Rutgers University]] (USA). In their view the term applies to both [[physical therapy]] and [[Cognitive Interventions|cognitive interventions]] (such as for patients suffering from [[Post-traumatic stress disorder|Post Traumatic Stress]] Disorder, phobias, anxieties, attention deficits or [[amnesia]]). Since 2008, the virtual rehabilitation "community" has been supported by the International Society on Virtual Rehabilitation &lt;ref&gt;International Society on Virtual Rehabilitation website: http://www.isvr.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

Virtual rehabilitation offers a number of advantages&lt;ref&gt;Burdea G. “Keynote Address: Virtual Rehabilitation-Benefits and Challenges,” ''1st International Workshop on Virtual Reality Rehabilitation (Mental Health, Neurological, Physical, Vocational) VRMHR 2002'' Lausanne, Switzerland, November 7 and 8, pp. 1-11, 2002. Reprinted in the 2003 ''International Medical Informatics Association Yearbook of Medical Informatics'', Heidelberg, Germany, pp. 170-176 and in Journal of Methods of Information in Medicine, Schattauer, German, (invited), pp. 519-523, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; compared to conventional therapeutic methods:
* It is entertaining, thus motivating the patient;
* It provides objective outcome measures of therapy efficacy (limb velocity, range of movement, error rates, game scores, etc.);
* These data are transparently stored by the computer running the simulation and can be made available on the Internet. 
* Thus virtual rehabilitation can be performed in the patient's home and monitored at a distance (becoming ''telerehabilitation'')
* The client feels more actively involved in the desensitization
Factors to consider:
* cultural sensitivity
* financing virtual therapy
* accessibility

'''Water supply and sanitation in China''' is undergoing a massive transition while facing numerous challenges such as rapid urbanization, increasing [[economic inequality]], and the supply of water to rural areas. [[Water resources of China|Water scarcity]] and [[Water resources of China|pollution]] also impact access to water.&lt;ref name="Chinatocleanuppollutedlake"&gt;BBC News. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/7065095.stm China to clean up polluted lake]. 27 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Water Scarcity in China"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/7d6f69ea-bc73-11e2-b344-00144feab7de.html#axzz2TMae0Kjs | title=China: High and dry: Water shortages put a brake on economic growth | publisher=Financial Times | date=May 14, 2013 | accessdate=2013-05-15 | author=Hook, Leslie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Progress has been made in the past decades, with increased access to services, increased municipal [[wastewater treatment]], the creation of water and wastewater utilities that are legally and financially separated from local governments, and increasing cost recovery as part of the transformation of the [[Economy of China|Chinese economy]] to a more market-oriented system. The government quadrupled investments in the sector during the [[Eleventh Five-Year Plan (People's Republic of China)|Eleventh Five-Year Plan]] (2006–10).

Nevertheless, much remains to be achieved.&lt;ref name="Water Scarcity in China"/&gt; According to survey data analyzed by the Joint Monitoring Program for Water and Sanitation of [[WHO]] and [[UNICEF]], about 100 million Chinese still did not have access to an [[improved water source]] in 2008, and about 460 million did not have access to [[improved sanitation]]. Progress in rural areas appears to lag behind what has been achieved in urban areas.&lt;ref name="Water Scarcity in China"/&gt; According to data presented by the [[Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation|Joint Monitoring Program for Water Supply and Sanitation]] of WHO and UNICEF in 2015, about 36% of the rural population in [[China]] still did not have access to improved [[sanitation]].&lt;ref name="JMP2015"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://washdata.org/sites/default/files/documents/reports/2017-06/JMP-2015-Report.pdf|title=Progress on sanitation and drinking water – 2015 update and MDG assessment|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=JMP (WHO and UNICEF)|format=PDF|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=14 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Access ==

Access to water supply and sanitation has increased significantly in [[China]] over the past two decades in parallel with economic growth. The number of people lacking access to "at least basic" water in 2015 was 63 million. The term "at least basic water" is a new term since 2016, and is related to the previously used "[[improved water source]]".

Regarding sanitation, progress has been slower and there are still 329 million people without access to "at least [[basic sanitation]]", in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washwatch.org/en/countries/china/summary/statistics/|title=China|last=|first=|date=|website=WASHWatch|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=21 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;WHO/UNICEF (2015) [https://www.wssinfo.org/documents/ Progress on sanitation and drinking water - 2015 update and MDG assessment], Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation&lt;/ref&gt;  Between 1990 and 2008 alone more than 450 million Chinese gained access to an improved water source, based on estimates by the [[Joint Monitoring Program for Water Supply and Sanitation]] of the [[WHO]] and [[UNICEF]] that are based on household survey data.

In earlier years, access to an improved water source was 89% and access to improved sanitation was 55% in 2008. Having access to an improved water source, however, is not the same as having access to safe water. Many of those who have access to adequate infrastructure suffer from poor water quality due to fecal contamination; high levels of naturally occurring fluoride, arsenic, or salts; and growing industrial and agricultural chemical pollution. Furthermore, seasonal water shortages occur.&lt;ref name="WB Rural"&gt;[http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1999/09/14/000094946_99052708473642/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf World Bank: Fourth Rural Water Supply And Sanitation Project, Project Appraisal Document, 1999, p. 3-5] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225180933/http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1999/09/14/000094946_99052708473642/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf |date=February 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As in many other developing countries, there is a significant gap between urban and rural areas. For example, in 2010, in urban areas of China 95% had access to piped water supply, while the share in rural areas was only 45%.&lt;ref name="JMP"&gt;[[Joint Monitoring Program for Water Supply and Sanitation]]:[http://www.wssinfo.org/download?id_document=928 Estimates for the use of Improved Sanitation Facilities, updated March 2010, China] and [http://www.wssinfo.org/download?id_document=929 Estimates for the use of Improved Water Facilities, updated March 2010, China]&lt;/ref&gt;

The magazine ''[[The Economist]]'' described the urban-rural gap in the following stark terms: "The reforms that [[Deng Xiaoping]] first launched in China's countryside 30 years ago have now left its peasants in the ditch." It also observed that "the income disparity between China's richest few and poorest many would make many a modern capitalist blush." &lt;ref&gt;"China, beware", The Economist, October 13–19, 2007, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

== Service quality ==

=== Water supply ===
According to the World Bank about 13% of urban water users receive water at inadequate pressure. Furthermore, 60% of China's 661 cities face seasonal water shortage, and over 100 cities have severe water  constraints.&lt;ref name="World Bank 2007, p. xx"/&gt; Contamination of drinking water from [[feces]] is a critical health problem in China, as in other developing countries, that causes serious illnesses such as [[diarrhea]] and viral [[hepatitis]].  A recent survey by [[UNICEF]] in 11 provinces found that over half of all drinking water samples contained unacceptably high levels of bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;[[UNICEF]]:[http://www.unicef.org/china/environment_sanitation.html China:Child’s environment &amp; sanitation], without date. Retrieved April 17, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, China is facing a shortage of water due to climate and rapid development.&lt;ref name="Water Scarcity in China"/&gt; in 2013, China "for the first time issued water quotas to every province, setting targets for annual consumption by 2015".&lt;ref name="Water Scarcity in China"/&gt;

=== Wastewater treatment ===
It has been estimated that in 2006 there was sufficient capacity to treat 52% of municipal residential wastewater.&lt;ref name="World Bank 2007, p. xvii"/&gt; By June 2010, there were 1,519 municipal wastewater treatment plants in China and 18 plants were added each week.&lt;ref&gt;Global Water Intelligence:"New directions in Chinese wastewater", October 2010, p. 22, quoting the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development&lt;/ref&gt; Many existing plants are being expanded and upgraded to include a tertiary treatment stage for nutrient removal to comply with more stringent discharge standards introduced in 2002. In terms of technologies, in 2007, the most commonly used technologies were various forms of [[activated sludge]], including oxidation ditches (24% of all plants), [[sequencing batch reactor]]s (11%), conventional activated sludge (5%) and [[membrane bioreactor]]s. In small communities, plants using only primary treatment were still common (15% of all plants).&lt;ref&gt;Ministry of Environmental Protection:Statistical Report on the Environment in China for 2006, Beijing, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; An analysis in 2004 by the Ministry of Construction showed that, according to treatment plant records, most plants operated in compliance with discharge standards.&lt;ref&gt;[[World Bank]]:[http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2007/09/25/000310607_20070925111156/Rendered/PDF/409640P0704130Public.pdf Stepping up - Improving the performance of China's urban water utilities], by Greg Browder et al., 2007, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

== Links to water resources ==
{{Main|Water resources of China}}
Man-made [[water pollution|pollution]], natural contamination, and [[water scarcity]] all affect the provision of drinking water.&lt;ref name="Chinatocleanuppollutedlake" /&gt;

== Links to poverty, health, and hygiene ==
Health problems caused by the lack of safe water are exacerbated by poor sanitary conditions, especially in rural China. Traditionally, Chinese households collect human waste and transport it to the fields for use as fertilizer, often without further treatment. [[Latrine]]s are common in rural areas. Some are rudimentary, being unprotected from flies and other disease [[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]], while others are odorless and insect-free. [[Composting toilet]]s that promise high rates of [[pathogen]] destruction are common. The availability of public and school latrines in rural areas that met sanitary standards was low in the late 1990s.&lt;ref name="WB Rural"/&gt;
The government has made a concerted effort to promote good health-related behaviors. In most rural areas, a network of [[National Patriotic Health Campaign Committee]] (NPHCC) workers, the [[All-China Women's Federation]] representatives, the [[Communist Youth League of China]], local epidemic prevention stations, and schools have led [[health education]] campaigns encouraging a wide array of [[Hygiene|hygienic behaviors]]. That work, combined with a high literacy rate (even in poor areas), has led to widespread knowledge of many basic health behaviors, such as the importance of drinking boiled water. However, actual behavioral change has been slow to follow, especially in poor areas where fuel may be scarce and understanding of the link between raw water or unwashed hands and [[diarrhea]] is tenuous. Thus, the problem is more one of the effectiveness of health messages than of their dissemination: In the late 1990s, health education in most rural areas provided little concrete information to link hygienic behavior to improved health, and most provinces still lacked specialized health education training. As a result, significant disparities exist between poorer and wealthier rural counties, both among and within provinces in China. While a number of wealthier and middle-income rural counties have experienced tremendous health-related benefits as a result of improvements in water supply and sanitation, poorer counties with more limited resources have yet to receive similar benefits.&lt;ref name="WB Rural"/&gt; In [[Minqin]] county, [[Inner Mongolia]], "10,000 people have left the area and have become ''shengtai yimin'', “ecological migrants".&lt;ref name="Water Scarcity in China"/&gt;

== Responsibility for water supply and sanitation ==
Responsibility for water supply and sanitation policies at the national level is shared between five Ministries. Provincial governments play a relatively limited role in the water sector, providing some limited financing for rural water supply. Local government plays a major role, providing a substantial share of financing and owning water supply and sanitation companies that are the main service providers in urban areas. In smaller towns, local government sometimes provides services directly. Village committees operate water systems in rural areas.

To a large extent, the institutional structure of the sector has been inherited from the period of the planned economy before 1978. There are overlaps in responsibilities between public institutions at the central and local level, as well as between various Ministries. There are also no clear definitions of what terms like "supervision" and "management" that are mentioned in the legislation mean, so that "often the departments in charge cannot tell the differences themselves".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Deng | first1 = Yixiang | last2 = Brombal | first2 = Daniele | last3 = Farah | first3 = Paolo Davide | last4 = Moriggi | first4 = Angela | last5 = Critto | first5 = Andrea | last6 = Zhou | first6 = Yun | last7 = Marcomini | first7 = Antonio | year = 2016 | title = China's Water Environmental Management Towards Institutional Integration.

Public Policy and Management, Earthscan, London, 2009, p. 311&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Policy and legal framework ===
The national government does not have a single policy document for water supply and sanitation. The two major laws in the water sector relate to water resources management: the Water Law of 2002&lt;ref&gt;Government of China:[http://www.gov.cn/english/laws/2005-10/09/content_75313.htm Water Law of the People's Republic of China (Order of the President No.74)]. Retrieved April 17, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Water Pollution Prevention and Control Law of 1984.

The legal framework for water supply and sanitation at the national level is constituted by secondary legislation, of which the 1994 regulation of urban water supply, the 1996 administrative measures for the sanitary supervision of drinking water and the 2006 sanitary standards for drinking water are among the most important ones. It is complemented by numerous local regulations and administrative measures.

==== Water supply and sanitation ====

It is the government’s policy to fully recover costs for water supply and sanitation through user fees, and that water tariffs should be volumetric.&lt;ref name="lnweb18.worldbank.org"&gt;[http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWRD/Resources/ChinaCountryWaterResourcesAssistanceStrategy.pdf World Bank Country Water Resources Assistance Strategy 2002, p. 13]&lt;/ref&gt; The Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development (until 2008 the Ministry of Construction) oversees financing for ''urban'' water and sanitation infrastructure as well as policies concerning the regulation of water and sanitation utilities. Some important policy papers it has issued are “Accelerating the Marketization of Public Utilities” (No.272 Policy Paper of the MOC, 2002), the “Measure on Public Utilities Concession Management” (No.126 Policy Paper of the MOC, 2004), and the “Opinions on Strengthening Regulation of Public Utilities” (No.154 Policy Paper of the MOC, 2005). However, there is no law concerning the regulation of public utilities or private sector participation in the sector.&lt;ref name="Asian Development Bank"&gt;[[Asian Development Bank]]:[http://www.adb.org/water/actions/prc/private-funds.asp Country Water Action: People's Republic of China. Private Funds for Cleaner Water — BOT Applied in the Chinese Wastewater Sector], February 2007. Retrieved April 17, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ministry of Health has attributions related to the promotion of rural water supply and sanitation.

==== Water resources management ====

The responsibility for water resources management is split between a number of entities at the national and local level. At the national level
* the [[Ministry of Water Resources of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Water Resources]] is responsible for surface water management, with a focus on quantitative aspects,
* the [[Ministry of Environmental Protection of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Environmental Protection]] (formerly the State Environmental Protection Agency, SEPA) has the responsibility to manage the quality of water resources, and
* groundwater falls within the realm of the Ministry of Land and Resources.&lt;ref&gt;Ma Xiangcong:[http://www.chinadialogue.net/article/show/single/en/789-China-s-environmental-governance China's environmental governance], February 21, 2007, [http://www.chinadialogue.net/static/about China Dialogue].

Nevertheless, the Ministry of Water Resources and its affiliated river basin commissions in all major river basins are key players in water resources management. The Water Law of 2002 emphasizes demand management and water quality protection and thus paves the way for a transition from a development phase focused almost exclusively on infrastructure development to a phase where more appropriate attention is being devoted to the management and protection of water resources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lboro.ac.uk/well/resources/Publications/China%20Briefing%20Notes/No%201%20-%20Briefing%20Note%20Series.pdf China Briefing p. 1.3.] The law is posted at: [http://www.mwr.gov.cn/english1/laws/water_law.pdf Water Law] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607025532/http://www.lboro.ac.uk/well/resources/Publications/China%20Briefing%20Notes/No%201%20-%20Briefing%20Note%20Series.pdf |date=June 7, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to water resources management, the Ministry of Water Resources is also in charge of the construction of some major water infrastructure such as dams, embankments, irrigation infrastructure, and bulk conveyors for municipal and industrial water supply. According to its website, it is also responsible for the “provision of recommendations on economic regulation of water pricing, taxation, credit and financial affairs” as well as “coordination of capital construction of (…) water supply for townships and villages”, although in practice these functions seem to be carried out by other entities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mwr.gov.cn/english1/about.asp Ministry of Water Resources] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070301021559/http://www.mwr.gov.cn/english1/about.asp |date=March 1, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Service provision ===

In order to understand the institutional responsibilities for water supply and sanitation in China, it may be helpful to provide a brief overview of the administrative divisions of China:

*33 province-level (省级 shěngjí) divisions, including 22 [[Province of China|provinces]], five [[Autonomous region of China|autonomous regions]], four [[Municipality of China|municipalities]] ([[Beijing]], [[Shanghai]], [[Tianjin]], and [[Chongqing]]), and two [[Special administrative regions of China|special administrative regions]].
*333 [[Prefecture-level city|prefecture-level divisions]] (地级 dìjí)
*2872 [[County-level city|county-level divisions]] (县级 xiànjí) (sometimes called "districts")
*41,636 township-level (乡级 xiāngjí) divisions

For details: [[Administrative divisions of China]]

China also has 661 designated cities, which do not constitute separate administrative units. Each municipality, prefecture, and county includes urban and rural areas. 4 cities are capitals of [[Municipality of China|municipalities]], 283 cities are capitals of [[Prefecture-level city|prefectures]], and 374 are capitals of [[County-level city|counties]]. In 2005, 340 million people, or about 25% of China's population, lived in designated cities, each of which had a population of at least 200,000. The remaining urban population of about 200 million, or about 15% of the total population, lives in smaller towns that are either among the smaller prefecture-level capitals (96 million) that are not formally designated as cities or in townships (100 million).

In an article on rural China, ''[[The Economist]]'' magazine wrote that many Chinese experts believe that basic infrastructure should be funded by provinces or the central government: "That done, prefecture and township governments could be massively trimmed or eliminated altogether."&lt;ref&gt;"Missing the barefoot doctors", The Economist, October 13th 2007, p. 30. Counties are not specifically mentioned.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Urban areas ====
[[File:20090426 Shanghai 5243.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Shanghai, like many other Chinese cities, depends on surface water that is heavily polluted, such as the [[Huangpu River]] shown here whose water comes through [[Suzhou Creek]] from the heavily polluted [[Lake Tai]].]]

'''Overview''' Urban water supply in China is the responsibility of "cities" under complex arrangements that differ substantially from one city to the other. The term "City" has a dual and confusing meaning in China. It is used here to refer to the main urban area of a municipality, prefecture, or county. Cities are governed by a "leading group" under the leadership of a mayor, who is assisted by various "bureaus", or departments. Services are usually provided by municipally owned water bureaus  and wastewater bureaus (sometimes referred to as [[Public utility|utilities]] despite the relatively limited autonomy that these companies enjoy). Water and wastewater bureaus are typically separate from each other. In larger cities, services are further unbundled: There may be a separate raw water bureau that transports water from far-away sources and sells it to the municipal water bureau for distribution. Likewise on the wastewater side, larger cities may have several district drainage bureaus in charge of parts of the city, a wastewater bureau in charge of the main collectors, and a third bureau in charge of wastewater treatment.&lt;ref name="World Bank 2007 p.70-72"&gt;[[World Bank]]:[http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2007/09/25/000310607_20070925111156/Rendered/PDF/409640P0704130Public.pdf Stepping up - Improving the performance of China's urban water utilities], by Greg Browder et al., 2007, p. 70-72&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cities, the various companies are under the same "parent bureau", which may be the construction bureau or a water bureau, while in other cities the water bureau and the wastewater bureau report to different parent bureaus.&lt;ref name="World Bank 2007 p.70-72"/&gt; Especially in smaller cities the county administration provides services directly.

'''Examples''' In [[Shanghai]], the Water Division of the Shanghai Urban Construction Investment Development Corporation provides services. The Water Division includes a raw water bureau, five water bureaus, one sewage management bureau, three engineering bureaus and two construction bureaus. It serves 12 million people. In Beijing, a Water parent bureau was established in 2004, integrating the functions of formerly separate bureaus for water supply, sewerage, wastewater treatment, and water resources management.&lt;ref name=Wang&gt;{{cite web|last=Wang|first=Zhenyu|title=Urban Water Sanitation in China|url=http://www.pecc.org/resources/doc_view/1133-urban-water-sanitation-in-china|publisher=China National Committee for Pacific Economic Cooperation|accessdate=15 December 2012|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Tianjin]], the Tianjin Water Supply Group provides services. It recently divested itself from numerous side businesses to focus on its core business. Since 1997, it has cooperated with international companies such as [[Vivendi]] in a bulk water supply [[Build-Operate-Transfer]] (BOT) contract.

==== Private sector participation ====

Private sector participation in financing infrastructure and managing services is widespread. In 2007, there are over 50 water projects and well over 100 wastewater projects in China with private sector participation.&lt;ref&gt;[[World Bank]]:[http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2007/09/25/000310607_20070925111156/Rendered/PDF/409640P0704130Public.pdf Stepping up - Improving the performance of China's urban water utilities], by Greg Browder et al., 2007, p. xxxi&lt;/ref&gt; The French firm Veolia alone has contracts that involve a total population of over 43 million inhabitants of whom over 27 million are served through full service concessions, among which the concession in Shenzhen is the largest. The company holds manages 22 municipal contracts and nine industrial contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Veolia Water in China|url=http://www.veoliawater.com/about/locations/china.htm|publisher=Veolia Water|accessdate=8 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Israeli-Chinese Kardan Water International Group is also a major player in the Chinese water market. Notable Chinese companies engaged in the provision of water supply and sanitation services include the majority state-owned wastewater company [[Beijing Enterprises Water Group]] Ltd, [[China Water Affairs Group]], [[Everbright International]] (now [[Everbright Water]]), and the Beijing-based engineering and construction company Sound Global Limited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pinsent Masons Water Yearbook 2011-12|pages=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Econometrics|econometric]] study by Chinese economists on the impact of private sector participation on the performance of urban water supply in 35 major cities over the period 1998 to 2008 found that " the participation of foreign companies, but not domestic private companies, significantly improves water industry performance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hongwei Wanga, Wenqing Wub and Shilin Zhenga|title=An econometric analysis of private sector participation in China’s urban water supply|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957178711000063|accessdate=8 February 2014|doi=10.1016/j.jup.2011.01.004|volume=19|journal=Utilities Policy|pages=134–141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shenzhen concession'''. According to a study by the [[Asian Development Bank]], the city of [[Shenzhen]] is leading the reform of local water management in China. Inspired by the experience of the water utility in nearby Hong Kong, it was one of the first cities in the country that has combined all water-related government functions into one government agency in 2001. Furthermore, regulatory and operative functions were separated. In 2003, the first concession for municipal public utilities in China was bid out in Shenzhen. The 30-year concession was won by the French firm [[Veolia]] and its Chinese partner Capital Water. Together with the State Council Committee for the Regulation and Management of State owned property, which holds 55% of the shares of a newly created [[Joint Venture]] called Shenzhen Water, Veolia holds 25% and Capital Water 20% of the shares. The Joint Venture was approved at the national level by the Ministry of Commerce.&lt;ref name="Every Drop Counts"/&gt; In 2009, Shenzhen Water was the largest water supply and sanitation enterprise in the country. The wastewater treatment sector in Shenzhen has developed rapidly since the reform of 2001. The sewage treatment rate in the [[Shenzhen Special Economic Zone]] has increased from 56% during pre-integration to over 88% in 2008, ranking first among large and medium-sized cities in China. The Asian Development Bank called the Shenzhen case "a model for market-oriented reform in the urban water sector".&lt;ref name="Every Drop Counts"/&gt; In 2008 the Shenzhen Water Group had expanded and invested in 17 water projects in 7 provinces.&lt;ref&gt;Globalization Monitor: [http://www.rightsresearch.org/site/page10/page17/files/China-WaterPrivatization.ppt Privatization of Water Utilities in China – the Shenzhencase], retrieved on September 26, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The $40 million equity stake of Veolia is covered by a 15-year MIGA guarantee to protect against the risk of expropriation.&lt;ref&gt;[[MIGA]]: [http://www.miga.org/projects/index_sv.cfm?pid=659 Shenzhen Water (Group) Company Ltd.], retrieved on September 26, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

'''BOT contracts'''. The most common form of private sector participation in water supply and sanitation in China is through [[Build-Operate-Transfer]] (BOT) contracts where the private sector is in charge of large upstream or downstream infrastructure without being directly involved in serving users. Experience with BOT contracts has been mixed. For example, the local government of [[Lianjiang, Guangdong|Lianjiang]] had the 100,000 m3/day Tangshan water treatment plant built by [[SUEZ]] under a BOT contract in 1999. However, the water demand had been grossly overestimated, so that the plant lay idle while the local government had to pay for substantial minimum volumes without using them, which evidently pushed up tariffs. After lengthy negotiations, the local government finally bought back the plant in 2009.

==== Rural areas ====

In rural areas, village committees which are community-based organizations, provide services. Its members operate the systems without remuneration. In terms of rural sanitation, human excreta are systematically used as manure for fertilising crops and vegetables. In many houses, the excreta of all family members are collected in buckets over the course of five to seven days, and then taken to the field and applied raw in the crops. The practice is an age old tradition and of enormous economic value in terms of agricultural production.&lt;ref name="livelihoods.org"&gt;Kamal Kar and Petra Bongartz:
[http://www.livelihoods.org/hot_topics/CLTS/China.html Update on Some Recent Developments in Community-Led Total Sanitation], Institute of Development Studies, Sussex, England, April 2006, p. 8-12&lt;/ref&gt;

==== NGOs ====

There is little information on activities by [[NGO]]s in water supply and sanitation in China. An Association for Rural Water Supply and Sanitation provides training, information exchange, technical assistance, and undertakes research. In terms of foreign NGOs, the NGO [[Plan (aid organisation)|Plan]], for example, works in China. It is known for having introduced for the first time the concept of [[Community Led Total Sanitation]] in China in Puchang County in [[Shaanxi]] in 2005.&lt;ref name="livelihoods.org"/&gt;

=== Massive investment program for wastewater treatment ===

Over the past 20 years, China has engaged in what is possibly the largest program to build [[Sewage treatment|wastewater treatment]] plants in history. Despite the substantial achievements of this program, many challenges remain.

'''Achievements''' Until the early 1980s, there was not a single municipal wastewater treatment plant in China. In that year, the country’s first municipal wastewater treatment plant was built in the city of [[Nanjing]].&lt;ref name="Asian Development Bank"/&gt; Subsequently, China engaged in what is possibly the largest wastewater treatment investment program in history. It has been estimated that in 2006 there was sufficient capacity to treat 52% of municipal residential wastewater.&lt;ref name="World Bank 2007, p. xvii"/&gt; According to the State Environmental Protection Agency the rate of urban wastewater treatment reached 57% in that year.&lt;ref&gt;"China pays water price for progress", Water 21, Magazine of the International Water Association, August 2007, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; The government's goal to achieve a level of 60% for treatment of municipal wastewater by 2010 was surpassed.  By 2010, 77.5% of domestic waste water was treated.&lt;ref name="ebchinaintl.com"&gt;{{citation|url = http://www.ebchinaintl.com/en/investors/faq.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2001 and 2004, the number of cities that charge wastewater tariffs has increased from 300 to 475 out of 661 cities.&lt;ref&gt;M.S. Clark, C.R. Huang and S.B. Liu:[http://www.cdm.com/NR/rdonlyres/586600E8-3539-4B40-9EE4-AB3C282F7230/0/DevelopmentofNationalWastewaterTariffGuidelinesforChina.pdf Development of National Wastewater Tariff Guidelines for China, CDM, 2006, p. 1-2]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Notice on the Construction Plan for the Nation's Urban Waste Water Treatment and Recycling Facilities presented in the 12th Five-Year Plan by the General Office of the State Council, which was promulgated on May 4, 2012, the waste water treatment rate in the PRC will further improve by 2015. By the end of 2015, the waste water treatment rate should increase to 100% for municipalities, provincial capital cities and cities specifically designated in the state plan, 85% for other cities, 70% for counties, and 30% for towns.&lt;ref name="ebchinaintl.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url = http://www.gov.cn/zwgk/2012-05/04/content_2129670.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Remaining challenges''' However, in the rush to construct planning mistakes were made. Demand was overestimated, the construction of [[sanitary sewer|sewerage]] lagged behind the construction of treatment plants, designs were sometimes inappropriate, there was no requirement for pre-treatment of industrial effluents thus affecting the effectiveness of treatment processes, and the sites chosen for the first priority investments within a [[river basin]] were not always those where the highest impact could have been achieved in terms of improving river water quality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWRD/Resources/ChinaCountryWaterResourcesAssistanceStrategy.pdf World Bank Country Water Resources Assistance Strategy 2002, p. 20]&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, many plants are underutilized or poorly functioning. According to the Ministry of Construction, more than 50 wastewater treatment plants in more than 30 cities operated at only 30 percent of their capacity or did not even come into operation.&lt;ref name="Ministry of Construction"&gt;China Development Gateway: Ensuring the Safety of Urban Water Supply, Facilitating the Frugal and Appropriate Consumption of Urban Water, Ministry of Construction, August 22, 2006 [http://en.chinagate.com.cn/reports/2006-09/18/content_2448764_2.htm Ministry of Construction]&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the impact of the investment program on the water quality in rivers and coastal waters has been limited.

During the 1990s, municipal and industrial water use actually declined because of low increases of connection rates to utilities because of underestimation of the importance of small-scale water providers,&lt;ref name="Chengdu Water Supply City Profile"&gt;[[Asian Development Bank]]:[http://www.adb.org/Water/Indicators/Profiles/Chengdu_city.pdf Chengdu Water Supply City Profile], 2001&lt;/ref&gt; increased tariffs, increased metering, industrial restructuring, measures to increase the efficiency of water use in industries, as well as due to water scarcity and drought. Many Chinese water and wastewater companies have overcapacities and are in financial difficulties because the revenues are insufficient to cover the servicing of the debt contracted to build the oversized infrastructure.&lt;ref name="lnweb18.worldbank.org"/&gt;

=== Transition to commercial utilities ===

In 2002, the Ministry of Construction issued a policy paper on the commercialization of public utilities. Subsequently, in October 2003, the central government decided that state-owned enterprises had to be separated from Ministries and/or provincial governments and had to be commercialized.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iwahq.org/uploads/conference_graphics/beijing2006/workshops/water%20sanitation%20in%20china/Chen%20Yuheng.pdf Ministry of Construction Presentation at International Water Association Conference in Beijing in 2006] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927224928/http://www.iwahq.org/uploads/conference_graphics/beijing2006/workshops/water%20sanitation%20in%20china/Chen%20Yuheng.pdf |date=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Competitive bidding for contracts, private sector participation and commercial financing are important element in the transition to a market economy. In the 1990s, the first [[Build-Operate-Transfer|BOT]] contracts were signed for wastewater treatment plants. More than 200 wastewater treatment plants were built with some form of private sector participation in their financing and/or management, usually using the BOT formula. Early BOTs saw governments implementing the process without the benefit of financial, legal, and technical advisers, finding to their chagrin that the process becomes more complex in the absence of expert knowledge. Learning from the experience of past BOTs in the sector, local governments sought expert advice on bidding and public tender.&lt;ref name="Asian Development Bank"/&gt; In about 2000 for the first time, a BOT water project ([[Chengdu]] No. 6 Water Supply Plant) was awarded on the basis of transparent international competitive bidding, with support from the [[Asian Development Bank|ADB]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adb.org/documents/speeches/2003/ms2003013.asp Asian Development Bank] For a profile of water and sanitation in Chengdu, see [http://www.adb.org/Water/Indicators/Profiles/Chengdu_city.pdf Asian Development Bank Chengdu Profile 2001]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, a landmark international competitive bid for the entire water supply and sanitation system of Shenzhen was won by a joint venture including the French firm [[Veolia]].&lt;ref name="Every Drop Counts"&gt;[[Asian Development Bank]]:[http://www.aquasafecanada.com/mirror/every-drop-counts/every-drop-counts.pdf  Every Drop Counts. Learning from good practices in eight Asian cities], 2010, retrieved on September 26, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Efficiency ==

There are many different indicators for utility efficiency. In the case of China, some indicators, such as labor productivity, suggest a low level of operational efficiency, while other indicators - such as non-revenue water - suggest a high level of operational efficiency.

'''Labor productivity''' Most water and sanitation utilities in China have a low labor productivity and are overstaffed. For example, many utilities in small towns in Henan province have more than 20 employees per 1,000 connections, while international good practice is less than 4 employees per 1,000 connections. In [[Chengdu]], the utility employed 34 employees per 1,000 connections, while in Shanghai, the ratio was less than 6 employees per 1,000 connections.&lt;ref&gt;World Bank and ADB&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Non-revenue water''' [[Non-revenue water]] (NRW) - consisting mainly leakage losses in the distribution network - are estimated by the Chinese Waterworks Association to be only 20% on average and less than 10% for the best utilities, which is very low by international standards. The International Benchmarking Network for Water and Sanitation Utilities estimated the non-revenue water for a sample of Chinese water utilities at 27% in 2006 and 21% in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ib-net.org/IBNetProduction/CountrySearch.aspx International Benchmarking Network for Water and Sanitation Utilities:China]&lt;/ref&gt;

One explanation for the relatively low level of NRW may be that most Chinese live in dense apartment complexes, which results in compact distribution systems. In some smaller cities, non-revenue water remains relatively high. For example, average non revenue water in small towns in [[Henan province]] is 38%.&lt;ref name="Henan World Bank, Annex 1"&gt;[http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2006/06/08/000090341_20060608095406/Rendered/PDF/33668.pdf Henan World Bank, Annex 1]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tariffs and cost recovery ==

Cost recovery for water and sanitation services paradoxically is lower in urban areas, while it is higher in rural areas, despite the lower incomes of rural residents.

=== Urban areas ===

'''Overview''' Many urban water and wastewater utilities in China experience financial stress, because user fees are set well below cost recovery levels and government subsidies are insufficient to cover the resulting gap. In 2004, 60% of urban water utilities reported negative net incomes. The financial situation of wastewater utilities is expected to be even more precarious. Tariffs have increased by 50% since 1998 and now stand at 1.5 RMB/m3 or US$0.20/m3. These rates are insufficient to cover costs.&lt;ref name="worldbank2007"/&gt;

Until the 1980s, urban water tariffs in China were very low and sewer tariffs were practically unknown. This has changed substantially since the adoption of National Guidelines on Urban Water Tariffs in 1988, which called for increased cost recovery and for the introduction of sewer tariffs. Subsequently, water tariffs have been increased substantially in many Chinese cities, particularly in the north where water is scarcest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWRD/Resources/ChinaCountryWaterResourcesAssistanceStrategy.pdf World Bank Country Water Resourcese Assistance Strategy 2002, p. 13]&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to the Ministry of Construction, water tariff reforms have not been effective enough to offer the necessary incentives to save water. While many cities now have sewer tariffs, in 2005, there were more than 150 cities across the country where no wastewater treatment fee was collected.&lt;ref name="Ministry of Construction"/&gt;

China has a policy of universal metering, including metering of individual households in apartment complexes, where most urban residents live. Metering in urban areas is now relatively widespread with an average of 90% connections being metered. Some cities are experimenting with pre-paid debit cards that residents must put into their meters in order to receive service.

Tariff structure are complex, with different tariffs for different categories of users and higher tariffs charged to industrial and commercial users than to residential users. Most water tariffs are linear, i.e. there is a single price per unit of water, although there are some increasing-block tariffs where the unit price increases with consumption. Urban tariffs are approved by Price Bureaus of cities, after considerable prior negotiation. Tariffs do not require approval from a higher level of government.

'''Examples''' In [[Tianjin]], where water tariffs had not been raised once between 1949 and 1985, they have been raised eight times until 2006. As a result, cost recovery has improved significantly. In [[Chengdu]] the average water tariff was US$0.14/m3 in 2001. Despite the relatively low water tariff the utility's revenues were twice as high as recurrent costs, allowing for a significant share of self-financing.&lt;ref name="Chengdu Water Supply City Profile"/&gt; In Shanghai, the average water tariff was only US$0.10/m3 in 2001. The utility did not even recover its recurrent cost and had an operating loss.&lt;ref&gt;[[Asian Development Bank]]:[http://www.adb.org/Water/Indicators/Profiles/Shanghai_city.pdf Shanghai Water Supply City Profile], 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rural areas ===

In rural areas, according to the World Bank users pay about 75% of investment costs and 100% of operation and maintenance costs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWRD/Resources/ChinaCountryWaterResourcesAssistanceStrategy.pdf World Bank World Bank Country Water Resourcese Assistance Strategy 2002, p. 20]&lt;/ref&gt; Rural tariffs do not need to be approved.

== Investment and financing ==

=== Investment level and breakdown ===

Investments in the sector have than tripled over the past years. According to the World Bank, in 1991–2005, a total of USD$54 billion was invested in urban water supply and sanitation, equivalent to only US$3.7 billion per year. During the 11th Five Year Plan in 2006–10, almost US$11 billion per year are expected to be invested in the sector, thus investing in five years as much as had been invested in the previous fifteen years. More than 60% of these investments are targeted at sanitation, reflecting the backlog in that sector.&lt;ref&gt;[[World Bank]]:[http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2007/09/25/000310607_20070925111156/Rendered/PDF/409640P0704130Public.pdf Stepping up - Improving the performance of China's urban water utilities], by Greg Browder et al., 2007, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; Figures for rural areas are not available.

=== Financing ===

Municipal governments provide their financing in the form of equity that typically is not remunerated. The other forms of financing require a remuneration either in the form of interests on loans or profits on private equity. It should be noted that local governments in China are not allowed to borrow directly. Municipally owned utility companies, however, are allowed to borrow from the [[China Development Bank]], other Chinese banks, the state bond program and international financial institutions. The State bond program is geared at less economically developed regions. The bonds are issued by the Ministry of Finance, and then distributed by the [[National Development and Reform Commission]] as long maturity, low-interest loans, which in some cases may be converted to grants. The major international financial institutions engaged in the sector are the [[World Bank]] and the [[Asian Development Bank]], complemented by bilateral donors such as the [[Japan International Cooperation Agency]] (JICA) and the German KfW.

Implicitly, according to this estimate, the level of self-financing by water and wastewater utilities is zero. Nevertheless, there clearly will be an upward pressure on tariffs, since 70-80% of water infrastructure and 50-60% of wastewater infrastructure is financed either through debt or private equity that requires a remuneration. The remainder is financed through municipal equity, which typically requires no remuneration and thus helps to keep tariffs low.

Another mechanism to use debt finance are BOTs which are a popular financing mechanism for water and wastewater treatment plants and bulk water supply systems in China. Under [[Build–operate–transfer|BOTs]], private entities undertake investments and recover their costs through fees for bulk water sale or wastewater treatment charged to the utilities. While the local government or utilities are formally not indebted through a BOT, the charges for the services are de facto similar to debt service charges.

'''Rural areas''' In terms of rural and small town infrastructure, channeling funds to the final users through the various layers of local government remains a challenge. According to the World Bank, China differs from many other developing countries in that there is not a history of the central government providing large subsidies for the financing of rural water supply and sanitation. Instead, there is greater emphasis on self-reliance with rural people using their own contributions and resources to improve their water supply. This financing structure causes poor rural areas to "accurately match their ability to pay with the proper type of systems and level of service", i.e. to choose sanitation solutions that they can afford. According to the World Bank, as a result, "China is held up as a model for other developing countries". Support for capital costs for water supply is partially provided by the local and/or provincial government.&lt;ref name="WB Rural"/&gt; Beneficiaries have to provide upfront capital contributions. Through World Bank financing and central government counterpart financing these upfront capital contributions were reduced, thus making sanitation more affordable to the poor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2007/03/7572909/china-fourth-rural-water-supply-project World Bank:Implementation Completion And Results Report.

'''Whānau Ora''' (''"family health"'') is a major contemporary indigenous health initiative in [[New Zealand]] driven by [[Māori culture|Māori cultural]] values. Its core goal is to empower communities and extended families (''whānau'') to support families within the community context rather than individuals within an institutional context.

==History and objectives==
Whānau Ora evolved out of the coalition between the [[New Zealand National Party|National]] and [[Māori Party|Māori]] parties after the [[2008 New Zealand general election|2008 general election]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10535993 |title=Q&amp;A with Tariana Turia |work=The New Zealand Herald |year=2011 |quote=Our main focus is on whanau ora – the well being of family and what it takes to make them well, healthy, independent, standing on their own two feet.  |accessdate=12 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10609211 |title=Govt showing interest in Maori-style social services|work=The New Zealand Herald |year=2011 |quote=National Party ministers appear to implicitly support Maori Party co-leader Tariana Turia's plan to bundle multiple contracts for Maori health, education, housing, justice and social services into integrated 'Whanau Ora' contracts covering the whole spectrum of services for regional groups of Maori whanau.  |accessdate=12 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became a cornerstone of the coalition agreement between them after the [[2011 New Zealand general election|2011 general election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10772529 |title=Nats and Maori Party sign  |work=The New Zealand Herald |year=2011 |quote=Developing Whanau Ora, a Ministerial Committee on Poverty and a new focus for Te Puni Kokiri are the centre-pieces of the National Party-Maori Party confidence and supply agreement. |accessdate=12 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10772673 |title=Nats-Maori deal to help poor  |work=The New Zealand Herald |year=2011 |quote=Develop a stand-alone commissioning agency for whanau ora in the next 12 months. |accessdate=12 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Te Puni Kōkiri]], (the Ministry for Māori Development), states that
:Whānau Ora is an inclusive approach to providing services and opportunities to whānau across New Zealand. It empowers whānau as a whole, rather than focusing separately on individual whānau members and their problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.tpk.govt.nz/en/in-focus/whanau-ora/ |title=Whānau Ora |work=tpk.govt.nz |year=2011 |accessdate=12 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Māori Party]] defines Whānau Ora at some length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://maoriparty.org/index.php?pag=cms&amp;id=191&amp;p=policy-2011---whanau-ora-page.html |title=Maori Party &amp;#124; Whānau Ora |publisher=maoriparty.org |year=2011 |quote=Whānau-ora: restoring the essence of who we are; putting the vibrant traditions from our people at the heart of our whānau |accessdate=12 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111118075455/http://maoriparty.org/index.php?pag=cms&amp;id=191&amp;p=policy-2011---whanau-ora-page.html |archivedate=18 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the health initiative, ''Whānau Ora'' was the name of the Māori health awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.maorihealth.govt.nz/moh.nsf/pagesma/442 |title=Whānau Ora Awards |work=maorihealth.govt.nz |year=2011 |quote=The Whānau Ora Awards promote successful models of service delivery or initiatives that increase whānau health and wellbeing by building on the strengths and assets of whānau and Māori communities. |accessdate=12 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ministerial oversight==
Between April 2010 and September 2014, the-then [[Māori Party]] co-leader [[Tariana Turia]] served as Minister for Whānau Ora.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hon Tariana Turia|url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/mps-and-electorates/former-members-of-parliament/turia-tariana/|publisher=New Zealand Parliament|accessdate=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10772664 |title=Big promotions ahead in today's Cabinet reshuffle  |work=The New Zealand Herald |year=2011 |quote= Tariana Turia as Minister Responsible for Whanau Ora, Minister for Disability Issues, Associate Minister of Health and Associate Minister of Housing. |accessdate=12 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Andrea Vance |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/opinion/8024606/Turia-personifies-Whanau-Ora-problem |title=Taria's Lack of Accountability Over Whanau Ora Personifies... |publisher=Stuff.co.nz |accessdate=2 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between September 2014 and October 2017, the portfolio for Whānau Ora was occupied by Māori Party co-leader [[Te Ururoa Flavell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hon Te Ururoa Flavell|url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/mps-and-electorates/former-members-of-parliament/flavell-te-ururoa/|publisher=[[New Zealand Parliament]]|accessdate=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the {{NZ election link|2017}}, the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour]] MP [[Peeni Henare]] assumed the position of Minister for Whānau Ora.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ministry of Māori Development|url=https://www.govt.nz/organisations/te-puni-kokiri/|publisher=Te Puni Kokiri|accessdate=11 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
The programme has been criticised for having hard to define and impossible to measure specific outputs;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://thestandard.org.nz/what-is-whanau-ora/ |title=What is Whanau Ora? " The Standard |publisher=thestandard.org.nz |year=2011 |quote=I have a sinking feeling that this is all just a scam. I fear that interjecting themselves between public service providers and the public is just a way for Turia's buddies to clip the ticket, grabbing some taxpayer dosh without delivering anything of real value to the people in need. The complete failure of anyone to show what precisely Whanau Ora is and how it will deliver a net benefit to the people it is intended for only deepens my suspicion that it is all a scam. |accessdate=12 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/3144138/Families-Commissioner-struggles-with-whanau-ora |title=Families Commissioner struggles with whanau ora  |publisher=stuff.co.nz |year=2011 |accessdate=12 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/local-papers/the-wellingtonian/3581543/Whanau-Ora-the-unanswered-questions |title=Whanau Ora: the unanswered questions  |publisher=stuff.co.nz |year=2011 |quote=OPINION: With her Whanau Ora scheme last week, Maori Party co-leader Tariana Turia unveiled a genuine magic trick. That is, a new system that will socialise and privatise the delivery of social services in this country, and do both at once.  |accessdate=12 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a disproportionate amount of funding being spent in Turia's electorate.&lt;ref name="problem" /&gt;

MP [[Winston Peters]] has been a vocal opponent of the program.&lt;ref name="problem"&gt;{{cite web|author=Kate Chapman And John Hartevelt |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/6381455/Peters-demands-apology-over-Whanau-Ora-row |title=Peters demands apology over Whanau Ora row |publisher=Stuff.co.nz |accessdate=2 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tracy Watkins |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/8004656/Whanau-Ora-overstayer-claims |title=Whanau Ora overstayer claims |publisher=Stuff.co.nz |date=27 November 2012 |accessdate=2 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The longest-established national Māori health organisation, the [[Māori Women's Welfare League]] choose not to participate in Whānau Ora, but some regional leaders are involved. The League operates a [[parenting skills]] course called ''Whanau Toko i te Ora'' which is unrelated to Whānau Ora.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/te-manu-korihi/93879/mwwl-chose-not-to-be-whanau-ora-provider |title= MWWL chose not to be Whanau Ora provider |publisher=radionz.co.nz |year=2011 |accessdate=18 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
