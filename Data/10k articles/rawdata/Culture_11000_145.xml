==Projections and progress assessment==
According to the African Writers Trust website, the organization’s projected activities and programmes include establishing a Creative Writing School in Uganda, holding the African Writers Trust workshop and competition on an annual basis and in a different nation each year, establishing a Writer’s Fund to allow an established African Diaspora writer to spend a semester at an African university teaching students creative writing, and the like.&lt;ref name="AWT-programs"&gt;[http://www.africanwriterstrust.org/about/ "Activities and Programs"], African Writers Trust.

In a 22 May 2011 interview with [[Caine Prize]] nominee [[Beatrice Lamwaka]] for [[AfroLit]], current Director Goretti Kyomuhendo offered her own assessment of progress-to-date and future expectations for AWT: "Its mission is to build and sustain a strong supportive network for African writers in Africa and in the Diaspora. As you know, there are many hurdles that African writers have to grapple with in order to achieve their writing and publishing dream. These include lack of or limited publishing opportunities, professional writing skills development, supportive structures to develop and grow as writers and to sustain their creative processes and productions, lack of information on publishing and other resources for writers, lack of cross-border movement of books, and many others. We plan to address some of these problems, so I hope in ten years, we shall have made a difference for African writers."&lt;ref name="Afrolit-LB-GK" /&gt;

'''Albion''' is a six-issue comic book [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] plotted by [[Alan Moore]], written by his daughter [[Leah Moore]] and her husband [[John Reppion]], with covers by [[Dave Gibbons]] and art by [[Shane Oakley]] and [[George Freeman (comics)|George Freeman]]. As a result of a deal forged by Vice-President Bob Wayne of [[DC Comics]] and Publishing Director [[Andrew Sumner]] of [[IPC Media]], it was published through [[DC Comics]]'  [[WildStorm]] imprint. The series aimed to revive classic IPC-owned [[British comics]] characters such as [[Captain Hurricane (comics)|Captain Hurricane]], [[Robot Archie]], [[Steel Claw|The Steel Claw]] and [[The Spider (comic)|The Spider]] (as well as minor characters like [[Fishboy (comic)|Fishboy]] and [[Faceache]]), all of whom appeared in comics published by [[Odhams Press]] and later [[IPC Media]] during the 1960s and early 1970s, such as ''[[Valiant (comic)|Valiant]]'' and ''[[Lion (comic)|Lion]]''.

Debuting with a cover date of August, 2005 the first two issues were released monthly, with the third issue delayed two months (Moore &amp; Reppion cited delays in scheduling impacting the art production&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.th3rdworld.com/forum/viewtopic.php?=&amp;p=2618 Moore &amp; Reppion writing at ''Th3rdworld.com'', January 22, 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090316235313/http://www.th3rdworld.com/forum/viewtopic.php?=&amp;p=2618 |date=16 March 2009 }}. Accessed 4 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;). Initially solicited release between October 2005 and January 2006, issues 4–6 were subsequently resolicited, and finally released throughout 2006, with cover dates between June and November. The TPB collection followed swiftly after No. 6 was released in both the US and UK, from WildStorm and [[Titan Books]] respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comicbookdb.com/title.php?ID=29 ComicBookDb: ''Albion'']. Accessed 4 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fictional setting==

The story revolves around a modern-day Britain where comic book characters have turned out to really exist. The British public had been largely unaware of their existence throughout the '60s and '70s, thinking them to be fictional.

Most of the IPC heroes are now interred within an asylum (comparisons are drawn with [[Camp X-Ray]]), and the daughter of one of the inmates (who calls herself Penny) is determined to reveal their existence to the larger public. Using a similar narrative device to that which Alan Moore employed in ''[[Supreme (comics)|Supreme]]'' and ''[[Tom Strong]]'', flashbacks are related in the style of comics of yesteryear. For example, Penny Dreadful's childhood is drawn in a style similar to [[Dennis the Menace (UK)|Dennis the Menace]] or the [[Bash Street Kids]].

==Characters==

A number of characters from UK comics appear in Albion, some are prisoners, others prison guards, others are at large include:

===Prison guards===

====Captain Hurricane====
A huge and muscular World War II hero who is the final line of defence in the government prison. He has an old-fashioned style about him; he uses quaint phrases ("The whole ruddy lot of us", "I could do with forty winks", etc.) and is casually racist. [[Captain Hurricane (comics)|Captain Hurricane]]'s origin is revealed in ''Albion'', he is the result of hundreds of experiments to create a [[supersoldier]] through the use of drugs. His assistant 'Maggot' Malone is a medical doctor monitoring his condition and dosing the Captain's tea with sedatives, to prevent him from going into one of his terrifying [[psychotic]] "ragin' furies".

====Eagle-Eye====
Ian Eagleton, as a child "Junior Spy" he had many encounters with Grimly Feendish who terrified him. When he grew up, he became the Warden of the government prison that held all the heroes, villains and other bizarre individuals of his youth.

====Jason Hyde====
Jason Hyde was exposed to radiation that resulted in him developing x-ray vision and mind-reading abilities. He currently works as a security guard in the prison.

====Zip Nolan====
Once an America police detective who served in both Korea and Vietnam, he is now a member of Special Operations who is investigating potential problems in the Castle.

===Prisoners===

====Brian's Brain====
A computer in the shape of a human head with a skull-like face and transparent cranium who was formerly the property of a boy named Brian Kingsley, the Brain is an "inmate" in the government prison who has become integrated with the prison computer systems and has predicted an upcoming disaster.

====The Cloak====
The Cloak was a mysterious noseless and bulgy-eyed black-caped secret agent who admired [[The Shadow]] and was a self-taught expert at sorcery. Despite his service to his country he was arrested and placed in the government prison along with all the others.

====Cursitor Doom====
Cursitor Doom is an intense-eyed, shaven-headed psychic investigator and seemingly immortal sorcerer cursed to remain forever within the walls of his isolated castle who has been in a coma for the past “twenty-something years”, a condition which has allowed the government to convert his ancient home into a prison.

====The House of Dolmann====
Eric Dolmann is a master inventor and robotics expert, he has created a range of doll-like robots to fight crime. Over twenty years ago he was arrested by ''The Spider'', an event that is witnessed by his daughter Penny. He died in prison.

====Faceache====
Faceache, Frederick Akeley has the ability to change or "[[gurn|scrunge]]" his face and body into a vast variety of different forms, many quite monstrous in appearance. He is a trustee in the prison and does impressions of [[Bruce Forsyth]] for the guards. He is dating Martha of the Monster Make-Up.

====Grimly Feendish====
Grimly Feendish (aka Grymleigh Gartside Fiendstien) began his life of crime over thirty years ago, committing crimes including theft, arson, murder and acts of gross indecency with the help of his monstrous little "Squelchies". He is eventually arrested and imprisoned in the government prison.

====Gogra====
Lazlo Gogra is an evil [[dwarfism|dwarf]] genius obsessed with possessing the towering robotic simian Mytek the Mighty.

====Kelly's Eye====
Tim Kelly rescued a South American shaman and was given a jewel called the ''Eye of Zoltec'', also known as the ''Eye of Everlasting Life'', which granted him invulnerability. He is currently a prisoner in the government prison, much aged after the jewel's confiscation. The Eye itself is shown to be in the possession of the British Prime Minister since the time of [[Margaret Thatcher]].

====Louis Crandall====
Better known as the [[Steel Claw]], a prisoner and friend of Tim Kelly. Crandall has the ability to turn invisible by directing an electrical shock through his artificial right hand, causing him to vanish completely save for the metal [[prosthesis]] itself which seems to eerily float in the air. When Crandall was arrested the Claw was confiscated and locked away in the prison armoury.

====Martha's Monster Make-Up====
Martha has make-up that her father brought home from [[Hammer Studios|Anvil Studios]] which can transform her face into that of a monster. She is in prison and is dating Faceache.

====Mytek the Mighty====
An incredibly powerful giant robot ape originally built to control unruly natives in colonial Africa which can be operated from a control room inside its head.

====Rubberman====
James Hollis, had a curse placed on him by an Indian [[fakir]] that turned his body to rubber, allowing him to stretch great distances. He attempted an escape with Tri-man which failed. He is being stored in a cooled cell which negates his elasticity.

====The Spider====
The self-proclaimed "''King of Crooks''", this ego and intellect-driven black-clad, pointy-eared master criminal was employed by the conservative Thatcher government to capture all super-villains and superheroes, all eccentric inventors and magicians, and all bizarre freaks and weirdos and exceptionally rebellious or gifted children who could be considered to be disruptive to the orderly running of British society, and as his reward he was also imprisoned for, as the Spider himself admits, "Nobody does treachery like the English". He loves playing mind games and is always looking for ways to escape.

====Tri-Man====
Johnny Small obtained three amazing superpowers from Professor Meek's ray:  super-sight, super-speed, and super-strength. He was a prisoner until ''The Spider'' encouraged him to attempt an escape with Rubberman, and he was killed during the attempt.

===Others===

====Bad Penny====
Penny Dolmann, daughter of inventor Eric Dolmann, was a child who loved to get in trouble and play with her father's robots. She was put into foster care after her father was arrested by the government and had a very difficult time in school. She has inherited her father's inventive genius, and has been locating her father's missing "dolls" since she was 18. At the start of ''Albion'' she is looking for allies to find and rescue her father and the other heroes.

====[[Charlie Peace (comic strip)|Charlie Peace]]====
A Victorian thief who travelled forward in time to the 1970s when he stole a magical watch from Cursitor Doom. He set up a music shop under the alias "Charles Love" and later took over an antique store. He became aware that the government was arresting unique individuals and is very careful about revealing his identity.

====Danny====
A scruffy young collector of old British comics who was apparently orphaned in a bus accident that robbed him of all memory of his previous life. After recognising Grimly Feendish and calling out his name as the master criminal is taken away by the police, he finds himself literally dragged into Penny's quest to find her father and eventually discovers how the secret of his true history is tied both to the castle and to Cursitor Doom.

====[[Janus Stark]]====
A Victorian era hero who, born with rubber-like bones, is a brilliant [[escapologist]] who can escape from any trap and uses his amazing abilities to solve crimes and fight evil.

====Queen of the Seas====
Also known as the ''Buoyant Queen'', the Queen of the Seas is a battered and somewhat less than reliable old ship whose small crew consists of the [[monocle]]d, [[cigarette holder]]-smoking Captain Enoch and his portly first mate Bert.

====[[Robot Archie]]====
Robot Archie was an old-fashioned heroic mechanical man who was deactivated and served as a display in a cafe until Penny and Danny rescued and reactivated him.

==Spinoffs==

[[File:Alfred bruyas.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Portrait of Alfred Bruyas, [[Gustave Courbet]], 1854]]
'''Alfred Bruyas''' (15 August 1821 – 1 January 1876) was an art collector and a personal friend of many important artists of his time, among them [[Gustave Courbet]]. He donated his collection to the [[Musée Fabre]], in [[Montpellier]].

Born Jacques Louis Bruyas, he was the son of a wealthy banker in Montpellier. His interest in art was clear even at school.  In 1840 he studied at the studio of [[Charles Matet]], however he soon recognized the limits of his own talents and shifted his focus to the promotion and collection of contemporary art.

From 1849 to 1854 he spent most of his time in Paris. There he collected work by [[Louis Hector Allemand]], [[Camille Corot]], [[Thomas Couture]], [[Eugène Delacroix]], [[Narcisse Diaz de Peña]], [[Adrien Guignet]], [[Adolphe Hervier]], [[Prosper Marilhat]], [[Edouard-Antoine Marsal]], [[Jean-François Millet]], [[Théodore Rousseau]], [[Philippe-Joseph Tassaert]], [[Marcel Verdier]] and [[Constant Troyon]], but above all the work of [[Gustave Courbet]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3685">'''Anglo-Saxon metrical charms''' were sets of instructions generally written to magically resolve a situation or disease. Usually, these charms involve some sort of physical action, including making a medical potion, repeating a certain set of words, or writing a specific set of words on an object. These [[Anglo-Saxon]] charms tell a great deal about medieval medical theory and practice. Although most medical texts found from the pre-Christian Anglo-Saxon period are translations of Classical texts in Latin, these charms were originally written in [[Old English]]. Through these metrical charms, we can more easily understand the religious beliefs and practices that pre-Christian Anglo-Saxon England had; we can also see how the people of that time saw and understood sickness and health.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;The Broadview Anthology of British Literature: The Medieval Period, pg. 32-35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, some non-mainstream medical professionals use [[herbal remedies]], but these are often based on some sort of scientific reason. The medical procedures and herbal remedies in these Anglo-Saxon medical charms are not based on science, but on other spiritual qualities that they were believed to have at the time. While many of these charms do have pagan qualities, they are not entirely anti-Christian, with most of the charms including both [[pagan]] and [[Christian]] characteristics. For example, the [[Nine Herbs Charm]] mentions both the Germanic god [[Woden]] and [[Jesus Christ]], the central figure of Christianity.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heorot.dk/woden-9herbs.html|title=WODEN'S NINE HERBS CHARM|author=|date=|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Known charms==
Twelve Metrical Charms survive in [[Old English]], principally in the collection of medical texts known in modern scholarship as ''[[Lacnunga]]'' (10th to 11th century), but also in [[Bald's Leechbook]] (10th century) and as marginal additions in other manuscripts. They are:

;[[Æcerbot]]: This charm, also known as "For Unfruitful Land," is a charm meant to "heal" lands that have yielded poorly.
;[[Against a Dwarf]]: The express purpose of this charm has yet to be decided upon by scholars, but some believe that the dwarf is some sort of disease (perhaps one that involves a fever).
;[[Against a Wen]]: This charm is supposed to rid a person of a wen, which is the Old English word for a cyst or skin blemish.
;[[A Journey Charm]]: This charm's purpose is to ask God and other various Biblical figures to protect one on his or her journey.
;[[For a Swarm of Bees]]: This charm, also known as The Old English Bee Charm, is meant to protect one from a swarm of bees.
;[[For Loss of Cattle #1]]
;[[For Loss of Cattle #2]]
;[[For Loss of Cattle #3]]: All three charms titled "For Loss of Cattle," are, as the title says, meant to help one find their lost cattle.
;[[For Delayed Birth]]: This charm's purpose is to help a woman who is unable to bring her unborn child to term.
;[[For the Water-Elf Disease]]: This charm is meant to heal one of the water-elf disease, which involves pale and ill-looking nails and watery eyes.
;[[Nine Herbs Charm]]: This charm is meant to heal an infection or disease using nine specific herbs.
;[[Wið færstice]]: This charm, also known as "For a Sudden Stitch," describes how to heal a sudden and sharp pain; this pain is thought by some scholars to be [[rheumatism]].

An '''arts district''' is a demarcated urban area, usually on the periphery of a [[city centre]], intended to create a 'critical mass' of places of cultural consumption - such as [[Art gallery|art galleries]], [[Nightclub|dance club]]s, [[Theater (structure)|theatre]]s, [[art cinema]]s, music venues, and public squares for performances. Such an area is usually encouraged by public policy-making and planning, but sometimes occurs spontaneously. It is associated with allied service-industry jobs like cafes, printers, fashion outlets, restaurants, and a variety of 'discreet services' (see the back-page small-ads of almost any cultural events-listings magazine).

There may also be some artists' studios located in nearby back-streets. But, as [[Richard Florida]] has found from his research, cultural production facilities are often better sited some miles away from cultural consumption facilities - except in some very tolerant cities and in countries where a boisterous alcohol-based nightlife scene does not lead to aggressive and anti-social behaviour.

In the [[United Kingdom|UK]] the term sometimes used is "Cultural quarter" or "Arts quarter".

== Types of Arts Districts ==
Steiner and Butler outline five types of arts districts commonly found in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Steiner|first=Frederick|title=Planning and Urban Design Standards|year=2007|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=Hoboken, New Jersey|isbn=978-0-471-76090-0|page=242|author2=Kent Butler}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Cultural compounds - tend to be the oldest art districts often established in cities before the 1930s.  These tend to be well-known art districts engrained into the mentality and culture of a community or nation.
# Major Cultural Institutions - large institutions that serve as anchors for an arts district such as large concert halls, playhouses, libraries, or museums.
# Arts and entertainment centers - focus primarily on smaller, popular attractions such as small theaters, private galleries, restaurants, and other entertainment that often has a more bohemian feel than larger more established districts.
# Downtown Arts Districts - occasionally art districts encompass an entire downtown and especially when tourism and walk-ability is the focus of downtown.
# Cultural Production Districts - cultural production districts are characterized by production spaces such as specialized studios, arts centers, and media facilities.  These areas are often tied to affordable studio housing for artists and prioritize the cultural life of the neighborhood.

'''Australian archaeology''' is a large sub-field in the discipline of [[archaeology]]. Archaeology in Australia takes three main forms, [[Australian Aborigines|Aboriginal]] archaeology (the archaeology of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in Australia before and after European settlement), [[historical archaeology]] (the archaeology of Australia after European settlement) and [[maritime archaeology]]. Bridging these sub-disciplines is the important concept of [[cultural heritage management]] which encompasses Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander sites, historical sites and maritime sites.

==Research and investigations==
Archaeological studies or investigations of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and culture in Australia have had many different agendas through time. Initial archaeological investigation was often focused on finding the oldest sites. By the 1970s, archaeological research was concerned with the environment and the way it impacted on humans. In the late 1970s cultural heritage management gained prominence, with the increasing demands by Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander groups for representation in archaeological research. At a research level the focus shifted to cultural change of Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people through time.

Currently, archaeological research places great importance on Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people's viewpoints on the land and history of Australia. Consideration is given to Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people's belief that archaeological sites are not just capsules of the past but a continuation from the past to the present. Therefore, at a research level significance is placed on the past but also on the importance of the present.

{{See also|Prehistory of Australia}}
The first settlement of Australia is a popular research topic both in archaeology and in the public arena. There is consensus that no [[Hominidae|human or closely related species]] evolved independently in Australia. This is because there have been no species of primate found in Australia, either in the present or in the fossil record. It is therefore assumed that the first settlers of Australia came from outside. At present the fossil record suggests that the first settlers were ''[[Homo sapiens]]'', or fully modern humans.

There is controversy over where the first Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people originated. Both of the two main theories postulate that the first settlers were fully modern humans. Asian genetic studies have demonstrated that there are similarities between Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, [[Melanesians]] and [[India]]ns. However, the suggested date of 60,000 years ago for initial settlement is quite early when compared to other areas of the world. This may suggest that the Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population derive from an early African population which migrated along the south coast of Asia, at a much faster rate than other populations migrating across the continents of the [[Holocene]].

The first settlement of Australia most likely occurred during the last glacial maximum. During this time Australia and [[New Guinea]] were joined as a single land mass called [[Sahul continent|Sahul]]. The south-east Asian continent and islands were also joined as a single land mass called [[Sundaland|Sunda]]. It is theorised that the first Australians crossed the sea between Sahul and Sunda about 60,000 to 40,000 years ago. Other dates have been suggested, and this timeframe is not seen as conclusive. Sunda and Sahul had a permanent water-crossing, meaning that the first Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people had to make a crossing on the open sea (see [[Wallace Line]]).

Sahul is important in that in the past Australia was not an isolated continent, but was joined with New Guinea (and Tasmania). As such, New Guinea has also been the focus of archaeological investigations by Australian researchers.

The most important early sites in Australia are:
* [[Rottnest Island]] (70,000 years old)
* [[Nauwalabila]] (55,000 – 60,000 years old)
* [[Madjedbebe]] (65,000 years ago)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Clarkson|first1=Chris|last2=Smith|first2=Mike|last3=Marwick|first3=Ben|last4=Fullagar|first4=Richard|last5=Wallis|first5=Lynley A.|last6=Faulkner|first6=Patrick|last7=Manne|first7=Tiina|last8=Hayes|first8=Elspeth|last9=Roberts|first9=Richard G.|last10=Jacobs|first10=Zenobia|last11=Carah|first11=Xavier|last12=Lowe|first12=Kelsey M.|last13=Matthews|first13=Jacqueline|last14=Florin|first14=S.

* [[Devil's Lair]] (45,000 years old)
* [[Lake Mungo]] (61,000 or 40,000 years old) – controversy exists over precise dating (see below)
The change in sea levels means that the first settlements located on the coast would have been submerged.

With the settlement of Australia, it is most probable that Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people first settled on the northern coast, as this is the area closest to Asia. However, the actual spread of people and the settlement of the continent is debated, with three major models put forward:
* Concentric dispersal through the entire continent through one single "entry" point.
* Coastal dispersal by spreading along the coastline and later entering inland areas, mainly via the major waterways.
* Fluctuating colonisation in and out of different environmental zones. For example, in plentiful years the population would occupy semi-arid regions, but in drought would move to areas with better resources.

===Controversies in Aboriginal archaeology===

====Date of arrival====
There is significant debate over the date of arrival of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people into the Australian continent. Until the 1950s it was often believed that arrival of the first Aboriginal people was within the last 10,000 years. In the 1950s, the dates were extended to the last Ice Age, based upon falling sea-levels at that period and the existence of [[landbridge]]s linking the islands of the Sunda Shelf and the Sahul Continental Shelf with Australia, New Guinea and Tasmania. The discovery and use of C14 dating extended the dating to 40,000 years at Lake Mungo, and this was the date most frequently given. However, more recently, the analysis of sea levels has shown that coastlines 40,000 years ago were not as exposed as they were 60,000 to 70,000 years ago. The submergence of the earliest sites of occupation due to rising sea levels has meant that the earliest archaeological signature may in fact represent occupation much later than the initial time of arrival.&lt;ref name="Hiscock, P. 2008"&gt;Hiscock, P. (2008). Archaeology of Ancient Australia, London; New York: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; The difficulty in establishing a date of arrival earlier than 50,000 years has been compounded by the widespread use of radiocarbon dating and the supposed "radiocarbon barrier" which establishes 40,000 years as a limit to which C14 dates can be easily and reliably extracted.&lt;ref name="Hiscock, P. 2008"/&gt; This limitation has prompted many archaeologists, including [[Rhys Jones (archaeologist)|Rhys Jones]] and Alan Thorne, to include [[thermoluminescence dating|thermoluminescence dating methods]] in their studies of early occupation sites. It is argued that 60,000 to 70,000 years best fits the evidence from the [[Human genome diversity project]] and a number of other new dating technologies. Some have proposed dates extending back 100,000 to 120,000 years, but these dates are criticised on technical grounds and are not accepted by most scientists. A recent study by Eske Willesev of the University of Copenhagen, of the genome of an Aboriginal man from the [[Western Australia]]n [[Goldfields-Esperance|Goldfields]] confirms that the Aboriginal population separated from the early human stock 70,000 years ago, in Africa or from Oman, and travelled fairly rapidly across south and south eastern Asia to arrive in Australia at least 50,000 years ago, before a second wave travelled into Europe and Asia, receiving some input from the Aboriginal people who had already made that journey.&lt;ref&gt;http://geogenetics.ku.dk/latest-news/aboriginals-get-new-history/ accessed 2/22016&lt;/ref&gt;

====Multiple arrivals====
Earlier anthropologists believed that there were "three waves" of arrival of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to Australia, the first being the "negrito" Tasmanian people, who were displaced by "Murrayans", who in turn were considered to be displaced by "Carpentarians". These theories were sometimes advocated to disprove the Aboriginal claim to being the indigenous "first peoples". The fact that modern Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people cannot explain the [[Bradshaw rock paintings|Bradshaw figures]] of North Western Australia was also seen as evidence of displacement of earlier peoples by later arrivals. The finding of a robust skeleton with surprisingly so-called "primitive" features at [[Kow Swamp Archaeological Site|Kow Swamp]] was also advocated as proof of an earlier wave of settlers to the continent. Dating of the Kow Swamp material, however, showed that rather than being earlier, it was in fact a lot more recent than the nearby Mungo gracile skeletons that more closely resembled modern Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Today it is thought that Aboriginal people throughout the continent are descendants of an original founder population, although this does not completely exclude some contribution from later arrivals.

For example, on the basis of genomic analysis, it has been found that 4–500 years ago a small band from the Indian sub-continent travelled to northern Australia and contributed to the genome of people living in the north.  At that time the appearance of the backed blade tradition, the dingo and other cultural features have been attributed to the arrivals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pugach | first1 = I. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2013 | title = Genome wide data substanciateHolocene gene flow from India to Australia | url = | journal = Proc.

====Megafauna extinction====
Some researchers, such as [[Tim Flannery]], have put forward the idea that human settlement was responsible for the large climatic and environmental changes that occurred in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Flannery, Tim (2002), "The Future Eaters: An Ecological History of the Australasian Lands and People." (Grove Press)&lt;/ref&gt;

The extent and causes of the [[Australian megafauna]]l extinction—generally placed in the [[Late Pleistocene]]—continues as an active debate and is a preoccupation among archaeologists and palaeontologists working in the Australian scene. Besides ongoing attempts to refine the dating and extent of the extinction event(s), much research is actively directed towards establishing whether, or to what extent, [[anthropogenic effects]] played a part in the disappearance of dozens of species of large-bodied animals formerly inhabiting the continent. Central to this question is a determination of how long humans and the megafauna species coexisted. Many factors have been considered as possible causes of the extinction, ranging from environmental variables to entirely human-based activity.

The most extreme theory is that Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people were completely responsible for the extinction of these animals through extensive hunting. This theory is largely based on the [[overkill hypothesis]] of the Americas, where hunters travelled through the land exterminating megafauna. The overkill hypothesis is largely discredited (and not just in Australia), as there have been no confirmed discoveries of [[kill sites]], sites that are found in other contexts around the world and associated with megafauna hunting. The sites of [[Cuddie Springs]] in [[New South Wales]], and [[Keilor Archaeological Site|Keilor]] in Victoria, display some evidence of associations between Aboriginal stone tools and megafauna remains, but do not prove conclusively the overkill theory. Furthermore, the coexistence of Aboriginal populations with the megafauna tends to contradict the overkill hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;D.R.Horton, "Red kangaroos: Last of the Australian megafauna" (CSA Illumina)&lt;/ref&gt;  These writers suggest "threshold (for megafauna dieoff) was crossed between 26,000 and 15,000 yr B.P. when the arid area expanded further than usual and water resources in the woodland areas were severely reduced", although this finding is disputed by Roberts ''et al.''&lt;ref&gt;Roberts R.G. (2001), "New Ages for the Last Australian Megafauna: Continent-Wide Extinction About 46,000 Years Ago" (Science, 8 June 2001: Vol. 292 no. 5523 pp. 1888–1892)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Gifford et al (1999), "Pleistocene Extinction of Genyornis newtoni: Human Impact on Australian Megafauna" (Science 8 January 1999: Vol. 283 no. 5399 pp. 205–208)&lt;/ref&gt; It is clear from [[paleobotany|paleobotanical]] and [[palaeontological]] evidence that the extinction coincided with great environmental change. The high-resolution chronology of the changes supports the hypothesis that human hunting alone eliminated the megafauna, and that the subsequent change in flora was most likely a consequence of the elimination of browsers and an increase in fire.&lt;ref name = "Biello"&gt;{{cite web

Approximately 18,000 to 7,000 years ago, many societies around the world underwent significant change; in particular, this time marks the rise of agriculture in many Neolithic societies. In the Australian context environmental change did not give rise to the development of agriculture but it may have contributed to the disappearance of populations of animals made even more vulnerable to depletion through hunting and marginalised grazing.

====Lake Mungo dating====
Arguably the oldest human remains in Australia, the Lake Mungo 3 skull was given the age of 60,000 years by Gregory Adcock and his researchers.&lt;ref name="Adcock2001"&gt;{{ cite journal |last=Adcock |first=G. |authorlink= |year=2001 |title=Mitochondrial DNA sequences in ancient Australians: Implications for modern human origins |journal= [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|PNAS]] |volume= 98 |issue= 2 |pages=537–542 |doi= 10.1073/pnas.98.2.537|url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/98/2/537 |accessdate=|quote= |pmid=11209053 |pmc=14622 |bibcode = 2001PNAS...98..537A |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this claim has been criticised, largely due to the process used to analyse the skull and the claims regarding the dating and the [[mtDNA]] found.&lt;ref name="mungo2"&gt;Brown, Peter. (2005). [http://www-personal.une.edu.au/~pbrown3/LM3.html Lake Mungo 3] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140126190110/http://www-personal.une.edu.au/~pbrown3/LM3.html |date=26 January 2014 }}. Retrieved 9 January 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Most people suggest that the age of the specimen is approximately 40,000 years. Sensitivities to handling Aboriginal remains means that specimens are not available for further research, so reassessment of the date awaits the development of appropriate ethical protocols.

====The intensification debate====
The idea of intensification was put forward by a number of archaeologists, but the most prominent in developing the idea was [[Harry Lourandos]]. Intensification is an idea that posits that change in economic systems of peoples is controlled by social changes. This means that change can occur without an external force such as environmental change. The idea is derived from a 1990s debate about the [[Tasmania]]n Aboriginal people and whether large social/economic change was caused by environmental factors (see ''[[Environmental determinism]]''), or from factors within the society.&lt;ref name="inten1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lourandos | first1 = Harry | last2 = Ross | first2 = Anne | year = 1994 | title = The Great 'Intensification Debate': Its history and place in Australian Archaeology | journal = Australian Archaeology | volume = 39 | issue = 39| pages = 54–63 |jstor=40287690}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="inten2"&gt;Lourandos, Harry. (1997). ''Continent of Hunter-Gatherers''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-35946-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The predominant view at the time held that in the case of the Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people any social change was largely influenced by external, largely environmental, factors.

The evidence that supports this idea is that sites at approximately the same time (around 4,000 years ago) experienced increased usage. This is supported by increased site numbers, increased artefact density and an expansion into new environments. This evidence has also been explained by environmental factors, large population growth, technological change, or even [[taphonomy|post-depositional factors]].

====The cultivation question====
Kent Flannery's model&lt;ref&gt;Kent Flannery, "Origins and Ecological Effects of Early Domestication in Iran and the Near East," The Domestication and Exploitation of Plants and Animals, eds. Peter J. Ucko and G.W. Dimbleby (Chicago: Aldine Publishing Co., 1969), 73–100&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[broad spectrum revolution]] in which foragers diversified the types of food sources harvested, broadening their subsistence base outward to include more fish, small game, water fowl, invertebrates likes snails and shellfish, as well as previously ignored or marginal plant sources, would seem to apply to Australian hunters and gatherers. These changes were linked to climatic changes, including sea level rises during the [[Flandrian transgression]] in which:

# Conditions became more inviting to marine life offshore in shallow, warm waters.
# Quantity and variety of marine life increased drastically as did the number of edible species.
# Because the rivers' power weakened with rising waters, and the creation of many estuaries, the currents flowing into the ocean were slow enough to allow fish to ascend upstream to spawn.
# Birds found refuge next to riverbeds in marsh grasses and then proceeded to migrate to different habitats.

Aboriginal people had a good understanding of local ecologies, and harvested many varieties of plants and animals in season.  W.E.Roth talks about driving kangaroos into a 3 sided enclosure of nets "with the assistance of numerous beaters".  Wallabies and emus were also caught in a similar way.  Wallaroos were hunted with fire and beaten towards a creek, where they were killed with spears and sticks.&lt;ref name="roth"&gt;Roth W.E. Food: Its Search, Capture and Preparation: North Queensland Ethnography Bulletin No.3 1901.&lt;/ref&gt;  Animals were also driven towards set nets and fish traps were common.&lt;ref name="davis"&gt;Davis G (Nungabana) The Mullunburra: people of the Mulgrave River.  Cassowary Publications. 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

The degree to which Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people on the Australian continent practised agriculture has long been debated by archaeologists.  Earlier it was believed that Australian Aboriginal people were ignorant of the principles of agriculture, but this has since been disproven.  For instance, Australian Aboriginal women in traditional societies often transplanted immature "[[bush tucker]]" plants found growing in unfavourable locations to more favourable spots. There were also a number of plants (particularly seeds and roots) that could have lent themselves to cultivation, and were used in making such foods as [[Damper (food)|damper]]. [[Charles Sturt]] in his 1844 expedition to northwest New South Wales and central Australia reports seeing large haystacks built by Aboriginal people of seed crops. This was located east of Depot Glen [[Milparinka]] about 600&amp;nbsp;km from the [[Murray River]]. [[Firestick farming]] has also always been a technique used by Aboriginal people to open the canopy of closed canopy forests, introducing sunlight to the ground, and prompting germination of a number of foodstuffs known to attract [[kangaroo]] and other marsupials. This would encourage a more intensive land use than otherwise. But the main reason for the lack of agriculture in Australia is the extreme variability of the climate. Australia is the only continent on Earth, which, as a result of the [[El Nino]] [[Southern Oscillation]], experiences greater variability between years than it does between the seasons. Such climatic variability makes farming very difficult, especially for incipient farmers who cannot be supported from outside their community. Australian Aboriginal people found that maintaining stable populations below the effective carrying capacity of the environment would enable an adequate supply of food, even in drought years, so maintaining a stable culture. This made [[Hunter-gatherer|hunting and gathering]] a more sustainable activity on the Australian continent than [[neolithic]] farming. Evidence of cultivation at [[Kuk Swamp|Kuk]] in Papua New Guinea, from about 10–12,000 years BP (at a time when that island was joined to Australia, suggests crop raising was possible in the Sahul supercontinent when conditions were favourable.

==Historical archaeology in Australia==
{{main|Historical archaeology in Australia}}
[[Historical archaeology]] is the study of the past through material remains such as artefacts (i.e. objects), structures (e.g. standing and ruined buildings, fences, roads), features (e.g. ditches, mounds, canals, landfill), and even whole landscapes modified by human activity and their spatial and stratigraphic contexts.

The origins of [[historical archaeology in Australia]] are generally held to lie in archaeological investigations by the late William (Bill) Culican at Fossil Beach in Victoria, in Jim Allen's PhD research at Port Essington in the Northern Territory and in Judy Birmingham's work at [[Irrawang Pottery]] in the Hunter Valley of NSW.
An increasingly important area of Australian historical archaeology studies the interaction between European and other settlers, and Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.

==Underwater and maritime archaeology in Australia==
[[Underwater archaeology]] is archaeology practised in a submerged environment. It encompasses the pre-historic and historic eras. [[Maritime archaeology]] (the study of humans and their activities in, on, around and under the seas, rivers and estuaries) and Nautical archaeology, (the specialised study of boat and ship construction) are allied sub-disciplines of archaeology as a whole. Often the sites or relics are not inundated, however. Of late these various studies have progressed into the industrial and post-war eras. In mirroring their terrestrial roots, underwater archaeology, maritime and nautical archaeology can now include the examination of a wide range of sites ranging from the indigenous through to [[industrial archaeology]] and of late the study of wartime and post-war sites, including historic submerged aircraft. Better known as a sub-discipline of [[aviation archaeology]], underwater aviation archaeology is arguably the most recent offshoot of underwater archaeology, having developed its theoretical underpinnings and a substantial corpus of fieldwork, research and publication work in the late 1990s. Maritime archaeology, the first of these sub-disciplines to emerge in Australia, commenced under the aegis of Jeremy Green in the 1970s after concerns were expressed by academics and politicians over the rampant destruction of Dutch and British East Indian ships lost on the west coast. After Commonwealth legislation was enacted and enforced after 1976 and the States enacted their own legislation the sub-discipline spread throughout Australia, as a result of on-going funding by both the States and the Commonwealth. While also encompassing the study of port-related structures (e.g. jetties, anchorages), lighthouses, moorings, defences etc., initially the focus in maritime archaeology was solely on shipwrecks.&lt;ref&gt;Nash, M., (ed.) 2007. Shipwreck archaeology in Australia. UWA Press, Nedlands&lt;/ref&gt; Now far broader in its scope, in some states maritime and underwater archaeology is managed by museums and in others by cultural heritage management units. There are also numerous practitioners in private practice, or acting as consultants. Regardless, all practitioners operate under the aegis of the Australasian Institute for Maritime Archaeology (AIMA).&lt;ref&gt;Staniforth, M., &amp; Nash, M., (eds.) 2006, Underwater Archaeology: Australian Approaches. Springer,  NY&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural heritage management==
Commercial or consulting archaeology (also termed [[cultural heritage management]]) only developed in earnest in Australia from the 1970s, with the advent of various state legislation requiring approvals for damage or disturbance to archaeological relics, such as the Aboriginal and Archaeological Relics Preservation Act 1972, in Victoria. The [[Victoria Archaeological Survey]] was established from the Relics Office in 1975. Historical Archaeology is generally protected by separate legislation, such as the New South Wales Heritage Act 1977, and the various other state counterparts.

Cultural Heritage Management for archaeological sites is seen in the context of wider heritage issues, and follows the principles set out in the [[Burra Charter]] or the [[Australia ICOMOS]] charter for the conservation of places of cultural significance.

From a handful of practitioners in the '70s, there are now more than 250 commercially based archaeologists in Australia. Again in Victoria, one of the first to establish was du Cros and associates (later absorbed by Biosis Research, renamed [[Biosis Pty Ltd]] in 2012). The [[Australian Association of Consulting Archaeologist]] Inc. (AACAI) is the professional body established in 1979 with presently about 50 full members. In New South Wales, companies such as Casey and Lowe and GML have specialised in large scale historical archaeological salvage.

Consultancy archaeology is primarily driven by development, and so is often at the centre of controversy over ownership of heritage and in particular the conflicting objectives of conservation and development. Aboriginal communities often ascribe a special significance to the places where archaeological remains have been found.

===Legal obligations in Australia===
Protection and management of archaeology in Australia is controlled by Federal and State Government legislation including the Commonwealth Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984, The Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act and the various state archaeological legislation such as Victoria's Heritage Act 1995 (covering historical archaeology) and the [[Aboriginal Heritage Act 2006 (Victoria)|Aboriginal Heritage Act 2006]]. Several states maintain archaeological site inventories as the main management tool. The principle of most forms of archaeological legislation in Australia is to provide blanket protection for all archaeological remains and sites, whether or not they have been recorded, and use a system of permits and consents to control change to those sites. for Aboriginal archaeological sites, there is often a requirement for consultation with traditional owners, and they sometimes have a role in approving works that impact on archaeological sites.

===Native title and land rights===
{{main|Native title in Australia}}
Native title is formalised under The Commonwealth [[Native Title Act 1993]] which establishes a framework for the protection and recognition of [[native title]]. The Australian legal system recognises native title where:
*the rights and interests are possessed under traditional laws and customs that continue to be acknowledged and observed by the relevant Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islanders
*by virtue of those laws and customs, the Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islanders have a connection with the land or waters
*the native title rights and interests are recognised by the common law of Australia.

==Professional societies in Australian archaeology==
The [[Australian Archaeological Association]] is one of the largest and oldest organisations devoted to furthering archaeology of all types within Australia.

The [[Australasian Society for Historical Archaeology]] (ASHA) founded as the Australian Society for Historical Archaeology in 1970. Its aims were, and still are, to promote the study of historical archaeology in Australia.

The [[Archaeological and Anthropological Society of Victoria]] (AASV) is predominantly a non-professional organisation, which was formed in 1976 in through the amalgamation of two earlier societies, the [[Anthropological Society of Victoria]] formed in 1934, and the [[Archaeological Society of Victoria]] formed in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120716131750/http://www.aas.asn.au/conf07/sessions/sesabs01c.php Margaret Bullen, ''Transforming Economies, Changing States'' Australian Anthropological Society, Annual Conference 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
The principal academic journals publishing on Australian Archaeology in Australia, are: ''[[Australian Archaeology (journal)|Australian Archaeology]]'', ''[[The Artefact (journal)|The Artefact]]'', the ''Bulletin of the Australasian Institute for Maritime Archaeology'', and ''[[Australasian Society for Historical Archaeology#Publications|Australasian Historical Archaeology]]'', while some history focused journals such as ''[[History Australia]]'' also feature Australian Archaeology related topics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.informit.com.au/search;action=doSearch RMIT INFORMIT journal search ''Australia'' AND ''Archaeology'']&lt;/ref&gt; Several international journals such as ''Science'', ''Antiquity'' and the ''International Journal of Historical Archaeology'', often publish articles on Australian Archaeology.

The '''''Baptism of Christ''''' is a fresco by the Italian Renaissance painter [[Pietro Perugino]] and his workshop,  executed around 1482 and located in the [[Sistine Chapel]], [[Rome]].

==History==
The commission of the work originated in 1480, when Perugino was decorating a chapel in the [[Old St. Peter's Basilica]] in [[Rome]]. [[Pope Sixtus IV]] was pleased by his work, and decided to commission him also the decoration of the new Chapel he had built in the Vatican Palace. Due to the size of the work, Perugino was later joined by a group of painters from Florence, including [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]], [[Domenico Ghirlandaio|Ghirlandaio]] and others.
[[File:Perugino, battesimo di cristo 04.jpg|left|thumb|220px|Detail.]]
Perugino's assistants in the Sistine Chapel included [[Pinturicchio]], [[Andrea d'Assisi]], [[Rocco Zoppo]] or, less likely, [[Lo Spagna]] or [[Bartolomeo della Gatta]], but the attribution of details to them is disputed.

==Description==
The fresco of the ''Baptism of Christ'' is the first on the wall on the right of the altar, and parallels ''[[Moses Leaving to Egypt (Pietro Perugino)|Moses Leaving to Egypt and the Circumcision of Elezier]]'' facing it on the opposite wall, also by Perugino's workshop. The baptism was in fact considered by [[Augustine]] and other early Christian writers as a kind of "spiritual circumcision".

The scene follows a symmetrical pattern, typical of Perugino. In the center is the [[Jordan River]] flowing towards the observer and reaching the feet of Jesus and [[John the Baptist|John]], who is baptizing the former. A dove, symbol of the Holy Spirit, descends from the sky; it is sent by God, represented within a luminous cloud and flanked by flying  seraphims and cherubims. The landscape includes a symbolic view of Rome, recognizable by a triumphal arch, the [[Colosseum]] and the [[Pantheon (Rome)|Pantheon]]. The thin trees are typical of the Umbrian school and of Perugino in particular.

At the sides are two secondary episodes: the Baptist  (left) and Jesus (right) preaching at the crowd. The central scene also features two kneeling angels who are keeping a towel: these are elements inspired by [[early Netherlandish painting|Flemish paintings]], and can be seen in works by [[Hugo van der Goes]] and in the [[Portinari Triptych]]. At the sides, in the foreground, are portraits of contemporary characters, normally rare in Perugino, but in this case spurred by their presence in the works by Ghirlandaio, who was also working in the Sistine Chapel.

The fresco is surmounted by a frieze with the signature &lt;small&gt;OPVS PETRI PERVSINI · CASTRO PLEBIS&lt;/small&gt;.

The '''''Baronci Altarpiece''''' was a [[painting]] by the [[Italy|Italian]] [[High Renaissance]] artist [[Raphael]]. His first recorded commission, it was made for Andrea Baronci's chapel in the church of Sant'Agostino in [[Città di Castello]], near [[Urbino]]. The [[altarpiece]] was seriously damaged during an earthquake in 1789, and since 1849 fragments of the original painting have been part of different collections.

==History==
On December 10, 1500, Raphael and [[Evangelista da Pian di Meleto]], an older painter from the workshop of Raphael's father [[Giovanni Santi]], received the commission to paint jointly a large altarpiece dedicated to [[Nicholas of Tolentino|Saint Nicholas of Tolentino]], for the Baronci chapel in the Sant'Agostino Church in [[Città di Castello]]. In the documents Raphael, not his collaborator, is referred to as ''magister'' ("master"). The work on the paintings was completed on September 13, 1501.

In the center of the painting Nicholas of Tolentino stood in an archway, with the devil at his feet. Next to him were three angels. Above him [[God the Father]] was placed with a crown in his hand, and surrounded by the heads of angels. On his left the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] and [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]] were painted.

During a heavy earthquake in 1789 the painting was damaged so severely that it was decided to saw it into pieces and display only the undamaged parts. In the same year, the fragments were acquired by [[Pope Pius VI]] for the [[Vatican Museums|collections of the Vatican]], where they remained until 1849. It is unclear what happened to them after that. Only many years later scholars were able to trace back six different pieces, four fragments of the main painting and two [[predella]]s, which had become part of different collections.

An impression of the complete work is given by an 18th-century copy in the [[Pinacoteca Comunale, Città di Castello]]. Preliminary sketches by Raphael can be found in the [[Palais des Beaux-Arts|Palais des Beaux-Arts de Lille]], [[Lille]] and the [[Ashmolean Museum]], [[Oxford]]. On the basis of these drawings it is assumed that the design of the altar was entirely Raphael's work, whereas in the execution he was joined by Evangelista da Pian di Meleto. While Raphael probably painted the altarpiece itself, the predellas are attributed to Pian di Meleto.

[[File:Brautzug.jpg|thumb|[[Lindhorst]] bridal procession. The women are wearing ''Kranzmaikes'', Lower Saxony]]

Traditionally a '''bridal crown''' ({{lang-de|Brautkrone}} or, in the Black Forest, ''Schäppel'') is a headdress that single women wear on certain holidays, at festivals and, finally, at their wedding. Bridal crowns today, of another type, are also often provided by church parishes for the use of brides at their weddings.

== History ==
A bridal crown, along with the [[bridal wreath]] and [[bridal veil|veil]], is probably the oldest decorative form of headdress worn by women. With it the [[bride]] would symbolise her purity and it was also a status symbol for her family. Especially in farming areas, the bridal crown was and is very popular. In several regions the bride takes her crown off after the church service and hangs it over the wedding table as a sign of the peace.

The design of bridal crowns is very varied and depends on the place and region. To begin with they were decorated with flowers, fir branches, herbs and ripe fruits. In later times and even today, more expensive materials were used such as [[pearl]]s, [[mirror]]s, [[silver]] and [[gold]].

These more valuable headdresses could only be afforded by wealthy families. The less well off could, however, borrow them from neighbours and friends in return for payment in kind. Often the churches or parishes had bridal crowns and could hire them out. In the course of the 18th century, the bridal crown was replaced by the bridal wreath in many places, as had been the pagan custom in the 4th century.

When [[Marie of Saxe-Altenburg|Princess Mary of Saxe-Altenburg]] married King [[George V of Hanover]] he wore a large, golden crown and she a somewhat smaller golden bridal crown.

Such bridal crowns are traditionally worn together with a [[national costume|national]] or local costume (e.g. ''[[Tracht]]'' in Germany or Austria) or as a less expensive item in the shape of a small crown or a [[diadem]].

== Regional variations ==
In [[Norway]], [[Sweden]] and [[Serbia]] bridal crowns were made of silver; in [[Bavaria]], [[Silesia]] of gold wire, glass stones and glittering metal flakes.

In the [[Black Forest]], bridal crowns also have [[pearl]]s, glass balls, [[mirror]]s and ribbons or paper roses. Locally bridal crowns are always known as ''Schäppel'' and they vary in design from place to place. An insight into the range of the ''Schäppel'' in the Black Forest is the collection at the [[Black Forest Costume Museum]] in Haslach.

The so-called ''Borta'' is worn by the [[Sorbs]] in [[Lusatia]].

In [[Thuringia]] they wear a ''Hormt'' as part of the farming costume at Altenburg.

== Today ==
In [[Scandinavia]] bridal crowns today usually are made of brass, silver or gold, are fashioned like a smaller type of [[coronet]] of a princess and often have gems and ornate decorations. They are often attached to long veils.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.svd.se/historisk-brollopstrend Article] by Eva Bäckstedt  in ''[[Svenska Dagbladet]]'' 2010-06-15&lt;/ref&gt; Scandinavian church parishes keep such crowns of their own and lend them to brides for their wedding ceremonies and receptions.&lt;ref&gt;* Helena Michon-Bordes in ''Brudkrona och brudkronesed. En studie med särskild hänsyn till Uppsala ärkestift.'' Yearbook ''Uppland'' 1964 ([[Uppsala]]), pp. 57-92.&lt;/ref&gt; The crown relates to the [[Virgin Mary]], and is a statement of a young woman's purity and [[virginity]] at her wedding.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ingebretsens.com/culture/weddings/bridal-crowns&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3000">The '''British Association for Jewish Studies''' ('''BAJS''') is an organization in the [[United Kingdom]] that promotes scholarly study of [[Jewish culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britac.ac.uk/links/uksahssSections.asp?Section=H2 |title=British Academy directory |publisher=Britac.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-06-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927003816/http://www.britac.ac.uk/links/uksahssSections.asp?Section=H2# |archive-date=2011-09-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucl.ac.uk/hebrew-jewish/graduate/dept_resources.php#bajs UCL - Hebrew &amp; Jewish Dept. resources] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070712232405/http://www.ucl.ac.uk/hebrew-jewish/graduate/dept_resources.php#bajs |date=July 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The society was founded in 1975 as a [[non-profit]], professional organization. Its focus is on supporting and cultivating higher education in the [[British Isles]] relating to Jewish culture and history.  They also organize conferences and support research and publication.

The BAJS conducts a survey each year on what courses in [[Jewish studies]] are being offered at British universities.  The most recent report may be viewed through a link on the BAJS website.
The BAJS also holds two essay competitions annually. One is for undergraduates and the other for post-grads. The winners are awarded ￡200 each.

==Membership==
Membership is open to:

*Scholars concerned with the field of Jewish Studies.
*Graduate students in the field of Jewish Studies.
*People outside of the United Kingdom with a “serious academic interest” in the field of Jewish Studies.
*People within the United Kingdom and [[Ireland]] with a “serious academic interest in the field of Jewish Studies, but who are not professionals in the subject.

The first group, also known as “ordinary members,” are given voting rights at the association's meetings, as well as eligibility for committee membership and office positions.
The last two groups are not allowed voting rights, but are allowed to attend conferences.

An application for membership must include the names of two references, at least one of whom must be an ordinary member of BAJS.  The Committee considers the applications, then they are voted on at the annual general meeting.

Subscription fees or dues are also decided on at the annual general meeting.

'''Design''' is the creation of a plan or convention for the construction of an object, system or measurable human interaction. Design has different [[connotation]]s in different fields (see [[#Design disciplines|design disciplines]] below). In some cases, the direct construction of an object (as in [[pottery]], [[engineering]], management, [[software development|coding]], and [[graphic design]]) is also considered to use design thinking.

Designing often necessitates considering the aesthetic, [[Functionalism (architecture)|functional]], economic, and sociopolitical dimensions of both the design object and design process. It may involve considerable [[research]], [[thought]], [[Physical model|modeling]], interactive [[problem solving|adjustment]], and re-design. Meanwhile, diverse kinds of objects may be designed, including [[clothing]], [[graphical user interface]]s, products, skyscrapers, [[corporate identity|corporate identities]], [[business process]]es, and even methods or processes of designing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Brinkkemper, S. |year=1996|title= Method engineering: engineering of information systems development methods and tools|journal= Information and Software Technology |volume=38|issue=4|pages=275–280|doi=10.1016/0950-5849(95)01059-9|url=http://doc.utwente.nl/18012/1/Brinkkemper96method.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus "design" may be a substantive referring to a categorical abstraction of a created thing or things (the design of something), or a verb for the process of creation as is made clear by grammatical context.

== Definitions ==
More formally design has been defined as follows:
{{Quote|(noun) a specification of an [[Object (philosophy)|object]], manifested by an [[Agency (philosophy)|agent]], intended to accomplish [[goal]]s, in a particular [[Environment (systems)|environment]], using a set of primitive components, satisfying a set of [[requirement]]s, subject to constraints; (verb, transitive) to create a design, in an [[Environment (systems)|environment]] (where the designer operates)&lt;ref&gt;Ralph, P. and Wand, Y. (2009). A proposal for a formal definition of the design concept. In Lyytinen, K., Loucopoulos, P., [[John Mylopoulos|Mylopoulos, J.]], and Robinson, W., editors, Design Requirements Workshop (LNBIP 14), pp. 103–136. Springer-Verlag, p. 109 {{DOI|10.1007/978-3-540-92966-6_6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Another definition for design is "a roadmap or a strategic approach for someone to achieve a unique expectation. It defines the specifications, plans, parameters, costs, activities, processes and how and what to do within legal, political, social, environmental, safety and economic constraints in achieving that objective."&lt;ref&gt;Don Kumaragamage, Y. (2011). Design Manual Vol 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Here, a "specification" can be manifested as either a plan or a finished product, and "primitives" are the elements from which the design object is composed.

The person designing is called a designer, which is also a term used for people who work professionally in one of the various design areas usually specifying which area is being dealt with (such as a textile designer, fashion designer, product designer, concept designer, web designer or interior designer). A designer's sequence of activities is called a design process while the scientific study of design is called [[design science]].&lt;ref&gt;Simon (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, C. (1964) Notes on the Synthesis of Form, Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Eekels, J. |year=2000|title=On the Fundamentals of Engineering Design Science: The Geography of Engineering Design Science, Part 1|journal= Journal of Engineering Design |volume=11|pages=377–397|doi=10.1080/09544820010000962|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="design theory"&gt;Braha, D. and Maimon, O. (1998) A Mathematical Theory of Design, Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another definition of design is planning to manufacture an object, system, component or structure. Thus the word "design" can be used as a noun or a verb. In a broader sense, design is an applied art and engineering that integrates with technology.

While the definition of design is fairly broad, design has a myriad of specifications that professionals utilize in their fields.

Major examples of design are [[blueprint|architectural blueprints]], [[engineering drawing]]s, [[business process]]es, [[circuit diagram]]s, and [[Pattern (sewing)|sewing patterns]]&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary meanings in the [//dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/design Cambridge Dictionary of American English], at [//www.dictionary.com/browse/design Dictionary.com] (esp. meanings 1–5 and 7–8) and at [//en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/design AskOxford] (esp. verbs).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design as a process{{anchor|Process}}==
Substantial disagreement exists concerning how designers in many fields, whether amateur or professional, alone or in teams, produce designs. Kees Dorst and Judith Dijkhuis, both designers themselves, argued that "there are many ways of describing design processes" and discussed "two basic and fundamentally different ways",&lt;ref&gt;Dorst and Dijkhuis 1995, p. 261&lt;/ref&gt; both of which have several names. The prevailing view has been called "the rational model",&lt;ref name="Brooks"&gt;Brooks 2010&lt;/ref&gt; "technical problem solving"&lt;ref name="Schön 1983"&gt;Schön 1983&lt;/ref&gt; and "the reason-centric perspective".&lt;ref name="Ralph 2010"&gt;Ralph 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The alternative view has been called "reflection-in-action",&lt;ref name="Schön 1983"/&gt; "evolutionary design",&lt;ref name="design theory"/&gt; "co-evolution",&lt;ref&gt;Dorst and Cross 2001&lt;/ref&gt; and "the action-centric perspective".&lt;ref name="Ralph 2010"/&gt;

===The rational model===
The rational model was independently developed by [[Herb Simon|Herbert A. Simon]],&lt;ref&gt;Newell and Simon 1972; Simon 1969&lt;/ref&gt; an American scientist, and Gerhard Pahl and Wolfgang Beitz, two German engineering design theorists.&lt;ref&gt;Pahl and Beitz 1996&lt;/ref&gt; It posits that:
# designers attempt to [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimize]] a design candidate for known [[constraint optimization|constraints]] and [[Goal|objectives]],
# the design process is plan-driven,
# the design process is understood in terms of a discrete sequence of stages.

The rational model is based on a [[Rationalism|rationalist philosophy]]&lt;ref name="Brooks" /&gt; and underlies the [[waterfall model]],&lt;ref&gt;Royce 1970&lt;/ref&gt; [[systems development life cycle]],&lt;ref&gt;Bourque and Dupuis 2004&lt;/ref&gt; and much of the [[engineering design]] literature.&lt;ref&gt;Pahl et al. 2007&lt;/ref&gt; According to the rationalist philosophy, design is informed by research and knowledge in a predictable and controlled manner.

====Example sequence of stages====
Typical stages consistent with the rational model include the following:
* Pre-production design
** [[Design brief]] or ''[[Parti pris]]''&amp;nbsp;– an early (often the beginning) statement of design goals
** [[Analysis]]&amp;nbsp;– analysis of current design goals
** [[Research]]&amp;nbsp;– investigating similar design solutions in the field or related topics
** [[Specification]]&amp;nbsp;– specifying requirements of a design solution for a product ([[product design specification]])&lt;ref&gt;Cross, N., 2006. T211 Design and Designing: Block 2, p. 99. Milton Keynes: The Open University.&lt;/ref&gt; or service.
** [[Problem solving]]&amp;nbsp;– [[wikt:conceptualize|conceptualizing]] and [[document]]ing design solutions
** [[Presentation]]&amp;nbsp;– presenting design solutions
* Design during production
** [[Product development|Development]]&amp;nbsp;– continuation and improvement of a designed solution
** Testing&amp;nbsp;– ''[[in situ]]'' testing of a designed solution
* Post-production design feedback for future designs
** [[Implementation]]&amp;nbsp;– introducing the designed solution into the environment

====Criticism of the rational model====
The rational model has been widely criticized on two primary grounds:

# Designers do not work this way&amp;nbsp;– extensive empirical evidence has demonstrated that designers do not act as the rational model suggests.&lt;ref name="Cross 1983"&gt;Cross et al. 1992; Ralph 2010; Schön 1983&lt;/ref&gt;
# Unrealistic assumptions&amp;nbsp;– goals are often unknown when a design project begins, and the requirements and constraints continue to change.&lt;ref&gt;Brooks 2010; McCracken and Jackson 1982&lt;/ref&gt;

===The action-centric model===
The action-centric perspective is a label given to a collection of interrelated concepts, which are antithetical to the rational model.&lt;ref name="Ralph 2010"/&gt; It posits that:

# designers use [[creativity]] and [[emotion]] to generate design candidates,
# the design process is [[Improvisation|improvised]],
# no universal sequence of stages is apparent&amp;nbsp;– analysis, design and implementation are contemporary and inextricably linked&lt;ref name="Ralph 2010"/&gt;

The action-centric perspective is based on an [[Empiricism|empiricist philosophy]] and broadly consistent with the [[Agile software development|agile approach]]&lt;ref&gt;Beck et al. 2001&lt;/ref&gt; and amethodical development.&lt;ref&gt;Truex et al. 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Substantial empirical evidence supports the veracity of this perspective in describing the actions of real designers.&lt;ref name="Cross 1983"/&gt; Like the rational model, the action-centric model sees design as informed by research and knowledge. However, research and knowledge are brought into the design process through the judgment and common sense of designers&amp;nbsp;– by designers "thinking on their feet"&amp;nbsp;– more than through the predictable and controlled process stipulated by the rational model.

====Descriptions of design activities====
At least two views of design activity are consistent with the action-centric perspective. Both involve three basic activities.

In the [[Reflective practice|reflection-in-action paradigm]], designers alternate between "[[Framing (social sciences)|framing]]", "making moves", and "evaluating moves". "Framing" refers to conceptualizing the problem, i.e., defining goals and objectives. A "move" is a tentative design decision. The evaluation process may lead to further moves in the design.&lt;ref name="Schön 1983"/&gt;

In the sensemaking–coevolution–implementation framework, designers alternate between its three titular activities. [[Sensemaking (information science)|Sensemaking]] includes both framing and evaluating moves. Implementation is the process of constructing the design object. Coevolution is "the process where the design agent simultaneously refines its mental picture of the design object based on its mental picture of the context, and vice versa".&lt;ref&gt;Ralph 2010, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of the [[design cycle]] is understood as a circular time structure,&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Fischer: ''Design Enigma. A typographical metaphor for enigmatic processes, including designing'', in: T. Fischer, K. De Biswas, J.J. Ham, R. Naka, W.X. Huang, Beyond Codes and Pixels: Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on Computer-Aided Architectural Design Research in Asia, p. 686&lt;/ref&gt; which may start with the thinking of an idea, then expressing it by the use of visual or verbal means of communication (design tools), the sharing and perceiving of the expressed idea, and finally starting a new cycle with the critical rethinking of the perceived idea. Anderson points out that this concept emphasizes the importance of the means of expression, which at the same time are means of perception of any design ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Anderson: ''Architectural Design'', Basics Architecture 03, Lausanne, AVA academia, 2011, {{ISBN|978-2-940411-26-9}}, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophies and studies of design==
There are countless philosophies for guiding design as design values and its accompanying aspects within modern design vary, both between different schools of thought{{which|date=February 2018}} and among practicing designers.&lt;ref&gt;Holm, Ivar (2006). ''Ideas and Beliefs in Architecture and Industrial design: How attitudes, orientations and underlying assumptions shape the built environment''. Oslo School of Architecture and Design. {{ISBN|82-547-0174-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Design philosophies are usually for determining design goals. A design goal may range from solving the least significant individual problem of the smallest element, to the most [[holistic]] influential [[utopian]] goals. Design goals are usually for guiding design. However, conflicts over immediate and minor goals may lead to questioning the purpose of design, perhaps to set better long term or ultimate goals.  John Heskett, a 20th-century British writer on design claimed, "Design, stripped to its essence, can be defined as the human nature to shape and make our environment in ways without precedent in nature, to serve our needs and give meaning to our lives."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heskett|first1=John|title=Toothpicks and Logos: Design in Everyday Life|date=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philosophies for guiding design===
Design philosophies are fundamental guiding principles that dictate how a designer approaches his/her practice. Reflections on [[material culture]] and environmental concerns ([[sustainable design]]) can guide a design philosophy. One example is the [[First Things First 2000 manifesto|First Things First manifesto]] which was launched within the graphic design community and states "We propose a reversal of priorities in favor of more useful, lasting and democratic forms of communication&amp;nbsp;– a mindshift away from product marketing and toward the exploration and production of a new kind of meaning. The scope of debate is shrinking; it must expand. Consumerism is running uncontested; it must be challenged by other perspectives expressed, in part, through the visual languages and resources of design."&lt;ref name="maxbruinsma.nl"&gt;[http://maxbruinsma.nl/index1.html?ftf2000.htm First Things First 2000 a design manifesto] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111219160927/http://maxbruinsma.nl/index1.html?ftf2000.htm |date=2011-12-19 }}. manifesto published jointly by 33 signatories in: Adbusters, the AIGA journal, Blueprint, Emigre, Eye, Form, Items fall 1999/spring 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Sciences of the Artificial'' by polymath [[Herbert A. Simon]], the author asserts design to be a meta-discipline of all professions. "Engineers are not the only professional designers. Everyone designs who devises courses of action aimed at changing existing situations into preferred ones. The intellectual activity that produces material artifacts is no different fundamentally from the one that prescribes remedies for a sick patient or the one that devises a new sales plan for a company or a social welfare policy for a state. Design, so construed, is the core of all professional training; it is the principal mark that distinguishes the professions from the sciences. Schools of engineering, as well as schools of architecture, business, education, law, and medicine, are all centrally concerned with the process of design."&lt;ref name="Herbert A. Simon 1996"&gt;Simon (1996), p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Approaches to design===
A design approach is a general philosophy that may or may not include a guide for specific methods. Some are to guide the overall goal of the design. Other approaches are to guide the tendencies of the designer. A combination of approaches may be used if they don't conflict.

Some popular approaches include:
* [[Sociotechnical system]] design, a philosophy and tools for participative designing of work arrangements and supporting processes - for organizational purpose, quality, safety, economics and customer requirements in core work processes, the quality of peoples experience at work and the needs of society
* [[KISS principle]], (Keep it Simple Stupid), which strives to eliminate unnecessary complications.
* [[There is more than one way to do it]] (TIMTOWTDI), a philosophy to allow multiple methods of doing the same thing.
* [[Use-centered design]], which focuses on the goals and tasks associated with the use of the artifact, rather than focusing on the end user.
* [[User-centered design]], which focuses on the needs, wants, and limitations of the end user of the designed artifact.
* [[Critical design]] uses designed artifacts as an embodied critique or commentary on existing values, morals, and practices in a culture.
* [[Service design]] designing or organizing the experience around a product and the service associated with a product's use.
* [[Transgenerational design]], the practice of making products and environments compatible with those physical and sensory impairments associated with human aging and which limit major activities of daily living.
* Speculative design, the speculative design process doesn't necessarily define a specific problem to solve, but establishes a provocative starting point from which a design process emerges. The result is an evolution of fluctuating iteration and reflection using designed objects to provoke questions and stimulate discussion in academic and research settings.
* [[Participatory design|Participatory Design]] (originally co-operative design, now often co-design) is the practice of collective creativity to design, attempting to actively involve all stakeholders (e.g. employees, partners, customers, citizens, end users) in the design process to help ensure the result meets their needs and is usable. Participatory design is an approach which is focused on processes and procedures of design and is not a design style&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://studiolab.ide.tudelft.nl/manila/gems/contextmapping/PreprintDraft.pdf|title=Co-creation and the new landscape of design|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Methods of designing===
{{Main article|Design methods}}
Design methods is a broad area that focuses on:
* [[Exploring]] possibilities and constraints by focusing critical thinking skills to research and define problem spaces for existing [[Product (business)|products]] or [[Service (economics)|services]]—or the creation of new categories (see also [[Brainstorming]])
* [[Definition|Redefining]] the specifications of design solutions which can lead to better guidelines for traditional design activities (graphic, industrial, architectural, etc.);
* [[Management|Managing]] the process of exploring, defining, creating artifacts continually over time
* [[Prototyping]] possible scenarios, or solutions that incrementally or significantly improve the inherited situation
* Trendspotting; understanding the trend process.

==Terminology==
The word "design" is often considered ambiguous, as it is applied in varying contexts.
[[File:M-T4.jpg|thumb|166px|left|The new terminal at [[Barajas airport]] in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]]]]

===Design and art===
Today, the term design is widely associated with the [[applied arts]] as initiated by [[Raymond Loewy]] and teachings at the [[Bauhaus]] and [[Ulm School of Design]] (HfG Ulm) in Germany during the 20th century.

The boundaries between art and design are blurred, largely due to a range of applications both for the term 'art' and the term 'design'. [[Applied arts]] has been used as an umbrella term to define fields of [[industrial design]], [[graphic design]], [[fashion design]], etc. The term '[[decorative arts]]' is a traditional term used in historical discourses to describe craft objects, and also sits within the umbrella of [[applied arts]]. In [[graphic art]]s (2D image making that ranges from photography to illustration), the distinction is often made between [[fine art]] and [[commercial art]], based on the context within which the work is produced and how it is traded.

To a degree, some methods for creating work, such as employing intuition, are shared across the disciplines within the [[applied arts]] and [[fine art]]. Mark Getlein, writer, suggests the principles of design are "almost instinctive", "built-in", "natural", and part of "our sense of 'rightness'."&lt;ref&gt;Mark Getlein, ''Living With Art'', 8th ed. (New York: 2008) 121.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the intended application and context of the resulting works will vary greatly.

[[File:Booster-Layout.jpg|thumb|A drawing for a booster engine for [[steam locomotive]]s. Engineering is applied to design, with emphasis on function and the utilization of mathematics and science.]]

===Design and engineering===
In [[engineering]], design is a component of the engineering process. Many overlapping methods and processes can be seen when comparing [[Product design]], [[Industrial design]] and [[Engineering]]. The [[American Heritage Dictionary]] defines design as: ''"To conceive or fashion in the mind; invent,"'' and ''"To formulate a plan"'', and defines engineering as: ''"The application of scientific and mathematical principles to practical ends such as the design, manufacture, and operation of efficient and economical structures, machines, processes, and systems."''.&lt;ref&gt;American Psychological Association (APA): [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/design design] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070108172005/http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/design |date=2007-01-08 }}. The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition. Retrieved January 10, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;American Psychological Association (APA): [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/engineering engineering] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070102052421/http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/engineering |date=2007-01-02 }}. The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition. Retrieved January 10, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Both are forms of problem-solving with a defined distinction being the application of "scientific and mathematical principles". The increasingly scientific focus of engineering in practice, however, has raised the importance of more new "human-centered" fields of design.&lt;ref&gt;Faste 2001&lt;/ref&gt; How much science is applied in a design is a question of what is considered "[[science]]". Along with the question of what is considered science, there is [[social science]] versus [[natural science]]. Scientists at [[Xerox PARC]] made the distinction of design versus engineering at "moving minds" versus "moving atoms" (probably in contradiction to the origin of term "engineering - engineer" from Latin "in genio" in meaning of a "genius" what assumes existence of a "mind" not of an "atom").

[[File:Aluminium MacBook.png|thumb|166px|left|[[Jonathan Ive]] has received several awards for his design of [[Apple Inc.]] products like this MacBook. In some design fields, [[personal computer]]s are also used for both design and production]]

===Design and production===
The relationship between design and [[Production, costs, and pricing|production]] is one of planning and executing. In theory, the plan should anticipate and compensate for potential problems in the execution process. Design involves problem-solving and [[creativity]]. In contrast, production involves a routine or pre-planned process. A design may also be a mere plan that does not include a production or engineering processes although a working knowledge of such processes is usually expected of designers. In some cases, it may be unnecessary or impractical to expect a designer with a broad [[multidisciplinary]] knowledge required for such designs to also have a detailed [[Division of labour|specialized]] knowledge of how to produce the product.

Design and production are intertwined in many [[creative professional]] careers, meaning problem-solving is part of execution and the reverse. As the cost of rearrangement increases, the need for separating design from production increases as well. For example, a high-budget project, such as a [[skyscraper]], requires separating (design) [[architect]]ure from (production) [[construction]]. A Low-budget project, such as a [[Multifunction printer|locally printed]] office party invitation [[Flyer (pamphlet)|flyer]], can be rearranged and printed dozens of times at the low cost of a few sheets of paper, a few drops of ink, and less than one hour's pay of a [[desktop publishing|desktop publisher]].

This is not to say that production never involves problem-solving or creativity, nor that design always involves creativity. Designs are rarely perfect and are sometimes repetitive. The imperfection of a design may task a production position (e.g. [[production artist]], [[construction worker]]) with utilizing creativity or problem-solving skills to compensate for what was overlooked in the design process. Likewise, a design may be a simple repetition (copy) of a known preexisting solution, requiring minimal, if any, creativity or problem-solving skills from the designer.

[[File:BPMN-DiscussionCycle.jpg|thumb|An example of a business workflow process using [[Business Process Model and Notation]].]]

===Process design===
{{See also|Business process management|Method engineering}}
"Process design" (in contrast to "design process" mentioned [[#Design as a process|above]]) refers to the planning of routine steps of a process aside from the expected result. Processes (in general) are treated as a product of design, not the method of design. The term originated with the industrial [[Process design (chemical engineering)|designing of]] [[chemical process]]es. With the increasing complexities of the [[information age]], consultants and executives have found the term useful to describe the [[Business process modeling|design of business processes]] as well as [[manufacturing|manufacturing processes]].

The youths were stereotyped as gangsters (also called ''mangupi''), involved in illegal activities{{sfn|NOIZZ 2017}} such as fuel smuggling.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4164">The acronyms '''ELSI''' (in the United States) and '''ELSA''' (in Europe) refer to research activities that anticipate and address '''''ethical, legal and social implications''''' (ELSI) or '''''aspects''''' (ELSA) of emerging life sciences, notably [[genomics]] and [[nanotechnology]]. ELSI was conceived in 1988 when [[James Watson]], at the press conference announcing his appointment as director of the [[Human Genome Project]] (HGP), suddenly and somewhat unexpectedly declared that the ethical and social implications of genomics warranted a special effort and should be directly funded by the [[National Institutes of Health]].&lt;ref&gt;Cook-Deegan, R. 1994/1995. The gene wars: science, politics and the human genome. New York/London: Norton&lt;/ref&gt;

== Spread ==

Various ELSI or ELSA programs have been developed, in Canada,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.genomecanada.ca/en/ge3ls/&lt;/ref&gt; Europe&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/research/life/elsa/&lt;/ref&gt; and the Far East.&lt;ref&gt;Yoshizawa G. et al (2014) ELSI practices in genomic research in East Asia: implications for research collaboration and public participation. Genome Medicine 2014, 6:39  doi:10.1186/gm556&lt;/ref&gt; Overview:&lt;ref&gt;Chadwick R and Zwart H (2013) Editorial: From ELSA to responsible research and Promisomics. Life Sciences, Society and Policy 2013, 9:3&lt;/ref&gt;

# U.S.A.: Ethical, Legal and Social Implications (ELSI) (funding agency: NIH, 1990)
# Canada: Genomics-related Ethical, Environmental, Economic, Legal and Social Aspects (GE3LS) (funding agency: [[Genome Canada]], 2000)
# South-Korea: Ethical, Legal and Social Implications (ELSI) (funding: Government of South-Korea, 2001)
# United Kingdom: ESRC Genomics Network (EGN), including: Cesagen, Innogen, Egenis, Genomics Forum (funding agency: ESRC 2002)

# Norway: ELSA Program (funding agency: Research Council of Norway, 2002)
# Germany, Austria, Finland: ELSAGEN Transnational Research Programme (funding agencies: GEN-AU, FFG, DFG, Academy of Finland, 2008)

== Features ==

At least four features seem typical for an ELSA approach,&lt;ref&gt;Zwart H., Nelis A. (2009) What is ELSA genomics? Science and Society Series on convergence research. EMBO Reports 10 (6), 1-5.&lt;/ref&gt; namely: 
# proximity (closeness to or embedding in large-scale scientific programs); 
# early anticipation (of societal issues and potential controversies); 
# interactivity (encouraging stakeholders and publics to assume an active role in co-designing research agendas); 
# interdisciplinarity (bridging boundaries between research communities such as for instance [[bioethics]] and STS).

== Reception ==

The ELSA approach has been widely endorsed by academics studying the societal impact of science and technology, but also criticized. Michael Yesley, responsible for the US Department of Energy (DOE) part of the ELSI programme, claims that the ELSI Program was in fact a discourse of justification, selecting topics of ethics research that will facilitate rather than challenge the advance of genetic technology.&lt;ref&gt;Yesley M.S. (2005) What’s ELSI got to do with it? Bioethics and the human genome project. New Genetics and Society 27: 1–6, p. 4)&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, ELSA genomics as the handmaiden of genomics research. In Europe, in the context of the [[Horizon 2020]] program, ELSA-style research is now usually framed as [[Responsible Research and Innovation]].&lt;ref&gt;Zwart H., Landeweerd L., Van Rooij A. (2014). Adapt or perish? Assessing the recent shift in the European research funding arena from ‘ELSA’ to ‘RRI’. Life Sciences, Society and Policy. 10:11 (14 May 2014). doi:10.1186/s40504-014-0011-x.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Examples of academic journals open to publishing ELSA research results are ''New Genetics and Society'' (Taylor and Francis) and ''[[Life Sciences, Society and Policy]]'' (SpringerOpen).

'''Fenno-Filmi''' was a Finnish film production company.

The company was founded by film directors [[Yrjö Norta]] and [[Theodor Luts]] in 1942. Luts and Erkki Uotila were the co-directors of the first Fenno-Filmi production ''Salainen ase'' which premiered on 3 January 1943. ''Erehtyneet sydämet'' was released in April 1944, with Uotila and Eero Leväluoma sharing the director's credits. Later that year, Yrjö Norta directed a film ''Hiipivä vaara''. Norta directed five of Fenno-Filmi's 18 films.

[[Roland af Hällström]] made his first Fenno-Filmi effort ''Houkutuslintu'' in 1946. He soon became the head director for the company, a position which he later kept in [[Fennada-Filmi]] as well. [[Edvin Laine]], [[Jorma Nortimo]] and [[Teuvo Tulio]] were some of the other directors who worked for Fenno-Filmi.

The company was not able to produce commercially successful films and suffered from financial problems since the beginning. When [[Mauno Mäkelä]] became the head of the company in 1949, efforts were made to merge  the productions of Fenno-Filmi and [[Adams Filmi]]. This happened in 1950, and the new company was named Fennada-Filmi. The [[Finnish Broadcasting Company]] has been holding the rights to the Fenno-Filmi productions since 1982.

The '''National Flag of India''' is a horizontal rectangular tricolour of [[Saffron (color)#Deep saffron|India saffron]], [[white]] and [[Variations of green#India green|India green]]; with the ''{{lang|hi-Latn|[[Ashoka Chakra]]}}'', a 24-spoke wheel, in navy blue at its centre. It was adopted in its present form during a meeting of the [[Constituent Assembly]] held on 22 July 1947, and it became the official flag of the [[Dominion of India]] on 15 August 1947. The flag was subsequently retained as that of the Republic of India. In India, the term "[[tricolour (flag)|tricolour]]" ({{lang-hi|तिरंगा|translit='''Tiraṅgā'''&lt;!-- THIS Hindi SPELLING IS CORRECT: PLEASE SEE [[Wikipedia:Enabling complex text support for Indic scripts]] --&gt;}}) almost always refers to the Indian national flag. The flag is based on the ''{{lang|hi-Latn|Swaraj}}'' flag, a flag of the [[Indian National Congress]] designed by [[Pingali Venkayya]].&lt;ref group="N" name="PV"/&gt;

By law, the flag is to be made of ''{{lang|hi-Latn|[[khadi]]}}'', a special type of hand-spun cloth or silk, made popular by [[Mahatma Gandhi]]. The manufacturing process and specifications for the flag are laid out by the [[Bureau of Indian Standards]]. The right to manufacture the flag is held by the [[Khadi Development and Village Industries Commission]], who allocates it to regional groups. As of 2009, the [[Karnataka Khadi Gramodyoga Samyukta Sangha]] has been the sole manufacturer of the flag.

Usage of the flag is governed by the [[Flag Code of India]] and other laws relating to the national emblems. The original code prohibited use of the flag by private citizens except on national days such as the [[Independence Day (India)|Independence day]] and the [[Republic Day (India)|Republic Day]]. In 2002, on hearing an appeal from a private citizen, [[Naveen Jindal]], the [[Supreme Court of India]] directed the [[Government of India]] to amend the code to allow flag usage by private citizens. Subsequently, the [[Union Cabinet of India]] amended the code to allow limited usage. The code was amended once more in 2005 to allow some additional use including adaptations on certain forms of clothing. The flag code also governs the protocol of flying the flag and its use in conjunction with other national and non-national flags.

According to the [[Flag code of India]], the Indian flag has a ratio of two by three (where the length of the flag is 1.5 times that of the width).

The size of the Ashoka Chakra is not specified in the Flag code, but it has twenty-four spokes that are evenly spaced.&lt;ref name="Code2002"/&gt; In section 4.3.1 of "IS1: Manufacturing standards for the Indian Flag", there is a chart that details the size of the Ashoka Chakra on the nine specific sizes of the national flag.&lt;ref name='IS11968'/&gt; In both the Flag code and IS1, they call for the Ashoka Chakra to be printed or painted on both sides of the flag in navy blue.&lt;ref name='IS11968'/&gt;&lt;ref name="Code2002"/&gt; Below is the list of specified shades for all colours used on the national flag, with the exception of Navy Blue, from "IS1: Manufacturing standards for the Indian Flag" as defined in the 1931 CIE Colour Specifications with [[Standard illuminant#Illuminants B and C|illuminant C]].&lt;ref name='IS11968'&gt;{{Cite book | url = https://archive.org/details/gov.in.is.1.1968 | title = IS 1 : 1968 Specification for the national flag of India (cotton khadi) | accessdate = 2012-07-23 | author = Bureau of Indian Standards | date = 1968 | publisher = Government of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; The navy blue colour can be found in the standard IS:1803-1973.&lt;ref name='IS11968'/&gt;

[[File:Flag of India, New Delhi.jpg|thumb|Flag of India, New Delhi]]
Gandhi first proposed a flag to the Indian National Congress in 1921. The flag was designed by [[Pingali Venkayya]]. In the centre was a traditional spinning wheel, symbolising Gandhi's goal of making Indians self-reliant by fabricating their own clothing. The design was then modified to include a white stripe in the centre for other religious communities, and provide a background for the spinning wheel. Subsequently, to avoid sectarian associations with the colour scheme, saffron, white and green were chosen for the three bands, representing courage and sacrifice, peace and truth, and faith and chivalry respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| title = Flag of India| encyclopedia = [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]| publisher = Encyclopædia Britannica Online| year = 2009| url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1355310/flag-of-India| accessdate = 2 July 2009| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081215142903/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1355310/flag-of-India| archivedate = 15 December 2008| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few days before India became independent on 15 August 1947, the specially constituted [[Constituent Assembly]] decided that the flag of India must be acceptable to all parties and communities.&lt;ref name="FOTW" /&gt; A modified version of the ''Swaraj'' flag was chosen; the tricolour remained the same saffron, white and green. However, the ''charkha'' was replaced by the [[Ashoka Chakra]] representing the eternal wheel of law. The philosopher [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan]], who later became India's first [[Vice President of India|Vice President]] and second [[President of India|President]], clarified the adopted flag and described its significance as follows:

{{cquote|''Bhagwa'' or the [[Saffron (colour)|Saffron]] denotes renunciation or disinterestedness. Our leaders must be indifferent to material gains and dedicate themselves to their work. The white in the centre is light, the path of truth to guide our conduct. The green shows our relation to (the) soil, our relation to the plant life here, on which all other life depends. The "Ashoka Chakra" in the centre of the white is the wheel of the law of [[dharma]]. Truth or ''[[satya]]'', ''dharma'' or virtue ought to be the controlling principle of those who work under this flag. Again, the wheel denotes motion. There is death in stagnation. There is life in movement. India should no more resist change, it must move and go forward. The wheel represents the dynamism of a peaceful change.&lt;ref name=PIB&gt;{{cite web|title=Flag Code of India, 2002|url=http://pib.nic.in/feature/feyr2002/fapr2002/f030420021.html|website=Press Information Bureau|publisher=Government of India|date=3 April 2002|accessdate=23 November  2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150520211458/http://pib.nic.in/feature/feyr2002/fapr2002/f030420021.html|archivedate=20 May 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== History ==
A number of flags with varying designs were used in the period preceding the [[Indian Independence Movement]] by the rulers of different princely states; the idea of a single Indian flag was first raised by the British rulers of India after the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|rebellion of 1857]], which resulted in the establishment of direct imperial rule. [[Star of India (flag)|The first flag]], whose design was based on western heraldic standards, were similar to the flags of other British colonies, including Canada and South Africa; its red field included the [[Union Flag]] in the upper-left quadrant and a Star of India capped by the royal crown in the middle of the right half. To address the question of how the star conveyed "Indianness", [[Queen Victoria]] created the [[Knight Commander of the Order of the Star of India]] to honour services to the empire by her Indian subjects. Subsequently, all the [[British Raj#British India and the Native States|Indian princely states]] received flags with symbols based on the heraldic criteria of Europe including the right to fly defaced British red ensigns.&lt;ref name="Virmani172"&gt;{{Harvnb|Virmani|1999|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Roy|2006|p=498}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flaggenlexikon.de/findien.htm|title=British Raj Marineflagge|accessdate=2005-09-04|author=Volker Preuß|language=de|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050917132232/http://www.flaggenlexikon.de/findien.htm|archivedate=17 September 2005|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:British Raj Red Ensign.svg|left|thumb|alt=A British red Ensign (a red flag with the Union Jack placed at the top left corner) charged with the Star of India (five pointed star inside a circular band tied at the bottom)||[[Star of India (flag)|Flag of British India, 1880–1947]]]]

In the early twentieth century, around the coronation of [[Edward VII]], a discussion started on the need for a heraldic symbol that was representative of the Indian empire. William Coldstream, a British member of the Indian Civil Service, campaigned the government to change the heraldic symbol from a star, which he considered to be a common choice, to something more appropriate. His proposal was not well received by the government; [[Lord Curzon]] rejected it for practical reasons including the multiplication of flags.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Virmani|1999|p=173}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around this time, nationalist opinion within the realm was leading to a representation through religious tradition. The symbols that were in vogue included the [[Ganesha]], advocated by [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak]], and [[Kali]], advocated by [[Aurobindo Ghosh]] and [[Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay]]. Another symbol was the cow, or ''Gau Mata'' (cow mother). However, all these symbols were Hindu-centric and did not suggest unity with India's Muslim population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Virmani|1999|p=174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Flag of India 1907 (Nationalists Flag).svg|thumb|220px|Based on the [[Calcutta Flag]], design of the "Flag of Indian Independence" raised by [[Bhikaji Cama]] on 22 August 1907, at the International Socialist Conference in Stuttgart, Germany.]]
The [[partition of Bengal (1905)]] resulted in the introduction of a new flag representing the [[Indian independence movement]] that sought to unite the multitude of castes and races within the country. The ''Vande Mataram'' flag, part of the [[Swadeshi movement]] against the British, comprised Indian religious symbols represented in western heraldic fashion. The tricolour flag included eight white lotuses on the upper green band representing the eight provinces, a sun and a crescent on the bottom red band, and the ''Vande Mataram'' slogan in Hindi on the central yellow band. The flag was launched in [[Calcutta]] bereft of any ceremony and the launch was only briefly covered by newspapers. The flag was not covered in contemporary governmental or political reports either, but was used at the annual session of the [[Indian National Congress - Freedom Era|Indian National Congress]]. A slightly modified version was subsequently used by [[Madam Bhikaji Cama]] at the [[International Socialist Congress, Stuttgart 1907|second International Socialist Congress]] in [[Stuttgart]] in 1907. Despite the multiple uses of the flag, it failed to generate enthusiasm amongst Indian nationalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Virmani|1999|pp=175–176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the same time, another proposal for the flag was initiated by [[Sister Nivedita]], a Hindu reformist and disciple of [[Swami Vivekananda]]. The flag consisted of a thunderbolt in the centre and a hundred and eight oil lamps for the border, with the ''[[Vande Mataram]]'' caption split around the thunderbolt. It was also presented at the Indian National Congress meeting in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Roy|2006|pp=498–499}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon, many other proposals were initiated, but none of them gained attention from the nationalist movement.

In 1909, [[Oliver Russell, 2nd Baron Ampthill|Lord Ampthill]], former Governor of the [[Madras Presidency]], wrote to ''[[The Times]]'' of London in the run up to [[Empire Day]] pointing out that there existed "no flag representative of India as a whole or any Indian province... Surely this is strange, seeing that but for India there would be no Empire."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A Flag for India |work=Luton Times and Advertiser |date=21 May 1909 |accessdate=27 August 2015 |url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000536/19090521/002/0001| via = [[British Newspaper Archive]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1916, [[Pingali Venkayya]] submitted thirty new designs, in the form of a booklet funded by members of the High Court of [[Madras Presidency|Madras]]. These many proposals and recommendations did little more than keep the flag movement alive. The same year, [[Annie Besant]] and [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak]] adopted a new flag as part of the [[Indian Home Rule Movement|Home Rule Movement]]. The flag included the Union Jack in the upper left corner, a star and crescent in the upper right, and seven stars displayed diagonally from the lower right, on a background of five red and four green alternating bands. The flag resulted in the first governmental initiative against any nationalistic flag, as a magistrate in [[Coimbatore]] banned its use. The ban was followed by a public debate on the function and importance of a national flag.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Virmani|1999|pp=176–177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1920s, national flag discussions gained prominence across most British dominions following the peace treaty between Britain and Ireland. In November 1920, the Indian delegation to the [[League of Nations]] wanted to use an Indian flag, and this prompted the British Indian government to place renewed emphasis on the flag as a national symbol.

[[File:1921 India flag.svg|right|thumb|alt=A tricolour flag of white, green and red with a spinning wheel in the centre|Gandhi's Flag, introduced at the Congress meeting in 1921&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Roy|2006|p=504}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In April 1921, [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]] wrote in his journal ''[[Young India]]'' about the need for an Indian flag, proposing a flag with the ''charkha'' or spinning wheel at the centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Virmani|1999|pp=177–178}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of the spinning wheel was put forth by [[Lala Hansraj]], and Gandhi commissioned Pingali Venkayya to design a flag with the spinning wheel on a red and green banner, the red colour signifying Hindus and the green standing for Muslims. Gandhi wanted the flag to be presented at the Congress session of 1921, but it was not delivered on time, and another flag was proposed at the session. Gandhi later wrote that the delay was fortuitous since it allowed him to realise that other religions were not represented; he then added white to the banner colours, to represent all the other religions. Finally, owing to the religious-political sensibilities, in 1929, Gandhi moved towards a more secular interpretation of the flag colours, stating that red stood for the sacrifices of the people, white for purity, and green for hope.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Roy|2006|pp=503–505}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 April 1923, during a procession by local Congress volunteers in [[Nagpur]] commemorating the [[Jallianwala Bagh massacre]], the ''Swaraj'' flag with the spinning wheel, designed by Pingali Venkayya, was hoisted. This event resulted in a confrontation between the Congressmen and the police, after which five people were imprisoned. Over a hundred other protesters continued the flag procession after a meeting. Subsequently, on the first of May, [[Jamnalal Bajaj]], the secretary of the Nagpur Congress Committee, started the ''[[Flag Satyagraha]]'', gaining national attention and marking a significant point in the flag movement. The ''satyagraha'', promoted nationally by the Congress, started creating cracks within the organisation in which the Gandhians were highly enthused while the other group, the ''Swarajists'', called it inconsequential.

Finally, at the All India Congress Committee meeting in July, 1923, at the insistence of [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] and [[Sarojini Naidu]], Congress closed ranks and the flag movement was endorsed. The flag movement was managed by [[Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel]] with the idea of public processions and flag displays by common people. By the end of the movement, over 1500 people had been arrested across all of British India. ''[[The Bombay Chronicle]]'' reported that the movement drew from diverse groups of society including farmers, students, merchants, labourers and "national servants". While Muslim participation was moderate, the movement enthused women, who had hitherto rarely participated in the independence movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Virmani|1999|pp=181–186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the flag agitation got its impetus from Gandhi's writings and discourses, the movement received political acceptance following the Nagpur incident. News reports, editorials and letters to editors published in various journals and newspapers of the time attest to the subsequent development of a bond between the flag and the nation. Soon, the concept of preserving the honour of the national flag became an integral component of the independence struggle. While Muslims were still wary of the ''Swaraj'' flag, it gained acceptance among Muslim leaders of the Congress and the [[Khilafat Movement]] as the national flag.

[[File:1931 Flag of India.svg|left|thumb|alt=A tricolour flag of saffron, white and green with a spinning wheel in the centre|The ''Swaraj Flag'', officially adopted by the Indian National Congress in 1931&lt;ref&gt;NCERT Text book - CBSE - Class 10 - Social Science&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Detractors of the flag movement, including [[Motilal Nehru]], soon hailed the ''Swaraj'' flag as a symbol of national unity. Thus, the flag became a significant structural component of the institution of India. In contrast to the subdued responses of the past, the British Indian government took greater cognisance of the new flag, and began to define a policy of response. The British parliament discussed public use of the flag, and based on directives from England, the British Indian government threatened to withdraw funds from municipalities and local governments that did not prevent the display of the ''Swaraj'' flag.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Virmani|1999|pp=187–191}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Swaraj'' flag became the official flag of Congress at the 1931 meeting. However, by then, the flag had already become the symbol of the independence movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Roy|2006|p=508}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few days before India gained its independence in August 1947, the [[Constituent Assembly]] was formed. To select a flag for independent India, on 23 June 1947, the assembly set up an ''ad hoc'' committee headed by [[Rajendra Prasad]] and including [[Maulana Abul Kalam Azad]], [[Sarojini Naidu]], [[C. Rajagopalachari]], [[K. M. Munshi]] and [[B. R. Ambedkar]] as its members.

On 14 July 1947, the committee recommended that the flag of the [[Indian National Congress]] be adopted as the National Flag of India with suitable modifications, so as to make it acceptable to all parties and communities. It was also resolved that the flag should not have any communal undertones.&lt;ref name="Code2002"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pib.nic.in/feature/feyr2002/fapr2002/f030420021.html|title=Flag code of India, 2002|accessdate=11 October 2006|date=4 April 2002|work=Fact Sheet|publisher=Press Information Bureau, Government of India|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060522102724/http://pib.nic.in/feature/feyr2002/fapr2002/f030420021.html|archivedate=22 May 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spinning wheel of the Congress flag was replaced by the ''[[Dharmachakra|Chakra]]'' (wheel) from the [[Lion Capital of Ashoka]]. According to [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan]], the ''chakra'' was chosen as it was representative of ''[[dharma]]'' and law. However, Jawaharlal Nehru explained that the change was more practical in nature, as unlike the flag with the spinning wheel, this design would appear symmetrical. Gandhi was not very pleased by the change, but eventually came around to accepting it.

The flag was proposed by Nehru at the Constituent Assembly on 22 July 1947 as a horizontal tricolour of deep saffron, white and dark green in equal proportions, with the Ashoka wheel in blue in the centre of the white band. Nehru also presented two flags, one in Khadi-silk and the other in Khadi-cotton, to the assembly. The resolution was approved unanimously.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jha|2008|pp=106–107}}&lt;/ref&gt; It served as the [[national flag]] of the [[Dominion of India]] between 15 August 1947 and 26 January 1950, and has served as the flag of the [[India|Republic of India]] since then.&lt;ref name="FOTW"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/in.html|title=India|accessdate=11 October 2006|last=Heimer|first=Željko|date=2 July 2006|work=Flags of the World|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061018060420/http://crwflags.com/fotw/flags/in.html|archivedate=18 October 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Manufacturing process ==
[[File:Indian flag header.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Lettering written and printed on a canvas strip|A header of an Indian flag (size 6, date 2007/2008) certified by the [[Indian Standards Institute|ISI]]]]
The design and manufacturing process for the national flag is regulated by three documents issued by the [[Bureau of Indian Standards]] (BIS). All of the flags are made out of [[khadi]] cloth of silk or cotton. The standards were created in 1968 and were updated in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bis.org.in/sf/pow/txd.pdf |title=Indian Standards |accessdate=29 November 2008 |format=PDF |publisher=Bureau of Indian Standards |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080911040808/http://www.bis.org.in/sf/pow/txd.pdf |archivedate=11 September 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nine standard sizes of the flag are specified by law.&lt;ref name="NIC"/&gt;

In 1951, after India became a republic, the Indian Standards Institute (now the BIS) brought out the first official specifications for the flag. These were revised in 1964 to conform to the [[International System of Units|metric system]] which was adopted in India. The specifications were further amended on 17 August 1968.&lt;ref name="Code2002" /&gt; The specifications cover all the essential requirements of the manufacture of the Indian flag including sizes, dye colour, chromatic values, brightness, thread count and [[hemp]] [[rope|cordage]]. The guidelines are covered under civil and criminal laws and defects in the manufacturing process can result in punishments that include fines or jail terms.&lt;ref name="KVIC"&gt;{{cite news |first =Shyam Sundar|last =Vattam|url =http://www.deccanherald.com/deccanherald/jun152004/spt2.asp|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20060522230211/http://www.deccanherald.com/deccanherald/jun152004/spt2.asp|archivedate=22 May 2006|title =Why all national flags will be 'Made in Hubli'|newspaper =[[Deccan Herald]]|date =15 June 2004|accessdate =11 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Process"&gt;

[[Khadi]] or hand-spun cloth is the only material allowed to be used for the flag, and flying a flag made of any other material is punishable by law with imprisonment up to three years, besides a fine. Raw materials for khadi are restricted to cotton, silk and wool. There are two kinds of khadi used: The first is the khadi-bunting which makes up the body of the flag, and the second is the khadi-duck, which is a beige-coloured cloth that holds the flag to the pole. The khadi-duck is an unconventional type of weave that meshes three threads into a weave, compared to the two threads used in conventional weaving. This type of weaving is extremely rare, and there are fewer than twenty weavers in India professing this skill. The guidelines also state that there should be exactly 150 threads per square centimetre, four threads per stitch, and one square foot should weigh exactly {{convert|205|g}}.&lt;ref name="Code2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KVIC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Process"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/mag/2004/08/15/stories/2004081500450200.htm|title=The flag town|last=Chandaraju|first=Aruna|date=15 August 2004|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|accessdate=17 February 2010|location=Chennai, India|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090923163100/http://www.hindu.com/mag/2004/08/15/stories/2004081500450200.htm|archivedate=23 September 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are four places in the country licensed to make the cloth for the national flag, they are in [[Karnataka]], [[Marathwada]], [[Barabanki city|Barabanki]] in UP, and Banetha in [[Rajasthan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/the-tricolour-weavers-of-rajasthan-s-dausa-are-on-the-decline/story-KrfzBlv066HkbayzuDqCYN.html|title=The tricolour weavers of Rajasthan's Dausa are on the decline|date=11 February 2017|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170213164742/http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/the-tricolour-weavers-of-rajasthan-s-dausa-are-on-the-decline/story-KrfzBlv066HkbayzuDqCYN.html|archivedate=13 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The woven khadi is obtained from two handloom units in the [[Dharwad]] and [[Bagalkot]] districts of northern [[Karnataka]]. Currently, [[Karnataka Khadi Gramodyoga Samyukta Sangha]] based in [[Hubli]] is the only licensed flag production and supply unit in India.&lt;ref name="Process"/&gt; Permission for setting up flag manufacturing units in India is allotted by the Khadi Development and Village Industries Commission, though the BIS has the power to cancel the licences of units that flout guidelines.&lt;ref name="Code2002"/&gt; The hand-woven khadi for the National Flag was initially manufactured at [[Garag]], a small village in the Dharwad district. A Centre was established at Garag in 1954 by a few freedom fighters under the banner of Dharwad Taluk Kshetriya Seva Sangh and obtained the Centre's licence to make flags.&lt;ref name="Code2002"/&gt;

Once woven, the material is sent to the BIS laboratories for testing. After quality testing, the material, if approved, is returned to the factory. It is then separated into three lots which are dyed saffron, white and green. The Ashoka Chakra is screen printed, stencilled or suitably embroidered onto each side of the white cloth. Care also has to be taken that the chakra is completely visible and synchronised on both sides. Three pieces of the required dimension, one of each colour, are then stitched together according to specifications and the final product is ironed and packed. The BIS then checks the colours and only then can the flag be sold.&lt;ref name="KVIC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Process"/&gt;

Display and usage of the flag is governed by the Flag Code of India, 2002 (successor to the Flag Code&amp;nbsp;– India, the original flag code); the Emblems and Names (Prevention of Improper Use) Act, 1950; and the Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, 1971.&lt;ref name="Code2002"/&gt; Insults to the national flag, including gross affronts or indignities to it, as well as using it in a manner so as to violate the provisions of the Flag Code, are punishable by law with imprisonment up to three years, or a fine, or both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mha.nic.in/sites/upload_files/mha/files/pdf/Prevention_Insults_National_Honour_Act1971.pdf|title=The Prevention of Insults To National Honour Act, 1971|publisher=Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India|accessdate=30 August 2015|format=PDF|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170123231821/http://mha.nic.in/sites/upload_files/mha/files/pdf/Prevention_Insults_National_Honour_Act1971.pdf|archivedate=23 January 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Official regulation states that the flag must never touch the ground or water, or be used as a drapery in any form.&lt;ref name="Code2002"/&gt; The flag may not be intentionally placed upside down, dipped in anything, or hold any objects other than flower petals before unfurling. No sort of lettering may be inscribed on the flag. When out in the open, the flag should always be flown between sunrise and sunset, irrespective of the weather conditions. Prior to 2009, the flag could be flown on a public building at night under special circumstances; currently, Indian citizens can fly the flag even at night, subject to the restriction that the flag should be hoisted on a tall flagpole and be well-illuminated.&lt;ref name="Code2002"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-12-24/india/28074561_1_national-flag-flag-code-naveen-jindal|title=Now, Indians can fly Tricolour at night|last=[[Press Trust of India]]|date=24 December 2009|work=[[The Times of India]]|accessdate=10 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The flag should never be depicted, displayed or flown upside down. Tradition also states that when draped vertically, the flag should not merely be rotated 90degrees, but also reversed. One "reads" a flag like the pages of a book, from top to bottom and from left to right, and after rotation the results should be the same. It is considered insulting to display the flag in a frayed or dirty state, and the same rule applies to the flagpoles and halyards used to hoist the flag, which should always be in a proper state of maintenance.&lt;ref name="NIC"/&gt;

The original flag code of India did not allow private citizens to fly the national flag except on national days such as [[Independence Day (India)|Independence Day]] or [[Republic Day (India)|Republic Day]]. In 2001, [[Naveen Jindal]], an industrialist used to the more egalitarian use of the flag in the United States where he studied, flew the Indian flag on his office building. The flag was confiscated and he was warned of prosecution. Jindal filed a [[public interest litigation]] petition in the [[High Court of Delhi]]; he sought to strike down the restriction on the use of the flag by private citizens, arguing that hoisting the national flag with due decorum and honour was his right as a citizen, and a way of expressing his love for the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.rediff.com/news/2001/jun/13spec.htm|date = 13 June 2001|title = My Flag, My Country|accessdate = 15 November 2007|publisher = Rediff.com|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071121183544/http://www.rediff.com/news/2001/jun/13spec.htm|archivedate = 21 November 2007|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jindal"&gt;{{cite web | title= Union of India v.

At the end of the appeals process, the case was heard by the [[Supreme Court of India]]; the court ruled in Jindal's favour, asking the [[Government of India]] to consider the matter. The [[Union Cabinet of India]] then amended the Indian Flag Code with effect from 26 January 2002, allowing private citizens to hoist the flag on any day of the year, subject to their safeguarding the dignity, honour and respect of the flag.&lt;ref name="Code2002"/&gt; It is also held that the code was not a statute and restrictions under the code ought to be followed; also, the right to fly the flag is a qualified right, unlike the absolute rights guaranteed to citizens, and should be interpreted in the context of [[Part Nineteen of the Constitution of India|Article 19 of the Constitution of India]].&lt;ref name="Code2002"/&gt;

The original flag code also forbade use of the flag on uniforms, costumes and other clothing. In July 2005, the Government of India amended the code to allow some forms of usage. The amended code forbids usage in clothing below the waist and on undergarments, and forbids embroidering onto pillowcases, handkerchiefs or other dress material.&lt;ref name="Belt"&gt;{{cite news | author=Chadha, Monica | date=6 July 2005 | title=Indians can wear flag with pride | publisher=BBC | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/4656963.stm| accessdate=18 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Disposal of damaged flags is also covered by the flag code. Damaged or soiled flags may not be cast aside or disrespectfully destroyed; they have to be destroyed as a whole in private, preferably by burning or by any other method consistent with the dignity of the flag.&lt;ref name="NIC"/&gt;

=== Display ===
[[File:IndiaFlagTwoNations.png|thumb|upright|alt=The Indian flag and another flag on crossed poles; the Indian flag is at the left.|Placement protocol for the Indian flag with another country's flag]]

The rules regarding the correct methods to display the flag state that when two flags are fully spread out horizontally on a wall behind a podium, their [[hoist (flag)|hoists]] should be towards each other with the saffron stripes uppermost. If the flag is displayed on a short flagpole, this should be mounted at an angle to the wall with the flag draped tastefully from it. If two national flags are displayed on crossed staffs, the hoists must be towards each other and the flags must be fully spread out. The flag should never be used as a cloth to cover tables, lecterns, podiums or buildings, or be draped from railings.&lt;ref name="NIC"/&gt;

Whenever the flag is displayed indoors in halls at public meetings or gatherings of any kind, it should always be on the right (observers' left), as this is the position of authority. So when the flag is displayed next to a speaker in the hall or other meeting place, it must be placed on the speaker's right hand. When it is displayed elsewhere in the hall, it should be to the right of the audience. The flag should be displayed completely spread out with the saffron stripe on top. If hung vertically on the wall behind the podium, the saffron stripe should be to the left of the onlookers facing the flag with the hoist cord at the top.&lt;ref name="NIC"/&gt;

[[File:IndiaFlagParade.png|left|thumb|alt=Sketch of eight people carrying flags in a procession, the first and last persons have the India tricolour|A flag procession]]
The flag, when carried in a procession or parade or with another flag or flags, should be on the marching right or alone in the centre at the front. The flag may form a distinctive feature of the unveiling of a statue, monument, or plaque, but should never be used as the covering for the object. As a mark of respect to the flag, it should never be [[Flag dipping|dipped]] to a person or thing, as opposed to regimental colours, organisational or institutional flags, which may be dipped as a mark of honour. During the ceremony of hoisting or lowering the flag, or when the flag is passing in a parade or in a review, all persons present should face the flag and stand at attention. Those present in uniform should render the appropriate salute. When the flag is in a moving column, persons present will stand at attention or salute as the flag passes them. A dignitary may take the salute without a head dress. The flag salutation should be followed by the playing of the [[Jana Gana Mana|national anthem]].&lt;ref name="NIC"/&gt;

[[File:India-0037 - Red Fort (2214262369).jpg|300px|right|thumb|Indian Flag at the [[Red Fort]], Delhi]]
The privilege of flying the national flag on vehicles is restricted to the President, the Vice-President or the Prime Minister, [[Governors of states of India|Governors and Lieutenant Governors]] of states, [[Chief Minister (India)|Chief Ministers]], [[Union Council of Ministers of India|Union Ministers]], members of the [[Parliament of India]] and [[States of India|state legislatures]] of the [[States and territories of India|Indian states]] ([[Vidhan Sabha]] and [[Vidhan Parishad]]), judges of the [[Supreme Court of India]] and [[List of High Courts of India|High Courts]], and [[flag officer]]s of the [[Indian Army|Army]], [[Indian Navy|Navy]] and [[Indian Air Force|Air Force]]. The flag has to be flown from a staff affixed firmly either on the middle front or to the front right side of the car. When a foreign dignitary travels in a car provided by government, the flag should be flown on the right side of the car while the flag of the foreign country should be flown on the left side.&lt;ref name="Code2002"/&gt;

The flag should be flown on the aircraft carrying the President, the Vice-President or the Prime Minister on a visit to a foreign country. Alongside the National Flag, the flag of the country visited should also be flown; however, when the aircraft lands in countries en route, the national flags of the respective countries would be flown instead. When carrying the president within India, aircraft display the flag on the side the president embarks or disembarks; the flag is similarly flown on trains, but only when the train is stationary or approaching a railway station.&lt;ref name="NIC"/&gt;

When the Indian flag is flown on Indian territory along with other national flags, the general rule is that the Indian flag should be the starting point of all flags. When flags are placed in a straight line, the rightmost flag (leftmost to the observer facing the flag) is the Indian flag, followed by other national flags in alphabetical order. When placed in a circle, the Indian flag is the first point and is followed by other flags alphabetically. In such placement, all other flags should be of approximately the same size with no other flag being larger than the Indian flag. Each national flag should also be flown from its own pole and no flag should be placed higher than another. In addition to being the first flag, the Indian flag may also be placed within the row or circle alphabetically. When placed on crossed poles, the Indian flag should be in front of the other flag, and to the right (observer's left) of the other flag. The only exception to the preceding rule is when it is flown along with the [[flag of the United Nations]], which may be placed to the right of the Indian flag.&lt;ref name="NIC"/&gt;

When the Indian flag is displayed with non-national flags, including corporate flags and advertising banners, the rules state that if the flags are on separate staffs, the flag of India should be in the middle, or the furthest left from the viewpoint of the onlookers, or at least one flag's breadth higher than the other flags in the group. Its flagpole must be in front of the other poles in the group, but if they are on the same staff, it must be the uppermost flag. If the flag is carried in procession with other flags, it must be at the head of the marching procession, or if carried with a row of flags in line abreast, it must be carried to the marching right of the procession.&lt;ref name="NIC"/&gt;

=== Half-mast ===
The flag should be flown at [[half-staff|half-mast]] as a sign of mourning. The decision to do so lies with the President of India, who also decides the period of such mourning. When the flag is to be flown at half mast, it must first be raised to the top of the mast and then slowly lowered. Only the Indian flag is flown half mast; all other flags remain at normal height.

The flag is flown half-mast nationwide on the death of the president, Vice-president or prime minister. It is flown half-mast in New Delhi and the state of origin for the Speaker of the Lok Sabha, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, and Union Ministers. On deaths of Governors, Lt. Governors and Chief Ministers, the flag is flown at half-mast in the respective states and union territories.

The Indian flag cannot be flown at half-mast on Republic Day (26 January), Independence day (15 August), [[Gandhi Jayanti]] (2 October), National Week (6–13 April) or state formation anniversaries, except over buildings housing the body of the deceased dignitary. However, even in such cases, the flag must be raised to full-mast when the body is moved from the building.

Observances of State mourning on the death of foreign dignitaries are governed by special instructions issued from the Ministry of Home Affairs in individual cases. However, in the event of death of either the Head of the State or Head of the Government of a foreign country, the Indian Mission accredited to that country may fly the national flag at half-mast.

On occasions of state, military, central para-military forces funerals, the flag shall be draped over the bier or coffin with the saffron towards the head of the bier or coffin. The flag should not be lowered into the grave or burnt in the pyre.&lt;ref name="NIC"/&gt;

'''''God, the Devil and Bob''''' is an [[animated]] [[sitcom]] which premiered on [[NBC]] on March 9, 2000 and ended on March 28, 2000, leaving nine episodes unaired. It was created by [[Matthew Carlson]]. The entire series was released on [[DVD region code#Region codes and countries|Region 1]] [[DVD]] in the United States on January 4, 2005. Reruns of the series began airing on [[Cartoon Network]]'s late night programming block, [[Adult Swim]], on January 1, 2011 with the network airing the nine remaining episodes of the series from January 8 to March 26, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://boards.adultswim.com/t5/General-Adult-Swim-Discussion/Schedule-Update-11-22-10/m-p/57605239#U57605239 |title=Schedule Update - 11/22/10 - Adult Swim Message Boards |publisher=Boards.adultswim.com |date= |accessdate=2015-10-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312085845/http://boards.adultswim.com/t5/General-Adult-Swim-Discussion/Schedule-Update-11-22-10/m-p/57605239#U57605239 |archive-date=2012-03-12 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adultswim.com/schedule/onair.html |title=Schedule |publisher=Adult Swim |date=2014-07-14 |accessdate=2015-10-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62BpuCbyU?url=http://www.adultswim.com/schedule/onair.html |archivedate=2011-10-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thirteen episodes were made, but only four were broadcast in the United States before the series was canceled due to a combination of low ratings and pressure from religious activists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= God, the Devil and Bob |publisher= Entertainment Weekly|date=January 10, 2005|url= http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1015134,00.html|accessdate=2010-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= God, the Devil and a boycott |publisher= BBC|date=2000-03-18|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/special_report/1999/03/99/tom_brook/681071.stm|accessdate=2010-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= BBC buys animated sitcom that shook US |publisher= Guardian|date=2000-10-19|url= https://www.theguardian.com/media/2000/oct/19/broadcasting.bbc1|accessdate=2010-08-29 | location=London | first=Matt | last=Wells}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Viewers find nbc's 'god' offensive |publisher= New York Daily News|date=2000-03-13|url= http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/2000/03/13/2000-03-13_viewers_find_nbc_s__god__off.html|accessdate=2010-08-29}} {{Dead link|date=January 2012|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show, however, was well received in places such as the United Kingdom, Ireland, and [[Latin America]] (including [[Brazil]]), where [[BBC Two]], [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]], and [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], respectively, aired the entire series. It was once broadcast on the now-defunct Philippine channel [[Maxxx]].

==Synopsis==
The series was based on [[God]] (voiced by [[James Garner]]) and the [[Devil]] (voiced by [[Alan Cumming]]) making a bet over the fate of the world. God wants to wipe humanity off the face of the planet and start over, but he realizes that he's "not that kind of God." The Devil gets to choose one person,  and if that person does not prove they have made the world a better place, God will destroy the world. The Devil chooses Bob Allman (voiced by [[French Stewart]]), a [[beer]]-drinking, [[pornography|porno]]-watching auto plant worker from the suburbs of [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]] who, when asked to save humanity from complete annihilation, asks "What's in it for me?" After saving humanity in the [[television pilot|pilot episode]], the series revolves around Bob being God's "Go-To Guy" whenever he gets a great idea to help out the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= God and the Devil join BBC |publisher= BBC|date=2000-10-19|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/979834.stm|accessdate=2010-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= 'god' shows nbc's new faith in animation |publisher= New York Daily News|date=2000-03-12|url= http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/2000/03/12/2000-03-12__god__shows_nbc_s_new_faith_.html|accessdate=2010-08-29}} {{Dead link|date=January 2012|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characters==
* God (voiced by [[James Garner]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Garner Truly Thanks God For His Latest Starring Role |publisher= Chicago Tribune|date=2000-02-25|url= http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2000-02-25/features/0002250002_1_devil-and-bob-james-garner-voice-of-bart-simpson|accessdate=2010-08-29|first=Bonnie|last=Churchill}}&lt;/ref&gt; - The laid-back, beer-drinking deity, whose human appearance is visually styled on [[Jerry Garcia]] of [[The Grateful Dead]]. Though he is distressed with the state of the world and is considering destroying it and starting over, even going so far as to design a new universe where marsupials replace humanity and humanity "is somewhere down the food chain", he wants to give humanity a sporting chance. Though he and the Devil appear to have put much of their differences behind them, and are frequently seen socializing, God has a habit of constantly forgetting the devil's birthday. He often wears sunglasses and drinks light beer. He enjoys poptarts and spacefood sticks because of their convenience. Though he is normally invisible to everyone but Bob, children can also see him. He has guidance over people's souls until they are 12.
* The Devil (also known as Lucifer) (voiced by [[Alan Cumming]]) - The Devil is trying to persuade God to destroy the world, and is constantly trying to thwart Bob in his attempts to save it. He is a [[margarita]] drinker and drives a purple [[Dodge Charger (B-body)|Dodge Charger]] described by Bob as the "coolest car [he's] ever seen". Despite appearances, the Devil is needy and co-dependent, often reduced to tears when God ignores, or forgets about, him to the point he planned to go to war with Heaven when God forgot their golf outing. He also goes into vicious rants when he loses a game (i.e. bowling with God). He has influence over people's souls from the ages of 12-20. [[Robert Downey, Jr.]] was originally cast to voice the Devil, but was forced to pull out because of his relapse into drug addiction.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}
* Bob Allman (voiced by [[French Stewart]]) - The [[pornography]]-watching, under-educated prophet/messenger of God. He is an auto plant worker from [[Detroit]], and is a huge fan of the [[Detroit Red Wings|Red Wings]]. Despite his numerous failings, God has faith in him and Bob eventually pulls through. He is very unsure of being qualified or capable to save the world. He clearly loves his family and goes to extreme lengths to keep them safe. As the series progresses, Bob appears to start to be on friendly terms with both God and the Devil, though the latter is still frequently antagonistic towards Bob.
* Donna Allman (voiced by [[Laurie Metcalf]]) - Bob's wife who is constantly trying her best to be a good mother. She doesn't believe Bob's claims that he is working for God and thinks he must be delusional. She has recently returned to college after 14 years of parenting.
* Megan Allman  (voiced by [[Nancy Cartwright]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Bart Simpson's Voice Eager For New Challenge |publisher= Chicago Tribune|date=2000-03-08|url= http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2000-03-08/features/0003080007_1_todd-flanders-bart-simpson-cartwright|accessdate=2010-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; - Bob and Donna's 13-year-old daughter and eldest child. She is overly rebellious, insistent, very stubborn, bad-tempered and unruly, yet loves her family… very deep down. She's also a bit of a hypocrite, as just after stating that their family doesn't do anything, she blows off family dinner to phone a friend.
* Andy Allman (voiced by [[Kath Soucie]]) - Bob and Donna's 6-year-old son. He is a sweet, good-natured boy who looks up to his father. He is the only person who really believes Bob talks to God and the Devil. At one point in the beginning of the show, he actually sees God.
* Smeck (voiced by [[Jeff Doucette]]) - An [[imp]]-like demon who is the Devil's put-upon henchman apprentice. In spite of the abuse he suffers at the Devil's hands, he remains loyal to his master. It is suggested in an early episode that he is among the oldest demons in hell. In episode seven, we learn the Devil would fire him were it not for his union and would kill him if he had not promised Smeck's mother on her deathbed.

'''Incest''' is a popular topic in English [[erotic fiction]]; there are entire collections and websites devoted solely to [[incest]], and there exists an entire genre of pornographic [[Pulp fiction (genre)|pulp fiction]] known as "incest novels". Incest is sometimes mentioned or described in mainstream, non-erotic fiction. Connotations can be negative, positive, or neutral.

* British musician [[Kate Bush]]'s song "[[The Kick Inside]]" from her 1978 album of the same name depicts an incestuous relationship, pregnancy and suicide involving a brother and sister.

* The German [[Heavy metal music|metal]] band [[Rammstein]] touches on incest in "[[Spiel mit mir]]", ("Play with me"), featuring an incestuous relationship between brothers. In "''Spiel mit mir''", the older brother apparently forces himself on his younger brother for sex so he will be able to sleep. Rammstein has written other songs dealing with incest including "Laichzeit" ("Spawn time") and "Tier" ("Animal").

* The so-called "Mamasan Trilogy" by [[Seattle]] rockers [[Pearl Jam]] tells the story of a man's incestuous relationship with his mother and the subsequent unfolding events. The trilogy begins with "[[Alive (Pearl Jam song)|Alive]]", which singer Eddie Vedder explains as being part autobiographical and part fiction.{{cn|date=October 2018}} When Eddie was a teenager, his mother revealed to him that the man he thought was his father was actually his stepfather, and his biological father was dead. It is the first piece to a trilogy of songs: "Alive", "Once" and "Footsteps." "Alive" tells a story of incest, which leads to the murderous killing spree described in "Once", and eventually looking back from a prison cell in "Footsteps".

* The song "This Love is Fucking Right" by [[The Pains of Being Pure at Heart]] is about a consensual romantic relationship between a brother and sister.

* [[The Prize Fighter Inferno]] released a song titled "Our Darling Daughter You Are, Little Cecillia Marie" on the album ''[[My Brother's Blood Machine]]'', detailing a case of habitual father/daughter molestation, resulting in her attempted murder of her father.

* "[[Embryo (Dir En Grey song)|Embryo]]" by the Japanese band [[Dir En Grey]] is about a mother dying and the father raping the daughter. At the end of the song, the girl kills the father and discovers she is pregnant with his child.

* The song ''[[Lemon Incest]]'' by Charlotte and Serge Gainsbourg is a song and music video about an incestuous relationship between a father and his daughter, which caused controversy because the singers themselves were father and daughter, and it caused suspicions that the song may be autobiographical. Stirring the pot, the single cover is a picture of the half-clothed Serge with his daughter Charlotte lying across his chest. However, the Gainsbourgs denied these allegations and the song became very popular in France.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

The '''International Pool Tour''' was a professional sports tour created in 2005 by [[Kevin Trudeau]] and hosted by [[Rebecca Grant (American actress)|Rebecca Grant]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dir.salon.com/story/books/feature/2005/07/29/trudeau/index.html "What Kevin Trudeau doesn't want you to know"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110906000000/http://dir.salon.com/story/books/feature/2005/07/29/trudeau/index.html |date=September 6, 2011 }}, ''Salon.com'', July 29, 2005.  Retrieved October 27, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; It aimed to elevate [[Pool (cue sports)|pool]] (pocket billiards) to the level of other modern sports. Closely modeled on the [[PGA Tour]], the IPT offered the largest prize funds in pool history in its first year. The tour attracted the top pool players in the world. It differed from the many [[nine-ball]] tournaments, as all IPT events were [[eight-ball]] matches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.internationalpooltour.com/ipt_content/ipt_players/bio/l_jones.asp Loree Jon Jones Player Bio] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018075947/http://www.internationalpooltour.com/ipt_content/ipt_players/bio/l_jones.asp |date=October 18, 2007 }}, ''InternationalPoolTour.com''.

Many pool enthusiasts were initially skeptical, but the first event was successful, and at the time was the biggest tournament in billiards history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buzzle.com/editorials/12-11-2005-83690.asp "IPT Pool Tour Goes Off With a Bang"],{{dead link|date=September 2014}} by Pete Williams, ''Buzzle.com'', December 11, 2005.

*The first IPT event, the "World 8-Ball Championship" was held at Mandalay Bay in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]]. It was an [[Exhibition game|exhibition match]] between [[Mike Sigel]] and [[Loree Jon Jones]] in 2005. For their participation, Sigel (winner) won $150,000 and Jones (loser) won $75,000. The prize money drew attention due to the fact that these payouts for an exhibition match were bigger than winning prizes from major championships.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azbilliards.com/2000pressrelease.cfm?id=432 "8-Ball Legends to Compete in World Championship Match: New Pool Tour Launches with Biggest Prize Money In History of Sport"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613195153/http://www.azbilliards.com/2000pressrelease.cfm?id=432 |date=June 13, 2011 }}, ''AzBilliards.com'', Las Vegas, Nevada, July 21, 2005.

[[BCA Hall of Fame]]rs in attendance received $30,000 just for showing up. [[Efren Reyes]] defeated Sigel in the finals and pocketed $200,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.professorqball.com/viewpress.php?RecordID=46 "Magician is King of the Hill"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071106102641/http://www.professorqball.com/viewpress.php?RecordID=46 |date=November 6, 2007 }}, ''ProfessorQball.com''. Retrieved June 25, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; All of the 165 matches were filmed and were later available for sale as DVDs.&lt;ref&gt;''Kevin Trudeau Speaks'', November 29, 2005, Orlando, Florida. Retrieved June 25, 2007{{Clarify|date=August 2007}}&lt;!--I this a book, or what?--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The total prize money paid out was $1,125,000, which made it the biggest pool event in history. Select matches from the tournament were turned into a weekly TV series that had a dedicated time slot, in prime time, on Versus (then OLN).
*IPT North American Open- 2006: the first full field IPT tournament consisting of 200 players from more than 40 countries. The North American Open paid out $2,000,000 in prize money, and was held at the Venetian, Las Vegas. The tournament was broadcast live in Europe for one week straight in prime time, a first for the billiards industry. Select matches from this event were turned into the second weekly TV series, in a dedicated time slot in prime time, on Versus (then OLN).
*IPT World Open- 2006: the second full field IPT tournament consisting of 200 players from more than 40 countries. The World Open advertised a $3,000,000 prize fund. The IPT offered live coverage of the tournament daily through streaming video. At the conclusion of the tournament, players were told that the prize checks were not on site and that they would be sent in the mail shortly. However, the IPT had run into major financial problems due to the lack of sponsorship and other failed financing options. Players and fans were outraged, but tour management insisted that players would be paid in full. Ultimately, the players were paid in full, but it took nine installments of 11% each to finally pay the players. The nine installments were paid over a 14-month period.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

The IPT was not in a financial position to continue hosting large world-class events, so they shifted their strategy to live streaming matches that pitted the best players against each other. These professionally produced events started around the same time as the final payment installment was sent to the players from the World Open. The IPT cited these matches as promotional and their intent was to promote the sport and build up web traffic once again in order to deploy a new strategy.

*IPT Ultimate 8-Ball- Earl Strickland vs. Johnny Archer, December 19, 2007: two of the biggest names in professional pool played in a race to 15 of 8-ball. The event streamed for free and it was reported that it drew a large live audience. The winner (Archer) received a $5,000 cash prize, and Strickland received $1,000 for his efforts. IPT paid each player's expenses.
*IPT Ultimate 8-Ball- Corey Deuel vs. Francisco Bustamante, January 23, 2008: the second of the challenge matches was also streamed free and drew a large audience. The winner (Bustamante) was paid $5,000 plus expenses and the loser (Deuel) received $1,000 plus expenses for his performance.
*IPT Ultimate 8-Ball- Marlon Manalo vs. Rodney Morris, March 4, 2008: the third of the live challenge matches was streamed free and drew a very large audience. Manalo won $5,000 plus expenses for winning the match. Morris won $1,000 plus expenses for his performance. This match also marked the approximate launch of Rodney Morris's new energy drink "Extreme Focus," which is now being promoted globally.
*IPT Ultimate 14.1 Straight Pool, April 29, 2008: the IPT decided to feature an undercard match of 14.1 straight pool, which marked the first time the IPT ever played anything other than 8-ball. The match featured reigning World Champion Oliver Ortmann and John Schmidt who was arguably one of the best straight pool players in the world. Schmidt won the match and $3,000 plus expenses. Ortmann received $1,000 plus expenses for his performance.
*IPT Ultimate 8-Ball, April 29, 2008: the IPT chose to allow fan voting to determine the contestants of this 8-ball match. The crowd favorite was Efren Reyes. His opponent was a shock to the world as the fans responded to the call for help from teenager Austin Murphy, a gifted young player from California. Reyes easily won the match and $5,000 plus expenses. Murphy won $1,000 plus expenses for his performance.
*IPT Ultimate 14.1 Straight Pool, June 2008: John Schmidt won in his last victory the chance to defend his win against Hall of Fame legend Mike Sigel. Most fans agreed that Sigel was past his prime and posed no threat to Schmidt's mastery. Much to the surprise of the world, Sigel played nearly perfect pool and handled Schmidt, who was visibly impressed by Sigel's game. Sigel won $3,000 plus expenses, and Schmidt won $1,000 plus expenses for his performance.
*IPT Ultimate 8-Ball, June 2008: In this eight ball match, English player Karl Boyes was originally supposed to play Alex Pagulayan. At the last moment, Pagulayan's manager contacted the IPT to inform them that he had lost his passport and that he would not be able to attend. IPT management called Tony Robles and asked him to fill in for Pagulayan. Robles accepted and flew from New York to L.A. in the middle of the night in order to make it to the match on time. Robles played well and beat Boyes in a close match. Robles won $5,000 plus expenses, and Boyes won $1,000 plus expenses for his performance. The match was attended by celebrity [[Joe Rogan]].

==Other information==
In the era of pool champions [[Willie Mosconi]] and [[Irving Crane]], the standard dress code for professional pool saw players dressed in tuxedos when competing, but beginning in the 1970s, the dress code had relaxed in competition with contenders wearing sneakers, baseball caps, T-shirts, and blue jeans. Trudeau re-established a dress code for the IPT members and required all IPT members and competitors to adhere to it, to project a better image for pool. All male pool players were required to wear suits, long-sleeved shirts, and leather shoes.

In the events Trudeau refused to follow some of the rules normally required by pool's governing bodies, in particular the policy that all prize money be held in escrow.

==Demise==
The initial three events in 2005 and early 2006 were successful, but at the fourth, the IPT World Open tournament in [[Reno, Nevada]], promoters announced that they did not have sufficient funds on hand to cover the purse.  Winners were assured that they would receive their prizes in small installments, but most were never paid.  The Reno fiasco marked the demise not only of IPT, but of professional pool competitions in general.  As one commentator put it, "The pool hustler wasn’t murdered by any single suspect, but the last man holding the knife was Kevin Trudeau."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=L Jon Wertheim

The '''Italian Cultural Institute, London''' ({{lang-it|Istituto Italiano di Cultura}}) is based at 39 [[Belgrave Square]] in [[Belgravia]], [[London]]. The institute promotes [[Italy|Italian]] culture and organises events at its own premises including exhibitions, concerts and meetings. It also supports the learning of Italian language through the set-up of group lessons. It deals with many actvities elsewhere in [[United Kingdom|UK]]. There are a library, an internal café and other facilities available for those who are involved in its activities. Various types of membership are available for individuals and organisations.

There are other Italian Cultural Institutes around the world in major cities (six in [[Europe]], four in the [[United States]], three in [[Canada]], five in [[Central America|Central]]/[[South America]] and two in [[Australia]]).&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20060527220541/http://www.italcultny.org/linkpages/otheriic.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Hugh Arnold''' (born 1969) is a British historian. Since 2016, he has been the [[Professor of Medieval History (Cambridge)|Professor of Medieval History]] at the [[University of Cambridge]]. He previously worked at [[Birkbeck College]], [[University of London]], where he specialised in the study of medieval religious culture. He has also written widely on historiography and why history matters.&lt;ref name="bio Faculty"&gt;{{cite web|title=Professor John H. Arnold|url=https://www.hist.cam.ac.uk/directory/professor-john-arnold|website=Faculty of History|publisher=University of Cambridge|accessdate=11 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Born 28 November 1969, Arnold received his [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in history and his [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degree in medieval studies from the [[University of York]]. He was professor of medieval history at Birkbeck College, University of London, from 2008. He joined the college as a lecturer in 2001. Before that he was a lecturer at the [[University of East Anglia]]. He is a member of the [[Social History Society]] and the [[Medieval Academy of America]].&lt;ref name=birk&gt;[http://www.bbk.ac.uk/history/our-staff/full-time-academic-staff/professor-john-arnold Professor John Arnold.] Birkbeck College. Retrieved 19 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Arnold specialises in the study of medieval religious culture, saying that while he has never been a believer in any religion, "belief" has always fascinated him. In his work he asks "Why do people believe the things they believe? What does 'believing' really mean in practice?"&lt;ref name=birk/&gt; Arnold has also written widely about [[historiography]]. In 2008 he wrote a policy paper, ''Why history matters - and why medieval history also matters'', for [[History &amp; Policy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historyandpolicy.org/policy-papers/papers/why-history-matters-and-why-medieval-history-also-matters ''Why history matters - and why medieval history also matters''] John H.

The '''Ladybird of Szeged''' or '''Ladybug of Szeged''' ([[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]: ''Szegedi Katicabogár'' or just ''Szegedi Katica'') is an early [[robot]] which was developed in [[Hungary]] at the Cybernetics Laboratory of the [[University of Szeged]] (SZTE) between 1956 and 1957.&lt;ref name="Ajovomultja"&gt;{{cite web |title= Szegedi Katicabogár |url= http://ajovomultja.hu/szegedi-katicabogar |website= A jövő múltja |publisher= Informatika Történeti Múzeum Alapítvány (ITMA) |accessdate= 3 Jul 2017 |language= Hungarian }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SzegedMa"&gt;{{cite web |last1= Illés |first1= Attila |title= Számítógép-evolúció költözik a Szegórába + fotók |url= http://szegedma.hu/hir/szeged/2012/06/szamitogep-evolucio-koltozik-az-agoraba_fotok.html |website= Szeged Ma |publisher= Napfénymédia és Marketing/Leonardo |accessdate= 3 Jul 2017 |date= 9 June 2012 |language= Hungarian }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SZTEInf-tort"&gt;{{cite web |last1= Braun |first1= Ákos |title= A Szegedi Katicabogár – Történet |url= http://www.inf.u-szeged.hu/~csendes/katica/honlap/tortenet.htm |website= A Szegedi Katicabogár |publisher= [[University of Szeged|Szegedi Tudományegyetem]] (SZTE) Természettudományi és Informatikai Kar (TTIK) Informatikai Intézet |accessdate= 3 Jul 2017 |language= Hungarian }}&lt;/ref&gt; The roughly [[Sphere|hemispherical]] machine has a red shell with black dots, resembling a [[Coccinellidae|ladybird]] (or ladybug), hence its name. The Ladybird is one of the first Hungarian robots, and the first robotic animal ever constructed.&lt;ref name="SZTEInf-tort" /&gt; It was designed and built by Dr. [[Dániel Muszka]], with the main intention of emulating [[Ivan Pavlov|Pavlovian]] [[Classical conditioning|conditional reflexes]] in a machine.&lt;ref name="Ajovomultja" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SZTEInf-tort" /&gt;

The original Ladybird is still in working condition (although its original [[papier-mâché]] shell has been replaced due to deterioration), and can be found in the [[Informatics History Exhibition]] (ITK) in [[Szeged]]. The exhibition have chosen the machine to be its symbolic mascot.&lt;ref name="Ajovomultja" /&gt; Muszka built two working replicas of the robot in the 2000s, one is in the ITK as well, the other is in the Technical Study Stores of the [[Hungarian Technical and Transportation Museum]] (MMKM) in [[Budapest]]. The Ladybird is considered an early milestone in Hungarian [[cybernetics]] and [[information technology]].

== Conception and name ==

Muszka was inspired to build a demonstration robot by the idea of psychologist József Király.&lt;ref name="Ajovomultja" /&gt;

The machine is variously referred to as ''Szegedi Katicabogár'' ([[Coccinellidae|ladybird]]/ladybug of [[Szeged]]), ''Szegedi Katica'' (using a shorter word for ladybird) or just ''Katica'' (ladybird) in Hungarian sources, with various capitalizations. English-language sources tend to use either Ladybird (UK) or Ladybug (US), depending on the variety of English used. Nonetheless all of these names refer to the original robot, not to any of the replicas.

== Structure ==

The Ladybird is a roughly [[Sphere|hemispherical]] robot which is {{convert|40|cm|in|abbr=on}} wide, {{convert|25|cm|in|abbr=on}} tall and {{convert|60|cm|in|abbr=on}} long.&lt;ref name="SZTEInf-tort" /&gt; It has a metal baseplate on which the electronics lie, which are enclosed by a red shell with black spots. This shell was originally varnished [[papier-mâché]], but due to deterioration, the Ladybird now has a plastic shell mimicking the original one. The black spots themselves are buttons, and the top of the shell also has a small sliding vane. The robot has two red "eyes" (which can light up but can't see), three [[Photodetector|photosensors]] (which can detect light) and a mechanical sensor in the front to detect collisions with obstacles. It also contains an electromechanical [[buzzer]] to give audible feedback. Due to the technical difficulties of the time, Muszka couldn't include a battery, and so the Ladybird gets the required electricity (220 V alternating current from the mains) using an umbilical power cable. The machine has three rubber wheels, two fixed wheels in front which are driven by automobile [[windscreen wiper]] motors, and a free-rotating [[Caster|caster wheel]] at the back. By design, the Ladybird is incapable of going in reverse.

== Operation ==

The Ladybird emulates basic [[phototaxis]] as well as [[Classical conditioning|conditional]] and unconditional reflexes. Phototaxis is exhibited by the machine's rudimentary ability to "follow" a sufficiently strong light source which shines into its [[photosensor]]s; the centre sensor turns on both motors to propel the robot forward, the left- and right-side sensors turn on only the opposite side's motor to effectively make the machine turn towards the light source. When turning or moving forward, the robot's "eyes" are fully alight, when it is stationary, they are just dimly lit.

Conditional reflexes are emulated by the Ladybird's ability to associate the "go" signal represented by the light source with a certain sound frequency (usually emitted by a nearby flute). If the front photosensor and the microphone both receives the right [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] for a certain amount of time (the "eyes" are flashing during this time), the robot gains the ability to move forward just by "hearing" the right frequency of sound. This "memory" fades away with time (as [[capacitor]]s drain out), or it can be erased by pressing any of the buttons (the black dots) on the shell.

Unconditional reflexes are emulated by the Ladybird's "refusal" to move in response to either light or sound stimuli when it "gets hurt", when any of its black dots are pressed. In this case it also "cries" using its buzzer, its "eyes" go fully dark, and it "forgets" about the conditioning. It can only be "soothed" and activated again by being "petted", by slightly pressing the sliding vane on top of the shell.

The Ladybird also "cries" and stops its motors when it hits an obstacle, such as the side walls of its demonstration pen.

The [[University of Szeged]]'s [[Java (programming language)|Java]] simulation of the Ladybird accurately mirrors the behaviour of the actual machine, except that the simulated robot can go in reverse.

The overall effect is such that, despite relatively fewer actual hair shafts compared to straight hair,&lt;ref name=pmid11531795&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2133.2001.04350.x |last=Loussouarn |first=G. |title=African hair growth parameters |journal=British Journal of Dermatology |volume=145 |issue=2 |pages=294–297 |date=August 2001 |pmid=11531795 |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&amp;sid=nlm:pubmed&amp;issn=0007-0963&amp;date=2001&amp;volume=145&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=294}}&lt;/ref&gt; this texture appears (and feels) denser than its straight counterparts. Due to this, it is often referred to as "thick", "bushy", or "woolly" in a derogatory manner and has been criticized for being "unpolished," "unkempt," or "unprofessional." Over the past decade, there has been a resurgence in the celebration of natural hair among Black African Americans.

'''Mary Morton Kehew''' (September 8, 1859 – February 13, 1918) was an American labor and social reformer. She was a president of the [[Women's Educational and Industrial Union]], a trustee of [[Simmons College]], and the first president of the [[National Women's Trade Union League]]. She was also active in the [[Women's suffrage in the United States|women's suffrage]] movement, and on behalf of the blind.

== Early life ==

Kehew was born Mary Morton Kimball in Boston, Massachusetts, on September 8, 1859. She was the fourth of eight children of Moses Day Kimball, a banker, and Susan Tillinghast Kimball (née Morton). Her maternal grandfather was former Massachusetts governor [[Marcus Morton]]. She was privately educated in Boston and in Europe. On January 8, 1880, she married William Brown Kehew, a wealthy oil merchant. The couple had no children.{{sfn|Commire|1999}}

== Career ==

Like many [[Boston Brahmin]] women, Kehew spent much of her time volunteering. Rather than focusing on charity work, however, she used her social position and political connections on behalf of working class women. Quiet and self-effacing, she preferred to work behind the scenes, lobbying legislators and soliciting donations from her wealthy friends.{{sfn|ABC-CLIO|2001|pp=353-354}}

In 1886, Kehew joined the Women's Educational and Industrial Union (WEIU), a cross-class organization dedicated to improving working conditions for women. She served as WEIU president from 1892 to 1913 and as chairman of its board of government from 1914 to 1918.{{sfn|Globe|February 14, 1918}} Under her leadership, the WEIU was transformed from a charity group to one focused on educating and organizing female workers. It provided legal advice, counseling, educational classes, and vocational training. Simmons College took on some of the WEIU's vocational training when it was founded in 1902; Kehew was on the college's first board of trustees.{{sfn|ABC-CLIO|2001|pp=353-354}} In 1905 she established the WEIU's research department, which conducted statistical studies on the lives of working women. This research was used to support legislative proposals pertaining to moneylending, pensions, sanitation, and the [[minimum wage]], and eventually led to the creation of the Massachusetts Department of Labor and Industry.{{sfn|ABC-CLIO|2001|pp=353-354}}

In 1894, with [[Mary Kenney O'Sullivan]], Kehew co-founded the Union for Industrial Progress, an auxiliary of the WEIU focused on trade unionism for women.{{sfn|Commire|1999}} Between 1896 and 1901, the group organized unions to defend the interests of laundry workers, bookbinders, and workers in the tobacco and garment industries.{{sfn|ABC-CLIO|2001|pp=353-354}}

In 1903 she became the first president of the National Women's Trade Union League, a group that supported the organization of labor unions and strove to eliminate sweatshop conditions for women.{{sfn|Commire|1999}}

She served on several legislative committees, investigating working conditions in Massachusetts, and provided financial and other support for various social reform organizations, including the Milk and Baby Hygiene Association, the Tyler Street Day Nursery, and [[Denison House (Boston)|Denison House]].{{sfn|Commire|1999}} She was active in the [[Women's suffrage in the United States|women's suffrage]] movement, worked on behalf of the blind, and served on the executive committee of the Massachusetts Child Labor Commission.{{sfn|Globe|February 14, 1918}}

== Death and memorials ==

She died of [[nephritis]]{{sfn|Commire|1999}} on February 13, 1918, at her home at 29 Chestnut Street in Boston. That April, the WEIU held a memorial service for her at Huntington Hall. Speakers included her friend and fellow reformer, [[Emily Greene Balch]], who remembered her as "the never failing fairy godmother" of Boston social and labor reform,{{sfn|Commire|1999}} and the director of the [[Ohio State School for the Blind]], who credited her with organizing "the first work to be conducted with the adult blind 15 years ago in her own office." John F. Tobin, a union leader, described her as a friend of the workingman whose "sympathies were always on the right side."{{sfn|Globe|April 15, 1918}}

Kehew is remembered on the [[Boston Women's Heritage Trail]] in connection with the WEIU.{{sfn|BWHT|Chinatown/South Cove}} She is also included in ''Nine Notable Women'', a mural painted by [[Ellen Lanyon]] in 1980. The nine notable women are [[Anne Hutchinson]], [[Phillis Wheatley]], Sister Ann Alexis,&lt;!-- Sister Ann Alexis (1805-1875), hospital founder and administrator for the Daughters of Charity --&gt; [[Lucy Stone]], [[Mary Baker Eddy]], [[Ellen S. Richards]], Mary Morton Kehew, [[Anne Sullivan]], and [[Melnea Cass]].{{sfn|BWHT|Back Bay West}}

'''Miyagegashi''', also {{nihongo|'''Miyagekashi'''|土産菓子||literally "souvenir sweet"}}, refers to a [[sweet]] made with the purpose of selling it as a [[souvenir]]. As with most other Japanese souvenirs ([[omiyage]]), the typical miyagegashi is a regional specialty ([[meibutsu]]), and cannot be bought outside its specific geographic area. The making and selling of omiyagegashi is an important part of Japan's [[omiyage]] (souvenir) industry.

      <comment>No, it is not. Most Christians today are Trinitarians, but not all of them. Historically speaking, Trinitarianism developed in late antiquity, several centuries after the beginning of Christianity, as one of several proposed solutions to the problem of the relationship between Jesus, God the Father, and the Holy Spirit, which is never actually clarified in the Bible itself. Christians before that time were still Christians, perhaps not "orthodox" Christians, but Christians nonetheless.</comment>

"Monotheism" Accessed 23 January 2013, http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/390101/monotheism&lt;/ref&gt;

Monotheism is distinguished from [[henotheism]], a religious system in which the believer worships one god without denying that others may worship different gods with equal validity, and [[monolatrism]], the recognition of the existence of many gods but with the consistent worship of only one deity.&lt;ref&gt;Frank E. Eakin, Jr. ''The Religion and Culture of Israel'' (Boston: Allyn and Bacon, 1971), 70.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "monolatry" was perhaps first used by [[Julius Wellhausen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mackintosh|first=Robert|year=1916|title=Monolatry and Henotheism|journal=Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics|volume=VIII|pages=810|url=https://archive.org/details/EncyclopaediaOfReligionAndEthics.Hastings-selbie-gray.13Vols|accessdate=Jan 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word ''[[:wikt:monotheism|monotheism]]'' comes from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|[[:wikt:μόνος|μόνος]]}} (''monos'')&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2368642 Monos], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', at Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; meaning "single" and {{lang|grc|[[:wikt:θεός|θεός]]}} (''theos'')&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2348292 Theos], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', at Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; meaning "[[Deity|god]]".&lt;ref&gt;The compound {{lang|el|μονοθεισμός}} is current only in [[Modern Greek]]. There is a single attestation of {{lang|grc|μονόθεον}} in a Byzantine hymn (''Canones Junii'' 20.6.43; A. Acconcia Longo and G. Schirò, ''Analecta hymnica graeca, vol. 11 e codicibus eruta Italiae inferioris''. Rome: Istituto di Studi Bizantini e Neoellenici. Università di Roma, 1978)&lt;/ref&gt; The English term was first used by [[Henry More]] (1614–1687).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=An Explanation of the Grand Mystery of Godliness |last=More |first=Henry |year=1660 |publisher= Flesher &amp; Morden |location=London |page= 62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
{{Primary sources|section|date=July 2017}}
Quasi-monotheistic claims of the existence of a universal deity date to the [[Late Bronze Age]], with [[Akhenaten]]'s ''[[Great Hymn to the Aten]]''. A possible inclination towards monotheism emerged during the [[Vedic period]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Sharma | first= Chandradhar | title= Indian Philosophy: A Critical Survey| publisher= Barnes &amp; Noble| location= New York | year= 1962 | page= vi | chapter= Chronological Summary of History of Indian Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Iron-Age South Asia. The [[Rigveda]] exhibits notions of [[monism]] of the [[Brahman]], particularly in the comparatively late [[Mandala 10|tenth book]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/rigveda/rv10190.htm HYMN CXC. Creation.]&lt;/ref&gt; which is dated to the early [[Iron Age]], e.g. in the [[Nasadiya sukta]]. 

Since the sixth century BCE, [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrians]] have believed in the supremacy of one God above all: [[Ahura Mazda]] as the "Maker of All"&lt;ref&gt;Yasna, XLIV.7&lt;/ref&gt; and the first being before all others.&lt;ref&gt;"First and last for all Eternity, as the Father of the Good Mind, the true Creator of Truth and Lord over the actions of life." (Yasna 31.8)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Vispanam Datarem", ''Creator of All'' (Yasna 44.7)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Data Angheush", ''Creator of Life'' (Yasna 50.11)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/zor/sbe23/sbe2330.htm NYÂYIS.]&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, Zoroastrianism was not strictly monotheistic&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Duchesne-Guillemin|first1=Jacques|title=Zoroastrianism|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Zoroastrianism|website=Britannica.com|publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica|accessdate=16 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; because it venerated other ''[[yazatas]]'' alongside Ahura Mazda. Ancient Hindu theology, meanwhile, was [[monist]], but was not strictly monotheistic in worship because it still maintained the existence of many gods, who were envisioned as aspects of one supreme God, [[Brahman]].&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt; Numerous ancient Greek philosophers, including [[Xenophanes of Colophon]] and [[Antisthenes]] believed in a similar polytheistic monism that came close to monotheism, but fell short.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt; Judaism was the first religion to conceive the notion of a personal monotheistic God within a monist context.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pBSJNDndGjwC&amp;pg=PA225#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=No Other Gods: Emergent Monotheism in Israel|first=Robert Karl|last=Gnuse|date=1 May 1997|publisher=Sheffield Academic Press|isbn=1-85075-657-0|page=225}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of [[ethical monotheism]], which holds that morality stems from God alone and that its laws are unchanging,&lt;ref name=EncyclopediaBritannica&gt;{{cite web|title=Ethical monotheism|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1770434/ethical-monotheism|website=britannica.com|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.|accessdate=25 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JVL&gt;{{cite web|last1=Prager|first1=Dennis|title=Ethical Monotheism|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/mono.html|website=jewishvirtuallibrary.org|publisher=American-Israeli Cooperative Enterprise|accessdate=25 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; first occurred in [[Judaism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fischer|first1=Paul|title=Judaism and Ethical Monotheism|url=https://blog.uvm.edu/pfischer/2013/10/27/judaism-and-ethical-monotheism/|website=platophilosophy|publisher=The University of Vermont Blogs|accessdate=16 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but is now a core tenet of most modern monotheistic religions, including Zoroastrianism, Christianity, Islam, Sikhism, and Bahá'í Faith.&lt;ref&gt;Nikiprowetzky, V. (1975). Ethical monotheism. (2 ed., Vol. 104, pp. 69-89). New York: The MIT Press Article Stable. {{jstor|20024331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Jewish, Christian and Islamic tradition, monotheism was the original religion of humanity; this original religion is sometimes referred to as "the Adamic religion", or, in the terms of [[Andrew Lang]], the "[[Urreligion]]". Scholars of religion largely abandoned that view in the 19th century in favour of an [[development of religion|evolutionary progression]] from [[animism]] via [[polytheism]] to monotheism, but by 1974 this theory was less widely held, and a modified view similar to Lang's became more prominent.&lt;ref name="odccmono"/&gt;{{qn|date=January 2017}} Austrian anthropologist [[Wilhelm Schmidt (linguist)|Wilhelm Schmidt]] had postulated an ''[[Urmonotheismus]]'', "original" or "primitive monotheism" in the 1910s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Armstrong|first1=Karen|title=A History of God: The 4,000-Year Quest of Judaism, Christianity and Islam|date=1994|publisher=Ballantine Books|location=New York City, New York|isbn=978-0345384560|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was objected{{by whom|date=January 2017}} that [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]] had grown up in opposition to polytheism as had Greek philosophical monotheism.&lt;ref name="odccmono"/&gt; More recently, [[Karen Armstrong]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Armstrong|first1=Karen|title=A History of God: The 4,000-Year Quest of Judaism, Christianity and Islam|date=1994|publisher=Ballantine Books|location=New York City, New York|isbn=978-0345384560}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other authors have returned to the idea of an evolutionary progression beginning with [[animism]], which developed into [[polytheism]], which developed into [[henotheism]], which developed into [[monolatry]], which developed into true monotheism.&lt;ref&gt;

| quote                 = Evolutionary interpretations of the history of religion are usually understood to be an explanation of the phenomenon of religion as a result of a continuous development. The model for such development is the growth of living beings which leads to increasingly subtle differentiation and integration. Within such a framework of thought, monotheism would be interpreted as the result of a continuous development from animism, polytheism, henotheism and monolatry to belief in the one and only God. Such a development cannot be proved. Monotheism appeared suddenly, though not without being prepared for.

==Abrahamic religions==
{{Further|Abrahamic religions}}
While all adherents of the Abrahamic religions consider themselves to be monotheists, some in Judaism do not consider Christianity to be a pure form of monotheism (due to The Christian doctrine of the Trinity), classifying it as [[Shituf]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mohammedamin.com/Community_issues/Triangulating-the-Abrahamic-faiths.html |title=Triangulating the Abrahamic faiths – measuring the closeness of Judaism, Christianity and Islam |author=Mohammed Amin |quote=Christians were seen as polytheists, due to the doctrine of the Trinity. In the last few hundred years, rabbis have moderated this view slightly, but they still do not regard Christians as being fully monotheistic in the same manner as Jews or Muslims. Muslims were acknowledged as monotheists.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Jacobs|editor1-first=Louis|title=The Jewish Religion: A Companion 1st Edition|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0198264637|pages=79-80|url=https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/jewish-views-on-christianity/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Islam likewise does not recognize modern-day Christianity as monotheistic, primarily due to the Christian doctrine of Trinity, which Islam argues was not a part of the original monotheistic Christianity as preached by Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ulc.org/training-education/guide-to-divinity/22-religions-of-the-world/134-practicing-islam/ |title=Islamic Practices |publisher=Universal Life Church Ministries |quote=It is the Islamic belief that Christianity is not monotheistic, as it claims, but rather polytheistic with the trinity-the father, son and the Holy Ghost.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Christians, on the other hand, argue that the doctrine of the Trinity is a valid expression of monotheism, citing that the Trinity does not consist of three separate [[deities]], but rather the three [[Hypostasis (philosophy and religion)|persons]], who exist [[consubstantiality|consubstantially]] (as one [[Ousia|substance]]) within a single [[Godhead in Christianity|Godhead]].&lt;ref&gt;https://icucourses.com/pages/025-10-three-persons-are-subsistent-relations ; International Catholic University, The One True God: "The fatherhood constitutes the Person of the Father, the sonship constitutes the Person of the Son, and the passive spiration constitutes the Person of the Holy Spirit. But in God "everything is one where there is no distinction by relative opposition." Consequently, even though in God there are three Persons, there is only one consciousness, one thinking and one loving. The three Persons share equally in the internal divine activity because they are all identified with the divine essence. For, if each divine Person possessed his own distinct and different consciousness, there would be three gods, not the one God of Christian revelation. So you will see that in this regard there is an immense difference between a divine Person and a human person."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://orthodoxwiki.org/Holy_Trinity ; Holy Trinity, Orthodox Wiki: "Orthodox Christians worship the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—the Holy Trinity, the one God. Following the Holy Scriptures and the Church Fathers, the Church believes that the Trinity is three divine persons (hypostases) who share one essence (ousia). It is paradoxical to believe thus, but that is how God has revealed himself. All three persons are consubstantial with each other, that is, they are of one essence (homoousios) and coeternal. There never was a time when any of the persons of the Trinity did not exist. God is beyond and before time and yet acts within time, moving and speaking within history."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.britannica.com/topic/Trinity-Christianity ; Britannica, Trinity: "The Council of Nicaea in 325 stated the crucial formula for that doctrine in its confession that the Son is “of the same substance [homoousios] as the Father,” even though it said very little about the Holy Spirit. Over the next half century, Athanasius defended and refined the Nicene formula, and, by the end of the 4th century, under the leadership of Basil of Caesarea, Gregory of Nyssa, and Gregory of Nazianzus (the Cappadocian Fathers), the doctrine of the Trinity took substantially the form it has maintained ever since. It is accepted in all of the historic confessions of Christianity, even though the impact of the Enlightenment decreased its importance."&lt;/ref&gt;

====In Ancient Israel====
{{see also|Yahweh|Elohim|Baal}}
During the 8th century BCE, the worship of [[Yahweh|YHWH]] in Israel was in competition with many other cults, described by the [[Yahwist]] faction collectively as [[Baal]]s. The oldest books of the [[Hebrew Bible]] reflect this competition, as in the books of [[Book of Hosea|Hosea]] and [[Book of Nahum|Nahum]], whose authors lament the "[[apostasy]]" of the people of Israel, threatening them with the wrath of God if they do not give up their polytheistic cults.&lt;ref&gt;1 Kings 18, Jeremiah 2; Othmar Keel, Christoph Uehlinger, Gods, Goddesses, and Images of God in Ancient Israel, Fortress Press (1998); Mark S.

YHWH was originally the [[national god]] of the [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]] and the [[Kingdom of Judah]].&lt;ref name="Israel Drazin"/&gt; As time progressed, the [[henotheistic]] cult of Yahweh grew increasingly militant in its opposition to the worship of other gods.&lt;ref name=Albertz/&gt; Later, the reforms of [[King Josiah]] imposed a form of strict [[Monolatrism#In ancient Israel|monolatrism]]. After the fall of Judah to Babylon, a small circle of priests and scribes gathered around the exiled royal court, where they first developed the concept of YHWH as the sole God of the world.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

====The Shema====
{{Main article|Shema Yisrael}}
''Shema Yisrael'' ("Hear, [O] Israel") are the [[Incipit|first two words]] of a section of the [[Torah]], and is the title of a prayer that serves as a centerpiece of the morning and evening [[Jewish services|Jewish prayer services]]. The first verse encapsulates the monotheistic essence of Judaism: "Hear, O Israel: the [[YHVH|{{LORD}}]] our God, the {{LORD}} is one" ({{Lang-he-n|שְׁמַע יִשְׂרָאֵל ה' אֱלֹהֵינוּ ה' אֶחָד}}), found in {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|6:4|HE}}, sometimes alternatively translated as "The {{LORD}} is our God, the {{LORD}} alone". Observant Jews consider the Shema to be the most important part of the [[prayer]] service in Judaism, and its twice-daily recitation as a ''[[mitzvah]]'' (religious commandment). It is traditional for Jews to say the Shema as their [[last words]], and for parents to teach their children to say it before they go to sleep at night.

===Christianity===
{{Main article|God in Christianity|Trinity}}
[[File:Shield-Trinity-Scutum-Fidei-English.svg|thumb|right|The [[Trinity]] is the belief in Christianity that God is one God in essence but three persons: [[God the Father]], [[God the Son]] ([[Jesus]]), and [[God the Holy Spirit]].&lt;ref name="def-lateran"&gt;Definition of the [[Fourth Lateran Council]] quoted in ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'' [http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/_P17.HTM#1FT §253].&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Among [[early Christians]] there was considerable debate over the nature of the [[Godhead (Christianity)|Godhead]], with some denying the incarnation but not the deity of Jesus ([[Docetism]]) and others later calling for an [[Arianism|Arian]] conception of God. Despite at least one earlier local [[Council of Alexandria|synod]] rejecting the claim of Arius, this [[Christology|Christological]] issue was to be one of the items addressed at the [[First Council of Nicaea]].

The First Council of Nicaea, held in [[Nicaea]] (in present-day [[Turkey]]), convoked by the [[Roman Emperors|Roman Emperor]] [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine I]] in 325, was the first [[ecumenical council|ecumenical]]&lt;ref&gt;''Ecumenical'', from [[Koine Greek]] [[Oikoumene|oikoumenikos]], literally meaning worldwide the earliest extant uses of the term for a council are in Eusebius's ''Life of Constantine'' 3.6 [http://khazarzar.skeptik.net/books/eusebius/vc/gr/index.htm] around 338 "{{lang|grc|σύνοδον οἰκουμενικὴν συνεκρότει}}" (he convoked an Ecumenical council), Athanasius's Ad Afros Epistola Synodica in 369 [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/2819.htm], and the Letter in 382 to [[Pope Damasus I]] and the Latin bishops from the [[First Council of Constantinople]][http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/NPNF2-14/Npnf2-14-63.htm#TopOfPage]&lt;/ref&gt; council of [[bishop]]s of the [[Roman Empire]], and most significantly resulted in the first uniform Christian [[doctrine]], called the [[Nicene Creed]]. With the creation of the creed, a precedent was established for subsequent general ecumenical councils of bishops ([[synod]]s) to create statements of belief and [[Canon law|canons]] of doctrinal [[orthodoxy]]— the intent being to define a common creed for the [[Christian Church|Church]] and address [[heresy|heretical]] ideas.

One purpose of the council was to resolve [[Arian controversy|disagreements]] in [[Early centers of Christianity#Alexandria|Alexandria]] over the nature of [[Jesus]] in relationship to the Father; in particular, whether Jesus was of the [[Homoousia|same substance]] as [[God the Father]] or merely of [[Homoiousia|similar substance]]. All but two bishops took the first position; while [[Arius]]' argument failed.

Christian orthodox traditions (Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Roman Catholic, and most Protestants) follow this decision, which was reaffirmed in 381 at the [[First Council of Constantinople]] and reached its full development through the work of the [[Cappadocian Fathers]]. They consider God to be a triune entity, called the Trinity, comprising three "[[person]]s", [[God the Father]], [[God the Son]], and [[God the Holy Spirit]]. These three are described as being "of the same substance" ({{lang|grc|[[ousia|ὁμοούσιος]]}}).

Christians overwhelmingly assert that monotheism is central to the Christian faith, as the Nicene Creed (and others), which gives the orthodox Christian definition of the Trinity, begins: "I believe in one God". From earlier than the times of the [[Nicene Creed]], 325&amp;nbsp;CE, various Christian figures advocated&lt;ref&gt;''Examples of ante-Nicene statements'':

&lt;/ref&gt; the triune [[Holy Mystery|mystery]]-nature of God as a normative profession of faith. According to [[Roger E. Olson]] and Christopher Hall, through prayer, meditation, study and practice, the Christian community concluded "that God must exist as both a unity and trinity", codifying this in ecumenical council at the end of the 4th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Olson|first1=Roger E.|title=The Trinity|date=2002|publisher=Wm.

Most modern Christians believe the [[Godhead in Christianity|Godhead]] is triune, meaning that the three persons of the Trinity are in one union in which each person is also wholly God. They also hold to the doctrine of a [[Hypostatic union|man-god]] [[Christ Jesus]] as [[God incarnate#Christianity|God incarnate]]. These Christians also do not believe that one of the three divine figures is God alone and the other two are not but that all three are mysteriously God and one. Other Christian religions, including [[Unitarian Universalism]], [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], [[Mormonism]] and others, do not share those views on the Trinity.

Some Christian faiths, such as [[God in Mormonism|Mormonism]], argue that the Godhead is in fact three separate individuals which include God the Father, His Son Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mormon.org/beliefs/articles-of-faith|title=Articles of Faith|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each individual having a distinct purpose in the grand existence of human kind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mormon.org/beliefs/jesus-christ|title=Jesus Christ|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Mormons believe that before the Council of Nicaea, the predominant belief among many early Christians was that the Godhead was three separate individuals. In support of this view, they cite early Christian examples of belief in [[subordinationism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publications.maxwellinstitute.byu.edu/fullscreen/?pub=1105&amp;index=3|title=Offenders for a Word|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Unitarianism]] is a theological movement, named for its understanding of God as one person, in direct contrast to Trinitarianism.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15154b.htm Unitarians]'' at 'Catholic Encyclopedia', ed. Kevin Knight at New Advent website&lt;/ref&gt;

The Qur'an asserts the existence of a single and absolute truth that transcends the world; a unique and indivisible being who is independent of the creation.&lt;ref name="EncRel"&gt;Vincent J. Cornell, Encyclopedia of Religion, Vol 5, pp.3561-3562&lt;/ref&gt; The Qur'an rejects binary modes of thinking such as the idea of a [[Dualistic cosmology|duality]] of God by arguing that both [[Goodness and evil|good and evil]] generate from God's creative act. God is a universal god rather than a local, tribal or parochial one; an absolute who integrates all affirmative values and brooks no evil.&lt;ref name="Barlas96"&gt;Asma Barlas, Believing Women in Islam, p.96&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ash'ari]] theology, which dominated Sunni Islam from the tenth to the nineteenth century, insists on ultimate divine transcendence and holds that divine unity is not accessible to human reason. Ash'arism teaches that human knowledge regarding it is limited to what was has been revealed through the prophets, and on such paradoxes as God's creation of evil, revelation has to accepted ''bila kayfa'' (without [asking] how).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|author=Tamara Sonn|title=Tawḥīd|encyclopedia=The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Islamic World|editor=John L.

As they traditionally profess a concept of monotheism with a singular [[God the father|person]] as God, Judaism&lt;ref name="RebShmuleyKosherJoshkel"/&gt; and Islam reject the Christian idea of monotheism. Judaism uses the term [[Shituf]] to refer to non-monotheistic ways of worshiping God. Though Muslims venerate Jesus ([[Jesus in Islam|Isa]] in Arabic) as a prophet, they do not accept the doctrine that he was a begotten son of God.

===Sabianism===
{{Main article|Sabians}}
According to the Quran, the Sabians were a monotheistic religious group.&lt;ref&gt;"the Jews, the Sabians, and the Christians." Bernard Lewis, The Jews of Islam, 1987, page 13&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Hadith]]s account them as converts to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Sahih Bukhari Book #7 Hadith #340, Book #59 Hadith #628, and Book #89 Hadith #299 etc.&lt;/ref&gt; However this interpretation may be related to the fact that [[Quraysh]] polytheists used to describe anyone who converted to Islam with the word "Saba"{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} ({{lang|ar|صبى/صبوت}}) which may either mean that this term was used for anyone who changed his religion or that they identified the message of Muhammed as a "Sabian belief". The former linguistic explanation (i.e. ''saba'' = ''changed his religion'') is the one adopted by most Muslim scholars.

Sabians are often identified with [[Mandaeism]], a small monotheistic community which lives today in [[Iraq]] and call themselves ''Yahyawiya'' ({{lang-ar|يحياوية}}). Muslim scholars traditionally viewed them as followers of the prophets [[Noah]] and ''Yahya'' (i.e. [[John the Baptist]]).&lt;ref name="Khalil ‘ibn Ahmad"&gt;Khalil ‘ibn Ahmad (d. 786–787), who was in Basra before his death, wrote: "The Sabians believe they belong to the prophet Noah, they read ''[[Zaboor]]'' (see also [[Book of Psalms]]), and their religion looks like Christianity." He also states that "they worship the angels."&lt;/ref&gt;

He raised [[Aten]], once a relatively obscure Egyptian [[Solar deity]] representing the disk of the sun, to the status of Supreme God in the Egyptian pantheon.&lt;ref&gt;Rosalie David, op. cit., p.125&lt;/ref&gt; To emphasise the change, Aten's name was written in the [[cartouche]] form normally reserved for Pharaohs, an innovation of Atenism. This religious reformation appears to coincide with the proclamation of a [[Sed festival]], a sort of royal jubilee intended to reinforce the Pharaoh's divine powers of kingship. Traditionally held in the thirtieth year of the Pharaoh's reign, this possibly was a festival in honour of [[Amenhotep III]], who some Egyptologists think had a [[coregency]] with his son Amenhotep IV of two to twelve years.

Year 5 is believed to mark the beginning of Amenhotep IV's construction of a new capital, [[Akhetaten]] (''Horizon of the Aten''), at the site known today as [[Amarna]]. Evidence of this appears on three of the boundary [[stele|stelae]] used to mark the boundaries of this new capital. At this time, Amenhotep IV officially changed his name to Akhenaten (''Agreeable to Aten'') as evidence of his new worship. The date given for the event has been estimated to fall around January 2 of that year. In Year 7 of his reign (1346/1344 BCE), the capital was moved from [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] to Akhetaten (near modern Amarna), though construction of the city seems to have continued for two more years. In shifting his court from the traditional ceremonial centres Akhenaten was signalling a dramatic transformation in the focus of religious and political power.

The move separated the Pharaoh and his court from the influence of the priesthood and from the traditional centres of worship, but his decree had deeper religious significance too—taken in conjunction with his name change, it is possible that the move to Amarna was also meant as a signal of Akhenaten's symbolic death and rebirth. It may also have coincided with the death of his father and the end of the coregency. In addition to constructing a new capital in honor of Aten, Akhenaten also oversaw the construction of some of the most massive [[Egyptian temple|temple]] complexes in ancient Egypt, including one at [[Karnak]] and one at Thebes, close to the old temple of [[Amun]].

In Year 9 (1344/1342 BCE), Akhenaten declared a more radical version of his new religion, declaring Aten not merely the supreme god of the Egyptian pantheon, but the only God of Egypt, with himself as the sole intermediary between the Aten and the Egyptian people. Key features of Atenism included a ban on idols and other images of the Aten, with the exception of a rayed solar disc, in which the rays (commonly depicted ending in hands) appear to represent the unseen spirit of Aten. Aten was addressed by Akhenaten in prayers, such as the ''[[Great Hymn to the Aten]]'': "O Sole God beside whom there is none".

The details of Atenist theology are still unclear. The exclusion of all but one god and the prohibition of idols was a radical departure from Egyptian tradition, but most scholars see Akhenaten as a practitioner of [[monolatrism|monolatry]] rather than monotheism, as he did not actively deny the existence of other gods; he simply refrained from worshiping any but Aten. It is known that Atenism did not solely attribute divinity to the Aten. Akhenaten continued the [[imperial cult#Ancient Egypt|cult]] of the Pharaoh, proclaiming himself the [[Son of God|son of Aten]] and encouraging the Egyptian people to worship him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ancientegyptonline.co.uk/amarnareligion.html|title=Ancient Egypt Gods: The Aten|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Egyptian people were to worship Akhenaten; only Akhenaten and Nefertiti could worship Aten directly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hart|first=George|title=The Routledge dictionary of Egyptian gods and goddesses|year=2005|edition=2nd|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-34495-1|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Akhenaten's successors, Egypt reverted to its traditional religion, and Akhenaten himself came to be reviled as a heretic.

==Chinese view==
{{Main article|Shangdi|Tian|Mohism}}
[[File:天-bronze-shang.svg|thumb|upright|[[Shang Dynasty]] [[bronze script]] character for ''tian'' (天), which translates to Heaven and sky.]]
The orthodox faith system held by most dynasties of [[China]] since at least the [[Shang Dynasty]] (1766&amp;nbsp;BCE) until the modern period centered on the worship of ''[[Shangdi]]'' (literally "Above Sovereign", generally translated as "God") or [[Tian|Heaven]] as an omnipotent force.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Homer H. Dubs, "Theism and Naturalism in Ancient Chinese Philosophy," ''Philosophy of East and West'', Vol. 9, No. 3/4, 1959&lt;/ref&gt; This faith system pre-dated the development of [[Confucianism]] and [[Taoism]] and the introduction of [[Buddhism]] and [[Christianity]]. It has features of monotheism in that Heaven is seen as an omnipotent entity, a [[Incorporeality|noncorporeal]] force with a [[personal god|personality]] [[transcendent reality|transcending]] the world. From the writings of [[Confucius]] in the ''[[Analects]]'', it is known Confucius believed that Heaven cannot be deceived, Heaven guides people's lives and maintains a personal relationship with them, and that Heaven gives tasks for people to fulfill in order to teach them of virtues and morality.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; However, this faith system was not truly monotheistic since other lesser gods and spirits, which varied with locality, were also worshiped along with ''Shangdi''. Still, later variants such as [[Mohism]] (470 BCE–c.391 BCE) approached true monotheism, teaching that the function of lesser gods and ancestral spirits is merely to carry out the will of ''Shangdi'', akin to the angels in Abrahamic religions which in turn counts as only one god. In [[Mozi]]'s ''Will of Heaven'' (天志), he writes:

{{quote box |width=60em |align=center
|quote="I know Heaven loves men dearly not without reason. Heaven ordered the sun, the moon, and the stars to enlighten and guide them. Heaven ordained the four seasons, Spring, Autumn, Winter, and Summer, to regulate them. Heaven sent down snow, frost, rain, and dew to grow the five grains and flax and silk that so the people could use and enjoy them. Heaven established the hills and rivers, ravines and valleys, and arranged many things to minister to man's good or bring him evil. He appointed the dukes and lords to reward the virtuous and punish the wicked, and to gather metal and wood, birds and beasts, and to engage in cultivating the five grains and flax and silk to provide for the people's food and clothing. This has been so from antiquity to the present."

且吾所以知天之愛民之厚者有矣，曰以磨為日月星辰，以昭道之；制為四時春秋冬夏，以紀綱之；雷降雪霜雨露，以長遂五穀麻絲，使民得而財利之；列為山川谿谷，播賦百事，以臨司民之善否；為王公侯伯，使之賞賢而罰暴；賊金木鳥獸，從事乎五穀麻絲，以為民衣食之財。自古及今，未嘗不有此也。
|source=''Will of Heaven'', Chapter 27, Paragraph 6, ca. 5th century BCE
}}

Worship of ''Shangdi'' and Heaven in ancient China includes the erection of shrines, the last and greatest being the [[Temple of Heaven]] in Beijing, and the offering of prayers. The ruler of China in every Chinese dynasty would perform annual sacrificial rituals to ''Shangdi'', usually by slaughtering a completely healthy bull as sacrifice. Although its popularity gradually diminished after the advent of Taoism and Buddhism, among other religions, its concepts remained in use throughout the pre-modern period and have been incorporated in later religions in China, including terminology used by early Christians in China. Despite the rising of non-theistic and pantheistic spirituality contributed by Taoism and Buddhism, Shangdi was still praised up until the end of the [[Qing Dynasty]] as the last ruler of the Qing declared himself [[son of heaven]].

The supreme god of the [[Proto-Indo-European religion]] was the god [[Dyeus|*''Dyḗus Pḥ&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;tḗr '']]. A number of words derived from the name of this supreme deity are used in various [[Indo-European languages]] to denote a monotheistic God.

In western Eurasia, the ancient traditions of the Slavic religion contained elements of monotheism.

Hindu views are broad and range from monism, through pantheism and panentheism (alternatively called monistic theism by some scholars) to monotheism and even atheism. Hinduism cannot be said to be purely polytheistic. Hindu religious leaders have repeatedly stressed that while God's forms are many and the ways to communicate with him are many, God is one. The ''[[Puja (Hinduism)|puja]]'' of the ''[[murti]]'' is a way to communicate with the abstract one god (''[[Brahman]]'') which creates, sustains and dissolves creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islam101.com/religions/hinduism/conceptOfGod.htm |title=Concept Of God In Hinduism By Dr Naik |publisher=Islam101.com |accessdate=2012-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Vīrya'' (vigor), which indicates the power to retain immateriality as the supreme being in spite of being the material cause of mutable creations

In the [[Shaivite]] tradition, the ''[[Shri Rudram]]'' ([[Sanskrit]] श्रि रुद्रम्), to which the Chamakam (चमकम्) is added by scriptural tradition, is a Hindu ''[[stotra]]'' dedicated to [[Rudra]] (an epithet of [[Shiva]]), taken from the [[Yajurveda]] (TS 4.5, 4.7).&lt;ref&gt;For an overview of the Śatarudriya see: Kramrisch, pp. 71-74.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For a full translation of the complete hymn see: Sivaramamurti (1976)&lt;/ref&gt; Shri Rudram is also known as ''Sri Rudraprasna'', ''{{IAST|Śatarudrīya}}'', and ''Rudradhyaya''. The text is important in [[Vedanta]] where [[Shiva]] is equated to the Universal supreme God. The hymn is an early example of enumerating the [[Names of God|names of a deity]],&lt;ref&gt;For the {{IAST|Śatarudrīya}} as an early example of enumeration of divine names, see: Flood (1996), p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; a tradition developed extensively in the [[sahasranama]] literature of [[Hinduism]].

The [[Nyaya]] school of Hinduism has made several arguments regarding a monotheistic view. The Naiyanikas have given an argument that such a god can only be one. In the ''Nyaya Kusumanjali'', this is discussed against the proposition of the ''[[Mimamsa]]'' school that let us assume there were many demigods (''[[Deva (Hinduism)|deva]]s'') and sages (''[[rishi]]s'') in the beginning, who wrote the Vedas and created the world. Nyaya says that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[If they assume such] omniscient beings, those endowed with the various superhuman faculties of assuming infinitesimal size, and so on, and capable of creating everything, then we reply that the ''law of parsimony'' bids us assume only one such, namely Him, the adorable Lord. There can be no confidence in a non-eternal and non-omniscient being, and hence it follows that according to the system which rejects God, the tradition of the Veda is simultaneously overthrown; there is no other way open.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In other words, Nyaya says that the polytheist would have to give elaborate proofs for the existence and origin of his several celestial spirits, none of which would be logical, and that it is more logical to assume one eternal, omniscient god.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yP-fIislexUC&amp;pg=PA161&amp;lpg=PA161&amp;dq=In+other+words,+Nyaya+says+that+the+polytheist+would+have+to+give+elaborate+proofs+for+the+existence+and+origin+of+his+several+celestial+spirits,+none+of+which+would+be+logical,+and+that+it+is+more+logical+to+assume+one+eternal,+omniscient+god.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XcvJAwws4J&amp;sig=mJlpVrEaVtXqdq6u0n6kt6vzuNQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiEsZ7mt_zSAhVP5mMKHc5PBc4Q6AEIJDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=In%20other%20words,%20Nyaya%20says%20that%20the%20polytheist%20would%20have%20to%20give%20elaborate%20proofs%20for%20the%20existence%20and%20origin%20of%20his%20several%20celestial%20spirits,%20none%20of%20which%20would%20be%20logical,%20and%20that%20it%20is%20more%20logical%20to%20assume%20one%20eternal,%20omniscient%20god.&amp;f=false|title=The Arian Christian Doctrines: The Origins of Christianity|last=Studies|first=Institute for Metaphysical|last2=Inc|first2=The Institute for Metaphysi Studies|last3=MM|first3=MR Charles D.

God in Sikhi is called ''[[Waheguru|Vāhigurū]]'', and is [[Nirankar|shapeless]], [[akaal|timeless]], and [[Alakh Niranjan|sightless]]: ''niraṅkār'', ''akaal'', and ''alakh''. God is present (''[[sarav viāpak]]'') in all of creation. God must be seen from "the inward eye", or the "heart". Sikhi devotees must [[meditate]] to progress towards enlightenment, as its rigorous application permits the existence of communication between God and human beings.&lt;ref name="p252"&gt;{{cite book

Sikhism is a monotheistic faith&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religionfacts.com/sikhism/beliefs.htm |title=Sikh Beliefs and Doctrine |publisher=ReligionFacts |accessdate=2012-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.multifaithcentre.org/sikhism/71-a-short-introduction-to-sikhism- |archive-url=https://www.webarchive.org.uk/wayback/archive/20091221113705/http://www.multifaithcentre.org/sikhism/71-a-short-introduction-to-sikhism- |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2009-12-21 |title=A Short Introduction to Sikhism |publisher=Multifaithcentre.org |accessdate=2012-06-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that arose in northern [[India]] during the 16th and 17th centuries. [[Sikh]]s believe in one, timeless, omnipresent, supreme creator. The opening verse of the [[Guru Granth Sahib]], known as the [[Mul Mantra]], signifies this:

:{{lang-pa|ੴ ਸਤਿ ਨਾਮੁ ਕਰਤਾ ਪੁਰਖੁ ਨਿਰਭਉ ਨਿਰਵੈਰੁ ਅਕਾਲ ਮੂਰਤਿ ਅਜੂਨੀ ਸੈਭੰ ਗੁਰ ਪ੍ਰਸਾਦਿ ॥}}
:[[Transliteration]]: ikk ōankār sat(i)-nām(u) karatā purakh(u) nirabha'u niravair(u) akāla mūrat(i) ajūnī saibhan&lt;small&gt;(g)&lt;/small&gt; gur(a) prasād(i).
:One Universal creator God, The supreme Unchangeable Truth, The Creator of the Universe, Beyond Fear, Beyond Hatred, Beyond Death, Beyond Birth, Self-Existent, by Guru's Grace.

The word "ੴ" ("Ik ōaṅkār") has two components. The first is ੧, the digit "1" in [[Gurmukhi]] signifying the singularity of the creator. Together the word means: "One Universal creator God".

It is often said that the 1430 pages of the [[Guru Granth Sahib]] are all expansions on the Mul Mantra. Although the Sikhs have many names for God, some derived from [[Islam]] and [[Hinduism]], they all refer to the same Supreme Being.

The Sikh holy scriptures refer to the One God who pervades the whole of space and is the creator of all beings in the [[universe]]. The following quotation from the Guru Granth Sahib highlights this point:
{{quote|
"Chant, and meditate on the One God, who permeates and pervades the many beings of the whole Universe. God created it, and God spreads through it everywhere. Everywhere I look, I see God. The Perfect Lord is perfectly pervading and permeating the water, the land and the sky; there is no place without Him."|Guru Granth Sahib, Page 782}}

However, there is a strong case for arguing that the Guru Granth Sahib teaches [[monism]] due to its non-dualistic tendencies:
{{quote|
{{lang-pa|ਸਹਸ ਪਦ ਬਿਮਲ ਨਨ ਏਕ ਪਦ ਗੰਧ ਬਿਨੁ ਸਹਸ ਤਵ ਗੰਧ ਇਵ ਚਲਤ ਮੋਹੀ ॥੨॥}}&lt;br&gt;
"You have thousands of Lotus Feet, and yet You do not have even one foot. You have no nose, but you have thousands of noses. This Play of Yours entrances me." |[[Guru Granth Sahib]], Page 13}}

Sikhs believe that God has been given many names, but they all refer to the One [[God]], [[VāhiGurū]]. Sikhs believe that members of other religions such as Islam, Hinduism and [[Christianity]] all worship the same God, and the names [[Allah]], [[Ar-Rahim|Rahim]], [[Al-Karim|Karim]], [[Hari]], [[Rama|Raam]] and [[Brahman|Paarbrahm]] are frequently mentioned in the Sikh holy scriptures. Although there is no set reference to God in Sikhism, the most commonly used Sikh reference to God is [[Akal Purakh]] (which means "the true immortal") or [[Waheguru]], the Primal Being.

====Zoroastrianism====
{{Main article|Zoroastrianism}}
[[File:Faravahar-Gold.svg|thumb|right|[[Faravahar]] (or Ferohar), one of the primary symbols of Zoroastrianism, believed to be the depiction of a Fravashi (guardian spirit)]]
Zoroastrianism combines [[Cosmology|cosmogonic]] dualism and [[Eschatology|eschatological]] monotheism which makes it unique among the religions of the world. Zoroastrianism proclaims an evolution through time from [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]] to monotheism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Buddhism in China: A Historical Sketch | journal = The Journal of Religion| id = | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zoroastrianism is a monotheistic religion,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Boyce|first=Mary|title=Zoroastrians: Their Religious Beliefs and Practices|publisher=Routledge|location=London|year=2007|pages=19–20|isbn=978-0-415-23903-5|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; although Zoroastrianism is often regarded&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05528b.htm Catholic Encyclopedia - Eschatology] "The radical defect of the Persian religion was its dualistic conception of deity."&lt;/ref&gt; as [[Dualistic cosmology|dualistic]], duotheistic or bitheistic, for its belief in the [[Hypostasis (philosophy and religion)|hypostatis]] of the ultimately good [[Ahura Mazda]] ''(creative spirit)'' and the ultimately evil [[Angra Mainyu]] ''(destructive spirit)''. Zorastrianism was once one of the largest religions on Earth, as the official religion of the [[Persian Empire]]. By some scholars,{{who|date=January 2012}} the Zoroastrians ("Parsis" or "Zartoshtis") are credited with being some of the first monotheists and having had influence on other world religions. Gathered statistics shows the number of adherents at as many as 3.5 million,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adherents.com/Religions_By_Adherents.html#Zoroastrianism |title=Major Religions Ranked by Size |publisher=Adherents.com |accessdate=2012-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; with adherents living in many regions, including South Asia.

===Ancient Greek religion===
{{main|Ancient Greek religion}}

====Classical Greece====
[[File:Xenophanes in Thomas Stanley History of Philosophy.jpg|thumb|right|Fictionalized portrait of [[Xenophanes]] from a 17th-century engraving]]

The surviving fragments of the poems of the classical Greek philosopher [[Xenophanes of Colophon]] suggest that he held views very similar to those of modern monotheists.&lt;ref&gt;McKirahan, Richard D. "Xenophanes of Colophon. ''Philosophy Before Socrates''. Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing Company, 1994. 61. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; His poems harshly criticize the traditional notion of anthropomorphic gods, commenting that "...if cattle and horses and lions had hands or could paint with their hands and create works such as men do,... [they] also would depict the gods' shapes and make their bodies of such a sort as the form they themselves have."&lt;ref&gt;Diels-Kranz, ''Die Fragmente der Vorsokratiker'', Xenophanes frr. 15-16.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Xenophanes declares that there is "...one god, greatest among gods and humans, like mortals neither in form nor in thought."&lt;ref name="osborne62"&gt;Osborne, Catherine. "Chapter 4." ''Presocratic Philosophy: A Very Short Introduction''. Oxford UP. 62. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Xenophanes's theology appears to have been monist, but not truly monotheistic in the strictest sense.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt; Although some later philosophers, such as [[Antisthenes]], believed in doctrines similar to those expounded by Xenophanes, his ideas do not appear to have become widely popular.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

In [[Plato]]'s writings, he often presents [[Socrates]] as speaking of "the God" in the singular form. He does, however, often speak of the gods in the plural form as well. The [[Euthyphro dilemma]], for example, is formulated as "Is that which is holy loved by the gods because it is holy, or is it holy because it is loved by the gods?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lamb|first1=W. R. M.|title=Euthyphro|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0170%3Atext%3DEuthyph.%3Asection%3D10a|website=Perseus|publisher=Tufts University|accessdate=25 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hellenistic Religion====
{{main|Hellenistic religion}}
The development of pure (philosophical) monotheism is a product of the [[Late Antiquity]]. During the 2nd to 3rd centuries, [[origins of Christianity|early Christianity]] was just one of several competing religious movements advocating monotheism.

"[[Henology|The One]]" (Τὸ Ἕν) is a concept that is prominent in the writings of the [[Neoplatonists]], especially those of the philosopher [[Plotinus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wyller|first1=Egil A.|title=Henologische Perspektiven II: zu Ehren Egil A. Wyller, Internales Henologie-Symposium|date=1997|publisher=Rodopi|location=Amsterdam, Netherlands|isbn=90-420-0357-X|pages=5–6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QbMAMtaJWIIC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;dq=Henology#v=onepage&amp;q=Henology&amp;f=false|accessdate=25 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the writings of Plotinus, "The One" is described as an inconceivable, transcendent, all-embodying, permanent, eternal, causative entity that permeates throughout all of existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schürmann|first1=Reiner|last2=Lily|first2=Reginald|title=Broken Hegemonies|date=2003|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington, Indiana|isbn=0-253-34144-2|pages=143–144|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4eRv1DTW_KoC&amp;pg=PA109&amp;dq=Henology#v=onepage&amp;q=Henology&amp;f=false|accessdate=25 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Columns of the Temple of Apollo at Delphi, Greece.jpeg|thumb|Remains of the [[Temple of Apollo (Delphi)|Temple of Apollo]] at Delphi, Greece.]]

A number of oracles of [[Apollo]] from [[Didyma]] and [[Clarus]], the so-called "theological oracles", dated to the 2nd and 3rd century CE, proclaim that there is only one highest god, of whom the gods of polytheistic religions are mere manifestations or servants.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dictionary of Deities and Demons in the Bible]], s.v. "Apollo".&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Aristotle|Aristotle's]] concept of the "Uncaused Cause"—never incorporated into the polytheistic ancient Greek religion—has been used by many exponents of Abrahamic religions to articulate their arguments for the existence of the Judeo-Christian-Islamic version of God.

The [[Hypsistarian]]s were a religious group who believed in a most high god, according to Greek documents. Later revisions of this Hellenic religion were adjusted towards Monotheism as it gained consideration among a wider populace. The worship of Zeus as the head-god signaled a trend in the direction of monotheism, with less honour paid to the fragmented powers of the lesser gods.

==New religious movements==
{{Expand section|date=July 2012}}
Various [[New religious movements]], such as [[Cao Dai|Cao Đài]], [[Tenrikyo]], [[Seicho no Ie]], and [[Cheondoism]], are monotheistic.

==Tengrism==
{{See also|Tengrism}}
Tengrism or Tangrism (sometimes stylized as Tengriism), occasionally referred to as Tengrianism &lt;!-- Do not put non-English translations on the English Wikipedia page --&gt;, is a modern term&lt;ref&gt;
The spelling ''Tengrism'' is found in the 1960s, e.g. Bergounioux (ed.), ''Primitive and prehistoric religions'', Volume 140, Hawthorn Books, 1966, p. 80.
''Tengrianism'' is a reflection of the Russian term, {{lang|ru|Тенгрианство}}. It is reported in 1996 ("so-called Tengrianism") in Shnirelʹman (ed.), ''Who gets the past?: competition for ancestors among non-Russian intellectuals in Russia'', Woodrow Wilson Center Press, 1996, {{ISBN|978-0-8018-5221-3}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4iwHp8asmsdEC&amp;pg=PA31 p. 31] in the context of the nationalist rivalry over [[Bulgars#Legacy|Bulgar legacy]]. The spellings ''Tengriism'' and ''Tengrianity'' are later, reported (deprecatingly, in scare quotes) in 2004 in ''Central Asiatic journal'', vol. 48-49 (2004), [https://books.google.com/books?id=GeRVAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=Tengriism&amp;dq=Tengriism p. 238].
The Turkish term {{lang|tr|Tengricilik}} is also found from the 1990s. Mongolian {{lang|mn|Тэнгэр шүтлэг}} is used in a 1999 biography of [[Genghis Khan]] (Boldbaatar et. al, {{lang|mn|Чингис хаан, 1162-1227}}, {{lang|mn| Хаадын сан}}, 1999, [https://books.google.com/books?id=OMIMAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22%D0%A2%D1%8D%D0%BD%D0%B3%D1%8D%D1%80+%D1%88%D2%AF%D1%82%D0%BB%D1%8D%D0%B3%22&amp;dq=%22%D0%A2%D1%8D%D0%BD%D0%B3%D1%8D%D1%80+%D1%88%D2%AF%D1%82%D0%BB%D1%8D%D0%B3%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=HVBLT4yGBImhOtPRtf8N&amp;redir_esc=y p. 18]).&lt;/ref&gt; for a [[Central Asia]]n [[Central Asia#Religions|religion]] characterized by features of [[shamanism]], [[animism]], [[totemism]], both [[polytheism]] and monotheism,&lt;ref&gt;R.

In ''[[Irk Bitig]]'', Tengri is mentioned as ''Türük Tängrisi'' (God of Turks).&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Paul Roux, Die alttürkische Mythologie, p. 255&lt;/ref&gt; The term is perceived among [[Turkic peoples]] as a ''national'' religion.

In [[Sino-Tibetan peoples|Sino-Tibetan]] and [[Altaic mythologies|Turco-Mongol]] traditions, the Supreme God is commonly referred to as the ruler of Heaven, or the Sky Lord granted with omnipotent powers, but it has largely diminished in those regions due to [[ancestor worship]], [[Taoism]]'s [[pantheistic]] views and Buddhism's rejection of a creator God, although Mahayana Buddhism does seem to keep a sense of divinity. On some occasions in the mythology, the Sky Lord as identified as a male has been associated to mate with an Earth Mother, while some traditions kept the omnipotence of the Sky Lord unshared.

==Native American religion==
Native American theology may be monotheistic, polytheistic, henotheistic, animistic, or some combination thereof.

Cherokee for example are monotheist as well as pantheist.

The [[Great Spirit]], called ''[[Wakan Tanka]]'' among the [[Sioux]],&lt;ref name=Ostler&gt;Ostler, Jeffry. The Plains Sioux and U.S. Colonialism from Lewis and Clark to Wounded Knee. Cambridge University Press, Jul 5, 2004. {{ISBN|0521605903}}, pg 26.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Gitche Manitou]]'' in [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]], is a conception of universal spiritual force, or [[God|supreme being]] prevalent among some [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] and [[First Nations|First Nation]] cultures.&lt;ref name=Thomas&gt;Thomas, Robert Murray. Manitou and God: North-American Indian Religions and Christian Culture. Greenwood Publishing Group, 2007. {{ISBN|0313347794}} pg 35.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Lakota people|Lakota]] activist [[Russell Means]] a better translation of ''Wakan Tanka'' is the Great Mystery.&lt;ref name=Means&gt;Means, Robert. Where White Men Fear to Tread: The Autobiography of Russell Means. Macmillan, 1995. {{ISBN|0312147619}} pg 241.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some researchers have interpreted [[Aztec philosophy]] as fundamentally monotheistic or panentheistic. While the populace at large believed in a polytheistic pantheon, Aztec priests and nobles might have come to an interpretation of [[Teotl]] as a single universal force with many facets.&lt;ref name="iepMaffie"&gt;{{cite web|author=James Maffie|title=Aztec Philosophy|work= [[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]|date= 2005|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/a/aztec.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been criticism to this idea, however, most notably that many assertions of this supposed monotheism might actually come from post-Conquistador bias, imposing an Antiquity pagan model unto the Aztec.&lt;ref&gt;James Maffie, Aztec Philosophy: Understanding a World in Motion, University Press of Colorado, 15/03/2014&lt;/ref&gt;

__NOTOC__
"'''One Little Ship'''" is the 138th episode of the television series ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]''. It is the 14th episode of the [[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (season 6)|sixth season]].

In order to investigate a rare subspace phenomenon, Dax, O'Brien, and Bashir board the [[Runabout (Star Trek)|Runabout]] USS ''Rubicon'', which as a side-effect of the anomaly is shrunk to four inches (10&amp;nbsp;cm) long. However, while investigating the phenomenon, the ''[[USS Defiant]]'' is boarded by Jem'Hadar (Dominion space forces).

The episode received a [[Primetime Emmy Award]] nomination for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Special Visual Effects|Outstanding Special Visual Effects for a Series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Primetime Emmys: Outstanding Special Visual Effects for a Series 1998|url=http://www.emmys.com/nominations/1998/Outstanding%20Special%20Visual%20Effects%20For%20A%20Series|publisher=[[Emmy]]s.com|accessdate=2012-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Emmy Awards 1998|url=https://www.imdb.com/event/ev0000223/1998|publisher=[[IMDB]].com|accessdate=2012-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The [[USS Defiant|USS ''Defiant'']] is sent on a mission to investigate a subspace anomaly, which could yield significant technological advances for the Federation. [[Jadzia Dax]] ([[Terry Farrell (actress)|Terry Farrell]]), [[Miles O'Brien (Star Trek)|Miles O'Brien]] ([[Colm Meaney]]) and [[Julian Bashir]] ([[Alexander Siddig]]) take the [[Runabout (Star Trek)|runabout]] USS ''Rubicon'' into the anomaly in order to take readings, tethered to the ''Defiant'' by a [[tractor beam]]. As a side-effect of entering the anomaly, the entire runabout is shrunk to only several centimeters high, but the crew expects to return to normal once they exit. However, during the procedure, the ''Defiant'' is attacked by a [[Jem'Hadar]] attack ship, disabled, and boarded by Jem'Hadar soldiers. The tractor beam is disconnected, leaving the runabout in the anomaly where the Jem'Hadar cannot detect it.

Aboard the ''Defiant'', the Jem'Hadar discover that the engines are damaged. The Jem'Hadar First Kudak'Etan ([[Scott Thompson Baker]]) celebrates victory, declaring that the new generation of Jem'Hadar born in the [[Alpha Quadrant]] are superior to those in the Gamma Quadrant. He overrules his Gamma-born Second Ixtana'Rax ([[Fritz Sperberg]]), despite his status as an "honored elder" and greater experience. Kudak'Etan reports in to his [[Vorta]] superior, Gelnon ([[Leland Crooke]]), who orders him to prioritize repairs to the ''Defiant''{{'s}} [[Warp drive (Star Trek)|warp drive]] and get underway to the nearest Dominion outpost, while the Jem'Hadar ship departs for another mission. Meanwhile, the ''Rubicon'' escapes the anomaly and sets course for the ''Defiant'', unaware that they have not returned to their previous size, as their sensors are offline.

Discovering their predicament and unable to communicate with the ''Defiant'', the runabout decides to enter the ship through a plasma vent. Meanwhile, Kudak'Etan has [[Benjamin Sisko]] ([[Avery Brooks]]) brought to the bridge and demands that he help the repair efforts on the warp drive. Sisko claims he needs his crew to do so, and Kudak'Etan grants his request over Ixtana'Rax's objections. On the way to the engine room, Ixtana'Rax threatens Sisko, and reveals the dissent between the Alpha and Gamma Jem'Hadar. Meanwhile, after narrowly avoiding being destroyed when the impulse engines are restarted, the ''Rubicon'' makes its way into the engine room and discovers the Jem'Hadar takeover.

The ''Rubicon'' crew observe the Starfleet crew members in engineering, and realize their plan - Sisko has [[Kira Nerys|Kira]] ([[Nana Visitor]]) conduct repairs, though slowly to stall for time, while Sisko, [[Worf]] ([[Michael Dorn]]) and [[Nog (Star Trek)|Nog]] ([[Aron Eisenberg]]) are attempting to regain control of the ship. O'Brien observes that Nog is attempting to override the ship's security codes, and suggests that they take the ''Rubicon'' to the bridge to assist them. When Kudak'Etan enters, Sisko complains about Ixtana'Rax's interference, driving an additional wedge between the two. As the Jem'Hadar departs, the ''Rubicon'' follows him through the door.

Sisko realizes they need an alternate plan if they are unable to regain control of the ship, and instructs Worf to plant a virus which will destroy the ship when it enters warp. Meanwhile, the ''Rubicon'' sneaks onto the bridge, where O'Brien and Bashir [[Transporter (Star Trek)|beam]] into a computer node to manually bypass the command codes. Despite O'Brien's initial disorientation, they manage to reroute the circuitry. At the same time in engineering, Nog believes he has cracked the codes but Ixtana'Rax orders the ''Defiant'' crew away from the computer consoles, revealing he is aware of the crew's delays, and the warp drive has actually been operational for an hour. Kudak'Etan orders the Starfleet crew locked up, and that the ship make way to the outpost, ignoring Ixtana'Rax's concerns about sabotage. The ''Rubicon'' then attacks the Jem'Hadar, and together with Sisko and the crew are able to overcome them. Sisko floods the ship with gas to knock out the remaining Jem'Hadar and orders Kira to disable the virus before the ship is destroyed.

After subduing the Jem'Hadar and taking back the ship, the ''Rubicon'' re-enters the anomaly and is returned to its normal size. Back at [[Deep Space Nine (space station)|Deep Space Nine]], however, [[Odo (Star Trek)|Odo]] ([[René Auberjonois]]) and [[Quark (Star Trek)|Quark]] ([[Armin Shimerman]]) tease O'Brien and Bashir, wondering if they have returned slightly shorter than when they left, and share a laugh as the two rush to sick bay in a panic.

'''Oswald Arnold Gottfried Spengler''' (29 May 1880 – 8 May 1936) was a German [[historian]] and [[Philosophy of history|philosopher of history]] whose interests included [[mathematics]], [[science]], and [[art]]. He is best known for his book ''[[The Decline of the West]]'' (''Der Untergang des Abendlandes''), published in 1918 and 1922, covering all of [[History of the world|world history]]. Spengler's model of [[history]] postulates that any [[culture]] is a [[superorganism]] with a limited and predictable lifespan.

Spengler predicted that about the year 2000, [[Western civilization]] would enter the period of pre‑death emergency whose countering would necessitate [[Caesarism]] ([[wiktionary:extraconstitutional|extraconstitutional]] omnipotence of the [[Executive (government)|executive]] branch of the central government).

Spengler is rendered as a nationalist, anti-democratic, and a prominent member of the [[Conservative Revolution]], but he rejected National Socialism due to its racialism. Instead, he saw his ideal realised in [[Benito Mussolini]], the dictator of [[Kingdom of Italy under Fascism (1922–1943)|Fascist Italy]].

He correctly predicted important developments of his time and strongly influenced other historians, including [[Franz Borkenau]] and especially [[Arnold J. Toynbee]].

==Biography==
Oswald Spengler was born in 1880 in [[Blankenburg (Harz)|Blankenburg]] (the [[Duchy of Brunswick]], the [[German Reich]]) as the second child of Bernhard (1844–1901) and Pauline (1840–1910) Spengler.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/search?newwindow=1&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=Oswald+Spengler+wurde+seinen+in+Vlankenburg+am+Harz+wohnenden+Eltern+am+28.+Mai+1880+als+zweites+Kind+geboren ''Preussische Jahrbücher'']. V. 192, issue 93, Georg Stilke, 1923, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; Oswald's elder brother was born prematurely (eight months) in 1879, when his mother tried to move a heavy laundry basket, and died at the age of three weeks. Oswald was born ten months after his brother's death.&lt;ref&gt;Koktanek, Anton Mirko, [https://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&amp;hl=en&amp;q=%22kam+1879+als+Achtmonatskind%22 Oswald Spengler in seiner Zeit], Beck, 1968, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; His younger sisters were Adele (1881–1917), Gertrud (1882–1957), and Hildegard (1885–1942).

Oswald's paternal grandfather, Theodor Spengler (1806–76), was a metallurgical inspector (''Hütteninspektor'') in [[Altenbrak]].&lt;ref&gt;Koktanek, Anton Mirko, [https://books.google.com/books?id=KDxIAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22H%C3%BCtteninspektor%22+%22Oswald+Spengler%22 Oswald Spengler in seiner Zeit]. Beck, 1968, pp. 3, 517&lt;/ref&gt; Oswald's father, Bernhard Spengler, held the position of a postal secretary (''Postsekretär'') and was a hard-working man with a marked dislike of intellectualism, who tried to instil the same values and attitudes in his son.

On 26 May 1799, Friedrich Wilhelm Grantzow, a tailor's apprentice in Berlin, married a Jewish woman named Bräunchen Moses (whose parents, Abraham and Reile Moses, were both deceased by that time). Shortly before the wedding, Bräunchen Moses (''ca.'' 1769–1849) was baptized as Johanna Elisabeth Anspachin (the surname was chosen after her birthplace—[[Ansbach|Anspach]]).&lt;ref&gt;Koktanek, Anton Mirko, [https://www.google.com/search?newwindow=1&amp;safe=off&amp;hl=en&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=Friedrich+Wilhelm+Grantzow+Schneidergcsell+Johanna+Elisabeth+Anspachin Oswald Spengler in seiner Zeit]. Beck, 1968, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had eight children (three before and five after the wedding),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Awerbuch|first1=Marianne|last2=Jersch-Wenzel|first2=Stefi|language=de|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=IefFUfHWJKHo4QSXooC4AQ&amp;id=ALhtAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22Br%C3%A4unchen+Moses%22|title=Bild und Selbstbild der Juden Berlins zwischen Aufklärung und Romantik|trans-title=Image and self-image of the Jews of Berlin between the Enlightenment and Romanticism|place= Berlin|publisher=Colloquium|year=1992|page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of whom was Gustav Adolf Grantzow (1811–83)—a solo dancer and ballet master in Berlin, who in 1837 married Katharina Kirchner (1813–73), a nervously beautiful solo dancer from a Munich Catholic family;&lt;ref&gt;Koktanek, Anton Mirko, [https://books.google.com/books?id=KDxIAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Katharina+Kirchner%22+%22Solot%C3%A4nzerin%22&amp;dq=%22Katharina+Kirchner%22+%22Solot%C3%A4nzerin%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bi2AVMOMBqaiyAPDmoDQBA&amp;ved=0CBgQ6AEwAQ Oswald Spengler in seiner Zeit]. Beck, 1968, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; the second of their four daughters was Oswald Spengler's mother Pauline Grantzow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Spengler| first=Oswald|language=de|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4DMQAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Spenglers+Mutter+Pauline+wurde+1840+als+Tochter+des+Solot%C3%A4nzers+und+Ballettmeisters%22&amp;dq=%22Spenglers+Mutter+Pauline+wurde+1840+als+Tochter+des+Solot%C3%A4nzers+und+Ballettmeisters%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ir_tUoraH4jBqwG8sIGoDw&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA|title=Ich beneide jeden, der lebt|trans-title=I envy anyone who lives|place=Lilienfeld|year=2007|page=126}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the Grantzows in general, Pauline was of a [[Bohemianism|Bohemian]] disposition, and, before marrying Bernhard Spengler, accompanied her dancer sister on tours. She was the  least talented member of the Grantzow family. In appearance, she was plump  and a bit unseemly. Her temperament, which Oswald inherited, complemented her appearance and frail physique: she was moody, irritable, and morose.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, Klaus P., [https://books.google.com/books?id=Lp4YAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=%22Oswald+Spengler%22+%22frail+physique%22&amp;dq=%22Oswald+Spengler%22+%22frail+physique%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=M3KcVOn9IMPdywPK1IGYCw&amp;redir_esc=y History and Prophecy: Oswald Spengler and The Decline of the West]. P. Lang, 1989, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

When Oswald was ten years of age, his family moved to the university city of [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]]. Here he received a classical education at the local [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] (academically oriented secondary school), studying Greek, Latin, mathematics and sciences.  Here, too, he developed his propensity for the arts&amp;mdash;especially poetry, drama, and music&amp;mdash;and came under the influence of the ideas of [[Goethe]] and [[Nietzsche]]:

{{pull quote|I feel urged to name once more those to whom I owe practically everything: Goethe and Nietzsche. Goethe gave me method, Nietzsche the questioning faculty ...&lt;ref&gt;Spengler, Oswald. [https://archive.org/stream/Decline-Of-The-West-Oswald-Spengler/Decline_Of_The_West#page/n12/mode/1up The Decline of the West]. V. 1, Alfred A. Knopf, 1926, p. xiv&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After his father's death in 1901 Spengler attended several universities ([[University of Munich|Munich]], [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin]], and [[University of Halle|Halle]]) as a private scholar, taking courses in a wide range of subjects. His private studies were undirected. In 1903, he failed his [[doctoral thesis]] on [[Heraclitus]] (titled ''Der metaphysische Grundgedanke der Heraklitischen Philosophie'', ''The Metaphysical Fundamental Thought in Heraclitean Philosophy'', and conducted under the direction of [[Alois Riehl]]) because of insufficient references, which effectively ended his chances of an [[academia|academic]] career. He eventually received his [[Ph.D.]] from Halle on 6 April 1904. In December 1904, he set to write the secondary dissertation (''Staatsexamensarbeit'') necessary to qualify as a high school teacher. This became ''The Development of the Organ of Sight in the Higher Realms of the Animal Kingdom''&lt;ref&gt;K. Stimely, [http://www.ihr.org/jhr/v17/v17n2p-2_Stimely.html "Oswald Spengler: An Introduction to his Life and Ideas"], ''The Journal of Historical Review'', Vol. 17, Institute for Historical Review, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; (''Die Entwicklung des Sehorgans bei den Hauptstufen des Tierreiches''). It was approved and he received his teaching certificate. In 1905 Spengler suffered a [[nervous breakdown]].

Biographers report his life as a teacher was uneventful. He briefly served as a teacher in [[Saarbrücken]] and then in [[Düsseldorf]]. From 1908 to 1911 he worked at a grammar school (''Realgymnasium'') in [[Hamburg]], where he taught science, German history, and mathematics.

In 1911, following his mother's death, he moved to [[Munich]], where he would live until his death in 1936. He lived as a cloistered scholar, supported by his modest inheritance. Spengler survived on very limited means and was marked by loneliness. He owned no books, and took jobs as a tutor or wrote for magazines to earn additional income.

He began work on the first volume of ''Decline of the West'' intending at first to focus on Germany within Europe, but the [[Agadir Crisis]] of 1911 affected him deeply, and he widened the scope of his study:

{{pull quote|At that time the World-War appeared to me both as imminent and also as the inevitable outward manifestation of the historical crisis, and my endeavor was to comprehend it from an examination of the spirit of the preceding centuries—not years. ... Thereafter I saw the present—the approaching World-War—in a quite other light. It was no longer a momentary constellation of casual facts due to national sentiments, personal influences, or economic tendencies endowed with an appearance of unity and necessity by some historian's scheme of political or social cause-and-effect, but the type of ''a historical [[Phase transition|change of phase]]'' occurring within a great historical organism of definable compass at the point preordained for it hundreds of years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Spengler, Oswald. [https://archive.org/stream/Decline-Of-The-West-Oswald-Spengler/Decline_Of_The_West#page/n62/mode/1up The Decline of the West]. V. 1, Alfred A. Knopf, 1926, pp. 46–47&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The book was completed in 1914, but publishing was delayed by [[World War I]]. Due to a congenital heart problem, Spengler was not called up for military service. During the war, however, his inheritance was largely useless because it was invested overseas; thus he lived in genuine poverty for this period.

==''The Decline of the West'' (1918)==
{{main|The Decline of the West}}
When ''The Decline of the West'' was published in the summer of 1918, it was a wild success.{{Efn|The original Preface is dated December 1917 and ends with Spengler expressing hope that "his book would not be unworthy of the German military achievements".}} The perceived national humiliation of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] (1919) and later the [[economic depression]] around 1923 fueled by [[hyperinflation]] seemed to prove Spengler right. It comforted Germans because it seemingly rationalized their downfall as part of larger world-historical processes. The book met with wide success outside of Germany as well, and by 1919 had been translated into several other languages. Spengler rejected a subsequent offer to become Professor of Philosophy at the [[University of Göttingen]], saying he needed time to focus on writing.

The book was widely discussed, even by those who had not read it. Historians took umbrage at his unapologetically non-scientific approach. [[Thomas Mann]] compared reading Spengler's book to reading [[Schopenhauer]] for the first time.  Academics gave it a mixed reception. [[Max Weber]] described Spengler as a "very ingenious and learned dilettante", while [[Karl Popper]] called the thesis "pointless".

The great historian of antiquity [[Eduard Meyer]] thought highly of Spengler, although he also had some criticisms of him. Spengler's obscurity, intuitionalism, and mysticism were easy targets, especially for the [[Positivism|Positivists]] and [[Neo-Kantianism|neo-Kantians]] who rejected the possibility that there was meaning in world history. The critic and aesthete Count [[Harry Graf Kessler|Harry Kessler]] thought him unoriginal and rather inane, especially in regard to his opinion on [[Nietzsche]]. [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], however, shared Spengler's cultural pessimism. Spengler's work became an important foundation for the [[social cycle theory]].

==''Prussianism and Socialism'' (1919)==
{{main|Prussianism and Socialism}}
In late 1919, Spengler published ''[[Preussentum und Sozialismus|Prussianism and Socialism]]'' (''Preußentum und Sozialismus''), an essay based on notes intended for the second volume of ''The Decline of the West'' in which he argues that Germanic socialism is the correct socialism in contrast to English socialism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/99223/1/BJLewis1%20Spengler%20Prussian%20Socialism.pdf Spengler's Prussian Socialism], Article: Lewis, B.J. (2017) Spengler's Prussian Socialism. European Review, Academia Europaea,25 (3). pp. 479-493. ISSN 1062-7987, [[University of Sheffield]]&lt;/ref&gt;  In his view, correct socialism has a much more "national" spirit.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=eBAABAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA244 Joy in Work, German Work: The National Debate, 1800-1945]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Spengler, mankind will spend the next and last several hundred years of its existence in a state of [[Caesarism|Caesarian]] socialism, when all humans will be [[wikiquote:Synergy|synergized]] into a harmonious and happy totality by a dictator, like an orchestra is synergized into a harmonious totality by its [[Conductor (music)|conductor]]&lt;ref name="PaS"&gt;Spengler, Oswald. [http://home.alphalink.com.au/~radnat/spengler/prussianism.html Prussianism and Socialism]. 1919. Translated by Donald O. White&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
A 1928 ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' review of the second volume of ''Decline'' described the immense influence and controversy Spengler's ideas enjoyed during the 1920s: "When the first volume of ''The Decline of the West'' appeared in Germany a few years ago, thousands of copies were sold. Cultivated European discourse quickly became Spengler-saturated. Spenglerism spurted from the pens of countless disciples. It was imperative to read Spengler, to sympathize or revolt. It still remains so".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Patterns in Chaos|date=10 December 1928|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]] |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,928375,00.html?promoid=googlep |accessdate=9 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second volume, published in 1922, Spengler argued that German [[socialism]] differed from [[Marxism]], and was in fact compatible with traditional German conservatism. In 1924, following the social-economic upheaval and [[inflation]], Spengler entered politics in an effort to bring [[Reichswehr]] general [[Hans von Seeckt]] to power as the country's [[leadership|leader]]. The attempt failed and Spengler proved ineffective in practical politics.

In 1931, he published ''[[Man and Technics]]'', which warned against the dangers of [[technology]] and [[industrialism]] to culture. He especially pointed to the tendency of Western technology to spread to hostile "Colored races" which would then use the weapons against the West.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Oswald Spengler|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=l__lhQxYWdYC|publisher = Transaction Publishers|date = 1 January 1991|isbn = 9781412830348|first = H. Stuart|last = Hughes}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was poorly received because of its anti-industrialism.{{citation needed|date=July 2010}} This book contains the well-known Spengler quote "Optimism is cowardice".

Despite voting for [[Hitler]] over [[Paul von Hindenburg|Hindenburg]] in 1932, Spengler found the Führer vulgar. He met Hitler in 1933 and after a lengthy discussion remained unimpressed, saying that Germany did not need a "heroic tenor &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;''[[Heldentenor]]'': one of several conventional tenor classifications] but a real [[hero]] [''Held'']". He quarreled publicly with [[Alfred Rosenberg]], and his pessimism and remarks about the Führer resulted in isolation and public silence. He further rejected offers from [[Joseph Goebbels]] to give public speeches. However, Spengler did become a member of the German Academy in the course of the year.

''The Hour of Decision'', published in 1934, was a bestseller, but the [[National Socialist German Workers Party|Nazis]] later banned it for its critiques of [[Nazism|National Socialism]].

[http://www.unz.org/Pub/AmericanRev-1934apr-00041 "Spengler's Tract Against Liberalism,"] ''[[The American Review (literary journal)|The American Review]]'' April 1934.&lt;/ref&gt; were welcomed by the Nazis, but Spengler disagreed with their biological ideology and [[anti-Semitism]]. While racial mysticism played a key role in his own worldview, Spengler had always been an outspoken critic of the pseudo-scientific racial theories professed by the Nazis and many others in his time, and was not inclined to change his views upon Hitler's rise to power. Although himself a German nationalist, Spengler viewed the Nazis as too narrowly German, and not occidental enough to lead the fight against other peoples. The book also warned of a coming world war in which Western Civilization risked being destroyed, and was widely distributed abroad before eventually being banned in Germany. A ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' review of ''The Hour of Decision'' noted his international popularity as a polemicist, observing that "When Oswald Spengler speaks, many a Western Worldling stops to listen". The review recommended the book for "readers who enjoy vigorous writing", who "will be glad to be rubbed the wrong way by Spengler's harsh aphorisms" and his pessimistic predictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Spengler Speaks|date=12 February 1934|work=Time Magazine|url=
http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,746957,00.html|accessdate=9 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his private papers, Spengler denounced Nazi anti-Semitism in even stronger terms, writing "and how much envy of the capability of other people in view of one's lack of it lies hidden in anti-Semitism!" and that "when one would rather destroy business and scholarship than see Jews in them, one is an ideologue, i.e., a danger for the nation. Idiotic."{{Sfn|Farrenkopf|2001|pp=237–38}}

==Final years==
On 13 October 1933 Spengler became one of the 100 senators of the [[Deutsche Akademie|German Academy]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.co.uk/search?tbm=bks&amp;hl=en&amp;q=%22Oswald+Spengler+in+den+Senat+aufgenommen%22 ''Wissenschaftliche Zeitschrift der Karl-Marx-Universität Leipzig'']. V. 17, 1968, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.co.uk/search?newwindow=1&amp;hl=en&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=%22Dr.+Oswald+Spengler%2C+München%2C+Senator+der+Deutschen+Akademie%22 ''Mitteilungen'']. Deutsche Akademie, 1936, p. 571. "Dr. Oswald Spengler, München, Senator der Deutschen Akademie"&lt;/ref&gt;

Spengler spent his final years in Munich, listening to [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], reading [[Molière]] and [[Shakespeare]], buying several thousand books, and collecting ancient [[Turkey|Turkish]], [[Iran|Persia]]n and [[India]]n weapons. He made occasional trips to the [[Harz mountains]], and to Italy. In the spring of 1936 (shortly before his death), he prophetically remarked in a letter to [[Reichsleiter]] [[Hans Frank]] that "in ten years, the German Reich will probably no longer exist" ("''da ja wohl in zehn Jahren ein Deutsches Reich nicht mehr existieren wird!''").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bronder|first=Dietrich|language=de|url= https://www.google.com/search?tbo=p&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=%22An+den+NS-Reichsleiter+Hans+Frank+schreibt+er+in+einem+seiner+letzten+Briefe+im+Fr%C3%BChjahr+1936+den+prophetischen+Satz%22&amp;num=10|title=Bevor Hitler kam: eine historische Studie|trans-title=Before Hitler came: a historical study|publisher= Pfeiffer|year=1964

'''Pala d’Oro''' ([[Italian Language|Italian]], "Golden [[Pall (liturgy)|Pall]]" or "Golden Cloth") is the high [[altar]] [[retable]] of the [[St Mark's Basilica|Basilica di San Marco]] in [[Venice]]. It is universally recognized as one of the most refined and accomplished works of [[Byzantine enamel]], with both front and rear sides decorated.

== History ==
[[File:Pala D'Oro Markusdom Venedig.jpg|thumb|300px|Pala d'Oro from a closer view]]
The Pala d’Oro was thought to be first commissioned in 976 by Doge [[Pietro I Orseolo|Pietro Orseolo]], where it was made up of precious stones and several enamels depicting various saints, and in 1105 it was expanded on by Doge Ordelaffo Falier.&lt;ref&gt;Paoletti and Radke 1997, p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1345, goldsmith Giovanni Paolo Bonesegna was commissioned to complete the altarpiece by [[Andrea Dandolo]], who was the procurator at the time, and later became doge. Bonesegna added a Gothic-style frame to the piece, along with more precious stones.&lt;ref name=vio2000&gt;Vio, 2000, p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt; Dandolo also included an inscription describing what his own additions were, along with those of his predecessors.&lt;ref name=vio2003&gt;Vio 2003, p. 300&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paolo Veneziano]] was commissioned to make wood panels to provide a cover for when the altarpiece was not on display.&lt;ref&gt;Paoletti and Radke 1997, p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; Veneziano was commissioned between 1342-4 to make this cover, where it was dated 1345 and signed by him along with his sons, Luca and Giovanni.&lt;ref name=gibbs2014&gt;Gibbs 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The cover is made from two pieces. The top plank features the [[Man of Sorrows]] in the center, who is surrounded by the Virgin and Sts. [[John the Baptist|John]], [[Saint George|George]], [[Mark the Evangelist|Mark]], [[Saint Peter|Peter]], and [[Saint Nicholas|Nicholas]].&lt;ref name=gibbs2014 /&gt; The bottom plank shows narratives of Life, Martyrdom, Burial, and Translation of St Mark.&lt;ref name=gibbs2014 /&gt; The wooden panels were opened to the public during liturgies only. In the 15th century, Veneziano's "exterior" altarpiece was replaced by a wooden panel which remains today, though the Pala is now always open.

==Description==
[[Image:SanMarcoPalaDOroDevelopmentEn.png|thumb|300px|Development and elements of the Pala d’Oro]]
The [[altarpiece]] is 3 meters (9.8 ft) wide by 2 meters (6.6 ft) tall.&lt;ref&gt;Vio, 2000, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; It is made of gold and silver,&lt;ref&gt;Nagel, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; 187 [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]] plaques,&lt;ref name=gibbs2014 /&gt; and 1,927 gems.&lt;ref name=vio2000 /&gt; These include 526 pearls, 330 garnets, 320 emeralds, 255 sapphires, 183 amethysts, 175 agates, 75 rubies, 34 topazes, 16 [[Carnelian|carnelians]], and 13 jaspers.&lt;ref name=vio2000 /&gt;

===Top Section===
The altarpiece consists of two parts. The enamels in the top section of the Pala d’Oro contain the [[Michael (archangel)|Archangel Michael]] at the center, with six images depicting the [[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]] on either side of him, which were added in 1209. They show the Entry of Christ into Jerusalem, Descent into Limbo, Crucifixion, Ascension, Pentecost, and Death of the Virgin.&lt;ref name=vio2000 /&gt; It’s generally thought that these weren’t originally part of the altarpiece, as their stylistic features place them into the 12th century, and they were probably looted during the [[Fourth Crusade]].&lt;ref&gt;Gonosová 1978, p. 332.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bottom Section===
The bottom section contains the enamels that told the Life of [[Mark the Evangelist|St. Mark]]. These were created in 1105 in [[Constantinople]], and were commissioned by [[Doge]] [[Ordelafo Faliero|Ordelaffo Falier]].&lt;ref name=vio166&gt;Vio, 2000, p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt; They used to be positioned along the base, but have since been moved to their current position along the sides and the top row of this section.&lt;ref name=vio166 /&gt;
[[File:Pala d'oro, cristo in smalto al centro.jpg|thumb|300px|The central panel of [[Christ in Majesty]]]]
Also in the bottom section is an enamel depicting Christ at the center of the altarpiece, and the four circular enamels around him are images of the [[Four Evangelists]].&lt;ref name=vio166 /&gt; To the right and left of Christ are the twelve apostles, six to each side. Above Christ is an empty throne, which represents the [[Last Judgment|Last Judgement]] and the [[Second Coming|Second Coming of Christ]], with angels and archangels on either side of it.&lt;ref name=vio2003 /&gt; Underneath Christ and the apostles are the twelve prophets, with the Virgin—flanked by Falier and Empress [[Irene of Athens|Irene]]—at the center.&lt;ref name=vio166 /&gt;

===Doge Falier and Empress Irene===
[[File:Venezia, pala d'oro, madonna tra i donatori irene e l'imperatore Giovanni II Comneno, trasformato nel doge Ordelaffo Falier.JPG|thumb|300px|Doge Ordelaffo Falier, the Virgin, and Empress Irene]]
The two figures surrounding the Virgin are images of Doge Ordelaffo Falier and Byzantine Empress Irene.&lt;ref name=buckton43&gt;Buckton and Osborne 2000, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; The depiction of Falier seems to be slightly off as his head is too small in proportion to his body. There is evidence that shows the original head was removed, and replaced with a new one.&lt;ref name=buckton43 /&gt; There are also scratches on the enamel from when the previous head was removed, and some type of wax or paste was used to fill in the gaps where the replacement piece didn’t exactly fit.&lt;ref name=buckton44&gt;Buckton and Osborne 2000, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

While there have been theories that the previous head depicted an emperor, that explanation doesn’t quite fit. Emperors are usually depicted with red footwear, and this figure is wearing black footwear, with no signs of being altered.&lt;ref name=buckton44 /&gt; Additionally, the enamel bears Falier’s name, which would have required a lot of effort to change, and would have left evidence behind.&lt;ref name=buckton44 /&gt; The most likely explanation is that the original head was in fact Falier’s head, but without a halo.&lt;ref name=buckton44 /&gt; Later, church officials—possibly even Falier himself—decided to replace it to include a halo. The scepter he’s holding restricted how much could be altered, which required the crafters to make the new image slightly smaller.&lt;ref name=buckton44 /&gt;

{{Spatial anomalies in fiction}}

In various works of fiction, a '''portable hole''' is a device that can be used to contravene the laws of physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortableHole|title=Portable Hole - TV Tropes|website=tvtropes.org|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=June 2018}} It generally resembles a circular cloth which is placed on a surface to create a hole. If placed on a wall, the user could crawl through the hole and come out on the other side of the surface. Placed on the ground, the user might be able to insert objects into it or allow others to fall in, as if he or she had dug a hole. The exact method in which the device works is dependent on the work of fiction.

== Cartoons ==
Portable holes are sometimes created and used in [[Looney Tunes]] cartoons, including such variations as foldable doorways{{Fact|date=June 2018|reason=Was this really more common in Looney Tunes, as opposed to cartoons from other producers?}}.

''[[The Hole Idea]]'' (1955, animated and directed by [[Robert McKimson]]) depicts the invention of the portable hole by Calvin Q. Calculus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cartoonresearch.com/index.php/robert-mckimsons-the-hole-idea-1955/|title=Robert McKimson’s “The Hole Idea” (1955) {{!}}|website=cartoonresearch.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is apparently the portable hole's first appearance on screen.{{Fact|date=June 2018}}

One [[Roadrunner (cartoon)|Roadrunner]] cartoon involved the use of ''liquid hole'', a black tar-like substance that came in a bottle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nola.com/outdoors/index.ssf/2014/05/mmmm_tasty_speckled_trout_redf.html|title=Mmmm, tasty!

Another episode (''The Black Hole'') has the coyote using a portable hole, which is picked up and reused by the roadrunner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Whattunesyouon|title=The Black Hole|date=2010-05-19|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFNx7YFwFfI|accessdate=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=Unsure if The Black Hole is actually the correct name for this episode.|date=June 2018}}

In the [[Morph (animation)|Morph]] episode, ''Portable Hole'', a portable hole is used to access cakes which are hidden in the hole.  A pair of holes are also used to construct a [[Portals in fiction|portal]], allowing a character's hand, and several inanimate objects, to pass from one to the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://amazingmorph.com/video/brand-new-episode-portable-hole/|title=Portable Hole|work=Morph|access-date=2018-06-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://amazingmorph.com/video/the-history-of-the-portable-hole/|title=The History of the Portable Hole|work=Morph|access-date=2018-06-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=These are both primary sources|date=June 2018}}

In ''[[Yellow Submarine (1968 film)|Yellow Submarine]]'', [[Ringo Starr|Ringo]] picks up a hole he finds in the ''Sea of Holes'', put it in his pocket, and uses it later to aid an escape, leading to his classic line of dialogue ''I've got a hole in me pocket''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T2opDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA249&amp;lpg=PA249&amp;dq=yellow+submarine+ive+got+a+whole+in+my+pocket&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=pO5dxOZnRZ&amp;sig=nNvM2srHTi-JjFC5SupVR2ZVil0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiMoYTbvtHbAhXMt1kKHQrUBswQ6AEIdjAN#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Great Movies IV|last=Ebert|first=Roger|date=2016-09-28|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226403984|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-yellow-submarine-1968|title=Yellow Submarine Movie Review (1968) {{!}} Roger Ebert|last=Ebert|first=Roger|website=www.rogerebert.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He uses the hole to save Sgt.

One of [[Terry Gilliam]]'s cartoons in ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'' has the police using a large portable hole in the road to catch criminals, they fall in, then the hole is taken to the lockup and thrown upon the ceiling causing the criminals to fall out. Another cartoon involves the [[List of recurring Monty Python's Flying Circus characters#The Pepperpots|pepperpot]] Mrs. Cutout being deposited in front of a [[laundromat]] by a large portable doorway.

In an episode of ''[[Ed, Edd n Eddy]]'' entitled ''One + One = Ed'', Eddy falls through a hole in the ground which causes him to appear in the sky off-camera, where he then falls through the hole in a [[recursive loop]]. This continues until Ed picks up the hole, leaving Eddy to crash onto the now-solid ground. Ed uses the hole for a couple gags then eventually rolls it up and keeps it. Later in the cartoon, Edd and Eddy fall into a manhole, and Ed, believing it to be another portable hole, says, ''Don't worry guys! I'll just pick up the hole again!'', and proceeds to excavate the entire manhole entrance tube from the ground.

The cartoon series ''[[Channel Umptee-3]]'' features a character named Holey Moley, who carries several portable holes and uses at least one in every episode.

The video game ''[[Portal (video game)|Portal]]'' features a gun that shoots portals whose behavior are similar to holes. In this case, two holes are created, and if someone walks or falls through, they arrive at the other with the same speed but turned in the direction the portal is facing. One use of this is to ''fling'' oneself.

In many of ''[[The Sims]]'' games, if a person trying to leave your property is trapped in a room with no doors, one will take out a portable hole and use it to teleport out.

== History ==

PIRLS &lt;ref name="iea.nl"/&gt; provides internationally comparative data on how well children read by assessing students’ reading achievement. PIRLS collects considerable background information on how education systems provide educational opportunities to their students as well as the factors that influence how students use these opportunities. These background data include information about the following: national curriculum policies in reading; how the education system is organized to facilitate learning; students’ home environment for learning; school climate and resources; and how instruction actually occurs in classrooms. Studies of reading literacy had been conducted prior to the PIRLS study of 2001, and PIRLS is the successor to IEA studies, such as the Reading Literacy Study, that started in 1970 and continued until 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iea.nl/other-iea-studies|title=Other IEA studies - IEA|website=www.iea.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The PIRLS study of 2001 started the trend for cyclical testing; PIRLS has a frequency of five years.  By administering the test every five years, education systems are able to monitor their children's literacy achievement over time.  The current cycle, PIRLS 2016, is the fourth cycle of the IEA PIRLS. Like the previous PIRLS cycles (conducted in 2001, 2006, and 2011), the study will also collect extensive information about home supports for literacy, curriculum and curriculum implementation, instructional practices, and school resources in each participating country.&lt;ref name="iea.nl"/&gt;

== Cycles ==

===PIRLS 2001===

The IEA Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS) 2001 was the first cycle of assessments to measure trends in children's reading literacy achievement, and policy and practices related to literacy. The study examined three aspects of reading literacy: processes of comprehension, purposes for reading, and reading literacy behavior and attitudes. 35 countries took part in the first cycle where students enrolled in the fourth grade were assessed.&lt;ref name="iea.nl1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iea.nl/pirls-past-cycles|title=PIRLS - Past Cycles - IEA|website=www.iea.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===PIRLS 2006===

PIRLS 2006 assessed a range of reading comprehension strategies for two major reading purposes: literary and informational. The student test of reading comprehension addressed four processes:

* retrieval of explicitly stated information
* making straightforward inferences
* interpreting and integrating ideas and information
* examination and evaluation of content, language, and textual elements.
For the second cycle of the study 41 countries participated assessing students of grade four. PIRLS 2006 assessed students enrolled in the fourth grade.&lt;ref name="iea.nl1"/&gt;

===PIRLS 2011===

Combining newly developed reading assessment passages and questions for 2011 with a selection of secure assessment passages and questions from 2001 and 2006, the study offered a state-of-the-art assessment of reading comprehension that allowed for measurement of changes since 2001. The international population for PIRLS 2011 consisted of students in the grade that represents four years of schooling, provided that the mean age at the time of testing was at least 9.5 years. In the 2011 cycle, prePIRLS (now known as PIRLS Literacy) was offered to assess basic reading skills as a bridge to PIRLS, for countries where most children are still developing fundamental reading skills at the end of the primary school cycle.&lt;ref name="iea.nl1"/&gt;

===PIRLS 2016===

PIRLS 2016 was released on December 5, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://timssandpirls.bc.edu/pirls2016/ |title=PIRLS 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also collects extensive information about home supports for literacy, curriculum and curriculum implementation, instructional practices, and school resources in each participating country. In this cycle there were two additional initiatives: 
(1) the PIRLS Literacy assessment (earlier known as prePIRLS) is equivalent to PIRLS in scope and reflects the same conception of reading as PIRLS. Its purpose is to extend the effective measurement of reading literacy at the lower end of the achievement scale. Countries whose fourth-grade students are still developing fundamental reading skills can participate in the PIRLS Literacy assessment and still have their results reported on the PIRLS achievement scale. The reading passages and questions in common between the PIRLS Literacy and the PIRLS assessments will enable the two assessments to be linked, and their results to be compared.
(2) Initiated in 2016, ePIRLS is a computer-based reading assessment of students’ ability to acquire and use information when reading online. The assessment encompasses an engaging, simulated internet environment with authentic school-like assignments about science and social studies topics. The ePIRLS online reading achievement scale enables countries to examine their fourth-graders’ online reading performance relative to their performance on the PIRLS reading achievement scales.

In terms of trends, the PIRLS results for student achievement by country states that 18 countries had higher average achievement, 13 countries had the same average achievement, and 10 countries had lower average achievement; and girls had higher reading achievement than boys in 48 0f the 50 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://timssandpirls.bc.edu/pirls2016/international-results/pirls/student-achievement/ |title= PIRLS 2016 International results in reading}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://timssandpirls.bc.edu/pirls2016/international-results/pirls/student-achievement/trends-in-reading-achievement/ |title=Trends in reading results by country}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2016 PIRLS Encyclopedia has the Education Policy and Curriculum in Reading by country. It describes the structure of each education system, the reading curricula in the primary grades, and overall policies related to reading instruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://timssandpirls.bc.edu/pirls2016/encyclopedia/ |title=2016 PIRLS Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ten countries with the highest average reading achievement were: Russian Federation, Singapore, Hong Kong SAR, Ireland, Finland, Poland, Northern Ireland, Norway, Chinese Taipie, and England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://timssandpirls.bc.edu/pirls2016/international-results/pirls/student-achievement/ | title= PIRLS 2016 Student Achievement Overview}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===PIRLS 2021===

[http://www.iea.nl/pirls-next-cycle PIRLS 2021] will be the fifth cycle in the PIRLS framework. IEA's PIRLS will continue to collect considerable background information from the assessed students, their parents, teachers and school principals on how education systems provide educational opportunities to their students, as well as the factors that influence how students use these opportunities. Trend results across assessments permit countries to monitor the effectiveness of their educational systems in a global context, and PIRLS 2021 marks 20 years of trends.

PIRLS 2021 evolves further from PIRLS 2016 in allowing countries to administer the full PIRLS reading assessment, including both PIRLS Informational and Literary (the previous standard PIRLS assessment), and the ePIRLS Online Informational (the previous ePIRLS), as one seamless digitally based endeavour. Countries may also select from two levels of the PIRLS assessment; providing students with an assessment experience better suited to their reading abilities increases student motivation and provides more accurate assessment data. All results will be reported on the same PIRLS achievement scale.

PIRLS 2021 thus offers three flexible options, enabling participants to select the administration path best suited to assessing their education system:(1) A new fully digital ePIRLS assessment, which integrates all aspects of PIRLS Informational, PIRLS Literary, and the ePIRLS Online Informational assessments; 2) The paper-only version of the PIRLS assessment, which is equivalent to the original pen-and-paper PIRLS standard assessment; and (3) The paper-only version of the PIRLS assessment, taken together with the ePIRLS Online Informational assessment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iea.nl/sites/default/files/publications/Electronic_versions/PIRLS%202021%20Brochure.pdf |title=Info |website=www.iea.nl |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== PIRLS assessment ==

The PIRLS study consists of a main survey that consists of a written reading comprehension test and a background questionnaire.  The PIRLS Reading Development Group (RDG) and National Research Coordinators (NRCs) from the participating countries collaborate to develop the reading assessments.  The assessment focuses on three main areas of literacy: process of comprehension, purposes for reading, and reading behaviors and attitudes.  The background questionnaire is used to determine the reading behaviors and attitudes.  The written test is designed to address the process of comprehension and the purposes for reading.  There are two purposes for reading that are examined in this study: reading for literary experience and reading to acquire and use information. Each student receives 80 minutes to complete two passages and then time to complete the survey.  There are a total of 8 passage.  Four passages are for each purpose of reading.  "With eight reading passages in total, but just two to be given to any
one student, passages and their accompanying items were assigned to student test booklets according to a matrix sampling plan. The eight passages were distributed across 10 booklets, two per booklet, so that passages were paired together in a booklet in as many different ways as possible."&lt;ref name="bc.edu"/&gt; The PIRLS target population is the grade that represents four years of schooling, counting from the first year of ISCED Level 1, which corresponds to the fourth grade in most countries. To better match the assessment to the achievement level of students, countries have the option of administering PIRLS or PIRLS Literacy at the fifth or sixth grade.

== Background questionnaire ==
Given to:

*Home/Parents—This questionnaire includes questions about "students’ early reading experiences, child-parent literacy interactions, parents’ reading habits and attitudes, home-school connections, and demographic and socioeconomic indicators."
*Students—This questionnaire includes questions about "instructional experiences, self-perception and attitudes towards reading, out-of-school reading habits, computer use, home literacy resources, and basic demographic information."
*Teachers—This questionnaire includes questions about "characteristics of the class tested, instructional activities for teaching reading, classroom resources, assessment practices, and about their education, training, and opportunities for professional development."
*Schools—This questionnaire includes questions about "enrollment and school characteristics, school organization for reading instruction, school staffing and resources, home-school connections, and the school environment."&lt;ref name="bc.edu"/&gt;

==Background==
RFD-TV is the flagship network for Rural Media Group. Launched in December 2000, RFD-TV is the nation’s first 24-hour television network featuring programming focused on the agribusiness, equine and the rural lifestyle, along with traditional country music and entertainment. 

As of 2017, RFD-TV operates on a [[full service (radio format)|full-service format]]. Mornings and the early part of daytime feature syndicated newsmagazines and a five-hour block of news, weather (forecasting services on the network are outsourced to [[The Weather Channel]]) and agricultural commodity market prices, in the basic format of an [[United States cable news|American cable news outlet]]. An additional newscast airs during the evening hours. The remainder of the daytime and evening schedule consists of horse-related magazines, coverage of [[rodeo]] and other Western sports, rural lifestyle programs, [[rerun]]s of classic television programs with rural appeal, and music programs centered around [[country music]], [[polka]] and [[Southern gospel]].

[[Infomercial]]s, which were previously publicly banned from the network, appear during the overnight hours. The network also features [[brokered programming]] in the form of its call-in program ''Rural America Live''.

===RFD-HD===

RFD-HD is a [[High-definition television|high definition]] feed of RFD-TV that broadcasts in the [[1080i]] resolution format. Instead of simulcasting RFD-TV, the HD feed maintains its own independent programming schedule. The channel first began broadcasting in high definition in the fall of 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.multichannel.com/article/CA6463271.html Multichannel News 7/26/07 RFD-TV Goes HD] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071204124018/http://www.multichannel.com/article/CA6463271.html |date=December 4, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programming==

===''Imus in the Morning''===
When [[Don Imus]] returned to radio in late 2007, following his firing by [[WFAN]] radio in [[New York City]] after being accused of making misogynistic and racially insensitive comments about African American players on the [[Rutgers University]] college basketball team, Imus had also struck a deal to simulcast ''[[Imus in the Morning]]'' on RFD-TV. The program was broadcast on the channel from 6 to 9 a.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]] on weekdays, along with a primetime telecast of the program on its high definition simulcast channel RFD-HD. During much of the show's run, a news ticker was shown with the day's news, similar to that featuring when ''Imus in the Morning'' was simulcast on [[MSNBC]]. The video simulcast of the program ended its run on RFD-TV on August 28, 2009, and moved to [[Fox Business Network]] several weeks later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.multichannel.com/article/329082-Don_Imus_RFD_Part_Ways.php Don Imus, RFD Part Ways - Move Pays Could Pave Way For Disc Jockey To Join Fox Business Network]&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Big Joe Polka Show''===
One of the very first programs to be aired on RFD-TV was ''The Big Joe Polka Show'', a [[Polka music|polka]] and dance variety program hosted by Omaha resident Joseph "Big Joe" Siedlik, which continued to be popular among the network's estimated (approximately) 40 million+ available households until it ended its run on January 1, 2011. In 2010, litigation commenced between RFD-TV and ''The Big Joe Polka Show''{{'}}s creators/producers of Polka Cassettes of Nebraska, involving several lawsuits and countersuits (mostly over a contractual dispute). RFD-TV contends that it had an option to air the program until December 31, 2010, while Polka Cassettes of Nebraska contends that the show was being aired against their wishes, and after cessation of the effectiveness of the previous contract, which expired on December 31, 2009. In August 2010, a multimillion-dollar "slander and defamation" suit was brought against Polka Cassettes of Nebraska by RFD-TV.&lt;ref&gt;Source: Public Record: The Fourth Judicial District Court of Nebraska Clerk of Courts, date of inquiry Monday, August 30, 2010 Douglas County, Nebraska&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2011, the court granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment and dismissed RFD-TV's lawsuit as being without merit.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fraserstryker.com/Resources/PDF-Files/Rural-Media-Group-v-Siedlik.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  In January 2015, Joseph "Big Joe" Siedlik died.&lt;ref&gt;http://columbustelegram.com/news/local/polka-show-host-big-joe-dies-at/article_921733ba-69c3-58a2-9e87-94c4263c74ea.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.omaha.com/go/big-joe-polka-show-host-dies-of-cancer-at-age/article_08cd5c5a-d7ea-52a7-8e52-5811a5aa7d92.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rfdtv.com/story/27765895/polka-legend-big-joe-siedlik-passes#.VODqcvnF98E&lt;/ref&gt;

The show was replaced by ''The RFD-TV Polka Fest'' on January 5, 2011, and aired during the same timeslots. ''RFD-TV Polka Fest'' was later replaced by ''Mollie B Polka Party'', hosted by Mollie Busta in July 2011. Wednesday afternoons, starting in September 2015 featured selected reruns of the ''Big Joe Polka Show'' under the name ''Big Joe Polka Classics'

Other programs added in Winter 2007-2008 included a revival of ''[[Crook &amp; Chase]]'' (which returned to [[The Nashville Network#Revival|TNN]] (now [[Heartland (TV network)|Heartland]]) upon its relaunch in 2012) and ''[[Bluegrass &amp; Backroads]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tennessean.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071105/BUSINESS01/711050328 |title=Source: RFD-TV hopes Imus opens urban markets |author=Beverly Keel |publisher=''[[The Tennessean]]'' |date=2007-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Room 13 International''' is a network of [[The arts|arts]] [[studio]]s in [[primary school]]s worldwide. Each studio is run by the students as a [[Self-sufficiency|self-sufficient business]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1476-8070.2012.01762.x|author=Gibb, C.|year=2012|title= Room 13: The Movement and International Network|journal=International Journal of Art &amp; Design Education|volume= 31|pages= 237–244|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1476-8070.2012.01762.x/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt; The network is named after the first such studio, which operated in Room 13 in the [[Caol Primary School]] in [[Fort William, Scotland]].

As of 2012, the network consists of over 80 studios around the globe.

==History==
The first studio in Room 13 of the Caol Primary School in Fort William, [[Scotland]] was started by [[Rob Fairley]], an [[Artist-in-residence]], and his students, in 1994.

In 2003, Room 13 won a £200,000 award from [[NESTA]] to expand the project into other schools. By 2005, Room 13 Caol had become the global headquarters for a network of 10 Room 13 studios in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Nepal]], [[South Africa]] and [[Dunedin, New Zealand]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1285">The '''Royal Corps of Halberdiers''' is a fictional British regiment from [[Evelyn Waugh]]'s  ''[[Sword of Honour]]'' trilogy. In the novel, the regiment is described as being composed of four [[battalions]]: The 1st (Regular [[Infantry]]) 2nd ([[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]]), 3rd ([[Commando]]s), and 4th ([[Militia]]). The Corps is derived from Waugh's own experiences in the [[Royal Marines]] throughout [[World War II]]. 

The Halberdiers are commanded by an officer called a 'Captain-Commandant' &amp;mdash; a rank derived from the Corps's purported origins as the [[Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex|"Earl Of Essex's Honourable Company Of Free Halberdiers"]] during the reign of [[Elizabeth I]] (the [[halberd]] being a popular [[heavy infantry]] weapon of the time). The rank is analogous with [[Colonel]].&lt;ref name="P31"&gt;''Sword of Honour'', Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Colonel-in-Chief]] of the Regiment since 1902 was the Grand-Duchess Elena of Russia.  The nicknames of the Regiment were the "Applejacks", after an account of the Corps in an orchard during the Napoleonic Wars repelling a French attack by hurling apples at them, and the "Copper Heels".

A '''script doctor''' is a writer or playwright hired by a [[film]], [[television]] or theatre production to rewrite an existing script or polish specific aspects of it, including structure, characterization, dialogue, pacing, themes and other elements.&lt;ref name="Jones"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Sarah| title=Film|year=2004| publisher=Smart Apple Media|location=North Mankato|isbn=158340256X|pages=14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Script doctors generally do their work [[ghostwriter|uncredited]] for a variety of commercial and artistic reasons{{Example needed|s}}.&lt;ref name="Jones"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Jewish Women in America: An Historical Encyclopedia|year=1998|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=0415919363|editor=Hyman, Paula E. |editor2=Moore, Deborah Dash|page=444|quote=Currently [Fisher] works in that great uncredited Hollywood profession of script doctor—or, as Fisher calls it, script nurse.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hurd"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hurd|first=Mary G.|title=Women Directors and Their Films|year=2007|publisher=Praeger Publishers|location=Westport|isbn=0275985784|page=150|quote=She [Elaine May] then became a script doctor, one of a small group of writers who are paid handsome fees by studios to do uncredited work on a script.}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are usually brought in for scripts that have been almost "green-lit"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Appleton|first1=Dina|last2=Yankelevits|first2=Daniel|title=Hollywood Dealmaking: Negotiating Talent Agreements for Film, TV and New Media|year=2010|publisher=Allworth Press|location=New York|isbn=1581156715|edition=2|page=303|quote=A writer hired to 'spruce up' or 'fix' a script, usually by inserting jokes or otherwise adding some 'juice'.

To receive credit, the [[WGA screenwriting credit system|Writers Guild of America screenwriting credit system]] requires a screenwriter to contribute more than 50 percent of an original screenplay or 33 percent of an adaptation to receive credit.&lt;ref name="Abramowitz"/&gt; Uncredited screenwriters are not eligible to win the [[Academy Award]] or the [[Writers Guild of America Award]].

A script doctor should be distinguished from a [[script consultant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=|first=| url = https://www.scriptmag.com/script-doctor-vs-script-consultant-analyst | title=Do I Need a Script Doctor, a Script Consultant or a Story Analyst?|year=2005|work = Script|accessdate=November 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Many screenwriters have done uncredited work on screenplays:
* [[Paul Attanasio]] (born 1959): ''[[Speed (1994 film)|Speed]]'' (1994), ''[[Air Force One (film)|Air Force One]]'' (1997), ''[[Armageddon (1998 film)|Armageddon]]'' (1998), ''[[Patch Adams (film)|Patch Adams]]'' (1998), ''[[Town &amp; Country (film)|Town &amp; Country]]'' (2001), ''[[The Bourne Ultimatum]]'' (2007). "I really enjoy doing them. I basically analogize it to being the closer in baseball. There's something about the nature of that kind of pressure, where you're coming in at the ninth inning and throwing your fastball to three batters and leaving, that's exhilarating," Attanasio is quoted as saying from an article in the LA Times in 2002. 

* [[Al Boasberg]] (1891–1937): ''[[The General (1926 film)|The General]]'' (1926) and ''[[A Night at the Opera (film)|A Night at the Opera]]'' (1935).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Erickson|first=Hal|title=Al Boasberg - About This Person|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movies/person/158592/Al-Boasberg|work=The New York Times|accessdate=November 8, 2013|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Carrie Fisher]] (1956-2016): ''[[Hook (film)|Hook]]'' (1991),&lt;ref name="McNamara"&gt;{{cite web|last=McNamara|first=Jonathan|title=Carrie Fisher on Spy in the House of Me, Tinkerbell and being the movie industry's best script doctor|url=http://blogs.phoenixnewtimes.com/valleyfever/2008/04/carrie_fisher_on_spy_in_the_ho.php|work=Phoenix New Times|accessdate=August 19, 2012|date=April 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Sister Act]]'' (1992),&lt;ref name="Cagle"&gt;{{cite web|last=Cagle|first=Jess|title=The Prayer|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,310617,00.html|work=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=August 16, 2012|date=May 29, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Lethal Weapon 3]]'' (1992),&lt;ref name="McNamara"/&gt; ''[[Last Action Hero]]'' (1993),&lt;ref name="lahempire"&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.empireonline.com/features/last-action-hero | magazine=[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]] | title=The Life And Death Of Last Action Hero | issue=269 | author=Nick De Semlyen}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The River Wild]]'' (1994),&lt;ref name="McNamara"/&gt; and ''[[The Wedding Singer]]'' (1998).&lt;ref name="Setoodeh"&gt;{{cite web|last=Setoodeh|first=Ramin|title=Being Carrie Fisher|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2008/12/18/being-carrie-fisher.html|work=Newsweek|accessdate=August 16, 2012|date=December 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; An ''Entertainment Weekly'' article from May 1992 described her as "one of the most sought after doctors in town."&lt;ref name="Cagle"/&gt; When asked if she was still working as a script doctor in December 2008, she said: "I haven't done it for a few years. I did it for many years, and then younger people came to do it and I started to do new things. It was a long, very lucrative episode of my life. But it's complicated to do that. Now it's all changed, actually. Now in order to get a rewrite job, you have to submit your notes for your ideas on how to fix the script. So they can get all the notes from all the different writers, keep the notes and not hire you. That's free work and that's what I always call life-wasting events."&lt;ref name="Setoodeh"/&gt;

* [[Ben Hecht]] (1894–1964): ''[[Twentieth Century (film)|Twentieth Century]]'' (1934), ''[[A Star Is Born (1937 film)|A Star Is Born]]'' (1937), ''[[Angels with Dirty Faces]]'' (1938), ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' (1939), ''[[Stagecoach (1939 film)|Stagecoach]]'' (1939),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Booker|first=M.

Hecht was a snob, and hanging out at the [[Algonquin Hotel|Algonquin]] with [[Dorothy Parker]], it suited him to downplay his movie work, so he only received credit for about half of the 100 plus films he worked on."&lt;ref name="Morris"&gt;{{cite web|last=Morris|first=Mark|title=Get me Tom Stoppard|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/1999/nov/30/tvandradio.television2|work=The Guardian|accessdate=August 17, 2012|date=November 29, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Tom Mankiewicz]] (1942–2010): ''[[The Deep (1977 film)|The Deep]]'' (1977), ''[[The Spy Who Loved Me (film)|The Spy Who Loved Me]]'' (1977), ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' (1978), ''[[Moonraker (film)|Moonraker]]'' (1979), and ''[[Superman II]]'' (1980).

People had liked what they'd seen with the Bond films, especially the dialogue. I think that caught the attention of agents and studio heads, and they said, 'I want Mankiewicz to come in here and work on this project.'

* [[John Sayles]] (born 1950): ''[[Apollo 13 (film)|Apollo 13]]'' (1995), ''[[Mimic (film)|Mimic]]'' (1997). Sayles has stated that the script doctor's main role is to help others tell their stories. He decides which jobs to accept based on whether there is a germ of an idea for a movie he would actually like to see. He has also stated that he works harder when writing for others than he does on his own work.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzsfp7ufVyw&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Aaron Sorkin]] (born 1961): ''[[Schindler's List]]'' (1993), ''[[The Rock (film)|The Rock]]'' (1996), ''[[Excess Baggage (1997 film)|Excess Baggage]]'' (1997), and ''[[Enemy of the State (film)|Enemy of the State]]'' (1998). In an October 2010 interview, he said: "With the script doctoring, I did it for [[Jerry Bruckheimer]] for a while, because I was just going through a period where I was having a very difficult time coming up with my own ideas and I was climbing the walls. So I did what is called 'the production polish', where you are brought into the last two weeks on something that you are not emotionally invested in, where it is not your job to break the story, to come up with the moving parts and plot points. Basically, they just wanted some snappy dialogue for Sean Connery and Nicolas Cage. The first time I did it, actually, was for ''Schindler's List'' where no-one is looking for snappy dialogue, but the writer of that movie had gone on to direct a picture and there was a little more work that [director Steven Spielberg] wanted done before it went to Poland to begin shooting. He asked me to come in and do that, but you are obviously more interested in your own thing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lawrence|first=Will|title=Facebook movie The Social Network tells a Shakespearean tale of money, power and betrayal|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/arts-ents/film-tv-features/facebook-movie-the-social-network-tells-a-shakespearean-tale-of-money-power-and-betrayal-1.1060841|work=The Herald|accessdate=August 16, 2012|date=October 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the themes are still mine—but I don't think there's a single word of mine in the film."&lt;ref name="Rapkin"/&gt; According to an April 2010 interview with ''The Guardian'', Stoppard "does uncredited script-doctoring on Hollywood movies, 'about once a year': most recently he worked on Paul Greengrass's ''The Bourne Ultimatum''. 'The second reason for doing it is that you get to work with people you admire. The first reason, of course, is that it's overpaid.' Once, hearing the phone ring at home while in the shower, he took a call from [director] [[Paul Greengrass|Steven Spielberg]] on the set of ''[[Schindler's List]]'', agonising over a scene in [[Steven Zaillian]]{{'}}s script. Standing naked, Stoppard improvised a solution that was used in the movie. He remains bemused by this American habit of invisible script revision. 'I actually got quite angry with Spielberg, who was and is a good friend, and told him just to film Zaillian's script. But Steven, like a lot of other people in movies, tends to think one more opinion can't hurt.{{' "}}&lt;ref name="Lawson"/&gt; He also said, "I used to worry about it enormously, but it's a different culture. It's a moral issue, almost. A few years ago, I was invited to a film festival, as a freebie, because I'd done so much work on a movie that they said I should be there. And I said: 'I can't do that, because I'm not supposed to be on this film, and it's unfair to the chap whose name is on it.' But it just goes with the territory: these are the conditions one works under out there."&lt;ref name="Lawson"/&gt;

This is a situation I've been in a bunch of times. [...] ''Waterworld'' was a good idea, and the script was the classic, 'They have a good idea, then they write a generic script and don't really care about the idea.' When I was brought in, there was no water in the last 40 pages of the script. It all took place on land, or on a ship, or whatever. I'm like, 'Isn't the cool thing about this guy that he has gills?' And no one was listening. I was there basically taking notes from &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Kevin Costner]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, who was very nice, fine to work with, but he was not a writer. And he had written a bunch of stuff that they wouldn't let their staff touch. So I was supposed to be there for a week, and I was there for seven weeks, and I accomplished nothing. I wrote a few puns, and a few scenes that I can't even sit through because they came out so bad. It was the same situation with ''X-Men''. They said, 'Come in and punch up the big [[Climax (narrative)|climax]], the [[Three-act structure|third act]], and if you can, make it [[Film budgeting|cheaper]].' That was the mandate on both movies, and my response to both movies was, 'The problem with the third act is the first two acts.' But, again, no one was paying attention. [...] And then, in ''X-Men'', not only did they throw out my script and never tell me about it; they actually invited me to the [[read-through]], having thrown out my entire draft without telling me."&lt;ref name="Robinson"/&gt;

These theories conceive of second-language acquisition as being learned in the same way as any other skill, such as learning to drive a car or play the piano. That is, they see [[practice (learning method)|practice]] as the key ingredient of language acquisition. The most well-known of these theories is based on [[John Robert Anderson (psychologist)|John Anderson]]'s [[adaptive control of thought]] model.&lt;ref name="VanPatten2010skill"&gt;{{Harvnb|VanPatten|Benati|2010|pp=149–150}}, "Skill/s".&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Tabaré''''' is an [[epic poem]] written by [[Uruguay]]an poet [[Juan Zorrilla de San Martín]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.artelatino.com/foros/juan-zorrilla-por-francisco-arias-solis Juan Zorrilla por Francisco Arias Solís.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303182559/http://portal.artelatino.com/foros/juan-zorrilla-por-francisco-arias-solis |date=2016-03-03 }} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Written in 1886, it was published for the first time in 1888. The poem comprises 4736 [[Verse (poetry)|verse]]s divided into 10 [[canto]]s. The love story between the aboriginal Tabaré and the Spaniard Blanca is a metaphor of the fate of the [[Charrúa]] people who originally inhabited the [[Banda Oriental]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoresdeluruguay.uy/biblioteca/raul_montero_bustamante/archivo/textos/Prologo_Tabare.pdf Prólogo a ''Tabaré'' por Raúl Montero Bustamante] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303191241/http://www.autoresdeluruguay.uy/biblioteca/raul_montero_bustamante/archivo/textos/Prologo_Tabare.pdf |date=2016-03-03 }} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{IPA notice}}
This article deals with current phonology and [[phonetics]] and with historical developments of the [[phonology]] of the [[Tagalog language]], including variants.

Tagalog has [[allophone]]s, so it is important here to distinguish [[phoneme]]s (written in slashes / /) and corresponding allophones (written in brackets [ ]).

In final syllables, {{IPA|/i/}} can be pronounced {{IPA|[ɪ ~ i ~ e ~ ɛ]}}, as {{IPA|[e]}} and {{IPA|[ɛ]}} were formerly an [[allophone]] of {{IPA|/i/}}.

{{IPA|/i/}} before s-consonant clusters has a tendency to be dropped, as in ''isports'' {{IPA|[sports]}} ('sports') and ''istasyon'' {{IPA|[staˈʃon]}} ('station').

==Stress and glottalization==
Stress, coupled with glottalization, is a [[distinctive feature]] in Tagalog. Primary stress or the default position occurs on either the final or the penultimate syllable of a word. Vowel lengthening accompanies primary or secondary stress except when stress occurs at the end of a word.

Tagalog words are often distinguished from one another by the position of the stress and the presence of the glottal stop. In general, there are four types of phonetic emphases, which are, in formal or academic settings, indicated by a [[diacritic]] (''tuldík'') above the vowel. The penultimate primary stress position (''malumay'') is the default stress type and so is left unwritten except in dictionaries. The name of each stress type has its corresponding diacritic in the final vowel.

'''Technology readiness levels''' ('''TRL''') are a method of estimating [[technology maturity]] of Critical Technology Elements (CTE) of a program during the acquisition process. They are determined during a Technology Readiness Assessment (TRA) that examines program concepts, technology requirements, and demonstrated technology capabilities.  TRL are based on a scale from 1 to 9 with 9 being the most mature technology. The use of TRLs enables consistent, uniform discussions of technical maturity across different types of technology. TRL has been in widespread use at [[NASA]] since the 1980s where it was originally invented&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. In 1999 the [[United States Department of Defense|US Department of Defense]] was advised by [[Government Accountability Office|GAO]] to use the scale for procurement which it did from the early 2000s.  By 2008 the scale was also in use at the [[European Space Agency|European Space Agency (ESA)]] as it is evidenced by their [https://artes.esa.int/sites/default/files/TRL_Handbook.pdf handbook]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. The [[European Commission]] advised EU-funded research and innovation projects to adopt the scale in 2010&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; which they did from 2014 in its [https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/en/ Horizon 2020] [[Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development|program]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. In 2013 TRL was further canonized by the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 16290:2013 standard&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. A comprehensive approach and discussion about TRLs has been published by the European Association of Research and Technology Organisations ([http://www.earto.eu/ EARTO]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earto.eu/fileadmin/content/03_Publications/The_TRL_Scale_as_a_R_I_Policy_Tool_-_EARTO_Recommendations_-_Final.pdf The TRL scale as a Research &amp; Innovation Policy Tool]&lt;/ref&gt; Extensive criticism of the adoption of TRL scale by the European Union was published in The Innovation Journal, in that "concreteness and sophistication of the TRL scale gradually diminished as its usage spread outside its original context (space programs)".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==History==

Technology Readiness Levels were originally conceived at NASA in 1974 and formally defined in 1989. The original definition included seven levels, but in the 1990s NASA adopted the current nine-level scale that subsequently gained widespread acceptance.&lt;ref name="TRL Demystified"&gt;{{cite web|title = Technology Readiness Levels Demystified|author=Banke, Jim |date = 20 August 2010 |url = http://www.nasa.gov/topics/aeronautics/features/trl_demystified.html|publisher = [[NASA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The TRL methodology was originated by Stan Sadin at NASA Headquarters in 1974.&lt;ref name="TRL Demystified"/&gt; At that time, Ray Chase was the JPL Propulsion Division representative on the Jupiter Orbiter design team. At the suggestion of Stan Sadin, Mr Chase used this methodology to assess the technology readiness of the proposed JPL Jupiter Orbiter spacecraft design.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} Later Mr Chase spent a year at NASA Headquarters helping Mr Sadin institutionalize the TRL methodology. Mr Chase joined ANSER in 1978, where he used the TRL methodology to evaluate the technology readiness of proposed Air Force development programs. He published several articles during the 1980s and 90s on reusable launch vehicles utilizing the TRL methodology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = Chase, R.L.|title = ''Methodology for Assessing Technological and Manufacturing Readiness of NASP-Technology Enabled Vehicles (AIAA 91-2389)'', presented at the 27th Joint Propulsion Conference, June 24-26, 1991, Sacramento CA |date = 26 June 1991|url = http://papers.sae.org/965565/}}&lt;/ref&gt; These documented an expanded version of the methodology that included design tools, test facilities, and manufacturing readiness on the Air Force Have Not program.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} The Have Not program manager, Greg Jenkins, and Ray Chase published the expanded version of the TRL methodology, which included design and manufacturing.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} Leon McKinney and Mr Chase used the expanded version to assess the technology readiness of the ANSER team's Highly Reusable Space Transportation ("HRST") concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|display-authors = 4|author = R.

The [[United States Air Force]] adopted the use of Technology Readiness Levels in the 1990s.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

In 1995, [[John C. Mankins]], NASA, wrote a paper&lt;ref name="Mankins"&gt;[http://www.nss.org/settlement/ssp/library/2000-testimony-JohnMankins.htm Statement of John C. Mankins] U.S. House Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics Committee on Science, Sep 7, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; that discussed NASA's use of TRLs and proposed expanded descriptions for each TRL. In 1999, the United States [[General Accounting Office]] produced an influential report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Best Practices: Better Management of Technology Can Improve Weapon System Outcomes (GAO/NSIAD-99-162)|date = July 1999 |url = http://www.gao.gov/archive/1999/ns991620.pdf|publisher = [[General Accounting Office]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; that examined the differences in [[technology transfer|technology transition]] between the DOD and private industry. It concluded that the DOD takes greater risks and attempts to transition emerging technologies at lesser degrees of maturity than does private industry. The GAO concluded that use of immature technology increased overall program risk. The GAO recommended that the DOD make wider use of Technology Readiness Levels as a means of assessing technology maturity prior to transition. In 2001, the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Science and Technology issued a memorandum that endorsed use of TRLs in new major programs. Guidance for assessing technology maturity was incorporated into the ''Defense Acquisition Guidebook''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://at.dod.mil/docs/DefenseAcquisitionGuidebook.pdf ''Defense Acquisition Guidebook''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425232741/http://at.dod.mil/docs/DefenseAcquisitionGuidebook.pdf |date=2012-04-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the DOD developed detailed guidance for using TRLs in the 2003 DOD Technology Readiness Assessment Deskbook.

=== TRL in the European Union&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mihaly|first=Heder|date=September 2017|title=From NASA to EU: the evolution of the TRL scale in Public Sector Innovation|url=https://www.innovation.cc/discussion-papers/22_2_3_heder_nasa-to-eu-trl-scale.pdf|journal=The Innovation Journal|volume=22|pages=1–23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011071816/https://www.innovation.cc/discussion-papers/22_2_3_heder_nasa-to-eu-trl-scale.pdf|archive-date=October 11, 2017|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ===
The European Space Agency adopted the TRL scale in the mid-2000s. Its handbook&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Technology Readiness Levels Handbook For Space Applications|last=|first=|publisher=European Space Agency|year=2008|isbn=|location=https://artes.esa.int/sites/default/files/TRL_Handbook.pdf|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; closely follows the NASA definition of TRLs. The universal usage of TRL in EU policy was proposed in the final report of the first High Level Expert Group on Key Enabling Technologies&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/DocsRoom/documents/11283/attachments/1/translations/en/renditions/native|title=High-Level Expert Group on Key Enabling Technologies - Final Report|last=|first=|date=2011|website=|access-date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and it was indeed implemented in the subsequent EU framework program, called H2020, running from 2013 to 2020&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. This means not only space and weapons programs, but everything from nanotechnology to informatics and communication technology.

==Assessment tools==
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:TPMM Process Icon.jpg]] --&gt;[[Image:TPMM transition mech.jpg|right|300px|TPMM Transition Mechanism]]

A ''Technology Readiness Level Calculator'' was developed by the [[United States Air Force]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = Nolte, William L.|title = ''Technology Readiness Level Calculator, Air Force Research Laboratory'', presented at the NDIA Systems Engineering Conference |date = 20 October 2003|url = http://www.dtic.mil/ndia/2003systems/nolte.ppt|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; This tool is a standard set of questions implemented in [[Microsoft Excel]] that produces a graphical display of the TRLs achieved. This tool is intended to provide a snapshot of technology maturity at a given point in time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Technology Assessment Calculator|url = https://acc.dau.mil/CommunityBrowser.aspx?id=320594}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Technology Program Management Model'' was developed by the [[United States Army]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = Craver, Jeffrey T.|title = ''Technology Program Management Model, Army Space and Missile Defense Command Technical Center'', presented at the NDIA Systems Engineering Conference |date = 26 October 2006|url = http://www.dtic.mil/ndia/2006systems/Thursday/crave.pdf|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The TPMM is a TRL-gated high-fidelity activity model that provides a flexible management tool to assist Technology Managers in planning, managing, and assessing their technologies for successful technology transition.  The model provides a core set of activities including [[systems engineering]] and [[program management]] tasks that are tailored to the technology development and management goals.  This approach is comprehensive, yet it consolidates the complex activities that are relevant to the development and transition of a specific technology program into one integrated model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = ''TPMM - Technology Program Management Model'' (only available to DOD components)|url = https://acc.dau.mil/CommunityBrowser.aspx?id=148163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==

The primary purpose of using technology readiness levels is to help management in making decisions concerning the development and transitioning of technology. It should be viewed as one of several tools that are needed to manage the progress of research and development activity within an organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = Christophe Deutsch|author2 = Chiara Meneghini|author3 = Ozzy Mermut|author4 = Martin Lefort|title = Measuring Technology Readiness to improve Innovation Management|accessdate = 2011-11-27|url = http://www.ino.ca/Docs/Documents/publications/scientifiques/Deutch_Measuring%20technology%20readiness%20to%20improve%20innovation%20management.pdf|publisher = INO|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120602044401/http://www.ino.ca/Docs/Documents/publications/scientifiques/Deutch_Measuring%20technology%20readiness%20to%20improve%20innovation%20management.pdf|archivedate = 2012-06-02|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the advantages of TRLs:&lt;ref name="hfidtc"&gt;{{cite web|author = Ben Dawson|title = The Impact of Technology Insertion on Organisations|date = 31 October 2007|url = http://www.hfidtc.com/research/process/reports/phase-2/HFIDTC-2-12-2-1-1-tech-organisation.pdf|publisher = Human Factors Integration Design Technology Centre|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120426001612/http://www.hfidtc.com/research/process/reports/phase-2/HFIDTC-2-12-2-1-1-tech-organisation.pdf|archivedate = 26 April 2012|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Provides a common understanding of technology status
* Risk management
* Used to make decisions concerning technology funding
* Used to make decisions concerning transition of technology

Some of the characteristics of TRLs that limit their utility:&lt;ref name ="hfidtc" /&gt;

* Readiness does not necessarily fit with appropriateness or technology maturity
* A mature product may possess a greater or lesser degree of readiness for use in a particular system context than one of lower maturity
* Numerous factors must be considered, including the relevance of the products' operational environment to the system at hand, as well as the product-system architectural mismatch

Current TRL models tend to disregard negative and obsolescence factors. There have been suggestions made for incorporating such factors into assessments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = Ricardo Valerdi|author2 = Ron J. Kohl|title = ''An Approach to Technology Risk Management'', Engineering Systems Division Symposium MIT, Cambridge, MA, March 29-31, 2004 |date = March 2004|url = http://web.mit.edu/rvalerdi/www/TRL%20paper%20ESD%20Valerdi%20Kohl.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For complex technologies that incorporate various development stages, a more detailed scheme called the Technology Readiness Pathway Matrix has been developed going from basic units to applications in society. This tool aims to show that a readiness level of a technology is based on a less linear process but on a more complex pathway through its application in society.. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = Vincent Jamier|author2 = Christophe Aucher|title = ''Demystifying Technology Readiness Levels for Complex Technologies'', Leitat, Barcelona, April 24, 2018 |date = April 2018|url = https://projects.leitat.org/demystifying-trls-for-complex-technologies/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
