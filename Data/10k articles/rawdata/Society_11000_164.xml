'''''A Matter of Time''''' is a novel by [[Glen Cook]], combining elements of science fiction (specifically, [[time travel]]), [[crime fiction]] and [[spy thriller]]. In regard to the last, the novel in particular takes up and expands the theme of American [[prisoners of war]] being [[brainwashing|brainwashed]] in [[China|Communist China]] and their loyalties reversed – a theme made famous through the novel ''[[The Manchurian Candidate]]'' and [[The Manchurian Candidate (1962 film)|film]] made on its basis.

The book was re-published in 2011, along with other earlier works of Glen Cook.

==Plot summary==

The book has three distinct plot lines, set out in alternating chapters, and weaving back and forth in time. The reader, sharing the various points of view of the alternating characters, is in effect omniscient, knowing many things which are a mystery to the characters themselves.

===First plot line ("The Y Axis")===
The main plot line centers on Norman Cash, a middle aged police detective sergeant at [[St. Louis, Missouri]] and his younger partner John Harald. On 3 March 1975, the police is perplexed at finding a body on a snowbound street. The man had died of unclear causes, cannot be identified or accounted for by any investigation, is not on file anywhere and carried nothing on his body except for a handful of American coins from the early 20th Century – the latest being a 1921 coin in mint condition.

The body was found near the home of an old lady of Central European origin named Fiala Groloch, who politely receives the police in her old-fashioned parlor, offering them tea. There is no evidence against her but Cash still feels suspicious – especially when records show the woman to be incredibly old, having lived in the same house continually since 1869. Also, old police records show that in 1921 a small-time criminal named Jack O'Brian disappeared mysteriously on the same spot; the police at the time suspected Groloch of killing him – since he had been her lover and badly abused her – but were never able to find the body. Some witnesses are found to testify that the body found in 1975 does strongly resemble the Jack O'Brian who disappeared in 1921. However, in order to link the two cases it must be assumed that [[time travel]] exists, a conclusion Cash's commander shies away from, for fear of being ridiculed should the story leak to the media, and Cash is ordered to take up other cases.

At the time, the fall of [[South Vietnam]] hits Cash hard, reviving the trauma of his soldier son Michael having gone [[missing in action]] in Vietnam back in 1967 and no certain information of his fate ever being found out. It increases the tie between Cash and his partner John, Michael's childhood friend who had been with him in Vietnam on the day he was lost.

After some time, Cash takes up the Groloch investigation again, and from a rather "loony" affair it becomes deadly serious and grim: evidence is discovered that at various times people who went into the old lady's house disappeared without a trace, including several armed gangsters; then Cash's partner John also disappears when attempting an unauthorized search of the house; when police raid the house in force, they find the old lady gone, and mysterious machinery hidden in the basement turns out to be bobby-trapped, exploding and causing more police casualties; then in another part of the town, the house of a doctor – also a refugee from Europe – burns and mysterious bodies are found in the wreckage – which seems somehow tied to the Groloch affair; and the CIA turns out to have a considerable interest in all these doings... Cash, now bitterly determined to settle accounts with the sinister Groloch, has one ace left up his sleeve: he knows of another Groloch who had been living for a century at [[Rochester, New York]], assumes that the fugitive woman went there, and sets out in pursuit.

===Second plot line ("The X Axis")===
In a dystopian 2058, the world is in the grip of a totalitarian State in which [[Czechs]] are the top dogs, and the center of power is the fearsome headquarters of the Agency for State Security at [[Prague]]. The State's virtually invincible weapon is the [[Tachyon]] Displacement Data Transfer System by which the Agency can send messages into the past, warn itself of coming threats and take action to eliminate them. The system is tended by the brilliant Zumsteg brothers, Otho and Stephan, who are honest in their way and completely devoted to the State. But the psychotic Colonel Neulist, consumed with jealousy of the Zumstegs and angry because Otho's daughter Marda rejected his advances, bursts into the chamber and starts wildly shooting – causing the Tachyon system to explode. Everybody's physical bodies are destroyed, but the personalities of both the Zumstegs and their foe 
Neulist are hurled into the past.

The three Zumstegs find themselves in 1866, inhabiting the bodies of peasants in the then obscure village of Lidice; few people show an interest in the doings of these peasants while the great [[Battle of Königgrätz]] is fought some kilometers away. Knowing that Neulist might eventually appear in the past, the Zumstegs take the name of Groloch. In possession of advanced medical knowledge which can extend human lifespan to two hundred years and more, they decide to take the slow road back to their own time. Two of them cross the Atlantic and hole up in America, patiently waiting for the 21st Century and for their beloved State to arise – Marda Zumsteg/Fiala Groloch in St. Louis, and her uncle Stephan, as Fian Groloch, in Rochester. The third, Otho Zumsteg/Fial Groloch, remains in Bohemia, taking up residence in the village of Lidice.

However, the vengeful Neulist does appear eventually and gets on his tracks. In 1942, it is the nefarious Neulist who manipulates the Nazi occupiers to destroy [[Lidice]], causing one of the most notorious atrocities of [[World War II]] to be perpetrated just in order that his hated rival be among the victims. After the war, Neulist goes to America to settle accounts with the other two Zumstegs. He eventually gets on the trace in St. Louis, and is behind some of the sinister events which perplexed Sergeant Cash. When Fiala Groloch flees to Rochester, Neulist is also in hot pursuit of her.

===Third plot line ("The Z Axis")===

In Beijing, the genius psychologist and spy master Huang Hua had spent decades secretly improving the methods of [[brainwashing]] which had not worked out in the [[Korean War]]. With the outbreak of the [[Vietnam War]], the Chinese get their [[North Vietnam]]ese allies to secretly deliver some American prisoners to Huang's installation in the [[Gobi Desert]].

Among these prisoners, considered [[Missing in action|MIA]]'s in the US, is Sergeant Cash's son Michael Cash. Huang's techniques work on him and he becomes an ardent [[Maoist]], committed to overthrowing American Imperialism and dreaming of himself becoming the American Mao. Huang decides to keep him and a few other Americans in China, while other brainwashed prisoners are sent back to Vietnam and eventually repatriated – to act as Chinese [[sleeper agent]]s in the US.

Michael Cash rises high within the Chinese espionage system. Still, he remains flawed from Huang's point of view, being still motivated by personal feelings and not having achieved the requisite complete ruthlessness. In particular, he retains his friendship with a fellow-prisoner, Sergeant A.O."Snake" Cantrell. A fierce individualist resisting all authority, Capitalist or Communist alike, Cantrell proved immune to even the worse which Huang could do. He was destined to be sent to hard labor and die unknown in China – but Michael Cash connives at letting him join the repatriated prisoners, carrying back his knowledge of the Chinese brainwashing program. An observant journalist suspects that the returning POW's had been brainwashed and talks to Cantrell – but Cantrell refuses to be involved in anti-Communist propaganda, either, eventually ending up as a rock guitar player in Britain. Still, some editorials in the US point to the possibility of brainwashing, and Huang discovers the source of the leak.

Meanwhile, Michael Cash had been sent to [[Prague]], to establish Chinese contacts with dissenting elements in the local Communist Party towards an eventual showdown between China and the USSR. He succeeds in the mission – but has also fallen deeply in love with his Czech Communist contact person, a woman named Ilse, left her bearing his child, and dreams hopelessly of building a life with her. However, Huang – far from open to his agent's romantic dreams – is furious at discovering Cash's having let Cantrell get away and endanger the entire program.

Michael Cash is sternly ordered to "correct his egoistic mistake" and himself go to Britain and assassinate his friend. Cash – knowing that refusal would lead to his liquidation and that Cantrell would then be killed anyway by another Chinese agent – goes through with shooting Cantrell by sniper rifle during a performance. However, he vows revenge on Huang, who had forced him into this "act of cannibalism".

===Convegence of plot lines===

The book's diverging plot lines come together with the explosive showdown at Rochester. Detective Cash catches up with the fugitive Grolochs, but their nemesis Neulist also comes on the scene. In the confrontation Norman Cash learns that his son Michael is still alive and is in China. Neulist fatally shoots the Grolochs and escapes. Before dying, Fiala Groloch – of whom Cash thought as an ancient old lady – reveals to Cash that in fact she is his great-granddaughter from the 21st Century, and that his son Michael was her grandfather.

Michael Cash is destined to be one of the major figures of human history, as influential in the second half of the 20th Century as [[Hitler]] was in its first half. When the Chinese and Russians embark on an all-out confrontation and smash each other up, Michael Cash would escape to Prague and – along with his Czech beloved, Ilse Zumsteg – would forge a new power hub centered on the Czech capital, becoming a world dictator of unprecedented power.

Having been given this shattering information, the shaken father Norman Cash is now in a position to change the course of history. He could still avert this entire future and redeem his lost son.

==Critical appraisal==

Reviewer Malcolm Wide&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm Wide, "Popular culture depictions of The Cold War and their impact on actual international relations" in Abraham Zweig (ed.) "Retrospective view on the 1945–1985 international confrontation of the superpowers".&lt;/ref&gt; noted that

&lt;blockquote&gt;Cook's ''A Matter of Time'' was written in 1984 and published in 1985 – at the same time that [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] came to power in Moscow, but before the public in the West became aware that [[perestroika]] was a radical departure from all that had gone before. This was in essence the last 'window of opportunity' for an American writer to write a Cold War book holding out the specter of a Communist takeover. ... Detective Sergeant Norman Cash believes that "The Fall of Saigon marked the East's watershed victory in World War III. The West had been fighting a halfhearted and half-assed delaying action since 1945; Vietnam had marked the beginning of the end. From the fall of Saigon onward the collapse would cease to be gradual. The West, whether good or evil or whatever, was about to come apart, and at a rate which, historically speaking, would be precipitous. Cash supposed that he would live long enough to see the barbarians at the gates himself" (though he would hardly conceive of the idea that the barbarians' chieftain would be his own son ...). Already in 1986, it would have been implausible – to say the least – to seriously promote this view of the situation. ...'' A Matter of Time''  could be seen as setting a suitable [[:wikt:coda|coda]] to a very extensive genre, which exercised a considerable influence over popular imagination over decades. As such, it does possess some original and unique features. A renegade American setting up a global Communist dictatorship centered on Prague is an idea whose like was never conceived of before. ... One may, if one wishes, regard the world where we actually live today as resulting from Detective Sergeant Cash catching up with his prodigal son in London and preventing Michael from assassinating his Vietnam buddy.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Anti-German sentiment''' (or '''Germanophobia''') is defined as an opposition to or fear of [[Germany]], its [[Germans|inhabitants]], its [[Culture of Germany|culture]] and the [[German language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition |publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin]] |year=2000 |location= |pages= |url= |doi= |id= |isbn=0-395-82517-2 |author= executive editor, Joseph P. Pickett}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its opposite is [[Germanophilia]].  The sentiment largely began with the mid-19th century [[unification of Germany]], which made the new nation a rival to the [[Great Powers]] of Europe on economic, manufacturing, and military grounds.

==19th century==

===Russia===
In the 1860s Russia experienced an outbreak of Germanophobia, mainly restricted to a small group of writers in [[St. Petersburg]] who had united around a right-wing newspaper. It began in 1864 with the publication of an article by a writer (using the pseudonym "Shedoferotti") who proposed that [[Poland]] be given autonomy and that the privileges of the German barons in the [[Baltic governorates]] and [[Finland]] be preserved. [[Mikhail Katkov]] published a harsh criticism of the article in the ''[[Moscow News]]'', which in turn caused a flood of angry articles in which Russian writers expressed their irritation with Europeans, some of which featured direct attacks on Germans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Marietta Stepaniants |title=Religion and Identity in Modern Russia: The Revival of Orthodoxy and Islam |publisher=Routledge |year=2017 |pages=45–47 |isbn=9781351905145 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uVFBDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year, 1865, the 100th anniversary of the death of [[Mikhail Lomonosov]] was marked throughout the Russian empire. Articles were published mentioning the difficulties Lomonosov had encountered from the foreign members of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]], most of whom had been of German descent. The authors then criticized contemporary German scholars for their neglect of the Russian language and for printing articles in foreign languages while receiving funds from the Russian people. It was further suggested by some writers that Russian citizens of German origin who did not speak Russian and follow the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox faith]] should be considered foreigners. It was also proposed that people of German descent be forbidden from holding diplomatic posts as they might not have "solidarity with respect to Russia".

Despite the press campaign against Germans, Germanophobic feelings did not develop in Russia to any widespread extent, and died out, due to the Imperial family's German roots and the presence of many German names in the Russian political elite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Forest|first=Benjamin |title=Religion and Identity in Modern Russia |publisher=Ashgate Publishing |year=2005 |pages=45–47 |isbn=0-7546-4272-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Great Britain===
Negative comments about Germany had begun to appear in Britain in the 1870s, following the Prussian victory in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] in 1870–71.&lt;ref&gt;Paul M. Kennedy, "Idealists and realists: British views of Germany, 1864–1939." ''Transactions of the Royal Historical Society'' 25 (1975): 137–156.&lt;/ref&gt;  Criticisms were expressed in the press and in the birth of the [[invasion novel]] (e.g. ''[[The Battle of Dorking]]''), many of which focused on the idea that Britain might be Germany's next victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Scully|title=British Images of Germany: Admiration, Antagonism &amp; Ambivalence, 1860–1914|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XC5qaGcZpyAC&amp;pg=PA98|year=2012|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1887, the label ''[[Made in Germany]]'' was introduced, to get British buyers to adhere to the concept of "buying British". After suffering slight losses, German manufacturers soon found the label to be of good use.

In the 1890s there was widespread hostility towards foreigners in Britain, mainly directed against eastern European Jews but also including Germans. Joseph Bannister believed that German residents in Britain were mostly "gambling-house keepers, hotel-porters, barbers, 'bullies', runaway conscripts, bath-attendants, street musicians, criminals, bakers, socialists, cheap clerks, etc". Interviewees for the Royal Commission on Alien Immigration believed that Germans were involved in prostitution and burglary, and many people also viewed Germans working in Britain as threatening the livelihood of Britons by being willing to work for longer hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Herbert A. Strauss|title=Germany – Great Britain – France|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HoQuWDqb4nIC&amp;pg=PA352|year=1993|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|pages=352–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-German hostility deepened since early 1896 after the [[Kruger telegram]] of [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]], in which he congratulated [[Paul Kruger|President Kruger]] of the [[South African Republic|Transvaal]] on resisting the British [[Jameson Raid]]. Attacks on Germans in London were reported in the German press at the time but do not appear to have actually occurred. The ''[[Saturday Review (London)]]'' suggested "be ready to fight Germany, as ''Germania delenda est''" ("Germany is to be destroyed", a reference to the [[Carthago delenda est|coda against the Carthaginians]] adopted by [[Cato the Elder]]'s speeches in the second Roman Republic).  The Kaiser's reputation was further degraded by his angry tirade and the [[Daily Telegraph Affair]].&lt;ref&gt;Lothar Reinermann, "Fleet Street and the Kaiser: British Public Opinion and Wilhelm II." ''German History'' 26.4 (2008): 469–485.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Early 20th century==
Following the signing of the [[Entente Cordiale]] in 1904 between Britain and France, official relationships cooled as did popular attitudes towards Germany and German residents in Britain.  A fear of German militarism replaced a previous admiration for German culture and literature. At the same time, journalists produced a stream of articles on the threat posed by Germany.&lt;ref&gt;R. B. Mowat, "Great Britain and Germany in the Early Twentieth Century," ''English Historical Review'' (1931) 46#183 pp. 423–441 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/552674 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  In the [[Daily Telegraph Affair]] of 1908–1909, the Kaiser humiliated himself and further soured relations by his intemperate attacks on Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas G. Otte, "‘An altogether unfortunate affair’: Great Britain and the daily telegraph affair." ''Diplomacy and Statecraft'' 5#2 (1994): 296–333.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1894 [[Alfred Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Northcliffe|Alfred Harmsworth]] commissioned author [[William Le Queux]] to write the serial novel ''[[The Great War in England in 1897]]'', which featured France and Russia combining forces to crush Britain, who was, with German intervention, able to rally a force to turn the tide. Twelve years later Harmsworth asked him to change sentiment, promising the full support of his formidable advertising capabilities. The result was the bestselling ''[[The Invasion of 1910]]'', which originally appeared in serial form in the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' in 1906 and has been referred to by historians as inducing an atmosphere of paranoia, mass hysteria and Germanophobia that would climax in the Naval Scare of 1908–09.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Usandizaga | first = Aránzazu | first2 = Andrew | last2 = Monnickendam | title = Dressing Up For War | publisher = Rodopi | year = 2001 | pages = 60–61 | isbn = 90-420-1367-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Articles in the ''Daily Mail'' regularly advocated anti-German sentiments throughout the 20th century, telling British readers to refuse service at restaurants by Austrian or German waiters on the claim that they were spies and told them that if a German-sounding waiter claimed to be Swiss that they should demand to see the waiter's passport.&lt;ref&gt;Philipp Blom. ''The Vertigo Years: Change and Culture in the West, 1900–1914''. Basic Books, 2010. Pp. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1903 [[Erskine Childers (author)|Erskine Childers]] published [[The Riddle of the Sands|''The Riddle of the Sands: A Record of Secret Service'']] a [[1903 in literature|novel]] in which two Englishmen uncover a  plot by Germany to Invade England; it was later made into a 1979 film [[The Riddle of the Sands (film)|The Riddle of the Sands]].

At the same time, conspiracy theories were concocted combining [[History of the Jews in Germany|Germanophobia with antisemitism]], concerning the supposed foreign control of Britain, some of which blamed Britain's entry into the Boer War on international financiers "chiefly German in origin and Jewish in race".&lt;ref&gt;Panayi, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these ideas about German-Jewish conspiracies originated from right-wing figures such as [[Arnold White]], [[Hilaire Belloc]], and [[Leo Maxse]], the latter using his publication the ''[[National Review (London)|National Review]]'' to spread them.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

{{Discrimination sidebar}}
In 1914 when the German army invaded neutral Belgium and northern France many thousands of Belgian and French civilians were accused of being [[francs-tireurs]] and executed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wieland|first=Lothar |authorlink= |title=Die Frage des belgischen "Franktireurkrieges" und die deutsche öffentliche Meinung 1914–1936 |publisher=Peter Lang |year=1984 |location=Frankfurt am Main|pages=1–38 |url= |doi= |id= |isbn=0-7546-4272-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[German war crimes#World War I|These acts]] were used to encourage anti-German sentiments and the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]] produced propaganda depicting Germans as ''[[List of terms used for Germans|Huns]]'' capable of infinite cruelty and violence.

===Great Britain===
In Great Britain, anti-German feeling led to infrequent rioting, assaults on suspected Germans and the looting of stores owned by people with German-sounding names, occasionally even taking on an [[Antisemitism in the United Kingdom|antisemitic]] tone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Panayi |first=P. |title=Anti-German Riots in London during the First World War |journal=German History |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=184–203 |publisher= Oxford Journals |year=1989 |url= http://gh.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pdf_extract/7/2/184 |doi= 10.1093/gh/7.2.184 |accessdate=30 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Increasing anti-German hysteria even threw suspicion upon the British royal family. [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] was persuaded to change his German name of [[Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]] to [[House of Windsor|Windsor]] and relinquish all German titles and styles on behalf of his relatives who were British subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Baldick |first=Chris | first2=Jonathan |last2=Bate |title=The Oxford English Literary History: 1910–1940 |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2006 |location= |pages=303–304 |isbn=0-19-818310-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prince Louis of Battenberg]] was not only forced to change his name to Mountbatten, he was forced to resign as First Sea Lord, the most senior position in the Royal Navy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Geordie Greig|title=The King Maker: The Man Who Saved George VI|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YCMrAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT73|year=2014|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[German Shepherd]] breed of dog was renamed to the euphemistic "Alsatian"; the [[The Kennel Club|English Kennel Club]] only re-authorised the use of 'German Shepherd' as an official name in 1977.{{citation needed|date = October 2018}}

Attitudes to Germany were not entirely negative among British troops fighting on the Western Front; the British writer [[Nicholas Shakespeare]] quotes this statement from a letter written by his grandfather during the First World War in which he says he would rather fight the French and describes German bravery:

{{quote|Personally, my opinion is that our fellows get on much best [sic] with the Germans, and would very much rather be fighting the French!&amp;nbsp;... It was a fine sight to see the Germans coming on in solid formation, in front of our machine guns&amp;nbsp;... they were generally led by one officer in front who came along to certain death as cool as a cucumber, with his sword held straight up in front of him at the salute.| Nicholas Shakespeare, ''The first casualty of war''.&lt;ref name="Shakespeare"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/bookclub/story/0,,1656271,00.html|title=The first casualty of war|last=Shakespeare|first=Nicholas |newspaper=The Guardian |date=December 3, 2005|accessdate=19 January 2011|location=London &lt;!-- second of two date parameters; unable to check which is correct 2015-07-12 |date=2005-12-06 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Robert Graves]] who like the King also had German relatives, wrote shortly after the war during his time at [[Oxford University]] as an undergraduate that: 	
{{quote|The eighteenth century owed its unpopularity largely to its Frenchness. Anti-French feeling among most ex-soldiers amounted almost to an obsession. Edmund, shaking with nerves, used to say at this time: "No more wars for me at any price! Except against the French. If ever there is a war against them, I'll go like a shot." Pro-German feeling had been increasing. With the war over and the German armies beaten, we could give the German soldier credit for being the most efficient fighting man in Europe&amp;nbsp;... Some undergraduates even insisted that we had been fighting on the wrong side: our natural enemies were the French.|Robert Graves ''[[Goodbye to All That]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=Robert |last=Graves|authorlink=Robert Graves |title=Goodbye to All That |series=Penguin twentieth-century classics |edition=illustrated, reprint |publisher=Penguin |location=UK |year=2000 |isbn=9780141184593 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Xi66fGN3FdkC&amp;pg=PT360&amp;lpg=PT360#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 240]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

===Canada===
In Canada, there was some anti-German sentiment in [[Waterloo County, Ontario]], primarily in the city of Berlin, Ontario before and during WW I and some cultural sanctions on the community.&lt;ref name="historicplaces.ca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historicplaces.ca/en/rep-reg/place-lieu.aspx?id=3297|title=HistoricPlaces.ca – HistoricPlaces.ca|website=www.historicplaces.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were anti-German riots in [[Victoria, British Columbia]] and [[Calgary, Alberta]] in the first years of the war.{{citation needed|date = October 2018}}

It was this anti-German sentiment that precipitated the [[Berlin to Kitchener name change]] in 1916. The city was named after [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]], famously pictured on the "[[Lord Kitchener Wants You]]" recruiting posters. Several streets in Toronto that had previously been named for Liszt, Humboldt, Schiller, Bismarck, etc., were changed to names with strong British associations, such as Balmoral.{{citation needed|date = October 2018}}

The Governor General of Canada, the Duke of Connaught, while visiting Berlin, Ontario, in May 1914, had discussed the importance of [[Canadians of German ethnicity]] (regardless of their origin) in a speech: "It is of great interest to me that many of the citizens of Berlin are of German descent. I well know the admirable qualities – the thoroughness, the tenacity, and the loyalty of the great Teutonic Race, to which I am so closely related. I am sure that these inherited qualities will go far in the making of good Canadians and loyal citizens of the British Empire".&lt;ref&gt;"City on Edge: Berlin Becomes Kitchener in 1916" Exhibit at Waterloo Region Museum, on display 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, by 1919 most of the population of what would become Kitchener, Waterloo, and Elmira were "Canadian"; over 95 percent had been born in Ontario.&lt;ref&gt;

The German-speaking Mennonites were pacifist so they could not enlist and the few who had immigrated from Germany (not born in Canada) could not morally fight against a country that was a significant part of their heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wartimecanada.ca/document/world-war-i/conscription/mennonites-and-conscription|title=Mennonites and conscription – Wartime Canada|website=wartimecanada.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

News reports during the war years indicate that "A Lutheran minister was pulled out of his house ... he was dragged through the streets. German clubs were ransacked through the course of the war.

Across Canada, internment camps opened in 1915 and 8,579 "enemy aliens" were held there until the end of the war; many were German speaking immigrants from Austria, Hungary, Germany, and the Ukraine. Only 3,138 were classed as prisoners of war; the rest were civilians.&lt;ref&gt;

Built in 1926, the [[Waterloo Pioneer Memorial Tower]] in rural Kitchener, Ontario, commemorates the settlement by the [[Pennsylvania Dutch]] (actually Pennsilfaanisch ''Deitsch'' or ''German''){{sfn|Elliot|1988|p=105}} of the [[Grand River (Ontario)|Grand River]] area in the 1800s in what later became [[Waterloo County, Ontario]].&lt;ref name="historicplaces.ca"/&gt;

There was also anti-German sentiment in Canada during [[World War II]]. Under the [[War Measures Act]], some 26 POW camps opened and were filled with those who had been born in Germany, Italy, and particularly in Japan, if they were deemed to be "enemy aliens". For Germans, this applied especially to single males who had some association with the Nazi Party of Canada. No compensation was paid to them after the war.&lt;ref&gt;

===Australia===
[[File:World War I-era Australian 'Anti-German League' badge circa 1915.jpg|thumb|left|A 1915 Australian badge reflecting the Anti-German sentiment at the time]]
In Australia, an official proclamation of August 10, 1914 required all German citizens to register their domiciles at the nearest police station and to notify authorities of any change of address. Under the later Aliens Restriction Order of May 27, 1915, enemy aliens who had not been interned had to report to the police once a week and could only change address with official permission. An amendment to the Restriction Order in July 1915 prohibited enemy aliens and naturalized subjects from changing their name or the name of any business they ran. Under the [[War Precautions Act]] of 1914 (which survived the First World War), publication of German language material was prohibited and schools attached to [[Lutheran]] churches were forced to abandon German as the language of teaching or were closed by the authorities. German clubs and associations were also closed.&lt;ref name=jupp&gt;{{cite book |last=Jupp |first=James |title=The Australian People |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2001 |pages=371–372 |isbn=0-521-80789-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original German names of settlements and streets were officially changed. In [[South Australia]], ''Grunthal'' became ''[[Verdun, South Australia|Verdun]]'' and ''Krichauff'' became ''Beatty''. In [[New South Wales]] ''Germantown'' became ''[[Holbrook, New South Wales|Holbrook]]'' after the submarine commander [[Norman Douglas Holbrook]].&lt;ref name=jupp/&gt; This pressure was strongest in [[South Australia]] where 69 towns changed their names, including Petersburg, South Australia, which became [[Peterborough, South Australia|Peterborough]] (see [[Australian place names changed from German names]]).

Most of the anti-German feeling was created by the press that tried to create the idea that all those of German birth or descent supported Germany uncritically. A booklet circulated widely in 1915 claimed that "there were over 3,000 German spies scattered throughout the states". Anti-German propaganda was also inspired by local and British companies who were keen to take the opportunity to eliminate Germany as a competitor in the Australian market. Germans in Australia were increasingly portrayed as evil by the very nature of their origins.&lt;ref name=jupp/&gt;

{{see also|American entry into World War I}}
After the revelation of the [[Zimmermann Telegram]] partly sparked the American declaration of war against Imperial Germany in April 1917, German Americans were sometimes accused of being too sympathetic to Germany. Former president [[Theodore Roosevelt]] denounced "[[hyphenated American]]ism", insisting that dual loyalties were impossible in wartime. A small minority came out for Germany, or ridiculed the British (as did [[H. L. Mencken]]).

===United Kingdom===
In 1940 the [[Minister of Information|Ministry of Information]] launched an "Anger Campaign" to instill "personal anger&amp;nbsp;... against the German people and Germany", because the British were "harbouring little sense of real personal animus against the average German". This was done to strengthen British resolve against the Germans. [[Robert Vansittart, 1st Baron Vansittart|Sir Robert Vansittart]], the [[Foreign Office]]'s chief diplomatic advisor until 1941, gave a series of radio broadcasts in which he said that Germany was a nation raised on "envy, self-pity and cruelty" whose historical development had [[Sonderweg|"prepared the ground for Nazism"]] and that it was [[Nazism]] that had "finally given expression to the blackness of the German soul".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lawson |first=Tom |title=The Church of England and the Holocaust |publisher=Boydell Press |year=2006 |isbn=1-84383-219-4|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British Institute of Public Opinion (BIPO) tracked the evolution of anti-German/anti-Nazi feeling in Britain, asking the public, via a series of opinion polls conducted from 1939 to 1943, whether "the chief enemy of Britain was the German people or the Nazi government". In 1939 only 6% of respondents held the German people responsible; however, following [[the Blitz]] and the "Anger Campaign" in 1940, this increased to 50%. This subsequently declined to 41% by 1943. It also was reported by Home Intelligence in 1942 that there was some criticism of the official attitude of hatred towards Germany on the grounds that "England ought to be a civilising influence" and that such hatred might hinder the possibility of a reasonable settlement following the war.&lt;ref name=fox&gt;{{cite book |last=Fox |first=Jo |title=Film Propaganda in Britain and Nazi Germany: World War II Cinema |publisher=Berg Publishers |year=2007 |pages=139–140 |isbn=1-85973-896-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This attitude was expanded upon by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]. In 1944, he wrote in a letter to his son [[Christopher Tolkien|Christopher]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[I]t is distressing to see the press grovelling in the gutter as low as [[Joseph Goebbels|Goebbels]] in his prime, shrieking that any German commander who holds out in a desperate situation (when, too, the military needs of his side clearly benefit) is a drunkard, and a besotted fanatic.&amp;nbsp;... There was a solemn article in the local paper seriously advocating systematic exterminating of the entire German nation as the only proper course after military victory: because, if you please, they are [[rattlesnake]]s, and don't know the difference between good and evil! (What of the writer?) The Germans have just as much right to declare the [[Poles]] and Jews exterminable vermin, [[Untermensch|subhuman]], as we have to select the Germans: in other words, no right, whatever they have done.&lt;ref&gt;[[Humphrey Carpenter]], ''The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien'', no. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the same year [[Mass Observation]] asked its observers to analyse the British people's private opinions of the German people and it found that 54% of the British population was "pro-German", in that it expressed sympathy for the German people and stated that the war was "not their fault". This tolerance of the German people as opposed to the Nazi regime increased as the war progressed. In 1943 Mass Observation established the fact that up to 60% of the British people maintained a distinction between Germans and Nazis, with only 20% or so expressing any "hatred, vindictiveness, or need for retribution". The British film propaganda of the period similarly maintained the division between Nazi supporters and the German people.&lt;ref name=fox/&gt;

Private companies sometimes refused to hire any non-citizen, or American citizens of German or Italian ancestry.  This threatened the morale of loyal Americans. President Franklin Roosevelt considered this "stupid" and "unjust". In June 1941 he issued [[Executive Order 8802]] and set up the [[Fair Employment Practice Committee]], which also protected blacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John W.

President Roosevelt sought out Americans of German ancestry for top war jobs, including General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], Admiral [[Chester W. Nimitz]], and General [[Carl Andrew Spaatz]].

Following [[German declaration of war against the United States#Background|its entry into the War against Nazi Germany]] on December 11, 1941, the US Government interned thousands of German and Italian citizens as enemy aliens. In some cases their American-born family members volunteered to accompany them to internment camps in order to keep the family unit together.

In 1944, Secretary of the Treasury [[Henry Morgenthau, Jr.]] put forward the strongest proposal for punishing Germany to the [[Second Quebec Conference]]. It became known as the [[Morgenthau Plan]], and was intended to prevent Germany from having the industrial base to start another world war. However this plan was shelved quickly, the Western Allies did not seek reparations for war damage, and the United States implemented the [[Marshall Plan]] that was intended to and did help [[West Germany|West Germany's]] [[Wirtschaftswunder|post war recovery]] to its former position as a pre-eminent industrial nation.

===Brazil===
After Brazil's entry into the war on the Allied side in 1942, anti-German riots broke out in nearly every city in Brazil in which Germans were not the majority population. German factories, including the Suerdick cigar factory in [[Salvador, Bahia|Bahia]], shops, and hotels were destroyed by mobs. The largest demonstrations took place in [[Porto Alegre]] in [[Rio Grande do Sul]]. Brazilian police persecuted and interned "subjects of the Axis powers" in internment camps similar to those used by the US to intern Japanese-Americans. Following the war, German schools were not reopened, the German-language press disappeared completely, and use of the German language became restricted to the home and the older generation of immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Adam |first=Thomas |authorlink= |author2=Will Kaufman |title=Germany and the Americas |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2005 |isbn=1-85109-628-0|page=184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Forced labor of Germans ===
{{Main|Forced labor of Germans after World War II}}
In many Allied countries, Germans were used as forced laborers after 1945. Some of these laborers, depending on the country, were either prisoners of war or ethnic German civilians.&lt;ref&gt;Eugene Davidson "The death and life of Germany: an account of the American occupation". p.22&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Israel==
Before the rise of [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] and the [[Nazi Party|NSDAP]] (1920s to 1933), many but not all Central and Eastern European Jews tended to be pro-German.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} German Jews were deeply integrated into the country's culture, and many of them had fought with distinction in the First World War German Army. Jews in the [[Czechoslovakia|Czech]] lands tended to adopt the German language and culture in place of [[Slavic languages]] ([[Kafka]] was a conspicuous example), and a similar phenomenon was evident in other parts of the former [[Austro-Hungarian]] Empire but not all. [[Theodore Herzl]], the founding father of [[Zionism]], himself spoke and wrote German and in his utopian book ''[[Altneuland]]'' he actually depicted the future Jewish state as a German-speaking one. However, throughout [[Eastern Europe]], Jews spoke [[Yiddish]], and wrote it in Hebrew script, thus keeping some distance from German culture.{{citation needed|date = October 2018}}

Pro-German attitudes suffered an extremely painful rupture and a complete reversal due to the persecutions and atrocities committed by [[Nazi Germany]], culminating in the systematic genocide of the [[Holocaust]]. In the first decades of Israel's existence, anti-German feelings were strong and dominant in Israeli society. There was a widespread cultural and commercial boycott of all things German (and often, Austrian as well) and a determination "never to set foot on German soil".{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} German Jews in Israel, themselves refugees from the Nazi persecutions, came under strong social pressure to cease using German, their mother language.{{citation needed|date = October 2018}}

During the 1940s, the words "German" and "Nazi" were used interchangeably.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} (Until the late 1990s, the [[sign language]] of Israeli [[deaf community|deaf communities]] used the [[Swastika]] as the sign for "German".{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}) There was a widespread scepticism about the possibility of "another Germany" ever emerging; specifically, there was suspicion about [[Konrad Adenauer]]'s claim to be involved in the creation of a new, democratic Germany. Many Israelis took up the Soviet claims made in the early years of the Cold War that [[West Germany]] was a "fascist state" in which ex-Nazis held key positions.{{citation needed|date = October 2018}}

The [[Reparations Agreement between Israel and West Germany|Reparations Agreement]] with West Germany, signed by the [[David Ben-Gurion]] government in 1952, was the focus of intense political controversy, and the protest demonstrations led by then opposition leader [[Menachem Begin]] turned into pitched battles with the police. In the early 1960s, the [[Eichmann Trial]] brought the horrors and traumas of the Holocaust to the center of public consciousness. The establishment of diplomatic relations between Israel and West Germany in 1966 entailed a new wave of protests and demonstrations, though less violent than those of 1952.{{citation needed|date = October 2018}}

Since the late 1960s, there has been a clear, though gradual, process of rapprochement between Israelis and Germans in all spheres: diplomatic, commercial and cultural. The 1967 [[Six-Day War]] realigned Israeli politics, with the issue of occupied territories henceforth defining what is "right wing" and "left wing"; one result was that militant Israeli nationalism tended to be anti-Arab rather than anti-German.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} When Begin became Israel's Prime Minister in 1977, he had little option but to take up the maintenance of already very extensive ties with Germany, to whose creation he had been fiercely opposed as an opposition leader.{{citation needed|date = October 2018}}

A momentary flare-up of anti-German feeling occurred during the 1991 Gulf War, when Israel was the subject of missile attack by [[Saddam Hussein]]'s Iraq. Some Israeli columnists and politicians combined the revelations of German corporations helping the Iraqi arms industry and the strong anti-war movement in Germany and tied both with the German Nazi past. {{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

The German government of the time managed, however, to assuage Israeli feelings by providing the Israeli Navy with three advanced [[submarine]]s, which, according to repeated reports in the international press, were used to mount nuclear missiles and provide Israel with a [[second strike]] capacity.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} These [[Dolphin-class submarine|Dolphin class submarines]] replaced the obsolete 1970s [[Gal-class submarine]]s, and are some of the most modern submarines in the world. Two submarines were given outright by Germany, and Israel paid for half of the third. {{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

In the 21st century, the long debate about whether the [[Israel Philharmonic Orchestra]] should play the works of [[Richard Wagner]] is mostly considered as a remnant of the past. In March 2008, German Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] became the first foreign head of government invited to deliver a speech in the Israeli parliament, which she gave in the German language. Several members of parliament did leave in protest during the speech, claiming the need to create a collective memory that "will create a kind of electric wave when Jews will hear the sounds of the German language, they'll remember the Holocaust".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |title=German Chancellor's speech to Israel upsets MPs |work=[[The World Today (Australian radio program)|The World Today]] |pages= |publisher= |date=March 19, 2008 |url=http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/content/2008/s2194102.htm |accessdate=2008-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kibbutz [[Lohamei HaGeta'ot]] (English: "Fighters of the Ghettos")–which included among its founders survivors of the [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]]–reversed a long-standing ban and permitted a delegation from its [[Ghetto Fighters' House]] museum to accept an invitation and visit Germany. The explanation was given, "When German babies born on the day of Hitler's death are now sixty-three years old, it is ridiculous to continue to demand a collective responsibility." {{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

In one October 2008 interview, researcher Hanan Bar (חנן בר) summed up the ambiguous Israeli attitude to Germany: "If the average Israeli happens to see a football match between Germany and Holland [sic], he would automatically root for the Dutch. But the same person, when buying a washing machine, would prefer a German model, considering it to be the best".&lt;ref&gt;Interview in "Shamenet" (שמנת), monthly supplement of ''[[Haaretz]]'', October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the separation into two countries following the Second World War; [[West Germany]] generally had good relationships with its western neighboring states, while [[East Germany]] to some degree had similar relationships with its eastern neighbors. Many of these relationships continued after the end of the [[Cold War]] with the unified Germany. West Germany was a co-founder of the [[European Union]] and the reunified Germany continues as a leading member. During the process of European unification, Germany and France forged a strong relationship, ending the long-standing [[French–German enmity]], which had peaked during and after the First World War.

Much present-day anti-German sentiment has been particularly strong in East European countries occupied by Germany during the war, and those that were at war with Germany and its allies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Haerpfer |first=Christian W. |title=Democracy and Enlargement in Post-Communist Europe |publisher=Routledge |year=2002 |pages=94–95 |isbn=0-415-27422-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Mark |last = Landler | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/30/world/europe/30iht-poland.2644508.html?_r=1 | title = Poles riled by Berlin exhibition |newspaper=International Herald Tribune | date = 30 August 2006 | accessdate = 30 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although views fluctuate somewhat in response to geopolitical issues (such as the invasion of Iraq), Americans regard modern Germany as an ally&lt;ref&gt;[http://pewglobal.org/reports/display.php?PageID=825 Pew Global Attitudes Project: I. America's Image and U.S. Foreign Policy: America's Image Slips, But Allies Share U.S. Concerns Over Iran, Hamas] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061008020316/http://pewglobal.org/reports/display.php?PageID=825 |date=October 8, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and few hold anti-German sentiments. Occasionally, German people are stereotyped as Nazis (goose-stepping, shouting "[[Sieg Heil]]!", sporting a "Hitler moustache"), being "[[Economy of Germany|ruthlessly efficient]]" and having no [[german humour|sense of humour]] in some parts of American media, as well as in the UK and other countries. [[Richard Wagner]]'s music was not performed in [[Israel]] until 1995 (radio) and 2001 (concert) and was for many years unpopular in Poland. This can be explained, at least partially, due to Richard Wagner's [[anti-semitism]] and the Nazi appropriation of Wagner's music based on Hitler's personal affection for his operas.

In a poll carried out in 2008 for the [[BBC World Service]], in which people in 34 countries were asked about the positive and negative influence of 13 countries,{{efn|name=influential}} Germany was the most popular, ahead of [[Japan]], [[France]] and [[United Kingdom|Britain]]; across all countries surveyed, only 18 percent across all countries surveyed thought Germany had a mainly negative influence.&lt;ref name="BBCpoll"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.worldpublicopinion.org/pipa/pdf/apr08/BBCEvals_Apr08_rpt.pdf| title = BBC World Service Poll: Global Views of USA Improve| accessdate = 2009-09-19| date = April 2008| format = PDF| pages = | quote = Germany's global image is the most positive of all countries evaluated in this survey.

The most widespread positive views of Germany could be found among its European neighbours, including very large majorities in Italy (82%), Spain (77%), Portugal (76%), and France (74%).

The [[BBC World Service]] "Country Rating Poll" for 2014 surveyed opinion in 24 participating countries concerning the influence of 16 countries{{efn|name=influential}} and the European Union; 12 of the influential countries participated.&lt;ref&gt;BBC 2014, pp. 1–4.&lt;/ref&gt; Results were released at the end of May. The table shows the "Views of Germany's Influence" overall (line 1) and by country. "Germany has kept its position of the most favourably viewed nation in 2014."&lt;ref&gt;BBC 2014, pp. 1, 13.&lt;/ref&gt; That is, Germany is the one whose influence is most commonly (60%) viewed positively; among the 17 Germany stands second to Canada as the ones least commonly (18%) viewed negatively.&lt;ref&gt;BBC 2014, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first ten polls, annual from 2005, Germany had been the country with world influence most commonly viewed positively at least in 2008&lt;ref name=BBCpoll/&gt; as well as 2013 and 2014.

===United Kingdom===

Germans sometimes complain of stereotypical associations of them with acts and a regime of more than seventy years ago, such as the use of anti-German sentiment in headlines by parts of the British press{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}, which were often used in the build-up to football matches between England and Germany. A more recent example arose when German [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] Joseph Ratzinger became [[Pope]] [[Pope Benedict XVI|Benedict XVI]].

In fact, according to a recent poll, the British people have a rather positive image of Germany, with 62 percent believing that Germany has a mainly positive influence in the world and only 20 percent believing that Germany's influence is mainly negative, slightly better than Germans' views of Britain (60 percent and 27 percent, respectively).&lt;ref name="BBCpoll"/&gt;

===Poland===

Many Poles perceive Germans as their long-time oppressors, dating back to the times of [[Teutonic Order]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} This notion is based on a long history of conflict with ethnic Poles, first by the German-language and culture Prussians then by the united German state, starting with [[Partitions of Poland|three partitions of Poland]], [[germanization]] in the 19th and 20th centuries, and culminating in the Nazi Germany's [[invasion of Poland]] in 1939 and the genocide of six million Polish citizens, that ensued during [[World War II crimes in Poland|the German occupation 1939–1945]].

Several issues have also strained recent Polish-German relations, although Poland and post-reunification Germany overall have had mostly [[German–Polish relations|positive relations]]. The Poles are suspicious of the campaign led by [[Erika Steinbach]], a daughter of a German officer in the German forces occupying Poland, made famous for her voting against [[Oder–Neisse line]] borders,&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Dietrich, [http://www.faz.net/s/RubDDBDABB9457A437BAA85A49C26FB23A0/Doc~E5E3B8180C8664B3F94F7C0CC40927EEA~ATpl~Ecommon~Scontent.html ''Frau Steinbachs Vergehen'']&lt;/ref&gt; who seeks reparations for the property lost by Germans expelled by Poland following the Second World War and to create the [[Centre Against Expulsions]].
In addition, the proposed Russo-German pipeline through the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] [[Sea]] is seen by Poles as aimed at cutting off Poland's natural gas supplies from [[Russia]] without damaging supply to Germany, and was even compared to the ignominious [[Molotov-Ribbentrop pact]] by [[Radosław Sikorski]], Polish foreign minister.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Taylor,

===Netherlands===
{{See also|Germany–Netherlands football rivalry|Germany–Netherlands relations}}
Anti-German sentiment was already prevalent in the [[Netherlands]] centuries before the [[unification of Germany]] and establishment of the [[Second German Empire]], completed 1871. The Dutch are thought to have developed a low opinion of Germans during the 17th century, also known in the Netherlands as the [[Dutch Golden Age|''Gouden Eeuw'']] (literally: "Golden Century"), when the [[Dutch Republic]] was one of the world's most advanced and powerful countries while modern Germany was still a patchwork of warring [[fiefdom|fiefs]].&lt;ref name=itsok&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/08/world/for-dutch-it-s-ok-to-despise-germans.html "For Dutch it's OK to despise Germans"], ''New York Times'', 8 February 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first half of the 17th century, the Republic saw a major spike in German immigrants including common laborers, [[religious persecution|persecuted]] [[Lutheran]]s and [[Jew]]s, and all sorts of [[war refugee]]s fleeing the violence of the [[Thirty Years' War]]. A [[cultural conflict|culture clash]] soon followed, and German immigrants were often discriminated against by the native Dutch.&lt;ref name=itsok/&gt; It was likely around this time that the earliest variations of the word [[List of terms used for Germans#Netherlands|mof]] were first used to refer to lower class German migrants. There are known [[Joke|joke books]] in which these Germans are featured prominently and stereotypically as dumb, arrogant and filthy.&lt;ref&gt;Lachen in de Gouden Eeuw, by R. Dekker ({{ISBN|9028417850}})&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[First World War|WWI]] (in which the Netherlands was neutral), the so-called [[Wire of Death]], a lethal 2000 [[volts]] electric fence built along the southern Dutch border by the [[Belgium in World War I|Germans occupying Belgium]] caused a large number of fatalities among the Dutch people, renewing anti-German sentiment in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethesis.net/smokkel_land_van_waas/smokkel_lvw_hfst_6.htm |title=S. van Waesberghe, smuggling and the wire |publisher=Ethesis.net |date= |accessdate=2014-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; This sentiment was reborn as hatred when, in 1940, [[Nazi Germany]] launched its [[Battle of the Netherlands|invasion of the Netherlands]] despite earlier promises from Germany to respect [[Netherlands in World War II#Neutrality|Dutch neutrality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nicholas Best|title=Five Days That Shocked the World: Eyewitness Accounts from Europe at the End of World War II|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OlLqTIomUZ8C&amp;pg=PA162|year=2012|publisher=Macmillan|page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Willem Frijhoff|author2=Marijke Spies|title=Dutch Culture in a European Perspective: 1950, prosperity and welfare|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JZfvCVndvXoC&amp;pg=PA34|year=2004|publisher=Uitgeverij Van Gorcum|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 100,000 [[Dutch Jews]] were [[History of the Jews in the Netherlands#The Holocaust|deported to their deaths]] during the subsequent [[Nazi occupation of the Netherlands|Nazi occupation]], and starvation afflicted much of the country during the [[Hongerwinter|"Hunger Winter"]] of 1944–45. Most elderly Dutch people remember these events including the [[Rotterdam Blitz]] bitterly, and some still refuse to set foot on German soil.&lt;ref name=itsok/&gt;

A sociological study from 1998 showed that still two generations after it had ended, World War II remained influential, and "present-day parents and young people are negatively biased against Germany."&lt;ref&gt;Manuela du Bois-Reymond,  "European identity in the young and Dutch students' images of Germany and the Germans." ''Comparative Education'' (1998) 34#1 pp: 27–40, quote p 33 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3099584 in JSTOR].&lt;/ref&gt; Aspeslagh and Dekker reported in 1998 that "more than half of the cohort born after 1950 answered 'sometimes' or
'often' when asked whether they harbored anti-German feelings".&lt;ref&gt;Robert Aspeslagh and Henk Dekker. "An equivocal relationship: Germany and the Netherlands". ''Break out, Break down or break in: Germany and the European Union after Amsterdam'' (1998) pp: 11–20. [http://webdoc.sub.gwdg.de/ebook/lf/2003/aicgs/publications/PDF/breakout.pdf#page=20 online]&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewing three large-scale academic studies from the 1990s, they concluded:
:The emotional feelings regarding Germany and Germans revealed by these studies are defined by the Second World War. The annual commemorations of World War II, the way history lessons deal with Germany and the continual, casually negative remarks by adults reproduce the negative emotions about Germany and Germans, particularly among the young.&lt;ref&gt;Aspeslagh and Dekker, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Newer studies also consistently show that Dutch anti-German sentiment has been falling steadily for years,&lt;ref&gt;(''Dutch''){{cite web|url=http://www.nu.nl/algemeen/1065441/nederlanders-positiever-over-duitsers.html |title=(''Dutch'') Nederlanders positiever over Duitsers |publisher=Nu.nl |date=2010-03-16 |accessdate=2014-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that most Dutch people today show a positive view towards both Germany and the German people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.duitslandweb.nl/naslagwerk/naslagwerk/Nederlands-Duitse_betrekkingen/Duitslandbeelden.html#Clingendael-onderzoek.xml |title=Nederlands-Duitse_betrekkingen German-Dutch relations.

===European debt crisis, Greece and Italy===
{{see also|Fourth Reich#German influence in the European Union}}
During the [[European debt crisis]], many countries embarked on, or were arguably pushed into, austerity programs. Germany was blamed for the resulting economical, social and political consequences &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.reuters.com/macroscope/2011/11/07/euro-zone-crisis-its-germanys-fault/|title=Euro zone crisis: It’s Germany’s fault|website=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/who-is-responsible-for-the-eurozone-crisis-the-simple-answer-germany-a6771536.html|title=Why Germany could be behind the eurozone crisis|date=13 December 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-09-12/is-germany-responsible-for-the-euro-crisis|title=Is Germany Responsible for the Euro Crisis?|date=12 September 2013|publisher=|via=www.bloomberg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ongoing [[Greek government-debt crisis]] and EU-driven austerity measures imposed on the country have revived anti-German sentiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ferris |first=Amie |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/10/26/us-greece-germany-relations-idUSTRE79P3LN20111026 |title=Nazi jokes, wrath at Germans highlight Greek despair |publisher=Reuters.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek media have been making comments critical of the German policy, often mentioning, and drawing parallels with the [[Axis occupation of Greece]], with some commentators emphasizing a genetic heritage from "[[Goths]]" or "[[Huns#20th century use in reference to Germans|Huns]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ppol.gr/cm/index.php?Datain=7608&amp;LID=1|script-title=el:Ο αντιγερμανισμός και οι μύθοι που τον τροφοδοτούν|author=Spyros Vletsas|language=Greek|accessdate=7 April 2013|title=Archived copy|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130616030849/http://www.ppol.gr/cm/index.php?Datain=7608&amp;LID=1|archive-date=16 June 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Ioannis Grigoriadis|url=http://news.kathimerini.gr/4dcgi/_w_articles_columns_2_25/07/2012_490122|title=Αντιαμερικανισμός και αντιγερμανισμός|publisher=[[Kathimerini]]|accessdate=7 April 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121116220505/http://news.kathimerini.gr/4dcgi/_w_articles_columns_2_25/07/2012_490122|archive-date=16 November 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A poll by VPRC noted the existence of an anti-German sentiment in Greece, and that the majority of the respondents nowadays connect Germany with negative notions such as "Hitler", "Nazism" and "3rd Reich".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tvxs.gr/news/ellada/problima-stis-sxeseis-elladas-germanias-anadeiknyei-dimoskopisi-sok-tis-vprc |title=Πρόβλημα στις σχέσεις Ελλάδας Γερμανίας αναδεικνύει δημοσκόπηση-σοκ της Vprc |language=Greek |date=23 February 2012 |publisher=VPRC |work=tvxs.gr| accessdate=7 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Popular Fighters Group]] formed in response to the debt crisis is overtly anti-German and has targeted German organizations in Greece.

Another key issue, has been the claim for still owed [[World_War_II_reparations#Greece|War reparations, with estimates reaching 279b Euros]].

In August 2012, Italian Prime Minister [[Mario Monti]] warned that escalating arguments over how to resolve the Euro debt crisis are turning countries against each other and threatening to rip Europe apart.  Resentment in Italy is growing against Germany, the European Union and chancellor Merkel, he said, adding that "the pressures already bear the traits of a psychological break-up of Europe".&lt;ref name= Aldrick2012&gt;{{cite news |last= Aldrick |first= Philip |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financialcrisis/9454255/Debt-crisis-threatens-to-break-up-Europe.html |title=Debt crisis threatens to break up Europe |newspaper= [[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |date= 2012-08-05 |accessdate=2014-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A survey took place in the summer of 2017 among ten members of the EU. Most expressed scepticism about German influence on European matters; the Greeks (89%) express most of the skepticism followed by the Italians (69%) and the Spanish (68%). Greeks also come with the most negative opinion (84%) about Angela Merkel, and with the least positive opinion about the German people (24%), among the questioned ten states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Nikolaidou|first=Myrna|url=https://www.frontpages.gr/d/20170617/26/%CE%95%CF%83%CF%84%CE%AF%CE%B1|title=Greece, the champion of anti-germanism: Europeans are concerned over Berlin's influence|newspaper=[[Estia]]|date=2017-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pais de Convivència.jpg|thumb|Public placard reading: "Anna Maria was born in Barcelona. Maura was born in Argentina. We are Catalonia. Country of Convivència."]]

'''Convivència''' is the public policy on social coexistence in [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]; government projects, departments and ordinances promote the principle broadly. Originally, convivència was presented as a policy to integrate immigrant populations and build social cohesion following the divisive [[Spanish Civil War]] and dictatorship. Today, convivència can encompass conflict mediation, policing, civic participation, language policy, public education, civility, public celebrations and the promotion of neighborhood-based initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www20.gencat.cat/portal/site/ensenyament/menuitem.a735c8413184c341c65d3082b0c0e1a0/?vgnextoid=424b335108fb7110VgnVCM1000008d0c1e0aRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=424b335108fb7110VgnVCM1000008d0c1e0aRCRD&amp;vgnextfmt=default Projecte de convivència.

Pla per a la convivència de Vilanova i la Geltrú,&lt;/ref&gt; As the dominant paradigm of social coexistence, convivència is the frequent subject of political, scholarly, media and popular discourse. Unlike the cognate Castilian term, [[convivencia]], which refers to an imagined Medieval Iberian past, the Catalan word and policy emerged in the late 1970s and refers to contemporary social life and recent history.&lt;ref&gt;Utopian virtues: Muslim neighbors, ritual sociality, and the politics of convivència.

== Origin and development of ''Convivència'' ==
[[File:City Hall directory.JPG|thumb|Many Catalan municipal governments include social service divisions dedicated to fostering convivència.]]
[[File:Barbershop Amistat.JPG|thumb|This Muslim barber has named his shop with the Catalan word for "Friendship." This may express the Islamic value of neighborliness, often linked to convivència by Muslims in Catalonia.]]

''Convivència'' (literally "to live together")&lt;ref&gt;Alberti, Santiago. Diccionari de la Llengua Catalana. Barcelona: Alberti, Editor S.L.&lt;/ref&gt; is a Catalan term, distinct from the Castilian term, ''convivencia'', the latter primarily referring to the historical and disputed coexistence of Jews, Muslims and Christians in Medieval Iberia.&lt;ref&gt;Glick, Thomas F. 1992. Convivencia: An introductory note. In Convivencia: Jews, Muslims and Christians in Medieval Spain, edited by V. Mann, T. Glick and J. Dodds. New York: George Braziller, Inc. 1-10.&lt;/ref&gt; It was first popularized in reference to contemporary phenomena by former Catalan President [[Jordi Pujol]], in the early years of the return to democracy following the dictatorship of [[Francisco Franco]] (1939–75). As Pujol employed the term, convivència signified tolerance and linguistic accommodation between native born Catalans and the Castilian-speaking "new Catalans" or "other Catalans" who had migrated from Southern Spain in such numbers as to constitute roughly half of the population of Catalonia.&lt;ref&gt;Pujol, Jordi. 1976.

Barcelona: Edicions 62.&lt;/ref&gt; In subsequent decades, the term became the dominant frame of shared social existence in Catalonia and no longer carried a passive sense of mere tolerance but rather the active engagement of relations between neighbors&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; and of the full expression of cultural pluralism in which there is public space for all traditions&lt;ref&gt;Rovira Pascual, Conrad. 2007.

Diari de Vilanova, March 16, p.15.&lt;/ref&gt; Convivència overlaps semantically with the concept of ''civility'' (''civisme'') to the extent that both may refer to mutual respect in the shared use of public space yet there is an important distinction. ''Civisme'' is often understood as a top-down, legislative imposition of universal norms over the population whereas ''convivència'' (while also sometimes being legislated) is perceived as a bottom-up, neighbor-to-neighbor process whereby residents work out solutions to conflicts among themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Suñé, Ramon. 2006a.

L'Aleta (75):20-21.&lt;/ref&gt; This sense of conflict as productive is an important feature of ''convivència''. A municipal plan defines it this way:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"We can define convivència in the broadest sense of the concept, to live in the company of others with whom we interact with empathy, sharing, communication, and the regulation of conflict. One should bear in mind that when people live together, conflicts arise: this need not be seen as a problem but rather as an impetus to change. From this definition we understand convivència (active relations between neighbors), in contradistinction to coexistence (minimal, passively produced relations between neighbors), and to hostility."&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Convivència vs multiculturalism: implications for citizenship ==
In other parts of Europe, or in the US, the mixed societies that result from immigration are often discussed in terms of [[multiculturalism]]. The term multiculturalism is predicated on the existence of distinct, sometimes static cultural identities and often provoke debate regarding the conception of human rights as universal or particular to a cultural group.&lt;ref&gt;Kymlicka, Will. 1995. The Rights of Minority Cultures. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The rights of these cultural others often hinge on the question of their ''[[citizenship]].'' While equivalents for all of these concepts exist in Catalonia, they are not the dominant nor even the legally significant ideas. Catalan law does not acknowledge ''citizens'' but rather ''neighbors'' (''veïns'') through the principle of ''veïnatge administratiu'' (neighborhood jurisdiction) established by municipal registration (''l'empadronament'') regardless of citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;[[:ca:Veïnatge administratiu|Padró municipal d'habitants - Viquipèdia, l'enciclopèdia lliure]]&lt;/ref&gt; Citizenship is an abstract concept; one may be a citizen of one place yet reside in another but a person can only be a neighbor in one determinant place at a time. Both concepts ''convivència'' and ''neighbor'' emphasize concrete local specificity over disembodied abstraction. And while convivència encompasses the relations between natives and newcomers, it also concerns the relations between people of shared origins, therefore de-emphasizing cultural differences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://civil.udg.es/normacivil/cat/CCC/Index.htm Codi Civil de Catalunya&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Following these principles, in most Catalan communities, the preferred term for immigrant is "nouvingut" (newcomer) suggesting the language of hospitality rather than that of social or legal policy. It should be understood that these differences do not guarantee better or different social outcomes for immigrants but rather that these concepts form part of the way Catalans understand their own society in distinct ways.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

== Convivència and Islam ==
Half of [[Islam in Spain|Spain's Muslim population]] resides in Catalonia providing challenges and opportunities for the application of convivència.&lt;ref&gt;l'Institut d'Estadística de Catalunya. 2006. Residents estrangers 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Manyer i Farré, Josep. 1992. Quan l'Islam truca a la porta: per a una aproximació cultural als musulmans de Catalunya. 1 ed. Barcelona: Fundació Serveis de Cultura Popular: Editorial Alta Fulla.&lt;/ref&gt; Catalonia's Muslim leaders, from the imams of local mosques, to Catalonia's first Muslim member of parliament who has published a trilingual book on the subject,&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; have framed convivència as consonant with Qu'ranic teachings, or as part of Islamic tradition itself. While tensions between Muslims and non-Muslim communities exist in Catalonia as elsewhere, convivència supplies a common frame of shared values as a starting point for dialogue.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;  This is in stark contrast to other parts of Europe where such conflicts may be framed as the "clash of civilizations," or the alleged fundamental incompatibility between Islam and secular modernity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenation.com/article/clash-ignorance# The Clash of Ignorance | The Nation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Dark Eden''''' is a [[social science fiction]] [[novel]] by [[British people|British]] author [[Chris Beckett]], first published in the [[United Kingdom]] in 2012. The novel explores the disintegration of a small group of a highly [[Inbreeding|inbred]] people, descendants of two individuals whose spaceship crashed on a [[rogue planet]] they call Eden.

The book won the [[Arthur C. Clarke Award]] for best science fiction novel published in the United Kingdom in 2012.

==Plot summary==
The novel begins about 160 years after two human beings, Angela and Tommy, were stranded on Eden. Their three companions—Mehmet, Michael, and Dixon—left in a damaged spaceship to get help. Years passed, and although Angela and Tommy held out hope for rescue, they began to raise children and form a new society which they named "Family". Frequent and regular [[incest]] among their descendants became common, with few children knowing who their father was. Social life centers around powerful rituals: Retelling of story of the stranding, the worship of what few relics remain, myths about Earth, and the need to stay close to Circle—the place where the landing vehicle is supposed to return to, and bring them back to Earth. Social norms are strongly adhered to in this [[matriarchy]], and innovation is rare.

Family's world, Eden, is so far from its sun that it is icebound. Only a small area, which the Family calls Circle Valley, is temperate. Eden's animals each have two hearts, green-black blood, huge and lidless eyes, six legs, and tentacled feelers around their mouths. The animal population, however, is not diverse. Trees tap into the heat just below Eden's surface, bringing up warmth and providing fruit and other food. Nearly all plant and animal life on Eden is [[Bioluminescence|bioluminescent]], allowing the humans to see, while overhead the [[Milky Way]] can be easily seen at all times.

The novel centers around John Redlantern, a "newhair" (teenager) who hates the deep social and technological conservatism of Family. Killing a deadly leopard proves to be an [[Epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]] which opens his eyes to the [[Malthusian catastrophe]] facing Family, which has grown too large for its tiny valley. Supported by pretty Tina Spikestree and John's cousins (the somewhat passive teenaged Gerry and the [[club foot]]ed pre-adolescent, thoughtful Jeff), John engages in a series of [[Iconoclasm|iconoclastic]] acts which lead to the "breaking" of Family. Exile of John and his teenaged followers is only the first of many ramifications, as John leads a [[Messianism|messianic]] quest for a land "over Cold Dark" where Family can grow and thrive.

==Themes==
The novel is told in the [[Narration#First-person|first-person]] voice by various characters, and each short chapter is told from a different character's perspective.&lt;ref name=kirkus&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/chris-beckett/dark-eden-beckett/|title=Kirkus Review: ''Dark Eden'' by Chris Beckett|website=Kirkus Reviews|date=1 February 2014|accessdate=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Drift (linguistics)|Linguistic drift]] has given the people of Eden unique nouns ("police veekle", "rayed yoh", and "Jesus Juice" instead of "police vehicle", "radio", and "Jesus and the Jews").&lt;ref name=kirkus /&gt; The [[adverb]] "very" has dropped from the language, and emphasis is created by [[reduplication]] ("bad bad" instead of "very bad").&lt;ref name=yahoointer&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/brooklyn-baby-talk-dialect-dark-eden-exclusive-author-200811773.html|last=Beckett|first=Chris|title=Brooklyn, Baby Talk, and the Dialect of 'Dark Eden': Exclusive From Author Chris Beckett|website=Yahoo News|date=10 April 2014|accessdate=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Linguistic relativity]] has yet to set in, so that Family lacks words to describe much of their world ("Cold Dark" instead of "high, dark mountain wreathed in glaciers").&lt;ref name=interview&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/features/chris-beckett/|last=Goldschlager|first=Amy|title=Interview: Chris Beckett, Author of ''Dark Eden''|website=Kirkus Reviews|date=2 April 2014|accessdate=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beckett said he adopted the unsophisticated, childish language of the Edenites after realizing he had crafted a society in which "the Eden settlers were a bunch of kids and two adults... .  There's no external adult world as a reference point".&lt;ref name=interview /&gt; With the two adults constantly speaking baby-talk to their children, pre-teens and teens never adopted more adult ways of speaking.&lt;ref name=yahoointer /&gt;

Beckett intended the novel to be "the [[Book of Genesis|Bible story]]...turned on its head",&lt;ref name=interview /&gt; one in which people are "expelled to [[Garden of Eden|Eden]]".&lt;ref name=interview /&gt; He conceived the novel after realizing that much of the [[Old Testament]] consisted of "small domestic stories elevated to a mythical level", and he established the social norms, rituals, and myths of Family around similar stories.&lt;ref name=interview /&gt;

Beckett also wanted to explore themes about making hard choices. To [[Thinking outside the box|think outside the box]] sometimes requires not only "transgressive" but extremely "cruel" behavior, he told ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]''.&lt;ref name=interview /&gt; The ramifications of John Redlantern's transgression, he noted, also has a wide number of unintended ramifications. The novel explores a socially and theologically conservative society's reaction to this transgression, which at first leads to a [[reactionary]] response. Only later does it lead to social upheaval in ways some characters predict (most notably Tina Spiketree's fears of [[patriarchy]]) but in ways no one can anticipate. Beckett said much of the latter part of the novel is about how positive, creative new ways of thinking can still harm people badly, and force people to make sacrifices they do not wish to make.&lt;ref name=interview /&gt;

==Critical reception and awards==
''Dark Eden'' was author Chris Beckett's second novel.&lt;ref name=clarkeaward /&gt;  Reviews were generally very positive in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="kirkus"/&gt; Stuart Kelly in ''[[The Guardian]]'' called it a "superior piece of theologically nuanced science fiction", although he noted that the novel drew a little heavily on [[Russell Hoban]]'s ''[[Riddley Walker]]'' and [[Will Self]]'s ''[[The Book of Dave]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jan/13/science-fiction-fiction|last=Kelly|first=Stuart|title=Dark Eden by Chris Beckett - review|work=The Guardian|date=13 January 2012|accessdate=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author [[Paul Di Filippo]], reviewing the book for ''Locus'' magazine, described the plot as uninventive but "so splendidly [written] it feels brand new and remade".&lt;ref name=fillipp&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.locusmag.com/Reviews/2013/07/paul-di-filippo-reviews-chris-beckett/|last=Di Filippo|first=Paul|title=Paul Di Filippo Reviews Chris Beckett|work=Locus|date=19 July 2013|accessdate=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He pointed out that the novel's "harsh oasis" plot device resembled the work of [[Fritz Leiber]], [[Stephen Baxter (author)|Stephen Baxter]], [[Larry Niven]], and [[Karl Schroeder]]. But that didn't matter: "[A]ll this heavy categorizing misses the essence of the reader’s first contact with the book, which is pure astonishment and pleasure, a storytelling ride full of brio and wonder. ... The reader is swiftly seduced by two things that are intrinsic to, but separate from, the powerful plot: the Carrollian language, and the freaky ecology."&lt;ref name=fillipp /&gt; He had high praise for the character of John Redlantern, who was a [[metaphor]] (in De Filippo's mind) for both [[Moses]] and [[Cain]].&lt;ref name=fillipp /&gt; Harry Ritchie in the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' said "Human plight and alien planet are both superbly evoked in [this] captivating and haunting book"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/books/article-2092242/SCIENCE-FICTION.html#ixzz3XUWNyECV|last=Ritchie|first=Harry|title=Science Fiction|work=Daily Mail|date=26 January 2012|accessdate=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; while David Langford in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' said ''Dark Eden'' contained "A classic theme, beautifully told".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/bookreviews/9012739/Sci-Fi-roundup-January-15.html|last=Langford|first=David|title=Sci-Fi roundup: January 15|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=19 January 2012|accessdate=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Dark Eden'' was published in the United States in April 2014 by [[Broadway Books]]. American reviewers were much more critical of the book. In ''Kirkus Reviews'', an anonymous reviewer called it "[a]bsorbing if often familiar, inventive and linguistically adept but less than fully satisfying... Enjoyable but no blockbuster."&lt;ref name=kirkus /&gt; Author [[N. K. Jemisin]], reviewing the novel in ''[[The New York Times]]'', praised Beckett's method of rendering "the terror of the darkness beyond the forests with a riveting deftness" and the way he "cleverly" introduced new challenges and threats to keep the reader interested.&lt;ref name=jemisin&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/01/books/review/jeff-vandermeers-authority-and-more.html|last=Jemisin|first=N.K.|title=Science Fiction: Jeff VanderMeer's 'Authority,' and More|work=The New York Times|date=30 May 2014|accessdate=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; But she strongly criticized the plot for being predictable and hackneyed and the characters for being clichéd. She had harsh words for what she saw as "the 1950s ethos underpinning the whole thing. The Family has developed into a relatively peaceful communal society that venerates its elders and has necessarily relaxed sexual norms; the society John seeks to create instead is monogamous, individualistic, rife with subtle bigotries and rooted in murder. Survival and progress, the story seems to suggest, require these things."&lt;ref name=jemisin /&gt; ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' thought the novel "hew[ed] too closely to historical patterns", and declared the climax very unsatisfying. The reviewer still found the changing narrative viewpoints, ecological setting, and linguistic devices interesting, however.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-8041-3868-0|title=Dark Eden; Chris Beckett, Author|website=Publishers Weekly|date=3 February 2014|accessdate=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Awards===
''Dark Eden'' won the 2013 Arthur C. Clarke Award for the best science fiction novel published in the United Kingdom in 2012.&lt;ref name=clarkeaward&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/may/01/chris-beckett-wins-arthur-c-clarke-award|last=Flood|first=Alison|title=Chris Beckett wins Arthur C Clarke award for Dark Eden|work=The Guardian|date=1 May 2013|accessdate=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clarke Award judge Andrew M. Butler, noting why the judges gave the award to a new author rather than an established writer, said of the book, "''Dark Eden'' fuses rich biological and sociological speculation. Beckett really makes you care for characters who are stranded light years from an Earth they have never really known."&lt;ref name=clarkeaward /&gt;

This article is about the [[demographics|demographic]] features of the population of [[Costa Rica]], including [[population density]], [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population.

According to the [[United Nations]], in {{UN_Population|Year}} Costa Rica had an estimated population of {{UN_Population|Costa Rica}} people. White and Mestizos make up 83.4% of the population, 7% are [[black people]] (including mulattoes), 2.4% [[Amerindians]], 0.2% [[Asians]], and 7% other/none.&lt;ref name="crhoy.com"&gt;[http://www.crhoy.com/archivo/costa-rica-es-multirracial-ultimo-censo-lo-pone-en-evidencia/nacionales/ Costa Rica es multirracial, último censo lo pone en evidencia]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, just under 3% of the population is of black African descent who are called [[Afro-Costa Rican]]s or [[West Indian]]s and are English-speaking descendants of 19th-century black [[Jamaica]]n immigrant workers. Another 1% is composed of ethnic Chinese, and less than 1% are Middle Easterners, mainly of [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] descent but also Palestinians. The 2011 Census provided the following data: whites and mestizos make up a 83.4% of the population, 7% are [[black people]] (including mulattoes), 2.4% [[Amerindians]], 0.2% [[Asians]], and 7% other/none.&lt;ref name="crhoy.com"/&gt;

There is also a community of North American retirees from the United States and Canada, followed by fairly large numbers of [[European Union]] expatriates (esp. Scandinavians and from Germany) come to retire as well, and Australians.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} [[Immigration to Costa Rica]] made up 9% of the population in 2012. This included permanent settlers as well as migrants who were hoping to reach the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inec.go.cr/Web/Home/pagPrincipal.aspx|title=Principal|date=27 March 2012|website=Inec.go.cr|accessdate=30 August 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327062704/http://www.inec.go.cr/Web/Home/pagPrincipal.aspx|archivedate=27 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, there were some 420,000 immigrants in Costa Rica&lt;ref name="pewglobal.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewglobal.org/interactives/migration-tables/|title=International Migrants by Country|date=10 November 2016|website=Pewglobal.org|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the number of asylum seekers (mostly from Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua) rose to more than 110,000.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/26/central-american-refugees-costa-rica-obama-administration|title=US partners with Costa Rica to protect Central American refugees|first=Amanda|last=Holpuch|date=26 July 2016|website=Theguardian.com|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated 10% of the Costa Rican population in 2014 was made up of [[Nicaragua]]ns.&lt;ref name="CherryDillon2014"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cherry|first1=Andrew|author2=Mary Dillon|title=International Handbook of Adolescent Pregnancy: Medical, Psychosocial, and Public Health Responses|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6Ym4BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA258|accessdate=5 November 2016|year=2014|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-4899-8026-7|page=258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The indigenous population today numbers about 60,000 (just over 1% of the population) with some [[Miskito people|Miskito]] and [[Garifuna people|Garifuna]] (a population of mixed black African and [[Island Caribs|Carib]] Indian descent) living in the coastal regions.

Costa Rica's emigration is the smallest in the [[Caribbean Basin]] and is among the smallest in the [[Americas]]. By 2015 about just 133,185 (2.77%) of the country's people live in another country as immigrants. The main destination countries are the [[United States]] (85,924), [[Nicaragua]] (10,772), [[Panama]] (7,760), [[Canada]] (5,039), [[Spain]] (3,339), [[Mexico]] (2,464), [[Germany]] (1,891), [[Italy]] (1,508), [[Guatemala]] (1,162) and [[Venezuela]] (1,127).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.datosmacro.com/demografia/migracion/emigracion/costa-rica Costa Rica - Emigrantes totales] (in spanish) Según los últimos datos publicados Costa Rica tiene 133.185 emigrantes, lo que supone un 2,77% de la población de Costa Rica. Si miramos el ranking de emigrantes vemos que tiene un porcentaje de emigrantes medio, ya que está en el puesto 44º de los 195 del ranking de emigrantes.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Population and ancestry==
{{Costa Rican censuses}}
In {{UN_Population|Year}}, Costa Rica had a population of {{UN_Population|Costa Rica}}. The population is increasing at a rate of 1.5% per year.

The [[Costa Rica 2011 Census|2011 census]] counted a population of 4.3 million people&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://costaricalaw.com/costa-rica-facts/demographics-and-population/population-statistics/|title=Costa Rica Population Statistics|date=30 September 2016|website=Costaricalaw.com|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; distributed among the following groups: 83.6% whites or [[mestizo]]s, 6.7% [[mulatto]]es, 2.4% [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]], 1.1% black or [[Afro-Costa Rican|Afro-Caribbean]]; the census showed 1.1% as Other, 2.9% (141,304 people) as None, and 2.2% (107,196 people) as unspecified.&lt;ref name="livepopulation.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.livepopulation.com/country/costa-rica.html|title=Live Costa Rica Population Clock 2017 - Population of Costa Rica Today|website=Livepopulation.com|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, there were over 104,000 Native American or indigenous inhabitants, representing 2.4% of the population. Most of them live in secluded reservations, distributed among eight ethnic groups: Quitirrisí (in the Central Valley), Matambú or [[Chorotega people|Chorotega]] (Guanacaste), [[Maleku people|Maleku]] (northern Alajuela), [[Bribri people|Bribri]] (southern Atlantic), Cabécar (Cordillera de Talamanca), [[Guaymí]] (southern Costa Rica, along the Panamá border), [[Boruca people|Boruca]] (southern Costa Rica) and Térraba (southern Costa Rica).

The population includes [[European Costa Ricans]] (of European ancestry), primarily of [[Spanish people|Spanish]] descent,&lt;ref name=CIA&gt;{{cite web |author=Central Intelligence Agency |title=Costa Rica |work=The World Factbook |publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]] |location=Langley, Virginia |year=2011 |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/cs.html |accessdate=2011-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; with significant numbers of Italian, German, English, Dutch, French, Irish, Portuguese, and Polish families, as well a sizable Jewish community. The majority of the Afro-Costa Ricans are [[Creole English]]-speaking descendants of 19th century black [[Jamaicans|Jamaican]] immigrant workers.

The 2011 census classified 83.6% of the population as white or [[Mestizo]]; the latter are persons of combined European and Amerindian descent. The [[Mulatto]] segment (mix of white and black) represented 6.7% and indigenous people made up 2.4% of the population.&lt;ref name=CIA/&gt; Native and European mixed blood populations are far less than in other Latin American countries. Exceptions are [[Guanacaste Province|Guanacaste]], where almost half the population is visibly mestizo, a legacy of the more pervasive unions between Spanish colonists and Chorotega Amerindians through several generations, and [[Limón]], where the vast majority of the Afro-Costa Rican community lives.

According to the [[World Factbook]] the main religions are: Roman Catholic, 76.3%; Evangelical, 13.7%; Jehovah's Witnesses, 1.3%; other Protestant, 0.7%; other, 4.8%; none, 3.2%.

The most recent nationwide survey of '''[[religion]]''' in '''[[Costa Rica]]''', conducted in 2007 by the [[University of Costa Rica]], found that 70.5 percent of the population identify themselves as [[Roman Catholics]] (with 44.9 percent practicing, 25.6 percent nonpracticing), 13.8 percent are [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] Protestants, 11.3 percent report that they [[Nonreligious|do not have a religion]], and 4.3 percent declare that they belong to another religion.&lt;ref name=report&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/2008/108520.htm|title=Costa Rica: International Religious Freedom Report 2008|work=[[United States Department of State]]|date=2008|accessdate=4 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from the dominant Catholic religion, there are several other religious groups in the country.&lt;ref name=report/&gt; [[Methodist]], [[Lutheran]], [[Anglicanism|Episcopal]], [[Baptist]], and other Protestant groups have significant membership.&lt;ref name=report/&gt; [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) claim more than 35,000 members and has a temple in [[San José Costa Rica Temple|San José]] that served as a regional worship center for Costa Rica, Panama, Nicaragua, and Honduras.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsroom.lds.org/ldsnewsroom/eng/contact-us/costa-rica|title=Costa Rica|website=Newsroom.lds.org|date=|accessdate=13 December 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216015212/http://newsroom.lds.org/ldsnewsroom/eng/contact-us/costa-rica|archivedate=16 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although they represent less than 1 percent of the population, [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] have a strong presence on the Caribbean coast.&lt;ref name=report/&gt; Seventh-day Adventists operate a university that attracts students from throughout the Caribbean Basin.&lt;ref name=report/&gt; The [[Unification Church]] maintains its continental headquarters for Latin America in San José.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

Non-Christian religious groups, including followers of [[Judaism]], [[Islam]], [[Taoism]], [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna]], [[Paganism]], [[Wicca]], [[Scientology]], [[Tenrikyo]], and the [[Bahá'í Faith]], claim membership throughout the country, with the majority of worshipers residing in the Central Valley (the area of the capital).&lt;ref name=report/&gt; While there is no general correlation between religion and ethnicity, indigenous peoples are more likely to practice [[animism]] than other religions.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

Article 75 of the Costa Rican Constitution states that the "Catholic, Apostolic, and Roman Religion is the official religion of the Republic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.costaricalaw.com/legalnet/constitutional_law/engtit6.html|title=Title VI: Religion: Article 75 (As amended with regard to its number by Article 1, Law No. 5703)|work=CostaRicaLaw.com|date=6 June 1975|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010421171417/http://www.costaricalaw.com/legalnet/constitutional_law/engtit6.html|archivedate=21 April 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same article provides for [[freedom of religion]], and the Government generally respects this right in practice.&lt;ref name=report/&gt; The US government found no reports of societal abuses or discrimination based on religious belief or practice in 2007.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

This article is about the [[demographics|demographic]] features of the [[population]] of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], including [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population.

As many as 250 [[ethnic group]]s have been distinguished and named. The most numerous people are the [[Luba people|Luba]], [[Mongo people|Mongo]], and [[Bakongo]].

Although 700 local [[language]]s and [[dialect]]s are spoken, the linguistic variety is bridged both by the use of [[French language|French]] and the intermediary languages [[Kongo language|Kongo]], [[Luba-Kasai language|Luba-Kasai]], [[Swahili language|Swahili]], and [[Lingala language|Lingala]].

==Ethnic groups== 
{{See also|Category:Ethnic groups in the Democratic Republic of the Congo}}
More than 250 ethnic groups have been identified and named of which the majority are Bantu. The four largest groups - [[Mongo people|Mongo]], [[Luba people|Luba]], [[Kongo people|Kongo]] (all [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]]), and the [[Mangbetu people|Mangbetu]]-[[Zande people|Azande]] make up about 45% of the population. The country has also 60,000 [[White people in the Democratic Republic of the Congo|White Congolese]] most of [[Belgian]] ancestry who remained after independence.

More than 600,000 pygmies (around 1% of the total population) are believed to live in the DR Congo's huge forests, where they survive by hunting wild animals and gathering fruits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3869489.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Africa - DR Congo pygmies 'exterminated'|website=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Languages==
{{Main article|Languages of the Democratic Republic of the Congo}}

The four major languages in the DRC are French (official), Lingala (a lingua franca trade language), Kingwana (a dialect of [[Swahili language|Swahili]]), Kikongo, and Tshiluba. There are over 200 ethnic languages.

French is generally the medium of instruction in schools. English is taught as a compulsory foreign language in Secondary and High School around the country. It is a required subject in the Faculty of Economics at major universities around the country and there are numerous language schools in the country that teach it. In the town of Beni, for instance, there is a Bilingual University that offer courses in both French and English. President Kabila himself is fluent in both English and French, as was his father.

==Religions==
A survey conducted by the [[Demographic and Health Surveys]] program in 2013-2014 indicated that Christians constituted 93.7% of the population (Catholics 29.7%, Protestants 26.8%, and other Christians 37.2%). An indigenous religion, [[Kimbanguism]], has the adherence of 2.8%, while Muslims make up 1.2%.&lt;ref name="DHS 2013-14"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dhsprogram.com/pubs/pdf/FR300/FR300.pdf|title=Enquête Démographique et de Santé (EDS-RDC) 2013-2014|publisher=Ministère du Plan et Suivi de la Mise en œuvre de la Révolution de la Modernité, Ministère de la Santé Publique|language=French|format=PDF|page=36|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another estimate found Christianity was followed by 95.8% of the population, according to the [[Pew Research Center]] in 2010.&lt;ref name=religion&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2012/12/18/table-religious-composition-by-country-in-percentages/|title=Global Religious Landscape|publisher=Pew Forum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CIA The World Factbook states: [[Roman Catholic]] 50%, [[Protestant]] 20%, [[Kimbanguist]] 10%, [[Islam]] 10%, Other (includes [[Syncretic sect|Syncretic Sects]] and [[Indigenous religions|Indigenous beliefs]]) 10%.&lt;ref name="CIATONGA"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/cg.html|title= Africa :: CONGO, DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE

Joshua Project figures: Roman Catholic 43.9%, Protestant 24.8%, Other Christian 23.7%, Muslim 1.6%, Non-religious 0.6%, Hindu 0.1% other syncretic sects and indigenous beliefs 5.3%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.joshuaproject.net/countries.php?rog3=CG Joshua Project - Congo, Democratic Republic of - Religions]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bevölkerungspyramide DR Kongo 2016.png|thumb|Population pyramid 2016]]
The following demographic statistics are from the [[CIA World Factbook]], unless otherwise indicated.

===Population===
:56.9 million 
:''Note'': estimates for this country explicitly take into account the effects of excess mortality due to AIDS; this can result in lower life expectancy, higher infant mortality and death rates, lower population and growth rates, and changes in the distribution of population by age and gender than would otherwise be expected (July 2017 est.)

===Birth rate===
:33.5 births/1,000 population (2017 est.)

===Death rate===
:9.6 deaths/1,000 population (2017 est.)

===Median age===
:Total: 18.4 years
:Male: 18.1 years
:Female: 18.6 years (2016 est.)

===Population growth rate===
:2.42% (2016)

===Net migration rate===
-0.54 migrant(s)/1,000 population
''note'': fighting between the Congolese Government and Uganda- and Rwanda-backed Congolese rebels spawned a regional war in DRC in August 1998, which left 2.33 million Congolese internally displaced and caused 412,000 Congolese refugees to flee to surrounding countries (2011 est.)

Given the situation in the country and the condition of state structures, it is extremely difficult to obtain reliable data however evidence suggests that DRC continues to be a destination country for immigrants in spite of recent declines. Immigration is seen to be very diverse in nature, with refugees and asylum-seekers - products of the numerous and violent conflicts in the Great Lakes Region - constituting an important subset of the population in the country.&lt;ref name="IOMProfile"/&gt;

Additionally, the country’s large mine operations attract migrant workers from Africa and beyond and there is considerable migration for commercial activities from other African countries and the rest of the world, but these movements are not well studied. Transit migration towards South Africa and Europe also plays a role. Immigration in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|DRC]] has decreased steadily over the past two decades, most likely as a result of the armed violence that the country has experienced.&lt;ref name="IOMProfile"/&gt;

According to the [[International Organization for Migration]], the number of [[immigration|immigrants]] in the DRC has declined from just over 1 million in 1960, to 754,000 in 1990, to 480,000 in 2005, to an estimated 445,000 in 2010. Valid figures are not available on migrant workers in particular, partly due to the predominance of the [[informal economy]] in the DRC. Data are also lacking on irregular immigrants, however given neighbouring country ethnic links to nationals of the DRC, irregular migration is assumed to be a significant phenomenon in the country.&lt;ref name="IOMProfile"&gt;{{Cite document|url=http://publications.iom.int/bookstore/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=41_42&amp;products_id=592|publisher=International Organization for Migration|title=Migration en République Démocratique du Congo: Profil national 2009|year=2009|accessdate=2010-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Figures on the number of Congolese nationals abroad vary greatly depending on the source, from 3 to 6 million. This discrepancy is due to a lack of official, reliable data. Emigrants from the DRC are above all long-term emigrants, the majority of which live within [[Africa]] and to a lesser extent in [[Europe]]; 79.7% and 15.3% respectively, according to estimates on 2000 data. Most Congolese emigrants however, remain in Africa, with new destination countries including [[South Africa]] and various points en route to Europe.&lt;ref name="IOMProfile"/&gt;

In addition to being a host country, the DRC has also produced a considerable number of [[refugees]] and [[asylum-seekers]] located in the region and beyond. These numbers peaked in 2004 when, according to [[UNHCR]], there were more than 460,000 refugees from the DRC; in 2008, Congolese refugees numbered 367,995 in total, 68% of which were living in other African countries.&lt;ref name="IOMProfile"/&gt;

===Gender ratio===

:Under 15 years: 1.01 male(s)/female
:15–64 years: 0.99 male(s)/female
:65 years and over: 0.69 male(s)/female
:Total population: 0.99 male(s)/female (2011 est.)

|quote=No.197. On the North Wall of the Central Shrine&lt;br&gt;[[Thirumarperu|Manikanthesvara Temple]] at Tirumalpuram.&lt;br&gt;This record, which is dated in the 13th year of Parthivendradivarman who took the head of [[Pandyan dynasty|Vira-Pandya]], registers a gift of twenty-five ''Kalanju'' of gold marked and weighed by the standard weight(''dharmakattalai-tulai-nirai'') for burning two lamps in the temple of Siva at Tirumalperu. The assembly of Pattalam ''alias'' Elunurruva-chaturvedimangalam in Damar-nadu accepted the gold and agreed to maintain the two lamps from the interest thereon. It is interesting to note that the lamps were the gift of Vijjavai-Mahadeviyar or Vajjavaiyar who was related to Nandivarman Kadupattigal, perhaps, as his queen. Nandivarman Kadupattigal is clearly a Pallava name; but we cannot definitely identify the king nor fix his relationship to the ruling sovereign Parthivendradivarman.

|quote= This inscription has been published in ''S.I.I'' Vol. III. This is stated to be a record of all the gifts of gold made in earlier times for lamps to the temple which were now re-engraved on renovation from stones kept underground.The inscription is however left incomplete after the 4th line. Only one such item finds mention here viz. a gift made by Kadupattigal Nandippottaraiyar, obviously Pallava [[Nandivarman III]](and not Pallavamalla as supposed), for burning a lamp(after his surname) Kumaramarttanda, The authorities responsible for this reengraving viz. the assembly of Tiraimur, the ''nagarattar'' of Tiruvidaimarudil, the temple executives, the accountant and the manager are said to have met for their deliberation in the theatre hall of the temple, This early reference to the theatre in temples is noteworthy.

Clashes between soldiers of [[Zamorin]] and [[Portuguese India Armadas]] that took place during sixteenth century on coastal areas of [[Malabar region]], caused many Kadupattans who were inhabitants   of coastal areas of [[Kingdom of Tanur]] to move to Kanniyampuram of [[Valluvanad (southern Malabar)]](In present [[Ottappalam|Ottappalam taluk]]), [[Chittur-Thathamangalam|Chittur]] and other parts of [[Kingdom of Cochin]] and settle there.&lt;ref name="Viswasathinte kanappurangal"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "L.K.Anantha Krishna Iyer"/&gt;

|quote=By the sixteenth century we find a class of tutors called ''Ezhuthachans'' attached to the [[Kovilakam|''Kovilakams'']] of Thampurans and the big [[Tharavad|''tharavads'']] of [[Nair|Nayars]]. They were scholars in [[Sanskrit]], staying in the [[Nair|Nayar]] houses. They imparted elementary education to the [[Nair|Nayar]] boys and girls, instructing them in [[Arithmetic|arithmetic]], teaching them the alphabet and telling them stories from the [[Puranas|puranic literature]]. The term ''Ezhuthachan'' literally means 'father of language'.&lt;br&gt;We have a tradition to the effect that a group of people known as ''Kadupattar'', who were originally [[Brahmin|Brahmins]] called Bhattacharyas, belonging to the village of Kadu in [[Pandyan dynasty|Pandyadesa]], became [[Buddhism|buddhists]], and were forced to leave the country on account of persecution. They came to [[Calicut]] in 1447 AD. As refugees; and the Valiya Thampuratti(Seniormost lady of the palace) took pity on them and gave them asylum. They were rehabilitated as ''Ezhuthachans,'' teachers of alphabet, attached to the palace and the houses of nobles. The year their arrival is expressed by a chronogram in [[Katapayadi system|''kadapayaadi'']] style''-katukasteyaltyaktaah''-which yields the equivalent of the year AD.1447 when decoded. This tradition, cherished by the ''Ezhuthachan'' community, who made a livelihood by teaching in [[Ezhuthu Kalari|Ezhuthupalli]], mostly attached to the palaces or [[Nair|Nayar]] [[Tharavad|''Tharavads,'']] might contain some historical truth. They are treated as [[Shudra|''Sudras,'']] but unlike other [[Shudra|''Sudra'']] groups they are usually well-versed in [[Sanskrit]] literature. It is quite probable that they are descended from some [[Brahmin]] group ostracized and excommunicated on an account of some misadventure. The story of [[Brahmin|Buddhist]] connection need not be literally true, since any unorthodox view was labelled as 'Bauddha'-Buddhist- in the traditional society of [[Kerala]]. The period of their arrival in [[Calicut]] suggested in the story is quite significant, since a school of translators of [[Sanskrit]] classics into [[Malayalam]] appeared on the scene within a century after this. The greatest of Scribes and teachers was [[Thunchaththu Ezhuthachan|Thunchath Ramanujan Ezhuthachan]] of the 16th century.
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kadupattans used the prayer of [[Tirthankara|jain Tirthankara]] ''jina dheva''(''Namosthu jeenathe'') in their [[Ezhuthu Kalari|Ezhuthupalli]]({{Audio|Ml-in-Ezhuthupalli.ogg|pronunciation|help=no}}, {{lang-ml|എഴുത്തുപള്ളി}}, ''{{transl|ml|ISO|eḻuttupaḷḷi}}''), And taught [[Vatteluttu alphabet|Vattezhuthu]], [[Mathematics]] etc.&lt;ref&gt;

According to [[historian]] [[M. G. S. Narayanan]] the literary activities of [[Zamorin of Calicut|Malabar]], especially in [[Shudra|Sudras]] got strengthened after the arrival of Kadupattars. Translation of many texts from [[Sanskrit]] to [[Malayalam]] took place in the age after the arrival of them.&lt;ref name="Calicut_City_of_truth"/&gt;

In [[Kerala]] they were treated as [[shudra]].

==Ezhuthachan Samajam==
[[File:One of the oldest Ezhuthachan samajam office.jpg|thumb|One of the oldest Ezhuthachan samajam office built during 1920s situated at [[Avinissery]], [[Thrissur]]]][[File:എഴുത്തച്ഛൻ യുവജന രക്ഷാസംഘം.jpg|thumb|Ezhuthachan yuvajana raksha samgham [[Avinissery|Perinchery]] in 1937]]
Ezhuthachan Samajam started functioning from 1906 onwards. The first organizer was a [[Sanskrit]] scholar and a teacher Mr.Chakkulliyal Kunjunni Ezhuthachan who was a disciple of legendary [[Sanskrit]] scholar and teacher. [[Punnasseri Nambi Neelakanta Sharma|Revered Punnasseri Nambi Neelakanta Sharma]]. He named the organization as ''Adhyapaka Samajam''. Though ''Adhyapaka Samajam'' made several reformations in caste customs and rituals, Kunjunni Ezhuthachan's efforts were not successful and he abandoned his project.&lt;ref name= "L.K.Anantha Krishna Iyer"/&gt; Ezhuthachan samajam came in to being as a reality when Late [[P. Kumaran Ezhuthachan|Vakil P. Kumaran Ezhuthachan]] entered the arena. He was the real founder of the Ezhuthachan Samajam and architect of the present day Ezhuthachan community. He was also a [[Indian independence movement|freedom fighter]], a member of the [[Indian National Congress|congress party]] and also in [[Kochi rajya prajamandalam|Cochin State Prajamandal]], whose founder was [[V. R. Krishnan Ezhuthachan|Sri.V.R.Krishnan Ezhuthachan]], his son-in-law. Later [[V. R. Krishnan Ezhuthachan|Mr.Krishnan Ezhuthachan]] stepped into the shoes of his mentor and father-in-law, [[P. Kumaran Ezhuthachan|Mr. Kumaran Ezhuthachan]] as Ezhuthachan Samajam president. Since both were immersed in [[Indian National Congress|Congress politics]], [[Indian independence movement|freedom movement]], [[Peasant movement|peasant struggles]] and also in [[Kochi rajya prajamandalam|Cochin state Prajamandal]], they found it difficult to continue in the [[Kochi rajya prajamandalam|Ezhuthachan Samajam movement]]. Towards late 1940’s [[V. R. Krishnan Ezhuthachan|Krishnan Ezhuthachan]] left the movement, so also [[P. Kumaran Ezhuthachan|Vakil. P. Kumaran Ezhuthachan]]. [[P. Kumaran Ezhuthachan|Kumaran Ezhuthachan]] left the movement after a personal tragedy - The death of his son P.Lakshmanakumar. After 1947 the Ezhuthachan community was orphaned and community became rudderless. There were some attempts to revitalize the community by some spirited people, but it didn’t reach anywhere. The services of Adv. Late M. Krishnankutty is to be mentioned in this context. In the Post era, from 1990’s onwards there was some resurgence in the community. From late 1990’s new thinking is visible in the community. From 2002, [[T. G. Ravi|Mr.T.G.Ravi]] came into the scene and revitalized the samajam activities. The present president Prof. Dr. Lakshmanakumar is the grandson of [[P. Kumaran Ezhuthachan|Vakil. P. Kumaran Ezhuthachan]] and son of [[V. R. Krishnan Ezhuthachan|V R. Krishnan Ezhuthachan]].&lt;ref name = "Akhila Kerala Ezhuthachan Samajam"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

[[Food sovereignty]] is a highly influential idea in Bolivian political discourse. It is incorporated into multiple pieces of Bolivian legislation, including the 2009 constitution drafted underneath president [[Evo Morales]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Food sovereignty fits into Morales' larger goal of the symbolic decolonization of Bolivia.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mobilizing Bolivia's Displaced: Indigenous Politics and the Struggle over Land|last = Fabricant|first = Nicole|publisher = University of North Carolina Press|year = 2012|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; First coined by indigenous and peasant worker advocacy organization [[Via Campesina]], food sovereignty is the right for a state's people to produce and distribute culturally appropriate foods without the impingement of economic pressures created by foreign [[agribusiness]] producers.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The presence of foreign agribusiness in Bolivia can be traced back to exploitative resource extraction that proliferated in South America with 19th century liberalism.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Modern-day wholesale agribusiness production makes competition difficult for Bolivia’s small-scale farmers, who often take out high-interest loans and consequently accumulate debt.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In [[Bolivia]], indigenous peasant groups and government actors emphasize the value of traditional indigenous agricultural practices, the conservation of Bolivia's [[agricultural biodiversity]], and the strengthening of internal markets as benefits of food sovereignty.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The government's prioritization of strengthening Bolivia's economy through food sovereignty can contradict indigenous peasant priorities to alleviate rural poverty and restore the ability to make a living off of farmers' own home-plots.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Food Sovereignty Legislation in Bolivia ==
{{See also|Constitution of Bolivia}}The inclusion of food sovereignty into Bolivian legislation is understood by advocates as an essential step to the symbolic deconstruction of imperialist and racist histories, however the extent and ways by which the government is able to implement such policy is debated.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===2009 Constitution===
Food sovereignty was incorporated into the [[Constitution of Bolivia]] in 2009 under indigenous president [[Evo Morales]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.yale.edu/agrarianstudies/foodsovereignty/pprs/59_Cockburn_2013.pdf|title = Bolivia's Food Sovereignty &amp; Agrobiodiversity: Undermining the Local to Strengthen the State?|date = 2013|website = Food Sovereignty: A Critical Dialogue: International Conference|publisher = Yale University|last = Cockburn|first = Jenny}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bolivia follows Venezuela and Ecuador in incorporating food sovereignty into its constitution. Food sovereignty is first mentioned in Article 255 in which “Food security and sovereignty for the entire population; the prohibition of importation, production, and commercialization of genetically modified organisms and toxic elements that harm health and the environment”&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Bolivia_2009.pdf|title = Bolivia Constitution 2009|date = March 2015|accessdate = |website = |publisher = Constitue Project|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; is listed as an guiding principle for all of Bolivia’s contracted international relations. In Article 309, food sovereignty is listed as an objective with which state enterprises and entities should comply.

In Article 405, the first of Title III, comprehensive, sustainable rural development is noted as a fundamental priority of the State. According to the constitution, the State should prioritize “communitarian economic undertakings and those of the group of rural actors placing emphasis on food security and sovereignty” by the means of five principles. These are as follows:
# The sustained and sustainable increase of agricultural, livestock, manufacturing, agro-industrial, and tourist industry productivity, as well as their commercial capacity.
# The articulation and internal complementary form of the structures of agricultural, livestock and agro-industrial production.
# Achievement of better conditions for economic exchange of the rural productive sector in relations to the rest of the Bolivian economy.
# The importance and respect of the rural native indigenous communities in all dimensions of their life.
# The strengthening of the economy of the small agricultural and livestock producers and of the family and communitarian economy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
Also in Title III, which is dedicated to comprehensive, sustainable rural development, the guarantee of food sovereignty is listed as an objective of state policy aimed at rural development in coordination with “autonomous and decentralized territorial entities”. Focal to this food sovereignty objective is the production and consumption of foods produced in Bolivia.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Other legislation ===
Bolivian Law 3525 or "Regulation and Promotion of Ecological Agricultural and Non-timber Forest Production" states food sovereignty as a right and details international and Bolivian certification systems.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Law 144, of Productive, Communal and Agricultural Revolution, bans [[Genetically modified organism|GMO]] plant varieties for crops native to Bolivia, but not for those such as cotton, rice, sugar cane, and soy that are non-native and popular for export. There is debate among both state actors and indigenous and peasants groups that the GMO ban may make producing less accessible for small farmers and drive up food costs in internal markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/31/us-bolivia-soy-gmo-idUSBRE89U0S620121031|title = Bolivian farmers urge rethink on Mother Earth law|date = 2011|accessdate = |website = Reuters|publisher = |last = Popper|first = Helen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Law of the Rights of Mother Earth|Mother Earth Law]] concerns food sovereignty in that it asserts nature's rights to be free from genetic modification and have its biodiversity be maintained. It aligns with indigenous food sovereignty logic in that it addresses value in traditional indigenous conceptions of nature as having an inherent right to sustainability and restoration.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.pulsamerica.co.uk/2012/10/25/ley-madre-tierra-mother-earth-law-what-can-we-expect-from-bolivias-new-environmental-law/|title = What can we expect from Bolivia's Mother Earth Law?|date = 2012|accessdate = |website = Pulse America|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy, Politics, and Economics of Food Sovereignty in Bolivia ==

Food sovereignty, first coined by indigenous and peasant advocacy organization Vía Campesina, is the “right to produce, distribute, and consume nutritious, culturally appropriate food in a way that is ecologically sustainable”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The goals of food sovereignty are to preserve agrobiodiversity, strengthen Bolivia’s internal markets, renew social value for local foods, and secure more power for indigenous and peasant groups in deciding what they eat and how it is produced. In [[Bolivia]], food sovereignty is part of a larger post-neoliberal, decolonized agenda of the state.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Pestalozzi notes traditional agricultural systems are quite fluid and incorporate modern agricultural strategies, and that the goals of food sovereignty should be to allowed indigenous groups and farmers to produce and consume food as they wish and in accordance with their values regarding nature.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

The success of agribusiness wholesale production in Bolivia has meant reduced labor returns and increased production costs for rural Bolivian families attempting to maintain plots on their own. This often obliges Bolivian families to search for off-farm supplementary income and means to provide consumer goods, or to migrate away from their farms altogether.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Historical Legacies of Exploitation ===
In Bolivia, an increase in agricultural monocropping to fulfill foreign and domestic market demands has exacerbated historically rooted tensions over the consolidation of land ownership and deforestation between indigenous peoples and peasant farmers on one side and wholesale producing agribusinesses on the other.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These businesses use agrochemicals and monocropping that contrast traditional indigenous modes of production. Food sovereignty advocates trace the current food sovereignty struggle back to liberalization of trade and international investment in export-oriented agriculture, such as sugarcane plantations from the mid-twentieth century. Nicole Fabricant equates “early colonial pillaging” to “neocolonial policies of privatization and commodization of the most basic elements”.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Small-scale Bolivian farmers and indigenous groups experience difficulty competing with businesses involved in this process and paying off loans acquired from attempts to also participate as a producer.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Advocates argue against the power of export-oriented industries to define food production and for the right of the country’s farmers and indigenous groups to do so. New waves of imported cheap and subsidized foods also fill local markets and make it difficult for domestic producers to compete locally or regionally.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Food Sovereignty and Indigeneity ===
Bolivian food sovereignty advocates from varied backgrounds of campesino and indigenous identification, take advantage of the now broad and landless global conception of indigeneity and indigenous rights to advocate for food sovereignty.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Some argue, however, that the use of this discourse may actually only reinforce a class system in which indigenous peoples are viewed as the a lower ring, powerless group.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Migration from the Andes into the Bolivian lowlands, where many agroindustrial complexes have been built, has resulted in the mixing of indigenous knowledge systems and agricultural practices that provide a broad base for the food sovereignty struggle.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Food Sovereignty Motivations and Agendas ===
Various indigenous, peasant, government, and non-governmental organizations claim support for food sovereignty, though these groups act on different definitions and motivations.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  While state-sanctioned food sovereignty may  support [[genetically modified food]] and agrochemicals, indigenous and peasant groups often do not. Government activities to support food sovereignty include providing training in particular agricultural practices and conducting research on different agriculture approaches. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization also has conducted similar research.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Some argue that the state’s conception of food sovereignty serves the purpose of maintaining profit stability as an independent nation and does not possess the same concern for the effects of resource extraction as indigenous groups.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The indigenous and peasant advocacy organization Vía Campesina is active in Bolivia’s food sovereignty movement. Four Bolivian organizations are affiliated with Vía Campesina, the [[Unified Syndical Confederation of Rural Workers of Bolivia]] (CSUTCB), the National Confederation of Indigenous Campesino and Native Women of Bolivia–Bartolina Sisa, the [[Syndicalist Confederation of Intercultural Communities of Bolivia]], and the Landless Workers' Movement of Bolivia (MST-B). They advance the idea that food is primarily a people’s resource and source of nutrition and should only secondarily be an item of trade.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Food Sovereignty versus Food Security ===
The Bolivian concept of “food sovereignty” differs from that of “food security”. While food security places emphasis on the quantity of food production and increasing access to food, sovereignty is concerned with  how, where, and by whom food is produced and how Bolivian communities are affected by an increasingly foreign-influenced market. The food sovereignty ideal has gained traction as a framework for conserving agrobiodiversity,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; as well as an increased global interest in sustainable and organic agriculture.

== Indigenous knowledge systems ==
Bolivian, and particularly Andean, knowledge systems emphasize sharing food, appreciating producers, diversity, environmental risk management, and food security.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; These knowledge systems include the existence of [[Pachamama]], or Mother Earth, as a sacred being.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Ayllu ===
The [[ayllu]] is one indigenous knowledge framework that has been discussed as a possible alternative model by which food production could be practiced in a food sovereign Bolivia. The traditional values of reciprocity, communal resource management, and food access are fundamental aspects of the ayllu. The ayllu system has been preserved over time by increased autonomy due to previous condemnation and marginalization in rural lands. The ayllu organizes people into units, focuses on the human as the center of production, and incorporates care and concern for the environment, risk management, and dietary diversity.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Gender complementarity is a tenet of the ayllu system, however many women facing gender inequality today have faced difficulty incorporating their voices into the public forums on food sovereignty.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Aynuqa System ===
The aynuqa system balances cultivated land and fallow land through crop rotation in the Bolivian [[altiplano]]. Aynuqa plots are communally owned but individually worked and inherited. The plots are put through cycles of land used for crop cultivation, grazing, regrowth, and firewood collection. Communal walls around plots help to protect crops from animals and frost. The construction and use of communal walls lessens individual workload, maintenance costs, and allows farmers to take turns shepherding over their neighbor's animals.The aynuqa is managed by the ayllu system.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Categorizations such as ''Lullu Laq'a, Samata, and Puruma'' are used to describe a given field's fertility and state of vegetation regrowth based on traditional knowledge.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1659/0276-4741(2000)020%5B0064%3ASFSATM%5D2.0.CO%3B2|title = Sectoral Fallow Systems and the Management of Soil Fertility: The Rationality of Indigenous Knowledge in the High Andes of Bolivia|last = Pestalozzi|first = Hansueli|date = 2000|journal = Mountain Research and Development|doi = 10.1659/0276-4741(2000)020[0064:SFSATM]2.0.CO;2|pmid = |access-date =|volume=20|pages=64–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, ayllus and aynuqas are disappearing due to migration and the intensification of quiona production for export.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==== Sectoral Fallow Systems ====
{{See also|Crop rotation}}By the fallow system, fields are cultivated for several years with one crop before being allowed to lie fallow for several more years before a new crop is introduced. Of up to hundreds of fields divided amongst farmers, only small subsets are cultivated at a time while others lie fallow. Yields may produce up to three times that of a non-fallow system Bolivian plot. During the fallow period, the vegetation regrowth is used for animal grazing.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Typically the first crop that is planted is potatoes. Later crops may include but are not limited to other varieties of potatoes, quiona, oats, or barley. Despite soil with low nutrient content and harsh environmental conditions in the Andes, the fallow system creates conditions to reproduce soil nutrients and eventually high yields.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

The fallow system incorporates traditional knowledge about soil fertility management with strategic use of newer technologies such as mineral fertilizer at their own discretion. The system not only helps achieve high yields but also sustainably preserves the land’s ability to renew and regrow. At any given time, there are local men working in roles to ensure that the cultivate and fallow rules are being followed properly. Reduced workload, reduced pests, medicinal herb and plant product regeneration, and the mineralization of nutrients for the soil have all been documented as results of the cultivate and fallow system.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

== Crops relevant to Food Sovereignty ==
{{See also|Agriculture in Bolivia}}

=== Quinoa ===
[[Quinoa]] is a grain native to the Andean region that is high in protein content and micronutrients. It is capable of growing in the harsh climatic conditions of the Bolivian altiplano despite the high levels of frost, salinity, and drought.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The crop has long been known for its nutritional value, and has indigenous symbolic meaning due to its long history within the region. It historically has been associated with poorer populations due to its rural use and origin.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Hellin, Jon and Higman, Sophie. 2001. Quinua and Rural Livelihoods in Bolivia, Peru, and Ecuador. OXFAM, Oxford, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; Preparation of quinoa for consumption is labor-intensive, particularly the removal of the grain’s saponin covering. In the Bolivian Andes, farmers who are compelled to work away from home in order to supplement their own farm income do not have the proper amounts of time to prepare quinoa for their own home consumption, opting instead for cheaper foreign-subsidized breads and pastas.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

There are many different varieties of quinoa, which vary in what type of environment best suited for their production.  With quinoa’s growing global popularity, Bolivian farmers have begun to grow the varieties that are favored in the export market rather than those best suited for home consumption.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This means a nutritious product is grown in large quantities for export from a country with widespread malnutrition.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; There have been some attempts to reintroduce quinoa to Bolivia's population through encouragement of more consumption in the middle classes.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Foreign interests have patented many varieties of quinoa, and it is sold globally.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Due to emphasis on export-oriented production, Bolivian farmers are increasingly excluded from control or consultation over quiona genetic resources. As farmers are encouraged to cultivate market-favoring varieties, native varieties are put at risk of disappearance. As quinoa grows in popularity, the risk of [[Bioprospecting|biopiracy]] and patenting indigenous Andean genetic material increases. This possibility has influenced Bolivian farmers to be reluctant to work with scientist sand groups researching to improve quinoa varieties.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==== Public Perception ====
Historically, quiona was stigmatized as a poor person’s food and replaced by non-indigenous peoples with wheat, barley, and other popular European products. Quiona has attracted interest in recent years as a potential solution to the food security crisis due to its high protein, micronutrients, and "rustic" characterization. Quiona’s ability to improve nutritional status for those living in poverty is still debated. Projects that have attempted to reintroduce quiona to rural and impoverished populations have faced difficulty due to the high labor costs and time associated with cultivating quiona as well as the continued lower-class perception of quinoa in Bolivia's urban middle class.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Fair Trade: The Challenges of Transforming Globalization|last = Cáceres|first = Zina|publisher = Routledge|year = 2007|isbn = |location = |pages = |chapter = Fair Trade and quinoa from the southern Bolivian Altiplano|last2 = Carimentrand|first2 = Aurélie|first3 = John|last3 = Wilkinson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Soy ===
Many industrial farmers originally invested in sugarcane plantations switched to the production of [[soy]]. The soy market is very profitable, as it is used globally to create biofuel as an alternative energy source.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This shift to soy represents a transformation of Bolivian land use in which the land is used for wholesale production aimed at a global market rather than for subsistence or domestic uses. Small-scale Bolivian farmers and indigenous groups experience difficulty competing with businesses involved in this process and paying off loans acquired from attempts to also participate as a producer.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Much of Bolivia’s soy and oilseed is produced in Bolivia's tropical eastern lowlands.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://goedoc.uni-goettingen.de/goescholar/bitstream/handle/1/8758/JARTSVol112No2S125_Schüttel.pdf?sequence=1|title = Domestic policy responses to the food price crisis: The case of Bolivia|last = Schuttel|first = Carsten|date = 2011|journal = Journal of Agriculture and Rural Development in the Tropics and Subtropics|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Kleinwechter|first2 = Ulrich}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 70% the department of Santa Cruz is devoted to soy production. As a non-native crop, GMO soy seeds are not banned in Bolivia, as is the case of other non-native crops such as cotton, rice, and sugar cane.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://nacla.org/blog/2012/11/16/earth-first-bolivia’s-mother-earth-law-meets-neo-extractivist-economy|title = Earth First? Bolivia’s Mother Earth Law Meets the Neo-Extractivist Economy|date = 2012-11-16|accessdate = |website = North American Congress on Latin America|publisher = |last = Achtenberg|first = Emily}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wheat Imports ===
Imports of wheat from North American countries, in the form of food aid and subsidized commercial product, dwarf the production of traditional Bolivian crops such as quinoa. These imports, as well as reduced tariffs on imports to these areas, are put in place to help feed Bolivia’s poor. The low prices of these subsidized foods means traditional and native crops are not able to compete as crops for national subsistence. Traditional crops thus become targets for export rather than internal consumption. These wheat-based foods are generally less nutritionally dense but easier and cheaper to acquire and consume.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

On example of food sovereignty policy is the "Enterprise for Support in Food Production" (EMAPA), established by the Bolivian government during the 2007-2009 food crisis. A rise in international food prices, particularly for grains and oilseed, left poorer nations such as Bolivia vulnerable food insecurity. To combat this and stabilize domestic consumer prices, EMAPA subsidized fertilizer, made and purchased wheat, and distributed subsidized wheat flour in larger Bolivian towns. EMAPA's ultimate purpose was to decrease Bolivia's dependence on the stability of the international food market. According to Schüttel, EMAPA was not ultimately successful in shielding Bolivia from international price shocks.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

=== Languages ===
Ghanaian Canadians speak English, and often also speak [[Akan language|Akan]], [[Kwa languages|Kwa]] and [[Twi]]. Ghanaians have an easier time adapting to life in Canada than other immigrants because their homeland of Ghana has the [[English language]] as the official language and it is spoken by the majority of Ghana's population.

[[Greeks|Greek]] presence in [[Italy]] begins with the migrations of the old [[Greek Diaspora]] in the 8th century BC, continuing down to the present time. There is an ethnic minority known as the [[Griko people]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=PARDO-DE-SANTAYANA, MANUEL |author2=Pieroni, Andrea |author3=Puri, Rajindra K. |title= Ethnobotany in the new Europe: people, health and wild plant resources |publisher= Berghahn Books |year= 2010 |pages=173–174 |isbn= 978-1-84545-456-2 |quote= {{ISBN|1-84545-456-1}}" "The ethnic Greek minorities living in southern Italy today exemplify the establishment of independent and permanent colonial settlements of Greeks in history. }}&lt;/ref&gt; who live in the [[Southern Italy|Southern Italian]] regions of [[Calabria]] ([[Province of Reggio Calabria]]) and [[Apulia]], especially the peninsula of [[Salento]], within the old [[Magna Graecia]] region, who speak a distinctive dialect of Greek called [[Griko]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.gr/www.mfa.gr/en-US/Policy/Geographic+Regions/Europe/Relationships+with+EU+Member+States/Italy/ Greek MFA: Greek community in Italy]&lt;/ref&gt; They are believed to be remnants of the ancient&lt;ref&gt;G. Rohlfs, ''Griechen und Romanen in Unteritalien'', 1924.&lt;/ref&gt; and medieval Greek communities, who have lived in the south of Italy for centuries. Alongside this group, a smaller number of more recent [[Greek diaspora|migrants from Greece]] lives in Italy, forming an expatriate community in the country. Today many Greeks in Southern Italy follow Italian customs and culture.

[[File:Location greek ancient.png|300px|right|thumb|Greek Diaspora 6th century BC]]

In the 8th and 7th centuries BC, for various reasons, including demographic crisis (famine, overcrowding, climate change, etc.), the search for new commercial outlets and ports, and expulsion from their homeland, Greeks began a large [[Colonies in antiquity#Greek colonies|colonization]] drive, including southern Italy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.initaly.com/regions/classic/greek.htm Greek Italy:A Roadmap]&lt;/ref&gt;

In this same time, Greek colonies were established in places as widely separated as the eastern coast of the [[Black Sea]] and [[Marseille|Massalia]] ([[Marseille]]). They included settlements in Sicily and the southern part of the Italian peninsula. The Romans called the area of Sicily and the foot of the boot of [[Italy]] ''Magna Graecia'' (Latin, "Greater Greece"), since it was so densely inhabited by [[Greeks]]. The ancient [[geographer]]s differed on whether the term included Sicily or merely [[Apulia]] and [[Calabria]] &amp;mdash; [[Strabo]] being the most prominent advocate of the wider definitions.

During the [[Early Middle Ages]], new waves of [[Byzantine Greeks|Greeks]] came to Magna Graecia from Greece and Asia Minor, as Southern Italy remained governed by the [[Eastern Roman Empire]]. Although most of the Greek inhabitants of Southern Italy became de-hellenized and no longer spoke Greek, remarkably a small [[Griko language|Griko]]-speaking minority still exists today in [[Calabria]] and mostly in [[Salento]]. ''Griko'' is the name of a language combining ancient [[Doric Greek|Doric]], [[Medieval Greek|Byzantine Greek]], and [[Italian language|Italian]] elements, spoken by people in the Magna Graecia region. There is rich [[oral history|oral tradition]] and Griko [[folklore]], limited now, though once numerous, to only a few thousand people, most of them having become absorbed into the surrounding Italian element. Records of Magna Graecia being predominantly Greek-speaking, date as late as the 11th century  (the end of Byzantine domination in [[Southern Italy]]).

The migration of [[Byzantine Greek]] scholars and other emigres from [[Byzantium]] during the decline of the [[Byzantine empire]] (1203–1453) and mainly after the fall of [[Constantinople]] in 1453 until the 16th century, is considered by modern scholars as crucial in the revival of [[ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[ancient Rome|Roman]] studies, arts and sciences, and subsequently in the development of [[Renaissance humanism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-orb.net/encyclop/late/laterbyz/harris-ren.html Byzantines in Renaissance Italy]&lt;/ref&gt; These emigres were grammarians, humanists, poets, writers, printers, lecturers, musicians, astronomers, architects, academics, artists, scribes, philosophers, scientists, politicians and theologians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://how-to-learn-any-language.com/e/polyglots/greeks-in-italy.html Greeks in Italy]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the decades following the Ottoman [[conquest of Constantinople]] many Greeks began to settle in territories of the [[Republic of Venice]], including in [[Venice]] itself. In 1479 there were between 4000 and 5000 Greek residents in Venice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Nicol, Donald M. |title=The Byzantine lady: ten portraits, 1250–1500 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1996 |page=104 |isbn=978-0-521-57623-9 |quote={{ISBN|0-521-57623-7}}" "In 1479 it was reckoned that there were between 4000 and 5000 Greek residents in Venice.

===Modern Italy===

Although most of the Greek inhabitants of [[Southern Italy]] became entirely Italianized during the Middle Ages (as [[Paestum]] had already been in the 4th century BC), pockets of Greek culture and language remained and survived into modern times. This is due to the fact that the migration routes between southern Italy and the Greek mainland never entirely ceased to exist.

Thus, for example, Greeks re-colonized the region in the 16th and 17th centuries. This happened in reaction to the conquest of the Peloponnese by the Ottoman Turks. Especially after the fall of Coroni (1534) large numbers of Greeks and Albanians sought, and were granted, refuge in the areas of Calabria, Salento and Sicily. The Greeks from [[Koroni|Coroni]] - the so-called Coronians - belonged to the nobility and brought with them substantial movable property. They were granted special privileges and given tax exemptions. Another part of the Greeks that moved to Italy came from the Mani region of the Peloponnese. The [[Maniots]] were known for their proud military traditions and for their bloody vendettas (another portion of these Greeks moved to Corsica; cf. the Corsican vendettas). These migrations strengthened the depopulated Italian south with a culturally vibrant and militarily capable element.

===Griko people===
{{Main|Griko people}}

The Griko people are a population group in [[Italy]] of ultimately [[Greek people|Greek]] origin which still exists today in the Italian regions of [[Calabria]] and [[Apulia]].&lt;ref name="Bekerman Zvi; Kopelowitz, Ezra 2008 390"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Bekerman Zvi |author2=Kopelowitz, Ezra |title=Cultural education-- cultural sustainability: minority, diaspora, indigenous, and ethno-religious groups in multicultural societies |publisher= Routledge |year=2008 |page=390 |isbn=978-0-8058-5724-5 |quote={{ISBN|0-8058-5724-9}}" "Griko Milume - This reaction was even more pronounced in the southern Italian communities of Greek origins.

While being Italian citizens, they are actually aware of their Greek roots and again the defense of their language is the key to their identity. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Griko people traditionally spoke the ''[[Griko language]]'', a form of the [[Greeks|Greek]] language combining ancient [[Doric Greek|Doric]] and [[Medieval Greek|Byzantine Greek]] elements. Some believe that the origins of the Griko language may ultimately be traced to the colonies of Magna Graecia. Greeks were the dominant population element of some regions in the south of Italy, especially Calabria, the Salento, parts of [[Lucania]] and Sicily until the 12th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Loud, G.

Parts of the central and north-western Salento, recovered early, came to have a Greek majority through immigration, as did parts of Lucania. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the past centuries the Griko have been heavily influenced by the Catholic Church and Latin culture and as a result many Griko have become largely assimilated&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Pounds, Norman John Greville |title=An historical geography of Europe, 450 B.C.-A.D.1330 |publisher=CUP Archive |year=1976 |page=251 |isbn=978-0-521-29126-2 |quote={{ISBN|0-521-29126-7}}" "Greeks had also settled in southern Italy and Sicily which retained until Norman conquest a tenuous link with Constantinople.

==Immigrants==
[[File:BulgariNecklace.jpg|150px|right|thumb|The [[Bulgari]] brand was founded by Sotirio Bulgari, a Greek immigrant to Italy]]
After [[World War II]], a large number of Greeks immigrated to countries abroad, mostly to the United States, Canada and Australia, however, a smaller number of diaspora migrants from Greece entered [[Italy]] from World War II onwards, today the Greek diaspora community consists of some 30,000 people, the majority of whom are located in [[Rome]] and [[Central Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mfa.gr/www.mfa.gr/en-US/Policy/Geographic+Regions/Europe/Relationships+with+EU+Member+States/Italy/ |title=Hellenic Republic Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Italy, The Greek Community|quote= Greek community. The Greek diaspora consists of some 30,000 people, most of whom are to be found in Central Italy. There has also been an age-old presence of Italian nationals of Greek descent, who speak the Greco dialect peculiar to the Magna Graecia region. This dialect can be traced historically back to the era of Byzantine rule, but even as far back as classical antiquity. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hungarians in Serbia''' are the second largest ethnic group in the country if not counting [[Kosovo]]. According to the 2011 census, there are 253,899 ethnic [[Hungarians]] composing 3.5% of the population of Serbia.&lt;ref name=pop2011 /&gt; The majority of them live in the northern province of [[Vojvodina]], where they number 251,136 or 13% of the population of the province. Most Hungarians in Serbia are [[Roman Catholics]] by faith, while smaller numbers of them are Protestant (mostly [[Reformed Church|Calvinist]]). [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] is listed as one of the six official languages of Vojvodina, autonomous province which traditionally fosters multilingualism, [[multiculturalism]] and multiconfessionalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vojvodina.gov.rs/en/autonomous-province-vojvodina|title=Government of Vojvodina|work=vojvodina.gov.rs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{section or|date=March 2014}}
Parts of the [[Vojvodina]] region were included into the medieval [[Kingdom of Hungary (medieval)|Kingdom of Hungary]] in the 10th century, and [[Hungarians]] then began to settle in the region, which before that time was mostly populated by the [[West Slavs]]. During Hungarian administration, Hungarians formed the largest part of population in northern parts of the region, while southern parts were populated by sizable Slavic population. Following the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] conquest and inclusion of Vojvodina into Ottoman Empire in the 16th century, most of the Hungarian population fled from the region. During Ottoman occupation, Vojvodina region was mostly populated by [[Serbs]] and [[Muslim Slavs]] ([[Great Migrations of the Serbs]]). New Hungarian settlers started to come to the region with the establishment of the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg]] administration at the beginning of the 18th century, mostly after the [[Peace of Passarowitz|Peace of Passarowitz (Požarevac)]].

===Settlement===

Count [[Imre Csáky (cardinal)|Imre Csáky]] settled Hungarians in his possessions in [[Bačka]] in 1712. In 1745, Hungarian colonists settled in [[Senta]], in 1750 in [[Bačka Topola|Topola]], in 1752 in [[Doroslovo]], in 1772 in [[Bogojevo]], in 1760 in [[Kanjiža|Stara Kanjiža]], in 1764 in [[Mali Iđoš|Iđoš]], in 1767 in [[Bačko Petrovo Selo|Petrovo Selo]], in 1776 in [[Martonoš]], in 1786 in [[Pačir]] and [[Ostojićevo]], in 1787 in [[Rumenka|Piroš]], and in 1789 in [[Feketić]]. Between 1782 and 1786, Hungarians settled in [[Crvenka]] and [[Stara Moravica]], and in 1794 in [[Kula (Vojvodina)|Kula]].

[[File:Arača 3.jpg|thumb|Ruins of Arača church.]]

Hungarians of Roman Catholic faith originated mostly from [[Transdanubia]], while those of Protestant faith originated mostly from [[Alföld]]. Between 1751 and 1753, Hungarians settled in [[Mol, Serbia|Mol]] and [[Ada, Serbia|Ada]] (Those originated mostly from [[Szeged]] and [[Jászság]]). In 1764–1767, Hungarians settled in [[Subotica]], [[Bajmok]] and [[Čantavir]], and in 1770 again in [[Kanjiža]], [[Mol, Serbia|Mol]], [[Ada, Serbia|Ada]] and [[Bačko Petrovo Selo|Petrovo Selo]], as well as in [[Bačko Gradište|Feldvarac]], [[Srbobran|Sentomaš]] and [[Turija (Srbobran)|Turija]].

In [[Banat]], the settling of Hungarians started later. In 1784 Hungarians settled in [[Padej]] and [[Nakovo]], in 1776 in [[Torda (Žitište)|Torda]], in 1786 in [[Novi Itebej|Donji Itebej]], in 1796 in [[Novo Miloševo|Beodra]] and [[Čoka]], in 1782 in [[Banatski Monoštor|Monoštor]], in 1798 in [[Nova Crnja|Mađarska Crnja]], in 1773 in [[Srpski Krstur|Krstur]] and [[Majdan, Novi Kneževac|Majdan]], in 1774 in [[Debeljača]], in 1755–1760 in [[Zrenjanin|Bečkerek]], and in 1766 in [[Vršac]]. In 1790, 14 Hungarian families from [[Transylvania]] settled in [[Banat]].

In the 19th century, the Hungarian expansion increased. From the beginning of the century, the Hungarian individuals and small groups of settlers from [[Alföld]] constantly immigrating to [[Bačka]]. In the first half of the 19th century larger and smaller groups of the colonists settled in [[Mol, Serbia|Mol]] (in 1805), as well as in [[Bačko Gradište|Feldvarac]], [[Temerin]] and [[Novi Sad]] (in 1806). In 1884, Hungarian colonists settled in [[Šajkaška]] and in [[Sivac|Mali Stapar]] near [[Sombor]]. In 1889, Hungarians were settled in [[Svilojevo]] near [[Apatin]] and in 1892 in [[Bogojevo|Gomboš]], while another group settled in Gomboš in 1898. Many Hungarian settlers from Gomboš moved to [[Bačka Palanka]]. After the abolishment of the [[Military Frontier]], Hungarian colonists were settled in [[Potisje]], [[Čurug]], [[Žabalj]], [[Šajkaš|Šajkaški Sveti Ivan]], [[Titel]] and [[Mošorin]]. In 1883 around 1,000 [[Székely]] Hungarians settled in [[Kula (Vojvodina)|Kula]], [[Kanjiža|Stara Kanjiža]], [[Bečej|Stari Bečej]] and [[Titel]].

In 1800, smaller groups of Hungarian colonists from Transdanubia settled in [[Čoka]], while in the same time colonists from [[Csanád County|Csanád]] and [[Csongrád (former county)|Csongrád]] counties settled in area around [[Srpski Itebej|Itebej]] and [[Srpska Crnja|Crnja]], where they at first lived in scattered small settlements, and later they formed one single settlement – [[Nova Crnja|Mađarska Crnja]]. In 1824, one group of colonists from [[Čestereg]] also settled in [[Nova Crnja|Mađarska Crnja]]. In 1829 Hungarians settled in [[Mokrin]], and in 1880 an even larger number of Hungarians settled in this municipality. In 1804, Hungarian colonists from Csongrád county settled in [[Filić|Firiđhaza]] (which was then joined with [[Novi Kneževac|Turska Kanjiža]]), as well as in [[Sajan (village)|Sajan]] and [[Torda (Žitište)|Torda]]. Even a larger group of Hungarians from Csongrád settled in 1804 in [[Debeljača]]. In 1817–1818 Hungarians settled in [[Veliki Bikač]], and in 1820–1840 smaller groups of Hungarians settled in [[Vranjevo]]. In 1826, colonists from [[Jászság]] and [[Kunság]] settled in [[Arač]] near [[Novo Miloševo|Beodra]]. In 1830, Hungarians from [[Alföld]] settled in [[Veliki Lec]], in 1831 in [[Ostojićevo]], in 1832 in [[Malenčino Selo]] near [[Veliki Gaj]], in 1839 and 1870 in [[Padej]], in 1840 in [[Jermenovci]] and [[Mihajlovo|Mađarski Sentmihalj]], in 1840–1841 in [[Dušanovac, Banat|Dušanovac]], in 1841 in [[Hetin]], in 1859 in [[Sanad, Serbia|Sanad]], in 1869 in [[Đurđevo, Banat|Đurđevo]] (later moved to Skorenovac), and in 1890 in [[Mužlja|Gornja Mužlja]]. In 1883-1886, [[Székely]] Hungarians from [[Bukovina]] were settled in [[Vojlovica, Pančevo|Vojlovica]], [[Skorenovac]], [[Ivanovo (Serbia)|Ivanovo]] and [[Đurđevo, Banat|Đurđevo]]. Total number of Székely colonists was 3,520.

The first Hungarian settlers in the southern region of [[Syrmia|Srem]] moved there during the 1860s from neighbouring counties, especially from Bačka.

According to the 1900 census, the Hungarians were the largest ethnic group in the [[Bács-Bodrog County]] and made up 42.7% in the population (the second largest were [[Germans]] with 25.1%, and the third largest group were Serbs with 18.2%). The Hungarians were third largest group in the [[Torontál County]] (West Banat) with 18.8% (after Serbs with 31.5% and Germans with 30,2%).&lt;ref name="kt.lib.pte.hu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kt.lib.pte.hu/cgi-bin/kt.cgi?konyvtar/kt06042201/0_0_3_pg_22.html |title=Results of 1900 and 1910 censuses in Hungary}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the next census, in 1910, the Hungarians were the largest group in the [[Bács-Bodrog County]] with 44,8% in the population (followed by Germans with 23.5% and Serbs with 17.9%), and the third largest in the Torontál County with 20.9% (Serbs with 32.5%, Germans with 26.9%).&lt;ref name="kt.lib.pte.hu"/&gt;

The new temporary borders established in 1918 and permanent ones defined by the [[Treaty of Trianon]] in 1920 put an end to Hungarian immigration. After [[World War I]], present-day Vojvodina was included into the newly formed [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes]] (later known as the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]) and many Hungarians of Vojvodina wanted to live in the post-Trianon Hungarian state, thus, some of them immigrated to Hungary, which was a destination for several emigration waves of Hungarians from Vojvodina. The interwar period was generally marked by a stagnation of the Hungarian population. During these times, they numbered around 363,000 (1921 census) – 376,000 (1931 census) and they constituted about 23-24% of the entire population of Vojvodina. The outbreak of the [[World War II|Second World War]] caused some changes in population numbers, but more importantly it created tensions between the Hungarian and Serb communities.

===World War II===
With the onset of World War II, the Hungarian-Serb relations were low. [[Nazi Germany]], in accordance to its "[[Operation Punishment]]" plan, [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded Yugoslavia]], and subsequently, Axis Hungarian forces occupied Bačka. This region was annexed by Hungary, and it was settled by new Hungarian settlers, at which time number of Hungarians in the area grew considerably, while in the same time many Serbs were expelled from Bačka. The brutal conduct of the Axis Hungarian occupying forces, including the Hungarian army and [[Hungarian_Royal_Gendarme_Veterans'_Association#The_Roots_of_the_MKCsBK:_The_Hungarian_Royal_Gendarmerie|Royal Hungarian Gendarmes]], has polarized both Hungarian and Serb communities. Under the Axis Hungarian authority, 19,573 people were killed in Bačka, of which the majority of victims were of Serb, [[History of the Jews in Serbia|Jewish]] and [[Romani people|Romani]] origin.

Although part of the local Hungarian population supported Hungarian Axis authorities, many other local Hungarians opposed Axis rule and fought against it together with Serbs and other peoples of Vojvodina in the [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisan resistance movement]] organized by the [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia|Communist Party]]. In some places of Vojvodina ([[Bačka Topola]], [[Senta]]), most of the members of the communist party were ethnic Hungarians. In [[Subotica]], the party secretary and most of the leadership were either ethnic Hungarians or Hungarian-speaking Jews. In the Bačka Topola municipality, 95% of communists were ethnic Hungarians. One of the leaders of the partisan resistance movement in Vojvodina was [[Erne Kiš]], ethnic Hungarian, who was captured by the Axis authorities, sentenced to death by the court in [[Szeged]] and executed.

Among the other actions of the resistance movement, the first [[corn stack]]s were burned near [[Futog]] by five communists, of whom two were ethnic Hungarians – brothers [[Antal Nemet]] and [[Đerđ Nemet]]. Antal was killed there, together with his Serb comrade, in the fighting against gendarmes, while his brother was captured and killed in Novi Sad because he refused to reveal any information about resistance movement. The corn stacks were soon also burned near Subotica. The communists that burned these corn stacks were arrested, tortured and sent to court. Two of them were sentenced to death ([[Ferenc Hegediš]] and [[Jožef Liht]]), while five other were sentenced to prison (because they were not adult).

The Axis authorities also arrested sizable number of Hungarian communists in Bačka Topola, Čantavir, Senta, Subotica and Novi Sad. Many of them were sent to the investigation centre in Bačka Topola, where part of them was killed, while some committed suicide. Among those Hungarian communists who were sent to the centre were [[Otmar Majer]], [[Đula Varga]], [[Pal Karas]] and [[Janoš Koči]]. Because of the size of the communist movement among Hungarians, new investigation centres were opened in Čantavir, Senta, Ada and Subotica. In the investigation centre in Subotica, almost 1,000 people were tortured, and part of them killed, among whom were [[Maćaš Vuković]] and [[Daniel Sabo]]. Among those communists sentenced to death were Otmar Majer, [[Rokuš Šimoković]] and [[Ištvan Lukač]] from Subotica, [[Peter Molnar (communist)|Peter Molnar]] from Senta, as well as Đula Varga, [[Rudi Klaus]], Pal Karas and Janoš Koči from Novi Sad. In [[Bačko Petrovo Selo|Petrovo Selo]], [[Mihalj Šamu]] was killed during his attempt to escape. These actions of the Axis authorities were a hard strike on the resistance movement in Bačka, especially on its Hungarian component. The Hungarian component of the resistance movement was struck so hard that it could not recover until the end of the war.

In 1944, the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Red Army]] and the Yugoslav partisan] took control of Vojvodina, and new communist authorities initiated purges against one part of local population that either collaborated with the [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis]] authorities or was viewed as a threat to the new regime (see: [[Communist purges in Serbia in 1944–1945]]). During this time, Partisans brutally massacred about 40,000 Hungarian civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hungarianhistory.com/lib/cseres/cseres01.htm|title=Tibor Cseres: Serbian Vendetta in Bacska|publisher=|accessdate=24 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1944 3,000 inhabitants of Hungarian nationality in Srbobran were executed by the Serbian communist partisans from the village of 18,000 inhabitants.

In Bečej killing of the Hungarians began on 9 October 1944. In the city of Sombor in October 1944 the murdering of the Hungarians started at once on the basis of the death-list previously made. The Hungarians were taken to the Palace of Kronich. Next to the race-course the common graves were dug in which 2,500 Hungarians were buried. Several other common graves can be found in the outside districts of the city. The inhabitants of the Hungarian city were fully exterminated. In total 5,650 Hungarians were executed. A Soviet officer in [[Temerin]] prevented the extirpation of the whole Hungarian population of the village. Hungarian human loss of the village was 480 people. During the first week about 1500 Hungarians were shot down into the [[Danube]] in [[Novi Sad]] under the leadership of [[Todor Gavrilović]]. On 3 November 1944 in [[Bezdan]] Hungarian male inhabitants of the village in the age of between l6 and 5O years were driven to a sports ground. 118 men were shot down by machine pistol to the Danube. 2830 Serbian communist partisans who made the murder belonged to the udarna brigade No. 12 in the division No. 51. It is strange but the [[Red Army|Soviet officers]] were also horrified at the massacre because they were who stopped further executions. On 3 December 1944 56 Hungarian citizens were executed on the bank of the [[Tisza]] river in [[Adorjan]]. In [[Žabalj]] 2,000 Hungarian citizens were killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hunsor.se/freezingweeks/frmassacre.html|title=HUNSOR ~Vajdaság - "The freezing weeks" of 1944|publisher=|accessdate=24 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.valtozast.hu/web/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=101|title=Változást - Hegedűs Antal:  A bácskai vérengzések 1944 őszén|first=|last=Administrator|publisher=|accessdate=24 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In [[Subotica]] during the 1944-45 period about 8,000 citizens (mainly Hungarian) were killed by [[Yugoslav Partisans]] as retribution for supporting Hungary re-taking the city. At the end of war detachments of Serbian Partisans occupied [[Čurug]] and murdered 3000 local ethnic Hungarian residents. The surviving ethnic Hungarian residents of the village were deported to detention camps and were never allowed to return. Ethnic Hungarians Germans were declared to be collaborators or exploiters. Those suspected of not supporting the emerging [[Communist regime]] or who belonged to a "wrong" ethnic group were the targets of persecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.budapesttelegraph.com/news/395/early_signs_of_reconciliation_in_hungary%E2%80%99s_relations_with_serbia__slovakia_and_romania|title=Budapesttelegraph.com - Budapest Telegraph News from Hungary|first=Project|last=029|publisher=|accessdate=24 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===After World War II===

Ever since the end of the Second World War, the Hungarian population has been steadily declining, mainly due to low birthrates and emigration. In 1974, the Yugoslav constitution was modified giving Vojvodina a very high level of autonomy and local Hungarians participated in Vojvodinian provincial administration. The Hungarians were also given the opportunity to keep their culture and language alive; they had their own schools and cultural institutions. During the reign of [[Josip Broz Tito]], life in Vojvodina was peaceful for Hungarians as well as for others. The socialist regime heavily cracked down upon nationalist flareups.

As the [[Yugoslav Wars]] of the 1990s were raging, more Hungarians left Vojvodina. One of the reasons for this emigration was the ruined economy of the country and inability for employment, which was the reason why many Serbs as well as others also emigrated from Vojvodina. Although the province was peaceful and calm compared to other areas of Yugoslavia, some Hungarians felt threatened, especially because Vojvodina was near the front lines, during the [[Croatian War of Independence|War in Croatia]]. With an emigration of Hungarians from Vojvodina, one part of their former houses was used for resettlement of refugees from other parts of former Yugoslavia. This created a change of the ethnic structure in some parts of the region. The Hungarian population has fallen from 340,946 (16.9%) in 1991, to 290,207 (14.28%) in 2002. In recent years (mostly in 2004 and 2005), some members of the ethnic Hungarian community have sometimes been the targets of anti-Hungarian sentiment.

Today, many Hungarians in Vojvodina want their political rights to be extended. Some local Hungarian politicians proposing the creation of new autonomous region in northern part of Vojvodina inhabited mainly by Hungarians (see: [[Hungarian Regional Autonomy]]). They also want to attain Hungarian citizenship, without being Hungarian residents, as this would automatically make them [[European Union|EU]] citizens, giving many benefits. However, a referendum on this issue in Hungary failed.&lt;!-- needs updating. dual citizenship attainable now. --&gt; The political future of Vojvodinian Hungarians is uncertain, as their community is characterized by low birthrates and a dwindling population – according to some demographic predictions, Hungarians of Vojvodina will probably lost ethnic majority/plurality in some municipalities and sizable towns, but they will certainly remain in majority in others. Thus, while Hungarians will remain notable ethnic group in northern part of Vojvodina, partial demographic changes in the area will probably reduce demands of local Hungarian politicians for territorial autonomy or at least for wide territorial extension of the proposed Hungarian autonomous region.

Almost all Hungarians in Serbia are to be found in [[Vojvodina]], and especially in its northern part ([[North Bačka]] and [[North Banat]] districts, respectively) where majority (57.17%) of them live.&lt;ref name=pop2011 /&gt; Hungarians in the five municipalities form the absolute majority: [[Kanjiža]] (85.13%), [[Senta]] (79.09%), [[Ada, Serbia|Ada]] (75.04%), [[Bačka Topola]] (57.94%), and [[Mali Iđoš]] (53.91%). The ethnically mixed municipalities with relative Hungarian majority are [[Čoka]] (49.66%), [[Bečej]] (46.34%) and [[Subotica]] (35.65%). The multiethnic city of Subotica is a cultural and political centre for the Hungarians in Serbia. Protestant Hungarians form the plurality or majority of population in the settlements of [[Stara Moravica]], [[Pačir]], [[Feketić]], [[Novi Itebej]] and [[Debeljača]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2558">'''Hyman Larner''' (November 4, 1913 – October 12, 2002) was an American [[gangster]] associated with [[Sam Giancana]] and the [[Chicago Outfit]]. Known in the newspapers as  "the Ivy League Mobster", he was the head of the Chicago Outfit's [[slot machine]] racket.&lt;ref name="Harvnb1"&gt;{{Harvnb | Giancana | 2004 | pp=31–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Larner, who was [[Jewish]], kept a low profile but was very powerful with the Chicago underworld. After [[Eddie Vogel]] retired from the gambling machine business, Larner became the power behind the scenes.&lt;ref name="Harvnb3"&gt;{{Harvnb | Giancana | 2004 | p=178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When he testified before the [[United States Senate Select Committee on Improper Activities in Labor and Management|U.S. Senate Select Committee on Improper Activities in Labor and Management]] in 1959, he invoked his [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] rights fifty-four times.&lt;ref name="Harvnb1"/&gt;

Larner expanded the Outfit's gambling and smuggling operations to Latin America, moving the organization's Miami operation to Latin America, headquartering in [[Panama]], where [[money laundering]] was more easily facilitated by local banks. These operations were conducted as a partnership between the Mafia and the [[CIA]]. By 1966, this partnership had developed into [[arms smuggling]] to the [[Middle East]] for the Israeli [[Mossad]], all via Panama.&lt;ref name="Harvnb2"&gt;{{Harvnb | Giancana | 2004 | pp=113–115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Larner had friends among world leaders and key players in the Central Intelligence Agency and the [[U.S. military]], and he was also well connected with [[Las Vegas]] bosses like the [[Teamsters]]' [[Allen Dorfman]] and media mogul [[Hank Greenspun]]. One of Larner's closest friends was [[Meyer Lansky]], and the two shared in their passionate [[Zionism]] and defense for the Jews' divine right to the land of Israel.&lt;ref name="Harvnb2"/&gt;

'''Indians in Peru''' form a tiny minority in the country and are one of the smaller populations of the Indian diaspora. According to the [[Indian Ministry of External Affairs]], there were about 500 Indians living in [[Peru]] as of December 2016.&lt;ref name = "MEA"&gt;{{cite web|title=India - Peru Relations|url=https://mea.gov.in/Portal/ForeignRelation/India_Peru_December_2016.pdf|website=Ministry of External Affairs|accessdate=7 January 2017|date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first immigrants from India to have arrived in Peru were businessmen who had gone there in the early 1960s. Later on, the community grew in number marginally until the early 80s, after which many of its members left due to the severe local economic crises and the prevailing terrorism. Those with relatives in other [[Latin America]]n countries joined them. In recent years, the size of the community has remained stable.

There is also a small number of expatriate professionals from India in the country and a few of them have obtained Peruvian citizenship – not more than 10 out of a total number of almost forty persons.

==Culture==
While a few Indian cultural activities are organized, in general, the Indian community in Peru maintained a low profile. Due to the vast distance that separates the community from India, the interest in their country of origin is limited to major events, mainly derived from occasional browsing on the internet. But being invariably first generation migrants, many of them do occasionally visit India.

Most of them speak only their mother tongue and [[Spanish language|Spanish]], with a smattering of [[English language|English]].

[[File:Guarani shaman.JPG|thumb|[[Guaraní people|Guaraní]] holding [[maraca]] and cross, [[Paraguay]], 2006]]The '''indigenous peoples of South America''' are the [[Pre-Columbian era|Pre-Columbian]] peoples of [[South America]] and their descendants. These peoples contrast with South Americans of European ancestry.

In Spanish, indigenous people are often referred to as ''indígenas'' or ''pueblos indígenas'' (lit. indigenous peoples). They may also be called ''pueblos nativos'' or ''nativos'' (lit. native peoples). The term ''aborigen'' (lit. aborigine) is used in [[Argentina]], and ''pueblos aborígenes'' (lit. aboriginal peoples) is commonly used in [[Chile]]. The English term "Amerindian" (short for "Indians of the Americas") is often used in [[the Guianas]]. People of mixed European and indigenous descent are usually referred to as [[Mestizo|mestizos]].

It is believed that the first human populations of South America either arrived from [[Asia]] into [[North America]] via the [[Bering Land Bridge]], and migrated southwards or alternatively from [[Polynesia]] across the Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cyberwest.com/v9scwst1/|title=Study confirms Bering land bridge flooded later than previously believed|website=cyberwest.com|language=English|access-date=2017-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=|title=Gongora et al. 2008|url=|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jps.auckland.ac.nz/document/?wid=1242|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest generally accepted archaeological evidence for human habitation in South America dates to 14,000 years ago, the [[Monte Verde]] site in Southern [[Chile]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hey|first=Jody|date=2005-05-24|title=On the Number of New World Founders: A Population Genetic Portrait of the Peopling of the Americas|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0030193|journal=PLOS Biology|volume=3|issue=6|pages=e193|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0030193|issn=1545-7885| pmc=1131883 |pmid=15898833}}&lt;/ref&gt; The descendents of these first inhabitants would become the indigenous populations of South America.

Before the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]], many of the indigenous peoples of South America were [[hunter-gatherer]]s, and indeed many still are, especially in the [[Amazon rainforest|Amazonian area]]. Others, especially the [[Inca Empire|Andean cultures]], practised sophisticated [[agriculture]], utilized [[Irrigation|advanced irrigation]] and kept [[Domestication|domesticated livestock]], such as [[llama]]s and [[alpaca]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://macareo.pucp.edu.pe/~jearls/documentosPDF/theCharacter.PDF|title=The Character of Inca and Andean Agriculture|last=Earls|first=John|date=|website=|access-date=22 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oas.org/dsd/publications/Unit/oea59e/ch27.htm|title=4.1 Raised beds and waru waru cultivation|website=www.oas.org|access-date=2017-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rlc.fao.org/es/tierra/pdf/capta/siste5.pdf |title=AGRICULTURA DE LADERAS A TRAVÉS DE ANDENES, PERÚ |last=Pinedo |first=Javier Blossiers |date= |website= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101214103311/http://www.rlc.fao.org/es/tierra/pdf/capta/siste5.pdf |archive-date=14 December 2010 |dead-url=bot: unknown |access-date=22 February 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the period after the initial arrival of Europeans in 1492 the indigenous population of South America fell rapidly due to a variety of factors, such as [[epidemic|disease]] and [[war]]fare.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2011/12/111205-native-americans-europeans-population-dna-genetics-science/|title=Massive Population Drop Found for Native Americans, DNA Shows|date=2011-12-05|access-date=2017-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Irish Mexicans''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Irlandés-mexicano'' or ''Hibernomexicano''; [[Irish language|Irish]]: ''Gael-Meicsiceach'') are inhabitants of [[Mexico]] that are immigrants from or descendants of immigrants from [[Ireland]]. The majority of Irish immigrants to Mexico were Catholic.

==History==
[[File:IrishSoldiersChurubuscoDF.JPG|thumb|upright|Tribute to the Irish soldiers who switched sides during the Mexican–American War at the [[Museo Nacional de las Intervenciones]]]]
During the colonial era a few ethnic Irish entered Mexico. Notable among them were Governor of Yucatán and Texas [[Hugo Oconór]] and the last Viceroy of New Spain, [[Juan O'Donojú]].

A few Mexican Irish communities existed in [[Mexican Texas]] until the [[Texas Revolution]]. Many Irish then sided with Catholic Mexico against Protestant pro-U.S. elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2010/jun/17/world-cup-france-mexico-ireland |location=London |work=The Guardian |title=World Cup 2010: France are the common enemy for Mexico and Ireland |first=Tom |last=Marshall |date=2010-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Saint Patrick's Battalion|Batallón de San Patricio]]'' was a largely (ethnically) Irish battalion of U.S. troops who deserted and fought alongside the [[Mexican Army]] against the United States in the [[Mexican–American War]] of 1846 to 1848.&lt;ref&gt;Coogan page 609&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, Irish immigrants or Americans left from [[California]] (the Irish Confederate army of [[Fort Yuma]], [[Arizona]] during the [[American Civil War]] in 1861) and blended into Mexican society instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.the-tidings.com/2006/0317/irish.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091008114525/http://www.the-tidings.com/2006/0317/irish.htm |archivedate=2009-10-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Jockey Club de Paris''' is a traditional [[gentlemen's club]] and is regarded as one of the most prestigious private clubs in [[Paris]]. It is best remembered as a gathering place of the elite of nineteenth-century French society. The club still exists at 2 rue Rabelais in Paris, and it hosts the International Federation of Racing Authorities.

==History==

The Jockey Club was originally organized as the "Society for the Encouragement of the Improvement of Horse Breeding in France", to provide a single authority for [[horse racing]] in the nation, beginning at [[Chantilly, Oise|Chantilly]] in 1834. It swiftly became the center for the most ''sportifs'' gentlemen of ''le tout-Paris.'' At the same time, when aristocrats and men of the ''[[Bourgeoisie|haute bourgeoisie]]'' still formed the governing class, its Anglo-Gallic membership could not fail to give it some political colour: [[Napoleon III]], who had passed some early exile in England, asserted that he had learned to govern an [[French Second Empire|empire]] through "his intercourse with the calm, self-possessed men of the English turf".&lt;ref&gt;A.F. Kinglake, ''The Invasion of the Crimea'', 1863, ch. xiv, quoted in Gordon N. Ray, "Thackeray's 'Book of Snobs'", ''Nineteenth-Century Fiction'' '''10'''.1 (June 1955:22-33) p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1833 and 1860, the Jockey Club transformed the [[Champ de Mars]] into a racecourse, which has since been transferred to [[Longchamp Racecourse|Longchamp]]. One front of the [[Café de la Paix]] is in rue Scribe, which ends at the façade of the [[Opéra Garnier]]. On the wall is a memorial plaque on the Hotel Scribe, at number 1, which records the former premises of the Jockey Club, which occupied luxurious quarters on the first floor from 1863 to 1913.

During the [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]] and the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]], the gentlemen of the Jockey Club held numerous boxes at the Opera ("many little suspended [[Salon (gathering)|salons]]" in [[Marcel Proust]]'s phrase), where the required ballet expected in every opera was never in the first act, when the Jockey Club would habitually still be at dinner. One result was the famous fiasco of the "Paris ''[[Tannhäuser (opera)|Tannhäuser]]''" of 1861, when [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]] insisted on inserting the requisite ballet into the first act. The second act, when the members of the Jockey Club arrived to view their favourites in the [[corps de ballet]], was all but hissed off the stage. Wagner never permitted another production in Paris. Proust made his fictional character [[In Search of Lost Time|Charles Swann]] a member of the Jockey Club as a signal honor, given Swann's Jewish background.

On the ground floor beneath the Jockey Club was the fashionable Grand Café. There, on 28 December 1895, a stylish crowd in the ''Salon Indien'' attended the public début of the [[Lumière brothers]]' invention, the [[cinematograph]].

The Jockey Club is directed by an annually-elected committee of a president, four vice-presidents and twenty-five members. New members are sponsored by two current members and must receive five-sixths of the members' votes.

==Prix du Jockey Club==

Under the patronage of the Jockey Club, the ''[[Prix du Jockey Club]]'' (1,500,000 euros) has been run at the [[Chantilly Racecourse]] (at the foot of the [[Château de Chantilly]]) on the first Sunday in June since 1836. The race at the ''Hippodrome de Chantilly'' is the proving-ground of the best of the three-year-olds, the French equivalent of [[Epsom Derby|The Derby]] at [[Epsom Downs Racecourse|Epsom Downs]] or the [[Kentucky Derby]] in the USA.

Until 2004, the course was 2400 meters; since then, it has been run at 2100 meters. In France, only the ''[[Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe]]'' has a richer purse (1,600,000 euros); that race was inaugurated by the Jockey Club in 1863 as the Grand Prix de Paris, and run at the [[Hippodrome de Longchamp]]. The racecourse was painted by [[Édouard Manet]], [[Edgar Degas]], and [[Pablo Picasso]], among others.

The '''Mamprusi''', or '''Mamprussi''', are an ethnic group of northern [[Ghana]] and [[Togo]]. There are some 220,000 Mamprusi living in Ghana&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xJQuAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT590&amp;dq=mamprusi+people&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiQhvf3ifHWAhUBzBoKHUjECXsQ6AEILTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=mamprusi%20people&amp;f=false|title=Encyclopedia of African Peoples|last=Group|first=The Diagram|date=2013-11-26|publisher=Routledge|year=|isbn=9781135963415|location=|pages=590|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and approximately 11,000 in Togo. They speak [[Mampruli]], a [[Gur language]]. In Ghana, the Mamprusis live mainly in [[Nalerigu]] and [[Gambaga]] in the northwest of the [[Northern Region (Ghana)|Northern Region]] but also inhabit parts of the [[Upper East Region]].

The Mamprusi Kingdom was founded around the 16th century by the Great Naa Gbanwah/Gbewah&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IWcYPAzVzRwC&amp;pg=PA125&amp;dq=mamprusi+Gbewah&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwil_PupivHWAhWFDxoKHaf3DkMQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=mamprusi%20Gbewah&amp;f=false|title=The Study of the State|last=Claessen|first=H. J. M.|last2=Skalník|first2=Peter|date=1981|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=9789027933485|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; at Pusiga, a village 14 kilometres from [[Bawku]]. The Kingdom spans most of the Northern and the Upper East Regions of Ghana, and into [[Burkina Faso]]. As a consequence, the King of [[Mossi people|Mossi]] to this day is ''enskinned'' by the Nayiri – the king of Mamprugu. Thus, establishing this kingdom as the pre-eminent of its kind, and the only kingdom in present-day Ghana whose relevance and authority cuts across national boundaries on the weight of its humble supremacy. The name of the kingdom is [[Mamprugu]], the ethnicity is Mamprusi, and the language is Mampruli.

Mamprusis revere the hallowed grounds of Bawku as their ancestral home, their origin. That is why Naa Gbewah's tomb in [[Pusiga]], is a shrine of repute to this day. It is believed that his disappearance was subteraneal, one of the marvels of Northern Ghana, and many ethnicities hold to agree with this uncommon historical account. It was after his death that his children moved farther afield and founded other kingdoms, namely: [[Dagbon]] and Namum.

Note that the name Naa Gbanwah and Gbewah can be used interchangeably, the difference being that Mamprusis refer to him as gbanwah and dagombas refer to him as gbewah. It is just a difference in pronunciations.

The people of Mamprusi were led by a great warrior Tohazie "''the Red Hunter". During the migration Tohazie died and his grandson Na-Gbewa succeeded him. Na-Gbewa died and he was succeeded by his oldest son Wiliri.

'''The Mask and Wig Club''', a [[gentlemen's club|private club]] in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], founded in 1889, is the oldest all-male collegiate musical comedy troupe in the [[United States]]. Created as an alternative to the existing theatrical and dramatic outlets at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], Mask and Wig has presented comedy, music, and dancing to the University of Pennsylvania, [[Philadelphia]], and audiences across the country. Its credo is "Justice to the stage; credit to the University."&lt;ref name="scribd.com"/&gt;

The club's performers, or "The Cast," put on two all-original shows each year in collaboration with the Club's own Stage Crew, Band, and Business Staff. Many Mask and Wig originals were made famous on the radio by mid 20th century luminaries. The well-known "Route 66" was composed by club member [[Bobby Troup]]&lt;ref&gt;http://media.www.dailypennsylvanian.com/media/storage/paper882/news/1994/02/24/Resources/Still.Laughing-2180040.shtml{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }},&lt;/ref&gt; and launched to the height of popularity by [[Frank Sinatra]]. Troup's song "Daddy" was written for a Mask and Wig show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://secondhandsongs.com/work/60718|title=Original versions of Daddy written by Bobby Troup -  SecondHandSongs|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Mask and Wig songs, such as "[[The Gypsy in My Soul]]," written by [[Clay Boland]] and [[Moe Jaffe]], have been performed by the likes of [[Benny Goodman]], [[Tommy Dorsey]], and [[Ella Fitzgerald]].  The first electrically recorded album ever released was Mask and Wig's "Joan of Arkansas," in April 1925.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://philadelphiaencyclopedia.org/archive/recording-industry/|title=Recording Industry - Encyclopedia of Greater Philadelphia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Mask and Wig Club of the [[University of Pennsylvania]] was first conceived of in 1888 by a small group of undergraduates, led by Clayton Fotterall McMichael, who were interested in the stage and desired something the University did not offer: a troupe that would produce original humorous theatrical pieces.&lt;ref name="scribd.com"/&gt; In 1889, therefore, McMichael and the other original founders sent out a call for undergraduate men to audition for the group and participate in the creation and production of its first performance.&lt;ref name="scribd.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/2908635/Some-Fifty-Odd-Years-of-The-Mask-and-Wig-Club-1889-1941|title=Some Fifty Odd Years of The Mask and Wig Club (1889-1941)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McMichael and his peers envisioned a group that involved dressing up in frocks and performing spoofs and parodies.  Because colleges at the time were open only to young gentlemen, any production was limited to an all–male cast. These organizations naturally saw burlesque, which was quite popular in that era, as the perfect genre. The overblown characterizations, loose plotting, musical interludes, and parody of high art made the style perfect for a group of young, well-educated, amateur men, especially since the drag tradition came "built-in".&lt;ref name="scribd.com"/&gt;

Founder McMichael combed the local bookstores for a story to produce and found it in Henry Byron's The Nymphs of the Lurleyburg. A substantially altered version, "Lurline", the Club's first production, hit the boards at the Chestnut Street Opera House on June 4, 1889, for one night only. Backed financially by the ladies of Philadelphia high society, the Club enjoyed great success in its early years. With increasingly reliable audience turnout and revenue from ticket sales, the runs were extended and the Club established a fine tradition among Philadelphia's theater–going society.  Moreover, the club made a very strong impression on campus and it achieved great notoriety within its first year of existence.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.archives.upenn.edu/primdocs/upm/upm7100/1890record.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mask and Wig rehearsal (1930).jpg|thumb|200px|left|Company members rehearsing at the clubhouse in 1930.]]
In 1894 the Club purchased a property at 310 South Quince Street to serve as a gathering place and rehearsal hall, [[the Mask and Wig Clubhouse]].  The building had been erected by the first African-American Lutheran congregation in America as St. Paul's Lutheran Church in 1834, but had been sold in 1839&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.philly.com/1998-02-22/news/25754844_1_storefront-church-evangelical-lutheran-church-pastor-jones|title=Archives - Philly.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and converted into a coachhouse and stable, and later into a dissecting room for medical students. Prominent Philadelphia architect [[Wilson Eyre]] was commissioned to remodel the building, and hired the young [[Maxfield Parrish]], who would later become one of the greatest illustrators of the 20th century, to decorate the interior. The Grille Room was decorated with caricatures of members, a tradition that continues today, with the second century of members' caricatures continued upstairs at the entrance to the auditorium. Eyre expanded the clubhouse to its present size, 1901-1903.

The Club prospered throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The middle of this century was a heady time for the Club.  Mask and Wig songs were the rage of the big band orchestras, radio shows, and solo acts of the day. The likes of [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Glenn Miller]], [[Tommy Dorsey]], [[Benny Goodman]], [[Count Basie]], [[Rosemary Clooney]], and [[Les Brown (bandleader)|Les Brown]] all covered Mask and Wig tunes. Between 1952 and 1958, the club appeared four times on [[The Ed Sullivan Show]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0040053/fullcredits#cast|title=The Ed Sullivan Show|date=20 June 1948|publisher=|via=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 1961 production, ''Wry on the Rocks'', introduced a satirical revue format in a cabaret atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;http://archive.maskandwig.com/Annual%20Productions/1961%20Wry%20on%20the%20Rocks/Wry%20on%20the%20Rocks%20-%20Program.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, with ''Myth America'', Mask and Wig returned the student–written book musical to its stage, a practice which continues to this day.&lt;ref&gt;http://archive.maskandwig.com/Annual%20Productions/1992%20Myth%20America/Myth%20America%20-%20Progam.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Important in the show's success are the traditional high standards in the caliber of performers and excellence of the material performed. The Club's primary purpose has always been and continues to be, "Justice to the stage; credit to the University."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maskandwig.com/about/|title=About - The Mask and Wig Club|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately after the end of World War II the Mask and Wig dormitory on the residence quadrangle was used to house a U.S. Army unit assigned to quickly learn the Japanese language.  Upon the completion of the study the soldiers were to be commissioned in the U.S. Army and serve in the Counterintelligence Corps (CIC) of the Army in Japan.  This army unit had classes in the University in the Egyptian Antiquities room while being scrutinized by several mummies.  Classes were also held in the Wharton School of Business.  Jerry Epple, a member of the [[Army Specialized Training Program]], says he remembers to this day the stone carving of a mask and wig near the dormitory entrance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astpww2.org/main/memoirs_2.htm|title=生理前のオリモノが白いのは異常ですか？意外と知らないオリモノについて|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305040708/http://www.astpww2.org/main/memoirs_2.htm|archivedate=2016-03-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, Mask and Wig maintains its position as one of the premier extracurricular activities on the Penn campus. Its yearly tour over spring break brings the show to alumni clubs across the nation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.maskandwig.com/about/tour/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
===Club organization===
The Mask and Wig Club has two components: the Undergraduate Company and the Graduate Club.  The Undergraduate Company is composed of current undergrads at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], who are the performers in and creators of each year's productions.  They are the public face of the organization.

The Graduate Club is composed of Mask and Wig Alumni. The Graduate Club is responsible for many of the decisions that guide the Undergraduate Club, including overseeing many aspects of the production of the Spring Show, and the maintenance of the Clubhouse. They provide much of the funding for the maintenance of the Clubhouse and were responsible for raising the funds for its renovation. The Graduate Club and the Undergraduate Club interface through regular Board of Governors meetings, which feature both Undergraduate and Graduate club members.

===Undergraduate sections===
The Mask and Wig Club is made up of four distinct sections: the cast, the band, the crew, and the business staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Perücke – so alt wie die Zivilisation|url=http://www.perücke.biz/peruecke-so-alt-wie-die-zivilisation/|website=Perücke.biz|language=de-DE}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cast writes and performs all of its own material during the Fall and Spring Shows.  The band often functions as a pit orchestra, playing original, self-arranged pieces for the Fall show, and professionally arranged pieces for the Spring production.  The band also holds the headliner spot at the [[University of Pennsylvania]]'s annual Spring Fling festival in the Quad. The crew builds elaborate, ornate, and completely original sets for both the Fall and Spring Shows.  The business staff is responsible for advertising and selling tickets for the club's shows.

===Current graduate leadership===

Vice-President: David E. Simon '86

Secretary: Jonathan F. Kruse '09

==Performances==

===Free Show===
Free Show is the first Mask and Wig show of the academic year.  The show is held during the first week of the academic year and is free of charge to all new freshmen. The cast performs classic bits that are tried and true. Free Show serves a few purposes: it introduces the new freshmen of the [[University of Pennsylvania]] to one of Penn's oldest institutions, and hopes to recruit new members by displaying what membership in the group entails. In 2018, for the first time the Free Show was performed in collaboration with Penn's all-female musical sketch comedy troupe, Bloomers.

===Fall Show===
Each fall, the undergraduates produce their own sketch comedy show that runs for one week in a theater on Penn's campus.  The upperclassmen handle all aspects of production from acting direction to choreography to musical production.  A notable highlight of the show is the Second Act Opener, which consists of a medley of songs from a famous musician or group, but with parodied lyrics that often follow a Penn-centered plot. Past parodied musicians include [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Michael Jackson]], [[Billy Joel]], [[The Beatles]], [[Aerosmith]], [[Disney]], and [[Queen (band)|Queen]].

===ComFest===
In 1999, Mask and Wig established an annual Intercollegiate Comedy Festival to showcase the talent of the nation's best collegiate sketch comedy troupes. The mission of the festival is not just to put on a hilarious show that cultivates new talent, but also to honor and showcase a well-known comedian. Each host does a stand-up routine for the audience and participates in sketches with Mask and Wig.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.maskandwig.org/comfest/history.html{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Past college sketch troupes include:
*[[Princeton Triangle Club]]
*University of Maryland Sketchup
*Yale Fifth Humour
*Boston College Hello Shovelhead
*Cornell University Humor Us! Sketch Comedy

Past guest hosts include:
*2000 [[Paul Provenza]]
*2001 [[Ana Gasteyer]]
*2002 [[Bob Saget]]

*2009 [[Judah Friedlander]]
*2010 [[Tom Green]]
*2011 [[Aasif Mandvi]]
*2012 [[Greg Proops]]
*2014 [[Tommy Pope]]

===Spring Show===
The Spring Show, historically known as the Annual Production, is the theatrical centerpiece of Mask and Wig.  Performed at [[The Mask and Wig Clubhouse]], the production is an original show that runs from late January to early April.  While the format of the Spring Show has evolved over the years, the show currently runs as a full "book" musical comedy, complete with singing and tap dancing.

Unlike the Fall Show, the Annual Production is professionally composed, directed, and choreographed by some of the best talents in the industry.  The script, however, is written by the Club's cast.

===Tour===
During spring break the troupe takes their show around the country as they road trip across the United States, usually performing in areas with a high Penn alumni concentration.  The trip usually includes about four to six stops.  In recent years the tour has taken Wig to cities like London, [[Los Angeles]], [[New York City]], [[San Francisco]], [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], [[Chicago]], and [[Toronto]].

The tour is yet another one of the group's many traditions.  In Mask and Wig's heyday, the group had its own train car that it would use to do a similar tour around the nation.

===Spring Fling===
The Mask and Wig Band traditionally headlines the last day of Spring Fling performances, which was historically a Saturday, at the stage in the Lower Quad. In 2018 the festival was moved to [[Penn Park]] along with the Mask and Wig performance.  They generally perform an hour-long set of covers of popular music.  Members of the cast generally sing for the band, along with female vocalists from other Penn performing arts groups.  The other members of the company join the band on stage for the duration of the performance, and the show concludes with the singing of the Mask and Wig hallmark musical number, Tradition, by the senior members of the company.

==The Clubhouse==
===Clubhouse art===
Working in his studio just a few blocks away at Thirteenth and Walnut Streets, [[Maxfield Parrish]] received one of his first commissions in 1894 from Mask and Wig.  This first job came as he was finishing his studies at the [[Pennsylvania Academy]]; it was for decoration of the stage [[proscenium]] and ticket window, illustration of a number of caricatures on the wall of the Grille Room, and most notably the [[Old King Cole]] mural.  This was the start of his professional career; shortly after seeing the mural, the editor of “Harper's” Magazine invited Parrish to do some of their covers for which he became famous.  He would continue working for the Club to finish a total of 35 caricatures and illustrate the earliest program covers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/LotDetailsPrintable.aspx?intObjectID=1077023|title=Christies - Page Not Found|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson Eyre was older and more established than Parrish when he began working on the Clubhouse, and was good friends with Parrish's father, [[Stephen Parrish|Stephen]].  Eyre was the architect in charge of renovating the Club's new home and transforming it from a stable into a “[[Bavaria]]n” themed Clubhouse.  His first remodel in 1894 transformed the space from the stable by adding an entry hall with stairs, designing and decorating the Grille Room, and turning the second floor into a theater.  Eyre designed most of the furniture in the Grille Room; three of the original tables still exist and will be returned to the Clubhouse upon its reopening.  Eyre also oversaw the second major change.  The building was enlarged in 1903 by adding 10 feet to the front creating the façade that still exists there today.  Eyre's original drawing of the front design, created in 1902, is shown to the right.  Eyre's design has endured for over a century with few changes aside from the ongoing addition of paneling for caricatures in the Grille Room and Theater.  Though Eyre's career included several projects like the Clubhouse, he is best known for his design of the [[University of Pennsylvania]]’s Museum.

===Clubhouse renovations===
Immediately following the close of the 2007 Spring show, the clubhouse began to undergo an extensive renovation.  In addition to bringing the building up to modern code, the club also installed an elevator and central air conditioning unit.  The construction, originally projected to be complete in time for a normal Spring show run, experienced a number of delays and setbacks.  On the morning of March 15, 2008, a fire broke out in the attic of the clubhouse, setting back the completion date indefinitely.  While nothing of historical significance was critically damaged, the 2008 Spring show, "West Wing Story", could not go on in the club's signature theater.

Luckily, the club had a contingency plan in case of such an emergency, and was able to put on their show.  "West Wing Story" played for two weekends in April, 2008 at the Prince Music Theater in downtown Philadelphia, marking the first annual production to be performed at a venue other than the clubhouse since 1960.  The generosity of Mask and Wig's Graduate Club made it financially possible to perform in a professional theater.  With renovations still behind schedule in 2009, the annual production "Oh, the Humanities!" was also performed at the Prince Music Theater for three weekends, selling a record number of tickets due to the large theater capacity.

The clubhouse renovation was completed in the fall of 2009, allowing the club to once again return to its own stage for the 2010 Annual Production, "A Cheshire Catastrophe".

'''Matthew Barnett Robinson''' (born 1970 in [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida|Fort Lauderdale]], [[Florida]]) is a [[Criminologist]] at [[Appalachian State University]] (ASU) in [[Boone, North Carolina]].

After receiving his PhD from the [[Florida State University]] School of Criminology &amp; Criminal Justice, he accepted a position as Assistant Professor in the Department of Political Science and Criminal Justice at ASU in 1997, and is now a Full Professor. This is now the Department of Government &amp; Justice Studies.

== Works ==
Dr. Robinson has published seventeen books in the areas of [[criminal justice]], [[crime mapping]], criminological theory, [[corporate crime]], media coverage of crime, the [[war on drugs]], and the [[death penalty]].  His books include ''Justice Blind? Ideals and Realities of American Criminal Justice'' (Prentice Hall, 2002, 2005, 2009), ''Why Crime? An Integrated Systems Theory of Antisocial Behavior'' (Prentice Hall, 2004), ''Why Crime? An Interdisciplinary Approach to Explaining Criminal Behavior'' (Carolina Academic Press, 2009), ''Spatial Aspects of Crime: Theory and Practice'' (Allyn &amp; Bacon, 2004), ''Crime Mapping and Spatial Aspects of Crime: Theory and Practice'' (Allyn &amp; Bacon, 2008),  ''Lies, Damn Lies, and Drug War Statistics'' (State University of New York Press, 2007, 2013), ''Death Nation: The Experts Explain American Capital Punishment'' (Prentice Hall, 2007), ''Greed is Good: Maximization and Elite Deviance in America'' (Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2008), ''Media Coverage of Crime and Criminal Justice'' (Carolina Academic Press, 2011, 2014), ''Crime Prevention: The Essentials'' (Bridgepoint Education, 2013), ''Criminal INjustice: How Politics and Ideology Distort American Ideals'' (Carolina Academic Press, 2014), ''Social Justice, Criminal Justice: The Role of American Law in Effecting and Preventing Social Change'' (Anderson, 2015), and "Race, Ethnicity, Crime, and Justice" (Carolina Academic Press, 2015).

In terms of the death penalty, Robinson's work in "Death Nation" illustrates what scholarly experts think of the [[death penalty in America]]. They overwhelmingly characterize the death penalty as a [[Capital punishment debate in the United States|failed policy]], and Robinson's review of the latest empirical evidence supports this conclusion. Professor Bohm responds to the book, noting: "Robinson makes a unique contribution to the death penalty debate by presenting the results from his study of 45 death penalty experts and their views on capital punishment.

Robinson's analysis is very thorough and reading the responses of the experts is fascinating ... It is reassuring to know that most people who have studied the death penalty for many years find it to be an archaic punishment not worthy of a modern, civilized society." Professor Ludowise notes: "The death penalty story is good and ... illuminating ... The author has provided a fair and balanced approach to the many facets of the capital punishment policy debated in the U.S." His work was also considered by officials in various states debating whether to continue to utilize the punishment.

Robinson also authored the report, "[[The Death Penalty in North Carolina: A Summary of the Data and Scientific Studies]]," which reviews all the studies conducted of the state's death penalty system. The report illustrates five important facts about the [[death penalty in North Carolina]], including that the [[List of people executed in North Carolina|death penalty is rare]], not a deterrent to murder, more costly than life imprisonment, racially biased, and a threat even to innocent people.

Robinson's work on the drug war has led to major challenges to federal drug control policy. He and co-author Renee Scherlen, were invited to Washington, DC to debate the top policy analyst/chief scientist at the [[Office of National Drug Control Policy]]. Professor Shelden reacted to the work with: "Robinson and Scherlen have provided a thorough critique of the claims made by those in charge of the drug war. This book will no doubt prove to be a valuable resource for those trying to make sense of a war that has created so much havoc within our society."

Incidentally, the first two chapters provide the reader with an excellent overview on the how the drug war came to be, including a brief history of anti-drug legislation. For those not familiar with this history, these chapters will provide much needed information to fill this gap. Read it, learn from it, use it." [[Ethan Nadelmann]], Executive Director of the [[Drug Policy Alliance]], reacts: "Robinson and Scherlen make a valuable contribution to documenting how the Office of National Drug Control Policy fails to live up to basic standards of accountability and consistency."

Professor Gray says: "Dr. Robinson and Dr. Scherlen have performed a valuable service to our democracy with their meticulous analysis of the White House [[ONDCP]] public statements and reports.  They have pulled the sheet off what appears to be an official policy of deception using clever and sometimes clumsy attempts at statistical manipulation.  This document, at last, gives us a map to the truth." Nora Callahan of the [[November Coalition]] says: "'LIES' is a thorough indictment of ONDCP.  Much of Robinson and Scherlen's analysis reads like prose, revealing the indignation of scientists exposing insidious lies, unaccountable policies and failed objectives -- all supported by federal tax dollars."

Former US Intelligence Analyst Brian Bennett claims: "[I]n a word it is magnificent.  While the book is quite thorough, it is also amazingly concise and easy to read ... an excellent job of completely deconstructing and debunking everything the ONDCP claims." [[Jack A. Cole|Jack Cole]], Executive Director of [[Law Enforcement Against Prohibition]], claims: "The authors systematically demonstrate empirically the many ways in which the ONDCP has lied over the past [7] years in its annual report of the war on drugs.  The authors' analysis clarifies the despicable actions of the ONDCP and greatly contributes to the arguments of drug policy reformers everywhere."

[[Paul Armentano]] of [[NORML]] says: "This is an impressive compendium.  I think it's especially effective when you rebuke the ONDCP's claim slide-per-slide.  Also, I'm glad you brought up the fact that the agency has recently restructured their budget numbers to give the impression that there is nearly equal funding for treatment vs interdiction." And Joseph White of Change the Climate claims: "... rather impressive -- very thorough ... I was especially interested in your use of "ideology" as a jumping off point for your critique.  As a philosophy student, I appreciate your pointing to the substance behind ONDCP's madness—i.e., it is all political based on the dominant culture's morality."

In the area of criminological theory, Robinson created the "integrated systems theory" of antisocial behavior which blames much criminality on a wide variety of factors that tend to occur together in space and time. Professor Art Jipson says it "illustrates both the psychological imagination and the gap where some classic criminology has failed. Professors Henry and Lanier refer to the theory as "the most ambitious, comprehensive interdisciplinary attempt so far to move integration of criminological theory to new heights." Professor Walsh calls the book "engaging, extremely well written," and notes that it makes "major contributions to criminology."

Walsh also says: "Robinson's book is a tour de force for the criminologist who wants to learn something about the biosocial perspective." Professor Schmalleger calls the work "among the best work being done in the area of theoretical integration today." Professor Barak says the theory is "consistent with … general criminogenic 'facts of crime' that have been associated with criminal behaviour … built around known risk factors that have been identified by scholars in numerous disciplines such as anthropology, behavioural genetics, biology, economics, neurology, psychology, and sociology … in true interdisciplinary fashion, the integrated systems theory incorporates propositions derived from genetics, brain structure, brain function, brain dysfunction, personality traits, intelligence levels, mental illness, diet and nutrition, drug consumption, family influences, peer influences, social disorganization, routine activities and victim lifestyles, deterrence, labelling, anomie, strain, culture conflict and subcultures, race, class, and gender … incorporates a developmental or life-course perspective … consistent with a growing literature on developmental criminology … in harmony with the empirical evidence."

The second edition, co-authored with [[Kevin Beaver]] of [[Florida State University]], is called by Professor DeLisi "a tour-de-force through the criminological literature.  Professors Robinson and Beaver have brilliantly explicated the interdisciplinary research on crime in a concise, fun-to-read text." And Professor Wright notes: "What Robinson and Beaver have achieved is striking.  Not only do they integrate a sound understanding of biology's role in criminal conduct into a broader biosocial paradigm, they do so in a way readers will find accessible if not inspiring.  This book will certainly draw the ire of some, but for serious students of crime it will force a reconsideration of cherished beliefs.  For this reason alone, Why Crime? makes a valuable contribution to the study of crime."

Robinson also co-authored the theory called "contextual anomie and strain theory" which attributes corporate criminality to greed in the corporate subculture. Professor Friedrichs notes: "In the midst of the present huge financial crisis, this book could hardly be more timely. The authors offer a novel theoretical framework for enriching our understanding of crimes of the rich and powerful. Matthew Robinson's previous books have been noteworthy additions to the criminological literature. In collaboration with colleague Daniel Murphy, he has once again made a thought-provoking contribution to the field, from which the current generation of students has much to learn."

Criminologist [[Richard Rosenfeld]] noted that the theory "is a faithful and 'innovative' application of arguments" he developed with criminologist Steven Messner. Messner noted: "This is great stuff" that has "elaborated anomie theory in an original and insightful manner."

Professor Robinson has also published about 100 other pieces of research and made more than 200 presentations to professional conferences in Criminology and Criminal Justice.  The common theme of Dr. Robinson's work is critical examination of the status quo – whether the [[criminal justice system]], the [[War on Drugs|war on drugs]] and the [[death penalty]] are effective and just.  Robinson critically analyzes widely accepted theories and practices and offers a new perspective that often conflicts with commonly held beliefs and assumptions.

Robinson joined the [[Bill of Rights Defense Committee]] and founded a group in [[Boone, North Carolina|Boone]] to speak out against provisions of the [[USA PATRIOT Act]].  The group successfully saw six resolutions passed, including one by the Town of Boone. The resolution condemned a handful of provisions of the law, several of which have subsequently been declared unconstitutional by courts. Robinson is now working on a Center for Social Justice and Human Rights at ASU to work toward defending the rights of all people, regardless of race, ethnicity, nationality, gender, religion, or sexual orientation.

Dr. Robinson is Past President of the North Carolina Criminal Justice Association and Past President of the Southern Criminal Justice Association. He has served on numerous boards pertaining to the rights of the [[mentally ill]], [[mediation]] and [[restorative justice]], as well as protecting [[civil liberties]].

'''''Metiochus and Parthenope''''' ({{lang-el|Μητίοχος καὶ Παρθενόπη}}, ''Mētiokhos kai Parthenopē'') is an [[Ancient Greek novel]] that, in a translation by the eleventh-century poet [[Unsuri|‘Unṣurī]], also became the Persian romance epic ''Vāmiq u ‘Adhrā'', and the basis for a wide range of stories about the 'lover and the virgin' in medieval and modern Islamicate cultures.

==Greek text==
''Metiochus and Parthenope'' is similar in style to [[Chariton]]'s ''[[Chaereas and Callirhoe]]'', from the first century BC or AD, and so is presumed to be equally old,&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Thomas Hägg, 'The Oriental Reception of Greek Novels: A Survey with Some Preliminary Considerations', ''Symbolae Osloenses'', 61 (1986), 99-131 (p. 106), DOI: 10.1080/00397678608590800 .&lt;/ref&gt; making it one of the first prose novels in the Western literary tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hägg and Bo Utas, ''The Virgin and her Lover: Fragments of an Ancient Greek Novel and a Persian Epic Poem'', Brill Studies in Middle Eastern Literatures, 30 (Leiden: Brill, 2003), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The text survives only in small fragments of papyrus from Egypt, but references in Greek literature of the Roman period, a Syrian moasic of c. 200 depicting the protagonists, and another from [[Zeugma, Commagene]], shows the story's continued importance during the Roman period.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hägg and Bo Utas, ''The Virgin and her Lover: Fragments of an Ancient Greek Novel and a Persian Epic Poem'', Brill Studies in Middle Eastern Literatures, 30 (Leiden: Brill, 2003), pp. 1-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Drawing on surviving sources, Hägg and Utan reconstruct the following plot. The story refers to historical figures, but is anachronistic and fundamentally fictional. Metiochus is the eldest son of [[Miltiades]]. However, his stepmother Hegesipyle plots against him in favour of her own children. So, along with his friend Theophanes, he flees his home (on the [[Thracian Chersonese]]), seeking the court of his distant relative [[Polycrates]] on [[Samos]]. There he meets Polycrates's daughter Parthenope at the temple of Hera. They fall instantly in love. Polycrates invites Metiochus to a [[symposium]], and the discussions on love at this event are the main surviving part of the Greek text.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hägg and Bo Utan, 'Eros Goes East: Parthenope the Virgin Meets Vāmiq the Ardent Lover', in ''Plotting with Eros: Essays on the Poetics of Love and the Erotics of Reading'', ed. by  Ingela Nilsson (Copenhagen: Museum Tusculanum Press, 2009), pp. 153-86 (pp. 155-56).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Persian text==
For centuries, it was known that  ‘Unṣurī had composed a poem called ''Vāmiq u ‘Adhrā'', but it was thought lost. In the 1950s, however, the Pakistani scholar Mohammad Shafi identified fragments of the text in the binding of a theological manuscript produced in [[Herat]] in [[Anno Hegirae|AH]] 526 (1132 AD),&lt;ref&gt;A. A. Seyed-Gohrab, ''Courtly Riddles: Enigmatic Embellishments in Early Persian Poetry'' (Leiden: Leiden University Press, 2010), p. 71 n. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; revealing 380 couplets (''abyāt'') of the poem. Another 151 couplets are quoted in Persian lexical works, some or all of which may come from this poem.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hägg and Bo Utas, ''The Virgin and her Lover: Fragments of an Ancient Greek Novel and a Persian Epic Poem'', Brill Studies in Middle Eastern Literatures, 30 (Leiden: Brill, 2003), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Vāmiq'' means 'the lover' and ''‘Adhrā'' means 'virgin' in Arabic (corresponding to the connotations of virginity in the name ''Parthenope'', from Greek ''parthenos'' 'young girl, virgin'), but many other names in ‘Unṣurī's text are transposed from the Greek, demonstrating derivation from ''Metiochus and Parthenope'', probably via an Arabic translation. In the tenth century, [[Ibn al-Nadim|Ibn al-Nadīm]] records that [[Sahl b. Hārūn]] (d. 830 AD), secretary to [[Al-Ma'mun|Caliph al-Ma'mūn]] in Baghdad, composed a work of the same title. This must derive from the Greek text, whether by direct translation or through an intermediary — conceivably even an earlier Persian translation. Meanwhile [[Al-Biruni|al-Bīrūnī]] (d. c. 1051) claimed to have translated an Arabic work of this name into [[New Persian]]. Al-Bīrūnī's text might, then, have been the source for  ‘Unṣurī's poem.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hägg, 'The Oriental Reception of Greek Novels: A Survey with Some Preliminary Considerations', ''Symbolae Osloenses'', 61 (1986), 99-131 (pp. 107-8), DOI: 10.1080/00397678608590800 .&lt;/ref&gt; 

By the fifteenth century, ''Vāmiq u ‘Adhrā'' had become proverbial names of lovers in the Persian world,&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hägg, 'The Oriental Reception of Greek Novels: A Survey with Some Preliminary Considerations', ''Symbolae Osloenses'', 61 (1986), 99-131 (p. 108), DOI: 10.1080/00397678608590800 .&lt;/ref&gt; and a huge number of stories about the 'lover and the virgin' circulated in Islamicate literature.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hägg and Bo Utas, ''The Virgin and her Lover: Fragments of an Ancient Greek Novel and a Persian Epic Poem'', Brill Studies in Middle Eastern Literatures, 30 (Leiden: Brill, 2003), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Murle''' are a [[Nilotic peoples|Nilotic]] ethnic group inhabiting the [[Pibor County]] and Boma area in [[Jonglei State]],  [[South Sudan]], as well as parts of southwestern [[Ethiopia]]. They have also been referred as ''Beir'' by the [[Dinka people|Dinka]] and as ''Jebe'' by the [[Luo people|Luo]] and [[Nuer people|Nuer]], among others. The Murle speak the [[Murle language]], which is part of the [[Surmic]] branch of the [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]] family. The language cluster includes some adjoining groups in [[Sudan]], as well as some non-contiguous Nilotic populations in southwestern Ethiopia.

== Culture ==
Murle in most cases practice a blend of animism and Christianity. Elders and witches often function as trouble fixers. But they are [[Pastoralism|pastoralists]] in a country where localized and unpredictable shortages occur in rain, drinking water, bush fruits and cattle grass. This necessitates a partly nomadic lifestyle over large distances. As a result, in times of shortages they have frequently come into conflict with numerically larger groups, including the [[Dinka people|Dinka]] and [[Nuer people|Nuer]]. 

The Murle (like the Dinka and Nuer) have a tradition in which men can only marry when they pay a bride wealth of several dozens of cows. Education and jobs are almost absent and there are very few possibilities to earn money by producing for domestic or foreign markets. As a result, the only way to acquire cows for marriage, quicker than through breeding them, is by stealing. With roads absent and normal policing almost impossible in a vast territory, Murle, Dinka and Nuer raid each other equally, unlike the more widespread notion by the Dinka and Nuer in the Government that only the Murle are the offenders.[no cite, and the contrary has been held true by at least one anthropologist who has studied the Murle]

The Murle have a historical traditional  of migrating over the years in a clockwise direction around [[Lake Turkana]] (Arensen 1983). In the 1930s, they negotiated small pockets of 'homeland' in Pibor, where they are always allowed to graze their cattle and grow crops, even when in conflict with neighbors. This homeland is far too small for their survival, so they have a common interest in maintaining peace with Dinka and Nuer so that they can graze their cattle over wider areas. But the small size of their homeland and the near absence of police protection make them very vulnerable when conflicts do occur. When doubts arise that there will be peace and sufficient water and grazing rights, survival instincts align with 'bride hunger', sometimes driving the young men into risky cattle rustling adventures against their larger neighbors.

In the north-south war since, the Murle were mainly underrepresented and neglected by the SPLA. They sought protection by forming an armed group to protect themselves from the former rebel SPLA and the Northern Sudanese Militias.

==Massacres==
{{main|South Sudan internal conflict (2011–present)}}
In most South-Sudanese cattle cultures, the bride-wealth system, and illegal taxing by some unscrupulous local leaders stimulates young men to find excuses to steal cows from their own cousins. Local leaders then sometimes try to quell or prevent intra-tribal fighting, by directing that aggression outward, to other tribes. Also, Murle are feared and seen by surrounding larger tribes as having strong magical powers, and therefore they are often blamed for outbreak of diseases, theft and arson. 

With the country still awash with machine guns from the [[Second Sudanese Civil War|north-south war]], 'cattle rustling' quickly runs out of control, killing dozens or hundreds of people in tit for tat escalations. Many Nuer reason that Murle are the grand children of immigrants with much less rights to use land and graze cattle. So Murle cattle, argue some Nuer, were raised on stolen grass, so most of their cattle actually belong to the Nuer. Many Murle elders argue that often if the Dinka and Nuer are facing hunger or drought, they sell their children to the Murle in exchange for cattle, then later report to the authorities that their children have been kidnapped by the Murle.

In December 2011, about 6,000 Nuer Youths Army marched on the remote town of Pibor in Jonglei state, home to the rival Murle people, burning homes and looting facilities after overtaking a small South Sudan Army unit. The Lou-Nuer blame the Murle for cattle raiding and have vowed to wipe out the entire Murle Tribe on the face of the Earth. An estimated 3,000 people were killed, mainly children, women and the elderly. More than 1,000 people were killed in ethnic clashes within South Sudan in 2012, with Jonglei being one of the states worst affected by the violence. Thousands more civilians have been displaced from their homes.

Along [[South Sudan]]'s border with [[Ethiopia]], a rebellion is smouldering among the Murle, with civilians caught in the conflict.&lt;ref name=aljazeera&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/photo_galleries/africa/201111010324526960.html|title=Sudan: Transcending tribe|publisher=Aljazeera.net/english, LLC|accessdate=2011-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Civilians alleging [[torture]] by the [[Sudan People's Liberation Army]] (SPLA) claim fingernails being torn out, burning plastic bags dripped on children to make their parents hand over weapons and the villages of Laor and the Tanyang people burned alive in their huts because rebels were suspected of spending the night in the village.&lt;ref name=aljazeera/&gt;

On August 18, 2011, to retaliate and retrieve cattle stolen from previous conflict, several young Murle sacked and burned the air strip village of [[Pierri]] and a dozen surrounding hamlets, killing over a hundred people, abducting dozens or hundreds of children and stealing up to tens of thousands of cattle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=South Sudan attacks 'leave 600 dead'|date=2011-08-22|accessdate=2013-12-27|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14595368}}&lt;/ref&gt; One explanation might also be the drought: Pierri has one of the very few functioning dry season drinking water wells, often with thousands of people queuing for its water. Nuer have often excluded Murle from using this water.

Because of the Dinka and Nuer domination in the South Sudan government and as well as in the State level, most problems are blamed on Murle, therefore it is difficult for journalists and researchers to check any claims against the Murle.

Some conflicts could be prevented by sinking more wells. Also, a national conference on drinking water, land use rights and land redistribution, might help, if Murle survival needs and all their arguments are taken seriously.

State intervention in bride wealth culture (moving it away from virtual slave trade to an exchange of intentions and nominal tokens) and strong state action against illegal taxation by local leaders in Nuer, Dinka and Murle society is also needed.

Also, South-Sudan, with its enormous agricultural potential during the rainy season, needs to be connected to regional and world markets, so that through agriculture and cattle breeding, the economy can be based on something else than tit for tat theft.

'''Non-linear media''' is a form of media that can be interacted with by the consumer, such as by selecting television shows to watch through a [[video on demand]] type service, by playing a video game, by clicking through a website, or by interacting through [[social media]]. Non-linear media is a move away from traditional linear media, in which content is selected by the publisher to be consumed and is then done so passively.&lt;ref name="Chron linear"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Hartman|first=Dennis|title=What Is Linear Marketing?|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/linear-marketing-22663.html|work=[[Houston Chronicle]]|accessdate=2016-04-17|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417222935/http://smallbusiness.chron.com/linear-marketing-22663.html|archive-date=2016-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bmcc.cuny.edu/faq/faq_detail.jsp?faq_id=1260&amp;course_id=173|title=What is the difference between linear and non-linear media applications?|publisher=[[Borough of Manhattan Community College]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417224624/http://www.bmcc.cuny.edu/faq/faq_detail.jsp?faq_id=1260&amp;course_id=173|archive-date=2016-04-17|access-date=2016-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Hasebrink|first=Uwe|url=https://www.hans-bredow-institut.de/de/forschung/linear-and-non-linear-television-viewers%25E2%2580%2599-perspective|title=Linear and Non-linear Television from Viewers' Perspective|publisher=[[Hans-Bredow-Institut]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417224821/https://www.hans-bredow-institut.de/de/forschung/linear-and-non-linear-television-viewers%E2%80%99-perspective|archive-date=2016-04-17|access-date=2016-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no single specific form of non-linear media; rather, what might be considered non-linear changes as technology changes.

==Television==
The model of traditional linear [[Broadcast programming|television programming]] is for a schedule of shows to be selected by the broadcaster and then viewed at a set time. In this model, the viewer cannot fast forward through the programming or choose to watch it at a later time. Conversely, non-linear television can be considered to be any method or technology that allows viewers to select what shows they watch and when they watch them. The ability to watch a show at any time is referred to as time shifted viewing; this can be achieved by either the consumer recording shows with a device such as a [[Digital video recorder|PVR]] for later viewing, or by the publisher providing content to be selected at will at the viewer's convenience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Technology/Documents/Broadcasting/TrendsinBroadcasting.pdf|title=Trends in Broadcasting: An overview of developments|last=Doeven|first=Jan|authorlink=|date=February 2013|website=itu.int|publisher=[[International Telecommunication Union]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426000533/https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Technology/Documents/Broadcasting/TrendsinBroadcasting.pdf|archive-date=2016-04-26 |access-date=2016-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-linear content is often viewed on a device other than a television, such as a personal computer or a [[smartphone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.itvdictionary.com/vod.html|title=Video on demand|website=The Video on Demand Dictionary and Business Index|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6gqi68gIB|archive-date=2016-04-18|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Video on demand]] (VOD) content can be transmitted over the internet via [[Streaming media|streaming]] services such as [[Netflix]], [[Hulu]], or [[Amazon Video]], or it can be provided by a television provider as an additional option on top of their linear programming. Many producers of content now offer streaming of programs through their own websites, though sometimes the catalog that is offered will be curated in some way, such as by providing only recently released episodes. Video may also be downloaded&amp;nbsp;– legally or illegally&amp;nbsp;– through a [[peer-to-peer]] network such as [[BitTorrent]], or it may be [[Direct download link|directly downloaded]] from a video hosting website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Ferraz|first=Tommy|date=2015-10-19|url=http://www.tommyferraz.com/bbc-innovation-non-linear-radio/|title=BBC innovates in non-linear radio|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160418002609/http://www.tommyferraz.com/bbc-innovation-non-linear-radio/|archive-date=2016-04-18|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As internet speeds and the number of alternate devices that are capable of viewing media on have increased, so has the number of people who consume non-linear media. The television network [[CBS]] expects that by the year 2020, 50 percent of all television content will be viewed in a non-linear fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.warc.com/LatestNews/News/CBS_sees_50_nonlinear_TV_future.news?ID=35223|title=CBS sees 50 percent non-linear TV future|work=Warc|date=2015-08-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160418020617/https://www.warc.com/LatestNews/News/CBS_sees_50_nonlinear_TV_future.news?ID=35223|archive-date=2016-04-18|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Lynch|first=Jason|date=2015-08-10|url=http://www.adweek.com/news/television/dont-panic-says-cbs-more-people-are-watching-tv-now-decade-ago-166313|title=Don't Panic, Says CBS: More People Are Watching TV Now Than a Decade Ago|work=[[Adweek]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160418020744/http://www.adweek.com/news/television/dont-panic-says-cbs-more-people-are-watching-tv-now-decade-ago-166313|archive-date=2016-04-18|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Music and radio ==
Like other forms of non-linear media such as television, non-linear radio allows listeners to pick and listen to music and talk shows on a schedule that is set by the listener. Online music streaming services such as [[Spotify]] or [[Deezer]] are non-linear in that they allow listeners to create playlists from a library of music offered by a website;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newslangmedia.com/born-skippy-radio-that-intentionally-misses-a-beat/|title=Born Skippy: Radio That (Intentionally) Misses A Beat|website=www.newslangmedia.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425234956/http://www.newslangmedia.com/born-skippy-radio-that-intentionally-misses-a-beat/|archive-date=2016-04-25|access-date=2016-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tommyferraz.com/after-the-non-linear-radio/|title=After the non-linear radio - Tommy Ferraz|website=Tommy Ferraz|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425234839/http://www.tommyferraz.com/after-the-non-linear-radio/|archive-date=2016-04-25|access-date=2016-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; similarly, [[podcast]]s offer the ability to download or stream prerecorded shows similar to those that are traditionally broadcast over the radio waves; in fact, some traditional radio stations allow their shows to be downloaded on demand after the show has aired over the radio in a linear manner.

In [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]], '''Pales''' was a deity of shepherds, flocks and livestock. Regarded as male by some sources and female by others, ''Pales'' can be either singular or plural in [[Latin]], and refers at least once to a pair of deities.

Pales' festival, called the [[Parilia]], was celebrated on April 21. Cattle were driven through bonfires on this day. Pales and the Parilia were strictly connected to the foundation of Rome which took place on the day of their festival.

[[Marcus Atilius Regulus]] built a temple to Pales in [[Rome]] following his victory over the [[Salento|Salentini]] in 267 BC. It is generally thought to have been located on the [[Palatine Hill]], but, being a victory monument, it may have been located on the route of the [[Roman triumph|triumphal]] procession, either on the [[Campus Martius]] or the [[Aventine Hill]]. According to the ''[[Fasti Antiates Maiores]]'', there was a festival for "the two Pales" ''(Palibus duobus)'' on July 7, probably to mark the dedication of this temple.&lt;ref&gt;[[H.H. Scullard]], ''Festivals and Ceremonies of the Roman Republic'' (Cornell University Press, 1981), p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Parya''' ({{lang-ru|Парья язык}}) is a [[List of Central Indo-Aryan languages|Central Indo-Aryan]] language spoken in parts of [[Uzbekistan]] and [[Tajikistan]]. Tajuzbeki (or Tadj-Uzbeki) was an alternative name coined by [[Bholanath Tivari]] for the same language. Much of the academic research in documenting and characterizing this isolated Indo-Aryan language was done by prominent [[Soviet people|Soviet]] [[linguist]] [[I. M. Oranski]].

== Classification and Geography ==
Parya is a language that is very close to becoming extinct. It is classified under Indo-European, Indo-Iranian, Indo-Aryan, and the Central Zone&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.endangeredlanguages.com/lang/4943|title=Did you know Parya is threatened?|website=Endangered Languages|language=en|access-date=2017-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; but is unclassified within the Indo-Aryan branch of Indo-Iranian.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www-01.sil.org/silesr/2010/silesr2010-014.Pdf|title=Language Maintenance Among the Parya of Tajikistan|last=Abbess|first=Elisabeth|last2=Muller|first2=Katja|date=May 2010|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 10, 2017|last3=Paul|first3=Daniel|last4=Tiessen|first4=Calvin|last5=Tiessen|first5=Gabriela}}&lt;/ref&gt; The language may also be referred to as Afgana-Yi Nasfurush, Afghana-Yi Siyarui, Changgars, Laghmani, or Pbharya,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/paq|title=Parya|work=Ethnologue|access-date=2017-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; but there are no other similar languages with the same ISO number, which is the code used to identify languages around the world. The main dialect of Parya is Marwari. Marwari is related to Punjabi which is related to the Afghanistan dialect.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://joshuaproject.net/people_groups/14324/TI|title=Parya in Tajikistan|last=Project|first=Joshua|access-date=2017-03-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest Parya villages in Tajikistan are the villages of Afghonobod, Qalai Hisor, Pravda Vostok, Boloi Kanal, and Kolkhozi Leninism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Endangerment of the Language ==
In order for a language to not be recognized as at threat of extinction, it needs at least 100,000 speakers. Unfortunately, Parya is not anywhere close to this. Depending on what source one refers to, there are anywhere from about 3,000 to 7,500 speakers left.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www-01.sil.org/silesr/2010/silesr2010-014.Pdf|title=Language Maintenance Among the Parya of Tajikistan|last=Abbess|first=Elisabeth|last2=Muller|first2=Katja|date=May 2010|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 10, 2017|last3=Paul|first3=Daniel|last4=Tiessen|first4=Calvin|last5=Tiessen|first5=Gabriela}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=6p6b5GQ4Q4YC&amp;pg=PA238&amp;lpg=PA238&amp;dq=parya+endangered+language#v=onepage&amp;q=parya%20endangered%20language&amp;f=false|title=Language Diversity Endangered|last=Brenzinger|first=Matthias|date=2007-01-01|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=9783110170504|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The language is not even officially recognized or used in schools.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/29986863/Clifton_CLS_2010_Final_Paper.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&amp;Expires=1489170799&amp;Signature=kIw%2Fh1dzvLlvtKjkkPqxuf6VGPs%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DStable_Multilingualism_in_Tajikstan.pdf|title=Stable Multilingualism in Tajikstan|last=Clifton|first=John|date=|website=Academia|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; With numbers so low, the language is categorized as severely endangered. This means it is mainly spoken by older generations, it is understood younger generations, but the youngest generations don't really use it at all.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://chartsbin.com/view/1339|title=Number of Endangered Languages by Country|last=ChartsBin|work=ChartsBin|access-date=2017-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Speakers of Parya ==
Many of those who speak the Parya language Sunni Muslims,&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://joshuaproject.net/people_groups/14324/TI|title=Parya in Tajikistan|last=Project|first=Joshua|access-date=2017-03-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many of them are farmers, and more specifically, primarily rice farmers.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; Many of the people live in Tajikistan, but some also live in Uzbekistan and Afghanistan.

== Region and Genealogy ==
Parya is largely spoken in the border regions between Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, specifically in the towns of [[Hisor]], [[Shahrinaw district|Shahrinav]], [[Tursunzoda|Regar/Tursunzoda]] and Surchi, located in the [[Gissar Valley|Hissor Valley]] of Tajikistan and the [[Surxondaryo Province|Surkhondaryo basin]] of Uzbekistan. It is based on the [[Brij Bhasha]], [[Haryanvi language|Haryanvi]] and [[Rajasthani language|Rajasthani]] dialects, and is highly influenced by [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]], [[Tajik language|Tajik]] and [[Russian language|Russian]] languages.&lt;ref name="Tivari1"&gt;Bholanath Tivari, "Soviet Sangh mein boli jane vali Hindi boli: Tajuzbeki : Aitihasik aur tulanatmak adhyayan tatha sankshipt shabdkosh" or "Tajuzbeki: The Hindi of the Soviet Union: A historical and comparative study, and glossary", National Publishing House, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Oranskaia"&gt;Tatiana Oranskaia, "Parya yazyk", Yazyki Rossiyskoy Federatsii i sosednix gosudarstv. Entsiklopediya. V tryox tomax. II K-R. Moskva: "Nauka"; 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

There are about 2,500 speakers worldwide. Parya speakers are usually bilingual in Tajik, but tend to exclusively use Parya at home.&lt;ref name="Ethno1"&gt;Barbara F. Grimes, Richard Saunders Pittman, Joseph Evans Grimes, "Ethnologue: Languages of the World", Summer Institute of Linguistics, 1996; {{ISBN|0-88312-815-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-88312-815-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vigesimal counting ==
Parya employs some [[vigesimal]] numeral counting patterns, though the base words used are Hindi.&lt;ref name="Jadranka1"&gt;Jadranka Gvozdanović, "Numeral types and changes worldwide", Walter de Gruyter, 1999; {{ISBN|3-11-016113-3}}, {{ISBN|978-3-11-016113-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Oranski1"&gt;Iosef Mikhailovich Oranski, "Dva indoariyski dialekta iz Srednei Azii", Indiyskaya i Iranskaya Filologiya; Institut Narodov Azii, Nauka, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10025">The '''Pauline Laws''' are the [[house law]]s of the [[House of Romanov]] of the [[Russian Empire]]. The name comes from the fact that they were initially established by Emperor [[Paul I of Russia]] in 1797.

Paul I abolished [[Peter the Great]]'s law which allowed each reigning emperor or empress to designate his or her successor, substituting a strict [[order of succession]] by proclaiming that the eldest son of the monarch shall inherit the throne, and other dynasts according to [[primogeniture]] in the male-line.&lt;ref name="antony"&gt; Succession to the Imperial Throne of
Russia. ''Fundamental Laws.'' Edited under the supervision of Antony, Archbishop of Los Angeles and South California. Order of the Imperial Union of Russia, Bridgeport, Connecticut, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; In so doing, Paul implemented a [[Salic law|semi-Salic]] [[line of succession to the Russian Throne]]: the throne could henceforth pass to a female and through the female ([[cognatic]]) line of the dynasty, upon the extinction of all legitimately-born, male [[Dynasty#Dynasts|dynasts]].&lt;ref name="antony"/&gt;

Over time the house laws were amended, and in the late Russian Empire the laws governing membership in the imperial house, succession to the throne and other dynastic subjects were divided, some being included in the [[Fundamental Laws of the Russian Empire]] and others in the Statute of the Imperial Family (codification of 1906, as amended through 1911).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.riuo.org/RussianImperialSuccession/russianimperialsuccession.html The Russian Imperial Succession], by Brien Purcell Horan &lt;/ref&gt; 

==Dynastic marriage==
In the spring of 1911, [[Princess Tatiana Konstantinovna of Russia]] became engaged to Prince Konstantin Alexandrovich [[Bagrationi|Bagration-Mukhransky]] (1889 - 1915), a [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] by birth, serving in a [[Russian Imperial Guard]]s regiment, who would die in [[World War I]]. She was to be the first [[List of Grand Duchesses of Russia|daughter of the Romanov]]s to openly marry a Russian subject or non-dynastic prince since the Romanov dynasty ascended the throne in 1613. Her anxious father approached the [[Nicholas II of Russia|Emperor Nicholas II]] and his empress, [[Alexandra Fyodorovna of Hesse]], for approval. On 30 November 1910 [[Grand Duke Constantine Constantinovich of Russia|Grand Duke Constantine Konstantinovich]] noted in one of his [[posthumous work|posthumously]] published journals ("From the Diaries of Grand Duke Konstantin Konstantinovich", Moscow, February 1994), that he had received assurances that "they would never look upon her marriage to a Bagration as [[morganatic marriage|morganatic]], because this [[dynasty|House]], like the [[Louis-Philippe of France|House of Orléans]], is descended from a once ruling dynasty."

Previously, the [[Morganatic branches of the Russian Imperial Family|morganatic wives of Romanov grand dukes]] had been [[banish]]ed from Russia along with their disgraced husbands (e.g., [[Sophie of Merenberg|Sophia von Merenberg, Countess de Torby]] and [[Grand Duke Michael Mihailovich of Russia|Grand Duke Michael Mikhailovich]]; and [[Princess Olga Paley]] and [[Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich of Russia|Grand Duke Paul Aleksandrovich]]). Female Romanovs had only dared marry morganatically in secret, and the couples’ relationships remained open secrets (e.g., Empress [[Elizabeth of Russia]] and [[Alexey Razumovsky]]; and the second marriage of [[Grand Duchess Maria Nikolaevna of Russia (1819–1876)|Grand Duchess Maria Nikolayevna]] and Count Grigory [[Stroganovs|Stroganov]]).

Nonetheless, legally, Tatiana Konstantinovna's marriage was morganatic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| others = ''emphasis added''| title = Almanach de Gotha| edition = 1944| year = 1944| publisher = [[Justus Perthes]]| location = Gotha, Germany| language = French| quote = Psse ''Tatiana-Constantinovna'', née à St-Pétersbourg 11 janv. 1890 v.s.; m.: 1. '''morg.''' à Pavlosk 24 août 1911 v.s. à Constantin Alexandrovitch pr. Bagration-Moukhransky, † (tué au combat) près de Jarosvavel, arrondt de Lwow, 19 mai 1915 v.s.| page = 107}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was, in fact, the first marriage in the dynasty conducted in compliance with the Emperor’s formal decision ''not'' to accept as dynastic the marriages of even the most junior Romanovs&amp;mdash;those that bore only the title of prince/princess&amp;mdash;with non-royal partners. According to "Always A Grand Duke", the 1933 memoir of Nicholas II’s brother-in-law, [[Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich of Russia|Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich]] (published in New York, by Farrar and Rinehart, Inc.), concern about the eventual marriages of [[cadet]] Romanovs so troubled the senior grand dukes that Alexander approached the Emperor about relaxing the requirement that all dynasts marry partners "possessing corresponding rank" enshrined in article 188 of the Pauline Laws, but was rebuffed. The grand dukes then officially petitioned the Emperor through a commission chaired by [[Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolayevich of Russia]], requesting that a new category of dynastic marriages be recognized, to consist of Imperial princes and princesses entitled, with specific Imperial consent, to marry persons of non-royal blood yet retaining the right to transmit to the issue thereof eligibility to inherit the throne. The Emperor’s response was issued formally on 14 June 1911 in the form of a [[memorandum]] from the [[Ministry of the Imperial Court|Minister of the Imperial Court]], Baron [[Vladimir Frederiks]]:&lt;ref name="fred"&gt;State Archives of the Russian Federation, Series 601. The Emperor Nicholas II. Inventory {register} 1, File 2143, pages 58–59.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''The Lord Emperor has seen fit to permit marriages to persons not possessing corresponding rank of not all Members of the Imperial Family, but only of Princes and Princesses of the Blood Imperial...Princes as well as Princesses of the Blood Imperial, upon contracting a marriage with a person not possessing corresponding rank, shall personally retain the title and privileges which are theirs by birth, with the exception of their right to succession from which they shall have abdicated before entering the marriage. In relation to the categorization of the marriages of Princes and Princesses of the Blood Imperial, the Lord Emperor has seen fit to recognize only two categories in these marriages: (a) equal marriages, i.e. those contracted with persons belonging to a Royal or Ruling House, and (b) unequal marriages, i.e. those contracted with persons not belonging to a Royal or Ruling House, and will not recognize any other categories.'' &lt;/blockquote&gt;

As promised in this communiqué (the so-called "Frederiks Memorandum"), the Emperor proceeded to legalize ''authorized'' marriages of imperial Romanovs below grand ducal rank to persons who lacked "corresponding rank". Such marriages had been altogether banned, rather than deemed morganatic, by [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III’s]] ''ukase'' #5868 on  23 March 1889. But ''ukase'' #35731/1489, issued on  11 August 1911, amended the 1889 ban with the words, "Henceforth no grand duke or grand duchess may contract a marriage with a person not possessing corresponding rank, that is, not belonging to a Royal or Ruling house."

Both the 1889 and 1911 decrees were addenda to article 188 of the Pauline laws (re-codified as article 63 of the Imperial Family Statute). Left intact, however, was that original statute: "A person of the Imperial family who has entered into a marriage alliance with a person not possessing corresponding rank, that is, not belonging to a Royal or Ruling House, cannot pass on to that person, or to any posterity that may issue from such a marriage, the rights which belong to the Members of the Imperial family."

Also remaining unrepealed was article 36 ("Children born of a marriage between a member of the Imperial Family and a person not of corresponding rank, that is, not belonging to a Royal or Ruling House, shall have no right of succession to the Throne"). Aside from article 188, article 36 applied to prevent Tatiana Konstantinovna's issue from claiming succession rights.

Her contemplated marriage having been rendered legal, Tatiana Konstantinovna renounced her dynastic rights, as required. Nicholas II acknowledged this in a ''ukase'' addressed to the Imperial Senate on 9 February 1914: "Her Highness the Princess Tatiana Konstantinovna has presented to Us over Her own sign manual, a renunciation of the right to succession to the Imperial Throne of [[All the Russias]] belonging to Her as a member of the Imperial House,"&lt;ref name="renounce"&gt;Collection of Statutes and Decrees of the Government. 1914. #441.&lt;/ref&gt; receiving in return Nicholas II’s authorization to marry Bagration-Mukhransky (This was the same family into which Princess Leonida Bagration of Mukhrani, wife of Vladimir Cyrillovich, was born).

Tatiana Konstantinovna and her Georgian prince were married at her father's estate at [[Pavlovsk, Saint Petersburg|Pavlovsk]], on 3 September 1911. The Emperor was present at the wedding. On the same day the Emperor issued yet another ''ukase'', (#35766): "By Our and Grand Duke Konstantin Konstantinovich’s and Grand Duchess Elizaveta Mavrikievna’s consent, the wedding took place on 24th day of this August ''[old style]'' of the Daughter of Their Imperial Highnesses, Her Highness the Princess Tatiana Konstantinovna, with Prince Konstantin Bagration-Mukhransky. In consequence of this order: The Princess Tatiana Konstantiovna to retain the title of Highness and henceforth to bear the name of Her Highness the Princess Tatiana Konstantinovna Princess Bagration-Mukhransky..."&lt;ref name="renounce"/&gt;

'''Privacy protocols''' are [[Guideline|guildline]]s intended to allow computation while still protecting the individuals involved.  It can be developed from just two individuals trying to discover if they both know the same secret, without leaking information about the secret itself. In this case, after the protocol runs, both individuals will either know that they share the secret, or know that they do not share it; they will have gained no additional information about the other's secret.

==Examples of privacy protocols==
For example, say the secret is a name of a person.  One protocol is to use a random phone number, such as 555-111-2222, then replace the last n digits of the phone number with the secret such as 555-111-JOHN.  Then the first person calls the number and leaves a message with the person on the other end for the second person.  Next the second person calls the number of their secret and asks if there are any messages for him.  One issue with this protocol is that the phone number created might not exist.

Another protocol without this issue is to designate an airline, destination and date, and have the first person make a reservation using the name of their secret, then the second person goes and cancels the reservation using the name of their secret.  If the second person is not successful, then they don't share the secret.

A simple protocol that does not rely on a human third party involves [[password]] changing.  This works anywhere one has to type in new passwords the same twice before the password is changed.  The first individual will type their secret in the first box, and the second person will type their secret in the second box, if the password is successfully changed then the secret is shared.  However the computer is still a third party and must be trusted not to have a [[key logger]].

A more involved protocol that does not involve any reliance on a third party, human or machine, involves ''n'' cups, each with a label of the name of a person that could be the secret.  Each individual will then place a slip of paper under each cup, one slip of paper will say 'yes' on it and will go under the cup with the name of the secret on it, all the other slips will say 'no'.  Then the labels will be removed, the cups shuffled, then flipped over to reveal the slips of paper.  If there is a cup with both slips of paper saying 'yes' on them then they share the secret.

There are many other protocols that involve two individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==History==

At the time of independence in 1975, Mozambique was one of the poorest countries in the world. The position of residents worsened during the civil war years 1977-1992.&lt;ref name="gvnet.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Child Prostitution: The Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children in the early years of the 21st Century – Republic of Mozambique|url=http://www.gvnet.com/childprostitution/Mozambique.htm|website=gvnet.com|accessdate=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The arrival of [[United Nations peacekeeping missions involving Pakistan|peacekeepers operating]] under the auspices of the [[United Nations|UN]] resulted in an increase in the prostitution industry. In 1992, prostitution in Mozambique had reached such proportions that the post of mediator was created between the military on the one hand and pimps and prostitutes on the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sheila Jeffreys|date=28 January 2016|url=http://womenation.org/military-prostitution/|publisher=WOMENATION|title= Военная проституция|trans-title=Military Prostitution|language=ru|accessdate=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The problem of prostitution in Mozambique came under international discussion for the first time in the mid 1990s, when the deputy head of the UN mission Behrouz Sadri accused UN peacekeepers of buying sex from underage prostitutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Prostitution Report Accuses U.N.

==Statistics of child prostitution==
Research into [[child prostitution]] carried out in [[Maputo]] and published in 2001 indicated that 98% of child prostitutes were girls, 26% were aged 10-14 years, and 14.1% attended school. Of those not attending school, 69% had dropped out of school due to lack of funds, 12% had reached the second year of primary school, and 7.4% had attended high school.&lt;ref name="gvnet.com"/&gt;

==Sex trafficking==
{{see also|Human trafficking in Mozambique}}
Human trafficking in Mozambique is a significant problem. Mozambique is a source country for people trafficked for forced prostitution. Research in 2003 indicated that Mozambican girls and young women between the ages of 14 and 24 were typically being recruited. The main destination was [[South Africa]], where they were put into [[sexual slavery]] and compelled to work in prostitution.

{{Human Rights in North Korea |expanded=Human rights abuses}}
'''Prostitution in North Korea''' is illegal and is not visible to visitors. Allegedly, a collection of women called the ''kippumjo'' provided sexual entertainment to high-ranking officials until 2011. Meanwhile, some North Korean women who migrate to China become involved in prostitution.

==Private prostitution==

Under Article 261 of the Criminal law, prostitution is punishable by up to two years labour if engaged in "multiple times".&lt;ref&gt;Article 261 {{cite web|title=The Criminal Law of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea|url=https://www.hrnk.org/uploads/pdfs/The%20Criminal%20Law%20of%20the%20Democratic%20Republic%20of%20Korea_2009_%20(1).pdf|website=[[Committee for Human Rights in North Korea]]|accessdate=17 March 2018|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[CIA]] analyst Helen-Louise Hunter, during the rule of [[Kim Il-sung]], there was no organized [[prostitution]], but some prostitution was still practiced discreetly near railroad stations and restaurants.&lt;ref&gt;''Kim Il-song's North Korea'' by Helen-Louise Hunter.Greenwood Publishing Group, 1999, p 107&lt;/ref&gt; While defectors currently report widespread prostitution, this is not experienced by visitors to the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hyams|first1=James|title=Does North Korea have sex trade and drug problem?|url=http://www.koreaobserver.com/north-korea-sex-trade-and-drug-problem-26094/|website=The Korea Observer|accessdate=10 February 2018|date=4 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kippumjo==
{{main|Kippumjo}}
The ''kippŭmjo'' is an alleged collection of groups of approximately 2,000 women and girls that was maintained by the [[Chairman of the National Defence Commission of North Korea|head of state]] of [[North Korea]] for the purpose of providing pleasure, mostly of a sexual nature, and entertainment for high-ranking [[Workers' Party of Korea]] (WPK) officials and their families, as well as occasionally distinguished guests. Its [[prostitutes]] were known as ''manjokcho'' ({{lang|ko-Hang|만족조}} "satisfaction team(s)") and were organised as a part of the ''kippŭmjo'', who were drafted from among 14- to 20-year-old [[virgins]], trained for about 20 months, and often "ordered to marry guards of {{bracket|[[Kim Jong-il]]}} or national heroes" when they are 25 years old.&lt;ref name=jeongjs&gt;"[https://web.archive.org/web/20130322212930/http://www.awomansvoice.org/nl1-2004-2.html Intervention Agenda Item 12: Elimination of Violence Against Women (archived copy)]" at the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]] in April 2004; speaker: Ji Sun JEONG for ''A Woman's Voice International''{{cite web|url=http://www.awomansvoice.org/nl1-2005-6.html |title=United Nations NGO Committee in New York to suspend A Woman´s Voice International |accessdate=February 22, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723152410/http://www.awomansvoice.org/nl1-2005-6.html |archivedate=July 23, 2008 }}{{cite web|url=http://www.awomansvoice.org/nl1-2005-3.html |title=ESTIMONY OF BOB FU APRIL 19, 2005 before the COMMITTEE ON INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS of the UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES |accessdate=February 22, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723152449/http://www.awomansvoice.org/nl1-2005-3.html |archivedate=July 23, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their services were not available to most North Korean men.&lt;ref name=jeongjs /&gt; Not all ''kippŭmjo'' worked as prostitutes; other ''kippŭmjo'' activities were massaging and half-naked singing and dancing. The ''kippŭmjo'' were disbanded shortly after Kim Jong-Il's death in 2011.&lt;ref name=Squad&gt;{{cite web|title=North Korea reportedly recruiting women to joint 'pleasure squad' for Kim Jong Un|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2015/04/03/north-korea-reportedly-recruiting-new-members-for-kim-jong-un-pleasure-squad/?intcmp=trending|website=Fox News|publisher=FoxNews.com|date=3 April 2015|accessdate=6 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170503195449/http://www.foxnews.com/world/2015/04/03/north-korea-reportedly-recruiting-new-members-for-kim-jong-un-pleasure-squad.html|archive-date=3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sex trafficking==
{{see also|Human trafficking in North Korea|North Korean defectors}}
North Korea  is a source country for women and children who are subjected to sex trafficking. The [[United States Department of State]] [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] ranks North Korea as a '[[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|Tier 3]]' country.&lt;ref name="state18"&gt;{{cite web |title=Democratic People's Republic of Korea 2018 Trafficking in Persons Report |url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2018/282684.htm |website=U.S. Department of State |accessdate=26 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prostitution of North Koreans in China===
{{see also|Prostitution in China#North Korean prostitutes in China}}
Some North Korean women who migrate to China become prostitutes, either voluntarily or forcibly. According to the UN Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights, when the women are repatriated to North Korea, they are subjected to forced abortion and their mixed race children are subject to infanticide.&lt;ref name="United Nations Human Rights Council 2014"/&gt;

'''Ravela Joseph''' (born 1937) is a [[Priest]] of the [[Protestant]] [[Samavesam of Telugu Baptist Churches]] ([[Samavesam of Telugu Baptist Churches|STBC]]) with over 50 years of [[ecclesiastical]] [[Christian ministry|ministry]], much of which was into [[Spiritual formation]], having taught&lt;ref&gt;[http://senateofseramporecollege.edu.in/faculty.php?college=Andhra%20Christian%20Theological%20College&amp;spez=Select%20Specialization&amp;i=20 Directory of Teaching Staff, Senate of Serampore College (University)]&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Andhra Christian Theological College]], [[Secunderabad]], [[Telangana]] ([[India]]).

==Studies and academics==
===Propadeutic studies===
The [[American Baptist Mission]]/[[Samavesam of Telugu Baptist Churches]] was one of the [[Protestant]] missions that began its [[Christian mission]] in the early nineteenth century in [[India]] whose south India ministries were headquartered in [[Ramayapatnam]] in [[Andhra Pradesh]].  R. Joseph evinced interest in pursuing [[Priesthood]] as a full time vocation and underwent [[Spiritual formation]] at the historic Baptist Theological Seminary, [[Ramayapatnam]] studying under the Principalship of [[The Reverend|The Rev.]] Maurice Blanchard&lt;ref name="President"&gt;B. R. Moses, ''Ramayapatnam Baptist Theological Seminary Centenary Report 1874-1974'', in K. J. W. Jayakumar (Compiled), ''The Lights That Never Quench - Baptist Missionaries'', Self published by the author, [[Nellore]], 2008, pp.107-114.&lt;/ref&gt; and other faculty comprising [[The Reverend|The Rev.]] [[Gaddala Solomon|G. Solomon]].&lt;ref name="President"/&gt;  The seminary was directly affiliated to the [[Senate of Serampore College (University)]] and Joseph was awarded the graduate degree of [[Bachelor of Divinity|B.D.]] in 1967&lt;ref name="CT"/&gt; from the Seminary President, [[Louis F. Knoll]]&lt;ref name="President"/&gt; after which he was assigned&lt;ref name="CT"/&gt; a teaching role in that Seminary.

===Research studies===
====United States: Newton====
In 1972,&lt;ref name="CT"/&gt; The Council of the [[Ramayapatnam]] Baptist Theological Seminary, [[Ramayapatnam]] and the [[Samavesam of Telugu Baptist Churches]] sent R. Joseph to the [[Andover Newton Theological School]], [[Newton, Massachusetts|Newton]] for postgraduate studies where he earned a [[Master of Sacred Theology]]&lt;ref name="CT"/&gt; ''([[S.T.M.]])'' degree and on his return continued to teach at the Seminary which by then had integrated its [[B. D.]] section into the [[Andhra Christian Theological College]] and R. Joseph was reassigned&lt;ref name="CT"/&gt; to teach there by the [[Samavesam of Telugu Baptist Churches]].

====India: Bangalore====
In 1978,&lt;ref name="Hiwale"&gt;K. M. Hiwale (Compiled), ''Directory 1910-1997 of the [[United Theological College, Bangalore]]'', 1997, p.115&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Samavesam of Telugu Baptist Churches]] had accorded study leave to R. Joseph who went to the [[United Theological College, Bangalore]] to upgrade his S. T. M. obtained from the United States to  [[Master of Theology]] ''([[M. Th.]])'' degree and researched on the writings of [[Puroshottam Choudhary]]&lt;ref name="Bhakti"/&gt; under the supervision of [[Joshua Russell Chandran]] and [[Eric J. Lott]],&lt;ref name="Bhakti"/&gt; his Professors.  Joseph's companions at the college included [[G. Devakadasham]],&lt;ref name="Hiwale"/&gt; [[G. D. V. Prasad]]&lt;ref name="Hiwale"/&gt; and others.&lt;ref name="Hiwale"/&gt;

By 1980, R. Joseph rejoined [[Andhra Christian Theological College]] and resumed his teaching responsibilities.  Again in 1983,&lt;ref name="CT"/&gt; he returned to the [[United Theological College, Bangalore]] to undertake doctoral studies but had to leave it midway as he was called to teach at his ''[[alma mater]]'' the Baptist Theological Seminary,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.printsasia.in/book/bhakti-theology-of-purushottam-chowdhari-ravela-joseph Print Asia]&lt;/ref&gt; Ramayapatnam&lt;ref name="CT"/&gt; from where he again joined the [[Andhra Christian Theological College]].

===General studies===
In 1985, R. Joseph enrolled at the State-run [[Osmania University]] from where he studied [[Master of Arts]].&lt;ref name="CT"/&gt;

==Teaching==
===Andhra Pradesh===
Soon after R. Joseph completed his graduate studies in 1967&lt;ref name="CT"/&gt; at the [[Ramayapatnam]] Baptist Theological Seminary, [[Ramayapatnam]], he was assigned a teaching assignment.  By this time, efforts among the [[Protestants]] to form a unified seminary gained credence leading to the formation of the [[Andhra Christian Theological College]] in 1964 [[Rajahmundry]] by,

* the [[Baptists]] of the [[Convention of Baptist Churches of Northern Circars]],
* the [[Lutherans]] of the [[Andhra Evangelical Lutheran Church]] and the [[South Andhra Lutheran Church]], 
* the [[Methodists]] of the [[Methodist Church in India]],
* the [[Anglicans]], [[Congregationalists]] and the [[Wesleyanism|Wesleyans]] of the [[Church of South India]]

However, compared to the [[Ramayapatnam]] Baptist Theological Seminary which was entitled to admit students for the [[Bachelor of Divinity]] degree courses - that too with [[English language|English]] as the medium of instruction, the new unified [[Protestant]] seminary offered only [[Licentiate in Theology]] level courses in [[Telugu language|Telugu]] medium.  The [[Samavesam of Telugu Baptist Churches]] was way ahead of its times both in terms of the academic credentials of its faculty as well as its affiliation to the [[Senate of Serampore College (University)]].  Though the [[Baptists]] of the [[Samavesam of Telugu Baptist Churches]] were in favour of joining the new unified [[Protestant]] initiative in [[Rajahmundry]], the integration did not seem ripe at that stage.  R. Joseph had just finished his graduate studies at [[Ramayapatnam]] in 1967&lt;ref name="CT"/&gt; and just at that time his Principal, [[The Reverend|The Rev.]] Maurice Blanchard and his successor [[The Reverend|The Rev.]] [[Louis F. Knoll]] decided to experiment&lt;ref name="President"/&gt; and moved their [[Bachelor of Divinity|B.D.]] section from [[Ramayapatnam]]&lt;ref name="President"/&gt; to [[Rajahmundry]]&lt;ref name="President"/&gt; and functioned as a separate entity within the premises&lt;ref name="President"/&gt; of the [[Andhra Christian Theological College]] in [[Rajahmundry]].  R. Joseph's teaching companions, K. Wilson,&lt;ref name="President"/&gt; K. S. Prasada Rao,&lt;ref name="President"/&gt; Tracy G. Gipson,&lt;ref name="President"/&gt; Alice M. Findlay,&lt;ref name="President"/&gt; B. R. Moses&lt;ref name="President"/&gt; and [[Louis F. Knoll]] moved to [[Rajahmundry]] while [[Gaddala Solomon|G. Solomon]], [[Suppogu Joseph|S. Joseph]], P. Joseph &lt;ref name="President"/&gt; and D. Daniel&lt;ref name="President"/&gt; joined later.

In his second phase at [[Ramayapatnam]], R. Joseph rejoined the seminary in 1984&lt;ref name="CT"/&gt; taking up the Presidentship of the Seminary which was training [[Catechism|Catechetists]] to take up rural evangelism and R. Joseph took responsibility to build up the seminary and stayed in [[Ramayapatnam]] until 1994 when he finally moved again to [[Hyderabad]].&lt;ref name="CT"/&gt;

===Telangana===
By 1972, the [[Samavesam of Telugu Baptist Churches]] fully integrated its [[Bachelor of Divinity|B.D.]] section into the [[Andhra Christian Theological College]] which by then was relocated to [[Hyderabad]].  R. Joseph was sent on study leave to the [[United States]] to upgrade his studies to enable him to take up teaching at the unified [[Protestant]] Theologiate in [[Hyderabad]] and returned in 1973&lt;ref name="CT"/&gt; to take up teaching of Theology.  On his return, R. Joseph joined the [[Andhra Christian Theological College]] which was by then led by the [[Old Testament]] Scholar [[Victor Premasagar]] while his other companions from [[Ramayapatnam]] continued to teach there who included [[Suppogu Joseph|S. Joseph]],&lt;ref name="President"/&gt; [[Gaddala Solomon|G. Solomon]],&lt;ref name="President"/&gt; K. S. Prasada Rao,&lt;ref name="President"/&gt; and Tracy G. Gipson.&lt;ref name="President"/&gt;

While this was so, K. Wilson had by that time left the Office of the Priesthood moving to the State-run [[Osmania University]] to take up teaching of the [[Philosophy]] as a civilian.  After teaching for nearly six years at the [[Andhra Christian Theological College]], R. Joseph had to revisit his academics to tune up his postgraduate degree earned in the [[United States]] to suit the requirements of the [[Senate of Serampore College (University)]] and left for Bangalore in 1978,&lt;ref name="Hiwale"/&gt; rejoining the College in 1980 and taught for nearly three more years till 1983 when he went on study leave to his [[alma mater]] at [[Bangalore]].

After a gap of nearly a decade, R. Joseph rejoined the [[Andhra Christian Theological College]] in 1994&lt;ref name="CT"/&gt; which by then was led by [[The Reverend|Rev.]] [[R.Yesurathnam|R. Yesurathnam]], the Principal and R. Joseph continued to teach Theology for the aspirants until he retired on attaining superannuation in 2003.&lt;ref name="CT"/&gt;

R. Joseph's students at the [[Ramayapatnam]] Baptist Theological Seminary, [[Ramayapatnam]] and the [[Andhra Christian Theological College]] have substantially contributed to the growth of Christianity in India and include,
* Bishop Emeritus [[T. S. Kanaka Prasad|Thalari Samuel Kanaka Prasad]], [[Church of South India|CSI]]-Bishop Emeritus - in - [[Diocese of Medak|Medak]],

A '''reprimand''' is a severe, formal or official [[wikt:reproof|reproof]].  Reprimanding takes in different forms in different legal systems. A reprimand may be a formal legal action issued by a government agency or professional governing board (e.g. [[medical board]], [[bar council]]). It may also be an administrative warning issued by an employer or school.

== United Kingdom ==
From 1998 until 2013 in the UK, young people aged 10–17 years old could receive a reprimand (provided they had not previously been given a reprimand, a final warning or been found guilty at court). A reprimand was a formal verbal warning given by a police officer to a young person who admitted they are guilty of a 'minor' first offence.

The police passed on the details to the local [[Youth Offending Team]] of those young people given a reprimand. 
Sometimes the young person would be referred to the YOT to take part in a voluntary programme to help them address their offending behaviour.

Reprimands and final warnings were criminal records (but not convictions) governed by provisions of the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act.&lt;ref&gt;Clifford Williams (2011) "The growth and permanency of Criminal Records" in ''he Police Journal'' Vol 84 no. 2 pp. 171–183&lt;/ref&gt;

Reprimands and Final Warnings were a statutory disposal, created by sections 65–66 of the [[Crime and Disorder Act 1998]] to replace cautions for offenders aged 17 and under.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/acts/crime-and-disorder-act-1998 Crime and Disorder Act 1998: Details]&lt;/ref&gt; Guidance on the scheme was available for Police and Youth Offending Teams through joint [[Home Office]]/[[Youth Justice Board]] guidance published in November 2002.

In 2013 the system of cautions for young people was reintroduced, and reprimands and final warnings no longer given. This change was part of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4545">A '''rural credit cooperative''' (RCC) ({{zh|c=农村信用合作社}}) or ({{zh|s= 农村信用社|t= 農村信用社|p=nóngcūn xìnyòngshè}}) is a cooperative or credit union sanctioned by [[People's Bank of China]] to provide [[Credit (finance)|credit]] in the [[rural society of the People's Republic of China|rural areas of the People's Republic of China]].

== History ==
In The 1950s, a network of rural credit [[cooperatives]] was created. At this time, they were not commercial enterprises similar to banks, but rather channeled credit between the state and the [[people's commune]]s in rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;Kellee Tsai, "Imperfect Substitutes: The Local Political Economy of Informal Finance and Microfinance in Rural China and India" ''World Development'' 32:9 (September 2004): 1487–1507.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1970s, after [[economic reforms in China|economic reforms]] enabled some individual [[entrepreneurialism]] and the creation of [[collective]] enterprises, the RCCs began to function as grassroots banks that provided credit and [[savings]] accounts to families and collective enterprises. In the reform era, the RCCs were intended to serve as a means for the [[Agricultural Bank of China]] to funnel credit into rural areas. However, the RCCs were insufficient to meet the high demand for credit in these areas.&lt;ref&gt;Kellee Tsai, ''Back-Alley Banking: Private Entrepreneurs in China''(Ithaca, New York: Cornell University Press, 2002), 152.&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual and enterprises often turn to other sources of credit, which range from [[rotating savings and credit association]]s to [[pawn shop]]s. However, these other forms are all illegal (although some are tolerated to a greater degree than others, and are tolerated in some locations more than in others). Commercial banks are legal, but since fewer than one percent of loans from state banks go to private entrepreneurs, they do not meet the credit needs of rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;Tsai (2002), 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 1996, the RCCs were supervised by the [[Agricultural Bank of China]]. In 1996, they were transferred to the [[People's Bank of China]].&lt;ref&gt;Tsai (2002), 152.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1998, the rural credit [[foundation (nonprofit organization)|foundations]] (RCF) ({{zh|s= 农村合作基金会|t=農村合作基金會|p= nóngcūn hézuò jījīnhuì}}) were banned when the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China]] ({{zh|s=国务院|t=國務院|p=guowuyuan}}) issued the "Provisions on the Cancellation of Illegal Financial Institutions and Activities". This left the RCCs as the only legal financial institution (other than banks) that served rural enterprises and individuals. As of 1998, when the RCFs were banned, there were approximately 44,000 [[towns of China|township-level]] RCCs and 280,000 village-level RCC branches.&lt;ref name="Tsai 2004, 1489"&gt;Tsai (2004), 1489.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1998, many of the RCCs have gradually been transformed into rural commercial banks (RCBs). The first [[foreign portfolio investment|foreign investment]] in an RCB was allowed in 2006, when [[Rabobank]] and the [[International Finance Corporation]] (the private sector arm of the [[World Bank]]) acquired stakes in the [[United Rural Cooperative Bank of Hangzhou]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110523225756/http://www.ifc.org/ifcext/media.nsf/content/SelectedPressRelease?OpenDocument&amp;UNID=AC6A22C0142C456D852571A80057AD5A IFC News – Press Releases &amp; Features – Press Release&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Challenges ==
Due to a high volume of [[non-performing loans]], many of the RCCs are technically [[insolvent]]. Since 1998, central banking authorities have injected approximately US$4 billion into [[recapitalization]] the RCCs, and have considered other measures for improving the performance of the RCCs.&lt;ref name="Tsai 2004, 1489"/&gt;

Although the RCCs are gradually being transformed into independent commercial banks (RCBs), they are still not immune from government requests to make [[policy]] loans (loans issued for political reasons, such as the desire to support certain politically important industries or firms, rather than because the firm is an attractive candidate for a loan).&lt;ref&gt;Tsai (2002), 208.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Songhay''' or '''Songhai languages''' ({{IPA-xx|soŋaj|}} or {{IPA-xx|soŋoj|}}) are a group of closely related [[language]]s/[[dialect]]s centred on the middle stretches of the [[Niger River]] in the [[West Africa]]n countries of [[Mali]], [[Niger]], [[Benin]], [[Burkina Faso]] and [[Nigeria]]. In particular, they are spoken in the cities of [[Timbuktu]] and [[Gao]]. They have been widely used as a ''[[lingua franca]]'' in that region ever since the era of the [[Songhai Empire]]. In [[Mali]], the government has officially adopted the dialect of Gao (east of [[Timbuktu]]) as the dialect to be used as a medium of primary education.&lt;ref&gt;Heath 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Songhay languages have little to no [[mutual intelligibility]] between each other. For example, [[Koyraboro Senni]], spoken in Gao, is unintelligible to speakers of [[Zarma language|Zarma]] in [[Niger]], according to ''[[Ethnologue]]''. However, Songhay, Zarma and Dendi have high mutual intelligibility within Niger.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.org/show_country.asp?name=NE Ethnologue report for Niger&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[linguist]]s, a major point of interest in the Songhay languages has been the difficulty of determining their genetic affiliation; they are commonly taken to be [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]], as defined by [[Joseph Greenberg|Greenberg]] in 1963, but this classification remains controversial. Linguist Gerrit Dimmendaal (2008) believes that for now it is best considered an independent language family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dimmendaal|first=Gerrit|date=18 September 2008|title=Language Ecology and Linguistic Diversity on the African Continent|url=|journal=Language and Linguistics Compass 2/5|pages=840–858|doi=10.1111/j.1749-818X.2008.00085.x|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, the name ''Songhay'' was neither an ethnic nor a linguistic designation, but a name for the ruling caste of the Songhai Empire. Under the influence of [[French language]] usage, speakers in Mali have increasingly been adopting it as an ethnic self-designation;&lt;ref&gt;Heath 1999:2&lt;/ref&gt; however, other Songhay-speaking groups identify themselves with other ethnic terms, such as [[Zarma people|Zarma]] (Djerma) or [[Isawaghen]].

A few precolonial poems and letters composed in Songhay and written in the [[Arabic script]] exist in Timbuktu.&lt;ref&gt;Hunwick and Boye 2008: ____&lt;/ref&gt; However, Songhay is currently written in the [[Latin script]].

Researchers classify the Songhay languages into two main branches; Southern and Northern.&lt;ref&gt;A map of the varieties is provided by Ethnologue at its Web site. See the list of External Links.&lt;/ref&gt; Southern Songhay is centered on the Niger River. [[Zarma language|Zarma]] ([[Zarma language|Djerma]]), the most widely spoken Songhay language with two or three million speakers, is a major language of southwestern [[Niger]] (downriver from and south of Mali) including in the capital city, [[Niamey]]. [[Koyraboro Senni]], with 400,000 speakers, is the language of the town of Gao, the seat of the old Songhai Empire. Koyra Chiini is spoken to its west. The much smaller Northern Songhay is a group of heavily [[Berber languages|Berber]]-influenced dialects spoken in the [[Sahara]]. Since the Berber influence extends beyond the lexicon into the inflectional morphology, the Northern Songhay languages are sometimes viewed as [[mixed language]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sil.org/silewp/abstract.asp?ref=2002-005 SIL Working Papers on Songhay]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genetic affiliation==

[[Diedrich Hermann Westermann]], a missionary and linguist, hesitated between assigning it to [[Gur languages|Gur]] or considering it an isolate, and [[Maurice Delafosse]] grouped it with [[Mande languages|Mande]]. At present, Songhay is normally considered to be [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]], following [[Joseph Greenberg]]'s 1963 reclassification of [[African languages]]; Greenberg's argument is based on about 70 claimed [[cognate]]s, including [[pronoun]]s.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} This proposal has been developed further by, in particular, [[Lionel Bender (linguist)|Lionel Bender]], who sees it as an independent subfamily of Nilo-Saharan. [[Roger Blench]] notes that Songhay shares the defining [[Singulative number|singulative–plurative]] morphology typical of Nilo-Saharan languages, though it is difficult to show that any of the branches of Nilo-Saharan are actually related. As of 2011, he believes that Songhay is closest to the neighboring [[Saharan languages]], and not divergent.

However, a Nilo-Saharan classification is controversial. Greenberg's argument was subjected to serious criticism by Lacroix, who deemed only about 30 of Greenberg's claimed cognates acceptable, and moreover argued that these held mainly between [[Zarma language|Zarma]] and the [[Saharan languages]],{{fix|text=What about Tagdal, which neighbors Saharan?}} thus leading one to suspect them of being [[loanword]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Lacroix 1969:&amp;nbsp;91–92&lt;/ref&gt; Certain Songhay–[[Mande languages|Mande]] similarities have long been observed (at least since Westermann), and Mukarovsky (1966), Denis Creissels (1981) and [[Robert Nicolaï|Nicolaï]] (1977, 1984) investigated the possibility of a Mande relationship; Creissels made some 50 comparisons, including many body parts and [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] suffixes (such as the [[causative]] in ''-endi''), while Nicolaï claimed some 450 similar words as well as some conspicuous [[Linguistic typology|typological]] traits.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} However, Nicolaï eventually concluded that this approach was not adequate, and in 1990 proposed a distinctly novel hypothesis: that Songhay is a [[Berber languages|Berber]]-based [[creole language]], restructured under Mande influence. In support of this he proposed 412 similarities, ranging all the way from basic vocabulary (''tasa'' "[[liver]]") to obvious borrowings (''anzad'' "[[violin]]", ''alkaadi'' "[[qadi]]".) Others, such as Gerrit Dimmendaal, were not convinced, and Nicolaï (2003) appears to consider the question of Songhay's origins still open, while arguing against Bender's proposed etymologies.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}

Greenberg's morphological similarities with Nilo-Saharan include the personal pronouns ''ai'' (cf. [[Zaghawa language|Zaghawa]] ''ai''), 'I', ''ni'' (cf. [[Kanuri language|Kanuri]] ''nyi''), 'you (sg.)', ''yer'' (e.g. Kanuri ''-ye''), 'we', ''wor'' (cf. Kanuri ''-wi''), 'you (pl.)'; relative and adjective formants ''-ma'' (e.g. Kanuri ''-ma'') and ''-ko'' (cf. [[Maba language|Maba]] ''-ko''), a plural suffix ''-an'' (?), a hypothetical plural suffix ''-r'' (cf. [[Teso language|Teso]] ''-r'') which he takes to appear in the pronouns ''yer'' and ''wor'', intransitive/passive ''-a'' (cf. [[Teso language|Teso]] ''-o'').{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}

The most striking of the Mande similarities listed by Creissels are the third person pronouns ''a'' sg. (pan-Mande ''a''), ''i'' pl. (pan-Mande ''i'' or ''e''), the demonstratives ''wo'' "this" (cf. Manding ''o'', ''wo'') and ''no'' "there" (cf. Soninke ''no'', other Mande ''na''), the negative ''na'' (found in a couple of Manding dialects) and negative perfect ''mana'' (cf. Manding ''má'', ''máŋ''), the subjunctive ''ma'' (cf. Manding ''máa''), the copula ''ti'' (cf. Bisa ''ti'', Manding ''de/le''), the verbal connective ''ka'' (cf. Manding ''kà''), the suffixes ''-ri'' (resultative - cf. Mandinka ''-ri'', Bambara ''-li'' process nouns), ''-ncè'' (ethnonymic, cf. Soninke ''-nke'', Mandinka ''-nka''), ''-anta'' (ordinal, cf. Soninke ''-ndi'', Mandinka ''-njaŋ''...), ''-anta'' (resultative participle, cf. Soninke ''-nte''), ''-endi'' (causative, cf. Soninke, Mandinka ''-ndi''), and the postposition ''ra'' "in" (cf. Manding ''lá'', Soso ''ra''...){{citation needed|date=April 2011}}

==Grammar==
Songhay is mostly a [[Tone (linguistics)|tonal]], [[Subject–object–verb|SOV]] group of languages, an exception being the divergent [[Koyra Chiini language|Koyra Chiini]] of Timbuktu, which is non-tonal and uses [[Subject–verb–object|SVO]] order.

Songhay has a morpheme ''-ndi'' which marks either the causative or the agentless passive. Verbs can even take two instances of the morpheme, one for each meaning. Thus ''ŋa-ndi-ndi'' figuratively translates to "[the rice] was made to be eaten [by someone: causee] [by someone: causer]".&lt;ref&gt;Shopen, T. &amp; Konaré, M. 1970.

'''Superstar''' is someone who has great popular appeal and is widely known, prominent, or successful in some field. Celebrities referred to as "superstars" may include individuals who work as [[actor]]s, [[musician]]s, [[athlete]]s, and other media-based professions.

==Origin of term==

[[File:CycloneTaylor2.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Cyclone Taylor|Frederick Wellington "Cyclone" Taylor]] - the world's first designated "Superstar."]]

[[File:Mary Woronov by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|upright|In the 1960s and 1970s [[Andy Warhol]] popularized the term "[[Warhol Superstar|Superstar]]" to describe people like actress [[Mary Woronov]], star of ''[[Chelsea Girls]]'', who started out dancing with [[The Velvet Underground]]. See also [[Warhol Superstar]].]]
The origin of the term in the context of celebrity is uncertain, but a similar expression is attested in ''[[The Cricketers of My Time]]'', a famous [[cricket]] book by [[John Nyren]] about the [[Hambledon Club]].  Writing in 1832, Nyren described the outstanding 18th-century batsman [[John Small (cricketer)|John Small]] as "a star of the first magnitude".&lt;ref name=JN&gt;John Nyren, ''The Cricketers of my Time'', Robson, 1998, p.57.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest use of the term "superstar" has been credited to [[Frank Patrick (ice hockey)|Frank Patrick]] in reference to the great hockey players on his [[Vancouver Millionaires]] teams of the 1910s-1920s, specifically [[Cyclone Taylor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehockeynews.com/articles/40778-Vancouver-brothers-sculpted-game-of-hockey-100-years-before-Canucks-vied-for-cup.html|title=Vancouver brothers sculpted game of hockey 100 years before Canucks vied for cup - The Hockey News|first=The Canadian|last=Press|date=|website=thehockeynews.com|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within a major published piece in [[Interview Magazine]] that appeared in June 1977, when asked by  editor [[Glenn O’Brien]], “Who invented the word superstar?” [[Andy Warhol]], the pop artist known for popularizing the term, responded, “I think it was [the performance artist and filmmaker] [[Jack Smith (film director)|Jack Smith]].” O’Brien then asked, “And who were the first superstars?” To which Warhol responded, “They were all [[Jack Smith (film director)|Jack Smith]]’s stars; every one of them was really a great person.”&lt;ref&gt;O’Brien, Glenn (June 1977). {{cite web |url=https://www.interviewmagazine.com/art/andy-warhol |title=Andy Warhol.}} Interview Magazine.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term received widespread and commonplace use from the title of the musical [[Jesus Christ Superstar]], in particular the 1970 concept album of the musical and the eponymous hit song.

"Super Star" is the name of a hugely successful rose  which Harry Wheatcroft introduced and named in 1960, licensed from a German developer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.countrygardenroses.co.uk/shop/view/312-Super-Star-Hybrid-Tea-Rose|title=Super Star (Hybrid Tea Rose)|author=|date=|website=www.countrygardenroses.co.uk|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Early 1900s: development of the Hollywood "star system"==

{{Main|Star system (filmmaking)}}
By 1909, the silent film companies began promoting "picture personalities" by releasing stories about these actors to fan magazines and newspapers, as part of a strategy to build "brand loyalty" for their company's actors and films. By the 1920s, Hollywood film company promoters had developed a "massive industrial enterprise" that "... peddled a new intangible—fame."&lt;ref name="webcache.googleusercontent.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adidem.org/articles/MF1.html |title=? |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020323005903/http://www.adidem.org/articles/MF1.html |archivedate=March 23, 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hollywood "image makers" and promotional agents planted rumours, selectively released real or fictitious biographical information to the press, and used other "gimmicks" to create personas for actors. Then they "...worked [to] reinforce that persona [and] manage the publicity." Publicists thus "created" the "enduring images" and public perceptions of screen legends such as Rock Hudson, Marilyn Monroe and Grace Kelly. The development of this "star system" made "fame... something that could be fabricated purposely, by the masters of the new 'machinery of glory.'"&lt;ref name="webcache.googleusercontent.com"/&gt;

==1970s: Academic interest in stardom==
 [[File:Undertaker with Fire.jpg|thumb|[[The Undertaker]], the longest tenured and one of the most famous [[WWE]] [[List_of_WWE_personnel|Superstars]].]]
According to Sofia Johansson the "canonical texts on stardom" include articles by Boorstin (1971), Alberoni (1972) and Dyer (1979) that examined the "representations of stars and on aspects of the [[Hollywood]] star system." Johansson notes that "more recent analyses within media and cultural studies (e.g. Gamson 1994; Marshall 1997; Giles 2000; Turner, Marshall and Bonner 2000; Rojek 2001; Turner 2004) have instead dealt with the idea of a pervasive, contemporary, '[[celebrity culture]]'." In the analysis of the 'celebrity culture,' "fame and its constituencies are conceived of as a broader social process, connected to widespread economic, political, technological and cultural developments."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Editorial |first=Sofia |last=Johansson |work=Communication and Media Research Institute of the University of Westminster |url=http://www.wmin.ac.uk/mad/pdf/Sofia.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976 [[Mattel|Mattel, Inc.]] produced a Superstar concept of its Barbie™ Doll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbxLVdUltiI|title=1976 Superstar Barbie Doll Commercial Full Length High Quality|first=|last=BarbieCollectors|date=22 December 2008|publisher=|accessdate=2 April 2018|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1980s–1990s: publicity tactics==

In the 1980s and 1990s, entertainment publicity tactics have become "more subtle and sophisticated", such as using press releases, movie "junkets, and community activities. These promotional efforts are targeted and designed using market research, "to increase the predictability of success of their media ventures." In some cases, publicity agents may create "provocative advertisements" or make an outrageous public statement to "trigger public controversy and thereby generate "free" news coverage."&lt;ref name="webcache.googleusercontent.com"/&gt;

==Socio-psychological theories==
[[File:Katy Perry - Part Of Me Australian Premiere - June 2012 (24).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Katy Perry]] 'Part Of Me' movie premiere in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]]. She is an American singer and the latest superstar. Some of her music videos have been [[List of most viewed YouTube videos|viewed over a billion times on Youtube]].]]

According to [[Roger Caillois]], superstars are created by the interplay between "mass media, free enterprise, and competition." Superstars are produced by a mixture of effort by the actors or athletes and chance (the luck of winning, due to the many arbitrary factors influencing sports, film releases, etc.). The "superstar has extraordinary natural talent augmented by an even more extraordinary perseverance and drive."
[[File:Psy performing Gangnam Style at the Future Music Festival 2013.jpg|thumb|left|Musician Park Jae-sang (stage name [[Psy|PSY]]) of [[South Korea]] was referred to as "globalstar". One of his [[List of most viewed YouTube videos|videos was viewed over 2.2 billion times on YouTube]], the highest views recorded in YouTube's history.]]
However, "small and relative differences are of decisive importance for winning or losing by a hair's breadth." It is here that chance plays a role; a sudden gust of wind at the end of  a yachting race can mean the difference between stardom and defeat.  Caillois notes that the role of chance in superstardom is paradoxical, given that the west is such a "predominantly meritocratic society," which valorizes the role of work, competition, activity, and determination.&lt;ref name=Diogenes48&gt;{{cite journal |title=Roger Caillois, Games of Chance and the Superstar |journal=[[Diogenes (journal)|Diogenes]] |author=Loek Groot |volume=48/2 |issue=190 |pages=33 |year=2000 |publisher=[[ICPHS]] /[[Blackwell Publishers]] |url=http://www2.econ.uu.nl/users/l.groot/Caillois&amp;superstars.pdf |accessdate=7 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005133830/http://www2.econ.uu.nl/users/l.groot/Caillois%26superstars.pdf |archivedate=5 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"[Since] only one may be first. [a person may] choose to win indirectly, through identification with someone else"- the superstar, whose triumph as the most popular actor or hit recording artist is in part due to the actions of "... those who worship the hero". The public believes that "the manicurist elected Beauty Queen, by the sales girl entrusted with the heroine's role in a super production, by the shopkeeper's daughter winning the [[Tour de France]], [and] by the gas station attendant who basks in the limelight as a champion toreador" represents the chance or possibility, from the public's perspective, that they may become wealthy and successful.&lt;ref name=Diogenes48/&gt; For example, Levine points out that "[[Lars Ulrich]], the drummer for [[Metallica]], was a service station attendant before becoming a rich rock star; [[Harrison Ford]] was a cabinet maker" before becoming a wealthy film star.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dklevine.com/general/intellectual/mpaa.htm |title=Who wins and who loses? |authors=[[Michele Boldrin]] and [[David K. Levine]]|publisher=dklevine.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Caillois calls  superstars' huge incomes and rewards "disguised lotteries", a "special kind of game of chance." For example, the grand prizes for literary competitions "bring fortune and glory to a writer, for several years." Caillois notes that a "superstar" cannot merely be successful at some activity; they must also be richly rewarded. He says that the "material reward of the superstar is a necessary ingredient (for the glory of the star) for the identification of the public with the star, or whether it is the excellence or the private life of the star which is of more importance." He states that superstars' extravagant incomes play an important psychological  "compensating mechanism" role for the public.&lt;ref name=Diogenes48/&gt;

According to Madow, "fame is a "relational" phenomenon, something that is conferred by others. A person can, within the limits of his natural talents, make himself strong or swift or learned. But he cannot, in this same sense, make himself famous, any more than he can make himself loved." Madow goes on to point out that "fame is often conferred or withheld, just as love is, for reasons and on grounds other than "merit." This means that regardless of how "... strenuously the star may ... try to "monitor" and "shape" it, the media and the public always play a substantial part in the image-making process."&lt;ref name="webcache.googleusercontent.com"/&gt;

==Economics of "superstars"==
[[File:Jackie Chan Cannes.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Jackie Chan]] at the [[2008 Cannes Film Festival]]. He is one of the most well known Chinese people in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://businessofcinema.com/bollywood-news/isivaji-the-bossi-set-to-release-on-friday/|title=Sivaji: The Boss set to release on Friday - Businessofcinema.com|author=|date=14 June 2007|website=businessofcinema.com|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Sherwin Rosen (1981) examined the economics of superstars to determine why "relatively small numbers of people earn enormous amounts of money and seem to dominate the fields in which they engage." Rosen argues that in superstar markets, "small differences in talent at the top of the distribution will translate into large differences in revenue."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;super star: Rajabaskar is the real super star. The Market for Rock Concerts in the Material World. [[Alan B. Krueger]], [[Princeton University]] and [[NBER]] April 12, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Rosen points out that "...sellers of higher talent charge only slightly higher prices than those of lower talent, but sell much larger quantities; their greater earnings come overwhelmingly from selling larger quantities than from charging higher prices"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Competition and Market Power in Broadcasting: Where Are The Rents? |author=Paul Seabright and Helen Weeds |year=2006 |url=http://www.essex.ac.uk/~hfweeds/SeabrightWeeds_paper.pdf |publisher=essex.ac.uk }}{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern microconomist Alfred Marshall explains that technology has greatly extended the power and reach of the planet's most gifted performers. He referenced a classical of the British opera singer [[Elizabeth Billington]]. She was a well-acclaimed soprano with a strong voice, that, naturally did not have access to a microphone or amplifier in 1798, let alone to MTV, CDs, iTunes, and Pandora. She could only reach a small audience. This limited her ability to dominate the market in the way that artists to do today. Marshall wrote, “so long as the number of persons who can be reached by a human voice is strictly limited, it is not very likely that any singer will make an advance on the £10,000 said to have been earned in a season by Mrs. Billington at the beginning of the last century, nearly as great [an increase] as that which the business leaders of the present generation have made on those of the last.” Furthermore, the trends in popular music indicate that "the price of the average concert ticket increased by nearly 400% from 1981 to 2012, much faster than the 150% rise in overall consumer price inflation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Land of Hope and Dreams: Rock and Roll, Economics, and Rebuilding the Middle Class |author=Alan Krueger |year=2013 |url= http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/06/12/rock-and-roll-economics-and-rebuilding-middle-class}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Debate over superstardom===

Some scholars argue that superstardom has a useful role in society. Caillois cites Rawls, who states that the "premiums earned by scarce natural talents . . . [serve] to cover the costs of training and to encourage the efforts of learning, as well as to direct ability to where it best furthers the common interest."&lt;ref name=Diogenes48/&gt; Cowen (2000) cites Rosen (1981) to argue that "the superstars effect is welfare-improving (consumers get better performances) even if it leads to raising [[income inequality]]," and adds that the "superstar phenomenon should not be overstressed. Indeed, fame is a positive-sum game, not a negative nor a zero-sum one." Cowen states that "countervailing forces operate, such as a convergence of quality that limits the ability of the very best stars to dominate the market for long, or more radically the elastic supply of fame." This means that "when demand for fame increases, the numbers of prizes, rewards and whatever fame generating distinctions is rising too."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.colloque2002symposium.gouv.qc.ca/PDF/Menger_paper_Symposium.pdf#search=%22superstar%20economic%20rationale%22 |title="Statistics in the Wake of Challenges Posed by Cultural Diversity in a Globalization Context"|author=Pierre-Michel Menger |work=Centre de Sociologie du Travail et des Arts Paris, France |publisher=gouv.qc.ca |accessdate=7 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, it has been argued "compensation systems that resemble prizes [lotteries] can also create [[perverse incentive]]s by discouraging cooperative behaviour and may encourage some contestants to disrupt the performance of competitors".&lt;ref name="http"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/0070891540/student_view0/chapter13/chapter_notes.html |title=? |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040816080235/http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/0070891540/student_view0/chapter13/chapter_notes.html |archivedate=2004-08-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As well, Frank and Cook (1995) have called "into question the way the winner-take-all markets operate, with their damaging features." They argue that the "winner-take-all payoff structure [of competition for superstardom] generates a spiral of individual and social occupational waste, since it leads both to increasing (monetary and non-monetary) reward inequalities and to overcrowdings in the markets and occupations prone to an overestimation of one's chance to succeed." Thus as a result, they argue that "when excess numbers of contestants are induced to invest in performance enhancement in order to raise their individual odds of winning, these investments will be mutually offsetting and socially inefficient; end consumers may get more valuable products but the social costs are excessive."

==Other meanings==

==="Superstar" art museums===
A small number of major art museums, including Frank Lloyd Wright's Guggenheim Museum in New York, the Centre Pompidou in Paris, Frank Gehry's Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, among others, have become household names and major tourist destinations. Art museums such as these, with their striking, architecturally designed buildings and very well known masterpieces can be termed "superstar" art museums.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.iew.unizh.ch/home/smeier/downloads/Museum_Survey.pdf |title=? |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060519094354/http://www.iew.unizh.ch/home/smeier/downloads/Museum_Survey.pdf |archivedate=2006-05-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; With their huge visitor traffic, superstar museums are often able to derive a significant income from museum bookshops and restaurants and have a "major impact on the local economy".&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Superstar museums are able to use the popular appeal of their location and art holdings to produce their own books, videos, and television specials, which adds an additional revenue stream and further reinforces the public's awareness of the museum. Some superstar museums have also begun establishing museum networks. For example, London's Tate Gallery has launched satellite art museums at Liverpool and St. Ives.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Cultural institutions such as art museums play a "gatekeeping role" for consumers, helping to screen and grade the cultural artifacts and artworks, thus "reduc[ing] information and search costs" for consumers. Moreover, "by channelling resources to a limited group of visual artists, cultural institutions also enhance superstar phenomena within the visual arts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://https |title=? |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130819141428/http://https/ |archivedate=2013-08-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Superstar CEOs===
McGraw-Hill's economic website argues that the multimillion-dollar salaries of superstar Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) in the corporate world can be viewed as a type of tournament prize.  The huge salaries of superstar executives "often seem to resemble prizes for the winners of contests rather than compensation in return for the value of the marginal product of labour." As an example, "a company may have many vice-presidents of roughly comparable ability and the v-p (who may only be slightly more talented than the others) that is promoted to president receives a huge salary increase, which resembles a prize for winning the contest as best v-p."&lt;ref name="http"/&gt;

The article goes on to argue that "...such a compensation system may be efficient if the organization is only able to rank its executives according to the relative value of their contribution to the organization (the organization cannot measure the productivity of each executive, only the productivity of the group of executives)." Moreover, "even if executives are paid a wage equal to the average productivity of the group, there will still be an incentive to perform in order be promoted and win the prize." However, "compensation systems that resemble prizes can also create perverse incentives by discouraging cooperative behaviour and may encourage some contestants to disrupt the performance of competitors"&lt;ref name="http"/&gt;

'''''The Pillowman''''' is a 2003 play by Irish playwright [[Martin McDonagh]]. It received its first public reading in an early version at the [[Finborough Theatre]], London, in 1995. It tells the tale of Katurian, a fiction writer living in a [[police state]], who is interrogated about the gruesome content of his [[short stories]] and their similarities to a number of bizarre child murders occurring in his town. The play received the 2004 [[Olivier Award]] for Best New Play, the 2004-5 [[New York Drama Critics' Circle]] Award for Best New Foreign Play, and two [[Tony Awards]] for production. It was nominated for the 2004 [[Evening Standard Award]] for Best New Play.

==Summary==
Katurian, a writer of short stories that often depict violence against children, has been arrested by two detectives, Ariel and Tupolski, because some of his stories resemble recent child murders. When he hears that his brother Michal has confessed to the murders and implicated Katurian, he resigns himself to being executed but attempts to save his stories from destruction. The play contains both narrations and reenactments of several of Katurian's stories, including the autobiographical "The Writer and the Writer's Brother", which tells how Katurian developed his disturbed imagination by hearing the sounds of Michal being tortured by their parents.

==Characters==
'''Katurian:''' A writer of gruesome short stories often involving children. His disturbed imagination was the result of having heard his brother being abused when they were younger. Consequently, he killed his parents and looked after his brother. He is shocked by his arrest.

'''Michal:''' Katurian's brother, who is "slow to get things" following his years of abuse at the hands of his parents. He is also taken into jail along with Katurian.

'''Tupolski:''' The lead detective and the "good cop" in the interrogation. Cold and uncaring, he sees himself as detached from the people he aims to save, shocking his younger partner Ariel.

'''Ariel:''' A brutal and violent detective who has a vendetta against anyone who commits crimes against children because of abuse in his own past. He ends up being more sympathetic toward Katurian and his stories than Tupolski is.

Minor characters include the parents/[[Foster care|foster parents]], The Little Jesus (girl), and a boy.

==Plot==

===Act I===

Scene 1: Ariel and Tupolski interrogate Katurian in a police room. At first Katurian does not know why he is being questioned, and thinks he is under suspicion of running political messages against the totalitarian dictatorship through his stories. The detectives and Katurian discuss grisly stories involving children. Ariel leaves the room, and soon after Michal is heard screaming in the next room. Ariel returns, his hand covered in blood from apparently torturing Michal, and tells Katurian that Michal has just confessed to killing three children, in association with Katurian. The first two children were murdered according to the patterns of the stories "The Little Apple Men" and "The Tale of the Town on the River." Katurian denies the allegations, stating that although his stories are gruesome it is the job of a storyteller to tell a story.

Scene 2: Katurian was raised by loving parents who encouraged him to write, and for many years he wrote very happy stories. However, at night he began to hear sounds of torture from the next room, and as a result he began to write more disturbing stories. One night, a note is slipped under the door, claiming that Katurian's brother has been tortured nightly for seven years as part of an artistic experiment to get Katurian to become a great writer. Katurian breaks down the door, only to find his parents, who were playing a trick on him, pretending to be torturing a child. However, when Katurian returns years later, he discovers his brother's dead body hidden under the mattress, clutching the manuscript of a beautiful story, better than any of Katurian's, which Katurian burns. Katurian interrupts his narrative to say that this ending was fabricated when he wrote the story: when he broke down the door, he found Michal still alive. Katurian smothered his parents with a pillow that very night in vengeance for his disabled brother and the abuse he suffered.

===Act II===
Scene 1: Katurian and Michal are together in a cell, Katurian just having been tortured. Michal reveals that he had not been tortured, but rather cooperated entirely with Ariel, even screaming when Ariel asked him to. At Michal's request, Katurian tells him the story of "The Pillowman", about a man made of pillows who convinces children to kill themselves so they can be spared a horrible future. Michal admits to having killed the children, claiming that Katurian told him to do it by telling his stories. Michal says that he murdered the third child after hearing Katurian's story "The Little Jesus", one of his most violent. Michal tells Katurian that he had read the written version of "The Writer and the Writer's Brother", and resented the changes from their lives, wishing that Katurian had written a happy ending for the two brothers. Katurian lulls Michal to sleep by telling him the story "The Little Green Pig", then smothers him to save him the pain of being executed. Katurian calls to the detectives, announcing his intention to confess to the crimes on the condition that his stories are preserved. 

Scene 2: Katurian tells the others the story of the Little Jesus, which was thought to inspire the third murder. A young girl believes that she is the second coming of Jesus, and blesses unsavory characters, to the dismay of her parents and annoyance of others. When her parents are killed in a horrific accident, she is sent to live with abusive foster parents. Annoyed by her pretensions, the foster parents crucify her and bury her alive so that she might rise again in three days, but she does not.

==Katurian's stories==
; ''The Little Apple Men''
Told briefly in I.i, and re-enacted in the first child murder. A young girl, whose father mistreats her, carves a set of little men out of apples. She gives them to her father, telling him to save them rather than eat them. He scoffs at her, and eats several. The apple has razor blades inside, which kill the father. At night the remaining apple men accuse the girl of killing their brothers, and jump down her throat to kill her.

; ''The Three Gibbet Crossroads''
Told in I.i. A man wakes up in an iron [[gibbet]], aware that he has committed the crime he is being punished for, but unaware of what the crime was. He sees two other gibbets, one marked ''Murderer'' and the other marked ''Rapist''. Several people come by who have sympathy for the murderer and the rapist, but express disgust for the first man after reading the sign that identifies his crime. Still ignorant of his crime, the man is shot by a highwayman.

; ''The Tale of the Town on the River''
Told in I.i, and reenacted in the second murder. A young boy, mistreated by his parents, offers a strange dark rider a piece of his meal. Touched, the rider presents him a gift: he chops off the child's toes. The conclusion of the story relates that the rider was the [[The Pied Piper of Hamelin|Pied Piper on his way to Hamelin]] to take away the children. Since he crippled the boy, the latter could not keep up with the other children, and was the only child in town to survive. 

; ''The Pillowman''
Told in II.i. The Pillowman visits people on the verge of suicide because of the tortured lives they have suffered. He travels back in time to the person's childhood and convinces them to commit suicide, thereby avoiding the life of suffering. This task saddens the Pillowman, however, and he decides to visit his own younger self, who readily commits suicide. This relieves the Pillowman's sadness, but also causes all the children he saved to live out their miserable lives and eventually die alone.

; ''The Little Green Pig''
Told in II.i. Katurian's most juvenile story, but also the only one devoid of violence. A green pig, who enjoys his peculiar colouring, is mocked by the other pigs. The farmers use a special permanent paint to make the pig pink just like all the others. The pig prays to God to keep his peculiarity, and can't understand why God ignored his prayers. Soon after, however, a magic green rain falls that makes all the other pigs green, and since the little pig retains his pink colour, he is once again "a little bit peculiar".

; ''The Little Jesus''
Reenacted in II.ii, and originally thought to be the source for the third murder. A young girl believes that she is the second coming of [[Jesus]], and goes about blessing unsavory characters, to the dismay of her parents and the annoyance of others. When her parents are killed in a horrific accident, she is sent to live with abusive foster parents. Annoyed with her pretensions of divinity, the foster parents complete her performance of Jesus' life by torturing her, crucifying her, and burying her alive so that she might rise again in three days. She doesn't but three days later a man walks through the woods close to the girls grave. He fails to hear the scratching of her nails on the wood on her coffin, and does not see the fresh grave because - like a man the girl tried to heal - he is blind.

; ''The Writer and the Writer's Brother''
This story is partially autobiographical. A boy, raised by loving parents who encouraged him to write, wrote happy stories for many years. Then, at night, he begins hearing sounds of torture from the next room, and as a result he began to write more disturbing stories. One night, a note is slipped under the door, claiming that the boy's brother has been tortured nightly for seven years as part of an artistic experiment to get the boy to become a great writer. He breaks down the door, only to find his parents, who were playing a trick on him, just pretending to be torturing a child. However, when he returns years later, he discovers his brother's dead body hidden under the mattress, clutching the manuscript of a beautiful story, better than any of his, which he burns.  Later in Act II Katurian tells Michal that in the story, the character Michal was the true "writer" of the title, whereas his own character was merely the brother.

; ''The Shakespeare Room''
Michal mentions this story to illustrate the fact that Katurian's work, in general, tends to be dark and twisted. Unlike the others, it is not narrated, acted out, or summarized in great detail. Michal gives the following brief synopsis of the story: instead of being the literary genius the world thinks him to be, William Shakespeare does not pen his own plays; instead, whenever he wants something written, he jabs a little pygmy woman who he keeps in a box and she, in turn, composes a play for him (Shakespeare takes the credit).

; ''The Face Basement''
An unnamed, sadistic character chops off the faces of his (undescribed) victims, puts them in a jar, and keeps them in his basement. As with "The Shakespeare Room", this story is mentioned by Michal only in passing.

==Inspiration==
''The Pillowman'' stemmed in part from McDonagh's experience composing fairy tales, with names such as The Chair and the Wolfboy, The Short Fellow and the Strange Frog, and The Violin and the Drunken Angel, early in his writing career. Attempting to rewrite fairy tales he remembered from childhood, he realized that "there's something dark about them that doesn't quite come through."

In a conversation with Irish drama critic [[Fintan O'Toole]] in ''[[BOMB Magazine]]'' in 1998, McDonagh retold the [[Brothers Grimm]] version of [[Little Red Riding Hood]]. The wolf's stomach is filled with rocks and sewn with green wire, leading to the wolf's death. McDonagh's comment—"I would love to write something as horrific as that if I could"—indicates a potential inspiration for the story "The Little Apple Men" in ''The Pillowman''.&lt;ref&gt;O'Toole, Fintan. [http://bombsite.com/issues/63/articles/2146 "Martin McDonagh"]. ''BOMB Magazine''. Spring 1998. Retrieved 25 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

This play has been described as borrowing from ''[[Closet Land]]'' (1991), an independent film written and directed by Indian filmmaker [[Radha Bharadwaj]], which starred [[Madeleine Stowe]] and [[Alan Rickman]].&lt;ref&gt;Mielke, Bob. "Rebel With a Cause: Radha Bharadwaj's Maverick Masterpiece," ''Toad Suck Review, No. 4''. 2014. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Commenting on this, Bob Mielke, Ph.D, Professor of English at [[Truman State University]], said that "plot elements of ''Closet Land'' persist in another narrative host body, another way in which this text persists and haunts (if you will) our culture."&lt;ref&gt;Professor Mielke, Bob. [http://closetland.com/category/essays/ "Radha Bharadwaj, Perfect Traveler."] Archived on ''Radha Bharadwaj Official Website.'' 23 February 2014.

'''Triple Award Science''' is the name for a course in the United Kingdom which delivers three separate [[GCSE]]s in Biology, Chemistry and Physics although it's commonly referred to as "Triple Science".

The course is usually studied throughout Years 10 and 11 (Years 11 and 12 in Northern Ireland) but may be started in the later stages of Year 9 (Year 10 in Northern Ireland). The course provides the broadest coverage of the main three science subjects at [[Key Stage 4]] available, and incorporates the compulsory programme of study for Science.

The course is offered by the five main awarding bodies in the United Kingdom; [[Assessment and Qualifications Alliance|AQA]], [[Edexcel]], [[OCR (examination board)|OCR]], [[Cambridge International Examinations|CIE]] and [[WJEC (exam board)|WJEC]]. In Northern Ireland the awarding board is [[Council for the Curriculum, Examinations &amp; Assessment|CCEA]].

There are 3 different types of science:
*Chemistry 
*Biology 
*Physics

==OCR==
[[OCR (examination board)|OCR]] have awarded a Triple Science award since 2007 through their 21st Century Science program. The course aims to develop scientific literacy.

For the 2012 specifications, OCR's singular award science has 3 modules of work. In their double award there are 6 modules. Their Triple Science Award has 7 modules for each science, which are made up of the six modules from double award and an extra one module from each science.
* The Biology module is called "Biology across the Ecosystem"
* The Chemistry module is called "Chemistry for a Sustainable World"
* The Physics module is called "Observing the Universe".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.21stcenturyscience.org/the-courses/triple-science,1423,NA.html&lt;/ref&gt;

All of the exam boards offering triple science have new specifications with first examinations in June 2018. Many schools will begin teaching this to their year 9 in 2015-16. Other schools will begin teaching the new specifications to year 10 in September 2016.

Ugaritic has been called "the greatest literary discovery from antiquity since the deciphering of the [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]] and [[cuneiform script|Mesopotamian cuneiform]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gordon|first=Cyrus H.|authorlink=Cyrus H. Gordon|title=The Ancient Near East|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ooY2vgAACAAJ|year=1965|publisher=Norton|page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corpus==
The Ugaritic language is attested in texts from the 14th through the 12th century BC. The city of Ugarit was destroyed roughly 1190 BC.&lt;ref name="Huehnergard2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Huehnergard|first=John|authorlink=John Huehnergard|title=An Introduction to Ugaritic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IfHQx5FUZW8C|year=2012|publisher=Hendrickson Publishers|isbn=978-1-59856-820-2|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Literary texts discovered at Ugarit include the ''[[Legend of Keret]]'', the legends of [[Danel]], the ''Myth of Baal-Aliyan'', and the ''Death of Baal''—the latter two are also collectively known as the ''[[Baal Cycle]]''—all revealing aspects of ancient Northwest Semitic religion.

According to one hypothesis, Ugaritic texts might solve the [[Bible|biblical]] puzzle of the [[anachronism]] of ''[[Ezekiel]]'' mentioning [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]] at {{bibleverse||Ezekiel|14:13-16|nrsv}}; it is because in both Ugaritic and Hebrew texts, it is correctly ''Danel''.&lt;ref name=solve /&gt;

==Writing system==
{{Main|Ugaritic alphabet}}
[[Image:22 alphabet.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Clay tablet of Ugaritic alphabet]]
[[Image:Ugaritic Chart of Letters.svg|right|thumb|250px|Table of Ugaritic alphabet]]
The [[Ugaritic alphabet]] is a [[cuneiform script]] used beginning in the 15th century BC. Like most Semitic scripts, it is an [[abjad]], where each symbol stands for a consonant, leaving the reader to supply the appropriate vowel.

Although it appears similar to Mesopotamian cuneiform (whose writing techniques it borrowed), its symbols and symbol meanings are unrelated. It is the oldest example of the family of West Semitic scripts such as the [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]], [[Paleo-Hebrew alphabet|Paleo-Hebrew]], and [[Aramaic alphabet]]s (including the [[Hebrew alphabet]]). The so-called "long alphabet" has 30 letters while the "short alphabet" has 22. Other languages (particularly [[Hurrian language|Hurrian]]) were occasionally written in it in the Ugarit area, although not elsewhere.

[[Clay tablet]]s written in Ugaritic provide the earliest evidence of both the Levantine ordering of the alphabet, which gave rise to the alphabetic order of the [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]], [[Greek alphabet|Greek]], and [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] alphabets; and the South Semitic order, which gave rise to the order of the [[Ge'ez script]]. The script was written from left to right.

==Phonology==
Ugaritic had 28 consonantal [[phoneme]]s (including two [[semivowel]]s) and eight [[vowel]] phonemes (three short vowels and five long vowels): ''a ā i ī u ū ē ō''. The phonemes ''ē'' and ''ō'' occur only as long vowels and are the result of [[monophthongization]] of the [[diphthong]]s ''ay'' and ''aw'', respectively.

==Grammar==
{{Main|Ugaritic grammar}}
Ugaritic is an [[inflection|inflected language]], and its grammatical features are highly similar to those found in [[Classical Arabic]] and [[Akkadian (language)|Akkadian]]. It possesses two [[grammatical gender|genders]] (masculine and feminine), three [[grammatical case]]s for [[noun]]s and [[adjective]]s ([[nominative case|nominative]], [[accusative case|accusative]], and [[genitive case|genitive]]), three [[grammatical number|numbers]] (singular, dual, and plural), and [[grammatical aspect|verb aspects]] similar to those found in other [[Northwest Semitic languages|Northwest Semitic]] languages. The [[word order]] for Ugaritic is [[verb–subject–object]] (VSO) and [[subject–object–verb]] (SOV),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilson|first1=Gerald H.|title=Ugaritic Word Order and Sentence Structure in KRT|journal=Journal of Semitic Studies|date=1982|volume=27|issue=1|pages=17–32|doi=10.1093/jss/27.1.17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[possession (linguistics)|possessed–possessor]] (NG), and [[noun]]–[[adjective]] (NA). Ugaritic is considered a conservative Semitic language, since it retains most of the [[Proto-Semitic language#Phonology|phonemes]], the case system, and the word order of the ancestral [[Proto-Semitic language]].

'''Ukrainians in Russia''' make up the largest single [[Ukrainian diaspora | diaspora group]] of the [[Ukrainians | Ukrainian people]]. In 2010 1.9 million Ukrainians lived in [[Russia]], representing over 1.4% of the total population of the [[Russian Federation]] and comprising the third-largest ethnic group - after ethnic [[Russians]] and [[Tatars]]. An estimated 340,000 people born in Ukraine (mostly youths) permanently settle legally in Russia each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|format= PDF|url=http://www.migrationpolicycentre.eu/docs/migration_profiles/Ukraine.pdf|title= MPC Migration Profile: Ukraine|work= European University institute, Migration Policy Centre|date= June 2013|accessdate= 27 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Early history===
Grand Prince of Kiev [[Vladimir II Monomakh]] founded the principality of [[Vladimir-Suzdal]], and his son [[Yuri Dolgoruki]] founded the city of [[Moscow]] in 1147. However, by the end of the 12th century the prominence of [[Rus' people|Rus']] began to decline as Kiev's central role became disputed by the surrounding principalities which were increasingly more powerful and independent. Dolgoruki's son [[Andrei I Bogolyubsky]] plundered Kiev in 1169, an event that allowed the Principality of Vladimir-Suzdal to take a leading role as the predecessor of the modern Russian state.

The sacking of Kiev itself in December 1240 during the [[Mongol invasion of Rus|Mongol Invasion]] led to the ultimate collapse of the Rus' state. For many of its residents, the brutality of Mongol attacks sealed the fate of many choosing to find safe haven in the North East. In 1299, the Kievan [[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan]] Chair was moved to [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]] by Metropolitan [[Maximus, Metropolitan of all Rus|Maximus]], keeping the titile ''of Kiev''. As Vladimir-Suzdal, and later the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] continued to grow unhindered, the Orthodox religious link between them and Kiev remained strong. Envoys continued to be sent to Moscow from the [[Kiev Pechersk Lavra]]. Professional artisans, builders, craftsmen and lay-people also traveled to Moscow where they could more easily earn a living.

The Southern Ruthenians found themselves within a new state of [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]. After the union of [[Jogaila]] and [[Kingdom of Poland (1385–1569)|Kingdom of Poland]] in 1386 this state became officially Catholic in leadership. This isolated its majority Orthodox population, and soon many notable Ruthenian leaders began to leave for Moscow. In 1408 a group of nobles led by [[Švitrigaila]] along with the [[Chernihiv]] bishop together with a significant group of soldiers defected to Moscow. Others followed. Trade though initially sporadic, traveling through Chernihiv and [[Putyvl]].

The frequent [[Russo-Lithuanian Wars]] meant that in 1448, Moscow [[Jonah Metropolitan of Moscow|Metropolitan Jonah]], despite of the fall of [[Byzantium]], achieved full [[Autocephaly]] for the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]. The title ''of Kiev'' remained with the Kievan Metropolia, which was under the jurisdiction of the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]].

The emigration to the [[Tsardom of Russia]] continued to grow in the 16th century. Prominent examples include [[Michael Glinski]] who staged a [[Glinski Rebellion|powerful rebellion against Lithuanian rule]] in February 1508 all those that took part in the uprising, who would receive a [[boyar]] title along with villages and lands around [[Medyn]] for settlement. In the mid-16th century the [[Hetmans of Ukrainian Cossacks|Ukrainian Hetman]] [[Dmytro Vyshnevetsky]] visited Moscow where he served in the court of Tsar [[Ivan IV]] and received in return the city of [[Belyov]] on the river [[Tula, Russia|Tula]] and surrounding villages and homesteads as rewards. Trade also grew considerably in this period, and many Ukrainian [[Sloboda]]s were founded in Russian cities.

Many Ukrainian settlers settled in areas that lay between the old [[Zasechnaya cherta]] and the new defence line that would guard Russia from the frequent raids by the [[Nogay Horde|Nogais]] and the [[Crimean Khanate|Crimean Tatars]]. This became known as [[Sloboda Ukraine]], and initial forts, such as [[Kursk]], [[Voronezh]] and [[Kharkiv]] were founded and settled by Ukrainian peasants that served the garrisons stationed there. According to the writings of the English trader D. Fletcher in 1588, these garrison towns had 4300 soldiers of which 4000 had come from Ukraine. The number of Ukrainian settlers in the southern borders of Russia increased after the unsuccessful revolts against the Poles. As a result, the bulk of the population became mixed.

===17th and 18th centuries===
After the [[Treaty of Pereyaslav]] of 1654, migration to Russia from Ukraine increased. Initially this was to [[Sloboda Ukraine]], but also to the Don lands and the area of the Volga river. There was also a significant migration to [[Moscow]], particularly by church activists: priests and monks, scholars and teachers, artists, translators, singers and merchants. A colony was built in Moscow called the Malorossiysky dvor. In 1652 12 singers under the direction of [[Ternopolsky]] moved to Moscow, 13 graduates of the [[National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy|Kiev-Mogilla Collegium]] moved to teach the Moscovite gentry. Many priests and church administrators migrated from Ukraine, in particular the established [[Andreyevsky Monastery]] was made up from Ukrainian clergy. This had a great effect on the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], and the policies of [[Patriarch Nikon]] which led to the [[Old Believers|Old Believer]] [[Raskol]] (schism). The influence of Ukrainian clergy continued to grow, especially after 1686, when the Metropolia of Kiev was transferred from the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]] to the [[Patriarch of Moscow]].

Soon after, the abolishment of the Patriarch's chair by [[Peter I of Russia|Peter I]], the Ukrainian [[Stephen Yavorsky]] became Metropolitan of Moscow, followed by [[Feofan Prokopovich]]. [[Demetrius of Rostov]] became of Tobol and Siberia, and from 1704 [[Rostov]] and [[Yaroslavl]]. In all over 70 positions in the Orthodox hierarchy were taken by recent emigres from Kiev. Students of the [[Kiev-Mohyla Collegium]] started up schools and seminaries in many Russian eparchies. By 1750, over 125 such institutions were opened. As a result, these graduates practically controlled the Russian church obtaining key posts there (and holding them to almost the end of the 18th century). Under Prokopovich the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] was opened in 1724 which was chaired from 1746 by Ukrainian [[Kirill Razumovsky]].&lt;ref name=Kargamanov&gt;{{cite web|last=Kagramanov|first=Yuri|url=http://magazines.russ.ru/novyi_mi/2006/8/ka10.html|script-title=ru:Война языков на Украине|trans-title=The War of Languages in Ukraine|journal=Novy Mir|publisher=magazines.russ.ru|year=2006|issue=8|accessdate=27 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Moscow court had a choir established in 1713 with 21 singers from Ukraine. The conductor for a period of time was [[A. Vedel]]. In 1741 44 male, 33 women, and 55 girls were moved to St. Petersburg from Ukraine to sing and entertain. In 1763 the head conductor of the Emperor's court choir was M. Poltoratsky and later [[Dmitry Bortniansky]]. Composer [[Maksym Berezovsky]] also worked in St. Petersburg at the time. A significant Ukrainian presence was also seen in the Academy of Arts.

The Ukrainian presence in the Russian Army also grew significantly. The greatest influx happened after the [[Battle of Poltava]] in 1709. Large numbers of Ukrainians settled around St Petersburg and were employed in the building of the city, the various fortresses and canals.

A separate category of emigrants were those deported to Moscow by the Russian government for demonstrating anti-Russian sentiment. The deported were brought to Moscow initially for investigation, and then exiled to [[Siberia]], [[Arkhangelsk]] or the [[Solovetsky Islands]]. Among the deported were Ukrainian cossack luminaries as D. Mhohohrishny, [[Ivan Samoylovych]] and [[Petro Doroshenko]]. Others include all the family of hetman [[Ivan Mazepa]], A. Vojnarovsky, and those in Mazepa's Cossack forces that returned to Russia.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Some were imprisoned in exile for the rest of their lives such as hetman[[Pavlo Polubotok]], [[Pavlo Holovaty]], P. Hloba and [[Petro Kalnyshevsky]].

===19th century===
[[File:Russia ethnic.JPG|thumb|175px|Ethnic map of European Russia before the [[First World War]]]]
[[File:Green Ukraine - Zeleny Klyn - Russian Federation.jpg|thumb|175px|[[Green Ukraine]] - historical Ukrainian name of the land in the Russian Far East area.]]
Beginning in the 19th century, there was a continuous migration from Belarus, Ukraine and Northern Russia to settle the distant areas of the Russian Empire. The promise of free fertile land was an important factor for many peasants who until 1861, lived under [[Serfdom]]. In the colonization of the new lands, a significant contribution was made by ethnic Ukrainians. Initially Ukrainians colonised border territories in the [[Caucasus]]. Most of these settlers came from [[Left-bank Ukraine]] and [[Slobozhanshchyna]] and mainly settled in the [[Stavropol]], and [[Terek Oblast|Terek]] areas. Some compact areas of the [[Don River (Russia)|Don]], [[Volga]] and [[Urals]] were also settled.

The Ukrainians created large settlements within Russia often becoming the majority in certain centres. They continued fostering their traditions, their language and their architecture. Their village structure and administration differed somewhat from the Russian population that surrounded them.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Kubiyovych (ed) Entsyklopedia Ukrainoznavstva Vol.7, p.2597&lt;/ref&gt; Where populations were mixed, russification often took place.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The size and geographical area of the Ukrainian settlements were first seen in the course of the [[Russian Empire Census|Russian Empire Census of 1897]]. This census noted only language, not ethnicity. Nonetheless a total of 22,380,551 Ukrainian speakers were recorded. Within the European territories of Russia 1,020,000 Ukrainians, in Asia (not including the Caucasus) 209,000 were recorded. From 1897-1914, the intense migration of Ukrainians to the Urals and Asia continued, and was measured to be 1.5 million before ceasing in 1915.

===20th century===
====Formation of Ukrainian borders====
[[File:Ethnic-Ukrainians.jpg|300px|left|thumb|Ethnographic map of Ukraine, showing ethnographic boundaries of ethnic Ukrainians in the early 20th century.]]
The first [[Russian Empire Census]], conducted in 1897 gave statistics regarding language use in the Russian Empire according to the administrative borders. Extensive use of [[Little Russia]]n (and in some cases dominance) was noted in the nine south-western Governorates and the [[Kuban Oblast]].&lt;ref&gt;1897 Census on Demoscope.ru [http://demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/rus_lan_97.php Retrieved] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120528084326/http://demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/rus_lan_97.php |date=28 May 2012 }} on 20 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; When the future borders of the Ukrainian state were marked, the results of the census were taken into consideration. As a result, the ethnographic borders of Ukraine in the 20th century were twice as large as the [[Cossack Hetmanate]] that was incorporated into the Russian Empire in the 17th.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Stanislav|last=Kulchitsky|url=http://www.day.kiev.ua/156240/|script-title=ru:Империя и мы|trans-title=The Empire and We|language=ru|journal=Den|publisher=day.kiev.ua|issue=9|date=26 January 2006|accessdate=19 March 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090617090304/http://www.day.kiev.ua/156240/|archivedate=17 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain regions had mixed populations made up of both Ukrainian and Russian ethnicities as well as other minorities. These include the territory of [[Sloboda Ukraine|Sloboda]] and the [[Donbass]]. These territories were between Ukraine and Russia. This left a large community of ethnic Ukrainians on the Russian side of the border. The borders of the short-lived [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] were largely preserved by the [[Ukrainian SSR]].

In the course of the mid-1920s, the course of administrative reforms some territory, initially under the Ukrainian SSR was ceded to the Russian SFSR, such as the [[Taganrog]] and [[Shakhty]] cities in the eastern Donbass. At the time, the Ukrainian SSR gained several territories that were amalgamated into the [[Sumy Oblast]] in Sloboda region.

====Soviet-era migration====
[[File:Ukrainians in Russian regions 1926.jpg|thumb|250px|Number and share of Ukrainians in the population of the regions of the [[RSFSR]] (1926 census)]]
The [[Soviet Union]] was officially a multicultural country with no official [[national language]].  On paper all languages and cultures were guaranteed state protection Union-wide.  In reality, however, the Ukrainians were granted the opportunity to meaningfully develop their culture only within the administrative borders of the [[Ukrainian SSR|Ukrainian Republic]], where the Ukrainians had a privileged status of being the [[titular nation]]. As many Ukrainians migrated to other parts of the USSR, the cultural separation often led in their assimilation, particularly within [[Russian SFSR|Russia]], which received the highest percentage of the Ukrainian migration. In [[Siberia]], 82% of Ukrainians entered mixed marriages, primarily with Russians. This meant that outside the Ukrainian SSR, there was little or no provision for continuing a diaspora function. As a result, [[Ukrainian literature|Ukrainian-language press]] was soon found only in large cities such as Moscow. Ukrainian cultural attributes such as clothing and national foods were preserved. According to a Soviet sociologist, 27% of the [[Ukrainians in Siberia]] read printed material in Ukrainian and 38% used the Ukrainian language. From time to time, Ukrainian groups would visit Siberia. Nonetheless, most of the Ukrainians there did assimilate.

Due to the fact that Ukrainians were prominent in the [[Gulags]] of [[Norilsk]] and [[Vorkuta]] Ukrainians have continued to be the majority ethnicity in these cities.{{fact|date=October 2017}} Around 80% of the population in Norilsk in 1989 had least one Ukrainian ancestor.{{fact|date=October 2017}}

According to [[Volodymyr Kubiyovych]] and [[Aleksandr Zhukovsky]] the area of Ukrainian ethnic territory outside of the borders of the Ukrainian SSR (1970) where an ethnic Ukrainian majority lived was estimated to be 146,500 square kilometres, and the area of nationally mixed territories make up approximately 747,600 square kilometres.

==Ukrainian life in post-Soviet Russia==
The Ukrainian cultural renaissance in Russia began at the end of the 1980s, with the formation of the [[Slavutych Society]] in Moscow and the Ukrainian Cultural Centre named after T. Shevchenko in [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]] (now Saint Petersburg).

In 1991, the [[Ukraina Society]] organized a conference in [[Kiev]] with delegates from the various new Ukrainian Community organizations of the Eastern Diaspora. By 1991, over 20 such organizations were in existence. By 1992, 600 organizations were registered in Russia alone. The Congress helped to consolidate the efforts of these organizations. From 1992, regional congresses began to take place, organized by the Ukrainian organizations of Prymoria, [[Tyumen Oblast]], Siberia and the Far East. In March 1992, the [[Union of Ukrainian organizations in Moscow]] was founded. In May of that year - The [[Union of Ukrainians in Russia]].

The term "Eastern Diaspora" has been used since 1992 to describe Ukrainians living in the former USSR, as opposed to the [[Western Ukrainian Diaspora]] which was used until then to describe all [[Ukrainian diaspora]] outside the Union. An estimated number of Ukrainians living in the Eastern Diaspora is 6.8 million, and while those in the West is approximately 5 million.
 
In February 2009 about 3.5 million Ukrainian citizens were estimated to be working in the Russian Federation, especially in [[Moscow]] and in the construction industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.unian.info/world/194446-nearly-35-million-ukrainians-work-in-russia.html|title=Nearly 3.5 million Ukrainians work in Russia|publisher=unian.info|date=25 February 2009|accessdate=28 September 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227043840/http://www.unian.info/world/194446-nearly-35-million-ukrainians-work-in-russia.html|archivedate=27 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Volodymyr Yelchenko]], the Ambassador of Ukraine to the Russian Federation there were no state schools in Russia with a program for teaching school subjects in the [[Ukrainian language]] as of August 2010; he considered "the correction of this situation" as one of his top priority tasks.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100822160657/http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/78988 Yelchenko wants Ukrainian secondary school to operate in Moscow], [[Kyiv Post]] (August 19, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2007, the number of Ukrainian illegal immigrants has been estimated as being between 3-11 million. many Ukrainians came illegally so the true number of Russian Ukrainians has been unknown. Many Ukrainians have been viewed as illegal immigrants and criminals, and many complain of [[racism]]. Some have compared this to how Mexicans are viewed in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Franck |last=Düvell |format=PDF |url=https://www.compas.ox.ac.uk/fileadmin/files/Publications/Research_projects/Flows_dynamics/Transit_migration_Ukraine/Ukraine_Country%20Report_1of3.pdf |title=Research Resources Report 1/3: Country Profile: Ukraine – Europe's Mexico? |publisher=Centre on Migration Policy and Society, School of Anthropology, University of Oxford |date= 2007|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141224182452/https://www.compas.ox.ac.uk/fileadmin/files/Publications/Research_projects/Flows_dynamics/Transit_migration_Ukraine/Ukraine_Country%20Report_1of3.pdf |archivedate=24 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Events since 2014===
During and after the [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|2014 annexation of Crimea by Russia]] and the [[Russian military intervention in Ukraine (2014–present)|Russian military intervention in Ukraine]], Ukrainians living in Russia complained of being labelled a "[[Banderite]]" (follower of [[Stepan Bandera]]); even when they were from [[Stepan Bandera#Attitudes in Ukraine towards Bandera|parts of Ukraine were Stephan Bandera has no popular support]].&lt;ref name=B2014ICCPRUIU&gt;[http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2014/04/russia-ukraine-crisis-minority-under-pressure-2014423104132154242.html Russia's Ukrainian minority under pressure], [[Al Jazeera English]] (25 April 2014)&lt;br&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/a-ghost-of-world-war-ii-history-haunts-ukraines-standoff-with-russia/2014/03/25/18d4b1e0-a503-4f73-aaa7-5dd5d6a1c665_story.html A ghost of World War II history haunts Ukraine’s standoff with Russia], [[Washington Post]] (25 March 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Anti-Ukrainian sentiment===
{{See also|Anti-Ukrainian sentiment|Racism in Russia}}
Ukrainians in the Russian Federation represent the third largest ethnic group after [[Russians]] and [[Tatars]].

===Religion===
The vast majority of Ukrainians in Russia are adherents of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]. The Ukrainian clergy had a very influential role on Russian Orthodoxy in the 17th and 18th centuries.

Recently,{{when|date=August 2017}} the growing economic migrant population from [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] have had success in establishing a few [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Ukrainian Catholic churches]], and there are several churches belonging to the [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Kiev Patriarchate)]], where [[Patriarch Filaret (Denysenko)|Patriarch Filaret]] agreed to accept breakaway groups that had been excommunicated by the Russian Orthodox Church for breaches of canon law.

===Kuban===
{{main article|Ukrainians in Kuban}}

The original [[Black Sea Cossacks]] colonised the [[Kuban]] region from 1792. Following the [[Caucasus War]] and the subsequent colonisation of the Circaucasus, the Black Sea Cossacks intermixed with other ethnic groups including the indigenous [[Circassians|Cirsassian]] population.

According to the 1897 census, 47.3% of the Kuban population (including extensive latter 19th-century non-Cossack migrants from both Ukraine and Russia) referred to their native language as Little Russian (the official term for the [[Ukrainian language]]) while 42.6% referred to their native language as [[Russian language|Great Russian]].&lt;ref&gt;Demoscope.ru, 1897 census results for the [http://demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/rus_lan_97.php Kuban Oblast] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120528084326/http://demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/rus_lan_97.php |date=28 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of the cultural production in Kuban from the 1890s until the outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914, such as plays, stories and music were written in the Ukrainian language,&lt;ref name="Derluguian"&gt;The politics of identity in a Russian borderland province: the Kuban neo-Cossack movement, 1989-1996, by [[Georgi M.

[[File:Yemetz 1913a g.jpg|thumb|left|The first [[bandura]] school in 1913 organised in the Kuban directed by [[Vasyl Yemetz]] (centre).]]
In the 1920s a policy of [[Decossackization]] was pursued. At the same time, the Bolshevik authorities supported policies that promoted the Ukrainian language and self-identity, opening 700 Ukrainian-language schools and a Ukrainian department in the local university.&lt;ref&gt;Ukraine and Ukrainians Throughout the World, edited by A.L.

According to the 1926 census, there were nearly a million Ukrainians registered in the Kuban Okrug alone (or 62% of the total population)&lt;ref&gt;Kuban Okrug from the 1926 census [http://demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/rus_nac_26.php?reg=862 demoscope.ru]&lt;/ref&gt; During this period many Soviet repressions were ''tested'' on the Cossack lands, particularly the ''Black Boards'' that led to the [[Soviet famine of 1932-1934]] in the Kuban. Yet by the mid-1930s there was an abrupt policy change of Soviet attitude towards Ukrainians in Russia. In the Kuban, the Ukrainization policy was halted and reversed.&lt;ref name="Zakharchenko"&gt;{{cite web|last=Zakharchenko|first=Viktor|url=http://www.geocities.com/terek_kaz/pesni/peskub.htm|script-title=ru:Народные песни Кубани|trans-title=Folk songs of the Kuban|language=ru|website=geocities.com|date=1997|accessdate=7 November 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020211225058/http://www.geocities.com/terek_kaz/pesni/peskub.htm|archivedate=11 February 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936 the [[Kuban Cossack Chorus]] was however re-formed as were individual Cossack regiments in the [[Red Army]]. By the end of the 1930s many Cossacks' descendants chose to identify themselves as Russians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaiser|first=Robert|title=The Geography of Nationalism in Russia and the USSR|publisher=Princeton University Press, New Jersey|year=1994|isbn=0-691-03254-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; From that moment onwards almost all of the self-identified Ukrainians in the Kuban, date to non-Cossacks, the Soviet Census of 1989 showed that a total of 251,198 people in [[Krasnodar Kray]] (including [[Adyghe Autonomous Oblast]]) who were born in the Ukrainian SSR,&lt;ref&gt;Demoscope.ru Soviet Census of 1989, population distribution in region by region of birth.[http://demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/sng_pob_89.php?reg=21 Retrieved 13 November 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; and moved there by time of census. In the [[Russian Census (2002)|2002 census]], the number of people who identified themselves as Ukrainians in the Kuban was recorded to be 151,788. Despite the fact that most of the [[Kuban Cossacks]] descendants do not think of themselves as being nationally Ukrainians, and identify themselves as Russian nationals.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/rus_nac_02.php?reg=38|title=Russian census 2002|accessdate=2007-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; many elements of their unique culture originates from Ukraine, such as the [[Kuban Bandurist]] music, and the dialect called [[Balachka]] which they speak.&lt;ref name="Zakharchenko"/&gt;

===Moscow===

[[Moscow]] has had a significant Ukrainian presence since the 17th century.  The original Ukrainian settlement, bordered [[Kitai-gorod]].  No longer having a Ukrainian character, it is today is known as Maroseyka (a corruption of Malorusseyka, or [[Little Russian]]).  During Soviet times the main street, Maroseyka, was named after the Ukrainian Cossack hetman [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]]. After [[Moscow State University]] was founded in 1755, from its inception many students from Ukraine studied there. Many of these students had commenced their studies at the [[Kyiv-Mohyla Academy]].

In the first years after the revolution of 1905, Moscow was one of the major centres of the Ukrainian movement for self-awareness. The magazine Zoria was edited by [[A. Krymsky]] and from 1912-17 the Ukrainian cultural and literary magazine "Ukrainskaya zhizn'" was also published there edited by [[Symon Petliura]]. Books in the Ukrainian language were published in Moscow from 1912 and Ukrainian theatrical troops of [[M. Kropovnytsky]] and [[M. Sadovsky]] were constantly performing there.

Moscow's Ukrainians played an active role in opposing the [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|attempted coup]] in August 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Larysa |last=Trylenko |url=http://www.ukrweekly.com/Archive/1991/529104.shtml |title=The coup: Ukrainians on the barricades |journal=The Ukrainian Weekly |publisher=ukrweekly.com |volume=LIX |issue=52 |date=29 December 1991 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060520023046/http://www.ukrweekly.com/Archive/1991/529104.shtml |archivedate=20 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 2001 census, there are 253,644 Ukrainians living in the city of Moscow,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/rus_nac_02.php?reg=18 |script-title=ru:Всероссийская перепись населения 2002 года - Москва |trans-title=National Population Census 2002 - Moscow |language=ru |publisher=Demoscope.ru |issue=697-698 |date=19 September 2016 |accessdate=27 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; making them the third largest ethnic group in that city, after Russians and Tatars. A further 147,808 Ukrainians live in the [[Moscow Oblast|Moscow region]].  The Ukrainian community in Moscow operates a cultural centre on [[Arbat Street]] (whose head is appointed by the Ukrainian government),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.unian.info/world/1533307-kyiv-appointed-head-of-ukrainian-cultural-center-in-moscow-intimidated-by-russian-personnel.html |title=Kyiv-appointed head of Ukrainian Cultural Center in Moscow intimidated by Russian personnel |publisher=Unian.info |date=21 September 2016 |accessdate=27 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; publishes two Ukrainian-language newspapers, and has organized Ukrainian-language Saturday and Sunday schools.

===Saint Petersburg===
When [[Saint Petersburg]] was the capital during the [[Russian Empire]] era, many people from all nations including Ukrainians moved there. The Ukrainian poet [[Taras Shevchenko]], and [[Dmytro Bortniansky]] spent most of their lives and died there. [[Ivan Mazepa]], carrying out the orders of [[Peter the Great|Peter I]], was responsible for sending many Ukrainians to help build St Petersburg, where they died on a massive scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kraliuk|first=Petro|title=Mazepa's many faces: constructive, tragic, tragicomic|url=http://day.kyiv.ua/en/article/history-and-i/mazepas-many-faces-constructive-tragic-tragicomic|publisher=The Day|date=7 July 2009|accessdate=27 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the latest census, there are 87,119 Ukrainians living in the city of St Petersburg, where they constitute the largest non-Russian ethnic group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/rus_nac_02.php?reg=29 |script-title=ru:Всероссийская перепись населения 2002 года - Санкт Петербург |trans-title=National Population Census 2002 - St. Petersburg |language=ru |publisher=Demoscope.ru |issue=697-698 |date=19 September 2016 |accessdate=27 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former Mayor, [[Valentina Matviyenko]] (née Tyutina) was born in [[Khmelnytskyi Oblast]] of western Ukraine and is of Ukrainian ethnicity {{verify source|date=September 2011}}.

===Zeleny Klyn===
{{main article|Green Ukraine}}
[[Green Ukraine|Zeleny Klyn]] is often referred to as ''Zelena Ukraina''. This is an area of land settled by [[Ukrainians]] which is a part of the Far Eastern [[Siberia]] located on the [[Amur River]] and the [[Pacific Ocean]]. It was named by the Ukrainian settlers. The territory consists of over 1,000,000 square kilometres and has a population of 3.1 million (1958).
The Ukrainian population in 1926 made up to 26% of the population {{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}.  In the last Russian census, 94,058 people in [[Primorsky Krai]] claimed Ukrainian ethnicity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/rus_nac_02.php?reg=81 |script-title=ru:Всероссийская перепись населения 2002 года - Приморский край |trans-title=National Population Census 2002 - Primorsky Krai |language=ru |publisher=Demoscope.ru |issue=697-698 |date=19 September 2016 |accessdate=27 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; making Ukrainians the second largest ethnic group and largest ethnic minority.

===Siry Klyn===
{{main article|Grey Ukraine}}

The Ukrainian settlement of Siry Klyn (literally: the "grey wedge") developed around the city of [[Omsk]] in western Siberia. M. Bondarenko, an emigrant from Poltava province, wrote before World War I: "The city of Omsk looks like a typical Moscovite city, but the bazaar and markets speak Ukrainian". All around the city of Omsk stood Ukrainian villages. The settlement of people beyond the Ural mountains began in the 1860s. There were attempts to form an autonomous Ukrainian region in 1917-1920. Altogether before 1914 1,604,873 emigrants from Ukraine settled the area.  According to the [[Russian Census (2010)|2010 Russian census]], 77,884 people of the [[Omsk Oblast|Omsk region]] identified themselves as Ukrainians, making Ukrainians the third-largest ethnic group there, after Russians and [[Kazakhs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/rus_nac_02.php?reg=81 |script-title=ru:Всероссийская перепись населения 2002 года: Приморский край |trans-title=Russian Population Census 2002: Primorsky Krai |language=ru |publisher=Demoscope.ru |date=2002 |accessdate=3 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zholty Klyn===
{{main article|Yellow Ukraine}}

The settlement of Zholty Klyn (the Yellow Wedge) was founded soon after the [[Treaty of Pereyaslav]] of 1659 as the eastern border of the second [[Zasechnaya cherta|Zasechnaya Cherta]]. Named after the yellow steppes on the middle and lower Volga, the colony co-existed with the [[Volga Cossacks]]; colonists primarily settled around the city of [[Saratov]]. In addition to Ukrainians, [[Volga Germans]] and [[Mordovians]] migrated to Zholty Klyn in numbers. {{As of | 2014}} most of the population is mixed in the region, though a few "pure" Ukrainian villages remain.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070219091759/http://ukrvolga.seun.ru/ Zhelty Klin website]
&lt;/ref&gt;

[http://www.siryj-klyn.narod.ru/ Siry klyn Ukrainian community portal]

===Norilsk===
[[Norilsk]] was founded as a series of [[Gulag]] camps that mostly included Ukrainian collaborators with [[Nazi Germany]] who were from the western Ukraine (unlike most other Ukrainians in Russia, who are from the east).
Norilsk is the only inhabited locality in Russia (excluding villages) with a Ukrainian majority.  Ukrainians make up 59-80 percent of Norilsk's population.  Many of their descendants keep their Ukrainian identity.  Norilsk, notably, has accepted refugees from the Ukraine due to family ties with the Ukraine.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

===Far East===
Large numbers of Ukrainians live in the [[Russian Far East]] as a result of the [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|Soviet population transfers]], most of them are descendants of the deportees.

==Demographics==
===Statistics and scholarship===
Statistical information about Ukrainians in the Eastern diaspora from census materials of the Russian Empire, the Soviet Union and the Russian Federation was collected in [[Russian Empire Census|1897]], 1920, 1923, [[First All-Union Census of the Soviet Union|1926]], [[Soviet Census (1937)|1937]], 1939, 1959, 1970, 1979, [[Soviet Census (1989)|1989]], [[Russian Census (2002)|2002]] and [[Russian Census (2010)|2010]]. Of which, only the [[Soviet Census (1937)|1937 census]] has been discarded and a semi-fixed 1939 census was carried out.

In the aftermath of the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991, attention has been focused on the Eastern Ukrainian diaspora by the Society for relations with Ukrainians outside of Ukraine. Numerous attempts have been made to unite them. The journal "Zoloti Vorota" began to be published by the Society for relations with Ukrainians outside of Ukraine and also the magazine "Ukrainian Diaspora" in 1991.

===Trends===
{{main article|Demographics of Russia}}
During the 1990s, the Ukrainian population in Russia has noticeably decreased. This was caused by a number of factors. The most important one was the general population decline in Russia. At the same time, a lot of [[Economic migrants]] from Ukraine moved to Russia for better paid jobs and careers. It is estimated that there are as many as 300 000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kobza.com.ua/content/view/1425/35/|script-title=ru:Украинцы в России: еще братья, но уже гости - О "средне-потолочной" гипотезе про 4 миллиона "заробітчан" в РФ и бесславном конце "Родной Украины"|trans-title=Ukrainians in Russia: still brothers, but now guests - On the "medium ceiling" hypothesis on 4 million "(Ukrainian) workers" in the RF and the inglorious end of "Mother Ukraine"|language=ru|publisher=Ukrainians of Russia – Kobza|date=18 June 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071110124710/http://kobza.com.ua/content/view/1425/35/|archivedate=10 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; legally registered migrants. In wake of [[Racism in Russia|negative sentiments]] to the bulk of Worker migrants from the Caucasus and Central Asians, Ukrainians are thus often more trusted by the Russian population. Assimilation is also an important factor in the falling number of Ukrainians. Due to their dispersal and cultural similarity to Russians, Ukrainians often end up marrying Russians and their children are counted as Russian on the census. Otherwise the Ukrainian population has mostly remained stable due to high amounts of immigration from Ukraine.

The '''United States Economic Census''' is the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. federal government's]] official five-year measure of American business and the economy. It is conducted by the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], and response is required by law. Forms go out to nearly 4 million businesses, including large, medium and small companies representing all U.S. locations and industries. Respondents are asked to provide a range of operational and performance data for their companies. Trade associations, chambers of commerce, and businesses use information from the economic census for economic development, business decisions, and strategic planning purposes. The next Economic Census will be conducted for the year ending December 2017.&lt;ref name="econcensusbasics"&gt;https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/economic-census.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The Economic Census, together with the separately conducted censuses of [[United States Census of Agriculture|agriculture]] and [[United States Census of Governments|governments]], covers virtually the entire economy, excepting only for [[forestry]], [[agricultural]] support, [[rail transportation]], and employment by private households.&lt;ref name="econcensushistory"&gt;https://www.census.gov/econ/census/about/history.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Censuses have measured American economic activities since the first census of manufactures was taken in 1810. As the nation's economy has grown, the scope of what is now called the Economic Census expanded to include retail and wholesale trade, construction industries, mining, and a broad array of services.&lt;ref name="econcensushistory"/&gt;

Early in the 19th century, Congress responded to an increase in industrial activity and ordered census takers&amp;mdash;at that time, [[federal marshal]]s&amp;mdash;to "take an account of the several manufactures within their several districts, territories and divisions" as part of the [[1810 United States Census]]. As the marshals traveled from house to house counting the population, they asked questions on 25 broad categories of manufactured products and more than 200 kinds of goods.&lt;ref name="econcensushistory"/&gt;

In successive decades the census came to include certain non-manufacturing businesses as well, such as retail stores, lumber yards and butcher shops. Then in 1902, Congress authorized the establishment of a permanent [[United States Census Bureau|Census Bureau]], and at the same time directed that a census of manufactures be taken every five years. The 1905 manufacturing census marked the first time a census of any kind was taken separately from the regular every 10 years population census.&lt;ref name="econcensushistory"/&gt;

The first census of business, covering retail and wholesale trade, was conducted in 1930, and shortly thereafter was broadened to include some service trades. The periodic economic censuses were suspended during [[World War II]] in favor of war-oriented surveys. They resumed with the 1947 Census of Manufactures and the 1948 Census of Business.&lt;ref name="econcensushistory"/&gt;

The Economic Census almost took another hiatus when the administration of President [[Dwight Eisenhower]] failed to provide funding for the 1953 Economic Census. Then, in October 1953, the [[United States Secretary of Commerce]] appointed Dr. Ralph J. Watkins, then Director of Research for [[Dun and Bradstreet]], to form an Intensive Review Committee to study the issue. The Committee made its report, "Appraisal of Census Programs," in February 1954. Its series of testimonials from the business, financial, professional, and governmental groups represented on the Committee led to the reinstatement of the Economic Census for 1954.&lt;ref name="econcensushistory"/&gt;

The 1954 Economic Census was the first to fully integrate census taking for the various kinds of business. The census provided comparable statistics across economic sectors, using consistent time periods, concepts, definitions, classification and reporting units. For the first time, an electronic computer ([[UNIVAC 1]]) was used to process Economic Census data.&lt;ref name="econcensushistory"/&gt;

The 1954 Economic Census also was the first to be taken by [[mail]], using lists of firms provided from the administrative records of other federal agencies. Since 1963, administrative records have been used to provide basic statistics for very small firms, reducing or eliminating the need to send them census questionnaires.&lt;ref name="econcensushistory"/&gt;

The range of industries covered in the economic census has continued to expand. The census of construction industries began on a regular basis in 1967. The scope of service industries coverage was broadened at various points over the following 25 years.&lt;ref name="econcensushistory"/&gt;

The census of transportation began in 1963 as a set of surveys covering travel, transportation of commodities, and trucks. Starting in 1987, census publications also reported on business establishments engaged in several transportation industries, paralleling the data on establishments in other sectors.&lt;ref name="econcensushistory"/&gt;

The final major expansion of the Economic Census took place in 1992, adding more transportation industries, plus finance, insurance, real estate, communications, and utilities, a group accounting for more than 20 percent of U.S. gross domestic product.&lt;ref name="econcensushistory"/&gt;

The 1997 Economic Census was the first major statistical report based on the [[North American Industry Classification System]] (NAICS). Developed cooperatively by the U.S., [[Canada]], and [[Mexico]], NAICS replaced the [[Standard Industrial Classification]] (SIC) system to provide greater comparability with international statistics.&lt;ref name="econcensushistory"/&gt;

The first survey of minority-owned businesses covered 1969, and a parallel program began for women-owned businesses for 1977. Now titled the Survey of Business Owners, this program presents statistics according to the federal standard that allows respondents to report more than one race. The survey also gathers expanded characteristics of businesses and their owners, including age and veteran status of the owners and the identification of home-based business and participation in franchising.&lt;ref name="econcensushistory"/&gt;

== Purposes and Uses ==

* The economic census is the major source of facts about the structure and functioning of Nation's economy and provides vital information for government, business, industry and for general public.
* The economic census provide a vital part of the framework for such composite measures as the [[GDP]], input and output measures, production and price indices, and other statistical series that measure the short term changes in economic conditions.
* Policy making agencies of the Federal Government use data, especially in monitoring economic activity and providing assistance to business.
* State and local governments use the data to access business activities and tax bases within their authorities and to develop programs to attract tourists.
* Trade associations study trends in their own and competing industries and keep their members informed of market changes.
* Individual businesses use data to locate potential markets and to study their own production and sales performance related to industry or area.

== Types of Economic Census ==

Title 13 of the US Code (sections 131, 191, 224) manages the Census Bureau to take economic census every five years. The 1992 Economic Census consists of the following censuses:

* Census of Retail Trade
* Census of Wholesale Trade
* Census of Service Industries
* Census of Financial, Insurance and Real Estate Industries
* Census of Transportation, Communication and Utilities
* Census of  Manufactures
* Census of Mineral Industries
* Census of Construction Industries

==Data processing and confidentiality==
Responses to the Economic Census have been treated as confidential since the 19th century. Legislation authorizing the 1910 decennial census went even further and required that statistics be published so that no particular establishment or its operations could be identified.&lt;ref name="econcensushistory"/&gt;

In 1954, the confidentiality provisions were incorporated into the law ([[Title 13 of the United States Code]]) that specifies the frequency and scope of the Economic Census. The law also prescribes penalties for any disclosure by the Census Bureau, or for a respondent's false reporting or willful refusal where response is mandatory. In 1962, the confidentiality rule for census questionnaires was extended by law to also make copies retained in respondents' files immune from legal process ({{usc|13|9a}}).&lt;ref name="econcensushistory"/&gt;

The automation of the Economic Census dates back to the use of tabulating typewriters in 1900, [[punch card]] tabulating equipment in 1920, and electronic computers in 1954. Starting in 1967, selected large firms were allowed to file their reports on [[Magnetic tape data storage|computer tape]]. The 2002 Economic Census was the first to allow every firm to file electronically.&lt;ref name="econcensushistory"/&gt;

==Data dissemination==
Since 1972, most of the same statistics found in printed reports have also been available to data users in electronic media, initially on computer tape. The 1987 Economic Census was the first to be published on [[CD-ROM]], a practice continued until 2002, when the medium changed to [[DVD]]. Key 1987 statistics were also published online via CENDATA. Only a few reports were published in print for 1997, and none were printed in 2002. [[Portable document format]] (pdf) technology allowed anyone to print out 1992, 1997, and 2002 reports from their computers on demand. Since 1997, the primary means for data users to access Economic Census statistics is through [[American FactFinder]].&lt;ref name="econcensushistory"/&gt;

[[File:Van Ray Logo.jpg|thumb|The Logo of Van Ray]]
'''Van Ray''' (born 1984 in [[Düsseldorf]]) is a German artist.&lt;ref name=LetzebuergerJournal&gt;{{cite news|last1=Versall|first1=Patrick|title=Mauerbotschafter|url=http://www.journal.lu/article/mauer-botschafter/|accessdate=20 August 2014|work=Letzebuerger Journal|date=19 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His art, mostly characterized as [[street art]] or [[urban art]], makes use of various stencil techniques on vintage materials. Van Ray works from [[Cologne]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.widewalls.ch/artist/van-ray/ Van Ray] Nina K., ''Widewalls'', 11 July 2014. Retrieved 11 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; and is considered to be one of the most successful German urban art artists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.report-k.de/Kultur/Kunst/What-If-It-s-All-A-Lie-30works-Galerie-Koeln-mit-Urban-Art-von-Van-Ray-43855 Van Ray] Daniel Deininger, ''Report K'', 9 May 2015. Retrieved 12 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.widewalls.ch/van-ray-what-if-its-all-a-lie-at-30works-galerie-cologne/ Van Ray] Steve Grey, ''Widewalls'', 7 May 2015. Retrieved 12 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
[[File:Van Ray - I want to believe.jpg|thumb|"I want to believe" – paste-up by Van Ray]]

Van Ray's career began with public [[graffiti]] at the end of the 90s when he started using his art to communicate with the general public and to demonstrate social criticism. His works were based on various techniques (including stencils, stickers, paste-ups, and sculptures) and meant to express his view of Western society.&lt;ref name="LetzebuergerJournal"/&gt;

After moving to Cologne in 2007, Van Ray became the founder of the artist collaboration 'fancyroom' which concentrated on textile designs by combining elements of graffiti and graphic design. The results were used for own textile collections and by several fashion brands. The collaboration dissolved in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipw.lu/de/van-ray/#.U_RZEWMkK1p Van Ray], ''Instut Pierre Werner'', 22 June 2014. Retrieved 22 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

At this time the public art of Van Ray was attracting the attention of several [[gallery owner]]s, offering him to present his street art in their exhibitions. Consequently, the artist finally agreed to a first gallery exhibition in the winter of 2010, presenting his "streets on wood"-series in the 30Works Gallery, [[Cologne]]. Due to his public work, several solo as well as group exhibitions, live shows, art festival appearances, and panel discussions, Van Ray has since then become one of the most famous German street artists.&lt;ref name=WideWalls&gt;{{cite news|last1=K|first1=Nina|title=Van Ray|url=http://www.widewalls.ch/artist/van-ray/|accessdate=20 August 2014|work=Widewalls|date=11 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the course of the 25th anniversary of the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]], he was invited by the Institut Pierre Werner to perform his art publicly during a live performance in Luxembourg.&lt;ref name=InstitutPierreWerner&gt;{{cite news|last1=|first1=|title=Street Art Begegnung|url=http://www.ipw.lu/de/street-art-begegnung-frankreich-deutschland-luxemburg/#.U_RZy2MkK1o|accessdate=20 August 2014|work=Institut Pierre Werner |date=22 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Techniques and themes==

Van Ray's work is characterized by its detailed stencils on mostly rusty vintage materials such as iron sheets, vending machines and enamel signs or wooden slats.&lt;ref name=NRWMuseum&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wickert|first1=A|title=Update Street Art|url=http://www.nrw-museum.de/nc/aktuelles/journal/article/2012/08/24/update-street-art-ii.html|accessdate=20 August 2014|work=NRW Museum |date=24 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The works nowadays reflect a fusion of [[street art]] and [[pop art]], retaining the basic elements of his distinctive artistic style without losing sight of his intended [[social criticism]].&lt;ref name=KoelnDE&gt;{{cite news|last1=|first1=|title=Streetart mit Punks und Kinder-Bauklötzen|url=http://www.koeln.de/koeln/streetart_mit_punks_und_kinderbaukloetzen_507812.html|accessdate=20 August 2014|work=Koeln.de|date=17 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the relationship between art and protest, Van Ray commented:

"Rebellion does not derive from the use of a certain technique, but rather from the color of your tie."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oye6JKPOx84 Street art – Van Ray], ''Hessencam'', 20 May 2014. Retrieved 20 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

His works are all signed with the "duck signature symbol".&lt;ref name=Artes&gt;{{cite news|last1=|first1=|title=Van Ray|url=http://www.kunsthaus-artes.de/de/777988/Bild-Monkeys-2013/777988.html|accessdate=20 August 2014|work=Artes|date=7 May 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140821081923/http://www.kunsthaus-artes.de/de/777988/Bild-Monkeys-2013/777988.html|archive-date=21 August 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Definition and medical uses --&gt;
'''Zolpidem''', sold under the brand name '''Ambien''', [[#Brands|among others]], is a medication primarily used for the short term treatment of [[insomnia|sleeping problems]].&lt;ref name=AHFS2018&gt;{{cite web|title=Zolpidem Tartrate|url=https://www.drugs.com/monograph/zolpidem-tartrate.html|publisher=The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists|access-date= 15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UKlabel/&gt; Guidelines recommend that it be used only after [[cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia|counseling]] and behavioral changes have been tried.&lt;ref name=NICE2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=EUsleep2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=ACP2016/&gt; It decreases the time to [[sleep onset]] by about 15 minutes and at larger doses helps people stay asleep longer.&lt;ref name=AFP2017/&gt; It is taken [[by mouth]] and is available in conventional tablets or sublingual tablets and oral spray.&lt;ref name=AHFS2018/&gt;

&lt;!-- Adverse effects --&gt;
Common side effects include daytime sleepiness, headache, nausea, and diarrhea.&lt;ref name=AHFS2018/&gt; Other side effects include memory problems, [[hallucinations]], and [[Substance abuse|abuse]].&lt;ref name=AFP2017&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Matheson E, Hainer BL | title = Insomnia: Pharmacologic Therapy | journal = American Family Physician | volume = 96 | issue = 1 | pages = 29–35 | date = July 2017 | pmid = 28671376|url=https://www.aafp.org/afp/2017/0701/p29.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; The recommended dose was decreased in 2013 due to next-morning impairment.&lt;ref name=FDA2013/&gt; Additionally driving the next morning is not recommended with either higher doses or the long acting formulation.&lt;ref name=FDA2013&gt;{{cite web|title=Drug Safety and Availability - FDA Drug Safety Communication: FDA approves new label changes and dosing for zolpidem products and a recommendation to avoid driving the day after using Ambien CR|url=https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drugsafety/ucm352085.htm|website=www.fda.gov|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; While [[flumazenil]] can reverse zolpidem's effects, usually [[supportive care]] is all that is recommended in overdose.&lt;ref name=Forensic2013&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gunja N | title = The clinical and forensic toxicology of Z-drugs | journal = Journal of Medical Toxicology | volume = 9 | issue = 2 | pages = 155–62 | date = June 2013 | pmid = 23404347 | pmc = 3657020 | doi = 10.1007/s13181-013-0292-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Mechanism --&gt;
Zolpidem is a [[nonbenzodiazepine]] and [[hypnotic]] of the [[imidazopyridine]] class.&lt;ref name=AHFS2018/&gt; Zolpidem is a type A [[GABA receptor agonist]].&lt;ref name=AHFS2018/&gt; It works by increasing GABA effects in the [[central nervous system]] by binding to [[GABAA receptor|GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors]] at the same location as [[benzodiazepines]].&lt;ref name=AHFS2018/&gt; It generally has a [[Elimination half-life|half-life]] of two to three hours.&lt;ref name=AHFS2018/&gt; This, however, is increased in those with [[liver problems]].&lt;ref name=AHFS2018/&gt;

&lt;!-- History and culture --&gt;
Zolpidem was approved for medical use in the United States in 1992. &lt;ref name=AHFS2018/&gt; It became available as a [[generic medication]] in 2007.&lt;ref name=1stgeneric&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/2007/ucm108897.htm | title = FDA Approves First Generic Versions of Ambien (Zolpidem Tartrate) for the Treatment of Insomnia | work =  | access-date = 2010-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States it has a monthly cost of about {{US$}}8 for immediate release and {{US$}}66 for controlled release medication, as of 2017.&lt;ref name=AFP2017/&gt; Zolpidem is a [[Schedule IV (US)|Schedule IV]] controlled substance under the [[Controlled Substances Act of 1970]] (CSA).&lt;ref name=AFP2017/&gt; More than 10 million prescriptions are filled a year in the United States, making it one of the most commonly used treatments for sleeping problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zolpidem|url=https://livertox.nlm.nih.gov/Zolpidem.htm|website=LiverTox|access-date=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Consumer Updates - Some Sleep Drugs Can Impair Driving|url=https://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm322743.htm|website=www.fda.gov|access-date=15 March 2018|language=en|date=13 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical uses==
[[Image:Kc-zolpidem-10mg.jpg|thumb|Zolpidem Tartrate 10&amp;nbsp;mg tablets]]

Zolpidem is labelled for short-term (usually about two to six weeks) treatment of [[insomnia]] at the lowest possible dose.&lt;ref name=AHFS2018/&gt;&lt;ref name=UKlabel/&gt; It may be used for both improving [[sleep onset]] and staying asleep.&lt;ref name=AFP2017/&gt; 

Guidelines from NICE, the European Sleep Research Society, and the American College of Physicians recommend medication for insomnia (including possibly zolpidem) only as a second line treatment after nonpharmacological treatment options (e.g. [[cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia]]).&lt;ref name=NICE2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=EUsleep2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=ACP2016&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Qaseem A, Kansagara D, Forciea MA, Cooke M, Denberg TD | title = Management of Chronic Insomnia Disorder in Adults: A Clinical Practice Guideline From the American College of Physicians | journal = Annals of Internal Medicine | volume = 165 | issue = 2 | pages = 125–33 | date = July 2016 | pmid = 27136449 | doi = 10.7326/M15-2175 }} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is based in part on a 2012 review which found that zolpidem's effectiveness is nearly as much due to psychological effects as to the medication itself.&lt;ref name=TB2012&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Huedo-Medina TB, Kirsch I, Middlemass J, Klonizakis M, Siriwardena AN | title = Effectiveness of non-benzodiazepine hypnotics in treatment of adult insomnia: meta-analysis of data submitted to the Food and Drug Administration | journal = BMJ | volume = 345 | pages = e8343 | date = December 2012 | pmid = 23248080 | pmc = 3544552 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.e8343 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A lower-dose version (3.5&amp;nbsp;mg for men and 1.75&amp;nbsp;mg for women) is given as a tablet under the tongue and used for middle-of-the night awakenings. It can be taken if there are at least 4 hours between the time of administration and when the person must be awake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Intermezzo (Zolpidem Tartarate)|url=https://www.rxlist.com/intermezzo-drug.htm|website=rxlist.com|access-date=5 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contraindications==
Zolpidem should not be taken by people with obstructive [[sleep apnea]], [[myasthenia gravis]], severe [[liver disease]], respiratory depression, children, or people with psychotic illnesses.  It should not be taken by people who are or have been addicted to other substances.&lt;ref name=UKlabel/&gt;

Use of zolpidem may impair driving skills with a resultant increased risk of [[road traffic accidents]]. This adverse effect is not unique to zolpidem but also occurs with other [[hypnotic]] drugs. Caution should be exercised by motor vehicle drivers.&lt;ref name=UKlabel/&gt;  In 2013 the FDA recommended the dose for women be reduced and that prescribers should consider lower doses for men due to impaired function the day after taking the drug.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = FDA Requires Lower Dosing of Zolpidem | journal = [[The Medical Letter on Drugs and Therapeutics]] | volume = 55 | issue = 1408 | page = 5 | publisher = The Medical Letter | date = January 21, 2013 | url = http://secure.medicalletter.org/cannotaccess?ac=1&amp;a=1408a&amp;t=article&amp;n=11758&amp;p=tml&amp;title=FDA%20Requires%20Lower%20Dosing%20of%20Zolpidem&amp;i=1408 | access-date = April 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title = FDA Drug Safety Communication: Risk of next-morning impairment after use of insomnia drugs; FDA requires lower recommended doses for certain drugs containing zolpidem (Ambien, Ambien CR, Edluar, and Zolpimist) | date = January 10, 2013 | publisher = [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] | url = http://www.fda.gov/drugs/drugsafety/ucm334033.htm | access-date = April 14, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zolpidem should not be prescribed to older people, who are more sensitive to the effects of hypnotics including zolpidem and are at an increased risk of falls and adverse cognitive effects.&lt;ref name=Merel2017&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Merel |first1=SE |last2=Paauw |first2=DS |title=Common Drug Side Effects and Drug-Drug Interactions in Elderly Adults in Primary Care. |journal=Journal of the American Geriatrics Society |date=July 2017 |volume=65 |issue=7 |pages=1578-1585 |doi=10.1111/jgs.14870 |pmid=28326532}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fic2015&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors =  | title = American Geriatrics Society 2015 Updated Beers Criteria for Potentially Inappropriate Medication Use in Older Adults | journal = Journal of the American Geriatrics Society | volume = 63 | issue = 11 | pages = 2227–46 | date = November 2015 | pmid = 26446832 | doi = 10.1111/jgs.13702 | url = https://www.sigot.org/allegato_docs/1057_Beers-Criteria.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Zolpidem has been assigned to [[pregnancy category]] C by the FDA. Animal studies have revealed evidence of incomplete ossification and increased postimplantation fetal loss at doses greater than seven times the maximum recommended human dose or higher; however, teratogenicity was not observed at any dose level. There are no controlled data in human pregnancy. In one case report, zolpidem was found in cord blood at delivery. Zolpidem is recommended for use during pregnancy only when benefits outweigh risks.

Upper and lower respiratory infections are also common (experienced by between 1 and 10% of people).&lt;ref name=UKlabel/&gt;

Residual 'hangover' effects, such as sleepiness and impaired psychomotor and cognitive function, may persist into the day following nighttime administration. Such effects may impair the ability of users to drive safely and increase risks of falls and hip fractures.&lt;ref name=Forensic2013/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid15089115"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vermeeren A | title = Residual effects of hypnotics: epidemiology and clinical implications | journal = CNS Drugs | volume = 18 | issue = 5 | pages = 297–328 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15089115 | doi = 10.2165/00023210-200418050-00003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 3% of people taking zolpidem are likely to break a bone as a result of a fall due to impaired coordination caused by the drug.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Park |first1=SM |last2=Ryu |first2=J |last3=Lee |first3=DR |last4=Shin |first4=D |last5=Yun |first5=JM |last6=Lee |first6=J |title=Zolpidem use and risk of fractures: a systematic review and meta-analysis. |journal=Osteoporosis international : a journal established as result of cooperation between the European Foundation for Osteoporosis and the National Osteoporosis Foundation of the USA |date=October 2016 |volume=27 |issue=10 |pages=2935-44 |doi=10.1007/s00198-016-3605-8 |pmid=27105645}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some users have reported unexplained [[sleepwalking]] while using zolpidem, as well as sleep driving, [[night eating syndrome]] while asleep, and performing other daily tasks while sleeping.&lt;ref name=Forensic2013/&gt; Research by Australia's [[National Prescribing Service]] found these events occur mostly after the first dose taken, or within a few days of starting therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=NPS Position Statement |title=Zolpidem and sleep-related behaviours |date=July 2008 |publisher=National Prescribing Service Limited |url=http://www.nps.org.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0011/59888/Zolpidem_position_statement_To_print.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120410030254/http://www.nps.org.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0011/59888/Zolpidem_position_statement_To_print.pdf |archive-date=2012-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2008, the Australian [[Therapeutic Goods Administration]] attached a [[boxed warning]] concerning this adverse effect.&lt;ref&gt;

===Tolerance, dependence, and withdrawal===

[[Rodent]] studies of the [[drug tolerance|tolerance]]-inducing properties have shown that zolpidem has less tolerance-producing potential than [[benzodiazepines]], but in [[primate]]s, the tolerance-producing potential of zolpidem was the same as seen with benzodiazepines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Petroski RE, Pomeroy JE, Das R, Bowman H, Yang W, Chen AP, Foster AC | title = Indiplon is a high-affinity positive allosteric modulator with selectivity for alpha1 subunit-containing GABAA receptors | journal = The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics | volume = 317 | issue = 1 | pages = 369–77 | date = April 2006 | pmid = 16399882 | doi = 10.1124/jpet.105.096701 | url = http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/cgi/content/full/317/1/369 | format = PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Overdose===
Overdose can lead to coma or death.&lt;ref name=UKlabel/&gt;  When overdose occurs, there are often other drugs in the person's system.&lt;ref name=UKlabel/&gt;&lt;ref name=Forensic2013/&gt;

Zolpidem overdose can be treated with the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist [[flumazenil]], which displaces zolpidem from its binding site on the benzodiazepine receptor to rapidly reverse the effects of the zolpidem. It is unknown if dialysis is helpful.&lt;ref name=UKlabel/&gt;

===Detection in body fluids===
Zolpidem may be quantitated in blood or plasma to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in people who are hospitalized, to provide evidence in an impaired driving arrest, or to assist in a medicolegal death investigation. Blood or plasma zolpidem concentrations are usually in a range of 30–300&amp;nbsp;μg/l in persons receiving the drug therapeutically, 100–700&amp;nbsp;μg/l in those arrested for impaired driving, and 1000–7000&amp;nbsp;μg/l in victims of acute overdosage.

==Pharmacology==

===Mechanism of action===
[[Image:Zolpidem DOJ.jpg|frame|right]]
Zolpidem is a high-affinity [[allosteric modulator|positive modulator]] of [[GABAA receptor|GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors]]. It selectively binds to [[Gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor subunit alpha-1|α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]] [[Protein subunit|subunits]] of this [[pentameric protein|pentameric]] [[Ligand-gated ion channel|ion channel]]. Accordingly, it has strong [[hypnotic]] properties and weak [[anxiolytic]], [[myorelaxant]], and [[anticonvulsant]] properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Salvà P, Costa J | title = Clinical pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of zolpidem.

==Interactions==
People should not consume alcohol while taking zolpidem and should not be prescribed [[opioid]] drugs nor take such drugs recreationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm518473.htm|title=FDA Drug Safety Communication: FDA warns about serious risks and death when combining opioid pain or cough medicines with benzodiazepines; requires its strongest warning|publisher=US Food and Drug Administration|date=31 August 2016|access-date=2018-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Opioids can also increase the risk of becoming psychologically dependent on zolpidem.  Use of opioids with zolpidem increases the risk of respiratory depression and death.&lt;ref name=UKlabel/&gt;

Next day sedation can be worsened if people take zolpidem while they are also taking antipsychotics, other sedatives, anxiolytics, antidepressant agents, antiepileptic drugs, and antihistamines. Some people taking antidepressants have had visual hallucinations when they also took zolpidem.&lt;ref name=UKlabel/&gt;

Cytochrome P450 inhibitors, particularly CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 inhibitors, [[fluvoxamine]] and [[ciprofloxacin]] will increase the effects of a given dose of zolpidem.&lt;ref name=UKlabel/&gt;

Cytochrome P450 activators like [[St. John's Wort]] may decrease the activity of zolpidem.&lt;ref name=UKlabel/&gt;

==Chemistry==
Three syntheses of zolpidem are common. 4-methylacetophenone is used as a common precursor. This is brominated and reacted with 2-amino-5-methylpyridine to give the imidazopyridine. From here the reactions use a variety of reagents to complete the synthesis, either involving [[thionyl chloride]] or [[sodium cyanide]]. These reagents are challenging to handle and require thorough safety assessments.&lt;ref name=JohnsonDS&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Johnson DS, Li JJ | title = The art of drug synthesis | year = 2007 | publisher = Wiley-Interscience | location = Hoboken, N.J. | isbn = 9780471752158 | pages = Chapter 15, Section 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="prep"&gt;{{Cite patent | inventor-last = Rawalnath | inventor-first = Sakhardande Rajiv | inventor2-last = Crasta Santosh | inventor2-first = Richard | inventor3-last = SAXENA | inventor3-first = ALOK | publication-date = 21 Dec 2005 | title = Process for the preparation of zolpidem | issue-date = 14-Feb-2011 | country-code = IN | patent-number = 246080 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NaCN method"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sumalatha Y | title = A simple and efficient synthesis of hypnotic agent, zolpidem and its related substances | journal = Arkivoc | volume = 2009 | issue = 2 | pages = 315–320 | year = 2009 | pmid =  | pmc =  | doi = 10.3998/ark.5550190.0010.230 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though such safety procedures are common in industry, they make clandestine manufacture difficult.

==History==
Zolpidem was used in Europe starting in 1988 and was brought to market there by [[Synthelabo]].&lt;ref name=Trib1992&gt;{{cite news |last1=Morris |first1=Steven |title=Searle Wins Ok To Sell Sleep Aid |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1992-12-22/business/9204260442_1_zolpidem-tartrate-sleep-side-effects |work=Chicago Tribune |date=December 22, 1992 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Synthalabo and [[G.D. Searle, LLC|Searle]] collaborated to bring it to market in the US, and it was approved in the United States in 1992 under the brand name "Ambien".&lt;ref name=Trib1992/&gt; It became available as a [[generic medication]] in 2007.&lt;ref name=1stgeneric/&gt;

In 2015, the [[American Geriatrics Society]] said that zolpidem met the [[Beers criteria]] and should be avoided in older people due to its risks compared with its benefits.&lt;ref name=Merel2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fic2015/&gt;

==Society and culture==
Prescriptions in the US for all sleeping pills (including zolpidem) steadily declined from around 57 million tablets in 2013 to around 47 million in 2017, possibly in relation to concern about prescribing addictive drugs in the midst of the [[opioid crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Crow |first1=David |title=Ambien defence: the real side effects of sleeping pills |url=https://www.ft.com/content/cca81c52-6518-11e8-a39d-4df188287fff |work=Financial Times |date=June 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military use===
The [[United States Air Force]] uses zolpidem as one of the hypnotics approved as a "[[no-go pill]]"  (with a 6-hour restriction on subsequent flight operation) to help aviators and special duty personnel sleep in support of mission readiness. (The other hypnotics used are [[temazepam]] and [[zaleplon]].) "Ground tests" are required prior to authorization issued to use the medication in an operational situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://static.e-publishing.af.mil/production/1/afsoc/publication/afsoci48-101/afsoci48-101.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=March 8, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140611124025/http://static.e-publishing.af.mil/production/1/afsoc/publication/afsoci48-101/afsoci48-101.pdf |archive-date=June 11, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recreational use===
Zolpidem has potential for either medical misuse when the drug is continued long term without or against medical advice, or for recreational use when the drug is taken to achieve a "high".&lt;ref name="Brett"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brett J, Murnion B | title = Management of benzodiazepine misuse and dependence | journal = Australian Prescriber | volume = 38 | issue = 5 | pages = 152–5 | date = October 2015 | pmid = 26648651 | pmc = 4657308 | doi = 10.18773/austprescr.2015.055 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Griffiths RR, Johnson MW | title = Relative abuse liability of hypnotic drugs: a conceptual framework and algorithm for differentiating among compounds | journal = The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry | volume = 66 Suppl 9 | issue =  | pages = 31–41 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16336040 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The transition from medical use of zolpidem to high-dose addiction or [[drug dependence]] can occur with use, but some believe it may be more likely when used without a doctor's recommendation to continue using it, when physiological [[drug tolerance]] leads to higher doses than the usual 5&amp;nbsp;mg or 10&amp;nbsp;mg, when consumed through inhalation or injection, or when taken for purposes other than as a sleep aid.&lt;ref name=Brett/&gt; Recreational use is more prevalent in those having been dependent on other drugs in the past, but tolerance and [[drug dependence]] can still sometimes occur in those without a history of drug dependence. Chronic users of high doses are more likely to develop [[physical dependence]] on the drug, which may cause severe withdrawal symptoms, including seizures, if abrupt withdrawal from zolpidem occurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Barrero-Hernández FJ, Ruiz-Veguilla M, López-López MI, Casado-Torres A | title = [Epileptic seizures as a sign of abstinence from chronic consumption of zolpidem] | language = Spanish | journal = Revista De Neurologia | volume = 34 | issue = 3 | pages = 253–6 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12022074 | doi =  | trans-title = Epileptic seizures as a sign of abstinence from chronic consumption of zolpidem }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other drugs, including the benzodiazepines and [[zopiclone]], are also found in high numbers of suspected drugged drivers.&lt;ref name=Forensic2013/&gt; Many drivers have blood levels far exceeding the therapeutic dose range, suggesting a high degree of excessive-use potential for [[benzodiazepines]], zolpidem and zopiclone.&lt;ref name="pmid17417081"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jones AW, Holmgren A, Kugelberg FC | title = Concentrations of scheduled prescription drugs in blood of impaired drivers: considerations for interpreting the results | journal = Therapeutic Drug Monitoring | volume = 29 | issue = 2 | pages = 248–60 | date = April 2007 | pmid = 17417081 | doi = 10.1097/FTD.0b013e31803d3c04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  U.S. Congressman [[Patrick J.

Nonmedical use of zolpidem is increasingly common in the U.S., Canada, and the UK. Some users have reported decreased anxiety, mild [[Euphoria (emotion)|euphoria]], perceptual changes, visual distortions, and hallucinations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ksl.com/index.php?nid=248&amp;sid=588181 |title=Ambien Abuse on Rise Among Teens |work=KSL |access-date=2009-06-22 |vauthors=Mulvihill K |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220085827/http://www.ksl.com/index.php?nid=248&amp;sid=588181 |archive-date=2009-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zolpidem was used by Australian Olympic swimmers at the London Olympics in 2012, leading to controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-08-23/australian-olympic-committee-will-not-punish-swimmers-further/4908278 | title = Swimming Australia's 'Stilnox six' given final warning as AOC decides not to issue any further sanctions | publisher = www.abc.net.au | access-date = 2016-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regulation===

For the stated reason of its potential for recreational use and dependence, zolpidem (along with the other benzodiazepine-like [[Z-drug]]s) is a Schedule IV substance under the [[Controlled Substances Act]] in the U.S. The United States patent for zolpidem was held by the French pharmaceutical corporation [[Sanofi-Aventis]].&lt;ref name="US_4382938"&gt;{{Ref patent | country = US | number = 4382938 | title = Imidazo[1,2-a] pyridine derivatives and their application as pharmaceuticals | pubdate = 1983-05-10 | gdate = 1984-07-17 | inventor = Kaplan J-P, George P | assign1 = Synthelabo }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[z-drugs]] including zolpidem have been used as [[date rape drugs]].&lt;ref name=Forensic2013/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Zolpidem most frequently used date rape drug in Korea |url=http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20160229001119 |work=The Korea Herald |date=29 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zolpidem is available legally by prescription, and unlike [[gamma-hydroxybutyrate]], which is used to treat a rare form of [[narcolepsy]], and [[flunitrazepam]] (Rohypnol), which is only prescribed as a second-line choice for insomnia, zolpidem is broadly prescribed.&lt;ref name=Schrotenboer /&gt; Zolpidem can typically be detected in bodily fluids for 36 hours, though it may be possible to detect it by [[hair testing]] much later, which is due to the short [[elimination half-life]] of 2.5–3 hours.&lt;ref name=Forensic2013/&gt; This use of the drug was highlighted during proceedings against [[Darren Sharper]], who was accused of using the tablets he was prescribed to facilitate a series of rapes.&lt;ref name=Schrotenboer&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2014/03/26/darren-sharper-ambien-zolpidem-insomnia-date-rape-case/6930621/ |title=Darren Sharper case spotlights sleep drug's dark side |work=USA Today|date=2014-03-26 | first = Brent | last = Schrotenboer | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Red&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/drug-sharper-common-rapists-article-1.1616611|title=In the rape case against Darren Sharper, former LAPD detective says Ambien is used often and can be similar to GHB|location=New York |work=Daily News |date=2014-02-17 | first = Christian | last = Red | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sleepwalking===
Zolpidem received widespread media coverage in Australia after the death of a student who fell 20 m from the Sydney Harbour Bridge while under the influence of zolpidem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = &lt;!--staff editor(s);no by-line--&gt; | date = February 23, 2007 | title = Stilnox blamed for Harbour Bridge death | newspaper = nineMSN News | url = http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=381502 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070615200018/http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=381502 | archive-date = 2007-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
While cases of zolpidem improving [[aphasia]] in people with [[stroke]] have been described, use for this purpose has unclear benefit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = de Boissezon X, Peran P, de Boysson C, Démonet JF | title = Pharmacotherapy of aphasia: myth or reality? | journal = Brain and Language | volume = 102 | issue = 1 | pages = 114–25 | date = July 2007 | pmid = 16982084 | doi = 10.1016/j.bandl.2006.07.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Zolpidem has also been studied in [[persistent vegetative state]]s with unclear effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Georgiopoulos M, Katsakiori P, Kefalopoulou Z, Ellul J, Chroni E, Constantoyannis C | title = Vegetative state and minimally conscious state: a review of the therapeutic interventions | journal = Stereotactic and Functional Neurosurgery | volume = 88 | issue = 4 | pages = 199–207 | date = 2010 | pmid = 20460949 | doi = 10.1159/000314354 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2017 [[systematic review]] concluded that while there is preliminary evidence of benefit for treating disorders of movement and consciousness other than insomnia (including [[Parkinson's disease]]), more research is needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bomalaski MN, Claflin ES, Townsend W, Peterson MD | title = Zolpidem for the Treatment of Neurologic Disorders: A Systematic Review | journal = JAMA Neurology | volume = 74 | issue = 9 | pages = 1130–1139 | date = September 2017 | pmid = 28655027 | doi = 10.1001/jamaneurol.2017.1133 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Animal studies in FDA files for zolpidem showed a dose dependent increase in some types of tumors, although the studies were too small to reach statistical significance.&lt;ref name="Kripke_2016"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kripke DF | title = Hypnotic drug risks of mortality, infection, depression, and cancer: but lack of benefit | journal = F1000Research | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 918 | date = 2016 | pmid = 27303633 | pmc = 4890308 | doi = 10.12688/f1000research.8729.1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some observational epidemiological studies have found a correlation between use of benzodiazepines and certain [[hypnotic]]s including zolpidem and an increased risk of getting cancer, but others have found no correlation; a 2017 meta-analysis of such studies found a correlation, but noted that the results were tentative because some of the studies failed to control for [[confounder]]s like cigarette smoking and alcohol use, and some of the studies analyzed were [[Case–control study|case–controls]], which are more prone to some forms of bias.&lt;ref name = "Kim_2018"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kim DH, Kim HB, Kim YH, Kim JY | title = Use of Hypnotics and Risk of Cancer: A Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies | journal = Korean Journal of Family Medicine | volume = 39 | issue = 4 | pages = 211–218 | date = July 2018 | pmid = 29973038 | pmc = 6056405 | doi = 10.4082/kjfm.17.0025 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
